{"In addition to his work with The Lemonheads, Dan Stearns has also released several solo albums and collaborated with other artists.": [{"url": "https://www.museumoflost.com/the-evan-dando-incident/", "page_content": "Evan Dando was a rock star with a well-known drug problem. His 2003 meltdown at a gig in Melbourne became the stuff of local music legend.\n\nEvan Dando was born in Massachusetts in March 1967.\n\nHis parents moved to Boston when he was 10, and he attended the Commonwealth High School on the north shore. A mediocre student, Dando became interested in music and formed his first band with two schoolmates when he was a teenager.\n\nOriginally called 'Whelp!', this group would gradually morph into 'The Lemonheads', taking their name from a popular item of candy.\n\nThe Lemonheads released an EP and three albums on a small label, and regularly played local venues. They did not initially find much success; Dando even left the group for a time, appearing with other bands before taking off on an extended backpacking holiday.\n\nHe eventually made his way to Australia, bumming his way up and down the east coast, surfing and checking out the local music scene.\n\nDuring this period, Dando became friendly with two local musicians; Tom Morgan and Nic Dalton.\n\nMorgan and Dalton, best known locally as part of the band 'Smudge', considered starting a band with Dando, although in the end the three just wrote music together, and hung out.\n\nDando would take these songs with him back to America, when he returned in 1990.\n\nRejoining The Lemonheads, Dando's experience in Australia would form the backbone of what would be the band's breakthrough record.\n\nTheir 1992 album, 'It's a Shame About Ray', was a critical and commercial success, and one of the defining records of the era. The band's jangling guitars, and Dando's bittersweet, melodic voice, perfectly complemented each other on a series of classically styled pop songs.\n\nThe band's fame was assured when they produced an enduringly popular, punk-style cover of the Simon and Garfunkel track 'Mrs Robinson.' Dalton would subsequently join the Lemonheads himself, and serve as one of their guitarists, playing and touring for two years, before returning to Australia.\n\nHandsome, sensitive and laconic, Evan Dando seemed like the quintessential 90s rockstar. He also developed a drug problem; he drank heavily, smoked crack cocaine, and his behaviour was erratic at times.\n\nThe Lemonheads released a follow-up album, 'Car Button Cloth', in 1996 that was well received but less successful. They split up the following year.\n\nWithout the band to focus his energy, Dando's drug and alcohol problems worsened and his behaviour became increasingly unpredictable. Appearing as a solo act, although mostly still playing Lemonheads songs, he sometimes seemed disoriented onstage. On a few occasions, he even just walked off in the middle of a set.\n\nIn 2003, Dando finally faced his drug problems and entered rehab.\n\nThis appeared to be successful, and after his recovery he recorded his first solo album of new material, 'Baby I'm Bored'. The cleaned up, healthier singer would support this album with a world tour.\n\nFor the Australian leg, Dando turned to his old friend and colleague Dalton, asking him to play bass. Dalton agreed, and became part of what appeared to be something of an alt-rock supergroup; alongside Dando and Dalton were former Dinosaur jr drummer George Berz, and You Am I guitarist Davey Lane.\n\nAs part of this tour, two shows were set for Melbourne, in August 2003.\n\nBut it soon became apparent that Dando's new, cleaner lifestyle had not entirely taken hold.\n\nSporting a beard, a trench coat and heavy, lidded eyes, Dando's first show at The Prince was something of a mess. The singer began his set by mocking the venue:\n\n'This place used to rule! Now it sucks. God bless gentrification, right?' - Evan Dando, on stage at The Prince\n\nThings went downhill from there.\n\nClearly intoxicated, Dando mumbled his way through most of the songs, slurring the words incoherently. He appeared completely lost at times, and stood inertly for long stretches, as the band struggled to find its rhythm.\n\n'The gig was a sonic disaster. To call the band under-rehearsed would be kind, and Dando's slacker dude persona is a habit he could afford to lose. With much apology, Dando would blame the shambles on jetlag and food poisoning. Apology was certainly due.' - Michael Dwyer, review in 'The Age'\n\nStanding on the corner of the stage, Dalton plucked at his bass, looking unimpressed. He would leave the band immediately after the show, his participation in the tour over.\n\nAlthough whether he was fired, as originally announced, or left as a protest against Dando's behaviour, was never confirmed. Dalton later commented that he left because he was 'unwell'.\n\nWhatever the explanation, with a second show the following night, Dando was now without a bass player. Whether due to his own laid back nature, or because he was not making clear decisions, he simply decided to forge on without one.\n\nThe second Melbourne gig was set for August 2, 2003 at The Hi Fi Bar on Swanston Street. It would go down as one of the most notorious gigs in the city's long live music history.\n\nThe night started unremarkably: Dando onstage, by himself, singing 'The Outdoor Type'. He appeared in control of himself, his long hair hanging across his face, shirtless under a heavy jacket.\n\nThings became strange as the rest of the band joined him for the next song.\n\nAccompanying the group onstage was an unknown young girl, who promptly joined Dando at the microphone.\n\nTo everyone's amazement, the girl then proceeded to hold up lyric sheets for Dando to sing from. He required help to remember the words to his own famous songs.\n\nLater, at Dando's urging, the girl would even join in on some of them, singing soft back up vocals to the mystification of everyone present.\n\n'What followed was a show that resembled a train wreck. Perhaps hinting at the reason for the onstage disarray, Dando announced a shopping list of drugs that would be available backstage, for 'anyone who has a backstage pass.' For an encore, Dando returned to the stage alone, hopping onto the drums for a wild, messy, solo medley. Some fans cheered, but most were gape mouthed. A lot had already left in disgust. This was a performance that will surely go down as one of the most shambolic ever staged in Melbourne.' - Jo Roberts, review in 'The Age'\n\nAs a remarkable epilogue to the story, the young girl on stage would later find fame herself as the singer Missy Higgins.\n\nHiggins, a Lemonheads fan but then totally unknown, had talked her way into the sound check earlier in the day, in the hope of catching a glimpse of Dando. She and Dando had begun talking, and he had impulsively insisted that she join the band on stage.\n\nDespite the chaos of the Melbourne shows, the group was able to salvage something from the rest of the tour. Dando had gathered himself somewhat by the time they played in Sydney a week later, and the musicians had more time to rehearse, making for a tighter live set.\n\nReviews for the Sydney shows were moderately positive, and the tour continued.\n\nIn subsequent years, Dando has continued an up and down trajectory.\n\nHe has detoxed, and relapsed, a number of times. He still tours regularly, and has been back to Australia for other solo performances. His live presence remains hit and miss; there are good shows and bad, which has almost become part of buying a ticket to watch him perform.\n\nYou never know which Evan Dando will show up.\n\nRecalling his infamous Hi Fi Bar gig in an interview in 2006, Dando simply dismissed the whole thing:\n\n'The only thing I regret now is that everyone remembers it. People keep writing about it, and I can't believe people are still interested in that shit.' - Evan Dando\n\nMore MUSEUM OF LOST"}, {"url": "https://guitar.com/guides/essential-guide/guitar-legends-mark-knopfler-the-guitarist-with-inimitable-touch/", "page_content": "With one of the most recognisable sounds in the history of modern guitar, Mark Knopfler is the sort of player that it\u2019s sometimes best to just sit back and enjoy. You won\u2019t likely to be able to play exactly like him.\n\nWith a career now into its sixth decade, Knopfler has sold over 120 million albums and can still sell-out Madison Square Garden at the age of 70 (2019). Even if his core sound is unmistakeable, he\u2019s played a vast array of top-class new and vintage guitars over the years, which often change from album to album. We\u2019ll try and summarise here\u2026\n\nIn his own words\u2026\n\n\u201cSuccess I adore. It means I can buy 1959 Gibson Les Pauls and Triumph motorcycles. But I detest fame. It interferes with what you do and has no redeeming features at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how many jazz lessons you\u2019ve taken, I don\u2019t care how many modal dingbats you know. This is all shit! You should have enough reverence for music to make your own education.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was sleeping on the floor in somebody\u2019s apartment. They had a cheap imitation of a Gibson Dove acoustic with unbelievably light strings. It was like playing an electric guitar, but there was a little bit of sound to it. You couldn\u2019t really strum or bash it, so I had to fingerpick. As I was flying around this guitar, I realised I was doing things with my fingers that I could do with a pick and also some other things that I wouldn\u2019t be able to do with a pick. Playing with your fingers has something to do with immediacy and soul\u2026\u201d\n\nKnopfler\u2019s early Gibsons and Fenders\u2026.\n\nIt may have seemed odd when Knopfler \u2013 for so long associated with Fenders \u2013 became a signature Gibson artist in 2016, but he bought his first Gibson circa 1971, when he was 22. He played a second-hand \u00a380 double-cutaway Les Paul Special in early band Caf\u00e9 Racers, and it\u2019s also on the Dire Straits d\u00e9but album of 1978.\n\n\u201cWe played in pubs in London,\u201d Knopfler later remembered. \u201cI just had this 30-watt amplifier; we used to stick it up on two wooden chairs. I used to play a Gibson Les Paul Special with a pick. [Knopfler later developed his fingers-only style \u2013 Ed.] My friend Steve Phillips and I painstakingly stripped it and got it back to its original cherry finish, and it was everything to me. I don\u2019t know whether I slept with it, but it wasn\u2019t far off! So that\u2019s where Gibson started in my life, and that guitar will always have a special place in my heart.\u201d\n\nBut by the time of Dire Straits debuting properly, Knopfler had a 1961/\u201962 Fender Stratocaster which would became his main guitar of the first four Dire Straits albums\u2026 and his early signature sound. He bought his second-hand 1961/\u201962 Strat around 1977, in a stripped-back condition (the alder body was bare timber). It came with its original Fender pickups, replaced by Knopfler with DiMarzio FS-1. Note that in the 1990s, Knopfler would go back to original Fender pickups.\n\nYou can see this bare wood rosewood board Strat in early DS footage and also a bright red Strat with a rosewood board. But they are the same guitar: Knopfler had his favourite Strat refinished in late \u201978 in a colour a lot brighter than Fender\u2019s stock Fiesta Red.\n\nKnopfler also acquired a second red Strat with an all-maple neck. This is thought to be a 1962 (base model) though there are plenty of suggestions bits were added from a Japanese Fender Strat at various times. On occasion, the whole pickup/scratchplate was taken out of the \u201961 and put in the \u201962. Can\u2019t do that with a vintage Gibson!\n\nOn the first Dire Straits record, Knopfler also played his National Style O, bought off his Newcastle buddy Steve Phillips way before Dire Straits. (Note that Phillips was in The Notting Hillbillies side-project with Knopfler and Brendan Croker from the mid 80s). MK also had an even earlier 1920s tricone National \u201cbought from an old man in Wales\u201d. Very nice vintage guitars but, frankly, they were out of vogue at the time and probably quite affordable.\n\nIt was these two Nationals on all early albums: from the eponymous d\u00e9but\u2019s Water Of Love and Wild West End through the massive breakthrough Romeo And Juliet, from third album Making Movies (1980). And the late 30s National would later become iconic as the cover image of Brothers In Arms (1985).\n\nThe big time = \u2018Super Strats\u2019\n\nPreparation for that third Dire Straits album Making Movies (1980) saw brother David Knopfler leave (he wasn\u2019t happy with his brother\u2019s \u2018dictatorial\u2019 style) but also brought a found wealth for the band. Knopfler started playing Schecter-made Fender-alikes, both in Strat and Tele formats. A sunburst Schecter \u2018Strat\u2019 is featured throughout and there was also a black Tele-style Schecter. The sunburst Schecter has become known as the \u2018Dream Machine\u2019 among Knopfler aficionados: it was bought and stolen in 1980, like it was barely there! Naturally, Knopfler replaced it\u2026 with Dream Machine II. This was almost identical specs-wise but was more visually unique: it had a birds eye maple neck with no dot markers, plus a \u2018tarnished\u2019 metal scratchplate and knobs. This was used live and for fourth album Love Over Gold and some of the epic soloing on the Alchemy live album.\n\nIt\u2019s another guitar gone from Knopfler\u2019s possession, though \u2013 he donated it to Eric Clapton\u2019s second Crossroad\u2019s guitar auction in 2004, where it fetched $50,190.\n\nThe main guitar used live in the early 80s though, was a Candy Apple Red Schecter (similar, but for the finish). Knopfler\u2019s use of modern Strat-alikes was perhaps just practical: success had afforded him indulgences that he rarely took on the road, such as an all-original sunburst \u201954 Fender he called the \u2018Jurassic Strat.\u2019\n\nAlso on Love Over Gold, Knopfler started playing a then-just-launched Gibson Chet Atkins CE nylon string. It\u2019s to the fore on Private Investigations and Love Over Gold itself, and with Mark and Chet by now good friends, they swapped notes. Although highly-praised as electric-classicals, the guitars are no longer made by Gibson\u2026 expect to pay \u00a32k upwards for a fine second-hand example.\n\nBrothers in arms and Gibsons\n\nDire Straits\u2019 fifth album, Brothers In Arms saw yet another overhaul in MK\u2019s guitar armoury: looking both back and forward.\n\nKnopfler got back into Gibson Les Pauls in the 80s. He was looking for new tones beyond his single-coil guitars, and bought a Les Paul reissue sunburst, from fabled NYC store owner/luthier/ friend Rudy Pensa. Note that, prior to 1983, Gibson didn\u2019t actually call these Les Pauls \u2018Reissues\u2019. Observers claim the serial number \u2013 apparently 90006 \u2013 points to an \u201983 or \u201984, but Knopfler himself has referenced one his LPs of that time as a \u201870s\u2019. The intricacies of late 70s-to-early-80s Les Paul \u201cPreissues\u201d is convoluted anyway, as are the serial numbers. Gibson in Kalamazoo made quite a few one-offs for either select dealers (such as Pensa) or intended for the Japanese market.\n\nKnopfler also had Strat-alikes built by Rudy Pensa: and one, forward thinking for the time, was really a guitar controller. Knopfler\u2019s black Pensa had a ton of knobs and was basically custom guitar made to control (when needed) a Synclavier II synth. You possibly wouldn\u2019t associate a traditionalist such as Knopfler with \u2018guitar synthesis\u2019, but this gear came into its own on quite a few Dire Straits tracks (So Far Away being the main hit) and his burgeoning soundtrack career (Last Exit To Brooklyn, Local Hero\u2026)\n\nBut back to the Les Paul. It was likely this 80s \u2018preissue\u2019 (though not the same one seen at Live Aid 1985 \u2013 see later) that brought a new Dire Straits sound to Money For Nothing and also the track Brothers In Arms.\n\nThe much-sought-after Money For Nothing tone can lead to a wormhole. The main route is: It came from Knopfler playing around with a Les Paul and a Dunlop Cry Baby wah pedal. When he found the exact \u2018quack\u2019 sound he wanted, he got legendary tech Pete Cornish to build the circuit\u2019s sound into a rack, which was still controllable via a screwdriver-controlled pot.\n\nThe pickups were also rewired by Knopfler\u2019s tech, Ron Eve. In the Haynes Gibson Les Paul Manual, Eve explains, \u201cMark\u2019s Les Paul is a beauty, even though it\u2019s a reissue. I rewired the pickups so that the central position selector combined them \u2018out of phase\u2019. This trick was shown to me by a luthier in London a long time ago, Sam Lee, who did it accidentally on Peter Green\u2019s Les Paul. If you listen closely to the early Fleetwood Mac albums you can hear the type of sound made.\u201d\n\nBut the other route? It\u2019s less complex and gritty. Album engineer/co-producer Neil Dorfsman told Sound on Sound magazine of Money For Nothing, he recalled: \u201cI remember Mark\u2019s Les Paul Junior going through a Laney amp, and that was the sound of Money For Nothing.\u201d\n\nStandard? Junior? Rack? You\u2019ll need Knopfler\u2019s fingers to get it right anyway.\n\nKnopfler\u2019s trusty Schecters, new Pensa-Suhrs, a touch of National (on the The Man\u2019s Too Strong) and old Strats did the heavy lifting on Brothers In Arms. But the Les Paul was clearly gaining favour. Knopfler toured extensively with his main Les Paul Standard, but also treated himself to a Gibson Custom Shop model. His second LP Standard \u2018reissue\u2019 was built by Gibson Custom circa \u201984 with the one-off serial number 12849: Knopfler was born 12 August 1949. Mark used this guitar on stage during the Brothers In Arms tour and, notably, at Live Aid in July 1985. Knopfler later recalled: \u201cThat was a nice guitar, but it was all about fancy-looking tops, you know? I think a lot of English players actually prefer the plain top, which I do.\u201d\n\nThe then-new Pensa-Suhr custom guitars of Knopfler (late 80s onwards) were a way of combining his love of both Fender and Gibson tones. Often luxuriantly topped with quilted maple as of the era, they sometimes had a bucker in the bridge: other times P-90s. The guitars made Rudy Pensa\u2019s name famous worldwide: the Pensa MKI, MKII and MKD are still made and Knopfler still plays them. That said, they were only used in Dire Straits for the band\u2019s final album, On Every Street (1991).\n\nKnopfler\u2019s genuine \u2018burst beauties\n\nIf Knopfler said he could \u201cnever afford\u201d a genuine \u201858 or \u201859 vintage sunburst Standard in the 80s, he certainly could by the 1990s. So, in 1995 and now as a solo artist, he bought one \u201958 and one \u201959. \u201cMan, I didn\u2019t realise what I\u2019d been missing all these years!\u201d he told Vintage Guitar.\n\nThe \u201958 is his favourite, replicated as the Gibson Custom Mark Knopfler 1958 Les Paul. With reference to the \u201cplain top\u201d he previously remarked about preferring, he says, \u201cMy \u201958\u2019s kind of a yellowish top, and I really like that \u2013 a pale burst. I\u2019m not a big fan of all this over-glossy tiger-stripe thing.\u201d His original Gibson 1958 Les Paul was a go-to guitar for the Golden Heart tour in 1996 and has been played on numerous tracks and albums since \u2013 Sailing To Philadelphia, Shangri-La, Kill To Get Crimson, Get Lucky, Privateering et al.\n\nREAD MORE: An oral history of the Gibson Les Paul\n\nHe also has quite a few Gibson ES-330s and ES-335s. He borrowed a 335 for his guesting on Bob Dylan\u2019s Slow Train Coming and later acquired his own ES-330s (vintage \u201858 and \u201860) and ES-335s (\u201858, \u201859 and \u201860). His blonde \u201859 ES-335 is another favourite: \u201cOn (Sailing to Philadelphia\u2019s) Baloney, that\u2019s a \u201959 335 \u2013 again with a nice, fat neck \u2013 that I got through Rudy (Pensa).\u201d\n\nHe also has some beautiful old big-bodied Gibsons: a 1960 L-5 CES (used on the Notting Hillbillies album), a 1960 ES-175D (Brothers In Arms) and a rare 1953 Super 400 CES (On Every Street, live, and at the Elvis Presley tribute shows with Scotty Moore).\n\nDespite all that, he\u2019s probably still best-known for his Strat tones, and it was inevitable he got his own Fender Mark Knopfler Stratocaster in the 2000s (now discontinued). It\u2019s not particularly flashy, lovely though it is: it has a \u201857-style ash body and a vintage tinted \u00b462 C-shaped maple neck with rosewood fingerboard. The pickups were three Texas Special single-coil pickups with five-way switching and the colour was dubbed Hot Rod Red. You\u2019ll pay upwards of \u00a32k for a prime-condition used one.\n\nThe closest you\u2019ll get new is perhaps the Fender American Professional Stratocaster in Fiesta Red. That itself is a limited edition.\n\nAmps And effects\n\nIn contrast to his massive haul of vintage guitars, Knopfler\u2019s amps have remained relatively simple. A Fender Vibrolux and a Fender Twin Reverb were the backbone of early albums. Then he had a Mesa/Boogie MkIIB (around 1982) and he later switched to Soldano SL0 100s. Perhaps surprisingly, he\u2019s now started using Kemper Profilers as his stage amps.\n\nLikewise with effects; from 1980, he had Pete Cornish build him a custom rack and we can\u2019t vouch to know exactly what\u2019s in there. But notable FX over the years are a Dan Armstrong Orange Squeezer compressor (early Dire Straits), and a Crowther Hotcake overdrive. Most important is his mastery of using a volume pedal for his inimitable dynamics. He\u2019s tended towards Ernie Ball and Morley models.\n\nEssential listening\n\nWith a huge back catalogue, it\u2019s tough to recommend just a few albums. Dire Straits\u2019 hit singles are really the tip of a mighty iceberg. The eponymous debut (1978) is still a great opening salvo, Making Movies (1980) saw Knopfler writing much more ambitious songs like some kind of Geordie Springsteen, and Love Over Gold (1982) is totally epic: it\u2019s only five songs, with opener Telegraph Road hitting 14 minutes. And, of course, Brothers In Arms was simply ubiquitous \u2013 it became the best-selling CD in the UK ever.\n\nWith his more numerous solo albums, it\u2019s just as hard. That said, Sailing To Philadelphia and Privateering are highly recommended. And for songcraft, All The Roadrunning, his duet album with Emmylou Harris, is very fine. In truth, he doesn\u2019t ever make bad records.\n\n\ufeff\n\nPlaying style\n\nThis is the hard bit, as Knopfler is unique \u2013 to his numerous fans, he\u2019s simply the \u2018best\u2019 guitarist in the world. He plays fingerstyle nearly all of the time, anchoring his right pinky and fourth finger to the guitar\u2019s top and his thumb usually straight. So he fingerpicks with just three digits.\n\nHis stabbing fills were a signature of early records, alongside a peerless sense of melody.

As the frontman of Queen, Mercury was one of the most talented and innovative singers of the rock era. Born Farrokh Bulsara in Tanzania, Mercury studied piano in boarding school in India, then befriended numerous musicians at London's Ealing College of Art. Mercury died of AIDS-related bronchial pneumonia on November 24, 1991, at age 45.\n\nEarly Life\n\nMercury was born Farrokh Bulsara on September 5, 1946, in Zanzibar. Mercury's parents, Bomi and Jer Bulsara, were Parsees, or followers of the Zoroastrian religion whose ancestors came from Persia. After Bomi and Jer married, they moved to Zanzibar, Tanzania, where Bomi worked as a cashier for the British government's High Court. The family lived a fairly affluent life, with a nanny and other domestic workers. Mercury's sister, Kashmira, was born in 1952.\n\nAt the age of 8, Mercury's parents sent him to a boarding school in Bombay (now Mumbai), India, where he studied piano and spent his free time with his aunt and grandparents. It was not long before the charismatic young man joined his first band, the Hectics. In 1963, Mercury returned to Zanzibar.\n\nFollowing a bloody revolution on the islands in 1964, the family fled to London. Mercury attended the Ealing College of Art and befriended a number of musicians.\n\nIn 1969, Mercury joined a group called Ibex as their lead singer. He played with a few other bands before joining forces with his future Queen bandmates.\n\nTeeth and Vocal Range\n\nMercury was born with four extra teeth in the back of his mouth, causing his now-famous bucktooth grin. In fact, his nickname growing up was Bucky.\n\nMercury never got his teeth fixed because he was afraid it would ruin his impressive four-octave vocal range.\n\nQueen\n\nMercury met his future bandmates, drummer Roger Taylor and guitarist Brian May, around the time he moved to London in the 1960s. They met up with bassist John Deacon in 1971. The quartet, which Mercury dubbed Queen, played their first gig together that June.\n\nREAD MORE: Freddie Mercury Was Part of Brian May and Roger Taylor's Entourage Before Forming Queen\n\nIn 1973, Queen released their first album, titled Queen. They quickly followed up with their second album, Queen II, in 1974, which they recorded in over just one month. The album was the first taste of the group's signature harmonies and music styles, including ballads, folk, blues, metal, pop and rock, and included the single \"Seven Seas of Rhye.\"\n\nQueen's music, however, really only caught on with their third record, Sheer Heart Attack, also released in 1974.\n\nWith a sound that has been described as a fusion of hard rock and glam rock, Queen had an even bigger hit the following year with their fourth album, A Night at the Opera (1975).\n\nQueen's popularity continued to soar through the late 70s and early 80s with A Day at the Races (1976), News of the World (1978) and The Game (1980). After The Works (1984), the group's ability to sell albums began to wane, although Queen continued to draw huge crowds as a live act around the world.\n\nIn addition to his talents as a singer and songwriter, Mercury was a skilled showman. He knew how to entertain audiences and how to connect with them. He liked to wear costumes \u2014 often featuring skintight spandex \u2014 and strutted around the stage, encouraging fans to join in the fun. Artistic in nature, Mercury was also actively involved in designing the art for many of the group's albums.\n\nMercury also lived a lavish lifestyle. He loved champagne and liked to collect art, once spending more than $400,000 on a set of hand-painted china. Always one for a party, Mercury threw himself elaborate celebrations; for one particular birthday, he flew a group of friends to the island of Ibiza. The occasion was marked by fireworks and flamenco dancing.\n\nBy 1989, Mercury largely retreated from public life. He did not promote or tour for Queen's next album, Innuendo (1991), and rumors about possible health problems began to circulate.\n\nBefore his death, Mercury worked in the studio with Queen. These efforts were released in 1995 on Made In Heaven, the group's last album with all the original members. Gone but clearly not forgotten, this collection of Mercury's final performances reached the top of the British charts.\n\nMercury and Queen were recognized for their contributions to American music history when they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001.\n\nSongs by Freddie Mercury and Queen\n\n'Killer Queen'\n\nQueen's third album, Sheer Heart Attack, featured their first hit, \"Killer Queen,\" a song about a high-class call girl. The 1974 single hit No. 2 on the U.K. charts, and peaked at No. 12 in the U.S. Unlike most of his other music, Mercury wrote the lyrics before the music.\n\n'Bohemian Rhapsody'\n\nMercury wrote the song \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" a seven-minute rock operetta for the 1975 album, A Night at the Opera. Overdubbing his voice, Mercury showed off his four-octave vocal range on this innovative track. The song hit the top of the charts in Britain and became a Top 10 hit in the United States.\n\n'We Are the Champions' and 'We Will Rock You'\n\nThe 1978 hit \"We Are the Champions,\" off of the album News of the World, became a Top 10 song in the United States and in Britain. It was featured on a single with \"We Will Rock You.\" Both songs have taken on a life of their own as popular anthems played at sporting events.\n\n'Another One Bites the Dust'\n\nAlways exploring new and different sounds, Queen tried their hand at the big music trend of the time with the disco-flavored \"Another One Bites the Dust,\" from their 1980 album The Game.\n\n'Crazy Little Thing Called Love'\n\nAlso on of The Game, Mercury and the rest of the band showed their range as performers with the rockabilly-influenced 1980 hit \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love,\" which Mercury penned.\n\n'Under Pressure' with David Bowie\n\nIn 1981, Queen collaborated with David Bowie to create \"Under Pressure.\" A No. 1 hit in Britain, the song's distinctive bass line was later reportedly used by Vanilla Ice for his 1990 rap hit \"Ice, Ice Baby.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Inside David Bowie and Queen\u2019s 'Tense' Recording Session for \"Under Pressure\"\n\n'Radio Ga Ga'\n\nAlthough Queen's popularity began to wane in the mid-1980s, the group had a minor hit in 1984 with \"Radio Ga Ga.\" Pop musician Lady Gaga took inspiration for her stage name from the song.\n\nSolo Career\n\nIn addition to his work with Queen, Mercury released several solo albums, including 1985's Mr. Bad Guy. He also collaborated with opera singer Montserrat Caball\u00e9 for 1988's Barcelona.\n\nLive Aid Performance\n\nOne of Queen's most notable performances was in 1985 at the Live Aid charity concert. Simply dressed in a tank top and jeans, Mercury led the crowd through some of the band's greatest hits with great energy and style. He got the thousands of music fans at London's Wembley Stadium to chant along to \"We Will Rock You.\"\n\nFor many who watched the event live or on television, Queen gave one of the top performances of the day-long event, which was organized by singer and activist Bob Geldof and songwriter Midge Ure to raise money for victims of famine in Africa. Inspired by the event, the band wrote the hit \"One Vision.\"\n\nFianc\u00e9 Mary Austin\n\nOffstage, Mercury was open about his bisexuality, but he kept his relationships private. He was engaged to Mary Austin and had a seven-year relationship with Jim Hutton until his untimely death.\n\nAustin met Mercury in 1969 when she was a 19-year-old music store employee and he was a 24-year-old on the cusp of stardom. They quickly began dating; Mercury wrote the ballad \u201cLove of My Life\" for Austin.\n\nIn 1973 Mercury proposed; the wedding was called off when he revealed to her that he was bisexual. The pair remained close, and Austin tended to Mercury after his AIDS diagnosis. Mercury entrusted most of his estate and his London mansion, Garden Lodge, to Austin, who later married and had two kids.\n\n\u201cAll my lovers asked me why they couldn\u2019t replace Mary, but it\u2019s simply impossible,\u201d Mercury said in a 1985 interview. \u201cThe only friend I\u2019ve got is Mary, and I don\u2019t want anybody else. To me, she was my common-law wife. To me, it was a marriage. We believe in each other, that\u2019s enough for me.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Meet Mary Austin, the Woman Who Stole Freddie Mercury's Heart\n\nBoyfriend Jim Hutton\n\nMercury met Hutton, an Irish hairdresser, in the 1980s at a gay nightclub in London. Mercury offered to buy Hutton a drink; Hutton didn't recognize the superstar and turned him down.\n\nThe pair reconnected a year and a half later at another night club. This time they began dating, and Hutton moved in with Mercury less than a year later. Although Mercury never came out, the couple stayed together until Mercury died of AIDS in 1991.\n\nAfter Mercury's death, Austin reportedly kicked Hutton out of Garden Lodge. Hutton later wrote a book about his relationship with the singer, Mercury and Me. He died of cancer in 2010 at the age of 60.\n\nREAD MORE: The Complicated Nature of Freddie Mercury's Sexuality\n\nDeath\n\nMercury died from AIDS-related bronchial pneumonia at his London mansion on November 24, 1991. He was 45 years old.\n\nThe day before his death, on November 23, 1991, Mercury released a statement: \"I wish to confirm that I have been tested HIV-positive and have AIDS. I felt it correct to keep this information private to date to protect the privacy of those around me. However, the time has come now for my friends and fans around the world to know the truth and I hope that everyone will join with my doctors and all those worldwide in the fight against this terrible disease.\"\n\nLongtime friend and bandmate Roger Taylor provided some insight to Mercury's decision to keep his battle with AIDS private. \"He didn't want to be looked at as an object of pity and curiosity, and he didn't want circling vultures over his head,\" Taylor said, according to a report in Entertainment Weekly. The rock world mourned the loss of one of its most versatile and engaging performers.\n\nTo honor his memory, the Freddie Mercury Tribute: Concert for AIDS Awareness was held in April 1992 at Wembley Stadium. A diverse range of rock acts \u2014 from Def Leppard to Elton John \u2014 performed to celebrate Mercury and advance the fight against the disease that took his life. That same year, Mercury's mock operatic masterpiece, \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" appeared in the movie Wayne's World and made a return to the Billboard 100 pop charts, illustrating its timeless appeal.\n\n'Bohemian Rhapsody' Movie\n\nReleased in 2018, the movie Bohemian Rhapsody, starring Mr. Robot's Rami Malek as Mercury, follows the rise of Queen leading up to their legendary Live Aid performance in 1985.\n\nFollowing the movie's release, Queen's music saw a resurgence in popularity decades after their last studio album. The group's song \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" shot from 87th place globally on Spotify the day before the movie's release to 15th one week later, and it hit the Billboard 100 for a third time.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nBirth Year: 1946\n\nBirth date: September 5, 1946\n\nBirth City: Zanzibar\n\nBirth Country: Tanzania\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Freddie Mercury is best known as one of the rock world's most versatile and engaging performers and for his mock operatic masterpiece, \"Bohemian Rhapsody.\"\n\nIndustries\n\nRock\n\nAstrological Sign: Virgo\n\nSchools\n\nEaling College of Art\n\nNacionalities\n\nTanzanian (Tanzania)\n\nDeath Year: 1991\n\nDeath date: November 24, 1991\n\nDeath City: London, England\n\nDeath Country: United Kingdom\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION"}, {"url": "https://www.maveron.com/team/dan-levitan/", "page_content": "\u201cDan is the Godfather of consumer.\u201d \u2014Tim Brown, Co-CEO of Allbirds\n\nDan is our co-founder, partner, and tireless leader.

As a high-performance business coach, he has consulted in various industries such as coal, natural gas, and oil. He is famously known for his personal net worth and the net worth that he has helped others create.\n\nOver the years, he has developed the Quantum Leap Advantage from his endeavors in the business world, where he teaches his methods to eager entrepreneurs on how to create wealth.\n\nNet Worth of Dan Pena\n\nToday Dan Pena has a net worth of around $450 million. Pena is referred to as the $50 billion dollar man because that is how much wealth has been created by those he mentors using the Quantum Leap Advantage. With each year, that number is growing to the 1 Trillion dollar mark.\n\nEarly Life of Dan Pena\n\nIn his early life, Pena was not always the driven, high-performing man that he is today.\n\nThe Barrio Bad Boy of East Los Angeles\n\nPena did not come from a family with generational wealth. He was born on August 10th, 1945, in Jacksonville, Florida. His grandparents had migrated from Spain to Mexico. Then his mother and grandmother came to America in the 1940s after crossing the Rio Grande illegally. Later, his family moved to East Los Angeles. He became the first generation Mexican-American in his family. His mother was not a naturalized citizen until she was thirty years old.\n\nPena describes his barrio of East Los Angeles during the 1950s as a rough place with a life full of fighting.\n\nThe RFK Assassination Connection\n\nAs a man who believed in tough love, Dan's father, Manny Pena, was a lieutenant colonel in both WWII and the Korean War. After leaving the military, Manny joined the LAPD in 1947 and served for twenty-eight years where he grew to become a Lieutenant Commander.\n\nAfter retiring from the police force, Manny Pena was recruited by the CIA. As a CIA operative, Manny worked as lead investigator in the Robert F. Kennedy assassination. Many conspiracy theories claim that Manny Pena was responsible for covering up the ballistic's findings from the assassination of RFK. Pena also claims that his father was an assassin for the CIA and responsible for anywhere from nine to thirteen kills. Manny Pena passed away in 1991.\n\nDan Pena School Life\n\nWhile in grade school, Dan stayed in a lot of trouble. In one interview, he describes how he was expelled not only from his school but every school in the district for his unruly conduct with such acts as threatening to kill his teacher in which he attempted by dropping a glass aquarium on them.\n\nDuring his high school years as a young man, Pena had a track record and was notorious for fighting and causing trouble. He was arrested multiple times for drunk driving and alcohol-related charges. Dan's father even told local officers to beat him if he was misbehaving in public. It wasn't until he joined the military that his life would begin to change.\n\nDan Pena's Military Career to Businessman\n\nIn 1966, he volunteered for the draft at the height of the Vietnam War. Pena credits much of his business success to the military and the place where he learned self-discipline and leadership skills.\n\nMr. Pe\u00f1a entered the military as a private and a few years later left as a lieutenant commander. While in the military, he was stationed at Fort Benning in Georgia. As an officer, he spent time in Europe, where he was surrounded by senior military officers and ambassadors.\n\nIt was at this point that Pena experienced a more cultured life and a way of doing things. He knew he wanted the good life. As he was being awarded a medal from a two-star general, according to Pena, the general stated, \u201cYou know if you were in the real world, you could probably get rich.\u201d At this moment, his life would change forever and set him on his business journey.\n\nDan Pena and His Early Career\n\nIn 1971 he graduated with honors from San Fernando Valley State College, now known as California State University, Northridge, with a bachelor's degree in Business Administration. After leaving the military, he eventually made it to Wall Street. As he stated in one interview, \u201cI wanted to go where the money was.\u201d\n\nHe began his career at a commercial real estate firm in Los Angeles with a 94.6% closing rate.\n\nFrom there, he became a stockbroker for Payne Webber in the Los Angeles office. In 1972, he was transferred to the New York City office. During a five year period, he was able to double his income from the previous year. In 1977 he left Payne Webber went on to serve as an advisor, financial analyst, and business consultant with the investment banking firm of Bear Stearns in New York City.\n\nAfter starting his career, Pena realized there wasn't much difference between the military world and the business world.\n\nIn 1979, he left Bear Stearns and became the president of Kennedy Industries in Los Angeles that focused on real estate investments, natural resources, and the entertainment industry.\n\nThen in 1980, Dan Pena became the CEO and chairman of JPK Industries, where he held fifty percent ownership. Two years later, Pena would find himself ousted by shareholders.\n\nGreat Western Resources, Inc.\n\nIn July of 1982, Dan Pena founded his own company, Great Western Resources, with only $820, a phone, and a fax machine. With barely enough money, over the course of eight years, though, he grew his initial investment to a $450 million dollar natural resources business that owned several energy companies at a time when the oil business was at its worst.\n\nAfter partnering with Marion Oil in Mobile, Alabama, the joint venture gave Great Western Resources the support they needed to earn $50 million dollars in government fuel contracts.\n\nGreat Western Resources began as an oil drilling exploratory operation. Later it evolved into all aspects of the oil business from pipeline construction to refinery.\n\nAfter taking the natural resource company public on the London Stock Exchange, at the height of its influence, the company was involved in onshore and offshore drilling in addition to twenty-two coal mines.\n\nGreat Western Resources Locations\n\nGRW has locations in South America, Great Britain, and the United States.\n\nHe served as the organization's CEO until he and the Board of Directors had a falling out about a decade later in 1990 during Desert Storm. At the time, the Kuwaiti government-owned 29% of GWR stock. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, the stock price of Great Western Resources dropped by 75%. Pena was ousted again.\n\nFrom this natural resource company, Dan Pena has gone on to create much wealth. It was only after leaving Great Western Resources with half a billion dollars that Dan began to develop his high-performance, financial coaching program.\n\nDan Pena's Famous Guthrie Castle Estate\n\nSince early adulthood, Pena dreamed of owning a castle. In 1984, a year shy of his 40th birthday, he purchased the 15th-century landmark, Guthrie Castle in Angus Scotland, from the Guthrie family who had owned the property for more than 400 years.\n\nThe grounds consist of 156 acres, a horseshoe-shaped walled garden, and a loch. Also, the castle itself has thirteen bedrooms along with four cottages on the estate grounds. After a year of extensive renovations, he brought the castle back to its former glory with the addition of a golf course that now serves as his primary residence. Since purchasing the castle, the estate has undergone several additional renovations.\n\nGuthrie Castle Scandal\n\nIn the early 2000's he opened Guthrie Castle to the public, where it served a venue for weddings and public functions until 2017 when the wedding planner and coordinator for Guthrie castle was caught embezzling money and scamming brides and grooms by double-booking weddings.\n\nAfter finding out what his employee had done, Mr. Pena generously refunded each couple their money.\n\nGuthrie Castle serves as Pena's primary residence and where he hosts his Quantum Leap Advantage seminars. . It is no longer open to the publish.\n\nFounder of The Guthrie Group\n\nThe Guthrie Group, founded in 1997 and named after his famous home, has locations in Scotland and the Philippines. Pena still serves as Chairman of the Board. Mr. Pena's consultancy firm works with corporate finance clients across the globe.\n\nThe company serves as a facilitator for European financial transactions for buying and selling. They focus primarily on pre-IPO funding.\n\nWhat is the Quantum Leap Advantage?\n\nDan Pena began his career as a high-performance business coach in 1993. As the founder of Quantum Leap Advantage, the QLA methodology is based on his experience in the military and Wall Street. As a high-performance coach, Pena teaches other entrepreneurs wealth creation and how to become a high achiever. Dan provides week-long seminars at Guthrie Castle using his QLA Methodology that takes participants through the foundational steps of being successful.\n\nWorkshops include information about how to raise capital, how to overcome obstacles when pursuing an idea, and the seven necessary steps to achieve \u201csuper success.\u201d\n\nQuantum Leap Advantage Graduates\n\nAmong his most successful high-ticket, Quantum Leap Advantage Graduates include Dan Lok and Shawn Casey.\n\nOther successful Quantum Leap Advantage graduates include Klaus Kleinfield. In 2017, Kleinfield closed the largest deal in history, a deal that links Jordan with Egypt known as NEOM. Kleinfield now serves as an advisor to the Saudi Crown Prince.\n\nAs a visionary and leader, the philosophy of Dan and his high-ticket seminars are straightforward: there are no free lunches. Each person must work hard to earn what they get in life. If you have the guts to follow his steps, you can start obtaining the wealth to support your family for multiple generations.\n\nThe consensus of Dan Pena's seminars is positive when reviewing forums, blogs, and websites that discuss QLA Methodology (Quantum Leap Approach). There is no fluff or feel-good stuff to worry about with Dan's workshops. His focus is on growth. You can live a comfortable life and relax, or you can choose to pursue your goals and dreams.\n\nDespite having gone to jail multiple times in his youth, he is living proof that anyone can turn their life around.\n\nYour First 100 Million\n\nPublished in 1999, in his book, Your First 100 Million, it outlines how success is not for the touchy-feely. In the dedication he credits three men for making an impact on his life. He begins with Constantine Gratsos, an associate of shipping icon and business magnate, Aristotle Onassis, and second husband to Jaqueline Kennedy Onassis.\n\nPena states, \u201cHe took a liking to me, became my first mentor, and showed me how to swim in the deep, dangerous waters of business.\u201d\n\nThen, he gives credit for his ability to move out of his comfort zone to Jim Newman, after attending one of his seminars in 1978.\n\nHis knowledge of the oil industry is thanks to Jerry Ormand, the legendary Texas oilman. Ormand introduced Pena to the business and how to survive in it.\n\nPena uses his book as a tool for his mentees to understand the origins of his business strategy and how they can apply them to their own business.\n\nWhat are the Necessary Steps to Success Using the QLA?\n\nPena begins the Quantum Leap Advantage by recommending that you read the following:\n\nDr. Spocks Baby and Childcare\n\nThink and Grow Rich-Napolean Hill\n\nRelease Your Brakes- James Newman\n\nYou First Hundred Million (Audio Book)- Dan Pena\n\nThe 50 Million Dollar Man's QLA Book (eBook)- Dan Pena\n\nAs a high-performance coach, Mr. Pena is a firm believer that you need to learn some important lessons if you want to find success. For instance, it starts by getting out of your comfort zone and moving away from conventional wisdom. Your parents are to blame for your lack of self-esteem and ambitions. Therefore, you have to get away from your parents' influence to achieve anything.\n\nFurthermore, a person should begin by developing high-quality relationships and focus on surrounding themselves with high-performance people. From there, he recommends working on developing a sense of high self-esteem and learning how to trust your guts. Moreover, he believes that doubt is not a product of accurate thinking but habitual thinking.\n\nAccording to Pena, you have to practice being successful and begin with a strong foundation. For example, success comes from the way you look and the way you talk.\n\nAdditional Seminars\n\nThe Quantum Leap Advantage also features lessons on how to raise money for your business with the Raising Capital Series. His Deal Making and Acquisitions seminars explain how to buy larger companies using little to none of your own money.\n\nSome of the best advice that Dan Pena gives is to try to make money doing something that you are passionate about after doing good research.\n\nMore information can be found on his web site along with a free Success Test.\n\nThe Snowflake Generation\n\nPena doesn't hold back his opinion about what he calls the snowflake generation. In an interview with the London Real, he is outspoken in his belief that ordinary people today lack the mental toughness and drive to be successful.\n\nHe believes that \u201csnowflakes\u201d are too concerned with what people are going to say about them, overreact to situations and easily triggered.\n\nAs part of his QLA program, he offers The Snowflake Test for free, which is a short series of multiple-choice questions asking about childhood, parents, and how you would react to certain scenarios. It's challenging and the results are a hard pill to swallow if you aren't prepared.\n\nDan Pena on Raising Children\n\nIn addition to his views about \u201csnowflakes,\u201d the billionaire is very vocal about how people should raise their children. According to Pena, children do not do what they are told do; they do what they see their parents do.\n\nTaking into consideration how he was raised, he is adamant that parents teach their children leadership skills. It begins by equating discipline with success and understanding that success requires sacrifice.\n\nDan Pena Quotes\n\n\u201cFind something that you love that can change a billion lives.

His inspiring work has had a profound impact on the lives of countless individuals, and his message of hope and compassion continues to resonate with people from all walks of life. #RichardStearns\n\nWho is Richard Stearns\n\nPortrait of Richard Stearns, World VIsion US President\n\nStearns was born in 1951 in New York City and grew up in the suburbs of Rochester, New York. He attended Cornell University, where he earned a degree in neurobiology and behavior, and later went on to receive an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nAfter a successful career in corporate America, including stints as CEO of Lenox and Parker Brothers, Stearns felt a calling to use his business acumen and leadership skills to make a positive difference in the world. In 1998, he joined the global Christian humanitarian organization World Vision as president and CEO, and under his leadership, the organization grew significantly, expanding its reach to help millions of people in need around the world.\n\nIn addition to his work at World Vision, Stearns has also authored several books, including \u201cThe Hole in Our Gospel,\u201d which became a New York Times bestseller and won the 2010 Christian Book of the Year award. In this book, Stearns shares his personal journey of faith and the experiences that led him to become an advocate for the poor and marginalized, and he challenges readers to take action and make a difference in the world.\n\nStearns\u2019 other books include \u201cUnfinished: Believing Is Only the Beginning,\u201d which explores the idea that faith is not just a set of beliefs, but a call to action to help others, and \u201cThe Heart of Mentoring,\u201d which offers practical advice and guidance for building meaningful mentoring relationships.\n\nIn addition to his work with World Vision and his writing, Stearns is also a sought-after speaker and has shared his message of hope and compassion at events and conferences around the world. He has been recognized for his leadership and humanitarian work with numerous awards, including the prestigious Wilberforce Award for his contributions to the fight against global poverty and injustice.\n\nOne interesting fact that many people may not know about Richard Stearns is that before he became a humanitarian and advocate for the poor, he was a successful businessman and CEO of several well-known companies, including Parker Brothers and Lenox. In fact, he was responsible for launching some of the most popular board games of the 1980s, including Trivial Pursuit and Pictionary.\n\nStearns has often shared how his transition from the corporate world to humanitarian work was a result of a personal journey of faith and a growing awareness of the need to make a positive impact on the world. Despite his success in the business world, Stearns felt a calling to use his skills and resources to help those in need and to address issues of poverty and injustice around the world.\n\nThis transition from business to humanitarian work highlights Stearns\u2019 belief in the power of personal transformation and the ability of individuals to make a positive impact on the world. It also demonstrates how his own personal journey of faith and values led him to pursue a different path in life and make a profound difference in the lives of others.\n\nStearns\u2019 impact on the world cannot be overstated. Through his work with World Vision and his inspiring writing and speaking, he has touched the lives of countless individuals and has helped to bring about positive change in some of the most impoverished and marginalized communities on the planet. His message of hope and compassion continues to inspire people from all walks of life to make a difference in the world, and his legacy will continue to live on for generations to come.\n\nSubscribe To Courageous Christian Father!\n\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t miss any blog posts!

Investor Dan Calugar has volunteered with Angel Flight West for 15 years, donating his time to fly more than 200 flights, helping their mission to provide free transportation to those who need it most.\n\n\n\nAngel Flight West was created in 1983 to help families in need by arranging free transportation for their sick loved ones. Over the years, the organization has enlisted over 2,000 volunteer pilots to help complete these missions. Each pilot volunteers their time, aircraft, and experience to help fly patients to treatment facilities and hospitals for non-emergent issues.\n\n\n\nIn addition to medical flights, Angel Flight West also accepts requests for compassion flights for caregivers; specialty camps; relocation for domestic violence survivors; military personnel assistance; blood, organ, and tissue donations; disaster response; and transplant recipients. From those requests, pilots and drivers can sign up to help facilitate the travel from point A to point B.\n\n\n\nVolunteers like Daniel Calugar then introduce themselves to patients and coordinate travel details. Pilots not only provide their time but also donate fuel costs and other associated expenses. And everyone wins. Pilots get to enjoy what they do while donating their time to a great cause, and patients can travel for free to receive the care needed.\n\n\n\nIn October alone, Dan completed five flights for Angel Flight West to benefit the LifeStream organization, transporting blood donations to those in need.\n\n\n\nIt takes a special kind of person to freely give their time and resources to help someone they\u2019ve never met before. In addition to his flight time with Angel Flight West, Dan has also financially supported its operational costs throughout the years. In a conversation with Josh Olson, Executive Director of Angel Flight West, Dan shared, \u201cI feel like I have been given a lot, so it\u2019s my responsibility to give back to others.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbout Dan Calugar\n\n\n\nDaniel Calugar is a versatile and experienced investor with a background in computer science, business, and law. He developed a passion for investing while working as a pension lawyer and leveraged his technical capabilities to write computer programs that helped him identify more profitable investment strategies. When Dan isn't working, he enjoys spending time working out and being with friends and family -- and volunteering with Angel Flight.

Eliot was an American-English poet, playwright, literary critic, and editor. He is best known as a leader of the Modernist movement in poetry and as the author of such works as The Waste Land (1922) and Four Quartets (1943).\n\nT.S. Eliot attended Smith Academy, St. Louis, and Milton Academy, Massachusetts. He received a B.A. from Harvard in 1909. He spent the year 1910\u201311 in France at the Sorbonne and then returned to Harvard. By 1916 he had finished a dissertation, but he never took the final oral examination for the Ph.D. degree.\n\nT.S. Eliot , in full Thomas Stearns Eliot , (born September 26, 1888, St. Louis, Missouri , U.S.\u2014died January 4, 1965, London , England), American-English poet, playwright, literary critic, and editor, a leader of the Modernist movement in poetry in such works as The Waste Land (1922) and Four Quartets (1943). Eliot exercised a strong influence on Anglo-American culture from the 1920s until late in the century. His experiments in diction , style, and versification revitalized English poetry, and in a series of critical essays he shattered old orthodoxies and erected new ones. The publication of Four Quartets led to his recognition as the greatest living English poet and man of letters, and in 1948 he was awarded both the Order of Merit and the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nHe spent the year 1910\u201311 in France, attending Henri Bergson \u2019s lectures in philosophy at the Sorbonne and reading poetry with Alain-Fournier . Eliot\u2019s study of the poetry of Dante , of the English writers John Webster and John Donne , and of the French Symbolist Jules Laforgue helped him to find his own style. From 1911 to 1914 he was back at Harvard, reading Indian philosophy and studying Sanskrit. In 1913 he read Bradley\u2019s Appearance and Reality; by 1916 he had finished, in Europe, a dissertation entitled \u201cKnowledge and Experience in the Philosophy of F.H. Bradley.\u201d But World War I had intervened, and he never returned to Harvard to take the final oral examination for the Ph.D. degree. In 1914 Eliot met and began a close association with the American poet Ezra Pound .\n\nEliot was descended from a distinguished New England family that had relocated to St. Louis, Missouri. His family allowed him the widest education available in his time, with no influence from his father to be \u201cpractical\u201d and to go into business. From Smith Academy in St. Louis he went to Milton, in Massachusetts; from Milton he entered Harvard in 1906; he received a B.A. in 1909, after three instead of the usual four years. The men who influenced him at Harvard were George Santayana , the philosopher and poet, and the critic Irving Babbitt . From Babbitt he derived an anti-Romantic attitude that, amplified by his later reading of British philosophers F.H. Bradley and T.E. Hulme , lasted through his life. In the academic year 1909\u201310 he was an assistant in philosophy at Harvard.\n\nFor a year Eliot taught French and Latin at the Highgate School; in 1917 he began his brief career as a bank clerk in Lloyds Bank Ltd. Meanwhile, he was also a prolific reviewer and essayist in both literary criticism and technical philosophy. In 1919 he published Poems, which contained the poem \u201cGerontion,\u201d a meditative interior monologue in blank verse ; nothing like this poem had appeared in English.\n\nAlthough Pound had printed privately a small book, A lume spento, as early as 1908, \u201cPrufrock\u201d was the first poem by either of these literary revolutionists to go beyond experiment to achieve perfection. It represented a break with the immediate past as radical as that of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth in Lyrical Ballads (1798). From the appearance of Eliot\u2019s first volume, Prufrock and Other Observations , in 1917, one may conveniently date the maturity of the 20th-century poetic revolution. The significance of the revolution is still disputed, but the striking similarity to the Romantic revolution of Coleridge and Wordsworth is obvious: Eliot and Pound, like their 18th-century counterparts, set about reforming poetic diction . Whereas Wordsworth thought he was going back to the \u201creal language of men,\u201d Eliot struggled to create new verse rhythms based on the rhythms of contemporary speech. He sought a poetic diction that might be spoken by an educated person, being \u201cneither pedantic nor vulgar.\u201d\n\nEliot was to pursue four careers: editor, dramatist, literary critic, and philosophical poet. He was probably the most erudite poet of his time in the English language . His undergraduate poems were \u201cliterary\u201d and conventional. His first important publication, and the first masterpiece of Modernism in English, was \u201cThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\u201d (1915):\n\nThe Waste Land and criticism\n\nWith the publication in 1922 of his poem The Waste Land, Eliot won an international reputation. The Waste Land expresses with great power the disenchantment, disillusionment, and disgust of the period after World War I. In a series of vignettes, loosely linked by the legend of the search for the Grail, it portrays a sterile world of panicky fears and barren lusts, and of human beings waiting for some sign or promise of redemption. The poem\u2019s style is highly complex, erudite, and allusive, and the poet provided notes and references to explain the work\u2019s many quotations and allusions. This scholarly supplement distracted some readers and critics from perceiving the true originality of the poem, which lay rather in its rendering of the universal human predicament of man desiring salvation, and in its manipulation of language, than in its range of literary references. In his earlier poems Eliot had shown himself to be a master of the poetic phrase. The Waste Land showed him to be, in addition, a metrist of great virtuosity, capable of astonishing modulations ranging from the sublime to the conversational.\n\nThe Waste Land consists of five sections and proceeds on a principle of \u201crhetorical discontinuity\u201d that reflects the fragmented experience of the 20th-century sensibility of the great modern cities of the West. Eliot expresses the hopelessness and confusion of purpose of life in the secularized city, the decay of urbs aeterna (the \u201ceternal city\u201d). This is the ultimate theme of The Waste Land, concretized by the poem\u2019s constant rhetorical shifts and its juxtapositions of contrasting styles. But The Waste Land is not a simple contrast of the heroic past with the degraded present; it is, rather, a timeless simultaneous awareness of moral grandeur and moral evil. The poem\u2019s original manuscript of about 800 lines was cut down to 433 at the suggestion of Ezra Pound. The Waste Land is not Eliot\u2019s greatest poem, though it is his most famous.\n\nEliot said that the poet-critic must write \u201cprogrammatic criticism\u201d\u2014that is, criticism that expresses the poet\u2019s own interests as a poet, quite different from historical scholarship, which stops at placing the poet in his background. Consciously intended or not, Eliot\u2019s criticism created an atmosphere in which his own poetry could be better understood and appreciated than if it had to appear in a literary milieu dominated by the standards of the preceding age. In the essay \u201cTradition and the Individual Talent,\u201d appearing in his first critical volume, The Sacred Wood (1920), Eliot asserts that tradition, as used by the poet, is not a mere repetition of the work of the immediate past (\u201cnovelty is better than repetition,\u201d he said); rather, it comprises the whole of European literature, from Homer to the present. The poet writing in English may therefore make his own tradition by using materials from any past period, in any language. This point of view is \u201cprogrammatic\u201d in the sense that it disposes the reader to accept the revolutionary novelty of Eliot\u2019s polyglot quotations and serious parodies of other poets\u2019 styles in The Waste Land.\n\nAlso in The Sacred Wood, \u201cHamlet and His Problems\u201d sets forth Eliot\u2019s theory of the objective correlative:\n\nThe only way of expressing emotion in the form of art is by finding an \u201cobjective correlative\u201d; in other words, a set of objects, a situation, a chain of events which shall be the formula for that particular emotion; such that, when the external facts, which must terminate in sensory experience, are given, the emotion is immediately evoked.\n\nEliot used the phrase \u201cobjective correlative\u201d in the context of his own impersonal theory of poetry; it thus had an immense influence toward correcting the vagueness of late Victorian rhetoric by insisting on a correspondence of word and object. Two other essays, first published the year after The Sacred Wood, almost complete the Eliot critical canon: \u201cThe Metaphysical Poets\u201d and \u201cAndrew Marvell,\u201d published in Selected Essays, 1917\u201332 (1932). In these essays he effects a new historical perspective on the hierarchy of English poetry, putting at the top Donne and other Metaphysical poets of the 17th century and lowering poets of the 18th and 19th centuries. Eliot\u2019s second famous phrase appears here\u2014\u201cdissociation of sensibility,\u201d invented to explain the change that came over English poetry after Donne and Andrew Marvell. This change seems to him to consist in a loss of the union of thought and feeling. The phrase has been attacked, yet the historical fact that gave rise to it cannot be denied, and with the poetry of Eliot and Pound it had a strong influence in reviving interest in certain 17th-century poets.\n\nThe first, or programmatic, phase of Eliot\u2019s criticism ended with The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism (1933)\u2014his Charles Eliot Norton lectures at Harvard. Shortly before this his interests had broadened into theology and sociology; three short books, or long essays, were the result: Thoughts After Lambeth (1931), The Idea of a Christian Society (1939), and Notes Towards the Definition of Culture (1948). These book-essays, along with his Dante (1929), an indubitable masterpiece, broadened the base of literature into theology and philosophy: whether a work is poetry must be decided by literary standards; whether it is great poetry must be decided by standards higher than the literary.\n\nEliot\u2019s criticism and poetry are so interwoven that it is difficult to discuss them separately. The great essay on Dante appeared two years after Eliot was confirmed in the Church of England (1927); in that year he also became a British subject. The first long poem after his conversion was Ash Wednesday (1930), a religious meditation in a style entirely different from that of any of the earlier poems. Ash Wednesday expresses the pangs and the strain involved in the acceptance of religious belief and religious discipline. This and subsequent poems were written in a more relaxed, musical, and meditative style than his earlier works, in which the dramatic element had been stronger than the lyrical. Ash Wednesday was not well received in an era that held that poetry, though autonomous, is strictly secular in its outlook; it was misinterpreted by some critics as an expression of personal disillusion."}]}
