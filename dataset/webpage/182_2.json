{"Thomas Clayton Wolfe's writing style was mixing highly original, poetic, rhapsodic, and impressionistic prose with autobiographical writing.": [{"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/thomas-clayton-wolfe", "page_content": "Thomas Clayton Wolfe\n\nThomas Clayton Wolfe (1900-1938) was an American novelist of prodigious talent and equally formidable failings. His highly autobiographical novels are notable for fervent energy, uninhibited emotion, and grandly rhetorical language.\n\nThomas Wolfe achieved critical acclaim for his unabashed romanticism and visionary faith in the inherent greatness of America and the heroism of its people. He possessed an extraordinary ability for portraiture and a gift for visual detail and sensory impressions, but his brilliance is often diminished in a diffuse sea of inflated irrelevancies and ranting incantations and exhortations. Modern critics have grown less infatuated with his prose and become more aware of the lack of thematic focus, structural cohesion, and controlling artistic intelligence in even his most disciplined work.\n\nThe most striking irony in Wolfe's work is that despite his spontaneous emotionalism there is an absence of compassion for any character other than his self-identifying protagonist, and despite his mystic exaltation of sex there is little credible sexuality and even less love.\n\nLonely Childhood\n\nWolfe was born on Oct. 3, 1900, in Asheville, N.C. His mother had been a schoolteacher before marrying William O. Wolfe, a stonecutter and a man of towering assertiveness and drive. After the parents split up, Wolfe's lonely childhood was spent shuttling between the two. The death of his older brother Ben, whom he idolized, left an emotional scar from which he never recovered.\n\nAfter an outstanding scholastic record, at the age of 15 Wolfe was admitted to the University of North Carolina, where he became active in various publications and theater groups. Two plays were produced: The Return of Buck Gavin (published 1924) and The Third Night (1938). Upon graduation the embryonic author continued at Harvard University, eventually earning a master of arts degree. His involvement with the famous Playwright Workshop led to Welcome to Our City (produced at Harvard, 1923) and to work on Mannerhouse (published 1948), concerning the disintegration of a southern family. His professors' enthusiasm encouraged Wolfe to move to New York in 1923 to seek success in the theater. Failure forced him to accept a position as English instructor at New York University. In 1924 in Europe he met Aline Bernstein, a married mother of two, 16 years his senior, with whom he had a brief but intense love affair.\n\nLook Homeward, Angel\n\nIn 1926 Wolfe began work on an enormous novel which would explore and explain \"the strange and bitter magic of life.\" After some 20 months of furious writing, Wolfe left the huge, sprawling manuscript with Maxwell Perkins, editor of Scribner's. Though impressed with the author's genius, Perkins would not publish the novel until it was considerably revised and drastically cut. After a great deal of reworking and editing, Look Homeward, Angel appeared in 1929. Opening with a 90-page account of the early lives of his father and mother, the novel is a thinly disguised autobiographical record of the author's early years in the person of Eugene Gant.\n\nIn contrast to the critics' instant praise, Wolfe earned the hostility of many relatives and friends who easily recognized themselves in the novel. Though recent critical judgment of the work has been tempered by the recognition of its romantic and at times adolescent pretentiousness, Look Homeward, Angel contains vigorous prose and sequences of unquestionable power, such as the chilling conversation between Eugene and the ghost of his brother Ben, and the graphic description of his father's struggle against cancer. It is Wolfe's major contribution to American literature.\n\nWolfe resigned from New York University in 1930 and returned to Europe for a year on a fellowship. He had in mind a vast novel of several volumes which would range in time from the Civil War to the present and would replace Eugene Gant with a less autobiographical protagonist. After nearly five years of grappling with this conception\u2014while living in extreme loneliness and near poverty in Brooklyn Heights, New York City\u2014Wolfe recognized his inability to achieve a structural unity for the work.\n\nOf Time and the River\n\nPerkins insisted that Wolfe return to his previous autobiographical mode. Despite Wolfe's bitter protestations, a mammoth, haphazardly organized novel, Of Time and the River, appeared in 1935. Here the story of Eugene Gant continues, from his journey to Harvard University, through his period of personal turmoil in Europe, including an unhappy love affair, concluding with his return to the United States. The work's two outstanding sections are a vivid description of Eugene's ride to Boston and the horrifyingly effective account of the death of Gant's father.\n\nAlternating between hysterical affirmation and maudlin self-pity, the novel's young protagonist is a rather unpleasant individual whose heroic conception of himself is never sustained by objective facts. Most of the other characters are sketchily drawn, with the exception of the friend Starwick, who, like Eugene, is endowed with a tragic dimension, whose basis is never made clear. Eugene's relationship with Starwick and his horror at discovering his friend's homosexuality are psychologically ambiguous and absurdly melodramatic. The study maintains a strange effectiveness, however, because of its frequent insights into the abyss of human loneliness and the sterility of self-love.\n\nSeveral months after publication of Of Time and the River, Perkins collected several short stories and sketches extracted from Wolfe's earlier uncompleted novel. Under the title From Death to Morning, the uneven work was severely attacked by critics, although it included two of Wolfe's finest pieces of controlled narration\u2014\"Only the Dead Know Brooklyn\" and \"Death the Proud Brother.\" In 1936 Wolfe terminated his association with Perkins, largely to quell the rumor that the editor had acted as a near collaborator in the creation of his fiction, and signed with Edward C. Aswell, editor of Harper and Brothers.\n\nPosthumous Publications\n\nForgiven by his family and friends in North Carolina, for the first time in many years Wolfe returned home, where he spent several months writing and discovering that \"you can't go home again.\" He presented a voluminous manuscript to Aswell, the working outlines for a new series of novels. On vacation in the West, Wolfe suddenly contracted pneumonia, which activated a tubercular condition. He died on Sept. 15, 1938, in Baltimore.\n\nFrom the eight-foot pile of manuscript left him, Aswell compiled two novels, The Web and the Rock (1939) and You Can't Go Home Again (1940), and a volume of short stories, The Hills Beyond (1941). The novels are no less autobiographical than Wolfe's earlier ones, and despite some impressive prose in The Web and the Rock, there is no indication that Wolfe had begun to achieve mastery of his medium or to discover fresh thematic material. Wolfe's other posthumous writings include Letters to His Mother (1943), Western Journal (1951), and Letters (1956).\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe only biography of Wolfe is Andrew Turnbull, Thomas Wolfe (1968).

The family lived at 92 Woodfin Street in Asheville, North Carolina where Tom was born. His father, a successful stone carver who ran a gravestone business. His mother took in boarders and bought and sold real estate. In 1906 Julia bought a boarding house named \"Old Kentucky Home\" at nearby 48 Spruce Street in Asheville, taking up residence there with Thomas while the rest of the family remained at the Woodfin Street residence. Thomas lived in the boarding house on Spruce Street until he went to college in 1916. Wolfe began to study at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill when he was 15 years old. He was a member of the Dialectic Society and Pi Kappa Phi fraternity. Thomas was interested in becoming a playwright and in 1919 he enrolled in a playwriting course. Some plays he wrote in his life were \"The Return of Buck Gavin\" ,\"The Third Night\" and \"The Mountains\". He also edited UNC's student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel and won the Worth Prize for Philosophy for an essay titled \"The Crisis in Industry\". In June of 1920 Wolfe graduated from UNC with a B.A. He entered Graduate School for Arts and Sciences at Harvard University in September of the same year, where he studied playwriting under George Pierce Baker. In 1922, Wolfe received his master's degree from Harvard. His father died in Asheville in June of that year, an event that would strongly influence his writing. Wolfe continued to study for another year with Baker in the 47 Workshop, which produced his ten-scene play \"Welcome to Our City\". In February 1924, he began teaching English as an instructor at New York University , a position he occupied periodically for over six years. During his short life Thomas Clayton Wolfe wrote several lengthy novels, \"Look Homeward, Angel\", \"Of Time and the River\", \"The October Fair\", \"The Web and the Rock\" and \"You Can't Go Home Again\" plus many short stories, dramatic works and novellas.

He is known for mixing highly original, poetic, rhapsodic, and impressionistic prose with autobiographical writing. His books, written and published from the 1920s to the 1940s, reflect vividly on American culture and mores of the period, albeit filtered through Wolfe's sensitive, sophisticated and hyper-analytical perspective. He became very famous during his own lifetime.\n\nAfter Wolfe's death, his chief contemporary William Faulkner said that Wolfe may have had the best talent of their generation. Wolfe's influence extends to the writings of famous Beat writer Jack Kerouac, authors Ray Bradbury and Philip Roth, among others. He remains one of the most important writers in modern American literature, as he was one of the first masters of autobiographical fiction. He is considered North Carolina's most famous writer.\n\nEarly life\n\nWolfe was born in Asheville, North Carolina, the youngest of eight children of William Oliver Wolfe (1851\u20131922) and Julia Elizabeth Westall (1860\u20131945). His siblings were sister Leslie E. Wolfe (1885\u20131886); Effie Nelson Wolfe (1887\u20131950); Frank Cecil Wolfe (1888\u20131956); Mabel Elizabeth Wolfe (1890\u20131958); Grover Cleveland Wolfe (1892\u20131904); Benjamin Harrison Wolfe (1892\u20131918); and Frederick William Wolfe (1894\u20131980). Six of the children lived to adulthood.\n\nThe Wolfes lived at 92 Woodfin Street, where Tom was born. His father, a successful stone carver, ran a gravestone business. His mother took in boarders and was active in acquiring real estate. In 1904, she opened a boarding house in St. Louis, for the World's Fair. While the family was in St. Louis, 12-year-old Grover died of typhoid fever.\n\nIn 1906, Julia Wolfe bought a boarding house named \"Old Kentucky Home\" at nearby 48 Spruce Street in Asheville, taking up residence there with her youngest son while the rest of the family remained at the Woodfin Street residence. Wolfe lived in the boarding house on Spruce Street until he went to college in 1916. It is now the Thomas Wolfe Memorial. Wolfe was closest to his brother Ben, whose early death at age 26 is chronicled in Look Homeward, Angel. Julia Wolfe bought and later sold many properties, eventually becoming a successful real estate speculator.\n\nWolfe began to study at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) when he was 15 years old; he was a member of the Dialectic Society and Pi Kappa Phi fraternity and predicted that his portrait would one day hang in New West near that of celebrated North Carolina governor Zebulon Vance, which it does today.[6] Aspiring to be a playwright, in 1919 Wolfe enrolled in a playwriting course. His one-act play, The Return of Buck Gavin, was performed by the newly-formed Carolina Playmakers, then composed of classmates in Frederick Koch's playwriting class, with Wolfe acting the title role. He edited UNC's student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel and won the Worth Prize for Philosophy for an essay titled The Crisis in Industry. Another of his plays, The Third Night, was performed by the Playmakers in December 1919. Wolfe was inducted into the Golden Fleece honor society.\n\nHe graduated from UNC with a B.A. degree in June 1920. In September of that year, he entered the Graduate School for Arts and Sciences at Harvard University, where he studied playwriting under George Pierce Baker. Two versions of Wolfe's play The Mountains were performed by Baker's 47 Workshop in 1921.\n\nIn 1922, Wolfe received his Master's degree from Harvard. His father died in Asheville in June of that year, an event that would strongly influence his writing. Wolfe continued to study for another year with Baker in the 47 Workshop, which produced his ten-scene play Welcome to Our City in May 1923.\n\nWolfe visited New York City again in November 1923 and solicited funds for UNC while trying to sell his plays to Broadway. In February 1924, he began teaching English as an instructor at New York University (NYU), a position he occupied periodically for almost seven years.\n\nCareer\n\nUnable to sell any of his plays after three years due to their excessive length, including a time when the Theatre Guild came close to producing his play Welcome to Our City before ultimately rejecting it, Wolfe found his writing style more suited to fiction than the stage. He sailed to Europe in October 1924 to continue writing. From England he traveled to France, Italy and Switzerland. On his return voyage in 1925, he met Aline Bernstein (1882\u20131955), a scene designer for the Theatre Guild. 18 years his senior, Bernstein was married to a successful stock broker with whom she had two children.\n\nIn October 1925, Wolfe and Bernstein became lovers and remained so for five years. Their affair was turbulent and sometimes combative, but she exerted a powerful influence, encouraging and funding his writing. He returned to Europe in the summer of 1926 and began writing the first version of a novel, O Lost, which eventually evolved into Look Homeward, Angel. An autobiographical novel that fictionalized his early experiences in Asheville, the narrative chronicled family, friends and the boarders at his mother's establishment on Spruce Street. In the book, he renamed the town Altamont and called the boarding house \"Dixieland.\" His family was fictionalized under the name Gant, with Wolfe calling himself Eugene, his father Oliver, and his mother Eliza.\n\nThe original manuscript of O Lost was over 100 pages and 66,000 words longer and considerably more experimental in character than the final edited version of Look Homeward, Angel. The editing was done by Maxwell Perkins at Scribner's, the most prominent book editor of the time, who also worked with Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Initially, Wolfe expressed gratitude to Perkins for his disciplined editing. It has been said that Wolfe found a father figure in Perkins, who had five daughters and found in Wolfe a sort of foster son relationship. Perkins cut the book to focus more on the character of Eugene, a stand-in for Wolfe himself.\n\nWhen the novel was published 11 days before the stock market crash of 1929, Wolfe dedicated it to Bernstein. Soon after the book's publication, Wolfe returned to Europe and ended his affair with Bernstein. The publication of the novel caused a stir in Asheville, with its over 200 thinly disguised local characters. Wolfe chose to stay away from Asheville for eight years due to the uproar; he traveled to Europe for a year on a Guggenheim fellowship. Look Homeward, Angel was a bestseller in the United Kingdom and Germany. Some members of Wolfe's family were also upset with their portrayal in the book, but his sister Mabel wrote to him that she was sure he had the best of intentions.\n\nAfter four more years writing in Brooklyn, the second novel Wolfe submitted to Scribner's was The October Fair, a multi-volume epic roughly the length of Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time. After considering the commercial possibilities of publishing the book in full, Perkins opted to cut it down significantly and create a single, bestseller-sized volume, which would be titled Of Time and the River. This novel was more commercially successful than Look Homeward, Angel. In a twist from the publication of his previous novel, the citizens of Asheville were more upset this time if they hadn't been included than if they had. The character of Esther Jack was based on Bernstein. In 1934, Maxim Lieber served as his literary agent.\n\nWolfe left Scribner's and signed with Harper Bros. By some accounts, Perkins' severe editing of Wolfe's work prompted him to leave the Scribner imprint. Other accounts describe Wolfe's growing resentment that some attributed his success to Perkins' work as editor. In 1936, Bernard DeVoto, reviewing The Story of a Novel for Saturday Review, wrote that Look Homeward, Angel was \"hacked and shaped and compressed into something resembling a novel by Mr. Perkins and the assembly-line at Scribners.\"\n\nWolfe spent much time in Europe and was especially popular and at ease in Germany, where he made many friends. However, in 1936, he witnessed discriminatory incidents towards Jewish people that upset him and changed his mind about the political developments in the country. Wolfe returned to America and published a short story chronicling the incidents called \"I Have a Thing to Tell You\" in The New Republic. Following that publication, Wolfe's books were banned by the German government and he was prohibited from traveling there. Wolfe did return to Asheville in the summer of 1937 for the first time since publication of his first book.\n\nDeath\n\nIn 1938, after turning in a large body of manuscript materials, over one million words, to his new editor, Edward Aswell, Wolfe left New York for a tour of the West. On the way, he stopped at Purdue University and gave a lecture, Writing and Living, then spent two weeks traveling through 11 national parks in the West, the only part of the country he had never visited before. Wolfe wrote to Aswell that while he had focused on his family in his previous writing, he would now take a more global perspective. In July, Wolfe became ill with pneumonia while visiting Seattle, spending three weeks in the hospital there. His sister Mabel closed her boardinghouse in Washington, DC and went to Seattle to care for him. Complications arose, and Wolfe was eventually diagnosed with miliary tuberculosis of the brain.\n\nOn September 6, he was sent to Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital for treatment under the most famous neurosurgeon in the country, Dr. Walter Dandy, but an attempt at a life-saving operation revealed that the disease had overrun the entire right side of his brain. Without regaining consciousness, he died 18 days before his 38th birthday. His last writing, a journal of his two-week trip through the national parks, was found in his belongings hours after his death.\n\nDespite his disagreements with Perkins and Scribner's, on his deathbed Wolfe wrote a deeply moving letter to Perkins, whom he considered to be his closest friend. He acknowledged that Perkins had helped to realize his work and had made his labors possible. In closing he wrote:\n\n\"I shall always think of you and feel about you the way it was that Fourth of July day three years ago when you met me at the boat, and we went out on the cafe on the river and had a drink and later went on top of the tall building, and all the strangeness and the glory and the power of life and of the city was below.\"\n\nThomas Wolfe is interred in Riverside Cemetery, Asheville, North Carolina, beside his parents, W.O. and Julia Wolfe, and his siblings.\n\nThe next day, The New York Times wrote: \"His was one of the most confident young voices in contemporary American literature, a vibrant, full-toned voice which it is hard to believe could be so suddenly stilled. The stamp of genius was upon him, though it was an undisciplined and unpredictable genius.... There was within him an unspent energy, an untiring force, an unappeasable hunger for life and for expression which might have carried him to the heights and might equally have torn him down.\" Time wrote: \"The death last week of Thomas Clayton Wolfe shocked critics with the realization that, of all American novelists of his generation, he was the one from whom most had been expected.\" Due to his early death, Wolfe spent the shortest amount of time writing of any major novelist during that time, with a career less than half as long as Fitzgerald, Hemingway, or Faulkner.\n\nAfterward\n\nWolfe saw less than half of his work published in his lifetime, due to the amount of the material he left at his death. He was the first American writer to leave two complete, unpublished novels in the hands of his publisher at death. Two further Wolfe novels, The Web and the Rock and You Can't Go Home Again, were edited posthumously by Edward Aswell of Harper and Row. The novels were \"two of the longest one-volume novels (some 700 pages apiece) ever written.\" In these novels, Wolfe switched his autobiographical character from Eugene Gant to George Webber.\n\nO Lost, the original \"author's cut\" of Look Homeward, Angel, was reconstructed by F. Scott Fitzgerald scholar Matthew Bruccoli and published in 2000 on the centennial of Wolfe's birth. Bruccoli said that while Perkins was a talented editor, Look Homeward, Angel is inferior to the complete work of O Lost and that the publication of the complete novel \"marks nothing less than the restoration of a masterpiece to the literary canon.\"\n\nCritical reception and legacy\n\nUpon publication of Look Homeward, Angel, most reviewers responded favorably, including John Chamberlain, Carl Van Doren, and Stringfellow Barr. Margaret Wallace wrote in The New York Times Book Review that Wolfe had produced \"as interesting and powerful a book as has ever been made out of the drab circumstances of provincial American life.\" An anonymous review published in Scribner's magazine compared Wolfe to Walt Whitman, and many other reviewers and scholars have found similarities in their works since.\n\nWhen published in the UK in July 1930, the book received similar reviews. Richard Aldington wrote that the novel was \"the product of an immense exuberance, organic in its form, kinetic, and drenched with the love of life... I rejoice over Mr. Wolfe.\" Both in his 1930 Nobel Prize for Literature acceptance speech and original press conference announcement, Sinclair Lewis, the first American to win the Nobel Prize for literature, said of Wolfe, \"He may have a chance to be the greatest American writer.... In fact I don't see why he should not be one of the greatest world writers.\"\n\nUpon publication of his second novel, Of Time and the River, most reviewers and the public remained supportive, though some critics found shortcomings while still hailing it for moments or aspects of greatness. The book was well-received by the public and became his only American bestseller. The publication was viewed as \"the literary event of 1935\"; by comparison, the earlier attention given to Look Homeward, Angel was modest. Both The New York Times and New York Herald Tribune published enthusiastic front-page reviews. Clifton Fadiman wrote in The New Yorker that while he wasn't sure what he thought of the book, \"for decades we have not had eloquence like his in American writing.\" Malcolm Cowley of The New Republic thought the book would be twice as good if half as long, but stated Wolfe was \"the only contemporary writer who can be mentioned in the same breath as Dickens and Dostoevsky.\" Robert Penn Warren thought Wolfe produced some brilliant fragments from which \"several fine novels might be written.\" He went on to say: \"And meanwhile it may be well to recollect that Shakespeare merely wrote Hamlet; he was not Hamlet.\" Warren also praised Wolfe in the same review, though, as did John Donald Wade in a separate review.\n\nWhile acclaimed when alive as one of the most important American writers of equal quality to F. Scott Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and Faulkner, Wolfe's reputation has been \"all but destroyed\" since his death, although The New York Times wrote in 2003 that Wolfe's reputation and related scholarship appeared to be on an \"upswing.\" He is often left out of college courses and anthologies devoted to great writers. Faulkner and W.J. Cash listed Wolfe as the ablest writer of their generation, although Faulkner later qualified his praise. Despite his early admiration of Wolfe's work, Faulkner subsequently concluded that his novels were \"like an elephant trying to do the hoochie-cooochie.\" Ernest Hemingway's verdict was that Wolfe was \"the over-bloated Lil Abner of literature.\"\n\nTwo universities hold the primary archival collections of Thomas Wolfe materials in the United States: the Thomas Clayton Wolfe Papers at Harvard University's Houghton Library, which includes all of Wolfe's manuscripts, and the Thomas Wolfe Collections in the North Carolina Collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. UNC-Chapel Hill presents the annual Thomas Wolfe Prize and Lecture each October at the time of Wolfe's birthday to a contemporary writer, with past recipients including Roy Blount, Jr., Robert Morgan, and Pat Conroy.\n\nThe \"Old Kentucky Home\" was donated by Wolfe's family as the Thomas Wolfe Memorial and has been open to visitors since the 1950s, owned by the state of North Carolina since 1976 and designated as a National Historic Landmark. In 1998, 200 of the house's 800 original artifacts and the house's dining room were destroyed in an act of arson during the Bele Chere street festival, the perpetrators still unknown. After a $2.4 million restoration, the house was re-opened in 2003. Return of an Angel, by Sandra Mason, is a play that explores the reactions of Wolfe's family and the citizens of his hometown of Asheville to the publication of his novel, Look Homeward, Angel. It was produced for several years in October, next door to the Thomas Wolfe Memorial, in celebration of Wolfe's birthday. Pack Memorial Library in Asheville hosts the Thomas Wolfe Collection which \"honors Asheville's favorite son.\" The Western North Carolina Historical Association has presented the Thomas Wolfe Memorial Literary Award yearly since 1955 for a literary achievement of the previous year. The Thomas Wolfe Society celebrates Wolfe's writings and publishes an annual review about Wolfe's work. The United States Postal Service honored Wolfe with a postage stamp on the occasion of what would have been Wolfe's 100th birthday in 2000.\n\nWolfe inspired the works of many other authors, including Betty Smith with A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Robert Morgan, author of Gap Creek, and Prince of Tides author Pat Conroy, who has said, \"My writing career began the instant I finished Look Homeward, Angel.\" Jack Kerouac idolized Wolfe. Ray Bradbury was both influenced by and included Wolfe as a character in his books.\n\nThe Thomas Wolfe Society\n\nThe Thomas Wolfe Society was established in the late 1970s to promote appreciation and study of the works of this famous American author. The Society meets annually in May at locations in the U.S. or Europe visited by Wolfe. Recent conferences have been held in Greenville, South Carolina, Paris, France, and Saint Louis, Missouri. The Society issues an annual publication of Wolfe-related materials, as well as its signature journal, The Thomas Wolfe Review, featuring scholarly articles, belles lettres, and reviews. The Society also awards prizes for literary scholarship on Wolfe.\n\nAdaptations\n\nIn 1958, Ketti Frings adapted Look Homeward, Angel into a play of the same name. It ran on Broadway for 564 performances at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, received six Tony Award nominations, and won the 1958 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Frings was named \"Woman of the Year\" by The Los Angeles Times in the same year. In 1972, it was presented as a television drama, as was Of Time and the River in a one-hour version.\n\nWolfe's play Welcome to Our City was performed twice at Harvard during his graduate school years, in Zurich in German during the 1950s, and by the Mint Theater in New York City in 2000 in celebration of Wolfe's 100th birthday.\n\nWorks and Essays\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wolfe#Works\n\nExerpt from Wikitree Wolfe-2120:\n\nThomas Wolfe was born in Asheville, North Carolina, the youngest child of William Oliver Wolfe and Julia Elizabeth Westall His siblings were sister Leslie E. Wolfe , Effie Nelson Wolfe , Frank Cecil Wolfe , Mabel Elizabeth Wolfe, Grover Cleveland Wolfe , Benjamin Harrison Wolfe , and Frederick William Wolfe . The family lived at 92 Woodfin Street in Asheville, North Carolina where Tom was born. His father, a successful stone carver who ran a gravestone business. His mother took in boarders and bought and sold real estate. In 1906 Julia bought a boarding house named \"Old Kentucky Home\" at nearby 48 Spruce Street in Asheville, taking up residence there with Thomas while the rest of the family remained at the Woodfin Street residence. Thomas lived in the boarding house on Spruce Street until he went to college in 1916. Wolfe began to study at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill when he was 15 years old. He was a member of the Dialectic Society and Pi Kappa Phi fraternity. Thomas was interested in becoming a playwright and in 1919 he enrolled in a playwriting course. Some plays he wrote in his life were \"The Return of Buck Gavin\" ,\"The Third Night\" and \"The Mountains\". He also edited UNC's student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel and won the Worth Prize for Philosophy for an essay titled \"The Crisis in Industry\". In June of 1920 Wolfe graduated from UNC with a B.A. He entered Graduate School for Arts and Sciences at Harvard University in September of the same year, where he studied playwriting under George Pierce Baker. In 1922, Wolfe received his master's degree from Harvard. His father died in Asheville in June of that year, an event that would strongly influence his writing. Wolfe continued to study for another year with Baker in the 47 Workshop, which produced his ten-scene play \"Welcome to Our City\". In February 1924, he began teaching English as an instructor at New York University , a position he occupied periodically for over six years. During his short life Thomas Clayton Wolfe wrote several lengthy novels, \"Look Homeward, Angel\", \"Of Time and the River\", \"The October Fair\", \"The Web and the Rock\" and \"You Can't Go Home Again\" plus many short stories, dramatic works and novellas. He is known for mixing highly original, poetic, rhapsodic, and impressionistic prose with autobiographical writing. His last writing, a journal of his two-week trip through the national parks, was found in his belongings hours after his death."}, {"url": "https://www.factmonster.com/encyclopedia/arts/bios/american-lit/wolfe-thomas-clayton", "page_content": "Esther Jack\n\n1900\u20131938, American novelist, b. Asheville, N.C., grad. Univ. of North Carolina, 1920, M.A. Harvard, 1922. An important 20th-century American novelist, Wolfe wrote four mammoth novels, which, while highly autobiographical, present a sweeping picture of American life. He was the son of William Oliver Wolfe, a stonecutter, and Julia Westall Wolfe, a boardinghouse keeper and speculator in real estate. Wolfe's early, insistent efforts to become a playwright met with frustration and failure. In 1924 he became an instructor at New York Univ., teaching there until 1930; thereafter he wrote mostly in New York City or abroad. During the late 1920s he was closely associated with Aline Bernstein (theof his novels), a noted theatrical designer, who was a major influence in his adult life.\n\nIn 1929, under the rigorous editorial guidance of Maxwell Perkins, he published his first novel, Look Homeward, Angel. After the appearance of its sequel, Of Time and the River (1935), he broke with Perkins and signed a contract with Harper & Brothers, with Edward Aswell as his editor. After Wolfe died at 38 from complications following pneumonia, Aswell arranged from the material left at Wolfe's death two novels\u2014The Web and the Rock (1939) and You Can't Go Home Again (1940)\u2014and a volume of stories and fragments, The Hills Beyond (1941). Wolfe's other publications include From Death to Morning (1935), a collection of short stories; and The Story of a Novel (1936), a record of how he wrote his second book.\n\nWolfe's works compose a picture, left somewhat incomplete by his premature death. They describe the life of a youth from the rural South through his education to his career in New York City as a teacher and writer. Wolfe's major theme was almost always himself\u2014his own inner and outer existence\u2014his gropings, his pain, his self-discovery, and his endless search for an enduring faith. He was obsessed by memory, time, and location, and his novels convey a brilliant sense of place. His writing is characterized by a lyrical and dramatic intensity, by the weaving and reweaving of a web of sensuous images, and by rhapsodic incantations.\n\nSee his letters, ed. by E.

Wolfe wrote four lengthy novels as well as many short stories, dramatic works, and novellas. He is known for mixing highly original, poetic, rhapsodic, and impressionistic prose with autobiographical writing. His books, written and published from the 1920s to the 1940s, vividly reflect on American culture and the mores of that period, filtered through Wolfe\u2019s sensitive, sophisticated, and hyper-analytical perspective. His most popular work, Look Homeward Angel (1929), an autobiographical piece centering on his alter ego, Eugene Gant, fictionalized his early experiences in Asheville, North Carolina and chronicled family, friends, and the boarders at his mother\u2019s establishment on Spruce Street. In the book, he renamed the town Altamont and called the boarding house \u201cDixieland.\u201d His family\u2019s surname became Gant, and Wolfe called himself Eugene, his father Oliver, and his mother Eliza. The novel caused a stir in Asheville, with its over 200 thinly disguised local characters. Some members of Wolfe\u2019s family were also upset with their portrayal in the book. Wolfe saw less than half of his work published in his lifetime, there being much unpublished material remaining after his death of miliary tuberculosis. He was the first American writer to leave two complete, unpublished novels in the hands of his publisher at death. The Web and the Rock and You Can\u2019t Go Home Again, were edited posthumously by Edward Aswell of Harper & Brothers. In these novels, Wolfe changed the name of his autobiographical character from Eugene Gant to George Webber. \u2014http://www.biography.com, Wikipedia\n\nAvailable Formats\n\nUTF-8 text 20191021.txt HTML 20191021.html Epub 20191021.epub If you cannot open a .mobi file on your mobile device, please use .epub with an appropriate eReader.
