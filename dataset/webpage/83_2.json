Many worried that the $100 million-plus venue was too technically demanding, and that only Canada's sliders would have enough time to adapt to it during practice.

Already in Vancouver everybody knew they had to change things on the track for the next Sochi Olympics. The run on the track definitely had to be slowed down.\n\nAs a result, Sochi has got a \u2018roller-coaster-like track\u2019 as reported in the New York Times, which runs more than about 10 kilometers per hour slower than the one in 2010.\n\nAt 21 years of age, Kumaritashvili died without fulfilling his ultimate wish \u2013 becoming an Olympic champion. He was on his final official training run when he lost control at high speed and crashed into a steel pole at 143.3 km per hour.\n\nSo fast, not so good\n\nFour years after Kumaritashvili\u2019s fatal run at the luge track in Vancouver, his friends, family, his country\u2019s government and society have been searching for answers and trying to determine the real reason why the athlete died. Was it a result of driving errors committed by Kumaritashvili(as the International Luge Federation (FIL) report claimed) or was it because of imperfections in the track?\n\nFour years after Kumaritashvili\u2019s death and with a new Olympic competition coming up, friends and family continue to seek answers and action.\n\nThe Olympic bag in Nodar's room, it was sent to Nodar's family after the Games in Vancouver.

See more \"In Pictures\".\n\nAttempts have been made to prevent such a tragedy happening again, as the accident caused Sochi Olympics organisers to rethink the design of the luge track in Sochi. The track is slower and features three uphill sections, an unprecedented number of hills. The first two were added to reduce speed and the third, near the end of the track, in order to provide a drastic raise where the track curls over itself. The designers made firm brakes where there speeds are expected to reach 160 kilometers per hour.\n\nThe track in Sochi runs slower than one in Vancouver. Photo by James Hill. See more \"In Pictures\".\n\nBesides the uphill parts, the track has unusual 17 curves which begin with sharp descent or vice versa, dipping away at a sharp angle.\n\nImmediately after Kumaritashvili\u2019s crash, changes were made to the Vancouver Olympic luge track.The FIL made the start of the track lower however explained this change was made to reduce emotional difficulty for the athletes. Following the tragic accident, the luge competition continued on schedule. Meanwhile before Kumaritashvili\u2019s crash, a number of other athletes had also crashed on the luge course.\n\nCase\u2019s not closed\n\nGeorgia\u2019s Minister of Sport Levan Kipiani said the issue cannot be closed until society has no more questions.\n\n\"Yes there is a report by the experts but on the other hand, changes occured at the Vancouver luge track and the start was made lower as well. Besides this, other athletes were seriously injured at the same track before Nodar\u2019s death. Accordingly, since public interest is high towards this case I would not say the case is closed,\u201d Kipiani said.\n\nThe Kumaritashvili family are a traditional luging family and Nodar\u2019s father David won the USSR Championship three times.

This is the same belief of his daughter, Nodar\u2019s younger sister. She says everybody knows, including the FIL, that Nodar was a professional luger and he would not make such a crucial mistake on the track.\n\n\"If he wasn\u2019t a professional or had a lack of experience he would not have undergone the strict qualification process and become an Olympian,\u201d Mari Kumaritashvili says.\n\nChristian Niccum, an American luger who will compete at his third Olympics in Sochi, told the New York Times: \"It\u2019s such a terrible thing to say it\u2019s his fault; it\u2019s so much easier to say it\u2019s someone else\u2019s fault or the track\u2019s fault. But in the end, he\u2019s the one on that sled.\u201d\n\nCanadian Olympic luger Regan Lauscher wrote an article for the Calgary Herald stating Kumaritashvili\u2019s death was about as probable as \"getting hit by lightning.\"\n\n\"We race our unarmored bodies down ice tracks with no brakes and no mechanism for slowing down. There is no seatbelt and no air bag. ... Hence, we go fast.

They are sure the Whistler Slide Center\u2019s track in Vancouver had been changed because it was not built correctly.\n\nKumaritashvilis\u2019 family are continuing to grieve their son but are faced with other problems.\n\nBesides financial needs, they are not satisfied with the amount of attention granted by the Municipality to Kumaritashvlis\u2019 grave in his home village Bakuriani, in the Borjomi province. They were promised a luge track would be erected in Kumaritashvili\u2019s name but four years after his death, this has not started.\n\nNodar's grave in Bakuriani. Photo by N. Alavidze.

They said they were also promised that Nodar\u2019s grave behind the Holy Christmas Church in Bakuriani would be adequately fenced order to keep it well protected but this has not happened. Furthermore, they were told the Olympic Committee would build a museum in Bakuriani which would be named after Kumaritashvili.\n\nBeneath Kumaritashvili\u2019s grave, there is a stone memorial which depicts the late athlete on a luge with Olympic rings above.\n\n\"Yes, Nodar would go to Sochi,\u201d his father said.\n\n\"He was training since he was eight years old and he knew how difficult training for that goal was. The goal is the peak to your training and you devote all your time in your life \u2013 the goal was the Olympic Games. This is why he would go to Sochi\u2026if he were here,\u201d he said.\n\nNodar Kumaritashvili will be honoured at the Sochi Olympic Competition, though."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Nodar-Kumaritashvili", "page_content": "Nodar Kumaritashvili (Georgian: \u10dc\u10dd\u10d3\u10d0\u10e0 \u10e5\u10e3\u10db\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8\u10e2\u10d0\u10e8\u10d5\u10d8\u10da\u10d8; [n\u0254dar k\u02b0umarit\u02bca\u0283vili]; 25 November 1988 \u2013 12 February 2010) was a Georgian one-man luger who suffered a fatal crash during a training run for the 2010 Winter Olympics competition in Whistler, Canada, on the day of the opening ceremony. He became the fourth athlete to die during Winter Olympics preparations, and the seventh athlete to die in either a Summer or Winter Olympic Games.\n\nKumaritashvili, who first began to luge when he was 13, came from a family of seasoned lugers; his grandfather had introduced luge to Georgia, and both his father and uncle had competed when they were younger, with his uncle later serving as the head of the Georgian Luge Federation. Kumaritashvili himself began competing in the 2008\u201309 Luge World Cup. Kumaritashvili had also been a student at the Georgian Technical University, where he earned an economics degree in 2009.\n\nLife and career\n\nKumaritashvili was born on 25 November 1988, in Borjomi, Georgian SSR, present-day Georgia, to David and Dodo Kumaritashvili. He had one sister, Mariam, who was four years younger. Kumaritashvili grew up nearby Bakuriani, which is known for its many ski hills, and he enjoyed several winter sports. Kumaritashvili started luge when he was 13 years old. While maintaining a rigorous training and competition schedule, Kumaritashvili attended the Georgian Technical University, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics in 2009. A devout member of the Georgian Orthodox Church, he prayed at church before every competition. Though his family endured economic hardship, Kumaritashvili attended as many luge events as he could, often driving for days to reach World Cup events.\n\nKumaritashvili's family has had a long association with luge. His father, David, won a USSR Youth Championship when Georgia was part of the Soviet Union, and was a three-time champion at the Spartakiad, once in two-man bobsled and twice in luge. His uncle, Felix Kumaritashvili, served as the head of the Georgian Luge Federation. Nodar's grandfather, Aleko Kumaritashvili, introduced luge to Georgia after training for the sport in East Germany. Aleko helped establish a luge run in Bakuriani in 1970, and a more developed track was funded by the Soviet authorities in 1973.\n\nDuring his first season of competition, Kumaritashvili finished 55th out of 62 competitors at the 2008\u201309 Luge World Cup, where he was entered in four races. Kumaritashvili finished 28th out of 32 competitors at the 2009\u201310 Luge World Cup event at Cesana Pariol in January, which was his fifth and last World Cup event. At the time of his death, he was ranked 44th out of 65 competitors in the 2009\u201310 World Cup season and was regarded as one of the best lugers to come from Georgia.\n\nAccident and death\n\nBy 31 December 2009, the cut-off date for luge qualifications for the Olympics, Kumaritashvili was ranked 38th overall. As he had also raced in the minimum of five World Cup races over the previous two years, he qualified for the luge men's singles event at the 2010 Winter Olympics, which would be his Olympic debut. On 12 February 2010, Kumaritashvili was fatally injured in a crash during his final training run\u2014after 25 previous attempts, 15 of which were from the men's start\u2014at the Whistler Sliding Centre. He lost control in the penultimate turn of the course and was thrown off his luge and over the sidewall of the track, striking an unprotected steel support pole at the end of the run. He was travelling at 143.6 km/h (89.2 mph) at the moment of impact. At a test event in 2009, a luger had clocked a record 153.937 km/h (95.652 mph) on the same track, prompting Josef Fendt, president of the International Luge Federation (FIL), to comment: \"It makes me worry.\"\n\nMedics were at his side immediately after crash. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation were both performed. He was airlifted to a Whistler hospital, where he died of his injuries. It was luge's first fatality since 10 December 1975, when an Italian luger was killed. Kumaritashvili became the fourth athlete to die during Winter Olympics preparations\u2014after British luger Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski and Australian skier Ross Milne (both 1964 Innsbruck), and Swiss speed skier Nicolas Bochatay (1992 Albertville)\u2014and the seventh athlete to die in either a Summer or Winter Olympic Games.\n\nGeorgian response\n\nThere was shock and mourning in Georgia after footage of his death was televised. In response to the accident, the Georgian team announced that it would consider skipping the opening ceremonies or withdrawing from the games entirely, but Nika Rurua, the Georgian minister for sports and culture, later announced the team would stay in Vancouver and \"dedicate their efforts to their fallen comrade\". The other seven members of the Georgian Olympic team wore black armbands during the opening ceremony, tied a black ribbon to the Georgian flag, and left a space vacant in the procession, as marks of respect. They were greeted with a standing ovation from the assembled crowd, and left BC Place Stadium immediately after the procession.\n\nA moment of silence was held during the opening ceremonies to honour his memory, when both the Canadian and Olympic flags were lowered to half-staff. Fellow teammate and luger Levan Gureshidze, who was to compete with Kumaritashvili, withdrew after the crash, telling teammates that he \"couldn't go on\", and went home to attend the funeral.\n\nEarly in the morning of 17 February 2010, Kumaritashvili's body arrived in Tbilisi. It reached his hometown of Bakuriani later that day, and he was buried on Saturday, 20 February, at the church he attended. Thousands of Georgians had attended a funeral feast for him the day before, and Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili attended his funeral service dressed in a Georgian Olympic uniform.\n\nIn Bakuriani, the street where Kumaritashvili's childhood home is located was renamed in his honour. Felix Loch of Germany, who won the gold medal in luge at the Vancouver Olympics, had his medal melted down into two disks; one was inscribed with an image of Kumaritashvili and given to his parents. The FIL donated \u20ac10,000 to the Kumaritashvili family, at the request of the Georgian Luge Federation, in an effort to rebuild their home. The tragedy was hard on the family; twice in the years afterwards Dodo, who continued to make a meal for Kumaritashvili every day, tried to kill herself, while David dealt with severe health problems resulting in multiple stays in hospital.\n\nOther responses\n\nThe FIL stated that Kumaritashvili's death \"was not caused by an unsafe track\". As a preventive measure, the walls at the exit of curve 16 were raised and the ice profile was adjusted. Padding was also added to exposed metal beams near the finish line. Olympic officials claimed the changes were \"not for safety reasons but to accommodate the emotional state of the lugers\". In addition, the start of the men's luge was moved to the women's starting point to reduce speed, while the start of the women's luge was also moved farther down the track.\n\nTraining runs on the track resumed on 13 February, after the changes to the track had been finished. Three lugers, including Kumaritashvili's teammate Levan Gureshidze, did not participate in any training runs on 13 February. Gureshidze decided to fly back to Georgia to mourn the loss of his teammate, and the athletes who participated all wore a black stripe on their helmets in honour of Kumaritashvili.\n\nInternational Luge Federation report\n\nOn 19 April 2010, the FIL published its final report to the International Olympic Committee on Kumaritashvili's death. The report found that the sled used by Kumaritashvili had met all FIL standards. It attributed the accident to \"driving errors starting in curve 15/16 which as an accumulation ended in the impact that resulted in him leaving the track and subsequently hitting a post. ... This is a tragic result that should not have occurred as a result of an initial driving error\". As the sled hit the wall at the curve-16 exit, it catapulted off the track, causing Kumaritashvili to lose control of it entirely. This was a type of accident not seen before, and therefore \"[w]ith the unknown and unpredictable dynamics of this crash, the calculation and construction of the walls in that section of the track did not serve to prevent the tragedy that happened\". However, the report also determined that during the homologation (certification) process and later sessions at the Whistler Sliding Centre, the track was faster than originally calculated. While calculations called for a top speed around 136 km/h (85 mph), the highest speed recorded was 153.98 km/h (95.68 mph). The FIL felt that luge athletes were able to cope with this speed, but \"this was not a direction the FIL would like to see the sport head [in]\". FIL President Fendt wrote to the Sochi 2014 Olympic Organizing Committee that the FIL would homologize the proposed Sochi track only if speeds did not exceed 130 to 135 km/h (81 to 84 mph). The FIL also said it was \"determined\" to do what it could to prevent such accidents occurring. It would re-examine changes to the sport, sled design, and track technology. FIL Secretary General Svein Romstad summarized: \"What happened to Nodar has been an unforeseeable fatal accident\".\n\nCoroner's report\n\nThe British Columbia coroner's office investigated the incident. It was reported to be considering, among other pieces of evidence, written complaints about the safety of the Whistler track by Venezuelan luger Werner Hoeger\u2014who crashed on the track on 13 November 2009, suffering a severe concussion\u2014and information suggesting that the track was constructed in its present location, near the Whistler and Blackcomb mountains, for commercial reasons, despite the site being too narrow and steep. The track designer, Udo Gurgel, said: \"The track had to be near Whistler, for use after the Olympics. You don't want to ruin an investment so the track is on terrain that's a little steep.\" According to John Furlong, the chief executive of the 2010 Winter Olympics organizing committee, proposals to build the sliding centre on Grouse Mountain near Vancouver were rejected early in the bid phase due to reservations expressed by international bobsled, luge, and skeleton federations.\n\nIn a report dated 16 September 2010, the coroner ruled Kumaritashvili's death an accident brought on by a \"convergence of several factors\", including the high speed of the track, its technical difficulty, and the athlete's relative unfamiliarity with the track. He wrote that during Kumaritashvili's training runs, it was reasonable to assume that \"Mr. Kumaritashvili was sliding faster than ever before in his life, and was attempting to go even faster, while simultaneously struggling to learn the intricacies of the track and the dynamics it created\". The coroner accepted that luging would always carry an element of risk and that best practices known at the time had been followed in the construction of the Whistler track. He also called upon the International Luge Federation to require athletes to engage in more mandatory training sessions prior to the Olympic Games and other major competitions. Responding to the report, Kumaritashvili's father said: \"I don't accept the statement about Nodar's lack of experience. He wouldn't have won the right to take part in the Olympics if he lacked experience.\"\n\nIn 2013, Mont Hubbard, a University of California, Davis, mechanical and aerospace professor, issued a report claiming that Kumaritashvili's crash was probably caused by a \"fillet\", a joint between the lower edge of the curve and a vertical wall. Hubbard suggested that the right runner of Kumaritashvili's sled rose up the fillet, launching him into the air. Terry Gudzowsky, the president of ISC/IBG Group, a consortium involved in the construction of the Whistler track, dismissed Hubbard's theory as \"flawed\", stating that the data to replicate the ice surface at the site of the accident in three dimensions do not exist. The luge track built for use at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, was designed with two uphill sections to reduce speeds, and for runs about 10 miles per hour (16 km/h) slower than the Whistler track."}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/cnews-us-olympics-georgia-funeral-idCATRE61J1HC20100220", "page_content": "BAKURIANI, Georgia (Reuters) - Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili was buried before thousands of mourners in his snowbound hometown Saturday as debate raged over the safety of the track that claimed his life at the Vancouver Olympics.\n\nPeople carry the coffin with the body of Georgian luge competitor Nodar Kumaritashvili during a funeral in Bakuriani, some 160 km (100 miles) west of Tbilisi, February 20, 2010.

(AP Photo/Sandra Skutane, File)\n\nLuge is Saba Kumaritashvili\u2019s family business. His great-grandfather is credited with bringing the sport to their homeland, the former Soviet republic of Georgia, more than a half-century ago. His father runs the national federation, as his relatives have for decades.\n\nAt home, his family is synonymous with sliding.\n\nAt the Olympics, his family is synonymous with sadness.\n\nHe qualified for the Beijing Games with hopes of changing that.\n\nIt\u2019s been 12 years since his cousin, Nodar Kumaritashvili, died in a training accident at the Vancouver Games, a death that still haunts the sport, especially so every four years when the Olympics roll around and the memories get rekindled. Nodar was 21 when he would have made his Olympic debut; Saba is 21 now, about to make his Olympic debut.\n\nPut simply, Saba slides for his country. For his family. And for Nodar.\n\n\u201cEvery generation of our family had at least one luge sportsman, and now my father and I are continuing this tradition and following Nodar\u2019s footsteps,\u201d Saba Kumaritashvili said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThinking about him is painful but gives me strength as well.\u201d\n\nIt is that strength that got him here, even while he knows that some in his family are nervous whenever he takes the ice because of what happened to his cousin.\n\nNodar Kumaritashvili was killed Feb. 12, 2010, after losing control of his sled during a training run just hours before the Vancouver Games officially opened. He would have raced the next day, becoming the first in his family to compete on sliding\u2019s biggest stage.\n\nHis cousin now has that chance.\n\n\u201cI am happy and proud that I have opportunity to represent my family and country at these Olympics,\u201d Saba Kumaritashvili said. \u201cNow I feel responsibility to them, because they expect good results from me. It\u2019s really big motivation, so I will try to do my best for them.\u201d\n\nThat is what Nodar Kumaritashvili was trying to do 12 years ago.\n\nThe crash happened at 10:50 a.m. on a Friday, with most people already turning their attention to the opening ceremony taking place that night. The Whistler, Canada, track has 16 curves, and Nodar Kumaritashvili appeared to lose control around the 13th turn. His 176-pound body was no match for the gravitational forces, which sent him careening along the ice-covered walls of the track. The last impact with one of those walls knocked him off his sled and sent him flying across the track, his arms and legs flailing.\n\nHis body sailed over the wall of the track near the finish line, the back of his head striking a metal post outside of the track. Rescue workers got to him within seconds to no avail. He was pronounced dead after 59 minutes of resuscitation efforts, though a coroner\u2019s report later revealed his head injuries were so traumatic that he died instantly.\n\nHis last recorded speed was 89.4 mph (143.9 kph), which almost certainly was the fastest of his career. Some of the world\u2019s best sliders had said that week that the track was too fast and too dangerous; after Nodar Kumaritashvili\u2019s death, Olympic officials made several changes, including having competitors begin from a lower spot on the track in an effort to reduce speeds.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t forget every detail of that day, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Erin Hamlin, a former women\u2019s luge world champion who competed for the U.S. at the Vancouver Games. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think any athlete who raced in Whistler will.\u201d\n\nGerman slider Felix Loch, who won the gold medal in men\u2019s luge at those Olympics, went to Georgia two months later and tearfully presented the Kumaritashvili family with a gold medal of its own \u2014 because Nodar\u2019s death, in Loch\u2019s words, changed the sport. There have been other gifts: paintings, photos, books, even letters from some of the first responders who remain haunted that his life couldn\u2019t be saved. His headstone in Georgia is adorned by a massive bronze sculpture of him on a sled, not far from where his actual sled and the damaged helmet he wore for his last ride are displayed.\n\nSomehow, Saba was never deterred. The family, he decided, had unfinished Olympic business.\n\n\u201cI worked hard and believed in myself strongly,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I feel happy and satisfied that I\u2019ve achieved one of my goals. ... I think every sportsman\u2019s goal and dream is to be competing in the Olympic Games, so two years ago I decided to achieve this goal. And here I am.\u201d\n\nHe is one of nine athletes from Georgia, and the only one from a sliding sport, to qualify for the Beijing Olympics.\n\nThat Saba Kumaritashvili could endure the family anguish and still follow his cousin\u2019s path to an Olympics has drawn admiration from other sliders.\n\n\u201cHe saw through the haze,\u201d said former U.S. luge athlete and Olympian Christian Niccum, who competed in the 2010 games. \u201cIt was a terrible accident. An accident. These things happen in life and it\u2019s awful, but we can either live in fear from it or learn from it, grow from it and keep going. That\u2019s why I think he\u2019s an excellent story.\u201d\n\nThe family\u2019s relationship with luge is believed to go back to at least the early 1970s when Aleko Kumaritashvili \u2014 \u201cmy great-grandfather laid the foundation for this sport,\u201d Saba said \u2014 oversaw the building of a short training track. Soviet officials helped build a more complete track around 1973, and Aleko Kumaritashvili served as the country\u2019s coach.\n\nIt has been part of the family makeup ever since. Saba and Nodar took similar paths to the Olympics; both were introduced to the sport by their family as kids, then got into international sliding and did enough to qualify for the Games despite not having World Cup circuit experience.\n\nSaba insists he is ready.\n\n\u201cI look at his story as what the Olympics are all about,\u201d Niccum said. \u201cIt\u2019s what life is about. It\u2019s what every motivational story there is talks about. It\u2019s perseverance. Forgetting about the past, the fears of the past, the tragedies of the past and looking forward, not living in fear or letting anything slow you down.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/winter-olympics and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"}, {"url": "https://pantheon.world/profile/person/Nodar_Kumaritashvili/", "page_content": "Nodar Kumaritashvili\n\nNodar Kumaritashvili (Georgian: \u10dc\u10dd\u10d3\u10d0\u10e0 \u10e5\u10e3\u10db\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8\u10e2\u10d0\u10e8\u10d5\u10d8\u10da\u10d8; pronounced [n\u0254d\u0251\u027e k\u02b0um\u0251\u027eit\u02bc\u0251\u0283vili]; 25 November 1988 \u2013 12 February 2010) was a Georgian luge athlete who suffered a fatal crash during a training run for the 2010 Winter Olympics competition in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada, on the day of the opening ceremony.

Every four years, the Olympics remind the Kumaritashvili family of the tragedy.\n\n\"My family supports me when they heard that I will participate in the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games. I am very happy to be here,\" Saba told Xinhua in a post-training interview.\n\n\"Every generation of our family had at least one luge sportsman, and now my father and I are continuing this tradition and following Nodar's footsteps. Thinking about him is painful but gives me strength as well,\" the 21-year-old said.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Saba's great grandfather Aleko Kumaritashvili oversaw the construction of Georgia's first luge training track. And then a more complete track a few years later. Aleko then served as the country's head coach. David Kumaritashvili, the father of Nodar, was a seasoned luger who won the USSR youth championship when Georgia was part of the Soviet Union.\n\nSaba's father runs the national luge federation, a job his relatives have held for decades. In Georgia, Kumaritashvili almost stands for luge.\n\nIn Nodar's funeral on February 20, 2010, David Kumaritashvili told Xinhua that Nodar phoned home on the day before his crash and in his opinion, the track in whistler was the toughest track. \"I told him to decelerate by touching the surface of the ice with feet -- but he was angry: 'Don't tell me that. You are a luger, lugers do not tell each other to slow down!'\" said David.\n\nThen the accident shocked the world. \"I would say the worst day was when the Georgian luge athlete (Nodar Kumaritashvili) died in Vancouver. This is the worst moment in my Olympic life,\" said Jacques Rogge, the former IOC president.\n\nThe accident changed the sport. After the accident, the starting point of the luge was moved down to reduce speed and a wooden wall was erected atop the curve where Nodar lost his life.\n\nThe designers of the tracks adjusted their styles, making it harder for athletes to reach the speed around 150kph. In the training session of Beijing 2022, even the legendary athlete Felix Loch can only have the highest speed around 130kph.\n\nThe Kumaritashvili family didn't stop their dreams chasing progress although suffering heavily from the accident, when in Yanqing, Saba is going to slide for his country, his family, and for Nodar.\n\n\"After a very hard season, my mission of getting into the Olympics had been completed.

Already in Vancouver everybody knew they had to change things on the track for the next Sochi Olympics. The run on the track definitely had to be slowed down.\n\nAs a result, Sochi has got a \u2018roller-coaster-like track\u2019 as reported in the New York Times, which runs more than about 10 kilometers per hour slower than the one in 2010.\n\nAt 21 years of age, Kumaritashvili died without fulfilling his ultimate wish \u2013 becoming an Olympic champion.

The track is slower and features three uphill sections, an unprecedented number of hills. The first two were added to reduce speed and the third, near the end of the track, in order to provide a drastic raise where the track curls over itself. The designers made firm brakes where there speeds are expected to reach 160 kilometers per hour.\n\nThe track in Sochi runs slower than one in Vancouver. Photo by James Hill.

Following the tragic accident, the luge competition continued on schedule. Meanwhile before Kumaritashvili\u2019s crash, a number of other athletes had also crashed on the luge course.\n\nCase\u2019s not closed\n\nGeorgia\u2019s Minister of Sport Levan Kipiani said the issue cannot be closed until society has no more questions.\n\n\"Yes there is a report by the experts but on the other hand, changes occured at the Vancouver luge track and the start was made lower as well. Besides this, other athletes were seriously injured at the same track before Nodar\u2019s death. Accordingly, since public interest is high towards this case I would not say the case is closed,\u201d Kipiani said.\n\nThe Kumaritashvili family are a traditional luging family and Nodar\u2019s father David won the USSR Championship three times.

Alavidze\n\nNodar\u2019s father, David Kumaritashvili who is also a former luger, says his family was sure his son was not to blame for the crash and the tragedy was caused by track imperfections. This is the same belief of his daughter, Nodar\u2019s younger sister. She says everybody knows, including the FIL, that Nodar was a professional luger and he would not make such a crucial mistake on the track.\n\n\"If he wasn\u2019t a professional or had a lack of experience he would not have undergone the strict qualification process and become an Olympian,\u201d Mari Kumaritashvili says.\n\nChristian Niccum, an American luger who will compete at his third Olympics in Sochi, told the New York Times: \"It\u2019s such a terrible thing to say it\u2019s his fault; it\u2019s so much easier to say it\u2019s someone else\u2019s fault or the track\u2019s fault. But in the end, he\u2019s the one on that sled.\u201d\n\nCanadian Olympic luger Regan Lauscher wrote an article for the Calgary Herald stating Kumaritashvili\u2019s death was about as probable as \"getting hit by lightning.\"\n\n\"We race our unarmored bodies down ice tracks with no brakes and no mechanism for slowing down. There is no seatbelt and no air bag. ... Hence, we go fast. Extremely fast,\" Lauscher wrote.|/\n\n\"Nodar's crash wasn't out of the ordinary,\" she added.\n\n\"Its fatal consequence was.\"\n\nSvein Romstad, general secretary of the FIL told Associated Press: \"There\u2019s no doubt in my mind he was absolutely qualified.\u201d\n\nKumaritashvili\u2019s family: Life after tragedy\n\nDespite believing their son was not at fault, Kumaritashvili\u2019s family will not file a lawsuit against the FIL. They are sure the Whistler Slide Center\u2019s track in Vancouver had been changed because it was not built correctly.\n\nKumaritashvilis\u2019 family are continuing to grieve their son but are faced with other problems.\n\nBesides financial needs, they are not satisfied with the amount of attention granted by the Municipality to Kumaritashvlis\u2019 grave in his home village Bakuriani, in the Borjomi province. They were promised a luge track would be erected in Kumaritashvili\u2019s name but four years after his death, this has not started.\n\nNodar's grave in Bakuriani. Photo by N. Alavidze.

Khabelov said if Nodar was alive, he most probably would have participated in the Sochi Olympics,so gave his family the official Georgian Olympic outfit for the upcoming Games.\n\nOlympic Committee officials have discussed problematic issues with the Kumaritashvili family, which included a promise to resolve track building issues.\n\nGeorgian Olympic Committee representative Kakha Beridze said at the beginning the parties talked about building a luge track in Kumaritashvili\u2019s name but then it was decided that it would be a sports complex where various sportsmen would be able to train.\n\nHe said the International Olympic Committee had already transferred money for the project but there were some bureaucratic issues to resolve.\n\nKumaritashvili's house in Bakuriani.

Anyway, the decision to build the track is taken,\u201d Kipiani said.\n\nThe Kumaritashvili family stated they were angry because of delaysand not knowing if the track was going to be built or not. They said they were also promised that Nodar\u2019s grave behind the Holy Christmas Church in Bakuriani would be adequately fenced order to keep it well protected but this has not happened. Furthermore, they were told the Olympic Committee would build a museum in Bakuriani which would be named after Kumaritashvili.\n\nBeneath Kumaritashvili\u2019s grave, there is a stone memorial which depicts the late athlete on a luge with Olympic rings above.\n\n\"Yes, Nodar would go to Sochi,\u201d his father said.\n\n\"He was training since he was eight years old and he knew how difficult training for that goal was. The goal is the peak to your training and you devote all your time in your life \u2013 the goal was the Olympic Games.

Every four years, the Olympics remind the Kumaritashvili family of the tragedy.\n\n\"My family supports me when they heard that I will participate in the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games. I am very happy to be here,\" Saba told Xinhua in a post-training interview.\n\n\"Every generation of our family had at least one luge sportsman, and now my father and I are continuing this tradition and following Nodar's footsteps. Thinking about him is painful but gives me strength as well,\" the 21-year-old said.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Saba's great grandfather Aleko Kumaritashvili oversaw the construction of Georgia's first luge training track. And then a more complete track a few years later. Aleko then served as the country's head coach. David Kumaritashvili, the father of Nodar, was a seasoned luger who won the USSR youth championship when Georgia was part of the Soviet Union.\n\nSaba's father runs the national luge federation, a job his relatives have held for decades. In Georgia, Kumaritashvili almost stands for luge.\n\nIn Nodar's funeral on February 20, 2010, David Kumaritashvili told Xinhua that Nodar phoned home on the day before his crash and in his opinion, the track in whistler was the toughest track. \"I told him to decelerate by touching the surface of the ice with feet -- but he was angry: 'Don't tell me that. You are a luger, lugers do not tell each other to slow down!'\" said David.\n\nThen the accident shocked the world. \"I would say the worst day was when the Georgian luge athlete (Nodar Kumaritashvili) died in Vancouver. This is the worst moment in my Olympic life,\" said Jacques Rogge, the former IOC president.\n\nThe accident changed the sport. After the accident, the starting point of the luge was moved down to reduce speed and a wooden wall was erected atop the curve where Nodar lost his life.\n\nThe designers of the tracks adjusted their styles, making it harder for athletes to reach the speed around 150kph. In the training session of Beijing 2022, even the legendary athlete Felix Loch can only have the highest speed around 130kph.\n\nThe Kumaritashvili family didn't stop their dreams chasing progress although suffering heavily from the accident, when in Yanqing, Saba is going to slide for his country, his family, and for Nodar.\n\n\"After a very hard season, my mission of getting into the Olympics had been completed. And think it is a new starting point for me,\" Saba said.\n\n\"My family supports me, they are proud of me,\" the new hope of the family added.

It's Olympic training. It's a tragedy. I can't personally deal with it until after the Games.\"\n\nIf that sounded callous, and it did, then it was surely unintentional; the flustered response of an athlete who is expert in sliding down a hill at ridiculously fast speeds, not media-crisis management in an era of global communications.\n\nBut what excuse does the International Olympic Committee have for sending Benshoof and his colleagues out to answer questions it should be answering itself? Or the International Luge Federation, which after a \"full investigation\" lasting more than 10 minutes but less than 12 hours issued a statement implying that Kumaritashvili's death was all his own fault. \"The technical officials were able to retrace the path of the athlete and concluded there was no indication that the accident was caused by deficiencies in the track,\" the statement read.\n\n\"The track was safe,'' Josef Fendt, the president of ILF, added for good measure \u2013 a statement of so-called fact that was quickly revealed for what it was: the desperate words of an organisation that now faces some serious questions of responsibility and, in due course, culpability.\n\nDawn broke on Saturday to find a temporary wall had been constructed along the left-hand side of the track near the finishing line, where Kumaritashvili had left the track. Bright orange padding had been strapped around the steel columns nearby. \"Wet paint\" read a couple of signs.\n\nAs memorials go, it might kindly be described as less than appropriate. Thank heavens, then, for the venue volunteers and medical services staff who, hidden from public view behind the newly constructed wall, had started their own shrine to the young Georgian.\n\nMeanwhile, the ILF also announced that the start line for the men's event would be moved down the hill to the spot where the women's event was due to begin. So much for the track without deficiencies.\n\nAgainst this uneasy backdrop, with the cowbells clanging and the IOC looking the other way, the 38 left in the men's Olympic luge event did what they had been instructed to do and raced.\n\nThey are a strange breed, stocky in build, brave of character and utterly consumed with thoughts of self, as most people would be who face such obvious danger.\n\n\"I have been siding for 15 years,\" the Canadian slider Jeff Christie said. \"It is in my blood, it is who I am and it is what I choose to do. To get back on the track, that is all I want to do.\"\n\nHis countryman Ian Cockerline was even more bullish. \"I would have liked to see them stick to their guns and go from the men's start,\" he said. \"The Canadian team was rock solid. We were ready to go. We were up at the men's start this morning waiting, and then they started moving benches out of the start-house, and we were like: 'Hey, where are they going with those?'\"\n\nAnother blow stuck for Canada's newly found assertiveness in pursuit of gold; and another blow struck against its reputation as the kindest, gentlest member of the Olympic community.\n\nYet there others who found a sense of perspective in the madness of it all, not least Britain's AJ Rosen. \"Everyone is really upset, which is why we are dedicating this race to him [Kumaritashvili],\" he said after finishing the second of his two qualifying runs.\n\nFor the record, the British luger ended the day placed 16th in a field which was led by Germany's Felix Loch.

I was never fearful about continuing to slide.\n\n\u201cThe track was definitely fast and challenging but it was new and most new tracks are challenging to figure out and come with risk. I enjoyed the track quite a bit.\u201d\n\nQuestions were instantly raised after Nodar\u2019s death about the safety of the track.\n\nThe Whistler course was the fastest track in Olympic history and speeds of 96 miles per hour had been recorded ahead of the Games.\n\nThe 16th curve where Nodar had flown off the track had earned the nickname the \u201cThunderbird\u201d.\n\nDavid revealed that his son had told him just three days before his death that he was \u201cvery scared\u201d of the turn where he flipped off the sled.\n\n\u201cDad, I\u2019m very scared of this spot on the track,\u201d he recalled to ABC News .\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very fast.

She won bronze four years later in Sochi.\n\nShe told The Independent that Nodar\u2019s death did lead to changes in the sport in terms of focusing on safety over speed.\n\n\u201cI think it was a movement where everyone stopped to look at ways we could try to see if it was possible to make the track safer,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t much that could be done other than moving the starts as it was kind of a freak accident.\n\n\u201cBut the trend of just building faster and faster tracks did change.\u201d\n\nNodar\u2019s sled is seen just after the fatal crash. It crossed the finish line moments after he was killed (AP)\n\nFor Saba, he feels he is now ready to represent his family - particularly his cousin - in Beijing.\n\n\u201cI worked hard and believed in myself strongly,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNow I feel happy and satisfied that I\u2019ve achieved one of my goals\u2026 I think every sportsman\u2019s goal and dream is to be competing in the Olympic Games, so two years ago I decided to achieve this goal.
