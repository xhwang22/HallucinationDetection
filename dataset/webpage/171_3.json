Jan Rubes as Nicholas Ballard in Crystal Skull\n\nJan Rubes, best known for his role as an Amish grandfather in Peter Weir\u2019s Witness, gives a gloriously hammy performance as Daniel\u2019s troubled grandfather here. While he never believed Daniel about the pyramids being spaceships, Daniel never believed in his encounter with giant aliens either \u2013 such a bizarre family rift requires some enthusiastic acting and Rubes delivers it. When he is finally reunited with his beloved giant aliens, his joy and wonder is equally heart-warming.\n\n5. Dwight Schultz as The Keeper in The Gamekeeper\n\nAnother Star Trek alumnus \u2013 SG-1 liked to hire Star Trek actors and did so often \u2013 Dwight Schultz\u2019s character here takes all the highly strung aspects of Lt. Barclay, dials them up to eleven, and removes not only the stutter, but any sense of being a decent human being. His villain is both horrifyingly funny and supremely creepy, and watching him disintegrate as his carefully preserved lifestyle is brought down, having seen him subject our heroes to the worst kind of emotional torture, is extremely satisfying.\n\n4. Megan Leitch as Ke\u2019ra/Linea in Past And Present (character played by Bonnie Bartlet in Prisoners)\n\nThere\u2019s a fascinating concept behind Megan Leitch\u2019s Ke\u2019ra \u2013 a character we have met before and known as a ruthless killer (indeed, a Destroyer of Worlds) becomes a completely different person when deprived of her memories. It\u2019s a really interesting philosophical idea, and it requires a nuanced performance from Leitch, in which she must convince as a genuine love interest for Daniel Jackson, but hint at the possibility of a darkness underneath, were circumstances different. Her character has been a mass murderer, but without the memories that made her that way, she becomes a person willing to sacrifice her memories, to avoid going down that path again. It\u2019s a tricky job, and Leitch pulls it off nicely.\n\n3. Keene Curtis as Ernest Littlefield in The Torment Of Tantalus (character as a young man played by Paul McGillion)\n\nThe part of Ernest Littlefield in The Torment Of Tantalus is a really juicy one for an actor \u2013 stranded for 50 years without human company, separated from his fianc\u00e9e, then reunited with her but still unable to grasp the answers he\u2019s looking for, it\u2019s the sort of role an actor can really get their teeth into. Keene Curtis does not waste the opportunity \u2013 his Ernest is equal parts weary, disillusioned, hopeful, romantic and emotional isolated, and thanks to him, the high concept of the episode works so well you won\u2019t even wonder how his was able to refill his pens to keep his journal.\n\n2. Dom DeLuise as Urgo in Urgo\n\nDom De Luise plays himself \u2013 but then, who could do it better? DeLuise\u2019s son, Peter DeLuise, was a writer, director and producer on SG-1, so it\u2019s no wonder that he took advantage of his famous comedic actor father and featured him in the show (his two brothers also made smaller guest appearances). Urgo is an episode built entirely around DeLuise\u2019s character, who literally gets into SG-1\u2019s heads, and metaphorically into those of the audience as well. Comedy episodes were always a relative strength of SG-1, and this is one of the best and fondest-remembered, not so much for its plot, but for the joy of watching DeLuise\u2019s performance.\n\n1. Robin Mossley as Malikai in Window Of Opportunity\n\nWindow Of Opportunity is one of the most beloved episodes in the entire Stargate franchise, and a serious contender for the best SG-1 episode overall. For the most part, its beloved because its a glorious comedy episode, featuring fruit loops, playing golf through the Stargate, Teal\u2019c being hit in the face by a door and Jack trying to learn Latin. However, what raises it above SG-1\u2019s other excellent comedy episodes is the climax. Suddenly, the episode turns on its head and becomes about grief and loss, and the lengths to which we might go just to see a loved one again, even knowing we couldn\u2019t save them."}, {"url": "https://www.gateworld.net/news/2005/12/tom-butler-recalls-outer-limits-sg-1/", "page_content": "With almost 30 years of film and television work behind him,has become a well-known face to science fiction watchers. His credits include, and. With the release of The Outer Limits Season One on DVD, GateWorld got a chance to talk with Butler and discuss both that show and his guest appearances on\n\nThose who have not seen the reimagined The Outer Limits have missed a special treat. The series ran for seven years and sported a plethora of wild, often ground-breaking stories. Tom was there for the second episode of the new series, \u201cValerie 23,\u201d right when things were just getting started. When he played the same character in the sequel episode \u201cMary 25\u201d (Season Four), he co-starred with Michael Shanks (\u201cDaniel Jackson\u201d).\n\n\n\nIn The Outer Limits,Charlie Rogers (Butler) attempts to convince Frank Hellner (William Sadler) to bring the Valerie 23 android into his home.\n\n\u201cThe crew was very enthusiastic,\u201d he told GateWorld. \u201cFor them, when you\u2019re doing a series it has a crew. You\u2019re in there for 23 episodes. So the fact that they got a new cast and a new story every week was thrilling to them. A lot of those guys were young, and we\u2019re talking almost ten years ago. I bump into them now and then working on other shows and they\u2019ve all moved up through positions and they\u2019re still enthusiastic about it. They still talk about it.\n\n\u201cFor me, I\u2019m a very fortunate person. I get paid for playing, and working with very beautiful women, too. It was marvelous. It\u2019s a good bunch of guys to work with. I did five episodes of The Outer Limits. Sometimes they get mixed up.\u201d\n\nSG-1 fans will remember Butler as General Trofsky, the dubious villain who eventually revealed himself to be one of Hathor\u2019s goons after posing as a U.S. military officer from the future.\n\n\u201cYou know what\u2019s fun? It\u2019s trying to fool the audience,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWe were trying to trick Richard Dean Anderson into thinking that he was in safe hands and that we were going to look after him. You don\u2019t want to give that away to the audience. That\u2019s always fun. And it\u2019s fun being on set with Richard Dean Anderson. There\u2019s a case where they\u2019ve been together for such a long time and they still love him.\n\n\u201cOh, man, and then getting dressed up into costume where I\u2019m not me anymore! There was one scene where I came around the corner and the S.G. guys were there with their guns, and they opened fire at me. I could feel the shockwaves from the blank cartridges. I could feel the heat. I had earplugs in. I was yelling at the top of my lungs but I couldn\u2019t hear myself! I was thinking, \u2018If I was in a real battle I\u2019d be running so fast!'\u201d\n\n\n\nIn \u201cOut Of Mind\u201d, Trofsky poses as the future General in charge of the S.G.C.\n\nEven seven years since, Tom is reminded of how easy it was to act on the Stargate sets. \u201cAs an actor you don\u2019t have to act when you\u2019ve got all that stuff going on for you,\u201d he said. \u201cThey supply this reality for you. You just have to exist within that reality, and it\u2019s wonderful. There are times when you have to pretend \u2014 it\u2019s your close-up and there\u2019s nothing there to look at. But on that set it\u2019s just wonderful.\u201d\n\nOn-location shots are no different. \u201cWhen we went out do the exteriors, where we had the gate set up [in a] barren, desolate area \u2014 it\u2019s a lot of fun.

He coined the phrase \u2018Generation X.\u2019 It\u2019s a light romantic comedy. I play the father of the main character. He\u2019s going through his existential difficulties.

I play the head military officer in the White House. We\u2019re in the dark trying to figure out what\u2019s happening. It wasn\u2019t so bad for me, but for the people who played the characters on the plane \u2014 they said it was quite a cathartic movie for them to do. And also the women, a lot of the people had cell phones and they realized what was happening, getting information back. People on the ground, wives, mothers. For them it was pretty heavy-duty.

Much of the series' eventual success was due to the efforts of the producers, including creators Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright, and star Richard Dean Anderson, who played Colonel Jack O'Neill, the no-nonsense leader of SG-1 \u2014 an Air Force special forces team that uses stargate technology to traverse the galaxy and defend Earth against various alien races.

The versatile crew of actors maintained a solid balance between action, drama, and occasional forays into self-referential humor. Their work was buttressed by a strong and diverse cast of supporting players and guest stars.

The show centers around a four-person military team that travels to other planets through an alien device called the Stargate, which is the public transportation system of the stars \u2014 you dial up a planet, it opens a portal, and you hop through to the other side in seconds. Like the film, Stargate SG-1 became a cult classic, lasting ten seasons and spawning two additional movies, as well as another spinoff series (Stargate Atlantis). Years later, fans still want more.\n\nWhat made Stargate SG-1 so popular? Well, it certainly did an amazing job of world-building, combining elements of ancient Earth cultures with technologically advanced aliens. It also had a way of perfectly balancing action, humor, and profound messages. But one of the essential ingredients to Stargate SG-1's success is the talented cast that brought these rich characters to life on the screen. Who can forget Christopher Judge's facial expression when playing the passionate warrior Teal'c? Or Amanda Tapping's performance as Samantha Carter, the scientist who can hold her own in combat?\n\nA lot of time has passed since Stargate SG-1 ended in 2007. Like most fans, you're probably wondering what happened to these actors after their days at Stargate Command. Here's what they're up to today."}, {"url": "https://www.looper.com/251508/what-the-cast-of-stargate-atlantis-is-doing-today/", "page_content": "What The Cast Of Stargate: Atlantis Is Doing Today\n\nThe 1994 sci-fi film Stargate kicked off a franchise that would keep fans glued to their seats for decades. Stargate Atlantis was developed as a spin-off of Stargate SG-1. The series followed the events that occurred after the crew of SG-1 located an outpost in Antarctica that was actually built by an alien species called the \"Ancients.\" When the mysterious city of Atlantis, another creation of the Ancients, is subsequently discovered, Stargate Command sends in a crew to explore it \u2014 and thus, Stargate Atlantis was born.\n\nBut this spin-off had its own unique appeal. It was followed up by the premiere of a new series, Stargate Universe, yet this iteration didn't prove to be quite as successful. It's been a little over a decade since the series finale of Atlantis aired, and fans still remember this show fondly. From writing screenplays to directing films to working as stunt doubles, the cast members have all taken their careers in interesting directions. Here's how your favorite actors have fared since saying goodbye to Stargate Atlantis."}, {"url": "https://www.gateworld.net/news/2022/04/why-almost-every-stargate-sg1-cast-member-written-out/", "page_content": "STARGATE HISTORY: During its 10-season run Stargate SG-1 bid farewell to every single member of its original cast ... except for one actor.\n\nStargate SG-1: \"Meridian\"\n\nIt\u2019s only natural on a long-running franchise: cast members decide they\u2019re done with the show before the show is over. Whether they\u2019re moving on to new opportunities, ready to retire from show business, or are driven away by conflict on the set, there are moments in the life of a hit show where the actor leaves \u2026 but the show must go on.\n\nAnd so the characters we\u2019ve come to know and love set out for greener pastures. Or they\u2019re recast with another actor. Or, worst case scenario, they get killed off.\n\nStargate SG-1 was no exception. Running for 10 years across both Showtime and the SCI FI Channel in the United States, the series saw its fair share of cast changes over the years. In each case the writers had to think creatively to write the character out of the show \u2013 and in a few cases to bring them back again later.\n\nIn fact, every single member of the show\u2019s original cast ended up written out at one time or another \u2026 everyone, that is, except for one. Let\u2019s round up when and why the writers wrote out each member of the original cast, as well as a couple of honorable mentions along the way.\n\nWatch the full video from GateWorld\u2019s YouTube channel right here, or continue reading below.\n\nIf you are new to Stargate, watch out for SPOILERS below!\n\nSubscribe to GateWorld on\n\nThe fifth year of Stargate SG-1 signaled a turning point for the show. After five successful seasons Showtime decided it had had enough, and wouldn\u2019t be bringing the show back for a sixth.\n\nCanadian actor Michael Shanks had taken on the role of archaeologist and linguist Dr. Daniel Jackson, played by James Spader in the Stargate feature film. And though he started out with a spot-on impression of Spader\u2019s Jackson, over the years Shanks made the character his own. Daniel got a haircut and hit the gym, learned to use military weapons, and started taking antihistamines for those allergies.\n\nBy Season Five he was a real action hero.\n\nIt was at this point that Shanks decided to move on with his career. He was looking to try other things, and also not shy about the fact that he felt the show\u2019s writers as of late hadn\u2019t been giving Daniel a lot of distinctively \u201cDaniel\u201d things to do. Maybe he\u2019d reached the end of where this character was going.\n\nThe end of the series on Showtime felt like a natural time to move on. MGM, though, wasn\u2019t ready to let the show go just yet. They convinced SCI FI Channel to pick up Stargate SG-1 for a sixth season.\n\nTaking Daniel\u2019s place on the team would be the eager and enthusiastic Kelownan Jonas Quinn, played by actor Corin Nemec. Jonas was introduced in the episode that saw Shanks written out: Season Five\u2019s penultimate story \u201cMeridian.\u201d After SG-1 finds a planet experimenting with a highly volatile variation of naquadah, Daniel exposes himself to a lethal dose of radiation in order to prevent an explosion and saves the Kelownans from their own hubris.\n\nBack in the S.G.C. infirmary each member of the team says goodbye to their friend, as he slowly wastes away. It looks to be a grisly end for the person who is the heart of the SG-1 team, until the ascended being Oma Desala turns up and offers to help Daniel ascend to a higher plane of existence. In the end he voluntarily chooses to go, asking the team to stop trying to save his body so that his spirit can move on.\n\nDaniel\u2019s journey was just beginning. And after numerous guest appearances in Season Six, Michael Shanks was back on the call sheet full time in Season Seven. Which brings us to our next departure from the cast \u2026\n\nJonas was the young guy coming onto the team to take Daniel\u2019s place, but at the age of 31 Corin Nemec was already a veteran actor with dozens of credits to his name. He played Mr. Papadapolis\u2019s nephew Nicky on Webster, before landing the title role in the FOX comedy Parker Lewis Can\u2019t Lose. And he played Harold Lauder in the 1994 Stephen King miniseries The Stand.\n\nNemec had the unenviable role of stepping into the shoes of a beloved character on a popular TV series. While he was no Daniel Jackson, the show\u2019s writers made every effort to make Jonas likeable. He studied Dr. Jackson\u2019s journals and read every mission report, and had a photographic memory. He was affable and curious, and didn\u2019t just fall into his place on the team but had to earn the respect of his teammates \u2026 especially Colonel Jack O\u2019Neill.\n\nJonas grew over the course of the season, as fans got to know the character. But when the show was renewed for a seventh season, producers extended an olive branch and invited Shanks back. He agreed. That meant there wasn\u2019t space on the team for two characters who essentially provided the same function to the story (let alone room in the budget for another salary). After one year on the show, Nemec\u2019s contract was not renewed.\n\nJonas and Daniel did get a great team-up in the opening two-parter, \u201cFallen\u201d and \u201cHomecoming,\u201d as Daniel returned to his mortal form and Anubis moved to seize control of Jonas\u2019 home planet. After Anubis\u2019 ship is destroyed and the villain is sent running, Jonas returned home \u2013 it seemed somewhat reluctantly \u2013 to help his people to rebuild and unite with their rival nations.\n\nCorin Nemec would return later in the season with \u201cFallout,\u201d as SG-1 checked in on Jonas and Kelowna. It would have been great to see more of the character, even perhaps to spin him off to Stargate Atlantis when that show started a few months later.\n\nTechnically, actress Teryl Rothery was never a part of SG-1\u2019s main cast. But she was so essential to the core of the show that she deserves an honorable mention here. Rothery wasn\u2019t in the main credits, but was a frequent guest star \u2013 introduced early on in the show\u2019s first season. As Stargate Command\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr. Fraiser appeared in around half of the episodes in a typical season.\n\nAs the show began production on Season Seven, the writers had every intention of this being the show\u2019s last year. A plan was already forming for an SG-1 feature film about the discovery of the lost city of the Ancients, which would set the stage for a spin-off: Stargate Atlantis. (This story eventually became the 2-hour finale, \u201cLost City.\u201d)\n\nThe fact that the show was only going to continue for a handful of episodes beyond the fateful two-parter \u201cHeroes\u201d is cold comfort, though. Somewhere between network executives at SCI FI, and writer-producer Robert C. Cooper, the decision was made to kill off a key member of the team. This served a dramatic purpose for \u201cHeroes,\u201d a M.A.S.H.-inspired look at the dangers and sacrifices of military service from the vantage point of an outside camera crew.\n\nCooper was convinced that, in order to have its desired emotional impact, the episode needed a death that mattered to the audience. A guest star or supporting player wouldn\u2019t do. The lot fell to Dr. Fraiser, who is killed by a Jaffa staff blast while providing aide to a fallen soldier in the field of battle. Truly a hero\u2019s death.\n\nRothery was understandably disappointed to be written off, and other members of the cast \u2013 who by now had become like family to her \u2013 were sometimes vocal in their disappointment over the decision. But it did make \u201cHeroes\u201d an indisputably powerful two episodes of television, one that many of the show\u2019s cast and crew cite as their favorite episode of the series.\n\nBy the end of the seventh season, though, Stargate\u2018s cast and crew heard the news: the network wanted them to come back for yet another year anyway. As the series headed into an eighth season, the role of the base\u2019s chief physician would have to be recast.\n\nDon Davis was a natural father figure for every member of the SG-1 team. General Hammond was on the verge of retirement when asked to take charge of the new Stargate program, and for seven years he brought his courage, strength, and wisdom to this front-line command.\n\nDavis had previously worked with Richard Dean Anderson on the set of MacGyver, where he was a stunt double for series co-star Dana Elcar. He also sometimes appeared on screen in minor roles. In his screen career Davis frequently played strong military figures, including Major Garland Briggs on Twin Peaks and Dana Scully\u2019s father on The X-Files.\n\nGeneral Hammond\u2019s exit from Stargate Command felt organic to the story, if somewhat abrupt. A new president was elected, and after learning the astonishing truth about the Stargate program he set about taking stock of what it was and what it ought to be doing.\n\nAlthough the Air Force would continue to serve at Stargate Command, President Hayes put a civilian in charge: Dr. Elizabeth Weir, a diplomat with experiencing bringing different nations to the table in common cause.\n\nThe President recognized General Hammond\u2019s service and his ability, though, and gave him a new mission. After sending good men and women out into the field to risk their lives every day, Hammond himself got to take on a task vital to Earth\u2019s survival. With Anubis\u2019 fleet bearing down on Earth, he took command of Prometheus \u2013 Earth\u2019s most advanced ship. He and the crew engaged the enemy during the Battle of Antarctica, risking their lives to protect SG-1 while the team uncovered an Ancient weapon buried under the ice.\n\nAfter his heroics Hammond would not return to the S.G.C. Actor Don S. Davis was forced to reduce his workload due to ongoing health concerns. He made several return appearances in later years, commanding Prometheus again in \u201cPrometheus Unbound,\u201d giving a speech for the Air Force in \u201cThe Fourth Horseman,\u201d and playing an alien version of General Hammond on Stargate Atlantis (\u201cHome\u201d). He even voiced Puppet Hammond in SG-1\u2019s two-hundredth episode.\n\nDon Davis\u2019s final appearance on Stargate came in the 2008 movie Stargate: Continuum. He passed away in June of that year of a heart attack, at the young age of 65. Stargate paid him a final tribute by naming a ship for him \u2013 the U.S.S. George Hammond, commanded by Colonel Samantha Carter.\n\nRichard Dean Anderson | \u201cJack O\u2019Neill\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not a stretch to say that Stargate SG-1 became the hit that it was in large part due to its leading man. Already a household name as TV\u2019s Angus MacGyver, Richard Dean Anderson took over from Kurt Russell and made Colonel Jack O\u2019Neill a deep and complex character, whose humor and wit concealed a deep and personal family trauma.\n\nAnderson gave his all to the series for five long years, helping to establish Stargate as a top-tier science fiction series and a pillar of the Vancouver film and television community. In the second year of the show he and his partner welcomed a daughter, Wylie. (That\u2019s why Jack is sidelined at the start of the episode \u201cSpirits.\u201d Anderson got a few days off from filming.)\n\nIn Season Six the actor agreed to stay on for another year, to help the cast and crew transition to the SCI FI Channel. But he wanted more time at home with his family in California, and so his deal included more days off. As a result Jack was sidelined several times this season, and even written out of one episode entirely (he\u2019s off with the Tok\u2019ra during the events of \u201cNightwalkers\u201d).\n\nThis lightened workload continued into Season Seven, when Anderson agreed to sign on for another year.\n\nHis promotion to command the base in Season Eight was also part of the strategy to keep the actor around for just one more year. The newly promoted General O\u2019Neill would take over for Hammond, sending the team on missions \u2026 but rarely going off-world himself. That kept the beloved actor and character on the show, but gave Anderson far fewer shooting days to spend in Canada.\n\nBy the end of the eighth season Anderson was ready to bid the show farewell, so that he could be at home to help raise his now 6-year-old daughter. In-story, General O\u2019Neill was off to Washington to take charge of Homeworld Command. But Anderson would be back for numerous guest appearances on SG-1, Atlantis, and to help launch Stargate Universe.\n\nAlthough today she\u2019s known as a prolific Canadian director, Amanda Tapping is synonymous with the character she played on Stargate for more than 12 years.\n\nShe was a main cast member on SG-1 for all ten seasons, after which she joined her cast mates in two movies \u2013 Stargate: The Ark of Truth and Stargate: Continuum. When SG-1 ended and Tapping still had one year left on her contract with MGM, she even crossed over to take charge of Atlantis as a full-time cast member during that show\u2019s fourth season. (After that she leapt over to Sanctuary, to headline and executive produce her own fantasy series.)\n\nSo if Amanda Tapping was a part of the Stargate television franchise from the very start to the very end, what\u2019s she doing on our list? Colonel Samantha Carter had taken command of SG-1 back in its eighth season \u2026 but then, the writers were faced with the prospect of temporarily writing her out for the first five episodes of Season Nine.\n\nTapping and her husband had a child during the break between filming, and she received some well-earned maternity leave. As the season begins SG-1 has disbanded, with Jack off to Washington, Teal\u2019c helping to establish the new Free Jaffa Nation, and Daniel getting ready to finally visit Atlantis. Colonel Carter has taken a new assignment with Area 51, leading Stargate\u2019s research and development.\n\nShe has a short video chat with Cameron Mitchell soon after he arrives at Stargate Command, hoping to lead SG-1 (and not rebuild a team from scratch). She also appears in a brief flashback when Cameron was in the hospital a year earlier. But otherwise Carter is gone for the first five episodes of the season. Claudia Black was brought in for an arc to replace her on a temporary basis, reprising her role of the thief Vala Mal Doran.\n\nFortunately, Tapping was written out of Stargate only temporarily. By the time we get to \u201cBeachhead\u201d and the Ori are trying to invade our galaxy, Sam is back to help save the day.\n\nSo who\u2019s the only member of Stargate SG-1\u2019s original cast who never had to be written out? Of course it\u2019s Christopher Judge, who played the stoic Jaffa warrior Teal\u2019c day in and day out for 11 years.\n\nJudge appeared as a regular throughout all ten seasons of the television series, plus the two SG-1 movies. He also made a couple of guest appearances on Stargate Atlantis. The first was a single scene in \u201cReunion,\u201d as Teal\u2019c gives Colonel Carter a pep talk and says goodbye before she travels to Atlantis.\n\nIn the second, Teal\u2019c has a very memorable match-up with Jason Momoa\u2019s Ronon Dex in the episode \u201cMidway.\u201d Here Teal\u2019c has been sent to Atlantis to help Ronon prepare for his interview with the I.O.A., which could affect his ability to continue to serve on John Sheppard\u2019s team. When the two travel back to Earth via the new Midway space station, they run afoul of a Wraith invasion.\n\nWhich cast departure hit you the hardest?

A cause of death was not immediately reported for the actor. He was 47 at the time of his passing.\n\nThe news of Kirby Morrow\u2019s death was originally announced by his brother, Casey, in a Facebook post (via GateWorld). In the sweet message, Morrow celebrated his late brother\u2019s work and stressed how it was the fans that motivated him to do the best possible work that he could:\n\nKirby was a blessed and talented individual who brought joy to so many but also thrived off all your love and friendship. He lived for it and it fueled him every day.\n\nOn the small screen, Morrow, a Canada native, was best known to the Stargate community for his role on Stargate Atlantis in which he played the recurring role of Captain Dave Kleinman, the weapons officer on the bridge of the U.S.S. Daedalus. The character would also make a 2009 appearance on Stargate Universe. And before he took on the role of Kleinman, he also had smaller roles on Stargate: SG-1.\n\nMorrow is also known to Hallmark fans for his role in 2013\u2019s A Ring by Spring. In the rom-com, he plays the role of Tom, the love interest of Rachel Boston\u2019s Caryn.\n\nThroughout his lengthy career, Kirby Morrow made appearances on numerous shows, ranging from Hallmark\u2019s When Calls the Heart to ABC\u2019s The Good Doctor. He was especially a fixture in sci-fi, horror and superhero shows, with credits in Arrow, The Flash, Legion, Supernatural and Fringe, among others.\n\nAside from his roles in the live-action realm, Kirby Morrow became a prolific force within the realm of voice acting. Morrow famously lent his voice to the role of Goku on Dragon Ball Z for several years, and he also voiced Miroku on Inuyasha. His other notable anime roles come in massive franchise like Gundam and Death Note.\n\nAnime was only one aspect of his voice acting career, as he has credits in a variety of other animated shows. He voiced Scott Summers/Cyclops in X-Men: Evolution. He also lent his voice to the character of Anakin Skywalker in a few LEGO Star Wars animated TV specials. His most famous role, however, is arguably that of Cole (the black ninja) on LEGO\u2019s Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu. The actor is credited for 97 episodes, making Cole one of the longest-running characters in his career.\n\nIt's not often that someone amasses as many acting credits as Kirby Morrow, and it's even rarer that someone can have such an impact on a medium. His body of work, especially in voice acting, is nothing short of incredible and, as someone who\u2019s enjoyed many of his projects, I can definitely say that his wide-ranging talent will be sorely missed.\n\nWe here at CinemaBlend extend our condolences to the family and friends of Kirby Morrow during this time."}]}
