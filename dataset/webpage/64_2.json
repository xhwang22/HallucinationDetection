Now it is time for me to take a pause and devote my life to things that only I can do. I have therefore come to this conclusion (to retire from acting and TV),\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe statement further denied the accuracy of an article appearing in the Tuesday issue of a weekly magazine which speculates that Esumi, who has been married for 14 years -- her second marriage -- is involved in an extramarital affair with a man she meets frequently.\n\n\u201cI am not involved in an affair. The man described as my partner in the upcoming article is a business associate,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are preparing to take legal measures (against the magazine), which is reporting something that is absolutely not true.\u201d\n\nThe message also confirmed that Esumi and her husband, director Shin Hirano, live apart, but that this is only \u201cdue to work and lifestyle preferences.\" She denied any plans for a divorce. The couple have two children, a boy and a girl.\n\nEsumi is mostly popular for her role as a mini-skirted \u201coffice lady\u201d in the Fuji TV series \u201cShomuni,\u201d which became a huge hit in the late 1990s. She has starred in seven movies and has appeared in a number of TV dramas and popular variety programs. Esumi is also a winner of 14 showbiz and acting awards, including a \u201cBest Mother Award\u201d in 2010.\n\nIn 2014, the actress became indirectly involved in a major scandal caused by her then-manager, who was caught spraying \u201cidiot\u201d and \u201cstupid son\u201d graffiti on the newly built house of former baseball star and actor Kazushige Nagashima. A number of tabloids reported that Esumi had ordered the manager to commit the vandalism, but it was later revealed that she herself learned of the incident through the media and was not involved. The manager later apologized to Esumi for his actions.\n\nFans were quick to react to Esumi\u2019s retirement, with most of them saying that they regret to see her leaving.\u201dShe has been one of the few TV personalities who say things as they are without faking it just to be liked.

After graduating from high school, she signed with the Japan Tobacco Women's Volleyball team (now the JT Marvelous in the V.League). She was injured in 1989 while playing and decided to pursue a career in show business after watching actress and singer Miki Imai on television while recovering in the hospital. She then focused on a career as a fashion model.\n\nIn 1995, Esumi made her acting debut as Yumiko in Maborosi, a film directed by Hirokazu Koreeda. Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle gave her acting high praise, describing it as \"extraordinary\" and stating she played the role with \"delicacy and physical grace\". Esumi won the Rookie of the Year Award at both the 19th Annual Japan Academy Prize ceremonies and at the 38th Blue Ribbon Awards for her role in Maborosi. Esumi married photographer Rowland Kirishima in February 1996, though they divorced only nine months later.\n\nShe is probably best known for her leading role as the rebellious office lady Tsuboi Chinatsu in the Shomuni series of TV dramas, the first of which aired on Fuji TV from April to July 1998. A second series aired from April to June 2000, with a third airing from July to September 2002. Several specials were also produced. Esumi made her singing debut on 26 April 2000 with the release of her One Way Drive single. The title song was used as the ending theme to the second Shomuni series, with the lyrics by Esumi and the music by guitarist Tomoyasu Hotei.\n\nEsumi was described as \"stunning\" in her lead role of Stray Cat in the 2001 Pistol Opera, one of Seijun Suzuki last films.\n\nShe was nominated in 2002 for the Best Actress Award at the 26th Annual Japan Academy Prize ceremonies for her role in Inochi.\n\nEsumi and Fuji TV director Shin Hirano were married in 2003. That same year, she began appearing in Japanese government television and print advertisements encouraging the public to make their pension contributions, but started a small scandal in 2004 when it was reported that she was not making those same pension contributions herself. She stated that she thought she had been making the payments, and then corrected the issue by becoming current on her contributions. Esumi's image was removed from the ads at the direction of the Social Insurance Agency after the scandal broke.\n\nHer eldest daughter was born in February 2005, and a second daughter was announced in July 2009 as due to be born in December. Esumi wrote a personal note about this announcement which her talent agency subsequently published on their site.\n\nIn a 20 May 2007 article in the Asahi Shimbun, Esumi revealed that her younger brother had died at the age of 36 the previous May of complications due to cancer."}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/filmosearch/?role=nm0261968&sort=moviemeter", "page_content": "69 min | Comedy, Drama\n\nRate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 - / 10 X\n\nManpan is hit by financial scandal and Maekawa is called to HQ in New York.

Rashomon (1950), Gate of Hell (1953) and Samurai, the Legend of Musashi (1954) received honorary awards before the category\u2019s official introduction in 1956, and Spirited Away won best animated feature in 2003. But Departures was the first.\n\nIts win on Feb. 22, 2009, marked a major upset. The favorites that year were Israel\u2019s Waltz With Bashir, a documentary-animation hybrid (not unlike this year\u2019s Flee), and France\u2019s The Class, about a Parisian middle-school teacher. Departures, meanwhile, followed an unemployed cellist who answers what he thinks is a job listing for a travel agency \u2014 but turns out to be a mortician gig that requires him to prep bodies for cremation. The position makes him something of a social outcast, but he finds that he actually loves it.\n\nThe idea for Departures came from its star, Masahiro Motoki, who on a trip to India in the 1990s was struck by a funeral ceremony on the Ganges River. The film ultimately took a decade to make, partly because the taboo subject matter turned off potential producers. Director Yojiro Takita, who cut his teeth in Japan\u2019s \u201cpinku eiga\u201d soft-core scene before going mainstream with Comic Magazine (1986), boarded the project in 2006.\n\nThe film had trouble finding distribution until it won the grand prize at the Montreal World Film Festival, leading it to open on 31 screens in Japan. After its Oscar upset, however, Departures expanded to 180 screens, eventually earning $60 million at Japan\u2019s box office, making it the country\u2019s highest-grossing domestic release that year.\n\nIn the Oscar press room immediately following the win, a shell-shocked Motoki \u2014 who studied cello and funeral rites for the role \u2014 told reporters: \u201cI walked the red carpet as a hanger-on who just observes the ceremony. Now I regret that I did not walk with more confidence.\u201d\n\nThis story first appeared in a January stand-alone issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

He plays Daigo Kobayashi, a young cello player who faces the end of his chosen career when the Tokyo symphony orchestra he is part of is dissolved by its owner. He doesn't think he has the talent to get into another orchestra so he sells his expensive cello (which he's still paying for) and moves back to his town in the country. His wife Mika (Ryoko Hirosue) assents to this with brave smiles. There's a house there for them that his mother left him.\n\n\n\nAnd then comes the job. Daigo answers an ad that's promising. \"Departures,\" it says. He assumes something in travel. Easy hours, good pay. The boss hires him immediately and gives him a wad of bills. Only trouble: the work is \"encoffination,\" or putting dead people into caskets for cremation. (\"Departures\" was a misprint for \"Departed.\") This is where Motoki gets to make funny faces as he struggles with surprise, discomfort, and out and out nausea. The first corpse his boss Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki) takes him along to work on is an elderly lady who was dead two weeks before she was found, and it's summertime. After this ordeal he can't face dinner without retching. He hides from his wife what he is doing. But the pay is good and the boss is a decent man and he needs work so he stays on.\n\n\n\nIn professional lingo Moviefone calls this movie \"a feel-good dramady about death.\" Younger people, already sick of the Academy's easy Oscar choices, mocked its members for giving the Best Foreign prize this year to 'Departures' over the edgy Israeli animation about war trauma, 'Waltz with Bashir.' Yes, 'Departures' is softer; but it has depths and its subject is universal. I'd listen to the octogenarian wisdom of the veteran New York critic Andrew Sarris, who calls this \"the most moving film I have ever seen commemorating the bonds between the living and the dead.\"\n\n\n\nIt's also a lesson in the beauty of Japanese tradition that expresses those bonds. Not so long ago, as Sasaki explains to Daigo, Japanese families prepared their own departed. Now the funeral agents and the casket preparers (Sasaki is the latter) have moved in. But the process still retains traditional honesty and grace. In a process both elegantly respectful and forthright, the body is prepared in front of the assembled family mourners by the funeral professionals. (Sasaki turns out to be a very good one.) In a series of graceful gestures. the body is wiped and cleaned, undressed, turned, and re-clothed, the face caressed, the hands smoothed and placed together just so, all with the deftness of motion that is the Japanese genius, and always discretely shielding the flesh of the deceased from the view of the watchers. Then, well wrapped, the body is gently laid in the casket. The mourners may come forward and say their goodbyes before the box is closed. Shortly thereafter it is taken to a crematorium. Daigo quickly masters the respectful drama of this process, particularly the way the face and hands are manipulated and the clothing is moved, and comes to appreciate the profound emotional meaning it has for the mourners. It's both a leave-taking of the person and an acknowledgment that the deceased is really already gone. Of course immensely complex feelings are involved. Daigo settles into the work. Nonetheless he continues to hide from Mika what he's doing.\n\n\n\nWhen she finds out, she goes home to her mother, promising to return only when Daigo quits the job. But the way he enjoys playing his small but tuneful childhood cello again now shows he accepts his new circumstances and is not unhappy. Daigo's roots in the town are symbolized by the old bath house where he goes to cleanse himself after the dressing of the decomposing old lady on his first days's work. It is run by another old lady, Tsuyako (Kazuko Yoshiyuki), the mother of his former best friend. When she suddenly drops dead and Mika returns for the encoffination ceremony, she realizes the beauty and importance of the ritual Daigo performs for Tsuyako's family. Daigo's father ran a caf\u00e9 in their house and went off with a young waitress when he was a boy, abandoning him and his mother. He hates his father and doesn't want to know anything about him. But when by chance -- or more accurately screenwriter Kundo Koyama's obvious arrangement -- he learns about his father's death, Mika pushes him to go and do the ceremony himself, with her at his side, and this time the ritual is a profound personal healing process for Daigo himself, whose tears pour down as he performs it. When a few months pass and winter comes Mika comes back to live with Diago after she discovers she's pregnant, even though she still wants him to quit the job. The film underlines how humble and traditional roles are essential to a society, even as it looks down on them, by showing the dignity of the encoffination process; of the man who handles the cremations; of old Tsuyako running the comfortable old bath house that her son wanted to close and turn into more profitable real estate.\n\n\n\nThis film is a tribute to the magic and comfort of human ritual. Hence the encoffination process is shown repeatedly, even behind the end credits. It's what the film is about: everything else is footnotes to this ceremony. Sometimes the mourners make it tumultuous, embarrassing, or comic. But it retains the beauty of a culture that knows the value of theater. Takita's movie is more than the sum of its sometimes sentimental or obvious parts. In the beauty of its most humdrum moments, with its focus on everyday family necessities (it celebrates food too), 'Departures' is not at all remote from the quintessentially Japanese quotidian grandeur celebrated in the film masterpieces of Yasajiro Ozu."}, {"url": "https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-departures-2009", "page_content": "I showed Yojiro Takita's film at Ebertfest 2010, and it had as great an impact as any film in the festival's history. At the end the audience rose as one person. Many standing ovations are perfunctory. This one was long, loud and passionate. That alone doesn't have anything to do with making a film great, and 2011 may seem too soon to include a 2009 film in this collection of Great Movies. I'm including it because having seen in three times I am convinced that \"Departures\" will hold its power and appeal.\n\nThe Japanese cinema reserves a special place for death. In films like Kurosawa's \"Ikiru,\" Ozu's \"Tokyo Story,\" Itami's \"Ososhiki\" (\"The Funeral\") and Kore Eda's \"Maborosi\" and \"After Life,\" it is handled in terms of ongoing life. There is mourning, but not hopeless grief. The mourning is channeled into ritual which provides comfort. There is no great focus on an afterlife. Attention centers on the survivors and on the meaning of the life that has just ended. Watching \"Departures\" again most recently, I was reminded of these words spoken in Errol Morris's \"Gates of Heaven:\" Life is for the living and not for the dead so much.\n\nThe hero of \"Departures\" is Daigo (Masahiro Motoki), an impulsive young man, likable, easy to read. His wife Mika (Ryoko Hirosue) loves him and believes in him. When disaster strikes, she's quick to agree they must return to the small town where he was born and move into his childhood home, which was left to him after his mother's death not long ago. He sells the expensive cello and they make the trip. This is defeat for him: Unemployed, owning not even an instrument, back where he began.\n\nLooking into the employment ads, he finds a promising offer at what sounds like a travel agency. Daigo applies at a quiet little office managed by an assistant (Yo Kimiko), and soon the owner, Mr. Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki), appears. The interview is brief. He gets the job and a cash advance.

It\u2019s a background he shares with well-known Japanese filmmakers like Kiyoshi Kurosawa (\u201cTokyo Sonata\u201d) and Masayuki Suo (\u201cShall We Dance\u201d). \u201cBut frankly,\u201d he added, \u201cat my age I look back, and pink films, regular films, to me they\u2019re all part of the movies that I made. And they all express the joy I feel in the privilege I have of making all the decisions that create a world called a movie.\u201d\n\nImage Yojiro Takita found himself a surprise Oscar winner for his film \u0093Departures.\u0094 Credit... Regent Releasing/Here Media\n\nA youthful 53, Mr. Takita radiates the confidence required to make the myriad decisions involved in directing a movie like \u201cWhen the Last Sword Is Drawn\u201d or his 2001 hit, \u201cOnmyoji,\u201d a story of ghosts and wizards set 1,000 years ago in the Fujiwara court during the Heian period. (At a joint interview conducted through a translator at the Kitano Hotel in Manhattan, he and Mr. Motoki were also, as Japanese artists tend to be, more stylishly dressed and more polite than the American norm.)\n\nAfter a string of movies that combined history and mythology, swordplay and sorcery and special effects, \u201cDepartures\u201d was a change of pace. The idea for the film came from Mr. Motoki, who in his late 20s (he\u2019s now 43) read a book written by a nokanshi, or encoffineer. (The film\u2019s Japanese title, \u201cOkuribito,\u201d or send-off person, is another name for the same function.) For some Japanese funerals an encoffineer is hired to perform a ritual of bathing and dressing the body before it is placed in the coffin for cremation. Mr. Motoki was taken by \u201cthe world that the encoffineer was describing, where the baton of human life is passed from one generation to the next in this very moment in time during the encoffining ritual.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so I thought maybe by squarely acknowledging that moment of death and the immediate moment after,\u201d he said, \u201cit might be a way for a film to be made that could ultimately, sort of counterintuitively, affirm human life.\u201d\n\nMr. Motoki\u2019s character, Daigo, is a cellist whose orchestra is disbanded without warning. Answering an ad for what he thinks is a job at a travel agency, he stumbles into his new career and is taken in hand by a master encoffineer (Tsutomu Yamazaki, familiar to American moviegoers of a certain age as the truck driver and gourmand Goro in \u201cTampopo\u201d). Mr. Motoki\u2019s first challenge was finding the money for a film that mixed dead bodies and Japan\u2019s long economic malaise. \u201cWell, I did pitch it to several producers,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they all felt that death was not actually a good idea for a movie, so it took a long time.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.tasteofcinema.com/2020/all-20-best-international-film-oscar-winners-of-the-21st-century-ranked/", "page_content": "While the Academy Awards have always been favorable towards English language films, it has also honored some of cinema\u2019s most iconic international films since the Academy first created a separate category for foreign language films in 1956. Filmmakers including the likes of Almodovar, De Sica, and Kurasowa have all received the Academy Award for Best International Film during their careers.\n\nSince the 21st century began, films from all around the globe have been honored with the Oscar for Best International Film. Many of these films have gained much notoriety following their Oscar wins, garnering critical and commercial success that they may not have received had they not been Oscar winners. Here is a list of Best International Film winners of the 21st century, ranking from worst to best.\n\n20. Departures (2008)\n\nThe winner of Best International Film at the eighty-first Academy awards was the Japanese film Departures, directed by Y\u014djir\u014d Takita. After failing to find a career as a successful cellist, a young man returns to his hometown where he is able to find a job working for a traditional Japanese mortician. Coming from Japan where there are culturally-specific connotations surrounding death, Departures explores its protagonist\u2019s journey as he connects with his new career. Often stepping over the line of too conventional and too sentimental, Departures was a bit of an off-beat winner of the Academy Award for Best International Film.\n\n19. In a Better World (2010)\n\nAnother female filmmaker who has won the Oscar for Best International Film during the 21st century is Susanne Bier, whose film In a Better World won the award for Denmark in 2010. The film is an intense modern day thriller that cuts between a doctor working in a Sudanese refugee camp and his adolescent son\u2019s life back in Denmark as the two navigate their own senses of justice and righteousness. The ideas and themes presented in this film are provocative, leaning towards decisions and developments that are too disturbing, leaving this film at the bottom of the list.\n\n18. The Barbarian Invasions (2003)\n\nThe Barbarian Invasions won the Academy Award for Best International Film in 2003, where it was also nominated for Best Original Screenplay. Directed by Denys Arcand, this was Canada\u2019s first winner for Best International Film. A sequel to an earlier Arcand film, The Barbarian Invasions focuses on middle-aged S\u00e9bastien who returns home to Montreal after learning that his father is dying from cancer. A film that taps into post-millennial changes in the world and aging characters in contemplation of life, The Barbarian Invasions is a bit of a misanthropic film that could be loved or hated by viewers.\n\n17. Tsotsi (2005)\n\nThe only film on this list from the African continent, Tsotsi directed by Gavin Hood won the Best International Film Oscar in 2005. Taking place in a South African slum, the film\u2019s protagonist Tsotsi is a young criminal who is led on a journey of righteousness after being left with a baby to care for following a crime gone wrong. Platforming many African languages and presenting perspectives typically uncommon in western cultures, Tsotsi is deserving of its Best International Film win.\n\n16. The Sea Inside (2004)\n\nAlejandro Amen\u00e5bar\u2019s The Sea Inside won the Oscar for Best International Film for Spain at the 2004 ceremony. The Sea Inside is based on the true story of Ram\u00f3n Sampedro, a quadriplegic who fought European legal systems for nearly three decades for the right to an assisted suicide. Starring Javier Bardem in a role far away from his typical suave appearance, The Sea Inside is a sorrowful story that manages to evoke the sense of lightheartedness or comedy that is ever present in real life. A heavy topic that is carried by strong performances make The Sea Inside a befitting winner of Best International Film.\n\n15. Nowhere in Africa (2002)\n\nThe first German recipient of the Oscar for Best International film in the past twenty years is 2002\u2019s winner Nowhere in Africa. Female Filmmaker Caroline Link directed the film, based on a memoir by a German-Jewish woman whose family moved to Kenya before World War II to escape persecution. A graceful and romantic movie, Nowhere in Africa works to capture the experience of its central family as they grapple with geographical and emotional transitions.\n\n14. The Secret in Their Eyes (2009)\n\nAn Argentinian film won the Oscar for Best International Film in 2009 with Juan Jos\u00e9 Campanella\u2019s The Secret in Their Eyes. Based on a novel (whose author co-wrote the film\u2019s script) about the investigation of a brutal murder during the 1970\u2019s, the film also addresses the instability within Argentina during the times. The Secret in Their Eyes is surprising and entrancing, with a mysterious story unlike any other winner on this list.\n\n13. The Counterfeiters (2007)\n\nAustrian film The Counterfeiters directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky won Best International Film at the 80th Academy Awards ceremony. Another winner on this list that deals with themes of the Holocaust, The Counterfeiters is based on the real experiences of a Jewish counterfeiter who survived the Holocaust by forging Nazi documents and currencies. This film finds itself in the thirteenth position on this list because of its conventional story arc, cinematography, and use of flashback that has been seen in other Holocaust films.\n\n12. The Great Beauty (2013)\n\nThe Great Beauty won the Oscar for Best International Film in 2013. Directed by Italian filmmaker Paolo Sorrentino, The Great Beauty harkens back to classic Italian films such as 8 \u00bd in the way the film centers on an aging man facing the moral dilemmas of life. Profound connections to the modern human experience and amazing cinematography elevate The Great Beauty to a must-see Oscar winner.\n\n11. A Fantastic Woman (2017)\n\nChile received its first win in the Best International Film category at the Oscars in 2017 with A Fantastic Woman. Directed by Sebasti\u00e1n Lelio, the film focuses on a transgender woman in Santiago as she faces the aftermath of her boyfriend\u2019s sudden death. Starring a real transgender actress and confronting issues faced by the transgender community in Chile and worldwide, A Fantastic Woman has become a far-reaching LGBTQ film. A Fantastic Woman serves as an important film of representation in the history of the Academy Awards."}, {"url": "https://forums.animesuki.com/showthread.php?t=78880", "page_content": "TinyRedLeaf Moving in circles\n\n\n\nJoin Date: Apr 2006 Location: Singapore Age: 48\n\nDepartures (2008), Oscar-winning film Departures wins Oscar in upset\n\nNo iframe support, please watch on YouTube.\n\nQuote: New York (Feb 22): Japan's Departures, a film about a man who prepares bodies for burial, won the Oscar for best foreign-language film in an upset over the favoured Waltz With Bashir.\n\n\n\n\"This is a new departure for me,\" director Yojiro Takita said while accepting the award. \"And we'll be back, I hope.\"\n\n\n\nDepartures is about a cellist whose orchestra is disbanded and, desperate for work, becomes a funeral professional. The win for the less heralded Departures was likely to further frustrate critics of the foreign film category, which in recent years has gone without nominating several much acclaimed films.\n\n\n\nIsrael's Waltz with Bashir was one of the most acclaimed films of the year but defied easy categorisation. A kind of animated documentary, it follows a soldier struggling to recall suppressed memories from his involvement in Israel's 1982 war with Lebanon. It won the Golden Globe for best foreign-language film.\n\n\n\n- ASSOCIATED PRESS Waltz with Bashir, but I did manage to catch Departures today, right after watching The Watchmen.\n\n\n\nIt's strangely ironic.

They\u2019re en route to a funeral, whereupon their services as nokanshi will be utilized by the family of a dead girl. The old man is stoic, while the younger one is stricken, his taut face displaying unveiled terror; he might as well be storming Omaha Beach, not dressing up a corpse.\n\nYojiro Takita\u2019s \u201cDepartures,\u201d which won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film last February, pulls no punches in illustrating the work of a nokanshi, the preparer of dead bodies. Americans might be comfortable with leaving the task of corpse preparation in an undertaker\u2019s basement, but in Japan, the process gets a large familial audience. The graceful cleansing of the face, application of makeup and shrouding by sheet are laid bare for all to see. It is a strangely beautiful sight.\n\nStill, it is clear that Daigo (Masahiro Motoki), the youthful protagonist of \u201cDepartures,\u201d is unnerved by his newfound profession. A former cellist who was left unemployed after the termination of his Tokyo orchestra, Daigo returns to his hometown in the northern countryside accompanied by his wife Mika (Ryoko Hirosue). Looking for work, he notices a promising job listing in the paper for what he believes is a travel agency.\n\nIn a way, Daigo\u2019s first impression of the job is accurate. However, it soon becomes clear after his interview with Ikuei (Tsutomu Yamazaki), the aging proprietor of a funeral home, that Daigo will not be sending clients to Oahu. Within days of accepting the position, Daigo finds himself with Ikuei in a roach infested apartment, removing the rotting body of an elderly woman. Understandably, he does not tell Mika how his day went.\n\nThe looming question in the heart of \u201cDepartures\u201d is how somebody who makes a living by handling corpses finds solace and worth in their occupation. While the process might bring peace to the families of the deceased, others, including some of Daigo\u2019s childhood acquaintances and his own wife, view it with utter repugnance.\n\nTakita takes great pains in using Daigo\u2019s troubling profession as a means of revealing the poor man\u2019s painful history, which includes the death of his mother at a young age, and a father who walked out on the family even earlier. While these revelations give us a more intimate glimpse at Daigo\u2019s vulnerabilities, they push the movie into an uncomfortably long running time, and eventually start to feel glaringly plotted.\n\nWhat makes \u201cDepartures\u201d more enjoyable is its lurking sense of humor, which rears its head in unexpected ways. Take, for instance, a scene where Ikuei enlists the newly hired Daigo to play a corpse in a how-to video for aspiring nokanshi. Bristling under Ikuei\u2019s not-so-carefully applied straight razor, Daigo appears as hysterically helpless as Jeff Daniels did while full of laxatives in \u201cDumb & Dumber,\u201d and the film resists falling to the suicidal dearth of self-seriousness.\n\nIt certainly helps that Motoki is terrifically convincing as Daigo. Spritely in appearance and output, Motoki\u2019s face holds nothing back in communicating anxieties, frustrations, hopes and pleasures. His performance is an excellent counterpart to Yamazaki\u2019s warm but vacant Ikuei, who seems to have been whittled down to his current form by the same sights and processes that nauseate Daigo.\n\nWatching Daigo\u2019s passage into acceptance as a nokanshi is both painful and intriguing. It\u2019s tempting, perhaps naturally, to hope that Daigo might find a means of overcoming his situation and moving onward professionally. The more challenging and interesting idea is that Daigo may be proud of his work as a nokanshi, despite the societal taboos attached to it.\n\nUnfortunately, Takita himself seems to be thinking along the lines of the former, as suggested by several labored montages of Daigo practicing cello against the mountains to Joe Hisashi\u2019s lovely score. \u201cDepartures\u201d builds itself up for a climactic shift, yet that shift never quite comes. The film\u2019s ending is satisfying for its lack of a predictable cop-out, yet somehow ends up feeling confused in its resolution.\n\nAmerican audiences will likely be moved by the thin personal stories of \u201cDepartures,\u201d as well as its unyielding look into a little known aspect of Japanese culture. Takita\u2019s film is certainly a curious, disarming picture, but it also is overstuffed with undeveloped ideas, even with its excessive length of two hours and 10 minutes. It\u2019s as interesting as any museum exhibit and funny at times, but one cannot help but come out feeling as cold and bloated as, well, a corpse."}, {"url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/japanese-film-departures_b_210961", "page_content": "One thing people haven't quite figured out is how to escape death. Oh they try, and have many ways to prolong life before the inevitable occurs. We have certainly developed endless religions and mythologies to contend with what happens after death. But one thing's for sure, death happens and the dead occupy a large part of life. Every culture on the planet has its own unique and elaborate rituals for dealing with the dead -- especially when it happens to be one of us.\n\nNow, when it comes to ritualization, the Japanese are the ultimate fetishists. And they show no exception when it comes to the matter of death and developing elaborate rituals for dealing with the dead -- though it has never been much of Nipponese cinematic subject (unlike say, the Irish where there seems to be a funeral or wake in nearly every film made about people of Gaelic descent)--that is, not until the film Departures was made.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTelling the tale of Daigo Kobayashi, a classical cellist who has lost his job and way, the film details his return with his young wife to his hometown where he find a new job -- preparing the dead for burial -- and himself. Apparently, the film's universal message and the tender way in which \"encoffining\" is handled by director Yojiro Takitaand its star, Masahiro Motoki so affected one important audience -- the nominating committee for the Foreign-language Film Academy Award -- that the film not only got nominated this year but won the Oscar, much to the surprise to many of those familiar with the other choices.\n\nWith that accolade in place, the film made its U.S. premiere at this year's Tribeca Film Festival and finally opened for general audiences at the end of May 2009. In order to properly enlighten the journos invited to meet with director Takita and star Motoki, a lengthy interview session was conducted.\n\nQ: Winning the Academy Award must have had a huge impact on the film's box office receipts in Japan?\n\nIt had a very sizeable Japanese audience before the Academy Award but the box office has more than doubled [to over $60 million] after the Academy Award, yet there's a part of me that wishes it wouldn't take an Academy Award for it to get that big.\n\nMM: The other phenomenon is that in Japan, the DVD release date had already been set in anticipation of a certain kind of theatrical run. But because of the Academy Award, the theaters continued to remain packed even though the DVD was already out, so that's very unusual. Also, we're starting to see people coming, especially older people who haven't been to a movie theater in 30, or 40 years. So we're really finding a fresh, new audience.\n\n\n\nQ: You both have very unique backgrounds, and have followed somewhat unconventional paths to the Oscar. Motoki, you started out in a boy band in Japan. And Takita, you were directing pink films [softcore porn] in Japan. How surreal that must have felt, having reached the pinnacle of your profession by going from there to the Oscars?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYT: For me, it's been a very straightforward journey. It may look a little strange to you, but I think most filmmakers are a little strange anyway! I think the only thing that never varied was my love of filmmaking, and my efforts to stay true to the film that I'm making. That has never varied throughout my career, and I hope that will stay true from now on.\n\nMM: It's true, I did start out my career initially in a pop band [as an] idol singer. But I doubt that my singing skills were such that if I had stayed a singer, I would have wound up with a Grammy. I don't think that was in the cards for me! I'm very fortunately to have become an actor, because film can be such a universal language, and through that medium, my work was able to be appreciated by people outside of Japan.\n\nBut on the other hand, there was a larger sense of fate that carried me to that [Oscar] stage, because an actor has to find the right material, and the material has to jive with the times and the zeitgeist and the ethos, and all of that came together in a very organic way.\n\n\n\nQ: What were the circumstances that led you to the book you studied, Coffin Man, and what helped you find a film in this material?\n\nMM: I actually didn't know anything about encoffining. I initially read about it in a book about 20 years ago. It seemed that a complete stranger cleaning and handling a corpse before sending it off into the next world would make a fantastic film. As I read the book, it really played out for me in a cinematic way--I could really see it as a film.\n\nYou know, the profession of encoffining was entirely new to me. I had seen corpses displayed or laid out in a coffin, but I had no idea how a corpse gets to that place, or that there was an actual ritual around that whole process. It actually ultimately started when I traveled to India in my 20s and had seen a cremation ceremony on the bank of the Ganges River. It was a very fresh scene for me, because in the same moment, the past and the future co-existed, and it seemed like the same was true of the encoffining ritual. By openly acknowledging death, it ends up having a life-affirming impact on the living. So I wanted to share this and not just keep it for myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQ: What acting methods did you use during the film and how did you develop the character?\n\nMM: The film of course is very delicately themed, so I was very mindful of that as an overall guidepost for my performance in terms of observing and respecting the very quiet, still atmosphere. The director is very skilled in eliciting and capturing the comedy in human folly, even in the midst of all this sadness.\n\nBut overall, in terms of technically, I needed to accomplish two things: I needed to be able to perform on the cello as though I looked like a professional performer, and I also spent about two months apprenticing with an encoffiner because I needed to look like a professional at [that].\n\nQ: What is Takita like as a director?\n\nMM: He has a longtime, loyal crew, so they work very, very efficiently. In Japan, it's very easy for people to get caught up in the day and end up with a lot of overtime. But his crew was very efficient, which was very much appreciated!\n\nOne of Mr. Takita's great skills as a director is that he finds comedy in very ordinary human behavior, and he enjoys finding the comedy of everyday life and flushing it out. I know that the theme this time is a very quiet and delicate theme, but his belief is that the more earnest a human being is, the funnier it looks from a little bit of a distance. So he definitely directed me very specifically towards that direction.\n\n\n\nQ: Can you give any examples?\n\nMM: I tend to underplay and be subdued in my reactions as an actor. But because the quiet moments are already there, he really pushed me to -- in my definition -- overact a little bit. In the scene where they're making the video about how to encoffin and I had to wear some adult diapers, he really pushed me to do what I would consider \"overacting.\" He's just saying that the director sees a certain approach to a 'double-take,' and the director's always concerned that the audience understand it, and that it not be left up in the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQ: There was some struggle to get the film released after it was made, and it took almost 13 months to release it.\n\nYT: It took 13 months for the film to be released because the film deals with death, and even after the film was completed, it was a kind of mystery to a lot of people as to how this film could find its audience--even in Japan--as well as how to market it to reach that potential audience.\n\nQ: Did you study death rituals in other countries and how did this research inform your approach to Departures?\n\nMM: I [not only] read about the Japanese encoffining procedure in Coffin Man, I certainly did read about other cultures and how they send off the dead. I know in Tibet, they have the \"bird funeral\" where they surrender the corpse directly to the birds in the mountains.\n\nIn the West, cremation is less popular than it is in Asia, and you have the custom of directly burying the body in a coffin in the earth. I also did learn that the whole embalming technique especially evolved through the Vietnam War, [with] the need to send home fallen soldiers back to the States in the best possible shape.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, there's a fascination with the profession of undertaking -- judging from the popularity of the HBO show Six Feet Under here. Each culture is concerned in their own way with respecting and addressing the dead. But ironically, learning about those different customs made me appreciate our Japanese ritual all the more.\n\nYT: I didn't have a concrete understanding of death and the various procedures around it, so I did read a lot to prepare for the film. Of course, I was interested in this question of embalming. We don't actually have it for a number of reasons in Japan, including that we don't actually have a military. But I was interested to learn that embalming is very respected as a technical profession [here], which is not true in Japan.\n\nBut the story itself, as you know, is a deeply Japanese film -- and a very Japanese subject -- and I knew that I could afford to be as authentically Japanese as I wanted to, because the universality of death would help the film to find its international audience.\n\n\n\nQ: Do you have any friends who are encoffiners?\n\nMM: Actually, I don't. But while I was training for the film, I met many different encoffiners. I was surprised to discover how many young people there were, as well as women, who were choosing this as a profession. By the way, because this movie is such a hit in Japan, job applications for encoffining are now up three times, or so they say!\n\nQ: The film's original score by Joe Hisaishi was essential to the story.\n\nYT: I had worked with Hisaishi before when I made a samurai film, and I knew from the way he had read the music into the script for that film that he's somebody who can really generate a world of music that's commensurate to the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis time, I was thrilled when he said yes to composing the music, and, because the story is about a cellist, we agreed before doing it that there would be almost no music besides the cello used in the film.\n\nOf course, it was impossible to just have the cello be on the soundtrack, so there were some other music elements. But ultimately, the main theme at the end is played with 13 cellos. In a discussion before we started filming, he was able to envision and compose the main theme, so we were able to play that during the filming, and it really helped to inspire the actors.\n\nMM: Practicing for this film was the very first time I'd ever touched a cello. The cellist told me that the timbre and tone of a cello is, of all the string instruments, the closest to the human voice, so it reverberates very, very organically to the human body. I think that wound up adding a layer of nuance to the film, although technically it was a huge challenge for me to perform the cello convincingly.\n\nBut for me as an actor, it was very inspiring to be able to work with that instrument. And I also felt that there was a very lovely, metaphorical connection, since the cello is originally inspired by the human form--especially the female form--so I start out embracing the cello, which is based on the human body, and then I [begin to] embrace the human body directly, in the form of a corpse.\n\nQ: When Daigo's wife and friends find out that he's an encoffiner, they reject him and deem him \"unclean.\" Is there a cultural stigma in Japan that's related to this profession?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYT: Yes. In Japan, for a long time, there has been a sense that death--and the people who have to deal with death--definitely [has] a stigma. Death is considered impure or tainted, and so we have long denied death, and that kind of prejudice certainly existed within the wife, which initially drove her far away. But what I was trying to portray in the film was not the prejudice itself, but her ability to articulate it as being the first step towards reconciliation for them. So, I really see her role as being someone who is still immature, and the film's story is the story of maturation.\n\nQ: Since the film is very specifically Japanese, do you think audiences here in the United States will miss something because they're not Japanese?"}]}
