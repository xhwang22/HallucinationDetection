Carrier. The company that he worked for needed to find a way to control humidity and by solving this problem, Carrier created a system that could be used for cooling the rooms of a house. The Sun Belt thanks him!\n\nIn 1935, he was 33 years old when on September 8th, Louisiana Senator Huey Long was shot by Dr. Carl Weiss. Weiss was shot and killed immediately by Long's bodyguards - Long died two days later from his injuries. Long had received many death threats previously, as well as threats against his family. He was a powerful and controversial figure in Louisiana politics (and probably gained power through multiple criminal acts). His opponents became frustrated with their attempts to oust him and Dr. Weiss was the son-in-law of one of those opponents. His funeral was attended by 200,000 mourners.\n\nIn 1954, Frank was 52 years old when from April 22 through June 17th, the Army v. McCarthy hearings were held. The U.S. Army accused Roy Cohn (chief counsel to Senator McCarthy and later trusted mentor of Donald Trump) of blackmail. McCarthy and Cohn accused the U.S. Army of harboring communists. The Army allegations were found to be true. The U.S. Senate later censured McCarthy.\n\nIn 1965, at the age of 63 years old, Frank was alive when the television show \"I Spy\" premiered in the fall season on NBC. The stars were Bill Cosby and Robert Culp, making Cosby the first African American to headline a television show. Four stations - in Georgia, Florida, and Alabama - refused to air the show.\n\nIn 1974, in the year of Frank Mclain's passing, on August 9th, Gerald R. Ford became the 38th President of the United States. He had been Vice President for 8 months when he became President due to the resignation of President Nixon."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Arlen-Specter", "page_content": "Arlen Specter, (born February 12, 1930, Wichita, Kansas, U.S.\u2014died October 14, 2012, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), American lawyer and politician who was a U.S. senator from Pennsylvania (1981\u20132011). Originally a Democrat, he became a Republican in the 1960s before switching back to the Democratic Party in 2009.\n\nSpecter, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants, was raised in Russell, Kansas. In 1951 he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in international relations from the University of Pennsylvania. Specter attained the rank of second lieutenant while serving (1951\u201353) with the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations during the Korean War. He later attended Yale Law School, graduating in 1956.\n\nSpecter then joined a prominent Philadelphia law firm (1956\u201366) and in 1959 was appointed assistant district attorney. From 1963 to 1964 he served as assistant counsel on the Warren Commission, the body charged with investigating the assassination of U.S. Pres. John F. Kennedy. Though a registered Democrat, Specter failed to gain support from his party and was elected district attorney of Philadelphia on a Republican ballot in 1965. He soon registered as a Republican. Following his failure to win a third term in 1973, he returned to practicing law.\n\nAfter unsuccessful primary bids for Pennsylvania senator (1976) and governor (1978), Specter claimed victory in the 1980 U.S. Senate race. While he broke ranks with the Republican Party on occasion\u2014notably voicing support for civil unions for gay couples and for abortion rights\u2014Specter (or \u201cSnarlin\u2019 Arlen,\u201d as he was known to colleagues) was sometimes fiercely partisan. His aggressive questioning of Anita Hill, who had accused Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, during Thomas\u2019s 1991 confirmation hearing was widely seen as an attempt to assure the appointment of the conservative justice. During his tenure as chairman of the Intelligence Committee (1995\u201397), Specter wrote legislation instituting an inspector general of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Specter also chaired the Veteran\u2019s Affairs Committee (1997\u20132001; 2003\u201305). He won a fifth term in the U.S. Senate in 2004, and in 2005 he was elected chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n\nIn April 2009 Specter returned to the Democratic Party, giving the Democrats a supermajority in the Senate. Though Specter maintained that his shift was ideologically motivated, he acknowledged that his support of U.S. Pres. Barack Obama\u2019s stimulus package rendered him unlikely to win the 2010 primary election as a Republican. Characterized by many observers as a transparent attempt to salvage his political fortunes, the move was ultimately futile. Specter lost the Democratic primary to U.S. Rep. Joe Sestak.\n\nSpecter authored Passion for Truth: From Finding JFK\u2019s Single Bullet to Questioning Anita Hill to Impeaching Clinton (2000; with Charles Robbins), a political autobiography, and Never Give In: Battling Cancer in the Senate (2008; with Frank J. Scaturro), about his battle with lymphoma."}, {"url": "https://www.powershow.com/view0/840a39-OGQzM/Frank_McLain_-_Graduating_Law_School_powerpoint_ppt_presentation", "page_content": "PowerShow.com is a leading presentation sharing website.
