{"William J. Flanagan, Jr. graduated from the University of Rhode Island in 1967 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration.": [{"url": "https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-19960513-1996-05-13-9605130049-story.html", "page_content": "Bud Flanagan isn\u2019t all business. He just sounds that way.\n\nAs he should. Adm. William J. Flanagan Jr. is commander-in-chief of Atlantic Fleet, one of the Navy\u2019s two largest commands. From his headquarters at the sprawling Norfolk Naval Base, he controls the destiny of 17 naval bases, 208 ships, 1,300 aircraft, 131,000 officers and sailors, and a $10 billion annual budget. His corporate equivalent would be the chief executive officer of the 130th-ranked Fortune 500 company.\n\nThe parallels don\u2019t stop with the figures; Flanagan brings a distinctly businesslike approach to the command. At times, he sounds more like a CEO than a senior naval officer.\n\n\u201cI want to be able to give the American public a better product for less money in the future,\u201d Flanagan says. \u201cI want us to become as efficient as we can. I want us to protect the investment that the generous American taxpayers have put in our hands.\u201d\n\nFlanagan has plenty of commander in him, too \u2013 as well as a strict sense of right and wrong that grew naturally from his father, a lifelong policeman, and strong Roman Catholic roots. When he learned in October 1995 that the Navy had kept a 95-year-old York County woman from selling a parcel of property crossed by ancient, unused Navy railroad tracks, Flanagan wasted no words.\n\nHis response: \u201cFix it today.\u201d It was.\n\nFlanagan, 53, looks both parts. Silver-haired, barrel-chested and sharp-eyed, he displays, despite a slight uneasiness at the interview process, a confident, commanding presence. Although he enjoys the trappings of his four-star position, friends say he\u2019s no martinet. In fact, they say, he is a gregarious and highly social man.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s much easier going and more down-to-earth than most flag officers,\u201d said retired Rear Adm. Maurice Bresnahan, an old school chum.\n\nThose qualities are reflected in his leadership style. Whether commanding a fleet, a ship, or overseeing the Navy\u2019s dealings with Congress, Flanagan \u201cbelieves in the family concept,\u201d said Capt. Don Nash, twice a Flanagan associate and now top assistant to the deputy commander of U.S. Atlantic Command. Flanagan, Nash said, empowers people to do their jobs while encouraging them to work as a team. \u201cHe inspires people to do more than they think they can do,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNobody doubts who the boss is, but nobody feels that they are subservient to him,\u201d Nash said.\n\nWhile Flanagan may look the part, his \u201ccompany\u201d most assuredly does not. Unlike some CEOs, Flanagan doesn\u2019t produce a tangible product for market. He turns out combat-ready aircraft carrier battle groups.\n\nFlanagan has six of these. Although the ships and crews already exist, they must be maintained, trained and ready to deploy every six months on a rotating basis.\n\nAmerican taxpayers incur an enormous expense for the services provided by Flanagan\u2019s organization. Each carrier group\u2019s 18-month cycle of preparation and deployment costs $500 million.\n\nIn addition to this huge expense, Flanagan must do as much as his predecessors with less; post-Cold War reductions have shrunk his fleet, but the Navy\u2019s deployment schedule hasn\u2019t changed. Those realities make Flanagan look hard at shaving costs and making his vast operation more efficient.\n\nFlanagan, a Harvard Business School graduate, has a strong affinity for concepts such as efficiency. \u201cMy view is that there\u2019s a lot of principles involved in the business world that we need to employ,\u201d he says.\n\nEfficiency is spelled two ways for Flanagan. One is at it is applied to the art of warfighting, practiced at its highest level.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to bring this force somewhere to employ it in anger, it\u2019s got to be able to do so at a very, very high rate of efficiency, and bring all our people home,\u201d Flanagan said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the goal.\u201d\n\nThe other efficiency is strictly monetary. The fleet\u2019s $10 billion budget and increasing pressure to reduce federal spending demand that money be saved wherever possible.\n\nBut while fiscal thriftiness has a strong appeal for Flanagan, he says it also produces benefits for the operational commanders who receive his forces.\n\n\u201cThe efficiencies that we\u2019re able to realize will be passed on to these operational commanders in terms of force availability,\u201d Flanagan says. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s critical.\u201d\n\nTo realize the savings, Flanagan said, the fleet is taking a fresh look at its accounting practices \u2013 the means it uses to calculate the \u201ccost of goods sold.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know now what those are,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of building a management accounting system to better account for what it is we spend and how it is we spend it.\n\n\u201cI think those are two very key things.\u201d\n\nFlanagan is also saving money through more efficient management of his floating assets. His ships, unless laid up for extended maintenance, must spend six months of each 18-month cycle on overseas deployments to the Mediterranean. But Atlantic Fleet ships also patrol the Caribbean Sea and points further south, and conduct joint operations with allies in that region.\n\nFlanagan, who was 2nd Fleet commander prior to assuming the top job at Atlantic Fleet, realized that about 25 percent of his available forces were at any given time required to be at sea for Caribbean duty. So, he reasoned, \u201cwhy don\u2019t we build a force that operates exclusively in this region?\u201d\n\nBy doing so, Flanagan said, the operators of those ships would become experts on the regional mission instead of spending additional time being trained for every possible contingency the Atlantic Fleet could face, the standard for ships preparing for Med cruises.\n\nThe result of that sort of thinking was the formation of the Western Hemisphere Group, a group of selected ships based in Mayport, Fla., that operates solely in Caribbean and South Atlantic waters.\n\n\u201cI think that we improved the product, and I think that we did it at less cost,\u201d Flanagan said.\n\nIn addition, Flanagan, along with his Pacific Fleet counterpart, Adm. Ronald J. Zlatoper, has created a fleetwide, money-saving training schedule for ships preparing to go overseas. By keeping his ships near the U.S. coast instead of sailing to the Caribbean for the third and final phase of their training, Flanagan shaves 3,000 miles off each ship\u2019s round trip and cuts the time spent doing such training in half.\n\nFlanagan and Zlatoper have also combined efforts to streamline the two organizations\u2019 training and operational procedures. Over the years, the two fleets, one based in Norfolk, the other in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, had developed into distinct and separate cultures \u2013 so much so that, according to Zlatoper aide Capt. Steve Clawson, ships from the two fleets meeting at sea could not, as recently as 15 years ago, effectively communicate or work together.\n\nNow, that\u2019s changing. \u201cWe decided that we would work together,\u201d Zlatoper said recently. \u201cOur predecessors started working to coordinate the two fleets, and we\u2019ve continued that.\u201d\n\nZlatoper gives Flanagan much of the credit for making the project a success. \u201cFrom my estimation, he has really brought the flag officers of the surface fleet together better than anyone in my memory,\u201d Zlatoper said.\n\nFlanagan could also gain future savings for his fleet by way of a previously proposed project that, although it remains in the planning stages, could have significant impact on Hampton Roads.\n\nFlanagan wants to combine public and private transportation assets to make the region a highly effective launching pad for massive numbers of troops en route to an overseas crisis. This \u201cintermodal transportation system\u201d would combine highway, rail, and port operations in a manner that would serve both military and commercial needs more efficiently.\n\nIn one example of cost-sharing, Flanagan would provide easements to Norfolk Naval Base property to allow the adjacent Norfolk International Terminal to expand its commercial operations. At the same time, NIT would take on the Navy\u2019s cargo-handling operation, saving tax dollars.\n\n\u201cThe way I\u2019m looking at it is, how can we do something that\u2019ll benefit the military, and as a result benefit the United States, in terms of being able to mobilize if we have to with the greatest efficiency \u2026 at the same time, how can all of this benefit the community?\u201d Flanagan said.\n\nThis sort of thinking is what has attracted the attention of the region\u2019s business, civic and government leaders, who have included Flanagan on the organizing committee for the Hampton Roads Public/Private Partnership, a new group being organized in hopes of improving regional cooperation on economic issues. Flanagan says that given the Navy\u2019s size here, that\u2019s as it should be.\n\n\u201cThe Navy puts about $11 billion a year in this economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a significant contribution, and it makes us the largest contributor of anyone in this region.\u201d\n\nDespite his drive to maximize potential and efficiency, Flanagan takes the time to listen.\n\nHe says he believes in a workplace where honest dissent from the party line can be expressed without fear of retribution. His leadership style is deliberate, and stems from a sense of purpose that others say Flanagan possessed even as a young man.\n\n\u201cHe was always focused,\u201d said Neil Nightingale, chief of police in the Cape Cod town of Barnstable, where Flanagan grew up. \u201cHe always knew where he wanted to go.\u201d Nightingale worked for Flanagan\u2019s father, the former deputy chief, from whom the son inherited the nickname \u201cBud.\u201d\n\nNightingale remembers the younger Flanagan as \u201calways well-behaved and polite. He was not a rowdy \u2026 he was always a straight arrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew he was destined for big things,\u201d said George Gillis, a friend and classmate of Flanagan\u2019s at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy in nearby Buzzard\u2019s Bay. \u201cHe was so personable, so disciplined, so dedicated. When he wanted something, he got it.\u201d\n\nFlanagan spent some of his youthful summers caddying at a golf club frequented by the Kennedy clan. But in addition to walking the greens, he, like many other Cape Cod youths, worked on lobster and fishing boats. Both of his grandfathers were sea captains. Life at sea intrigued him.\n\nAt the maritime academy, Flanagan lived on a ship; dormitories weren\u2019t then an option. \u201cWe did every single job a sailor does on a ship,\u201d said Bresnahan, now the assistant to the academy president. \u201cThat stood me in good stead, and I\u2019m sure it did Bud Flanagan.\u201d\n\nThe course work didn\u2019t come easy. \u201cWe had a tough regimen here, and he struggled like the rest of us,\u201d Bresnahan said. \u201cAcademically. It\u2019s a tough school. It didn\u2019t come easy.\u201d\n\nIn 1964, Flanagan graduated and set forth, armed with a degree in marine transportation and a 3rd Class Coast Guard license. While some of his classmates began their Navy careers, Flanagan chose to follow in the footsteps of his grandfathers and join the U.S. Merchant Marine. He served three years, sailing with American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines out of New York.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. involvement in Vietnam had grown from an advisory role to full-blown war. In 1967, Flanagan accepted a full Naval commission and sailed west. He served on two ships during that war, and hasn\u2019t looked back to civilian life.\n\nFlanagan was selected to be the 1973-74 Chief of Naval Operations Fellow, serving under Admirals Elmo R. Zumwalt and James L. Holloway III. In 1975, he commanded his first ship, USS Bronstein. In 1979, at age 35, he was named one of the U.S. Jaycees\u2019 Ten Outstanding Young Americans \u2013 along with Vietnam War hero and Pittsburgh Steelers running back \u201cRocky\u201d Bleier, and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton.\n\nThe following year, he began a three-year hitch as the first commander of the USS Kidd, a new class of guided missile destroyer. In 1988 \u2013 his 19th year of service \u2013 Flanagan was selected for promotion to rear admiral. He subsequently served as commander of Destroyer Squadron Five in San Diego and of the Norfolk-based Second Fleet. In October 1994, he assumed his present command, and donned his fourth star.\n\nFlanagan\u2019s meteoric rise through the ranks makes some think he\u2019s a logical candidate to rise even higher in the U.S. military hierarchy. But Flanagan downplays such possibilities, refuses to speculate on the future, and says he\u2019s focused on his present work.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to use this as a springboard to some other opportunity,\u201d Flanagan says he has repeatedly told his staff, \u201cbut rather, just to make sure that we got this done as well as we could.\u201d\n\nTHE FLANAGAN LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHY\n\n1. Add wisdom from the top down. \u201cIn other words, if you know something, and obviously you do, because you\u2019re in a senior position, then you\u2019ve got to share that with your subordinates. When it comes time for them to take your position, they\u2019ll do it not as well, but better than you.\u201d\n\n2. Take fear out of the workplace. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sin to make a mistake. We learn from them. It\u2019s an attitude that if we approach this with openness, and goodwill, and moral purpose, we\u2019ll get improvement.\u201d\n\n3. You\u2019ve got to have optimism. \u201cThe fleet\u2019s as big as the fleet is right now. It\u2019s the best fleet we\u2019ve got. I\u2019ve never heard a man win a fight that went into it thinking he was going to lose. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to lose anything, and we all need to think that way. We have a new Navy that\u2019s restructured, and that\u2019s important to have confidence in, and to build on.\u201d\n\nADM. WILLIAM J.

He continues to serve on the Senate\u2019s Veterans, Homeland Security and Military Affairs Committee where he has sponsored numerous laws to assist veterans.\n\nSenator Larkin has led two national campaigns to ensure that our nation does not forget the servicemen and women who have been awarded the Purple Heart Medal for being killed or wounded in combat. His efforts resulted in the United States Postal Service\u2019s first issuance of a Purple Heart postage stamp in 2003. The stamp continues to be circulated today.\n\nSenator Larkin also spearheaded the establishment of the Purple Heart Hall of Honor. The Hall collects and preserves the stories of over 100,000 Purple Heart recipients from all branches of service, and includes educational exhibits related to military history and the Purple Heart, which dates back to George Washington.\n\nIn 2014, the United States Army presented Senator Larkin with its highest civilian award, the Decoration for Distinguished Civilian Service, in recognition of his decades of service on behalf of veterans.
