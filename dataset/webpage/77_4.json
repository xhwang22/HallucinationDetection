He was cofounder in 1991 of Tectonic Theater Project, a company dedicated to examining the structure and language of theatre as well as addressing contemporary social issues.\n\nKaufman was born in Venezuela to Orthodox Jewish parents and was of Ukrainian and Romanian descent. He attended a yeshiva (Jewish religious school) as a child and was exposed to broader culture on family trips to New York City. A Caracas theatre festival he attended as a young teenager brought him exposure to the avant-garde plays of such artists as Peter Brook, Tadeusz Kantor, Pina Bausch, and Jerzy Grotowski, whom he cited as his early influences. While attending Metropolitan University in Caracas (B.A. in business administration, 1985), Kaufman joined a touring experimental theatre group as an actor. In 1987 he moved to New York City, where he studied theatre directing at the Tisch School of the Arts, New York University, meanwhile directing a variety of plays. It was at NYU that he honed his ideas about the purpose and most-effective means of presenting theatrical performances. Four years later Kaufman, together with his partner, Jeffrey LaHoste, established Tectonic Theater Project.\n\nKaufman\u2019s writing debut, Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde (performed 1997\u201398, published 1997), illustrated his concerns as a writer-director. He was especially interested in what he termed \u201cwatershed historical moments,\u201d events that reveal the foundations of society\u2019s beliefs. A powerful and moving play that used actual trial testimony, Gross Indecency won an Outer Critics Circle Award for outstanding Off-Broadway play. Kaufman and his troupe then began work on The Laramie Project (performed 2000, published 2001, television movie 2002), interviewing numerous residents of the small Wyoming city in which gay college student Matthew Shepard had been brutally murdered. The play had particular resonance with Kaufman, who was gay, and it proved popular throughout the world.\n\nIn 2003 Kaufman directed a one-man show, Doug Wright\u2019s I Am My Own Wife: Studies for a Play About Charlotte von Mahlsdorf (performed 2003\u201304), the story of a gay transvestite who survived life in Nazi Germany and Soviet East Berlin. It was critically acclaimed and resulted in a Tony Award nomination for Kaufman. In the next several years Kaufman directed a variety of plays, including Wilde\u2019s Lady Windermere\u2019s Fan and Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth. He also directed his own play 33 Variations (first performed 2007), starring Jane Fonda as a musicologist obsessed with Beethoven\u2019s Diabelli Variations, and received another Tony nomination. In 2009 Kaufman and other Tectonic members arranged for 150 simultaneous readings in theatres across the globe of a sequel, The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later. He also directed Rajiv Joseph\u2019s Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo (performed 2011), starring Robin Williams as the title character; a 2012\u201313 revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz\u2019s The Heiress, a play based on Henry James\u2019s novel Washington Square; and a revival of Torch Song (2018\u201319), which was written by Harvey Fierstein.

We must make ourselves known.\u201d\n\nCamus also states in his book that \u201cin every act of rebellion,\u201d the rebel experiences a \u201ccomplete and spontaneous loyalty to certain aspects of himself.\u201d Just four years after the riots, in 1973, we said \u201cno\u201d to the American Psychiatric Association, and its leaders at long last removed the diagnosis of homosexuality from its official list of mental illnesses.\n\nThe next year, 1974, we said \u201cno\u201d to being politically powerless when Elaine Noble, the first out lesbian to run for a state-level political office, was elected to the Massachusetts State Legislature. And, famously, in 1977, an openly gay man, Harvey Milk, was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.\n\nBut as the battle went on, and as the character of the homosexual was being redrawn in revolt, 1981 brought about the first cases of the AIDS epidemic.

Kaufman's latest production, \"Paradise Square,\" is nominated for 10 Tony Awards. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Seven years ago, Mois\u00e9s Kaufman was approached to direct the Broadway musical \u201cParadise Square\u201d and, after reading it, he immediately said yes.\n\n\u201cI did this show because it spoke to me,\u201d the Venezuelan theater director and playwright says. \u201cSo much of my work occurs at the intersection of the personal and the political. I like to look at history through the eyes of the other, through the eye of the person that doesn\u2019t get to tell their story.\u201d\n\nNow \u201cParadise Square\u201d \u2014 about unity and racism in New York\u2019s notorious Five Points neighborhood, where Irish immigrants and Black Americans jostled to survive in the years before the Civil War \u2014 is nominated for 10 Tony Awards, including best musical, best lead actress for Joaquina Kalukango, and best featured actor for both Sidney DuPont and A.J. Shively.\n\nDuring a recent interview with The Associated Press, Kaufman, himself an immigrant based in New York City, reflected on immigration and the roots of American divisions.\n\n\u201cImmigration is a great fallacy, because you never leave the country where you were born, and you never arrive in the country where you land. Your being is always divided, part of you is there and part of you is here,\u201d he said.\n\nThe founder of Tectonic Theater Project \u2014 best known for \u201cThe Laramie Project\u201d and who has received awards including the National Medal of Arts \u2014 also spoke about the relevance of the show today and the powerhouse that is Kalukango as the courageous bar owner Nelly O\u2019Brien.\n\nRemarks have been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\n___\n\nAP: You have directed plays on Broadway, but this is your first Broadway musical. Did you expect \u201cParadise Square\u201d to get 10 nominations?\n\nKAUFMAN: No, I did not expect it. It was a great joy to hear that and to get that, and it\u2019s been really rewarding! I did this show because it spoke to me. I don\u2019t know, something about looking at America through the eyes of that community, a community where Irish immigrants and Black natives were getting married and living together and doing business together in 1863! When in the South, Black people were still slaves, here there was a community where people were living and loving together. It spoke to me.\n\nAP: You are also an immigrant directing a show about immigrants. How did this inform the process?\n\nKAUFMAN: Well, that was another way into the material. Like a lot of immigrants, we arrive here with a dream, with an expectation of what we want our lives to be like. And we have this whole mythology of what America provides and what one is able to do in America. And invariably, whether you succeed or you fail, you have to confront the reality of America. There\u2019s always a gap between the reality of America and the dream of America. I think that the poorer you are, the distance between that reality and that image widens. So, of course, it\u2019s much harder for a poor person to come to America and realize their dreams than it is for a wealthy person to come to America and realize their dreams. I don\u2019t know, there was something about these immigrants arriving in this country and then finding community with the least likely of partners that really spoke to me.\n\nAP: What was the biggest challenge of directing this show?\n\nKAUFMAN: The biggest challenge was that we knew that we wanted to tell an epic story. You don\u2019t see musicals of this size on Broadway anymore or on the West End. You know, they\u2019re un-producible \u2014 36 actors on stage, 10 more actors off stage just being standbys, an orchestra of 50 people. It is a very big musical. At times we felt like, who do we want the audience to fall in love with and follow for the course of the play when you have so many characters? And how do you craft it in a way that you can follow all of them, and that you can follow the intricacies of this historical musical?\n\nAP: Joaquina Kalukango gets a standing ovation before the show even ends \u2014 after \u201cLet It Burn.\u201d What can you tell me about her? Do you ever worry she might get sick?\n\nKAUFMAN: We have two understudies for her, and they\u2019re both very good. But Joaquina \u2014 every so often a monster arrives at the theater and that\u2019s her, she\u2019s a theatrical monster. And in real life she\u2019s the most unassuming person in the world. She\u2019s a Juilliard graduate, she\u2019s a brilliant actor, and she can sing like that. It\u2019s just an astonishing thing to watch.\n\nAP: \u201cParadise Square\u201d happens in the 1800s, but it is still very relevant. What is the most important message that people can get from this musical today?\n\nKAUFMAN: I\u2019m always a little afraid of that question, because I feel that if I tell you the message that I want people to get, I am denying the audience part of the fun, which is for them to figure out what they see in the play. But what I can tell you is that what interested me is to see how deep the roots of our divisions are, and to see what are the forces that keep fueling those divisions. You know, America is a melting pot where nothing ever melted. So how do we aspire to a more perfect union? I think that the answer to that is by really understanding what are the things that tear us apart, and the play talks a lot about that.\n\n___\n\nSigal Ratner-Arias is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/sigalratner."}, {"url": "https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/moises-kaufman-brings-to-ny-whole-new-seven-deadly-sins/3137526/", "page_content": "What to Know \"Seven Deadly Sins\" opened Tuesday in Manhattan's meatpacking district.\n\nThe play, directed by Mois\u00e9s Kaufman, is based off a theatrical production created in Miami during COVID-19.\n\nKaufman hopes the show's usage of COVID-19 regulations and format will remain after the pandemic.\n\nIt started last fall in a series of vacant storefronts along an iconic Miami Beach thoroughfare as a safe way to offer theater during the coronavirus pandemic.

He founded his theater company, The Tectonic Theater Project, in 1991 with his now-husband Jeffrey LaHoste.\n\n\u201cWe started it in the dining room of our apartment.

Moises Kaufman. The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images\n\nUsing this technique, Kaufman wrote and directed Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde in 1997. This off-Broadway play, which The New York Times called \u201cabsolutely gripping,\u201d utilized actual testimony and transcripts from the trials of the iconic Wilde. Kaufman won a Lambda Literary Award, an award given for works that explore LGBT themes, for \"Gross Indecency\" in 1998.\n\nThat same year, just three months after the brutal murder of gay student Matthew Shepard, Kaufman took his theater group to Laramie, Wyoming to interview people in the town where the killing had taken place. They conducted over 200 interviews, totaling 400 hours, and the company then used these oral histories to write The Laramie Project.\n\n\u201cThe community was in shock,\u201d Kaufman recalled. \u201cThey never expected a murder like that to occur in their midst. We managed to capture, I think, something of the rawness and the experience the town was having at that time.\u201d\n\nKaufman and his siblings. Moises Kaufman\n\nActress Mercedes Herrero, who collaborated in the creation of \"The Laramie Project,\" described the process as \u201cpretty extraordinary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came from the Stanislavski (acting) tradition,\u201d Herrero said. \u201cMois\u00e9s was using this experimental form, not only gathering interviews, but also literally writing current events as they were happening. This was a new kind of theater to me, and it was mind-blowing.\u201d Herrero, who co-stars in House of Cards, added that working with Kaufman has made her \u201ca more politically aware being.\u201d\n\n\"The Laramie Project,\" about the town\u2019s reaction to Shepard\u2019s brutal killing, went on to become one of the most acclaimed plays of the year, and one of the most-produced works of the decade. It has been performed worldwide, and is often used to educate people about homophobia and anti-LGBT violence. It was also made into an HBO film written and directed by Kaufman.\n\nJudy Shepard, the mother of Matthew Shepard, told NBC News that \"The Laramie Project\" was very special to her. \u201cI think everybody can relate to an actor who is on stage. The audience is seeing somebody who is like them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt brings home how differently we all feel about things, and how we respond to things.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt (the play) is not specifically about Matt,\u201d Shepard pointed out. \u201cBut it shows how society looks when we don\u2019t accept each other for who we are. It shows what happens when we are at odds with each other for no reason.\u201d\n\nShepard said that she hears from people all over the country who have \u201ccome out\u201d as LGBT after seeing or having been a part of the play.\n\n\u201cPeople say to me, are you a Latino writer?

Are you a gay writer? Are you a Jewish writer? And I say yes to all,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I am any good at what I do, then I\u2019m a Latino writer and I am a Jewish writer and I\u2019m a gay writer, and I\u2019m a New York writer. And I\u2019m a writer of all the things that I am as a human being.\u201d\n\nStill, Kaufman said that LGBT youth continue to face challenging circumstances as they grow up. \u201cAnyone who has ever had the experience of coming out will tell you that it is a process. It is a process for the person coming out, and for the people you are coming out to,\u201d he said.

Moises Kaufman\n\nAlthough Kaufman describes his mother and late father as \u201cvery proud and supportive\u201d of his work, he stressed that young LGBT kids often struggle with acceptance. \u201cThe question of whether things are getting better for LGBT youth is a complicated one,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, yes, they are getting better. Having said that, there is an epidemic of bullying in high school, especially against LGBT kids,\u201d Kaufman continued, mentioning the high rates of suicide and depression among LGBT youth.\n\n\u201cSo I think that yes, things are getting better,\" said the playwright. \"But there is still a lot of work to do.\u201d\n\nFollow NBC News Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/moises-kaufman", "page_content": "Spring Preview\n\nJoaquina Kalukango Isn\u2019t Afraid to Speak Up Anymore\n\nBefore leading her first Broadway musical in \u201cParadise Square,\u201d she had long deferred to others in the rehearsal room \u2014 until she realized how much she has to share."}, {"url": "https://cms.shakespearetheatre.org/watch-listen/highlighting-playwright-moises-kaufman/", "page_content": "Highlighting Playwright Mois\u00e9s Kaufman\n\nMois\u00e9s Kaufman\n\nMois\u00e9s Kaufman is an award-winning Venezuelan playwright, theatre director, filmmaker, and teacher. He was born in Caracas to Orthodox Jewish parents and is of Ukrainian and Romanian descent. Kaufman\u2019s work is heavily influenced by his identity as a gay, Jewish man.\n\nIn 1985, he got his BA in Business Administration at the Metropolitan University in Caracas where he joined a touring experimental theatre group. He then relocated to New York to study theatre directing at the Tisch School of the Arts.\n\nIn 1991 he founded the Tectonic Theater Project, a theatre group based in New York City that develops productions focused on political and social issues. Their ideas stem from the collaboration of diverse individuals as well as extensive research on a multitude of topics.\n\nKaufman is an activist at heart and his company has created a plethora of plays and musicals that take on social and political issues that are relevant to modern audiences. His work includes Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde, 33 Variations, and The Laramie Project, among others.\n\nHis Broadway work includes directing plays such as the Pulitzer Prize finalist Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo by Rajiv Joseph (starring Robin Williams), Doug Wright\u2019s Pulitzer and Tony Award-winning play I Am My Own Wife (starring Jefferson Mays and earning Kaufman a Tony Award nomination for Best Direction of a Play), Harvey Fierstein\u2019s Torch Song, The Heiress by Ruth and Augustus Goetz (starring Jessica Chastain), and even his own play 33 Variations (starring Jane Fonda).\n\nThe Laramie Project is among the most performed plays in the country. The collaboratively written piece is a response to the brutal and senseless killing of Matthew Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming student. The murder took place in Laramie, Wyoming. Kaufman and his team at the Tectonic Theater Project interviewed family, friends, neighbors, and more within the small town of Laramie and their words are front and center in this documentary-style theatre production. This high-profile hate crime was one of many turning points in the LGBTQ+ community and inspired not only plays, but songs, films, novels, and other forms of media.\n\nIn September of 2016, Kaufman was awarded the National Medal of Arts and Humanities by President Barack Obama. He is the first Venezuelan to receive this award.

Now Mois\u00e9s Kaufman has brought \u201cSeven Deadly Sins\u201d to New York City, with seven new short plays about pride, greed, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony and sloth.\n\nOriginally conceived by Michel Hausmann for Miami New Drama, the new show \u2014 produced by Tectonic Theater Project and Madison Wells Live \u2014 officially opened Tuesday in Manhattan\u2019s Meatpacking District for a \u201cstrictly limited engagement\u201d that has already been extended one week, through July 25.\n\n\u201cI think that one of the greatest joys has been seeing the audiences' faces eager and so hungry to be back. That\u2019s been incredibly rewarding,\u201d Kaufman, who directs and wrote the play about greed, told The Associated Press on Thursday in a phone interview. \u201cYou see how much they missed it.

The show arrives while the city\u2019s theater community is making steps toward reopening after the pandemic.\n\nThe new playwrights are Ngozi Anyanwu (Gluttony,) Thomas Bradshaw (Sloth,) MJ Kaufman (Pride,) Jeffrey LaHoste (Envy,) Ming Peiffer (Wrath) and Bess Wohl (Lust.) Performers include Tricia Alexandro, Shuga Cain, Shavanna Calder, movement artist Donna Carnow, Shamika Cotton, Brandon J. Ellis, Brad Fleischer, Andrew Keenan-Bolger, Kahyun Kim, Morgan McGhee, Caitlin O\u2019Connell, Cody Sloan, Eric Ulloa and Bianca Norwood.\n\nOf his own piece, Kaufman said: \u201cIt\u2019s a family comedy about how greed has a way of kind of tearing down even the nicest of families. I wanted to do greed because, unfortunately, it\u2019s one of the most common sins.\u201d\n\nTo maintain COVID-19 safety, ticket holders are socially distanced and masks are required. Actors stand behind a glass barrier to isolate themselves from their colleagues, the audience and production staff.\n\nKaufman, a Venezuelan artist based in New York City who's best known for \u201cThe Laramie Project\u201d and has received awards including the National Medal of Arts from president Barack Obama in 2016, is set to direct the Broadway musical \u201cParadise Square\u201d next year.\n\nHe is hopeful that people will go back to the theaters \u201cvery quickly\u201d when the curtains rise again.
