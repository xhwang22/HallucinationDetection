E. Afigbo, Obi Ikenga: The Case for a Pan-Igbo Centre for Igbo Studies(Uturu, Nigeria: Abia State University, 2000).\n\nThe Ahiajoku Lecture Series, which was inaugurated on November 30, 1979, was designed to offer the Igbo a rare opportunity to annually gather and harness the intellectual richness of the people through public lectures by the most erudite of Igbo scholars. It is an annual intellectual harvest in which a distinguished Igbo scholar is selected to educate and share an important aspect of Igbo life and culture related to the lecturer\u2019s expertise. Thus, Ahiajoku lecturers have focused on Igbo political, economic, cultural, social, technological, philosophical and historical experiences, as well as the people\u2019s interactions and encounters with non-Igbo ethnic groups in Nigeria, and with the Europeans. It is an occasion to celebrate the collective Igbo achievements.\n\nFor more information on this Directorate, see Arthur A.

It is expected of an effective teacher or professor to strive to accommodate his or her students\u2019 individual differences and needs. But Afigbo was not for the mediocre or even average students. You must be above average and hardworking in order to survive Afigbo\u2019s scrutiny. The author started her doctoral thesis with Professor Afigbo, but did not complete the work with him due to no fault of theirs. Afigbo and the author worked very hard to complete the thesis, but it was not possible due to his retirement from the university in 1992.\n\nSee, for instance, E. Isichei, A History of the Igbo People(London: Macmillan, 1976), xiv. Here, she thanked Afigbo for the material he lent her and for giving her \u201cthe most unstinted and generous encouragement in a field of study which he has done so much to transform.\u201d\n\nBooks published by Adiele Afigbo, The Abolition of the Slave Trade in Southeastern Nigeria, 1885\u20131950(Rochester, NY: University of Rochester Press, 2006); The Igbo and their Neighbours: Inter-Group Relations in Southeastern Nigeria to 1953(Ibadan, Nigeria: University Press Limited, 1987); with S.

This prejudicial characterization of the region and the period suggests a lawless and unstable atmosphere incapable of fostering any meaningful commercial and intergroup exchanges. Yet, historical accounts have shown that the Aro, Awka, Abiriba, Nkwerre, Aboh, Nike, Nri, Igala, Ijo, Bonny, Nembe, Brass and the Efik triumphed in their business careers before the 1900.\n\nFor the practice of Igbandu, see Felicia Ekejiuba, \u201cIgba Ndu: An Igbo Mechanism of Social Control and Adjustment,\u201d African Notes8, no. 1 (1972): 9\u201324.\n\nSee Richard Henderson, The King in Every Man: Evolutionary Trends in Onitsha Ibo Society and Culture(New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1972); Austin Shelton, The Igbo-Igala Borderland: Religion and Social Control in Indigenous African Colonialism(Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1971); and John Boston, \u201cNotes on Contact between the Igala and the Ibo,\u201d Journal of the Historical Society of Nigeria2, no. 1 (1960): 52\u201358 on the impact of Igala culture on Nsukka Igbo; Basden, Niger Ibos on the Ijo and the conquest of southern Igbo; Mervin D.

Themes emphasized include pre-colonial and colonial history, inter-group relations, the Aro and the slave trade (1), the art and science of history in Africa, non-written-sources and the reconstruction of African history, history and nation-building.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAdiele Eberechukwu Afigbo is a Nigerian historian. He was made a historian by the men and forces that gave birth in the 1950s to the celebrated Ibadan School of History which for about three decades was the most prominent school of history in Africa. He developed to become a prominent member of that school, which devoted its time to preaching and demonstrating the possibility of and the necessity for African history and historiography as a specific genre of the world branch of knowledge known as history. In pursuing the mission of this school through teaching, research, writing and publication Adiele Afigbo produced a wide variety of works which established inter alia the possibilities of basic reconstructionist history, of African historical methodologies and of the close link between the art and science of history on the one hand and state formation and statecraft on the other. In the process he gave full rein to eclecticism with respect to sources and methods, using as the occasion demands and warrants elements from myth and other oral sources, from archaeology, linguistics, material artifacts and written sources (2). In the last analysis he defines a historian as a clinical student of human experience who seeks to tell the story as it is and to explain it. With respect to style and presentation he believes in lively narrative and analysis while heeding Aristotle's advice which says write in the language of the ordinary man but think like an intellectual.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nAdiele Eberechukwu Afigbo was born at Ihube, Okigwe , in present day Imo State . His formal education began in 1944 at the then famous Ihube Methodist Central School, Ihube where he came under the influence of remarkably dedicated teachers, the most outstanding of whom was Mr. Oji Iheukumere, the head teacher, a native of Uzuakoli, in today's Abia State who was a noted church musician and disciplinarian. At Ihube Central School Afigbo's brilliance manifested early which made his teachers to encourage him to go to a secondary school in spite of the opposition of his parents who were intimidated by the cost of post-primary education. He succeeded in his bid and went to St. Augustine's (CMS) Grammar School, Nkwerre Orlu in Imo State. with an Okigwe Native Administration scholarship won in a competitive examination. There again he came across a crop of dedicated teachers who left a definite imprint on him. Crying for mention are Mazi F,C. Ogbalu, a teacher of Igbo language and Culture and the founder of the famous Society for Promoting Igbo Language and Culture, Mr. C.G.I. Eneli a history graduate of the University College, Ibadan and Mr, E,C. Ezekwesili, the principal of the college and a history graduate of the University of Southampton, UK. These three helped to determine his future academic career. From St. Augustine's Grammar School Afigbo gained admission to the University College Ibadan with a scholarship from the government of Eastern Nigeria to read history under the then obtaining special relationship with the University of London . There again, he met remarkable scholars noted for their brilliance and beneficent influence \u2013 J.D. Omer-Cooper, J.C. Anene, J.F. Ade Ajayi and K.O. Dike. There were also his colleagues \u2013 Obaro Ikime and Philip Igbafe who not only read history with him, but with him went on to pioneer the \u201cmade in Nigeria PhD\u201d at the infant University of Ibadan with the help of post-graduate scholarship awarded by the university to the best graduating students. Adiele Afigbo had not only come on top of his class at the B.A. level, but also was the first of these colleagues to finish his Ph.D and thus the first to receive the Ph.D. degree from an indigenous Nigerian university since the world began! For this reason some of his friends refer to him as \u201ca national specimen\u201d\n\nEarly career\n\nOn obtaining the Ph.D. Adiele Afigbo was appointed a lecturer in his parent department of history, a position he held for two years before fleeing to the University of Nigeria , Nsukka in the wake of the Nigerian civil war. During the duration of hostilities he served in the Directorate for Propaganda of the Ministry of Information, Republic of Biafra. He promptly resumed his interrupted academic duties after the war and rose very fast on the academic ladder \u2013 Lecturer to Senior Lecturer in History in 1970 and Senior Lecturer to Professor in 1972, thus reaching the top of his profession after only five years input as an academic. He has been heard to jocosely complain that in all his working career he has had only two promotions! A year after attaining to professorship he was appointed the Head of the Department of History and Archaeology. The year after he became also the Dean of the Faculty of Arts. On more than one occasion he held the Directorship of the Leo Hansbury Institute of African Studies. At different times in the following years he held the following public appointments among others \u2013 pioneer Director of Research at the National Institute for policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru, Jos; Commissioner first for Education and then for Local Government in the Government of Imo State; Chairman of the Michael Okpara College of Agriculture, Umuagwo in Imo State and Sole Administrator of the Alvan Ikoku College of Education, Owerri. He has also won many coveted academic honours : Honorary Member of the Historical Association of Great Britain, Fellow of the Historical Society of Nigeria, the Nigerian National Order of Merit, the (foundation) Fellowship of the Nigerian Academy of Letters. His traditional chieftaincy titles include Ogbute-Okewe-Ibe, Ogbuzuo, and Olaudah.\n\nWork as historian\n\nAny attempt to understand the work of Adiele Eberechukwu Afigbo as a historian must be made at many levels and from different directions. On the territorial level he is a historian of Africa, a historian of Nigeria, a historian of Southeastern Nigeria (3) and finally a historian of the Igbo. On the disciplinary front he is a political historian, an economic and social historian as well as a peculiarly fecund student of historiography. Myth, History and Society, one of the three volumes of his essays edited by Professor Toyin Falola is devoted to theorising on the methods of doing history in Africa, on the sources of history in Africa, on the place and purpose of history in Africa and other related issues (4). In many publications he sought to use the particular to illuminate the universal, and the universal to illuminate the particular. Thus, for instance, he used a detailed study of the textile process in Southern Nigeria to throw much helpful light on the socio-cultural dynamics of the societies of the region. In a similar manner he used the rise and expansion of the pre-colonial great states such as Benin to show that the so-called segmentary societies as well as the so-called mini-states of pre-colonial Africa are, among other things, fossilized reminders of the conditions from which the great states arose.\n\nAdiele Eberechukwu Afigbo broke away early from the action-reaction thesis that ruled the new African historiography when he joined the history profession. He did so by emphasizing in his works basic reconstructionist history, the study of peoples and cultures in their own right instead of, as he put it, seeking to put the battle dress of Saul on his little David; the study of inter-group relations as a fruitful approach to understanding pre-colonial African societies; the dynamic and multi-faceted character of myths and traditions and thus the need for scholars to adapt their methods accordingly; the recognition of historical studies as a form of statecraft while not making history the slave of politics and politicians (5). Perhaps it is this richly diversified approach to history, to historical studies and historical sources that helps to explain the range and volume of his publications which some of his colleagues have found astounding bearing in mid the environment of lack and deprivation in which African academics operate.\n\nWorks\n\n* The Warrant Chiefs: Indirect Rule in Southeastern Nigeria 1891-1929 (Longman, London, 1972\n\n* Ropes of Sand: Studies in Igbo History and Culture (University Press Limited, Ibadan 1981)\n\n* The Igbo and Their Neighbours: Inter-group Relations In Southeastern Nigeria to 1953 (University Press Limited, Ibadan, 1987)\n\n* Groundwork of Igbo History (Vista Books Limited, Lagos,1992)\n\n* Image of the Igbo (vista Books Limited, Lagos, 1992)\n\n* The Abolition of the Slave Trade in Southeastern Nigeria 1885-1950 (University of Rochester Press, 2006)\n\nCollected Works Edited by Toyin Falola\n\n* Nigerian History Politics and Affairs (Africa World Press, Trenton New Jersey, 2005)\n\n* Igbo History and Society (Africa World Press, Trenton New Jersey, 2005)\n\n* Myth, History and Society (Africa World Press, Trenton New Jersey, 2006)\n\nReferences\n\n* Ottenberg, S., Farmers and Townspeople in A Changing Nigeria (Spectrum Books Ltd, Ibadan, 2005) pp.32-33, 50, 54, 84,101\n\nNorthrup, D.

Themes emphasized include pre-colonial and colonial history, inter-group relations, the Aro and the slave trade (1), the art and science of history in Africa, non-written-sources and the reconstruction of African history, history and nation-building.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAdiele Eberechukwu Afigbo is a Nigerian historian. He was made a historian by the men and forces that gave birth in the 1950s to the celebrated Ibadan School of History which for about three decades was the most prominent school of history in Africa. He developed to become a prominent member of that school, which devoted its time to preaching and demonstrating the possibility of and the necessity for African history and historiography as a specific genre of the world branch of knowledge known as history. In pursuing the mission of this school through teaching, research, writing and publication Adiele Afigbo produced a wide variety of works which established inter alia the possibilities of basic reconstructionist history, of African historical methodologies and of the close link between the art and science of history on the one hand and state formation and statecraft on the other. In the process he gave full rein to eclecticism with respect to sources and methods, using as the occasion demands and warrants elements from myth and other oral sources, from archaeology, linguistics, material artifacts and written sources (2). In the last analysis he defines a historian as a clinical student of human experience who seeks to tell the story as it is and to explain it. With respect to style and presentation he believes in lively narrative and analysis while heeding Aristotle's advice which says write in the language of the ordinary man but think like an intellectual.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nAdiele Eberechukwu Afigbo was born at Ihube, Okigwe , in present day Imo State . His formal education began in 1944 at the then famous Ihube Methodist Central School, Ihube where he came under the influence of remarkably dedicated teachers, the most outstanding of whom was Mr. Oji Iheukumere, the head teacher, a native of Uzuakoli, in today's Abia State who was a noted church musician and disciplinarian. At Ihube Central School Afigbo's brilliance manifested early which made his teachers to encourage him to go to a secondary school in spite of the opposition of his parents who were intimidated by the cost of post-primary education. He succeeded in his bid and went to St. Augustine's (CMS) Grammar School, Nkwerre Orlu in Imo State. with an Okigwe Native Administration scholarship won in a competitive examination. There again he came across a crop of dedicated teachers who left a definite imprint on him. Crying for mention are Mazi F,C. Ogbalu, a teacher of Igbo language and Culture and the founder of the famous Society for Promoting Igbo Language and Culture, Mr. C.G.I. Eneli a history graduate of the University College, Ibadan and Mr, E,C. Ezekwesili, the principal of the college and a history graduate of the University of Southampton, UK. These three helped to determine his future academic career. From St. Augustine's Grammar School Afigbo gained admission to the University College Ibadan with a scholarship from the government of Eastern Nigeria to read history under the then obtaining special relationship with the University of London . There again, he met remarkable scholars noted for their brilliance and beneficent influence \u2013 J.D. Omer-Cooper, J.C. Anene, J.F. Ade Ajayi and K.O. Dike. There were also his colleagues \u2013 Obaro Ikime and Philip Igbafe who not only read history with him, but with him went on to pioneer the \u201cmade in Nigeria PhD\u201d at the infant University of Ibadan with the help of post-graduate scholarship awarded by the university to the best graduating students.

Ironically, Blyden married a mulatto\u2014Sarah Yates, in 1856\u2014whom he accused of having more loyalty to her mulatto community than to her husband. He had an unhappy private life, which affected his personality: he regarded his wife semiliterate who had no capacity for intellectual growth but was always complaining; had three children with her who showed little intellectual ability; and he blamed these problems and the fact that one of his daughters was retarded for marrying \u201coutside his race.\u201d He was disliked by African Americans for being a divisive figure in their community due to his hatred against mulattoes; his close association with the American Colonization Society; and his campaign for them to abandon the civil rights movement and embrace the repatriation to Liberia.

Subsequently, a party of three Igbo led by Rev. E. Jones (first Black American college graduate) left for Nigeria but failed to accomplish their goal. See Elizabeth Isichei, A History of the Igbo People(London: Macmillan Press, 1976), 70.\n\nSimon Jonas was an ex-Igbo slave and the veteran of the 1841 and 1854 Niger Missions. He stationed at Aboh since 1841, teaching children and others who came to him about the gospel, a pioneering work, which should earn him the recognition as the first apostle of the Igbo. Other nineteenth-century repatriate Igbo who pursued mission work in Igbo homeland were Thomas Samuel of the CMS and Augustine Radillo, a Baptist deacon.\n\nBasden, Among the Ibos, 289.\n\nIgbo recaptives in Regent, Sierra Leone, one of the settlements for recaptured slaves, formed an Igbo Association under the leadership of William Pratt for Christian evangelical work in Igbo homeland.\n\nAn example was David Okparabietoa Pepple of Igbo origin, who was sold into slavery in Ohumbele, was ordained a deacon and later became a pastor in that town. See Isichei, A History of the Igbo, 161. There was also Ucheya Aju Ucheya of Okoko Item, who was sold to Albert Hart of the Niger Delta as a boy, was renamed Emmanuel Hart, later gained the leadership of his master\u2019s house, converted to Christianity and was responsible at the age of 20 years for the establishment of the Methodist Church at Item. Before his death at the age of 26 years, Hart had trained students and disciples who carried out the work of Methodist evangelization to Aba, Alayi and Mbawsi.\n\nFor studies on the introduction of Christianity and Christian evangelism in Igbo region, see Ogbu Kalu, The Embattled Gods: Christianization of Igboland, 1841\u20131991(Trenton, NJ: Africa World Press, 2003); Shed N.

Babs Fafunwa, History of Education in Nigeria(London: George Allen and Unwin, 1974); Ayandele, The Missionary Impact.\n\nThe Igbo acceptance of Christianity was a gradual process. While Christian teachings resonated with the lowly in Igbo society\u2014ex-slaves, women, the poor and the needy\u2014the traditional elite and title holders reluctantly embraced the new religion. The missionary condemnation of Igbo religious beliefs and cultural practices, such as polygyny, made their religion unattractive to the people. However, Eze OnyekaOmeli Idigo of Aguleri, and Eze Nzedegwu of Ossomari were instrumental to the establishment of Christian missions in their respective communities. There was also Alexander Ubuechi of Issele who converted to Catholicism when he was already a diviner, title man and skilled craftsman and his commitment to the mission earned him the missionary acclamation of a saint when he died in 1903. Another example was Nwafor Ogwuma of Arochukwu, a successful slave dealer and polygamist, who later assisted Rev. Rankin and later J. A. T. Beattie to establish a Presbyterian mission at the town in 1907. He was among those Igbo who helped Archdeacon T. J. Dennis in the translation of the Igbo Union Bible.\n\nElizabeth Isichei, The Ibo People and the Europeans: The Genesis of a Relationship To 1906(New York: St. Martin\u2019s Press, 1973), 146 and 150.\n\nElizabeth Isichei, Entirely for God: The Life of Michael Iwene Tansi(London: Macmillan Education, 1980)\n\nThe most prominent Igbo priest is Cardinal Francis Arinze, who became the first youngest bishop in 1965 at the age of 33 years, and the first \u201cBlack\u201d archbishop of Onitsha (1967\u20131985). He has sought to incorporate aspects of Igbo religious practices into the Nigerian Catholicism. An author of several books on interfaith dialogue and peace, and as the president of the Pontifical Council for Inter-religious Dialogue in Rome (1984\u20132002), Cardinal Arinze has tirelessly worked to bridge the gap between Catholicism and other religions and faiths, while maintaining an uncompromising position against such social issues as birth control and abortion.

In recognition of his contribution to the development of education in Nigeria, the federal government prints his portrait on the ten naira bill (the country\u2019s currency), and a tertiary institution\u2014Alvan Ikoku College of Education, Owerri, was named after him.

The process of developing \u201cStandard\u201d Igbo has been a very long and treacherous one. The development stages include the Igbo Esperanto or Isuama Igbo (1841\u20131872), The Union Igbo (1905\u20131939), Central Igbo (1939\u20131972) and the Standard Igbo (since 1973). In spite of their deficiencies, credit should be given to such early foreign missionaries and Saro Igbo as J. P. Schon, John C. Taylor, Solomon Perry, Samuel Crowther, A. Ganot and Thomas John Dennis as well as to such Igbo experts as Frederick Chidozie Ogbalu and H. I. Nnaji. Ogbalu was a panIgbo nationalist educator and language enthusiast, who founded in 1949 the Society for Promoting Igbo Language and Culture (SPILC) under whose leadership the Standard Igbo was produced in 1973.

He was one of the founders of the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs. Eni Njoku (1917\u20131974) distinguished himself as an educator and university administrator, who served as vice-chancellor of the University of Lagos, Nigeria (1962\u20131965), and of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, in 1966. Chike Obi (1921\u20132008), an educator and renowned international mathematician, studied in both United Kingdom and United States of America in the 1930s and early 1940s, who upon return to Nigeria, taught mathematics at the University of Ibadan (1950s\u20131960s) and the University of Lagos (1970\u20131985).\n\nPita Nwana, Omenuko (London: Longmans, 1933); D.

While these three classic authors laid the foundation for the modern Igbo novel, Nwana is regarded as the father of the Igbo novel. With five Igbo novels published between 1973 and 1975, Tony Ubesie is noted as the most gifted Igbo novelist in the twentieth century. Similarly, Cyprian Ekwensi, the most prolific and versatile Igbo-Nigerian writer and one of the most prolific of modern African writers, is held as the father of the modern Nigerian novel; his first four works When Love Whispers; The Leopard\u2019s Claw; Ikolo the Wrestler; and People of the Citywere published between 1947 and 1954.

Even though Afigbo sounds a note of caution that Ajayi\u2019s book came out only three years (1965) after the release of Dike\u2019s pamphlet (1962), there is no doubt that Dike\u2019s work inspired others. While the pamphlet in question was a paper Dike read at the Centenary of the Mission at Christ Church, Onitsha, on November 13, 1957, Ajayi\u2019s book is a revised version of his PhD thesis presented to London University in 1958. But the book was published under the Ibadan History Series, when Dike was the general editor and therefore must have benefited from Dike\u2019s expertise. See F.
