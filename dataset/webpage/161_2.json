He was 94.\n\nMiller pitched for 10 seasons in the major leagues, all with the Phillies, from 1949-58 \u2014 sandwiched between two stints at Detroit, the first as a player, the latter as a coach.\n\n\"What my dad told me not too long ago, he said, 'I've lived a charmed life, I got to live my dream from a little kid, which was to play pro baseball,\" said Bob Miller Jr., one of Miller's four children.\n\n\"Nothing was more important to my dad than baseball and U of D.\"\n\nOne of his best seasons was 1950, when he was 11-6 with a 3.57 ERA in 35 games, 21 of which were starts, as the Phillies went 91-63 to win the National League. Fellow pitcher Curt Simmons is the last surviving member of that Phillies team. (Another teammate on that cast-of-characters squad, late first baseman Eddie Waitkus, was said to be an inspiration for Robert Redford's character in \"The Natural\" \u2014 having been shot by a fan at a hotel early in his career.)\n\nIn 1950, Miller recorded seven complete games and two shutouts, finishing second in National League rookie-of-the-year voting, to the Boston Braves' Sam Jethroe. Miller also made one start in the 1950 World Series, lasting two-thirds of an inning in the must-win Game 4 of the Yankees' eventual sweep. That was the lone postseason appearance of his career, which spanned 261 games, 68 of which were starts. He was mostly a reliever the rest of his career, and even closed games late in his career.\n\nA 6-foot-3, 190-pound right-hander, he threw a shutout and had four hits in a game in 1953 at Chicago's Wrigley Field, the only man ever to do that at that historic ballpark. Also in 1953, Miller was the reliever who took over in the eighth inning of a game started by Michigan State alum and future Hall-of-Famer Robin Roberts, who was working on a 28-game complete-game streak.\n\nMiller pitched in the minor leagues in 1959, for the Phillies and Los Angeles Dodgers (he also briefly was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals, but never pitched for them in the minors or majors), before retiring.\n\nIn 1963, he took a job as an assistant coach for the University of Detroit baseball team.\n\nHis boss, head coach Lloyd Brazil, died in a car accident in 1965 and Miller took over as head coach, a job he held through the 2001 season. During his tenure, Miller's teams were was 896-780-2, his wins ranking in the top 30 in NCAA history, and tops for any baseball coach in Michigan.\n\nUnder Miller, Detroit had winning seasons 25 of 36 years, making the NCAA Tournament in 1965 and winning a school-record 36 games in 1975. In 1997, it won its first Midwestern Collegiate Conference.\n\nSixteen Detroit players were drafted by MLB during Miller's coaching tenure, including son Pat in 1990, and two of them made the major leagues, Pete Craig and Dick Drago. His son Bob Jr. also played for him.\n\nThe job wasn't just coaching. He also mowed the baseball field's grass, laid the chalk, raked the field, and ran the tractor. He never had a paid assistant coach, so he did all the recruiting himself.\n\n\"He made hardly any money, and worked 60 hours a week,\" Bob Miller Jr. said. \"He did it all himself, and he gladly did it because he loved U of D.\"\n\nMiller retired after the 2001 season; in 2004, Detroit Mercy baseball was cut because of budget issues.\n\nMiller played three sports at St. Mary's of Redford, including football and basketball. He had basketball scholarship offers, but out of high school he served four years in the U.S. Army, including in World War II. After his armed-services career, he attended Detroit Mercy and pitched two seasons, 1947-48. As a freshman, he was 3-2 with a 2.34 ERA; sophomore season, he had three wins. The Phillies then signed him.\n\nMiller is a member of the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame (1999) and Detroit Mercy's Hall of Fame (1979). He was scheduled to be inducted to the Michigan Baseball of Fame, along with former Michigan quarterback Drew Henson, in August, but the ceremony was canceled because of COVID-19.\n\nMiller died of natural causes, and lived in West Bloomfield. He is survived by his four children, Thomas, Bob, Mary and Patrick. His wife, Maureen, died 20 years ago.\n\nFuneral arrangements were pending Saturday afternoon, and a celebration of life will take place in 2021.\n\ntpaul@detroitnews.com\n\nTwitter: @tonypaul1984"}, {"url": "https://michigansportshof.org/inductee/bob-miller/", "page_content": "Robert John (Bob) Miller\n\nAffiliation: U of D Baseball\n\nU of D Baseball Player\n\nU of D Baseball Manager (1965 - 2000)\n\nDetroit Mercy Titans Athletic Hall of Fame\n\nAdditional Affiliation: Philadelphia Phillies Player (1949 \u2013 1958)\n\nRobert John (Bob) Miller\n\nU of D Baseball Player\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies Player (1949 \u2013 1958)\n\nU of D Baseball Manager (1965 \u2013 2000)\n\nBob Miller was born in Detroit, Michigan and served in the U.S. Army during World War II.

Vowels, Jr.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow #DetroitsCollegeTeam: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | YouTube\n\nThe University of Detroit Mercy Department of Athletics is in deep mourning as it learned that former player, longtime baseball coach and former major league baseball player Bob Miller passed away on Saturday night due to natural causes.Coach Miller was 94 years old.After serving four years in the military after an outstanding prep career, he pitched two seasons for the Titans from 1947-48 before signing with the Philadelphia Phillies. As a freshman, he was 3-2 with a 2.34 ERA and then collected another three wins as a sophomore.After his professional days were over, he came back to his alma mater as an assistant coach in 1963 before taking the reins in 1965 following the tragic auto accident that took the life of head coach Lloyd Brazil, his college coach. That turned into 36 years of greatness as he guided his alma mater from 1965 to 2001 recording an 896-780-2 mark, top 30 in NCAA history when he retired and still the most by any coach in the state of Michigan.The Titans tallied winning seasons in 25 of his 36 years - including reaching 30 victories nine times with a school-record 36 victories in 1975 - reaching the NCAA Tournament in 1965 and claiming its first-ever MCC baseball championship in 1997.During his time, 16 Titans were drafted by the MLB, including his son Pat in 1990, while over 40 other players signed professional contracts. Two of the players he coached made the major league in Pete Craig (1966) and Dick Drago (1969).He signed with Philadelphia in 1948 and enjoyed a 10-year career with the Phillies, appearing in 261 games, starting 69, and going 42\u201342 with 15 saves and a 3.96 ERA.In two years in the minors, he was 6-5 with the Terre Haute Phillies of the Class-B Three I League in 1948 before dominating the 1949 season, earning the MVP after going 19-9 with a 2.72 ERA and striking out 207 in 255 innings.That sparked a call to the majors at the end of the 1949 season, where he pitched in three games, not allowing a run in 2 2/3 innings. At the age of 23, he made his MLB debut on September 16, 1949, at Crosley Field in Cincinnati throwing a scoreless eighth in a 2-1 loss.In 1950, he was a member of the Phillies' \"Whiz Kids\" that won the National League pennant as he went 11-6 and a save, throwing seven complete games and two shutouts and ending the season with a 3.57 ERA in 190.0 innings. He was second for the Rookie of the Year award behind Sam Jethroe of the Boston Braves. He was used primarily as a starter appearing in 25 games with 22 starts.He won his first game on Apr. 29, 1950, tossing a complete game in a 2-1 win at home over the Boston Braves, scattering six hits and striking out seven. Miller would start out with an 8-0 record as a rookie in 1950 and at one point had thrown 22 2/3 straight scoreless innings. He would also start game four of the world series that year against the New York Yankees.Miller was part of two historic moments in the 1953 season. First, he was the reliever who came into the game to for Philadelphia ace Robin Roberts, who was on his way to a major-league record 29 consecutive complete-game starts when he ran into trouble in the eighth against the Dodgers. Against the Cubs, he tossed a 7-0 complete game shutout giving up just six hits, but he was also 4-for-5 at the plate with two runs scored and a RBI, making him the only pitcher in baseball history to throw a shutout and get four hits in the same game at Wrigley Field.Miller was a three-sport star in high school, playing baseball, football and basketball at St. Mary's in Redford, Michigan, and actually earned a basketball scholarship to the University before pursuing baseball when he came back from the war.Miller has been inducted into a number of Hall of Fames in the Titan Hall Of Fame (1979), Michigan Sports Hall of Fame (1999) and the Michigan Baseball Hall Of Fame (2020). In 2011, he received the John Conti Letterman of Distinction Award, presented to former Titan varsity athletes who go above and beyond at work and in the community.Final arrangements are being made for family only, but a celebration of his life will be announced in the future.\"I was deeply hit when I heard the news of coach Miller passing. He was an icon here for so many years and touched so many players. I hear stories all the time of how much he meant to this University and how much he loved U-D. I have had the chance to talk to him and his kids since I have been here and something that always comes across is the love and pride for the University that the Miller family has. He will truly be missed by everyone.\" -\"The biggest thing was that I was a walk-on and he kept me on the team for a few years before I worked my way into the line-up. I was grateful that he kept me on the team and was fortunate that I was able to play and then get an invite to the Tigers in Lakeland (Florida). That was because he gave me that chance and saw something in me to keep me on the team. After I graduated, I realized how much time and money he put into the program all those years. He loved the program and he loved U-D.\"Coach Miller was a larger-than-life person to generations of Titan baseball players. He was the man that was watching from behind a distant fence at a remote ballpark on a hot and dusty summer evening, and when he saw a Titan, he knew it. Decades later, he could make a former player beam with pride by recalling that moment, 'I remember the first time I saw you swing that bat; he would say, and bring alive a detail of a ringing double in Redford or Livonia or East Detroit - and how he wouldn't leave your driveway that night until you told him you would be part of his team. He knew baseball before it could be measured. He loved the game and could feel it in his blood when it was time to squeeze a run in or when a struggling freshman needed a word of confidence. Coach also cherished his players and the University. He made teammates of us, linking generations, and captured an unforgettable era. He earned this legacy. But perhaps the thing I'll remember coach most for is how his children looked up to him and how proud he was of them. You could see it in their eyes and hear it in his unforgettable voice. I know I speak for all Titans in expressing our love and condolences to his family upon the loss of this legendary man.\" -\"I don't know what to say, this is so saddening. We use to drive cars to our games and my first year, we rode a lot with coach Miller and he was such a funny guy and a prankster. I will always remember how lively he was and he loved the school, he loved U-D. One day, I remember in practice, he was pitching to us and he said the way he was feeling right now, he was probably in his late 30's, that he hoped he didn't give up baseball too soon. He loved the game.\" -\"I owe a lot because of him, he was such a great coach and a great person. The way he and his wife made sandwiches when we were going on the road, it was about family. You realized what he put into that program and deserves all the credit he gets. He gave me the opportunity to walk-on and start at shortstop and he gave me a lot of confidence. When I coming out of high school, I wasn't going to college, but he gave me an opportunity and it was all because of him. He knew the game, loved the game and he made everything fun. In 1975, we won 36 games and should have got into the playoffs, but that was one of the best teams I have ever played on beating Eastern Michigan and Michigan State.\" -\"He gave me a great chance to play college baseball. He was a great guy and he probably had as much fun as any of the guys playing. I remember the day he came over to my house to recruit me and he walked in and it was like my uncle walking in. Here is Bob Miller, great coach, great pitcher and part of the Whiz Kids and he was part of the family and he the program a family. It was an easy sell.\" -Coach was a father figure to all of us. He didn't just teach us about baseball, he taught us about life and how to set ourselves up for success and preparation and living for the moment. More importantly and more than anything was just teaching us to be good men. I remember coach always being proud of the University and being proud of the field that he took care of so well. One of my fondest memories is seeing him on that John Deere tractor on the field, cutting the grass and make sure we had the best playing field possible for a small Division one college.This was just devastating. He was a great, great guy, a great coach and mentor and he meant everything to me. That booming voice, the presence he had whenever he walked in a room. He had that personality that everyone loved. He was good to everyone and it's quite a loss. He was everything to me, he gave me my chance, believed in me and gave me confidence and I will always be grateful for that. If you can live a life like him, that's the way to do it. He was a great family man, great baseball guy and couldn't ask for a better coach.\" -\"Playing for coach Miller was a huge honor. He took great care of us and treated every player equally and gave us a chance to play at Detroit Mercy and in Division one. Some of the stories he told us were incredible, just all the great memories he had with the game. Every time you came to the field, he had a new story for you,. Just a great memory he had with everyone he played with. He loved every ballplayer that put a U-D uniform on.\" -"}, {"url": "https://www.mlive.com/sports/2017/03/most_prominent_athlete_from_ea.html", "page_content": "By Scott DeCamp | sdecamp1@mlive.com\n\nOne of the best aspects of sports is reminiscing about legendary games and all-time athletes.\n\nWho doesn\u2019t enjoy a good debate over the best teams and players?\n\nAlong those lines, MLive tackled a whale of a sports project.

The quarterback was the state's first player to ever throw for more than 7,000 yards in a career and his 7,464 career passing yards was an MHSAA record that stood for 20 years before getting surpassed nine times in the last 10 years.\n\nAt Harrison, Coleman had 6,134 yards and 62 touchdowns and rushing for 1,611 yards. He was a winner too, taking Harrison to three state championship games and winning in back-to-back as a junior and senior. In legendary fashion, Coleman closed out his high school career by completing a game-winning touchdown drive in the Class B state title game for a 28-27 win over DeWitt. His nine-yard scoring run with 1:34 to play made the difference.\n\n\"Being able to drive the team down in the last drive to win the state championship, how much better of a script can you write?\" Coleman told MLive earlier in the fall. \"My senior year, taking us down with less than two minutes to go in the game to win the state championship -- I can still see it today.\"\n\nAfter spending his freshman year at Albion High School, his family moved to the Detroit area and he looked to enroll at Farmington Hills Harrison. Legendary football coach John Herrington did not think much of Coleman at first meeting. At 5-feet-8, Herrington did not think think much of Coleman at first glance. Coleman gave Herrington a highlight tape and Herrington humored him and sent him to see assistant coach Bob Sutter. Then, Herrington watched Coleman's highlight tape. \"Class ended and I threw the tape in,\" Herrington said. \"I ran down down the stairs and I said, 'Sutter, is that little kid still here?'\"\n\nThe rest is history.\n\n\"He was just like his nickname, Mill The Thrill, you know?\" Herrington said. \"It didn't matter what I called, if it broke down, he could (improvise) and run a good play. The DeWitt game where I called two passes in a row and he ran it both times and went in and scored, I remember that real well.\" Despite being only 5-feet-9 when he graduated, he went on to Michigan State and had success as a wide receiver with the Spartans. In 40 games with the Spartans, he finished with 1,813 receiving yards and 8 touchdowns while adding 177 rush yards and 4 touchdowns.\n\nHe eventually returned to Harrison to coach alongside Herrington. After Harrison closed this last spring, Coleman moved over to be an assistant at nearby North Farmington, where Herrington also took an assistant position. \"We've kind of known each other really well for all these many years,\" Coleman said of his relationship with Herrington. \"We work well together.\"\n\nDon't Edit\n\nMORE\n\nHere are the other 25 greatest players lists from MLive regional sites:\n\nAnn Arbor area\n\nBay City area\n\nFlint area\n\nGrand Rapids area\n\nJackson area\n\nKalamazoo area\n\nMuskegon area\n\nSaginaw area"}, {"url": "https://www.vintagedetroit.com/lions-tackle-bob-miller-was-a-success-as-lineman-horseman/", "page_content": "Bob Miller was a man who always knew his own mind, even as a rookie.

To this day, when his name is mentioned, it\u2019s often confused with that of Detroit Tigers bonus baby Bob Miller, who pitched four seasons at Briggs Stadium in the middle \u201850s.\n\nAccording to Schmidt, Miller \u201cwas a very good football player who could have been a great one except that he had a bad back.\u201d Bad back or not, Miller was one of just eight players to suit up for each of the Lions\u2019 six postseason games during the 1950s: four championship games against Cleveland (in 1952-54 and 1957) plus divisional playoff games against Los Angeles (1952) and San Francisco (1957). Not even Schmidt, Layne, Walker, and Yale Lary\u2014all Hall of Famers\u2014could claim that distinction.

He was good enough to be named a first-team starter by The Sporting News in 1956.\n\nCharacteristically, Miller retired from football on his own terms, though he had just turned 29, was making $11,500 a year (a good salary for the era), and still could have played a few more seasons.\n\n\u201cI got out of football when they started talking about trading me here, trading me there,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to go where they wanted me to go.\u201d Instead he became involved in a successful stamping business in Metro Detroit. He did well enough to spend the last quarter-century of his life with no financial worries. He carved out a third career\u2014after his NFL and industrial careers\u2014as a leading Michigan thoroughbred trainer and breeder.\n\nMiller first got into horse racing in the late 1970s. \u201cA friend took me over to Detroit Race Course, and I just kept coming back,\u201d he explained. \u201cI guess there was some of the same psychology involved in horse racing as there was in football. It meant working hard and it meant constantly learning the business. It also offered competition, and I could come and go as I pleased.\u201d\n\nAlong with his wife, Delphine, Miller operated Del-Rob Stables on their Clarkston farm. They had 870 winners out of 4,790 starts, including 59 stakes winners. \u201cRacing gives me that adrenaline rush the way football did,\u201d Miller once told a Chicago reporter after his filly came from eight lengths back to win a blanket finish at Hawthorne Race Course in Illinois. \u201cWhen my horse runs a big race, it\u2019s the way it was when I\u2019d make a big play.\u201d\n\nMiller was a familiar sight at race tracks, his suit pocket stuffed with cigars, until he died at age 76 in 2009.

In his 20 years as a vice president, Miller worked with city leaders and led community relations with Western\u2019s neighbors. He also played a key role in developing both the first phase and expansion of the Business, Research and Technology Park.\n\nMiller worked \u201cfostering and maintaining\u201d relationships with the university\u2019s community and business partners, university spokesperson Paula Davis said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a valued member of the leadership team,\" Davis said.\n\nThe 1972 WMU graduate and Jackson, Michigan, native worked for six different university presidents during his tenure.\n\nMiller said now is the right time for retirement, though he will continue his work with several community boards. He is currently active with the Brownfield Redevelopment Authority, Kalamazoo Downtown Economic Growth Authority, Downtown Development Association, Downtown Tomorrow Incorporated, Local Initiates Support Corp. and the United Way Board of Directors, he said.\n\n\u201cI love the university and I love this community. I\u2019ve had the perfect job for 20 years,\" Miller said. \u201cI want to stay involved, volunteer and give back and do what I can to help the community improve.\"\n\nKalamazoo Downtown Partnership President Andrew Haan said Miller \u201cbrings a wealth of experience\u201d to his organization\u2019s work on development efforts in Kalamazoo. Miller played a \u201cvital part\u201d in the organization\u2019s restructuring in 2018 and was \u201cinstrumental in the great connection\" between the university and city, Haan said.\n\nThe multitude of projects, new programs and construction happening in downtown carry Miller\u2019s fingerprints, Haan said. His plans to continue working past retirement illustrates Miller\u2019s \u201cinnate drive to the serve the community,\u201d Haan said.\n\nTaking a sip of coffee at about 10 a.m. Monday, July 1 \u2014 his first day of retirement \u2014 Miller said that being out and about in the community feels normal. What felt unusual was staying home past his normal 7:30 a.m. clock-in time and enjoying an extra cup of coffee and watering his plants, he said.\n\nIn this next chapter, he hopes to enjoy more leisure time, including skiing and riding his bike.\n\nMiller\u2019s longtime role leading community relations is now housed within the university\u2019s Department of Government Affairs, Davis said. Jeffrey Breneman was chosen as the new vice president of that department, and starts his work at WMU on July 15. Breneman replaced retiring vice president Greg Rosine.\n\nIn the last two decades, Miller said, he saw significant changes at the university. The relationship between the university and city was improved, the infrastructure changed dramatically on campus, the university got an almost entirely new leadership team under President Edward Montgomery and saw the launch of the business park, Miller said.\n\nLooking ahead, he believes the city is approaching another major transformation. Development downtown shows growth in the city, including the nearly completed Exchange building and construction of another development known as \u201cLot 9.\u201d\n\nThe community has \u201creinvented itself over and over again,\u201d Miller said, and the work continues to make Kalamazoo attractive to businesses and young people.\n\n\u201cThe best days are ahead of us,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://ripbaseball.com/2020/11/30/obituary-bob-miller-1926-2020/", "page_content": "RIP to Bob Miller, a relief pitcher and one of the last surviving members of one of the all-time great Phillies teams. He died on November 27 from natural causes at the age of 94. Miller, one of four Bob Millers to play professional baseball, played for the Philadelphia Phillies from 1949-1958.\n\n(The other Bob Millers: Robert W. Miller played in 1890-91 in the American Association; Robert Gerald Miller played for three teams from 1953-62; Robert Lane Miller played for 10 teams between 1957-74. All four Bob Millers were pitchers.)\n\nRobert John Miller was born on June 16, 1926, in Detroit. He went to high school there, he went to college there, and when his baseball career ended, he spent almost 40 years as a college baseball coach there, too. The only thing that the lifelong National Leaguer didn\u2019t do in Detroit was pitch in a major-league game.\n\nAccording to his obituary in The Detroit News, Miller was a three-sport athlete at St. Mary\u2019s of Redford High School, playing basketball and football as well as baseball. In 1943, Miller was named as a defensive end on the Detroit Free Press All-Catholic League team \u2014 he was also St. Mary\u2019s best wide receiver. As a 6\u20193\u2033 high school junior, he was an intimidating presence on the mound during baseball season. The baseball team won the First Division West Side title in Miller\u2019s senior year of 1944, and he pitched the team to an 8-1 over St. Leo\u2019s to win the title.\n\nSource: The Evening Sun, May 11, 1950.\n\nMiller said that the Detroit Tigers were interested in signing him while he was a high school pitcher. \u201cBut they beat around the bush too much after I lost two Catholic high school city finals to Art Houtteman in Briggs Stadium,\u201d he said. The Tigers focused on Houtteman instead, and he would become an All-Star pitcher for the team.\n\nMiller had to put his education and athletics on hold after high school graduation, as he was inducted into the Army. He served for a total of 26 months. Miller said he spent a month in combat on northern Luzon during six months in the Philippines. He then spent a year in Japan, where he pitched for the entire summer of 1946. After his discharge, he attended the University of Detroit Mercy for two years. He pitched on the school\u2019s baseball team in 1947 and 1948.\n\nDue to his military service, Miller was a 22-year-old sophomore in 1948 and decided to turn pro. He signed with the Philadelphia Phillies and was assigned to the club\u2019s Class-B affiliate in Terre Haute, Ind. After some good relief work, Miller made his first start as a pro on June 10 and beat Springfield 9-3. All of Springfield\u2019s runs were unearned, and Miller fanned 5 in the complete game win. He won 6 games for Terre Haute in 1948 and turned in an excellent season in 1949, winning 19 games and leading the league with 207 strikeouts. He was also one of the team\u2019s better hitters, as he batted .268 with 5 home runs. It wasn\u2019t a lights-out dominant year, as he gave up 255 hits in 255 innings and had an ERA of 3.95, but he still walked away with the Three-I League\u2019s Most Valuable Player Award. He also earned a late-season call-up with the Phillies that year.\n\nMiller threw a scoreless inning of relief against the Reds on September 16, 1949, in his major-league debut. He allowed 1 hit \u2014 a single to Ted Kluszewski. He appeared in 3 games and threw 2-2/3 scoreless innings with the Phillies.\n\nThe 1950 Philadelphia Phillies, aka The Whiz Kids, are one of the most celebrated teams in Phillies history. Even with so many young, inexperienced players on the roster (hence the nickname), the Phillies won 91 games to clinch the NL pennant, the first time the team had finished first since 1915. The pitching staff was anchored by youngsters Robin Roberts, Curt Simmons (the last surviving Whiz Kid) and Miller. In his first full season, Miller turned in an 11-6 record in 35 games (21 starts), with a 3.57 ERA. He threw 7 complete games and 2 shutouts while posting an ERA+ of 113. Miller finished second to the Braves Sam Jethroe for the Rookie of the Year award.\n\nPhillies manager Eddie Sawyer, left, with his Whiz Kids pitching staff: Curt Simmons, Robin Roberts, Bob Miller and Bubba Church.\n\nThe first win of Miller\u2019s career came on April 29, 1950, and was a 2-1 victory over the Boston Braves. Boston\u2019s only run came on a throwing error by catcher Stan Lopata \u2014 an old teammate of Miller\u2019s from the Detroit American Legion days. Miller won his first 8 decisions before the Cubs tagged him with a loss on July 16.\n\nMiller admitted that he was nervous at the start of the season. \u201cBut I\u2019m gaining confidence with every game now that I\u2019ve found major leaguers can be fooled just the same as in the minors.\u201d\n\nMiller wasn\u2019t as effective in the second half of the season thanks to an ailing shoulder. He did start the Phillies\u2019 90th win of the season and pitched into the seventh inning before tiring. The Phillies were swept in the World Series by the Yankees, and Miller started Game Four. He didn\u2019t last long, though. The Yankees leadoff hitter, Gene Woodling, reached on an error by second baseman Granny Hamner. He advanced to second base on a Phil Rizzuto grounder and scored on a single by Yogi Berra. Berra raced to third base on a wild pitch and scored on a double by Joe DiMaggio. That was enough for Phillies manager Eddie Sawyer, who removed Miller for reliever Jim Konstanty. The Yankees, backed by the pitching of Whitey Ford, won 5-2 to win the World Series.\n\nMiller\u2019s excellent rookie season was followed by two bad ones, and he bounced between the big leagues and the minors. He spent most of 1951 as a little-used reliever and accumulated a 2-1 record and 6.82 ERA in 17 games before he was optioned to the Wilmington Blue Rocks in August. In 1952, he made the Opening Day roster and allowed 1 run in 2 innings of work against the New York Giants before being sent to AAA Baltimore. He won 12 games with the Orioles and returned in September to make 2 more appearances, including an unsuccessful start against the Cubs.\n\nSome of those struggles came from a couple of injuries. He injured his back in the second half of the 1950 season when he fell trying to catch a train at the North Philadelphia Station. Then he hurt his arm and wouldn\u2019t be fully healthy until 1953. He began that season in the bullpen, but after Curt Simmons injured his foot in a lawn mower accident and was lost for several weeks, he moved into the starting rotation. Miller turned in an 8-9 record and an even 4.00 ERA in 20 starts and 15 relief outings. Many of those losses were hard-luck defeats, where the Phillies offense failed to support good pitching performances. He had 3 shutouts, including a 2-0 3-hitter against the Milwaukee Braves on September 9.\n\n\u201cI think I pitched the best ball I ever did over those last eight or nine weeks,\u201d Miller later said.\n\nMiller made 16 starts in 1954, but he began to see more work coming out of the bullpen. As a starter in \u201954, he was 3-8 with a 4.96 ERA, but he was 4-1 with a 3.28 ERA as a reliever. Opposing batters hit .260 off him as a reliever but more than 50 points when he started a game. Miller would make just 7 more starts over the final 4 years of his career.\n\nSource: The Philadelphia Inquirer, March 18, 1956.\n\nFor the next three seasons, Miller became a very reliable reliever for new Phillies manager Mayo Smith. He made 40 appearances in 1955 and had a fine 2.41 ERA while earning an 8-4 record. He wasn\u2019t a typical reliever who relied on strikeouts to get through innings \u2014 he had 28 K\u2019s and 28 walks in 89-2/3 innings in 1955 \u2014 but he had the lowest ERA on the staff.\n\nHe could still make a spot start and do very well at it. One of the best games of his career came on August 25, 1956 \u2014 against the Milwaukee Braves. He retired the first 14 batters before Bobby Thomson lined a single to center in the fifth inning. Miller had to settle for a 2-hit, 3-0 shutout. Immediately after the game, he flew to Detroit to attend the funeral of his grandmother, so he couldn\u2019t exactly enjoy the moment.\n\nBetween 1955 and 1957, Miller appeared in 121 games for the Phillies, with 7 starts, and had a 13-15 record with 12 saves. He also had an ERA of 2.84 and a WHIP of 1.230. He attributed his success to the fact that Smith used him exclusively in one role, instead of moving him in and out of the rotation constantly.\n\n\u201cWhen Mayo Smith told me [in 1955] that he planned to restrict me to relief work, I was more than satisfied,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care whether I start or relieve, but I don\u2019t like the idea of doing both.\u201d\n\nMiller made it through his first outing of 1958 safely, pitching 2 scoreless innings against the Pirates on April 24. After that, though, he gave up runs in almost every other game in which he appeared, and he was soon relegated to a mop-up role. He picked up his only win on July 29 by shutting down the Cardinals for 2 innings, lowering his ERA to 9.00 on the season. Shortly after that, the Braves got their revenge for all the times he bested them and scored 6 times off him in 3 innings on August 10. It was his last appearance in the major leagues. The Phillies released him to the Miami Marlins of the International League on August 12, with an 11.69 ERA in 17 games and 36 hits allowed in 22-1/3 innings.\n\nMiller played in a handful of games for Miami and was briefly property of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1959 when they bought his contract in the offseason. That gave them two Bob Millers on the team, which would have made for some confusion had both made the team. The Cardinals returned Miller to Philadelphia, and he pitched briefly in the minors for Buffalo and Montreal before calling it quits at the end of the season.\n\nIn his 10-year career, Miller had a record of 42-42, with 15 saves. He appeared in 261 games and made 58 starts, with 23 complete games and 6 shutouts. He struck out 263 batters and walked 247, and he had a career WHIP of 1.382.\n\nAfter baseball, Miller returned to Detroit and took a job as the assistant baseball coach at the University of Detroit Mercy. When head coach Lloyd Brazil was killed in a car accident in 1965, Miller took over the role and remained head coach until his retirement in 2001. The baseball program was cut by the college in 2004.\n\nSource: University of Detroit Mercy Athletics.\n\nMiller had a career record of 896-780-2 as coach of the Detroit Mercy Titans, the most wins of any coach in the program\u2019s history as well as the most by any Michigan college coach. Sixteen of his former players were drafted by MLB organizations, and more than 40 others signed professional contracts. Several of his players, including Dick Drago, Bill Fahey and Pete Craig, reached the major leagues. His sons Pat and Bob Jr. both played for him as well.\n\nMiller was inducted into the University of Detroit Mercy Hall of Fame in 1979, the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1999 and the Michigan Baseball Hall of Fame in 2020. He received the John Conti Letterman of Distinction Award, which is given to former Titan athletes who go above and beyond at work and in the community, in 2011.\n\nChris Czarnik, a former Titan player who took over as head coach upon Miller\u2019s retirement, said the following: \u201cCoach Miller was a larger-than-life person to generations of Titan baseball players. He was the man that was watching from behind a distant fence at a remote ballpark on a hot and dusty summer evening, and when he saw a Titan, he knew it. Decades later, he could make a former player beam with pride by recalling that moment, \u2018I remember the first time I saw you swing that bat; he would say, and bring alive a detail of a ringing double in Redford or Livonia or East Detroit \u2013 and how he wouldn\u2019t leave your driveway that night until you told him you would be part of his team. He knew baseball before it could be measured. He loved the game and could feel it in his blood when it was time to squeeze a run in or when a struggling freshman needed a word of confidence. Coach also cherished his players and the University. He made teammates of us, linking generations, and captured an unforgettable era. He earned this legacy. But perhaps the thing I\u2019ll remember coach most for is how his children looked up to him and how proud he was of them. You could see it in their eyes and hear it in his unforgettable voice. I know I speak for all Titans in expressing our love and condolences to his family upon the loss of this legendary man.\u201d\n\nFor more information: The Detroit News\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @rip_mlb\n\n\n\nFollow me on Instagram: @rip_mlb\n\n\n\nFollow me on Facebook: ripbaseball\n\n\n\nSupport RIP Baseball\n\nAdvertisement"}], "Bob Miller was selected in the first round of the 1967 AFL Draft by the Bills.": [{"url": "https://usctrojans.com/sports/2018/5/16/usc-nfl-draft-history.aspx", "page_content": "ALL-TIME NFL DRAFT PICKS\n\nListing includes NFL drafts from 1936-2019 (which followed the 1935-2018 collegiate seasons).

In 1951 he journeyed south to Tasmania to take up the role as captain-coach of City in the NTFA, a club who hadn\u2019t won an NTFA premiership since 1941; his arrival would usher in the greatest era in the club\u2019s 106-year history. After making his debut for the Redlegs in the opening round of 1951, Miller had become one of the star centremen in the competition by season\u2019s end, leading his side to a Grand Final against Launceston, a match City would lose by 12 points. They would go one better the following year, getting the better of Scottsdale by 20 points.\n\nThe 1952 triumph was to be the first of a hat trick of premierships for City under Miller\u2019s guidance: in 1953 the Redlegs proved too strong for Longford, while the following year it would be Launceston who would be the vanquished challenger, City emerging premiers by five goals. This led to the club\u2019s first state premierships decider since 1941, and as they had done at league level City emerged triumphant, toppling TANFL premiers Hobart by 24 points. During this period Miller became an effective and popular coach, regularly inspiring teammates through pieces of on-field brilliance through the middle of the ground or during a short-lived stint at full forward. Sadly, Miller would watch his teammates\u2019 glorious 1954 achievements from the sidelines, after badly breaking his leg during the NTFA finals. After retiring at the end of 1955 Miller retained his role as coach, and his on-field absence failed to blunt City\u2019s dominance. After falling to Longford in 1955 NTFA decider, Miller\u2019s charges brought home their fourth flag in five years in 1956, overcoming North Launceston by eight points.\n\nAfter (the re-named) City-South failed to reach the Grand Final for the first time under his watch in 1957, Miller stepped down as coach, handing the reigns to champion Centre Half Forward Geoff Long. Miller subsequently spent some time coaching in the country, most notably in the Fingal District Association with Rossarden where he guided the club to a dynasty of six premierships in seven seasons between 1961 and 1967. He was eventually lured back to City-South as coach after nearly 15 years in 1970, replacing club champion Berkley Cox. City-South\u2019s golden era had ended in 1966 and it was hoped that the previously successful Miller would be able to lead the club back into the top echelon of teams in the NTFA. His re-appointment was met with almost immediate success: after reaching the preliminary final in his first season back, City-South finished as minor premiers in 1971, only to be crushed by Scottsdale in the Grand Final by 93 points. Stung by that humiliation, the Redlegs and Miller were back with a vengeance the following year, exacting revenge on Scottsdale to take out the NTFA premiership, before winning their seventh and final State premiership with a magnificent victory over the Darrel Baldock-coached Latrobe by 36 points. Despite this success, Miller stepped down as coach at season\u2019s end, going out on the highest note possible.\n\nIn ten combined seasons as coach of City/City-South, Bob Miller led his side to eight Grand Final appearances, five premierships and two state flags. When the club\u2019s Team of the Century was named in 2002, Miller was an obvious choice as coach. Unfortunately he didn\u2019t live to see himself accorded the honour, passing away in 1993 at the age of 69."}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/millebo04.shtml", "page_content": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhen was Bob Miller born?\n\nBob Miller was born on February 18, 1939.\n\nWhere was Bob Miller born?\n\nBob Miller was born in St. Louis, MO.\n\nHow tall was Bob Miller?\n\nBob Miller was 6-1 (185 cm) tall.\n\nHow much did Bob Miller weigh when playing?\n\nBob Miller weighed 180 lbs (81 kg) when playing.\n\nHow many seasons did Bob Miller play?\n\nBob Miller played 17 seasons.\n\nIs Bob Miller in the Hall of Fame?\n\nBob Miller has not been elected into the Hall of Fame.\n\nWhat position did Bob Miller play?\n\nBob Miller was a Pitcher.\n\nHow many strikeouts did Bob Miller have?\n\nBob Miller had 895 strikeouts over his career.\n\nHow many teams has Bob Miller played for?\n\nBob Miller played for 10 teams; the St. Louis Cardinals, New York Mets, Los Angeles Dodgers, Minnesota Twins, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, Cleveland Indians, Pittsburgh Pirates, San Diego Padres and Detroit Tigers.\n\nHow many World Series has Bob Miller won?\n\nBob Miller won 3 World Series.\n\nWhen did Bob Miller retire?\n\nBob Miller last played in 1974."}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-almanac.com/draft/baseball-draft.php?yr=1967", "page_content": "The 1967 Baseball Draft appears below and includes every player chosen in the June amateur draft, every round of the 1967 baseball draft, the overall pick, the team who drafted them, their position at that time, and where they were drafted from (high school / college name).\n\n\"The idea behind the draft was simple: 1) it gave the poorer teams\u2014usually those lower in the standings\u2014an equal chance to sign the top talent being produced in colleges and high schools; and 2) it cut down on payments of excessive bonuses to untried players.

The Houston Texans, who took Ohio State\u2019s C.J. Stroud at No. 2, and the Indianapolis Colts, who picked Florida\u2019s Anthony Richardson at No. 4, also sought to secure the new faces of their franchises under center.\n\nTheir selections marked the first time that three Black quarterbacks were drafted in the top 10, and came just a few months after the first Super Bowl with two Black starting quarterbacks, Kansas City\u2019s Patrick Mahomes and Philadelphia\u2019s Jalen Hurts.\n\nThe top 10 was also enlivened by draft-night trades. After the Texans picked Stroud, they struck again, leaping from pick No. 12 to No. 3 to select Alabama edge rusher Will Anderson Jr. The first draft for Texans Coach DeMeco Ryans could not have gone much better than landing a new quarterback and a premier edge rusher within 10 minutes.\n\nImage Alabama linebacker Will Anderson Jr. celebrating with fans after being chosen by the Texans at No. 3. Credit... Charlie Riedel/Associated Press\n\nIn another high-profile trade, the Philadelphia Eagles moved up one spot to select defensive tackle Jalen Carter at No. 9. Carter, a standout performer on Georgia\u2019s top-ranked defense, pleaded no contest to two misdemeanor charges of reckless driving and racing last month, stemming from a car crash in January that killed two people, including a Georgia teammate.\n\nOne unexpected development was the move toward running backs, a position that has been devalued in the N.F.L. over the past several years. Texas\u2019 Bijan Robinson, who was named college football\u2019s best running back last season, went No. 8 overall to the Atlanta Falcons \u2014 becoming the first running back taken in the top 10 since the Giants\u2019 Saquon Barkley in 2018.\n\nAn even bigger shock came just four picks later when the Detroit Lions \u2014 who signed the former Bears running back David Montgomery in free agency \u2014 selected Alabama\u2019s Jahmyr Gibbs at No. 12. Coach Dan Campbell\u2019s Lions, who a few picks later chose an inside linebacker, Jack Campbell, were not afraid to zig when the rest of the league is zagging.\n\nIn an another anachronistic turn, the first receiver did not come off the board until the Seahawks took Ohio State\u2019s Jaxon Smith-Njigba at No. 20. That sparked a run of four straight receivers \u2014 the longest first-round run for the position since the A.F.L. and N.F.L. drafts merged.\n\nMeanwhile, Will Levis, the 6-foot-4 Kentucky quarterback who was projected to be among the top picks, did not hear his name called. He was on site at Union Station in Kansas City, Mo., enduring the agonizing wait in the green room that quarterbacks like Geno Smith and Lamar Jackson experienced during past drafts.\n\nImage Kentucky quarterback Will Levis waited in the green room with his family. Credit... Doug Benc/Associated Press\n\nHeading into Friday night, all eyes will be on Levis. ESPN said that its analytics department had pegged him as having a 92 percent chance to be selected in the top 10. But teams picked other quarterbacks or filled other needs, this year\u2019s reminder that pre-draft speculation is just that."}, {"url": "https://touchdownwire.usatoday.com/lists/nfl-draft-no-1-overall-qb-1967/", "page_content": "It is a foregone conclusion that the Jacksonville Jaguars are going to take Trevor Lawrence with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2021 NFL draft, which kicks off Thursday night. They may as well put the New York Jets on the clock at this point.\n\nOf course, it would ruin reams of mock drafts if Jacksonville didn\u2019t go with Lawrence, although this list would still be apropos as the Jaguars have a huge need at quarterback.\n\nThe year 1967 was chosen for this list because that was the first year of the common draft between the NFL and the AFL.\n\nHere are quarterbacks who were taken with the No. 1 overall pick and how their careers went."}]}
