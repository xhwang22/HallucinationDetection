Rand was raised in an upper-middle-class, European-oriented family, in the midst of the mysticism and nationalism of Russia. Having taught herself to read, Rand, at the age of 8, became captivated by the heroism in a French-language serial adventure titled The Mysterious Valley. At the age of 9, Rand decided to become a writer, inspired especially by Victor Hugo's novels. Hugo's writing helped arm her against the fatalistic view of life that dominated Russia, a country she later described as \"an accidental cesspool of civilization.\"\n\nIn February of 1917, Ayn Rand witnessed the first shots of the Russian Revolution, and later that year she witnessed the Bolshevik Revolution as well. In order to escape the fighting, her family went to the Crimea, where Rand finished high school. The final Communist victory brought the confiscation of her father's pharmacy and periods of near-starvation. When introduced to American history in her last year of high school, Rand immediately took America as her model of what a nation of free men could be. Her love for the West \u2014 especially America \u2014 was fueled by the Viennese operettas and American and German films, which the Soviets temporarily allowed to be shown.\n\nWhen Rand and her family returned from the Crimea, she entered the University of Petrograd to study philosophy and history, graduating in 1924. She entered the State Institute for Cinema Arts in 1924 to study screenwriting. During this period, Rand produced her first formal writings, essays about Hollywood, published in 1999 by The Ayn Rand Institute Press as Russian Writings on Hollywood.\n\nImmigration to the United States\n\nIn late 1925, Ayn Rand obtained permission to leave the Soviet Union to visit relatives in the United States, on the pretext of learning the American film business. After six months with relatives in Chicago, she moved to Hollywood to pursue a career as a screenwriter. On her second day there, she had a chance meeting with her favorite American director, Cecil B. DeMille, who took her to the set of his epic film The King of Kings and gave her a job, first as an extra, then as a script reader. During the next week at the studio, she met an actor, Frank O'Connor, whom she married in 1929; they were married until his death 50 years later.\n\nCareer Highlights\n\nAfter struggling for several years at various non-writing jobs, including one in the wardrobe department at the RKO film studio, Rand sold her first screenplay, Red Pawn, to Universal Studios in 1932. Rand saw her first stage play, Night of January 16th, produced in Hollywood in 1934 and then on Broadway in 1935. Her first novel, We the Living, was completed in 1933. The most autobiographical of Rand's novels, We the Living, was rejected as too anti-Communist and wasn't published in the United States until 1936. In 1937, Rand devoted a few weeks to write her novella Anthem, which was soon published in England but was not published in the United States until 1947, ten years later.\n\nAlthough positively reviewed, neither We the Living nor Anthem garnered high sales. Not until the publication of The Fountainhead did Ayn Rand achieve fame. Rand began writing The Fountainhead in 1935, taking seven years to complete the book. In the hero of The Fountainhead, architect Howard Roark, she presented for the first time the kind of hero whose depiction was the chief goal of her writing: the ideal man, man \"as he could be and ought to be.\" The Fountainhead was rejected by 12 publishers but finally accepted by Bobbs-Merrill. Although published in 1943, The Fountainhead made history by becoming a bestseller two years later, through word-of-mouth, and it gained for its author lasting recognition as a champion of individualism.\n\nAyn Rand returned to Hollywood in late 1943 to write the screenplay for The Fountainhead, but wartime restrictions delayed production until 1948. Working part-time as a screenwriter for producer Hal Wallis, Rand wrote such scripts as Love Letters and You Came Along, and she began her major novel, Atlas Shrugged, in 1946. In 1951, Rand permanently moved back to New York City and devoted herself full-time to the completion of the novel Atlas Shrugged. Despite extremely negative reviews, Atlas Shrugged quickly became a bestseller.\n\nRand's Philosophy: Objectivism\n\nAfter the publication of Atlas Shrugged in 1957, Ayn Rand realized that she would have to identify the philosophy that made her heroes possible. She termed this philosophy Objectivism and described it as \"a philosophy for living on earth.\" Rand offered private courses on both fiction and nonfiction writing and, in 1958, helped form an institute to teach her philosophy. For the remaining years of her life, Rand devoted herself to nonfiction writing, penning and editing a number of articles for her periodicals. These articles later appeared in numerous philosophic collections and dealt with topics including ethics (The Virtue of Selfishness), politics (Capitalism: the Unknown Ideal), aesthetics (The Romantic Manifesto), and the theory of knowledge (Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology). At the time of her death in 1982, Rand was working on a television miniseries of Atlas Shrugged.\n\nA controversial novelist and philosopher \u2014 especially in academic circles \u2014 Ayn Rand attained widespread recognition, as indicated by a 1991 joint survey by The Library of Congress and The Book-of-the-Month Club, which placed Atlas Shrugged as second only to the Bible as the most influential book among American readers. The Ayn Rand Society (a subgroup of the American Philosophical Association), an Ayn Rand first-class postage stamp (issued by The U.S. Postal Service in 1999), and an Academy Award-nominated documentary about her life (Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life, 1997) also serve as proof of her influence. The Ayn Rand Institute in Marina del Rey, California, was established in 1985 to increase the awareness of the existence and content of Ayn Rand's philosophy."}, {"url": "https://aynrandsociety.org/resources/overview-of-objectivism/", "page_content": "What follows is a revised version of the entry on Ayn Rand by Gregory Salmieri and Allan Gotthelf in the Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers (Thoemmes Continuum, 2005). It is reproduced in this form with the permission of the authors and publisher.\n\nAyn Rand was born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum on 2 February 1905 in St. Petersburg, Russia, to middle-class, cultured, largely non-observant Jewish parents. At age 16 she entered Petrograd University, graduating three years later, in 1924; history was her major subject and philosophy her special interest. She subsequently studied for a year at the State Technicum for Screen Arts. In early 1926 she emigrated to the United States, and eventually took up residence in Hollywood, where she changed her name to Ayn Rand. She worked initially as a screen writer for the Cecil B. DeMille studios. Her first play, Night of January 16th, was produced on Broadway in 1935, and the first of her four novels, We the Living, was published in 1936. Anthem followed in 1938, The Fountainhead in 1943, and Atlas Shrugged, her magnum opus, in 1957.\n\nIn 1951, Rand moved permanently to New York City. After the publication of Atlas Shrugged, she turned to nonfiction, elaborating on the philosophy expounded in the novels and applying it to current cultural and political issues. She lectured widely at universities and colleges and to private groups throughout the U.S., and wrote numerous essays, many published in periodicals she edited or co-edited: The Objectivist Newsletter (1962\u201365), The Objectivist (1966\u201371), and The Ayn Rand Letter (1971\u201376). The philosophical speeches from her novels, and her philosophic essays and lectures, became the basis for a series of seven books collections, starting in 1961. Rand died on 6 March 1982 in New York City.\n\nOriginal manuscripts of Rand\u2019s novels are in the Library of Congress. Most of her surviving papers and documents are held in the Ayn Rand Archives, a department of the Ayn Rand Institute in Irvine, California. Rand\u2019s books have sold over twenty million copies; readers often speak of her novels as having changed their lives. A growing number of academic philosophers are taking an interest in her work.\n\nIn an afterword to Atlas Shrugged Ayn Rand said: \u201cMy philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.\u201d We start from this essentialized statement, then work back to the fundamentals of her entire philosophic system, then forward to an integrated overview of the whole.\n\nRand\u2019s concept of man as a heroic being \u2013 her vision of human beings as able to achieve great things, and of the universe as open to their efforts \u2013 is a hallmark of her thought, and certainly a significant part of her widespread appeal. Happiness she holds to be the emotional state that results from the achievement of objective values. Such values and the means to them can only be identified by reason, and Rand holds that they cannot be achieved without such virtues as independence, integrity, honesty, justice, productiveness, and pride.\n\nRand\u2019s virtue-focused rational egoism differs from traditional eudaimonism in that Rand regards ethics as an exact science. Rather than deriving her virtues from a vaguely defined human function, she takes \u201cMan\u2019s Life\u201d \u2013 i.e. that which is required for the survival of a rational animal across its lifespan \u2013 as her standard of value. This accounts for the nobility she ascribes to production \u2013 \u201cthe application of reason to the problem of survival\u201d (1966, p. 9). For Rand, reason is man\u2019s means of survival, and even the most theoretical and spiritual functions \u2013 science, philosophy, art, love, and reverence for the human potential, among others \u2013 are for the sake of life-sustaining action. This, for her, does not demean the spiritual by \u201cbringing it down\u201d to the level of the material; rather, it elevates the material and grounds the spiritual.\n\nThe foundation of Rand\u2019s philosophy is a thesis which has often been called \u201cmetaphysical realism,\u201d and which she callsthe primacy of existence. It states that \u201creality, the external world, exists independent of man\u2019s consciousness\u2026this means that A is A, that facts are facts, that things are what they are \u2013 and the task of man\u2019s consciousness is to perceive reality not to create or invent it.\u201d Rand argues that this metaphysics is axiomatic \u2013 that it is contained in all knowledge and so presupposed in any attempt to deny it.\n\nFollowing Aristotle, Rand views the world as made up of individual entities, and understands causality as the relationship between an entity and the actions necessitated by its nature. Choice is a type of causality. It is the nature of reason, our distinctive form of consciousness, to be volitional; its operation is up to us.\n\nRand draws a sharp distinction between that which is caused by human choice \u2013 \u201cthe man-made,\u201d and that which is not \u2013 \u201cthe metaphysically given.\u201d Metaphysically given facts cannot be judged and man-made phenomena must be. Epistemology and ethics are concerned with providing standards for the man-made in their respective realms, viz. knowledge and action.\n\nRand\u2019s epistemology rests on a distinction between the automatic, metaphysically given knowledge of sense-perception, and the volitional, man-made, products of reason. Perception is a form of awareness that results inexorably from a causal interaction of the perceiver with his environment. As such, it cannot be judged and serves as an epistemological given on which conceptual knowledge will be built. Epistemology for Rand is a normative discipline describing how to build conceptual knowledge on perceptual. The basic principle of her epistemology is that \u201cthe rules of cognition must be derived from the nature of existence and the nature, the identity, of [man\u2019s] cognitive faculty.\u201d (ITOE, 1990, p. 82)\n\nRand defines reason as \u201cthe faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man\u2019s senses\u201d (VOS hb edn. 1965, p. 13). With our senses we perceive entities (including their attributes). Reason identifies these existents by interrelating them. For example, Newtonian physics interrelates the perceived motions of falling apples and wandering planets. To grasp such far-flung connections we need to deal with a vast quantity of information. However, Rand observes, we are only able to hold a limited number of discrete items in mind at once. This limitation creates a need for \u201cunit economy,\u201d which is fulfilled by concepts, the basic units of thought.\n\nA concept, Rand holds, is a man-made integration of similar existents in the form of a single mental entity \u2013 a unitary awareness of indefinitely many existents of the same kind. The concept \u201cman,\u201d for example, enables us to think and learn about all men (past, present and future) at once; and to call someone a man is to bring the whole of our knowledge about men (medical, psychological, philosophical, etc.) to bear on him.\n\nRand presents her theory of concept formation in Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology (ITOE), published first as a multi-part series in The Objectivist in 1966\u201367, and then as a monograph in 1967. Properly formed concepts unit-economize by integrating similar existents. Rand analyses similarity as a matter of variation in degree or measurement along a quantitative axis. Two items are similar, relative to a third, when their differences in measurement are comparatively insignificant. We form concepts by isolating a group of similar existents (or \u201cunits\u201d) by differentiating them from foils, and then integrating the units by omitting their particular measurements. In omitting these measurements we do not turn our attention away from their differences to some underlying sameness. Rather, we interrelate the units (and a potential infinity of other units) by projecting a range along the quantitative axis. The integration is retained by means of a word, and the units\u2019 differentiation from all other existents is maintained by a definition in traditional genus-differentia form.\n\nOur first concepts are formed by integrating perceived entities or their attributes. These concepts then form the basis for wider integrations and more precise differentiations, resulting in a complex conceptual hierarchy. In ITOE, Rand lays out the process of concept formation in detail, and explains how it applies to various sorts of concepts including concepts of entities, actions, attributes, materials, conscious phenomena and philosophical axioms. She describes the methods of proper definition and discusses when it is valid to form a new concept. A 1979 reprinting of ITOE includes an essay by Leonard Peikoff, written from the standpoint of Rand\u2019s theory of concepts, that attacks the analytic-synthetic dichotomy. An expanded second edition, published in 1990, includes extensive excerpts from epistemology workshops Rand gave during 1969\u201371 for a group of philosophers and graduate students.\n\nRand argues that traditional theories of concepts either reify concepts (realism), or else make concepts arbitrary (conceptualism and nominalism). On her view, concepts are man-made, but they are made in order to apprehend reality, and so must be formed in the specific manner demanded by the nature of consciousness and of its objects. When so formed, concepts are neither intrinsic features of reality nor subjective creations of consciousness. They are objective \u201cproducts of a cognitive method of classification whose processes must be performed by man, but whose content is dictated by reality.\u201d (1990, p. 54)\n\nThe very integration of a concept\u2019s units depends on knowledge of the contrasting foils. And the similarities on which abstract concepts are based can only be grasped on the basis of a chain of prior concepts (terminating with ones formed directly from perception). Because of these facts, concepts are only meaningful in the context of a vast hierarchical system. If we don\u2019t define our concepts properly, there is a danger of \u201cstealing\u201d concepts \u2013 of using them in disregard for their place in the hierarchy, rendering them cognitively meaningless.\n\nRand\u2019s ethics is founded on an argument that the concept \u201cvalue\u201d depends on the concept \u201clife\u201d and so is only meaningful in the context of an organism pursuing its life as its ultimate value. Animals automatically desire what they need to survive, but human desires are based on volitional thinking. So, each person must adopt his life as his ultimate value, and then choose to discover and enact the means necessary to achieve it. Someone who does not value his life can have no values at all, and so ethics has no guidance to offer him.\n\nBecause of the quantity of information involved, we cannot assess the survival impact of actions considered as isolated particulars. We need to proceed conceptually, discovering the broad categories of values man\u2019s survival requires, and what virtues are necessary to achieve them. We need a code of values with \u201cman\u2019s life\u201d as its standard.\n\nRand identifies three cardinal values: Reason, Purpose, and Self-esteem, with the corresponding virtues of Rationality, Productiveness, and Pride. Reason is our means of survival. Rationality is the acceptance of reason as one\u2019s only source of knowledge and guide to action. Rationality requires a person to do his own thinking (independence) and stay true to it inaction (integrity). It requires honesty \u2013 the refusal to fake reality \u2013 because the unreal does not exist and can be of no value. It requires justice \u2013 the moral evaluation of others \u2013 because rational, productive people are good for us, while irrational parasites are worthless or dangerous.\n\nSurvival requires an all-encompassing purposefulness, with all of one\u2019s other purposes integrated to a central productive purpose. Productiveness is the application of reason to the creation of the products and services necessary for survival. To define and achieve rational purposes, a person must be certain of his competence and worth \u2013 he must achieve self-esteem. This requires the virtue of pride \u2013 a commitment to living up to the highest rational standards. Thus Rand calls pride \u201cmoral ambitiousness.\u201d It is, in effect, productiveness applied to one\u2019s character: \u201cas man is a being of self-made wealth, so he is a being of self-made soul\u201d (1957, p. 1020).\n\nThe knowledge one man discovers and the goods or services he produces can be of great benefit to another, and the character a man cultivates in himself can make him of profound spiritual value as a friend or romantic partner. Rational men, says Rand, approach one another as traders, offering values they have created in exchange for the values they seek, each appealing to the rationality and self-interest of the other. (What one offers to a friend or romantic partner is one\u2019s own character and one\u2019s admiration or love for his.) By contrast, parasites, who seek or seize the unearned, give the men from whom they might have benefited every reason to turn away from them or to turn against them. Parasitism is never in one\u2019s interest. When men recognize this and formulate their goals accordingly, their interests do not conflict and all the benefits of social existence are possible.\n\nThe values that each individual seeks from social existence are valuable only as means to his own life, and these values exist only because someone else created them to further his life. Society must therefore be organized so as to leave each man free to create and enjoy the values his life requires. This requires the identification of rights\u2014\u201cmoral principle[s] defining and sanctioning a man\u2019s freedom of action in a social context.\u201d (VOS hb edn.1965, p. 124). The basic right is the right to life\u2014i.e., the right \u201cto take all the actions required by the nature of a rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own life.\u201d The right to life entails rights to liberty (the freedom to act on the basis of one\u2019s own reasoning) and property (the freedom to exclusive use and disposal of the values one has produced). The only means by which one man (or group of men) can deprive another of his life, liberty, or property is physical force; the initiation of such force must therefore be prohibited. The function of government is to protect rights by enforcing this prohibition. Any other governmental action would constitute an initiation of force, from which it follows that the only moral political system is laissez-faire capitalism. Rand\u2019s politics is thus inseparable from her ethics.\n\nRand criticizes prior ethicists for conceiving of values as either intrinsic (as in Plato, Moore, and religious traditions) or as subjective (hedonism, utilitarianism, Nietzsche, pragmatism, etc.). On her view values are objective. Values (like concepts) are formed by a consciousness in accordance with the facts of reality. To be a value something must be identified by an agent as furthering his life. The identification is man-made, as is the choice to live that gives it meaning. But the relationship between the value and the agent\u2019s life is metaphysically given, as is the need to identify this relationship conceptually.\n\nRand thus conceives of objectivity as the relationship between a volitional consciousness and mind-independent reality when that consciousness adheres to the methods required by its nature and the nature of its objects if it is to know, and live in, reality. This new conception of objectivity shapes not only her view of concepts and values, but through them her entire epistemology and ethics, and the whole of her philosophic system. For this reason she called the system Objectivism."}, {"url": "https://iep.utm.edu/rand/", "page_content": "Ayn Rand (1905\u20141982)\n\nAyn Rand was a major intellectual of the twentieth century. Born in Russia in 1905 and educated there, she immigrated to the United States after graduating from university. Upon becoming proficient in English and establishing herself as a writer of fiction, she became well-known as a passionate advocate of a philosophy she called Objectivism. This philosophy is in the Aristotelian tradition, with that tradition\u2019s emphasis upon metaphysical naturalism, empirical reason in epistemology, and self-realization in ethics. Her political philosophy is in the classical liberal tradition, with that tradition\u2019s emphasis upon individualism, the constitutional protection of individual rights to life, liberty, and property, and limited government. She wrote both technical and popular works of philosophy, and she presented her philosophy in both fictional and nonfictional forms. Her philosophy has influenced several generations of academics and public intellectuals, and has had widespread popular appeal.\n\nRegarding human nature, Rand said, \u201cMan is a being of self-made soul.\u201d Rand believes human beings are not born in sin or with destructive desires; nor do they necessarily acquire them in the course of growing to maturity. Instead one is born morally tabula rasa (a blank slate), and through one\u2019s choices and actions one acquires one\u2019s character traits and habits. Having chronic desires to steal, rape, or kill others is the result of mistaken development and the acquisition of bad habits, just as are chronic laziness or the habit of eating too much junk food. And just as one is not born lazy but can by one\u2019s choices develop oneself into a person of vigor or sloth, so also one is not born antisocial but can by one\u2019s choices develop oneself into a person of cooperativeness or conflict.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. Life\n\nAyn Rand\u2019s life was often as colorful as those of her heroes in her best-selling novels The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. Rand first made her name as a novelist, publishing We the Living (1936), The Fountainhead (1943), and her magnum opus Atlas Shrugged (1957). These philosophical novels embodied themes she subsequently developed in nonfiction form in a series of essays and books written in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nBorn in St. Petersburg, Russia, on February 2, 1905, Rand was raised in a middle-class family. As a child, she loved storytelling, and at age nine she decided to become a writer. In school she showed academic promise, particularly in mathematics. Her family was devastated by the communist revolution of 1917, both by the social upheavals that the revolution and the ensuing civil war brought and by her father\u2019s pharmacy being confiscated by the Soviets. The family moved to the Crimea to recover financially and to escape the harshness of life the revolution brought to St. Petersburg. They later returned to Petrograd (the new name given to St. Petersburg by the Soviets), where Rand was to attend university.\n\nAt the University of Petrograd, Rand concentrated her studies on history, with secondary focuses on philosophy and literature. At university, she was repelled by the dominance of communist ideas and strong-arm tactics that suppressed free inquiry and discussion. As a youth, she had been repelled by the communists\u2019 political program, and now an adult, she was also more fully aware of the destructive effects that the revolution had had on Russian society more broadly.\n\nHaving studied American history and politics at university, and having long been an admirer of Western plays, music, and movies, she became an admirer of American individualism, vigor, and optimism, seeing them as the opposites of Russian collectivism, decay, and gloom. Not believing, however, that she would be free under the Soviet system to write the kinds of books she wanted to write, she resolved to leave Russia and go to America.\n\nRand graduated from the University of Petrograd in 1924. She then enrolled at the State Institute for Cinema Arts in order to study screenwriting. In 1925, she finally received permission from the Soviet authorities to leave the country in order to visit relatives in the United States. Officially, her visit was to be brief; Rand, however, had already decided not to return to the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter several stops in western European cities, Rand arrived in New York City in February 1926. From New York, she traveled on to Chicago, Illinois, where she spent the next six months living with relatives, learning English, and developing ideas for stories and movies. She had decided to become a screenwriter, and, having received an extension to her visa, she left for Hollywood, California.\n\nOn Rand\u2019s second day in Hollywood, an event occurred that was worthy of her fiction. She was spotted by Cecil B. DeMille, one of Hollywood\u2019s leading directors, while she was standing at the gate of his studio. She had recognized him as he was passing by in his car, and he had noticed her staring at him. He stopped to ask why she was staring, and Rand explained that she had recently arrived from Russia, that she had long been passionate about Hollywood movies, and that she dreamed of being a screenwriter. DeMille was then working on \u201cThe King of Kings,\u201d and gave her a ride to his movie set and signed her on as an extra. During her second week at DeMille\u2019s studio, another significant event occurred: Rand met Frank O\u2019Connor, a young actor also working as an extra. Rand and O\u2019Connor were married in 1929, and they remained married for fifty years until his death in 1979.\n\nRand worked for DeMille as a reader of scripts and struggled financially while working on her own writing. She also held a variety of non-writing jobs until in 1932 she was able to sell her first screenplay, \u201cRed Pawn,\u201d to Universal Studios. Also in 1932 her first stage play, \u201cNight of January 16th,\u201d was produced in Hollywood and later on Broadway.\n\nRand had been working for years on her first significant novel, We the Living, and finished it in 1933. However, for several years it was rejected by various publishers, until in 1936 it was published by Macmillan in the U.S. and Cassell in England. Rand described We the Living as the most autobiographical of her novels, its theme being the brutality of life under communist rule in Russia. We the Living did not receive a positive reaction from American reviewers and intellectuals. It was published in the 1930s, a decade sometimes called the \u201cRed Decade,\u201d during which American intellectuals were often pro-communist and respectful and admiring of the Soviet experiment.\n\nRand\u2019s next major project was The Fountainhead, which she had begun to work on in 1935. While the theme of We the Living was political, the theme of The Fountainhead was ethical, focusing on individualist themes of independence and integrity. The novel\u2019s hero, the architect Howard Roark, is Rand\u2019s first embodiment of her ideal man, the man who lives on a principled and heroic scale of achievement.\n\nAs with We the Living, Rand had difficulties getting The Fountainhead published. Twelve publishers rejected it before it was published by Bobbs-Merrill in 1943. Again not well received by reviewers and intellectuals, the novel nonetheless became a best seller, primarily through word-of-mouth recommendation. The Fountainhead made Rand famous as an exponent of individualist ideas, and its continuing to sell well brought her financial security. Warner Brothers produced a movie version of the novel in 1949, starring Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal, for which Rand wrote the screenplay.\n\nIn 1946, Rand began work on her most ambitious novel, Atlas Shrugged. At the time, she was working part-time as a screenwriter for producer Hal Wallis. In 1951, she and her husband moved to New York City, where she began to work full-time on Atlas. Published by Random House in 1957, Atlas Shrugged is her most complete expression of her literary and philosophical vision. Dramatized in the form of a mystery about a man who stopped the motor of the world, the plot and characters embody the political and ethical themes first developed in We the Living and The Fountainhead and integrates them into a comprehensive philosophy including metaphysics, epistemology, economics, and the psychology of love and sex.\n\nAtlas Shrugged was an immediate best seller and Rand\u2019s last work of fiction. Her novels had expressed philosophical themes, although Rand considered herself primarily a novelist and only secondarily a philosopher. The creation of plots and characters and the dramatization of achievements and conflicts were her central purposes in writing fiction, rather than presenting an abstracted and didactic set of philosophical theses.\n\nThe Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, however, had attracted to Rand many readers who were strongly interested in the philosophical ideas the novels embodied and in pursuing them further. Among the earliest of those with whom Rand became associated and who later became prominent were psychologist Nathaniel Branden and economist Alan Greenspan, later Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Her interactions with these and several other key individuals were partly responsible for Rand\u2019s turning from fiction to nonfiction writing in order to develop her philosophy more systematically.\n\nFrom 1962 until 1976, Rand wrote and lectured on her philosophy, now named \u201cObjectivism.\u201d Her essays during this period were mostly published in a series of periodicals: The Objectivist Newsletter, published from 1962 to 1965; the larger periodical The Objectivist, published from 1966 to 1971; and then The Ayn Rand Letter, published from 1971 to 1976. The essays written for these periodicals form the core material for a series of nine nonfiction books published during Rand\u2019s lifetime. These books develop Rand\u2019s philosophy in all its major categories and apply it to cultural issues. Perhaps the most significant of these books are The Virtue of Selfishness, which develops her ethical theory, Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal, devoted to political and economic theory, Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, a systematic presentation of her theory of concepts, and The Romantic Manifesto, a theory of aesthetics.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Rand\u2019s most significant professional relationship was with Nathaniel Branden. Branden, author of The Psychology of Self-Esteem and later known as a leader in the self-esteem movement in psychology, wrote many essays on philosophical and psychological topics that were published in Rand\u2019s books and periodicals. He was the founder and head of the Nathaniel Branden Institute, the leading Objectivist institution of the 1960s. Based in New York City, the Nathaniel Branden Institute published with Rand\u2019s sanction numerous periodicals and pamphlets and sponsored many lectures in New York that were then distributed on tape around the United States and the rest of the world. The rapid growth of the Nathaniel Branden Institute and the Objectivist movement came to a halt in 1968 when, for both professional and personal reasons, Rand and Branden parted ways.\n\nRand continued to write and lecture consistently until she stopped publishing The Ayn Rand Letter in 1976. Thereafter she wrote and lectured less as her husband\u2019s health declined, leading to his death in 1979, and as her own health began to decline. Rand died on March 6, 1982, in her New York City apartment.\n\n2. Rand\u2019s Ethical Theory: Rational Egoism\n\nThe provocative title of Ayn Rand\u2019s The Virtue of Selfishness matches an equally provocative thesis about ethics. Traditional ethics has always been suspicious of self-interest, praising acts that are selfless in intent and calling amoral or immoral acts that are motivated by self-interest. A self-interested person, on the traditional view, will not consider the interests of others and so will slight or harm those interests in the pursuit of his own.\n\nRand\u2019s view is that the exact opposite is true: Self-interest, properly understood, is the standard of morality and selflessness is the deepest immorality.\n\nSelf-interest rightly understood, according to Rand, is to see oneself as an end in oneself. That is to say that one\u2019s own life and happiness are one\u2019s highest values, and that one does not exist as a servant or slave to the interests of others. Nor do others exist as servants or slaves to one\u2019s own interests. Each person\u2019s own life and happiness are their ultimate ends. Self-interest rightly understood also entails self-responsibility: One\u2019s life is one\u2019s own, and so is the responsibility for sustaining and enhancing it. It is up to each of us to determine what values our lives require, how best to achieve those values, and to act to achieve those values.\n\nRand\u2019s ethic of self-interest is integral to her advocacy of classical liberalism. Classical liberalism, more often called \u201clibertarianism\u201d in the twentieth century, is the view that individuals should be free to pursue their own interests. This implies, politically, that governments should be limited to protecting each individual\u2019s freedom to do so. In other words, the moral legitimacy of self-interest implies that individuals have rights to their lives, their liberties, their property, and the pursuit of their own happiness, and that the purpose of government is to protect those rights. Economically, leaving individuals free to pursue their own interests implies in turn that only a capitalist or free market economic system is moral: Free individuals will use their time, money, and other property as they see fit, and will interact and trade voluntarily with others to mutual advantage.\n\n3. Reason and Ethics\n\nFundamentally, the means by which humans live is reason. Our capacity for reason is what enables us to survive and flourish. We are not born knowing what is good for us; that is learned. Nor are we born knowing how to achieve what is good for us; that too is learned. It is by reason that we learn what is food and what is poison, what animals are useful or dangerous to us, how to make tools, what forms of social organization are fruitful, and so on.\n\nThus, Rand advocates rational self-interest: One\u2019s interests are not whatever one happens to feel like; rather it is by reason that one identifies what is in one\u2019s interest and what is not. By the use of reason one takes into account all of the factors one can identify, projects the consequences of potential courses of action, and adopts principled policies of action.\n\nThe principled policies a person should adopt are called virtues. A virtue is an acquired character trait; it results from identifying a policy as good and committing to acting consistently in terms of that policy.\n\nOne such virtue is rationality: Having identified the use of reason as fundamentally good, the virtue of rationality is being committed to acting in accordance with reason. Another virtue is productiveness: Given that the values one needs to survive must be produced, the virtue of productiveness is being committed to producing those values. Another is honesty: Given that facts are facts and that one\u2019s life depends on knowing and acting in accordance with the facts, the virtue of honesty is being committed to awareness of the facts.\n\nIndependence and integrity are also core virtues for Rand\u2019s account of self-interest. Given that one must think and act by one\u2019s own efforts, being committed to the policy of independent action is a virtue. And given that one must both identify what is in one\u2019s interests and act to achieve it, the virtue of integrity is a policy of being committed to acting on the basis of one\u2019s beliefs. The opposite policy of believing one thing and doing another is of course the vice of hypocrisy; hypocrisy is a policy of self-destruction, on Rand\u2019s view.\n\nJustice is another core self-interested virtue: Justice, on Rand\u2019s account, means a policy of judging people, including oneself, according to their value and acting accordingly. The opposite policy of giving to people more or less than they deserve is injustice. The final virtue on Rand\u2019s list of core virtues is pride, the policy of \u201cmoral ambitiousness,\u201d in Rand\u2019s words. This means a policy of being committed to making oneself be the best one can be, of shaping one\u2019s character to the highest level possible.\n\nThe moral person, in summary, on Rand\u2019s account, is someone who acts and is committed to acting in their best self-interest. It is by living the morality of self-interest that one survives, flourishes, and achieves happiness.\n\n4. Criticisms of Rand\u2019s Ethics\n\nEvery aspect of Rand\u2019s philosophy is subject to lively criticism and debate, but her normative views are the ones most focused upon.\n\nFrom the broadly defined conservative right, the main criticisms are (a) that Rand\u2019s metaphysical naturalism involves an atheism that undercuts religious metaphysics, (b) that her strong emphasis upon empirical data and reason undercut epistemologies based on faith and tradition, and (c) that her normative individualism undercuts the commands of duty, obligation and selflessness that are necessary for achieving social values. From the left, again defined broadly, the main criticisms are (a) that Rand\u2019s individualism atomistically isolates each of us from genuine society, (b) that her advocacy of free markets enables strong-versus-weak exploitation, and in left-postmodern critique (c) that her philosophical fundamentals commit her to an untenable foundationalism and absolutism.\n\nHere we will focus only on the arguments over Rand\u2019s account of self-interest, which is currently a minority position and subject to strong criticism from both the philosophical left and the philosophical right.\n\nThe contrasting view of self-interest typically pits it against morality, holding that one is moral only to the extent that one sacrifices one\u2019s self-interest for the sake of others or, more moderately, to the extent one acts primarily with regard to the interests of others. For example, standard versions of morality will hold that one is moral to the extent one sets aside one\u2019s own interests in order to serve God, or the weak and the poor, or society as a whole. On these accounts, the interests of God, the poor, or society as a whole are held to be of greater moral significance than one\u2019s own, and so accordingly one\u2019s interests should be sacrificed when necessary. These ethics of selflessness thus believe that one should see oneself fundamentally as a servant, as existing to serve the interests of others, not one\u2019s own. \u201cSelfless service to others\u201d or \u201cselfless sacrifice\u201d are stock phrases indicating these accounts\u2019 view of appropriate motivation and action.\n\nOne core difference between Rand\u2019s self-interest view and the selfless view can be seen in the reason why most advocates of selflessness think self-interest is dangerous: conflicts of interest.\n\n5. Conflicts of Interest\n\nMost traditional ethics take conflicts of interest to be fundamental to the human condition, and take ethics to be the solution: Basic ethical principles are to tell us whose interests should be sacrificed in order to resolve the conflicts. If there is, for example, a fundamental conflict between what God wants and what humans naturally want, then religious ethics will make fundamental the principle that human wants should be sacrificed for God\u2019s. If there is a fundamental conflict between what society needs and what individuals want, then some versions of secular ethics will make fundamental the principle that the individual\u2019s wants should be sacrificed for society\u2019s.\n\nTaking conflicts of interest to be fundamental almost always stems from one of two beliefs: that human nature is fundamentally destructive or that economic resources are scarce. If human nature is fundamentally destructive, then humans are naturally in conflict with each other. Many ethical philosophies start from this premise\u2014for example, Plato\u2019s myth of Gyges, Jewish and Christian accounts of original sin, and Freud\u2019s account of the id. If what individuals naturally want to do to each other is rape, steal, and kill, then in order to have society these individual desires need to be sacrificed. Consequently, a basic principle of ethics will be to urge individuals to suppress their natural desires so that society can exist. In other words, self-interest is the enemy, and must be sacrificed for others.\n\nIf economic resources are scarce, then there is not enough to go around. This scarcity then puts human beings in fundamental conflict with each other: For one individual\u2019s need to be satisfied, another\u2019s must be sacrificed. Many ethical philosophies begin with this premise. For example, Thomas Malthus\u2019s theory that population growth outstrips growth in the food supply falls into this category. Karl Marx\u2019s account of capitalist society is that brutal competition leads to the exploitation of some by others. Garrett Hardin\u2019s famous use of the lifeboat analogy asks us to imagine that society is like a lifeboat with more people than its resources can support. And so, in order to solve the problem of destructive competition the lack of resources leads us to, a basic principle of ethics will be to urge individuals to sacrifice their interests in obtaining more, or even some, so that others may obtain more or some and society can exist peacefully. In other words, in a situation of scarcity, self-interest is the enemy and must be sacrificed for others.\n\nRand rejects both the scarce resources and destructive human nature premises. Human beings are not born in sin or with destructive desires; nor do they necessarily acquire them in the course of growing to maturity. Instead one is born morally tabula rasa (\u201cblank slate\u201d), and through one\u2019s choices and actions one acquires one\u2019s character traits and habits. As Rand phrased it, \u201cMan is a being of self-made soul.\u201d Having chronic desires to steal, rape, or kill others is the result of mistaken development and the acquisition of bad habits, just as are chronic laziness or the habit of eating too much junk food. And just as one is not born lazy but can by one\u2019s choices develop oneself into a person of vigor or sloth, one is not born antisocial but can by one\u2019s choices develop oneself into a person of cooperativeness or conflict.\n\nNor are resources scarce, according to Rand, in any fundamental way. By the use of reason, humans can discover new resources and how to use existing resources more efficiently, including recycling where appropriate and making productive processes more efficient. Humans have, for example, continually discovered and developed new energy resources, from animals to wood to coal to oil to nuclear fission to solar panels; and there is no end in sight to this process. At any given moment, the available resources are a fixed amount, but over time the stock of resources are and have been constantly expanding.\n\nBecause humans are rational they can produce an ever-expanding number of goods, and so human interests do not fundamentally conflict with each other. Instead, Rand holds that the exact opposite is true: Since humans can and should be productive, human interests are deeply in harmony with each other. For example, my producing more corn is in harmony with your producing more peas, for by our both being productive and trading with each other we are both better off. It is to your interest that I be successful in producing more corn, just as it is to my interest that you be successful in producing more peas.\n\nConflicts of interest do exist within a narrower scope. For example, in the immediate present available resources are more fixed, and so competition for those resources results, and competition produces winners and losers. Economic competition, however, is a broader form of cooperation, a social way to allocate resources without resorting to physical force and violence. By competition, resources are allocated efficiently and peacefully, and in the long run more resources are produced. Thus, a competitive economic system is in the self-interest of all of us.\n\nAccordingly, Rand argues that her ethic of self-interest is the basis for personal happiness and free and prosperous societies.\n\n6. Rand\u2019s Influence\n\nThe impact of Rand\u2019s ideas is difficult to measure, but it has been large. All her books were still in print as of 2017, had sold more than thirty million copies, and continued to sell approximately one million copies each year. A survey jointly conducted by the Library of Congress and the Book of the Month Club early in the 1990s asked readers to name the book that had most influenced their lives: Atlas Shrugged was second only to the Bible. Excerpts from Rand\u2019s works are regularly reprinted in college textbooks and anthologies, and several volumes have been published posthumously containing her early writings, journals, and letters. As an outsider with iconoclastic views, Rand\u2019s influence within the academic world has been limited, though university press books and scholarly articles about her work continue to be published regularly. Outside the academic world are several institutes founded by those influenced by Rand. Noteworthy among these are the Cato Institute, based in Washington, D.C., the leading libertarian think tank. Rand, along with Nobel Prize-winners Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, was highly instrumental in attracting generations of individuals to the libertarian movement. Also noteworthy are the Ayn Rand Institute, founded in 1985 by philosopher Leonard Peikoff and entrepreneur Edward Snider and based in California, and The Atlas Society, founded in 1990 by philosopher David Kelley and based in Washington, D.C.\n\n7.

Her father was upwardly mobile and a pharmacist and her mother was socially ambitious and religiously observant.[13] Rand later said she found school unchallenging and began writing screenplays at the age of eight and novels at the age of ten.[14] At the prestigious Stoiunina Gymnasium, her closest friend was Vladimir Nabokov's younger sister, Olga. The two girls shared an intense interest in politics and would engage in debates at the Nabokov mansion: while Olga defended constitutional monarchy, Alisa supported republican ideals.[15]\n\nShe was twelve at the time of the February Revolution of 1917, during which she favored Alexander Kerensky over Tsar Nicholas II. The subsequent October Revolution and the rule of the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin disrupted the life the family had previously enjoyed. Her father's business was confiscated, and the family fled to the Crimean Peninsula, which was initially under control of the White Army during the Russian Civil War. While in high school, she realized that she was an atheist and valued reason above any other human virtue. After graduating from high school in the Crimea in June 1921, she returned with her family to Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg was renamed at that time), where they faced desperate conditions, on occasion nearly starving.[16][17]\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution, universities were opened to women, allowing her to be in the first group of women to enroll at Petrograd State University.[18] At the age of 16, she began her studies in the department of social pedagogy, majoring in history.[19] At the university she was introduced to the writings of Aristotle and Plato,[20] who would be her greatest influence and counter-influence, respectively.[21] She also studied the philosophical works of Friedrich Nietzsche.[22] Able to read French, German and Russian, she also discovered the writers Fyodor Dostoevsky, Victor Hugo, Edmond Rostand, and Friedrich Schiller, who became her perennial favorites.[23]\n\nAlong with many other bourgeois students, she was purged from the university shortly before graduating. After complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists, however, many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate,[24] which she did in October 1924.[25] She then studied for a year at the State Technicum for Screen Arts in Leningrad. For an assignment she wrote an essay about the Polish actress Pola Negri, which became her first published work.[26]\n\nBy this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be Rand,[27] possibly because it is graphically similar to a vowelless excerpt \u0420\u0437\u043d\u0431 of her birth surname in Cyrillic handwriting,[28] and she adopted the first name Ayn, either from a Finnish name Aino or from the Hebrew word \u05e2\u05d9\u05df (ayin, meaning \"eye\").[b]\n\nArrival in the United States [ edit ]\n\n[26] Cover of Rand's first published work, a 2,500-word monograph on actress Pola Negri published in 1925\n\nIn late 1925, Rand was granted a visa to visit relatives in Chicago.[31] She departed on January 17, 1926.[32] When she arrived in New York City on February 19, 1926, she was so impressed with the skyline of Manhattan that she cried what she later called \"tears of splendor\".[33] Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter, she lived for a few months with her relatives, one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films free of charge. She then left for Hollywood, California.[34]\n\nIn Hollywood, a chance meeting with famed director Cecil B. DeMille led to work as an extra in his film The King of Kings and a subsequent job as a junior screenwriter.[35] While working on The King of Kings, she met an aspiring young actor, Frank O'Connor; the two were married on April 15, 1929. She became a permanent American resident in July 1929 and an American citizen on March 3, 1931.[36] Taking various jobs during the 1930s to support her writing, she worked for a time as the head of the costume department at RKO Studios.[37] She made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the United States, but they were unable to acquire permission to emigrate.[38]\n\nEarly fiction [ edit ]\n\nRand's first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay Red Pawn to Universal Studios in 1932, although it was never produced.[39] This was followed by the courtroom drama Night of January 16th, first produced by E. E. Clive in Hollywood in 1934 and then successfully reopened on Broadway in 1935. Each night a jury was selected from members of the audience; based on the jury's vote, one of two different endings would be performed.[40] In 1941, Paramount Pictures produced a movie loosely based on the play. Rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result.[41] Ideal is a novel and play written in 1934 which were first published in 2015 by her estate. The heroine is an actress who embodies Randian ideals.[42]\n\nRand's first published novel, the semi-autobiographical We the Living, was published in 1936. Set in Soviet Russia, it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state. In a 1959 foreword to the novel, Rand stated that We the Living \"is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write. It is not an autobiography in the literal, but only in the intellectual sense. The plot is invented, the background is not ...\"[43] Initial sales were slow and the American publisher let it go out of print,[44] although European editions continued to sell.[45] After the success of her later novels, Rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies.[46] In 1942, without Rand's knowledge or permission, the novel was made into a pair of Italian films, Noi vivi and Addio, Kira. Rediscovered in the 1960s, these films were re-edited into a new version which was approved by Rand and re-released as We the Living in 1986.[47]\n\nHer novella Anthem was written during a break from the writing of her next major novel, The Fountainhead. It presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word 'I' has been forgotten and replaced with 'we'.[48] It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher. As with We the Living, Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies.[49]\n\nThe Fountainhead and political activism [ edit ]\n\nDuring the 1940s, Rand became politically active. She and her husband worked as full-time volunteers for the 1940 presidential campaign of Republican Wendell Willkie. This work led to Rand's first public speaking experiences; she enjoyed fielding sometimes hostile questions from New York City audiences who had viewed pro-Willkie newsreels.[50] This activity brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free-market capitalism. She became friends with journalist Henry Hazlitt and his wife, and Hazlitt introduced her to the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises. Despite her philosophical differences with them, Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career, and both of them expressed admiration for her. Mises once referred to Rand as \"the most courageous man in America\", a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said \"man\" instead of \"woman\".[51] Rand also became friends with libertarian writer Isabel Paterson. Rand questioned Paterson about American history and politics long into the night during their many meetings and gave Paterson ideas for her only non-fiction book, The God of the Machine.[52]\n\nRand's first major success as a writer came in 1943 with The Fountainhead, a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years.[53] The novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named Howard Roark and his struggle against what Rand described as \"second-handers\"\u2014those who attempt to live through others, placing others above themselves. It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the Bobbs-Merrill Company on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden, who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it.[54] While completing the novel, Rand was prescribed the amphetamine Benzedrine to fight fatigue.[55] The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel, but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks' rest.[56] Her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings.[57]\n\nThe Fountainhead became a worldwide success, bringing Rand fame and financial security.[58] In 1943, Rand sold the rights for a film version to Warner Bros. and she returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay. Finishing her work on that screenplay, she was hired by producer Hal B. Wallis as a screenwriter and script-doctor. Her work for Wallis included the screenplays for the Oscar-nominated Love Letters and You Came Along.[59] Rand also worked on other projects, including a planned nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called The Moral Basis of Individualism. Although the planned book was never completed, a condensed version was published as an essay titled \"The Only Path to Tomorrow\" in the January 1944 edition of Reader's Digest magazine.[60]\n\nRand extended her involvement with free-market and anti-communist activism while working in Hollywood. She became involved with the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, a Hollywood anti-Communist group, and wrote articles on the group's behalf. She also joined the anti-Communist American Writers Association.[61] A visit by Isabel Paterson to meet with Rand's California associates led to a final falling out between the two when Paterson made comments, which Rand considered rude, to valued political allies.[62] In 1947, during the Second Red Scare, Rand testified as a \"friendly witness\" before the United States House Un-American Activities Committee. Her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the Soviet Union and the portrayal of it in the 1944 film Song of Russia.[63] Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union, portraying life there as much better and happier than it actually was.[64] She wanted to also criticize the lauded 1946 film The Best Years of Our Lives for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world, but she was not allowed to testify about it.[65] When asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations, Rand described the process as \"futile\".[66]\n\nAfter several delays, the film version of The Fountainhead was released in 1949. Although it used Rand's screenplay with minimal alterations, she \"disliked the movie from beginning to end\", and complained about its editing, acting, and other elements.[67]\n\nAtlas Shrugged and Objectivism [ edit ]\n\nAnthem was reprinted in the June 1953 issue of the pulp magazine Famous Fantastic Mysteries. Rand's novellawas reprinted in the June 1953 issue of the pulp magazine\n\nIn the years following the publication of The Fountainhead, Rand received numerous letters from readers, some of whom the book profoundly influenced. In 1951, Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City, where she gathered a group of these admirers around her. This group (jokingly designated \"The Collective\") included future Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later Nathaniel Branden) and his wife Barbara and Barbara's cousin Leonard Peikoff. Initially the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy. She later began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel, Atlas Shrugged, as the manuscript pages were written. In 1954 Rand's close relationship with the younger Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the consent of their spouses.[68]\n\nAtlas Shrugged, published in 1957, was considered Rand's magnum opus.[69] Rand described the theme of the novel as \"the role of the mind in man's existence\u2014and, as a corollary, the demonstration of a new moral philosophy: the morality of rational self-interest\".[70] It advocates the core tenets of Rand's philosophy of Objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement. The plot involves a dystopian United States in which the most creative industrialists, scientists, and artists respond to a welfare state government by going on strike and retreating to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy. The novel's hero and leader of the strike, John Galt, describes the strike as \"stopping the motor of the world\" by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nation's wealth and achievement. With this fictional strike, Rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive, the economy would collapse and society would fall apart. The novel includes elements of mystery, romance, and science fiction,[71][72] and it contains an extended exposition of Objectivism in the form of a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt.[73]\n\nDespite many negative reviews, Atlas Shrugged became an international bestseller. In an interview with Mike Wallace, Rand declared herself \"the most creative thinker alive\".[74] However, Rand was discouraged and depressed by the reaction of intellectuals to the novel.[75] Atlas Shrugged was Rand's last completed work of fiction; it marked the end of her career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher.[76]\n\nIn 1958, Nathaniel Branden established Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI), to promote Rand's philosophy. Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for Objectivist periodicals that she edited. Rand later published some of these articles in book form. Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, later described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand, with some describing NBI or the Objectivist movement itself as a cult or religion.[77] Rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics, from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair, and some of her followers mimicked her preferences, wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers.[78] However, some former NBI students believed the extent of these behaviors was exaggerated, and the problem was concentrated among Rand's closest followers in New York.[79] Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students[80] and held them to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her.[81]\n\nLater years [ edit ]\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as Yale, Princeton, Columbia,[82] Harvard, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[83] She received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Lewis & Clark College on 2 October 1963.[84] She also began delivering annual lectures at the Ford Hall Forum, responding afterward to questions from the audience.[85] During these speeches and Q&A sessions, she often took controversial stances on political and social issues of the day. These included supporting abortion rights,[86] opposing the Vietnam War and the military draft (but condemning many draft dodgers as \"bums\"),[87] supporting Israel in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 against a coalition of Arab nations as \"civilized men fighting savages\",[88] saying European colonists had the right to develop land taken from American Indians,[89] and calling homosexuality \"immoral\" and \"disgusting\", while also advocating the repeal of all laws about it.[90] She also endorsed several Republican candidates for President of the United States, most strongly Barry Goldwater in 1964, whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for The Objectivist Newsletter.[91]\n\nIn 1964, Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the young actress Patrecia Scott, whom he later married. Nathaniel and Barbara Branden kept the affair hidden from Rand. When she learned of it in 1968, though her romantic relationship with Branden had already ended,[92] Rand terminated her relationship with both Brandens, which led to the closure of NBI.[93] Rand published an article in The Objectivist repudiating Nathaniel Branden for dishonesty and other \"irrational behavior in his private life\".[94] Branden later apologized in an interview to \"every student of Objectivism\" for \"perpetuating the Ayn Rand mystique\" and for \"contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repressiveness that pervades the Objectivist movement\".[95] In subsequent years, Rand and several more of her closest associates parted company.[96]\n\nRand underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking.[97] In 1976, she retired from writing her newsletter and, despite her initial objections, she allowed social worker Evva Pryor, an employee of her attorney, to enroll her in Social Security and Medicare.[98][99] During the late 1970s her activities within the Objectivist movement declined, especially after the death of her husband on November 9, 1979.[100] One of her final projects was work on a never-completed television adaptation of Atlas Shrugged.[101]\n\nRand died of heart failure on March 6, 1982, at her home in New York City,[102] and was interred in the Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, New York.[103] Rand's funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers, including Alan Greenspan. A 6-foot (1.8 m) floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket.[104] In her will, Rand named Leonard Peikoff to inherit her estate.[105]\n\nPhilosophy [ edit ]\n\nRand called her philosophy \"Objectivism\", describing its essence as \"the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute\".[106] She considered Objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics.[107]\n\nIn metaphysics, Rand supported philosophical realism, and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism, including all forms of religion.[108]\n\nIn epistemology, she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception, the validity of which she considered axiomatic,[109] and reason, which she described as \"the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man's senses\".[110] She rejected all claims of non-perceptual or a priori knowledge, including \"'instinct,' 'intuition,' 'revelation,' or any form of 'just knowing'\".[111] In her Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, Rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic\u2013synthetic dichotomy.[112]\n\nIn ethics, Rand argued for rational and ethical egoism (rational self-interest), as the guiding moral principle. She said the individual should \"exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself\".[113] She referred to egoism as \"the virtue of selfishness\" in her book of that title,[114] in which she presented her solution to the is-ought problem by describing a meta-ethical theory that based morality in the needs of \"man's survival qua man\".[115] She condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness,[9] and held that the initiation of force was evil and irrational, writing in Atlas Shrugged that \"Force and mind are opposites.\"[116]\n\nRand's political philosophy emphasized individual rights (including property rights),[117] and she considered laissez-faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights.[4] She opposed statism, which she understood to include theocracy, absolute monarchy, Nazism, fascism, communism, democratic socialism, and dictatorship.[118] Rand believed that natural rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government.[119] Although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian, she preferred the term \"radical for capitalism\". She worked with conservatives on political projects, but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics.[120] She denounced libertarianism, which she associated with anarchism.[121] She rejected anarchism as a na\u00efve theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice.[122]\n\nIn aesthetics, Rand defined art as a \"selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments\". According to her, art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped, thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness.[123] As a writer, the art form Rand focused on most closely was literature, where she considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will.[124] She described her own approach to literature as \"romantic realism\".[125]\n\nRand acknowledged Aristotle as her greatest influence[126] and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend \"three A's\"\u2014Aristotle, Aquinas, and Ayn Rand.[127] In a 1959 interview with Mike Wallace, when asked where her philosophy came from she responded: \"Out of my own mind, with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle, the only philosopher who ever influenced me. I devised the rest of my philosophy myself.\"[128] However, she also found early inspiration in Friedrich Nietzsche,[129] and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from Rand's journals,[130] in passages from the first edition of We the Living (which Rand later revised),[131] and in her overall writing style.[132] However, by the time she wrote The Fountainhead, Rand had turned against Nietzsche's ideas,[133] and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed.[134] Rational egoism was embodied by Russian author Nikolay Chernyshevsky in the 1863 novel What Is to Be Done?[135] and several critics[136] claim that What Is to Be Done? is one of the sources of inspiration for Rand's thought. For example, the book's main character Lopuhov says \"I am not a man to make sacrifices. And indeed there are no such things. One acts in the way that one finds most pleasant.\"[137] Among the philosophers Rand held in particular disdain was Immanuel Kant, whom she referred to as a \"monster\",[138] although philosophers George Walsh[139] and Fred Seddon[140] have argued that she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences.\n\nRand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her \"theory of concepts, [her] ethics, and [her] discovery in politics that evil\u2014the violation of rights\u2014consists of the initiation of force\".[141] She believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy,[142] stating: \"I am not primarily an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism; and I am not primarily an advocate of egoism, but of reason. If one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently, all the rest follows.\"[143]\n\nReception and legacy [ edit ]\n\nCritical reception [ edit ]\n\nDuring Rand's lifetime, her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation. Rand's first novel, We the Living, was admired by the literary critic H. L. Mencken,[144] her Broadway play Night of January 16th was both a critical and popular success,[145] and The Fountainhead was hailed by The New York Times reviewer Lorine Pruette as \"masterful\".[146] Rand's novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as being long and melodramatic.[6] However, they became bestsellers largely through word of mouth.[147]\n\nThe first reviews Rand received were for Night of January 16th. Reviews of the production were largely positive, but Rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer.[145] Rand believed that her first novel, We the Living, was not widely reviewed, but Rand scholar Michael S. Berliner says \"it was the most reviewed of any of her works\", with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications. Overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work.[148] Her 1938 novella Anthem received little attention from reviewers, both for its first publication in England and for subsequent re-issues.[149]\n\nRand's first bestseller, The Fountainhead, received far fewer reviews than We the Living, and reviewers' opinions were mixed.[150] Lorine Pruette's positive review in The New York Times was one that Rand greatly appreciated.[151] Pruette called Rand \"a writer of great power\" who wrote \"brilliantly, beautifully and bitterly\", and stated that \"you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time\".[146] There were other positive reviews, but Rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications.[150] Some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel,[6] such as one that called it \"a whale of a book\" and another that said \"anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper-rationing\". Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rand's style \"offensively pedestrian\".[150]\n\nRand's 1957 novel Atlas Shrugged was widely reviewed and many of the reviews were strongly negative.[6][152] In National Review, conservative author Whittaker Chambers called the book \"sophomoric\" and \"remarkably silly\". He described the tone of the book as \"shrillness without reprieve\" and accused Rand of supporting a godless system (which he related to that of the Soviets), claiming \"From almost any page of Atlas Shrugged, a voice can be heard, from painful necessity, commanding: 'To a gas chamber\u2014go!'\".[153] Atlas Shrugged received positive reviews from a few publications, including praise from the noted book reviewer John Chamberlain,[152] but Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein later wrote that \"reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put-downs\", calling it \"execrable claptrap\" and \"a nightmare\"\u2014they also said it was \"written out of hate\" and showed \"remorseless hectoring and prolixity\".[6]\n\nRand's nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had. The tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book, For the New Intellectual, was similar to that for Atlas Shrugged,[154][155] with philosopher Sidney Hook likening her certainty to \"the way philosophy is written in the Soviet Union\",[156] and author Gore Vidal calling her viewpoint \"nearly perfect in its immorality\".[157] Her subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers.[154]\n\nOn the 100th anniversary of Rand's birth in 2005, Edward Rothstein, writing for The New York Times, referred to her fictional writing as quaint utopian \"retro fantasy\" and programmatic neo-Romanticism of the misunderstood artist while criticizing her characters' \"isolated rejection of democratic society\".[158] In 2007, book critic Leslie Clark described her fiction as \"romance novels with a patina of pseudo-philosophy\".[159] In 2009, GQ's critic columnist Tom Carson described her books as \"capitalism's version of middlebrow religious novels\" such as Ben-Hur and the Left Behind series.[160]\n\nPopular interest [ edit ]\n\nIn 1991, a survey conducted for the Library of Congress and the Book-of-the-Month Club asked club members what the most influential book in the respondent's life was. Rand's Atlas Shrugged was the second most popular choice, after the Bible.[161] Rand's books continue to be widely sold and read, with over 29 million copies sold as of 2013 (with about 10% of that total purchased for free distribution to schools by the Ayn Rand Institute).[162] In 1998, Modern Library readers voted Atlas Shrugged the 20th century's finest work of fiction, followed by The Fountainhead in second place, Anthem in seventh, and We the Living eighth; none of the four appeared on the critics' list.[163] Although Rand's influence has been greatest in the United States, there has been international interest in her work.[7][164] Rand's work continues to be among the top sellers among books in India.[165]\n\nRand's contemporary admirers included fellow novelists, such as Ira Levin, Kay Nolte Smith and L. Neil Smith; and later writers such as Erika Holzer and Terry Goodkind have been influenced by her.[166] Other artists who have cited Rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include comic book artist Steve Ditko[167] and musician Neil Peart of Rush.[168] Rand provided a positive view of business and in response business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work.[169] John Allison of BB&T and Ed Snider of Comcast Spectacor have funded the promotion of Rand's ideas,[170] while Mark Cuban (owner of the Dallas Mavericks) as well as John P. Mackey (CEO of Whole Foods) among others have said they consider Rand crucial to their success.[171]\n\nRand and her works have been referred to in a variety of media: on television shows including animated sitcoms, live-action comedies, dramas, and game shows,[172] as well as in movies and video games.[173] She, or a character based on her, figures prominently (in positive and negative lights) in literary and science fiction novels by prominent American authors.[174] Nick Gillespie, editor in chief of Reason, has remarked that \"Rand's is a tortured immortality, one in which she's as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist...\" and that \"jibes at Rand as cold and inhuman, run through the popular culture\".[175] Two movies have been made about Rand's life. A 1997 documentary film, Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.[176] The Passion of Ayn Rand, a 1999 television adaptation of the book of the same name, won several awards.[177] Rand's image also appears on a 1999 U.S. postage stamp illustrated by artist Nick Gaetano.[178]\n\nPolitical influence [ edit ]\n\nAlthough she rejected the labels \"conservative\" and \"libertarian\",[179] Rand has had continuing influence on right-wing politics and libertarianism.[11] Jim Powell, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, considers Rand one of the three most important women (along with Rose Wilder Lane and Isabel Paterson) of modern American libertarianism,[180] and David Nolan, one of the founders of the Libertarian Party, stated that \"without Ayn Rand, the libertarian movement would not exist\".[181] In his history of the libertarian movement, journalist Brian Doherty described her as \"the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large\"[161] and biographer Jennifer Burns referred to her as \"the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right\".[182] Economist and Ayn Rand student George Reisman wrote: \"Ayn Rand...in particular, must be cited as providing a philosophical foundation for the case of capitalism, and as being responsible probably more than anyone else for the current spread of pro-capitalist ideas.\"[183]\n\nShe faced intense opposition from William F. Buckley, Jr. and other contributors for the National Review magazine. They published numerous criticisms in the 1950s and 1960s by Whittaker Chambers, Garry Wills, and M. Stanton Evans. Nevertheless, her influence among conservatives forced Buckley and other National Review contributors to reconsider how traditional notions of virtue and Christianity could be integrated with support for capitalism.[184]\n\nThe political figures who cite Rand as an influence are usually conservatives (often members of the Republican Party),[185] despite Rand taking some positions that are atypical for conservatives, such as being pro-choice and an atheist.[186] A 1987 article in The New York Times referred to her as the Reagan administration's \"novelist laureate\".[187] Republican Congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and have recommended her novels.[188]\n\nThe financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 spurred renewed interest in her works, especially Atlas Shrugged, which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis.[189] Opinion articles compared real-world events with the plot of the novel.[190] During this time, signs mentioning Rand and her fictional hero John Galt appeared at Tea Party protests.[191] There was also increased criticism of her ideas, especially from the political left, with critics blaming the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets, particularly through her influence on Alan Greenspan.[192] For example, Mother Jones remarked that \"Rand's particular genius has always been her ability to turn upside down traditional hierarchies and recast the wealthy, the talented, and the powerful as the oppressed\"[186] while equating Randian individual well-being with that of the Volk according to Goebbels. Corey Robin of The Nation alleged similarities between the \"moral syntax of Randianism\" and fascism.[193]\n\nAcademic reaction [ edit ]\n\nDuring Rand's lifetime, her work received little attention from academic scholars.[10] When the first academic book about Rand's philosophy appeared in 1971, its author declared writing about Rand \"a treacherous undertaking\" that could lead to \"guilt by association\" for taking her seriously.[194] A few articles about Rand's ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982, many of them in The Personalist.[195] One of these was \"On the Randian Argument\" by libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick, who argued that her meta-ethical argument is unsound and fails to solve the is\u2013ought problem posed by David Hume.[196] Some responses to Nozick by other academic philosophers were also published in The Personalist arguing that Nozick misstated Rand's case.[195] Academic consideration of Rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited. Academic Mimi Gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about Rand's novels when she began researching her in 1973, and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s.[197]\n\nSince Rand's death, interest in her work has gradually increased.[198] Historian Jennifer Burns has identified \"three overlapping waves\" of scholarly interest in Rand, the most recent of which is \"an explosion of scholarship\" since the year 2000.[199] However, few universities currently include Rand or Objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area, with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study.[200]\n\nGladstein, Harry Binswanger, Allan Gotthelf, John Hospers, Edwin A. Locke, Wallace Matson, Leonard Peikoff, Chris Matthew Sciabarra, and Tara Smith have taught her work in academic institutions. Sciabarra co-edits the Journal of Ayn Rand Studies, a nonpartisan peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the study of Rand's philosophical and literary work.[201] In 1987 Gotthelf, George Walsh and David Kelley co-founded the Ayn Rand Society, a group affiliated with the American Philosophical Association.[202] In 2012, the University of Pittsburgh Press launched an \"Ayn Rand Society Philosophical Studies\" series based on the proceedings of the Society.[203] Smith has written several academic books and papers on Rand's ideas, including Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist, a volume on Rand's ethical theory published by Cambridge University Press. Rand's ideas have also been made subjects of study at Clemson and Duke universities.[204] Scholars of English and American literature have largely ignored her work,[205] although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s.[206]\n\nRand scholars Douglas Den Uyl and Douglas B. Rasmussen, while stressing the importance and originality of her thought, describe her style as \"literary, hyperbolic and emotional\".[207] Philosopher Jack Wheeler says that despite \"the incessant bombast and continuous venting of Randian rage\", Rand's ethics are \"a most immense achievement, the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought\".[208] In the Literary Encyclopedia entry for Rand written in 2001, John David Lewis declared that \"Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation\".[209] In a 1999 interview in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Sciabarra commented, \"I know they laugh at Rand\", while forecasting a growth of interest in her work in the academic community.[210]\n\nLibertarian philosopher Michael Huemer argues that very few people find Rand's ideas convincing, especially her ethics,[211] which he believes are difficult to interpret and may lack logical coherence.[212] He attributes the attention she receives to her being a \"compelling writer\", especially as a novelist. Atlas Shrugged thus outsells Rand's non-fiction works as well as the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism such as Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, or Frederic Bastiat.[211]\n\nPolitical scientist Charles Murray, while praising Rand's literary accomplishments, criticizes her claim that her only \"philosophical debt\" was to Aristotle, instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as John Locke and Friedrich Nietzsche.[213] Although Rand maintained that Objectivism was an integrated philosophical system, philosopher Robert H. Bass argues that her central ethical ideas are inconsistent and contradictory to her central political ideas.[214]\n\nObjectivist movement [ edit ]\n\nIn 1985, Rand's intellectual heir Leonard Peikoff established the Ayn Rand Institute, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Rand's ideas and works. In 1990, after an ideological disagreement with Peikoff, philosopher David Kelley founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies, now known as The Atlas Society.[215] In 2001, historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship, which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia.[216] The charitable foundation of BB&T Corporation has also given grants for teaching Rand's ideas or works. The University of Texas at Austin, the University of Pittsburgh, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are among the schools that have received grants. In some cases, these grants have been controversial due to their requiring research or teaching related to Rand.[217]\n\nSelected works [ edit ]\n\nNovels:\n\nOther fiction:\n\nNon-fiction:\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\n^ Russian: \u0410\u043b\u0438\u0301\u0441\u0430 \u0417\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0301\u0432\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0431\u0430\u0301\u0443\u043c ^ Ayn was Finnish,[29] but some biographical sources question this, suggesting it may come from a Hebrew nickname.[30] Rand said the origin ofwas Finnish,but some biographical sources question this, suggesting it may come from a Hebrew nickname.\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nWorks cited [ edit ]"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ayn-Rand", "page_content": "Top Questions Who was Ayn Rand? Ayn Rand was a Russian-born American author and philosopher. Rand authored two best-selling novels, The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged (1957). Her novels were especially influential among conservatives and libertarians from the mid-20th century. Where is Ayn Rand from? Ayn Rand was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, on February 2, 1905. When the tsarist regime was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917, her family moved to Crimea, where she finished high school. She returned to Russia in 1921 and then moved to the United States in 1926. What is Ayn Rand\u2019s real name? Ayn Rand is the pen name of Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum. She adopted it when she moved to the United States in 1926. The first name, which rhymes with \u201cpine,\u201d was inspired by the name of a Finnish writer (whom she declined to identify), and the surname she described as an abbreviation of Rosenbaum. When did Ayn Rand begin writing? Ayn Rand arrived in Chicago in 1926 and then moved to Hollywood, where she met American filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille. Her chance encounter with DeMille led to work as a movie extra and eventually to a job as a screenwriter. Rand sold her first screenplay, Red Pawn, to Universal Studios in 1932. What are Ayn Rand\u2019s most famous works? Rand\u2019s first major work, The Fountainhead, was published in 1943. It details the struggle of a genius architect against mediocrity. Her second major work, Atlas Shrugged, was published in 1957. It follows a railroad executive and a steel magnate as they grapple with a collectivist government. Both The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged explicate Rand\u2019s personal philosophy of objectivism. How did Ayn Rand die? Rand died of heart failure on March 6, 1982, in New York City. At the time, she had been working on a television adaptation of her novel Atlas Shrugged.\n\nAyn Rand, original name Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum, (born February 2, 1905, St. Petersburg, Russia\u2014died March 6, 1982, New York, New York, U.S.), Russian-born American writer whose commercially successful novels promoting individualism and laissez-faire capitalism were influential among conservatives and libertarians and popular among generations of young people in the United States from the mid-20th century.\n\nEarly life and career Her father, Zinovy Rosenbaum, was a prosperous pharmacist. After being tutored at home, Alissa Rosenbaum, the eldest of three children, was enrolled in a progressive school, where she excelled academically but was socially isolated. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, her father\u2019s shop was confiscated by communist authorities, an event she deeply resented. As a student at Leningrad State University, she studied history and became acquainted with the works of Plato and Aristotle. After graduating in 1924, she enrolled in the State Institute for Cinematography, hoping to become a screenwriter. The arrival of a letter from cousins in Chicago gave her an opportunity to leave the country on the pretext of gaining expertise that she could apply in the Soviet film industry. Upon her arrival in the United States in 1926, she changed her name to Ayn Rand. (The first name, which rhymes with \u201cpine,\u201d was inspired by the name of a Finnish writer, whom she never identified, and the surname she described as an abbreviation of Rosenbaum.) After six months in Chicago she moved to Hollywood, where a fortuitous encounter with the producer Cecil B. DeMille led to work as a movie extra and eventually to a job as a screenwriter. In 1929 she married the actor Frank O\u2019Connor. Soon hired as a filing clerk in the wardrobe department of RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., she rose to head of the department within a year, meanwhile writing stories, plays, and film scenarios in her spare time. She became an American citizen in 1931."}, {"url": "https://aynrand.org/about/timeline/", "page_content": "1982\n\nRand held that each one of us is guided by philosophic ideas, whether we know this or not and whether we choose to think about ideas or not.

West Point, where Rand addressed graduating class in 1974"}, {"url": "https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ayn-rand", "page_content": "The life and work of Ayn Rand, the novelist and philosopher who promoted an ethics called \"Objectivism,\" provide ample evidence for those who believe that human beings are inherently self-contradictory and illogical. In her novels, Rand glorified the self-made man who aggressively demonstrated his superiority over the masses through his business acumen. As a writer, Rand had little to do with entrepreneurial activities. While she did eventually make money from her writing, she always lived frugally. Her husband of fifty years was a quiet and reserved man, never financially successful, who was happiest in his garden or painting at his easel. Her ideal physical types were tall, blond, muscular men and delicate, graceful blonde women-she herself was small, dark, and never at ease with her body. She believed passionately in the importance of the individual, yet her books developed a cultlike following among the millions of people who read them. The chief irony is that Rand became best known for her insistence on the primacy of human reason.\n\nThe eldest of three sisters, Ayn Rand was born Alissa Rosenbaum on February 2, 1905, in St. Petersburg, Russia, to Fronz and Anna Rosenbaum. Her father, a pharmacist, had his own shop, a rare position for Jews in Russia. A precocious child, Alyssa declared herself an atheist in her early teens, and while she never denied her Jewish heritage, she also never softened her opposition to religion or any other form of \"mysticism.\" The privations she and her family endured as a result of the Russian Revolution, Including the Bolsheviks taking possession of her father's business, affected her deeply. Somehow she managed to survive the purges of bourgeois students long enough to obtain a degree in history from the University of Leningrad in 1924. At the university, she took a few classes in American political history and found the principles expressed in the Declaration of Independence fascinating.\n\nDespite the progressively isolationist policy of the Soviets, some Western exports still found their way to Russia in the 1920s. For Alyssa, the most important were American movies. Conditions in the United States-at least as depicted on the screen-impressed her as strongly as conditions at home repelled her, so when distant cousins provided the miraculous opportunity to travel to the United States, she did not hesitate. She turned twenty-one in Berlin, on her way to America. At immigration, she announced that her first name was Ayn (pronounced to rhyme with \"pine\"). Shortly after, she chose the second part of her beloved typewriter's brand name for her surname.\n\nDeciding that Chicago, her cousins' home, was too provincial, she moved to California to write for the movies. A fluke encounter with Cecil B. DeMille on her second day in Hollywood led to a job as an extra in the film The King of Kings. This gave her a glimpse of a bit player named Frank O'Connor, the man she would marry in April 1929. But her ambition to write for the movies was not so easily fulfilled, and she scraped by for years on the salary she earned working in RKO's wardrobe department, writing in her spare time. Her first break came with a stage play Night of January 16th, which was produced on Broadway during the 1935 season. Royalties from the modestly successful play gave her the freedom to concentrate on her writing\n\nRand's first novel, We the Living, appeared in 1936. A melodrama dismissed by most reviewers as overbearingly anti-Soviet, it quickly went out of print. Since her husband rarely worked, Rand had little but her own passion to support her during her next major, project, the novel that was to become The Fountainhead. While writing The Fountainhead, Rand wrote a futuristic novella entitled Anthem about the struggle of two lovers in a collective society to reclaim the concept of a self. At the time, only a British publisher would touch it. A stage version of We the Living called The Unconquered also failed. Eventually Rand found studio work again, reading screenplays for Paramount. This job provided the contact with an editor at Bobbs-Merrill who, on the strength of the first several chapters, promised to publish The Fountainhead.\n\nAfter a slow start and generally unsympathetic reviews upon its publication in May 1943, the book became a best-seller, and by the end of 1949, it had sold half a million copies. The protagonist, an architect named Howard Roark, embodied Rand's ideal man, an individualist who would assert his own convictions in the face of complete social opposition. In the novel's climactic scene, Roark blows up a public housing project (before occupation) rather than see his vision and plans grossly distorted. Yet Roark is not the thorough outcast he might seem. At his subsequent trial, he speaks so eloquently about his beliefs that the jury refuses to convict him. Rand wrote the screenplay for the movie version, starring Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal, which was released in 1949. The popular success of The Fountainhead established Rand's career as a novelist and put her on secure financial ground for the first time in her life.\n\nHer increasing fame brought her hundreds of fan letters and enlarged her social circle. By the early 1950s, she had cultivated a devoted coterie consisting mostly of college students and recent graduates eager to emulate her fictional heroes. Two of them, Nathan Blumenthal and his eventual wife, Barbara Weidman, apparently became so important to Rand that, in 1951, she and her husband followed them to New York City, where Rand and her husband spent the rest of their lives. In New York, Rand continued to work on what would be her last novel, Atlas Shrugged. In regular Saturday night salons, she would share portions of her work-in-progress with her group.\n\nRand and her husband served as witnesses at Blumenthal and Weidman's wedding in 1953, testifying to their close relationship. In her 1986 biography of Rand, Weidman claims the dubious distinction of naming the sexual attraction between her own husband and Rand in late 1954. Once that element was acknowledged, both Rand and Blumenthal (now named Nathaniel Branden) evidently felt justified by Rand's own tenets in embarking on an intense secret affair. According to Rand, sexual desire should go hand-in-hand with intellectual respect and shared ideals. Given their mutual interests and commitments, it was inevitable for a physical passion to develop between them-and unthinkable for it not to be fulfilled, despite their marriages and the twenty-five-year age difference. When Atlas Shrugged appeared through Random House, after a search for a publishing house that would not cut her work-it carried a joint dedication to her husband and to Branden.\n\nLike The Fountainhead, Atlas Shrugged eventually became a best-seller. Like the earlier novel, it attracted negative reviews. Most critics found the premise of the novel-that the most gifted, creative, and successful members of a society are exploited by the untalented and unappreciative masses\u2014only slightly less implausible than the major action of the novel, a strike of geniuses to force an end to their abuse.\n\nDevastated by the poor critical response, exhausted from twelve years of effort, and discouraged by the thought that she might have written all she had to say, Rand withdrew. It was Branden who succeeded in restoring her confidence and supporting her second crest of fame by inaugurating regular lectures on Rand's philosophy. Under the auspices of the Nathaniel Branden Institute, he and several other faithful students offered talks on \"The Basic Principles of Objectivism,\" covering subjects such as \"The Nature of Emotions,'' \"Social Metaphysics,\" \"The Ethics Of Altruism,\" and \"What is Reason\" The lectures soon drew hundreds of people in New York and expanded to several sites around the country. Sales of Atlas Shrugged continued to build\u2014its opening sentence, \"Who is John Galt,\" became a popular password for those in the know\u2014and Rand flourished in the attention. Although she herself delivered few lectures at Nathaniel Branden Institute, she did tour the country to speak on numerous college campuses. With Branden, she began a monthly called The Objectivist Newsletter, later expanded and renamed simply The Objectivist Both versions contained essays by Rand, Branden, and other associates (including perhaps her most celebrated admirer, the economist Alan Greenspan, now chairman of the Federal Reserve Board) that analyzed current political events and applied the principles of Objectivism to everyday life. The last books Rand published were collections of essays taken from the Objectivist periodicals.\n\nThe cohesion of the Objectivist movement shattered irrevocably, however, in 1968 when Branden finally admitted to Rand that lie would not resume their long-suspended affair. In response, Rand denounced Branden. accusing him of betraying essential Objectivist principles, and forced him to sever all connections with Objectivist activities, Including the institute bearing his name. Most devotees accepted her judgment and condemned Branden, even without particulars, but the upheaval occurred at a particularly inopportune moment. Rand had begun to lose her primary audience, usually young, idealistic adults, to other causes, and her customary argumentativeness in public appearances became less refreshing and more defensive and alienating. Criticism of Rand's sexual politics began to figure as prominently as attacks on her doctrine of \"rational selfishness.\" The first sexual encounter in The Fountainhead between Howard Roark and Dominique Francon became emblematic of a peculiarly American romanticization of rape, at least according to feminists like Susan Brownmiller. Circulation losses pushed her to reduce The Objectivist to a smaller form again, called The Ayn Rand Letter, which appeared more and more irregularly until she ended publication in 1975.\n\nOther personal losses took a toll as well: Her husband began to show signs of dementia years before his death in 1979, and the joyous news that her youngest and favorite sister Nora still lived led only to a brief and painfully disappointing reunion in 1973. She made a strong recovery from surgery for lung cancer in 1974, but she no longer had the stamina or the focus to devote herself to any large writing project.\n\nApart from intermittent appearances in television interviews, Ayn Rand's last regular speaking engagement was her annual lecture at Boston's Ford Hall Forum. Nevertheless, she had completed about one-fourth of a screenplay for a television miniseries of Atlas Shrugged and was in the midst of preparing her next Ford Hall lecture at the time of her death, on March 6, 1982. Several hundred mourners waited in the cold to enter the Manhattan funeral home where her body was laid out, alongside a six-foot floral dollar sign, the following day. The graveside service in Valhalla, New York, consisted only of a reading of Kipling's poem \"If' before Rand was buried beside her husband.\n\nAn assessment of Rand's reputation a decade and a half after her death must account for several contradictory factors. Few professional philosophers take her work at all seriously, yet many groups of readers and fans still debate and write about her theories. Her work continues to appeal to those who search for non-religious answers about human progress and agency. Certainly her declaration that selfishness is a virtue and altruism a vice is contrary to traditional Jewish values\u2014yet her exaltation of personal ambition is not so different from that of many Russian Jewish immigrants of her generation who savored the relative freedom of America. Despite their dismissal by the critical establishment, her books continue to sell. Together, her novels have sold approximately twenty-five million copies, a figure that still grows by about 250,000 every year. Rand might not have succeeded in achieving the immediate influence of a crusading novelist like Harriet Beecher Stowe, as she had hoped, but her popularity today testifies to an enduring appeal.\n\nSources: Paula Hyman and Deborah Dash Moore eds.
