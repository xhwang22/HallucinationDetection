He began dance training in 1951 and subsequently studied modern dance at Juilliard with Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, and Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n and ballet with Antony Tudor and Margaret Craske. He began his professional career in 1953 with Martha Graham\u2019s company, creating such important roles as Aegisthus in Clytemnestra (1958), Hercules in Alcestis (1960), and Theseus in Phaedra (1962). He also performed in works by other modern choreographers, including those of Charles Weidman and Merce Cunningham. He danced a solo created for him by George Balanchine in Episodes (1959), a work choreographed by Balanchine and Graham to music by Anton Webern.\n\nAs a choreographer, Taylor utilized a wide variety of movement styles, some of which he described as \u201cflat\u201d (two-dimensional in appearance), \u201cdance scribbling\u201d (emphasis on action rather than on shape or line), and \u201clyric\u201d (\u201clong arms\u201d). His avant-garde works ranged from Duet (1957), in which he and his partner remained motionless for four minutes, to Orbs (1966), an hour-long composition to Beethoven\u2019s last string quartets. Other well-known dances included Three Epitaphs (1956), Aureole (1962), Scudorama (1963), The Book of Beasts (1971), Esplanade and Runes (1975), Cloven Kingdom (1976), Aphrodisiamania (1977), Airs (1978), Nightshade (1979), and Le Sacre du Printemps (1980). His Aureole entered the repertoires of such major ballet troupes as the Paris Op\u00e9ra Ballet and the Royal Danish Ballet.\n\nTaylor\u2019s company, established in 1954 and usually numbering 13 dancers, first performed in Europe in 1960, toured South America in 1965 under the International Cultural Exchange Program of the U.S. State Department, and in 1978 toured the U.S.S.R. and appeared on the U.S. public-television network. Taylor also choreographed for the Spoleto (Italy) Festival of Two Worlds and won several prestigious awards. He withdrew from performing in the 1970s."}, {"url": "https://www.spokeo.com/Paul-Taylor/Ohio", "page_content": "Showing 5 records from over 100 Criminal Records & Traffic Violations that matched the name Paul Taylor:\n\nDisclaimer: By using this website, you accept the Spokeo Terms of Use.

This article is available exclusively for our subscribers, who help fund our work at the Chicago Tribune.\n\nMartha Graham, Merce Cunningham, Jose Limon, Erick Hawkins and Paul Taylor. This is a short list of pioneers who shaped and transformed 20th century modern dance in America. Taylor started his company in 1954 and remains one of the world\u2019s most influential living choreographers.\n\nSo it\u2019s a big deal in the dance world that the Paul Taylor Dance Foundation (an umbrella organization serving the Paul Taylor Dance Company, Taylor 2 and Paul Taylor American Modern Dance) has named dancer Michael Novak as artistic director designate. Effective July 1, Novak will officially become heir apparent in this newly created position aimed at preparing him to eventually lead the company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNovak grew up in Rolling Meadows and is a 2001 graduate of William Fremd High School. He started dancing at age 10 at the Bonnie Lindholm School of Dance in Palatine and was an active participant in the drama program at Fremd.\n\n\u201cI worked backstage and onstage for all the theater productions while I was at Fremd, and I ended up being president of the drama club my senior year of high school,\u201d said Novak in a phone interview with the Tribune. \u201cWhen I had a free weekend, I would often take the train to downtown Chicago to take classes at Hubbard Street.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a few years working as a freelance dancer, Novak joined the Paul Taylor Dance Company and will be entering his ninth season this fall. At age 87, Taylor plans to continue making dances, and the timeline transitioning Novak into the artistic director role is not fixed.\n\n\u201cI will be taking all of my cues from Paul,\u201d Novak said. \u201cHe has supported me throughout my entire career. Every opportunity he\u2019s given me, he\u2019s given before I thought I could handle it. That\u2019s built a trust for him in me,\u201d he said.\n\nNovak will continue to perform with the company while pursuing two goals as artistic director designate. First, he said he plans to spend as much time as he can with Taylor, learning his \u201ctips of the trade,\u201d and understanding how and why his company has been so successful.\n\n\u201cThe other thing that\u2019s important to me is knowing the history,\u201d he said, \u201cnot just of the company but of modern dance.\u201d Novak studied dance history as a student at New York\u2019s Columbia University and said he wants to take time to revisit his study of dance while developing as a curator for Paul Taylor American Modern Dance, which preserves historical masterworks from influential modern dance choreographers and commissions new works from the next generation.\n\n\u201cI want to revisit where modern dance came from and why,\u201d Novak said, \u201cto understand what those artists were working through and what was happening culturally. What prompted them to create the kind of work that they did? I\u2019ll be using that to help inform my decisions moving forward.

The book, based on her dissertation research, traces the history of suburbanization and urban sprawl from the 1860s to the 1920s. The transition began when factories moved out of the city in 1865 and workers followed the factories to the suburban fringe. Early forms of zoning, known as \u201cfire limits,\u201d pushed poorer people out of their neighborhoods, because they couldn\u2019t afford the bricks mandated to rebuild their burned-out wooden homes. Ideas about domestic respectability, strategies for using suburban homes as small businesses, and emerging ideas about race-related property values all further contributed to the early \u201csuburbanization\u201d of Chicago.\n\nChicago Magazine recently published \u201cHow Chicago Invented the Suburbs,\u201d an interview with Lewinnek about her research. The Urban History Association blogged about her book in \u201cHot Off the Presses: The Working Man\u2019s Reward,\u201d and Oxford University Press\u2019s blog featured her analysis of the Race Riots of 1919 and their relation to emerging ideas of property values.\n\nLewinnek is an associate professor of American Studies at California State University, Fullerton.

No downtown area in the western world outside Manhattan is more visually impressive than Chicago. Both the historic Loop and the newer development north of the Chicago River, especially along North Michigan Avenue have some of the most iconic structures outside of emerging Asia. Yet these vertical monuments mask a less celebrated reality: that of dispersing, low density urban area.\n\nChicago Combined Statistical Area: Let\u2019s take a close look at the 2010 census data. Overall, the combined statistical area, which includes the metropolitan area (Note 1) and two exurban counties added nearly 365,000 people, for a growth rate of 3.9 percent. This is well below the national growth rate of approximately 10 percent (Map, Figure 1). Chicago followed the general trend of with growth being greatest in the outer suburbs while declines took place both in the inner suburbs and the historical core municipality (Figure 2).\n\nMassive Core City Loss: The historical core city of Chicago lost but 200,000 people, and fell to a population of 2.7 million, the lowest count since the 1910 census. The population is down 925,000 from 1950 and at the current rate would drop at least 1 million from the 1950 peak by the 2020 census. Chicago is at risk of joining London and Detroit as the only two historical core municipalities in modern times that have lost more than 1 million people.\n\nInner Suburbs: As in New York and Seattle, Chicago\u2019s inner suburbs grew slowly. The inner suburbs include the part of Cook County that is outside the city of Chicago as well as Lake County, Indiana (home of Gary), which shares the city of Chicago's eastern border. The inner suburbs added fewer than 30,000 residents and grew only one percent.\n\nThis suggests some limitations to the newly developing mantra that has inner suburbs will be the locus of future growth although there are scattered inner suburbs in other cities (such as Hoboken, New Jersey) that did see growth. Perhaps the old mantra, about people returning to the city from which they had never come was finally quashed by the realities of the 2010 census.\n\nOuter Suburbs: The outer suburbs, which include the remaining counties of the metropolitan area, grew at a rate of 16.5 percent, actually grew faster than the national average of approximately 10 percent. The outer suburbs added more than 500,000 people. The largest growth, 175,000 was in Will County, to the south, one of the five \u201ccollar counties\u201d that used to define the boundaries of the metropolitan area. McHenry County, the most distant of the collar counties added 100,000. The fastest growth was in far suburban and also southern Kendall County, which more than doubled in population.\n\nChicago Metropolitan Area: Overall, the Chicago metropolitan area added approximately 360,000 people and grew 4.0 percent from 2000. This is well below the national average population growth rate, however was above that of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, once among the nation\u2019s of leading growth areas until the last decade.\n\nHistorical Trends: The city of Chicago, like other historical core cities, had previously been dominant in its metropolitan area. The earliest Census Bureau metropolitan area (\u201cmetropolitan district\u201d) estimates from 1900 indicated that more than 90 percent of the region\u2019s population was contained in the city of Chicago. By 1950, the city of Chicago had fallen to 66 percent of the metropolitan area as defined in that year. The city of Chicago now has only 28 percent of the combined statistical area population of 9.7 million (Figure 3, Table and Note 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHICAGO METROPOLITAN AREA POPULATION TREND BY COUNTY: 2000 TO 2010 1900 1950 2000 2010 Change: 2000-2010 % Change: 2000-2010 HISTORIC CORE MUNICIPALITY Chicago 1,698,575 3,620,962 2,895,671 2,695,598 -200,073 -6.9% INNER SUBURBAN 178,052 1,255,982 2,965,634 2,995,082 29,448 1.0% Cook County, IL 140,160 887,830 2,481,070 2,499,077 18,007 0.7% Lake County, IN 37,892 368,152 484,564 496,005 11,441 2.4% OUTER SUBURBAN 378,896 884,980 3,237,011 3,770,425 533,414 16.5% DeKalb County, IL 31,756 40,781 88,969 105,160 16,191 18.2% DuPage County, IL 28,196 154,999 904,161 916,924 12,763 1.4% Grundy County, IL 24,136 19,217 37,535 50,063 12,528 33.4% Jasper County, IN 14,292 17,031 30,043 33,478 3,435 11.4% Kane County, IL 78,792 150,388 404,119 515,269 111,150 27.5% Kendall County, IL 11,467 12,155 54,544 114,736 60,192 110.4% Kenosha County, WI 21,707 75,238 149,577 166,426 16,849 11.3% Lake County, IL 34,504 179,097 644,356 703,462 59,106 9.2% McHenry County, IL 29,659 50,656 260,077 308,760 48,683 18.7% Newton County, IN 10,448 11,006 14,566 14,244 -322 -2.2% Porter County, IN 19,175 40,076 146,798 164,343 17,545 12.0% Will County, IL 74,764 134,336 502,266 677,560 175,294 34.9% CHICAGO METROPOLITAN AREA 2,255,523 5,761,924 9,098,316 9,461,105 362,789 4.0% EXURBAN METROPOLITAN COUNTIES 75,540 150,332 213,939 224,916 10,977 5.1% Kankakee Coiunty, IL 37,154 73,524 103,833 113,449 9,616 9.3% La Porte County, IN 38,386 76,808 110,106 111,467 1,361 1.2% CHICAGO COMBINED STATISTICAL AREA 2,331,063 5,912,256 9,312,255 9,686,021 364,150 3.9% Data from the US Census Bureau\n\nSince 1950 (Note 3), all of the growth in the Chicago area has been in the suburbs. By 2000, both inner suburbs and the outer suburbs each had more people than the city of Chicago. Today the outer suburbs, with forty percent of the region\u2019s population, represent the largest demographic force in Chicago (Figure 4).\n\nWe do not usually associate Chicago with the dreaded term \u201csprawl\u201d but Chicago now stands as the third largest urban agglomeration in the world in land area, trailing only New York and Tokyo. The Chicago urban area covers more land than Los Angeles, which has a far higher urban density.\n\nDispersing Employment: Chicago's dispersion extends to employment. Despite having the second strongest central business district in the nation (after Manhattan), jobs are rapidly decentralizing. Last year the Downtown Loop Alliance reported that private sector employment in the Loop fell 20 percent during the last decade. Overall, the downtown area of Chicago now represents approximately 10 percent of regional employment, barely half the percentage of Manhattan or Washington, DC.\n\nAmerican community survey data from 2009 indicates the total employment in the North West corridor along Interstate 90 has at least as much employment as downtown Chicago. This corridor, anchored by the edge city (Note 4) of Schaumburg, is typical of emerging suburban centers around the nation. Only two percent of workers in this corridor use transit for commuting.\n\nAnother corridor, along Interstate 88 (anchored by Lisle and Aurora) has at least two thirds the employment of downtown, with only one percent commuting by transit. The North Shore corridor encompassing parts of northern Cook County and Lake County is of similar size to the Interstate 88 corridor and has a larger transit work trip market share of five percent.\n\nDowntown, on the other hand, has the third largest transit work trip market share in the nation, following Manhattan and Brooklyn. In 2000, 55 percent of people working downtown (the larger downtown including the Loop, north of the River and adjacent areas to the west and south) commuted by transit. This illustrates the strength of transit for providing access to the largest, most dense downtown areas in contrast to dispersed suburban areas.\n\nPerhaps more telling, the number of jobs and resident workers (the \u201cjobs-housing\u201d balance) in the city of Chicago are converging toward equality. According to American community survey data, there are 1.1 jobs in the city of Chicago for each working resident. This is substantially less, for example, than Washington (2.6), Atlanta (2.0), Boston (1.7), San Francisco (1.4) and Baltimore (1.4).\n\nOn the other hand, two of the three large suburban corridors have higher ratios of jobs to workers than the city of Chicago. The Interstate 88 corridor has 1.3 jobs per worker, while the North Shore has approximately 1.5 jobs per worker. The Interstate 90 corridor has slightly more jobs than workers. These data indicate that Chicago is well on the way to a more evenly distributed employment pattern that has become more common around the nation.\n\nMiddle America\u2019s Leviathan: The Chicago area has been very resilient through the years. After nearly a century as the nation\u2019s \u201csecond city,\u201d Aaron Renn points out the area could fall from its much cherished \u201cglobal city\u201d status. Still, Chicago remains the dominant urban area between the coasts. Virtually all of its Midwestern competition has fallen away (such as Detroit, St. Louis and Cleveland). However, in the longer run Chicago could be displaced by Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston. Nonetheless, the urban area\u2019s visually arresting business district will retain its iconic status even if, overall, the region looks more and more like the rest of highly dispersed Middle America.\n\n------\n\nNote 1: This article uses metropolitan area and combined statistical areas as defined by the authoritative US Office of Management and the Budget.\n\nNote 2: The 1950 references provided because the closest to the Post-War democratization of homeownership and car ownership and expansion of car oriented suburbanization.

Dearborn settlement. Of such small beginnings was suburbanization born.\n\nOf course, those pioneering families who carved out homesteads where shopping malls and fast-food franchises now stand could hardly have known that they were the harbingers of a tract-house revolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time, the vast open spaces of Chicago`s hinterland were, quite literally, the American frontier and the first occupants had to worry about the red men`s war drums rather than future real estate values.\n\nWhat has become of their Little Houses on the Prairie?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo answer that question, we asked a group of well-placed local observers to take a bird`s-eye view, past and present, six of Chicago`s oldest suburbs: St. Charles (1839), Blue Island (1843), Naperville (1857), Evanston (1857), Wheaton (1859) and Lake Forest (1861).\n\nIncidently, before all you other hometown boosters and barroom historians flood us with anecdotes of your Indian-fighting progenitors--or complaints that we have slighted your suburb`s hallowed heritage--be advised that we drew our list from the Secretary of State`s registry of municipal-charter dates.\n\nTO BEGIN AT THE beginning, there is not a place in suburbia that doesn`t look a lot different today than it did when John and William Naper gave up being Great Lakes ship captains in favor of lending their name to a tiny hamlet west of Chicago.\n\nOr, when Warren and Jesse Wheaton bestowed the same linguistic favor on a stretch of the landscape just to the north of Naperville, then turned the trick of convincing the builders of the Chicago and Galena Railroad to bring its tracks right through their budding village.\n\nAs a matter of fact, there are plenty of folks in those western suburbs who have seen a lot of change just in their own lifetime. Marshall Erb was born on the same Naperville farm that his great-grandfather Joshua came west from Pennsylvania to homestead in 1847.\n\nNow he lives nearby, while his son works the remaining 200 acres of the family`s land, the rest of it having been sold off during previous\n\ngenerations, as the town passed from being a farm community to the fastest-growing suburb in the Chicago area.\n\n''WHEN I GO TO town now I get lost,'' says Marshall Erb`s wife Alice, who was herself born on a area farm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n''Over the last 15 years, Naperville has been growing so fast that I don`t know whether our young grandson, Marshall Morgan, will be able to keep on farming when the land comes into his hands. Taxes are so high it`s hard even now to resist developers` offers. But I guess that`s what you call\n\n`progress.` ''\n\nYet there are a few places which have not changed all that much since their formative years.\n\n''Lake Forest was laid out in 1857 to be just what it is today,'' notes Michael Ebner, a Lake Forest College professor and chronicler of the North Shore`s development.\n\nMarket Square looks no different now than when Howard Van Doren Shaw designed it as the nation`s first shopping center. Unlike its neon and plastic successors, it still looks like it was transplanted from an English market town.\n\nA few of the surrounding estates have been subdivided in recent decades, but the town`s gracefully curving roads still wind past enough remaining mansions to remind visitors that Lake Forest has always been home to Chicago`s gentry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIN FACT, THE occupants of those mansions have an interesting attitude about change.\n\n''Citizens up here have had an almost territorial sense about the public commons,'' notes Warren Wood, a senior planner with the Lake County Department of Planning and Zoning.\n\n''So when Walgreens recently renovated their Lake Forest store, they made sure to do it in a historically appropriate way. Now, there is considerable opposition to the proposed commercial development of the Conway Farms, a property which visually forms the town`s western boundary.''\n\nYet that same gentry also has been willing to share the lessons of its woody-and-green-vistas lifestyle. Wood notes that the Armours hosted a meeting at their estate that was critical in shaping the National Park System as a way of preserving the country`s wilderness. Lake Forest was, as well, the birthplace of the Women`s Garden Club movement.\n\n''When I was growing up in California, my mother was president of the Exeter Club,'' recalls Wood. ''From the Midwest to out there, the idea had spread that the women of a community ought to take a leadership role in preserving its visual environment.''\n\nAT THE OTHER END of the North Shore, mansion dwellers have had an even greater public role thrust upon them. Yet their predecessors where hardly looking for that when they settled the swamp land that became Evanston.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike Lake Forest, Evanston began as a college town. Its Methodist founders, like their Presbyterian counterparts to the north, were looking for a place where God-fearing young people could be educated free from the city`s rum-and-rebellion contagion.\n\nBy the 1890s, notes Ebner, that was no longer an easy geographical trick for Northwestern University to pull off. By that point, Chicago`s growth had filled in the gap which once separated its border from Evanston`s, and the town had to fight off repeated annexation attempts by the ''Colossus Of The South.''\n\nDaniel Burnham, author of the noted plan for metropolitan development, but an Evanston resident before all else, signed a newspaper ad opposing annexation to what he called, ''big, fast growing, unkempt Chicago.''\n\nBut while Evanston retained its independence, its geographical position and population growth meant that it could no longer be exempt from big-city problems.\n\nIN TURN, THAT MADE its town fathers willy-nilly leaders in a continuing series of urban reform movements so that today its roster of municipal services reads like a blueprint for the liberal agenda--or, alternately, a conservative`s nightmare.\n\nIndeed, in the 1960s and `70s, the arival of considerable numbers of Chicago transplants turned the town`s political demographics from Republican to Democrat and diluted its historic WASP population base with a sizable Jewish minority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet Sandy Gross, the city clerk and her adopted hometown`s resident historian, cautions against attributing too much of Evanston`s social conscience to those population shifts. Long before the town went for McGovern, she notes, it was a leader in the antislavery movement, and as the home of the WTCU, it always spread the gospel of reform--albeit a somewhat idiosyncratic one.\n\nIts pioneering, and voluntary, school desegregation effort, moreover, was largely a project of its older, Brooks Brothers elite, rather than their blue- jeans successors.\n\nLIKE EVANSTON, Blue Island`s geographical position on what eventually became Chicago`s southwestern border meant that it too had to fight to preserve its corporate identity.\n\nVisually, there never has been much chance that the two towns would be confused. Indeed, in that respect Blue Island is unique in Chicago`s patriarchal suburbs. Of them, Evanston and Lake Forest grew up around a college campus, and Wheaton, Naperville and St. Charles began as farming communities.\n\nOnly Blue Island always has had a commercial and industrial heritage, notes Janet Muchnik, its acting director of planning and community\n\ndevelopment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n''Our town began as a coaching-stop one day`s ride along the trail that connected Ft. Dearborn with Ft. Vincennes,'' Muchnik says. Its fortunes were linked to two further generations of the metropolitan area`s transportation routes.\n\nIn the Civil War era, Joshua Palmer Young was both a stockholder of the Rock Island Railroad and a Blue Island land developer, so he made sure the town got a branch line.\n\nTHEN IN THE EARLY years of this century, the digging of the Cal-Sag Canal further endowed the town with a heavy industry base and an immigrant workforce to man it.\n\nOf course, with the economic downturn of recent years, Blue Island`s fortunes have suffered along with all the other mill towns of the Rust Belt. Still, Muchnik thinks that her town has a unique advantage in trying to rebuild.\n\nTo keep their city services from suffering property-tax anemia, lots of suburban communities currently are trying to attract new industry. In most cases, though, they are bedroom suburbs whose tract homes traditionally have been occupied with more white- than blue-collar types.\n\n''In Blue Island, on the other hand, we have a 150-year history of the work ethic,'' says Muchnik. ''There aren`t a lot of places left which can offer that inducement.''\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the memoirs which she set down to preserve her family`s pionering days, Lydia Shelby noted that when they first came to its banks, the Fox River marked the very limit of civilization.\n\n''WE WERE THE FIRST white settlers that ever lived in St. Charles,'' she wrote of their 1834 arrival. ''It took a week to go to Chicago and return. Chicago was then a small place.''\n\nShould her spirit still hover over our part of the world, Shelby will note that some things change, others remain pretty much the same.\n\nChicago`s industrial base has by now migrated into the string of western suburbs that connect the site of Shelby`s long-ago homested with the object of those week-long round trips.\n\nYet Roosevelt University urbanologist Pierre de Vise observes that St. Charles is still just a little bit beyond the commuting radius, so the small- town character it took on in the 1920s and `30s is still strong. ''It has always been a satellite of Chicago,'' he says, ''and is increasingly coming into the suburban ring.''\n\nDe Vise also notes that the expressway system is presently quickening the pace of change in all parts of suburbia and thereby diminishing the cultural border that the city`s limits once marked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIN FACT, JUDY KING, of the St. Charles planning department, notes that the most contemporary of urban creatures has already made its appearance there. ''It`s not cheap to live in our town,'' King says, ''so a lot of our older homes are being bought by young professionals.''\n\nIt is a good bet that for some of the Fox River valley`s proto-Yuppies, Naperville`s high-tech corridor marks the other end of their daily commute.\n\nAccording to Terry Pieniazeck, the town`s principal planner, many of the farms of pioneering families, like the Erbs, have been reborn as the industrial and commercial projects that have fueled Naperville`s spectacular growth rate--a phenomenon which seperates its present course from that of nearby Wheaton.\n\nA century ago, the two towns feuded over which ought to be the site of the Du Page County courthouse, and even after the legislature voted for Naperville, it took a night raid by the Wheatonians to liberate the record-books from their stubborn rivals. Now they take differing approachs to growth. A decade back, notes Wheaton city manager Donald Rose, a high-rise development on the town`s periphery touched off a local storm of controversy. THE THING WAS BUILT, but in the wake of that dispute, most residents made up their minds that they didn`t want too many similar projects altering their community traditional, residential character.\n\n''We`ve experience a steadily increasing population,'' Rose notes, ''but over the years, there haven`t been too many dramatic changes, and I would have to guess that`s the way most folks want it.''\n\nNaperville`s movers-and-shakers take a different view of things. Maybe you can`t have your cake and eat it too, but who says the same rule of thumb also holds for the landscape?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the center of town, they have preserved the visable evidence of its farm-town heritage, while actively courting the research labs that have brought their industrial-age architecture to the highways along its borders.\n\n''I guess you`d have to say we like being a paradox,'' notes Pieniazeck, whose office has the responsibility of fine-tuning that balance between the town`s past and future. ''We are an old-line suburban town, with lots of historic charm and a booming high-tech skyline.''"}, {"url": "https://www.chicagomag.com/city-life/how-chicagos-suburbs-shape-pop-culture/", "page_content": "When I was a teenager, attending what I\u2019ll call Inner City Rust Belt High School, an integrated institution across the street from an auto plant in Michigan, I got all my impressions of suburbia from the movies.

In Risky Business, Tom Cruise spared himself from going to Illinois by setting the Princeton recruiter up with a hooker.\n\n\u201cPrinceton can use a guy like Joel,\u201d Tom\u2019s wealthy father tells him at the end of the movie, his voice practically cracking with pride.\n\nRightly or wrongly, I concluded that suburbia was segregated and snobbish, an attitude I\u2019ve never been able to shake. I didn\u2019t get that attitude from movies about just any suburbs, I got it from movies about Chicago\u2019s Northern suburbs, which, over the last 40 years, have come to be seen as representative of all American suburbia. (My first job in Chicago was covering the Lake County suburbs for the Tribune. That didn\u2019t change my mind.)\n\nDuring the first wave of suburbanization, in the aftermath of World War II, the suburbs of Northeastern cities got all the attention, in movies such as Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House, and in the fiction of John Updike, John Cheever and Richard Yates. When Hollywood rediscovered Chicago in the 1980s, though, it also discovered Chicago\u2019s suburbs, through the work of writers and directors who grew up there. Paul Brickman, who directed Risky Business, was from Highland Park; Hughes was from Northbrook.\n\nIn the 1980s, suburbia was in its prime. Back then, nobody with money wanted to live in urban America. Rich people wouldn\u2019t start moving back to cities for another decade. The suburbs are often mocked as a cultural wasteland, but towards the end of the 20th century, that\u2019s where a lot of Chicago\u2019s cultural energy was coming from. Even The Blues Brothers, which is revered as a document of post-industrial, pre-gentrification Chicago, was co-created by John Belushi of Wheaton. Steppenwolf Theatre Company was co-founded by Jeff Perry of Highland Park and Gary Sinise of Blue Island. According to his National Lampoon colleague P.J. O\u2019Rourke, Hughes in particular was eager to rescue his native grounds from the notion that \u201cAmerica\u2019s suburbs were a living hell almost beyond the power of John Cheever\u2019s words to describe.\u201d\n\nChicago\u2019s 1990s alternative music scene may have been born in Wicker Park, but its leading lights were suburbanites: Liz Phair of Winnetka, Billy Corgan of Elk Grove Village, Local H of Zion. Urge Overkill formed at Northwestern University. High Fidelity, the movie which celebrated that scene, starred Evanston\u2019s own John Cusack as Rob Gordon, a guy from the suburbs who opens a record shop on Milwaukee Avenue.\n\nChicago\u2019s suburbs continue to define suburbia in popular culture. The 2004 movie Mean Girls, the quintessential depiction of high school cliques, was set at fictional North Shore High School (i.e., New Trier). The characters even shopped at Old Orchard, although it was inaccurately depicted as an indoor mall. Greater Chicagoland also makes an appearance, and provides a contrast: Wayne\u2019s World, set in Aurora, and Roseanne, set in the fictional, Elgin-inspired collar-county town of Lanford, are on the outside, physically, culturally and economically.\n\nNathan Hill\u2019s The Nix, one of the finest fiction debuts of recent years, is about a young writer who grows up in Streamwood, then goes on to teach literature \u201cat a small university northwest of Chicago, in a suburb where all the giant freeways split apart and end at giant department stores and corporate office parks and three-lane roads clogged with vehicles driven by the parents who send their children to Samuel\u2019s school.\u201d (That sounds a lot like Harper College in Palatine.) The Nix allowed me to vicariously experience the 1980s suburban adolescence I never had, depicted much more realistically than in a John Hughes movie.\n\nThis fall, Jonathan Franzen, who was born in Western Springs, is coming out with Crossroads, the first volume in his \u201cA Key to All Mythologies\u201d trilogy. Publishers Weekly calls it \u201ca sweeping and masterly examination of the shifting culture of early 1970s America.\u201d Where better to examine that culture than \u201cthe small Illinois town of New Prospect\u201d\u2014a suburb of Chicago.\n\nIn the early 20th Century, novelists who wanted to capture America in all its complexity set their stories in Chicago: Frank Norris\u2019s The Pit, Upton Sinclair\u2019s The Jungle, Willa Cather\u2019s The Song of the Lark. In the early 21st Century, they\u2019re turning to Chicago\u2019s suburbs.\n\nCorrection: The hometown of John Hughes was previously misidentified. Hughes is from Northbrook, not Deerfield."}, {"url": "https://chi.streetsblog.org/2021/06/22/the-suburbs-are-not-chicago-but-more-chicagoland-pride-and-unity-is-needed/", "page_content": "WXRT DJ Lin Brehmer does a regular segment called Lin's Bin where he answers letters from readers on the air in a poetic way, with an appropriate musical soundtrack. These spots are always entertaining, but I found a recent episode to be especially thought-provoking. The DJ was asked, \"Where exactly is Chicagoland \u2013 what are its boundaries?\" \u2013 listen to his full response here.\n\nBrehmer didn't spend much time trying to address that particular question, i.e. what is the extent of the Chicago region or metropolitan area. However, technically correct answers do exist, sort of.\n\nThe Chicago Metropolitan Area can refer to the Census-defined \"Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI Metropolitan Statistical Area,\" which goes as far north as Kenosha, Wisconsin, and as far east as La Porte, Indiana. As of the 2015 Census estimate, the population of that district was 9,532,569, making it the third-largest MSA in the country.\n\nThe Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI Metropolitan Statistical Area outlined in bold. Image: ProximityOne\n\nBut there are a few other official government definitions of the region that are a little different. And I'd also be willing to go with an informal definition that includes anywhere within the general zone that can be reached from downtown Chicago by commuter rail. But I'd draw the line at South Bend, Indiana, even though you can get there on the South Shore Line, because it's about 90 miles from the Loop. Calling South Bend part of Chicagoland would be getting a little ridiculous.\n\nHere's everywhere that can be reached by Chicago commuter rail, excluding South Bend. Is this Chicagoland? Image: Google Maps\n\nBrehmer tried to respond to the listener's question by inaccurately conflating \"Chicago\" with the Chicago region: \"As a media entity, Chicago is really an expanse wrapped around an inland sea, from Wisconsin to Indiana and south to the prairie.\"\n\nHe seemed to take a dim view of the correct term for the metro area, Chicagoland. \"We hear it on TV by sponsors who want to be inclusive: 'Our car dealership serves all of Chicagoland.'\" However, I think it's a handy word.\n\nMuch of Brehmer's monologue was spent arguing it's snobbish to insist the suburbs are not actually part of Chicago. \"But there will always be purists who want Chicago to be identified separately from the various suburbs and nearby towns,\" he says.\n\nBrehmer described a hypothetical situation of a Chicagoan sitting in a cafe in La Roque-Gageac, a small village in southwestern France, and seeing a couple, including a guy in a Bears t-shirt sitting nearby.\n\nYou say, \"Are you from Chicago?\" And he says cheerfully, \"We sure are.\" And you think, small world. And you say brightly, \"We are too, what part do you live in?\" And they say, \"Schaumburg.\" Internally you may be screaming, \"Schaumburg? That's not Chicago!\" But this is why we need to internalize. You're in France. You're drinking good wine. No time for geography on a beautiful day overlooking the Dordogne River. So they're not from Chicago; they're from Chicagoland. Better just move on and raise a glass to Justin Fields.\n\nFair enough, if you were to make a point of reminding the Bears fan he's not actually from Chicago, you would be the jerk in that situation.\n\nStill, it doesn't make sense for suburbanites to go around implying they're from Chicago proper, or suggesting that there's no real difference between the suburbs and the city.\n\nNow, the urbanite's stereotype of the 'burbs as homogenous cultural wastelands is an unfair one. Viewed as a whole, Chicago's suburbs are ethnically, economically, and geographically diverse.\n\nBut the type of Chicagoland suburbanite you're likely to encounter in a French cafe probably lives in the 'burbs by choice. Maybe they were motivated to move out of Chicago by the better-funded public schools in middle-class and affluent municipalities, a product of our inequitable, property tax-based school funding formula. Or perhaps it was the appeal of living in a good-sized house with a big yard, in an area where driving seems more convenient because all the retail has tons of parking, factors that contribute to unsustainable sprawl.\n\nThe Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed House of Worship in Wilmette, and Indiana Dunes National Park.\n\nSo when a person takes advantage of these aspects of the suburbs, while simultaneously trying to associate themself with the density, vibrancy, and grit of Chicago, it's sort of a case of trying to have their cake and eat it too.\n\nBrehmer acknowledged this is a common phenomena. \"You'll always meet people who claim Chicago is their home when they're hiding out in Naperville. [However,] no one will ever say, I'm from Chicagoland.\"\n\nBut maybe they should.\n\nFirst of all, there are lots of alternatives to saying \"I'm from Chicago\" if you're really not. Just tell people you live \"close to Chicago,\" \"outside of Chicago,\" \"in the Chicago suburbs,\" \"in a town called [name of your town], near Chicago,\" or, yes, \"in Chicagoland.\"\n\nI grew up in the suburbs and, even then as a kid, my parents taught me to say that we were from the western suburbs of Chicago. It's not hard. \u2014 Grant (@MelissaGrant773) June 21, 2021\n\nI'd also like to see us foster a spirit of regional, not just civic, pride that would unite city dwellers and suburbanites. That's why I'm trying to popularize, probably futilely, the term \"Chicagolander\" to refer to anyone who lives in the metro area.\n\nAfter all, there are lots of awesome things in Chicagoland that aren't actually in Chicago. Here's just a few of them (more in this thread.)\n\nWhile drawing a line between the city and the suburbs is just being realistic, Brehmer argued it\u2019s elitist. \"Life gets shorter every year. My hope is we strive to be more inclusive. If the cool kids won't let you come to their lunch table because you're not from Chicago, sit at my table. I'm serving Johnnie's Beef, hot peppers. The most Chicago joint in all of Chicagoland.\"\n\nJohnnie's Beef in Elmwood Park. Photo: Johnny's Beef\n\nThat was a clever way to end the segment because Johnnie's, widely considered the best place in the region for an Italian beef sandwich, is just over the border from the city in suburban Elmwood Park. But still, Johnnie\u2019s is not a \u201cChicago joint,\" it\u2019s a Chicagoland joint.\n\nAgain there's no point trying to police suburbanites who act like they're from Chicago. But let's not pretend that the suburbs are the city. Rather, let's celebrate the entire region."}, {"url": "https://www.chicagoreporter.net/what-are-the-suburbs-of-chicago/", "page_content": "Chapter 6 Of Chicago Suburbs: Downtown Neighborhoods\n\nOutside Chicago, suburbs are also struggling with surge in violent crime\n\nThe main downtown area is just seven blocks away from North Chicago River.

Court battles ensued and homes in Bensenville were razed for the project.\n\nMayor Rahm Emanuel was accused of luring corporations such as Mondelez International in Deerfield and McDonald\u2019s in Oak Brook to the city, meaning lost jobs and property taxes.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, where Chicago goes, the suburbs go and vice versa, and I think we have to appreciate that,\u201d Vallas said on March 1.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known many of the suburban mayors over the years, not to mention the superintendents. I anticipate a great working relationship with them.\u201d\n\nAs commissioner, Johnson \u2013 an Elgin High School alum \u2013 represents Chicago and nearby suburbs such as Forest Park, Oak Park and Bellwood. That experience lends itself to being a collaborative mayor with Cook communities, he said Thursday.\n\nChicago mayoral candidate Brandon Johnson speaks about Cook County Board Chair Toni Preckwinkle's endorsement outside City Hall. (Marni Pyke)\n\n\u201cNow, stretching beyond Cook County, because of my upbringing, my ties to the region outside of Cook County, there are relationships that can be built\u201d with the collar counties to provide economic benefit to the metro area, he explained.\n\nBears stadium\n\nOne sore point for Chicago voters in the Feb. 28 election was the pending exodus of the Chicago Bears from Soldier Field to a new stadium in the vacated Arlington Park.\n\nThe organization closed on purchasing the property in February, but financing is a sticking point. Team owners would pay for the stadium but insist they need funding assistance for infrastructure to support thousands coming to games and a planned commercial complex.\n\nLegislation giving the Bears property tax breaks is pending in Springfield, but there\u2019s no consensus yet.\n\nAs mayor, \u201cI\u2019m going to sit down and have a conversation with the Bears, but obviously we have some real infrastructure priorities in the city we need to address,\u201d Vallas said. \u201cDoing billion-dollar stadium subsidies is not high on my list and certainly not something I consider to be a priority.\u201d\n\nJohnson wants the Bears to stay. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t remember the \u201885 Bears? One of the greatest teams of all time?\u201d\n\nIf elected, he plans to meet with the ownership and seek common ground although \u201cI also recognize that I have a fiduciary responsibility to protect the interests of the taxpayers.\u201d\n\nRoots\n\nJohnson may be running for Chicago mayor, but his roots are in the suburbs. He grew up in a family of 10 in Elgin and jokes how having one bathroom sharpened his negotiating skills.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of the working-class upbringing I experienced in Elgin,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very much proud of the diversity that I benefited from. Growing up in Elgin, it wasn\u2019t just that we had multiple cultures, but we had multiple cultures in one neighborhood.\n\n\u201cChicago is a global city, but it\u2019s quite stratified. I grew up around Black folks, white folks, Asians, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans. It was an incredible, dynamic upbringing that really prepared me for this moment.\u201d\n\nHe remembers \u201cperformances at the Hemmens [Cultural Center], trips to the Gail Borden Library,\u201d and playing Little League Baseball where his Pirates team made it to the Hamm\u2019s Tournament. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work out that well for us ... but it was an honor to be there.\u201d\n\nJohnson, who also has degrees from Aurora University, gave a shoutout to retired Elgin High School teacher Gordon Whiting, who \u201cmade social studies come alive for me.\u201d\n\nHe moved to Chicago while in his 20s and lives in the Austin community with his wife and three children.\n\nVallas, meanwhile, hails from Chicago\u2019s Roseland neighborhood on the South Side. His grandparents were Greek immigrants.\n\n\u201cGiven the fact that my family is 100% Greek, we had to open up a restaurant because the Greek gene mandates that we open up a restaurant,\u201d Vallas told the Chicago Sun-Times. \u201cWe joked that my dad wanted to spend more time with his family, so he opened the restaurant so we were working together seven days a week.\u201d\n\nWhen he graduated from Fenger Academy High School, Vallas attended Moraine Valley Community College in the South suburbs and Western Illinois University.\n\nVallas was Chicago\u2019s budget director before taking over at CPS, where he worked from 1995 to 2001. He has managed school systems in Philadelphia, New Orleans and Connecticut.\n\nVallas lives in the Bridgeport neighborhood with his wife. His son, Mark, died in 2018 as a result of opioid abuse and his other adult sons, Gus and Paul Jr., are public safety first responders.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really a family of public servants,\u201d Vallas told the Sun-Times, noting his circle includes veterans, teachers and firefighters.\n\nTax plans\n\nJohnson\u2019s original budget plan for the city calls for \u201ctax fairness and economic justice\u201d that he says would eliminate the deficit without raising property taxes. Items included a controversial Metra city surcharge expected to raise $40 million from suburbanites, a head tax on large companies that perform 50% or more of work in Chicago, and a hotel accommodations tax.\n\nThe Metra tax has been eliminated, Johnson said, because the plan \u201cis a living document.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a particular revenue idea that people don\u2019t want, that\u2019s why I\u2019m demonstrating now that \u2018look, we can eliminate that one, but you\u2019re going to have to help me find that amount of money so we can reduce the economic stresses that are forcing families out.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe blames Vallas for the city\u2019s financial straits and warns his opponent would raise property taxes.\n\nVallas has retorted that Johnson \u201cstill has to explain his so-called tax-the-rich plan that doesn\u2019t look like a tax-the-rich plan to me when you\u2019re talking about head taxes or taxes on small businesses ... or you\u2019re talking about things like raising the hotel-motel tax on an industry that\u2019s been pummeled by COVID-19. That\u2019s not a tax-the-rich plan,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a \u2018let\u2019s destroy Chicago\u2019s economy plan.\u2019 \u201d\n\nhttps://www.dailyherald.com/news/20230311/what-chicagos-two-mayoral-candidates-one-an-elgin-native-say-about-working-with-the-suburbs"}, {"url": "https://www.chicagomag.com/news/december-2020/why-chicago-stopped-growing/", "page_content": "If Ald. Matt O\u2019Shea is able to follow through with his plan to annex Mount Hope Cemetery, it would be the first time Chicago\u2019s borders have expanded since the mid-20th Century. That\u2019s when we absorbed O\u2019Hare Airport, as well as a forest preserve and a stretch of Foster Avenue to connect it to the rest of the city.\n\nMeanwhile, the cities of the Sun Belt have continued to expand into the 21st Century, so much so that Houston is now threatening to bump Chicago from Third City to Fourth City by population. Like most Northern industrial hubs, Chicago\u2019s growth ground to a halt decades ago. Why did we stop growing, and can we ever grow again?\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Chicago grew into a great metropolis by gobbling up suburbs we now know as city neighborhoods. In the 1880s, the city limits were bounded roughly by Fullerton, Pershing, and Pulaski.\n\nThen, Chicago landed the Columbian Exposition, which was envisioned as our coming-out party as a world-class city. At the time, Chicago only had 500,000 people, making it the fourth-largest city in the U.S. That wasn\u2019t enough for our ambitions. We wanted to challenge New York.\n\nIn order to become the Gotham of the Great Lakes, the city\u2019s leaders approached the residents of four bordering townships: Lake View to the north, Jefferson to the northwest, Hyde Park to the south, and Lake to the southwest. Join us, went the offer, and you\u2019ll get better police and fire protection, better water and sewers, better roads, and the prestige of a Chicago address.\n\nIn 1889, all four townships voted themselves into the city, doubling its population and making it the nation\u2019s second city, behind New York. (In Hyde Park Township, workers at the Pullman Palace Car Company were eager to dissolve the \u201ccompany town\u201d established by their bosses.)\n\n\u201cThe city had better supplies of water, city services, and these suburbs couldn\u2019t compete,\u201d said Dominic A. Pacyga, author of Chicago: A Biography.\n\n(New York, which at the time consisted only of the island of Manhattan, responded by amalgamating with four surrounding counties, building a five-borough city whose population was beyond the reach of Chicago.)\n\nIn the years following that mass annexation, Chicago added bits and pieces along its borders: Rogers Park and Norwood Park in 1893, Edison Park in 1910. (The latter was won by Chicago\u2019s new Schurz High School, which was easier to get to than neighboring Maine Township\u2019s.) Mount Greenwood was the last major residential neighborhood to join the city, in 1927.\n\nAnnexation ended for two reasons: the city was growing too large and unwieldy to manage, and it hit a wall of suburban resistance. We courted Oak Park and Evanston, but, with well-established identities as railroad suburbs, they turned us down. The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District allowed suburbs to buy water from Chicago, and neighboring towns developed their own city services, often better than Chicago\u2019s. Then, in the white flight era following World War II, suburban addresses became a class symbol.\n\n\u201cOnce the smaller suburban communities figured out how to provide water and sewer and high schools, they went on their merry way,\u201d said Ann Durkin Keating, professor of history at North Central College.\n\nCleveland stopped growing in 1923, and Detroit in 1926. But that hasn\u2019t been true of all Northern cities. Indianapolis merged with its suburbs in 1970. Columbus has grown into the largest city in Ohio by requiring annexation in order to join its water system. Even here in Illinois, Decatur has been grabbing unincorporated land to make up for population losses resulting from its flailing industrial base.\n\nDown South, Houston has expanded to 662 square miles \u2014 nearly three times Chicago\u2019s size \u2014 by ruthlessly grabbing every piece of land in the path of its growth. Thankfully, even Houston is slowing down, due to a new Texas law requiring cities to get permission from the communities they annex.\n\nThat\u2019s the law in Illinois, too. Even annexing Mount Hope Cemetery, which is in an unincorporated area and contains no voters (we\u2019ll spare you the joke about dead people voting in Chicago), would require an act of the legislature. Those barriers mean Chicago\u2019s borders will likely remain fixed.\n\n\u201cThere was talk a few years ago: \u2018Why doesn\u2019t Evergreen Park become part of Chicago? Why don\u2019t the inner-ring suburbs become part of Chicago?\u2019\u201d Pacyga said. \u201cIt\u2019s more expensive to live in the suburbs, but you get this feeling, \u2018I live in the suburbs.\u2019 It\u2019s a social class thing.\u201d\n\nChicago doesn\u2019t have the motivation to grow, either, according to Pacyga. The city makes more money selling its water to suburbs than to its own residents. Struggling suburbs such as Riverdale and Dolton might benefit from joining Chicago, because their property tax rates are so much higher than ours, but absorbing another municipality could be a strain on the city\u2019s budget.\n\nLastly, there\u2019s the issue of cultural identity. As we learned in the great \u201cbruh\u201d debate of 2017, Chicagoans have a nose for suburbanites claiming the city as home. (You can even take a quiz about it.)\n\nIn the Cash Box Kings\u2019 song \u201cJoe, You Ain\u2019t From Chicago,\u201d a narrator in the song\u2019s opening skit calls Johnnie\u2019s Italian Beef \u201cthe best beef place in Chicago.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoe, that ain\u2019t Chicago,\u201d he\u2019s told. \u201cThat\u2019s Elmwood Park.\u201d\n\nFor now, that\u2019s not going to change."}]}
