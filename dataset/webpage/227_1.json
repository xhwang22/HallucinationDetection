In addition to our two proprietary surveys of state withholding and sales tax receipts, we do our own macro-economic research, and, unlike many other research-providers, do not manage money: we are beholden to no one but our subscribers and ourselves.\n\nPhilippa Dunne and Douglas Henwood were John Liscio\u2019s closest associates and, since John\u2019s untimely death in 2000, are honored to be carrying on the research techniques he pioneered when he established The Liscio Report on the international scene in 1992.\n\nWe are known for our meticulous dissection of federal data, for pointing out technical anomalies glossed over in the mainstream press (and related debunking of market rumors), and for ferreting out market-moving shifts in the economic landscape as they develop, getting the news out to our readers before the mainstream media catches on. We also grill the highly informed senior tax officials who participate in our surveys on their favored indicators, like diesel-fuel consumption, and collect their thoughts on emerging economic trends for our subscribers. They are watching the cash flow into the state coffers so they know what they are talking about.\n\nLook for us in Barron\u2019s, the FT, Reuters; on MSNBC and Bloomberg; and around the web.\n\nPhilippa Dunne\n\nPhilippa Dunne was hired by John Liscio in 1996 to work on special projects, and in 1997 began full-time work as the \u201cresearch department,\u201d specifically to develop her own set of states for our monthly surveys of state tax collections and to handle the burgeoning demands of The Liscio Report. She often appears on television discussing wage and labor issues, as well as specific Federal Reserve research.\n\nShe graduated from University of California and has a Master\u2019s Degree from Wesleyan University.\n\nDouglas Henwood\n\nWhile working toward his PhD in English at the University of Virginia, Doug returned to his earlier interest, the dismal science, and by the mid-1980s was regularly writing about the world economy with special attention to finance and the labor markets.\n\nHe caught the attention of John Liscio and as the \u201cresident wise man\u201d he crunched stats and analyzed them for John from the report\u2019s very first days. A widely recognized economic analyst, Doug has given talks at venues all over the U.S. and abroad as well. He\u2019s also frequently quoted or cited in the media, including newspapers ranging from The Asia Times to the New York Times to the Times of London.\n\nHale Stewart\n\nFrequent contributor Hale Stewart was a bond broker with Vining Sparks, where his clients included mutual funds, insurance companies, and money managers, until he decided to go to law school that is. He made that decision in 2001, graduating from the South Texas School of Law in 2003. After law school, he opened his law practice focusing on transactional work. He continued his education at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law in 2007 where he obtained an LLM in domestic and international taxation, graduating Magna Cum Laude.

In the late 1980's and early 90's, he was on the staff of the financial weekly Barron's.\n\nIn October, Barron's said that Mr. Liscio had made a success of himself on his own, writing for the last eight years The Liscio Report, ''an astute and irreverent look at the credit markets and economy.''\n\nMr. Liscio told Barron's at that time: ''I don't try to forecast. I don't think forecasting is something within the realm of human possibility.''
