The iconic RUSH drummer was 67 years old.\n\nEarlier today (Saturday, January 11),Rod took to his social media to write: \"Neil Peart was a Renaissance man. Most of us know him as the iconic drummer and lyricist of RUSH. But beyond his exceptional talents in the world of music, Neil's zest for life, thirst for knowledge, and quest for adventure led him down many paths.\n\n\"I had the honor and pleasure of meeting Neil in 1985, when the STEVE MORSE BAND toured with RUSH as their opening act on the band's 'Power Windows' Tour.\n\n\"Most touring musicians will attest to the absolute joy and excitement of bringing their music to audiences around the globe. Most of these same musicians will also agree on the physical and emotional toll that endless touring can take on a human being. That said, a typical show day often consists of travel, sound checks, meet and greets, interviews, the performance, followed by more meet and greets. Well, as if this is not enough, a typical show day for Neil Peart on RUSH's \u201885/'86 'Power Windows Tour' would usually begin in the wee hours of morning, as Neil would journey on his bicycle from the previous city (assuming said previous city was within 150 miles of the next gig). Neil would often be on his bike for hours, arriving in time for RUSH's sound check. Directly after sound check, he would have dinner, which was immediately followed by a one-hour conversational French language lesson with a local French-speaking tutor. Upon completing his French lesson, Neil would proceed to a private practice room and warm-up on a small drum kit prior to the band's two-hour concert.\n\n\"Neil Peart is the textbook definition of 'Carpe Diem'. He truly seized every moment of life to engage in something of importance, be it music, reading, writing, philosophizing, bicycling, motorcycling, trekking through foreign lands, climbing the highest peaks, and devoting himself to family. He is a truly inspiring human being, whose breath of humanity has touched millions around the world. I am forever grateful to have known this unique and special man.\n\n\"RIP Neil.\"\n\nRod also shared a photo that was taken in 1994 at the Manhattan Center in New York City at a record-release celebration of \"Burning For Buddy, Volume 1\", a tribute album put together by \u202aPeart\u202c and Cathy Rich, using Neil's celebrity to bring the music of \u202aBuddy Rich\u202c and big-band music to a new audience. He wrote: \"A dozen or so drummers each performed with the \u202aBuddy Rich\u202c Big Band. It was one of the most daunting experiences of my life. Exciting AND terrifying.\"\n\nPeart joined RUSH in 1974. He was considered one of the best rock drummers of all time, alongside John Bonham of LED ZEPPELIN; Keith Moon of THE WHO; and Ginger Baker of CREAM. Peart was also RUSH's primary lyricist, drawing inspiration from everything from sci-fi to Ayn Rand.\n\nNeil's survivors include his wife Carrie and daughter Olivia."}, {"url": "http://rodmorgenstein.com/", "page_content": "After years of noodling with the idea of creating specialty tools for drummers, to help with the handful of pesky issues all drummers face at one time or another, the first tool - Wing Thing - has finally come to fruition.

The group was finally signed to Capricorn in 1977, and recorded several albums before they temporarily disbanded in 1983.

The university was a hotbed of musical activity during this period, playing host to brilliant future talents like Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius, Danny Gottlieb, T Lavitz and Bruce Hornsby. Playing under the official Studio Music and Jazz curriculum title of Rock Ensemble II, the Dregs honed their fusionesque chops. It was here that the band recorded its classic Great Spectacular album now available on CD.\n\nThe Dixie Dregs' music combines rock, jazz, bluegrass, folk and classical influences into a rich, ever-changing tapestry of sound. All the while, Rod\u0092s drumming weaves its way seamlessly and colorfully through this swirling musical landscape.\n\nHis unique, dynamic and musical drumming style has led to Rod\u0092s winning the Best Progressive Rock Drummer award in Modern Drummer Magazine\u0092s Reader\u0092s Poll 5 years in a row (1986-1990) and Best All-Around Drummer (1999), earning him a permanent position in the magazine\u0092s prestigious Honor Roll. The Dixie Dregs, whose last 6 recordings have each received Grammy nominations for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, are best described in the following Philadelphia Inquirer concert review, \u0093The Dregs have their own unique language and style familiar to bluegrass and country music, refined with classical finesse and delivered with high-powered technology and rock energy. The band is possibly the most important, and certainly the most technically advanced, instrumental group in progressive fusion.\u0094\n\nWhen the group temporarily disbanded in 1983, Rod joined forces with Steve Morse who, along with bassist Jerry Peek, formed the Steve Morse Band. Rod remembers, \u0093One of our biggest breaks came when we had the opportunity to tour for 3 months with Rush on their 1985-1986 Power Windows tour. I felt a surge of popularity, both as a band and as a drummer, as a result of performing night after night in sold out arenas packed with appreciative progressive-rock fans. And it was more than obvious that many of them were drummers.\u0094\n\nThe Steve Morse Band recorded two albums, at which point Rod found himself at a crossroad in his career, as Steve Morse joined the reforming group Kansas. \u0093I was ready for a musical change and to try something both new and challenging.\u0094\n\nWithin a year of moving to New York City in 1986 after living in and around Atlanta, Georgia, for the previous 11 years, Rod met Kip Winger and Reb Beach, namesake and lead guitarist of the as-of-then-non-existent band Winger. \u0093Kip and Reb had been writing and recording demos and forever being rejected by record labels. I met them at a point in their lives where they were completely driven to get signed. Nothing could shake their determination. We got together and jammed, hit it off, and two months later they called to say they got a deal and to see if I\u0092d be interested in doing the record.\u0094\n\nThe rest is history! Their self-titled debut album in 1988 sold over two million copies worldwide, earning the band a platinum album in the U.S. and gold albums in Japan and Canada. It also led to an American Music Award nomination for Best New Heavy Metal Band. This album was followed by In the Heart of the Young and, once again, platinum and gold awards were in the offing, coupled with non-stop international touring.\n\nThe band ceased activities in 1993 after touring for the highly acclaimed Pull recording, as dramatic changes were taking place in the music scene. Alternative music had replaced metal as the accepted music of the day.\n\nIn 2002, WInger reunited for a summer tour with Poison, CInderella and Faster Pussycat in support of 'The Very Best of Winger', a greatest hits collection. And in 2006, the band released the critically acclaimed, 'Winger IV', followed by tours in Europe, US, Japan and Australia.\n\nIn 1993, when Winger temporarily disbanded, Kip Winger set out to record his first solo album, This Conversation Seems Like Dream (1997), a dramatic departure from the first three Winger recordings, drawing heavily on world percussive rhythms, dark imagery and heavy grooves. Rod recorded the drum tracks for this album and the more recent Songs From The Ocean Floor (2001) at Kip\u0092s home studio in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\n1997 also saw the self-titled debut release by the Rudess/Morgenstein Project, an instrumental progressive power-duo, featuring Rod and Dream Theater keyboardist extraordinaire Jordan Rudess. The seed for this project was planted one evening on the Dixie Dregs 1994 Full Circle tour in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when a sudden power failure shut down the guitar, bass and violin rigs. For whatever reason, the keyboards remained unaffected. And what followed was a blistering, 10 minute drum/keyboard power-duo jam, which brought down the house. It was that evening\u0092s events, which inspired Rod and Jordan to form their \u0093small in numbers yet mighty in sound\u0094 band. The Rudess Morgenstein Project has played concerts in the US, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Mexico, Germany, Holland and the UK. Additionally, Rod recorded the drum tracks for Jordan's solo cds, ' Rhythm of Time' and 'The Road Home'.\n\nOther on-going projects that Rod is involved with are jam band Jazz Is Dead which features creative improvisations of the music by the Grateful Dead. Members of JID have included T Lavitz, Alphonso Johnson, Jeff Sipe, Billy Cobham, Jeff Pevar, Dave Livolsi, and Jimmy Herring, with an ever-changing line up. Another project is Platypus, whose two recordings feature John Myung (Dream Theater), Ty Tabor (King\u0092s X) and Derek Sherinian (Planet X). The music is a mix of instrumental and vocal tunes that blend many different styles together. An offshoot of Platypus is The Jelly Jam, a power trio featuring Rod, Ty Tabor and John Myung. Their debut release came out in 2001, and The Jelly Jam, '2' was released in 2004\n\nIn addition to his recording and touring credits, Rod is very active in drum education. He is currently a Professor of Percussion at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Mass. Also, his highly recognized instructional materials include videos, audio cassettes and books. His most recent offering is Drum Set Warm-Ups , touted as the definitive text for developing and improving all aspects of drum set playing. Additionally, Rod has been a columnist for Modern Drummer Magazine (U.S.), Rhythm Magazine (UK), Sticks Magazine (Germany) and is an international clinician and involved with product development for Sabian Cymbals (Signature Tri-Top Ride), and Vic Firth Sticks (Signature Sticks and Isolation Headphones), with whom he has been an endorser for many, many years."}, {"url": "https://musicxplorer.com/artists/rod-morgenstein-drummer/", "page_content": "Rod Morgenstein- Drummer\n\nDixie Dregs and Grammy Nominee\n\nRod is a New York native, founding member, and drummer of the Dixie Dregs, a six-time Grammy nominee.

Two months later, Rod received a call from the band, and they were off to record their self-titled, debut album, Winger, in 1988. It went double platinum. Winger followed up in 1990 with In the Heart of the Young. In 1993, they released the album, Pull, as grunge came in and changed the music scene. The band decided to take a break, but got back together in 2002, and have had sporadic reunions since, and continue to do so as time permits. Winger will be releasing a new album in 2021.\n\nRod\u2019s other projects include the Rudess/Morgenstein Project, an instrumental progressive power-duo, featuring Rod and Dream Theater keyboardist extraordinaire, Jordan Rudess, with two albums to their credit.
