{"Heinz Christian Pander was a professor of anatomy at the University of Dorpat from 1820 to 1845.": [{"url": "https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/christian-heinrich-pander-1794-1865", "page_content": "Christian Heinrich Pander, often remembered as the father of embryology, also explored the fields of osteology, zoology, geology, and anatomy. He was born in Riga, Latvia, on 24 July 1794. Pander, with an eclectic history of research, is best remembered for his discovery and explanation of the structure of the chick blastoderm, a term he coined. In doing so, Pander was able to achieve the goal set forth by his teacher, Ignaz D\u00f6llinger, to reinvigorate the study of the chick embryo as a means of further exploring the science of embryology as a whole. His findings paved the way for the work of Karl Ernst von Baer, who would later revolutionize the field of embryology with his research.\n\nPander initially studied in the local schools of his hometown, Riga, and eventually enrolled in the University of Dorpat in 1812. While studying there, Pander attempted to pursue an education in both medical science as well as natural history. It was during this time that Pander began to work with an anatomist named Karl Friedrich Burdach who had previously taught Karl Ernst von Baer. Pander left Dorpat in 1814 and traveled to Germany. It was there in 1816 that Pander met von Baer, who convinced him to study at the University of W\u00fcrzburg under the tutelage of Ignaz D\u00f6llinger. Pander agreed and traveled to W\u00fcrzburg where he received his MD in 1817. It was also here that he published his dissertation, Historia Metamorphoseos Quam Ovum Incubatum Prioribus Quinque Diebus Subit, a study of the components of the chick embryo including detailed illustrations by Eduard Joseph d\u2019Alton.\n\nDuring his work at the University of W\u00fcrzburg, Pander discovered the blastoderm of the chick embryo. The blastoderm is the outermost cellular layer of the embryo, which Pander believed contributed greatly to embryonic development. He studied the blastoderm\u2019s role in early embryonic development, describing the outer, middle, and inner layers in detail while only being able to conclude that the development of blood vessels occurred in the middle layer and that important events of embryonic development followed thereafter. Despite the lack of in-depth conclusions, Pander\u2019s discovery and recognition of the blastoderm as well as the layered structure of the embryo provided invaluable information and guidance to his colleagues as well as future embryologists, including von Baer.\n\nDespite promising early research, Pander did not pursue further work in the study of chick embryos or embryology in general. After he obtained his MD and published his dissertation, Pander began traveling through Europe visiting science museums and continuing his work of observation in the fields of biology, paleontology, and geology. His primary goal in doing so was to visit and study the newest and most intricate fossils and skeletons discovered in different parts of the world. Pander eventually began to publish a series of works on osteology, the study of bones, collaborating once again with E. J. d\u2019Alton. Pander became a member of the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg in 1821 and a member of the St. Petersburg Zoological Academy in 1826. For the remainder of his life, Pander lived mainly in his estate near his hometown of Riga while still taking time to travel and continue his work in the fields of geology and paleontology, though none of his later work gained significant recognition. Pander died on 22 September 1865 in St. Petersburg. Though somewhat inconclusive, Pander\u2019s work with chick embryos and their components marked the beginning of a more advanced understanding of embryology."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Heinz_Christian_Pander", "page_content": "Dear Wikiwand AI, let's keep it short by simply answering these key questions:\n\nCan you list the top facts and stats about Heinz Christian Pander?\n\nSummarize this article for a 10 years old"}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/pander-christian-heinrich", "page_content": "PANDER, CHRISTIAN HEINRICH\n\n(b. Riga, Latvia, Russia, 24 July 1794; d. St. Petersburg, Russia, 22 September 1865)\n\nembryology, anatomy, paleontology.\n\nPander was the son of a wealthy banker of German descent. After studying in the local schools of Riga, he entered the University of Dorpat in 1812. Dorpat had been refounded in 1798, and its faculty was German trained. Prior to this the Baltic gentry had traditionally sent their sons to German universities. Although his father had wanted him to study medicine, Pander was more interested in natural history, but he attempted to combine the two. At Dorpat he came under the influence of the anatomist Karl Friedrich Burdach, who had also taught Karl Ernst von Baer; Baer later continued Pander\u2019s embryologic researches.\n\nIn 1814 Pander left Dorpat for Berlin and from there he went on to G\u00f6ttingen. In March 1816, at a congress of Baltic students resident in Germany, he renewed his acquaintance with Baer, who persuaded him to come to the University of W\u00fcrzburg and study under Ignaz D\u00f6llinger. In his autobiography Baer states that he, Pander, and D\u00f6llinger had discussed D\u00f6llinger\u2019s hope that someone would study anew the development of the chick embryo. Pander took on the task and he received his M.D. at W\u00fcrzburg in 1817. His dissertation, \u201cHistoria metamorphoseos quam ovum incubatum prioribus quinque diebus subit,\u201d was amplified and then published in German (1817) with illustrations by the elder E. J. d\u2019Alton.\n\nPander discovered the trilaminar structure of the chick blastoderm, a term he also coined. He stated that he used the term blastoderm, from the Greek blastos, germ, and derma, skin, because the embryo chose it as \u201cits seat and its domicile, contributing much to its configuration out of its own substance, therefore in the future we shall call it blastoderm.\u201c He described the three layers as the serous or outer, the vascular or middle, and the mucous or inner. In the twelfth hour of embryonic development he reported that the blastoderm consisted of two entirely separate layers: an inner layer, thick and opaque; and an outer layer thin, smooth, and transparent. Between these two a third layer developed, in which blood vessels formed and from which \u201cevents of the greatest importance subsequently occur.\u201d When Baer receieved a copy of Pander\u2019s work in 1818 at Konigsberg University, where he was serving as prosector to his old Dorpat professor, Burdach, he began his own investigations, which ultimately revolutionized embryology. Baer\u2019s first treatise on the subject includes an introduction styled as a personal letter to Pander, explaining his differences with his old friend.\n\nPander, for reasons that are not entirely clear, never pursued his early research, although he regarded his studies as incomplete and had expressed himself only briefly on the subsequent transformations that took place in the embryo. After receiving his degree, Pander traveled in a leisurely manner through Germany, France, Spain, Holland, and England with d\u2019Alton as a companion, visiting anatomical museums and making various paleontological, geological, and biological observations. In 1821 he began publishing a series of papers on comparative osteology with illustrations by d\u2019Alton. In these osteological studies Pander developed an evolutionary theory of the development of animal forms which had strong Lamarckian overtones. Goethe endorsed his transformist ideas, and Darwin was aware of them through secondary sources.\n\nIn 1821 he became a member of the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg. He also traveled extensively in Russia at this time and wrote an account of the natural history of Bukhara in central Asia. In 1826 he became a fellow of the Zoological Academy in St. Petersburg, but in 1827 he returned to his estate near Riga, where he remained until 1842. In that year he returned to St. Petersburg as a member of the Mining Institute. He then resumed his travels in Russia, observing geological characteristics and gathering paleontological materials. Although he wrote almost exclusively on geological matters, he began a zoological collection and surveyed geological formations around St. Petersburg. Little of his later work has received the attention paid his earlier studies.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nI. Original Works.

As French philosopher, and contributor of the Encyclopedie Denis Diderot, said \"Indeed, the purpose of an encyclopedia is to collect knowledge disseminated around the globe; to set forth its general system to the men with whom we live, and transmit it to those who will come after us, so that the work of preceding centuries will not become useless to the centuries to come; and so that our offspring, becoming better instructed, will at the same time become more virtuous and happy, and that we should not die without having rendered a service to the human race. \"\n\nAccessibility World Heritage Encyclopedia, (WorldHeritage.org) is a live collaboration differing from paper-based reference sources in important ways.

Junto com karl Ernst von Baer e Martin Heinrich Rathke \u00e9 considerado um dos fundadores da embriologia moderna. As pesquisas de Pander sobre o desenvolvimento dos p\u00e1ssaros foram fundamentais para o triunfo do epigenetismo sobre o preformismo. Pander foi o primeiro que formulou a teoria dos folhetos embrion\u00e1rios, introduzindo o pr\u00f3prio termo \"folheto embrion\u00e1rio\" (\"Keimblatt\"), assim como o termo \"\" (\"Keimhaut\"). Al\u00e9m disso, Pander descreveu numerosas forma\u00e7\u00f5es geol\u00f3gicas da era prim\u00e1ria e identificou v\u00e1rios grupos de f\u00f3sseis. Ambas as linhas de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o eram para Pander manifesta\u00e7\u00f5es de um mesmo fen\u00f4meno: a metamorfose dos seres org\u00e2nicos, manifestada tanto no desenvolvimento individual como na transforma\u00e7\u00e3o das esp\u00e9cies. Foi, portanto, o primeiro naturalista em estabelecer um pararelismo entre o desenvolvimento ontogen\u00e9tico, a filogenia e o registro paleontol\u00f3gico. Embora n\u00e3o compreendida totalmente na sua \u00e9poca, a obra embriol\u00f3gica de Pander foi em geral muito bem recebida, considerando-se a mais importante desde a de Wolff. Sua obra \"Vergleichende Osteologie\" foi tamb\u00e9m bem recebida - Goethe a descreve laudatoriamente em sua \"Morfologia\" (1822) - e foi muito conhecida ao longo de todo o s\u00e9culo XIX.

In 1820 he took part in a scientific expedition to Bokhara as a naturalist. In 1826 he became a member of the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences.\n\nResearch\n\nPander studied the chick embryo and discovered the germ layers (i.e., three distinct regions of the embryo that give rise to the specific organ system). Because of these findings, he is considered by many to be the \"founder of embryology\". His work in embryology was continued by Karl Ernst von Baer (1792-1876), who expanded Pander's concept of germ layers to include all vertebrates.\n\nPander performed important studies in the field of paleontology, being known for his extensive research on fossils found in the Devonian and Silurian geological strata of the Baltic regions. His study of trilobites from this age led to the adjective 'Panderian', first used by the Canadian palaeontologist, Elkanah Billings. Pander is credited as the first scientist to describe primitive creatures known as conodonts.\n\nToday the Pander Society is an international *ociation of palaeontologists and stratigraphers with a common interest in the study of conodonts.\n\nHe died in Saint Petersburg.\n\nEponyms\n\nPander's eponyms are:\n\nPander's islands or blood islands\n\nSelected writings\n\nBeitr\u00e4ge zur Entwickelungsgeschichte des H\u00fchnchens im Eye , (Contributions to the embryology involving the chick egg), (1817).\n\n, (Contributions to the embryology involving the chick egg), (1817).
