Cameron\n\n1922-2005\n\nby Paul M. DeLuca, Jr., and James Zagzebski\n\nThe health physics and medical physics community lost a great leader and founding father with the passing of John R. Cameron, Emeritus Professor of Medical Physics at the University of Wisconsin (UW)-Madison.\n\nJohn was an Emeritus Fellow of the Health Physics Society (HPS), associate editor of Health Physics (1976-1979), president of the North Central Chapter HPS (1968), and a frequent contributor to Health Physics News.\n\nHe was a founding member of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) and served as its 10th president in 1968.\n\nJohn died on 16 March 2005 at age 82 in Gainesville, Florida, where he lived during the winter months and served as a Visiting Professor in the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University of Florida.\n\nJohn, born in northern Wisconsin in 1922, was raised on a farm and experienced firsthand the Depression years. In 1937 his parents moved to Superior so that he and his seven siblings could attend college. After enrolling at UW-Superior, John's education was interrupted by service in the U.S. Army Signal Corps from 1941 to 1946. After the war, he enrolled at the University of Chicago and received a BS degree in mathematics in 1947.\n\nSubsequently John moved to Madison and received his PhD in physics in 1952, with the thesis title \"Elastic Scattering of Alpha Particles by Oxygen.\" Despite John's protestations about the usefulness of his thesis research, these cross sections are still used today in ion beam implantation work. As an assistant professor at the Universidad de S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, John established many lifelong friendships. After a brief stint of post-doctoral work at UW-Madison, he became an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh (1956-1958). Finally, in 1958 John joined the faculty of the Department of Radiology at Madison, accepting an assistant professor position, with a joint appointment in the Department of Physics.\n\nThus began an illustrious career in medical physics. For the next three decades, John guided the UW Medical Physics Program from a \"one physicist\" operation to one of the largest and most productive in the world. Presently there are 21 faculty and 8 postdoctoral appointees training 86 students. Since its founding in 1958, the program has awarded more than 185 PhD and 156 MS degrees. Graduates and trainees have become leading medical physicists\u2014a source of great personal pride for John. The program was awarded departmental status in 1981, the first medical physics program to receive departmental status in the United States. John served as chair until his retirement in 1986.\n\nJohn is widely recognized for several innovative and seminal contributions to medical physics. He investigated and advanced thermoluminescence dosimetry, establishing most of the principal characteristics needed for wide applicability. This technology became the standard for personal radiation monitoring, eventually largely replacing traditional film densitometry.\n\nAt about the same time, John invented bone densitometry, which uses precise radiation measurements to determine the mineral content of bone. Since the radiation doses were very small, his graduate students often used family members (and each other) as \"research subjects.\" A small change in a lactating mother's bone mineral was easily observed. One of his early bone densitometry publications (Invest. Radio. 3:141; 1968) was listed as its single most cited article on the 25th anniversary of Investigative Radiology. Many useful clinical applications of highly accurate bone densitometry became evident and a number of companies developed bone densitometers. Lunar Radiation (now GE-Lunar) arose directly from early work done in John's \"bone mineral lab.\" The number of bone densitometers in the world now exceeds 20,000.\n\nJohn was deeply concerned with excess radiation exposures in diagnostic radiology. He developed simple test tools and techniques to measure radiation and to evaluate the quality of x-ray images. These efforts led to the creation of Radiation Measurements, Inc. (RMI), a pioneering manufacturer in quality-assurance measurements, materials, and devices. This also led to product developments by several companies and to several standard techniques for radiation measurement and image quality assurance.\n\nMore recently, John founded Medical Physics Publishing, a nonprofit corporation whose initial objectives were to provide reprints of useful but out-of-print books. That company now publishes a wide spectrum of original books and is a major source of material relating to health physics and medical physics.\n\nJohn was interested in developing new applications of physics to medicine. He preferred to hire new faculty whose research was not in the mainstream at the time. John started a program for radiation physics measurement that with federal funding became the Midwest Center for Radiation Physics. His foresight led to the early development of significant programs at UW-Madison in applications that eventually became \"mainstream,\" including ultrasound, positron imaging, and digital angiography, to name but a few. He also helped initiate a program in magneto-encephalography, looking at the magnetic signals emitted by the brain. After his retirement, his interests spread into still more areas, including imagination and creativity.\n\nWhile an outspoken advocate for reductions in diagnostic radiation exposures, John was equally concerned about the excess and unwarranted concerns about near-background levels of radiation exposure. In recent years he devoted himself to educating the public accurately about the benefits and risks of radiation used in medicine. He was especially concerned about the fear caused by low-level radiation and analyzed much data to illustrate that these fears probably are unfounded. He argued this aspect by talking about longevity being a measure of health effects of radiation (Radiology 229:14-16; 2003). Indeed, he argued (convincingly) that radiation might be a beneficial \"trace element\" at very low doses (Physics and Society October 2001).\n\nJohn was chairman of the Bureau of Radiological Health, Food and Drug Administration Training Grants and Review Committee (1973-1974), a member of the Technical Advisory Panel for the Nuclear Shipyard Workers Study, Johns Hopkins University (1981-1986), a member of the Radiation Advisory Committee for Pennsylvania Power and Light (late 1980s), and a consultant to the United States Atomic Energy Commission and to the International Atomic Energy Agency (1967-1978).\n\nJohn received numerous honors for his contributions to medical physics, including the Coolidge Award from the AAPM in 1980. In 1995 he was one of only four recipients of a Roentgen Centennial Medal Award from Radiological Society of North America. In 2000 John received from the International Organization for Medical Physics the Madam Curie Award for activities in medical physics education in developing countries.\n\nFor all of his research and professional contributions, John's greatest legacy is the many students, trainees, and young faculty whose budding careers were nurtured in the UW Medical Physics Program. He was a caring and generous man who went out of his way to ensure that all of these young people had the best opportunity possible to develop their careers in medical physics. He was full of optimism and had a great sense of humor, catching many students by surprise as he taught them. Every graduate or trainee of the UW Medical Physics Program owes a debt of gratitude to John for his efforts on behalf of them and of the UW program.\n\nAmong his many attributes, John is legendary for two others. John took great pride in his Scottish frugality and would demonstrate it in a humorous manner. Also John had a philosophy that he used to inspire his students and others. He would always quote in the middle of a trying time during an experiment, \"Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly,\" meaning, \"It doesn't have to be perfect, just get it to work!\" More than once this was enough to spur on his student to \"just do it\" and not worry about perfection. Perfection could always come later if necessary.\n\nJohn is survived by his wife of 58 years, Von (Lavonda), two daughters, Ann Marie and Carol, and their spouses. They devoted much care and were of great support to him during his final illness. We extend our sincerest condolences to them.\n\nHe will be greatly missed."}, {"url": "https://www.ancientfaces.com/person/john-cameron-birth-1865-death-1937-australia/143459303", "page_content": "Refresh this page to see various historical events that occurred during John's lifetime.\n\nIn 1865, in the year that John Cameron was born, on December 24th, 8 months after the end of the Civil War, the Ku Klux Klan was formed in Pulaski, Tennessee by Jonathan Shank and Barry Ownby. They wanted to fight Reconstruction after the Civil War and to intimidate what were called \"carpetbaggers\" and \"scalawags\" - northern and southern whites who supported reconstruction. They also wanted to repress the newly freed slaves.\n\nIn 1874, by the time he was only 9 years old, on September 14th, the Battle of Liberty Place occurred in New Orleans - the capital of Louisiana. Some members of the previous Confederate Army assembled for the purpose of \"driving the usurpers from power\" and the Republican Governor - William P. Kellogg - was physically driven from his office. The former Confederates temporarily replaced him with (the former) Democratic Governor John McEnery. Federal forces arrived, put down the insurrection, and five days later the legally elected government was restored.\n\nIn 1884, John was 19 years old when on May 1st, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions - a US association - first resolved that \"eight hours shall constitute a legal day's labour from and after May 1, 1886, and that we recommend to labour organisations throughout this jurisdiction that they so direct their laws as to conform to this resolution by the time named.\" Previously, workdays would consist of 10 to 16 hours a day - 6 days a week. It would take years before the 8 hour workday became common practice - and longer before it became a law.\n\nIn 1903, at the age of 38 years old, John was alive when two brothers, Orville and Wilbur Wright, flew the first powered heavier-than-air plane. They flew 4 times in one day - the longest flight lasting 59 seconds and a little over 852 feet. While the brothers had notified several newspapers of their attempt, only one - a local paper - covered it. After their 4th flight, a gust of wind caught the plane, turned it over, and totaled it.\n\nIn 1937, in the year of John Cameron's passing, on May 28th, the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge opened to cars. Taking 5 years to build, the 4,200-foot-long suspension bridge was an engineering marvel of its time - 11 men died during construction. The \"international orange\" color was chosen because it resisted rust and fading. To the present, it is the symbol of the City that is known throughout the world."}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/232613194/john-cameron", "page_content": "Your suggestions have been submitted and will be reviewed by the memorial manager.\n\nYour edit did not contain any changes from the original.\n\nThank you!

Cameron died unexpectedly in hospital in Moncton, just shy of his 84th birthday on June 2, 2021. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him. John was born in 1937 in Moncton and was predeceased by his parents Roy and Annie (nee Chapman) and sister Joan.\n\n\n\nGrowing up in Moncton, he was an avid and gifted tennis and baseball player. He went on to study Engineering at Acadia University and the Technical University of Nova Scotia. It was in Halifax that he met his wife Anna, with whom he shared many years and adventures! John spent his career working for CN Rail on Prince Edward Island, Moncton and Toronto and retired in 1991. He was a member of St. Paul's United Church in Riverview and the Moncton Probus Club.\n\n\n\nA quiet, gentle and devoted family man, he loved time with his family especially the summers at the cottage in Pointe-du-Chene where he expertly cooked lobster for all who visited, but couldn't eat it himself! It was there that \"Papa John\" taught many visiting little ones how to swim. John was well known for driving Ford cars, taking various models (and various relatives) across Canada and the United States. He had a special skill for transporting oversized renovation materials locally which would inevitably perch half in and half outside the vehicle.\n\n\n\nAn avid woodworker in retirement, he built many things over the years that are cherished by his family and will be passed on to future generations. He quietly helped friends and neighbors with whatever project they had on the go and made sure they had the right tools for the job. He delivered newspapers for a sick son, taught grandchildren to swim and was the grand creator of Papa John burgers.\n\n\n\nJohn is survived by his wife of almost 60 years Anna (nee McKillop) and children Nancy (Toronto) and Brian and his wife Maureen (Sudbury), grandchildren Anna, Marly and Hugh and niece Sandy Stevenson (Oklahoma).\n\n\n\nNo visiting by personal request.

The main brewery building is called the Lion Brewery, built in 1892 . The site has two wells, one of them 250 feet deep, and brewing on the site can be traced back to the 16th century. The brewery has a visitor centre and a Website with a history section.\n\nCamerons Brewery Ltd is a brewery founded in 1865 by John William Cameron in Hartlepool, County Durham, England. It is the largest independent brewer in the North East of England, with a brewery capacity of 1.5 million hectolitres (900,000 hl production in 2012) and a tied estate of 75 houses. It is one of the town's oldest industrial concerns, and has historically been one of the largest employers.\n\nAfter one hundred years of growth through brewery acquisitions, the company had an estate of 750 licensed premises throughout the North East and North Yorkshire by the 1960s. The company subsequently struggled as the economy of its trading heartland suffered, and as it underwent a succession of owners with little experience of running pubs and breweries. Camerons lost its independence to Ellerman Lines in 1974, followed by the Barclay Brothers in 1983 and Brent Walker in 1989. Brent Walker spun off the majority of the tied estate as a separate company called Pubmaster, which was acquired by Punch Taverns in 2003.\n\nCamerons was purchased in 1992 by Wolverhampton & Dudley, which invested heavily in the brewery before selling the company to Castle Eden in 2002, who closed their own site and moved all production to Camerons. The company now has a relatively small tied estate but the ninth largest brewery in the country. As a result, around 80 per cent of its business involves contract brewing for other companies, such as Heineken, which owns 24 per cent of the company, and Carlsberg.\n\nCamerons is known across the United Kingdom for Strongarm, a distinctive ruby red bitter launched in 1955. Total production of Strongarm surpassed one billion pints in 2000. Across the North East it is also known for Castle Eden Ale and Trophy Special, both originally brewed at Castle Eden.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history\n\nA 250-foot artesian well has been used for brewing on the site since at least 1572. William Waldon (1805 - 1854), a farmer originally from Gainford, founded the Lion Brewery in the village of Stranton (subsequently a part of West Hartlepool) on land he bought from Ralph Walker for \u00a3300 in 1852. After Waldon's death in 1854, the brewery passed to his widow, Jane. John William Cameron was enlisted to run the brewery from 1865. In 1872 he took on the brewery and its 16 public houses under a 21-year lease. Henry Wilson, of the Phoenix Works in Stockton-on-Tees, built new brewery facilities for John Cameron in 1875. Further land for expansion of the brewery was purchased in 1876. Between 1885 and 1890 more land was bought and plans were made to build a new brewery. The present brewery building was completed in 1892. When the lease expired in 1893, Cameron purchased the brewery outright from the Waldons for \u00a334,442.\n\nPublic listing and acquisition trail\n\nIn 1894 the company went public, valued at \u00a3345,000, and owned 119 public houses. John William Cameron used this juncture to enter into semi-retirement, and managerial responsibility was devolved to his brother, Watson Cameron (died 1920).\n\nNixey, Coleclough & Baxter of the Brunswick Brewery in Hartlepool, was acquired in 1895, along with around 80 public houses. It had been the largest competing brewery in Hartlepool. The newly acquired brewery was closed in 1898, and Nixey and Baxter were both appointed to the Camerons board.\n\nJohn William Cameron died in 1896, by which time the brewery was one of the largest in the North of England.\n\nIn 1897, T E Chapman & Son of Sunderland was acquired with 83 public houses, and its managing director, Abel Chapman, joined the Cameron board of directors. By this time, John Ellerman was vice chairman of Camerons.\n\nThat same year, the Lion Brewery was further extended, to a 70 quarter capacity, capable of producing 130,000 barrels a year. In 1899 Camerons began to bottle mineral water and the company continued to expand. By this time 400 licensed premises were owned, including the majority of Hartlepool's public houses. The company prospered, and by 1907 the share capital of the company was \u00a3350,000 with another \u00a3350,000 of capital in the form of mortgage debenture stock.\n\nIn 1910, Heslop's Grange Brewery in Stockton was acquired along with 28 licensed houses. John Ellerman was company chairman by 1913. In 1915 the Lion Brewery was damaged by German shellfire. In 1920 Watson Cameron died, and A. J. Morgan and H. J. Hewlett became joint managing directors of the company. Morgan was in charge of organization and the offices, whilst Hewlett was in charge of brewing. Robert Newton Ltd of Newcastle was acquired, with 35 licences, and Plews and Sons Ltd of Darlington, with 100 licensed premises. In 1922, Watson's son, John Watson Cameron joined the company, and in 1935 he was made chairman and managing director.\n\nCameron's ale was sold as far north as Newbiggin-by-the-Sea in Northumberland, as far east as Guisborough, as far west as Hawes and as far south as Thirsk by 1938. Over 400 licensed houses were owned. Directly and indirectly the company employed 1,500 people. Cameron's owned 46 per cent of all public houses within the Borough of Hartlepool by 1939.\n\nIn 1950, John Watson Cameron's wife, Lillian, was appointed to the board, responsible for the furnishings and decoration of Cameron's licensed houses. In 1953, the Stranton bottling facility was opened. In March 1955, Strongarm bitter was introduced, as the industrial workers of West Hartlepool demanded a stronger pint.\n\nIn 1953, a controlling interest was acquired in John J Hunt, which owned the Ebor Brewery in York and Scarborough & Whitby Breweries along with 200 licensed public houses. In 1956 J Fryer & Sons of Brompton-on-Swale was acquired. In 1959 the West Auckland Brewery was acquired with 80 licensed public houses. In 1961 Russell & Wrangham of Malton was acquired with 90 licensed public houses. By 1967 the company had a market capitalization of \u00a36.7 million, or \u00a3106 million in 2013 prices. In 1971, John Watson Cameron retired as managing director, although he remained as executive chairman, and his son, John Martin Cameron, became managing director. Camerons introduced its own \"lager\" brand, Icegold, in 1972. Icegold was top fermented and actually a very pale ale rather than an authentic lager.\n\nCorporate ownership\n\nIn January 1974, Ellerman Lines acquired the 25 per cent stake in Camerons previously owned by Sir John Ellerman, 2nd Baronet, who had died. Directors and Cameron family members held a 9 per cent stake and Bass Charrington held 10 per cent.\n\nIn 1975, the company was acquired by Ellerman Lines for \u00a314 million, in an attempt to diversify from its declining shipping business. By this time Cameron's owned 500 pubs and 100 off-licences.\n\nIn 1980 Hansa lager was launched, brewed under licence from Dortmunder Actien Brauerei. Camerons spent \u00a32 million to upgrade their brewing facilities in order to brew bottom fermented lager, in what CAMRA described as \"the most ambitious scheme for a regional brewer yet\". The company had sales of \u00a351 million in 1981, and one per cent of the British beer market. Market share in the Tees Valley area was 25 per cent.\n\nIn 1983, Ellerman Lines was acquired by the Barclay brothers for \u00a345 million. In 1984, the Barclays attempted to sell Camerons to Scottish & Newcastle for \u00a344 million, but the brothers cancelled the negotiations when the government referred the deal to the Monopolies Commission.\n\nIn 1985, Cameron's held five per cent of the UK beer market. In 1985, the maltings building was demolished. Alistair Arkley was appointed managing director in 1985. Arkley split the pub and the brewing sides of the company into separate divisions, and divested the low-margin off-licence business. In 1986, Cameron's acquired 90 pubs from Mansfield Brewery, including 78 northern pubs and clubs, most of which were former North Country Breweries outlets, for \u00a313 million. In 1988, the company expanded into the North West for the first time after it acquired 17 pubs in north Lancashire.\n\nIn 1988, Camerons and Tolly Cobbold were sold to Brent Walker for \u00a3248 million. Camerons controlled 480 licensed public houses and 270 hotels and off-licences. In 1989, Camerons Brewery was described as one of the most efficient in the country, with a total annual capacity of over 500,000 barrels and production of 400,000.\n\nIn 1991, the heavily-indebted Brent Walker sold the brewery and 51 pubs to Wolverhampton & Dudley for \u00a318.7 million, beating a rival offer from the management. Brent Walker retained the bulk of the Cameron's estate, which it spun off as a Hartlepool-headquartered pubco called Pubmaster, which controlled 1,600 pubs and was sold to a syndicate of investment groups for \u00a3171.3 million in 1996. Meanwhile, the soft drinks arm was spun off under a management buyout called Orchid Drinks, with brands including Purdey's and Am\u00e9 (acquired by Britvic in 2000 for \u00a367 million).\n\nW&D had acquired a company that was in a \"sorry state\". Initially, brewery staff numbers were reduced from 360 to 120, and part of the brewery was mothballed, after W&D ended a contract to brew Labatt lager at the plant. However, W&D invested heavily in the brewery site and marketing, and the profitability of the brewery greatly improved. By 1995 W&D had doubled the size of the Cameron pub estate they inherited to 101 pubs. It was widely suggested by customers that the Camerons beers greatly improved after being acquired by W&D.\n\nIn 1997, contract brewing returned to the plant, with a licence to brew Foster's lager. By 1997, Cameron's market share in the North East had grown to 10 per cent, supplying pubs from Alnwick to Hull. In 1998, \u00a31 million was spent on a new filtration and fermentation system and a keg plant at the brewery. In 1999, a further \u00a3500,000 was invested in the previously mothballed areas of the brewery to bring it to its full capacity of 400,000 barrels after it won a series of contracts to brew Harp Lager, Heineken and Kronenbourg.\n\nTotal production of Strongarm surpassed one billion pints in 2000. The 2002 Good Beer Guide remarked that the Strongarm was \"Now substantially improved and with consistent character\".\n\nIndependence\n\nCastle Eden Brewery, owned by David Soley, took over Camerons in April 2002 for \u00a335 million, moving all operations to Hartlepool and closing down the Castle Eden plant. The Kronenbourg 1664 contract was renewed by Scottish & Newcastle in December 2002. In 2003, \u00a3500,000 was spent to build a new bottling line and an on-site microbrewery, The Lion's Den. In 2008, Cameron's spent \u00a34 million expanding its capacity from 375,000 barrels to around 800,000 barrels. This followed the agreement of a contract with Scottish & Newcastle to supply Kronenbourg 1664, Foster's and John Smith's bitter until 2019. Previously the brewery had only produced Kronenbourg 1664.\n\nIn 2013, Camerons acquired the Hexham-based Head of Steam craft beer chain, including seven outlets, in a deal financially backed by Carlsberg.\n\nIn 2015, Gold Bullion joined Strongarm as a year-round beer.\n\nIn July 2016, Camerons acquired Leeds Brewery's estate of seven pubs.\n\nOperations\n\nIn 2011, the brewery had a capacity of over 1.5 million hectolitres (over 1 million barrels) per annum. Production in 2012 was 900,000 hectolitres, with around 40,000 hl in own brand sales. The bulk of the brewery's own production is cask conditioned ale but it also sells bottled and keg ales. The company's most famous beer is Strongarm, a 4% abv bitter introduced in 1955, and other regular beers are IPA, Bullion Gold and Trophy Special. Strongarm is made with 18 per cent crystal malt, which contributes significantly to its distinctive ruby red colour and its roasted, malty flavour.\n\nThe barley comes from Yorkshire and Scotland. Camerons uses up to five different yeast strains for its various brands.\n\nIts arrangements with brewing companies include contracts to produce Foster's, Kronenbourg 1664, John Smith's Magnet, Tetley Imperial, and the keg versions of Tetley Mild and Tetley Dark Mild.\n\nThe company owns 75 public houses.\n\nHeineken holds a 24 percent stake in the company. However it is a silent partner, with no board representation or managerial control.\n\nThe Lion Brewery\n\nThe brewery building is called the Lion Brewery, and the company offers tours of the brewery. Camerons Brewery in Hartlepool has two wells, one of them 250 feet deep. Most of the brewery was built in 1890 when the company had aspirations to supply the whole of the North East. There are still a few reminders of lavish opulence; the floor and walls of the brewhouse are furnished with Italian marble that cost \u00a37,000 in 1970.\n\nIn 2011, the brewery had a capacity of over 1.5 million hectolitres per annum. It is the ninth largest brewery in the UK. It has twelve Yorkshire Squares for brewing ale.\n\nIn 2013, the brewery building was used as a filming location in the \"Prodigal Son\" episode of Vera.\n\nA \u00a3700,000 visitor's centre was opened next to the brewery in 2004, in the former Stranton Arms public house.\n\nAdvertising and sponsorship\n\nIn 1996, a \u00a3500,000 television and radio campaign saw Cameron's Strongarm advertised across Yorkshire and the Midlands for the first time.\n\nCameron's was one of the first breweries to sponsor football kits, with Middlesbrough FC from 1984\u201386 and Hartlepool United from 1985-1990 and 1993-2000.\n\nIn 2014, Cameron's began sponsoring BriSCA F1 driver John Downson Jnr, from Thornley. Dowsy, as he is often referred to, is a North East stockcar racer who races under the number 94. John has previously raced BriSCA F2s, where he was the 2012 pole sitter in the BriSCA Formula 2 Stock Cars World Championship race at Barford Raceway, before making the switch to the more powerful V8 powered formula, the BriSCA F1s later in the year. John is the first driver from the area to feature in a BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars World Championship title race for almost 20 years, finishing 10th in 2013, narrowly avoiding qualifying for the event in 2014."}, {"url": "https://www.wikizero.com/www//John_Cameron_(1872-1935)", "page_content": "Scottish footballer and manager\n\nJohn Cameron (13 April 1872 \u2013 20 April 1935) was a Scottish footballer and manager. He played as a forward for Queen's Park, Everton and Scotland and was noted as an effective goal-maker and goalscorer. In 1899 he became player-manager at Tottenham Hotspur and guided them to victory in the 1901 FA Cup. As a result, they became the only club outside the English Football League to win the competition. In 1898 he became the first secretary of the Association Footballers' Union, which was the ill-fated fore-runner of the Professional Footballers' Association. He later coached Dresdner SC and during the First World War he was interned at Ruhleben, a civilian detention camp in Germany. After the war he coached Ayr United for one season and then became a football journalist, author and publisher.[3] He had previously worked as a columnist for various newspapers before the war.\n\nEarly career [ edit ]\n\nBorn in Ayr and educated at Ayr Grammar School, Cameron began his career with local club Ayr Parkhouse, before moving to Queen's Park in early 1895.[4] He made 5 Glasgow Cup appearances and scored one goal for the Spiders (who were not members of the Scottish Football League at the time).[2]\n\nHe worked in a shipping office in Liverpool and joined Everton in September 1895 as an amateur, and then turned fully professional.[5] He switched from a centre-forward to an inside-forward while he was at Everton.[5] He made his senior debut in a 5\u20130 home League win over Sheffield United in October 1895. Cameron produced some excellent displays for Everton and made 48 appearances and scored 14 goals. This record included 6 games and 2 goals in the FA Cup. Cameron had been one of the highest earning footballers of the day with Everton. He returned to Queen's Park for two short spells in the second half of the 1895\u201396 season, making four appearances,[2] and also won a cap for Scotland: alongside Robert Smyth McColl, he played in a 3\u20133 draw with Ireland and helped Scotland win the 1896 British Home Championship.\n\nIn February 1898 while contracted to play for Everton, Cameron became involved in the movement toward unionisation of footballers in defiance of both League directives and club proposals which resulted in the power of players to seek high earnings. As the League were not willing to negotiate on this point Cameron broke contract with Everton and went to play for Tottenham Hotspur in the Southern Football League, directly because that League did not support the proposal to limit earnings.\n\nTottenham Hotspur [ edit ]\n\nOgden's Cigarette card of John Cameron after winning the 1900\u201301 FA Cup.\n\nIn May 1898 Cameron was signed by Frank Brettell as a player for Tottenham Hotspur. When Brettell was offered a better-paid position at Portsmouth and moved there in February 1899, Cameron succeeded Brettell and became player-manager for Tottenham.[5] He enjoyed instant success when, in his first game in charge, Tottenham became the first lower division club ever to come from behind against top flight opposition to win an FA Cup tie, Cameron himself scoring the winning goal against Sunderland.[6] In 1900 he led Tottenham to the Southern Football League title and a year later led them to victory in the 1901 FA Cup Final: after drawing 2\u20132 with Sheffield United, Tottenham eventually won the replay with Cameron scoring an equaliser in a 3\u20131 win. As a result, Spurs became the only club outside the English League to win the competition. Under Cameron, the club also finished as a runners-up in the Southern League in 1902 and 1904. Cameron scored 139 goals in 293 appearances, including 43 goals in 111 appearances in the Southern League. He resigned as Tottenham manager in March 1907.\n\nPrisoner in Germany [ edit ]\n\nAfter Tottenham Hotspur, Cameron worked briefly as a sport journalist, before going to Germany to coach Dresdner SC.[4][5] While there the First World War broke out and he was subsequently interned at Ruhleben, a civilian detention camp in the Spandau district of Berlin.[4] The camp contained between 4,000 and 5,500 prisoners. Gradually a mini-society evolved and football became a popular activity. Cup and league competitions were organised and as many as 1,000 attended the bigger games. Cameron was prominent in organising and playing football within the camp and was secretary of the Ruhleben Football Association.[4] During his time at the camp he was also a member of the Ruhleben Tennis Association.\n\nCameron was one of several former professional footballers at Ruhleben. Others included former England internationals Fred Pentland, Samuel Wolstenholme and Steve Bloomer, a German international Edwin Dutton and one of his former Tottenham players, John Brearley. On 2 May 1915 an England XI featuring Pentland, Wolstenholme, Brearley and Bloomer played a World XI captained by Cameron.[7]\n\nCareer statistics [ edit ]\n\nInternational [ edit ]\n\nAppearances and goals by national team and year National team Year Apps Goals Scotland 1896 1 0 Total 1 0\n\nHonours [ edit ]\n\nPlayer [ edit ]\n\nScotland\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nSources [ edit ]\n\nWho's Who of Everton (2004): Tony Matthews\n\n(2004): Tony Matthews Brown, Paul (2020).

All Rights Reserved.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nJohn Ancrum Cameron came from a military family of distinction. His grandfather, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Cameron, C.B. served with the 42nd Regiment of Foot during the Indian Mutiny and died at Bareilly on the 9th of August 1858. His father, Major Sir Maurice Alexander Cameron, K.C.M.G., R.E. served as Surveyor General of the Straits Settlements and was a Crown Agent for the Colonies. John Cameron had two brothers; Ewen Arthur Cameron and Alexander Cameron, both of whom served in the Army. Lieutenant Ewen Arthur Cameron served with the Royal Field Artillery and was killed during the Great War of 1914-1918. Alexander Cameron, K.B.E., C.B., M.C. served in the Royal Engineers and rose to the rank of Lieutenant General. Although this research is primarily about John Ancrum Cameron much information also is presented about the men previously mentioned. Their stories will be told at the end of this narrative.\n\nFigure 1. The Cameron Family Tree.\n\n2. EARLY LIFE AND FAMILY INFORMATION\n\nJohn Ancrum Cameron was born on the 27th of August 1903 at 27 Brunswick Gardens, Kensington, in the County of London [1]. His father was Major Sir Maurice Alexander Cameron, K.C.M.G., an Old Wellingtonian, and his mother was Ethel Georgiana Cameron, daughter of William Rutherford Ancrum of Upton St. Leonard\u2019s Court, Gloucester [2]. John was baptized in the Parish of Upton St. Leonards on the 27th of September 1903.\n\nFigure 2. The Cameron Family Home at 27 Brunswick Gardens, Kensington\n\n(Photograph courtesy of Google Earth)\n\nJohn never got to know his mother, as she died in September of 1903, only three weeks after his birth, possibly from complications during childbirth [3]. In 1911 at age 7 young John was at Camberley, Surrey as a visitor in the household of Captain Lambert Cameron Jackson, Royal Engineers. The census return for that year shows the following information:\n\nCensus Place: Camberley, Surrey Name and Occupation Relation Marital Status Age Sex Birthplace Lambert Cameron Jackson, Captain, Royal Engineer Head Married 35 Male County Galway, Ireland Olive Margaret Jackson Wife Married 28 Female Farnborough, Hampshire Maurice Alexander Cameron, Retired Major, R.E. Uncle\n\n(Visitor) Widower 55 Male Stirlingshire, Scotland John Ancrum Cameron,\n\nScholar Cousin\n\n(Visitor) 7 Male Kensington,\n\nMiddlesex Laura Puill Servant Single 28 Female Farnham,\n\nSurrey Lilian Rose Alexander Servant Single 21 Female Finley,\n\nSurrey\n\nIn all probability he was raised by a nanny with the help of other family members and at the age of 13 he entered Wellington College at the start of the Michaelmas Term [4]. While at Wellington he lived in Anglesey Dormitory House and became Dormitory Prefect and Head of Dormitory. He also played for the school VI. While at Wellington College he spent many happy days between terms visiting with his grandmother at Upton St. Leonards and with his Aunt Alice, visits that began in 1918 [5].\n\nFigure 3. John Ancrum Cameron at Age 12.\n\n(Photograph courtesy of John Lyons)\n\nIn 1922 John left Wellington College after the Lent Term. He passed out very well with his family teasingly saying that it was \"on account of his good handwriting.\" [6] Obviously this was not the whole story, as John was accepted at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, a distinction that would not have been granted to him solely on the merits of his handwriting. John did well at Woolwich and on the 26th of August 1924 he was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Corps of Royal Engineers [7].\n\n3. TRAINING\n\nFollowing his commissioning in the Royal Engineers, 2nd Lieutenant Cameron reported to the School of Military Engineering at Brompton Barracks, Chatham, Kent for further training as an engineer officer. He spent two years at Chatham and on the 26th of August 1926 he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant at about the same time that he received orders assigning him to the Queen Victoria\u2019s Own Madras Sappers and Miners in India [8]. This assignment to a unit of the Indian Army was to be a significant milestone in his life, as he spent most of his career with the Indian Sappers and Miners and came to love India and the Indian people.\n\nFigure 4. John Ancrum Cameron and his New Roadster, c. 1925.\n\n(Photograph courtesy of John Lyons)\n\nThe photograph above shows Cameron driving his new automobile with friends in the \"dickey seat\" and a petrol can on the running board. He was a man who kept up with the times. Even before World War 2 he traveled home to England on leave from India by air, while most still traveled by sea.\n\n4. ASSIGNMENTS AND CAMPAIGN SERVICE\n\nBangalore, India (1927)\n\nLieutenant Cameron arrived in India in 1927 and was assigned initially as the Assistant Adjutant of the Madras Sappers and Miners at St. John\u2019s Hill in Bangalore. Anxious to get an assignment with the troops in the field, Cameron remained at Headquarters for only a short time before being assigned to the 10th Field Company, Madras Sappers and Miners at Razmak on the North West Frontier in 1928 [9]. It here that he would have his first experience with active service in the field as a company officer. See Map 1, Addendum No. 4.\n\nNorth West Frontier (1929-1931)\n\nIn April of 1930 a rebel organization known as the Redshirts, under Abdul Ghaffar, began causing trouble along the Mohmand Frontier and in the border villages. The British found it necessary to establish a blockade line and an improved road system to ward off these rebels. A few minor actions were fought, but most of the period through March of 1931 was spent in making roads and building posts. A small expedition also was sent into Tirah during this period.\n\nLieutenant Cameron saw his first action on the 11th of May 1930 when 4,000 Tochi Wazirs attacked Datta Khel and were driven off by the Razmak Column, which included the 10th Company, Madras Sappers and Miners. Although the attack by the tribesmen was beaten off, the Circular Road between Razmak and Jandola was closed for some time. On the 10th of July 1930 Cameron\u2019s company along with the Razmak Column advanced to Tauda China and afterwards through Dwa Toi to Ladha. This advance ended the hostilities in Waziristan [10]. For his participation in the campaign, Lieutenant Cameron was awarded the India General Service Medal 1908-1935 with clasp [NORTH WEST FRONTIER 1930-31] [11]. See Map 2, Addendum No. 4.\n\nFigure 5. Lieutenant John Ancrum Cameron, Christmas Day, 1930, in the Khyber Pass\n\n(Photograph courtesy of John Lyons)\n\nBangalore, Home Leave and Dacca (1931-1934)\n\nIn March of 1931 Lieutenant Cameron was still serving as a company officer with the 10th Company, Madras Sappers and Miners. By this time the company had returned to Bangalore [12].\n\nFigure 6. Lieutenant Cameron and the 10th Company, Madras Sappers and Miners Field Hockey Team, c. 1931.\n\n(Photograph courtesy of John Lyons)\n\nIn December of 1931 Cameron went on home leave to England [13]. He remained on leave for 8 months and returned to India on the 18th of August 1932 when he again took up his position as a company officer with the 10th Company, Madras Sappers and Miners at Bangalore [14,15]. He served with the 10th Company until December of 1932 when he again took the post of Assistant Adjutant of the Corps at Bangalore [16]. This posting was a short one, however, for in March of 1933 he was assigned as a Company Commander of the Training Battalion, Madras Sappers and Miners at Bangalore [17].\n\nLieutenant Cameron served with the Training Battalion until April of 1934 when he was again assigned to a field unit. This time he was posted as a company officer to No. 11 Army Troops Company, Madras Sappers and Miners at Dacca [18]. He remained with this company for only a short time and in July of 1934 he left the Madras Sappers and Miners for other duties with the Military Engineer Service. See Map 3, Addendum No. 4.\n\nFigure 7. Lieutenant Cameron and his Section of Madras Sappers and Miners.\n\n(Photograph courtesy of John Lyons)\n\nThis photograph of Cameron was probably taken between 1931 and 1935. Cameron and the Corporal on his left are both wearing the ribbon bar of the India General Service Medal 1908. He is wearing two pips of a Lieutenant in the photograph and as he was promoted to Captain in 1935, this dates the photograph within the period cited.\n\nFort Sandeman (1934-1935)\n\nCameron was assigned to duties with the Military Engineer Service, Zhob and Sind [19]. After reporting to the M.E.S. he was assigned as the Assistant Garrison Engineer at Fort Sandeman [20]. He served in this capacity until 1936 when he was reassigned, after his promotion to Captain, as Officer Commanding, No. 11 Army Troops Company, Madras Sappers and Miners in Bangalore. In 1938, after about two years with his old company, he was posted as Officer Commanding the 15th Field Company, Madras Sappers and Miners the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade in Singapore.\n\nFigure 8. Fort Sandeman in Zhob.\n\n(Photograph courtesy of History of Pashtuns)\n\nPreparations for War (1939-1942)\n\nFollowing his appointment to Acting Major in September 1939, Cameron returned to Bangalore and assumed new duties as the Officer Commanding the 14th Field Company, Madras Sappers and Miners. By this time his experience with the Indian Army in general and the Madras Sappers and Miners in particular was great indeed. During the 12-year period between 1927 and 1939 he had served as Adjutant of the Corps and as a company officer or Officer Commanding a training company, three field companies and an army troops company, as well as performing duties as a Garrison Engineer. An officer who served under Cameron in the 14th Field Company had this to say about him [21]:\n\n\"I owe him much for he taught me the ins and outs of the Indian Army and in particular how to defeat the babu machinery. He was eccentric but kind even though when roused his temper was explosive. In those days he was a bachelor, teetotal and a regular church-goer, but he was certainly not dry in other respects. I enjoyed being under his command and I know that the Tamil and Telegu VCOs [22] and Ors [23] worshipped him.\"[24]\n\nIn April of 1941 Major Cameron assumed command of the 15th Field Company, Madras Sappers and Miners. He remained in this position only until November of 1941 when he relinquished command in preparation for his assignment to another unit. That assignment came in February of 1942 when he was posted as Officer Commanding the 12th Field Company, Madras Sappers and Miners with the 4th Indian Division. This assignment would take him into the heat of battle against the Axis forces in World War 2.\n\nNorth Africa (1942 - 1943)\n\nCameron arrived at his new company just in time to get caught up in Field Marshal Rommel\u2019s counter offensive against the British Eighth Army. The Eighth Army had hardly occupied Benghazi when it was ordered to demolish its port facilities and to withdraw. The 12th Field Company and the other 4th Indian Division Engineers carried out extensive demolitions in Benghazi and then withdrew eastwards towards the Gazala line. A lull in operations occurred at this time and the 4th Division Engineers helped the infantry to lay mines and prepare anti-tank defences. Half a million mines were laid.\n\nDuring this period and in fact during most of the North African campaign, the 12th Field Company directly supported the 7th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Indian Division.\n\nOn the 27th of May 1942 Rommel aimed a powerful attack at Gazala and by the 10th of June the Germans had breached the British defensive line. The British Eighth Army carried out a withdrawal to the Egyptian border, leaving behind only the garrison at Tobruk. The 4th Indian Division was relieved by the 5th Indian Division and the brigades of the 4th Division, in infantry brigade groups, were sent separately to Cyprus, Palestine and the Suez Canal Zone. Cameron and his company, in support of the 7th Infantry Brigade Group, went to Cyprus. See Map 4, Addendum No. 4.\n\nThis dispersal of his men to all points of the compass was a bitter blow to the Divisional Commander, Major General F.I.S. Tuker, CB, DSO, OBE. Ever since assuming command of the division his mind had been engrossed with the problems of desert warfare. Now his division had been committed piecemeal to defensive operations in widely dispersed areas. General Tuker expressed his bitterness as follows in a letter to the Deputy Commander-in-Chief, India:\n\n\"I have always opposed the pernicious infantry brigade group system. It does for small wars but it is rubbish for modern warfare. It leads to confusion, dispersion, unbalancing of forces and chaotic planning.\"[25] Figure 9. Major General Francis Ivan Simms Tuker, CB, DSO, OBE.\n\nDivision Commander, 4th Indian Division\n\n(Photograph courtesy of Wikipedia)\n\nAs a man of action, John Cameron was not thrilled either with the idea of his company taking a back seat on Cyprus while the big show was ongoing in North Africa.\n\nThe mission of the 7th Infantry Brigade Group on Cyprus was one of defence of the island and its military facilities. The previous scheme of defence for Cyprus had scattered the defenders in small groups covering the ports and beaches. In such dispersal the garrison represented little more than a liability to the Royal Navy. General Tuker proposed to concentrate his forces in a central position to provide the colony with the capability to withstand siege. The 7th Infantry Brigade took part in anti-invasion exercises and indulged in an extended period of training on the Cypriot mountainsides. Although not known at the time, these maneuvers would be valuable training for the upcoming operations in the mountains of Italy. Training for the 12th Field Company, however, was not as realistic as it could have been and sorely disappointed John Cameron. The engineer tasks for the anti-invasion exercises were chosen by infantry officers without engineer advice [26]. Engineer training consisted of road craters, railway bridge demolitions, mined chambers in rock and similar jobs, all of which could be accomplished in an hour or two by the planting of notice boards . No actual work was carried out and the Sappers gained very little experience from these simulated activities. Cameron was justifiably frustrated by this lack of realistic training for his officers, non-commissioned officers and men.\n\nDuring the spring and early summer of 1942, many changes were made in commands throughout the division. Of particular interest to Major Cameron was the assignment of Lieutenant Colonel John H. Blundell, OBE, R.E. as his new boss, replacing Lieutenant Colonel H.P. Cavendish, DSO, OBE, R.E. as the CRE of the division.\n\nIn the third week of August 1942, the 7th Brigade along with its supporting units were relieved in Cyprus and moved to Egypt. The 4th Indian Division reassembled and rejoined the British Eighth Army in November of 1942 prior to the pursuit of Rommel\u2019s forces after the Battle of Alam el Halfa. At last Cameron and his men were back in the action in North Africa.\n\nOn the 4th of November 1942 the 12th Field Company was assigned to a flying column whose mission was to round up prisoners, guns and equipment left behind by the retreating Italians in Rommel\u2019s force. Cameron and his company took part in this operation for several days, primarily with the mission of clearing minefields. On the 7th of November 1942 the 4th Indian Division was withdrawn from offensive operations and Major Cameron\u2019s company and the rest of the 4th Division Engineers were left behind at El Alamein on salvage operations to clear the battlefield. They rejoined the Eighth Army for its final attack on the Mareth Line [27]. See Map 5, Addendum No. 4.\n\nThe British attack on the Mareth Line commenced on the 20th of March 1943 with the 50th Division of British XXX Corps leading the attack. Casualties in the attack were extremely heavy and rains badly damaged a causeway across Wadi Zig-Zaou constructed by the 50th Division Engineers, thus hindering the forward movement of heavier tanks to support the infantry assault. On the night of the 21st/22nd of March 1943, heavy rain brought the wadi down and further damaged the crossing. On the 22nd of March, the Sappers and Miners of the 4th Indian Division were placed under orders of the 50th Division. During the afternoon of the 22nd the enemy counterattacked strongly and considerably reduced the bridgehead across the Wadi Zig-Zaou. When the engineers started work that evening to build two new causeways, conditions were extremely difficult. Led by their C.R.E., Lieutenant Colonel J.H. Blundell, R.E., and the two company commanders, 4th and 12th Field Companies plunged into the wadi bed and worked feverishly with fascines and wire mesh to build the causeways.\n\nThe enemy was on the offensive and at very close range. The wadi was an inferno of fire. The rising moon silhouetted the men working on the east bank and transport blocked the approaches to the crossing sites. When enemy fire opened up on the sapper parties, British covering detachments replied. From front and rear over the heads of the sappers, tracer rounds, mortars and sheets of machinegun fire streamed. Then the field guns joined in. Between the walls of exploding shells the engineers grappled with their task. The area around the Wadi Zig-Zaou was transformed into a block of dust and fumes, shot with flames rising into the luminous sky [28].\n\nOn the approaches to the wadi, vehicles continued to unload infantry for the coming assault. The press of transport blocked the sapper lorries carrying the steel mesh for the causeway. In the wadi itself in the midst of an ear-splitting din and a hail of bullets, the work proceeded calmly and steadily. Madrassi and Sikh Sappers and Miners lived up to the cool and imperturbable behaviour of their officers. Major W.J.A. Murray and Lieutenant J.R.S. Baldwin of the 4th Field Company and Major John A. Cameron and Subedar Sampangiraj of the 12th Field Company supervised the tasks as calmly as though on exercises [29].\n\nLieutenant Colonel Blundell was everywhere encouraging his men with his cheery laugh and exhortations. He pointed out how safe others must be since a man of his height remained unhit (although he actually had the peak of his cap shot off). In the middle of the bridging operations an infantry officer reached the wadi to ask for mine detectors in order to clear a way to one of his men who had been blown up in a minefield. Without hesitation Lieutenant Colonel Blundell and a sapper proceeded to the rescue. When the sapper was hit by machinegun fire, Blundell sheltered him with his body and carried him to safety.\n\nHour by hour the work continued. Small groups of men dashed forward a few yards at a time to deliver material to the workers in the cleft of the wadi. The ramps were cut, the fascines laid and the ballast spread to make firm crossings. At 3:30 a.m. on the morning of the 23rd of March 1943 the enemy put down a heavy barrage in preparation for a further counterattack. Under the fire the causeways were finished and Blundell, Cameron and their men withdrew started to withdraw from the wadi.\n\nThe Sappers and Miners might have been pardoned had they scurried for safety. But along the wadi the assault infantry waited. Before withdrawing Blundell explained to his men that it might have an unfortunate effect upon these troops if men were seen running to the rear. He therefore ordered that all should move back at a casual pace, chatting and joking as if on some ordinary occasion. Blundell himself left the area last, walking even more slowly than the others and stopping to talk to infantry groups to explain the situation while his men waited for him. On such occasions the Sappers and Miners halted around their officer, moving only when he moved. This cool behaviour was not wasted or frivolous. Many units bore witness to the heartening effect of the coolness, confidence and bearing of the Indian Sappers and Miners at Wadi Zig-Zaou [30]. The coolness and bravery of Major Cameron and the other officers and men of the 4th and 12th Field Companies during this action were truly extraordinary. It is difficult to understand why Cameron did not deserve the Military Cross or a least a mention in despatches for his brave conduct at Wadi Zig-Zaou.\n\nThe 4th Indian Division fought its way towards Tunis through the Matmata Mountains near Mareth and Zarat from the 25th through the 28th of March 19143. Major Cameron\u2019s next action with the 12th Field Company, Madras Sappers and Miners came on the 6th of April 1943 during the attack at Wadi Akarit. The attack on the Axis position was launched by British XXX Corps with the 51st Division on the right, 50th Division in the centre and the 4th Indian Division on the left. The divisional engineers of all three divisions had the task of making gaps in the minefields covering the position and making crossings over anti-tank obstacles. This they did under heavy fire. All three field companies had come forward to work on a track that would carry the divisional vehicles across the Oudane el Hachana ridges and the work went forward in the customary imperturbable fashion of the Indian Sappers and Miners. See Map 6, Addendum No. 4.\n\nDuring the course of the work a German artillery salvo took a tragic toll. At 1600 hours when Lieutenant Colonel John Blundell was conferring with his officers, a shell struck in the midst of the group of officers. Major W.J.A. Murray, MC, R.E., commanding the 4th Field Company and Captain Baldwin were killed outright, together with Lieutenant Allan, an American liaison officer who had joined the 4th Indian Division Engineers in Cyprus. The courageous Lieutenant Colonel J.H. Blundell was so seriously wounded that he died in the dressing station. See Addendum No. 5.\n\nFigure 10. Officers of the 4th Indian Division Sappers and Miners Killed at the Battle of Wadi Akarit.\n\n(Photograph courtesy of STEVENS, G.R. Fourth Indian Division. McLaren and Son Limited, Toronto, 1948).\n\nGeneral Tuker wrote the following regarding Blundell:\n\n\"He died yesterday evening, mourned by thousands of humble Indian soldiers.\"\n\nThe Commandant of the Bengal Sappers and Miners on hearing of Blundell\u2019s death remarked:\n\n\"He is the greatest individual loss that this Corps has so far suffered.\"[31]\n\nAfter the death of Lieutenant Colonel Blundell, Major Cameron relinquished command of this company, was appointed an Acting Lieutenant Colonel, and assumed the duties of the Commander Royal Engineers for the division [32]. Although honoured by this promotion, Cameron was very much saddened by the death of his old boss who he held in very high esteem.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Cameron took part in the final assault on the Axis forces in North Africa and the capture of Tunis. This took the 4th Indian Division Engineers through Sfax, El Djem, Sousse, Enfidaville and into action at Djebal Garci on 19-20 April 1943. On the 6th of May 1943 the British IX Corps, with 4th British and 4th Indian Divisions making the main attack at Medjaz el Bab, opened up the attack to penetrated the German position, with the British 6th and 7th Armoured Division tasked to exploit the penetration. The armoured divisions were to move through the gap opened by the infantry and secure the high ground immediately west of Tunis, thus breaching the inner defences of the town. The chief job of the engineers in preparation for the attack was to prepare routes forward for the armour. This included clearing gaps through enemy minefields as far forward as possible. Major Cameron\u2019s 12th Field Company, assisted by 200 Gurkha soldiers, also rebuilt 80 feet of roadway that had been cratered by the enemy to the north of Ste. Marie du Zit.\n\nThe overall British attack went entirely according to plan and victory was complete. The Germans surrendered on the 12th of May 1943 and Lieutenant Colonel Cameron\u2019s sappers were then put to work on clearing minefields and booby traps, bridging work, establishing water points and constructing prisoner of war cages. On the 17th of May 1943 the 4th Indian Division began to trek back to Tripolitania and a week later the division concentrated at Misurata, on the sea coast 120 miles east of Tripoli. Here the men of the Indian Sappers and Miners, along with the rest of the division, got a well earned two week\u2019s rest.\n\nLight training began early in June; however, on the 13th of June 1943 word was received that His Majesty the King-Emperor was in Africa and would review the 4th Indian Division on the 19th of June. While still serving as the Commander Royal Engineers of the 4th Indian Division, Lieutenant Colonel Cameron was chosen to command the Victory Parade in North Africa during a visit of H.M. King George VI. This honour was bestowed on him because of his superb command of the Indian languages. His competence with the languages was in fact so great that he was called upon to interpret for the King Emperor during the parade [33]. This competence with the language was developed by Cameron as a direct result of his esteem for his Indian soldiers and his desire to learn their customs and to be able to communicate fluently with them. He demonstrated this keenness to learn their languages early in his career and continued it for most of his life.\n\nCameron\u2019s organization of the Indian Sappers and Miners for the review by the King-Emperor was meticulous. The troops rehearsed their part in the review until their performance was near perfection. On the grand day the parade was formed at 1400 hours and Cameron held one final practice before the troops were stood easy. At 1450 hours cheers could be heard in the south as the King\u2019s car passed the divisional headquarters. The Indian Sappers and Miners were honoured to be on the right of the line, immediately after the Royal Artillery. This made them the first Indian unit to be inspected by the King-Emperor.\n\nThe cheers drew closer as the King passed the each field regiment of artillery. At the appropriate moment Cameron gave the order: \"The Sappers will come to attention!\" followed by the orders of each of the officers commanding the companies to bring their units to attention. The Royal car passed the 12th Field Company and then the 11th Field Park Company and stopped opposite Lieutenant Colonel Cameron who was presented to the King by General Tuker. In addition to General Tuker, Field Marshall Montgomery also was in the Royal car.\n\nCameron shook hands with King George VI and presented one of his VCO\u2019s, Subedar Narinder Singh, to His Majesty. The King, looking pleased with the Sapper and Miners, pronounced them \"A good lot\" at which time Cameron took a pace to the rear and ordered, \"Sappers and Miners, three cheers for His Majesty the King-Emperor.\" As the Sappers cheered, the officers raised their caps and the men their right hands in salute. In the evening General Tuker returned to visit with the 4th Division Sappers and Miners. Lieutenant Colonel Cameron gave his men each a bottle of beer with which to drink the health of the King-Emperor. The Pathans of the unit drank tea instead [34].\n\nFor his work during the capture of Tunis, Lieutenant Colonel Cameron is mentioned in the history of the 4th Indian Division with these words [35];\n\n\"Lieutenant Colonel JA Cameron, CRE, an efficient Scotsman, led the Sappers and Miners in the magnificent tradition of their Corps.\"\n\nFor his services in North Africa, Lieutenant Colonel Cameron was awarded the Africa Star [36]. As mentioned previously, he did not receive a decoration or even a mention in despatches although his command of the 12th Field Company under fire was exemplary. One wonders if such an award would have been forthcoming if Lieutenant Colonel Blundell had not been killed. His death prior to the end of the campaign in North Africa may have denied Cameron a much deserved award.\n\nItaly (1943 \u2013 1944)\n\nThe 4th Indian Division played an extensive role in the campaign in Italy where it served in the actions leading to two bloody assaults on the German positions at Monte Cassino. During these operations the engineers constructed and repaired mountain roads, installed barbed wire barriers and placed minefields in support of the attacking infantry. See Map 7, Addendum No. 4.\n\nFollowing the capture of Monte Cassino the division undertook operations on the lower Adriatic and in Central Italy. It also participated in Operation Vandal and in operations against the Gothic Line during August and September of 1944. At the end of September 1944 the division assembled in the vicinity of Lake Trasimeno to reorganize, refit and train for upcoming operations. Instead, the division received word that it would leave Italy and proceed to Greece. See Maps 8 and 10, Addendum No. 4.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Cameron performed his duties as the division\u2019s C.R.E. during the entire campaign in Italy and was awarded the Italy Star for his services [37]. It is believed that he continued these duties with the division after its move to Greece [38]. See Map 9, Addendum No. 4.\n\nThe 4th Indian Division sailed from the port of Taranto in November of 1944 and its transports rendezvoused at the island of Skiathos in the northern Aegean, where an advanced base had been established. The division engineers immediately began a survey of the docks and went to work on the roads. Lieutenant Colonel Cameron appears to have remained as the Commander of the 4th Indian Division Engineers until late January or early February of 1945 when he returned to India.\n\nIndia (1945 \u2013 1948)\n\nOn the 9th of February 1945, sometime after his return to India from Greece, Lieutenant Colonel Cameron was appointed Assistant Commandant (Administration) of the Madras Sappers and Miners at Bangalore. On the 23rd of May 1946, while at Bangalore, Cameron was mentioned in despatches for his outstanding service in the Mediterranean Theatre [39]. In addition he was awarded the 1939-45 Star, the Defence Medal and the War Medal for his services during World War 2 [40].\n\nMalaya (1948 \u2013 1970)\n\nIn June of 1948 field operations were begun against the Communist insurgents in Malaya. Lieutenant Colonel Cameron was ordered to Malaya where, on the 30th of May 1949 he was appointed Assistant Director of Works. He served with distinction in this capacity and on the 27th of April 1951 he was mentioned in despatches for his services in Malaya [41]. He was also awarded the General Service Medal with clasp [MALAYA] [42].\n\nIt appears that John Cameron liked his time in Malaya and decided to stay on even after he retired from the Army in July of 1952. Counterinsurgency operations were still on going at the time and in fact continued until July of 1960. After leaving the Army, Cameron found employment as a Security Officer in Pahang, Malaya. The precise nature of this work is not known, although one would suspect that it involved training of local security forces. Additionally, between 1953 and 1957 he served as the Commanding Officer of the Pahang and Selangor Home Guard and was involved in combating Communist guerrillas. He apparently had some very unpleasant experiences while in Malaya that he mentioned to members of his family at home, but was unwilling to talk about in detail [43].\n\nHe took a considerable interest in the people while serving in Malaya, just as he did with his Indian soldiers. He got involved with a church group of Christian Malays and he was injured in a serious motor accident while taking a group of local people to church for a Good Friday service [44].\n\nExcept for a trip to England in 1953 to celebrate his 50th birthday with relatives at the Falcon Hotel in Bromyard, John Cameron remained in Malaya until 1966 when it appears that he returned to England to stay [45]. In 1970 he was still using Lloyds Bank Ltd. in London as his mailing address [46].\n\n5.

SUMMARY OF MILITARY SERVICE\n\nLocation Period of Service Chatham, Kent June 1924 \u2013 August 1926 Bangalore, India August 1926 \u2013 December 1929 Razmak, North West Frontier, India December 1929 \u2013 March 1931 Bangalore, India March 1931 \u2013 April 1934 Dacca, India April 1934 \u2013 July 1934 Fort Sandeman, India July 1934 \u2013 1936 Bangalore, India 1936 \u2013 February 1942 North Africa February 1942 \u2013 November 1943 Italy September 1943 \u2013 November 1944 Greece November 1944 \u2013 February 1945 Bangalore, India February 1945 \u2013 May 1949 Malaya May 1949 \u2013 July 1952\n\nLocation Period of Service Home Service 2 years and 2 months Service Abroad 24 years and 11 months Total Service 27 years and 1 month\n\nAs the tables above indicate, Cameron spent almost 25 years of his 27 years, or over 90 percent of his career, in service abroad. All of this service abroad was with the Indian Sappers and Miners. As a bachelor, he had no ties of wife and children to prompt him to return to England. He loved India and was content to serve there.\n\n7. EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS\n\na. Education: John Ancrum Cameron\u2019s educational qualifications are as indicated in the table below:\n\nDate Educational Qualification Lent Term, 1922 Graduated Wellington College 26 August 1924 Graduated Royal Military College at Woolwich\n\nHe may have attended various military courses during his career; however, direct access to this service papers prevented a determination of this information.\n\nb. Positions and Qualifications: John Ancrum Cameron served in the following positions and earned the following qualifications during his time in service.\n\nDate Position or Qualification 1927 Assistant Adjutant, Madras Sappers and Miners 1928 Field Company Officer, Madras Sappers and Miners December 1929 Member, Institution of Royal Engineers [49] March 1933 Training Company Commander, Madras Sappers and Miners April 1934 Army Troops Company Officer, Madras Sappers and Miners July 1934 Assistant Garrison Engineer, Military Engineer Service 1936 Army Troops Company Commander,\n\nMadras Sappers and Miners 1938 Field Company Commander, Madras Sappers and Miners 6 April 1943 Commander Royal Engineers 9 February 1945 Assistant Commandant (Administration),\n\nMadras Sappers and Miners 1 September 1948 Staff Officer Royal Engineers 2 30 May 1949 Assistant Director of Works 1952 Security Officer, Pahang, Malaya 1953 Commanding Officer, Pahang and Selangor Home Guard\n\nAgain, it should be noted that the vagueness of some of the dates is due to the lack of access to his military service record from the Ministry of Defence. NOTE: Based on the current Ministry of Defence rules in the U.K., Cameron's service records will not become available to the public until 2021; that is, 25 years from his date of death.\n\n8. MEDALS, DECORATIONS AND AWARDS\n\nLieutenant Colonel John Ancrum Cameron was awarded the following medals and decorations during his time in the Army:\n\nFigure 11. The Cameron Medals in the Author's Collection.\n\n(Photograph from the author\u2019s collection)\n\nThe medals are, from left to right, the India General Service Medal 1908 with clasp [NORTH WEST FRONTIER 1930-31], the 1939-45 Star, the Africa Star, the Italy Star, the Defence Medal, the War Medal with Mention in Despatches oak leaf and the General Service Medal with clasp [MALAYA]. The Indian General Service Medal 1908 is not Cameron's actual medal. At sometime during his life he lost his original medal. This medal is actually named to 14988 SPR. KAKA KHAN. BENGAL S. & M. It has been added to Cameron's group of medals solely as a specimen replacement. The General Service Medal is named to LT.COL. J.A. CAMERON. R.E. The remainder of the medals are un-named, as issued. The Supplement to the London Gazette dated 27 April 1951, page 2384, indicates that 30513 Lt. Col. J.A. Cameron, Corps of Royal Engineers was mentioned in despatches for his service in Malaya. The citation for the Mention in Despatches reads:-\n\nThe War Office, 27th April, 1951\n\nThe King has been graciously pleased to approve\n\nthat the following be Mentioned, in recognition of\n\ngallant and distinguished services in Malaya, during\n\nthe period 1st July to 31st December, 1950: -\n\nCORPS OF ROYAL ENGINEERS\n\nLt.-Col. J.A. Cameron (30513)\n\n9. POST SERVICE LIFE\n\nThe Supplement to The London Gazette dated the 1st of July 1952 lists Lieutenant John Ancrum Cameron as retired from the Army on retired pay effective the 4th of July 1952. The Second Supplement to The London Gazette of the 29th of April 1952 (dated 2 May 1952) had previously listed him as completing his tenure as a Regimental Lieutenant Colonel remaining on full pay (supernumerary) with an effective date of the 12th of April 1952. He apparently remained with the Reserve of Officers until the 24th of December 1958 when the Supplement to The London Gazette of 23 December 1958 shows him as having exceeded the age limit and ceasing to belong to the Reserve of Officers.\n\nJohn Ancrum Cameron resided at 24 Broad Street, Bromyard, Herefordshire HR7 4BS from 1983 to 1996 [50]. According to a family member, he chose Bromyard as his retirement home because of the many happy memories he had of his school holidays spent in the area with relatives.\n\nOn the 3rd of June 1986 he had his Last Will and Testament prepared by Lloyds Bank. Although he was never married, he had numerous friends and relatives to whom he was very generous in his will. Among these were three godsons and four goddaughters [51].\n\nAlso mentioned in his will was The Lower Sapey Centenary Fund, a trust for Saint Bartholomew\u2019s Church in Lower Sapey Parish, Clifton-on-Teme, Worcestershire, where John Cameron attended and worshipped. Old Saint Bartholomew\u2019s church at Lower Sapey is an historic building and a rare example of an almost unchanged rustic Norman church modified from time to time over the centuries. There even is mention of a priest from the church in the Domesday Book. Evidence of an even earlier church on the site has discovered at the site.\n\nSt. Bartholomew\u2019s Church is located in beautiful and remote countryside, perched on a steep bank above a stream and reached by a long winding lane. A 17th century timber-framed farmhouse is its only neighbour. The charm and interest of St Bartholomew\u2019s lie in the fact that little has changed since it was built in Norman times. It is very simple in form. The oak porch, weathered to a beautiful silvery-grey, leads to a splendid door set within a fine Norman doorway. Inside the church is simplicity itself \u2013 plain plastered walls and ceilings, a floor made of clay and gravel, and a little west gallery. Wall paintings are faintly visible on the north wall of the church, with fragments dating from the Middle Ages. Most of the fittings were transferred when a new and more convenient parish church was built in Victorian times. St Bartholomew\u2019s was neglected for more than a century after this, and was even used as a farm building. Only in the last 20 years, thanks to efforts of local people, has it been rescued from oblivion. Undoubtedly this rescue was assisted in part by John Ancrum Cameron.\n\nThe fact that John Ancrum loved this church is evident from the provision left in his will. Although Cameron served abroad most of his career, he states in his will that the money is being left to the church fund \"to mark my happy worship in Lower Sapey for over sixty years.\" He obviously felt a great attachment to the church and to the community even while he was not in England.\n\nJohn Ancrum Cameron died on the 26th of August 1996 at the age of 92 at General Hospital in Hereford [52]. He was only one hour and 40 minutes shy of his 93rd birthday when he died [53]. His residence at the time of this death was listed as 22 Buttsfield House, New Road, Bromyard, Herefordshire. This appears to be a nursing home associated with Bromyard Hospital. His cousin, Mr. John Crawford Wayland Lyon of Bockleton Forge, Bockleton, Tenbury Well, Worcestershire was the informant of his death. Cameron\u2019s death certificate lists the cause of death as:\n\nI(a). Pulmonary Embolism and\n\nI(b). Deep Vein Thrombosis. II. Diabetes Mellitus, Coronary Artery Atheroma and Osteoporatic Fractured Neck of Femur (treated).\n\nHis death was certified by Hugh G.M. Bricknell, Deputy Coroner for the County of Hereford and Worcester (Western District) after a post mortem without inquest [54].\n\nJohn Cameron\u2019s death was registered in the District of Hereford, Sub-District of Hereford, County of Hereford and Worcester on the 13th of August 1996 by J. Davies, Registrar. His will was probated on the 19th of November 1996 with his executor being Lloyds Bank PLC Regional Estates and Tax Office, Broadwalk House, Southernay, West Exeter. John Cameron apparently was a frugal man who, as a bachelor all his life, saved much of his military pay and led a simple life. At his death his estate was values at \u00a3272,918 gross, or a net amount of \u00a3270,259 after taxes [55].\n\n10. PERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nJohn Ancrum Cameron, the man, is probably best described in a tribute presented by his Godson Francis Henry Briggs at Cameron\u2019s funeral on the 3rd of September 1996.\n\n\"John Ancrum Cameron, also affectionately known as \u2018the Colonel\u2019 or \u2018Cousin John\u2019 to many of us here, was someone very special and quite unique; which is why we are here not just to mourn a much loved relative and friend, but also to celebrate his life and the pleasure and help he gave others during it.\n\nAs a Godson, I know how fortunate I was to have him as my Godfather, and many others have cause to be grateful for his life and the qualities which made him the man we knew and loved; - his intelligence; and his belief in helping with the education of the young; his care and consideration of others; his marvelous, if sometimes rather mischievous sense of humour; his modesty and also his generosity; I think shine all the more in the light of some of his experiences. Born in Kensington, the youngest of three boys, his mother died when he was three weeks old. There is no doubt (from the stories he told and what was the norm for his generation) that his upbringing was strict; and with the loss of his mother it also probably lacked something of the feminine touch. However, we do know that some of his happiest early memories were visiting his Grandmother at Upton St. Leonards and visits to his Aunt Alice at Harpley during his school holidays. The earliest recorded visit in the Harpley\u2019s visitor\u2019s book was in Spring of 1918 when he visited from Wellington College.\n\nWe know he won many prizes at Wellington and it was from there that he passed into the Elite Army Training Establishment at Woolwich, known as \u2018The Shop.\" History relates that he passed out very well, although his family at the time teasingly said that this was \u2018on account of his good handwriting.\" From Woolwich he joined the Madras Sappers & Miners, but with typical modesty and humour many of his stories of this time related to amusing things or were of practical jokes he had played on his brother officers. But he served the British Empire with loyalty and distinction both in India and North Africa, until the British withdrew from India \u2013 a country he loved and whose people he helped \u2013 many going on to successful careers. After India, he went to Malaya as a security officer. Not patrolling factories or warehouses (as we think of security officers today), but repelling guerrillas. If he had unpleasant experiences, he was not forthcoming about them. We do know that he did suffer a serious motor accident at this time whilst taking a group of Malays to church for a Good Friday service. On returning to Britain, it was understandable that he settled in Bromyard \u2013 from his happy memories of school holidays mentioned earlier, his relations in the area, and he had also celebrated his 50th birthday with them in the Falcon Hotel here. It is therefore appropriate that this is where he has come to rest after living here for nearly 40 years.\n\nWhat might also have been understandable would have been a different reaction to a changing Britain on his return from overseas. But no, he showed keen interest in new ideas and the younger generation and showed great generosity to them, without forgetting the educational standards of his own. As a Godfather, he would check on my education regularly, and at one stage this involved writing on the anniversaries of military battles, in Latin. It was only when I stumbled on the idea of replying on the anniversaries of naval engagements, in Greek, that he declared he was happy with my education so far and we reverted to a more normal means of communication. It was this sort of repartee in correspondence or conversation, which he loved and at which he excelled, often spiced with humour. He took great pleasure in introducing people to others he knew. He always had time for everyone and a pleasant word; many of us have enjoyed his hospitality and his anecdotes. It was a mercy that he could carry on (albeit in a somewhat reduced capacity) much in this way right up to the end. He had always lived simply and modestly, and I know that his last few years at Buttsfield were comfortable happy ones. He much appreciated the care he received from the staff at Buttsfield, the Bromyard Hospital, and from relatives and friends who regularly visited him. For someone so good at remembering others\u2019 birthdays, it was sad that he missed his own 93rd by 1 hour and 40 minutes. But it was fitting, that for someone who was a wonderful Godfather, and had set an example to us all by his Christian faith, who had continued to read the lesson at the Old Church, Lower Sapey for as long as he could get there in SAM 8; that he took his Bible and prayer book in to hospital with him.\n\nWhich is why we celebrate his life today; -\n\nFor all that he means to all of us here with many happy\n\nAnd fond memories of him, For all that he has meant, And for all that he always will mean to us, Amen\"\n\nThis tribute mentions the fact that Cameron was an intelligent, modest and generous man who cared very much for other peoples. He was a religious man and one who took a deep interest in young people and their proper education. He was also a practical joker with a \"marvelous and mischievous sense of humour.\" All these things are mentioned in the tribute. One trait of John Ancrum Cameron that is not mentioned is that he was a brave soldier. Because Cameron chose not to speak of his military career and adventures in great depth, his Godson did not have knowledge of his behaviour in battle as uncovered by the author in this narrative account. Cameron had no medals to show the extent of his bravery; however, historical records of the 4th Indian Division and the Indian Sappers and Miners are replete with evidence of his actions. It is hoped that this work is a tribute to the bravery of a fine soldier.\n\nADDENDUM NO. 1\n\nThe following information regarding John Ancrum Cameron was kindly provided by Dr. David Gibbins via email after finding the author's website on the Internet:\n\nDavid Gibbins was befriended by John Cameron in the mid-1970s when David was a boy living in Bromyard. They both shared a passion for King Richard III. John Cameron also fuelled David's fascination with colonial India at the time and was responsible for David's first ever pint of beer in a pub, at the age of 12!\n\nDavid indicated that Cameron lived in rather reduced circumstances in a draughty garret in the centre of town. He had many friends of all types and was a cheerful eccentric. David's maternal grandparents, Tom and Martha Verrinder, lived only a few minutes' walk from Colonel Cameron's flat and could see his window from their back patio. They were both very solicitous of his well being during his last years and Mr. Verrinder often would return from his daily walk through the town with Colonel Cameron in tow and have him in for tea and cake, which he loved. David recalls many occasions when he sat in rapt attention with the two of them in front of his grandparents' house as they reminisced about military matters. Mr. Verrinder, who had been born in 1896, also was an old soldier who had seen plenty of action on the Western Front during the Great War of 1914-1918 where he served with the 9th Lancers.\n\nDavid's grandparents are buried only a few yards from John Cameron's grave. His headstone is beautifully embellished with the crest of the Madras Sappers and Miners and his military rank is included on the headstone.\n\nADDENDUM NO. 2\n\nThe following are Colonel Cameron's notes for a lecture give at a social meeting some years after his return to the United Kingdom after serving 31 years abroad. In these notes he discusses his 8-month sojourn to various parts of the world. These notes were provided to the author by John C.W. Lyon in August 2004.\n\nMrs. Bertie-Roberts, Mrs. Hills, Ladies and Gentlemen -The Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports died in Walmer Castle on September 14th 1852 and the picture inspired by his death provides the title for this talk; for on September 28th 1956 I did my last day's work ever, and the next morning I started back to the United Kingdom after 31 years Eastern Service.\n\nMichaelmas morning, ladies and gentlemen, and rather fun. Work behind me for evermore and all the lazy man's happy dreams of lifelong leisure; a day in a million; I wish I could convey to you my supreme contentment, almost my smugness as I left Kuala Lumpur Parish Church that Michaelmas morning and turned NOT right to the operations room but symbolically the opposite way, to Serembau, Singapore, Borneo, South India, Central Africa, The Canary Islands, and Home.\n\nThere is much I could tell you about Borneo, indeed there is much I would love to tell you about all the places I visited and the people I met in the 8 months of my slow journey home but I must limit myself to the highlights and in Borneo. I reckon the highlight was BRUNEI with its water village, the houses all on stilts, not just shacks but complete houses, with doors and windows that open and shut, easy chairs, pictures on the walls, birds in cages and pots of flowers hanging round the verandahs like the gardens of Babylon. There is no approach to these houses save by that; I toured the streets so to speak in a pinnace, and I happened to be outside the school when classes stopped at 1.15; the little Malay boys scampered out and each paddled off home in his own sampan like landbased boys ride off on their bicycles.\n\nBack in Singapore, a friend just out of gaol asked me to lunch with him in the restaurant at the top of the newly-finished 16-storey Asia Insurance Building. As we lunched we wondered vaguely why people kept on going to the balconies and looking down and in the end we joined them and saw that the riots were taking place below. As a soldier, I have twice been at the receiving end of abuse and brickbats so this time it was nice to have a ringside seat and to notice how well the police were doing - the brickbat correctly caught on the wicker shield and the thrower smartly tapped with the baton. However the riots only lasted a few days and soon I was driving happily back to Malaya and up the East Coast. Let me tell you the difference between the East Coast and the West Coast; the West Coast is mostly mangrove swamp and modern civilisation, and is much visited and well travelled over, the East Coast is the beachcomber's paradise and is one long golden sandy shore lying between a Mediterranean blue sea and a belt of green coconut palms with pleasant little Malay kampongs at rare intervals; it is NOT, as it is sometimes mistakenly called, the real Malaya but it is quite delightfully the Malay Malaya.\n\nOn the East Coast therefore and not on the sophisticated West is the Beach of Passionate Love which 8 years ago when I first went there was extraordinarily well run by the rightful Sultan of Patani; but he died and it was taken over first by a drunken Hungarian pianist and secondly by a White Russian widow and with each change of ownership it slipped a little and then the monsoon took a hand and half of it slipped literally into the sea, and now it's rather forlorn but they do their best and still give you curried prawn omelets for breakfast and amusing things happen there , for instance a silver-tongued Malay spent a week impersonating me and being entertained by the sort of people who would be likely to entertain me; later I had to help him into an East Coast prison from where he wrote and asked me to meet him and take him home when he came out. I did so, and as his home was a long way away we stayed the night at a Rest House. Entering his Occupation in the book he wrote \"Agriculture\", and I suppose I looked mildly inquiring because he said \"I been digging the prison garden\". Well, yes, I too thought this awfully funny 'til I saw the signature of a genuine agricultural officer 3 lines higher up, so we spent a rather desperate evening staving off a genuine agricultural conversation.\n\nWhy I tell you all this is to show you that life on the East Coast is still happily carefree and unorganised.\n\nOne of the East Coast States is Trengganu and I stayed in its capital with a Malay Vet. The visit included Armistice Day, and on that day all the pigeon orchids flowered. A pigeon orchid is a miniature white orchid which resembles a very small pigeon in flight; about once a year all the pigeon orchids in the same area come out on the same day and for that only day only. I have seen them on 3 occasions - Armistice Day in Kuala Trengganu, the day of a big wedding in Seremban when the bride drove through an avenue of them to Church; and rather charmingly in Singapore on the Saints Day in 1949 on which the present Bishop of Singapore was being consecrated in London.\n\nWhile on the subject of flowers, there is a very beautiful flower in Malaya which unfolds white in the morning and by evening has turned red: high-spirited hostesses pluck this flower on the mornings of their dinner-parties, and keep it all day in their refrigerator so that it stays white; they decorate their dinner table with it, and with the soup they draw some unsuspecting guest's attention it its pure white texture. \"Yes indeed\" says he \"whiter than any lily\". Wine is then served, and with the warmth of the room the flower begins to do its stuff, and with the savoury the guest's attention is again carelessly drawn to the flowers he earlier said looked whiter than any lily and his reaction is noted.\n\nI made my way back into Central Malaya and revisited old friends and old haunts in Pahang. I once went up the River KECHAU to PETOLA, in a prahu from the main stream six days from the nearest town, which incidentally was where we once caught a mermaid on Christmas Day; sometimes we negotiated rapids and sometimes we got out and pushed and sometimes we got out and carried and twice we hauled our craft up a stone incline built by Sir Hugh Clifford last century and sometimes we just chugged but always we had our guns loaded and ready to shoot and finally we reached PETOLA and did our business and were fetched 2 days later by helicopter. The children of Petola have never seen a train or a motorcar or a bicycle or even a horse and carriage, they know only 2 forms of transport, the boat and the helicopter.\n\nHowever, that has been a digression so now I must jump to Christmas in Kuala Lumpur where I went to a pantomime - Cinderella, and the Chinese youth who played the part of Buttons had a wonderful singing voice and in private life was a High Court Interpreter, doing 12 months for perjury; you see it was a Prison Pantomime and all the actors were serving sentences. Sitting next to me was an Indonesian who had only just ceased to be eligible to take 4. part and as each player came on he whispered biographical details. Cinderella, boy dressed as girl, was slim, handsome, almost ethereal looking and I couldn't believe she - or he - was an inmate until my neighbour said quietly \"Armed Robbery 3 years\".\n\nKLUANG- I went to see the New Year in the Sergts. Mess of the Malayan Sapper Regiment I helped to raise; before that there was a cocktail party in the Officers Mess and as I knew every member of both Messes personally and had known some my whole time in Malaya a good evening was had by all.\n\nI left KLUANG on New Year's Day and drove back up the Coast Road to Malacca, the same Coast Road I had driven down 18 months earlier on the night called TUJON LIKO the 3rd day before the big Muslim Feast of Hari Raya Puasa, as it were shall we say on Maundy Thursday. The road has a Malay house set back among the trees every 100 yards for 60 miles and on this one night in the year the paths leading up to each house are bright with little oil lamp-like nightlights: the belief is that an angel will come down that night from Heaven and will grant a wish to everyone he meets; the lights show the angel the way to your house.\n\nI can't describe to you how lovely that night of TUJON LIKO was and what an impression it made on me; it was like driving through Fairyland.\n\nI spent a night in Malacca. I loved Malacca, I used to go there as often as I could, generally staying with a retired policeman who lived among the coconut palms on the shore outside the town. I could dream about Malacca to you for days, it is the only place in Malaya with any real history and it has an atmosphere you find nowhere else. I had a clerk who came from Malacca, called Rashid Omar; he replaced a chap who had gone temporarily but not very honourably to prison and he used to travel to and from the office on rather a sparkling motor-bike; one morning I noticed it wasn't there nor Rashid either and I asked who not? \"Tuan\" I was told \"Rashid had an accident and broke his leg and is in the hospital\". \"I am sorry\" I said \"how frightful, I'll go and see him this afternoon\". \"No need, Tuan\" was the reply \"he'll be back here by then\". I said \"he can't be, with a broken leg\". \"Tuan\" was the devastating answer \"one of his legs is a wooden one and that's the one he's broken\".\n\nLastly Penang, correctly Prince of Wales's Island. I had embarked at Port Swettenham on Sunday January 6th and we called at Penang next morning. But on January 1st Her Majesty The Queen had raised George Town the island's capital to City status and 48 hours later the riots were in full swing: a curfew was imposed and order was being restored but the place looked uneasy. My father served in Penang some 70 years ago and loved it and was always so happy there and so have I been on my occasional visits; so it was sad to say \"goodbye Malaya\" to a Penang gaily decorated, festoons of colours along the roads, crests and coats of arms and loyal mottoes on all the big buildings, flags flying and flowers and illuminations everywhere, but the streets deserted except for security force patrols and a few people hurrying home to beat the curfew.\n\nRevisiting India brings up very forcibly the question \"Is it a mistake to go back?\" And I reckon the answer is YES, unless you have as many people to see and as many places to go to as I did end you whiz round so quickly that you leave no time for nostalgia. Sunday evening is the trouble, not the Sunday you go to a strange Church but the Sunday you go to the Church just outside the lines, where the front pew still bears the plate \"Royal Engineers\" though the last Royal Engineer left 10 years ago and there are no more to come. But by tradition the senior R.E. officer attending Evensong reads the Lessons, and when I revealed myself to the Chaplain he asked me to revive the tradition - on that one Sunday night in 10 years, probably the last Sunday, ever.\n\nI could see nothing wrong with the Army, I reckon they have about as high a reputation as they did when we left them. Nor with the Posts and Telegraphs who have faced up to corruption boldly; above every Post Office letter box is a large notice in English \"Do not put air letters with adhesive stamps in this box. Take them inside and see them postmarked in your presence\". In a place the size of Worcester a special clerk would do this and nothing else, holding your letters up afterwards so that you can see that the stamps are no longer worth licking off: in smaller places the Postmaster often invites you in and gives you a chair and a cigarette and perhaps a cup of coffee, and calls a clerk to postmark your letters while you sit and natter. I found 6. Postmasters invariably friendly and in MADURA they were holding Postal Courtesy week and the office and verandah were gay with coloured streamers; a willing guide came forward to take me round and show me the path of my letter from pillarbox to mailbag.\n\nI went around lots of places in South India seeing old friends and familiar scenes and stayed a week in COORG and walked into the Fort in MERCARA and across its Bloody Tennis Court, laid out between the Rajah's Balcony and the Main Gate; prisoners to whom His Highness wished to show clemency were allowed to run across the tennis court while he shot at them from the balcony; if they reached the Gate alive they were free to leave but if not - well that's how the tennis court got its name.\n\nThen down to the West Coast and its languorous backwaters where 40 years ago a short leave used to be so lovely; and even only 20 years ago I spent a Christmas morning drinking champagne with M. 1'Administratem of the French territory MAHE; he was a dear and so was his successor whom I stayed a night with at the end of the war. I noticed he had no radio and I knew there was no local paper in French and he spoke no English so I asked him he learned of great events; he explained \"I can read simple English words in capital letters so I take in the Madras Mail and spell out the headlines; if it sounds exciting I take the whole paper down to the Postmaster who understands English and translated it to me\".\n\nI revisited CAPE COMORIN where you can watch the sun rise and set in the sea; indeed I could talk about South India to you all night but I'm going to limit myself to reeling off a few place names and if any listener has a particular interest in some place I went to and would like to hear more I'll be delighted to tell all I know when this Talk is over. The places I went to, in addition to those I've already mentioned, are:-MADRES - WANDIWASH - PONDICHERRY - VELLORE - BANGALORE - SERINGAPATAM - MYSORE - VIRAJPET - POLLIBETTA - SULTAN'S BATTERY - OOTY and THE NILGIRIS - MADURA - TINNEVELLY - NAGERCOIL - TRIVANDRUM and a Tea Estate at KALLAR BRIDGE - POONA - KIRKEE - BOMBAY, and in PAKISTAN a day in KIAMARI and KARACHI.\n\nTwo incidents stand out in my memory, from Bangalore, the first one made me feel my age, the 2nd one was just nostalgic. My first tour in India we used to play hockey against a local team 7. called the Bangalore Indians whose centre half was a young law student called Kosal Ram, a nice lad and a first-class hockey player. I went away and he went away and we met again this year when he came to tea with me for auld lang syne; I suppose it was stupid of me still to think of him as the active young law student of the twenties, for he walked in greyheaded and venerable - he's now a Retired Judge.\n\nThe second incident took me back to the birth on February 17th 1938 of a son to the wife of one of my best n.c.o's, February 17th is the anniversary of the Battle of Meeanee and as the Company we were both then in had played a notable part in that battle we laughingly called the boy Meeaneesami. In February of this year the father now a pensioner, came to see me and as you will have guessed brought with him Meeaneesami, 19 years old and a freshman at a University and we had an affecting re-union; but what neither you nor I could have guessed was that the father carried a brown paper parcel and unwrapped it and showed me, carefully laundered and folded, the little shirt and shorts in our company colours which I had had made for Meeaneesami then aged 2 when I left for the war in 1940.\n\nIncidentally, it was this boy's father who won my best garden prize in a never-to-be-forgotten competition over 25 years ago. Each recruit squad had its strip of garden outside its barrack block and I offered a prize for the best garden on a certain Sunday morning some weeks ahead when I would come and judge. Well, some squads were keen and some were idle but Judgment Day came round and one hitherto idle garden was seen to be a blaze of flowers - quite genuine flowers and truly growing and not merely wired onto wooden stalks. So Meeaneesami's father and his squad got my prize though I gave it with some misgivings, to be fully justified next morning when both the C. of E. and the R.C. chaplains lined up outside my office to complain of wholesale depredations from both their cemeteries and a pack of my recruits suspected.\n\nMy only other Tiger Story deals with my passage through the Customs when I left Bombay; in my 2 days there I had been particularly well looked after by a former Madras Sapper n.c.o. now a traveller for cement, and as we approached what was clearly going to be a very stiff Customs examination he said \"Stick by me. Sahib, stick by me; don't let anyone, ANYONE, take you away\". Well, sure enough all sorts of junior and senior officials, seeing my white face, rolled up and offered their services to be quite clearly at a price, but I stuck by my pal and finally we reached the counter he had been making for and I was introduced to the examiner \"you remember Cameron Sahib who used to play hockey for 10 Company?\" and we were off reminiscing and I was so nice and agreeable and after exchanging old friend news he apologized and said \"well look, you won't mind my just chalking your bags and sending you on your way will you? And do come back to India and see us again\". It was only when I later heard my fellow-passengers saying to each other \"You got away with 20 rupees; I had to give that to the head man alone\" that I realized what a dividend the hockey matches of a quarter of a century ago were now paying.\n\nWe were only a few hours in Pakistan; the Pakistanis were smiling and courteous and friendly but Karachi looks a bit ravished and in need of a coat of paint; Keamari its harbour has expanded out of all recognition since I was stationed in SIND 22 years ago.\n\nFrom Karachi we sailed down the Indian Ocean, bumped gently over the Equator, and put in at Mombasa where we spent 3 days swimming and sightseeing.\n\nI liked Mombasa but even more I liked Zanzibar which bore a nostalgic resemblance to my much-loved Malacca. Zanzibar Cathedral is most impressive with its clock which keeps Islamic time (as do all the Zanzibar public clocks except the Post Office) as a tribute to His Highness the Sultan who gave it - gave it? or should we say donated it? I called on H.H. and was accorded a courteous bow and a charming smile, and an Arabic greeting; he is a GOOD Ruler, much loved by his subjects.\n\nThere are many Livingstone relics including his house and the room where his body lay after its 1000-mile journey from Lake Tanganyika; the streets of Zanzibar are narrow and fascinating, reminding me occasionally of Kirkwall and Stromness in Orkney; and twice I drove with friends through the clove orchards to bathe in clear sea off sandy beaches.\n\nIf I have left my heart in Malaya I fancy it has engraved on it MALACCA; if I had lived long in Africa I feel the word would be ZANZIBAR; of the 7 African territories I went to I liked Zanzibar the best, and a close runner-up would be Tanganyika whose old German capital DAR-ES-SALAAM we fly to now.\n\nThe best thing about Dar-es-Salaam is its pleasant sounding name, the next best its picturesque harbour approach. The old German Government House now the British Govt. house is large and imposing but no other building impressed me except the old German railway station; the roads all seem to have been laid out at right angles, the name of the principal street is ACACIA AVENUE. Well, I ask you.\n\nFrom Dar-es-Salaam I went by bus to MOSHI near Mt. Kilimanjaro, in fact I crossed the whole of British East Africa by bus, from the Coast to the Belgian border, over 1500 miles for under 10 guineas. I know no African language but no men could have been kinder or more helpful than the three members of that Tanganyika bus crew none of whom spoke any English. They drove me right up to the places they thought I ought to eat at, a Greek restaurant for lunch, an Indian cafe for tea, and a slap-up European hotel for dinner, and in between they bought me bananas. At 3 a.m. we reached my destination, the Livingstone Hotel in MOSHI, the driver leaped out and carried my bags in, woke up all 3 night watchmen, explained who I was, and waved a smiling goodbye. The watchmen were all over me too: it seemed no room had been specifically reserved so they gave me halfadozen keys and said \"Choose which room you like best, Bwana,\" which I did and chose lucky for 3 hours later I woke to see from my window MT. KILIMANJARO free of cloud and in all its snow-covered glory. It is an unforgettable sight, even after only a short 2-day stay it made an immense impression on me, I'm not surprised to learn that it \"gets\" you completely if you live and work beneath it.\n\nNext day I crossed into Kenya and I'm not talking much about Kenya because you've already heard of the adventures there of Karina Smalley and Pauline Peacock both nees Lyon; but I don't suppose those adventures included a night with an alarmingly tough Brigadier at Thomson's Falls 7700 ft. up, 7700 mark you, and he had no electric heating and used his fireplaces solely to keep his radio batteries in.\n\nAlso I enjoyed visiting a Nanyuki hotel where a silver line is let diagonally into the top of the bar and marks the Equator. Also the happily-named Equator railway station also crossed by the Equator where I witnessed the affectionate meeting of a husband and wife across the hemispheres. This railway station has a Post Office where your letters will be postmarked rather majestically EQUATOR KENYA. Also RUMURUTI where a Captain CARR HARTLEY has a license to capture and keep live animals and subsequently sell them to the world's zoos. I'm told my views on Kenya's game reserves are sheer heresy but I had the wretched beasts and their parks so dinned into me as a MUST that I jibbed at visiting all except one which my kind hostess drove me into near Nairobi and we were sniffed at close-at-hand by a hungry-looking Lioness with a gleam in her eye. At RUMURUTI without effort I saw lion -leopard - cheetah - hippo - giraffe - baboon - chimpanzee - ostrich -warthog - hartebeeste - hyena - vulture - snake - secretary bird -crowned crane - and Thomson's gazelle but NOT the rhinoceros who was stated to be out for a walk.\n\nEaster I spent in Kampala, Easter Monday I set off for the Congo teaming up with an American Colonel. We stopped 2 days in the glorious scenery of KABALE and left next morning in a wholly African bus for RUANDA: our fellow travellers were African Protestant schoolchildren going home for the holidays and they sang melodiously and in harmony the better known English Protestant hymns. Uganda isn't Arkansas but eyebrows were nevertheless slightly raised at 30 young blacks and 2 elderly whites singing as they journeyed Jerusalem the Golden.\n\nOnce across the Belgian border the cost of living rockets; no more buses at a penny a mile, from the frontier to LAKE KIVU it was a shilling a mile for each of us and we both agreed that the happy laughing singing companionship of our East African bus-travellers had been very poorly replaced by the stately and expensive company of each other. However just around LAKE KIVU I didn't frightfully grudge this for the scenery really was magnificent and that night we saw 3 active volcanoes glowing and spouting round our hotel.\n\nWhatever Belgian advertisements and propaganda may say I personally reckon they do NOT want tourists unless such tourists are so rich that they bring their own cars or will hire the local ones, or so rushed that they go everywhere by air. I am quite sure that they don't want the mooch-along poor-white type of tourist like me; but that isn't to say that individual Belgians didn't welcome me for they most certainly did, and I received great kindness at the hands of all I met and generous hospitality, but it's not a country for a man without a well stocked wallet.\n\nI went by slow steamer down Lake Kivu, stayed a night in Bukavu and next day boarded the Lake Tanganyika steamer at its Congo port of KALUNDI from where it was 2 hours to USUMBURA on the eastern shore and where my American colleague left me to return to Kenya. He was replaced by 2 tali Missionaries.\n\nAll that night and next morning we steamed slowly down Lake Tanganyika, second deepest lake in the world, the deepest being Lake Baikal, and I improved my French talking to the 2 missionaries who spoke it carefully and clearly. The Lake is narrow, you can see both shores at once, craggy and inhospitable they look from a distance but are surprisingly green close to, even though no-one lives there.\n\nWe spent a still hot Saturday afternoon at Kigoma, the sad little Belgian-built terminus of the old German railway from Dar-es-Salaam and here I had a memorable adventure: I accidentally came across a sophisticated young mulatto from the French colony of Reunion and an elderly Indian engine-driver waiting to take the night Mail to the Coast. We sat round a rickety bamboo table on the verandah of Kigoma's lonely one-horse hotel and we talked and we drank cold beer and I felt myself developing more and more into a Somerset Maugham story and wondering if I should come to the same inconclusive end. No-one except the last waiter came near us and the sun began to set over the Lake and the steamer hooted and I had to go. Many memories of my journey home will fade but not that one - the Lake and the sunshine and the stillness and the mulatto and the engine-driver and the beer and the sad-looking waiter and the tumbledown verandah on that hot Saturday afternoon by the shore of Lake Tanganyika.\n\nNext morning we berthed at Albertville and I said goodbye to the missionaries; did I hear one of them say something to the other in English? I asked \"Vous parley anglais mon cure?\" \"Yes SIR\" said he \"we are Americans\".\n\nFrom Albertville one takes the train to Elisabethville, chief town of the Southern Congo including the copper area; the journey lasts 48 hours, you cross the wide and swampy and quite unromantic Congo River on a bridge, built last year and all except the last 4 hours of your journey which are on a different railway system are spent - shades of Stanley and Livingstone and my Naval name-sake; - in an airconditioned wagon-lit;\n\nThe Southern and Western Congo country is interesting but no where spectacular: I enjoyed my 2 days in the wagon-lit and my following 4 days in EVILLE where I was introduced to two Clubs one Royal and sedate, the other openair swimming and very modern; but I hadn't crossed 3/4 of Africa to linger in a town and on the Saturday I set off for Portuguese West properly called Angola. You know as soon as you've crossed the frontier because your bill for lunch looks like it was just for elevenses, the Portuguese prices are some 30 to 40 below the Belgian. And I thought the Benguela Railway one of the best I had travelled on, with its comfortable carriages and admirable restaurant car and its sensational descent the last morning from 5000 ft. a.s.l. to 0 - it is the only railway where I have been able to take a photograph of my own engine going round a hairpin bend ahead of my compartment.\n\nWhy did I go to Angola? Heredity I suppose for my great grandfather commanded a Portuguese Division in the Peninsular War and held a high opinion of the Portuguese as fighting soldiers when competently led. Twice in India I visited GOA and the memories of my days there are among my happiest. Do I speak Portuguese? No, but on the West of India Portuguese Railway I was intrigued by the notices describing the Gentlemen's Waiting Rooms - \"Salla da espera para caballeros\" or literally \"Hall of hope for Cavaliers\".\n\nTime is running short now and I won't say more about Teneriffe in the Canary Islands where I broke journey for a week than that the banks of wild geraniums which border the roads in the north of the island are too lovely, and the Peak is of course as impressive as, well, as all high and lonely mountains are. Prices were extraordinarily low and I paid only 23/- a day for a room with a magnificent view over the harbour and running h and c in it and full Spanish board: BUT, there(s always a BUT, it was a shilling a time each bath, hot cold or shower. It's a good island Teneriffe and I was sorry when my week was up. I took ship again, this time to Belgium where I did 4 days rather intensive sightseeing, Antwerp and Namur and the Castles of the Meuse and Brussels and a battlefield which a very irritating guide would continually refer to as Mt. Singeon while I cried firmly \"Waterloo only, Waterloo only\". Then on Thursday June 6th, 5 months to the day after I had embarked in Malaya, I caught a plane from Brussels and a train from Paddington and in the evening reached Lacock Halt where my godfather aged 76 and my godson, his grandson aged 2 were standing rather sweetly hand in hand on the platform to greet me.\n\nADDENDUM NO. 3\n\nThe following are Colonel Cameron's notes for a lecture give at a social meeting some years after his return from India. In these notes Cameron makes reference to a number of photographs, which unfortunately were not available to the author. These notes were provided to the author by John C.W. Lyon in August 2004.\n\nExactly a year ago, and 2 days after I was invited to give this talk, the BBC put out an almost unbearably nostalgic program called The India We Loved. A number of speakers, men AND women, harked back 40 and 50 and 60 years to their Indian days and one among them, now a widow, spoke of her happy memories of what used to be called The Abandoned Women's Camp on the North West Frontier. Its official name was The Families Camp for the dependants of Officers serving in non-Family Frontier Stations and it reflected a pattern of life which was so familiar then but which is virtually unknown now; the husbands across the border in the men-only frontier forts, and their wives behind them at railhead in a settlement of self contained little chalets with communal lounging and messing.\n\nHere, in February 1930, I spent 10 days as one of a number of officers from the various frontier outposts down in Bannu for the Waziristan District Sports. There were chalets to spare and we were all accommodated in them.\n\nSo we start in Bannu on the North West Frontier reached by the narrow-gauge railway from the western bank of the Indus, and here I best say straight out that by India in this talk I shall mean the old India ignoring subsequent partition and Pakistan.\n\nAnyway, railways in India were fascinating and the carriages extremely comfortable and if you liked you could spend all day in bed because that's what you had - a bed, bunk, or couch, not just a seat, in a compartment holding 2 or 4, and on the broad gauge an armchair also. Your journey might last several days, there were no corridors and each compartment had its own bathroom attached - but only cold water, no hot, and for washing your bearer took your basin to the engine-driver who filled it from a tap on the boiler.\n\nAt meal-times the train stopped and you walked along the platform to the Restaurant Car or else to the Refreshment Room on the station where the train halted long enough for you to eat the meal the Guard had wired ahead for you. On the really snob trains like the Frontier Mail between Bombay and Peshawar you were expected to dress for dinner in the Restaurant Car and most people did.\n\nOne never travelled in India without one's bearer, one's ever faithful bearer, mine was called ALWAR and he was with me for 18\u00bd years out of my 20.\n\nA list of Indian servants always seems good for a laugh; here is mine:-\n\nmy bearer - he was the head man, the major-domo, the complete Jeeves or valet who also waited at table in the Mess and accompanied one everywhere including active service as late as 1941. When I joined in 1926, some bearers had more medals than any officer except the Colonel; the senior bearer had been up the Malakand with the Field Force of 1897.\n\nthe chokra - he assisted one's bearer, was in effect a trainee.\n\nsyces or grooms - each pony had its own syce whose sole care was his pony - we come on to ponies later.\n\nthe dogboy - each dog had its dogboy, responsible for your dog when not with you; for example when you were on a Ceremonial Parade or on furlo in England. If you were away for any length of time the dogboy went off and lived with whoever was looking after the dog.\n\nThese were the wholly personal servants; then there were those the batchelor shared with the other officers in the bungalow:\n\nthe dhobi or washerman - as his name implied, he did one's washing, as much or as little as you liked to give him at the fixed contract rate of 12/- a month. How I wish I could persuade the Bartestree Convent Laundry to do the same.\n\nchowkidar or nightwatchman - he lived on a string bed and mostly slept on it, but if you didn't employ a chowkidar you were liable to be burgled; we didn't then know the expression but I suppose he'd now be called a protection racket. the sweeper - cleaned up the bathrooms and back premises and lastly the mali or gardener - 4/6d a month was generally my share for him and for this he kept the compound tidy and chased away the snakes.\n\nModern progressives are outspoken in their condemnation of one British Officer having all these Indian servants; that is because they do not understand that basically the reason was economic, helped by the iron divisions of caste.\n\nThe branch of a Bank in Madras about the same size as Lloyds in Worcester employed 200 clerks, each working 3 hours a day; the Bank proposed to reduce to one hundred each to work 6 hours a day, for double the pay. The Government urged them not to, saying \"200 men at a living wage means 200 families adequately fed; but 100 men at double the pay means these 100 families with more than they need, and the other 100 families starving\". That was the economic reason; the other was the caste system -\n\na man was born a syce or a sweeper or a dhobi, he wanted no other work he would do no other work he could do no other work;\n\nbut who are we to deride when a car factory stops work because 2 unions can't decide which shall tighten 4 screws on a dashboard?\n\nPerhaps the greatest quality of our Indian servants was their faithfulness, their devotion to their master and his interests. One monsoon day I was away from Fort Sandeman when a freak storm took off half the roof of my bungalow and the rain poured in. An officer who knew I was away hurried up the hill, met my bearer who had been injured by flying debris and asked could he help? \"No, Sahib\" said Alwar, \"I got everything safe in the back room except the Government furniture and master's unpaid bills which are still out in the rain.\"\n\nSometimes for remembering something I tied the usual knot in my handkerchief. I changed for Mess in the evening and threw my clothes aside as I went into my bath; when I put on clean clothes, there was a new knot tied by Alwar in my clean handkerchief.\n\nNext to one's bearer were one's syces and this leads me on to horses or rather to ponies, for all horses in India were ponies except one's 2 official parade ponies which were chargers. As a subaltern I had 2 chargers, a buggy pony and a pony to hunt on; but don't picture me overpaid, the first 2 were subsidized and the last 2 didn't belong to me, they belonged to the Government of India and were hired to me whenever I wanted them for 11/3d each a month. One lived on one's pony or driving it, the horse was everything a subaltern couldn't own a motorcar till he owned 2 ponies.\n\nThompson, he's now over 70 but 50 years ago he bought a motorbicycle and the first day that he rode it up to the Mess it caused a stampede; dogs barked, ponies bolted, syces shouted, and officers swore. Thereafter the Colonel forbade it to be heard in the compound so Thompson had to freewheel the slight slope from the road down to the Mess and after lunch his bearer pushed it up again.\n\nNext to horses came dogs. We all owned dogs, they followed us most places including Evensong when the dog sat with the syce in the buggy. Over my 20 years I had 7 dogs; some my own, others I looked after, for instance I had KIM for 2 years while his owner was at the Staff College Camberley; here are Kim and me in the snow in RAZMAK on Christmas morning 1929. Phoebe was my last dog, she was a dear, a countrybred Corgi. She was with me my last 2 years and when I left she went to a good home with the chap on the left of the picture. And here, just, is TRIXIE, not my dog but poor Trixie, she grew old and suffered and Bassett, her owner, decided she must be put to sleep, but how? Shooting was too coldblooded and poison was unthinkable so he decided on chloroform. He and Conran dug a trench in a corner of the Mess compound. Trixie was to be chloroformed in the trench one Sunday morning and when she was dead they would fill in the earth on top. So at breakfast everyone said a silent goodbye to Trixie and left the 3 of them together. We gathered again in the Mess before luncheon. Trixie came frisking up to us and suddenly someone said \"Good Heavens, isn't that dog supposed to be dead?\" We trooped out to the trench and found Bassett and Conran unconscious with the overturned bottle of chloroform between them.\n\nEarlier I mentioned Evensong. In that far-off India one never carried money; everything was on the chit system and that included the offertory - in all the pews were Club barchits. You filled one in and signed it and dropped it in the bag and it was debited in your next Club bill. You never paid a taxidriver, he collected his fare from the Mess Office and the amount appeared in your Mess bill. Similarly you never paid cash in a cinema. You signed a chit and this item too appeared in your Mess bill. The cinema seats were either sofas or extremely comfortably upholstered armchairs. If the film was dull you dropped off to sleep. Sam Graham did this regularly, was furious if we didn't wake him at the end to stand up for God Save The King-Emperor.\n\nTowards the end of the war the chit system got abused and some taxidrivers and shopkeepers started asking for cash, but we thought it rather a tribute to our Regimental honesty that if you were a Madras Sapper your word was still accepted.\n\nUp till 1933 we used to draw our monthly pay in jingling cash over the Adjutant's office table, and outside on the verandah waited my bearer Alwar and my banker Hydan Ramchand; first Alwar presented his bill and I paid it: then Hydan Ramchand got the rest for the credit of my account. Hydan was a grand chap to those who played fair by him. I started my account with him in 1926 and closed it when I left India 20 years later; I met him again in 1957 and said \"I believe I've still got my old cheque-book with a few unused cheque forms left in it.\" \"Sahib\" he replied \"if ever you need to draw one I will honour it at any time and for any amount.\"\n\nShooting was a great interest in earlier days, see these trophies on the Mess walls; but when motorcars came to India and later aeroplanes we began to take our leave further afield and I remember no-one spending their whole 61 or 91 days leave in the jungle after about 1929. I was never much of a shikari myself though I enjoyed a morning after the snipe. Sometimes shikar had its tragic side; let me read you an account that Harry Prendergast who won a VC in the Mutiny wrote when he was our Colonel in 1869, exactly 100 years ago :-\n\nIt's interesting, isn't it, that 100 years ago one went shooting\n\nin shirtcuffs starched so stiff that a dying man could write a message on them.\n\nGolf we played, especially on the lovely course at Ootacamund in The Nilgiris, 7000 ft. above sea level. It was wonderful air, wonderful exercise, wonderful relaxation. On one leave in 1933 I played 36 holes a day, except the Sunday which was Church - 18 the morning, and 18 in the afternoon; on our last day we played 18 morning, 18 afternoon, 9 after tea, total 45 - the most I've ever played on any one day before or since. The Ooty golf course was 4 miles from the town and generally you could get a lift home; but one day in 1927, my first time there, I got no lift and started to walk and saw outside a house a board \"Earl of Shannon\". Ah! a pub, and hot and thirsty I went in and asked for a beer and a man brought it out to me on the lawn. Later a woman joined us and the man said to me \"I'm afraid I didn't gather your name but let me introduce you to my wife. Lady Shannon.\"\n\nI've hardly mentioned the troops themselves but they were magnificent; may I quote Lord Wolseley sometime Commander-in-Chief: and Lord Roberts V.C., Commander-in-Chief also:-\n\nDoes it interest you to know that over half a century later the Army was still maintaining Lord Roberts' house at Sukkur on the Indus Barrage? This is it and I was the chap looking after it.\n\nI reckon we were particularly lucky in the Madras Sappers in that our Headquarters were at Bangalore in the south and our Field Units up on the Frontier or elsewhere; thus we saw more of India than most soldiers. I served in a total of 11 stations, many other places I went to and could still give you a Cook's tour of two I'd like to tell you about.\n\nTRANQUEBAR - who now remembers that for over 200 years the Danes had trading and mission stations in India? Tranquebar was their last, they left in 1843; I went there first in 1931 and stayed in the Travellers' Bungalow, formerly the Fort, and still bearing the inscription\n\nTHE DANSBORG\n\nBUILT BY OVE GEDDE, COMMANDER ROYAL DANISH NAVY\n\n1620\n\nThe town was bordered on 3 sides by fortifications and on the 4th by the sea, and one dear old Danish lady still lived there, daughter of the last Pastor of the Lutheran Mission which had struggled on after the 1843 cession. But it closed when her parents died. She had never been to Denmark, knew no home but Tranquebar, and lived on there till she herself died in 1943 exactly 100 years after the Cession of 1843.\n\nQuite a different place was D.G.K. or in full DERA GHAZI KHAN commonly but quite wrongly reputed to be the Punjab Penal Station for Civil Servants who had put up a black on the lines of the Outer Hebrides for Murdock and Guyler. I stayed a night there once, arrived at 2 p.m. in a temperature of 123\u00b0 in the shade and no shade. I went thankfully to bed In the Travellers Bungalow. Alwar was to wake me with tea at 6 and produce dinner at 8. But while I slept the Judge spotted a strange car, interviewed Alwar, and left a message that I was to come over and dine with him. Sure enough all the officials of the station were there too: Judge - Collector - Policeman - Doctor - Engineer - Ferrymaster - and we had a merry evening, all saying what pleasure it gave them to welcome a visitor to D.G.K. That, actually, was typical of Indian hospitality.\n\nI said that D.G.K. was 123\u00b0 in the shade and no shade, but the hottest place of all was TANK, I've been there and I know. It used to be said that the Devil built Tank and then preferred to go and live in Hell.\n\nI've also mentioned Fort Sandeman, a grand place where I lived 1934-35 and for a time was Station Staff Officer. We had a time-gun, a saluting cannon, which the S.S.O. fired at noon to tell everyone the time - this was before India had the radio; an n.c.o. collected the right time each morning from the Telegraph Office and gave it to the Chief Clerk who got the gun ready. At noon I fired it: here I am doing it.\n\nNow for a few snippets to end with. Queen Victoria assumed the Title of Empress of India in 1858 and declared Thursday to be a holiday for the Army in India thenceforth and for ever. It was known as \"Queen Victoria's Holiday\". Hounds met on Thursdays, or one could go off shooting or fishing, or hack around cantonments, or play squash before breakfast, but NOT lie in bed. Hockey was mostly my game. I suppose my happiest hockey day was when my Company won both our coveted tournaments in the same year, the only Company ever to do so.\n\nSunday was one of our more active days, here is a typical one:-\n\nEarly tea at 4.30 (Alwar never missed) and the Colonel would call for us in his car at 5.15 and take us to the Meet. He was always punctual, neither stopped nor slowed, he just drove through the compound and you scrambled in as he passed. Scent gave out at 9.30 or 10 and back we came to breakfast. Cricket began at 1.30, compulsory for subalterns, I once argued I wasn't good enough, was promptly elected Captain.\n\nStumps were drawn at 5.30, bath, change into dark suit. Evensong in the Garrison Church, then to the Club for oysters prewar 9\u00bdd a dozen, postwar lO\u00bdd, home to supper in Mess around 9.30 and healthily and sleepily to bed soonest afterwards.\n\nI mentioned motor-cars, then owned by Field Officers only; here is the first one ever in Bangalore, the Colonel driving it. And here is a mule four-in-hand with its owner Major Agnew who designed the seat to be specially high so that in accidents the passengers would be thrown clear; it must have worked, for Mrs. Agnew is still alive, I had tea with her in Roxburghshire this summer.\n\nWell, my 20 years in India came to an end and you won't be surprised to hear that I felt most weepy when I said goodbye to Alwar and to Phoebe. Phoebe, I never saw again, her new master took her to Secunderabad and there she died; but Alwar was still around when I went back in 1949 tho' he died before I paid my last visit in 1957.\n\nBut I don't want to end on a sad note; let me tell you the story of the night we anchored the Poona Mail train to Bangalore City Station. We always went down in strength to see off anyone returning to England and on this occasion the station was under repair and with a number of steel wire ropes we tied the last coach to a stout iron stanchion. The guard waved his lamp, the engine started, the ropes tautened, everything held, and the train stopped. We offered to loose it all but the Guard was furious, said it was a Mail train and he would report us; we argued but to no avail, it was the delay to his precious Poona Mail that had angered him and when we asked \"Guard Sahib, is it really a Mail train?\" he rounded on us. We said \"Guard Sahib, if we prove it isn't a Mail train will you forgive us?\" He said we couldn't but if we did, well then Yes, he would NOT report us. So we took him along the platform and asked him to look at the name on the engine. Light dawned and he gave an unwilling smile; \"Yes\" he said \"all right, I will NOT make report for I see the name is Lady of the Lake so this is NOT Mail train but Female train.\"\n\nADDENDUM NO. 4\n\nMaps Showing the Areas of the World Where John Ancrum Cameron Saw Active Service\n\nMap 1.

The following narrative describes the role played by Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Cameron while with the Black Watch in India. Cameron and the regiment had just recently returned to England after fighting in the Crimea. On December 1856, the establishment of the regiment was reduced to 12 companies. On July 31st 1857, the regiment proceeded to Portsmouth, and on the 4th of August following it was reviewed by Her Majesty the Queen, who expressed herself highly satisfied with the fine appearance of the regiment. Between this date and the 14th, the corps embarked in six different ships for the east to assist in putting down the Indian Mutiny, and arrived at Calcutta in the October and November following. The headquarters, with five companies of the 42d Royal Highlanders, had orders to march for Cawnpore on the night of the 28th November; but when the news of the state of affairs at Cawnpore reached Allahabad, the column was recalled, and ordered to form an entrenched camp at Cheemee. Next morning the work was begun and progressed favourably until the 1st of December. Meanwhile the party was reinforced by a wing of Her Majesty\u2019s 38th Regiment, a wing of the 3d Battalion of the Rifle Brigade, and a party of Sappers and Artillery, making in all a force of 1050 men, with two 8-inch howitzers and four field-pieces. 0At 5 A.M. on the 2d December a messenger arrived in camp with a despatch from the Commander-in-chief ordering the column to make forced marches to Cawnpore. It marched accordingly at 8 P.M. on the same day and reached Cawnpore about noon on the 5th, having marched a distance of 78 miles in three days, though the men were fairly exhausted through fatigue and want of sleep. The position that the rebels held at Cawnpore was one of great strength.
