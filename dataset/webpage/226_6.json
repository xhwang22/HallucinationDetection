{"In 1992, Virginia Bottomley was promoted to Secretary of State for Health, a post she held until 1995.": [{"url": "https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-08-30-op-8435-story.html", "page_content": "Thomas Plate is editor of the editorial pages for The Times. William Tuohy is London bureau chief for The Times. They interviewed Virginia Bottomley in the health secretary's office\n\nShe has brought more than a touch of glamour to the British Cabinet--so much so that Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley is depicted on the irreverent Spitting Image TV show as Prime Minister John Major\u2019s girlfriend. But she is hardly the dumb-blonde caricature of the series. Rather, Bottomley, 44, holds one of the toughest jobs in the Cabinet--con stantly under fire from the opposition, which accuses the government of trying to undermine Britain\u2019s famed National Health Service.\n\nAnd as health secretary, boss of one of the big \u201cspending\u201d departments in government, she is frequently locked in battle with Treasury officials who are in the business of trimming her $62 billion-a-year NHS budget. However, she has had plenty of training for her arduous job.\n\nBorn in Scotland as Virginia Hilda Brunette Maxwell Garnett, she grew up in a middle-class, socially aware family. \u201cFor me, there wasn\u2019t really a decision about whether or not to do something in the public arena,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt was almost taken for granted that I would.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe studied sociology at Essex University and took a master\u2019s degree at the London School of Economics. At 19, she married Peter Bottomley, who became a member of Parliament and transportation minister. A mother of three, she was a researcher in child psychiatry, and was appointed a magistrate at age 27. She won election as a Conservative MP in 1984. In government, she served in various sub-Cabinet posts: in the Departments of Education, Overseas Development, the Foreign Office and Environment, before moving to Health, from which she was appointed to the Cabinet as secretary last April.\n\nBottomley denies that the Major government is trying to privatize the NHS, insisting that she herself has never received private medical care, and points out that her daughter is a doctor with the NHS.\n\nShe supports women\u2019s rights and equality, and is responsible for the governmental department that is the country\u2019s largest employer of women--some 750,000--mostly nurses.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t blot her copybook, her political future is bright indeed. As opposition Labor MP Frank Field, with whom she worked on joint committees, says of her \u201cEnglish rose\u201d attraction and clear speaking voice: \u201cShe knows that she is incredibly good-looking--and this government is short of talking heads on the box that don\u2019t make voters beg for the return of steam (early) radio.\u201d\n\nQuestion: There is growing criticism that, over the years, the medical research Establishment has wavered on issues that concern women more than men. For example, many critics both inside and outside the medical Establishment insist that breast cancer research has been neglected in relation to its incidence among women. Does that resonate in Britain?\n\nAnswer: I think there is little resonance of that here. Indeed, in this country we have taken forward a number of health programs directly related to women\u2019s health. We were one of the first countries in the world to have a national call and recall program for breast cancer and cervical cancer screening. And the new steps we have taken in our general practitioner contract--our family doctors contract--give them additional rewards for reaching almost universal coverage in the cancer-screening program. So one of the strengths of the National Health Service is its universality, its accessibility to all and, through the family doctor service, we are particularly determined to reach the groups who would otherwise be reluctant to come forward for health care, and, within that target audience, the needs of women--both in terms of cancer-screening and maternity services--are a clear priority.\n\nLast year I launched a document, \u201cYour Health--a Guide to Services to Women,\u201d available free to anyone who applied for it. It was extremely popular. Women are interested in health. They want to know what is available--they want to know for themselves and they want to know for their families.\n\nQ: The allocation of resources here has been a running argument. As people live longer, health care costs are higher. How does your government, or any government, cope with these costs vs. treatment? Do you foresee solutions as to how to deal with this in a time of dwindling revenues?\n\nA: Around the world it is clear that every country is facing the same challenges: aging population, rising expectations and the incredible ability of new medical techniques to combat diseases and disabilities that in the past would have been inconceivable. Our health service is one of the most efficient in the world. We spend a smaller share of our GNP, although a rising one, than many other countries, and it has great strength in that it is universally available, accessible to all and free at the point of delivery.\n\nThose are fundamental principles which I shall hold to. The reforms we have introduced have been about trying to ensure that we use those resources more effectively, that we integrate what I call the cultures of caring and costing. But, because we\u2019ve had a free health service, we\u2019ve very often been divorced from any knowledge or understanding of price or cost at all. In the minds of professionals and patients, it felt like a free service.\n\nOur reforms have been to try to secure better management control over resources so that we can maximize the ability of the service to deliver patient care. At the same time we have been introducing a health strategy so we actually get health authorities to begin to identify and assess the health need of the local population and spell out how they are going to meet that health need. Of course, that means making difficult choices between investment in intensive care, investment in the latest equipment and providing ever-improved services for mental illness or learning disabilities, for example.\n\nSome new techniques result in greater cost effectiveness--a rapid expansion in day surgery, for example. Whereas in the past patients would have gone into hospital for days or weeks, some use of pharmaceutical products can then reduce the need for hospital admission. So it is not necessarily the case that all medical advances lead to escalating costs. But as policy-makers we are in a much stronger position in this country, on the basis of our health reforms, to try to take the process forward, maximizing our ability to use those resources that we fight hard for, to get the best possible health benefit for the population.\n\nQ: Often you use the phrase \u201chealth reforms.\u201d What specifically do you mean by health reforms in the general sense?\n\nA: We have tried to reduce some of the bureaucracy and the monolithic nature of our National Health Service--so that hospitals can become free-standing organizations answerable to the (health) secretary--still part of the National Health Service but with a more effective management structure. Above all, we have separated out the role of commissioning health care, to the role of providing health care through the hospitals, both part of the National Health Service, but a clearer recognition of the functions and a greater transparency of the cost elements.\n\nQ: You do have an elaborate health service, and you also have very good private practices. Is there any fear--either from a government point of view or from an average patient--that somehow the government service may be second-rate compared with private health care?\n\nA: We have a modest private sector compared with almost any other country\u2019s, and ... my position is one of respect for the private sector; but my program is almost entirely concerned with ensuring that our National Health Service is and remains the envy of the world.\n\nPerhaps the most effective way of responding to your question is to make a personal statement, which is that I, my family, use the National Health Service. . . . I think it provides the best health care for me and my family. And what I am committed to is safeguarding that National Health Service, free, available to all, for the people of this country.\n\nQ: You don\u2019t want to privatize it?\n\nA: Not remotely on the agenda. I want to use the skills though, if there are management skills in the private sector--about the use of resources, about information technology, about management, about communication--that we can apply in the public sector.\n\nIf you are characterizing our health service in the past, I would say that our clinicians were outstanding, their techniques were in the forefront. We have to make sure that our management skills are as good in a public service as our clinical skills. And this is, of course, the whole focus of the Prime Minister\u2019s Citizens Charter program. Citizens Charter is about making sure that public services are accountable, that they give value for money, that they put the user in the forefront of concern. Our patients Charter has been the pioneer of the Citizens Charter movement, spelling out what are the rights and standards that patients can expect from the National Health Service, and we have been seeing real results in terms of falling waiting times, improved quality of service.\n\nQ: Do you think the British experience with the National Health Service bears lessons that the United States could learn?\n\nA: The strengths of the National Health Service are its universality, its availability to all. It seems that any health service ... needs to think about how to reach those groups who are often most at risk in terms of health need. So when it comes to HIV and AIDS, there are many anxieties about people coming forward, but having to pay for their treatment is not one of them. And those who are sick already have one handicap; we want to be sure that there is no further disincentive for them seeking treatment. The advantages of a system that encourages prevention is that you want to achieve the access. So that the strength is the universality.\n\nAn additional strength is our family doctor service, so that virtually every individual person in the country is signed on with a general practitioner--a generalist--who is the gatekeeper, the filter, a source of communication for the individual who is referred on to a hospital. Any other country taking forward a proposal has to examine those proposals in the context of its own traditions.\n\nQ: Specifically, how does Britain keep down the cost of health care?\n\nA: The issue will always be, for health secretaries, how to hold the ring between investing and encouraging those areas which don\u2019t necessarily hit the headlines. In addition, some of the more glamorous, experimental treatments, which cost huge resources, but result in relatively modest improvements in the quality of life, have to be balanced against areas where there is less public and political interest, but relatively modest sums can achieve substantial improvements. . . ."}, {"url": "https://www.islandlifemagazine.co.uk/virginia-my-passion-for-island/", "page_content": "In her 10 years as a Cabinet Minister Virginia Bottomley was one of the most powerful women in British politics. But even she will admit she didn\u2019t quite carry the clout of the woman who virtually ordered her to become a Member of Parliament \u2013 none other than former Prime Minister, \u2018Iron Lady\u2019 Margaret Thatcher.\n\nDuring her decade at the cutting edge of Government, and in all during her 21 years as a serving MP, Virginia never lost sight of the education of life and good values that were instilled into her as a young girl growing up, for the most part, here on the Island.\n\nDespite being born in Scotland, simply because her father was working there at the time, she, along with numerous family members, calls the Island her home. She is here as often as she can be, despite now being an active member of the House of Lords as Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone, as well as working as a head-hunter for a high-profile company in London. She chairs the Odgers Berndtson Board & CEO Practice, which conducts searches for Chairmen, CEOs and non-executive directors for plcs and private companies.\n\nDuring a break away from life in the fast lane that she still enjoys, Virginia took time out to give \u2018Island Life\u2019 readers an insight into her interesting and rewarding career as an MP, and her love of the Island.\n\nShe revealed: \u201cMy great grandfather Sir Edward Poulton came to St Helens Cottage in about 1890, and in 1915 he gave St Helens Common to the National Trust. My other grandfather Dr. William Garnett bought a house in Seagrove Bay around 1900.\n\n\u201cMy grandparents met playing hockey in Priory Bay, and we still play hockey there, so the family have been doing that for more than 100 years. All my family were quite academic and very involved in public policies. Dr William Garnett was involved in introducing education to London as one of the original signatories of the London School of Economics where I studied, so I am very proud of him.\u201d\n\nHer family bought half of Priory Bay in 1926, and the family home was built the following year. Since then the whole family has been down here constantly, with often as many as 100 relations gathering in the summer.\n\nVirginia points out: \u201cWe all share a passion for the Island. As a young girl I remember we had these appalling traditions, so every Easter Monday we would walk from Horestone Point to Whitecliff Bay \u2013 again a walk that was started by my great grandfather in 1890. The other tradition is swimming to St Helens Fort. My great uncles who were killed in the First World War did it, and I swam to the Fort when I was 10 years old.\n\n\u201cAnother childhood memory was when we loaded up the dinghies and drove to Freshwater and then rowed around and had a picnic in Scratchells Bay. Another time we had a running race from Freshwater to home. We really went for it, and couldn\u2019t move for a week afterwards. It was a competitive environment.\n\n\u201cWhen we were young Priory Bay was quite distant from Ryde because people didn\u2019t have cars and we went everywhere by boat. I think we learned a great resilience. Sometimes the tide and wind are against you and you make no progress. On other occasions you have the tide and wind with you, and even though you don\u2019t make much effort you travel like a rocket. I think that is the most wonderful lesson for life \u2013 sometimes you work so hard and it doesn\u2019t happen, but other times you just sail through it.\u201d\n\nVirginia recalls one of the most influential people in her life was her \u2018very special\u2019 aunt Peggy Jay. She said: \u201cShe was in politics and had a massive influence on me, and I say my husband Peter only married me because he thought I would turn out like Peggy Jay. She was a member of the Greater London Council, and was forceful. She was a great reformer and campaigner. She was brought up on the Island, and was a wonderful mentor.\u201d\n\nDespite being married to a Tory MP, Virginia had never given much thought to joining him in the Commons. Then one day her whole life changed when she received a call from 10 Downing Street, on the orders of PM Margaret Thatcher, saying more female MPs were required, and she was on the \u2018wanted list\u2019.\n\nShe continued: \u201cI decided Peggy Jay should have been an MP, but she wasn\u2019t so I would be. I wanted Peter to be the MP for the Isle of Wight long ago, and then in 1982 it came up for the following year\u2019s General Election. I worked so hard and actually got 34,900 votes \u2013 only five people in the country got more votes than I did, but one of those was Liberal Stephen Ross, the sitting MP, who beat me.\n\n\u201cI was devastated. The campaign was \u2018Turn Wight Blue\u2019 and Mrs. Thatcher even came over to visit. The day after I had lost she rang me to say \u2018what bad luck\u2019 and I burst into tears. But it made me realise much more about the Island; the huge delights, but also some of the difficulties and dilemmas.\n\n\u201cI learned how hugely entrepreneurial and creative the Island is with lots of small businesses and so many dedicated people. We all hope it can become an Island of real enterprise and creativity in small businesses. With modern technology, distance working and IT, my senses are that it is going to become ever more possible to realise this vision. The Island really has everything going for it.\n\n\u201cWhatever I have done, I have always felt part of my energy was put into developing and promoting the Island in any way I could. The Island needs all the help it can get to make people realise what a wonderful and exciting place it is.\u201d\n\nVirginia became MP for South West Surrey in 1984. There were 365 applicants to be the Tory candidate, but she was chosen and subsequently won the seat. She said: \u201cAt the time there were just 23 women MPs in a House of Commons of more than 600, so we were like an endangered species. Now the ratio is about one in four. I loved the constituency life and being involved in every aspect.\u201d\n\nInitially she served under Margaret Thatcher and then John Major, and received her first ministerial position in 1988 as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Department of the Environment. She was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Health in 1989, and was appointed a member of the Privy Council upon joining Major\u2019s Cabinet as Secretary of State for Health in 1992, serving until 1995.\n\nShe then served as Secretary of State for National Heritage until 1997. After the 1997 General Election, she returned to the back benches, saying: \u201cI had been working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and returning to the back benches enabled me to re-connect with my family. After 10 years I felt I had done my time and needed my life back.\u201d\n\nLooking back on her 10 years as a Minister, Virginia recalls: \u201cMrs. Thatcher called me one day to see her on a Monday, which was unusual. I said I was busy and could it be later in the week. But I was summoned and she offered me a job as a Minister. I was so surprised. She wanted me to go to Environment, but I had only ever spoken about Defence, Agriculture or transport, and knew nothing about it.\n\n\u201cShe replied very smartly that I would have to read up on it! It was very interesting getting people to use unleaded petrol, and recycle. But I loved being Secretary of State for Health because it was so demanding and intense. It was a job where I had a real role with serious responsibilities. I had to take difficult decisions, so I had to be courageous and tenacious to survive.\u201cWhen I first became a Minister I had a very bright young man in Central Office. He was 23 and used to coach and brief me when I went on television\u2019s \u2018Question Time\u2019. He was a very clever, positive person, and his name was David Cameron!\u201d\n\nThat is one of the main reasons why Virginia is very supportive of the present team, even though she believes coalition must be \u2018incredibly frustrating, compromising and complex\u2019.\n\nAfter quitting the Cabinet Virginia continued to work closely with Tory leaders William Hague, Ian Duncan Smith and Michael Howard. It was Howard who put her in the House of Lords in 2005. She said: \u201cI was absolutely delighted, and it was unexpected. Some of the debates in the Lords are phenomenal, and it will be a great loss if it goes. But I accept it is hard to justify.\u201d\n\nVirginia added: \u201cI am someone who is constantly restless, so I am never really satisfied. I have been married coming up 45 years to the same person, and that is something that gives great strength. But if you can find a role in life that in your way plays to your strengths and minimises your many failings then you are privileged.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://wiki.openrightsgroup.org/wiki/Baroness_Bottomley_of_Nettlestone", "page_content": "Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone, Virginia Bottomley, Conservative Peer\n\nOffice: House of Lords, London, SW1A 0PW Tel: 020 7219 5060 Email: bottomleyv@parliament.uk\n\nCareer\n\nDuring her parliamentary career Virgnia Bottomley was the PPS: to Chris Patten as Minister of State: Department of Education and Science 1985-86, Overseas Development Administration 1986-87, to Sir Geoffrey Howe as Foreign Secretary 1987-88; Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Environment 1988-89; Minister of State, Department of Health 1989-92; Secretary of State for: Health 1992-95, National Heritage (now Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport)1995-97.She was appointed a Life Peer in 2005.\n\nCurrently Baroness Bottomley is a Director of International Resources Group Ltd, trading as Odgers Berndtson, where she chairs the Board and CEO practice.

'Main vile Tory bigot.' And then he went back to cancel some more admissions, because all the operating theatres in his London teaching hospital are now closed one week in every six.\n\n'She's like gossamer when she talks, isn't she?' grumbled the woman in Edgware General Hospital's outpatients department. 'She comes on television and makes those long speeches full of figures, and you think: 'What's she saying? How can there be too many beds when there are people waiting on trolleys? And why does it all sound so meaningless?' '\n\nFew politicians engender so much passion, rouse so much ire, as the Secretary of State for Health - which is odd, because she is herself curiously passionless: driven by no great ideology, possessed by no coherent, controlling set of ideas about free-market economics, libertarianism or collectivism. She is 'an essentially practical person, who at university was less interested in sitting around analysing than in trying to make the bookshop work', according to her father; 'a glazier, or a window cleaner, rather than a window breaker', says her husband.\n\nMrs Bottomley occupies an essentially managerial job, implementing health reforms dreamt up by previous secretaries of state. It is a role that should be suited to such pragmatic talents. And yet she is loathed. In a recent Daily Telegraph poll, she was judged Britain's most insincere politician. In a Guardian poll of reactions to alternative Conservative leaders, she was less popular than Heseltine, Hurd, Clarke or Portillo, all of whom were thought to be less attractive than the present prime minister.\n\nJohn Major must have congratulated himself on making a smart move when he promoted Virginia Bottomley in 1992. Not only was he making good his previous gruesome error of failing to include a woman in his cabinet; he had found one who looked admirably equipped for the job. She came from a famously liberal-lefty family, many of whom were doctors. She had once worked for the Child Poverty Action Group, and then for 10 years in the NHS as a psychiatric social worker. She was unquestionably on the left of the Tory party, and she and her family (her husband is the only Tory MP to wear a Transport and General Workers Union tie) had always used the NHS. She didn't look remotely, conceivably, like a woman with a mission to privatise.\n\nAnd, of course, she is a woman, with all the caring connotations that implies, and much beauty besides. The wide, lipsticked mouth engulfs people in smiles, the eyes are wide and concerned-looking, the skin is clear, the shoes sensible; she is an ideal of a certain kind of modest, intelligent womanhood. She even, unlike Margaret Thatcher, has a lovely voice - melodious, bell-like and unstrident.\n\nSo what has gone wrong? Mrs Bottomley herself would say that nothing has - that, on the contrary, she has won round the profession, so that doctors are no longer opposed to change. But ideas which are now received wisdom in medical circles - that we will soon need fewer hospitals, concentrating on complex, hi-tech cases, while much of their old work is done out in the community at Super Health Centres - have failed to percolate through into public discussion. So, as Mrs Bottomley goes about her business - biting the bullet, as she sees it, of the overprovision of hospital beds in London - she upsets patients, who see hospitals closing, and don't understand why; who fear that the health service is being smashed at its very roots and then feel doubly betrayed by the womanly caring demeanour, the repeated assurances that she knows what's she's doing because she's been there, worked there, loves it.\n\nIt is, of course, somewhat difficult for her to explain the role of primary care before there is any. The hospitals are closing way before the GPs' surgeries have got their district nurses, their physiotherapists, their counsellors and their visiting consultants. And it is also difficult to explain if you refuse to engage with the issues. Interviewing Virginia is like throwing bean bags at a plate-glass window: questions seem to slither away in front of you, flopping on to the floor.\n\nThe issues are complex and endlessly debatable: how are we to decide whether heart transplants or hip replacements should take priority when the capacity to spend effectively on health care far exceeds the resources to pay for it? Why is there a belief that hospitals are becoming a thing of the past when emergency admissions are actually rising? How has this doublethink come about, whereby doctors are now rebuked for being too efficient? Britain has one of the cheapest health services in Europe: might that be because, historically, there wasn't a price on everything, and staff worked long hours in the name of something more nebulous than value for money?\n\nKen Clarke, architect of the health reforms, would, one suspects, have thwacked the bean bags back with some enthusiasm. Virginia sits comfortably in her vast office, in a green tartan skirt (which might, possibly, have come from Marks & Spencer, where she once shopped before opening-time to escape her admirers), a classy acid-green jacket and navy tights. She is of the Mary Archer type: controlled, ladylike, and beautiful; the type whose composure men frequently long to disturb (one Labour MP has called her 'staggeringly sexy'). She listens carefully, replying in her caressing, delightfully lulling voice, in little speeches larded with statistics and achievements, eschewing the broad sweep. On the rationing issue, for example, she says: 'As long as there's been a health service, choices have had to be made. When I was in my twenties, I campaigned to get mentally handicapped children out of those desperate long- stay hospitals. The reason they were there was that there was no money in the community. When we had the first heart transplant, the first kidney transplant, and only one special- care baby cot, there were terrible decisions that had to be made. So I've got little sympathy for this new discovery from the chattering classes that resources are finite and decisions have to be made. What is new, and this is right, is that there is greater discussion and debate about the running of the health service, and that's part of the role of the health authority, with local GPs.'\n\nThis is a typical Virginia response: Teflon- coated. It's hard to tell exactly what it means. But then why should the secretary of state run the risk of getting herself into trouble by engaging with the issues? Better to say something bland, but with any luck still politically effective: note the side-swipe at the chattering classes, aimed at ingratiating herself with the right, and the reference to her campaigning past, designed to reaffirm her caring credentials. Unfortunately, in the absence of any willingness, or ability, to do more than manage competently and massage the PR, Virginia Bottomley is left looking like one of those hi-tech buildings with the lifts and pipes on the outside. There is a disconcerting sense that you can see the politics working.\n\nPETER Bottomley, the mildly eccentric MP for Eltham, is trying to explain his wife. 'She is like her great-uncle Ronald who played rugby for England before the First World War: when the whistle blew, he got up and walked towards the guns. Or her uncle Kenneth, who rowed for Cambridge, who did the same, walked towards the guns.'\n\n'Er . . . sorry?'\n\n'All I'm trying to say,' Mr Bottomley mutters exasperatedly, 'is that for her, politics was never a lifelong ambition. Other people suggested she went into politics. She isn't interested in personal aggrandisement, not at all. In her family, they are dedicated to public service and total lack of self-interest.'\n\nOther members of what Virginia calls her 'great tribe' tell a similar story, of a woman with a calling, marching towards the guns. 'Virginia sees herself as a sort of vehicle,' says her aunt, Peggy Jay, a former Labour GLC councillor. John Garnett, her father, believes that 'all her life - and that's what the family is all about - she has been concerned with answers. What's the best you can do? She gets immense happiness from doing good. That's the way we were brought up.'\n\nVirginia Hilda Brunette Maxwell Garnett was born into this tribe 45 years ago, in Dunoon, Scotland, the second of four children. Her father ran the Industrial Society; her mother was a teacher who had joined the Jarrow marchers. A public-service, paternalist tradition courses through the family, 40 members of which still meet (as family members have since 1904) for an Easter walk on the Isle of Wight - 'a bit like the Kennedys at Hyannis Port,' as her cousin Peter Jay has said grandiosely. On this walk, the oldest male Garnett traditionally tells tales of derring-do: Scott of the Antarctic, the sinking of the Titanic, and how Virginia's grandfather James Maxwell Garnett, secretary of the League of Nations Union, lost his fountain pen when he was writing Education and World Citizenship.\n\nDouglas Jay, Harold Wilson's economic adviser, was married to Virginia's aunt; Peter Jay, former ambassador to Washington and now the BBC's economics editor, is one of her cousins; the deputy governor of the Bank of England is married to another. A great uncle invented the long-range weather forecast.\n\nVirginia has spent every August of her life on the Isle of Wight, mucking about in boats, eating ice-creams and building sandcastles. 'The great message of the sea is that the tide turns and you get used to the turbulence and the calmness. And that's quite a good metaphor for life,' she has said, in one of her yukkier reflections on these interludes. At other times she has talked about singing round the piano and the resilience that the family has given her along with the sense of service. Photographs of the MP for Surrey South-west on holiday in a sun hat, a long-limbed golden girl, swimming and playing tennis, bring to mind images of Joan Hunter Dunn: 'furnish'd and burnish'd by Aldershot sun,/ What strenuous singles we played after tea,/ We in the tournament - you against me.' Perhaps it really was like this for Peter Bottomley, who arrived to camp in their garden when he was 16 and she was 12 and, emotionally, never really left. ('Oh] full Surrey twilight] importunate band]/ Oh] strongly adorable tennis-girl's hand]')\n\nJohn Garnett remembers his elder daughter as 'a very difficult little girl: a big person in a little skin, an unhappy child, who hated going to bed and doing the things one tries to get children to do'. She went to Putney High School for Girls, where they unaccountably omitted to make her head girl, an oversight for which she once said she had been trying to compensate ever since; she also failed, much to her disappointment, to get into Oxford. She went to Essex instead, where her politics began to shift. At school she was the Labour candidate in mock elections, and canvassed in Battersea for her aunt Peggy, who admits she was 'frankly surprised' when Virginia became a Tory. 'I think she might have had a fairly horrible time at Essex in some ways: there was a lot of sort-of class war. And she was associated with Peter at a very young age, and I think he always had it in mind to go into Parliament.' (Her association with Peter, it was later revealed, extended to having his baby while she was still a student: their first child, Joshua, was born three months before they married.)\n\nVirginia herself has said that she was exasperated by endless socialist talk, when the Tory students were getting on with the Meals on Wheels. Her moral tutor at Essex, Peter Townsend, thinks however that 'it is highly unlikely she was a Tory then'. Professor Townsend and Mrs Bottomley recently exchanged bitter letters in the British Medical Journal, after she apparently rubbished her education as 'defeatist talk' in Parliament. Professor Townsend believes she was trying 'to wriggle out of the contradictions between the person she was then and what she is now supposed to be. It seems to me tragic - a denial of what she stood for personally'.\n\nOn other occasions, Virginia has attributed her rightwards shift to suspicion of trade union domination of Labour. 'I believed in helping those who couldn't help themselves, and almost by definition those people were unlikely to be trade union members,' she has said, meaning, presumably, that trade unions concentrated on looking after their own - but somehow suggesting that the pesky trade unions upset the proper order of things, which is that poor people must be helped, and Virginia Bottomley is jolly well going to do it. (Her uncle, Douglas Jay, once said: 'In the case of nutrition and health, just as in the case of education, the gentleman in Whitehall really does know better what is good for people than the people know themselves.') The obverse of the kind of noblesse oblige do-gooding in which Virginia and her family specialise is a sort of condescension, an assumption of superiority.\n\n'I often think of the opening scene in Howards End, when a young man is looking through a window into a lighted room at a family. I think that family is us,' Peggy Jay has said. This is a family which is mightily pleased with itself - which doesn't, of course, invalidate its good works. At the Child Poverty Action Group, Virginia succeeded in getting a number of wretchedly poor families to keep diaries of their expenditure, and wrote a report that was crucial in blocking moves to get child benefit paid to fathers through the tax system, instead of direct to mothers. She invited one of the families for Christmas; and, when the Ugandan Asians were expelled, gave house room to a Mr and Mrs Jetta for 18 months. 'Her house is constantly packed with broken people,' her father says. 'And she said to me recently, did I realise my nephew's wife was in difficulties? - and packed me off to see her.'\n\nBut however beneficial the effects of Virginia's Lady Bountiful activities, they require an acceptance by the people she is sorting out that they are suitable material for sorting. And these days that's a bit more difficult, because she's trying to sort out the entire country.\n\nGINNY the Sorter-Out, rather like an Enid Blyton heroine, has only to solve one mystery to come across another. 'I can't think of a moment when I ever sit back and think 'Isn't this an achievement?' ' she tells me. 'I'm always thinking about the next battle, the next campaign.' And there have been few battles bigger than The Case of The Health Service.\n\nBefore entering Parliament, Virginia spent 10 years as a psychiatric social worker in south London, becoming a JP at the age of 27 and chair of the Lambeth juvenile bench at 32, at the time of the Brixton riots. It was Mrs Thatcher - who told Virginia, with typical restraint, 'You'd make a better MP than your husband' - who, according to her father, decided her on a career in politics. She fought the Isle of Wight in 1983, where the sitting Liberal Democrat, Stephen Ross (later Lord Ross of Newport), claimed: 'She played the line, 'I have friends in high places. I can make this island work.' ' (Someone who knows her socially says: 'She is certainly never chary of using her connections. She will bring her children to parties if she knows there will be influential people there.') She lost by 3,000 votes, but only months later beat 300 other candidates to fight the Surrey South-west by-election, following the death of Maurice Macmillan. It is one of the safest seats in the country.\n\n'The day she was adopted for the Isle of Wight, she found out she was pregnant with her third child,' Peggy Jay remembers. (Joshua, now 25, works in the City and Cecilia - Lil - 24, is a doctor.) 'She made a very sensible decision, that she would see Adela (now 12) had continuity of care with a sort of deputy mum.' To this end, she employed Frances Riordan, a nanny-housekeeper (who died last year), 'which was quite difficult for Virginia, because she had to share authority with Frances, but it meant that the child had total security.' Virginia, who works from 6am to midnight, says the most important thing is that Adela should know that she is utterly reliable.\n\nWithin a year of entering Parliament in 1984, Virginia became a parliamentary private secretary to Chris Patten, and then to Geoffrey Howe. By 1988 she was a junior minister at the Department of Environment; by 1989 she was a health minister under William Waldegrave. She joined the Cabinet just eight years after arriving at the Commons.\n\nHer admirers contrast her handling of the hospitals with the fiasco over pit closures, and insist that she is a good tactician. But the truth is that while the Labour Party may have accepted several key elements of the government's reforms, the public remain largely ignorant of what is going on and continue to feel that changes are being made to their health service over their heads. 'For her, it's like a game of draughts,' says Frances Hirst, a cancer patient waiting in the Barts radiotherapy suite; 'but those draughts are people. She insists the health service is treating more patients, but how do we know? They've changed the way they collect the figures: they're about as reliable now as the unemployment statistics.'\n\nOne reason for Ginny's failure to get the message across may be that there's no clear message. As Chris Ham, professor of health management and policy at Birmingham University, points out: 'What is curious about these reforms is the way that one agenda has been overlaid on another. For Margaret Thatcher they were all about efficiency, for Ken Clarke primary care, for William Waldegrave the Health of the Nation, for Virginia Bottomley community care.' With so many conflicting messages, patients can be forgiven for thinking that what they're really about is saving money. Except, that is, when it comes to administrators: one recent Health Department advertisement for a human resources manager offered pounds 90,000 plus bonuses.\n\nSo what does Virginia think is the point of the health service reforms? 'Well,' she says, after a characteristic pause to establish and direct her answer, 'the health service reforms are about ensuring that we focus on the needs of patients, that we achieve better value for money, and that we improve the organisation, devolving responsibility as much as possible. There continue to be areas where a strategic overview is necessary: we need to ensure there is a comprehensive health service. There will always be that tension between the strategic overview and the need to devolve.'\n\nLondon was undoubtedly her hottest potato: conventional wisdom has it that there are too many hospital beds in the capital, where 20 per cent of NHS resources are being squandered on 15 per cent of the population. Barts and Guy's are unlikely to survive in anything like their present form; other hospitals which will suffer cuts and amalgamations include Charing Cross, Hammersmith, the Royal Marsden and Queen Charlotte's.\n\nTo Londoners, who take a fierce pride in their great hospitals, this looks like death by a thousand cuts - and for what? The primary care which is supposed to replace them is still largely invisible. And the argument that there are too many beds is by no means won: London has little more than half the number of per head of population than New York and, at 28.5 per 10,000 people, is way behind Paris (with 38.9 per 10,000). It simply may not be possible to treat London as another English region: 1 million Londoners live on income support, and there is a high incidence of homelessness, Aids and mental illness. The population swells by half as many people again every weekday.\n\nThe specialist teams at London hospitals may, meanwhile, be unwilling to transfer to Southend or Harrow. David Bihari, the physician in charge of intensive care at Guy's, believes that the closure of his hospital's accident and emergency department 'is all about balls, not brains. Virginia Bottomley has psyched herself up to close a teaching hospital, and she's determined to prove she's got the balls to do it.' He is planning to move to Australia.\n\nThe situation is not so different in other British cities. In Birmingham, acute admissions to hospital rose by 14 per cent last year, and 6 per cent for each of the two preceding years, partly due to an ageing population. 'There is a feeling that every straw is being grasped at to cut hospitals,' says Ken Taylor, a consultant physician and co-ordinator of the Birmingham Doctors' Emergency Admissions Group. 'Meanwhile, we are hot-bedding patients, as if they were products in a factory. The NHS is heading towards an acute service, with less and less room for non-urgent work. Affluent patients will increasingly get their non-urgent work done privately.'\n\nGinny the Sorter-Out has many fears to allay. And if she succeeds . . . well, she has already been talked of as a possible future home secretary, even Tory party leader. Peter thinks she may go into business: 'What other 45-year- old,' he asks, 'has managed bigger budgets, given as many press conferences, employed as many people?' Her father says her aim will simply be to go on doing good: 'She says her prayers, and wouldn't miss a Sunday in church: that's the key to it all.' Her belief in an idea of service is not in doubt, nor is her commitment, personally and politically, to live up to it. But right now what she has to do is persuade the nation that she is not, as one consultant described her to me, the Minister For Pretending The Health Service Is Safe In Tory Hands. Whether she has the clarity of purpose, the ability to produce the soundbites, or the tone to do this is an open question. On Desert Island Discs recently, she requested 'piped Today programme' as her luxury, adding: 'I'll want to ring up and say: 'Now, Today programme, you may be a very good programme, but the balance isn't quite right.' ' This is the authentic Ginny note: intrusive, goody-goody, and very off-putting. -\n\n(Photographs omitted)"}, {"url": "https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-virginia-bottomley-mp-secretary-of-state-to-health-27-october-1992-28257638.html", "page_content": "More information :\n\nThis image could have imperfections as it\u2019s either historical or reportage.\n\nVIRGINIA BOTTOMLEY MP SECRETARY OF STATE TO HEALTH 27 October 1992 Portrait looking right"}, {"url": "https://www.odgersberndtson.com/en-se/people/virginia-bottomley", "page_content": "Virginia Bottomley\n\nChair, Board Practice\n\nLondon\n\nRt Hon Baroness Virginia Bottomley DL chairs the Odgers Berndtson Board Practice.

The death sentence was first signalled by William Waldegrave when he was secretary of state for health. As Mr Waldegrave commented at the time, the NHS market \u201cisn't a market in the real sense \u2026 it's competition in the sense that there will be comparative information available.\u201d1 The change of direction was confirmed by Virginia Bottomley. In her valedictory speech in 1995 Mrs Bottomley extolled the virtues of planning and collaboration; the word \u201ccompetition\u201d scarcely crossing her lips.2 Her successor, Stephen Dorrell, has echoed this line, most notably in a personal letter to the chairs of health authorities and trusts. In his letter Mr Dorrell referred to the achievements of the NHS management reform, and at no point did he mention markets and the benefits that would arise from competition in future. Indeed, when was the last time any health minister urged those in the NHS to leave behind the legacy of planning and grasp the competitive opportunities available to them?\n\nThe decoupling of markets and health care is not a uniquely British phenomenon, as developments in Sweden and to a lesser extent the Netherlands indicate. After a decade in which competition was seen as the solution to the problem of inefficient health service provision, new ideas are under debate. It seems as if the competition vogue may have had its day, although in the eddying currents of political debate it is not always clear when the tide has finally turned.\n\nWhy has the attempt to bring markets into health care been a policy failure? In the British context there are several reasons. To begin with, the scope for competition in many parts of the NHS is limited by the existence of monopoly providers. Furthermore, even where there is a choice of providers, it has been difficult to control the effects of market forces. The result has been harmful instability, particularly in London and other cities where major changes in hospital provision have emerged onto the agenda. In recognition of the limits of competition, managers and doctors have moved increasingly to establish collaborative arrangements in which purchasers and providers work together on a long term basis. Not only is this a pragmatic response to weaknesses in the original policy design, but also it has been justified by reference to best practices in industry. Successful companies, it is argued, work in partnership with their suppliers and seek to create \u201cwin-win\u201d relationships. By extension, critics of competition maintain that the NHS should do the same. These developments have been reinforced by concerns about the increase in management costs associated with the introduction of competition.\n\nEstimates suggest that the NHS reforms may have resulted in up to pounds sterling1bn extra being spent on administration, although changes in definitions make it difficult to be precise. This is because of the need to employ staff to negotiate and monitor contracts and to deal with the large volumes of paperwork involved in the contracting system. Ministers have responded to these concerns by streamlining the organisation of the NHS and introducing tight controls over management costs. They have also encouraged the use of long term contracts in order to reduce the transaction costs of the new arrangements.\n\nOut of the ashes of competition has arisen a different policy agenda. This owes less to a belief in market forces than a desire to use the NHS reforms to achieve other objectives. The current agenda centres on policies to improve the health of the population, give greater priority to primary care, raise standards through the patient's charter, and ensure that medical decisions are evidence based. These policies hinge on effective planning and coordination in the NHS and all have been made more salient by the separation of purchaser and provider roles on which the reforms are based.\n\nIn particular, the existence of health authorities able to take an independent view of the population's health needs without being beholden to particular providers has changed the way in which decisions are made. To this extent the organisational changes introduced in 1991 have served to refocus attention on those whom the NHS exists to serve, even though the effects were neither anticipated nor intended when the reforms were designed. Like a potter moulding clay, only in the process of creation has the shape of the product become apparent. The effect of this policy shift has been to open up common ground between Labour and the Conservatives, notwithstanding the differences that remain.\n\nYet before the obituary of competition is written, the consequences of a return to planning need to be thought through. The NHS was reformed precisely because the old command and control system had failed to deliver acceptable improvements in efficiency and quality, and the limitations of planning must also be acknowledged. While competition as a reforming strategy may have had its day, there are nevertheless elements of this strategy which are worth preserving. Not least, the stimulus to improve performance which arises from the threat that contracts may be moved to an alternative provider should not be lost. The middle way between planning and competition is a path called contestability. This recognises that health care requires cooperation between purchasers and providers and the capacity to plan developments on a long term basis. At the same time, it is based on the premise that performance may stagnate unless there are sufficient incentives to bring about continuous improvements. Some of these incentives may be achieved through management action or professional pressure, and some may derive from political imperatives.\n\nIn addition, there is the stimulus to improve performance which exists when providers know that purchasers have alternative options. This continues to be part of the psychology of NHS decision making, even though ministers seem reluctant to use the language of markets. It is, however, a quite different approach than competitive tendering for clinical services, which would expose providers to the rigours of the market on a regular basis.\n\nThe essence of contestability is that planning and competition should be used together, with contracts moving only when other means of improving performance have failed. Put another way, in a contestable health service it is the possibility that contracts may move that creates an incentive within the system, rather than the actual movement of contracts. Of course for this to be a real incentive then contracts must shift from time to time, but this is only one element in the process and not necessarily the most important. As politicians prepare their plans for the future it is this path that needs to be explored."}]}
