He was the second son of Eastern Wei 's paramount general Gao Huan . Following the death of his brother and Gao Huan's designated successor an eldest son Gao Cheng in 549, Gao Yang became the regent of Eastern Wei. In 550, he forced Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei to yield the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and starting Northern Qi.\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for attentiveness to military matters, and the strength of the Northern Qi military was at its prime. He also tried to equalize the tax burden and reduce corruption by offering officials sufficient salary. He entrusted most governmental matters to the capable Yang Yin, and for a while, the government was effective, and the military was strong. In his later years, Emperor Wenxuan suffered from alcoholism and possibly insanity. Chinese historical annals recorded his bloody rages, nevertheless his reign, with assistance from his Chinese advisers, was considered well-administered and effective.\n\nRead more...: Early life As Eastern Wei regent Early reign Late reign Physical appearance Family Ancestry\n\nEarly life\n\nGao Yang was born in 526, while his father Gao Huan was a general under Northern Wei's paramount general Erzhu Rong. His mother Lou Zhaojun was Gao Huan's wife, on whose financial support Gao's early career had relied on. Lou Zhaojun was from a wealthy Xianbei family. He was their second son, after his older brother Gao Cheng. After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became Northern Wei's paramount general, and after Northern Wei divided into Eastern Wei and Western Wei in 534 became the actual power controlling Eastern Wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan (\u592a\u539f\u516c).\n\nGao Yang was not well regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children, though it appears that he feigned this to prevent suspicion of his elder brother. It appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of Eastern Wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent. He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin, to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent\n\nInitially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 8000 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival Liang Dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former Eastern Wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and establishing Northern Qi, with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager.\n\nEarly reign\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised Eastern Wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nJust like his father Gao Huan, Emperor Wenxuan viewed himself as more of a Xianbei rather than Chinese. Further, more than his father did, he was not willing to follow most of the Chinese traditions. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress. Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nIn response to the establishment of Northern Qi, Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of rival Western Wei, launched a major attack on Northern Qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead.\" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to Northern Qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu, Anhui).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang, Shanxi), and he ordered the construction of a great wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi), apparently to defend against Western Wei and Tujue.\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking Northern Qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan\u2014and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put Northern Qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo Yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to Eastern Wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, Northern Qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran, which by that point was near its end, surrendered to Northern Qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within Northern Qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the History of Northern Dynasties, and Sima Guang, the author of the Zizhi Tongjian, saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule\u2014that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality\u2014and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former Northern Wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became Eastern Wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later\u2014and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of Northern Wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (Book of Wei) was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as Huishu (\u7a62\u66f8\u2014the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, Western Wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack Western Wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and Western Wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\nLate reign\n\nWestern Wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang (known in history as the Western Liang), but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang, declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom Eastern Wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against Eastern Wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after Northern Qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between Northern Qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated Northern Qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to Northern Qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to Northern Qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed.)\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, which he converted into a fiddle, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within Northern Qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between Northern Qi and Liang resumed, and Northern Qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, Northern Qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of Northern Wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emperor Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian:\n\n:... Wenxuan drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Sometimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. He often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. ... Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven.\" He beheaded her.\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, his mother Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how she had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners and a saw to be available to the palace guards\u2014if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing Chen Dynasty, and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin, then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei, refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested Northern Qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, Northern Qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a Northern Qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan, Hubei).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unhappy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Zhan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the Northern Wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. In particular, a man named Yuan Huangtou flown off a tower strapped to a kite as part of an experiment of Emperor Wenxuan, the first known case of human flight. He survived but was starved to death in prison. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne.\" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin. Not long after, Gao Yan killed Yang Yin and deposed Gao Yin, becoming emperor.\n\nPhysical appearance\n\nIn the Book of Northern Qi, author Li Baiyao notes that Gao Yang was a dark-skinned man with large and protruding jaws, and that his skin appeared to be abnormally rough.\n\nFamily\n\nConsorts and Issue:\n\n\u2022 Empress Zhaoxin, of the Li clan of Zhao (\u662d\u4fe1\u7687\u540e \u8d99\u90e1\u674e\u6c0f), personal name Zu'e (\u7956\u5a25)\n\n\u2022 Gao Yin, Prince Jinan Mindao (\u6fdf\u5357\u610d\u60bc\u738b \u9ad8\u6bb7; 545\u2013561), first son\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaode, Prince Taiyuan (\u592a\u539f\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u5fb7; 548\u2013562), second son\n\n\u2022 Princess Changle (\u9577\u6a02\u516c\u4e3b), personal name Baode (\u5bf6\u5fb7)\n\n\u2022 Married Wei Shibian (\u5c09\u4e16\u8faf)\n\n\u2022 Princess Yining (\u7fa9\u5be7\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Hul\u00fc Wudu (\u659b\u5f8b\u6b66\u90fd; d. 572), the first son of Hul\u00fc Guang\n\n\u2022 Furen, of the Yan clan (\u5f18\u5fb7\u592b\u4eba \u984f\u6c0f; 530\u2013576), personal name Yuguang (\u7389\u5149)\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaolian, Prince Longxi (\u96b4\u897f\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u5ec9; 553\u2013577), fifth son\n\n\u2022 Pin, of the Pei clan (\u5b2a \u88f4\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaoren, Prince Xihe (\u897f\u6cb3\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u4ec1; d. 577), fourth son\n\n\u2022 Pin, of the Xue clan (\u5b2a \u859b\u6c0f; d. 555)\n\n\u2022 A daughter\n\n\u2022 Shifu, of the Feng clan (\u4e16\u5a66 \u99ae\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaoyi, Prince Fanyang (\u8303\u967d\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u7fa9; d. 580), third son\n\n\u2022 Unknown\n\n\u2022 Princess Zhongshan (\u4e2d\u5c71\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Duan Baoding of Wuwei (\u6b66\u5a01 \u6bb5\u5bf6\u9f0e)\n\nAncestry"}, {"url": "https://pantheon.world/profile/person/Emperor_Wenxuan_of_Northern_Qi/", "page_content": "Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi\n\nEmperor Wenxuan of (Northern) Qi ((\u5317)\u9f4a\u6587\u5ba3\u5e1d) (526\u2013559), personal name Gao Yang (\u9ad8\u6d0b, Wade\u2013Giles: Kao Yang), courtesy name Zijin (\u5b50\u9032), Xianbei name Hounigan (\u4faf\u5c3c\u5e72), was the founding emperor of the Northern Qi dynasty of China.

In 550, he forced Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei to yield the throne to him, ending eastern wei and starting northern qi.\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for attentiveness to military matters, and the strength of the northern qi military was at its prime. He also tried to equalize the tax burden and reduce corruption by offering officials sufficient salary. He entrusted most governmental matters to the capable Yang Yin, and for a while, the government was effective, and the military was strong. However, Emperor Wenxuan eventually turned cruel, and his erratic behavior, fueled by alcoholism, plunged his administration into chaos.\n\n\n\nEarly life Gao Yang was born in 529, while his father Gao Huan was a Han chinese general under northern wei's paramount general Erzhu Rong. His mother Lou Zhaojun was Gao Huan's wife, on whose financial support Gao's early career had relied on. Lou Zhaojun was an ethnic Xianbei. He was their second son, after his older brother Gao Cheng. After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became northern wei's paramount general, and after northern wei divided into eastern wei and western wei in 534 became the actual power controlling eastern wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan.\n\nGao Yang was not well regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children. However, it appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of eastern wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent. He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei ), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin, to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\n\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent Initially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 200 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi ), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival liang dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former eastern wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi ), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending eastern wei and establishing northern qi, with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager.\n\n\n\nEarly reign Early in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised eastern wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nWhile Emperor Wenxuan was ethnically Han, like his father Gao Huan, he viewed himself as Xianbei rather than Han. Further, more than his father did, he looked down on Han traditions, not willing to follow them. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress. Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nIn response to the establishment of northern qi, Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of rival western wei, launched a major attack on northern qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead. \" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to northern qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu ) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu, Anhui ).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang, Shanxi ), and he ordered the construction of a Great Wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi ), apparently to defend against western wei and Tujue.\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking northern qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan\u2014and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put northern qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to eastern wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, northern qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran, which by that point was near its end, surrendered to northern qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within northern qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi ).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the History of Northern Dynasties, and Sima Guang, the author of the Zizhi Tongjian, saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule\u2014that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality\u2014and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former northern wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became eastern wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later\u2014and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body thrown into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of northern wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (Book of Wei) was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as Huishu (\u7a62\u66f8\u2014the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, western wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei ), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack western wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei ) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and western wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\n\n\nLate reign western wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang, but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang, declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom eastern wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against eastern wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after northern qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between northern qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu ), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated northern qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to northern qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to northern qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed. )\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within northern qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between northern qi and Liang resumed, and northern qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, northern qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of northern wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emperor Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian: . . . [Emperor Wenxuan] drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Sometimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. He often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. . . . Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven. \" He beheaded her.\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how he had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners to be available to the palace guards\u2014if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing chen dynasty, and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin, then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei , refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested northern qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, northern qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a northern qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan, Hubei ).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unhappy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Dan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the northern wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne. \" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.nouahsark.com/en/infocenter/culture/history/dynasty/northern_qi.php", "page_content": "The Northern Qi Dynasty (simplified Chinese: \u5317\u9f50\u671d; traditional Chinese: \u5317\u9f4a\u671d; pinyin: B\u011bi Q\u00ed Ch\u00e1o) was one of the Northern dynasties of Chinese history and ruled northern China from 550 to 577.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Chinese state of Northern Qi was the successor state of the Chinese/Xianbei state of eastern wei and was founded by Emperor Wenxuan. Emperor Wenxuan had a Han Chinese father Gao Yang, and a Xianbei mother, Empress Dowager Lou Zhaojun. As eastern wei's paramount general Gao Huan was succeeded by his sons Gao Cheng and Gao Yang, who took the throne from Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei in 550 and established Northern Qi as its Emperor Wenxuan.\n\nAlthough Northern Qi was plagued by violence and/or incompetent emperors (Emperor Wenxuan, Emperor Wucheng, and Gao Wei), corrupt officials, and deteriorating armies for most of its existence, it was the strongest state of the three main Chinese states (along with northern zhou dynasty state and chen dynasty) when it was established.\n\nLike most imperial dynasties, it gradually declined and was destroyed by northern zhou dynasty in 577. Emperor Wenxuan's son Gao Shaoyi, the Prince of Fanyang, under protection by Tujue, later declared himself the emperor of Northern Qi in exile, but was turned over by Tujue to northern zhou dynasty in 580 and exiled to modern Sichuan . It is a matter of controversy whether Gao Shaoyi should properly be considered a Northern Qi emperor, but in any case the year 577 is generally considered by historians as the ending date for Northern Qi."}, {"url": "https://www.nouahsark.com/en/infocenter/culture/history/monarchs/emperor_fei_of_northern_qi.php", "page_content": "Emperor Fei of northern qi ((\u5317)\u9f4a\u5ee2\u5e1d) (545\u2013561), personal name Gao Fei (\u9ad8\u6bb7), courtesy name Zhengdao (\u6b63\u9053), posthumously Prince Mindao of Ji'nan (\u6fdf\u5357\u9594\u60bc\u738b), was briefly an emperor of the Chinese dynasty northern qi. He was the oldest son of the first emperor, Emperor Wenxuan (Gao Yang), and he became emperor after Emperor Wenxuan's death in 559. However, in his young age, the officials fought over power, and in 560, Emperor Fei's uncle Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan killed the prime minister Yang Yin and took over power, soon deposing Emperor Fei and taking the throne himself as Emperor Xiaozhao. in 561, fearful of prophecies that Emperor Fei would return to the throne, Emperor Xiaozhao had him put to death.\n\nBackground Gao Yin was born in 545, when his father Gao Yang, then the Duke of Taiyuan, was not viewed as an important figure in eastern wei's governmental structure, as while Gao Yang's father Gao Huan was the paramount general of the state, Gao Huan's heir apparent was not Gao Yang but Gao Yang's older brother Gao Cheng. Gao Yin's mother was Gao Yang's wife, the ethnically Han Li Zu'e, who carried the title the Duchess of Taiyuan, who subsequently gave birth to another son, Gao Shaode (\u9ad8\u7d39\u5fb7).\n\nIn 547, Gao Huan died, and Gao Cheng became effective regent of eastern wei, dominating the political scene, and he soon considered taking the throne from Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei. However, while preparing, he was assassinated by his slave Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac) in 549. In the aftermaths of Gao Cheng's death, Gao Yang, as the next oldest son of Gao Huan, took control of the eastern wei government. In 550, then bearing the title of Prince of Qi, had Emperor Xiaojing yield the throne to him, ending eastern wei and establishing northern qi as its Emperor Wenxuan. Despite the opposition of some officials (based on her Han ethnicity), Emperor Wenxuan created his wife Princess Li empress and created Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nGao Yin was considered intelligent and considerate as a child. For example, when he held feasts at the North Palace, he would invite his cousins, but he would not invite Gao Cheng's son Gao Xiaowan (\u9ad8\u5b5d\u742c), because Gao Cheng died in the North Palace, and so he did not want Gao Xiaowan to feast at his father's death place. Another episode mentioned by the Book of northern qi involved Gao Yin's being greatly impressed by the sexually moral official Xu Sanchou (\u8a31\u6563\u6101) that he awarded Xu a great amount of silk. (It may very well be that the story was recorded as a veiled praise for Gao Yin's being himself sexually moral, as compared to his sexually promiscuous father and uncles. )\n\nHowever, Emperor Wenxuan, who was violent and military-minded and who disfavored Han ways, felt that Gao Yin was too meek and considered deposing him. On one occasion, Emperor Wenxuan, who was accustomed to personally executing condemned prisoners inside the palace, ordered Gao Yin to carry out the execution. Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and, in anger, Emperor Wenxuan battered him with the handle of a whip. Since that incident, Gao Yin was recorded as suffering from a panic disorder, at times unable to speak and at times behaving erratically. At times, when the alcoholic Emperor Wenxuan was drunk, he would declare that he might eventually give the throne instead to Gao Yin's uncle Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, further leading to questions of succession.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne. \" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei.\n\nReign Pursuant to Emperor Wenxuan's will, the government was in the hands of several of his trusted officials -- Yang Yin the Prince of Kaifeng, Gao Guiyan (\u9ad8\u6b78\u5f65) the Prince of Pingqin, Yan Zixian (\u71d5\u5b50\u737b), and Zheng Yi (\u912d\u9824). Gao Yan, while respected by the people, was not given great power, and while his (and Emperor Wenxuan's) mother Empress Dowager Lou Zhaojun had some desire to have Gao Yan made emperor instead, there was insufficient support at the time, and Yang, in fear that Gao Yan and another brother of Emperor Wenxuan, Gao Dan the Prince of Changguang, would try to take power, took steps to curb their authorities. Emperor Fei honored his grandmother Empress Dowager Lou as grand empress dowager and mother Empress Li as empress dowager. Pursuant to his edicts, the palace construction projects that Emperor Wenxuan started, which caused much misery for his people in the latter years of his reign, were halted.\n\nAs Emperor Fei took the throne while he was attending to his father's deathbed at the secondary capital Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi ), when he proceeded to the capital Yecheng in spring 560, it was initially believed that Gao Yan or Gao Dan would be put in charge of Jinyang\u2014then perhaps the most militarily secure city in the empire; instead, by the arrangements of Yang and his associates, the two princes were ordered to accompany the young emperor to Yecheng.\n\nOnce the imperial train arrived at Yecheng, the situation became even more tense, as an associate of Yang's, Kezhuhun Tianhe (\u53ef\u6731\u6e3e\u5929\u548c), was convinced that Emperor Fei would not be safe in his reign unless his two uncles were killed, and alternatively, Yan Zixian considered putting Grand Empress Dowager Lou, who still wielded much power as the clan matriarch, under house arrest, and forcing her to turn her authorities to Empress Dowager Li. Meanwhile, the ambitious Yang was carrying out a governmental reorganization scheme to trim unnecessary offices and titles and to remove incompetent officials. The officials who were hurt by Yang's actions became disaffected and largely hoped that Gao Yan and Gao Dan would take action and began to encourage them to do so. Yang considered sending Gao Yan and Gao Dan outside the capital to be provincial governors, but Emperor Fei initially disagreed. Yang wrote a submission to Empress Dowager Li to ask her to consider, and she consulted her lady in waiting Li Changyi (\u674e\u660c\u5100), who leaked the news to Grand Empress Dowager Lou. She informed the two princes, and they set up an ambush, with Gao Guiyan and the generals Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) and Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1), at a ceremony where Gao Yan was to be named to a ceremonial post. Yang, Kezhuhun, Yan, Zheng, and Song Qindao (\u5b8b\u6b3d\u9053) were all severely battered and captured. Gao Yan and Gao Dan then entered the palace and publicly accused Yang and his associates of crimes; Yang and his associates were executed, and Gao Yan took control of the government. He soon went to take up post at Jinyang, controlling the government remotely.\n\nRemoval and death In fall 560, after Gao Yan convinced Grand Empress Dowager Lou the action is necessary, Grand Empress Dowager Lou issued an edict deposing Emperor Fei and making Gao Yan emperor (as Emperor Xiaozhao). The former emperor was created the Prince of Ji'nan. He was moved out of the main palace but was given a subsidiary palace at Yecheng. With Emperor Xiaozhao largely spending his time at Jinyang, Gao Dan was in charge of Yecheng, and the prince was under his guard.\n\nIn fall 561, sorcerers informed Emperor Xiaozhao that the imperial aura was still at Yecheng, making Emperor Xiaozhao concerned. Meanwhile, Gao Guiyan, who was concerned that Gao Yin would one day take the throne again and retaliate against him, persuaded Emperor Xiaozhao that his nephew had to be removed, and so Emperor Xiaozhao issued an edict to summon Gao Yin to Jinyang. Gao Dan, who at this time was disappointed at Emperor Xiaozhao not created him crown prince (instead creating his own son Gao Bainian crown prince), briefly considered redeclaring Gao Yin emperor and starting a rebellion against Emperor Xiaozhao, but ultimately chose not to do it, as his own sorcerers informed him that they believed that he would become emperor one day anyway. He therefore sent Gao Yin to Jinyang. Soon, Emperor Xiaozhao sent assassins to deliver poisoned wine to Gao Yin. Gao Yin refused to drink it, and the assassins strangled him. He was buried with honors due a prince, not an emperor."}, {"url": "https://www.nouahsark.com/en/infocenter/culture/history/monarchs/emperor_wen_of_western_wei.php", "page_content": "Emperor Wen of western wei ((\u897f)\u9b4f\u6587\u5e1d) (507\u2013551), personal name Yuan Baoju (\u5143\u5bf6\u70ac), was an emperor of the Chinese/Xianbei state western wei -- a branch successor state to northern wei. In 534, Yuan Baoju, then the Prince of Nanyang, followed his cousin Emperor Xiaowu in fleeing from the capital Luoyang to Chang'an, after a fallout between Emperor Xiaowu and the paramount general Gao Huan. However, Emperor Xiaowu's relationship to the general that he then depended on, Yuwen Tai, soon deteriorated as well, and around the new year 535, Yuwen Tai poisoned Emperor Xiaowu to death, making Yuan Baoju emperor (as Emperor Wen). As Gao Huan had, late in 534, made Yuan Shanjian the son of Emperor Wen's cousin Yuan Dan (\u5143\u4eb6) the Prince of Qinghe emperor (as Emperor Xiaojing), thus establishing eastern wei, Emperor Wen was known as western wei's first emperor, formalizing the division. Emperor Wen's relationship with Yuwen appeared cordial, but he was unable to exercise much real power.\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground Yuan Baoju was born in 507. His father Yuan Yu (\u5143\u6109), the Prince of Jingzhao, was the son of Emperor Xiaowen and a younger brother of the reigning Emperor Xuanwu. His mother was recorded as Yuan Yu's concubine Lady Yang. (Some historical records indicate that Lady Li was initially surnamed Yang, and only became known as Lady Li after Yuan Yu, wanting her to be part of a prominent family, had the aristocratic family Li adopt her. ) He had three other brothers, at least one of whom, Yuan Baoyue (\u5143\u5bf6\u6708), was older, and born of Lady Li.\n\nYuan Yu favored Lady Li but not his wife, Princess Yu, a sister to Emperor Xuanwu's wife Empress Yu. Consequently, Empress Yu once summoned Lady Li to the palace, beat her severely, and then forced her to become a Buddhist nun. Only after the intercession of Empress Yu's father Yu Jing (\u4e8e\u52c1) was Lady Li returned to Yuan Yu. Meanwhile, in 508, Yuan Yu himself was punished by Emperor Xuanwu for corruption. He was caned 50 times and demoted to the governorship of Ji Province (\u5180\u5dde, modern central Hebei ). In anger, he rebelled at the capital of Ji Province, Xindu (\u4fe1\u90fd, in modern Hengshui, Hebei ), alleging falsely that Emperor Xuanwu's uncle Gao Zhao had murdered the emperor and declaring himself emperor. Yuan Yu's rebellion was soon defeated by the general Li Ping (\u674e\u5e73), and during his being delivered to the capital Luoyang, Gao had him killed. At that time, Lady Li was pregnant, and she was permitted to give birth and then was executed. Emperor Xuanwu did not execute any of Yuan Yu's sons, but had them, including Yuan Baoju, put under arrest at Zongzheng Temple (\u5b97\u6b63\u5bfa). Assuming that Lady Li and Lady Yang were in fact the same person, this also meant that Yuan Baoju grew up without either parent. He and his brothers remained at Zongzheng Temple and were released only after Emperor Xuanwu's death in 515. During the reign of Emperor Xuanwu's son Emperor Xiaoming, Emperor Xiaoming's mother Empress Dowager Hu posthumously recreated Yuan Yu the Prince of Lintao, and Yuan Baoju and his brothers then observed a mourning period for their parents. Yuan Baoyue inherited the title, but Yuan Baoju did not possess any titles at the moment, although he was made a general. Despite Empress Dowager Hu's rehabiilitation of Yuan Yu, however, Yuan Baoju was not impressed at her toleration of corruption, particularly by her lovers, and he secretly plotted with Emperor Xiaoming to have her lovers killed. When this plot was discovered, he was stripped of the office he held. In 525, he married his wife Lady Yifu, the daughter of a moderately prominent aristocratic family. (In his youth, Yuan Baoju was described by the Book of Wei as frivolous, alcoholic, and sexually immoral, but this description is highly suspect in that the Book of Wei was written by Wei Shou, an official of eastern wei, the rival of western wei, for which Yuan Baoju would eventually become emperor. ) In 528, Emperor Xiaoming created him the Marquess of Shao County, and in 530, Emperor Xiaozhuang created him the Prince of Nanyang.\n\nIn 532, after several years of civil war, the victorious general Gao Huan made Yuan Baoju's cousin Yuan Xiu the Prince of Pingyang emperor (as Emperor Xiaowu). Emperor Xiaowu was not happy about Gao's hold on the military, and he entered into alliances with the independent generals Yuwen Tai and Heba Sheng (\u8cc0\u62d4\u52dd), seeking to resist Gao's control. Yuan Baoju served in Emperor Xiaowu's administration as a general. In 534, Emperor Xiaowu planned to act against Gao, but Gao discovered his plan and instead marched on Luoyang. Emperor Xiaowu decided to flee to Yuwen's territory, and Yuan Baoju accompanied Emperor Xiaowu in doing so, arriving at Chang'an in late 534. Also accompanying Emperor Xiaowu was Yuan Baoju's sister Yuan Mingyue (\u5143\u660e\u6708) -- who was in an incestuous relationship with Emperor Xiaowu. Yuwen did not tolerate Emperor Xiaowu's incestuous relationships with Yuan Mingyue and two other cousins, and eventually he had Yuan Mingyue killed. Emperor Xiaowu became angry, and his relationship with Yuwen deteriorated. Around the new year 535, Yuwen poisoned him to death.\n\nInitially, Yuwen was poised to make Emperor Xiaowu's nephew Yuan Zan (\u5143\u8d0a) the Prince of Guangping the new emperor. However, under suggestion of Yuan Shun (\u5143\u9806) the Prince of Puyang, who argued that Yuan Zan was too young, Yuwen changed his mind and made Yuan Baoju, then 27, emperor instead (as Emperor Wen). As Gao had earlier declared Yuan Shanjian, the son of Yuan Baoju's cousin Yuan Dan (\u5143\u4eb6) the Prince of Qinghe, emperor, Gao's territory became known as eastern wei, with Yuan Shanjian (Emperor Xiaojing) as emperor, and Yuwen's territory became known as western wei, with Emperor Wen as emperor.\n\n\n\nReign Yuwen Tai publicly deferred to Emperor Wen on most matters, but Yuwen held actual power, with Emperor Wen not being able to exercise much independent authority. Throughout the early years of his reign, there were serious doubts as to whether western wei would survive, as eastern wei was then the much stronger state, and Gao Huan made repeated attempts to conquer western wei. However, with Yuwen and other generals capably defending the territory, western wei was able to withstand Gao's assaults.\n\nIn 535, Emperor Wen posthumously honored his father Yuan Yu as Emperor Wenjing, and he posthumously honored his mother Lady Yang as empress. He created his wife Princess Yifu empress, and her son Yuan Qin crown prince. His marriage with Empress Yifu was said to be a happy one, as she was virtuous and beautiful, and Emperor Wen respected her greatly. She bore him 12 children, although only Yuan Qin and Yuan Wu (\u5143\u620a) the Prince of Wudu survived infancy.\n\nIn 538, with western wei under the threat of attack by Rouran, Yuwen first tried to alleviate the situation by marrying a daughter of a member of the imperial clan to Yujiul\u00fc Tahan (\u90c1\u4e45\u95ad\u5854\u5bd2), the brother of Rouran's Chiliantoubingdoufa Khan Yujiul\u00fc Anagui, but then, believing that to be insufficient, he asked Emperor Wen to divorce Empress Yifu and marry Yujiul\u00fc Anagui's daughter. Emperor Wen agreed, and divorced Empress Yifu, making her a Buddhist nun. He then married Yujiul\u00fc Anagui's daughter and created her empress. For a while, this brought peace with Rouran.\n\nLater in 538, with western wei then (temporariily) controlling the old northern wei capital Luoyang, but with Luoyang under attack, Emperor Wen (who had wanted to visit the imperial ancestral tombs in Luoyang) and Yuwen led troops to reinforce Luoyang's defenses, leaving the official Zhou Huida (\u5468\u60e0\u9054) and Crown Prince Qin in Chang'an. However, with the forces engaged in battle, Emperor Wen eventually became stuck at Hengnong (\u6046\u8fb2, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan ), when Chang'an was taken by rebelling former eastern wei troops who had been taken captive previously by western wei, forcing Zhou and Crown Prince Qin to flee as well. Yuwen was eventually able to disengage after abandoning Luoyang, and he put down the rebellion, allowing Emperor Wen to return to Chang'an.\n\nAlthough the former Empress Yifu had been deposed and made a Buddhist nun, Empress Yujiul\u00fc was still not happy about her presence in the capital. in 540, Emperor Wen therefore made Yuan Wu the governor of Qin Province (\u79e6\u5dde, roughly modern Tianshui, Gansu ), and had Empress Yifu accompany Yuan Wu to Qin Province. However, because he still hoped to welcome her back to the palace one day, he secretly told her to keep her hair uncut, rather than shaved like a Buddhist nun. At this time, however, Rouran made a major attack on western wei, and many officials thought that the attack was on behalf of Empress Yujiul\u00fc. Emperor Wen felt compelled to order Empress Yifu to commit suicide, and he did. Soon thereafter, Empress Yujiul\u00fc, who was pregnant, died during childbirth.\n\nIn 548, Yuwen and Yuan Qin were on a grand tour of the provinces when Emperor Wen grew ill, and when they heard the news, Yuwen returned to Chang'an quickly, although by the time they returned, Emperor Wen had recovered.\n\nIn 549, Emperor Wen issued an edict\u2014probably as Yuwen requested\u2014ordering that the names of the ethnic Xianbei, changed to Han names during the reign of Emperor Xiaowen, be changed back to the original Xianbei names.\n\nIn 550, Gao Huan's son Gao Yang forced eastern wei's Emperor Xiaojing to yield the throne to him, ending eastern wei and starting northern qi (as its Emperor Wenxuan). Emperor Wen therefore became the only claimant to the northern wei throne. Yuwen, declaring northern qi a rebel state, launched a major attack, but Gao Yang himself commanded a large army to defend against the attack, and western wei not only did not make gains, but lost a number of provinces to northern qi.\n\nIn 551, Emperor Wen died and was buried with honors due an emperor, with Empress Yujiul\u00fc, although eventually Empress Yifu was buried with him. (It is not clear whether she displaced Empress Yujiul\u00fc or not. ) Yuan Qin succeeded him (as Emperor Fei).\n\n\n\nEra names Datong (\u5927\u7d71 d\u00e0 t\u01d2ng) 535-551\n\n"}, {"url": "https://ctext.org/datawiki.pl?if=en&res=832461&remap=gb", "page_content": "((\u4e1c)\u9b4f\u5b5d\u9759\u5e1d) (524\u2013552), personal name(\u5143\u5584\u89c1), was the only emperor of the Eastern Wei \u2013 a branch successor state to Northern Wei . In 524 Emperor Xiaowu had fled the capital Luoyang to reestablish the imperial government at Chang'an. Northern Wei's paramount general Gao Huan made Emperor Xiaojing emperor as Emperor Xiaowu's replacement. Gao Huan moved the capital from Luoyang to Yecheng, thus dividing Northern Wei into two.

Around the new year 552, the former Emperor Xiaojing was poisoned to death on the orders of the new emperor.\n\nRead more...: Background During Gao Huans lifetime During Gao Chengs regency During Gao Yangs regency After removal from power Era names Family\n\nBackground\n\nYuan Shanjian was born in 524. His father Yuan Dan (\u5143\u4eb6) the Prince of Qinghe was a son of the well-regarded Yuan Yi (\u5143\u603f), also Prince of Qinghe and a son of Emperor Xiaowen. His mother Princess Hu was Yuan Dan's wife and was a granddaughter of Hu Zhen (\u80e1\u771f), an uncle of Emperor Xiaoming's mother Empress Dowager Hu. Yuan Shanjian was Yuan Dan's oldest son, and was his heir apparent.\n\nIn 534, Emperor Xiaowu, a cousin of Yuan Shanjian's father Yuan Dan, seeking to resist the control of the paramount general Gao Huan, entered into an alliance with independent generals Yuwen Tai and Heba Sheng (\u8d3a\u62d4\u80dc). When Gao, in response, marched toward the capital Luoyang, Emperor Xiaowu fled to Yuwen's territory. Yuan Dan initially joined Emperor Xiaowu on his flight, but quickly abandoned Emperor Xiaowu and returned to Luoyang. After Gao entered Luoyang, he had Yuan Dan assume acting imperial powers, and Yuan Dan began to become arrogant, viewing himself as the next emperor. Gao, who was in fact looking for a new emperor to replace Emperor Xiaowu, felt that Yuan Dan was inappropriate, and therefore, under the excuse that a cousin should not succeed another, chose Yuan Shanjian and declared him emperor (as Emperor Xiaojing). (Yuan Dan, in embarrassment and fear, tried to flee south, presumably to rival Liang Dynasty, but Gao tracked him down and brought him back to Luoyang.) This formally divided Northern Wei into Eastern Wei (with Emperor Xiaojing as emperor) and Western Wei (with Emperor Xiaowu as Emperor).\n\nDuring Gao Huans lifetime\n\nGao Huan, believing that Luoyang was too close to the borders of Western Wei and Liang, moved the capital to Yecheng, an important city firmly under his control. Viewing Emperor Xiaowu's flight as a blot on his person, Gao publicly showed Emperor Xiaojing the utmost respect for the rest of his life, and Gao's subordinates did not dare not to follow suit, although actual authority rested in the hands of Gao and other officials Gao delegated authority to. Gao also made repeated attempts to conquer Western Wei to reunify Northern Wei, but each time was repelled by Yuwen Tai or other Western Wei generals. Gao mostly remained at his headquarters in Jinyang (\u664b\u9633, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), but made occasional visits to Yecheng. In 536, Gao put his son, Gao Cheng, in charge of the Eastern Wei government. Late that year, Emperor Xiaojing's father Yuan Dan died, and according to some historians (but not all), Gao assassinated him.\n\nEmperor Xiaojing, as he grew, was described to be handsome and strong, capable of jumping over a fence while holding a stone lion. He was also said to be skillful at horseriding, archery, and literature. People compared him to his famed ancestor, Emperor Xiaowen.\n\nIn 539, Emperor Xiaojing took Gao Huan's second daughter as his empress.\n\nIn 544, Gao Cheng, wanting to place a trusted official to keep watch on Emperor Xiaojing, made his associate Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212) Emperor Xiaojing's secretary. However, Emperor Xiaojing had a cordial relationship with Cui, who often revised submissions Gao made to Emperor Xiaojing and edicts Emperor Xiaojing issued to Gao Huan and Gao Cheng, to improve the style and content. Emperor Xiaojing frequently made the comment, \"Cui is my wet nurse.\"\n\nIn 545, pursuant to Gao Huan's request, Emperor Xiaojing took the cousin of the khan of Tuyuhun, Murong Kual\u00fc (\u6155\u5bb9\u5938\u5415), as a concubine, to try to enhance the relationship with Tuyuhun.\n\nIn 547, Gao Huan died, and Gao Cheng took over full power of the government.\n\nDuring Gao Chengs regency\n\nIn light of Gao Huan's death, the general Hou Jing, who did not respect Gao Cheng, first surrendered the 13 provinces he controlled (the region between the Huai River and Yellow River) to Western Wei, and then to Liang. Gao Cheng's general Murong Shaozong (\u6155\u5bb9\u7ecd\u5b97), however, defeated both Xiao Yuanming \u2013 nephew of Liang's Emperor Wu, whom Emperor Wu sent to assist Hou \u2013 and Hou, capturing Xiao Yuanming and forcing Hou to flee to Liang. By 548, all but four provinces (which Western Wei took) were back under Eastern Wei control, and by 549, Eastern Wei had recaptured those provinces as well, after Gao Cheng captured Changshe (\u957f\u793e, in modern Xuchang, Henan).\n\nMeanwhile, during the campaign against Hou, a conflict between Gao Cheng and Emperor Xiaojing would erupt. Gao Cheng was not as respectful to Emperor Xiaojing as Gao Huan was, and he ordered Cui Jishu to intensify his surveillance of Emperor Xiaojing. On one occasion, when Gao Cheng was attending a feast, he flashed a cup before Emperor Xiaojing as a toast \u2013 a very disrespectful gesture, as a subordinate, when toasting the emperor, was supposed to kneel. Emperor Xiaojing became angry, and remarked, \"There is no such thing as an everlasting empire. Zhen the pronoun used by the emperor to refer to himself) do not necessarily treasure my life!\" Gao Cheng angrily responded, \"Zhen, zhen, zhen! You are a zhen with dog feet!\" He ordered Cui to punch Emperor Xiaojing three times, and then left abruptly. Emperor Xiaojing thereafter entered into a conspiracy with his teacher Xun Ji (\u8340\u6d4e), Yuan Jin (\u5143\u747e), Liu Siyi (\u5218\u601d\u9038), Yuan Daqi (\u5143\u5927\u5668) the Prince of Huashan, Yuan Xuanhong (\u5143\u5ba3\u6d2a) the Prince of Huainan, and Yuan Hui (\u5143\u5fbd) the Prince of Jibei to consider overthrowing Gao Cheng. They dug a tunnel from within the palace to the outside of the city, intending to create a secret passage for imperial guards to go through, but the tunnel was discovered, and Gao Cheng entered the palace with his troops, arresting Emperor Xiaojing, putting him under house arrest, and executing the other members of the conspiracy.\n\nIn spring 549, Emperor Xiaojing was forced to create Gao Cheng the greater title of Prince of Qi, and give him the honorific office of Xiangguo (\u76f8\u56fd), both signifying a move toward Gao's taking of the throne. Gao Cheng formally declined these honors, and further made a formal request for Emperor Xiaojing to create a son as crown prince. Subsequently, in fall 549, Emperor Xiaojing created his son Yuan Zhangren (\u5143\u957f\u4ec1) crown prince. (It is not known whether Yuan Zhangren's mother was Empress Gao.)\n\nAlso in fall 549, Gao Cheng was meeting Chen Yuankang (\u9648\u5143\u5eb7), Yang Yin, and Cui Jishu, to secretly discuss the timeframe in which to take the throne, when his servant Lan Jing (\u5170\u4eac) \u2013 a son of the Liang general Lan Qin (\u5170\u94a6) Gao Cheng captured in battle, and whom Gao Cheng had repeatedly threatened to kill \u2013 assassinated Gao Cheng and Chen. Gao Cheng's brother Gao Yang the Duke of Taiyuan, who was also in Yecheng at the time, killed Lan Jing and his associates, and publicly declared only that Gao Cheng had been wounded. Emperor Xiaojing, however, believed that Gao Cheng was dead, and secretly made the remark, \"It is heaven's will that the Grand Marshal D\u00e0 Ji\u0101ngj\u016bn, Gao Cheng's title at that time) is dead. The power to rule should return to the imperial clan.\"\n\nDuring Gao Yangs regency\n\nGao Yang, however, quickly moved to consolidate power. He made a quick show of force, marching his personal guards of 8,000 men into the palace, and stating to Emperor Xiaojing that he was going to Jinyang \u2013 where the military headquarters were. Emperor Xiaojing, seeing Gao Yang's intent on keeping power, turned pale and stated, \"This man does not appear any more tolerant of me. I do not know when I will die.\" Gao Yang set up his headquarters in Jinyang, intending to control the military, and in spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing create him the Prince of Qi Commandery \u2013 a slightly lesser title than the one that his brother declined before his death. Just two months later, Gao Yang's title was changed to Prince of Qi.\n\nMeanwhile, Gao Yang's associate Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f) was trying to persuade him to seize the throne. In summer 550, Gao Yang agreed, and he started advancing toward Yecheng, while sending Gao Dezheng to Yecheng to try to force the issue. Emperor Xiaojing bestowed Gao Yang the nine bestowments \u2013 the traditional penultimate step before abdication. After Gao Yang arrived in Yecheng, with the officials Pan Le (\u6f58\u4e50), Zhang Liang (\u5f20\u4eae), and Zhao Yanshen (\u8d75\u5f66\u6df1) sent by Gao Yang to request his abdication, Emperor Xiaojing did so, yielding the throne to Gao Yang, who established Northern Qi (as its Emperor Wenxuan).\n\nAfter removal from power\n\nThe new Emperor Wenxuan created the former emperor the Prince of Zhongshan, and gave him the special treatment of not having to declare himself a subject of the new emperor. He created his sister, the former empress, the Princess Taiyuan. The former emperor resided with the princess, and the princess, worried that her brother might do her husband harm, kept close watch on her husband, often tasting his food to make sure that it was not poisoned.\n\nHowever, Emperor Wenxuan was apprehensive of the former emperor. Around the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan invited the Princess Taiyuan to a feast inside the palace. As soon as she left her residence, Emperor Wenxuan sent assassins to force the former emperor to drink poisoned wine, and also killed his three sons. Emperor Wenxuan gave the former emperor the posthumous name of Xiaojing, and also buried him with imperial honors.

(Yuan Dan, in embarrassment and fear, tried to flee south, presumably to rival liang dynasty, but Gao tracked him down and brought him back to Luoyang. ) This formally divided northern wei into eastern wei (with Emperor Xiaojing as emperor) and western wei (with Emperor Xiaowu as Emperor).\n\nDuring Gao Huan's lifetime Gao Huan, believing that Luoyang was too close to the borders of western wei and Liang, moved the capital to Yecheng, an important city firmly under his control. Viewing Emperor Xiaowu's flight as a blot on his person, Gao publicly showed Emperor Xiaojing the utmost respect for the rest of his life, and Gao's subordinates did not dare not to follow suit, although actual authority rested in the hands of Gao and other officials Gao delegated authority to. Gao also made repeated attempts to conquer western wei to reunify northern wei, but each time was repelled by Yuwen Tai or other western wei generals. Gao mostly remained at his headquarters in Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi ), but made occasional visits to Yecheng. In 536, Gao put his son, Gao Cheng, in charge of the eastern wei government. Late that year, Emperor Xiaojing's father Yuan Dan died, and according to some historians (but not all), Gao assassinated him.\n\nEmperor Xiaojing, was he grew, was described to be handsome and strong, capable of jumping over a fence while holding a stone lion. He was also said to be skillful at horseriding, archery, and literature. People compared him to his famed ancestor, Emperor Xiaowen.\n\nIn 539, Emperor Xiaojing took Gao Huan's second daughter as his empress.\n\nIn 544, Gao Cheng, wanting to place a trusted official to keep watch on Emperor Xiaojing, made his associate Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212) Emperor Xiaojing's secretary. However, Emperor Xiaojing had a cordial relationship with Cui, who often revised submissions Gao made to Emperor Xiaojing and edicts Emperor Xiaojing issued to Gao Huan and Gao Cheng, to improve the style and content. Emperor Xiaojing frequently made the comment, \"Cui is my wet nurse. \"\n\nIn 545, pursuant to Gao Huan's request, Emperor Xiaojing took the cousin of the khan of Tuyuhun, Murong Kual\u00fc (\u6155\u5bb9\u5938\u5442), as a concubine, to try to enhance the relationship with Tuyuhun. In 547, Gao Huan died, and Gao Cheng took over full power of the government.\n\nDuring Gao Cheng's regency In light of Gao Huan's death, the general Hou Jing, who did not respect Gao Cheng, first surrendered the 13 provinces he controlled (the region between the Huai River and Yellow River to western wei, and then to Liang. Gao Cheng's general Murong Shaozong (\u6155\u5bb9\u7d39\u5b97), however, defeated both Xiao Yuanming \u2013 nephew of Liang's Emperor Wu, whom Emperor Wu sent to assist Hou \u2013 and Hou, capturing Xiao Yuanming and forcing Hou to flee to Liang. By 548, all but four provinces (which western wei took) were back under eastern wei control, and by 549, eastern wei had recaptured those provinces as well, after Gao Cheng captured Changshe (\u9577\u793e, in modern Xuchang, Henan ).\n\nMeanwhile, during the campaign against Hou, a conflict between Gao Cheng and Emperor Xiaojing would erupt. Gao Cheng was not as respectful to Emperor Xiaojing as Gao Huan was, and he ordered Cui Jishu to intensify his surveillance of Emperor Xiaojing. On one occasion, when Gao Cheng was attending a feast, he flashed a cup before Emperor Xiaojing as a toast \u2013 a very disrespectful gesture, as a subordinate, when toasting the emperor, was supposed to kneel. Emperor Xiaojing became angry, and remarked, \"There is no such thing as an everlasting empire. Zhen [(\u6715, an imperial self-appellation comparable to the pluralis majestatis)] do not necessarily treasure my life!\" Gao Cheng angrily responded, \"Zhen, zhen, zhen! You are a zhen with dog feet!\" He ordered Cui to punch Emperor Xiaojing three times, and then left abruptly. Emperor Xiaojing thereafter entered into a conspiracy with his teacher Xun Ji (\u8340\u6fdf), Yuan Jin (\u5143\u747e), Liu Siyi (\u5289\u601d\u9038), Yuan Daqi (\u5143\u5927\u5668) the Prince of Huashan, Yuan Xuanhong (\u5143\u5ba3\u6d2a) the Prince of Huainan , and Yuan Hui (\u5143\u5fbd) the Prince of Jibei to consider overthrowing Gao Cheng. They dug a tunnel from within the palace to the outside of the city, intending to create a secret passage for imperial guards to go through, but the tunnel was discovered, and Gao Cheng entered the palace with his troops, arresting Emperor Xiaojing, putting him under house arrest, and executing the other members of the conspiracy.\n\nIn spring 549, Emperor Xiaojing was forced to create Gao Cheng the greater title of Prince of Qi, and give him the honorific office of Xiangguo (\u76f8\u570b), both signifying a move toward Gao's taking of the throne. Gao Cheng formally declined these honors, and further made a formal request for Emperor Xiaojing to create a son as crown prince. Subsequently, in fall 549, Emperor Xiaojing created his son Yuan Zhangren (\u5143\u9577\u4ec1) crown prince. (It is not known whether Yuan Zhangren's mother was Empress Gao. )\n\nAlso in fall 549, Gao Cheng was meeting Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Yang Yin, and Cui Jishu, to secretly discuss the timeframe in which to take the throne, when his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac) \u2013 a son of the Liang general Lan Qin (\u862d\u6b3d) Gao Cheng captured in battle, and whom Gao Cheng had repeatedly threatened to kill \u2013 assassinated Gao Cheng and Chen. Gao Cheng's brother Gao Yang the Duke of Taiyuan, who was also in Yecheng at the time, killed Lan Jing and his associates, and publicly declared only that Gao Cheng had been wounded. Emperor Xiaojing, however, believed that Gao Cheng was dead, and secretly made the remark, \"It is heaven's will that the Grand Marshall [(\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd, D\u00e0 Ji\u0101ngj\u016bn, Gao Cheng's title at that time)] is dead. The power to rule should return to the imperial clan. \"\n\nDuring Gao Yang's regency Gao Yang, however, quickly moved to consolidate power. He made a quick show of force, marching his personal guards of 8,000 men into the palace, and stating to Emperor Xiaojing that he was going to Jinyang \u2013 where the military headquarters were. Emperor Xiaojing, seeing Gao Yang's intent on keeping power, turned pale and stated, \"This man does not appear any more tolerant of me. I do not know when I will die. \" Gao Yang set up his headquarters in Jinyang, intending to control the military, and in spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing create him the Prince of Qi Commandery \u2013 a slightly lesser title than the one that his brother declined before his death. Just two months later, Gao Yang's title was changed to Prince of Qi.\n\nMeanwhile, Gao Yang's associate Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f) was trying to persuade him to seize the throne. In summer 550, Gao Yang agreed, and he started advancing toward Yecheng, while sending Gao Dezheng to Yecheng to try to force the issue. Emperor Xiaojing bestowed Gao Yang the nine bestowments \u2013 the traditional penultimate step before abdication. After Gao Yang arrived in Yecheng, with the officials Pan Le (\u6f58\u6a02), Zhang Liang (\u5f35\u4eae), and Zhao Yanshen (\u8d99\u5f65\u6df1) sent by Gao Yang to request his abdication, Emperor Xiaojing did so, yielding the throne to Gao Yang, who established northern qi (as its Emperor Wenxuan).\n\nAfter removal The new Emperor Wenxuan created the former emperor the Prince of Zhongshan, and gave him the special treatment of not having to declare himself a subject of the new emperor. He created his sister, the former empress, the Princess Taiyuan. The former emperor resided with the princess, and the princess, worried that her brother might do her husband harm, kept close watch on her husband, often tasting his food to make sure that it was not poisoned.\n\nHowever, Emperor Wenxuan was apprehensive of the former emperor. Around the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan invited the Princess Taiyuan to a feast inside the palace. As soon as she left her residence, Emperor Wenxuan sent assassins to force the former emperor to drink poisoned wine, and also killed his three sons. Emperor Wenxuan gave the former emperor the posthumous name of Xiaojing, and also buried him with imperial honors. However, at a later time, for reasons unknown, Emperor Wenxuan opened up the tomb and threw Emperor Xiaojing's casket into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34).\n\nEra names Tianping (\u5929\u5e73 ti\u0101n p\u00edng) 534\u2013537 Yuanxiang (\u5143\u8c61 yu\u00e1n xi\u00e0ng) 538\u2013539 Xinghe (\u8208\u548c x\u012bng h\u00e9) 539\u2013542 Wuding (\u6b66\u5b9a w\u01d4 d\u00ecng) 543\u2013550\n\n"}, {"url": "https://ctext.org/datawiki.pl?if=en&res=832461", "page_content": "((\u6771)\u9b4f\u5b5d\u975c\u5e1d) (524\u2013552), personal name(\u5143\u5584\u898b), was the only emperor of the Eastern Wei \u2013 a branch successor state to Northern Wei . In 524 Emperor Xiaowu had fled the capital Luoyang to reestablish the imperial government at Chang'an. Northern Wei's paramount general Gao Huan made Emperor Xiaojing emperor as Emperor Xiaowu's replacement. Gao Huan moved the capital from Luoyang to Yecheng, thus dividing Northern Wei into two. Emperor Xiaojing's state became known as Eastern Wei. Although Gao Huan treated him with respect, real power was in the hands of Gao Huan, and then Gao Huan's sons Gao Cheng and Gao Yang . In 550, Gao Yang forced Emperor Xiaojing to yield the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and establishing Northern Qi (as its Emperor Wenxuan).

His father Yuan Dan (\u5143\u4eb6) the Prince of Qinghe was a son of the well-regarded Yuan Yi (\u5143\u61cc), also Prince of Qinghe and a son of Emperor Xiaowen. His mother Princess Hu was Yuan Dan's wife and was a granddaughter of Hu Zhen (\u80e1\u771f), an uncle of Emperor Xiaoming's mother Empress Dowager Hu. Yuan Shanjian was Yuan Dan's oldest son, and was his heir apparent.\n\nIn 534, Emperor Xiaowu, a cousin of Yuan Shanjian's father Yuan Dan, seeking to resist the control of the paramount general Gao Huan, entered into an alliance with independent generals Yuwen Tai and Heba Sheng (\u8cc0\u62d4\u52dd). When Gao, in response, marched toward the capital Luoyang, Emperor Xiaowu fled to Yuwen's territory. Yuan Dan initially joined Emperor Xiaowu on his flight, but quickly abandoned Emperor Xiaowu and returned to Luoyang.

He was the second son of Eastern Wei 's paramount general Gao Huan . Following the death of his brother and Gao Huan's designated successor an eldest son Gao Cheng in 549, Gao Yang became the regent of Eastern Wei. In 550, he forced Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei to yield the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and starting Northern Qi.\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for attentiveness to military matters, and the strength of the Northern Qi military was at its prime. He also tried to equalize the tax burden and reduce corruption by offering officials sufficient salary. He entrusted most governmental matters to the capable Yang Yin, and for a while, the government was effective, and the military was strong. In his later years, Emperor Wenxuan suffered from alcoholism and possibly insanity. Chinese historical annals recorded his bloody rages, nevertheless his reign, with assistance from his Chinese advisers, was considered well-administered and effective.\n\nRead more...: Early life As Eastern Wei regent Early reign Late reign Physical appearance Family Ancestry\n\nEarly life\n\nGao Yang was born in 526, while his father Gao Huan was a general under Northern Wei's paramount general Erzhu Rong. His mother Lou Zhaojun was Gao Huan's wife, on whose financial support Gao's early career had relied on. Lou Zhaojun was from a wealthy Xianbei family. He was their second son, after his older brother Gao Cheng. After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became Northern Wei's paramount general, and after Northern Wei divided into Eastern Wei and Western Wei in 534 became the actual power controlling Eastern Wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan (\u592a\u539f\u516c).\n\nGao Yang was not well regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children, though it appears that he feigned this to prevent suspicion of his elder brother. It appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of Eastern Wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent. He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin, to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent\n\nInitially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 8000 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival Liang Dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former Eastern Wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and establishing Northern Qi, with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager.\n\nEarly reign\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised Eastern Wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nJust like his father Gao Huan, Emperor Wenxuan viewed himself as more of a Xianbei rather than Chinese. Further, more than his father did, he was not willing to follow most of the Chinese traditions. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress. Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nIn response to the establishment of Northern Qi, Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of rival Western Wei, launched a major attack on Northern Qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead.\" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to Northern Qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu, Anhui).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang, Shanxi), and he ordered the construction of a great wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi), apparently to defend against Western Wei and Tujue.\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking Northern Qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan\u2014and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put Northern Qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo Yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to Eastern Wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, Northern Qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran, which by that point was near its end, surrendered to Northern Qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within Northern Qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the History of Northern Dynasties, and Sima Guang, the author of the Zizhi Tongjian, saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule\u2014that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality\u2014and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former Northern Wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became Eastern Wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later\u2014and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of Northern Wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (Book of Wei) was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as Huishu (\u7a62\u66f8\u2014the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, Western Wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack Western Wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and Western Wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\nLate reign\n\nWestern Wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang (known in history as the Western Liang), but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang, declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom Eastern Wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against Eastern Wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after Northern Qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between Northern Qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated Northern Qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to Northern Qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to Northern Qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed.)\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, which he converted into a fiddle, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within Northern Qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between Northern Qi and Liang resumed, and Northern Qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, Northern Qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of Northern Wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emperor Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian:\n\n:... Wenxuan drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Sometimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. He often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. ... Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven.\" He beheaded her.\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, his mother Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how she had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners and a saw to be available to the palace guards\u2014if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing Chen Dynasty, and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin, then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei, refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested Northern Qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, Northern Qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a Northern Qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan, Hubei).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unhappy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Zhan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the Northern Wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. In particular, a man named Yuan Huangtou flown off a tower strapped to a kite as part of an experiment of Emperor Wenxuan, the first known case of human flight. He survived but was starved to death in prison. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne.\" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin. Not long after, Gao Yan killed Yang Yin and deposed Gao Yin, becoming emperor.\n\nPhysical appearance\n\nIn the Book of Northern Qi, author Li Baiyao notes that Gao Yang was a dark-skinned man with large and protruding jaws, and that his skin appeared to be abnormally rough.\n\nFamily\n\nConsorts and Issue:\n\n\u2022 Empress Zhaoxin, of the Li clan of Zhao (\u662d\u4fe1\u7687\u540e \u8d99\u90e1\u674e\u6c0f), personal name Zu'e (\u7956\u5a25)\n\n\u2022 Gao Yin, Prince Jinan Mindao (\u6fdf\u5357\u610d\u60bc\u738b \u9ad8\u6bb7; 545\u2013561), first son\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaode, Prince Taiyuan (\u592a\u539f\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u5fb7; 548\u2013562), second son\n\n\u2022 Princess Changle (\u9577\u6a02\u516c\u4e3b), personal name Baode (\u5bf6\u5fb7)\n\n\u2022 Married Wei Shibian (\u5c09\u4e16\u8faf)\n\n\u2022 Princess Yining (\u7fa9\u5be7\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Hul\u00fc Wudu (\u659b\u5f8b\u6b66\u90fd; d. 572), the first son of Hul\u00fc Guang\n\n\u2022 Furen, of the Yan clan (\u5f18\u5fb7\u592b\u4eba \u984f\u6c0f; 530\u2013576), personal name Yuguang (\u7389\u5149)\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaolian, Prince Longxi (\u96b4\u897f\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u5ec9; 553\u2013577), fifth son\n\n\u2022 Pin, of the Pei clan (\u5b2a \u88f4\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaoren, Prince Xihe (\u897f\u6cb3\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u4ec1; d. 577), fourth son\n\n\u2022 Pin, of the Xue clan (\u5b2a \u859b\u6c0f; d. 555)\n\n\u2022 A daughter\n\n\u2022 Shifu, of the Feng clan (\u4e16\u5a66 \u99ae\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaoyi, Prince Fanyang (\u8303\u967d\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u7fa9; d. 580), third son\n\n\u2022 Unknown\n\n\u2022 Princess Zhongshan (\u4e2d\u5c71\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Duan Baoding of Wuwei (\u6b66\u5a01 \u6bb5\u5bf6\u9f0e)\n\nAncestry"}, {"url": "https://www.nouahsark.com/en/infocenter/culture/history/monarchs/emperor_wenxuan_of_northern_qi.php", "page_content": "Emperor Wenxuan of (Northern) Qi ((\u5317)\u9f4a\u6587\u5ba3\u5e1d) (529\u2013559), personal name Gao Yang (\u9ad8\u6d0b), courtesy name Zijin (\u5b50\u9032), was the first emperor of the Chinese dynasty northern qi. He was the second son of eastern wei's paramount general Gao Huan, and the death of his brother and Gao Huan's designated successor Gao Cheng in 549 became the regent of eastern wei. In 550, he forced Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei to yield the throne to him, ending eastern wei and starting northern qi.\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for attentiveness to military matters, and the strength of the northern qi military was at its prime. He also tried to equalize the tax burden and reduce corruption by offering officials sufficient salary. He entrusted most governmental matters to the capable Yang Yin, and for a while, the government was effective, and the military was strong. However, Emperor Wenxuan eventually turned cruel, and his erratic behavior, fueled by alcoholism, plunged his administration into chaos.\n\n\n\nEarly life Gao Yang was born in 529, while his father Gao Huan was a Han chinese general under northern wei's paramount general Erzhu Rong. His mother Lou Zhaojun was Gao Huan's wife, on whose financial support Gao's early career had relied on. Lou Zhaojun was an ethnic Xianbei. He was their second son, after his older brother Gao Cheng. After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became northern wei's paramount general, and after northern wei divided into eastern wei and western wei in 534 became the actual power controlling eastern wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan.\n\nGao Yang was not well regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children. However, it appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of eastern wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent. He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei ), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin, to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\n\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent Initially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 200 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi ), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival liang dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former eastern wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi ), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending eastern wei and establishing northern qi, with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager.\n\n\n\nEarly reign Early in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised eastern wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nWhile Emperor Wenxuan was ethnically Han, like his father Gao Huan, he viewed himself as Xianbei rather than Han. Further, more than his father did, he looked down on Han traditions, not willing to follow them. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress. Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nIn response to the establishment of northern qi, Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of rival western wei, launched a major attack on northern qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead. \" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to northern qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu ) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu, Anhui ).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang, Shanxi ), and he ordered the construction of a Great Wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi ), apparently to defend against western wei and Tujue.\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking northern qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan\u2014and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put northern qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to eastern wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, northern qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran, which by that point was near its end, surrendered to northern qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within northern qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi ).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the History of Northern Dynasties, and Sima Guang, the author of the Zizhi Tongjian, saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule\u2014that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality\u2014and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former northern wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became eastern wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later\u2014and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body thrown into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of northern wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (Book of Wei) was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as Huishu (\u7a62\u66f8\u2014the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, western wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei ), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack western wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei ) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and western wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\n\n\nLate reign western wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang, but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang, declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom eastern wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against eastern wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after northern qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between northern qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu ), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated northern qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to northern qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to northern qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed. )\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within northern qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between northern qi and Liang resumed, and northern qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, northern qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of northern wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emperor Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian: . . . [Emperor Wenxuan] drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Sometimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. He often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. . . . Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven. \" He beheaded her.\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how he had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners to be available to the palace guards\u2014if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing chen dynasty, and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin, then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei , refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested northern qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, northern qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a northern qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan, Hubei ).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unhappy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Dan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the northern wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne. \" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://ctext.org/datawiki.pl?if=gb&res=707678&remap=gb", "page_content":

\u5317\u9f50\u671d; traditional Chinese: \u5317\u9f4a\u671d; pinyin: B\u011bi Q\u00ed Ch\u00e1o) was one of the Northern dynasties of Chinese history and ruled northern China from 550 to 577.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Chinese state of Northern Qi was the successor state of the Chinese/Xianbei state of eastern wei and was founded by Emperor Wenxuan. Emperor Wenxuan had a Han Chinese father Gao Yang, and a Xianbei mother, Empress Dowager Lou Zhaojun. As eastern wei's paramount general Gao Huan was succeeded by his sons Gao Cheng and Gao Yang, who took the throne from Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei in 550 and established Northern Qi as its Emperor Wenxuan.\n\nAlthough Northern Qi was plagued by violence and/or incompetent emperors (Emperor Wenxuan, Emperor Wucheng, and Gao Wei), corrupt officials, and deteriorating armies for most of its existence, it was the strongest state of the three main Chinese states (along with northern zhou dynasty state and chen dynasty) when it was established.\n\nLike most imperial dynasties, it gradually declined and was destroyed by northern zhou dynasty in 577. Emperor Wenxuan's son Gao Shaoyi, the Prince of Fanyang, under protection by Tujue, later declared himself the emperor of Northern Qi in exile, but was turned over by Tujue to northern zhou dynasty in 580 and exiled to modern Sichuan . It is a matter of controversy whether Gao Shaoyi should properly be considered a Northern Qi emperor, but in any case the year 577 is generally considered by historians as the ending date for Northern Qi."}, {"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/3747792", "page_content": "Emperor Wenxuan of (Northern) Qi ((\u5317)\u9f4a\u6587\u5ba3\u5e1d) (529-559), personal name Gao Yang (\u9ad8\u6d0b), courtesy name Zijin (\u5b50\u9032), was the first emperor of the Chinese dynasty Northern Qi . He was the second son of Eastern Wei 's paramount general Gao Huan , and the death of his brother and Gao Huan's designated successor Gao Cheng in 549 became the regent of Eastern Wei. In 550, he forced Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei to yield the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and starting Northern Qi.\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for attentiveness to military matters, and the strength of the Northern Qi military was at his prime. He also tried to equalize the tax burden and reduce corruption by offering officials sufficient salary. He entrusted most governmental matters to the capable Yang Yin , and for a while, the government was effective, and the military was strong. However, Emperor Wenxuan eventually turned cruel, and his erratic behavior, fueled by alcoholism, plunged his administration into chaos.\n\nEarly life\n\nGao Yang was born in 529, while his father Gao Huan was a general under Northern Wei 's paramount general Erzhu Rong . His mother Lou Zhaojun was Gao Huan's wife, on whose financial support Gao's early career had relied on. He was their second son, after his older brother Gao Cheng . After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became Northern Wei's paramount general, and after Northern Wei divided into Eastern Wei and Western Wei in 534 became the actual power controlling Eastern Wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan.\n\nGao Yang was not well-regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children. However, it appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of Eastern Wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent . He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan , Hebei ), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin , to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent\n\nInitially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 200 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan , Shanxi ), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival Liang Dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former Eastern Wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong , Shanxi ), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and establishing Northern Qi , with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager .\n\nEarly reign\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised Eastern Wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nWhile Emperor Wenxuan was ethnically Han, like his father Gao Huan, he viewed himself as Xianbei rather than Han. Further, more than his father did, he looked down on Han traditions, not willing to follow them. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress . Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince .\n\nIn response to the establishment of Northern Qi, Yuwen Tai , the paramount general of rival Western Wei, launched a major attack on Northern Qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead.\" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to Northern Qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian , whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou , Jiangsu ) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu , Anhui ).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang , Shanxi ), and he ordered the construction of a great wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou , Shanxi ), apparently to defend against Western Wei and Tujue .\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking Northern Qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan -- and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put Northern Qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to Eastern Wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, Northern Qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran , which by that point was near its end, surrendered to Northern Qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within Northern Qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou , Shanxi ).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the \" History of Northern Dynasties \", and Sima Guang , the author of the \" Zizhi Tongjian \", saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule -- that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality -- and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former Northern Wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became Eastern Wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later -- and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body thrown into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of Northern Wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (\" Book of Wei \") was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as \"Huishu\" (\u7a62\u66f8 -- the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, Western Wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou , Hubei ), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack Western Wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan , Hubei ) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and Western Wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\nLate reign\n\nWestern Wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang, but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang , declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom Eastern Wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against Eastern Wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after Northern Qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between Northern Qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang , Jiangsu ), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated Northern Qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to Northern Qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to Northern Qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed.)\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within Northern Qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between Northern Qi and Liang resumed, and Northern Qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, Northern Qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of Northern Wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emepror Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his \"Zizhi Tongjian\":\n\n:\"... [Emperor Wenxuan] drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Soemtimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. he often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. ... Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven.\" He beheaded her.\"\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how he had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners to be available to the palace guards -- if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing Chen Dynasty , and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin , then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei , refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested Northern Qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, Northern Qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a Northern Qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan , Hubei ).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unahppy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Dan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the Northern Wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne.\" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin.\n\nEra name\n\n* \"Tianbao\" (\u5929\u4fdd ti\u0101n b\u01ceo) 550-559\n\nPersonal information"}, {"url": "https://www.liquisearch.com/emperor_wenxuan_of_northern_qi/early_life", "page_content": "Early Life\n\nGao Yang was born in 529, while his father Gao Huan was a Han chinese general under Northern Wei's paramount general Erzhu Rong. His mother Lou Zhaojun was Gao Huan's wife, on whose financial support Gao's early career had relied on. Lou Zhaojun was an ethnic Xianbei. He was their second son, after his older brother Gao Cheng. After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became Northern Wei's paramount general, and after Northern Wei divided into Eastern Wei and Western Wei in 534 became the actual power controlling Eastern Wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan.\n\nGao Yang was not well regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children. However, it appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of Eastern Wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent. He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin, to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power."}, {"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/4564805", "page_content": "Gao Wei (\u9ad8\u7def) (557-577), often known in history as Houzhu of Northern Qi ((\u5317)\u9f4a\u5f8c\u4e3b), courtesy name Rengang (\u4ec1\u7db1), sometimes referred to by his later Northern Zhou -created title of Duke of Wen (\u6eab\u516c), was an emperor of the Chinese dynasty Northern Qi . During his reign, Northern Qi's imperial administration was plunged into severe corruption and wastefulness, with the military suffering after Gao Wei killed the great general Hul\u00fc Guang in 572. Rival Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou launched a major attack in 576, and Northern Qi forces collapsed. Gao Wei, who formally passed the throne to his son Gao Heng , was captured while trying to flee to Chen Dynasty , and later that year, the Northern Zhou emperor executed him and almost all members of his clan.\n\nBackground\n\nGao Wei was born in 557, when his father Gao Dan was the Prince of Changguang under Emperor Wenxuan, Gao Dan's older brother. Gao Wei's mother was Gao Dan's wife Princess Hu, and he was her first son, but not his father Gao Dan's first son -- as Gao Dan's concubine Lady Li also gave birth several hours earlier on the same day Princess Hu did, to Gao Chuo (\u9ad8\u7dbd). However, as Princess Hu was his wife, Gao Dan publicly announced that Gao Wei was born first and treated him as the first-born. Thereafter, he was named Gao Dan's heir apparent .\n\nIn 561, another older brother of Gao Dan, Emperor Xiaozhao, died, leaving instructions for the throne to be passed to Gao Dan. Gao Dan therefore took the throne (as Emperor Wucheng). In 562, he created his wife Princess Hu empress and created Gao Wei crown prince . While Gao Wei was crown prince, he married the daughter of the key general Hul\u00fc Guang as his wife and crown princess.\n\nIn 565, with astrological signs indicating that the imperial position should be changed, Emperor Wucheng's favored officials He Shikai and Zu Ting , wanting to ingratiate themselves with Empress Hu and Gao Wei as well, suggested that Emperor Wucheng avoid the ill fortune by passing the throne to Gao Wei. Emperor Wucheng agreed, and Gao Wei, at age eight, became emperor, although Emperor Wucheng, carrying the title of \" Taishang Huang \" (retired emperor), retained the actual powers. Emperor Wucheng created Gao Wei's wife Crown Princess Hul\u00fc empress.\n\nEarly reign (with Emperor Wucheng as regent)\n\nIn spring 567, Gao Wei celebrated his rite of passage .\n\nGao Wei was considered a young man of weak personality, and while Gao Wei was emperor, Emperor Wucheng and Retired Empress Hu both greatly favored his younger brother, Gao Yan the Prince of Dongping, honoring Gao Yan with many high offices and making sure that Gao Yan received all of the same supplies as his emperor brother did. Gao Yan was considered intelligent and decisive, and he once asked Emperor Wucheng, \"My brother is weak in personality. How can he lead the empire?\" Both Emperor Wucheng and Retired Empress Hu considered deposing Gao Wei and making Gao Yan emperor, but did not actually do so.\n\nAround the near year 569, Emperor Wucheng suffered a major illness and died suddenly, after entrusting the important matters to He Shikai. He Shikai, after initially not announcing Emperor Wucheng's death, did after several days. Retired Empress Hu now carried the title of empress dowager .\n\nMiddle reign\n\nAfter Emepror Wucheng's death, while Gao Wei formally took on imperial authorities himself, the government was led by a group of eight high-level officials -- He Shikai, Lou Dingyuan (\u5a41\u5b9a\u9060), Zhao Yanshen (\u8d99\u5f65\u6df1), Gao Wenyao (\u9ad8\u6587\u9059), Tang Yong (\u5510\u9095), Qilian Meng (\u7da6\u9023\u731b), Gao Anagong , and Empress Dowager Hu's cousin Hu Changcan (\u80e1\u9577\u7cb2). However, infighting soon developed, as by spring 569, Emperor Wucheng's cousin Gao Rui (\u9ad8\u53e1) the Prince of Zhao Commandery, Emperor Wucheng's brother Gao Run (\u9ad8\u6f64) the Prince of Fengyi, Emperor Wucheng's nephew Gao Yanzong the Prince of Ande, Lou, and Gao Wenyao, were all recommending that He Shikai, who was clearly the most powerful of the eight, be made a provincial governor. Gao Rui, in particular, was most critical of He Shikai for being corrupt and immoral, as it was an open secret that He Shikai was having an affair with Empress Dowager Hu. Faced with the officials' pressure, He Shikai agreed to be sent out to the provinces (along with Gao Wenyao), and it was announced that after Emperor Wucheng's burial, He Shikai would be made the governor of Yan Province while Gao Wenyao would be made the governor of Western Yan Province (\u897f\u5157\u5dde, roughly modern Anyang , Henan ). After Emperor Wucheng's burial, Gao Rui pressured He Shikai to leave Yecheng as quickly as possible, despite Empress Dowager Hu's desire to keep He Shikai for 100 days after Emperor Wucheng's burial. He Shikai bribed Lou and was permitted to meet Empress Dowager Hu and Gao Wei once more -- and he persuaded them that the high level officials were intending harm to them and that they could only trust him. Gao Wei thus issued an edict rebuking Gao Rui. When Gao Rui nevertheless entered the palace to try to pressure Empress Dowager Hu and Gao Wei to remove He Shikai. Empress Dowager Hu, instead, arrested Gao Rui and had the guard commander Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) strangle Gao Rui. Thereafter, He Shikai's power went unchecked. The other favorite associates of Gao Wei -- including Gao Wei's wet nurse Lu Lingxuan and her son Mu Tipo , as well as Zu Ting.\n\nIn summer 570, Gao Wei's concubine Consort Mu Sheli gave birth to his first son, Gao Heng , and Gao Wei declared a general pardon. Lady Lu, who was also Consort Mu's adoptive mother, wanted Gao Heng to eventually be crown prince and emperor, but was afraid that Empress Hul\u00fc would oppose the plan, so she gave Gao Heng to Empress Hul\u00fc for her to raise. In winter 570, Gao Wei created Gao Heng crown prince.\n\nDuring much of Emperor Wucheng's and Gao Wei's reign up to this point, rival Northern Zhou had gradually encroached on Northern Qi territory, making minor gains on the borders. In winter 570, Hul\u00fc Guang launched a counterattack and captured significant amounts of territory north of the Fen River (\u6c7e\u6c34, flowing through modern Linfen , Shanxi ). He then also defeated Northern Zhou troops at Yiyang (\u5b9c\u967d, in modern Luoyang , Henan ). On his way back to the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan , Hebei ), Gao Wei ordered his troops demobilized even though many of the soldiers had not received rewards. however, he received an order to demobilize his troops. Hul\u00fc Guang submitted a secret petition to Gao Wei, requesting the emperor to send imperial messengers to the army to honor the soldiers. Gao Wei did not act immediately, however, and the army approached Yecheng without receiving any words from the emperor. Gao Wei was displeased that Hul\u00fc Guang brought the army close to the capital, and he summoned Hul\u00fc to the palace before sending messengers to honor the soldiers and demobilizing them.\n\nLater in 571, Gao Wei's brother Gao Yan, now the Prince of Langye, angry at the hold that He Shikai had on power, killed him, and further mobilized his troops to consider seizing power and killing Lady Lu and her son Mu Tipo, who had also become powerful. Hul\u00fc, while he approved of Gao Yan's killing of He Shikai, was still loyal to the emperor, and he intervened on the emperor's side, ordering Gao Yan's troops to disband, and they collapsed. Hul\u00fc seized Gao Yan and took him to the palace. At Hul\u00fc's urging, Gao Wei spared Gao Yan initially, although in winter 571 he nevertheless had Liu Taozhi suffocate Gao Yan, and Gao Yan's four posthumous sons were also killed. Also in winter 571, after discovering that Empress Dowager Hu had been conducting an affair with the Buddhist monk Tanxian (\u66c7\u737b), he executed Tanxian and put Empress Dowager Hu under house arrest, disallowing the nobles from visiting her. In spring 572, in order to placate her, however, he posthumously honored Gao Yan with the unusual title \"Emperor Gong'ai of Chu\" and honored Gao Yan's wife Princess Li \"Empress of Chu.\" Zu and Lady Lu tried to have Lady Lu made empress dowager to replace Empress Dowager Hu, but Gao Wei did not do so. Empress Dowager Hu, in order to please her son, summoned the daughter of her brother Hu Changren (\u80e1\u9577\u4ec1) to the palace and dressed her in the best clothes. Gao Wei saw her and was infatuated with her, and he took her as a concubine.\n\nIn 572, Empress Hul\u00fc gave birth to a daughter, and Gao Wei, wanting to please Hul\u00fc Guang, initially claimed that she gave birth to a son, but eventually had to admit that the child was a daughter. By this point, Hul\u00fc Guang was in serious conflict with the powerful officials Zu and Mu. He disliked Zu, and he often complained to his generals that Zu rarely consulted military generals. Once, when he was resting at a governmental building, Zu, who had blinded during a period of imprisonment during Emperor Wucheng's reign, rode past him without realizing that Hul\u00fc was there, and never got off the horse as demanded by customs of the time. Hul\u00fc angrily stated, \"Who does he think he is?\" Zu, realizing that Hul\u00fc disliked him, bribed Hul\u00fc's servant and asked the servant about Hul\u00fc's opinion of him. The servant stated, \"Ever since you came into power, the Minister Prince [a reference to Hul\u00fc, as Hul\u00fc carried the title of Prince of Xianyang] each night sighed and stated, \"With a blind man in power, the empire will surely be destroyed.\" Meanwhile, Mu had once requested to marry Hul\u00fc's daughter by a concubine, but Hul\u00fc refused. Further, when Mu requested that Gao Wei grant him the public fields at Jinyang, Hul\u00fc publicly opposed the action as being detrimental to the grazing of the army's horses. Zu and Mu therefore both despited Hul\u00fc. They therefore fostered suspicion of Hul\u00fc in the emperor's mind, and that suspicion was exacerbated by the fact that Empress Hul\u00fc was not favored by Gao Wei.\n\nAt the same time, the Northern Zhou general Wei Xiaokuan , wanting to try to exploit Gao Wei's suspicions, decided to try to create a sense that Hul\u00fc would rebel. He wrote two songs in couplets, one of which read:\n\n:\"A hundred \"sheng\" [(\u5347, a measurement unit -- and 100 \"sheng\" made up one \"hu\" (\u659b))] will fly up to the heavens,\":\"A bright moon [(\u660e\u6708, \"mingyue\", Hul\u00fc's courtesy name )] will shine over Chang'an [Northern Zhou's capital] .\"\n\nThe other read:\n\n:\"The high [(\u9ad8, \"gao\")] mountain will collapse on its own,\":\"The daimyo oak [(\u69f2, \"hu\")] will stand straight on its own.\"\n\nHe sent spies to spread the songs near Yecheng, and the songs soon became popular. Zu, exploiting the situation himself, added two more lines:\n\n:\"The blind man will bear a great axe,\":\"The talkative woman will be unable to speak.\"\n\nBoth Zu and Lady Lu then reported the song to Gao Wei to further foster his suspicion of Hul\u00fc. Gao Wei consulted another favorite, Han Zhangluan , who believed that he should not suspect Hul\u00fc, so Gao Wei initially took no action. Zu, however, would not relent, and he had Hul\u00fc's subordinate Feng Shirang (\u5c01\u58eb\u8b93) make a secret submission indicating that when Hul\u00fc had brought the army close to Yecheng in 571, he was plotting a coup. Gao Wei believed it this time, and under Zu's suggestion, he awarded Hul\u00fc a horse, and then, as Hul\u00fc arrived at the palace to thank the emperor, he had Liu Taozhi seize Hul\u00fc and strangle him to death. Hul\u00fc's clan was nearly all slaughtered -- including his brother and fellow general Hul\u00fc Xian (\u659b\u5f8b\u7fa8) and his sons Hul\u00fc Wudu (\u659b\u5f8b\u6b66\u90fd), Hul\u00fc Shixiong (\u659b\u5f8b\u4e16\u96c4), and Hul\u00fc Hengqie (\u659b\u5f8b\u6046\u4f3d). Only his youngest son Hul\u00fc Zhong (\u659b\u5f8b\u937e), who was only a few years old, was spared. Empress Hul\u00fc was deposed and confined to a subsidiary palace.\n\nLate reign\n\nAfter Empress Hul\u00fc was deposed, Lady Lu wanted Consort Mu to be empress, but Empress Dowager Hu wanted her niece Empress Hu to be empress. She, however, did not believe she had enough persuasive power, and so she had to flatter Lady Lu and give her gifts. Lady Lu also saw that Gao Wei favored Empress Hu, and so agree to jointly suggest, with Zu Ting, that Consort Hu be created empress, and Gao Wei did so. He favored Empress Hu so greatly that he made clothes for her out of pearls, although those clothes were later destroyed in a fire. However, Lady Lu did not relent in her hopes of making Consort Mu empress, stating to Gao Wei, \"How can a son be crown prince and a mother be a servant girl, a concubine?\" But as Gao Wei favored Empress Hu, she could not carry out her wishes. She therefore engaged witches to use witchcraft on Empress Hu. It was said that within a month, Empress Hu began to show symptoms of psychosis, often mumbling to herself or laughing without cause. Gao Wei began to fear and dislike her. In winter 572, Lady Lu put Consort Mu in empress clothing and put her in a tent, surrounded with magnificent jewelry, and then told Gao Wei, \"Let me show you a holy woman.\" When Gao Wei saw that it was Consort Mu, Lady Lu stated, \"For a woman this beautiful not to be empress, who would be qualified to be empress?\" Gao Wei agreed with her, and he created Consort Mu \"Right Empress\" and gave Empress Hu the title \"Left Empress. Around the new year 573, Lady Lu further falsely told Empress Dowager Hu that Empress Hu had denigrated Empress Dowager Hu's moral character -- and Empress Dowager Hu, in anger, without verifying the information, ordered Empress Hu expelled from the palace, and then had Gao Wei depose her. Thereafter, it was said that Lady Lu and Mu Tipo were so powerful and so corrupt that they were openly taking bribes and selling the imperial offices, and all that they wished were carried out. By spring 573, Mu Tipo, Gao Anagong, and Han Zhanglauan were referred to as \"the Three Nobles,\" and they controlled the government. The issue of corruption became severe, and with Gao Wei himself living in luxury and waste, constantly building palaces and tearing them downand rebuilding them, the Northern Qi imperial treasury was at a state of exhaustion.\n\nIn spring 573, Gao Wei created Right Empress Mu sole empress.\n\nAlso in spring 573, Zu Ting, knowing that Gao Wei had a love of literature, with Gao Wei's approval, established the Wenlin Hall (\u6587\u6797\u9928), headed by the officials Li Delin and Yan Zhitui (\u984f\u4e4b\u63a8). They retained a group of literarily-capable men and authored one of the great compendia of the era, the \"Xiuwendian Yulan\" (\u4fee\u6587\u6bbf\u5fa1\u89bd).\n\nIn summer 573, rival Emperor Xuan of Chen launched a major attack across the Yangtze River , commanded by the general Wu Mingche . Gao Wei went against the advice of the officials Wang Hong (\u738b\u7d18), who advocated passive resistance while reducing tax burdens to strengthen the people's resolve, and Zhao Yanshan, who advocated commissioning the Liang Dynasty general Wang Lin , who had long wanted to reestablish Liang at Chen's expense, with an army. Rather, Gao Wei sent reinforcements to the attacked provinces -- but only in small amounts, not sufficient to resist Chen forces -- with the main force commanded by Wei Pohu (\u5c09\u7834\u80e1) and Zhangsun Hongl\u00fce (\u9577\u5b6b\u6d2a\u7565) defeated by Wu's troops. Wang, who accompanied Wei as a consultant, was then ordered to go to Shouyang (\u58fd\u967d, in modern Lu'an , Anhui ) to defend that city against attack -- but with severe limitations on his authority. Soon, Shouyang fell, and Wang was captured and executeed by Wu. All of Northern Qi's territory between the Yangtze and the Huai River fell into Chen control. Despite the losses, however, Mu Tipo and Han advocated continued epicurean lifestyle on Gao Wei's and their own parts, with Mu famously stating, \"Even if we lost all territory south of the Yellow River , we can still be like Qiuzi (\u9f9c\u8332, a city state in modern Xinjiang ). But what is more piteous is that a human life is like borrowed time, and we should use all this short period to seek pleasure. Why worry about Shouyang?\" Gao Wei agreed, and continued to spend his days feasting.\n\nDuring the Chen attack, Zu, who had become embroiled in conflict with Lady Lu, Mu Tipo, and Han, was expelled from the central government over his attempt to impose a reform regime to streamline the government and reduce expenses. He would not return, and after his departure, the government became even more inefficient than before. Further, also during the campaign, Gao Wei became suspicious of his cousin Gao Changgong (\u9ad8\u9577\u606d) the Prince of Lanling, a capable general, and poisoned Gao Changgong to death.\n\nAlso during the Chen attack, another major wrongful massacre was carried out at Gao Wei's orders. Gao Wei was intending to visit the secondary capital Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan , Shanxi ), which he and his predecessors did on a regular basis. The senior officials Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212) and Zhang Diao (\u5f35\u96d5) -- who had been Gao Wei's teacher perviously and respected by him -- believed that for Gao Wei to go to Jinyang would be misinterpreted by the populace as a \"flight\" to Jinyang, and would lead to popular panic, so they, with a number of other officials -- including Feng Xiaoyan (\u5c01\u5b5d\u7430), Liu Ti (\u5289\u9016), Pei Ze (\u88f4\u6fa4), and Guo Zun (\u90ed\u9075) -- submitted a joint petition requesting Gao Wei to stay at Yecheng. Han suggested that these officials were in fact intending to rebel, and Gao Wei agreed, executing Cui, Zhang, Feng, LIu, Pei, and Guo. He further exiled their clan members, confiscated their women, and castrated their boys.\n\nIn spring 574, Gao Sihao (\u9ad8\u601d\u597d) the Prince of Nan'an and governor of Shuo Province (\u6714\u5dde, roughly modern Shuozhou , Shanxi ), angry that he had been disrespected by Gao Wei's servant Zhuogu Guangbian (\u65ab\u9aa8\u5149\u5f01), rebelled. Gao Wei sent Tang Yong to resist Gao Sihao while personally leading the next army north, but before he could get there, Gao Sihao was defeated, and he committed suicide by drowning.\n\nMeanwhile, around this time, Gao Wei had become less attracted to Empress Mu, instead becoming more infatuated with Empress Mu's servant girl Feng Xiaolian , making her an imperial consort. They went everywhere together, and they swore to live and to die together.\n\nThe historian Sima Guang , in his \" Zizhi Tongjian \", had this to say about Gao Wei and his reign:\n\n:\"The ruler of Qi was not a good speaker and could not speak clearly, and so he did not like to meet with governmental officials. He spoke nothing to anyone except his jesters and servants. He was weak in his personality and was fearful of people staring at him. Even the most honored officials or the head of the government were not allowed to look at him, and therefore the officials could only make summary reports and then withdraw in panic. He inherited the luxurious and wasteful living habits of Emperor Wucheng and thought that this was proper. All of the women and eunuch s of the palace dressed in the best silk and ate delicacies. It sometimes took 10,000 \"pi\" [\u5339, a measurement unit for textile] to make one skirt for them. Each of them competed with each other for the newest and most wonderful things, and clothes made in the morning may be considered old and out of style that same evening. He spent much effort on building palaces and gardens of the greatest splendor, but his affections for them could not last, so all buildings were torn down and rebuilt and torn down again. These construction activities went around the clock without ceasing, with great torches used for illumination at night, and water boiled to mix with the dirt in the winter. In order to carve Buddha images in the western hills of Jinyang, over 10,000 torches were used for one night, bright enough to shine on the Jinyang Palace like it was the day. Whenever there were natural disastrous, ill omens, or agrarian rebellions, he never blamed himself, but would only hold great vegetarian feasts to treat the Buddhist and Taoist monks, believing that this would bring divine blessings so that difficulties would pass. He liked to play the \" pipa \" and sing, and he wrote a song entitled, \"Song of No Worries\" (\u7121\u6101\u66f2), with several hundred servants singing with him, leading to the people referring to him as \"the Son of Heaven with no worries.\" He established \"the Pauper Boy's Village\" within the Hualin Garden (\u83ef\u6797\u5712), where he would put on pauper clothes and beg in the village, believing that this was great joy. He also built models of the important border cities and had soldiers act like Northern Zhou soldiers to attack them, and with him resisting the attacks with the eunuchs.\"\n\n:\"His favorite servants Lu Lingxuan, Mu Tipo, Gao Anagong, and Han Zhangluan controlled the government. The eunuchs Deng Changyong (\u9127\u9577\u9852) and Chen Dexin (\u9673\u5fb7\u4fe1), and the Xiongnu He Hongzhen (\u4f55\u6d2a\u73cd) also participated in the important decisionmaking. Each of them brought their friends and relatives into the government and promoted them beyond proper bounds. The officials' promotions were all dependent on the amount of bribes they paid; those who submitted bribes were promoted and those who did not were demoted. The judges issue their verdicts depending on bribes as well, with the rich allowed to live and the poor sentenced to death. The officials compete in their corruption and flattery, to the detriment of the people. The servants, such as Liu Taozhi, were promoted to great honors and created princes. Almost 10,000 of such persons as eunuchs, Xiongnu, singers, dancers, magicians, and slaves, received honors beyond propriety. Hundreds of non-members of the imperial Gao clan received creations as princes. The high rank of \"Kaifu\" (\u958b\u5e9c) included more than 1,000, and the rank of \"Yitong\" (\u5100\u540c) was filled innumerably. There were more than 20 generals of the imperial guards. There were tens of imperial attendants. Even dogs, horses, eagles, and hunting cocks received official posts, and were allowed to enjoy the food portions of their salaries. The servants attended the emperor at all times and think of nothing but to please the emperor. A musical can cost over 100 million coins. Later, after the imperial treasury was exhausted, he used the commanderies and counties as awards, giving two to three commanderies or six to seven counties at each time, to allow the servants to auction off the governor and magistrate posts and pocket the proceeds. Therefore, the commandery governors and county magistrates were largely wealthy merchants who find ways to extract and extort from the people, and the people could not live.\"\n\nEmperor Wu of Northern Zhou had long wanted to destroy Northern Qi, and he launched a major attack in fall 575. Several of his generals suggested attacking Jinyang, but he instead attacked Luoyang. However, when he laid siege to the fortress Zhongtan (second character not in Unicode ), it was well-defended by the Northern Qi general Fu Fu (\u5085\u4f0f), and Emperor Wu became ill during the siege and withdrew. During the meantime, however, Chen forces, commanded by Wu, commenced a new attack, putting Pengcheng (\u5f6d\u57ce, in modern Xuzhou , Jiangsu ] ) under siege. (For the rest of Northern Qi's existence, however, Wu would not be able to actually capture Pengcheng.)\n\nIn winter 576, Northern Zhou's Emperor Wu again launched another major attack on Northern Qi, putting Pingyang (\u5e73\u967d, in modern Linfen , Shanxi ) under siege and then capturing it. At the time the news of Northern Zhou's attack on Pingyang arrived, Gao Wei was hunting at Qilian Lake (\u7941\u9023\u6c60, in modern Xinzhou , Shanxi ) with Consort Feng, and Gao Anagong, not believing the matter to be serious, did not report the news to Gao Wei. Only after Pingyang fell did Gao Anagong give Gao Wei the news. Gao Wei gathered his troops and headed for Pingyang, and Emperor Wu, believing Gao Wei's troops to be still strong, withdrew but put the general Liang Shiyan (\u6881\u58eb\u5f65) in charge of defending Pingyang against the Northern Qi counterattack. The Northern Qi forces sieged Pingyang with all effort -- and after several days, were able to breach the wall -- but at this point, Gao Wei stopped his attack and summoned Consort Feng so she could witness the fall of the city. When she arrived, however, Northern Zhou forces had already filled in the breach, and therefore held the city. With Pingyang under siege, Emperor Wu launched another attack to try to lift the siege on Pingyang. Gao Anagong advised against direct faceoff with Emperor Wu's troops, but Gao Wei, egged on by eunuchs, chose to directly engage Emperor Wu, and the armies engaged in a battle around the time of near year 577. A minor fallback by some of Gao Wei's troops caused Consort Feng and Mu Tipo to panick, and they suggested an immediate retreat -- and Gao Wei abandoned his troops and fled to Jinyang, causing his army to collapse.\n\nOnce at Jinyang, instead of preparing for resistance, Gao Wei instead planned to have his cousins Gao Yanzong the Prince of Ande and Gao Xiaoheng (\u9ad8\u5b5d\u73e9) the Prince of Guangning defend Jinyang, planning to himself flee north to Shuo Province, against Gao Yanzong's advice. He first sent Empress Dowager Hu and Gao Heng to Shuo Province. When Northern Zhou forces arrived at Jinyang, he left Jinyang under Gao Yanzong's command and fled, initially intending to flee to Shuo Province or Tujue , but after persuasion by the general Mei Shenglang (\u6885\u52dd\u90ce), headed back to Yecheng, accompanied by Gao Anagong. Meanwhile, Mu Tipo abandoned Gao Wei and surrendered to Northern Zhou. His mother Lady Lu committed suicide, and his family members were all either executed or sentenced to hard labor. Meanwhile, Tang Yong, still at Jinyang, along with other generals, persuaded Gao Yanzong to take the throne himself -- stating to him that if he did not, they could not die for him. When Gao Wei heard this news, he commented, \"I would rather that Bing Province [the province containing Jinyang] fall into Zhou's hands than Ande's hands.\" Soon, Northern Zhou forces put Jinyang under siege, and they were able to breach the defenses at the east gate -- but a counterattack by Gao Yanzong's troops lead to a major rout against Northern Zhou forces, in which Emperor Wu almost died. However, Gao Yanzong's troops went into celebration and could not regroup. The next day, another Northern Zhou attack finally captured the city.\n\nOnce Gao Wei arrived at Yecheng, he ordered that high rewards be posted for people who would join the army, but he himself was unwilling to contribute treasures from his own palace holdings. Further, when he was giving a speech intending to raise morale, his irreverent attitude instead infuriated the generals. The generals and the officials all lost the will to fight. The official Gao Mai (\u9ad8\u52f1), who had escorted Empress Dowager Hu and Crown Prince Heng back from Shuo Province, suggested making one last stand at Yecheng, but Gao Wei did not accept his suggestion. When astrologers indicated that the imperial seat is about to be changed, he decided to pass the throne to Gao Heng and did so in spring 577, even though Gao Heng was only seven years old. Gao Wei himself took the title of \"Taishang Huang\".\n\nAs retired emperor\n\nGao Wei continued to exercise imperial authority, even though Gao Heng was emperor. He honored his mother Empress Dowager Hu as Grand Empress Dowager, while Empress Mu took the title of empress dowager. Meanwhile, the offiical Moduolou Jingxian (\u83ab\u591a\u5a41\u656c\u986f) and the general Wei Xiangyuan (\u5c09\u76f8\u9858) plotted to try to have Gao Anagong killed, and then declare Gao Xiaoheng emperor, but the plot dissolved when the ambush they set in place for Gao Anagong could not be carried out. Meanwhile, Gao Xiaoheng requested an army so that he could resist Northern Zhou, but Gao Anagong and Han Zhangluan, suspecting him of plotting a coup, sent him out to be the governor of Cang Province (\u6ec4\u5dde, roughly modern Cangzhou , Hebei ).\n\nMeanwhile, Gao Wei, receiving news that Northern Zhou forces were about to arrive at Yecheng, decided to abandon Yecheng and head to the provinces south of the Yellow River to organize a resistance -- but that if the resistance would fail, to flee to Chen. He left the general Murong Sanzang (\u6155\u5bb9\u4e09\u85cf) in charge of Yecheng and fled toward Ji Province (\u6fdf\u5dde, roughly modern Liaocheng , Shandong ), where had earlier sent Grand Empress Dowager Hu, Empress Dowager Mu, and the emperor Gao Heng. Once Gao Wei left, Murong Sanzang was unable to defend the city, and it fell.\n\nWhen Gao Wei arrived at Ji Province, he issued an edict in Gao Heng's name further passing the throne to Gao Wei's uncle Gao Jie (\u9ad8\u6e5d) the Prince of Rencheng, sending the edict and the imperial seal to Gao Jie at Ying Province (\u701b\u5dde, roughly modern eastern Baoding , Hebei ) with the official Hul\u00fc Xiaoqing (\u659b\u5f8b\u5b5d\u537f), where Gao Jie was governor. However, instead of delivering the edict and the imperial seals to Gao Jie, Hul\u00fc surrendered to Northern Zhou. Meanwhile, Gao Wei left Grand Empress Dowager Hu and Gao Anagong at Ji Province while further fleeing with Empress Dowager Mu, Consort Feng, Gao Heng, Han, and Deng Changyu further east to Qing Province (\u9752\u5dde, roughly modern Qingzhou , Shandong ). He planned to further flee to Chen, but Gao Anagong, who had been in communications with Northern Zhou forces and was planning to offer Gao Wei as a prize, fed him false information to slow him down. When Northern Zhou forces arrived at Ji Province, Gao Anagong surrendered, allowing Northern Zhou forces to quickly descend on Qing Province. Gao Wei qickly tried to flee, but was captured by the Northern Zhou general Weichi Qin (\u5c09\u9072\u52e4) and delivered back to Yecheng, to Emperor Wu.\n\nDeath\n\nEmperor Wu initially treated Gao Wei with respect, personally greeting him and treating him as an honored guest. Meanwhile, Gao Jie and Gao Xiaoheng made an attempt to resist Northern Zhou at Cang Province, and when Emperor Wu had Gao Wei send an edict to Gao Jie to order his surrender, Gao Jie refused. However, Emperor Wu's brother Yuwen Xian the Prince of Qi quickly defeated Gao Jie and Gao Xiaoheng, capturing them and largely ending resistance, although Gao Wei's cousin Gao Shaoyi the Prince of Fanyang (Emperor Wenxuan's son) fled to Tujue, and Tujue's Tuobo Khan put Gao Shaoyi under his protection and soon had him declare himself Northern Qi's emperor, albeit in exile.\n\nIn summer 577, Emperor Wu returned with Gao Wei, as well as the princes and officials of Northern Qi, putting Gao Wei at the front of the victory procession. He also ceremonially offered Gao Wei and the other captives to the ancestors at the ancestral temple, but did not harm them at this point. He created Gao Wei the Duke of Wen.\n\nIn winter 577, Emperor Wu, apprehensive of the Gao clan, falsely accused Gao Wei of plotting rebellion with Mu Tipo, and then ordered him and other members of the Gao clan to commit suicide. Only Gao Wei's developmentally disabled brother Gao Renying (\u9ad8\u4ec1\u82f1) and mute brother Gao Renya (\u9ad8\u4ec1\u96c5) were spared, but were exiled to modern Sichuan . Only during the regency of Yang Jian over Emperor Wu's grandson Emperor Jing of Northern Zhou were members of the Gao clan, including Gao Wei, properly buried north of Chang'an.\n\nEra names\n\n* \"Tiantong\" (\u5929\u7d71 ti\u0101n t\u01d2ng) 565-569\n\n* \"Wuping\" (\u6b66\u5e73 w\u01d4 p\u00edng) 570-576\n\n* \"Longhua\" (\u9686\u5316 l\u00f3ng hu\u00e0) 576\n\nPersonal information"}, {"url": "https://www.nouahsark.com/en/infocenter/culture/history/monarchs/emperor_xiaozhao_of_northern_qi.php", "page_content": "Emperor Xiaozhao of northern qi ((\u5317)\u9f4a\u5b5d\u662d\u5e1d) (535\u2013561), personal name Gao Yan (\u9ad8\u6f14), courtesy name Yan'an (\u5ef6\u5b89), was an emperor of the Chinese dynasty northern qi. He was generally considered a capable ruler, but ruled for less than two years before dying from injuries suffered from falling off a horse. northern qi would not have another capable ruler after his death.\n\n\n\nEarly life Gao Yan was born in 535, as the third of six sons that Gao Huan, then the paramount general of eastern wei and the Prince of Bohai, had with his wife Princess Lou Zhaojun, after his older brothers Gao Cheng and Gao Yang, and Gao Huan's sixth son overall. He was said to be intelligent in his childhood, and was much favored by his mother Princess Lou. At age three, in 538, he was created the Duke of Changshan. He was said to be studious, particularly favoring the Book of Han in his studies.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring Emperor Wenxuan's reign In 550, Gao Yang, who had become regent of eastern wei following the deaths of Gao Huan in 547 and Gao Cheng in 549, had Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei yield the throne to him, ending eastern wei and starting northern qi as its Emperor Wenxuan. As the new emperor's brother, Gao Yan was created the Prince of Changshan. He received a number of official posts during Emperor Wenxuan's reign, and was said to have distinguished himself in his ability to govern despite his youth, and was known for his solemnity. However, he was also said to be so stern in his ways that if subordinates carried out incorrect actions, he would cane them severely. At times, he participated in military campaigns that Emperor Wenxuan personally commanded.\n\nEmperor Wenxuan ruled northern qi diligently early in his reign, but later in his reign, perhaps starting 554 or so, he began to act erratically and cruelly toward his officials and members of his own household. On one occasion, when invited to one of Emperor Wenxuan's feasts, his face showed sadness and anxiety, and Emperor Wenxuan deduced that he must have disapproved Emperor Wenxuan's preoccupation with drinking and women, and he declared that he would stop drinking\u2014although his abstension from alcohol only lasted for several days. Emperor Wenxuan also favored irreverent and sometimes immoral games within his palace, but when Gao Yan was present he would curb his behavior, and while Emperor Wenxuan was known for often visiting nobles' households and having sexual relations with their women, regardless of their relationships to him, he did not do so as to Gao Yan's household. During this period of Emperor Wenxuan's reign, then, Gao Yan became one of the only few individuals who would dare to try to get the emperor to change his behavior, although often only with temporary effect. On one occasion, Gao Yan offered a petition listing a number of behaviors that he believed Emperor Wenxuan should change\u2014and this caused Emperor Wenxuan to be exceedingly angry at him, threatening to kill him and sentencing Gao Yan's chief advisor, Wang Xi (\u738b\u550f), whom Emperor Wenxuan suspected to have contributed to the petition, to hard labor. In a later incident, Emperor Wenxuan, after having awarded Gao Yan a lady in waiting while drunk, forgot about the award after he became sober, and accused Gao Yan of stealing the lady in waiting, battering Gao Yan severely with a sword hilt. Gao Yan became angry and went on a hunger strike. Emperor Wenxuan, in order to placate Gao Yan, then agreed to release Wang Xi from hard labor and return him to Gao Yan's headquarters. Meanwhile, Emperor Wenxuan, who distrusted eastern wei's Yuan imperial household, of whom Gao Yan's wife Princess Yuan was a member, tried to get Gao Yan to divorce Princess Yuan, but Gao Yan refused, and when Emperor Wenxuan carried out a massacre of the Yuans in 559, it was at Gao Yan's earnest intercession that Emperor Wenxuan spared Princess Yuan's father Yuan Man (\u5143\u883b) and his family.\n\nEmperor Wenxuan's crown prince was his son Gao Yin, who was known for his studiousness, but Emperor Wenxuan, who, despite his Han ethnicity, favored Xianbei warrior ways, felt that Gao Yin was too Han in his thinking and repeatedly considered deposing him. Particularly when he was drunk, Emperor Wenxuan often stated that he would pass the throne to Gao Yan, and he stopped doing so only after being warned by his prime minister Yang Yin that his statements was potentially causing instability.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to his wife Empress Li Zu'e, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne. \" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei.\n\n\n\nDuring Emperor Fei's reign Pursuant to Emperor Wenxuan's will, the government was in the hands of several of his trusted officials -- Yang Yin, Gao Guiyan (\u9ad8\u6b78\u5f65) the Prince of Pingqin, Yan Zixian (\u71d5\u5b50\u737b), and Zheng Yi (\u912d\u9824). Gao Yan, while respected by the people, was not given great power, and while Grand Empress Dowager Lou had some desire to have Gao Yan made emperor instead, there was insufficient support at the time, and Yang, in fear that Gao Yan and another brother of Emperor Wenxuan, Gao Dan the Prince of Changguang, would try to take power, took steps to curb their authorities. Meanwhile, Gao Yan's own supporters, citing the example of the Duke of Zhou, were suggesting to him that he should take power as the young emperor's uncle, and while Gao Yan initially rejected such overtures, he was watching the political scene carefully.\n\nAs Emperor Fei took the throne while he was attending to his father's deathbed at the secondary capital Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi ), when he proceeded to the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei ) in spring 560, it was initially believed that Gao Yan or Gao Dan would be put in charge of Jinyang\u2014then perhaps the most militarily secure city in the empire; instead, by the arrangements of Yang and his associates, the two princes were ordered to accompany the young emperor to Yecheng.\n\nOnce the imperial train arrived at Yecheng, the situation became even more tense, as an associate of Yang's, Kezhuhun Tianhe (\u53ef\u6731\u6e3e\u5929\u548c), was convinced that Emperor Fei would not be safe in his reign unless his two uncles were killed, and alternatively, Yan Zixian considered putting Grand Empress Dowager Lou, who still wielded much power as the clan matriarch, under house arrest, and forcing her to turn her authorities to Empress Dowager Li. Meanwhile, the ambitious Yang was carrying out a governmental reorganization scheme to trim unnecessary offices and titles and to remove incompetent officials. The officials who were hurt by Yang's actions became disaffected and largely hoped that Gao Yan and Gao Dan would take action and began to encourage them to do so. In spring 560, Yang considered sending Gao Yan and Gao Dan outside the capital to be provincial governors, but Emperor Fei initially disagreed. Yang wrote a submission to Empress Dowager Li to ask her to consider, and she consulted her lady in waiting Li Changyi (\u674e\u660c\u5100), who leaked the news to Grand Empress Dowager Lou. She informed the two princes, and they set up an ambush, with Gao Guiyan and the generals Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) and Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1), at a ceremony where Gao Yan was to be named to a ceremonial post. Yang, Kezhuhun, Yan, Zheng, and Song Qindao (\u5b8b\u6b3d\u9053) were all severely battered and captured. Gao Yan and Gao Dan then entered the palace and publicly accused Yang and his associates of crimes; Yang and his associates were executed, and Gao Yan took control of the government. He soon went to take up post at Jinyang, controlling the government remotely.\n\nGao Yan's advisors, headed by Wang Xi and Zhao Yanshen (\u8d99\u5f65\u6df1), then suggested that he take the throne himself\u2014noting to him that his actions in killing Yang and his associates meant that when Emperor Fei was grown, he would never be able to have a cordial relationship with Emperor Fei. Gao Yan agreed, and although initially Grand Empress Dowager Lou found the action inadvisable, she finally agreed. In fall 560, she issued an edict deposing Emperor Fei and making Gao Yan emperor (as Emperor Xiaozhao); however, in the edict, she sternly warned Emperor Xiaozhao to make sure that nothing would happen to Emperor Fei, who was demoted to the rank of Prince of Ji'nan. Grand Empress Dowager Lou became again known as Empress Dowager Lou, while Empress Dowager Li was given the title of Empress Wenxuan.\n\n\n\nReign Emperor Xiaozhao was said to be diligent in his actions, and after he became emperor, he spent all day looking at laws and regulations of Emperor Wenxuan, seeking to revise the laws that were inappropriate or too harsh. He was praised for his diligence, but also criticized for being overly obsessed with details. He was also said to be filial pious toward Empress Dowager Lou and loving to his brothers. One brother who was dissatisfied with him, however, was Gao Dan, whom Emperor Xiaozhao had previously agreed to make crown prince\u2014but who was passed over in favor of Emperor Xiaozhao's own son Gao Bainian, whom Emperor Xiaozhao created crown prince in winter 560, when he also created Princess Yuan empress. He also started long-term strategic planning against rival northern zhou, planning to gradually seize northern zhou territory east of the Yellow River bit by bit. He entrusted much of his decision-making to Wang Xi, Yang Xiuzhi (\u967d\u4f11\u4e4b), and Cui Jie (\u5d14\u52bc), often having them stay in the palace all day to examine the laws and regulations.\n\nIn spring 561, Emperor Xiaozhao had the former liang dynasty general Wang Lin, who had fled to northern qi in 560 after his failed attempt, supported by northern qi, to let Xiao Zhuang rule as Liang's emperor, against chen dynasty and the northern zhou-supported Emperor Xuan of Western Liang, take up position at Hefei (\u5408\u80a5, in modern Hefei , Anhui ), to plan a campaign against Chen. Later, he made Wang the governor of Yang Province (\u63da\u5dde, modern central Anhui ).\n\nEmperor Xiaozhao, throughout his reign, stayed at the secondary capital Jinyang and did not stay at Yecheng, leaving Yecheng in Gao Dan's control. In fall 561, Emperor Xiaozhao, concerned that Gao Dan was becoming too powerful, tried to transfer some of Gao Dan's authority to the general Hul\u00fc Xian (\u659b\u5f8b\u7fa8, Hul\u00fc Jin's son), but Gao Dan refused to transfer any of his authority. Meanwhile, sorcerers informed Emperor Xiaozhao that the imperial aura was still at Yecheng, making Emperor Xiaozhao concerned. Gao Guiyan, who was concerned that Gao Yin would one day take the throne again and retaliate against him, persuaded Emperor Xiaozhao that his nephew had to be removed, and so Emperor Xiaozhao issued an edict to summon the Prince of Ji'nan to Jinyang. Gao Dan, was disappointed at Emperor Xiaozhao not created him crown prince, briefly considered redeclaring Gao Yin emperor and starting a rebellion against Emperor Xiaozhao, but ultimately chose not to do it, as his own sorcerers informed him that they believed that he would become emperor one day anyway. He therefore sent Gao Yin to Jinyang. Soon, Emperor Xiaozhao sent assassins to deliver poisoned wine to Gao Yin. Gao Yin refused to drink it, and the assassins strangled him. Emperor Xiaozhao soon regretted killing his nephew.\n\nIn winter 561, while hunting, Emperor Xiaozhao's horse was spooked by a rabbit, and he fell off the horse and suffered broken ribs. When Empress Dowager Lou came to see him, she asked him where Gao Yin was, and he could not answer. Empress Dowager Lou angrily stated, \"Did you not kill him? Because you did not listen to me, you should die!\" and left without seeing him again. Soon, believing himself to be near death, he issued an edict stating that Gao Bainian was too young to take the throne, and that the throne was instead to be passed to Gao Dan. He also wrote a letter to Gao Dan, stating, \"Bainian is innocent. You can do anything with him, but please do not kill him!\" He died later that day, while lamenting that he was unable to serve his mother for the rest of her life. Gao Dan soon arrived at Jinyang and took the throne (as Emperor Wucheng).\n\n\n\nEra name Huangjian (\u7687\u5efa hu\u00e1ng ji\u00e0n) 560-561\n\n"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/empress-gao-2/", "page_content": "Empress Gao (\u9ad8\u7687\u540e, personal name unknown) was an empress of the Chinese/Xianbei dynasty Eastern Wei \u2014 a branch successor state to Northern Wei.

Chinese historical annals recorded his bloody rages, nevertheless his reign, with assistance from his Chinese advisers, was considered well-administered and effective.\n\nRead more...: Early life As Eastern Wei regent Early reign Late reign Physical appearance Family Ancestry\n\nEarly life\n\nGao Yang was born in 526, while his father Gao Huan was a general under Northern Wei's paramount general Erzhu Rong. His mother Lou Zhaojun was Gao Huan's wife, on whose financial support Gao's early career had relied on. Lou Zhaojun was from a wealthy Xianbei family. He was their second son, after his older brother Gao Cheng. After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became Northern Wei's paramount general, and after Northern Wei divided into Eastern Wei and Western Wei in 534 became the actual power controlling Eastern Wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan (\u592a\u539f\u516c).\n\nGao Yang was not well regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children, though it appears that he feigned this to prevent suspicion of his elder brother. It appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of Eastern Wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent. He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin, to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent\n\nInitially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 8000 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival Liang Dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former Eastern Wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and establishing Northern Qi, with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager.\n\nEarly reign\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised Eastern Wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nJust like his father Gao Huan, Emperor Wenxuan viewed himself as more of a Xianbei rather than Chinese. Further, more than his father did, he was not willing to follow most of the Chinese traditions. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress. Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nIn response to the establishment of Northern Qi, Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of rival Western Wei, launched a major attack on Northern Qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead.\" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to Northern Qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu, Anhui).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang, Shanxi), and he ordered the construction of a great wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi), apparently to defend against Western Wei and Tujue.\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking Northern Qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan\u2014and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put Northern Qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo Yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to Eastern Wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, Northern Qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran, which by that point was near its end, surrendered to Northern Qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within Northern Qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the History of Northern Dynasties, and Sima Guang, the author of the Zizhi Tongjian, saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule\u2014that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality\u2014and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former Northern Wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became Eastern Wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later\u2014and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of Northern Wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (Book of Wei) was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as Huishu (\u7a62\u66f8\u2014the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, Western Wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack Western Wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and Western Wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\nLate reign\n\nWestern Wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang (known in history as the Western Liang), but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang, declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom Eastern Wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against Eastern Wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after Northern Qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between Northern Qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated Northern Qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to Northern Qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to Northern Qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed.)\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, which he converted into a fiddle, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within Northern Qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between Northern Qi and Liang resumed, and Northern Qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, Northern Qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of Northern Wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emperor Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian:\n\n:... Wenxuan drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Sometimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. He often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. ... Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven.\" He beheaded her.\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, his mother Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how she had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners and a saw to be available to the palace guards\u2014if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing Chen Dynasty, and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin, then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei, refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested Northern Qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, Northern Qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a Northern Qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan, Hubei).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unhappy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Zhan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the Northern Wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. In particular, a man named Yuan Huangtou flown off a tower strapped to a kite as part of an experiment of Emperor Wenxuan, the first known case of human flight. He survived but was starved to death in prison. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne.\" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin. Not long after, Gao Yan killed Yang Yin and deposed Gao Yin, becoming emperor.\n\nPhysical appearance\n\nIn the Book of Northern Qi, author Li Baiyao notes that Gao Yang was a dark-skinned man with large and protruding jaws, and that his skin appeared to be abnormally rough.\n\nFamily\n\nConsorts and Issue:\n\n\u2022 Empress Zhaoxin, of the Li clan of Zhao (\u662d\u4fe1\u7687\u540e \u8d99\u90e1\u674e\u6c0f), personal name Zu'e (\u7956\u5a25)\n\n\u2022 Gao Yin, Prince Jinan Mindao (\u6fdf\u5357\u610d\u60bc\u738b \u9ad8\u6bb7; 545\u2013561), first son\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaode, Prince Taiyuan (\u592a\u539f\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u5fb7; 548\u2013562), second son\n\n\u2022 Princess Changle (\u9577\u6a02\u516c\u4e3b), personal name Baode (\u5bf6\u5fb7)\n\n\u2022 Married Wei Shibian (\u5c09\u4e16\u8faf)\n\n\u2022 Princess Yining (\u7fa9\u5be7\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Hul\u00fc Wudu (\u659b\u5f8b\u6b66\u90fd; d. 572), the first son of Hul\u00fc Guang\n\n\u2022 Furen, of the Yan clan (\u5f18\u5fb7\u592b\u4eba \u984f\u6c0f; 530\u2013576), personal name Yuguang (\u7389\u5149)\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaolian, Prince Longxi (\u96b4\u897f\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u5ec9; 553\u2013577), fifth son\n\n\u2022 Pin, of the Pei clan (\u5b2a \u88f4\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaoren, Prince Xihe (\u897f\u6cb3\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u4ec1; d. 577), fourth son\n\n\u2022 Pin, of the Xue clan (\u5b2a \u859b\u6c0f; d. 555)\n\n\u2022 A daughter\n\n\u2022 Shifu, of the Feng clan (\u4e16\u5a66 \u99ae\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaoyi, Prince Fanyang (\u8303\u967d\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u7fa9; d. 580), third son\n\n\u2022 Unknown\n\n\u2022 Princess Zhongshan (\u4e2d\u5c71\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Duan Baoding of Wuwei (\u6b66\u5a01 \u6bb5\u5bf6\u9f0e)\n\nAncestry"}, {"url": "https://www.nouahsark.com/en/infocenter/culture/history/monarchs/emperor_wenxuan_of_northern_qi.php", "page_content": "Emperor Wenxuan of (Northern) Qi ((\u5317)\u9f4a\u6587\u5ba3\u5e1d) (529\u2013559), personal name Gao Yang (\u9ad8\u6d0b), courtesy name Zijin (\u5b50\u9032), was the first emperor of the Chinese dynasty northern qi. He was the second son of eastern wei's paramount general Gao Huan, and the death of his brother and Gao Huan's designated successor Gao Cheng in 549 became the regent of eastern wei. In 550, he forced Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei to yield the throne to him, ending eastern wei and starting northern qi.\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for attentiveness to military matters, and the strength of the northern qi military was at its prime. He also tried to equalize the tax burden and reduce corruption by offering officials sufficient salary. He entrusted most governmental matters to the capable Yang Yin, and for a while, the government was effective, and the military was strong. However, Emperor Wenxuan eventually turned cruel, and his erratic behavior, fueled by alcoholism, plunged his administration into chaos.\n\n\n\nEarly life Gao Yang was born in 529, while his father Gao Huan was a Han chinese general under northern wei's paramount general Erzhu Rong. His mother Lou Zhaojun was Gao Huan's wife, on whose financial support Gao's early career had relied on. Lou Zhaojun was an ethnic Xianbei. He was their second son, after his older brother Gao Cheng. After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became northern wei's paramount general, and after northern wei divided into eastern wei and western wei in 534 became the actual power controlling eastern wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan.\n\nGao Yang was not well regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children. However, it appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of eastern wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent. He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei ), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin, to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\n\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent Initially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 200 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi ), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival liang dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former eastern wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi ), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending eastern wei and establishing northern qi, with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager.\n\n\n\nEarly reign Early in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised eastern wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nWhile Emperor Wenxuan was ethnically Han, like his father Gao Huan, he viewed himself as Xianbei rather than Han. Further, more than his father did, he looked down on Han traditions, not willing to follow them. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress. Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nIn response to the establishment of northern qi, Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of rival western wei, launched a major attack on northern qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead. \" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to northern qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu ) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu, Anhui ).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang, Shanxi ), and he ordered the construction of a Great Wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi ), apparently to defend against western wei and Tujue.\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking northern qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan\u2014and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put northern qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to eastern wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, northern qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran, which by that point was near its end, surrendered to northern qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within northern qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi ).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the History of Northern Dynasties, and Sima Guang, the author of the Zizhi Tongjian, saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule\u2014that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality\u2014and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former northern wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became eastern wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later\u2014and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body thrown into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of northern wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (Book of Wei) was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as Huishu (\u7a62\u66f8\u2014the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, western wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei ), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack western wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei ) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and western wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\n\n\nLate reign western wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang, but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang, declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom eastern wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against eastern wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after northern qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between northern qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu ), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated northern qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to northern qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to northern qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed. )\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within northern qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between northern qi and Liang resumed, and northern qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, northern qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of northern wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emperor Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian: . . . [Emperor Wenxuan] drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Sometimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. He often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. . . . Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven. \" He beheaded her.\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how he had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners to be available to the palace guards\u2014if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing chen dynasty, and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin, then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei , refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested northern qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, northern qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a northern qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan, Hubei ).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unhappy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Dan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the northern wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne. \" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/3747792", "page_content": "Emperor Wenxuan of (Northern) Qi ((\u5317)\u9f4a\u6587\u5ba3\u5e1d) (529-559), personal name Gao Yang (\u9ad8\u6d0b), courtesy name Zijin (\u5b50\u9032), was the first emperor of the Chinese dynasty Northern Qi .

He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan , Hebei ), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin , to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent\n\nInitially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 200 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan , Shanxi ), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival Liang Dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former Eastern Wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong , Shanxi ), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and establishing Northern Qi , with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager .\n\nEarly reign\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised Eastern Wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nWhile Emperor Wenxuan was ethnically Han, like his father Gao Huan, he viewed himself as Xianbei rather than Han. Further, more than his father did, he looked down on Han traditions, not willing to follow them. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress . Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince .\n\nIn response to the establishment of Northern Qi, Yuwen Tai , the paramount general of rival Western Wei, launched a major attack on Northern Qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead.\" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to Northern Qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian , whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou , Jiangsu ) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu , Anhui ).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang , Shanxi ), and he ordered the construction of a great wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou , Shanxi ), apparently to defend against Western Wei and Tujue .\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking Northern Qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan -- and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put Northern Qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to Eastern Wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, Northern Qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran , which by that point was near its end, surrendered to Northern Qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within Northern Qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou , Shanxi ).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the \" History of Northern Dynasties \", and Sima Guang , the author of the \" Zizhi Tongjian \", saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule -- that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality -- and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former Northern Wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became Eastern Wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later -- and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body thrown into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of Northern Wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (\" Book of Wei \") was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as \"Huishu\" (\u7a62\u66f8 -- the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, Western Wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou , Hubei ), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack Western Wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan , Hubei ) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and Western Wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\nLate reign\n\nWestern Wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang, but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang , declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom Eastern Wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against Eastern Wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after Northern Qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between Northern Qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang , Jiangsu ), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated Northern Qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to Northern Qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to Northern Qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed.)\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within Northern Qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between Northern Qi and Liang resumed, and Northern Qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, Northern Qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of Northern Wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emepror Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his \"Zizhi Tongjian\":\n\n:\"... [Emperor Wenxuan] drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Soemtimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. he often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. ... Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven.\" He beheaded her.\"\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how he had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners to be available to the palace guards -- if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing Chen Dynasty , and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin , then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei , refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested Northern Qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, Northern Qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a Northern Qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan , Hubei ).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unahppy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Dan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the Northern Wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne.\" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin.\n\nEra name\n\n* \"Tianbao\" (\u5929\u4fdd ti\u0101n b\u01ceo) 550-559\n\nPersonal information"}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Emperor_Wenxuan_of_Northern_Qi", "page_content": "What we do.

He was the second son of the Eastern Wei's paramount general Gao Huan. Following the death of his brother and Gao Huan's designated successor an eldest son Gao Cheng in 549, Gao Yang became the regent of Eastern Wei. In 550, he forced the Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei to yield the throne to him, ending the Eastern Wei dynasty and starting the Northern Qi dynasty.\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for attentiveness to military matters, and the strength of the Northern Qi military was at its prime. He also tried to equalize the tax burden and reduce corruption by offering officials sufficient salary. He entrusted most governmental matters to the capable Yang Yin, and for a while, the government was effective, and the military was strong. In his later years, Emperor Wenxuan suffered from alcoholism and possibly insanity.[5] Chinese historical annals recorded his bloody rages. Nevertheless, his reign, with assistance from his advisers, was considered well-administered and effective.[6]\n\nYouTube Encyclopedic\n\n1 / 5 Views: 814 22 901 7 988 14 612 4 584\n\nHow Terrible Was Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi (526\u2013559)? #shorts\n\nHistory of Northern Dynasties (China) : Every Year (Map in Chinese Version)\n\nThe Ruthless Rulers of Ancient China\n\nRise of the Gokturks VI: From Huns to Chinese - Turco-Mongols in Northern China\n\n\u5357\u5317\u671d: \u4e09\u767e\u5e74\u4e82\u4e16\u7684\u6700\u7d42\u7ae0 | TWILIGHT SAY \u5fae\u660e\u8aaa (2022) Transcription\n\nEarly life\n\nGao Yang was born in 526, while his father Gao Huan was a general under Northern Wei's paramount general Erzhu Rong. His mother Lou Zhaojun was Gao Huan's wife, on whose financial support Gao's early career had relied on. Lou Zhaojun was from a wealthy Xianbei family.[7] He was their second son, after his older brother Gao Cheng. After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became Northern Wei's paramount general, and after Northern Wei divided into Eastern Wei and Western Wei in 534 became the actual power controlling Eastern Wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan (\u592a\u539f\u516c).\n\nGao Yang was not well regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children, though it appears that he feigned this to prevent suspicion of his elder brother. It appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of Eastern Wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent. He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin, to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent\n\nInitially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 8000 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival Liang Dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former Eastern Wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and establishing Northern Qi, with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager.\n\nEarly reign\n\nNorthern Qi shieldbearer\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised Eastern Wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nJust like his father Gao Huan, Emperor Wenxuan viewed himself as more of a Xianbei rather than Chinese. Further, more than his father did, he was not willing to follow most of the Chinese traditions. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress. Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nIn response to the establishment of Northern Qi, Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of rival Western Wei, launched a major attack on Northern Qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead.\" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to Northern Qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu, Anhui).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang, Shanxi), and he ordered the construction of a great wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi), apparently to defend against Western Wei and Tujue.\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking Northern Qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan\u2014and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put Northern Qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo Yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to Eastern Wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, Northern Qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran, which by that point was near its end, surrendered to Northern Qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within Northern Qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the History of Northern Dynasties, and Sima Guang, the author of the Zizhi Tongjian, saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule\u2014that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality\u2014and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former Northern Wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became Eastern Wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later\u2014and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of Northern Wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (Book of Wei) was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as Huishu (\u7a62\u66f8\u2014the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, Western Wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack Western Wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and Western Wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\nLate reign\n\nWestern Wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang (known in history as the Western Liang), but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang, declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom Eastern Wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against Eastern Wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after Northern Qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between Northern Qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated Northern Qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to Northern Qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to Northern Qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed.)\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, which he converted into a fiddle, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within Northern Qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between Northern Qi and Liang resumed, and Northern Qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, Northern Qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of Northern Wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emperor Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian:\n\n... [Emperor Wenxuan] drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Sometimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. He often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. ... Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven.\" He beheaded her.\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, his mother Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how she had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners and a saw to be available to the palace guards\u2014if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing Chen Dynasty, and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin, then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei, refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested Northern Qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, Northern Qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a Northern Qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan, Hubei).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unhappy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Zhan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the Northern Wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. In particular, a man named Yuan Huangtou flown off a tower strapped to a kite as part of an experiment of Emperor Wenxuan, the first known case of human flight. He survived but was starved to death in prison. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne.\" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin. Not long after, Gao Yan killed Yang Yin and deposed Gao Yin, becoming emperor.\n\nPhysical appearance\n\nIn the Book of Northern Qi, author Li Baiyao notes that Gao Yang was a dark-skinned man with large and protruding jaws, and that his skin appeared to be abnormally rough.\n\nFamily\n\nConsorts and Issue:\n\nEmpress Zhaoxin, of the Li clan of Zhao ( \u662d\u4fe1\u7687\u540e \u8d99\u90e1\u674e\u6c0f ), personal name Zu'e ( \u7956\u5a25 ) Gao Yin, Prince Jinan Mindao ( \u6fdf\u5357\u610d\u60bc\u738b \u9ad8\u6bb7 ; 545\u2013561), first son Gao Shaode, Prince Taiyuan ( \u592a\u539f\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u5fb7 ; 548\u2013562), second son Princess Changle ( \u9577\u6a02\u516c\u4e3b ), personal name Baode ( \u5bf6\u5fb7 ) Married Wei Shibian ( \u5c09\u4e16\u8faf ) Princess Yining ( \u7fa9\u5be7\u516c\u4e3b ) Married Hul\u00fc Wudu ( \u659b\u5f8b\u6b66\u90fd ; d. 572), the first son of Hul\u00fc Guang\n\n), personal name Zu'e ( ) Furen , of the Yan clan ( \u5f18\u5fb7\u592b\u4eba \u984f\u6c0f ; 530\u2013576), personal name Yuguang ( \u7389\u5149 ) Gao Shaolian, Prince Longxi ( \u96b4\u897f\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u5ec9 ; 553\u2013577), fifth son\n\n, of the Yan clan ( ; 530\u2013576), personal name Yuguang ( ) Pin , of the Pei clan ( \u5b2a \u88f4\u6c0f ) Gao Shaoren, Prince Xihe ( \u897f\u6cb3\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u4ec1 ; d. 577), fourth son\n\n, of the Pei clan ( ) Pin , of the Xue clan ( \u5b2a \u859b\u6c0f ; d. 555) A daughter\n\n, of the Xue clan ( ; d. 555) Shifu , of the Feng clan ( \u4e16\u5a66 \u99ae\u6c0f ) Gao Shaoyi, Prince Fanyang ( \u8303\u967d\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u7fa9 ; d. 580), third son\n\n, of the Feng clan ( ) Unknown Princess Zhongshan ( \u4e2d\u5c71\u516c\u4e3b ) Married Duan Baoding of Wuwei ( \u6b66\u5a01 \u6bb5\u5bf6\u9f0e )\n\n\n\nAncestry\n\nGao Hu Gao Mi (428\u2013472) Lady Murong Gao Shusheng (472\u2013526) Shusun Chong Lady Shusun of Henan Gao Huan (496\u2013547) Empress Wenmu (d. 496) Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi (526\u2013559) Lou Ti Lou Neigan Empress Wuming (501\u2013562)\n\nNotes\n\n^ Although both Book of Northern Qi and History of Northern Dynasties said Emperor Wenxuan died at 30, History of Northern Dynasties also said that Emperor Wenxuan was born at a Year of the Horse, intending his birth year was 526 rather than 529 which was a Year of the Rooster; Book of Northern Qi also mentioned that when Gao Yang was in infancy, Gao Huan was so poor that he and his relatives would suffer cold and hunger, but around 529 Gao Huan had already been the prefect of Jin thus could not still stay poor. So the birth year of Gao Yang should be 526, not 529.\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nSources"}, {"url": "https://www.nouahsark.com/en/infocenter/culture/history/dynasty/northern_qi.php", "page_content": "The Northern Qi Dynasty (simplified Chinese: \u5317\u9f50\u671d; traditional Chinese: \u5317\u9f4a\u671d; pinyin: B\u011bi Q\u00ed Ch\u00e1o) was one of the Northern dynasties of Chinese history and ruled northern China from 550 to 577.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Chinese state of Northern Qi was the successor state of the Chinese/Xianbei state of eastern wei and was founded by Emperor Wenxuan. Emperor Wenxuan had a Han Chinese father Gao Yang, and a Xianbei mother, Empress Dowager Lou Zhaojun. As eastern wei's paramount general Gao Huan was succeeded by his sons Gao Cheng and Gao Yang, who took the throne from Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei in 550 and established Northern Qi as its Emperor Wenxuan.\n\nAlthough Northern Qi was plagued by violence and/or incompetent emperors (Emperor Wenxuan, Emperor Wucheng, and Gao Wei), corrupt officials, and deteriorating armies for most of its existence, it was the strongest state of the three main Chinese states (along with northern zhou dynasty state and chen dynasty) when it was established.\n\nLike most imperial dynasties, it gradually declined and was destroyed by northern zhou dynasty in 577. Emperor Wenxuan's son Gao Shaoyi, the Prince of Fanyang, under protection by Tujue, later declared himself the emperor of Northern Qi in exile, but was turned over by Tujue to northern zhou dynasty in 580 and exiled to modern Sichuan . It is a matter of controversy whether Gao Shaoyi should properly be considered a Northern Qi emperor, but in any case the year 577 is generally considered by historians as the ending date for Northern Qi."}, {"url": "https://www.primidi.com/emperor_wenxuan_of_northern_qi/early_reign", "page_content": "Early Reign\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised Eastern Wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nWhile Emperor Wenxuan was ethnically Han, like his father Gao Huan, he viewed himself as Xianbei rather than Han. Further, more than his father did, he looked down on Han traditions, not willing to follow them. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress. Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nIn response to the establishment of Northern Qi, Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of rival Western Wei, launched a major attack on Northern Qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead.\" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to Northern Qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu, Anhui).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang, Shanxi), and he ordered the construction of a great wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi), apparently to defend against Western Wei and Tujue.\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking Northern Qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan\u2014and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put Northern Qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to Eastern Wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, Northern Qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran, which by that point was near its end, surrendered to Northern Qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within Northern Qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the History of Northern Dynasties, and Sima Guang, the author of the Zizhi Tongjian, saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule\u2014that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality\u2014and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former Northern Wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became Eastern Wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later\u2014and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body thrown into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of Northern Wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (Book of Wei) was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as Huishu (\u7a62\u66f8\u2014the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, Western Wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack Western Wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and Western Wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan."}, {"url": "https://www.liquisearch.com/emperor_wenxuan_of_northern_qi/late_reign", "page_content": "Late Reign\n\nWestern Wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang, but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang, declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom Eastern Wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against Eastern Wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after Northern Qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between Northern Qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated Northern Qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to Northern Qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to Northern Qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed.)\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within Northern Qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between Northern Qi and Liang resumed, and Northern Qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, Northern Qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of Northern Wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emperor Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian:\n\n... drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Sometimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. He often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. ... Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven.\" He beheaded her.\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how he had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners to be available to the palace guards\u2014if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing Chen Dynasty, and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin, then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei, refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested Northern Qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, Northern Qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a Northern Qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan, Hubei).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unhappy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Dan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the Northern Wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne.\" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/empress-gao-2/", "page_content": "Empress Gao (\u9ad8\u7687\u540e, personal name unknown) was an empress of the Chinese/Xianbei dynasty Eastern Wei \u2014 a branch successor state to Northern Wei.

In 539, Gao Huan married her to Emperor Xiaojing. It is not known whether Emperor Xiaojing's only son known by name, Yuan Zhangren (\u5143\u9577\u4ec1), who was created crown prince in 549, was her son or not.

He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan, and created the former Empress Gao the Princess Taiyuan, and she therefore carried double titles. Fearful that her brother, who was known for his violent nature, would harm her husband, she took her husband wherever she went, and she also tasted all of his food to make sure that it was not poisoned. Despite her precautions, however, she could not prevent his death, as around the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan invited her to the palace for a feast, and then, as she was attending the feast, he sent assassins to force the Prince of Zhongshan and his three sons to drink poisoned wine.\n\nLater in 552, Emperor Wenxuan married the Princess Taiyuan to one of his officials, Yang Yin. That was the last reference to her in history, and it is not known whether she survived to 560, when Yang was killed by another brother of hers, Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan in a power struggle."}, {"url": "https://www.nouahsark.com/en/infocenter/culture/history/monarchs/emperor_wen_of_western_wei.php", "page_content": "Emperor Wen of western wei ((\u897f)\u9b4f\u6587\u5e1d) (507\u2013551), personal name Yuan Baoju (\u5143\u5bf6\u70ac), was an emperor of the Chinese/Xianbei state western wei -- a branch successor state to northern wei. In 534, Yuan Baoju, then the Prince of Nanyang, followed his cousin Emperor Xiaowu in fleeing from the capital Luoyang to Chang'an, after a fallout between Emperor Xiaowu and the paramount general Gao Huan. However, Emperor Xiaowu's relationship to the general that he then depended on, Yuwen Tai, soon deteriorated as well, and around the new year 535, Yuwen Tai poisoned Emperor Xiaowu to death, making Yuan Baoju emperor (as Emperor Wen). As Gao Huan had, late in 534, made Yuan Shanjian the son of Emperor Wen's cousin Yuan Dan (\u5143\u4eb6) the Prince of Qinghe emperor (as Emperor Xiaojing), thus establishing eastern wei, Emperor Wen was known as western wei's first emperor, formalizing the division. Emperor Wen's relationship with Yuwen appeared cordial, but he was unable to exercise much real power.\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground Yuan Baoju was born in 507. His father Yuan Yu (\u5143\u6109), the Prince of Jingzhao, was the son of Emperor Xiaowen and a younger brother of the reigning Emperor Xuanwu. His mother was recorded as Yuan Yu's concubine Lady Yang. (Some historical records indicate that Lady Li was initially surnamed Yang, and only became known as Lady Li after Yuan Yu, wanting her to be part of a prominent family, had the aristocratic family Li adopt her. ) He had three other brothers, at least one of whom, Yuan Baoyue (\u5143\u5bf6\u6708), was older, and born of Lady Li.\n\nYuan Yu favored Lady Li but not his wife, Princess Yu, a sister to Emperor Xuanwu's wife Empress Yu. Consequently, Empress Yu once summoned Lady Li to the palace, beat her severely, and then forced her to become a Buddhist nun. Only after the intercession of Empress Yu's father Yu Jing (\u4e8e\u52c1) was Lady Li returned to Yuan Yu. Meanwhile, in 508, Yuan Yu himself was punished by Emperor Xuanwu for corruption. He was caned 50 times and demoted to the governorship of Ji Province (\u5180\u5dde, modern central Hebei ). In anger, he rebelled at the capital of Ji Province, Xindu (\u4fe1\u90fd, in modern Hengshui, Hebei ), alleging falsely that Emperor Xuanwu's uncle Gao Zhao had murdered the emperor and declaring himself emperor. Yuan Yu's rebellion was soon defeated by the general Li Ping (\u674e\u5e73), and during his being delivered to the capital Luoyang, Gao had him killed. At that time, Lady Li was pregnant, and she was permitted to give birth and then was executed. Emperor Xuanwu did not execute any of Yuan Yu's sons, but had them, including Yuan Baoju, put under arrest at Zongzheng Temple (\u5b97\u6b63\u5bfa). Assuming that Lady Li and Lady Yang were in fact the same person, this also meant that Yuan Baoju grew up without either parent. He and his brothers remained at Zongzheng Temple and were released only after Emperor Xuanwu's death in 515. During the reign of Emperor Xuanwu's son Emperor Xiaoming, Emperor Xiaoming's mother Empress Dowager Hu posthumously recreated Yuan Yu the Prince of Lintao, and Yuan Baoju and his brothers then observed a mourning period for their parents. Yuan Baoyue inherited the title, but Yuan Baoju did not possess any titles at the moment, although he was made a general. Despite Empress Dowager Hu's rehabiilitation of Yuan Yu, however, Yuan Baoju was not impressed at her toleration of corruption, particularly by her lovers, and he secretly plotted with Emperor Xiaoming to have her lovers killed. When this plot was discovered, he was stripped of the office he held. In 525, he married his wife Lady Yifu, the daughter of a moderately prominent aristocratic family. (In his youth, Yuan Baoju was described by the Book of Wei as frivolous, alcoholic, and sexually immoral, but this description is highly suspect in that the Book of Wei was written by Wei Shou, an official of eastern wei, the rival of western wei, for which Yuan Baoju would eventually become emperor. ) In 528, Emperor Xiaoming created him the Marquess of Shao County, and in 530, Emperor Xiaozhuang created him the Prince of Nanyang.\n\nIn 532, after several years of civil war, the victorious general Gao Huan made Yuan Baoju's cousin Yuan Xiu the Prince of Pingyang emperor (as Emperor Xiaowu). Emperor Xiaowu was not happy about Gao's hold on the military, and he entered into alliances with the independent generals Yuwen Tai and Heba Sheng (\u8cc0\u62d4\u52dd), seeking to resist Gao's control. Yuan Baoju served in Emperor Xiaowu's administration as a general. In 534, Emperor Xiaowu planned to act against Gao, but Gao discovered his plan and instead marched on Luoyang. Emperor Xiaowu decided to flee to Yuwen's territory, and Yuan Baoju accompanied Emperor Xiaowu in doing so, arriving at Chang'an in late 534. Also accompanying Emperor Xiaowu was Yuan Baoju's sister Yuan Mingyue (\u5143\u660e\u6708) -- who was in an incestuous relationship with Emperor Xiaowu. Yuwen did not tolerate Emperor Xiaowu's incestuous relationships with Yuan Mingyue and two other cousins, and eventually he had Yuan Mingyue killed. Emperor Xiaowu became angry, and his relationship with Yuwen deteriorated. Around the new year 535, Yuwen poisoned him to death.\n\nInitially, Yuwen was poised to make Emperor Xiaowu's nephew Yuan Zan (\u5143\u8d0a) the Prince of Guangping the new emperor. However, under suggestion of Yuan Shun (\u5143\u9806) the Prince of Puyang, who argued that Yuan Zan was too young, Yuwen changed his mind and made Yuan Baoju, then 27, emperor instead (as Emperor Wen). As Gao had earlier declared Yuan Shanjian, the son of Yuan Baoju's cousin Yuan Dan (\u5143\u4eb6) the Prince of Qinghe, emperor, Gao's territory became known as eastern wei, with Yuan Shanjian (Emperor Xiaojing) as emperor, and Yuwen's territory became known as western wei, with Emperor Wen as emperor.\n\n\n\nReign Yuwen Tai publicly deferred to Emperor Wen on most matters, but Yuwen held actual power, with Emperor Wen not being able to exercise much independent authority. Throughout the early years of his reign, there were serious doubts as to whether western wei would survive, as eastern wei was then the much stronger state, and Gao Huan made repeated attempts to conquer western wei. However, with Yuwen and other generals capably defending the territory, western wei was able to withstand Gao's assaults.\n\nIn 535, Emperor Wen posthumously honored his father Yuan Yu as Emperor Wenjing, and he posthumously honored his mother Lady Yang as empress. He created his wife Princess Yifu empress, and her son Yuan Qin crown prince. His marriage with Empress Yifu was said to be a happy one, as she was virtuous and beautiful, and Emperor Wen respected her greatly. She bore him 12 children, although only Yuan Qin and Yuan Wu (\u5143\u620a) the Prince of Wudu survived infancy.\n\nIn 538, with western wei under the threat of attack by Rouran, Yuwen first tried to alleviate the situation by marrying a daughter of a member of the imperial clan to Yujiul\u00fc Tahan (\u90c1\u4e45\u95ad\u5854\u5bd2), the brother of Rouran's Chiliantoubingdoufa Khan Yujiul\u00fc Anagui, but then, believing that to be insufficient, he asked Emperor Wen to divorce Empress Yifu and marry Yujiul\u00fc Anagui's daughter. Emperor Wen agreed, and divorced Empress Yifu, making her a Buddhist nun. He then married Yujiul\u00fc Anagui's daughter and created her empress. For a while, this brought peace with Rouran.\n\nLater in 538, with western wei then (temporariily) controlling the old northern wei capital Luoyang, but with Luoyang under attack, Emperor Wen (who had wanted to visit the imperial ancestral tombs in Luoyang) and Yuwen led troops to reinforce Luoyang's defenses, leaving the official Zhou Huida (\u5468\u60e0\u9054) and Crown Prince Qin in Chang'an. However, with the forces engaged in battle, Emperor Wen eventually became stuck at Hengnong (\u6046\u8fb2, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan ), when Chang'an was taken by rebelling former eastern wei troops who had been taken captive previously by western wei, forcing Zhou and Crown Prince Qin to flee as well. Yuwen was eventually able to disengage after abandoning Luoyang, and he put down the rebellion, allowing Emperor Wen to return to Chang'an.\n\nAlthough the former Empress Yifu had been deposed and made a Buddhist nun, Empress Yujiul\u00fc was still not happy about her presence in the capital. in 540, Emperor Wen therefore made Yuan Wu the governor of Qin Province (\u79e6\u5dde, roughly modern Tianshui, Gansu ), and had Empress Yifu accompany Yuan Wu to Qin Province. However, because he still hoped to welcome her back to the palace one day, he secretly told her to keep her hair uncut, rather than shaved like a Buddhist nun. At this time, however, Rouran made a major attack on western wei, and many officials thought that the attack was on behalf of Empress Yujiul\u00fc. Emperor Wen felt compelled to order Empress Yifu to commit suicide, and he did. Soon thereafter, Empress Yujiul\u00fc, who was pregnant, died during childbirth.\n\nIn 548, Yuwen and Yuan Qin were on a grand tour of the provinces when Emperor Wen grew ill, and when they heard the news, Yuwen returned to Chang'an quickly, although by the time they returned, Emperor Wen had recovered.\n\nIn 549, Emperor Wen issued an edict\u2014probably as Yuwen requested\u2014ordering that the names of the ethnic Xianbei, changed to Han names during the reign of Emperor Xiaowen, be changed back to the original Xianbei names.\n\nIn 550, Gao Huan's son Gao Yang forced eastern wei's Emperor Xiaojing to yield the throne to him, ending eastern wei and starting northern qi (as its Emperor Wenxuan). Emperor Wen therefore became the only claimant to the northern wei throne. Yuwen, declaring northern qi a rebel state, launched a major attack, but Gao Yang himself commanded a large army to defend against the attack, and western wei not only did not make gains, but lost a number of provinces to northern qi.\n\nIn 551, Emperor Wen died and was buried with honors due an emperor, with Empress Yujiul\u00fc, although eventually Empress Yifu was buried with him. (It is not clear whether she displaced Empress Yujiul\u00fc or not. ) Yuan Qin succeeded him (as Emperor Fei).\n\n\n\nEra names Datong (\u5927\u7d71 d\u00e0 t\u01d2ng) 535-551\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.nouahsark.com/en/infocenter/culture/history/monarchs/emperor_fei_of_northern_qi.php", "page_content": "Emperor Fei of northern qi ((\u5317)\u9f4a\u5ee2\u5e1d) (545\u2013561), personal name Gao Fei (\u9ad8\u6bb7), courtesy name Zhengdao (\u6b63\u9053), posthumously Prince Mindao of Ji'nan (\u6fdf\u5357\u9594\u60bc\u738b), was briefly an emperor of the Chinese dynasty northern qi. He was the oldest son of the first emperor, Emperor Wenxuan (Gao Yang), and he became emperor after Emperor Wenxuan's death in 559. However, in his young age, the officials fought over power, and in 560, Emperor Fei's uncle Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan killed the prime minister Yang Yin and took over power, soon deposing Emperor Fei and taking the throne himself as Emperor Xiaozhao. in 561, fearful of prophecies that Emperor Fei would return to the throne, Emperor Xiaozhao had him put to death.\n\nBackground Gao Yin was born in 545, when his father Gao Yang, then the Duke of Taiyuan, was not viewed as an important figure in eastern wei's governmental structure, as while Gao Yang's father Gao Huan was the paramount general of the state, Gao Huan's heir apparent was not Gao Yang but Gao Yang's older brother Gao Cheng. Gao Yin's mother was Gao Yang's wife, the ethnically Han Li Zu'e, who carried the title the Duchess of Taiyuan, who subsequently gave birth to another son, Gao Shaode (\u9ad8\u7d39\u5fb7).\n\nIn 547, Gao Huan died, and Gao Cheng became effective regent of eastern wei, dominating the political scene, and he soon considered taking the throne from Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei. However, while preparing, he was assassinated by his slave Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac) in 549. In the aftermaths of Gao Cheng's death, Gao Yang, as the next oldest son of Gao Huan, took control of the eastern wei government. In 550, then bearing the title of Prince of Qi, had Emperor Xiaojing yield the throne to him, ending eastern wei and establishing northern qi as its Emperor Wenxuan. Despite the opposition of some officials (based on her Han ethnicity), Emperor Wenxuan created his wife Princess Li empress and created Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nGao Yin was considered intelligent and considerate as a child. For example, when he held feasts at the North Palace, he would invite his cousins, but he would not invite Gao Cheng's son Gao Xiaowan (\u9ad8\u5b5d\u742c), because Gao Cheng died in the North Palace, and so he did not want Gao Xiaowan to feast at his father's death place. Another episode mentioned by the Book of northern qi involved Gao Yin's being greatly impressed by the sexually moral official Xu Sanchou (\u8a31\u6563\u6101) that he awarded Xu a great amount of silk. (It may very well be that the story was recorded as a veiled praise for Gao Yin's being himself sexually moral, as compared to his sexually promiscuous father and uncles. )\n\nHowever, Emperor Wenxuan, who was violent and military-minded and who disfavored Han ways, felt that Gao Yin was too meek and considered deposing him. On one occasion, Emperor Wenxuan, who was accustomed to personally executing condemned prisoners inside the palace, ordered Gao Yin to carry out the execution. Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and, in anger, Emperor Wenxuan battered him with the handle of a whip. Since that incident, Gao Yin was recorded as suffering from a panic disorder, at times unable to speak and at times behaving erratically. At times, when the alcoholic Emperor Wenxuan was drunk, he would declare that he might eventually give the throne instead to Gao Yin's uncle Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, further leading to questions of succession.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne. \" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei.\n\nReign Pursuant to Emperor Wenxuan's will, the government was in the hands of several of his trusted officials -- Yang Yin the Prince of Kaifeng, Gao Guiyan (\u9ad8\u6b78\u5f65) the Prince of Pingqin, Yan Zixian (\u71d5\u5b50\u737b), and Zheng Yi (\u912d\u9824). Gao Yan, while respected by the people, was not given great power, and while his (and Emperor Wenxuan's) mother Empress Dowager Lou Zhaojun had some desire to have Gao Yan made emperor instead, there was insufficient support at the time, and Yang, in fear that Gao Yan and another brother of Emperor Wenxuan, Gao Dan the Prince of Changguang, would try to take power, took steps to curb their authorities. Emperor Fei honored his grandmother Empress Dowager Lou as grand empress dowager and mother Empress Li as empress dowager. Pursuant to his edicts, the palace construction projects that Emperor Wenxuan started, which caused much misery for his people in the latter years of his reign, were halted.\n\nAs Emperor Fei took the throne while he was attending to his father's deathbed at the secondary capital Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi ), when he proceeded to the capital Yecheng in spring 560, it was initially believed that Gao Yan or Gao Dan would be put in charge of Jinyang\u2014then perhaps the most militarily secure city in the empire; instead, by the arrangements of Yang and his associates, the two princes were ordered to accompany the young emperor to Yecheng.\n\nOnce the imperial train arrived at Yecheng, the situation became even more tense, as an associate of Yang's, Kezhuhun Tianhe (\u53ef\u6731\u6e3e\u5929\u548c), was convinced that Emperor Fei would not be safe in his reign unless his two uncles were killed, and alternatively, Yan Zixian considered putting Grand Empress Dowager Lou, who still wielded much power as the clan matriarch, under house arrest, and forcing her to turn her authorities to Empress Dowager Li. Meanwhile, the ambitious Yang was carrying out a governmental reorganization scheme to trim unnecessary offices and titles and to remove incompetent officials. The officials who were hurt by Yang's actions became disaffected and largely hoped that Gao Yan and Gao Dan would take action and began to encourage them to do so. Yang considered sending Gao Yan and Gao Dan outside the capital to be provincial governors, but Emperor Fei initially disagreed. Yang wrote a submission to Empress Dowager Li to ask her to consider, and she consulted her lady in waiting Li Changyi (\u674e\u660c\u5100), who leaked the news to Grand Empress Dowager Lou. She informed the two princes, and they set up an ambush, with Gao Guiyan and the generals Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) and Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1), at a ceremony where Gao Yan was to be named to a ceremonial post. Yang, Kezhuhun, Yan, Zheng, and Song Qindao (\u5b8b\u6b3d\u9053) were all severely battered and captured. Gao Yan and Gao Dan then entered the palace and publicly accused Yang and his associates of crimes; Yang and his associates were executed, and Gao Yan took control of the government. He soon went to take up post at Jinyang, controlling the government remotely.\n\nRemoval and death In fall 560, after Gao Yan convinced Grand Empress Dowager Lou the action is necessary, Grand Empress Dowager Lou issued an edict deposing Emperor Fei and making Gao Yan emperor (as Emperor Xiaozhao). The former emperor was created the Prince of Ji'nan. He was moved out of the main palace but was given a subsidiary palace at Yecheng. With Emperor Xiaozhao largely spending his time at Jinyang, Gao Dan was in charge of Yecheng, and the prince was under his guard.\n\nIn fall 561, sorcerers informed Emperor Xiaozhao that the imperial aura was still at Yecheng, making Emperor Xiaozhao concerned. Meanwhile, Gao Guiyan, who was concerned that Gao Yin would one day take the throne again and retaliate against him, persuaded Emperor Xiaozhao that his nephew had to be removed, and so Emperor Xiaozhao issued an edict to summon Gao Yin to Jinyang. Gao Dan, who at this time was disappointed at Emperor Xiaozhao not created him crown prince (instead creating his own son Gao Bainian crown prince), briefly considered redeclaring Gao Yin emperor and starting a rebellion against Emperor Xiaozhao, but ultimately chose not to do it, as his own sorcerers informed him that they believed that he would become emperor one day anyway. He therefore sent Gao Yin to Jinyang. Soon, Emperor Xiaozhao sent assassins to deliver poisoned wine to Gao Yin. Gao Yin refused to drink it, and the assassins strangled him. He was buried with honors due a prince, not an emperor."}], "Yuchi Jiong was a general.": [{"url": "https://everything.explained.today/%5C/Yuchi_Jiong/", "page_content": "Yuchi Jiong Explained\n\nYuchi Jiong (\u5c09\u9072\u8fe5) (died 580), courtesy name Bojuluo (\u8584\u5c45\u7f85), was a general of the Xianbei-led Western Wei and Northern Zhou dynasties of China.

His ancestors were a branch of the Tuoba tribe, which founded Northern Wei, and their subtribe was referred to as the Yuchi\u2014and therefore took the name of the subtribe as the surname. His father Yuchi Qidou (\u5c09\u9072\u4fdf\u515c) married the sister of Northern Wei's branch successor state Western Wei's paramount general Yuwen Tai, and they had two sons together\u2014Yuchi Jiong and his brother Yuchi Gang (\u5c09\u9072\u7db1). (Yuchi Jiong's mother was later known as Princess Changle during Northern Zhou.) Yuchi Qidou died fairly early. Yuchi Jiong, who was said to be handsome, intelligent, and ambitious in his youth, served under his uncle Yuwen Tai, and married the Princess Jinming, the daughter of Emperor Wen of Western Wei. He showed talent both in military matters and in governance, and Yuwen Tai gave him increasingly important positions.\n\nIn 552, rival Liang Dynasty, in the aftermaths of the major rebellion by Hou Jing and Hou's death earlier that year, had two major claimants to its throne\u2014Xiao Yi (Emperor Yuan of Liang), who controlled the central and eastern provinces, and Xiao Ji, who controlled the western provinces, both sons of the founding emperor Emperor Wu. Xiao Yi, under attack from Xiao Ji, requested aid from Western Wei\u2014in the form of an attack to Xiao Ji's rear, against Xiao Ji's home province Yi Province (modern central Sichuan). Yuwen believed this to be a great opportunity for Western Wei to conquer the modern Sichuan and Chongqing region, but when he discussed the matters with the generals, most were in opposition. Yuchi, however, was supportive of the plan and advocated an immediate attack. Yuwen thus put him in command over six other generals to attack Xiao Ji's realm, and the attack was launched in spring 553. Yuchi quickly advanced to Xiao Ji's capital at Chengdu (\u6210\u90fd, in modern Chengdu, Sichuan). Xiao Ji's army, which was then battling Xiao Yi near Xiao Yi's capital of Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), collapsed, and Xiao Ji was killed by Xiao Yi. After Yuchi had put Chengdu under siege for five months, Xiao Ji's cousin Xiao Hui (\u856d\u649d) and son Xiao Yuansu (\u856d\u5713\u8085), who were defending Chengdu, surrendered. The surrounding provinces also soon surrendered, and Western Wei had taken over Xiao Ji's domain. Yuwen made Yuchi the governor of Yi Province, in charge of 12 provinces centering Yi. In 554, six provinces were added to Yuchi's responsibility, for 18 provinces total. However, as Yuchi missed his mother deeply, and his mother was still at the capital Chang'an, Yuwen soon recalled him back to Chang'an.\n\nDuring Emperor Xiaomin's and Emperor Ming's reigns\n\nYuwen Tai died in 557, and his nephew Yuwen Hu, serving as the guardian for Yuwen Tai's son Yuwen Jue, forced Emperor Gong of Western Wei to yield the throne to Yuwen Jue in spring 558, ending Western Wei and establishing Northern Zhou, with Yuwen Jue as emperor (but using the alternative title \"Heavenly Prince\" (Tian Wang) (as Emperor Xiaomin). Emperor Xiaomin created Yuchi Jiong the Duke of Shu, in commemoration of his victory (as the modern Sichuan region was known in ancient times as the region of Shu). Later in 558, when Emperor Xiaomin tried to seize power from Yuwen Hu, Yuwen Hu deposed and then killed him, making Emperor Xiaomin's older brother Yuwen Yu the Duke of Ningdu emperor instead (as Emperor Ming). Yuchi Jiong's stance in this power struggle is not known, but his brother Yuchi Gang sided with Yuwen Hu.\n\nYuchi's activities during Emperor Ming's reign were not recorded in history. In 560, Emperor Ming was poisoned by Yuwen Hu. Emperor Ming's younger brother Yuwen Yong the Duke of Lu became emperor (as Emperor Wu).\n\nDuring Emperor Wu's reign\n\nIn 562, Yuchi Jiong became the Minister of the Army\u2014one of the six departments of government, under a system designed by Yuwen Tai\u2014although his actual authority over the army is not clear, as Yuwen Hu, as prime minister, also oversaw the armed forces. His brother Yuchi Gang served as Minister of Agriculture.\n\nIn winter 564, Yuwen Hu launched a major attack on rival Northern Qi, and Yuchi Jiong had the responsibility of attacking Luoyang along with Daxi Wu (\u9054\u595a\u6b66) and Emperor Wu's brother Yuwen Xian the Duke of Qi, but the attack was ultimately unsuccessful and withdrawn.\n\nIn 568, Yuchi took on the even more honorific title of Taibao (\u592a\u4fdd) -- one of the three senior advisors to the emperor\u2014but with unclear authorities.\n\nIn 572, Emperor Wu ambushed Yuwen Hu and killed him, taking over power personally. He made Yuchi Taishi (\u592a\u5e2b) -- one of the three senior advisors to him but slightly more honorific than Taibao.\n\nIn 576, Emperor Wu launched a major attack on Northern Qi, destroying it in 577 and taking over its territory. Yuchi's involvement, if any, in the campaign is unclear. In 578, Emperor Wu died, and the crown prince Yuwen Yun became emperor (as Emperor Xuan).\n\nDuring Emperor Xuan's and Emperor Jing's reigns\n\nIn spring 579, Emperor Xuan established four new senior advisor posts, and he made, as those four, his uncle Yuwen Sheng (\u5b87\u6587\u76db) the Prince of Yue, Yuchi Jiong, Li Mu (\u674e\u7a46) the Duke of Shen, and Yang Jian the Duke of Sui (and his father-in-law, as the father of his wife Yang Lihua). He also made Yuchi in charge of the region around Xiang Province (\u76f8\u5dde, roughly modern Handan, Hebei) -- effectively, the region north of the Yellow River. Later that year, Emperor Xuan passed the throne to his young son Yuwen Chan (Emperor Jing), becoming retired emperor\u2014but with the highly unusual title of \"Emperor Tianyuan\" (\u5929\u5143\u7687\u5e1d, Tianyuan Huangdi). He proceeded to rule in an erratic and cruel manner, causing officials to become alienated. His acts included raping Yuchi Jiong's granddaughter Yuchi Chifan, who had married Emperor Xuan's cousin Yuwen Liang (\u5b87\u6587\u4eae)'s son Yuwen Wen (\u5b87\u6587\u6eab) the Duke of Xiyang, causing Yuwen Liang to plot rebellion. When Yuwen Liang's plot was discovered, Emperor Xuan killed him and Yuwen Wen, seizing Lady Yuchi as a concubine and then creating him one of his five empresses\u2014contrary to the tradition of creating only one empress. (Another granddaughter of Yuchi Jiong's, Sima Lingji, was the young Emperor Jing's wife and empress.)\n\nIn summer 580, Emperor Xuan died suddenly, and after Yang's friends and Emperor Xuan's associates Liu Fang (\u5289\u6609) and Zheng Yi (\u912d\u8b6f) maneuvered behind the scenes by issuing an edict in Emperor Xuan's name, Yang became regent, and quickly took control of the political scene. As Yuchi had high reputation, Yang feared that Yuchi would oppose him, and therefore sent Yuchi's son Yuchi Dun (\u5c09\u9072\u60c7) the Duke of Wei'an to Xiang Province, summoning Yuchi back to the capital to attend Emperor Xuan's funeral and replacing him with the general Wei Xiaokuan.\n\nYuchi, believing that Yang was intending to seize the throne, instead announced an uprising against Yang, declaring that he was intending to protect Northern Zhou's imperial lineage. He took the son of Emperor Xuan's uncle Yuwen Zhao (\u5b87\u6587\u62db) the Prince of Zhao and declared him emperor. A number of important generals declared for him\u2014the chief of whom were Sima Xiaonan (\u53f8\u99ac\u6d88\u96e3), who controlled the southern provinces, and Wang Qian (\u738b\u8b19), who controlled the southwestern provinces\u2014but he was unable to persuaded Li Mu, who controlled the modern Shanxi region, to join him. He was also unable to get Northern Zhou's vassal state Western Liang (ruled by Emperor Ming of Western Liang, a great-grandson of Liang Dynasty's Emperor Wu) to join him.\n\nYuchi, despite his reputation, was by this point described as senile, entrusting most of his important matters to his secretary Cui Dana (\u5d14\u9054\u62cf) and his second wife Lady Wang. Cui and Lady Wang's decisions were largely described as inappropriate ones, and the rebels made little advances. Soon, the central government forces, commanded by Wei, arrived at Yuchi's headquarters at Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan) and besieged it. When the city fell, just 68 days after Yuchi declared his rebellion, his son's father-in-law Cui Hongdu (\u5d14\u5f18\u5ea6), who served under Wei, approached him, and gave him time to commit suicide. Yuchi did so, but only after hurling repeated insults at Yang Jian. His sons were killed.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Gaozu of Tang (618-626), Yuchi Jiong's grandnephew Yuchi Qifu (\u5c09\u9072\u8006\u798f) submitted a petition to have Yuchi Jiong given a proper burial.

Emperor Ming's younger brother Yuwen Yong the Duke of Lu became emperor (as Emperor Wu).\n\nDuring Emperor Wu's reign\n\nIn 562, Yuchi Jiong became the Minister of the Army -- one of the six departments of government, under a system designed by Yuwen Tai -- although his actual authority over the army is not clear, as Yuwen Hu, as prime minister, also oversaw the armed forces. His brother Yuchi Gang served as Minister of Agriculture.\n\nIn winter 564, Yuwen Hu launched a major attack on rival Northern Qi , and Yuchi Jiong had the responsibility of attacking Luoyang along with Daxi Wu (\u9054\u595a\u6b66) and Emperor Wu's brother Yuwen Xian the Duke of Qi, but the attack was ultimately unsuccessful and withdrawn.\n\nIn 568, Yuchi took on the even more honorific title of \"Taibao\" (\u592a\u4fdd) -- one of the three senior advisors to the emperor -- but with unclear authorities.\n\nIn 572, Emperor Wu ambushed Yuwen Hu and killed him, taking over power personally. He made Yuchi \"Taishi\" (\u592a\u5e2b) -- one of the three senior advisors to him but slightly more honorific than \"Taibao\".\n\nIn 576, Emperor Wu launched a major attack on Northern Qi, destroying it in 577 and taking over its territory. Yuchi's involvement, if any, in the campaign is unclear. [Yuchi's reputation as a great general, often referred to by historians, makes it fairly inexplicable that references to his military involvement -- particularly in this major campaign where virtually all important Northern Zhou generals participated -- were exceedingly sparse after his victory over Xiao Ji's forces. One can perhaps speculate (but only speculate) that perhaps after his defeat by Yang Jian, Yang had references to him excised from Northern Zhou's official records.] In 578, Emperor Wu died, and the crown prince Yuwen Yun became emperor (as Emperor Xuan).\n\nDuring Emperor Xuan's and Emperor Jing's reigns\n\nIn spring 579, Emperor Xuan established four new senior advisor posts, and he made, as those four, his uncle Yuwen Sheng (\u5b87\u6587\u76db) the Prince of Yue, Yuchi Jiong, Li Mu (\u674e\u7a46) the Duke of Shen, and Yang Jian the Duke of Sui (and his father-in-law, as the father of his wife Empress Yang Lihua ). He also made Yuchi in charge of the region around Xiang Province (\u76f8\u5dde, roughly modern Handan , Hebei ) -- effectively, the region north of the Yellow River . Later that year, Emperor Xuan passed the throne to his young son Yuwen Chan (Emperor Jing), becoming retired emperor -- but with the highly unusual title of \"Emperor Tianyuan\" (\u5929\u5143\u7687\u5e1d, \"Tianyuan Huangdi\"). He proceeded to rule in an erratic and cruel manner, causing officials to become alienated. His acts included raping Yuchi Jiong's granddaughter Yuchi Chifan , who had married Emperor Xuan's cousin Yuwen Liang (\u5b87\u6587\u4eae)'s son Yuwen Wen (\u5b87\u6587\u6eab) the Duke of Xiyang, causing Yuwen Liang to plot rebellion. When Yuwen Liang's plot was discovered, Emperor Xuan killed him and Yuwen Wen, seizing Lady Yuchi as a concubine and then creating him one of his five empress es -- contrary to the tradition of creating only one empress. (Another granddaughter of Yuchi Jiong's, Sima Lingji, was the young Emperor Jing's wife and empress.)\n\nIn summer 580, Emperor Xuan died suddenly, and after Yang's friends and Emperor Xuan's associates Liu Fang (\u5289\u6609) and Zheng Yi (\u912d\u8b6f) maneuvered behind the scenes by issuing an edict in Emperor Xuan's name, Yang became regent , and quickly took control of the political scene. As Yuchi had high reputation, Yang feared that Yuchi would oppose him, and therefore sent Yuchi's son Yuchi Dun (\u5c09\u9072\u60c7) the Duke of Wei'an to Xiang Province, summoning Yuchi back to the capital to attend Emperor Xuan's funeral and replacing him with the general Wei Xiaokuan .\n\nYuchi, believing that Yang was intending to seize the throne, instead announced an uprising against Yang, declaring that he was intending to protect Northern Zhou's imperial lineage. He took the son of Emperor Xuan's uncle Yuwen Zhao (\u5b87\u6587\u62db) the Prince of Zhao and declared him emperor. A number of important generals declared for him -- the chief of whom were Sima Xiaonan (\u53f8\u99ac\u6d88\u96e3), who controlled the southern provinces, and Wang Qian (\u738b\u8b19), who controlled the southwestern provinces -- but he was unable to persuaded Li Mu, who controlled the modern Shanxi region, to join him. He was also unable to get Northern Zhou's vassal state Western Liang (ruled by Emperor Ming of Western Liang , a great-grandson of Liang Dynasty's Emperor Wu) to join him.\n\nYuchi, despite his reputation, was by this point described as senile, entrusting most of his important matters to his secretary Cui Dana (\u5d14\u9054\u62cf) and his second wife Lady Wang. Cui and Lady Wang's decisions were largely described as inappropriate ones, and the rebels made little advances. Soon, the central government forces, commanded by Wei, arrived at Yuchi's headquarters at Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan ) and sieged it. When the city fell, just 68 days after Yuchi declared his rebellion, his son's father-in-law Cui Hongdu (\u5d14\u5f18\u5ea6), who served under Wei, approached him, and gave him time to commit suicide.

His ancestors were a branch of the Tuoba tribe, which founded Northern Wei, and their subtribe was referred to as the Yuchi\u2014and therefore took the name of the subtribe as the surname. His father Yuchi Qidou (\u5c09\u9072\u4fdf\u515c) married the sister of Northern Wei's branch successor state Western Wei's paramount general Yuwen Tai, and they had two sons together\u2014Yuchi Jiong and his brother Yuchi Gang (\u5c09\u9072\u7db1). (Yuchi Jiong's mother was later known as Princess Changle during Northern Zhou.) Yuchi Qidou died fairly early. Yuchi Jiong, who was said to be handsome, intelligent, and ambitious in his youth, served under his uncle Yuwen Tai, and married the Princess Jinming, the daughter of Emperor Wen of Western Wei. He showed talent both in military matters and in governance, and Yuwen Tai gave him increasingly important positions.\n\nIn 552, rival Liang Dynasty, in the aftermaths of the major rebellion by Hou Jing and Hou's death earlier that year, had two major claimants to its throne\u2014Xiao Yi (Emperor Yuan of Liang), who controlled the central and eastern provinces, and Xiao Ji, who controlled the western provinces, both sons of the founding emperor Emperor Wu. Xiao Yi, under attack from Xiao Ji, requested aid from Western Wei\u2014in the form of an attack to Xiao Ji's rear, against Xiao Ji's home province Yi Province (modern central Sichuan). Yuwen believed this to be a great opportunity for Western Wei to conquer the modern Sichuan and Chongqing region, but when he discussed the matters with the generals, most were in opposition. Yuchi, however, was supportive of the plan and advocated an immediate attack. Yuwen thus put him in command over six other generals to attack Xiao Ji's realm, and the attack was launched in spring 553. Yuchi quickly advanced to Xiao Ji's capital at Chengdu (\u6210\u90fd, in modern Chengdu, Sichuan). Xiao Ji's army, which was then battling Xiao Yi near Xiao Yi's capital of Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), collapsed, and Xiao Ji was killed by Xiao Yi. After Yuchi had put Chengdu under siege for five months, Xiao Ji's cousin Xiao Hui (\u856d\u649d) and son Xiao Yuansu (\u856d\u5713\u8085), who were defending Chengdu, surrendered. The surrounding provinces also soon surrendered, and Western Wei had taken over Xiao Ji's domain. Yuwen made Yuchi the governor of Yi Province, in charge of 12 provinces centering Yi. In 554, six provinces were added to Yuchi's responsibility, for 18 provinces total. However, as Yuchi missed his mother deeply, and his mother was still at the capital Chang'an, Yuwen soon recalled him back to Chang'an.\n\nDuring Emperor Xiaomins and Emperor Mings reigns\n\nYuwen Tai died in 557, and his nephew Yuwen Hu, serving as the guardian for Yuwen Tai's son Yuwen Jue, forced Emperor Gong of Western Wei to yield the throne to Yuwen Jue in spring 558, ending Western Wei and establishing Northern Zhou, with Yuwen Jue as emperor (but using the alternative title \"Heavenly Prince\" (Tian Wang) (as Emperor Xiaomin). Emperor Xiaomin created Yuchi Jiong the Duke of Shu, in commemoration of his victory (as the modern Sichuan region was known in ancient times as the region of Shu). Later in 558, when Emperor Xiaomin tried to seize power from Yuwen Hu, Yuwen Hu deposed and then killed him, making Emperor Xiaomin's older brother Yuwen Yu the Duke of Ningdu emperor instead (as Emperor Ming).

During the late reign of Emperor Yang, Yang Yichen was one of the few Sui generals having success against agrarian rebels, but in 616, Emperor Yang, unhappy about Yang Yichen's mounting influences, removed him from his military position, and thereafter the agrarian rebels went unchecked. Yang Yichen died soon afterwards.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nYang Yichen's father Yuchi Chong (\u5c09\u9072\u5d07) was ethnically Xianbei and a distant relative of the general Yuchi Jiong. Yuchi Chong was a general during Northern Zhou and had his defense post at Mount Heng. At that time, the general Yang Jian was the commandant at nearby Ding Province (\u5b9a\u5dde, roughly near Baoding, Hebei), and Yuchi Chong, believing Yang Jian to have great ambitions, befriended Yang Jian. After Yang Jian seized power as regent in 580, Yuchi Jiong, suspicious of Yang Jian's intentions, rebelled at Xiang Province (\u76f8\u5dde, roughly modern Handan, Hebei). When Yuchi Chong heard this, as he was a relative of Yuchi Jiong's, he threw himself into jail and begged Yang Jian for forgiveness. Yang Jian pardoned him and ordered him to report to the capital Chang'an to serve as one of Yang Jian's assistants. After Yang Jian seized the throne from Emperor Jing of Northern Zhou in 581, ending Northern Zhou and establishing Sui Dynasty as its Emperor Wen, he created Yuchi Chong the Duke of Qinxing. In 582, Yuchi Chong served under Daxi Zhangru (\u9054\u595a\u9577\u5112) in a campaign against Tujue's Shabol\u00fce Khan Ashina Shetu, and while Daxi achieved victory, Yuchi died in the battle.\n\nAt the time that Yuchi Chong died, his son Yuchi Yichen was said to be still young. Emperor Wen took Yuchi Yichen into the palace and raised him there, allowing him to inherit his father's titles. After he became a teenager, he served in the palace guard corps, and when Emperor Wen saw him, he was reminded of Yuchi Chong's contributions. He therefore issued an edict giving Yuchi Yichen a moderate amount of wealth, while bestowing the imperial clan surname of Yang on him and conferring him the status of the emperor's grandnephew. Soon afterwards, Emperor Wen made him the governor of Shan Province (\u965d\u5dde, roughly modern Sanmenxia, Henan).\n\nService during Emperor Wen's reign [ edit ]\n\nYang Yichen was considered to be honest and careful, with military leadership qualities, and Emperor Wen respected him. In 599, when Tujue's Bujia Khan Ashina Dianjue attacked, Yang Yichen was sent to face Tujue forces, and he repelled them. In 600, in conjunction with Shi Wansui (\u53f2\u842c\u6b72) the Duke of Taiping, he dealt Ashina Dianjue a major defeat. However, later that year, Shi was executed after false accusations by Yang Su, and Yang Yichen was not rewarded for his contributions. Sometime during Emperor Wen's late reign -- the Renshou era (601-604), Yang Yichen was promoted to be the commandant at Shuo Province (\u6714\u5dde, roughly modern Shuozhou, Shanxi).\n\nDuring Emperor Yang's reign [ edit ]\n\nIn 604, Emperor Wen died\u2014a death that traditional historians, while admitting a lack of direct evidence, generally believe to be a murder ordered by his son, Yang Guang the Crown Prince. Yang Guang took the throne as Emperor Yang. Soon afterwards, Emperor Yang's younger brother Yang Liang the Prince of Han rose in rebellion at Bing Province (\u5e76\u5dde, roughly modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). Yang Liang's general Qiao Zhongkui (\u55ac\u937e\u8475) afterwards put Li Jing (\u674e\u666f), the commandant of Dai Province (\u4ee3\u5dde, roughly modern Xinzhou, Shanxi), who remained loyal to Emperor Yang, under siege. Emperor Yang ordered Yang Yichen to try to lift the siege against Li, and Yang Yichen was successful in defeating Qiao. After Yang Liang was defeated and forced to surrender to Yang Su, Yang Yichen was given material rewards and made the governor of Xiang Province. In 607, Emperor Yang recalled him to be the director of imperial clan affairs, and later the director of husbandry affairs.\n\nIn 609, Yang Yichen served as a general in the largely successful campaign against Tuyuhun. In 612, he also served in Emperor Yang's first campaign against Goguryeo, commanding part of the force under Yuwen Shu the Duke of Xu that aimed to penetrate deep into Goguryeo territory, against its capital Pyongyang. While Yang Yichen was personally successful, the campaign was itself a major failure, and as a result, Yang Yichen was removed from his post. However, Emperor Yang soon restored him, and in 613, when Emperor Yang launched a second campaign against Tuyuhun, Yang Yichen again served under Yuwen in an attempt to attack Pyongyang, but when news arrived that Yang Su's son Yang Xuangan had rebelled near the eastern capital Luoyang the campaign was abandoned. Afterwards, with much of Sui territory engulfed in agrarian rebellions, Yang Yichen was sent against the rebel leader Xiang Haiming (\u5411\u6d77\u660e), who had claimed imperial title near Chang'an, and Yang Yichen defeated Xiang.\n\nIn 616, Emperor Yang sent Yang Yichen against another major rebel leader, Zhang Jincheng (\u5f35\u91d1\u7a31), and Yang, after lulling Zhang into a sense of security, defeated him and forced him to flee, allowing another Sui general, Yang Shanhui (\u694a\u5584\u6703), to capture and execute Zhang. Yang Yichen then engaged another major rebel leader, Gao Shida (\u9ad8\u58eb\u9054), who had claimed the title of Duke of Donghai. Around the new year 617, Gao, going against the advice of his subordinate Dou Jiande, engaged Yang Yichen, and Yang Yichen defeated and killed Gao and nearly captured Dou. However, believing that Dou to not pose a further threat, he did not pursue Dou further.\n\nMeanwhile, Emperor Yang and the prime minister Yu Shiji had become suspicious of Yang Yichen after his victories. Emperor Yang summoned Yang Yichen to his then-location at Jiangdu (\u6c5f\u90fd, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) and, ostensibly promoting him, made him the minister of ceremonies, while disbanding his troops. Yang Yichen died soon afterwards."}, {"url": "https://www.nouahsark.com/en/infocenter/culture/history/monarchs/emperor_wen_of_sui_china.php", "page_content": "Emperor Wen of Sui (21 July 541 \u2013 13 August 604) \u2014 personal name Yang Jian (\u694a\u5805), Xianbei name Puliuru Jian (\u666e\u516d\u8339\u5805), nickname Naluoyan (\u90a3\u7f85\u5ef6) \u2014 was the founder and first emperor of China's sui dynasty (581-618 AD). He was a hard-working administrator and a micromanager. As a Buddhist, he encouraged the spread of Buddhism through the state. He is regarded as one of the most important emperors in Chinese history, reunifying China in 589 after centuries of division since the fall of western jin dynasty in 316. During his reign began the construction of the Grand Canal.\n\nAs a northern zhou official, Yang Jian served with apparent distinction during the reigns of Emperor Wu of northern zhou and Emperor Xuan of northern zhou. When the erratic Emperor Xuan died in 580, Yang, as his father-in-law, seized power as regent. After defeating the general Yuchi Jiong, who resisted him, he seized the throne for himself, establishing the new sui dynasty (as its Emperor Wen). He was the first Chinese to rule North China after the Xianbei invasion which conquered that area from the liu song dynasty (not counting the brief reconquest of that region by Emperor Wu of Liang).\n\nGenerally speaking, Emperor Wen's reign was a great period of prosperity not seen since the han dynasty. Economically, the dynasty prospered. It was said that there was enough food stored for 50 years. The military was also powerful. At the beginning of his reign, Sui faced the threat of Tujue to the north, and neighbored Tibetan tribes to the west, Goguryeo in the northeast, and the kingdom known as Champa threatening the south. By the end of Emperor Wen's reign, Tujue had split into an eastern and a western kaganate, the eastern one being nominally submissive to Sui, as was Goguryeo. Linyi was defeated and, while not conquered, did not remain a threat.\n\nEmperor Wen is also famous for having the fewest number of concubines for an adult Chinese emperor. (The ming dynasty Hongzhi Emperor was the only perpetually monogamous Chinese emperor. ) Emperor Wen was known for having only two concubines (although he might have had additional concubines not documented by traditional historians), with whom he might not have had sexual relations until after the death in 602 of his wife Empress Dugu Qieluo, whom he loved and respected deeply. Emperor Taizong of Tang, by comparison, is said to have had over 3000 concubines in his palaces.\n\n\n\nBackground Yang Jian's clan was descended from Xue Shan (\u859b\u5584), the mayor of the capital Chang'an. In 555, on account of Yang Zhong's accomplishments, Yang Jian received several official ranks, including the title of the Duke of Chengji (\u6210\u7d00\u7e23\u516c). In 557, Dugu Xin, impressed with Yang Jian, gave Yang Jian his daughter Dugu Qieluo as his wife. He was 16, and she was 13. He loved her greatly, and it was said that he swore an oath to her that he would never let another woman have his children. They would eventually have five sons and at least three daughters.\n\nAfter Yuwen Tai's son Emperor Ming of northern zhou came to the throne later that year, Yang Jian was made the vice minister of internal affairs, and he was created the greater title of Duke of Daxing (\u5927\u8208\u90e1\u516c). Subsequently, during the reign of Emperor Ming's brother Emperor Wu, Yang Jian was further promoted in military authority. After Yang Zhong's death in 568, he inherited the title of Duke of Sui. In 573, Emperor Wu took Yang Jian's daughter Yang Lihua to be the wife and crown princess of his son Yuwen Yun the Crown Prince, and further honored Yang Jian. It was said that, however, that Yang Jian was so unusual in his appearance that some of Emperor Wu's close associates suspected Yang Jian of eventually harboring treasonous intent. Both Emperor Wu's brother Yuwen Xian the Prince of Qi and the general Wang Gui (\u738b\u8ecc) were said to have suggested that Emperor Wu execute Yang Jian, but Emperor Wu resisted. Still, Yang Jian heard rumors and tried to hide his own talent to avoid trouble. It was not until 575 when Emperor Wu involved Yang Jian in a major campaign against rival northern qi. Yang Jian also participated in the 576-577 campaign that saw Emperor Wu being able to destroy northern qi and seize its territory.\n\nIn 578, Emperor Wu died, and Yuwen Yun took the throne as Emperor Xuan. Emperor Xuan immediately began to show erratic behavior, and while he created Yang Jian's daughter Crown Princess Yang empress, he suspected Yang Jian deeply, although he made Yang Jian the minister of defense. In 579, Emperor Xuan passed the throne to his young son Yuwen Chan (by his concubine Consort Zhu Manyue) (as Emperor Jing) and became retired emperor (with the atypical title of \"Emperor Tianyuan\" (Tianyuan Huangdi), but continued to exercise imperial powers. On one occasion, he became so suspicious of Yang Jian that he stated to Empress Yang, \"I will surely slaughter your clan!\" He then summoned Yang Jian to the palace, with instructions to kill him if his expressions betrayed any worries, but Yang Jian arrived without showing any unusual emotions, and so avoided being killed. On another occasion, Empress Yang displeased Emperor Xuan, and Emperor Xuan ordered her to commit suicide. When Duchess Dugu heard this, she went to the palace to beg Emperor Xuan's forgiveness, and Emperor Xuan eventually spared Empress Yang.\n\n\n\nAs regent In summer 580, with Emperor Xuan intending to conquer chen dynasty, he sent Yang Jian to be the commandant at Yang Province (\u63da\u5dde, roughly modern Luan , Anhui ) to prepare for the campaign against Chen. Before Yang Jian could depart, however, Emperor Xuan suddenly grew seriously ill. Two of Emperor Xuan's close associates, Liu Fang (\u5289\u6609) and Zheng Yi (\u912d\u8b6f), who were friends of Yang's, summoned Yang to the palace to prepare to serve as regent, overriding the desire of another closet associate, Yan Zhiyi (\u984f\u4e4b\u5100), to have Emperor Xuan's uncle Yuwen Zhao (\u5b87\u6587\u62db) the Prince of Zhao appointed regent. Emperor Xuan soon died, and Zheng and Liu issued an edict in Emperor Xuan's name appointing Yang regent.\n\nYang immediately pleased the officials at the capital by abolishing the wastefulness and cruel policies of Emperor Xuan, and he himself demonstrated both hard work and frugality, which impressed the people. Fearful of the intentions of the general Yuchi Jiong, who was then the commandant at Xiang Province (\u76f8\u5dde, roughly modern Handan, Hebei ), he summoned Yuchi back to the capital. Yuchi, however, refused, and believing that Yang's intentions were to usurp the throne, rose at Xiang Province against Yang. He was supported by the generals Sima Xiaonan (\u53f8\u99ac\u6d88\u96e3), the commandant at Xun Province (\u52db\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei ) and Wang Qian (\u738b\u8b19), the commandant at Yi Province (\u76ca\u5dde, roughly modern Chengdu, Sichuan ). However, just 68 days after Yuchi rose in rebellion, the general Wei Xiaokuan defeated Yuchi, and Yuchi committed suicide. Wang was also soon defeated, and Sima fled to Chen. To prevent Yuchi's headquarters at Yecheng to be used again as a base of opposition against him, Yang Jian had Yecheng (northern qi's old capital) torn down.\n\nDuring Yuchi's campaign, Yuwen Zhao made an attempt to assassinate Yang, but failed. In response, Yang put Yuwen Zhao and his brother Yuwen Sheng (\u5b87\u6587\u76db) the Prince of Yue to death, and after Yuchi was defeated, he began to slaughter the Yuwen clan in earnest. He also had Emperor Jing promote his titles quickly, and he changed his surname back to Yang. Around the new year 581, his title was promoted to Prince of Sui \u96a8\u738b). In spring 581, he had Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, ending northern zhou and establishing sui dynasty, as its Emperor Wen. (His use of \"Sui\" as his new dynasty name was typical of Chinese historical dynastic transitions\u2014using the old fief name as the new dynasty's name\u2014but he, believing that the character for his fief Sui (\u96a8) to contain a \"\u8fb6\" radical, denoting \"walking\" and therefore a lack of permanence in the regime, removed \"\u8fb6\" from the character, rendering it \"\u968b\". )\n\n\n\nEarly Kaihuang era Emperor Wen abolished northern zhou's governmental organization of six departments, instead establishing five main bureaus\u2014executive bureau (Shangshu Sheng (\u5c1a\u66f8\u7701)), examination bureau (Menxia Sheng (\u9580\u4e0b\u7701)), legislative bureau (Neish\u01d0 Sheng (\u5167\u53f2\u7701)), archival bureau (Mishu Sheng (\u79d8\u66f8\u7701)), and eunuch bureau (Neish\u00ec Sheng (\u5167\u4f8d\u7701\u2014note different tone and character versus 'legislative bureau')), with two additional independent agencies, 11 other independent departments, and 12 military commands. He posthumously honored his father Yang Zhong and mother Lady Lu as emperor and empress. He created his wife Duchess Dugu empress and their oldest son Yang Yong crown prince; he created his brothers and his other sons imperial princes. He initially created northern zhou's Emperor Jing the Duke of Jie, but soon slaughtered all grandsons of Yuwen Tai, and eventually put the Duke of Jie to death as well. He entrusted most of the important governmental matters to his officials Gao Jiong, Yang Su, and Su Wei. Agreeing with some officials' assertions that northern zhou fell because its imperial princes lacked power to protect the central government, he sent his sons out to key provinces with broad powers. He further commissioned the official Pei Zheng (\u88f4\u653f) to carry out a project of simplifying the penal code and decrease the penalty from the harsh laws\u2014a reform that was later largely accepted by the succeeding dynasties.\n\nEmperor Wen did not maintain as submissive of a relationship with Tujue, which brought resentment from Tujue's Shabol\u00fce Khan Ashina Shetu, and Ashina Shetu's wife, northern zhou's Princess Qianjin (Yuwen Zhao's daughter) particularly hated Emperor Wen for destroying northern zhou. Ashina Shetu therefore carried out a series of border attacks against Sui, allied with Gao Baoning (\u9ad8\u5bf6\u5be7), the former northern qi general who was still holding Ying Province (\u71df\u5dde, roughly modern Zhaoyang, Liaoning ). In response, Emperor Wen, under advice from the general Zhangsun Sheng (\u9577\u5b6b\u665f), Emperor Wen carried out the strategy of placating Ashina Shetu's subordinate khans\u2014his uncle Datou Khan Ashina Dianjue (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u73b7\u53a5), cousin Abo Khan Ashina Daxianbian (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u5927\u66b9\u4fbf), and brother Ashina Chuluohou (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u8655\u7f85\u4faf) \u2013 to create dissension within Tujue, and gradually, the strategy worked, causing Tujue to be unable to take unified actions against Sui.\n\nIn 581, Emperor Wen commissioned a major attack on Chen, and while it was initially successful, Emperor Wen withdrew the attack in spring 582 after hearing that Emperor Xuan of Chen had died and believing it wrongful to attack a state whose emperor had just died.\n\nIn 582, believing that Chang'an was too small of a city, Emperor Wen built a new capital nearby, which he named Daxing, and in spring 583 he moved the capital to Daxing. (From that point forward, Daxing and Chang'an became interchangeable names, although by the time of succeeding tang dynasty, the new capital was known again just as Chang'an. )\n\nAlso in 582, Emperor Wen, thankful for the refusal by the vassal Emperor Ming of Western Liang to support Yuchi Jiong in 580, withdrew his forces from Western Liang's capital Jiangling, permitting Western Liang a degree of self-governance. He also took Emperor Ming's daughter as the wife and princess to his son, Yang Guang the Prince of Jin. (After Emperor Ming's death in 585 and succession by his son Emperor Jing of Western Liang, however, Emperor Wen reestablished the post of commandant of Jiangling and again put Western Liang territory under military control. )\n\nBy spring 583, Tujue's internal dissension had become serious enough that Emperor Wen felt comfortable enough to commission his brother Yang Shuang (\u694a\u723d) the Prince of Wei to command a major attack against Ashina Shetu. Yang Shuang achieved a great victory, and part of his army, commanded by the general Yin Shou (\u9670\u58fd), defeated Gao, forcing Gao to try to flee to the Qidan, but on the way, Gao was killed by his own subordinates, ending the very last bit of northern qi resistance. After the defeat, the various subordinate khans further engaged in battles among themselves and against Ashina Shetu, with Sui watching by, refusing to give aid to any side. By 584, Ashina Shetu submitted to Sui, and even the resentful Princess Qianjin referred to Emperor Wen as \"father. \" He created her the Princess Dayi.\n\nIn summer 584, believing that the Wei River, on account of its sandbars and treacherous waters, was becoming too difficult of a route for food transport to Daxing, commissioned the official Yuwen Kai (\u5b87\u6587\u6137) to construct a canal between Daxing and Tong Pass, parallel to the Wei River, named the Guangtong Canal (\u5ee3\u901a\u6e20), greatly easing the transport of food and other supplies to the capital region Guanzhong. Nevertheless, on account of a famine in Guanzhong in fall 584, Emperor Wen briefly took up residence in Luoyang.\n\nIn 586, the officials Liang Shiyan (\u6881\u58eb\u5f65) the Duke of Cheng, Yuwen Xin (\u5b87\u6587\u5ffb) the Duke of Qi, and Liu Fang the Duke of Shu\u2014all three of whom were friends of Emperor Wen but all of whom believed that they had been slighted by Emperor Wen\u2014were accused of plotting rebellion, and all three were executed.\n\nIn spring 587, continuing his canal-building regime, Emperor Wen built the Shanyang Canal (\u5c71\u967d\u7006) between the Yangtze River and the Huai River to improve the transport of material between those two rivers.\n\nIn fall 587, Emperor Wen summoned Western Liang's Emperor Jing to Chang'an to meet him. Emperor Jing complied with the direction. While Emperor Jing was away, however, Emperor Wen, believing that Jiangling would not be guarded well, sent his general Cui Hongdu (\u5d14\u5f18\u5ea6) to Jiangling. Emperor Jing's uncle Xiao Yan (\u856d\u5dd6) the Prince of Anping and Xiao Huan (\u856d\u74db) the Prince of Yixing instead believed that Cui was intending to attack the city, and they took the populace of the city and surrendered to the Chen general Chen Huiji (\u9673\u6167\u7d00), the cousin to Chen's emperor Chen Shubao. In response, Emperor Wen abolished Western Liang, directly seizing its territory, while creating Emperor Jing the Duke of Ju. Emperor Wen, who had been planning to conquer Chen for years, now further enhanced his planning in earnest. In spring 588, Emperor Wen publicly announced a campaign against Chen, commanded by Yang Guang, another of his sons Yang Jun the Prince of Qin, and Yang Su, with Yang Guang in overall command. Gao Jiong served as Yang Guang's assistant.\n\nIn spring 589, the Sui general Heruo Bi (\u8cc0\u82e5\u5f3c) crossed the Yangtze at Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu ), and the Sui general Han Qinhu (\u97d3\u64d2\u864e) crossed the Yangtze at Caishi (\u91c7\u77f3, in modern Ma'anshan, Anhui ). Meanwhile, Yang Su was advancing from the west down the Yangtze, and Yang Jun was stationed in the middle Yangtze region, cutting off any Chen forces that might have been able to come to the aid of Chen's capital Jiankang. Heruo soon defeated and captured the Chen general Xiao Mohe, who was making a final attempt to repel Heruo and Han's forces from Jiankang, and Jiankang fell immediately after. Chen Shubao was captured but not harmed. Rather, he and his clan members were transported to Chang'an, where Emperor Wen treated them as honored guests. Some Chen generals briefly resisted, but soon the Sui had control. The southern and northern dynasties period was over, and Sui had united China. Much as how he had torn down Yecheng after Yuchi defeat, Emperor Wen tore down Jiankang, establishing only a minor garrison at the nearby Shitou as Jiang Province (\u8523\u5dde).\n\n\n\nLate Kaihuang era In 590, apparently jealous of the talent of the official Li Delin, who had been key in his takeover of power as regent and who had contributed to the strategies in conquering Chen, Emperor Wen, believing in several false accusations against Li, removed Li from his office and made him a provincial governor. Li would not return to the central government for the rest of his life.\n\nAfter Chen was conquered, Sui began to apply its laws over Chen's former territory\u2014which brought resentment from the gentry, as they had been treated preferencially under Chen and its predecessor dynasties in the south. Su Wei further wrote a work known as the Five Teachings (\u4e94\u6559, Wu Jiao) which is no longer extant but thought to be a work about loyalty to Sui and ordered that all former Chen subjects read and memorize it, leading to further resentment. When a rumor spread that Sui would move Chen subjects into the Guanzhong region in 590, nearly all of former Chen realm rose in rebellion, but in an unorganized manner. Emperor Wen sent Yang Su to quell the rebellions, and the rebels were no match for Yang Su; within the year, the rebellions were put down.\n\nIn 591, Tuyuhun sought peace and, as per custom, its khan Murong Shifu (\u6155\u5bb9\u4e16\u4f0f) offered his daughter to be a concubine for Emperor Wen. Emperor Wen accepted the peace offer but declined the offer of Murong Shifu's daughter. (It was, however, around this time that he did take Chen Shubao's sister and another woman from Jiankang, Consort Cai, as concubines, although it appeared likely that Consort Cai was never able to have sexual relations with Emperor Wen while Empress Dugu was alive; Consort Chen, as the sister of a submissive former sovereign, might have had sexual relations with Emperor Wen on an infrequent basis, but it is not clear. )\n\nIn spring 592, the official He Tuo (\u4f55\u59a5), who, despite his senior status over Su Wei's son Su Kui (\u8607\u5914), was losing out against Su Kui over a debate as to the designation of official music styles for Sui. In anger, He Tuo accused Su Wei of factionalism, and after investigation by Emperor Wen's son Yang Xiu and the official Yu Qingze (ted zhang), Su Wei was removed from office. After Su Wei's removal, Yang Su and Gao Jiong became effectively the co-prime ministers. When Heruo Bi, who believed that he should have been prime minister, complained, Emperor Wen removed him from his post as well and stripped him of his ducal title, but restored the ducal title a year later. (Su Wei, however, was back in his post at the latest by 595. )\n\nAlso in 592, Emperor Wen, reacting to an overflowing abundance of food and silk in the governmental stores, reduced the taxes heavily, and he also sent messengers around central China, redistributing land to give the poor farming land.\n\nIn 593, Emperor Wen commissioned a summer vacation palace, Renshou Palace (\u4ec1\u58fd\u5bae, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi ), away from Chang'an, with Yang Su in charge of the project. The palace was far more luxurious than Emperor Wen expected, and its construction cost many lives. (When it was completed in spring 595 and Emperor Wen visited the palace, he was initially very displeased with Yang Su, but Empress Dugu persuaded him that Yang Su knew that he had little other entertainment, and she awarded Yang Su much treasure to show appreciation. )\n\nAlso in 593, knowing that the Princess Dayi was still resentful of him, Emperor Wen had the official Pei Ju inform the cousin and subordinate khan to Tujue's Dulan Khan, Ashina Yongyul\u00fc, the Tuli Khan Ashina Rangan (son of Ashina Chuluohou) that he would let Ashina Rangan marry a Sui princess if Ashina Rangan was able to get Princess Dayi killed. Ashina Rangan, in response, accused Princess Dayi of adultery, and Ashina Yongyul\u00fc killed her and requested another marriage with Sui. Instead, Emperor Wen agreed to marry a princess to Ashina Rangan, in order to create greater friction between them.\n\nIn 594, in response to another famine in the Guanzhong region, Emperor Wen again temporarily took up residence in Luoyang. He also, to share in some of his people's suffering, abstained from meat for a year.\n\nLate in 594, Yang Guang submitted a petition that Emperor Wen carry out the ancient ceremonies of worshipping the heaven and earth gods at Mount Tai. Emperor Wen declined to carry out a full set of ceremonies due to its costs, but in spring 59] carried out an abbreviated version to seek blessings from the gods due to the ongoing drought.\n\nAlso in spring 595, Emperor Wen ordered that no weapons be held by private individuals and that all of them be collected and destroyed, although he exempted the border provinces from this edict.\n\nIn 596, Emperor Wen created a daughter of a clansman the Princess Guanghua and married her to Murong Shifu, to cement the peaceful relations with Tuyuhun.\n\nIn 597, Cuan Wan (\u7228\u7feb), the chief of the Nanning Tribe (\u5357\u5be7\u5937, located in modern Qujing, Yunnan ), rebelled. Emperor Wen sent the general Shi Wansui (\u53f2\u842c\u6b72) the Duke of Taiping against Cuan, forcing him to surrender. Initially, Shi was to take Cuan to Chang'an to be presented to Emperor Wen, but Cuan bribed Shi, and so Shi allowed him to stay. Also in 597, Li Guangshi (\u674e\u5149\u4ed5), the chief of the aborigine people in Gui Province (\u6842\u5dde, roughly modern Guilin, Guangxi ), also rebelled. Emperor Wen sent the generals Wang Shiji (\u738b\u4e16\u7a4d) and Zhou Fashang (\u5468\u6cd5\u5c1a) against Li, and Zhou was able to defeat and kill Li. However, in the fall, Li Shixian (\u674e\u4e16\u8ce2), who might have been related to Li Guangshi, rebelled at Gui Province, and Emperor Wen sent Yu Qingze the Duke of Lu to attack Li Shixian; Yu was successful in suppressing the rebellion. Subsequently, however, Yu's brother-in-law Zhao Shizhu (\u8d99\u4ec0\u4f4f), who had an affair with Yu's concubine, falsely accused Yu of treason, and around the new year 598, Yu was executed.\n\nAlso in 597, Emperor Wen felt that the punishment for official misconduct was too light, and authorized that supervising officials would be permitted to batter their subordinates with large canes if they felt that the legally prescribed punishment was too light in comparison to the degree of misconduct. Further, also believing that there was too much theft and robbery throughout the realm, he increased the punishment for theft to death\u2014a law that he subsequently abolished.\n\nAlso in 597, Emperor Wen's son Yang Jun the Prince of Qin, the commandant at Bing Province (\u5e76\u5dde, roughly Taiyuan, Shanxi ), was poisoned, but not to death, by his jealous wife Princess Cui. After Yang Jun was taken back to Chang'an for treatment, Emperor Wen discovered that Yang Jun had been wasteful at his post, and removed him from all of his offices, allowing him to only retain the title of imperial prince. When Princess Cui's poisoning was discovered, Emperor Wen ordered Yang Jun to divorce her, and subsequently ordered her to commit suicide. When Liu Sheng (\u5289\u6607) and Yang Su suggested that the punishment against Yang Jun was overly severe, Emperor Wen responded to Yang Su: I am the father of just five sons, not the father of all people over the land. If I agreed with you, does that mean I have to draft a Penal Code for the Emperor's Sons? Even a man as kind as the Duke of Zhou executed his brothers, the lords of Guan and Cai, for their crimes. I am nowhere as capable as the Duke of Zhou, so I can break my own laws?\n\nAlso in 597, Ashina Rangan arrived at Chang'an, and Emperor Wen gave him the daughter of a clansman, whom he created the Princess Anyi, to be his wife, and awarded Ashina Rangan with much treasure, to try to break the bond between him and Ashina Yongyul\u00fc. From this point on, whenever Ashina Yongyul\u00fc would prepare to attack, Ashina Rangan would report his plans to Emperor Wen, allowing Sui forces to become prepared.\n\nIn 598, King Yeong-yang of Goguryeo attacked Ying Province, and while the governor of Ying Province, Wei Chong (\u97cb\u6c96), fought off the Goguryeo attack, Emperor Wen was angered. He sent his son Yang Liang the Prince of Han and Wang Shiji to serve as commanding generals, with Gao Jiong serving as Yang Liang's assistant, and the former Chen general Zhou Luohou (\u5468\u7f85\u777a) serving as the commander of the navy, to attack Goguryeo. However, the forces ran into food supply problems, and the ships ran into a storm and suffered great losses. Both at sea and on the ground, Goguryeo forces inflicted heavy losses on the Sui forces. Nevertheless, King Yeong-yang ceased his raids into China and so Emperor Wen called off the campaign against Goguryeo, unable to commit yet another enormous force to punish Goguryeo after the recent losses. As King Wideok of Baekje offered assistance to Sui during the campaign, this precipitated a conflict between Goguryeo and Baekje.\n\nAlso in 598, Cuan Wan rebelled again, and Yang Xiu accused Shi of accepting bribes from Cuan earlier. Emperor Wen considered executing Shi, but ultimately chose only to remove him from his posts, and it appeared soon after Shi was restored to his post. In 599, after Ashina Rangan reported that Ashina Yongyul\u00fc was planning to attack, Emperor Wen took preemptive action and had Gao Jiong, Yang Su, and Yan Rong (\u71d5\u69ae) command a three-pronged attack against Ashina Yongyul\u00fc, with Yang Liang in nominal command but not at the frontline. In response, Ashina Yongyul\u00fc and Ashina Dianjue made a joint attack against Ashina Rangan, defeating him and largely seizing his tribe. Ashina Rangan fled to Sui, and Emperor Wen treated him as an honored guest. Subsequently, both Gao Jiong and Yang Su engaged Tujue forces and repelled them.\n\nAlso in 599, with Wang Shiji's subordinate Huangfu Xiaoxie (\u7687\u752b\u5b5d\u8ae7) accusing Wang of treason after Wang refused to shield Huangfu after he committed crimes, Emperor Wen believed Huangfu and executed Wang.\n\nBy this point, Yang Yong the Crown Prince had lost the favor both Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu, over his being overly wasteful (which displeased Emperor Wen) and having many concubines (which displeased Empress Dugu). They therefore considered deposing him and replacing him with Yang Guang. When Empress Dugu hinted as such, Gao Jiong stated clear opposition. Meanwhile, Emperor Wen himself had engaged in sexual relations with Yuchi Jiong's granddaughter, who had been made a servant after her grandfather's defeat\u2014and when Empress Dugu found out, she had Yuchi Jiong's granddaughter killed. Emperor Wen was exceedingly angry and rode away from the palace on a horse, returning to the palace only at the urging of Gao and Yang Su\u2014but with Gao further angering Empress Dugu when Gao referred to her as \"a woman. \" In 599, Gao was accused of associating with Wang Shiji and removed from his posts. Subsequently, Gao was accused of cursing Emperor Wen, but when the sentence of death was recommended, Emperor Wen commented that he could not kill Gao soon after killing Yu and Wang, and therefore only reduced Gao to commoner rank.\n\nIn winter 599, Emperor Wen created Ashina Rangan Qimin Khan, and commissioned Zhangsun Sheng to build the city of Dali (\u5927\u5229, in modern Hohhot) to house Ashian Rangan's people, and also sent an army to protect Ashina Rangan. By now, the Princess Anyi had died, and Emperor Wen married another daughter of a clansman, whom he created the Princess Yicheng, to marry Ashina Rangan. Soon thereafter, Ashina Yongyul\u00fc was assassinated, and Ashina Dianjue declared himself Bujia Khan. In summer 600, Ashina Dianjue attacked Ashina Rangan, and Sui forces fought off Ashina Dianjue's attack, further causing Ashina Rangan to be grateful to Sui.\n\nIn fall 600, with Yang Guang and Yang Su forming a faction, with tacit support of Empress Dugu, they had Yang Yong's associate Ji Wei (\u59ec\u5a01) falsely accuse Yang Yong of plotting treason. Emperor Wen deposed Yang Yong and replaced him with Yang Guang. Emperor Wen also put a number of officials whom he believed to be part of Yang Yong's faction, including Shi and Yuan Min (\u5143\u65fb) the Duke of Wuyuan, to death.\n\n\n\nRenshou era In 602, Empress Dugu died, and Emperor Wen was greatly saddened. Thereafter, he began to engage in sexual relations with his concubines, favoring Consorts Chen and Cai. Also in 602, Yang Guang, believing that Yang Xiu would eventually create trouble for him, had Yang Su collect evidence of Yang Xiu's wastefulness and use of items that were only appropriate for emperors. Yang Su submitted the evidence to Emperor Wen, and Emperor Wen, in anger, recalled Yang Xiu to the capital. After Yang Xiu arrived at the capital, Yang Guang further manufactured evidence that Yang Xiu had cursed Emperor Wen and Yang Liang. In anger, Emperor Wen reduced Yang Xiu to commoner rank and put him under house arrest.\n\nIn 603, Ashina Dianjue, faced with rebellions from the Tiele and Pugu (\u50d5\u9aa8) tribes, surrendered to Ashina Rangan. By now, Ashina Rangan became the undisputed khan of the Tujue.\n\nIn spring 604, Emperor Wen, as per his custom, went to Renshou Palace to avoid the heat, despite warnings from the sorcerer Zhangchou Taiyi (\u7ae0\u4ec7\u592a\u7ffc) that if he went, he would never return. While there, he grew ill, and in fall 604, he died. He was buried with Empress Dugu, but not in the same burial chamber.\n\nHow Emperor Wen died, however, is a matter of historical controversy. Most traditional historians relay and believe an account in which, while Emperor Wen was ill, Yang Guang tried to rape Consort Chen. When she reported the attempted rape to Emperor Wen, he became angry and had the officials Liu Shu (\u67f3\u8ff0, the husband of his daughter Yang Awu (\u694a\u963f\u4e94) the Princess Lanling) and Yuan Yan (\u5143\u5dd6) the Duke of Longgu summon Yang Yong, intending to restore him. When Yang Guang found out, he, in association with Yang Su, had Liu and Yuan arrested, and then sent his associate Zhang Heng (\u5f35\u8861) to kill Emperor Wen, and Zhang did so. Soon thereafter, he forced Consorts Chen and Cai to become his concubines and had Yang Yong put to death, and only then announced Emperor Wen's death and took the throne (as Emperor Yang).\n\nThe historian Sima Guang, in his Zizhi Tongjian, borrowing parts of analyses from the Book of Sui and the History of the Northern Dynasties, opined: Gaozu [Emperor Wen's temple name] was by nature cautious and solemn, and he always made sure that his orders are carried out, whether it be an order for an affirmative act or for a prohibition. He got up early in the morning to host imperial gatherings, and he would not appear tired even after noon. Although he was himself stingy, but he did not hold back his awards when rewarding the people with accomplishments. He gave much compensation to the families of soldiers who died in battle, and sent messengers to comfort them. He loved his people, encouraging them to till the field and grow mulberries, and decreasing their labor and tax burdens. He himself lived simply and frugally, and the vessels and clothes he used, even after they became worn out, continued to be patched and used. Except at feasts, his meals would contain a single meat dish. The clothes of the palace women were continued to be used even after they were washed. Based on his influence, during his reign, men only wore cotton and cloth, not silk, and their decorations were made of copper, iron, bones, and horns, not gold, silver, or gemstones. There were bountiful productions of food and textile, so much so that the storage was insufficient for them. At the start of his reign, the census rolls only had less than four million households, but at the end of his reign, there were almost nine million households, and Ji Province [(\u5180\u5dde, roughly modern Hengshui, Hebei )] by itself contained one million households. However, he was suspicious, critical, and picky, believing many alienating words of his officials. Therefore, even of those with the most accomplishments and his old friends, not one was able to maintain the relationship from start to end. He even treated his own sons as enemies. These were his faults.\n\nWendi also established seven orchestras comprising musicians from across Asia at his court; these orchestras were expanded to nine by his son Emperor Yang of Sui.\n\n\n\nPersonal information Maternal Grandfather L\u00fc Shangzhou (\u5442\u96d9\u9031), posthumously elevated to the rank of Zhuguo (\u8ffd\u8d08\u4e0a\u67f1\u570b)\n\nMaternal Grandmother Lady Yao (\u59da\u6c0f), created Lady of Qi (\u9f4a\u90e1\u592b\u4eba)\n\nFather Yang Zhong (\u694a\u5fe0), Duke Huan of Sui (507-568)\n\nMother L\u00fc Gutao (\u5442\u82e6\u6843), presumably Yang Zhong's wife\n\nWife Empress Dugu Qieluo (created 581), mother of all of Emperor Wen's children\n\nMajor Concubines Consort Chen (577-605), daughter of Emperor Xuan of Chen Consort Cai\n\nSons Yang Yong \u694a\u52c7, the Crown Prince (created 581, deposed 600, executed by Emperor Yang of Sui 604) Yang Guang \u694a\u5ee3 (569 \u2013 10 April 618), initially the Duke of Yanmen, later the Prince of Jin (created 581), later the Crown Prince (created 600), later Emperor Yang of Sui Yang Jun \u694a\u4fca (571\u2013600), Prince Xiao of Qin (created 581, d. 600) Yang Xiu \u694a\u79c0 (573\u2013618), initially the Prince of Yue (created 581), later the Prince of Shu (created 581, reduced to commoner rank 602, killed by Yuwen Huaji 618) Yang Liang \u694a\u8ad2 (575\u2013605), the Prince of Han (created 581, reduced to commoner rank 604)\n\nDaughters Yang Lihua \u694a\u9e97\u83ef (561\u2013609), empress to Emperor Xuan of northern zhou; later the Princess Leping Princess Xiangguo, married Li Changya (\u674e\u9577\u96c5) Princess Guangping, married Yuwen Jingli (\u5b87\u6587\u975c\u79ae), son of Yuwen Qing (\u5b87\u6587\u6176) Princess Wan'an, married Dou Rong, Duke of Chen (\u9673\u570b\u516c\u7ac7\u69ae) and had a son Dou Kang (\u7ac7\u6297) Yang Awu \u694a\u963f\u4e94 (573\u2013604), the Princess Lanling; married firstly Wang Fengxiao (\u738b\u5949\u5b5d); remarried after Wang's death to Liu Shu (\u67f3\u8ff0), who later became Minister of Defense under Emperor Yang\n\n"}]}
