One man determined to share music and inspiration with the world, one song and one event at a time. His name is John Cameron, and he\u2019s the driving force behind some of Edmonton\u2019s most anticipated charitable events.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a young kid, my parents used to take us to concerts all the time. I remember going to a Helen Reddy concert. One of her songs, You\u2019re My World \u2013 something about it just hit me,\u201d he says of his early foray into the world of musical entertainment. \u201cI love music! I love this entertainment thing! I\u2019ve been taking piano lessons since I was five years old, but when I was going to university, I didn\u2019t anticipate this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis\u201d would be his becoming the CEO of the John Cameron Changing Lives Foundation, formerly known as the Edmonton Singing Christmas Tree Foundation. Through the foundation, Cameron produces up to five large-scale events each year, and the proceeds from the events go to various local charities. He does this while also being the president and CEO of Keller Construction Ltd.\n\n\u201cI have a great team in both companies,\u201d he laughs when asked how he manages it all. \u201cYou rely on your team. Empower them and they run with it.\u201d\n\nHe loves to build walls, paint and work with his hands. \u201cThe tedious stuff, I love that! Put some music on and away you go! I love that!\u201d he exclaims, showing how construction and music events complement each other in his world. It is, however, his Changing Lives Foundation that feeds his soul.\n\nSo, what is the Foundation and how does it work?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that \u2013 changing lives,\u201d smiles Cameron. \u201cIt\u2019s about finding local talent, putting it on the stage and putting on an amazing show that people see, experience and leave uplifted. They leave challenged and they leave wanting to get involved in supporting the charity.\n\n\u201cIt has been very successful, monetarily. Through Changing Lives, we have been able to give money to quite a few organizations in Edmonton; however, it has also been internally successful with the people in our shows. Our choir [for the Singing Christmas Tree] has become its own organism. They have their own Facebook page. Large choirs are hard to find. They are becoming non-existent, but when we put out an email and said we are starting the Singing Christmas Tree, we had 180 people sign up in two days!\n\n\u201cI get calls and emails about people that can sing, dance or play an instrument. There is nothing better than seeing a 12-year-old get up and belt out a song where the audience is in awe, and where they get a standing ovation. You see the kid walk off the stage feeling better and with self-esteem. It changes them. It really impacts their lives. There is nothing better than that.\u201d\n\nThis year marks the 48th anniversary of the Signing Christmas Tree in Edmonton.\n\n\u201cIt really is the best Christmas show in the city. Those are not just my words. We hear that over and over again,\u201d confirms Cameron. \u201cIt\u2019s different ever year. The music is different, the comedy stuff we do is different. It\u2019s a highlight for many people at this time of the year. It gets everybody in the Christmas spirit. It\u2019s emotional and it\u2019s fun. People will cry and laugh, and they will leave uplifted. It raises money to buy instruments and lessons for kids.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s just as excited about the Foundation\u2019s latest show.\n\n\u201cThe inaugural Crescendo was this year. It\u2019s an event in support of mental health. For 10 years, I had a vision of doing a concert with a full symphony orchestra in the Francis Winspear Centre for Music, with all the proceeds going to the mental health cause. It\u2019s a personal issue for me and my family. I made a commitment that we would raise $5 million in five years for mental health causes.\n\n\u201cWe knew Crescendo would be popular, but we had no idea how it would blow up! People have gotten behind getting rid of the stigma of mental health. It was an amazing concert, and we will be doing it again next year.\u201d\n\nThe Foundation goes beyond its own productions to help other causes in the city. For example, Harvest Celebration.\n\n\u201cWe do Harvest Celebration for the Royal Alexandra Hospital Foundation to benefit the Lois Hole Hospital for Women,\u201d Cameron points out. \u201cWe have done this for the last seven years. Tickets sell out immediately and the event gets bigger every year. You see how people are changed through that [event].\u201d\n\nCameron discusses why the John Cameron Changing Lives Foundation is so important for Edmonton and Alberta, and why he believes in this city.\n\n\u201cLots of local organizations need support financially, and also with manpower and with volunteering. We do that. We get involved and try to help them out by using local talent. I try to find these young diamonds in the rough that sing or play the guitar. It really makes a difference. Using people from Edmonton puts Edmonton on the map, and now we\u2019ve had requests for Crescendo to go all across Canada!\n\n\u201cThe people of Edmonton get involved. Anytime you ask, people are there. The entrepreneurial spirit \u2013 I like that. I like the arts community with all the different festivals we have. There is so much vibrancy in the city when it comes to the arts and the entrepreneurial spirit. We are not crazy about the weather, but we embrace it! Edmonton is just a great city!\u201d\n\nHe cites, \u201cWatching people develop and grow on stage, get involved and make a difference,\u201d as his favourite part of the job, in addition to, \u201cWatching the audience stand, seeing their tears and knowing they have been changed. Then they go out, get involved and make a difference. Even my team here: watching them succeed is what really rewards me.\u201d\n\nCreating beautiful performances and life-changing events has its challenges, however, and keeping the show fresh is at the top of Cameron\u2019s list.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want people to say they have already seen that show. It always needs to be different so they don\u2019t know what they are going to see.\u201d To that end, he keeps mixing it up, bringing in the Tenors one year, and featuring the former frontman from the Barenaked Ladies the next. \u201cIt has to be fresh or people just go away.\u201d\n\nYet, he\u2019s willing to do whatever it takes keep the momentum going.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just focused on keeping it fresh, making a difference, and picking new talent,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI don\u2019t sit back enough and read the reviews and the comments. I probably should, but when I do, it\u2019s pretty overwhelming because I never thought it would come to all this.\u201d\n\nWith both Keller Construction and the John Cameron Changing Lives Foundation in his life, Cameron knows he has to stay focused and agile. He shares the lessons he\u2019s learned about balancing it all while moving both companies forward, year after year.\n\n\u201cTake a risk!\u201d he encourages. \u201cIf you sit back and don\u2019t take a risk, you won\u2019t get the highs. I\u2019ve taken lots of risks. Not all of them have worked, but you need to [take a risk] if you want to make a difference.\n\n\u201cFrom my personal experience, you need to be humble. Be there to lead, but let others succeed. Be there to support them, but let the results show. Let your team succeed and give them the spotlight.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do it all yourself. You just can\u2019t. You need to rely on your team. I\u2019m so fortunate that I have an amazing team at Keller and at my Foundation that allows me to do the things that I\u2019m good at, and they do what they are great at. That is why we are so successful.\n\n\u201cTime flies\u2026time flies! If I had thought 25 years would have gone by this quickly, I would have done a lot of things differently. I look at young people trying to succeed and they give up their kids or their wives. You HAVE to have that balance.\u201d\n\nCameron works toward that balance by keeping his mind, body and relationships healthy. He enjoys Orangetheory Fitness and tries to do the program five days a week. He enjoys taking his dog, Roxy, to the dog park and loves walking around the river. He travels and listens to the local music in each destination, getting inspiration for the next event. He also enjoys going to concerts and volunteering on boards, and like a true Edmontonian, \u201cI love the Oilers! Love them!\u201d\n\nThe philanthropist thanks his parents, Wayne and Marleen, and is sister, Kim, for their support, inspiration and encouragement. He also says of his daughter, Kristen, \u201cShe taught me how to keep going and be positive.\u201d He credits Entrepreneurs\u2019 Organization, which he joined in 1998, for helping him to build his company and Foundation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a strong proponent that if you don\u2019t put something in, you can\u2019t take something out,\u201d Cameron concludes. \u201cIf everyone in Edmonton just took, there would be nothing left for the people that need help. How many times have you gone to a bank machine and money just came out? Never. You have to put that chipped card in that tells the machine you worked hard and put something in so you can take something out.\u201d\n\nHe plans to give back into perpetuity, creating events and initiatives that will live on long after he\u2019s gone. \u201c[The John Cameron Changing Lives Foundation] will continue to make a difference in people\u2019s lives through music. We will also be taking Crescendo on the road across Canada, and we will continue to discover and develop new talent to help all the charities that need help. And we will continue having fun!\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.alberta.ca/meet-the-farmers-and-property-rights-advocate.aspx", "page_content": "In October 2020, the Farmers' Advocate Office (FAO) merged with the Property Rights Advocate Office (PRAO) to form the new Farmers\u2019 and Property Rights Advocate Offices (FPRAO).

Cameron), prospector; b. 1 Sept. 1820 in Charlottenburg Township, Glengarry County, Upper Canada, son of Angus Cameron and Isabella McDougal; m. first 20 Feb. 1860 Margaret Sophia Groves; m. secondly 1 March 1865 Christina Adelaide Wood; d. 7 Nov. 1888 at Barkerville, B.C.\n\nJohn Cameron spent much of his early life in Glengarry County. In the 1850s he was in California, apparently as a prospector, but had returned to Glengarry by 1860. When gold was discovered that year in the Cariboo district of the British Columbia interior, Cameron decided to go there. He arrived at Victoria, Vancouver Island, in February 1862 with his wife and an infant daughter who died soon after. In Victoria, Cameron met Robert Stevenson, another native of Glengarry County, who backed him in his first venture in British Columbia, that of transporting supplies into the Cariboo gold district. Cameron was also a partner in a small company which in August staked a claim on Williams Creek in the Cariboo \u2013 the famous Cameron Claim.\n\nOn 22 Dec. 1862 the miners on the Cameron Claim \u201cstruck it very rich at 22 feet.\u201d The claim soon became one of the largest operations in the Cariboo district and its success made Cameron a wealthy man. But prior to the strike, on 23 October, Margaret Sophia Cameron had died of typhoid fever and Cameron was determined to take his wife\u2019s body back to Canada West for burial. On the last day of January 1863 Cameron and Stevenson, escorted for a time by other miners, set out on a gruelling 400-mile journey to Victoria, hauling Sophia\u2019s body on a toboggan. They reached Victoria on 7 March and the body was buried there in an alcohol-filled coffin, pending its removal to the east. Cameron then returned to Williams Creek where he spent the summer working his claim.\n\nIn October 1863 Cameron left the Cariboo and, taking the coffin with him, travelled by way of the Isthmus of Panama and New York, reaching Cornwall, Canada West, before the end of the year. In December he had the coffin reburied. In March 1865 Cameron married Christina Adelaide Wood of Osnabruck Township and in July he laid the cornerstone of his imposing new residence, Fairfield House, at Summerstown in Glengarry County. In this period of prosperity, Cameron\u2019s often rash behaviour, extravagance, and arrogance tended to foster hostile speculation on how he had obtained his fortune. This speculation included references to the first Mrs Cameron, and there was much gossip about the contents of the mysterious sealed coffin. It was even suggested that an appearance of death was contrived and that Cameron had actually sold his wife to an Indian chief for gold. In 1873, more than ten years after his first wife\u2019s death, Cameron could bear his tormentors no longer and had the coffin raised. The face of Mrs Cameron, almost perfectly preserved in the alcohol, was exposed to the scrutiny of the public.\n\nHis windfall melted away, Cameron returned to British Columbia in 1886 or 1887. He died a poor man at Barkerville, the scene of his gold-mining success, and was buried nearby in the cemetery at Camerontown, a village named after him.\n\nRoyce MacGillivray"}, {"url": "https://www.graincentral.com/people-on-the-move/from-pioneering-no-till-advocate-to-ag-communications-guru-john-cameron/", "page_content": "WHEN John Cameron took up his first job as product development research officer with Monsanto at Emerald in Central Queensland (CQ) in the early 1980s the region was losing around 20 tonnes/hectare of soil each year to the ravages of erosion.\n\nIt was a time when the established farming practice was to run multiple cultivations to suppress weeds and prepare fine-tilth seedbeds \u2013 a system that ultimately led to soil structural issues and exposed the landscape to high erosion risk.\n\nIn concert with other agricultural leaders in CQ, including recently-retired agricultural consultant, Graham Spackman, Mr Cameron set about the challenge of encouraging the region\u2019s farmers to change their farming systems over to zero-till regimes.\n\nToday, the sloping farming country of CQ is largely farmed by stubble-retaining, moisture-conserving, no-till systems that have increased soil water retention, created greater cropping opportunities and delivered more consistent levels of ground cover which have helped alleviate the erosion issues.\n\nMr Cameron\u2019s early years in CQ were one of the many hallmarks of a career that saw him move to Moree in north west New South Wales in 1985 to take up roles in research and dryland agronomy consulting, then on to Sydney in 1989 to work with agricultural chemical companies in broadacre cropping and cotton.\n\nIt was in 1995 that he took the bold decision to branch out and found the agronomy and communications business, Independent Consultants Australia Network (ICAN), which has, for nearly quarter of a century, stamped its mark as the key provider of the Grains Research and Development Corporation\u2019s (GRDC) suite of research updates throughout the northern growing region.\n\nDriving the no-till revolution\n\nBorn and raised in Victoria, Mr Cameron completed an agricultural science honours degree at Melbourne University before taking up his first appointment with Monsanto in CQ.\n\n\u201cMy brief was to do whatever was necessary to get no-till running in CQ. I worked as closely as I could with agronomists and soil conservation guys,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe country was still being opened up at 50,000 hectares a year in those days. I recall vividly the 1982 drought and 1983 flood. The rain of the 1983 flood started on the same day as the Emerald B&S recovery. We had about 200 inebriated youth in town for the next four weeks as you couldn\u2019t go north, south, east or west.\u201d\n\nMr Cameron said the driving force behind the adoption of no-till farming in CQ was the need to contain the soil erosion problem that was rampant throughout the area at the time.\n\n\u201cCover was and is king. You just have to have sufficient crops to generate soil cover to capture water efficiently and make it available for the next crop, particularly in the high intensity summer storm environments in Central Queensland,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Cameron said in the early 1980s one of the challenges of convincing growers to adopt the new system of farming was that it required a massive change in thinking away from established practices.\n\n\u201cPeople would tell you: \u201cYou have to aerate the soil, mate\u201d. That was a big thing. So, it was an intergenerational change for people to change the farming system and trust it could be done,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt often meant not only management change but machinery change. One of the other impediments was the cost of glyphosate back then. That reduced over time.\n\n\u201cThe other major change was tramlining. We really needed the massive technology shift that was afforded by self-steer tractors and GPS positioning to enable farmers to accurately map in the paddock and not over spray or under spray and leave massive gaps. That has been a huge enabling technology for no-till.\u201d\n\nMr Cameron, said no-till ultimately became a huge success story, not only in CQ but throughout Australia, because conservation methodologies and responsible resource management methodologies married with high production outcomes.\n\n\u201cWe have increased the width and time of sowing windows, we have increased rain capture, water use efficiency and yield. It has ticked all the boxes while protecting the resource base,\u201d he said.\n\nFarming challenges ahead\n\nLooking ahead, Mr Cameron said Australia\u2019s farming sector faced challenges on a number of fronts.\n\n\u201cOne is herbicide resistance and our ability to efficiently sustain the system that now underpins farming across the country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAustralia is a dry climate and we are absolutely reliant on our ability to capture water, moreso than most climates, so climate change and temperature changes are going to make it a lot harder for us than they are for some of our competitors.\u201d\n\nMr Cameron said another looming challenge related to soil carbon levels and plant nutrient supply.\n\n\u201cI see a storm coming with the issues we are seeing with climate change, coupled with a lot of the free lunches from nitrogen available through soil organic carbon that are now used and gone,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOrganic carbon, particularly with the profile of release that it had, really buffered our systems for nitrogen demand across a range of outcomes. We have lost a lot of that nitrogen buffering capacity.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we are starting to see widespread need for phosphate fertilisers, particularly deep applied P in the northern region.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s concerning when you couple those two things with the greater difficulty of sustaining fallow efficiency through good weed control due to herbicide resistance or the increasing dominance of weeds that are hard to kill with the current suite of herbicides.\n\n\u201cThat poses an enormous challenge for the next generation of researchers, agronomists and farmers.\u201d\n\nPrecision ag adoption\n\nMr Cameron said Australian farmers had been at the forefront of applying some of the latest precision and automation technologies, but had been slow to take up others.\n\n\u201cIn the short to medium term we have seen rapid adoption of global positioning for driving tractors and precision placement of seeds. The adoption of GPS-based systems has made the apparent size of paddocks shrink which has meant massive savings on input costs and efficiencies,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we have seen a lack of adoption of some of the more data-driven processes that see more variable rate approaches.\n\n\u201cThere are some early adopters who have been mapping soil and yields for years and putting the two together to fertilise with higher rates where there are deeper soils and higher yield expectations. That makes a lot of sense.\n\n\u201cBut, across the board, the percentage of land area that is taking up those variable rate challenges has been below expectations.\u201d\n\nMr Cameron said from studies on what drove adoption, one of the outcomes was that if there are no barriers to technology adoption and a big bottom line benefit there was massive early adoption.\n\nBut as you start winding back either the bottom line benefit or increased the barriers to adoption, although there might still be significant profitability, adoption levels declined.\n\n\u201cThat seems to have been the case with some of the more advanced aspects of variable rate technology at this point,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAn impediment has been the low speed of data transfer speed in Australia, which I think that may be part of the answer, but also part of the excuse, to explain the lower levels of adoption.\u201d\n\nAg communications specialist\n\nIn establishing ICAN in 1995, Mr Cameron saw the opportunity to pitch a proposal to the GRDC for a more streamlined and structured system of relaying research findings to the wider agricultural communities.\n\nThe GRDC accepted the proposal and the successful formula of the now widely-attended GRDC updates was born.\n\nThe program started with five, one-day updates targeted at agronomists in the northern region and expanded the next year to both agronomist- and grower-targeted updates.\n\nToday, the updates are a high-priority fixture on the calendars of agronomists and farmers throughout the north.\n\nMr Cameron has become the widely-recognised figure at the helm, using his skills as a grains communications specialist to bridge the gap between industry research developments and on-farm adoption.\n\n\u201cThere is all this money spent on generating good information and data and our key conduit to get this to the grower networks is via the agronomists who are working hand in hand with those individuals on a paddock by paddock basis,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEveryone is in information overload, so it is a real filtering job. Their role is to filter which information is appropriate to their growers and to help those growers implement profitable outcomes on their properties.\u201d\n\nCOVID forces switch to webinars\n\nWith COVID-19 restrictions coming into force in 2020, Mr Cameron said the updates program in the latter half of this year was too difficult to run as face-to-face events, so the decision was made to run them all as webinars.\n\n\u201cWe selected a subset of 23 issues to run as webinars to replace the nine updates held at venues throughout NSW and Queensland,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGiven the success of the webinar format, we now have a subset of people who, for a range of reasons, don\u2019t come to the live updates. So, the plan for next year is to keep the live updates first and foremost, but out of the 16 one-day updates next year we are going to drop two of those and use that budget to run a number of webinars.\u201d\n\nMr Cameron said he expected to still be operating in a COVID-19 environment into the first half of next year, so the three, major, two-day updates scheduled for Wagga Wagga, Dubbo and Goondiwindi would be conducted under a revised format.\n\n\u201cWe will be running a two-day agenda at Dubbo and Wagga Wagga, but instead of having multiple concurrent sessions with people moving around we will try to minimise movement by running one general plenary session. There will be two separate cohorts of growers and agronomists at those venues,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBecause Goondiwindi is on the NSW-Queensland border, there is still the risk of border closure, so we have cancelled the Goondiwindi update and, instead, will run two, one-day updates at Narrabri in northern NSW and Dalby in southern Queensland. The rest of the one-day updates scheduled are going ahead as normal.\u201d\n\nMr Cameron is a fellow of the Australian Institute of Agriculture and the 2011 recipient of the GRDC Seed of Light Award.\n\nIn his spare time he enjoys getting away from it all through his passion for hiking and fishing.\n\nGrain Central: Get our free cropping news straight to your inbox \u2013 Click here"}, {"url": "https://www.reddeeradvocate.com/opinion/cameron-was-right/", "page_content": "Movie director James Cameron can teach Alberta politicians some things about their own craft.\n\nMovie director James Cameron can teach Alberta politicians some things about their own craft.\n\nBefore visiting this week, he was widely slagged in Alberta as a self-aggrandizing, know-nothing Los Angeles celebrity.\n\nHe proved that\u2019s not true.\n\nCameron obviously did considerable study on the oilsands before arriving here. He listened carefully as he was toured around by politicians, oil executives and aboriginal leaders.\n\nAt a news conference on Wednesday after those meetings, he was able to speak fluidly for 30 minutes without notes, responding effectively to reporters\u2019 questions.\n\nMany Albertans wish that some of our politicians, especially our premier, could do as well.\n\nCameron also had the political smarts to acknowledge that he was wrong when he previously referred to the oilsands as a \u201cblack eye\u201d for Alberta.\n\nIn a meeting with The Edmonton Journal editorial board, Cameron admitted that he was \u201cill-informed\u201d in making that statement.\n\nThen, he extended the point to an unassailable conclusion: \u201cIt has the capacity to be the biggest black eye in Canadian history or it\u2019s got the capacity to be a place in which Alberta and Canada rise to a challenge and show leadership.\u201d\n\nAmen, Brother Cameron.\n\nExtracting oil more deliberately, with ever-increasing sophistication and environmental awareness, will be good for Alberta, Canada and the world.\n\nRemember, the resource belongs to Albertans, not the government and not the oil companies.\n\nThe petroleum in Alberta\u2019s three major oilsands deposits \u2014 near Fort McMurray, Cold Lake and Peace River \u2014 has been in the ground for millions of years. It can be a financial boon to generations of future Albertans if we manage it right.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t always been done that way.\n\nThe first deposits, at or near the ground\u2019s surface around Fort McMurray, were strip mined, with environmental consequences that we have only recently begun to appreciate.\n\nThe consortium of oil companies that made up Syncrude was so anxious to begin producing oil as fast as possible that they signed cost-plus contracts with the construction companies.\n\nThe more those companies spent building the plant, the higher their profits rose. There was no constraint on costs.\n\nThat fact, coupled with the massive size of Syncrude, was a key element in driving up massive inflation rates across Canada in the late 1970s. That ultimately killed businesses, jobs and cost many Albertans their homes.\n\nFor a long time, Albertans received only a one per cent royalty on every barrel produced until the oil companies had fully recouped all their extravagant construction costs.\n\nThe insanity of reckless boom-time spending began to repeat itself in the oilpatch again this decade, until the global financial meltdown brought it up short.\n\nAlberta has a chance to get it right in the third wave of oilsands development that is now upon us.\n\nFrom an environmental perspective, some things are improving by default, if not by design.\n\nNew plants, like those of Suncor, are extracting the bitumen with steam-injected underground pipes, rather than pit mines.\n\nIt\u2019s more expensive but produces far fewer toxic emissions. The process uses a lot of water, but 95 per cent of it is recycled and re-used.\n\nBig oil companies think in generation\u2011long strategic planning cycles rather than the time horizons of politicians, which often seem as short as the next news cycle.\n\nThey know that Alberta\u2019s oilsands are a massive long-term financial and strategic resource. They know that oil cannot be easily or cheaply replaced as a fuel source. They know that as oil reserves dwindle globally, its price will rise.\n\nThey know, without question, that environmental stewardship has become a huge factor in their ability to generate profits and attract investment. (See: BP, Gulf oil spill)\n\nAlberta politicians must know this, too.\n\nWe can develop our resources prudently, patiently and profitably in an environmentally responsible manner.\n\nThat\u2019s something Cameron knows well.\n\nHis business and his personal habits produce a substantial carbon footprint. He lives in an 8,300-square-foot house in Malibu, adjacent to a 6,700-square-foot house that he uses as a movie production centre.\n\nCameron frequently flies on private jets but he had the political savvy to arrive in Edmonton this week on a commercial airliner.\n\nBut Cameron did not come to fame and fortune as the most powerful person in Hollywood (according to a recent poll of his peers) because he\u2019s an environmental paragon or makes the world\u2019s best movies.\n\nHe\u2019s revered because he consistently makes the most profitable movies.\n\nCameron spends a lot of time, energy and thought before greenlighting any new project.\n\nIn dealing with the oilsands, that\u2019s another area where the Alberta government could follow his lead.\n\nJoe McLaughlin retired from the Advocate last year after 25 years as managing editor."}, {"url": "https://www.canadashistory.ca/explore/women/36-more-great-women", "page_content": "In 2016, Canada\u2019s History decided to mark the centennial of the first women to win the vote in Canada \u2014 in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta in 1916 \u2014 by celebrating great women from Canada\u2019s past. We highlighted thirty of Canada\u2019s outstanding women and asked our readers to vote for whom they thought was the \u201cgreatest.\u201d\n\nTo create our list, we recruited a panel of prominent Canadians \u2014 former Governor General Adrienne Clarkson; bestselling author Charlotte Gray; historians Mich\u00e8le Dagenais (Universit\u00e9 de Montreal), Tina Loo (University of British Columbia), and Joan Sangster (Trent University); and author and English professor Aritha van Herk (University of Calgary).\n\nAll the while, we knew that list was too short. Our visitors flooded us with nominations for women not on the list and this year we wanted to honour their suggestions by presenting short biographies of another thirty-six outstanding women.\n\nLaura Secord (1775-1868) Heroine, wife, and mother. In 1812, Laura Secord courageously rescued her husband, James Secord, after he was wounded at the Battle of Queenston Heights. Her husband was still recovering when, the following summer, American soldiers advanced into the Niagara Peninsula and were being billeted at their home. On June 21,1813, Secord overheard American officers plan an attack. She is believed to have walked thirty-two kilometres through rough terrain from her home in Queenston, Upper Canada (Ontario), to warn Lieutenant James FitzGibbon of the surprise attack at Beaver Dams. Facing imminent danger, she reached FitzGibbon in time for him to prepare an ambush, forcing the U.S. general and five hundred soldiers to surrender. Secord was never properly recognized for her heroic feat until after her death.\n\nIrma Levasseur (1878\u20131964) Pediatrician and co-founder of Sainte-Justine Children\u2019s Hospital. In 1894, Irma Levasseur pursued a career in medicine but as a woman she was unable to get a suitable university education in Canada. She went to Minneapolis to study for six years but was not admitted to the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Quebec until 1903. Levasseur travelled to Europe to learn more about early childhood disease and with others founded the Saint-Justine Hospital in Montreal in 1907. She went on to work in Serbia, the Red Cross in New York, and, returning to Canada, used her own savings to help found the H\u00f4pital de l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus in Quebec City in 1922. In 1927, she opened her own clinic for disabled children in nearby Saint-Jean-Baptiste.

Born Jane Smillie, near Hensall, Ontario, she became a teacher until she had saved enough money to attend Kingston\u2019s Ontario Medical College in 1906 (integrated into the University of Toronto medical school). She graduated in 1909, but could find no hospital in Toronto to take her residency. She attended Philadelphia\u2019s Women\u2019s Medical College to do her internship and returned to Canada in 1911. Smillie performed her first Canadian operation in a private home, as hospitals would not give women operating privileges. In 1911, she helped start Toronto\u2019s Women\u2019s College Hospital where she was the chair of gynecology from 1912 to 1942. She married at the age of seventy and lived until 103.\n\nFlora Isabel MacDonald (1926\u20132015) Canadian politician and humanitarian, first female foreign minister, and one of the first women to vie for leadership of a major Canadian political party (Progressive Conservative).

Murphy was a self-taught legal expert and her tireless work helped to pass the 1911 Dower Act in Alberta. This legislation protected a woman\u2019s right to one-third of her husband\u2019s property. When she and a group of women were not allowed to attend a prostitution trial in Edmonton because it was seen as \u201cnot fit for mixed company,\u201d Murphy protested. In response, she was appointed as the first female police magistrate in the British Empire. Murphy also spent twelve years fighting for women to be declared \u201cpersons,\u201d after being challenged on this when she became a magistrate. Murphy and four of her friends \u2014 the \u201cFamous Five\u201d \u2014 finally won their fight in 1929 when the Privy Council in Britain declared women as legal \u201cpersons\u201d who were eligible to serve in the Senate.\n\nMarguerite d\u2019Youville (1701\u20131771) Activist for the rights of the poor, founder of the Order of Sisters of Charity of Montreal (Grey Nuns) and the first Canadian-born person to be declared a saint by the Roman Catholic Church.

There, she taught the children of rural French settlers and provided support to the Filles du Roi \u2014 young women sent to Canada as brides for settlers. Her desire to take on an active public role in the community rather than to remain cloistered put her at odds with Bishop Fran\u00e7ois de Laval.

In 1936, she returned to the classroom and began organizing female rural teachers into an association. Hundreds of troubled teachers gathered and soon created the Association des institutrices rurales de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, of which Laure Gaudreault was first president. She continued to devote herself to improving the salaries, pensions, and working conditions of rural and retired teachers well into the 1960s.\n\nLizzie Cyr (?) A Calgary woman charged with vagrancy, whose case was linked to the Persons Case. History has largely forgotten Lizzie Cyr. Her recorded narrative begins in May of 1917. She was broke, without a place to sleep and ended up spending a few nights in the home of John James Ryan. Ryan, who subsequently suffered a bout of gonorrhoea, had her arrested and charged with vagrancy. Her defence lawyer, John McKinley Cameron appealed her conviction on the grounds that the female magistrate who made the ruling did not have the legal authority to act as a judge because, as a woman, she was not a person under the British North America Act. The Alberta Court of Appeal struck down the appeal, a decision later overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada. The Persons Case eventually came before the British Privy Council, which asserted that women were in fact persons under constitutional law.\n\nRita Joe (1932\u20132007) Poet laureate of the Mi\u2019kmaq nation. Rita Joe was a gifted poet whose writing is marked by compassion, candour, and dignity. Joe was born and raised in Whycocomagh on Cape Breton Island. Orphaned at ten, Joe attended Shubenacadie Indian Residential School for four years. She began writing in 1969 with a column in the Micmac News, and released her first collection of poetry in 1978. In her lifetime, Joe published five poetry collections and an autobiography. Joe\u2019s writing and message of gentle resilience has garnered her many honours, including the Order of Canada (1989), the Queen\u2019s Privy Council for Canada (1992), National Aboriginal Achievement Award (1997), and a number of honorary doctorates.\n\nMary Travers-Bolduc (1894\u20131941) The queen of Canadian folksingers. Mary Travers-Bolduc, called \u201cLa Bolduc,\u201d was the pre-eminent French Canadian singer-songwriter of the 1930s. Born into poverty, Travers had known only hardship until she got her first break in 1929 with the recording \u201cLa Cuisini\u00e8re.\u201d She soon became a household name in French Canada and the eastern United States. Drawing on the musical traditions of her Irish and French Canadian parents, Travers\u2019 music gave voice to the experiences and hardships of working class people during the Great Depression. Her recordings capture the current events of her day with characteristic charm, wit, and frankness. Beloved in her own day, Travers laid the foundations for the 1950s folk revival and later generations of French Canadian singers.\n\nJean B. Lumb (1919\u20132002) Community leader and activist. Jean Lumb was an adept businesswoman and a prominent leader of Toronto\u2019s Chinese community. In the 1950s, Lumb played a critical role in helping to end discriminatory immigration laws that prevented Asian permanent residents from bringing family members to Canada. Lumb\u2019s relentless community work helped to raise Canadians\u2019 awareness of Chinese culture. She was a successful restaurateur, founded a Chinese dance organization, and was the president of the Women\u2019s Association of the Chinese Dramatic Association for 25 years. Lumb also led the \u201cSave Chinatown Committee\u201d that lobbied successfully to protect Toronto\u2019s Chinatown from expropriation in the 1960s. In 1976, Lumb became the first restaurateur and the first Chinese Canadian woman to be inducted into the Order of Canada.\n\nSubscribe to Canada's History Save as much as 52% off the cover price! 6 issues per year as low as $29.95.

Mary Brant, also known as Molly and Konwatsi\u2019tsiai\u00e9nni, occupied a crucial intermediary role between the Haudenosaunee Confederacy and the colonial British government. During the American War of Independence, Brant joined the Loyalist cause. Raised in a matriarchal society, she drew upon her status as the head of a council of Haudenosaunee clan mothers to rally the Confederacy in its alliance with Britain against the American rebels. Ultimately, many Haudenosaunee people felt betrayed by Britain\u2019s decision to cede their territory to the Americans after the war. While Brant\u2019s legacy continues to be debated, it is clear that she played an instrumental role in shaping the borders of eighteenth century North America.\n\nStella Burry (1897\u20131991) Tireless volunteer and community worker. Stella Burry was an extraordinarily active member of her church and community throughout life. Burry worked in Newfoundland during the Great Depression and developed a host of social programs and services, managing as many as forty volunteers at a time. She was the force behind an incredible variety of initiatives, including clothing and food services, a transitional home for women moving to the city, programs for seniors and patients in mental hospitals, and a co-operative women\u2019s credit union, to name just a few. Burry never married, believing she would have to give up her community work and activism if she did. In 1995, a charity named Stella\u2019s Circle was established in Burry\u2019s honour to continue her indispensable work.\n\nShawnadithit (1801\u20131829) Beothuk survivor and cultural witness. Shawnadithit is often referred to as the last surviving member of the Beothuk, the original inhabitants of Newfoundland. By the time she was a young woman, Shawnadithit had witnessed the decline of the Beothuk from disease, starvation, and settler violence. In 1823, Shawnadithit was captured by a white trapper and eventually came to live St. John\u2019s where she worked with the Boethick [Beothuk] Institution to record her knowledge of her people. Much of our current understanding of the Beothuk derives from Shawnadithit\u2019s maps, drawings, word lists, and stories. Shawnadithit was known for her sharp intelligence, uncanny artistic ability, and proud demeanour. Despite a life of tragedy, she provided invaluable witness to the culture and history of her people.\n\nMarie Rollet (? \u20131649) Pioneering woman. Marie Rollet was the first European woman to settle permanently in New France. In 1617, Rollet arrived at Quebec with her husband, Louis H\u00e9bert, and three children. Her family established a farm, which later became the colony\u2019s first seigneury. Rollet shared closely in the work of her husband, an apothecary, and would have taken an active role in traditionally male activities like clearing land, constructing buildings, harvesting food, and skinning animals. As a religious woman, Rollet also took an interest in educating and proselytizing Indigenous people within the colony. In the 1630s her home became a residence for Indigenous girls who were studying with the Jesuit missionaries. Today Rollet and her husband are commemorated with a prominent statue in Quebec City\u2019s Montmorency Park.\n\nMuriel McQueen Fergusson (1899\u20131997) First female Speaker of the Senate and committed advocate for women. Muriel McQueen Fergusson was the first woman to be appointed as a judge in New Brunswick, the first to be elected to Fredericton\u2019s city council, and was that city\u2019s first female deputy mayor. Fergusson was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 1953, and later became its first female Speaker. In all of these positions Fergusson was an advocate for women and the less privileged. As a senator, she brought in young women as pages, insisted on pay equity, and served on committees pertaining to unemployment, divorce, women\u2019s prisons, poverty, and old age. In her inaugural Senate speech, Fergusson noted simply, \u201cIf I can be of help to women in getting justice, I will.\u201d\n\nSylvia Fedoruk (1927\u20132012) Renowned for her work on using radiation to diagnose and treat cancer. Sylvia Fedoruk became a radiation physicist at the Saskatoon Cancer Clinic in 1951. There she helped to establish the world\u2019s first cobalt radiation therapy unit, a technology that is estimated to have helped over 70 million people worldwide. For this and many other achievements, Fedoruk has been recognized with numerous appointments and honours. She was inducted as an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1986, served as Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan from 1988 to 1994, was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame in 2009, and was awarded the Queen\u2019s Jubilee Medal in 2012. Fedoruk was also an accomplished athlete and an inductee of the Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame and the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame.\n\nSusanna Moodie (1803\u20131885) Pioneering Canadian author. Susanna Moodie (n\u00e9e Strickland) was an accomplished author whose work vividly captures the pioneer life in Upper Canada. In 1832, Moodie and her husband immigrated to Upper Canada, where the two attempted to establish a farm. Moodie drew upon her experiences in the backwoods of the colony for literary inspiration. Her best-known book, Roughing It in the Bush, was widely read in Canada, Britain, and the United States, and is considered one of the canonical works of Canadian literature. A prolific writer, Moodie\u2019s output includes novels, children\u2019s books, memoirs, and poetry collections. Her work has inspired and drawn commentary from the likes of Northrop Frye, Carol Shields, and Margaret Atwood, whose 1970 poetry collection is entitled The Journals of Susanna Moodie."}, {"url": "https://www.electriccanadian.com/makers/johncameron.htm", "page_content": "John Hillyard Cameron was regarded by most contemporaries as the most formidable rival of John A. Macdonald for the leadership of the Upper Canadian Conservative Party during the vital mid-century decades which cover the years of Confederation. It is significant that both men were Scots, and both joined the Orange Lodges, Macdonald at the outset of his career in the mid-1840\u2019s and Cameron at the height of his influence in 1856. Macdonald remained a nominal Orangeman, keeping an eye on the internal politics of the Order, with the next election in mind. Yet Cameron, the latecomer and more conventional politician, was made Grand Master three years after becoming an Orangeman.\n\n\n\nAcceptance of this office appeared at first to make Cameron more formidable in the struggle for power. Yet the great question in mid nineteenth century politics was who was to occupy the middle of the road, and under what conditions. By becoming Orange Grand Master, Cameron moved further from the centre, and was, like George Brown, to remain a regional personality, unable to displace politicians like Francis Hincks and John A. Macdonald, whose first thoughts were for combinations of men and who never permitted themselves to become prisoners of platforms or slogans.\n\n\n\nCameron was born in Beaucaire, Languedoc, France, in 1817, where his father, Angus Cameron, quartermaster of the 79th Cameron Highlanders, was stationed during the post-Waterloo occupation which ended in 1818. His mother was the daughter of Samuel Hillyard of Saint Ives, Huntingdonshire, apparently a gentleman of substance. Later, Angus Cameron became paymaster of the Royal Canadian Rifles, raised by the Imperial government for services in Canada.\n\n\n\nAfter leaving France, the Camerons went to Ireland where John Hillyard attended Kilkenny College until 1825 when his father was posted to Kingston in Upper Canada. Here young Cameron went to Kingston Grammar School, which was run by the Reverend John Cruikshank. Among his schoolmates were John A. Macdonald, Oliver Mowat, the future premier of Ontario, and Henry Scadding, the future historian of Toronto. At school Cameron shone among his contemporaries, being diligent, and acquiring with relative ease the kind of intellectual polish which wins early recognition from teachers, while the less attentive Macdonald give no hint of his latent talent for political combinations.\n\n\n\nIn 1831, when his father was transferred to York, John Hillyard was able to display his abilities at Upper Canada College where they soon attracted the notice of leading families of the capital, and of Archdeacon John Strachan, who was a connoisseur of talent. On leaving school, he studied law under the guidance of John Henry Boulton, whose third daughter, Elizabeth, he married in 1847. During the troubles of 1837-38, he served in Toronto and on the Niagara frontier as a captain in the Queen\u2019s Rangers.\n\n\n\nAdmitted to the bar in 1838, Cameron played a leading role on the Commission appointed to revise the statutes of Upper Canada in 1840, edited the Upper Canadian Law Reports in 1841, and became Queen\u2019s Counsel in 1846.\n\n\n\nDuring these years Cameron demonstrated mastery of precise and dignified prose, which demands skill and patience rather than creative imagination. Apart from this talent, much prized among legislators, Cameron demonstrated outstanding ability by his performance at the bar. Here his capacity for close reasoning and precise language was supported by a theatrical talent which excited ridicule at times, but undoubtedly made him the best lawyer in the province.\n\n\n\nIn the early forties, while Macdonald was displaying his less spectacular gifts on the smaller stage of Kingston, his former classmate had demonstrated remarkable ability and acquired excellent connections. Cameron\u2019s political future seemed assured, as his demonstrated ability at the bar would make him a commanding figure in the Assembly.\n\n\n\nThe Toronto Compact families were anxious to acquire the services of talented young men whom they considered to be socially and politically respectable. John Beverly Robinson was himself a protege of Archdeacon Strachan\u2019s, and in turn had recognized the ability of William Henry Draper, who by the mid-1840\u2019s had become the recognized leader of Upper Canadian Conservatism.\n\n\n\nAfter the Lafontaine-Baldwin ministry had been dismissed, Draper, at the request of the governor, Sir Charles Metcalfe, had formed a government and had gone to the country. He won the election of 1844 by a Loyalist coalition which included Compact Tories like Sir Allan MacNab, the Orange Grand Master Ogle Gowan, the Methodist Egerton Ryerson, and independent Conservatives like John A. Macdonald.\n\n\n\nAlthough the coalition had a majority, it failed to secure French-Canadian support and was weakened by internal divisions. By 1846 Draper, as a moderate Conservative, sought to strengthen his position within the government by dismissing Solicitor-General Henry Sherwood, a Compact Tory, and offered the post to John Hillyard Cameron. The offer was accepted and Draper acquired the services of a more able and manageable young man, who was nevertheless linked to Compact Tories.\n\n\n\nAlthough Cameron\u2019s appointment strengthened Draper\u2019s influence, it was seen by Ogle Gowan, the Orange leader, who was an occasional ally of Henry Sherwood, as a victory for Compact interests. Gowan insisted that Draper and his moderate colleagues, William Morris and John A. Macdonald, who had also accepted office, would become a facade for Compact government. In his view, the Cabinet would be managed by \u201cHenry John Bolton, the father-in-law, William L. Robinson, the brother-in-law, John Hillyard Cameron, the son-in-law, William Cayley, another Bolton son-in-law, with Sir Allan MacNab, whose wife is Mr. Bolton\u2019s niece, to direct the family.\u201d This view is interesting only as a reflection of Gowan\u2019s reaction to the appearance of the future Orange Grand Master in provincial politics, for Cameron, whatever his connections, was prepared to support Draper.\n\n\n\nAs there was no general election at the time of Cameron\u2019s appointment, a seat had to be found for him in a Cornwall byelection, where he was returned by party influence, although the name Cameron was an advantage in an area which had been settled by Scots. Draper seems to have regarded Cameron as his successor, but there was no time for an adequate apprenticeship. In May, 1847, a year after Cameron had accepted office, Draper retired from politics, accepting an appointment as judge. He invited Cameron to take over his post as attorney-general which, in effect, meant accepting the leadership of the ministry. it was an offer to take command of a sinking ship.\n\n\n\nEven if Cameron had been able to put together a ministry, the absence of French-Canadian support, and the impossibility of getting it, ensured defeat in the next election. By making an effort to form a ministry, Cameron would have established his position as the leading representative of moderate Conservatism. However, he preferred to let Henry Sherwood make the effort, while he himself remained aboard the sinking ship, accepting a position on the Executive Council. Sherwood\u2019s ministry was swept away in the winter election of 1847-48, although Cameron was able to retain his seat. His refusal to accept office as attorney-general had left moderate Conservatism without a recognized leader, though Cameron might still assert his claim by playing a leading role in the opposition.\n\n\n\nCameron understood that a future Conservative success depended on winning French-Canadian support and he sought to accomplish this by an alliance of Catholics and Anglicans on the question of separate schools. Had he succeeded, he would have occupied a more central position in politics, which was the key to the effective exercise of power. Cameron made a beginning but Francis Hincks, who had already pre-empted the middle of the road, was able to dissolve the emerging alliance between Anglicans and Catholics by giving concessions to Catholics, but none to Anglicans.\n\n\n\nIf Cameron had remained in provincial politics and accepted the necessary but tedious task of bringing fragments and factions into temporary alliances, he might still have become the great Conservative leader of the century. It was not to his taste and in what he probably regarded as a strategic retreat, he decided not to contest his Cornwall seat in 1851. Instead he devoted his energies to municipal politics in Toronto, and to building up a financial empire.\n\n\n\nIn so doing, he became one of the leading figures in Toronto, but Toronto was not a good political base because it was tied to regional interests, and because of the diversity of its politics, it could never become a safe seat. Cornwall was not a safe seat, either, but Cameron might have secured his position there over the years, as the town had the advantage of being in that eastern section of Upper Canada which profited by the union of provinces and was consequently less susceptible to the pull of regional interests.\n\n\n\nIn 1851 Cameron, a Torontonian with many talents, yielded to the temptation of Toronto, and without realizing it, placed himself in a position where he could only remain in politics as the champion of regional causes. Kingston, which offered less social and financial opportunities than Toronto, provided Macdonald with a safe seat. As representative of his smaller and less demanding community, Macdonald was free to play the part of mediator between the French-Canadian Bleus and Upper Canadian Tories, which after 1851 was no longer open to Cameron.\n\n\n\nThe return of Cameron to provincial politics in 1854 as representative of Toronto coincided with the formation of the Conservative MacNab-Morin coalition. As a representative of Toronto and a Conservative of demonstrated ability, he had an obvious claim to a place in the government, but it was easy to find reasons for leaving him out. The coalition was committed to secularization of clergy reserves, a measure Cameron was committed to oppose. He would be acceptable to French-Canadians, but not to Hincksite Liberals in the coalition. These were sufficient reasons for leaving him out of the ministry as long as clergy reserves remained an issue.\n\n\n\nAs a consistent defender of Anglican interests, Cameron was, by 1854, the most representative of that line of Tories that began with Strachan\u2019s pupils and was continued by their sons. He consequently had little choice but to fight a rearguard action in defence of a lost cause that had been abandoned even by Sir Allan MacNab. Cameron did the best he could, arguing that secularization of clergy reserves would undermine the special position of the Catholic Church in Lower Canada. Although he aroused the anxieties of French-Canadian members of the government, the measure went through. Yet by his stand Cameron secured the best possible terms for the Anglican community.\n\n\n\nCameron was a moderate by temperament, more so than Macdonald who frequently became involved in sterile personal quarrels. When the reserves ceased to be an issue, there were no serious political differences between the two men. Yet Macdonald could not join a partnership with Cameron without the risk of becoming a junior partner. Cameron was thus left to employ his talents as an independent back bencher. Under these circumstances, he could hardly avoid becoming the champion of popular causes which in turn would lead to association with popular movements.\n\n\n\nProtestantism was the great popular cause in Toronto, championed both by Liberal George Brown and the largely Conservative Orange Lodges. Cameron had not yet become an Orangeman by 1854 and, as noted above, was regarded by Ogle Gowan as an agent of the Family Compact. Gowan was an Irish gentleman of precarious means and insecure social status, but a gifted demagogue and a tireless organizer. Cameron, who had entered politics from the top, could hardly appreciate his value. Macdonald, on the other hand, had to make his own way in politics. He therefore had bonds of sympathy with Gowan and carefully cultivated his friendship. On his return to politics, Cameron affronted Gowan by acquiring control of the British Colonist and providing it with a subsidy of $5,000 a year, thus supporting a Conservative journal critical of the ministry and in competition with Gowan\u2019s Patriot.\n\n\n\nIt was against this background that Cameron became a champion of Protestant rights by making a political issue out of the Corrigan affair. Robert Corrigan was an Irish Protestant who had been beaten by a group of Irish Roman Catholics at a cattle show in the small village of St. Sylvestre on 18 October 1855 and died the following day. The men accused of his murder were acquitted with the apparent approval of Judge Jean-Francois-Joseph Duval who presided at the trial. There was an outburst of indignation in the press and Cameron, assuming the role of public-spirited legal expert, introduced and carried a motion asking that Duval\u2019s charges to the jury be made available to the Provincial Assembly. This move was an obvious threat to the unity of a Cabinet composed of Upper Canadian Conservatives and French-Canadians. The government met the challenge by asking for and receiving a vote of confidence which was given by Cameron along with the others. It then persuaded Conservatives, including Cameron, to rescind the motion. Cameron emerged from this issue as the concerned but responsible defender of the Protestant minority in Lower Canada, exposing the devices of opportunist politicians. In so doing, he laid the foundation of his career as Orange Grand Master. At the same time, by alienating the French-Canadian ministers, he made it easier for Macdonald to keep him out of the government.\n\n\n\nShortly after this incident, Cameron was presented with what appeared to be an opportunity to challenge Macdonald\u2019s leadership of the Upper Canadian Conservatives. Sir Allan MacNab was considered to be a political handicap by many of the ministry. To force his resignation, Macdonald and the Upper Canadian ministers resigned on the pretext that they did not have a majority in Upper Canada. Left virtually alone, MacNab resigned, whereupon Macdonald and his colleagues resumed office.\n\n\n\nThis dubious manoeuvre won wide-spread sympathy for MacNab, and there had already been considerable speculation in the press about a new ministry which would include Cameron. It has been assumed by most recent historians that Cameron was prepared to challenge Macdonald\u2019s leadership at this time because it was the obvious thing to do. Yet Foster Griezic, after investigating the matter in detail, could find no evidence to support this assumption. Cameron apparently did not even interrupt his plans for a trip to England.\n\n\n\nIt is unlikely that an effort to challenge Macdonald\u2019s leadership would have succeeded, but it was not in Cameron\u2019s nature to make the attempt. He had been brought into politics by adoption and was not inclined to fight for power. He remained an influential and able man, but the following year his financial empire, which was one of the pillars of his influence, became a casualty of the financial collapse of 1857. Faced with heavy debts, he scorned bankruptcy and sought through his remaining property and law practice to meet the claims of his creditors.\n\n\n\nHe could no longer support the Colonist and could not contest his Toronto seat in the general election of 1857. When he announced his withdrawal from politics, an article in the Leader, which was associated with Gowan\u2019s Patriot, referred to Cameron as \u201cthe last rose of the past summer of Toryism - the solitary member of a once powerful party.\u201d Gowan, who probably wrote these lines, was referring to a brother Orangeman, as Cameron appears to have joined a Toronto Lodge in 1856.\n\n\n\nThis was not an unusual step for a Conservative to take. Some, like George Strange Boulton, had taken it as early as 1832, and John A. Macdonald became an Orangeman in 1844 at the time he became a candidate for the Provincial Assembly. At the outset of his career Cameron probably took the Orange vote for granted and assumed membership in the Lodge would be a handicap when seeking Catholic support. At the time of the Corrigan affair, which apparently was the occasion for his joining the Lodge in 1856, the Orange Order was divided. The schism began in 1853 when Ogle Gowan, the founder of the movement, deposed his successor, George Benjamin, by packing the Grand Lodge which was meeting in Kingston. Benjamin in turn founded a rival Grand Lodge which by 1855 was recognized by 180 out of a total of 712 Lodges. Benjamin soon renounced leadership of the schismatic Grand Lodge and was replaced briefly by G.W. Whitebend, and then by John Flanagan, a former mayor of Kingston and foe of John A. Macdonald.\n\n\n\nThe principal cause of the schism had been Gowan\u2019s adherence to Macdonald\u2019s policy of alliance with the French-Canadian \u201cBleus.\u201d Many adherents of the schismatic lodges, like John Holland of Toronto, openly supported George Brown, but Benjamin remained an anti-ministerial Conservative. Cameron joined Toronto Number 507 which supported the schismatic Grand Lodge, but used his influence to heal the schism. As a conciliatory gesture he presented a petition to the Legislature, drawn up by Gowan, for the incorporation of the Orange movement, which was opposed by Flanagan, the schismatic leader. The petition was unsuccessful, but the need for incorporation provided an incentive for re-unification.\n\n\n\nThe schism was finally healed in 1856 when George Lyttleton Allen, a Gowan supporter, became Grand Master. Mutual suspicion remained and Cameron, as the only eminent Orangeman not involved in the original schism, was a strong candidate for Grand Master. Yet when he was nominated by former supporters of the Benjaminite faction, his nomination was rejected on technical grounds. As Gowan\u2019s son, Nassau C. Gowan, explained: . it was soon discovered that he (Cameron) had not advanced to those degrees which constitute eligibility, and that some accident ensued to prevent a dispensation being made in his favour.\u201d Cameron, it seems, had not yet received the order of the Purple, which would have made him eligible for office. This degree was normally granted to Orangemen within two years of their original initiation. As Cameron had been initiated sometime in 1856, he had yet to receive the Purple.\n\n\n\nThis move, sponsored by former Benjaminites, to make Cameron Grand Master, explains the hesitant support Cameron received from the Patriot and the Leader during the Toronto by-election of 1858. George Brown, having been Premier for forty-eight hours, had to return to his constituents for re-election. Macdonald and the Cabinet ministers who had been out of office for forty-eight hours took advantage of a new rule which enabled ministers to change portfolios without standing for re-election. By shifting portfolios and shifting them back again in what was called the \u201cDouble Shuffle\u201d they were able to resume office without the need for re-election.\n\n\n\nThis device won sympathy for Brown and he would probably have been re-elected by acclamation had not Cameron acted as a loyal party man by agreeing to run against him. Cameron deserved administration support but the election began in late August, just six weeks after the Grand Lodge meeting when Cameron\u2019s bid for the Orange leadership had been blocked. Consequently the Patriot and the Leader, by attacking Brown and McGee, and offering Cameron sympathy, moved by way of benevolent neutrality to conditional support. Left without the support of his party, Cameron still made a good showing, polling 144 votes short of victory in an election in which over 5,000 voted. This suited Macdonald\u2019s purpose. It forced Brown to fight but left Cameron without a seat.\n\n\n\nCameron\u2019s defeat made him more acceptable as Orange Grand Master, but there was still resistance. He was elected Grand Master by a narrow margin of twelve votes at the Grand Lodge meeting held in Hamilton on 22 June 1859. Even Gowan had to accept the fact that he was the candidate who divided Orangemen least. The Patriot announced, \u201cNo gentleman in the body could bring a greater amount of influence and sterling ability to bear upon the councils of the Order.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Canadian Lodges needed an eminent Conservative, not too closely associated with ministerial politics, who could provide the kind of dignity and prestige which in Ireland was found by appointing a Peer as Grand Master. Ogle Gowan\u2019s perpetual involvement in political and personal disputes made it impossible for him to supply that need, and his successors, George Benjamin and George Lyttleton Allen, although more conciliatory, were minor political figures who brought no prestige to the office of Grand Master. Cameron regarded the office as yet another position of honour and influence, like becoming chairman of the board of directors of a college or a corporation. He intended to act as a mediator among Orangemen and to use his influence to keep the Lodges from creating tensions in the community.\n\n\n\nAlthough he was identified with Protestant rather than Conservative Party interests, Cameron had no intention of leading a Protestant crusade or making the Lodges a base for opposition to the ministry. He nevertheless felt the need to balance Gowan\u2019s influence in the movement. Yet, having neither the ability nor the inclination to meet Gowan on his own ground of factional politics, he sought to outmanoeuvre him by a re-organization of the Grand Lodges.\n\n\n\nIn any growing organization there is always a case for creating new sub-divisions, and Cameron merely adopted a plan which had been proposed for some time. Under the existing system there were several Provincial Grand Lodges, but the Upper Canadian Orangemen, who were the most numerous, met under the direct authority of the Grand Lodge of British North America. This had suited Gowan\u2019s needs as most of his influence was in Toronto, in the eastern counties of Upper Canada, and in the Maritimes.\n\n\n\nAfter assuming office as Grand Master, Cameron, in what seems to have been a coup, adjourned the June meeting of Grand Lodge in Hamilton, and re-opened it in August at Cobourg where Gowan could not be present and many of his supporters would have difficulty in attending. Here Cameron introduced the new system, the main feature of which was the creation of two Grand Lodges in Upper Canada: a Western Grand Lodge which included Toronto, and a central Grand Lodge, which would provide for the rest of the province. Lower Canada was placed under an Eastern Grand Lodge. All the provincial Grand Lodges would be under the Grand Lodge of British North America over which Cameron presided. This system forced Gowan, who was in Toronto, to confine most of his efforts to the Western Grand Lodge, and made it difficult for him to make effective use of his influence east of Toronto.\n\n\n\nEvidence of Gowan\u2019s first reaction to this new order appears in an article in the Omsmee Warder, which was quoted with approval in the Patriot. The new system was described as \u201c. . . a ridiculous, uncalled-for piece of useless and expensive machinery - a death blow to the welfare of the Order.\u201d For the next five years Gowan continued to fight the new system, passing resolutions against it in the Western Grand Lodge, but he made no effort to challenge Cameron\u2019s position as Grand Master. Policy might be changed but Cameron was not only Grand Master: at the time of the re-organization of the Lodges, he was also acting as counsel for the ministry, defending them in court against charges that the \u2018\u2018Double Shuffle\u201d was unconstitutional. Gowan dedicated his \u2018\u2018History and Mystery of Orangeism,\u201d which came out in 1859, to Cameron, and when Cameron was named Grand Master a second time in June 1860, the Patriot announced that differences among Orangemen had ceased to exist since Cameron had become Grand Master. Nevertheless it expressed the hope that \u2018\u2018Mr. Cameron has weighed all possible consequences\u201d and reminded him that because half of the province was Catholic, no Grand Master could become a Cabinet minister.\n\n\n\nIn this manner Cameron was warned that although his success as a mediator among Orangemen was recognized, he was not welcome in the Conservative ministry. His value to the ministry was soon demonstrated in the late summer of 1860 when a crisis involving Orangemen arose out of the visit of the Prince of Wales. The Grand Lodge anticipated trouble. As Orange processions had been banned in Ireland, it was evident that the Duke of Newcastle, who in his capacity as Colonel Secretary accompanied the Prince on his visit, would be embarrassed by contact with the Orangemen.\n\n\n\nCameron, as a lawyer, understood that as a society legal in Canada the Orangemen had a right to display their loyalty and their numbers. As a politician, he felt that it should not be exercised. There was a precedent for such restraint. Irish Orangemen had refrained from any display of insignia during the visit of George IV to Dublin in 1821.\n\n\n\nThe first difficulty Cameron faced involved the presentation of a Loyal Address by Orangemen to the royal party. As the Governor-General, Sir Edmund Head, had accepted such an address in 1857, Cameron wrote to him on the subject and was told that the presentation of an Orange address would be embarrassing to Newcastle. The Grand Master informed the county Masters and no Orange addresses were prepared. There was no discussion, however, of the display of Orange Insignia, but the Orangemen between Quebec City and Kingston assumed correctly that a display of any kind would be unwelcome.\n\n\n\nThe Kingston Orangemen, under the influence of the former schismatic Grand Master John Flanagan, decided to make a distinction between presentation of addresses and a display of Orange insignia. Kingston Orangemen were ordered to turn out in full regalia and their example was followed in Belleville and Toronto. Cameron, following protocol, made no public effort to restrain this move, but he wrote to Newcastle and received no immediate reply. Nothing was heard from the royal party until Newcastle wrote to the mayor of Toronto on 30 August making it clear that Orange displays would be unacceptable. Cameron then advised Kingston Orangemen to comply with Newcastle\u2019s wishes. Meanwhile, Flanagan had assembled the Orangemen in full regalia and emphasized the anti-Catholic aspects of Orangeism by including in their display portraits of Garibaldi who was then invading the Papal States. Although the royal party was already aware of this, it received a delegation of Catholics who explained what the Orangemen were doing. This made it easier for Flanagan to encourage defiance as he could claim that Newcastle was coming under Catholic influence.\n\n\n\nNegotiations broke down and the royal party did not land at Kingston. John A. Macdonald, however, thought it best to conciliate his Orange supporters. He remained behind at Kingston and wisely did not rejoin the royal party until it reached Hamilton. Thus Cameron was left to manage the Orangemen as best he could. Belleville Orangemen were inclined to defer to Newcastle, but the arrival of Flanagan and a party of Kingston Orangemen induced them to assume an attitude of defiance and the Prince moved on without landing.\n\n\n\nThere were no difficulties at Cobourg but Toronto was the real test of Cameron\u2019s influence as failure to visit the metropolis would endanger the success of the royal tour. A public meeting was called at Clarence Square, attended by a thousand Orangemen, including Flanagan, who had arrived with a party from Kingston. Here Cameron and Gowan asserted the right of Orangemen to greet their Prince in their own way, but the Grand Master declared that he would resign if they prevented the royal party from landing. He then led the Orangemen in full regalia under various Orange arches which had been erected, but the procession ended several hours before the landing of the royal party. That evening, Mrs. Cameron was escorted by the Prince to the head table at a banquet organized by the Law Society of Toronto.\n\n\n\nCameron had been unable to save Macdonald from personal disaster at Kingston, but he had ensured the success of the royal tour, and left the impression that the Orangemen had acted with admirable restraint in the face of provocation. As the injured party, the Orangemen received a great deal of sympathy and the opposition was prepared to exploit this for the purpose of embarrassing the ministry.\n\n\n\nAgainst this background, the Lodges, with Cameron\u2019s support, were able to collect 100,000 signatures protesting against the treatment the Orangemen had received. These were taken by Cameron to England and presented to the Queen in the presence of the Duke of Newcastle. This personal triumph for Cameron, which enormously increased the prestige of the Lodges, set the stage for his return to provincial politics in the election of 1861. He could have easily been returned for Toronto, but agreed to stand for Peel County, where he faced James Aikins, an Orangeman from an Orange family who was also a local man. Aikins was a strong contender but might be defeated by a popular Grand Master, providing the Grand Master was an unequivocal champion of regional interest.\n\n\n\nCameron had accepted representation by population, or \u201crep. by pop.\u2019\u2019 in the early 1850\u2019s, but was content to let George Brown remain as the leading champion of that dangerous cause. In Peel County in 1861, it was impossible to win the election without taking a strong and clear stand on the question. Cameron did so, yet won by only a narrow margin, 1,633 to 1,145.\n\n\n\nMacdonald by this time was prepared to make \u201crep. by pop.\u201d an open question, permitting Cabinet ministers to vote for it and remain in his government. This policy enabled Conservatives, particularly those west of Toronto, to face their constituents while remaining champions of regional interests. Macdonald still had difficulties in finding Conservatives willing to serve in his Cabinet. Cameron, however, placed his influence at Macdonald\u2019s disposal, which proved useful in negotiations with T.C. Street, a Niagara millionaire who supported \u201crep. by pop.\u201d Most contemporaries still saw Cameron as a rival of Macdonald for the Conservative leadership, and Macdonald himself shared this view. Cameron may have received an offer to enter the government at this time and probably discussed the question with leading Conservatives. Yet Cameron was not the man to press his claims. He might accept, if strongly urged by Macdonald to serve, but Macdonald could not take the risk.\n\n\n\nCameron\u2019s prominence as Orange Grand Master and his continuing ties with the Compact families were more evident than his precarious financial position. Yet whatever his real influence, by his presence in the Cabinet, he would appear to be displacing Macdonald. Moreover, Cameron was still too strong to be managed by Macdonald, and would be dangerous even as a junior partner.\n\n\n\nConsequently, Cameron remained a back bencher and at the opening session demonstrated his capacity for embarrassing the government as he had at the time of the Corrigan affair. \u201cRep. by pop.\u201d was no longer a question of confidence, but the survival of the government depended on the measure being defeated by a combination of French-Canadians, Upper Canadians from the eastern region of the province, and Conservatives with safe seats.\n\n\n\nWhen William McDougall, a radical Grit, raised the question by introducing a \u201crep. by pop.\u201d motion as an amendment to the address, Cameron introduced a similar but milder amendment. The amendments were defeated by the usual combinations but there was a majority for the measure in Upper Canada. This was damaging to Macdonald\u2019s prestige and Cameron had done most of the damage. The Orange Grand Master might protest that he could be satisfied with a mere token change in representation, but \u201crep. by pop.\u201d had become a symbol of anti-French-Canadian sentiment in Upper Canada and was consequently unacceptable in any form to French-Canadian Conservatives. With the failure of Brown to secure a seat in the election of 1861, Cameron was by far the most prestigious advocate of \u201crep. by pop.\u201d and consequently the leading representative of regional interests.\n\n\n\nIn 1862 he created difficulties for Macdonald during the debate of the Militia Bill which ended in the defeat of the government. Cameron declared he would support the Bill if the Attorney-General West (Macdonald) would \u201ccome down boldly for a definite number of men . . . and that the ways and means of meeting the expense should be stated.\u201d If the government \u201ccould not carry their point,\u201d Cameron insisted, \u201cthey should leave it to the opposition.\u201d\n\n\n\nCameron was not happy about his role as an independent Conservative, which offered no opportunities for constructive statesmanship, but he had little reason to envy Macdonald whose main preoccupation had to be staying in power. With the fall of the ministry Macdonald, once more in the opposition, no longer saw Cameron as a threat. A formal rapprochement between the two men was announced at a dinner held in February 1863. When Macdonald returned to power Cameron remained a back bencher but found a means of serving the ministry by blunting the edge of the regionalism he represented. This was noticeable in the case of Scott School Bill, which was designed to improve the position of Roman Catholic separate schools. Consistent with his earlier attitude he offered to support the Bill, if rights were extended to Anglican separate schools. When this was refused, he voted against the Bill, which was passed by a government majority. By finally voting against the Bill, Cameron was still able to maintain his influence over the Orangemen.\n\n\n\nCameron\u2019s influence was put to the test when the Scott Bill was discussed in the Grand Lodge, and in Peel County ten Orangemen who opposed his re-election were expelled from the movement. By making full and at times heavy-handed use of his prestige as Grand Master, he secured most of the Orange votes for the Conservatives in the election of 1864 when he himself was returned by a slim majority in Peel County.\n\n\n\nBy 1864 Macdonald had concluded that Cameron\u2019s fortunes had declined to a point where he was no longer a rival and he understood the advantage of acquiring the services of a talented and loyal ally. Cameron was offered a place in the Cabinet, but refused on the grounds that the post in which his talents could possibly be employed was attorney-general, a position held by Macdonald, which he could not give up.\n\n\n\nPerhaps it was pride which induced Cameron to refuse a belated offer of a junior partnership in the Cabinet with Macdonald. Moreover, his financial affairs remained precarious as he fought a losing battle to pay his debts. He had borrowed money from funds under control of the Anglican Church and was charged by the Globe with doing so on insufficient security. The charge could not be proven, but his reputation suffered.\n\n\n\nHaving given up his chances of becoming a Father of Confederation by refusing to enter the Cabinet, Cameron still supported Confederation. Yet he preserved his character as an independent but conscientious back bencher by stating his preference for a legislative union, and expressing the opinion that the people should be given a chance to vote on the question. The last suggestion was not helpful but seems to be designed to divide Confederation supporters at the eleventh hour and create new obstacles for the ministry.\n\n\n\nDuring the excitement created by the Fenians, Cameron adopted a tone of dignified indignation at Fenian audacity, and at the same time expressed doubts about Fenian strength and determination. These efforts may have discouraged the more belligerent Orangemen from using Fenianism as a pretext for provoking quarrels with the Catholic community. Yet Cameron had little understanding of Irish quarrels, and on the one occasion - March 17, 1866 - when there was serious danger of a clash between Orangemen and Fenian sympathizers, the burden of controlling the Orangemen was assumed by Ogle Gowan.\n\n\n\nAfter the raid he agreed to undertake prosecution of captured Fenians. As Orange Grand Master, Cameron was not the obvious person to undertake this task, but the purpose of the trials was to appease Canadian indignation while avoiding future entanglement by convicting as few Fenians as possible. In the end all the convicted Fenians were pardoned and there were no executions. In these show trials Cameron played his part admirably, thus enhancing his status as Orange Grand Master.\n\n\n\nAfter this it was appropriate for Cameron to accept an offer to undertake the defense of Patrick Whelan, the man accused of the assassination of D\u2019Arcy McGee. In what was clearly going to be the most spectacular trial in Canadian history, Cameron played his part well. He demolished the testimony of Crown witnesses who sought to prove direct evidence of Whelan\u2019s connection with the crime. Whelan was convicted on circumstantial evidence, but before his execution he admitted that he had been present at the assassination and was thus accessory to the fact.\n\n\n\nCameron may have lost a few votes among Peel County Orangemen as a result of his efforts on behalf of Whelan, but he was able to demonstrate his enthusiasm for Orangemen by attending the meeting of the Imperial Grand Lodge in Belfast in the summer of 1866. His delayed return from this meeting, the first convention of Orangemen throughout the Empire, threw the main burden of his election to the post-Confederation Parliament on John A. Macdonald, who worked loyally in his cause and secured Cameron\u2019s return.\n\n\n\nBy 1868 Cameron was clearly a useful agent of Macdonald\u2019s. He could remain in the public eye but the decline in his influence was obvious. He sought but failed to secure the speakership in the first Dominion Parliament. By 1870 he was replaced as Orange Grand Master by Mackenzie Bowell, a lesser but younger man. Bo well was a protege of George Benjamin whose politics differed little from Cameron\u2019s. Cameron had brought prestige to the Order when prestige was needed. He had assumed office as a mediator free of association with past controversies. By 1870 his prestige was failing, and the price he paid for serving Macdonald within the Lodges made him a controversial figure. Yet the Lodges would never again find the Grand Master of Cameron\u2019s status. Though Mackenzie Bowell became Prime Minister, he was far from being an impressive personality.\n\n\n\nCameron continued to take an active part in politics during the remaining six years of his life. In 1872 he lost his seat in Peel County but was provided with a safe seat in Cardwell which he held until his death. In 1873 he was accused by Edward Blake of being a tool of the ministry, and there was substance to this accusation. Cameron was appointed chairman of the committee investigating the contribution of Hugh Allan, the railway magnate, to Conservative election funds. Cameron himself had benefitted from these donations, receiving $4,000 from Allan through Macdonald. By delaying the investigation until the end of the Parliamentary session,50 he aided Macdonald considerably.\n\n\n\nExhausted by the efforts to meet his financial obligations and by the humiliations he had to accept in order to remain in politics, Cameron died 17 November 1876, still $200,000 in debt. It was not a happy ending to what had been a useful and, on the whole, a successful career. Cameron had suffered personal tragedy in 1844 when his first wife had died in childbirth, but his second marriage in 1849 restored balance to his life. His financial disaster in 1857 was a serious, but not fatal, blow to his political career.\n\n\n\nThe tragedy in Cameron\u2019s life was that he possessed potentialities as a statesman which were never realized. One of the reasons for Cameron\u2019s relative failure in politics was that he did not have to fight during the early part of his career and learned to fight too late. He was adopted first by the Compact families, then by Draper, and in a sense, by the Orange Lodges. In each case his self-evident ability and respectability were sufficient recommendations. Macdonald, on the other hand, had had to fight his way up from local politics with little help from those in positions of power and influence.\n\n\n\nMacdonald\u2019s abilities were more difficult to recognize because they were less conventional. In 1854 Macdonald commented that Cameron lacked general intelligence and was deficient in political reading. What he perhaps sensed in Cameron was a lack of imagination and want of interest in general ideas. Macdonald was not a man to be mastered by dreams, but had an awareness of larger schemes, like Confederation, keeping them in reserve in the hope that they might prove useful.\n\n\n\nCameron was the master of technicalities of the law and of those moral technicalities which Macdonald ignored, but which were useful in acquiring and sustaining a reputation for integrity. Devices such as the \u201cDouble Shuffle\u201d aroused distrust, and distrust is a serious handicap in politics. Cameron, on his part, could convincingly assume that attitude of a public-spirited man acting according to conscience, even when he was taking unfair advantage of an adversary or an ally. At the time of the Corrigan affair and the \u201crep. by pop.\u201d debate of 1862, he struck hard with a well-timed blow at the most sensitive point in the ministerial armour, and gained popularity at the government\u2019s expense. Moreover, in out-manoeuvring Gowan at the Cobourg meeting of the Grand Lodge in 1859, Cameron demonstrated a dexterity which would have done credit to the author of the \u201cDouble Shuffle.\u201d It is difficult to see Cameron as a man defeated by his own moral superiority.\n\n\n\nIf Macdonald had departed from politics anytime between 1854 and 1862, Cameron\u2019s gifts for conciliation and the confidence he inspired would probably have given him the Conservative leadership. His want of concern for general ideas would have been a handicap but not a fatal one. Though Cameron was different in personality and background from Macdonald and could not work in the same way, he was, nevertheless, an ambitious and gifted Scot capable of taking Macdonald\u2019s place. Macdonald understood this. He also realized that there was no room for two captains on the Conservative quarterdeck. And Macdonald was right.\n\n\n\nJohn Hillyard Cameron, standing as he does on the borderline of history, may never have a full-length biography. Donald Swainton\u2019s article in volume ten of the Dictionary of Canadian Biography provides a concise account of his life with details on the financial aspects of his career. Foster Griezic\u2019s M.A. thesis (Carleton University 1965) and his article \"John Hillyard Cameron and the Question of the Conservative Leadership,\u201d (Ontario History, December 1974) provide thoroughly researched and well argued accounts of his career, which present a different view of Cameron than Swainton\u2019s. Yet Griezic\u2019s interpretation of Cameron as the gentleman in politics defeated by his virtue is debatable and the account given by both authors of Cameron\u2019s role as an Orangeman needs elaboration. W.P. Bull\u2019s From Boyne to Brampton (Toronto 1936) presents material on Cameron\u2019s role in Peel County. Original material can be found on Cameron in the papers of nearly all contemporary politicians, principally the John A. Macdonald papers in the Public Archives of Canada and the T.C. Street papers in the Ontario Archives. There are also some Cameron papers in the Public Reference Library of Toronto, and there is an abundance of material in contemporary Toronto newspapers. Fragments of his role as an Orangeman can be found in the T.R. Ferguson Papers at the P.A.C. and in Loyal Orange Association Annual Proceedings during the 1860\u2019s."}, {"url": "http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/cameron_john_1827_1910_13E.html", "page_content": "CAMERON, JOHN, Roman Catholic priest and bishop; b. 16 Feb. 1827 in St Andrews, N.S., son of Red John Cameron (Iain Ruaidh) and Christena (Christina) MacDonald; d. 6 April 1910 in Antigonish, N.S.\n\nJohn Cameron\u2019s father left Scotland with three brothers early in the 19th century and went to Southside Antigonish Harbour, N.S., where they were befriended by Lauchlin MacDonald, an earlier immigrant. Although Clan Cameron had been Presbyterian since the Reformation, Red John converted to Catholicism upon his marriage to one of MacDonald\u2019s daughters.\n\nThe youngest of eight children, John shared the chores of the family farm and early absorbed the sense of duty that would characterize his religious career. He attended the village school until he was 11 and then enrolled in the first class of St Andrew\u2019s Grammar School, which had been established by the parish priest, the Reverend Colin Francis MacKinnon*. From the beginning he showed an aptitude for academic work, and his teachers gave him every encouragement. On MacKinnon\u2019s advice, at the age of 17 he left Nova Scotia to begin theological studies at the Urban College in Rome.\n\nAdjusting easily to seminary life, Cameron showed in his letters home a maturity hardly to be expected in a youth from rural Nova Scotia. The didactic tone of his correspondence suggests that he already felt a responsibility to teach and explain. After eight months he told his father that he had a \u201cfair knowledge of the Italian, can read, write, speak and understand it.\u201d The violence the young seminarian witnessed when Rome was racked by revolution and war in 1848 and 1849 made him a lifelong enemy to the foes of established authority. He would constantly defend the supremacy of the pope and later sympathize with the views of the ultramontanes.\n\nCameron was ordained to the priesthood on 26 July 1853, and he remained in Rome for a further ten months in order to receive his doctorates in theology and philosophy. During this time he was secretary to Alessandro Cardinal Barnabo, secretary to the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda, an appointment which suggests that he was held in high regard. In this position he made many acquaintances within the hierarchy of the church and familiarized himself with its bureaucracy. In 1853 he assisted the vice-rector of the Urban College. After leaving Rome in May 1854, Cameron spent three more months in Europe at the request of MacKinnon, now bishop of Arichat, in order to recruit priests and nuns for the diocese. He arrived home on 10 September. To the sobriety and prudence characteristic of his Presbyterian ancestors had been joined an obedience to the dictates of Rome and an unbending rigidity in matters of Roman Catholic doctrine.\n\nThe month he returned Cameron was appointed rector and professor at the academy in Arichat, established in 1853 by MacKinnon in order to educate young men for the priesthood and give Scottish Catholics an opportunity for professional careers. MacKinnon had, however, always intended to start a college in Antigonish, the centre for a large congregation of Scottish Catholics, and most of the faculty and staff of the academy moved there when a building was made available in 1855. Cameron served as rector of the new college, which was named St Francis Xavier, until 1858; he also taught theology and was pastor of the sprawling parish of St Ninian\u2019s. Having mastered several languages and gained doctorates he was considered scholarly; because he followed a temperate life-style he won respect for his diligence and dedication.\n\nAlthough Antigonish was MacKinnon\u2019s residence from 1858, the seat of the diocese remained in Arichat. Cameron was transferred to Arichat in July 1863 because of a dispute there involving the resident pastor and some parishioners and probably because of a disagreement over politics with MacKinnon. He was appointed rector of Notre-Dame de l\u2019Assomption Cathedral and also became vicar general of the diocese, a position he would hold for seven years. His reputation as a religious administrator soon became firmly established. Later in the decade, when MacKinnon\u2019s failing health made him less capable of dealing with the business of the diocese, some priests sought Cameron\u2019s advice on administrative affairs. Cameron was much concerned during the 1870s about the slow growth of St Francis Xavier but could do little to effect change from Arichat. His administrative abilities had, however, been recognized in March 1870, when thanks to MacKinnon\u2019s recommendation he was appointed coadjutor with the right of succession. In addition, he served again as vicar general between 1873 and 1877. Rome too had a regard for Cameron\u2019s competence: in 1871 he was asked to settle a jurisdictional dispute at Harbour Grace, Nfld. During the 1880s he would be used as an apostolic delegate by the papal authorities during a nasty imbroglio involving the archbishop of Halifax and the Sisters of Charity [see Mary Ann Maguire, named Sister Mary Francis], and in a diocesan dispute at Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Que. [see Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Lafl\u00e8che*].\n\nCameron reached the major milestone in his career on 17 July 1877, when he succeeded MacKinnon as bishop of Arichat. Both had long intended to make Antigonish the seat of the diocese, and Cameron moved there in 1880. On 23 Aug. 1886 the name of the diocese was changed from Arichat to Antigonish; the large stone church in Antigonish, completed in 1874, became its cathedral. The 1880s was a decade of major accomplishments, notably in administration. The debt incurred in the building of the cathedral was paid and a new wing was added to the college; in addition, an episcopal residence was constructed and the Congregation of Notre-Dame was brought to Antigonish.\n\nAt the same time Cameron gave new vigour to St Francis Xavier, which had become a university in 1866. He imposed levies on each parish in support of the college after its government grant was withdrawn in 1881, and for the remainder of his life he strove constantly to improve the institution by constructing buildings, strengthening the faculty, promoting new programs in the humanities, commerce, and science, and introducing the ma and b.litt. degrees. Much of his attention was directed to it, and he has rightly been called the college\u2019s \u201csecond founder.\u201d Cameron\u2019s educational philosophy may be summarized by the phrase \u201ceducating the whole man,\u201d a popular slogan among Catholic educators of his day. As part of this approach, he sent bright theology students to seminaries in Rome, Quebec, or Montreal for advanced training in theology and other disciplines; those chosen returned home fluent in two or more languages.\n\nCameron was a firm believer in the importance of a better general education for women. Writing in 1895 to Lady Aberdeen [Marjoribanks*], he stated that \u201cthose who limit women\u2019s mission and sphere of action to the nursery misinterpret the word of God.\u201d In 1883 he had had the Congregation of Notre-Dame establish a convent school for girls in Antigonish. The school, renamed Mount St Bernard, later became a women\u2019s college, and it was affiliated with St Francis Xavier in 1894. In 1897 four of its students were awarded bas by St Francis Xavier, the first Catholic university in North America to offer to women courses which led to a degree.\n\nThe bishop was also more progressive than the majority of his Maritime colleagues in providing French-speaking priests for the Acadians of his diocese. Moreover, he sought to assist ethnic groups to preserve their languages and cultures by prescribing catechisms in French and Micmac and by helping to compile a catechism in Gaelic. In this endeavour he was probably the most active Catholic prelate in 19th-century Nova Scotia.\n\nOn matters which affected the faith and morals of his people, Cameron was inflexible. Periodically he directed his attention to the cause of temperance, issuing pastoral letters and urging his priests to speak out against the abuse of alcoholic beverages. The increasing popularity in the 1890s of round dances distressed the bishop because he disapproved of \u201cthe improper intimacies between young people\u201d which resulted. Like many Christian clerics of his day, Cameron believed that people had constantly to guard against committing sins of the flesh. In seeking to warn his flock of the dangers of sexual intimacy outside marriage he issued pastoral letters which left little room for misinterpretation. The bishop also insisted on the observance of church regulations for ritual, rubrics, and dogma, and the diocese was constantly made aware of edicts from Rome which affected the laws of the church.\n\nAlthough Cameron gave the appearance of ruling a theocratic kingdom, he did not normally abuse his episcopal power. He did, however, overstep himself in his involvement in politics. His first venture was in 1877, when John Sparrow David Thompson*, a Halifax lawyer and a convert to Catholicism, was suggested as a possible Conservative candidate for a provincial by-election in Antigonish County. The bishop had at one time supported the Liberals, but he believed that well-educated Catholics should take a greater role in public life, and Thompson had impressed him. He let it be known that he favoured Thompson, who won handily.\n\nThe result did not leave Cameron unscathed: he was attacked by Liberal politicians and newspapers for interfering in the political process. The criticism was repeated when he supported Thompson in provincial and federal elections up to 1891, several of which Thompson would not have won without his help. Although it was not thought unusual at the time for churchmen to be involved in politics, Cameron made himself more vulnerable to criticism than other Maritime prelates because of the direct and authoritarian manner in which he aired his views. Moreover, in backing Thompson he became involved in the grubby side of elections and enmeshed in a web of patronage.\n\nThe attacks on Cameron\u2019s interference in politics were harshest during the federal election campaign of 1896, when the Manitoba school question was a major topic of debate [see Thomas Greenway]. Cameron was the only Maritime bishop to advocate strongly and publicly the restoration of Catholic rights in Manitoba. Arguing that the school question was a religious matter, he ordered that a pastoral letter be read in all parishes just prior to the election. In it he stated that Catholics had to support their coreligionists in Manitoba and vote for the remedial legislation of the Conservatives. A majority of Catholics in the riding of Antigonish did not agree and helped elect a Liberal. The feeling against the letter in Heatherton, ten miles east of Antigonish, was so strong that when it was being read at least 40 parishioners walked out of the church. Incensed, the bishop accused the protesters of having insulted the priest by leaving; they countered that they were being coerced into voting for the Conservatives. Cameron denied the protesters the right to the sacraments until they apologized for causing scandal, and it was not until 1900, after the intervention of the apostolic delegate, that the dispute was resolved. The election also tarnished Cameron\u2019s image in Rome. Until then he had been held in great respect by the church authorities, but his involvement in the campaign led them to reprimand him.\n\nThe bishop\u2019s administrative skills were sorely tested after 1900, when new parishes had to be created almost overnight because of rapid industrialization in Cape Breton. Although he succeeded in meeting the challenge, he did not fully understand the changing social conditions wrought by the sudden influx of different racial and ethnic groups into his diocese. Nor did he completely comprehend the problems caused by industrialization and urbanization, having no experience of either development. Little is known about Cameron\u2019s views of the labour movement and trade unions, but the church as a whole reacted in a conservative manner to the rise of trade unionism in Cape Breton.\n\nBy the year of his death Cameron had achieved great successes. He had paid off a large diocesan debt incurred over the years and had had religious orders establish convents, hospitals, schools, and a home for the aged. He had also been mainly responsible for the creation of the Sisters of St Martha of Antigonish, founded in 1894 to perform domestic duties at St Francis Xavier (the order later moved into educational, hospital, and social work). Twenty-six new parishes had been formed, half in industrial Cape Breton. There were 93 priests, more than half of whom had been ordained by Cameron, and ten monks in a Trappist monastery at Tracadie. Moreover, the great majority of the priests had studied at St Francis Xavier, which had become the leading Catholic university in the Maritimes. By 1910 its staff consisted of nine priests and thirteen laymen, who offered a solid education as a basis for professional studies.\n\nJohn Cameron\u2019s long-lasting influence with Thompson and other politicians such as Sir Charles Tupper* and the respect in which he was held by his ecclesiastical peers give him a claim to a position of national importance. But although he was an outstanding churchman and achieved much as an administrator and educator, his political partisanship diminished his lustre.\n\nR. A.

Mcfarland, 1979\n\n1788\u201314 or 15 June 1838\n\nJohn Adams Cameron, lawyer, banker, editor, consul, and judge, was born in Mecklenburg County, Va., son of John Cameron (1744\u20131815), a native of Scotland and Presbyterian minister, and Anne Owen Nash (d. 1825), a niece of Abner Nash, governor of North Carolina in 1780\u201381. John Adams Cameron moved to North Carolina with his older brother, Duncan, when he was about ten. He received his bachelor's degree from The University of North Carolina in 1806 and his master's there in 1809. He then studied law and began to practice in Fayetteville, which he represented in the lower house of the General Assembly in 1810, 1811, 1812, and 1820. In 1820 and 1821 he was grand master of North Carolina Masons.\n\nDuring the War of 1812, Cameron organized a troop in Fayetteville and held the rank of major. His military duties did not occupy him fully, however, because in 1812 he was the unsuccessful Federalist candidate for Congress against Republican John Culpepper. In 1815 he petitioned the assembly for the office of comptroller of the state, claiming that his capacity to practice law had been lost in the service of his country. He married Eliza Adam in January of 1815, but she did not live long; in October of 1818 the newspapers reported his marriage to Catherine Halliday, widow.\n\nFederalists in 1817 obtained for Cameron the job of president of the Fayetteville branch of the U.S. Bank. Republicans in the assembly opposed the bank and placed a tax on it, which Cameron refused to pay when the U.S. Supreme Court denied the right of states to tax instrumentalities of the national government (McCulloch v. Maryland, 1819). In 1820, Cameron was again in the House of Commons from Fayetteville and active in the movement to revise the state constitution. In 1823 he was a delegate to the Internal Improvements Convention in Raleigh; by this time he was beginning to move away from his old Federalist ties.\n\nIn 1825 it was announced that Cameron would become the editor of the Fayetteville North Carolina Journal, which under his leadership became an abrasive champion of the cause of Andrew Jackson. In 1827 the editor was candidate, against his old opponent Culpepper, for the Fayetteville seat in Congress. Their political roles were reversed, but Culpepper was again successful. In 1829, Culpepper having retired, Cameron campaigned again as the Jackson candidate, this time against National Republican Edmund Deberry. Deberry, who accused Cameron of being overbearing and of having squandered two fortunes, won by slightly more than two hundred votes.\n\nDefeated politically and in need financially, Cameron had to sell the Journal in 1830. Shortly thereafter, President Jackson gave him an appointment as consul to Vera Cruz, but the revolutionary state of Mexico and the low pay of State Department employees at that period soon reduced Cameron's financial circumstances even further. He again contacted his influential friends in Congress to find him a better job. This time he received an appointment as judge of the Western District Court of Florida, and in 1832 he moved to Pensacola. Six years later he boarded the new steamship Pulaski at Savannah for a trip north. Near midnight on 14 June 1838, the starboard boiler of the ship exploded. There were almost one hundred victims, and Cameron's body was never found."}, {"url": "http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/cameron_john_1827_1910_13E.html", "page_content": "CAMERON, JOHN, Roman Catholic priest and bishop; b. 16 Feb. 1827 in St Andrews, N.S., son of Red John Cameron (Iain Ruaidh) and Christena (Christina) MacDonald; d. 6 April 1910 in Antigonish, N.S.\n\nJohn Cameron\u2019s father left Scotland with three brothers early in the 19th century and went to Southside Antigonish Harbour, N.S., where they were befriended by Lauchlin MacDonald, an earlier immigrant. Although Clan Cameron had been Presbyterian since the Reformation, Red John converted to Catholicism upon his marriage to one of MacDonald\u2019s daughters.\n\nThe youngest of eight children, John shared the chores of the family farm and early absorbed the sense of duty that would characterize his religious career. He attended the village school until he was 11 and then enrolled in the first class of St Andrew\u2019s Grammar School, which had been established by the parish priest, the Reverend Colin Francis MacKinnon*. From the beginning he showed an aptitude for academic work, and his teachers gave him every encouragement. On MacKinnon\u2019s advice, at the age of 17 he left Nova Scotia to begin theological studies at the Urban College in Rome.\n\nAdjusting easily to seminary life, Cameron showed in his letters home a maturity hardly to be expected in a youth from rural Nova Scotia. The didactic tone of his correspondence suggests that he already felt a responsibility to teach and explain. After eight months he told his father that he had a \u201cfair knowledge of the Italian, can read, write, speak and understand it.\u201d The violence the young seminarian witnessed when Rome was racked by revolution and war in 1848 and 1849 made him a lifelong enemy to the foes of established authority. He would constantly defend the supremacy of the pope and later sympathize with the views of the ultramontanes.\n\nCameron was ordained to the priesthood on 26 July 1853, and he remained in Rome for a further ten months in order to receive his doctorates in theology and philosophy. During this time he was secretary to Alessandro Cardinal Barnabo, secretary to the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda, an appointment which suggests that he was held in high regard. In this position he made many acquaintances within the hierarchy of the church and familiarized himself with its bureaucracy. In 1853 he assisted the vice-rector of the Urban College. After leaving Rome in May 1854, Cameron spent three more months in Europe at the request of MacKinnon, now bishop of Arichat, in order to recruit priests and nuns for the diocese. He arrived home on 10 September. To the sobriety and prudence characteristic of his Presbyterian ancestors had been joined an obedience to the dictates of Rome and an unbending rigidity in matters of Roman Catholic doctrine.\n\nThe month he returned Cameron was appointed rector and professor at the academy in Arichat, established in 1853 by MacKinnon in order to educate young men for the priesthood and give Scottish Catholics an opportunity for professional careers. MacKinnon had, however, always intended to start a college in Antigonish, the centre for a large congregation of Scottish Catholics, and most of the faculty and staff of the academy moved there when a building was made available in 1855. Cameron served as rector of the new college, which was named St Francis Xavier, until 1858; he also taught theology and was pastor of the sprawling parish of St Ninian\u2019s. Having mastered several languages and gained doctorates he was considered scholarly; because he followed a temperate life-style he won respect for his diligence and dedication.\n\nAlthough Antigonish was MacKinnon\u2019s residence from 1858, the seat of the diocese remained in Arichat. Cameron was transferred to Arichat in July 1863 because of a dispute there involving the resident pastor and some parishioners and probably because of a disagreement over politics with MacKinnon. He was appointed rector of Notre-Dame de l\u2019Assomption Cathedral and also became vicar general of the diocese, a position he would hold for seven years. His reputation as a religious administrator soon became firmly established. Later in the decade, when MacKinnon\u2019s failing health made him less capable of dealing with the business of the diocese, some priests sought Cameron\u2019s advice on administrative affairs. Cameron was much concerned during the 1870s about the slow growth of St Francis Xavier but could do little to effect change from Arichat. His administrative abilities had, however, been recognized in March 1870, when thanks to MacKinnon\u2019s recommendation he was appointed coadjutor with the right of succession. In addition, he served again as vicar general between 1873 and 1877. Rome too had a regard for Cameron\u2019s competence: in 1871 he was asked to settle a jurisdictional dispute at Harbour Grace, Nfld. During the 1880s he would be used as an apostolic delegate by the papal authorities during a nasty imbroglio involving the archbishop of Halifax and the Sisters of Charity [see Mary Ann Maguire, named Sister Mary Francis], and in a diocesan dispute at Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Que. [see Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Lafl\u00e8che*].\n\nCameron reached the major milestone in his career on 17 July 1877, when he succeeded MacKinnon as bishop of Arichat. Both had long intended to make Antigonish the seat of the diocese, and Cameron moved there in 1880. On 23 Aug. 1886 the name of the diocese was changed from Arichat to Antigonish; the large stone church in Antigonish, completed in 1874, became its cathedral. The 1880s was a decade of major accomplishments, notably in administration. The debt incurred in the building of the cathedral was paid and a new wing was added to the college; in addition, an episcopal residence was constructed and the Congregation of Notre-Dame was brought to Antigonish.\n\nAt the same time Cameron gave new vigour to St Francis Xavier, which had become a university in 1866. He imposed levies on each parish in support of the college after its government grant was withdrawn in 1881, and for the remainder of his life he strove constantly to improve the institution by constructing buildings, strengthening the faculty, promoting new programs in the humanities, commerce, and science, and introducing the ma and b.litt. degrees. Much of his attention was directed to it, and he has rightly been called the college\u2019s \u201csecond founder.\u201d Cameron\u2019s educational philosophy may be summarized by the phrase \u201ceducating the whole man,\u201d a popular slogan among Catholic educators of his day. As part of this approach, he sent bright theology students to seminaries in Rome, Quebec, or Montreal for advanced training in theology and other disciplines; those chosen returned home fluent in two or more languages.\n\nCameron was a firm believer in the importance of a better general education for women. Writing in 1895 to Lady Aberdeen [Marjoribanks*], he stated that \u201cthose who limit women\u2019s mission and sphere of action to the nursery misinterpret the word of God.\u201d In 1883 he had had the Congregation of Notre-Dame establish a convent school for girls in Antigonish. The school, renamed Mount St Bernard, later became a women\u2019s college, and it was affiliated with St Francis Xavier in 1894. In 1897 four of its students were awarded bas by St Francis Xavier, the first Catholic university in North America to offer to women courses which led to a degree.\n\nThe bishop was also more progressive than the majority of his Maritime colleagues in providing French-speaking priests for the Acadians of his diocese. Moreover, he sought to assist ethnic groups to preserve their languages and cultures by prescribing catechisms in French and Micmac and by helping to compile a catechism in Gaelic. In this endeavour he was probably the most active Catholic prelate in 19th-century Nova Scotia.\n\nOn matters which affected the faith and morals of his people, Cameron was inflexible. Periodically he directed his attention to the cause of temperance, issuing pastoral letters and urging his priests to speak out against the abuse of alcoholic beverages. The increasing popularity in the 1890s of round dances distressed the bishop because he disapproved of \u201cthe improper intimacies between young people\u201d which resulted. Like many Christian clerics of his day, Cameron believed that people had constantly to guard against committing sins of the flesh. In seeking to warn his flock of the dangers of sexual intimacy outside marriage he issued pastoral letters which left little room for misinterpretation. The bishop also insisted on the observance of church regulations for ritual, rubrics, and dogma, and the diocese was constantly made aware of edicts from Rome which affected the laws of the church.\n\nAlthough Cameron gave the appearance of ruling a theocratic kingdom, he did not normally abuse his episcopal power. He did, however, overstep himself in his involvement in politics. His first venture was in 1877, when John Sparrow David Thompson*, a Halifax lawyer and a convert to Catholicism, was suggested as a possible Conservative candidate for a provincial by-election in Antigonish County. The bishop had at one time supported the Liberals, but he believed that well-educated Catholics should take a greater role in public life, and Thompson had impressed him. He let it be known that he favoured Thompson, who won handily.\n\nThe result did not leave Cameron unscathed: he was attacked by Liberal politicians and newspapers for interfering in the political process. The criticism was repeated when he supported Thompson in provincial and federal elections up to 1891, several of which Thompson would not have won without his help. Although it was not thought unusual at the time for churchmen to be involved in politics, Cameron made himself more vulnerable to criticism than other Maritime prelates because of the direct and authoritarian manner in which he aired his views. Moreover, in backing Thompson he became involved in the grubby side of elections and enmeshed in a web of patronage.\n\nThe attacks on Cameron\u2019s interference in politics were harshest during the federal election campaign of 1896, when the Manitoba school question was a major topic of debate [see Thomas Greenway]. Cameron was the only Maritime bishop to advocate strongly and publicly the restoration of Catholic rights in Manitoba. Arguing that the school question was a religious matter, he ordered that a pastoral letter be read in all parishes just prior to the election. In it he stated that Catholics had to support their coreligionists in Manitoba and vote for the remedial legislation of the Conservatives. A majority of Catholics in the riding of Antigonish did not agree and helped elect a Liberal. The feeling against the letter in Heatherton, ten miles east of Antigonish, was so strong that when it was being read at least 40 parishioners walked out of the church. Incensed, the bishop accused the protesters of having insulted the priest by leaving; they countered that they were being coerced into voting for the Conservatives. Cameron denied the protesters the right to the sacraments until they apologized for causing scandal, and it was not until 1900, after the intervention of the apostolic delegate, that the dispute was resolved. The election also tarnished Cameron\u2019s image in Rome. Until then he had been held in great respect by the church authorities, but his involvement in the campaign led them to reprimand him.\n\nThe bishop\u2019s administrative skills were sorely tested after 1900, when new parishes had to be created almost overnight because of rapid industrialization in Cape Breton. Although he succeeded in meeting the challenge, he did not fully understand the changing social conditions wrought by the sudden influx of different racial and ethnic groups into his diocese. Nor did he completely comprehend the problems caused by industrialization and urbanization, having no experience of either development. Little is known about Cameron\u2019s views of the labour movement and trade unions, but the church as a whole reacted in a conservative manner to the rise of trade unionism in Cape Breton.\n\nBy the year of his death Cameron had achieved great successes. He had paid off a large diocesan debt incurred over the years and had had religious orders establish convents, hospitals, schools, and a home for the aged. He had also been mainly responsible for the creation of the Sisters of St Martha of Antigonish, founded in 1894 to perform domestic duties at St Francis Xavier (the order later moved into educational, hospital, and social work). Twenty-six new parishes had been formed, half in industrial Cape Breton. There were 93 priests, more than half of whom had been ordained by Cameron, and ten monks in a Trappist monastery at Tracadie. Moreover, the great majority of the priests had studied at St Francis Xavier, which had become the leading Catholic university in the Maritimes. By 1910 its staff consisted of nine priests and thirteen laymen, who offered a solid education as a basis for professional studies.\n\nJohn Cameron\u2019s long-lasting influence with Thompson and other politicians such as Sir Charles Tupper* and the respect in which he was held by his ecclesiastical peers give him a claim to a position of national importance. But although he was an outstanding churchman and achieved much as an administrator and educator, his political partisanship diminished his lustre.\n\nR. A. MacLean"}, {"url": "http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/cameron_john_1843_1908_13E.html", "page_content": "CAMERON, JOHN, newspaperman and office holder; b. 22 Jan. 1843 in Markham Township, Upper Canada, the third of eight children of William Cameron and Elizabeth Redfern; m. 30 Sept. 1869 Elizabeth Millar in London, Ont., and they had one son and four daughters; d. there 1 Dec. 1908.\n\nJohn Cameron was educated in Markham and then in London, where his parents settled in the early 1850s. In 1859 he began an apprenticeship as a printer with the London Free Press and during the next four years he learned his trade in London and Sarnia. Returning to London in 1863, he offered his services to Joseph Hiram Robinson*, who wanted someone to produce his weekly Evangelical Witness, organ of the Canadian Wesleyan Methodist New Connexion Church, and to manage his printing establishment in exchange for the use of the newspaper\u2019s office and press. However, illness and an unexpected donation, which enabled him to clear his debts on the Witness, prompted Robinson to offer Cameron the opportunity of purchasing the press in return for a commitment to continue the Witness.\n\nCameron accepted the offer and published the Witness until the New Connexion Methodists united with the Wesleyan Methodists in 1874. He also immediately began planning his own newspaper and on 27 Oct. 1863 started the daily London Evening Advertiser and Family Newspaper. Perhaps because of financial constraints, Cameron\u2019s newspaper was politically independent and was produced in a small format. More important, it was published in the evening so that it could report the avidly sought-after telegraphic dispatches from the Civil War in the United States ahead of its rival morning newspapers. The Advertiser was an instant success and within a year it was enlarged to full broadsheet size. Cameron added staff and improved its design and editorial content. The Weekly Advertiser was added in 1864, and a morning edition was started in 1878. The newspaper\u2019s growth brought him financial independence and status in the community and in the industry. He joined the Canadian Press Association, serving as president in 1872 and 1875. The Advertiser\u2019s strength was due in part to Cameron\u2019s ability to draw upon other members of his family for support. His brother William contributed as local editor and in the business management of the company, and his father, William Sr, as bookkeeper.\n\nJohn Cameron\u2019s family had long supported the Reformers and he also held advanced Liberal views. There were, as well, two Liberal-Conservative newspapers in London, and so it was perhaps inevitable that the Advertiser became a Liberal standard-bearer. By the early 1870s it was the second most important Liberal publication in Ontario after the Toronto Globe, published by George Brown*. Under Cameron\u2019s direction, the newspaper favoured reciprocity with the United States, greater autonomy within the British empire, and women\u2019s suffrage, as well as temperance and Sabbatarianism, interests he carried over to private life as president of a temperance organization and a vice-president of the London chapter of the Lord\u2019s Day Alliance. A favourite target for the newspaper was John Carling*, a Conservative and a brewer.\n\nIn 1874 Cameron\u2019s political views brought him to join a group of rebellious Liberals, including David Mills, a contributor to the Advertiser, who were drawn together in support of Edward Blake* in challenging the authority of Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie*. In January 1875, with financial assistance from Blake and Goldwin Smith, Cameron moved to Toronto to begin the Liberal, a morning daily and a platform for Blake\u2019s views. For Cameron it was also an audacious effort to supplant the Globe. However, the revolt of the Blake wing, which had begun so auspiciously, soon collapsed. The consequences for Cameron of his move to the Liberal were disastrous. Competition from the Globe was fierce and the cost of publishing in Toronto greatly exceeded his expectations. As a result, the Liberal suffered heavy losses and in June Cameron closed the newspaper and returned to London. There he was obliged to fend off an attack on the Advertiser from the Free Press, which had begun an evening edition. In 1876, moreover, George Brown began chartering daily trains in order to sell the Globe in southwestern Ontario in competition with the Advertiser.\n\nSurprisingly, the strains of failure did not result in a rift between Cameron and his colleagues in the Blake wing. In 1877 Mills became chief editorial writer for the Advertiser, and in December 1882 Blake, now leader of the Liberals, was instrumental in having Cameron named managing editor of the Globe when John Gordon Brown, who had succeeded his brother George, was removed from the position. The appointment represented a tremendous honour for Cameron and surely a touch of revenge for the loss of the Liberal. Mills took over as editorial director of the Advertiser.\n\nThe Globe had suffered from stagnant circulation and advertising revenues for many years, trends Cameron failed to reverse. Its main competitor, the Conservative Toronto Daily Mail [see Christopher William Bunting*], had developed into a profitable newspaper. By 1887, because of its independent political stance, it had also acquired a reputation for impartiality. The Globe\u2019s loss of readership was exacerbated by the political woes of the Liberals under Blake and later Wilfrid Laurier*. Partisan loyalty dictated a moderation on issues such as the North-West rebellion and the Jesuits\u2019 Estates Act that was completely out of step with the sentiments of the majority in Ontario. Cameron\u2019s desperate efforts to find positions acceptable to both the party and his readers made the Globe appear irresolute and resulted in the alienation of both masters. In 1890 he stepped down and was replaced by John Stephen Willison*, who had joined the Advertiser in 1881.\n\nCameron returned to the Advertiser, which was itself on the brink of serious financial difficulties. There were repeated attempts to start new dailies in London, and in 1896 the Advertiser faced increased competition in the evening market from the News. An independent penny daily, the News made inroads into the Advertiser\u2019s circulation and advertising and forced the cash-poor Cameron to cut his price from two cents to just a penny. The effect was devastating: by 1899 Cameron had accumulated huge debts with his newsprint supplier, the Canada Paper Company. It seized the Advertiser and began searching for a buyer. Cameron failed to find backing and the paper was purchased by Thomas Hunter Purdom, a London lawyer and a Liberal. Cameron made a desperate effort to maintain an interest in the business and his complaints about his treatment were a great embarrassment to Purdom. They were also likely the reason for his appointment in 1903 as postmaster of London, a position he held until 1 Dec. 1908 when he died from a heart attack suffered at a speaking engagement in London. He was survived by his wife, who in the 1890s had published the weekly Wives and Daughters.\n\nJohn Cameron was a talented and principled journalist and publisher who rose to the pinnacle of Canada\u2019s newspaper business. He developed the Advertiser into one of the finest dailies in the dominion and gave the Globe able management through the 1880s, an extremely troublesome decade for the Liberal party and its principal newspaper. At his death, he was seen as an example of his industry\u2019s vanishing old guard of editor-publishers who had learned their trade as apprentices and had risen to positions of prominence in the highly partisan journalism of the 19th century.\n\nR. Neil Matheson"}, {"url": "http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/cameron_john_hillyard_10E.html", "page_content": "CAMERON, JOHN HILLYARD, lawyer, businessman, politician, Orangeman, and prominent Church of England layman; b. at Blendecques, France, 14 April 1817, son of Angus Cameron; d. at Toronto, Ont., 14 Nov. 1876.\n\nAngus Cameron, a soldier in the 79th Highlanders during the Napoleonic wars, remained after 1815 with the British forces in France, where his son John Hillyard was born. In 1825, when Angus was posted to Kingston, the family emigrated to Upper Canada. Hillyard attended Kilkenny College in Ireland, then at Kingston the Midland District grammar school and a coeducational school, operated by the Reverend John Cruikshank. He was briefly a schoolmate of Oliver Mowat* and John A. Macdonald*.\n\nAngus was posted to York (Toronto) in 1831, and John Hillyard was sent to Upper Canada College. He then began the study of law under Henry John Boulton*, a Family Compact Tory. The rebellion of 1837 broke out as his legal training was coming to an end; he was a captain in the Queen\u2019s Rangers, and on 4 Dec. 1837 Colonel James FitzGibbon* sent him to Toronto to warn of the approach of William Lyon Mackenzie*\u2019s forces. After serving briefly in the Toronto area he helped guard the Niagara frontier. Cameron was only 20 at the time, and the rebellion almost certainly helped to strengthen his conservative outlook.\n\nCameron returned to Toronto and was called to the bar of Upper Canada in 1838. He immediately formed a partnership with J. Godfrey Spragge*. In the 1840s Cameron built a lucrative law practice and a province-wide reputation. His work included criminal cases, and he produced two legal compendia. In 1840 he was a commissioner for the revision of the statutes of Upper Canada, and, as reporter to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Canada West (still popularly called Upper Canada) from 1843 to 1846, he was responsible for inaugurating the Upper Canada Law Reports; he was appointed a qc in 1846. He was chairman of the 1856\u201357 commission for the consolidation of the statutes of Upper Canada. In 1860 he was elected treasurer of the Law Society of Upper Canada, and was called to the bar of Quebec in 1869. In 1843 he had married Elizabeth, the third daughter of H. J. Boulton. She died in 1844, leaving a son, and in 1849 Cameron married Ellen Mallet, daughter of an American general. They had two sons and two daughters.\n\nPolitics, a sure route to public recognition, was an easy one for a lawyer to take, and Cameron entered both municipal and provincial politics in 1846. In Toronto he was elected alderman for St Andrew\u2019s ward for 1846\u201347 and 1851\u201352, and for St John\u2019s ward in 1854 (when his ward colleague was Ogle Robert Gowan) and 1855.\n\nIn the provincial sphere, Cameron gravitated naturally to the Conservative group. William Henry Draper, a \u201cmoderate Conservative,\u201d was government leader, but only by maintaining a precarious balance in the Legislative Assembly. Draper was dependent upon the Upper Canadian moderates and Tories elected after Lord Metcalfe*\u2019s emotional appeals in the election of 1844, and they were far from a homogeneous group. The moderates refused to follow the Tories, and the Tories in turn bitterly resented Draper\u2019s support for the union of Upper and Lower Canada in 1841. The Tory faction was largely unrepresented in the Executive Council in order to retain the moderates\u2019 support; it stood by Draper, but only because to desert him would be to betray Metcalfe and his policies. Moreover, Draper had virtually no personal following, and attracted few French Canadians.\n\nWithin this near-vacuum of leadership Cameron seemed an attractive young politician. Reasonably moderate, he was respected as a lawyer and an able administrator. His popularity in Toronto might be sufficient to check the Tories within their stronghold. Although Cameron, as counsel to the Corporation of King\u2019s College, had opposed Draper\u2019s university bill of 1845, he was immediately offered the non-ministerial post of solicitor general for Upper Canada. His acceptance on 1 July 1846 was a move hardly calculated to please the Tory faction: Draper had just dismissed a Tory leader, Henry Sherwood*, from that post \u201cbecause he [had] not given the administration his wholehearted support.\u201d In later years Cameron was taunted with the epithet, \u201cextreme Conservative,\u201d but in 1846 he clearly regarded himself as a follower of Draper, not of Sherwood. Cameron was asked to prepare two bills, one for a \u201cuniform system of trying contested Elections,\u201d the other for the \u201cbetter administration of Justice in Upper Canada.\u201d He had to be in the assembly in order to present his bills: the constituency of Cornwall was opened and Cameron was elected in August 1846.\n\nWith Sherwood, his potential successor, removed, Draper turned to a personal objective \u2013 the post of puisne judge of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Upper Canada. On the anticipated death of the incumbent, Christopher Hagerman*, Draper promptly resigned as attorney general, and was appointed judge on 28 May 1847. Draper had hoped to choose his own successor and first asked Cameron to take over as government leader and attorney general west. He declined, arguing \u201cthat retaining [the] position of solicitor-general of Upper Canada will best serve the interests of the Province.\u201d Sherwood then became Draper\u2019s successor. Cameron consoled himself with promotion to a seat on the Executive Council, obtained on 22 May 1847.\n\nThe invitation to lead the Upper Canadian Conservatives was the peak of Cameron\u2019s political career. But he was not, in fact, in a position to succeed Draper. Cameron was asked because Draper was reluctant to surrender to Sherwood without at least token resistance. Draper\u2019s following was small and his choice limited to a handful of men, notably Cameron, John A. Macdonald, and William Morris*. None of these had the identification with Metcalfe\u2019s policies that enabled Draper to exercise some control over the Tories. Led by Allan MacNab* and Sherwood, the Tory members, the largest group of government supporters, were, consequently, now in control.\n\nThe political outlook, however, was unpleasant for the Conservatives. The new governor general, Lord Elgin [Bruce*], had no intention of bolstering up Sherwood\u2019s regime when the assembly was dissolved late in 1847. In the ensuing elections the government suffered overwhelming electoral defeat by the Reformers under Robert Baldwin* and Louis-Hippolyte La Fontaine*. Cameron lost in Kent to Malcolm Cameron and retained Cornwall by only 16 votes amid \u201cevidence of gross irregularities.\u201d With his colleagues he left office on 10 May 1848.\n\nCameron was one of the few Conservative leaders to survive the election, and in 1850 George Duck described him as \u201cthe great gun of the Tories . . . .\u201d But with the Conservatives virtually obliterated in Lower Canada and reduced to a small rump in Upper Canada, revival would require an alliance with French Canadians and policies attractive to moderate opinion in Upper Canada. Cameron could not provide this kind of leadership \u2013 he had no important ties with French Canada or its leaders, and his prominent role in the Church of England as a close colleague of Bishop John Strachan* and a strong defender of the church\u2019s claims to the clergy reserves alienated moderate opinion in Upper Canada. Dedicated to his church\u2019s claims to sectarian educational rights and closely identified with MacNab and Toronto conservatism, Cameron, though able, energetic, and popular in many quarters, was not palatable to most Upper Canadian moderates.\n\nConfusion within Reform ranks after 1849, moreover, did not assist the Conservatives. Instead, new Reform leaders, Francis Hincks* and Augustin-Norbert Morin*, won an easy electoral victory in 1851. Cameron was not a candidate. He may have wanted rest, having been ill several times during the 1840s. The less taxing municipal sphere occupied him politically until 1854. In that year he obtained control of the Toronto British Colonist from Samuel Thompson*, whom he retained as editor. According to Thompson, \u201cIt had been a semi-weekly paper; he [Cameron] offered to furnish five thousand dollars a year to make it a daily journal, independent of party control; stipulated for no personal influence over its editorial views, leaving them entirely in my discretion . . . .\u201d The arrangement continued until 1857.\n\nCameron contested the Toronto seat in 1854. He and John George Bowes* won, defeating Henry Sherwood, William Henry Boulton, and George Percival Ridout. Cameron was now the senior member for Upper Canada\u2019s largest and wealthiest town. His return coincided with the formation of the Morin\u2013MacNab\u2013Macdonald Liberal-Conservative administration, and Macdonald, who had earlier dismissed Cameron as lacking in \u201cgeneral intelligence, and . . . [as] altogether devoid of political reading,\u201d successfully excluded him from the ministry.\n\nYet, in the crucial question facing the ministry, that of the clergy reserves, Cameron, striving to save as much as possible for the Church of England, differed from Macdonald only in degree. Macdonald was willing to see the favoured churches retain much of their income, and, in the settlement of 1854 whereby clergymen with recognized rights to income agreed to commute their claims, the Church of England, though losing its reserve lands, acquired a large capital fund which accrued to its benefit as the annuitants died. Cameron was given considerable credit for his church\u2019s success; he had worked closely with Strachan, and during the protracted and delicate negotiations with many of the annuitants he represented both the government and the church. His vigour in upholding the vested rights of privilege, and his refusal to support the coalition in the introduction of an elective upper house, however, lumped him in many minds with the \u201cold Tories.\u201d His stand on these issues alienated Macdonald, who was further irritated in 1856 when Cameron supported George Brown in the latter\u2019s dispute with Macdonald over the results of the committee Brown had chaired in 1849 investigating conditions at the Portsmouth Penitentiary.\n\nThe \u201cCorrigan Incident\u201d gave Cameron an opportunity to intensify his campaign against the coalition. In February 1856 a jury found seven Roman Catholics not guilty of Robert Corrigan*\u2019s murder at Lotbini\u00e8re, and many Upper Canadian Protestants screamed indignation. Cameron took their lead and on 7 March moved in parliament a resolution asking for publication of Judge Jean-Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph Duval\u2019s charge to the jury, which many Protestants felt had been irregular. It carried but the government, after winning a vote of confidence, refused to resign or to produce Duval\u2019s charge. The damage had nevertheless been done: divided internally and battered from without by Cameron, Brown, Grits, and Rouges, MacNab\u2019s government was disintegrating. MacNab was forced out as premier in May 1856 and Macdonald became leader of Upper Canada\u2019s Conservatives. John Charles Dent* was doubtless correct when he commented that \u201cMr. Cameron was very willing to have greatness thrust upon him . . . .\u201d Cameron was not, however, a viable alternative to MacNab. The considerations that militated against his success in 1847\u201351 remained factors of real importance. The \u201cCorrigan Incident\u201d indicated the extent to which he would make use of religious and racist passion to build a regional following in Upper Canada. French Canada was outside his range of potential appeal. Cameron now \u201cwent into continuing opposition\u201d with an occasional and small following of disgruntled backbenchers. Whatever leadership aspirations he retained were smashed by the financial panic of 1857.\n\nLike many of his contemporaries, Cameron had developed an interest in transportation ventures. He served as a director of the Toronto and Guelph Railway (absorbed in 1856 by the Grand Trunk Railway) and as solicitor for the Great Western Railway, and was part-owner of the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge Company. He was also heavily involved in insurance. He helped found the Canada Life Assurance Company in 1847 and was elected a director. He was chosen president of the Provincial Insurance Company in 1859, a position he held for many years, and later served as chairman of the Canadian board of the Edinburgh Life Insurance Company, and director of the Canadian Life Assurance Company and the Beaver Mutual Fire Insurance Association.\n\nAmong his earliest business ventures was the purchase of large tracts of land in the Toronto area, but it was heavy investments in speculative English securities, through the brokerage firm of Duncan Sherman and Company of New York, that made him a wealthy man. His paper profits in the boom of the mid\u20131850s were enormous. But in the fall of 1857 investment money dried up after a financial panic and an international depression followed. Canada was hard-hit because of her orgy of land and railway speculation during the early 1850s and a crop failure which coincided with the business crisis. Duncan Sherman and Company collapsed, and as Samuel Thompson explained: \u201cDrafts on London were dishonoured, and Mr. Cameron\u2019s bankers there, to protect themselves, sold without notice the securities he had placed in their hands . . . .\u201d\n\nCameron\u2019s losses reached the staggering sum of \u00a3100,000. Although he must have realized the futility of his decision, he promised to repay his debts pound for pound. What assets remained were liquidated or mortgaged, and much of his land was sold. Using Toronto properties as collateral, he borrowed large sums from the Church Society, in transactions later attacked as too much in his favour, and from the Commercial Bank. For the remainder of his life Cameron carried the burden of these heavy debts. All other interests suffered as he strove, chiefly through the practice of law, to raise large sums of money. When he died his liabilities still exceeded his assets by $200,000.\n\nHis political career also suffered immediate decline. The Colonist could no longer be supported; instead it became an organ of the Macdonald\u2013George-\u00c9tienne Cartier regime. Much of his political independence vanished; within a few months he started to receive legal patronage from Macdonald.\n\nOne of Cameron\u2019s strongest political bases had been his connection with the Church of England. Deeply committed to its welfare, and through it to education, he had served both causes in a variety of ways. With an early law partner, James McGill Strachan, the bishop\u2019s son, he represented the missionary service and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Upper Canada. A representative Church of England leader, he was appointed to the first senate of the University of Toronto in 1850, and served on the University Visitation Commission in 1850, \u201cto report a code of proper Statutes, Rules and Ordinances for the Government of the University [of Toronto],\u201d and on the endowment board of the university and of Upper Canada College in 1850; he was a member of the council of the latter. When John Strachan established an Anglican university in the province following the creation of the University of Toronto, Cameron introduced Trinity College\u2019s incorporation bill in the assembly in 1851. After several years on the council of Trinity College (and as a professor of law from 1852), he was elected to succeed Sir John Beverley Robinson* as second chancellor of the college in 1863, a post he held until his death. Cameron took these educational duties seriously; he founded scholarships and involved himself in financial management. Cameron was also sufficiently influential within the church to overcome Strachan\u2019s reluctance to have a successor bishop appointed in the see of Toronto; at the diocesan synod in 1865 he moved the resolution that in 1866 permitted Alexander Neil Bethune to be elected coadjutor.\n\nBut grief as well as satisfaction came from his church connection. Division had been growing within the Church of England between the low church and high church parties. The rupture was made open in the election of the bishop of the new diocese of Huron in 1857. Trinity College became a focal point of accusations from the low churchmen, especially Bishop Benjamin Cronyn of Huron; in 1863 Huron College was founded in opposition to Trinity. Cameron\u2019s close identification with Trinity College, and his association with Strachan and Bethune, both regarded as high churchmen, linked him with that group, and he lost his position as a representative churchman.\n\nHis association with the church\u2019s investment fund also proved damaging. In 1861 the Toronto Globe charged that he could not account for the money from the clergy reserves commutation fund entrusted to him by the Church Society for investment. It claimed that he handed over instead \u201ca quantity of land which though not of the full value of the monies placed in his hands was apparently accepted by the Church Society.\u201d J. W. Gamble, chairman of the committee which administered the commutation fund, and C. J. Campbell of the executive committee, immediately issued \u201ca flat denial\u201d of the charges. The Globe, doubtless influenced by the fact that Gamble and Campbell were well-known Conservative stalwarts, stuck by its charge.\n\nMore serious was the accusation in May 1865 by W. H. Boulton, a cousin of Cameron\u2019s first wife, that large sums administered by the Church Society had been manipulated by Cameron for his personal benefit, and that the Church Society, leading members of which were Cameron\u2019s friends and political colleagues, camouflaged the situation through an inadequate auditing arrangement. The society\u2019s management committee exonerated Cameron, but nonetheless his reputation suffered. The Globe pointed out that the Church Society refused to approve a full and competent audit, and it in fact established a strong case that Cameron had borrowed more than $40,000 from church funds on \u201cinsufficient\u201d security.\n\nWith this series of reversals in business and church connections, and Macdonald confirmed as Conservative leader, Cameron, to retain any independent political authority, needed another power base. He had found it in the Orange order. During the 1840s and 1850s the Orange order had gained both in numbers and in respectability. It had moved, under Ogle R. Gowan\u2019s leadership, into a continuing alliance with Conservative moderates like Macdonald. But George Benjamin* became grand master in 1846 and he tended towards Upper Canadian sectionalism, suspicious of any Conservative alliance with French-speaking Catholics and not unwilling to work with Reformers. A schism occurred in 1853 when Gowan attempted to unseat Benjamin as grand master. Cameron, who joined a Toronto lodge, no.507, in 1856, was given much credit for the reunion in that year of the two grand lodges, under George Lyttleton Allen. Cameron was a follower of Benjamin, but, although willing to oppose the Cartier\u2013Macdonald government on regional and racial issues, he was not in favour of an alliance with the Reformers. He was elected grand master in 1859 and served until 1870, when he was succeeded by Mackenzie Bowell*.\n\nThe Orange order became the backbone of lower class support for the Conservative party. Although Cameron\u2019s role as leader of this group has sometimes appeared to be anomalous, he was doing what the Duke of Cumberland, a grand master of the British lodges, had done earlier in Britain. He might be using the order for his own political ends, but Orangemen would also benefit in obtaining a leader who was a member of the social \u00e9lite \u2013 a man who combined prestige with organizational ability. As grand master, Cameron quickly undertook a major reorganization, establishing three grand lodges in the Canadas, for Western Canada, Central Canada, and Eastern Canada, in 1859. A grand lodge was provided for each of the Maritime colonies, and each of the three western districts of Saskatchewan, British Columbia, and Vancouver Island was given permission to form a separate grand lodge as soon as it had ten primary lodges; by 1863 organizational work was under way in both Newfoundland and British Columbia. Cameron also involved himself in international Orange activities.\n\nA crisis involving the order was occasioned in 1860 by the visit of the Prince of Wales to Canada. Because the Orange order was banned in Britain, the prince was advised by the Duke of Newcastle to give no official recognition to the order in Canada. Orangemen were infuriated by what they regarded as a slur on their loyalty. In a series of comic-opera incidents at Kingston and elsewhere, Orangemen strove to have the prince pass under an Orange arch or to recognize the order in some equivalent manner. Newcastle was generally successful in avoiding official contact with the Orangemen, who directed much of their anger at the Canadian government, and at Macdonald in particular. Cameron muted Orange fury with Macdonald while collecting signatures for a petition, protesting Newcastle\u2019s advice and affirming Orange loyalty, which he took to London in 1861. His motivation is difficult to assess. Perhaps it was to prevent the \u201cOrange Order from breaking completely away from Sir John Macdonald,\u201d as Richard Cartwright* thought, but his massive petition has been seen by a modern historian, D. G. Creighton*, as a threat to the Conservative ministry: \u201cAcclaimed once more, brought suddenly back to something like his old prominence, Cameron was virtually leading an anti-ministerial wing of Conservative Orangemen . . . .\u201d Certainly Cameron sought more influence, which would add to his prestige and give him additional patronage power and a voice in making policy. Consistent with his Benjaminite views, he was a strong supporter of representation by population, and by advocating regional policies he was strengthening his political position in Upper Canada. But his personal financial struggles precluded the accepting of office. What Cameron wanted was influence, not formal leadership. His new base could possibly give him such influence within the Conservative party as Macdonald\u2019s ally, if Macdonald could accept the fact that Cameron was no threat to his leadership.\n\nCameron ran against George Brown in the Toronto by-election resulting from the accession to power of the Reformers in 1858, but lost in this endeavour, which was probably not very serious. In the general election of 1861, with his finances improving, he successfully contested Peel, an Orange stronghold, and held the seat until 1867. Back in the assembly after an absence of four years (he was not a candidate in 1857), he found a troubled ministry. The cabinet underwent chronic reorganization in 1861\u201362, and Macdonald had difficulty maintaining his position. Representation by population had become so popular in Upper Canada that many Conservatives espoused it in spite of Macdonald\u2019s stubborn refusal to endanger his alliance with the French Canadians by it. Conservative advocates of rep by pop would have to be admitted to the cabinet, but Macdonald would not have Cameron. There is no conclusive evidence, however, that Cameron wanted to enter the cabinet in 1861. The next year he claimed that he was asked but this claim too is unsupported. Cameron did cooperate with Macdonald in the delicate task of cabinet reorganization in 1862, as intermediary between Macdonald and Thomas Clark Street, a rep by pop Tory from Welland.\n\nAfter the fall of the Cartier\u2013Macdonald government in 1862, Macdonald overcame his old suspicion that Cameron was a rival for leadership, and Cameron in turn was willing to accept a minor position in Canadian public life. Their rapprochement was sealed at a public dinner in February 1863, when Cameron affirmed his loyalty to Macdonald and assured Conservatives that their differences had been resolved. Differences of view could now prove useful rather than harmful; in 1863, for example, when Cameron voted against third reading of Richard Scott*\u2019s education bill, he helped soothe militantly Protestant Conservatives who saw the bill as a manifestation of \u201cFrench domination.\u201d So firm was the reconciliation that Macdonald attempted to bring Cameron into the short-lived Macdonald\u2013Sir \u00c9tienne-Paschal Tach\u00e9* government of 1864. Unable to have the attorney generalship, Cameron refused, \u201cas I would never take any office in any Ministry which was outside of my profession.\u201d Yet Cameron knew that as leader Macdonald must be attorney general west; he himself could not give up the full-time practice of law. But he would support the ministry: \u201cI must show myself in the House . . . or my friends here will think that there is something wrong, and that I am not giving the government the support which they ought to receive.\u201d\n\nCameron supported confederation in 1865, but with reservations. He was enthusiastic about transcontinental expansion and anxious to see rep by pop effected; he also felt that the alternative to confederation was annexation to the United States. He preferred legislative union, but he was confident that it would come. His main objection was to the lack of public involvement in the confederation movement. He wanted \u201ca constitutional appeal . . . to the people,\u201d but was resigned to the failure of a resolution to that effect. When the new constitution for Ontario was debated, Cameron moved for a two-house legislature; this motion too was lost.\n\nThe Fenian troubles of 1866 illustrated Cameron\u2019s usefulness to the regime; Lord Monck* asked him to assist in muting Orange\u2013Catholic hostility, as \u201cthere is a certain amount of bad feeling beginning to exhibit itself between Protestants and Roman Catholics . . . in connection with the late Fenian raids . . . .\u201d Later in 1866 and in 1867 he was associated with Robert Alexander Harrison in the prosecution of many Fenian invaders. In 1868 he displayed his professional independence by defending Patrick James Whelan*, the murderer of D\u2019Arcy McGee*.\n\nIn 1867 Cameron contested Peel for the House of Commons. He was out of the country for most of the campaign, attending the founding meeting of the Imperial Grand Orange Council at London, and he needed assistance from Macdonald in a contest so doubtful that Macdonald postponed it for as long as he could (a practice made possible by not holding simultaneous elections). Cameron ultimately won a narrow victory.\n\nCameron\u2019s political standing declined rapidly after 1867. In 1856 Macdonald had offered Cameron a judgeship; when a judicial appointment for Cameron was mooted in 1867, Macdonald dismissed it. Later in 1867 Cameron wanted the speakership of the House of Commons and \u201cpressed\u201d his claims \u201cvigorously\u201d; James Cockburn* obtained the post. As his independence declined, Cameron\u2019s loyalty to the ministry increased. He sometimes assisted the prime minister in drafting legislation, and often acted for Conservatives in contested election cases. Liberal leader Edward Blake* regarded Cameron as a ministerial tool, describing him in 1873 as \u201cthe gentleman who had never hesitated to come to the front on doubtful and desperate issues . . . .\u201d\n\nCameron\u2019s involvement in the Pacific scandal dramatically reveals his political decline. In 1873 he became chairman of the parliamentary committee appointed to investigate Lucius S. Huntington*\u2019s charge of a causal tie between the grant of the transcontinental railway charter to Hugh Allan* and Allan\u2019s massive contributions to the Conservative campaign in 1872. Cameron assisted the ministry\u2019s delaying tactics by moving on 5 May 1873 the postponement of the committee\u2019s proceedings until 2 July, when parliament would be in session. The grounds he gave for the delay were specious: the impossibility of proceeding with the investigation in the absence of Cartier and John Joseph Caldwell Abbott*. The Liberals regarded him with suspicion, and Alexander Mackenzie* believed that Cameron himself had obtained a $5,000 \u201cindefinite loan\u201d from Allan \u2013 \u201csuch is the Chairman of the investigating Committee.\u201d Macdonald claimed that he had not consented to Cameron\u2019s appointment to the parliamentary committee, and had not suggested his name.\n\nCameron had in fact obtained $5,000 from Allan, through Macdonald, to finance his 1872 election campaigns in Peel and Cardwell. He lost Peel in 1872 but was elected for Cardwell, a safe Orange and Conservative seat, where he had asked for Macdonald\u2019s assistance to obtain the nomination. He retained Cardwell in 1874 in spite of the Liberal sweep, and was still a member when he suffered a heart attack and died at \u201cThe Meadows,\u201d his Toronto home, on 14 Nov. 1876.\n\nWell educated, a gifted lawyer, and with close ties to the provincial \u00e9lite, John Hillyard Cameron showed considerable promise during his early career. His initial political base \u2013 Toronto conservatism, the Church of England, and the business community \u2013 was not strong enough to propel him into a position of power in a party dominated after 1856 by John A. Macdonald, and his situation was badly compromised when his large fortune vanished in 1857. His later association with the Orange order and with sectional and regional policies such as representation by population failed to overcome the crippling effects of these losses. Thus his political position was never strong, and has probably been overestimated by both his contemporaries and historians. He was nevertheless essentially a political man, who remained in parliament until his career there had come to involve both pain and humiliation.\n\nDonald Swainson"}, {"url": "https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/mukong-v-cameroon/", "page_content": "Case Summary and Outcome\n\nThe Human Rights Committee (HRC) found that the Government of Cameroon had violated, among other rights, the right to freedom of expression of Albert Mukong, a writer, journalist and opponent of the country\u2019s one-party system. Mukong was arrested and detained in inhumane conditions, once after criticizing the Government and President of Cameroon and again for meeting to discuss the introduction of multi-party democracy; the State denied Mukong\u2019s allegations of wrongdoing, declaring that its actions were a necessary safeguard to national unity as allowed under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The HRC rejected this defense and furthermore reasoned that protecting and strengthening national unity cannot be achieved by muzzling advocacy for multi-party democracy and human rights.\n\nFacts\n\nAlbert Mukong was a journalist and outspoken longtime opponent of a one-party system in Cameroon. In 1988, he was arrested after giving a BBC interview in which he criticized Cameroon\u2019s government and President. He was subjected to what he described as cruel and inhuman treatment during his detention. He was held in a small cell, without sanitary facilities and access to food until friends and family located him. He was released in May 1989. In 1990, he held a meeting to discuss different ways to introduce multi-party democracy in Cameroon. Following this he was rearrested, and during this detention he was subjected to intimidation and mental torture. His captors threatened to shoot him should any unrest arise among the population. He was charged and convicted of \u201cintoxication of international and national opinion\u201d.\n\nBefore the HRC, Mukong argued that he had twice applied to the High Court of Cameroon for writs of habeas corpus but that his pleas had been rejected on the grounds that the case was before a military tribunal, where the writ of habeas corpus did not apply. Further, he could not bring a civil claim for cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment because under Cameroonian law, a Military Tribunal cannot entertain a civil action separately from a criminal action it has been declared competent to preside over. Only the Minister of Defense or the examining magistrate can seize the military tribunal with a civil action not civilians. Therefore, Mukong argued that there were no remedies available to him domestically.\n\nMukong complained of violations of Article 7 ICCPR (freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment), Article 9 ICCPR (the right to liberty and security of person), Article 12 ICCPR (freedom from arbitrary deprivation of the right to enter one\u2019s own country), and Article 14 ICCPR (equality before the law). He further complained that because his arrest and detention were linked to his activities as an advocate of multiparty democracy, his right to freedom of expression had been violated.\n\nThe State argued that Mukong was never subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, and that he had not exhausted his remedies. The State denied that it had violated Articles 7, 9, or 12 and argued that his arrest had been necessary to safeguard national security, as allowed under Article 19(3) ICCPR. The State contended that the exercise of the right to freedom of expression must take into account the prevailing political context and that since Cameroon\u2019s independence and reunification, there has been a constant struggle to strengthen national unity.\n\nDecision Overview\n\nWith regard to the alleged inhuman treatment, the HRC held that it was incumbent upon the State party to refute the allegations in detail. Mukong had provided detailed information about the treatment he had been subjected to and failing evidence to the contrary, the Committee found that this constituted cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment in violation of Article 7 ICCPR.\n\nWith regard to the alleged violation of the right to freedom of expression, the HRC explained that any restrictions on this right must be provided for by law, pursue a legitimate aim (such as safeguarding national security or public order) and be strictly necessary to achieve this legitimate purpose. Examining the State\u2019s arguments against these criteria, the HRC found that an unsubstantiated need to safeguard an alleged vulnerable state of national unity could not justify subjecting individuals to arrest, detention and inhuman treatment. Furthermore, the HRC held that \u201cthe legitimate objective of safeguarding and indeed strengthening national unity under difficult political circumstances cannot be achieved by attempting to muzzle advocacy of multi-party democracy, democratic tenets and human rights\u201d. The Committee concluded that there had been a violation of Article 19 ICCPR.\n\nThe HRC also found on careful examination of the evidence and material before it that Mukong\u2019s right to a fair trial had not been violated. In respect of Article 9 the Committee noted that the material and evidence before it was not sufficient to make a finding , and with regard to Article 12 the Committee found Mukong had not been forced into exile by the State party\u2019s authorities."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-C-Fremont", "page_content": "John C. Fr\u00e9mont, in full John Charles Fr\u00e9mont, (born January 21, 1813, Savannah, Georgia, U.S.\u2014died July 13, 1890, New York, New York), American military officer and an early explorer and mapmaker of the American West, who was one of the principal figures in opening up that region to settlement and was instrumental in the U.S. conquest and development of California. He was also a politician who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. presidency in 1856 as the first candidate of the newly formed Republican Party.\n\nWhen Fr\u00e9mont was six years old, his father, a French \u00e9migr\u00e9, died, and the family moved from Georgia to Charleston, South Carolina. There Fr\u00e9mont entered the College of Charleston in 1829, where he displayed an especially marked aptitude for mathematics. He was expelled before graduation for irregular attendance but was granted a B.A. degree in 1836. In 1833, through the efforts of the prominent South Carolina politician Joel R. Poinsett, Fr\u00e9mont secured a position as a teacher of mathematics aboard the U.S. warship Natchez, which cruised along the South American coast for two and a half years. After returning, he served as assistant engineer on a railroad survey between Charleston and Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nIn 1838 Poinsett\u2014by then the U.S. secretary of war\u2014commissioned Fr\u00e9mont as a second lieutenant of topographical engineers for the U.S. Army and assigned him to assist the French scientist Joseph Nicolas Nicollet on a three-year mission of surveying and mapping the upper Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Fr\u00e9mont also headed an expedition (1841) to survey the Des Moines River for Nicollet, the Frenchman having given him expert instruction in geology, topography, and astronomy. His growing taste for wilderness exploration was whetted by the expansionist enthusiasm of Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton, who became his adviser, sponsor, and, in 1841, father-in-law. Benton\u2019s influence in government enabled Fr\u00e9mont to accomplish within the next few years the mapping of much of the territory between the Mississippi valley and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn 1842, as emigration to the Oregon country in the Pacific Northwest was growing dramatically in importance for the nation, the War Department sent Fr\u00e9mont on an expedition to survey the route west from the Mississippi River to the Wyoming region. While in the Wind River Range there, he scaled the mountain that now bears his name (Fremont Peak). In 1843, accompanied by the colourful guide Kit Carson and mountain man Thomas Fitzpatrick, he completed an even more important survey to the mouth of the Columbia River. After thoroughly exploring much of the Pacific Northwest, he went southward into Mexican-controlled territory. He first went through what is now northwestern Nevada and then made a perilous westward winter crossing of the Sierra Nevada to California, reaching Fort Sutter on the Sacramento River in March 1844. That exploit, which was included in the report he made of the trip after returning east, added greatly to his fame.\n\nWar between the United States and Mexico over the annexation of Texas seemed imminent, and in the spring of 1845 Fr\u00e9mont headed a third expedition west, ostensively to explore the Great Basin and Pacific coast but also with secret instructions for action in case of war. Upon his arrival in southern California at the end of the year, he and his armed party defied Mexican authorities before backing down and heading north into southern Oregon. He and his group soon returned south (early May 1846) after he received a dispatch (the contents of which are still unknown) from a confidential messenger from Washington, D.C. Back in California, Fr\u00e9mont threw his support behind a small group of dissident American settlers near Sonoma who had started an unofficial uprising and had established the short-lived Bear Flag Republic. News of the U.S. declaration of war with Mexico soon reached California, and Fr\u00e9mont was appointed by Commodore Robert F. Stockton as major of a battalion there that consisted mostly of American volunteers. Fr\u00e9mont and Stockton completed the conquest of the future 31st state.\n\nMeanwhile, General Stephen Watts Kearny entered California from the southeast with orders to establish a government. This led to a conflict of authority in which Fr\u00e9mont involved himself after accepting California\u2019s capitulation from Mexican officials at Cahuenga Pass, near Los Angeles. Stockton had appointed Fr\u00e9mont military governor of California, but Kearny would not recognize the appointment. Fr\u00e9mont nonetheless served as governor for two months, at which time Kearny had him arrested after having received confirmation of his own authority. Fr\u00e9mont was returned to Washington, D.C., and, in 1847\u201348, court-martialed for mutiny, disobedience, and conduct prejudicial to military discipline. He was sentenced to dismissal from the army. Although his penalty was set aside by President James K. Polk, Fr\u00e9mont, bitter about the ordeal, resigned from the army. Through it all he retained the high regard of the general public.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

After rich ore veins were found on his land, he became a multimillionaire. In 1850, following California\u2019s admittance to the union, he was elected one of the state\u2019s first two senators. A firm opponent of slavery, he lost a reelection bid in 1851 to a pro-slavery candidate. However, his popularity in helping to secure California for the country and the publicity generated by yet another expedition\u2014to Utah Territory in 1853\u201354\u2014led to him being nominated for the presidency in 1856 by the new Republican Party. In the election he was defeated by the Democratic candidate, James Buchanan, but came closer to uniting the electorate of the North and West against the South than had any previous candidate.\n\nFr\u00e9mont was appointed a major general of Union troops in Missouri after the American Civil War began, but he proved to be an ineffective leader. Further, in August 1861 he ordered the confiscation of the property of Missourians in rebellion as well as the emancipation of the state\u2019s slaves. President Abraham Lincoln, believing those actions to be premature and fearing that they would alienate border states, relieved Fr\u00e9mont of his command shortly thereafter. The next year Fr\u00e9mont was given leadership of another army\u2014this time in the Appalachian region\u2014but he proved ineffective against the rapid maneuvers of his opponent, the Confederate general Thomas (\u201cStonewall\u201d) Jackson. After losing command of his army to a rival, John Pope, Fr\u00e9mont again angrily resigned from the military. He was still popular enough to be considered for the presidential nomination again in 1864 by the radical wing of the Republican Party. He withdrew his candidacy, however, to avoid dividing the party, since that probably would have resulted in the defeat of Lincoln. Thereafter he retired from public life to devote himself to railroad projects in the West. In 1878, after losing his fortune, he was appointed governor of the Arizona Territory, where he served until 1883."}, {"url": "https://chinafocus.ucsd.edu/2022/01/28/centralization-of-environmental-protection-institutions-in-the-xi-administration-a-deep-dive-into-chinese-policy-documents/", "page_content": "As the largest greenhouse gas emitter, China\u2019s decarbonization endeavor dictates the climate goal of the world. Fortunately, the high-level officials of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have been showing sincere support for the global decarbonization initiative: Xi announced China\u2019s 2030 carbon peaking and 2060 carbon neutrality goal in an address to the UN General Assembly in September of 2019. However, the political will from the top leaders has to tread through an institutional setup plagued by fragmentation and conflicting interests, two of the leading legacy issues spawned from decentralization in the reform era. Addressing these obstacles, Xi has orchestrated a series of centralization campaigns that enhanced China\u2019s state capacity under the pretext of combating climate change. Regardless of the true motivation behind these campaigns, it is crucial that the reader understands the evolution of these institutions governing China\u2019s climate change effort, not least because of their pivotal mediating roles in translating central climate change decrees to local actions \u2013 the institutional evolution is also a good case in point to illustrate a broader social and political tectonic shift unfolding in China right now: the drastic increase in state power percolate deep into society, transforming China at a rate unseen since the reform era.\n\nCentral-level decrees are often met with quiet yet insidious opposition from the local-level officials, whose political survival logic differs from the central-level leaders; the fragmented and weak Environment Protection Administration (EPA) aggravated this division. Xi gradually installed new monitors and punitive mechanisms that strengthened the relative position of the central government: vertical management of monitor, supervision, and enforcement (\u76d1\u6d4b\u76d1\u5bdf\u6267\u6cd5\u5782\u76f4\u7ba1\u7406\u5236\u5ea6), as well as the central ecological and environmental protection inspection(\u751f\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4fdd\u62a4\u7763\u5bdf). These new institutions retracted the supervisory and decision-making power back to the top.\n\nPast Institutional Shortcomings: Bureaucratic Fragmentation\n\nBefore the institutional reform, the regulatory power of environmental protection was scattered around multiple ministries under the state council, and this dispersion of authority hindered any appreciable reform on environmental protection norms. The Environmental Protection Law of 1989 established the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) as a ministry under the state council, and the EPA oversees all affairs of environmental protection. However, the law also qualifies its power by allocating authorities to \u201cnational ocean administrative and managerial departments, port authorities, fishing affairs, fishing management, army environmental protection department, public security, transportation, railroad system, and civilian flight management department.\u201d More importantly, the environmental protection law further diminishes the authority vested in EPA by assigning regulatory power to \u201ccounty-level land use, mining, forestry, agricultural, and water management departments.\u201d Most, if not all of EPA\u2019s jurisdiction overlaps with other local-level departments\u2019 domains.\n\nThe local pollution statistics, a crucial determinant of cadre evaluation and selection, can be easily manipulated by local officials. A lack of wherewithal partially causes the collusive data collection process, but the intentional self-interested manipulation of data is also a prevalent issue. For the most part, the monitoring departments are under the control of the local governments. To modify these statistics, the local officials can blatantly lie about the statistics or underhandedly tweak the methodology and baselines to massage the data into desirable outcomes. As a result, the environmental protection indicators on the performance scorecards are positively biased towards local officials\u2019 favor.\n\nCentralizing Regulatory Power: Vertical Management and Supervisory Inspection\n\nWith the newly vested power, Xi speeded up the pace of implementing these institutional reforms. With the Guidelines for Reform on Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Vertical Management of Monitor, Supervision, and Enforcement (\u5173\u4e8e\u7701\u4ee5\u4e0b\u73af\u4fdd\u673a\u6784\u76d1\u6d4b\u76d1\u5bdf\u6267\u6cd5\u5782\u76f4\u7ba1\u7406\u5236\u5ea6\u6539\u9769\u8bd5\u70b9\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u89c1), Xi addressed many of the weaknesses that have been plaguing China\u2019s environmental protection institution. Vertical management refers to the enhancement of the connection between upper-level EPA and its lower-level subsidiaries: the head provincial level EPA, not the head of the local government, will now directly appoint the prefectural level head of EPA; the county-level EPA is now a direct subsidiary department within the prefecture-level EPA. These policies strengthened the vertical bond between EPAs, and thus the local EPAs are more independent from the influence of local governments.\n\nThe document also addressed data manipulation by mandating a centralized monitoring infrastructure network: the prefectural and county-level monitoring team now directly answers to the provincial level EPA cadres instead of the local government cadres to prevent data manipulation. This document proposed a solution to the institutional weaknesses caused by an imbalance of power. Yet, the actual implementation of this document did not come until later. For instance, in the case of Zhejiang, the provincial government implemented this three years later in 2019, and propagating down to the city level, Hangzhou implemented this document in 2020.\n\nTo address the assignment of responsibility, the General Office of the Central Standing Committee \u2014 the top organ of CCP and the loudspeaker for Xi\u2019s decree \u2014 administered Measures for the Accountability of Party and Government Leaders for Damage to the Ecological Environment (\u515a\u653f\u9886\u5bfc\u5e72\u90e8\u751f\u6001\u73af\u5883\u635f\u5bb3\u8d23\u4efb\u8ffd\u7a76\u529e\u6cd5), a document emphasizing on the severity and the collective responsibility between the party cadres and its state counterparts at the similar level. It highlights the priority of environmental protection and demarcates the responsibility shared by the head and cadre leader of the government and the party organization at the provincial and prefectural levels. The designer of this document is aware of the potential conflict between the cadre evaluation scorecard categories and draws the categorical red lines that cadre cannot surpass in the environmental protection category, regardless of the cost.\n\nTo further implement this new division of responsibility, Xi deployed ecological supervisory inspections teams. Specifically, Xi established the Ecological and Environmental Protection Supervisory Inspection Leading Group and assigned Han Zheng as the chair of the leading group. The teams collect local complaints and conduct independent inspections to ensure that the local cadres are conforming to central-level decrees on environmental protections.\n\nThe supervisory inspection task teams are now equipped with detailed delineation of responsibilities across the vertical and horizontal chain of local governments; their data are provided by a unified provincial-level data monitoring agency directly responsible to the central level EPA; and the supervisory inspection task force report directly to Han Zheng\u2019s team, who is at the top of CCP\u2019s pyramid.\n\nAs much as this process is centralized, the effects of these supervisory inspections are still tainted by government-business ties. A recent study looked at the effect of these supervisory inspections on air pollution curtailment. The research inspected heterogeneity in the positive effects of supervisory inspections on air pollution across provinces. Overall, in the short term, air pollution was reduced. However, the long-term effects decay quickly over time. In some cases, the pollution level recovers to the pre-inspection level only after a few months. Moreover, provinces with a large percentage of manufacturing sectors can see a more prominent effect, whereas cities with a higher share of high-tech and service sectors see minor effects in these supervisory inspections.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn a country as diverse as China, local and central cadre conflict of interest is a permanent theme of contention. However, as we observe, even after implementing such a comprehensive set of centralization policies, some of the weaknesses of the environmental protection institutions remain, only receding to a lesser degree. In addition to strengthening the vertical bond, the government should expand its horizontal scope to encourage public involvement. After all, when such participatory pathways exist, the concerned citizens could very well replace the role of the supervisory inspection task team \u2013 the ordinary people are the ones who suffer from environmental degradation. If the government could open the upward flow of information, the local government would have to answer to ordinary people\u2019s interests, whose rights are increasingly being looked after by the benevolent leader.\n\nImage Source: CGTN\n\nSubscribe to us to receive our China Focus Newsletters!"}, {"url": "http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/cameron_john_1820_1888_11F.html", "page_content": "CAMERON, JOHN (known as Cariboo Cameron; also known as John A. Cameron), prospector; b. 1 Sept. 1820 in Charlottenburg Township, Glengarry County, Upper Canada, son of Angus Cameron and Isabella McDougal; m. first 20 Feb. 1860 Margaret Sophia Groves; m. secondly 1 March 1865 Christina Adelaide Wood; d. 7 Nov. 1888 at Barkerville, B.C.\n\nJohn Cameron spent much of his early life in Glengarry County. In the 1850s he was in California, apparently as a prospector, but had returned to Glengarry by 1860. When gold was discovered that year in the Cariboo district of the British Columbia interior, Cameron decided to go there. He arrived at Victoria, Vancouver Island, in February 1862 with his wife and an infant daughter who died soon after. In Victoria, Cameron met Robert Stevenson, another native of Glengarry County, who backed him in his first venture in British Columbia, that of transporting supplies into the Cariboo gold district. Cameron was also a partner in a small company which in August staked a claim on Williams Creek in the Cariboo \u2013 the famous Cameron Claim.\n\nOn 22 Dec. 1862 the miners on the Cameron Claim \u201cstruck it very rich at 22 feet.\u201d The claim soon became one of the largest operations in the Cariboo district and its success made Cameron a wealthy man. But prior to the strike, on 23 October, Margaret Sophia Cameron had died of typhoid fever and Cameron was determined to take his wife\u2019s body back to Canada West for burial. On the last day of January 1863 Cameron and Stevenson, escorted for a time by other miners, set out on a gruelling 400-mile journey to Victoria, hauling Sophia\u2019s body on a toboggan. They reached Victoria on 7 March and the body was buried there in an alcohol-filled coffin, pending its removal to the east. Cameron then returned to Williams Creek where he spent the summer working his claim.\n\nIn October 1863 Cameron left the Cariboo and, taking the coffin with him, travelled by way of the Isthmus of Panama and New York, reaching Cornwall, Canada West, before the end of the year. In December he had the coffin reburied. In March 1865 Cameron married Christina Adelaide Wood of Osnabruck Township and in July he laid the cornerstone of his imposing new residence, Fairfield House, at Summerstown in Glengarry County. In this period of prosperity, Cameron\u2019s often rash behaviour, extravagance, and arrogance tended to foster hostile speculation on how he had obtained his fortune. This speculation included references to the first Mrs Cameron, and there was much gossip about the contents of the mysterious sealed coffin. It was even suggested that an appearance of death was contrived and that Cameron had actually sold his wife to an Indian chief for gold. In 1873, more than ten years after his first wife\u2019s death, Cameron could bear his tormentors no longer and had the coffin raised. The face of Mrs Cameron, almost perfectly preserved in the alcohol, was exposed to the scrutiny of the public.\n\nHis windfall melted away, Cameron returned to British Columbia in 1886 or 1887. He died a poor man at Barkerville, the scene of his gold-mining success, and was buried nearby in the cemetery at Camerontown, a village named after him.\n\nRoyce MacGillivray"}]}
