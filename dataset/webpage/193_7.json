The EVO class will help teams saving a lot of money on the engine and electronics R&D side, that usually strongly depends on the manufacturer involvement in the series. I don\u2019t think a private team can get to the level of the official ones, with the current WSBK rules, in terms of engine and electronic development, money invested and expertise.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe EVO class makes it all about rider, bike and team. Performance wise, as we could see at Portimao during our first test, there is not a lot of room for improvement on the engine and electronics, that means that most of the difference will be made by the work done on the chassis. On corner exit the full-WSBK machines are on a whole different level, but corner speed wise the gap is not that big.\u201d\n\nSylvain has already shown great speed, but how do you think he will deal with race starts \u2013 probably his Achille\u2019s heel \u2013 and the two (longer) races on the same day?\n\n\n\n\u201cI have seen worse about race starts (laughs), I mean it surely isn\u2019t his strong point, but I would say he gets 50% of race starts right. We need to work on this. On the other hand I\u2019m really confident about his race pace and consistency, because Sylvain has been training like a Superbike rider for at least a couple of years now. He is mentally focused and he trains really hard, thanks also to James (Toseland).\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0132987EN/sylvain-barrier:-champion-on-the-bmw-s-1000-rr", "page_content": "The French rider from the BMW Motorrad Italia GoldBet STK Team wins the 2012 FIM Superstock 1000 Cup.\n\nMagny-Cours, 7th October 2012. Another title win for the BMW S 1000 RR: French rider Sylvain Barrier was crowned champion at the season finale of the 2012 FIM Superstock 1000 Cup at Magny-Cours (FRA). For his BMW Motorrad Italia GoldBet STK Team it was the second title win in three years competing in the series, after the triumphant season with Ayrton Badovini (ITA) back in 2010.\n\nIn the season\u2019s ten races, 23-year old Sylvain celebrated four victories, which was more than any other rider. In total, the Frenchman rode his RR to six podium finishes and claimed seven pole positions. Over the course of the year, he also showed his spirit to never give up. He fought his way back to the top after a setback halfway through the season when he suffered a severe shoulder injury that put him a long way back in his title campaign. At the penultimate round two weeks ago at Portim\u00e3o (POR), Sylvain retook the lead by finishing the race in second. He arrived with an advantage of three points to his closest rival at the season finale on home soil. At the last race of the year he secured the title by claiming another podium and finishing second. The first to congratulate him straight after the finish line was his mentor, double Superbike world champion James Toseland (GBR).\n\n\u201cI still cannot believe I won the title,\u201d Sylvain enthused. \u201cThe hard work done with the team throughout the season has paid off and I want to thank the guys, my family, James, the Clinica Mobile and everyone who supported me during the year. It was a tough race, but I was feeling very comfortable on the bike from the warm-up. I rode very carefully on the first two laps because the rear tyre was not warmed up properly and also Eddi La Marra and Bryan Staring had already crashed. I tried to maintain the gap I had with the following riders and at the same I concentrated on making the tyres work properly and did not push to the limit. It's been a fabulous week-end and I am over the moon!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe result achieved today in the FIM Superstock 1000 Cup is amazing,\u201d said Andrea Buzzoni, General Manager BMW Motorrad Italia. \u201cWe built on our success from 2010 and won the title again thanks to a very high-level team, a rider of unquestionable talent \u2013 who was able to grow and mature even more \u2013 and a bike that proved once more to be the best not only in the worldwide market but also on track.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re extremely happy about Sylvain\u2019s Superstock 1000 Cup title win, especially if we consider the fact that three rounds ago we were 31 points behind in the standings,\u201d commented Serafino Foti, BMW Motorrad Italia GoldBet Superbike Team Sporting Director. \u201cThe credit for this achievement goes to all the people who supported us, to our sponsors, to BMW and especially to the team that has done an incredible job.

Having had no time to test before the first round at Aragon, the Frenchman was playing catch-up all weekend.\n\nHis prospects of a strong first showing aboard the new R1 weren't helped by a heavy spill on Saturday morning which required a subsequent hospital visit. Yet the 26-year old still managed a gritty eleventh place finish on Sunday while riding with several cracked ribs.\n\nBarrier spoke to Crash.net on Saturday evening at Aragon about his split with BMW, the potential for a Superbike return in 2016, and his new role as Michelin test rider.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nAfter losing your ride with BMW you've ended up back in the series you've won twice. Was it your first choice to return to the European Superstock 1000 class?\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nI was looking honestly everywhere. BSB, IDM, everywhere. But I wanted to stay in the paddock of Superbike. I call every team in the paddock but everything was taken. There was quite some people who wanted to have me. The thing is I don't want to wait for a rider to crash, get injured and take his ride. For me it's not really correct. I prefer to go back to where I was. I'm doing some development for Michelin for the MotoGP. I'm in the Italian series with the same team. They give me the chance to maybe come into Superbike next year. But they say I need to fight. If everything come easy it's not my way to do things.\n\nYamaha gave me the chance to come back. Now it's in my side to give everything to show them and show me what I'm able to do. Also if one day I have children I can tell them what we need to do. I don't want to sit on the sofa when I'm 50 years old and say, 'Oh, if I did this I could be world champion.' No, [I have to] give everything and after show my children how to do it and how to be a better person.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nAre you still upset with BMW's decision?\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nHonestly I think I can be a better person. When you stay for five years with the same team you don't feel lazy. You think, 'Ok, I'm here and everything is good.' But when this happens it gives you the feeling in the heart to battle. For sure this what they did was not the correct way to do things but it will help me to become a better person.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nDid you foresee the split with BMW?\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nFrom the beginning of the year I was always saying the two first races will be quite difficult because Phillip Island I don't really like the circuit. After Thailand I didn't know the circuit. The first race was a complete disaster. In the second race I begin to enjoy on the bike. I was enjoying the qualifying. In the race I didn't have the good feeling to really push. The bike was quite good and I need to over-push. I wasn't feeling the confidence to do it. I thought, 'take this race easy, then in Aragon battle.' The bike is good and I wanted to battle. The team said, 'See you in Aragon.'\n\nBut when we come back from Thailand they didn't call me to tell me that. They called my manager and they say this to him. I am going out with my manager's daughter. He called his daughter and asked, 'Is Sylvain not professional?' But everything was fine. We understand the [ex-BMW WSBK] manager Andrea Dosoli go away and a new one comes. Also they say from the car accident last year, when I was not in contract with BMW at this moment, that it was bad for the image of BMW. We come back and finish some races second and third. Ok, I maybe was not battling with [David] Salom but I was in front of him in many race. I don't know exactly what happened. Maybe [Ayrton] Badovini is Italian, it is BMW Italia. I don't blame anyone. Just the way they did it is not really professional. They do it all [behind] the back and this is not really nice after five years.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nYou stood by BMW when they didn't provide you with a Superbike after your first Superstock 1000 title. Does that make their decision more difficult to accept?\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nThe deal was you win the championship you go to Superbike [in 2012]. I win the championship and they take Davies and Melandri [for the 2013 season]. What is the plan? 'You go back to Superstock.' And after you will get a Superbike in a professional team. I was like perfect. I will do again. After two race or three race BMW take the decision to stop everything. I thought, 'For fuck sake!' I sign again for this for 'Evo'. We do 'Evo' and it was not what I expect. If this happen in your life it's for a reason. You need to take the best and try to grow up. It's what I do now. If I come back from now I will be much stronger and it will be much better for me.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nWhat are your first impressions of the new Yamaha R1?\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nIt's completely a new bike and we didn't make any tests before we come here. On Monday I was under contract with BMW. We make all this at the last minute. We need to learn to the bike. Yesterday was a good day but we make the lap time with the new tyres. We didn't do anything else. We just put the new tyres and then try to understand the handling of the bike. The lap time was coming easy. This means the potential of the bike is really high. The bike is standard. It's Stock from the shop. We have the suspension. The session is really good. This morning I go with the tyres from the day before. I do three laps and come back in but the last thing I use for the second practice yesterday. We changed the spring on the bike. When I changed direction in the middle of the corner then the front is straight away go away because the track is a little bit cold. We only have four tyres all weekend. So it's difficult to imagine all that.\n\nAlso I was a little bit too aggressive. It's the game. But from the first time we get on the bike after two days we have one second free on people that are doing this for three months. It's not really bad. It means the bike is quite easy to ride straight away. We just need to understand more the bike.\n\nNow she's [the bike] the boss. I'm like 'ok'. We need to find a couple of things and it will be fine. But we need a little bit more time. The family of Yamaha is really great. Everybody we eat in the same hospitality. Everyone talk to everyone. It's intense competition but it's quite natural. This is quite nice.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nThe chance to race Yamaha's R1 in the World Superbike series next year is a nice incentive...\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nSuperbike was something else. I'm rider official for Michelin to develop the MotoGP tyres. I work with them for many years and they really like the way I speak about the tyres. I'm quite easy to live with and to do all the things. I think I will make a really good job. I don't know where it will bring us but for sure it will be fun.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nThe depth of quality in this class has significantly increased this year. Do you feel it will be harder to regain your title?\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nI'm quite happy. Just one thing I think is, 'Why don't they fire me before?' I can make one or two test before this race and be much more stronger. Now I am quite limited but I need to take the race like a practice. This morning I was a little ambition more than talent, like Stoner said. I leaned over, get back the front, I said, 'Come back!' but it didn't listen. It was not good.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nYou suffered a fairly big fall on Saturday morning and were taken to hospital. What happened?\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nFor the crash I just lose the front and the bike come on me. We have the security here [on the handlebar] and my glove stay in. It brings me then the bike go up. It does a spin, it come on me and I was made to go to the hospital for checks. I have two ribs cracked. The shoulder is painful and the muscle [in the arm]. Honestly on the bike it's quite hard. But I can ride and this is a good thing."}, {"url": "https://www.crash.net/wsbk/news/196804/1/sstk-champion-barrier-to-make-wsbk-bow", "page_content": "By Christina Bulpett\n\nSylvain Barrier will make his World Superbike Championship debut at the season-ending Jerez round with BMW as a reward for winning back-to-back FIM Superstock 1000 Cups for the manufacturer.\n\nThe Frenchman had been tipped for a one-off outing with the BMW GoldBet team after becoming the first rider since James Ellison to pick up two consecutive Superstock 1000 titles one round early at Magny-Cours.\n\nA long-awaited debut for a rider that has dominated the Superstock 1000 class over the past two years, he is delighted to be getting his chance.\n\n\"This is really great news!

In 1995 he began rally driving, and in 1998, paired with codriver Daniel Elena of Monaco, he started racing in the French Citro\u00ebn Saxo Trophy Series, winning twice that season before taking the title the following year. In 2000 Loeb won the two-wheel-drive-class French gravel championship before capturing the Super 1600 class of the Junior WRC in 2001.\n\nBritannica Quiz Indianapolis 500 Quiz\n\nIn the 2002 season, Loeb\u2019s first as a WRC driver with the Citro\u00ebn Total World Rally Team, he was runner-up in his first race and won his second, the Rally of Germany. During his first full season, in 2003, he captured three events to finish just one point behind Petter Solberg of Norway. That served as the springboard to Loeb\u2019s preeminence in the sport. He won his first driver\u2019s championship in 2004 by tying the WRC season record with six victories, which enabled him to easily beat Solberg for the title. Loeb proved to be even more dominant the next season, posting 10 victories\u2014while also becoming the first driver to win six in a row\u2014and winning the title by 56 points to break a 25-year-old record.\n\nIn 2006 Loeb raced for the private team Citro\u00ebn Xsara WRC and broke the record of 26 career WRC victories set by Carlos Sainz of Spain, totaling eight more wins that season en route to a third consecutive drivers\u2019 title, despite missing the last four rounds of the championship because of a broken shoulder. Having made his debut at the famous Le Mans Grand Prix d\u2019Endurance just the previous year, the versatile Loeb earned a second-place finish in the event in 2006.

His method of transport was a miniature kart, the venue was the yard at his home in Heppenheim, a town in south-western Germany. Little Sebastian quickly mastered the machine and began lapping faster and faster, shrieking with glee and refusing to stop until he was exhausted. The source of little Seb's joy soon became a focal point of family life for the Vettels. Norbert, a carpenter by trade and in his spare time an enthusiastic karter and occasional hillclimber, and his wife Heike had three other children: older daughters Stefanie and Melanie, and a younger son Fabian. His family's support helped the would-be racer fulfil a destiny that would make the Vettel name a household word around the world.\n\nLearning and improving all the time, he graduated with flying colours into single-seaters. As a 17-year-old schoolboy he won an unprecedented 18 of 20 races to dominate the German Formula BMW championship. At 18 he distinguished himself testing a BMW Williams F1 car. At 19 he became a test driver for the BMW Sauber F1 team, underlining his commitment to the cause by moving to a village near the Swiss-based team's headquarters. His Formula One race debut came in the 2007 US Grand Prix at Indianapolis. There, deputising for the injured Robert Kubica, he qualified seventh and finished eighth, becoming the youngest driver to score a championship point. In mid-summer the teenager became a full-time driver with the Red Bull-sponsored Toro Rosso team, where at first it seemed he had come too far too fast. In the wet Japanese Grand Prix, when they were running second and third behind the safety car, he needlessly collided with Red Bull's Mark Webber, putting them both out of the race. Impetuous yes, but also resilient. A week later, in China, Vettel climbed from 17th on the grid to finish fourth. A full 2008 season with Toro Rosso included some uneven performances that were then overshadowed by a remarkable first ever victory for both Vettel and the smallest team on the grid. In Italy, on a superfast Monza track made treacherous by rain, the youngest ever polesitter made yet more history when he ran away with the race to become the youngest ever Grand Prix winner. By now Formula One fans were getting to know the boy racer and they liked what they saw. He was cheerful and funny and radiated an infectious enthusiasm. His sunny disposition was a reflection of the pure pleasure he got from his profession. 'Drive My Car' by The Beatles was his favourite song. He loved off-beat British humour, notably Monty Python, Mr Bean and Little Britain. He admitted he was afraid of mice, but nothing about Formula One racing worried him. Beneath the happy-go-lucky demeanour was fierce ambition and profound self-belief in his ability to win the championship sooner than later. In 2009 he was promoted to Red Bull Racing where he was teamed with the veteran Webber, a decade older and presumably wiser than the newcomer, though not faster as it turned out. Vettel's victory in the third race of season, in China, was Red Bull's first Formula One win. He dominated the last half of the season, winning three more races and finishing second to Jenson Button in the championship.\n\nHe made his kart racing debut at the age of seven and immediately began winning races and championships. One of his early trophies was presented by his idol Michael Schumacher, who befriended the awestruck boy, noting their similar backgrounds and encouraging him to follow his passion and reach for the top. But that would take more money than the Vettels could afford. The solution came in the form of sponsorship from Red Bull, whose talent-spotters decided Sebastian was worthy of inclusion in the energy drink maker's young driver training programme.\n\nBut the title bout between Vettel and Alonso was far from over and for the 27th time in history the championship was decided at the last race - this time in a Brazilian Grand Prix made chaotic by rain. Several times during the thrilling showdown the slippery pendulum of fate swung in favour of Alonso, who qualified seventh and eventually finished second. Vettel started fourth but his championship chances nosedived in the mayhem of a frantic first lap in which his RB8 was hit hard, sustaining permanent chassis damage and dropping to last place. Vettel responded to his misfortune with a masterful drive in an ailing car, finally emerging from the mist and spray to finish sixth and beat Alonso to the title by 3 points.\n\nThe longest ever season in 2010 was also one of the most closely contested. Ferrari, McLaren and Red Bull had the best cars and their drivers won all 19 races. Though former champions Alonso, Button and Hamilton, together with Webber, took turns leading the championship, Sebastian Vettel's frontrunning pace - he started from pole 10 times - kept him in the title hunt. While their team's policy of letting them fight it out on the track led to a strained relationship between Vettel and Webber, their combined results enabled Red Bull Racing to clinch a first constructors' championship at the penultimate race, in Brazil, where Vettel led from start to finish. In the grand finale at Abu Dhabi Vettel earned his fifth victory of the season with another flawless drive from pole. None of his rivals scored enough points to deprive Sebastian Vettel of the title he fully deserved. The 2010 world champion, aged 23 years and 133 days, was the youngest in the 61-year history of the sport. His 2011 title defence amounted to a season-long victory parade in which he seemed to keep winning for fun - beating all comers on all types of circuits and clinching his second consecutive championship with four races to go. Granted, the Red Bull Racing RB7 was the class of the field (and the team repeated as constructors' champion), but it was his commanding personal performance - 11 wins, six other podiums and a record 15 poles in 19 races - that made 24-year-old Sebastian Vettel the youngest double world champion. In 2012 Vettel triumphed over both adversity and formidable opposition that included five other champions: Alonso, Hamilton, Button, Raikkonen and Schumacher. In the 20-race season (the longest ever) made unpredictable by regulation changes, there were eight different winners from six teams. By mid-season Ferrari's hard-driving veteran Alonso (also pursuing a third drivers' title) had three victories (Vettel had one) and a substantial lead in the standings. Thereafter, taking full advantage of his steadily improving RB8 car, Vettel surged back into contention, scoring four race wins in a row plus three other podiums to lead the title race and help Red Bull Racing clinch its third successive team championship.\n\nSebastian Vettel proved he had come of age. The youngest triple champion\u2019s three driving titles ranked him equal with such illustrious names as Brabham, Stewart, Lauda, Piquet and Senna. As a student of the sport\u2019s history he was honoured to be in such company, though he remained humble about his achievements. As an essentially private person he steered clear of the celebrity culture in which he could easily have been the superstar he was fast becoming in his profession.\n\n\n\n\u201cOverwhelmed\u201d was the word Vettel used to sum up his feelings on the victory podium at the 2013 Indian Grand Prix where he clinched his fourth consecutive championship by virtue of overwhelming the opposition. The champion\u2019s feat came with his 10th victory (and his sixth in a row) in the 16th round of the 19-race season. As ever, \u2018Seb\u2019 profusely thanked his all-conquering Red Bull Racing team (which he led to a fourth consecutive constructors\u2019 championship), paying particular tribute to the RB9\u2019s brilliant designer Adrian Newey. Newey noted the young champion had matured into a nearly flawless driver and a peerless team leader. All Vettel\u2019s rivals praised him, including his team mate Mark Webber whom he had beaten in Malaysia despite team orders to let Webber win. Immediately following the post-race ceremonies the record-setting champion pitched in to help his team pack up the equipment for shipment to the next race. He went on to win the remaining three races of 2013, thus equalling Ascari\u2019s 60-year-old record of nine consecutive victories.\n\n\n\nVettel\u2019s fourth driving title (which equalled Prost\u2019s record) in as many years placed him in the select company of the two most successful champions Fangio and Schumacher, whose four-in-a-row achievements came when they were aged 45 and 32, respectively.\n\n\n\nSebastian Vettel did it when he was 26 years and 123 days old, giving him plenty of time to further rewrite the record books in which his name is already indelibly described.\n\n\n\nAll good things must come to an end, however, though seldom has a dominant driver\u2019s form dropped off so abruptly. In 2014 Sebastian Vettel failed to win a race and finished a dispirited fifth in the standings. Meanwhile his new Red Bull Racing team mate Daniel Ricciardo won three races, finished a superb third overall and led their team to become best of the rest behind Mercedes. Vettel\u2019s lacklustre results, attributed to problems adapting his driving style to the demands of the new technical regulations, threatened to diminish the four-time champion\u2019s exceptional achievements. However, among those who believed in the fallen star\u2019s personal theory that a drastic change of environment would hasten a return to his winning ways was Ferrari, a team in dire need of a new leader to inspire a recovery of lost form. For 2015 Sebastian Vettel replaced the departing Fernando Alonso at the Scuderia.\n\nThe new relationship worked wonders, with Vettel\u2019s inspirational leadership providing the impetus for a dramatic resurgence that resurrected the reputations of both the famous Italian team and its genial German driver. Demonstrating an impressive work ethic (worthy of Michael Schumacher) and a cheerful demeanour that uplifted morale, Vettel drove Ferrari onward and upward. In a 2015 season otherwise dominated by Mercedes, Sebastian Vettel\u2019s three race wins (among ten podium finishes) earned him third place among the drivers and led Ferrari to second place in the team standings.\n\nIn 2016 Vettel\u2019s failure to add to his tally of four championships and 42 victories left him frustrated, floundering and often furious. He did score seven podiums and finished fourth in the standings but his season featured inconsistent performances - from the driver, his car and his team. Vettel made driving mistakes, there were car failures, strategy blunders and arguments that led to inner turmoil at Ferrari.\n\nIn 2017 Sebastian Vettel was more of a force to be reckoned with. Winning five races and failing to score only twice, the four-time champion finished second overall to Lewis Hamilton. A resurgence by his Ferrari team saw him lead the standings in the early part of the season. Thereafter, the effort of intense mechanical upgrading to match Mercedes contributed to uneven performances by the Italian team and its German driver.\n\n\n\nVettel took the series of setbacks personally. Episodes of clumsy driving suggested an element of desperation. Temper tantrums reinforced a reputation that he was prone to petulance. In Baku, under safety car conditions, he deliberately banged into Hamilton\u2019s leading Mercedes and was penalised. Starting from pole in Singapore he helped trigger a first-lap accident that ended his race and others, a costly miscue that effectively sabotaged his championship chances.\n\n\n\nIn a 2018 season in which his Ferrari was often the better car, Sebastian Vettel again finished a troubled second best to his Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton. Vettel\u2019s strong start \u2013 he won the first two races, and led the standings until mid-season \u2013 flattered to deceive. There followed an all too familiar pattern of erratic performances by both driver and team, a loss of equilibrium in response to ever-increasing pressure from the ever-improving Hamilton-led Mercedes challenge. In the end, mindset mattered more than machinery at Ferrari.\n\nVettel crashed out of the lead in Germany, his home race, spun out of contention after unnecessary contact on several occasions, notably in Italy, Ferrari\u2019s home race. The sudden death of Ferrari chairman Sergio Marchionne had an adverse effect. The race team also made mistakes in judgement and strategy, lost ground in car development. Blunders multiplied, confidence deteriorated, panic set in, morale slumped.\n\nDespite this being Ferrari's best year statistically in a decade, Vettel's five wins, only one of them after the summer break, fell far short of expectations and he readily accepted his share of the blame. \"Looking back, I was not at the top of my game. It has been a quite difficult and exhausting year for me and the team. I don't think I need to change things upside down. But certainly I need to adjust and get stronger.\"\n\nBut his fifth Ferrari season was to prove even more challenging for the four-time champion, whose personal shortcomings that relegated him to fifth in the championship were overshadowed by the sensational debut of his talented and self-assured 22-year-old rookie team mate Charles Leclerc, who scored 10 podiums including two wins, set a record seven pole positions and finished fourth overall, 24 points ahead of the 32-year-old Vettel.\n\nVettel\u2019s inferior results \u2013 eight podium appearances including a single win and two pole positions \u2013 seemed to provoke elements of desperation in his driving. There were unforced errors and instances of red mist (a feeling of extreme anger that clouds one\u2019s judgement temporarily), notably in Brazil where a clumsy coming-together between the rival team mates put both scarlet cars out of the race.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that the famous Red Team, which on occasion had the fastest car, at times seemed somewhat below par operationally, making strategic decisions that undermined Ferrari\u2019s performance potential. To his credit Sebastian Vettel again shouldered his portion of responsibility. \u201cI have been around long enough and I\u2019m honest enough to admit that I should have done a better job.\u201d\n\nIn 2020 the 33-year-old German found his Ferrari SF1000 \u2013 which he nicknamed Lucilla \u2013 far less to his liking than did his ambitious, young Monegasque team mate Charles Leclerc, whose superior results and optimistic attitude led to him usurping Vettel\u2019s role as Ferrari\u2019s team leader. This harsh truth came near the start of season when the team advised Vettel his contract would not be renewed for 2021, when he would be replaced by rising Spanish star, 26-year-old Carlos Sainz (from McLaren).\n\nHis fall from grace after six seasons with the famous Italian team undoubtedly hurt the forsaken Vettel\u2019s pride. He became dispirited and there was evidence of desperation in his driving. Feelings of rejection, humiliation, frustration left him in a state of emotional turmoil that was not conducive to performing well at the pinnacle of motorsport.\n\nIt was little consolation that winless Ferrari endured their worst season in decades, finishing sixth in the team standings, while Vettel\u2019s 13th place among the drivers was five places lower than his team mate Leclerc.\n\nThough his self-belief surely suffered, there were still some firm believers in the four-time champion\u2019s ability to recover lost lustre. A substantial lifeline soon came his way in the form of a long-term contract beginning in 2021 with the newly-rebranded Aston Martin F1 Team (formerly Racing Point). This refinanced and highly ambitious squad, led by a presumably rejuvenated marquee driver, showed signs of impressive upward mobility.\n\nSebastian Vettel thought so: \u201cIt\u2019s a new adventure for me with a truly legendary car company. I have been impressed with the results this team has achieved so far, and I believe the future looks even brighter.\u201d\n\nSadly, the new adventure fell far short of his expectations. In each of his two years with Aston Martin he finished 12th in the driver standings. The team was a lowly seventh among the 10 constructors. While he comfortably out-paced his young team mate Lance Stroll, Sebastian Vettel\u2019s interest in prolonging his career waned progressively. Midway through the 2022 season the 35-year-old veteran announced he would retire from the sport at the end of the year.\n\n\u201cAt the front you only see what\u2019s at the front,\u201d Seb observed. \u201cAt the back you only see what\u2019s at the back.\u201d Now, after 15 years in F1, he didn\u2019t like what he saw for the future, though reflecting on his past would remain a source of pride. Always a knowledgeable fan of the sport, he knew his achievements would rank him among the greats. After 300 races, his 53 victories and four consecutive driving titles positioned him an impressive third behind superstars Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton.\n\nHe considered his close family life as his greatest achievement. His biggest win was his deep love for his wife and their children. He regarded the miracle of their children\u2019s birth and the unexpected passing of his father-in-law as reminders of the life and death facts facing humanity. He acknowledged he grew up in the sport, regretted that earlier in his career those examples of bad behaviour that had marked him as a sore loser. He was grateful to have matured and become a responsible adult, more self-aware and dedicated to improving himself as a person. He said he didn\u2019t dislike F1 but intended to replace it with wider ambitions.\n\nInspired by Lewis Hamilton\u2019s crusade, Seb chose to use his high profile to promote positive change in social justice, political and environmental issues. Wearing a headband over shoulder-length shaggy hair and an unkempt beard, he walked the walk and talked the talk. In Austria he worked with children to build a \u2018hotel\u2019 for bees. After the British Grand Prix he helped remove litter from grandstands. He held an all-women karting event Saudi Arabia, wore the gay Pride flag in Hungary, and threatened to boycott any race in Russia after that country invaded Ukraine. To lessen F1\u2019s energy dependency and cut costs he advocated schedule changes to reduce the excessive travel that caused the release of toxic emissions into the increasingly more fragile environment.\n\nHis peers admired Seb\u2019s high moral values and especially his kindness, a rare phenomenon among highly competitive racers. Noted hard man Max Verstappen spoke about his abiding memory of Vettel. After his heavy crash in 2021 at Silverstone Max was taken to hospital for observation. When he returned to the paddock late that night Seb was waiting for him. \u201cHe said to me \u2018Are you okay Max? How are you doing?\u2019 That just shows he\u2019s a super-nice, caring person, who is not just there for performance, but means well. I think it\u2019s really nice to remember him like that.\u201d\n\nOn the evening prior to his final F1 race all the drivers treated Seb to a farewell dinner, hosted by Lewis Hamilton. In the morning on the starting grid they arranged themselves in a respectful honour guard, saluting, clapping and cheering their departing compatriot.\n\nText - Gerald Donaldson"}]}
