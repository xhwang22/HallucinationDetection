{"John Reed Jr. traveled to the Soviet Union in 1921.": [{"url": "https://www.magellantv.com/articles/john-reeds-fast-life-journalist-activist-and-eyewitness-to-the-russian-revolution", "page_content": "The foremost young journalist of his era, John Reed\u2019s career spanned only eight years, from 1912 to 1920. In that time, he reported on landmark labor disputes in the United States and revolutions in Mexico and Russia. In doing so, the Harvard-educated Reed became intimately connected to the causes he covered, advocating for the rights of oppressed workers and speaking against America\u2019s involvement in World War I. His coverage of the Russian Revolution drew him to what he believed was the hope that Communism offered working people, an ideal he finally died for.\n\n\u25ca\n\nJohn Reed burned brightly for eight years, then burned out. Once America\u2019s most famous journalist, he died in Moscow in 1920, not quite 33 years old. His eyewitness account of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, Ten Days that Shook the World, remains the definitive telling of the turbulent founding of the Soviet Union. By the end, Reed had become a true believer more than a passionate observer, committing himself to what he saw as the promise of Russian Bolshevism to overthrow worldwide capitalism.\n\nWatch In the Turmoil of the Russian Revolution now on MagellanTV.\n\nExactly a century after his death, American society is confronted by new forms of the domestic disruptions that Reed reported on: mass demonstrations, labor struggles, and repressive law enforcement.\n\nObservers may be excused for believing that these fractures are built into the national fabric. But in the century following Reed\u2019s death, public and private American institutions have grown to respond, however imperfectly, to endemic problems of poverty, racism, violence, corruption, and censorship. And though great progress has been made, there is a long way still to go. Few pushed that early advance with their tireless work against injustice and inequity more than John Reed.\n\nOut of the West and Out-of-Place at Harvard\n\nReed was the son of a prominent Portland, Oregon civil engineer, and grandson of the man who owned the city\u2019s water and gas companies. He was sent to Harvard University, where he wrote sketches for the vaunted Hasty Pudding Club, contributed to the Harvard Lampoon, sang in the Glee Club, and headed the football cheerleading squad. Nevertheless, Reed felt very much the Western outsider, ill-at-ease with the social customs of his very wealthy, Eastern establishment classmates.\n\nHeightening the strain, Reed\u2019s father was suffering professional setbacks after leading an investigation into Portland\u2019s municipal corruption. Working closely with him on the case was the era\u2019s foremost investigative reporter, Lincoln Steffens, author of the landmark book The Shame of the Cities. (Steffens was one of the \u201cmuckraking journalists\u201d whom President Theodore Roosevelt had in mind when he coined the phrase.) The two became friends, and Steffens was only too happy to meet with and advise young \u201cJack\u201d Reed after his graduation from Harvard.\n\nProgressive campaigns against graft, bid-rigging, and election fraud in cities across the United States were launched around the turn of the century, and by 1910 had brought long overdue reforms to local governments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of school in 1910, Reed plunged into the life of New York City, leading a nearly round-the-clock existence in the radical and artistic circles of Greenwich Village. Between his Harvard connections and his curiosity about the lives of working people, Reed spent two years surveying the broad social landscape. He was as comfortable in exclusive artistic salons as he was in seamy waterfront dives. His experiences gradually resulted in a crusading passion for fairness and sympathy for workers condemned to poverty in the midst of the city\u2019s colossal corporate and private wealth.\n\nEarly Professional Success, Then A Crucial Readjustment\n\nReed was clearly a born writer who thought of himself as a poet. With Steffens\u2019 help, he soon found success contributing feature stories \u2013 everything from celebrity profiles to slice-of-life accounts of social inequity \u2013 to the leading magazines of the day: Collier\u2019s, the Century, the Metropolitan, and The Saturday Evening Post.\n\nReed was an early advocate for two young friends who went on to distinguished writing careers. The journalist Walter Lippmann founded the New Republic magazine and was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 1958. And the great dramatist Eugene O\u2019Neill won four Pulitzers and received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1936.\n\nBut after Reed\u2019s father died in 1912, his health and finances shattered in the wake of his stand against Portland\u2019s corrupt civic authority, young John became dissatisfied with his professional trajectory. In early 1913, he began contributing articles to The Masses, a vivid monthly magazine dedicated to socialist causes.\n\nJohn Reed at his desk, ca. 1914 (Image Credit: fronterad.com)\n\nReed was reporting on a textile workers\u2019 strike in Paterson, New Jersey, for The Masses when he was arrested while attempting to speak at a rally. Hoping to spread news of their demands (mainstream newspapers, beholden to clothing advertisers, sat on the story), Reed helped produce possibly the first entertainment event of its kind, one pitched to a specific social cause. Drawing on his experience with Harvard\u2019s theatrical Hasty Pudding Club, Reed put together a benefit pageant at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden that, using music and song, dramatically reenacted events from the strike.\n\nLater that year, he was in Mexico for the Metropolitan magazine, covering the ongoing revolution there. Reed spent four months with Pancho Villa's army as it successfully fought federal troops of the dictator Victoriano Huerta. His dispatches in sympathy with the landless peasants supporting Villa, and arguing against American intervention in favor of Huerta, were collected in his first book, Insurgent Mexico. Its 1914 publication solidified his status as America\u2019s leading journalist.\n\nIn 1914, Reed went to remote Ludlow, Colorado, where, on April 20, troops of the Colorado National Guard and agents working for John D. Rockefeller\u2019s mining company fired into a tent camp of striking miners, killing 20, including women and 12 children. In its immediate aftermath, fighting between troops and armed strikers left another 50 dead.\n\nReed interviewed witnesses, investigated conditions, and presented the strikers\u2019 demands that led to what was called the Ludlow Massacre. An eight-hour day, the right to live outside of company housing, and recognition of the miners\u2019 union seemed reasonable to an outraged public. A humiliated Rockefeller promptly agreed to needed reforms.\n\nRevolution in Russia, Infamy at Home\n\nWhen World War I erupted in August 1914, Reed departed for Italy, France, and Germany, where he reported on life in the trenches before America\u2019s entry in the war. By now, Reed\u2019s sympathies lay entirely with the soldiers on both sides of the horrible conflict, young working-class men conscripted to fight for kings, colonial empires, and industrialists. He was in the Balkans, on Russia\u2019s doorstep, when a rebellion among Russian troops led to the March 1917 abdication of Czar Nicholas II in favor of a socialist government.\n\nReturning to the U.S., Reed undertook a series of public talks strongly advocating against American involvement in the war. But the national mood had shifted. Reed was arrested for the crime of advising young men to refuse Army service, and The Masses, denied distribution by U.S. postal authorities, was forced to close. Dissent was outlawed in a shameful nadir for American civil liberties. In the space of a year Reed had gone from celebrity writer to national pariah.\n\nReed\u2019s short, intense life was the subject of Warren Beatty\u2019s sweeping historical drama, Reds, which was nominated for 12 Academy Awards, winning three, in 1981.\n\nIn late 1917, Reed and his wife, Louise Bryant \u2013 considered the first female war correspondent for her own work during the Great War \u2013 journeyed to St. Petersburg to cover the turmoil still dividing Russia in the wake of the Czar\u2019s abdication. The nation\u2019s legislative bodies, headquartered in the city, were split among constitutional royalist, republican, and socialist parties, the latter ranging from center-left Mensheviks to radical Bolsheviks.\n\nOver the course of five frantic months, Bryant and Reed, who spoke rudimentary Russian, covered the fierce legislative debates, political rallies, strikes, demonstrations, and battles that erupted as the fragile government of the Menshevik socialist Alexander Kerensky staggered under cascading social and military failures. Racing around the city and countryside at all hours, and at occasional risk to their lives, Reed and Bryant interviewed people on all sides of the crisis, from ministers and politicians to transit workers and peasant soldiers.\n\nSoldiers of Kerensky\u2019s provisional government in St. Petersberg\u2019s Palace Square, 1917. (Image Credit: wikipedia)\n\nKerensky was in the field with the Army command when the Bolsheviks, supported by rebel brigades demanding long-promised land reform and an end to Russia\u2019s disastrous involvement in the war, swept to power in St. Petersburg\u2019s raucous legislative Duma. Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky now led a government that immediately nationalized factories, abolished private land rights, and instituted a peace treaty with Germany.\n\nReed, recognized by Lenin and Trotsky as a celebrity reporter representing American socialists, was captivated by what he saw as a new hope for the working people of the world. Along with his notebooks, Reed collected a trove of documents \u2013 posters, flyers, manifestoes, and newspapers that he brought back to the United States in April 1918 \u2013 all of which was confiscated by federal agents who arrested Reed on charges of sedition after his ship docked in New York.\n\nReed Creates a Classic of Journalism\n\nFortunately for Reed, his mentor Lincoln Steffens used his Washington influence to have his prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s material returned six months later. With it now in hand, Reed worked around the clock for three weeks to write Ten Days That Shook the World.\n\nThe marathon effort, combined with the stress of his federal indictment, broke Reed\u2019s already fragile health. And though a jury eventually found him not guilty of sedition by virtue of his right to freedom of speech, his career as a journalist was effectively over. Reed now worked full-time speaking and writing in support of the Communist Party of America, an organization he helped form.\n\nIn late 1919, Reed slipped out of the U.S. under an assumed name and forged passport, traveling to Moscow to gain official recognition for his political party (one of several claiming the Communist title) and to report on social conditions.\n\nBy then, there were indications that the Soviet regime was as oppressive as the autocratic system it replaced. Ten Days That Shook the World had reported the Bolsheviks\u2019 suspension of a free press, as well as Trotsky\u2019s explicit threats of violence toward political opponents. At the time, though, Reed considered them necessary measures a fledgling popular government had to take against fierce enemies.\n\nIn August 1920, party officials compelled Reed to make an exhausting trip to a Comintern conference in Baku, Azerbaijan. On his return, he confessed to Bryant, who had joined him in Moscow, his dismay with the casual corruption he witnessed on the journey. But it was too late for him to further investigate this subversion of the revolutionary ideal. A case of pneumonia led to a fatal bout of typhus. Reed died in a Moscow hospital, Bryant at his side. He was granted the Soviet honor of interment in the Kremlin wall, a memorial for Russian heroes.\n\nReed worked in a world at war, in the midst of unprecedented social unrest and violent revolutions, and brought to his reporting an equal force for change. If it seems he lost his way in an idealistic pursuit of justice, keep in mind that he died very young. There\u2019s no telling what else he might have accomplished, where he would have gone, or how his views may have evolved in the ensuing years. Certainly, many of his American socialist contemporaries reacted with horror to Soviet atrocities in the decades to come. Whatever his path, we may assume that Reed would not have lost his passionate regard for truth, or his commitment to the well-being of the working people of the world.\n\n\u03a9\n\nTitle Image: A parade of striking soldiers in St. Petersberg, 1917.

The globetrotting journalist had traveled to Russia with his feminist wife Louise Bryant as soon as news of impending revolution broke. It was 1917, and \u201cJack,\u201d as his friends knew him, had a front-row seat to the October Revolution.\n\nFamous for his vivid firsthand accounts of labor conflict and war, Reed was the perfect writer to tell the electrifying story of Lenin and the Bolsheviks seizing power. Ten Days that Shook the World, Reed\u2019s celebratory account of the Russian Revolution, is now hailed as an American classic. George Kennan of all people praised it as \u201ca reflection of blazing honesty and a purity of idealism.\u201d In a recent New York Times retrospective, Condoleezza Rice, no Bolshevik, writes that Ten Days \u201cprovided a riveting and vivid \u2014 if not impartial \u2014 account of the most pivotal phase of the revolution, as viewed from the ground.\u201d\n\nBut Reed\u2019s \u201cslice of intensified history,\u201d as he called it, had trouble finding an audience at first. \u201cHere by wide acknowledgement,\u201d a sympathetic Reed biographer wrote, \u201cwas a great American journalist, an eyewitness to the greatest story of the time, but not an editor outside the tiny radical press would give him an inch of space.\u201d\n\nOnly Max Eastman, who published the left-wing little magazine The Masses, was willing to assign Reed to cover the Russian Revolution. But while Reed was in Russia, the US government shut down The Masses. Reed and other writers had been editorializing against American entry into World War I, which it turns out was a violation of the 1917 Espionage Act. To make matters worse, upon Reed\u2019s homecoming in 1918 customs officials seized his trunk full of notes and materials on the revolution, delaying his book by several months. Eastman founded a new magazine, The Liberator, and published Reed\u2019s essays on the revolution, but only after preempting the censors by toning down Reed\u2019s incendiary rhetoric.\n\nIn the face of state suppression, the publishers and editors of the widely circulated papers that had previously published Reed\u2019s essays \u2014 American Magazine, Collier\u2019s, Saturday Evening Post, Metropolitan Magazine \u2014 stayed silent. Whereas Ten Days earned Reed burial at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, one of only two Americans to receive that honor \u2014 the famous Wobbly Big Bill Haywood is the other \u2014 Reed\u2019s adoring take on the Russian Revolution also merited him the scorn of the American publishing world. Reed\u2019s glowing evaluation of the \u201cgreat Lenin,\u201d \u201cloved and revered as perhaps few leaders in history have been,\u201d was held in high contempt by a liberal intellectual culture that had once embraced the daring reporter.\n\nNothing in Reed\u2019s early biography suggested he would become a renowned radical. Born into a wealthy Oregon family, he attended a posh East Coast prep school before making his way to Harvard, where he discovered his talents as a writer. After college Reed sought out bohemia among the intellectuals and artists of Greenwich Village. His early New York essays, observations of his extensive wanderings through teeming immigrant neighborhoods, exhibited a cosmopolitan sensibility. But they were also expressed in the rather apolitical idiom of romanticism. Reed\u2019s work took a more political turn when he began writing for The Masses, which mixed aesthetic experimentalism with Marxism.\n\nReed\u2019s political transformation was further ignited by his experience covering the 1913 silk strike in Patterson, New Jersey. Outraged by the weavers\u2019 meager wages, poor working conditions, long workdays, and the brutal treatment they received at the hands of the police, Reed joined their picket line and was promptly thrown in jail for four days. While behind bars he became engrossed by the life stories told by the striking silk workers, engendering a sympathy for the working class that remained steadfast the rest of his life. Reed proceeded to dramatize the strike in a pageant that he produced at Madison Square Garden, a fascinating story told in Jeremy McCarter\u2019s entertaining book, American Radicals: In the War for American Ideals (which includes profiles of Reed, Eastman, Walter Lippmann, Alice Paul, Randolph Bourne).\n\nIn establishing a reputation as a first-rate reporter fearlessly willing to go wherever a good story took him, Metropolitan Magazine sent the twenty-six-year-old Reed on assignment to cover the Mexican Revolution in 1914. He mailed home remarkable stories of his four months eating, drinking, sleeping, traveling, and fighting alongside Pancho Villa\u2019s guerrilla peasants. Even as Reed\u2019s Mexico essays were exquisite in detail, they lacked the sophisticated geopolitical awareness of his later writings about World War I and the Russian Revolution. And yet he had learned something. Upon his return, Reed advised against American intervention in the Mexican Revolution, and castigated his fellow journalists for depicting Villa as a villain. What Reed had seen in Mexico with his own eyes contradicted what reporters were writing from the safety of their Manhattan salons.\n\nReed noticed a similar gap between what the press wrote and what he witnessed while reporting on the miners\u2019 strike in Ludlow, Colorado, where two dozen mostly women and children were massacred. This rift pushed Reed to conduct research that would allow him to make broader connections between the state repression of impoverished immigrant workers and their families, and the larger political economy of mining. In the words of a biographer, his Ludlow efforts \u201cmarked his growth as a class-conscious writer not easily satisfied with recording his impressions but who must dig deeper into the play of forces behind them.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of his Mexico and Colorado reporting, Reed had achieved a degree of infamy among polite society. In 1914, Walter Lippmann wrote a sneering New Republic profile of his former Harvard classmate, titled \u201cLegendary John Reed.\u201d In Lippmann\u2019s estimation, the only higher principle Reed stood for was the right to an adventure, and upsetting bourgeois norms was the grandest of all escapades. \u201cReed is one of the intractables, to whom the organized monotony and virtue of our civilization are unbearable,\u201d Lippmann wrote. \u201cYou would have to destroy him to make him fit.\u201d\n\nReed\u2019s reporting on World War I failed to put his critics at ease. From the outset of the Great War, Reed was skeptical of all sides in what he called a \u201ctraders\u2019 war.\u201d Lippmann disgusted him in particular for touting the war in idealist terms. From the ghastly killing fields that Reed beheld with his own eyes, such posturing was a sick joke. His antiwar stance, which became even more pronounced when Woodrow Wilson broke his campaign promise to keep the United States out of the war, damaged his career prospects. So too did his budding communist activism. Such heresies preconditioned the press to deny him a platform to tell the story of the Russian Revolution. And yet, after seeing his remarkable essays in The Liberator, the intrepid publishing house Boni & Liveright published and aggressively marketed Ten Days that Shook the World. Moreover, being cut off from most of the rest of liberal intellectual culture freed Reed to write Ten Days his own way, which allowed for the book\u2019s timeless feel.\n\nI recently re-read Ten Days alongside China Mi\u00e9ville\u2019s sublime new book, October: The Story of the Russian Revolution. Despite the fact that Mi\u00e9ville has the benefit of 100 years of historiographical hindsight, and despite the fact that Mi\u00e9ville\u2019s book narrates the period between the February and October Revolutions \u2014 as opposed to Ten Days which focuses on the few weeks leading up to the Bolsheviks taking power \u2014 Reed\u2019s masterpiece holds up extremely well by comparison. In fact, Mi\u00e9ville uses Ten Days as one of his most telling primary sources.\n\nTen Days is not an impartial account of the Russian Revolution. Condoleezza Rice is right about that. In the preface, Reed wrote that his book is the story of how \u201cone hundred and sixty million of the world\u2019s most oppressed peoples suddenly achieved liberty.\u201d Nothing neutral there. But Reed\u2019s position on the revolution did not render his account untrue. \u201cIn the struggle my sympathies were not neutral,\u201d Reed admitted. \u201cBut in telling the story of those great days I have tried to see events with the eye of a conscientious reporter, interested in setting down the truth.\u201d\n\nTen Days is splendid precisely because of Reed\u2019s developed sense of class consciousness. Reed wrote, in the midst of describing the extremely tense situation prior to the revolution, that \u201cto Americans it is incredible that the class war should develop to such a fever pitch.\u201d But it was not incredible to him, a fact that allowed Reed to hear things that others might have missed. For instance, Reed heard an industrialist, frustrated that workers, soldiers, and peasants continued to agitate against the bourgeois government that had been formed in the wake of the February Revolution, say, \u201cWinter was always Russia\u2019s best friend. Perhaps now it will rid us of Revolution.\u201d\n\nReed and his partner Bryant were everywhere in the pitched days of the revolution. With almost unlimited access granted to them by both the crumbling government of Alexander Kerensky and the rising Bolshevik movement led by Lenin and Trotsky, Reed bore witness to seemingly every momentous event. Either that, or his observations, recorded for posterity in Ten Days, have become some of the landmarks by which we remember the revolution.\n\nI give you two examples. First, Reed\u2019s riveting narrative of the Second Congress of the Soviets. This raucous meeting took place on the eve of the revolution and is infamous because the Mensheviks and other moderate left groups abandoned it. The Mensheviks wanted to keep the February coalition together and thus rejected the October revolution that had been brewing in the streets of Petrograd. The Bolsheviks wanted the Congress to support the second, radicalized revolution and, given that they had majority control that is exactly what happened, thus precipitating the Menshevik departure. In retrospect, this split is momentous because it made post-revolutionary peace more difficult to achieve \u2014 in fact the Mensheviks fought alongside the counterrevolutionaries in the civil war that followed the October Revolution.\n\nThus it has often been argued that the Bolshevik-Menshevik split set the stage for the disasters of one-party rule. Reed captured a Trotsky speech following the Menshevik walkout that has long served to indict the Bolsheviks for their antidemocratic tendencies in spite of the fact that the Mensheviks could just as easily have been blamed for not accepting the will of the Soviets (Mi\u00e9ville makes this latter argument). \u201cAll these so-called Socialist compromisers, these frightened Mensheviki,\u201d Trotsky spoke, \u201clet them go! They are just so much refuse which will be swept into the garbage-heap of history!\u201d\n\nAnother striking example: after the Bolsheviks captured the Winter Palace, thus spelling the doom of the Kerensky government, Reed and Bryant began making their way to the palace through the jubilant streets of Petrograd. Along the way they happened to arrive at a Bolshevik checkpoint simultaneously with a group of Mensheviks who were hoping to get into the palace to make one last, largely symbolic stand for the doomed provisional government. When the soldiers forbid them to pass, the Mensheviks threatened to push through and asked, \u201cwhat will you do to stop us?\u201d One of the soldiers said, \u201cWe will spank you!\u201d This interaction, recorded by Reed in Ten Days, has grown into a classic example of the contempt that the newly empowered rank-and-file held for their former leaders. It truly was a new day in Russia.\n\nI dare anyone to read Ten Days that Shook the World (or, for that matter, Mi\u00e9ville\u2019s October) and conclude that the Russian Revolution was perpetrated by a small conspiracy of committed communists, as so many Americans and others have long since believed. Millions of Russians had had enough with the war, the hunger, the endless humiliations that accompanied living in such a deeply unequal society. \u201cIt was against this background of a whole nation in ferment and disintegration that the pageant of the Rising of the Russian Masses unrolled.\u201d The rank-and-file \u2014 soldiers, workers, peasants \u2014 made the revolution. Lenin, Trotsky, and the other Bolshevik leaders merely had the temerity to step into the breach left by the failed provisional government.\n\nBut even as the revolution was people-powered \u2014 even as it was fueled by hunger and deprivation \u2014 it was about ideas! Ten Days makes this clear on multiple occasions. Everywhere Reed went he noticed that people were reading and talking politics, history, philosophy. \u201cFor months in Petrograd, and all over Russia, every street-corner was a public tribune.\u201d Revolutionary Russia was alive with big ideas.\n\nSome of these ideas were old, ideas first thought up by Marx and other western philosophers. But some ideas and words were new, too. As a doorman at a building taken over by the Petrograd Soviet told Reed: \u201cI don\u2019t know what is becoming of poor Russia. All these Mensheviki and Bolsheviki \u2026 This Ukraine and this Finland and this German imperialists and this English imperialists. I am forty-five years old, and in all my life I have never heard so many words as in this place \u2026\u201d\n\nTen Days that Shook the World continues to have a lot to teach us about the Russian Revolution that took place one hundred years ago. But the best part of the book \u2014 that which will continue to stand the test of time \u2014 is the unparalleled prose. A few examples are in order. To conclude the climactic chapter \u2014 which detailed the hours when the Bolsheviks came to power \u2014 Reed wrote:\n\nSo. Lenin and the Petrograd workers had decided on insurrection, the Petrograd Soviet had overthrown the Provisional Government, and thrust the coup d\u2019etat upon the Congress of Soviets. Now there was all great Russia to win \u2014 and then the world! Would Russia follow and rise? And the world \u2014 what of it? Would the peoples answer and rise, a red world-tide? Although it was six in the morning, night was yet heavy and chill. There was only a faint unearthly pallor stealing over the silent streets, dimming the watch-fires, the shadow of a terrible dawn grey \u2014 rising over Russia \u2026\n\nReed concluded Ten Days in equally memorable fashion:\n\nI suddenly realized that the devout Russian people no longer needed priests to pray them into heaven. On earth they were building a kingdom more bright than any heaven had to offer, and for which it was a glory to die \u2026\n\nThat closing line made Reed a prophet of sorts. Not for forecasting the course of the Soviet Union \u2014 on that he was enormously and tragically wrong. Rather, Reed seems to have anticipated that he would pay the ultimate price for his devotion to the Russian Revolution. After illegally returning to Russia in 1919 with sedition charges hanging over his head, and then after the US government prevented him from returning home to face those charges, Reed fell ill with typhus. Due to a blockade imposed by the Western nations waging war against the fledgling communist state, he was unable to receive proper medical treatment.\n\nReed died an untimely death in Moscow on October 17, 1920, five days shy of thirty-three."}, {"url": "https://www.rbth.com/history/329832-best-loved-americans-in-ussr", "page_content": "What do a little girl, a U.S. president, and a black human rights activist have in common?

John Reed (1887 - 1920)\n\nGetty Images Getty Images\n\nBeing buried near the Kremlin wall, next to Vladimir Lenin\u2019s Mausoleum, is a serious marker of a successful Soviet life (should we say afterlife?). The only American honored this way is John Reed, a Harvard-graduate journalist from New York, who dedicated his life to writing about revolution and war.\n\nAfter publishing numerous articles and essays on the revolution in Mexico and from the trenches of WWI, Reed traveled to Russia where he witnessed the October Revolution of 1917. That inspired him to write his best-seller \u2013 Ten Days That Shook the World. The book remains one of the main sources on the Russian revolution even though Reed, a socialist, was partisan in his work.\n\n\u201cNo matter what one thinks of Bolshevism, it is undeniable that the Russian Revolution is one of the great events of human history,\u201d Reed wrote . Lenin himself wrote an introduction for the book. Reed, who co-founded the Communist Party USA (CPUSA), was on another trip to his beloved Soviet Russia in 1920 when he fell sick and died of typhus.\n\n2. Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882 \u2013 1945)\n\nGetty Images Getty Images\n\nAn iconic political leader of the 20th-century who led the U.S. through the hardships of the Great Depression and WWII, Roosevelt established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1933, soon after his inauguration. It would be an exaggeration to assume that FDR sympathized with communism but as a president who put so much effort into defeating the Axis, Roosevelt sought stable relations with the powerful USSR amid serious opposition from his administration.\n\nThroughout the war, FDR closely worked with Joseph Stalin and even bonded with the Soviet leader, unlike Winston Churchill, a hardcore anti-communist. Cooperating diplomatically while setting the ground for the United Nations, the two leaders had good relations which helped to destroy Nazism.\n\n\u201cThe Soviets would later mourn a safer world they believed Roosevelt would have created if he\u2019d lived. To them, he was a dear friend who passed away too soon,\u201d The Christian Science Monitor wrote observing a book on Stalin-FDR\u2019s relations. That is true: after Roosevelt died in 1945 the bilateral relations quickly deteriorated. The Soviets even named a street in the city of Yalta after Roosevelt.\n\n3. Angela Davis (born 1944)\n\nGetty Images Getty Images\n\nFrom 1969-1970, Angela Davis was the ideal American for the USSR to sympathize with: a young intellectual African-American communist oppressed by the authorities. Ousted from the University of California for her Marxist views, Davis faced imprisonment after she was caught in possession of a gun found at a crime scene when a member of the Black Panthers attacked a courtroom.\n\nThe public support for Davis, who never shot anyone herself, was huge: thousands of Americans rallied for her cause, while left-wing rockers, including John Lennon, wrote songs about her. The Soviet propaganda machine also fired up.\n\n\u201cThe young communist is acting bravely in front of the racist bourgeois trial!\u201dstated the Soviet television. Citizens signed dozens of petitions demanding to free Davis and protests raged in front of the American embassy. When the jury acquitted Davis, the USSR invited her to visit and treated like a real star. \u201cThey threw flowers to me, there was so much fun and joy around,\u201drecalls Davis. A 74-year-old academic now, she still remembers the warm welcome in the USSR.\n\n4. Samantha Smith (1972 - 1985)\n\nTASS TASS\n\nBy the early 1980s, both the U.S. and USSR were sick of the Cold War and prospects of it going nuclear, especially after ex-KGB chairman Yuri Andropov became head of the Soviet Union. Ten-year-old schoolgirl Samantha Smith from Maine asked her mom: \u201cIf everyone is so afraid of him, why don\u2019t they ask him if he is going to start a war?\u201d Her mother suggested to write Andropov a letter, which Samantha did.\n\n\u201cDear Mr. Andropov,\u201d wrote Samantha \u201cWhy do you want to conquer the world or at least our country? God made the world for us to share and take care of.\u201d She asked him if there was going to be a war and to write back.\n\nThe innocent sincerity of her letter was so touching that the Soviet authorities published it in the Pravda newspaper - and Andropov answered, thanking her for her letter and saying \u201cWe in the Soviet Union are trying to do everything so that there will not be a war on Earth.\u201d He also invited Samantha to visit the USSR, which she did in 1983. The media followed her every step as Samantha visited Artek, the main Soviet Pioneer camp, played with Soviet children, and said at the press conference that Soviet people were \u201cjust like us.\u201d\n\nThe little girl\u2019s bravery and frankness charmed the whole USSR. She became a symbol of hope and peace in the world tired of fear. Both the USSR and the U.S. mourned the tragedy in 1985, when she died in an airplane crash. Just five years later, the Cold War Samantha was so afraid came to an end.\n\nIf using any of Russia Beyond's content, partly or in full, always provide an active hyperlink to the original material."}, {"url": "https://www.rbth.com/arts/history/2017/06/28/laid-to-rest-in-the-kremlin-why-was-us-hack-john-reed-buried-in-moscow_791567", "page_content": "\"Here is a book which I should like to see published in millions of copies and translated into all languages\" - V. Lenin about John Reed's book.\n\nHow did the son of a wealthy American entrepreneur and Harvard graduate become an ardent supporter of the proletarian revolution in Russia?\n\nThe life of American journalist John Reed (1887 - 1920) was so extraordinary that he inspired film directors on both sides of the Atlantic during the Cold War.\n\nWarren Beatty's 1981 movie about Reed - Reds - won three Oscars. In the USSR, director Sergey Bondarchuk made a two part epic, Red Bells (1982), that was also based on Reed\u2019s life.\n\nSo why has the late hack\u2019s life fueled so much interest?\n\n'Civilizing \u2019 em with a Krag'\n\nReed was raised in an upper-class environment in the Pacific Northwest during the turn of the 20th century. He graduated from Harvard and showed interest in social issues, attending socialist club meetings. Three years after completing his studies he landed a job with the New York-based leftist magazine The Masses, which published articles by prominent radicals of the time.\n\nAs a determined champion of social justice, Reed covered strikes by silk mill workers in New Jersey and coal miners in Colorado. He was then sent to report on the Mexican revolution (1910 - 1920). He was appalled by the exploitation of laborers and Washington\u2019s policy towards Mexico. \"The United States Government is really headed toward the policy of \u2018civilizing 'em with a Krag\u2019 [a rifle used by American troops] - a process which consists in forcing upon alien races with alien temperaments our own Grand Democratic Institutions: I refer to Trust Government, Unemployment, and Wage Slavery,\" Reed wrote.\n\nHis series on Mexico, later published as a book titled Insurgent Mexico, enforced Reed's reputation as a war correspondent. When World War I broke out in Europe Reed traveled to the Continent on two occasions, resulting in his second book - The War in Eastern Europe.\n\n'New Russia was being born'\n\nHowever, his most famous work - Ten Days That Shook The World - was not about war, but rebellion. It was published in 1919 and described the events of the Russian revolution. Reed visited Russia in August 1917 and witnessed how the Bolsheviks seized power. He welcomed the uprising and was an enthusiastic supporter of the new socialist regime. \"So, with the crash of artillery, in the dark, with hatred, and fear, and reckless daring, new Russia was being born,\" he wrote.\n\nHe met the two main leaders of the Bolshevik uprising in person, Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky, and was a big fan of the Bolshevik party. \"Instead of being a destructive force, it seems to me that the Bolsheviki were the only party in Russia with a constructive program and the power to impose it on the country,\" Reed wrote in Ten Days That Shook The World.\n\nPraised by Lenin and Kennan\n\nIt\u2019s little wonder the book was well received by Lenin. \"Here is a book which I should like to see published in millions of copies and translated into all languages. It gives a truthful and most vivid exposition of the events so significant to the comprehension of what really is the Proletarian Revolution and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat,\" the Bolshevik leader wrote in the introduction of the 1922 edition.\n\nThe book was also widely praised by the public - even American diplomat George F. Kennan, who had no sympathy towards the Soviets - gave it a positive review: \"Reed\u2019s account of the events of that time rises above every other contemporary record for its literary power, its penetration, its command of detail.\"\n\nReed died in 1920 in Moscow after contracting spotted typhus at the tender age of 32. He was given a state funeral and buried at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. Remembered for both his brilliant writing and political activism, Reed was also instrumental in establishing the Communist Labor Party of America and took part in the Comintern congress in Moscow shortly before his death, an event advocating world communism. It\u2019s no wonder he\u2019s inspired film directors and writers - and he\u2019ll forever be praised as a bastion of social justice and journalistic integrity. He truly was a man of the people.\n\nIf using any of Russia Beyond's content, partly or in full, always provide an active hyperlink to the original material."}, {"url": "https://www.oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/biographies/john-reed-biography/", "page_content": "1887-1920\n\nFor John Silas \u201cJack\u201d Reed, the conservative, early twentieth-century city of Portland could never be \u201cprepared to understand his dreams\u201d of social revolution and change. Born in 1887, Reed grew up in a stately Portland mansion, attended the Portland Youth Academy and later, boarding school. Fascinated with the travels of his uncle and the unfamiliar habits of his family's Chinese servant Lee Sing, Reed's early writings were inspired by his desire to see the world.\n\nPraised for his poetry and writing skills, Reed graduated from Harvard in 1910 and began a career in journalism in New York. He wrote predominantly for leftist magazines and was celebrated among Greenwich Village radicals. Reed first gained prominence when he covered the 1911 Mexican revolution alongside revolutionary Pancho Villa. The event inspired his romanticized chronicle, Insurgent Mexico. In 1915, Reed toured Eastern Europe reporting on the atrocities and injustices of World War I. He became especially captivated with Russia and its potential for revolution, writing that Russians \u201care perhaps the most interesting human beings that exist.\u201d\n\nReturning home in December 1915, Reed was lonely and tired of war, but on a visit to Portland he met Louise Bryant. In Bryant, Reed found his intellectual match. They married in 1916 and, after living for a time in New York City and Massachusetts, departed for Russia in 1917 to witness the revolution. Reed's 1919 book Ten Days That Shook the World was an account of the Bolshevik seizure of power. In 1920, Reed traveled back to the U.S. to coordinate a domestic Communist party. Upon his return to Russia he was imprisoned and held in solitary confinement in Finland. Later released, a sickly Reed reunited with Bryant in Russia, but was tragically stricken with typhus.\n\nJohn Reed died in October 1920.

His father sold agricultural implements and insurance. Reed was a frail youngster and suffered with a kidney ailment. He attended Portland public schools and graduated from Harvard in 1910. Although he felt like an outsider, Reed had been active at the university.\n\nReed went to work for American Magazine, of muckraking fame, and The Masses, a radical publication. Journalists Ida Tarbell and Lincoln Steffens awakened his liberal feelings, but he soon bypassed them as a radical. In 1914 Metropolitan Magazine sent Reed to Mexico, where he boldly walked within the lines of Pancho Villa's army. Villa reportedly made Reed a staff officer and called the journalist \"brigadier general.\" Reed next gave sympathetic coverage to striking coal miners in Colorado. He went to Europe for Metropolitan Magazine when World War I broke out in 1914. He covered the battle fronts in Germany, Russia, Serbia, Romania, and Bulgaria.\n\nReed and his wife, Louise Bryant, were in Russia during the October Revolution. In reporting the Bolshevik effort to gain control, Reed won V. I. Lenin's friendship. Here Reed gathered materials for his most noted work, Ten Days That Shook the World (1919). It is generally recognized that the book lacks factual accuracy, but Bertram Wolfe (1960) contends that \"as literature Reed's book is the finest piece of eyewitness reporting the revolution produced.\"\n\nIn 1918 Reed was named Russian consul general at New York, a status never recognized by the United States. In 1919, after he had been expelled from the National Socialist Convention, he formed the Communist Labor party in the United States. He was arrested several times for incendiary speeches and finally, after printing articles in the Voice of Labor, was indicted for sedition. He fled to the Soviet Union on a forged passport. The thing usually unreported about Reed among the Muscovites was his unrelenting contention that decisions should be made democratically and his opposition to a monolithic society under dictatorial control. Twice he tried to return to the United States but was unsuccessful. Stricken by typhus, he died on Oct. 19, 1920, in Moscow. He was given a state funeral and buried in the Kremlin.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nBertram D. Wolfe's brilliant introduction to the 1960 Modern Library edition of Ten Days That Shook the World takes note of Reed's inconsistencies in the epic, which is more literary than historical. The best work on Reed is Granville Hicks, John Reed: The Making of a Revolutionary (1936). A portrait of Reed is in the anecdotal-historical collection of essays of Bertram D. Wolfe, Strange Communists I Have Known (1965).\n\nAdditional Sources\n\nBaskin, Alex, John Reed: the early years in Greenwich Village, New York: Archives of Social History, 1990.\n\nDuke, David C., John Reed, Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1987.\n\nHomberger, Eric, John Reed, Manchester; New York: Manchester University Press; New York: Distributed exclusively in the USA and Canada by St. Martin's Press, 1990.\n\nRosenstone, Robert A., Romantic revolutionary: a biography of John Reed, Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1990, 1975.\n\nTuck, Jim, Pancho Villa and John Reed: two faces of romantic revolution, Tucson, Ariz.: University of Arizona Press, 1984. \u25a1"}, {"url": "https://warwick.ac.uk/services/library/mrc/archives_online/digital/russia/visitors/", "page_content": "Our digital collection includes various reports, photographs and other documents which record visits of delegations and individuals to Russia and the Soviet Union in the decade following the Russian Revolution.

Equally rapid was his conversion to radical politics, and in 1913 he began to work for The Masses, a socialist monthly magazine that was probably the most progressive in the US at the time. He also became an ardent activist, defending the rights of striking workers and earning his first stint in prison in the process. He came to the public attention for his coverage of the Mexican Revolution, for which he spent four months with Pancho Villa's army.\n\nHe left for Europe soon after the outbreak of the First World War, but his support for international socialism and his hopes for revolution compromised him as a straight war correspondent. Firmly opposed to American involvement in the war, he soon found himself persona non grata in the press.\n\nIn August 1917, Reed and his wife, Louise Bryant, travelled to Russia to report on events in the fledgling republic. Drawn to the Bolsheviks, Reed witnessed the storming of the Winter Palace on 7 November 1917, and soon offered his services to the People's Commissariat of Foreign Affairs, translating decrees and news about the actions of the new government into English. He became close to many members of the new government, meeting both Trotsky and Lenin. He spoke at the Third Congress of Soviets, and was even proposed by Trotsky as Soviet Consul in New York. The suggestion was quashed by Lenin.\n\nNonetheless, when Reed returned to New York in April 1918, he was a passionate advocate for the new Bolshevik state, preaching against Allied Intervention, and seemingly hoping that revolutionary fervour would soon spread to the US. He was also in considerable trouble with the law. Thanks to his anti-war articles, The Masses had been indicted for sedition, and Reed was also repeatedly arrested for his activism. All his papers had been seized on his arrival in New York, so it was not until November 1918 that he was able to write and publish Ten Days that Shook the World. Despite the damage to his public reputation, the book was widely praised by critics and sold well.\n\nEmbroiled in court cases and political in-fighting on the American left, Reed returned to the Soviet Union in October 1919. During the winter, he traveled extensively through the Russian countryside, examining and noting the consequences of the Revolution. He then attended the second Comintern Congress, where he found himself increasingly disillusioned with the authoritarian attitude of the Soviet authorities. By this time he had little hope of returning to the US, and he was ordered by Grigory Zinoviev to travel to Baku for the Congress of the Peoples of the East.\n\nNow little more than a pawn in the Bolshevik machinery, he returned to Moscow to meet Bryant in September 1920, determined to return home. While in the south, however, he had contracted typhus and, with no medicine available due to the Allied blockade of the Soviet Union, he died on 17 October. He is the only foreigner to be buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.\n\nWorks: Ten Days that Shook the World (1919), Red Russia: The Triumph of the Bolsheviki (1919), The Structure of the Soviet State (1919), Daughter of the Revolution and Other Stories (1927), John Reed and the Russian Revolution: Uncollected Articles, Letters and Speeches on Russia, (1992), Shaking the World: John Reed's Revolutionary Journalism (1998)\n\nConnected with: Louise Bryant"}, {"url": "https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/goldman-john-reed-1887-1920/", "page_content": "John Reed, 1910. Library of Congress\n\n\"Even as an undergraduate he betrayed what many people believe to be the central passion of his life, an inordinate desire to be arrested.\" \u2014 Walter Lippman, 1914\n\nJohn Reed \u2014 writer, reporter, activist and playboy \u2014 was a legend even to his contemporaries. Born to a well-to-do Oregon family, a graduate of Harvard, and a steadfast socialist, Reed lived what many would call a terrifying life of his own making and desire.\n\nAdventurer\n\nIn the innocent, hopeful years before World War I, and scarcely out of Harvard, Reed embarked on a rebellious course that led him to befriend the Wobblies (Industrial Workers of the World), to write for Max Eastman's The Masses, to ride with the guerrilla forces of Pancho Villa, and to rush into the maw of the Russian Revolution just as the Bolsheviks brought an end to Czarist rule.\n\nBohemian Figure\n\nHe was a knight of American Bohemia, and a habitu\u00e9 of its capital, New York City's Greenwich Village. There he communed with an eclectic array of intellectuals, writers, and artists -- including Emma Goldman. His acquaintances advocated free speech and free love, and were committed to the cause of anarchism. One of them, the journalist Louise Bryant, became his wife and followed him to Russia twice -- once to write about the revolution as it continued to unfold, and once more to join her husband after his arrest and imprisonment. Reed and Bryant were determined \"to smash through the hull of custom and tradition,\" the editor Max Eastman observed, \"and touch at all times and over the earth the raw current of life.\"\n\nWar Protester\n\nWhen World War I broke out in Europe, it cast a pall over the generally pacifist \"lyrical Left.\" Reed wrote an article for The Masses entitled \"The Trader's War,\" criticizing the hypocritical mincing-machine of a war whose aim was profits through the sale of armaments. Three years later, at Emma Goldman's trial in June 1917 for obstructing the draft, Reed said the war was an \"overture to the blackest month for free men our generation has known. With hideous apathy the country has acquiesced in a regime of judicial tyranny, bureaucratic suppression and industrial barbarism. In America, law is merely the instrument for good or evil of the most powerful interest, and there are no Constitutional safeguards worth the powder to blow them to hell.\"\n\nWitness to Revolution\n\nReed's reporting of the Russian Revolution in 1917 brought him lasting fame. He arrived in Petrograd in time to witness the Bolshevik seizure of power in October. His now famous book, Ten Days That Shook the World was the first major account of the revolution to appear in America. \"From his typewriter,\" the historian Robert Rosenstone wrote, \"would flow hundreds of thousands of words about the origins and workings of Soviets, Kerensky and the Provisional Government, workers' control of factories, the state of the army, the character of the Russian people, Bolshevism, the personalities of Lenin, Trotsky, Lunacharsky and other leaders, the tangled web of foreign affairs, the meaning of counterrevolution, the implications of the revolution for the rest of the world.\" Reed's politics had always been passionately left-wing. They were now socialist in spirit, and communist in practice, meaning that his socialism responded to the Kremlin's dictates. From 1917 on, Reed's positions -- and those of other American left-wingers -- were always formed in dialogue, either for or against, with Moscow's Comintern (Communist International).\n\nTheory and Practice\n\nIn the fall of 1919, Reed made his last trip to Russia. After several months of observing how unstable Russia had become -- the government was now suppressing its citizens with summary executions -- Reed made plans to leave. The first leg of Reed's long journey home took him to the Astoria Hotel in Petrograd. Learning that Emma Goldman had just arrived in Russia after her deportation from the U.S., wrote Rosenstone, \"Jack burst into her room 'like a sudden ray of light.' Over a steaming cup of coffee, they celebrated a reunion.\" Almost immediately, Goldman brought up the uncomfortable topic of state power and demanded to know about the Cheka (the Bolshevik secret police). \"Reminded of all the old Russian revolutionists who had broken with the Bolsheviks, Jack blurted, 'You are a little confused by the Revolution in action because you have dealt with it only in theory.'\"\n\nUp Against the Revolution\n\nReed's causes often put him at mortal risk. Such was the case in Russia in 1919, as he passed through regions torn by civil war as he traveled home. He was arrested and imprisoned in Finland, just before the ship on which he stowed away was to sail to America. After his release, Reed returned to Petrograd to recover. In July 1919, he attended Comintern's Second Congress in Moscow. His militancy on the question of trade unionism alienated him from Russian leaders who had in mind consolidating their power over a populace that had to learn \"compromise\" and subjugation of individualist concerns.\n\nHero in Russia\n\nIn September 1919, at Reed's request, Louise Bryant traveled to Moscow to join her husband. She found him \"older and sadder.\" Their reunion was short-lived. Weak from prison and suffering from a long battle with kidney disease, Reed succumbed to typhus. He died on October 17, 1920, in a Moscow hospital with his Bryant by his side. He was thirty-three years old. John Reed was buried at the base of the Kremlin Wall, a Hero of the Revolution.\n\nImmortalized On Film\n\nIn 1981 actor and director Warren Beatty made a three-and-a-half-hour film based on Ten Days That Shook the World, using documentary interviews with Reed's surviving contemporaries as interludes in the film. Beatty himself played the character of John Reed, and Diane Keaton played Louise Bryant. Maureen Stapleton played Emma Goldman, winning an Oscar for her performance."}], "John Reed Jr. wrote The War in Eastern Europe in 1922.": [{"url": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_War_in_Eastern_Europe.html?id=anorrjRFIOsC", "page_content": "\u8a55\u8ad6\u672a\u7d93\u9a57\u8b49\uff0c\u4f46 Google \u6703\u67e5\u8b49\u4e26\u79fb\u9664\u906d\u6aa2\u8209\u7684\u4e0d\u5be6\u5167\u5bb9\n\nLibraryThing Review\n\n\u7528\u6236\u8a55\u8a9e - rocketjk - LibraryThing\n\nJournalist John Reed (most famous, I guess, for his book about the Russian Revolution, Ten Days that Shook the World, and for being played by Warren Beatty in the movie, Reds) traveled throughout ... \u95b1\u8b80\u8a55\u8ad6\u5168\u6587"}, {"url": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_War_in_Eastern_Europe.html?id=8YvIAAAAMAAJ", "page_content": "\u8a55\u8ad6\u672a\u7d93\u9a57\u8b49\uff0c\u4f46 Google \u6703\u67e5\u8b49\u4e26\u79fb\u9664\u906d\u6aa2\u8209\u7684\u4e0d\u5be6\u5167\u5bb9\n\nLibraryThing Review\n\n\u7528\u6236\u8a55\u8a9e - rocketjk - LibraryThing\n\nJournalist John Reed (most famous, I guess, for his book about the Russian Revolution, Ten Days that Shook the World, and for being played by Warren Beatty in the movie, Reds) traveled throughout ... \u95b1\u8b80\u8a55\u8ad6\u5168\u6587"}, {"url": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_War_in_Eastern_Europe.html?id=-eMXAAAAYAAJ", "page_content": "\u8a55\u8ad6\u672a\u7d93\u9a57\u8b49\uff0c\u4f46 Google \u6703\u67e5\u8b49\u4e26\u79fb\u9664\u906d\u6aa2\u8209\u7684\u4e0d\u5be6\u5167\u5bb9\n\nLibraryThing Review\n\n\u7528\u6236\u8a55\u8a9e - rocketjk - LibraryThing\n\nJournalist John Reed (most famous, I guess, for his book about the Russian Revolution, Ten Days that Shook the World, and for being played by Warren Beatty in the movie, Reds) traveled throughout ... \u95b1\u8b80\u8a55\u8ad6\u5168\u6587"}, {"url": "https://archive.org/details/warineasterneuro0000reed", "page_content": "192 pages : 20 cm\n\n\n\nThis highly personal account concentrates upon the national & racial character- istics of war-torn Eastern Europe in 1915.Reed has captured the spirit of the age,reminding us all how deep-seated are the ethnic conflicts in the Balkans\n\n\n\nPrevious edition: 1994\n\nNotes\n\ncut text close to gutter\n\nskewed on some pages\n\nAccess-restricted-item true Addeddate 2020-12-12 11:02:06 Boxid IA40015224 Camera Sony Alpha-A6300 (Control) Collection_set printdisabled External-identifier urn:oclc:record:1245900294\n\nurn:lcp:warineasterneuro0000reed:lcpdf:cd784103-90a6-49de-a353-a1860a57a2e6\n\nurn:lcp:warineasterneuro0000reed:epub:00a70e08-8c49-492a-ad1b-a850668380c8 Foldoutcount 0 Identifier warineasterneuro0000reed Identifier-ark ark:/13960/t8wb50482 Invoice 1652 Isbn 0753809265\n\n9780753809266 Ocr tesseract 4.1.1 Ocr_detected_lang en Ocr_detected_lang_conf 1.0000 Ocr_detected_script Latin Ocr_detected_script_conf 0.8760 Ocr_module_version 0.0.9 Ocr_parameters -l eng Old_pallet IA-NS-0000127 Openlibrary_edition OL7988179M Openlibrary_work OL827987W Page_number_confidence 89.62 Pages 214 Partner Innodata Pdf_module_version 0.0.20 Ppi 300 Rcs_key 24143 Republisher_date 20201212151237 Republisher_operator associate-mayel-franco@archive.org Republisher_time 990 Scandate 20201210183716 Scanner station23.cebu.archive.org Scanningcenter cebu Scribe3_search_catalog isbn Scribe3_search_id 9780753809266 Tts_version 4.2-initial-97-g35291955 Show More Show Less\n\nFull catalog record MARCXML"}, {"url": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/war-in-eastern-europe-john-reed/1100845066", "page_content": "\"...it seems to me that the most important thing to know about the war is how the different peoples live; their environment, tradition, and the revealing things they do and say.

After his graduation in 1910, he moved to Greenwich Village and joined the staff of the American Magazine as both a contributor and editor. It was during this time that Reed first became interested in social problems, and quickly became a radical. \u201cJohn Reed was so active in radical politics as to have too little time left for poetry,\u201d wrote Harriet Monroe in Poetry magazine, explaining why Reed\u2019s poetry career had never reached its full potential. \u201cKnowing himself for a poet, he hoped to prove his vocation by many poems worthy to endure; but life was so exciting, and the social struggle in these States and Mexico, in Finland, Russia\u2014everywhere\u2014so tempting to a fighting radical, that poetry had to wait for the leisure which\u2014alas!\u2014never came.\u201d In 1913, Reed joined the staff of The Masses, a periodical that reflected his political views. For The Masses, he wrote an account of the silk workers\u2019s strike in Paterson, New Jersey; during the writing of the article, he was arrested for his attempts to speak on behalf of the strikers. He went on to write a play about the strike, which he produced in Madison Square Garden, performed by the strikers themselves.\n\n\n\nIn 1914, Reed was hired as a war correspondent by Metropolitan magazine to cover the Mexican revolution. Reed followed Pancho Villa\u2019s army and lived among his soldiers for four months, traveling with them across the desert, sleeping on the ground, celebrating in looted haciendas, and being with them in battle. The resulting series of articles, republished in book form as Insurgent Mexico, attracted more critical attention and earned Reed the reputation \u201cthe American Kipling.\u201d Insurgent Mexico, divided into six sections, provides descriptions of the Desert War, the attack on Torre\u00f3n, rebel leader Pancho Villa, and an interview with Carranza, another leader of the rebellion. \u201cThe articles he sent back from the border were as hot as the Mexican desert,\u201d reported Walter Lippman, writing for the New Republic, \u201cand Villa\u2019s revolution, till then reported only as a nuisance, began to unfold itself into throngs of moving people in a gorgeous panorama of earth and sky.\u201d\n\n\n\nRobert Rosenstone, in his biography of Reed, Romantic Revolutionary, noted that the book\u2019s \u201cartistically arranged scenes have a balance, coherence and integrity that daily experience lacks. Skies often turn blood-red after battles, simple peons speak with uncanny folk wisdom, the narrator has sudden flashing insights into the symbolic meanings of complex events\u2014such things occur too often to be taken as a literal transcription of what Reed saw, heard and did.\u201d Granville Hicks, in his biography John Reed: The Making of a Revolutionary, said of this quality in the work, Reed \u201cwas indifferent to the accuracy of the historian, but he had the integrity of a poet.\u201d\n\n\n\nNot all critics were won over by Reed\u2019s narrative style. A reviewer for the Nation commented, \u201cThe book is a lurid exaggeration of some few aspects, and the frenzied manner of the whole composition aims not so much at depicting sober truths as at shocking the reader by disgusting naturalism in describing an irregular assortment of horrors such as were to be found nowhere else in the world at the time that Reed wrote.\u201d Critics in the late twentieth century, however, recognized the merits of Insurgent Mexico; a writer in History Today called it \u201ca classic indeed,\u201d and Richard Elman of the Nation claimed that the book was \u201cReed\u2019s finest writing, a book of such vividness, empathy and daring that much of what passes for personal journalism today does seem callow by comparison.\u201d\n\n\n\nReed himself described his travel to Mexico in his essay \u201cAlmost Thirty,\u201d printed in the New Republic. \u201cA terrible curiosity urged me on,\u201d he described. \u201cI felt I had to know how I would act under fire, how I would get along with these primitive folks at war. And I discovered that bullets are not very terrifying, that the fear of death is not such a great thing, and that the Mexicans are wonderfully congenial. . . . I loved them and I loved the life. I found myself again. I wrote better than I have ever written.\u201d\n\n\n\nReed returned from Mexico a popular figure, but his acclaim soon faded due to his opposition to World War I and his participation in the Socialist Party. Many magazines would no longer print his work, and his next book, The War in Eastern Europe, was called by Harry Henderson in the Massachusetts Review a \u201cdismal failure.\u201d The articles for this book were again commissioned by Metropolitan, and Reed traveled to Europe, behind both Allied and German lines. Because of Reed\u2019s socialist views, he was not granted the same insider\u2019s view as he had been in Mexico. Though he used the same form as he had for Insurgent Mexico, without his being able to identify with a specific cause, according to Henderson, \u201cReed becomes entirely disoriented as a narrator.\u201d Unable to recreate his earlier successes, Reed began co-writing and producing short plays for the Provincetown Players with Louise Bryant and Eugene O\u2019Neill. Bryant became his wife in 1917.\n\n\n\nIn August of 1917, Reed and Bryant sailed to Russia to cover the coming revolution. As a supporter of communism, Reed quickly sided with Vladimir Lenin and his supporters, and was an enthusiastic witness to the Bolshevik revolution in Petrograd. Reed alone among the foreign correspondents was given an insider\u2019s view and treated as a fellow to the cause. He kept a diary of his conversations with educated leaders and peasants alike. The book that recorded the events of the revolution, Ten Days that Shook the World, is, according to Henderson, \u201cthe great case in the history of eye-witness accounts of the right reporter being in the right place at the right time.\u201d Ten Days that Shook the World was \u201cthe first major account in America of the revolution\u2019s universal impact,\u201d according to John Stuart in his introduction to The Education of John Reed, and is often considered by critics the finest first-hand account of the Russian revolution.\n\n\n\nBertram D. Wolfe, in his book Strange Communists I Have Known, explained that Reed \u201ctried to see it all and put it all on paper. The dream of the Bolsheviks, the realities of their deeds, and the tension between the dream and reality are in his pages.\u201d Stuart praised Reed, declaring, \u201cWhat he wrote about the Russian Revolution in Ten Days that Shook the World, with its extraordinary weaving of significant detail into a triumphal theme, was a measure of the great leap forward he had made.\u201d But the reception of the book in America at the time was not positive. Even before its publication, Reed had not been allowed to return to the United States due to a sedition charge against him for articles he had written for The Masses. When he was finally allowed entrance into the country, he turned from journalism to politics, and organized the Communist Labor Party, one of the two rival communist parties in the United States. When Ten Days that Shook the World was published in 1919, Reed was indicted as a communist leader during the \u201cRed Scare\u201d after World War I, due to his radical stance and obvious support of communism. He fled the country, eventually returning to Russia where he died of typhus. Reed was buried, honored as a Soviet hero, under the Kremlin wall facing the Red Square, the only American and one of the few foreigners to receive such an honor."}, {"url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/War-Eastern-Europe-Travels-Through/dp/0753809265", "page_content": "Select Your Cookie Preferences\n\nWe use cookies and similar tools that are necessary to enable you to make purchases, to enhance your shopping experiences and to provide our services, as detailed in our Cookie Notice.

The War in Eastern Europe was written a couple of years earlier, based on his wanderings through the war-torn Balkans. It may have helped give him a better foundation to understand what was to happen shortly afterwards in Russia, a country that was also wracked by war and defeat.\n\n\n\nI read this book by journalist John Reed mainly because of Robert Kaplan's copious references to it in his excellent book Balkan Ghosts, which was written about 75 years later. Since Reed's book is about the First World War, and Kaplan's is about the prelude to the Yugoslav Civil War of the 1990's, one conclusion might be that little had changed in the region over the previous three quarters of a century. There's a lot of truth in that. Ethnically, religiously, culturally and geographically fragmented, with a long history of violent clashes between competing empires and nations, the south-eastern region of Europe -- the Balkans -- is blood-soaked even by the bloody standards of that continent.\n\n\n\nReed's book is almost that of a curious traveler and not so much that of a journalist. He has a telling eye for detail, loves political gossip, has an adventurous spirit and tells a good story, but he's not much of one for deep analysis of what was actually going on. This is curious, since he was a communist, and you would have expected him to look for deep underlying social forces. Instead, he leans far too heavily on sweeping ethnic prejudices -- Romanians are charming but shifty, Serbians are brave and open, Bulgarians are life-loving and welcoming, Jews are sinister, Turks are lazy, Greeks are sly, and so forth. In this, he was undoubtedly a product of his class, his times and his own national culture, to say nothing of his own personality, but it does make his explanations of events both dated and untrustworthy.\n\n\n\nThat said, Reed has some superb accounts of World War I in that part of the world. It's hard to grasp the scale of destruction and suffering and profound impoverishment across a vast sweep of the region -- in Romania, Serbia, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Turkey ... -- unless you read a first-hand account like Reed's. He was a man with acute powers of observation and deep reserves of compassion, whatever his other limitations. Having just visited much of the region myself, I found it fascinating to read his descriptions of the war in cities I recently visited, such as Belgrade, Sofia and Istanbul. If you're interested in the Balkans and its history, you'll find this book a good read."}, {"url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/War-Eastern-Europe-John-Reed/dp/110307279X", "page_content": "Select Your Cookie Preferences\n\nWe use cookies and similar tools that are necessary to enable you to make purchases, to enhance your shopping experiences and to provide our services, as detailed in our Cookie Notice.

Few of them possessed a complete uniform. Some were shod only in cowhide sandals. They were camped out in northern Durango, sleeping on the tiled floors of an hacienda whose wealthy owner had been expelled by revolutionary forces. But now the counterrevolutionary colorados were coming to kill them all. Reed, known to his friends back home as Jack and his friends here in Mexico as Juan, was twenty-six years old, boyish and spirited, quick-witted and usually self-possessed, though at this moment he was scared out of his mind. Bullets were already flying, sending mules and men scattering into the Chihuahuan Desert. The peasants of the hacienda took cover in their modest adobes and prayed. One soldier, face blackened with gunpowder, galloped past crying that all hope was lost. Reed escaped on foot with a small detachment. They fled down a narrow path through the chaparral, the colorados hot on their heels. The fourteen-year-old fighter at his side was trampled and shot. Reed tripped on a mesquite branch and tumbled into an arroyo, where he lay listening as the colorados argued about which way he\u2019d gone. He remained motionless as their voices faded, and eventually lost consciousness. When he woke, he could still hear gunfire near the Casa Grande \u2014 the sound, he later learned, of the colorados shooting corpses for good measure. He snuck down the arroyo away from the action, but was soon startled by a stranger in his path. The stranger had a bloody handkerchief wrapped around his head and carried a green serape over his arm. His legs were caked in blood from the espadas, the spiny cacti that covered the desert floor. Reed couldn\u2019t tell which side of the fighting he was on. The man beckoned, and Reed saw no choice but to follow him. They crested a hill and the stranger gestured to a dead horse, its stiff legs poking up in the air. Nearby lay the body of its rider, disemboweled. Reed turned to look at the man with the green serape, and saw that he was holding a dagger. The dead one was a colorado. Together they buried him, covering the shallow grave with rocks and fastening a cross out of mesquite branches. When they were finished, the man with the green serape pointed Reed to safety. The year before, Reed had been in Portland, Oregon, wandering the streets alone at night, lost in unhappy thought. He\u2019d come home for his father\u2019s funeral and to settle his family\u2019s financial affairs. Reed was descended from great wealth, but the fortune had mostly vanished. Gone, too, were the gaiety of Reed\u2019s Harvard days and the novelty of the bohemian writer\u2019s life in New York. Reed was adrift, uncertain what kind of life he would live, what kind of man he would become. Less than a decade later, Reed died in Russia, a Bolshevik, a traitor to his country and his class. His remains lie now at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in Moscow. His biography is immortalized in Warren Beatty\u2019s acclaimed 1981 epic film Reds. And while the film vividly depicted many of the important episodes from his colorful and storied life, with the exception of a brief shot of Beatty scrambling through the Chihuahuan Desert, it overlooked an important one: John Reed\u2019s time among the combatants, including Pancho Villa himself, during the Mexican Revolution. It was in Mexico that Reed not only indulged his taste for action and adventure but also witnessed the lows of degrading poverty, the highs of revolutionary hope, and the lengths the international capitalist class would go to in order to prevent egalitarian social transformation. The night before the siege on the hacienda, a proclamation from the governor of Durango was read aloud to the soldiers in their sleeping quarters. It said: Considering . . . that the rural classes have no means of subsistence in the present, nor any hope for the future, except to serve as peons on the haciendas of the great landowners, who have monopolized the soil of the state. . . . Considering . . . that the rural towns have been reduced to the deepest misery, because the common lands which they once owned have gone to augment the property of the hacienda, especially under the dictatorship of [President Porfirio] D\u00edaz, with which the inhabitants of the state lost their economic, political, and social independence, then passed from the rank of citizens to that of slaves, without the government being able to lift the moral level through education, because the hacienda where they lived is private property. . . . Therefore, the government of the state of Durango declares it a public necessity that the inhabitants of the towns and villages be the owners of agricultural lands. \u201cThat,\u201d one soldier said to Reed, \u201cis the Mexican Revolution.\u201d The next day, rather than flee, the soldier stayed at the Casa Grande, where he died trying to fend off the colorados in vain.\n\nThe Making of \u201cStorm Boy\u201d John Reed was born in 1887 in Portland, Oregon, which was then dominated by pioneer capitalists from the East. As lumber barons passed by in elegant carriages, the city\u2019s workers trudged down muddy avenues, hazardously strewn with stumps and felled trunks from the clear-cut forest, to perform grueling manual labor or to drink and gamble in the city\u2019s vice dens. The apparent moral laxity of Portland\u2019s working class was of great concern to the members of the Arlington Club, an exclusive institution founded twenty years earlier to promote social and professional solidarity among local elites. One of the Arlington Club\u2019s founders was Henry Green, John Reed\u2019s maternal grandfather who had come from upstate New York, where he had established a successful mercantile enterprise. Henry and his wife, Charlotte, became pillars of Portland high society. Their daughter, Margaret Green, married C. J. Reed, another ambitious young businessman from upstate New York, and they started their family at the Green estate. John Reed later described the house as a \u201clordly grey mansion\u201d surrounded by a dense forest of fir trees. His grandparents lived with \u201cRussian lavishness,\u201d their residence decorated ornately with elaborate textiles and exotic artifacts acquired in the course of their world travels. Though nestled in the emerald Willamette Valley, worlds away from the Chihuahuan Desert, the opulent estate had much in common with the haciendas whose expropriation was a principle aim of the Mexican Revolution. \u2018The more I met,\u2019 Reed wrote of his Harvard peers, \u2018the more their cold, cruel stupidity repelled me.\u2019 John Reed was not an especially happy child. A kidney condition kept him indoors more often than not. At first, he was confined to the Green estate, where he was looked after by Chinese servants who regaled him with mesmerizing tales of their distant homeland. Later, when the family moved off the estate, he kept himself company with books. He was timid around other children, once even paying a neighborhood bully a quarter not to beat him up. C. J. Reed\u2019s business had never been as successful as Henry Green\u2019s, and as Charlotte Green spent the remainder of her late husband\u2019s fortune, John\u2019s parents found themselves unable to replenish the well. They were hardly poor, but neither could they maintain their former lifestyle. Even so, C. J. put together the money to send his son to boarding school in Morristown, New Jersey, with the express intention of getting the boy into Harvard. In Morristown, John Reed flourished. He was finally in good physical health, and discovered that a certain reputation preceded him as a Westerner. The other boys, all preppy Northeastern blue bloods, expected a wild man from the rugged frontier. Having consumed a great many adventure novels throughout his isolated childhood, he was eager and able to play the part. Overnight, the once sullen child became a popular young man with a knack for playfully challenging authority. Somewhere along the way he picked up the nickname \u201cStorm Boy,\u201d evoking a roguish vitality and inclination to misbehave that were latent throughout his subdued and sheltered childhood. At Harvard, Reed developed a new awareness of and sharp distaste for excessive wealth. He was aghast to learn that some of his new classmates were given $15,000 a year allowance, close to $400,000 a year today. Reed\u2019s desire to be liked was overpowered by his irrepressible contempt for Harvard culture and custom. \u201cThe more I met,\u201d he wrote later of his Harvard peers, \u201cthe more their cold, cruel stupidity repelled me. I began to pity them for their lack of imagination and the narrowness of their glittering lives \u2014 clubs, athletics, society.\u201d Reed lampooned Harvard every chance he got, frequently pulling pranks that drew the ire of campus authorities. The college even revived an archaic form of punishment just for Reed, a type of mandated confinement. The writer and intellectual Walter Lippmann, who attended Harvard with Reed, wrote that he \u201ccame from Oregon, showed his feelings in public, and said what he thought to club men who didn\u2019t like to hear it. Even as an undergraduate he betrayed what many people believed to be the central passion of his life, an inordinate desire to be arrested.\u201d While he attended a few Socialist Club meetings, Reed\u2019s campaign to undermine Harvard\u2019s self-seriousness was animated more by his hatred of aristocratic convention than any political vision for a classless society. That changed after Reed graduated and moved to New York City to try his hand at writing, at first with little success. In search of suitable subject matter and a good time, he spent his evenings in disreputable establishments, the kind his grandfather\u2019s Arlington Club had disapproved of in Portland, chatting up patrons and following them out into the city to find out where and how they lived. One story that emerged from this process was a sincere and humanizing portrait of a prostitute Reed met out on the town. Editors across the city agreed it was excellent, but all found it too morally ambiguous to publish. When Reed was back in Portland, mourning the death of his father and brooding over the stagnation of his life in New York, he received word that a socialist magazine, The Masses, had agreed to publish his story. Thereafter, Reed wrote for The Masses, and his interests and perspective began to align with the mission of the publication. At a party thrown by the avant-garde artist and socialite Mabel Dodge Luhan, Reed met \u201cBig Bill\u201d Haywood, who had come to gather support from urban progressives for a textile workers\u2019 strike in Paterson, New Jersey. Reed followed Haywood to Paterson, and entered a new phase of his life altogether. Reed\u2019s experience there in New Jersey transformed him into two things at once: a journalist and a socialist. He not only covered the 1913 Paterson strike for The Masses but was famously jailed alongside the strikers, an experience he recounted colorfully and movingly in his reporting. Before long he had joined the International Workers of the World and was helping to organize strike solidarity efforts. At the same time, Reed proved himself to be a captivating writer and a reporter of unusual courage, one willing to get right in the middle of things instead of poking around the perimeter. When editors at the Metropolitan hired him to report on the Mexican Revolution, they did so because they suspected he\u2019d find his way to the center of the action like a moth to a flame. And they were right.\n\nLand and Freedom There were 15 million people living in Mexico at the beginning of the revolution. Over the course of the conflict, an estimated 1 million were killed, and roughly 2 million more migrated to the United States fleeing violence. John Reed could easily have lost his life, traveling as he did with embattled armies at the peak of unrest in 1913 and 1914. Instead, he survived and published a riveting book of reportage, Insurgent Mexico, that served as the prototype for Ten Days That Shook the World, his famed account of the Russian Revolution. His experience in Mexico cemented his status as a leading American journalist covering armed conflicts at home and abroad. It also introduced him to new depths of deprivation and exploitation, and impressed upon him the need for international socialism. The story of the Mexican Revolution begins with Porfirio D\u00edaz, who in the mid-nineteenth century had been a leader of the country\u2019s Liberal faction, proponents of democracy and free-market capitalism, as they battled with Conservatives, who preferred a more traditional hierarchical social arrangement steered by a monarch and the Catholic Church. D\u00edaz became president in 1876, and over time shed his liberal commitment to political democracy. The turn of the century came and went, and he was still in power. As dictator, D\u00edaz exerted tight control over Mexican politics while his domestic army of federales and countryside police force of rurales kept the Mexican people in line. But while he reneged on his political promises, D\u00edaz was firm in his commitment to capitalism. The Porfirian regime bent over backward to satisfy Mexico\u2019s wealthy landowners, the hacendados, as well as open up the country to foreign investors, particularly American but also British and French, who dug mines and oil wells and commandeered vast plantations. With D\u00edaz\u2019s support, the domestic and foreign business elite profited handsomely as rural subsistence farmers and small proprietors were dispossessed of their modest individual and collective holdings. Mexico\u2019s peasants were tethered in semifeudal fashion to the rural haciendas, or compelled to toil in hazardous conditions in fields and mines for low pay, often as precarious informal day laborers. Some indigenous people were even sold into slavery. There were 15 million people living in Mexico at the beginning of the revolution. Over the course of the conflict, an estimated 1 million were killed, and roughly 2 million more fled the country. A first challenge to the D\u00edaz dictatorship, led by the Flores Mag\u00f3n brothers, was crushed in 1906. But it left a lasting impression, binding together two demands in the minds of the Mexican people: political democracy, on the one hand, and, on the other, agricultural reform, specifically the end of the repressive hacienda system and the redistribution of the land itself to the people who worked it. The revolution to come would summarize these two demands with the slogan tierra y libertad \u2014 land and freedom. The revolution finally arrived when Francisco Madero, liberal son of a wealthy family that owned not only land and mines but also factories, mounted a bid for the presidency, a betrayal for which D\u00edaz had him arrested and imprisoned. The conflict was intra-elite at first: Madero represented an enterprising segment of the capitalist class, more modern than the old-school hacendados. But Madero\u2019s appeals for democracy had wide appeal. Makeshift armies of peasants and workers desperate for change rallied to his cause, spearheaded by a new generation of leaders who seemed to come out of the woodwork. Within a year, the D\u00edaz regime was finished and Madero was in power. But the revolution was far from over. Madero assumed the presidency but changed very little, keeping most administrative structures and even personnel in place. His attempts to appease disgruntled porfiristas met with little success, for there were right-wing rebellions anyway. Meanwhile, the left that had swept Madero to power was dismayed by his apparent disinterest in pursuing any kind of ambitious reform agenda. Emiliano Zapata, the commander of an army of peasants in the south of Mexico and the most ideological and radical of all the new leaders, declared that the revolution was still on so long as the land reform question remained unaddressed and poverty unalleviated. \u201cLa tierra es para el que la trabaja,\u201d went the zapatista slogan. \u201cThe land is for those who work it.\u201d Pascual Orozco\u2019s army of miners, railroad workers, and farm laborers in the North also turned on Madero, echoing calls not just for the expropriation of the haciendas but also better working conditions and protections for labor unions. The Madero government\u2019s apparent weakness in the face of these left-wing worker and peasant rebellions spooked domestic and international business elites and their allies in government. To solve this problem, Henry Lane Wilson, US president William Howard Taft\u2019s ambassador to Mexico, played a leading role in orchestrating a coup in which Madero was murdered and a traitorous general, Victoriano Huerta, assumed the presidency. It was a playbook the United States would refine to the point of near perfection over the next century. After Madero\u2019s assassination in 1913, all hell broke loose. Huerta successfully offered Orozco some concessions on workers\u2019 rights in exchange for his allegiance, but Zapata \u2014 unyielding on the question of land reform \u2014 was set against him. So too was Pancho Villa, the leader of the largest revolutionary army in the country, the mighty Divisi\u00f3n del Norte. Though Villa\u2019s personal sympathies lay with the poor, he was at least on paper working for another general, Venustiano Carranza, a less radical leader who had taken up the maderista cause against Huerta. It was at this chaotic juncture, when the roster of important names grew too long to keep straight, that John Reed crossed the border, passing from the Texas town of Presidio into the Mexican town of Ojinaga. The latter had been besieged five times since the start of the conflict three years earlier. Of war-torn Ojinaga, he wrote: The white, dusty streets of the town, piled high with filth and fodder, the ancient windowless church with its three enormous Spanish bells hanging on a rack outside and a cloud of blue incense crawling out of the black doorway, where the women camp followers of the army prayed for victory day and night, lay in hot, breathless sun. . . . Hardly a house that had a roof, and all the walls gaped with cannon-shot. Reed understood immediately that while the proliferation of armies and constant shifting of loyalties made the conflict difficult to follow, it was in fact simple to understand. \u201cIt is common to speak of the Orozco revolution, the Zapata revolution and the Carranza revolution,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs a matter of fact, there is and has been only one revolution in Mexico. It is a fight primarily for land.\u201d\n\nOpening the Closed Fist As the country emerged from D\u00edaz\u2019s bourgeois dictatorship, peasants and working people in Mexico lacked a political vehicle to cohere and advance their interests. The closest thing was Zapata\u2019s army in the South, which was clear about its aims: not only political democracy and land reform but also universal public lay schools, which put it in conflict with the Catholic Church that controlled education, and the nationalization of Mexico\u2019s natural resources, which put it in conflict with both domestic and international capitalists. But in the North, there was no army whose political goals were quite so explicit. Pancho Villa was known as Mexico\u2019s Robin Hood for his eagerness to redistribute wealth and land, often acquired through ruthless acts of expropriation and cunning feats of banditry. But he acted in coalition with others whose inclinations were notably less redistributionist, and besides, whatever his class sympathies, Villa was more a military leader than a political one. And so the workers and peasants in the North grafted their own hopes for radical social transformation imperfectly onto the muddled revolution that was already underway. Socialism \u2014 is it a thing? I only see it in books, and I do not read much. Reed embedded early on with a revolutionary battalion under the command of General Tom\u00e1s Urbina, whose inner circle displayed the range of perspectives at the top of the revolutionary military hierarchy. A major told Reed that the revolution \u201cis a fight of the poor against the rich. I was poor before the revolution, and now I am very rich.\u201d But a captain told Reed, \u201cWhen we win the Revoluci\u00f3n it will be a government by the men \u2014 not by the rich. We are riding over the lands of the men. They used to belong to the rich. But now they belong to me and to my compa\u00f1eros.\u201d Later on, Reed was greatly impressed by General Toribio Ortega, \u201cby far the most simple-hearted and disinterested soldier in Mexico,\u201d who told Reed, We have seen the rurales and the soldiers of Porfirio D\u00edaz shoot down our brothers and our fathers, and justice denied to them. We have seen our little fields taken away from us, and all of us sold into slavery, eh? We have longed for our homes and for schools to teach us, and they have laughed at us. All we have ever wanted was to be let alone to live and to work and make our country great, and we are tired \u2014 tired and sick of being cheated. All across northern Mexico, Reed met both rank-and-file soldiers and pac\u00edficos \u2014 those who stayed out of the fighting \u2014 who articulated radical interpretations of the revolution\u2019s aims. The night before the hacienda battle, Reed witnessed a soldier composing a ballad that contained verses such as \u201cThe rich with all their money, have already got their lashing. . . . Ambition will ruin itself, and justice will be the winner.\u201d Reed came across a pac\u00edfico, a gentle man whose body was wasted from malnutrition, who told him, \u201cThe Revoluci\u00f3n is good. When it is done we shall starve never, never, never, if God is served.\u201d On one stretch of road, Reed came across two goat herders who shared their fire and offered shelter, one a hunched and wrinkled old man and the other a tall, smooth-skinned youth. As they spoke about the revolution, the young man\u2019s voice rose with passion. \u201cIt is the rich Americans who want to rob us, just as the rich Mexicans want to rob us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the rich all over the world who want to rob the poor.\u201d A few more words were exchanged and then the youth said, \u201cFor the years of me, my father, and my grandfather, the rich men have gathered the corn and held it in their clenched fists before our mouths. And only blood will make them open their hand to their brothers.\u201d Moved by this encounter, Reed wrote: Around them stretched the desert, held off only by our fire, ready to spring in upon us when it should die. Above the great stars would not dim. Coyotes wailed somewhere out beyond the firelight like demons in pain. I suddenly conceived these two human beings as symbols of Mexico \u2014 courteous, loving, patient, poor, so long slaves, so full of dreams, so soon to be free.\n\nThe Dream of Pancho Villa John Reed wanted an audience with Emiliano Zapata, for whom he had complete admiration, calling him, in a letter to his editor, \u201cthe great man of the Revolution . . . a radical, absolutely logical and perfectly constant.\u201d The meeting proved impossible, but the Metropolitan was equally if not more pleased when Reed was able to secure an audience with the infamous Pancho Villa. Of course, riding with Villa meant tempting fate, as the general was involved in heavy fighting and never far from the front lines. But Reed leapt at the opportunity to put his life in danger in order to capture Villa\u2019s essence, which was precisely why the Metropolitan had hired him. Villa had been intensely demonized by the American press, but Reed saw things differently, viewing Villa as a man of the people and friend to the poor. Villa promised that there would be \u201cno more palaces in Mexico\u201d after the revolution, and often expressed his love for the people with sayings like \u201cThe tortillas of the poor are better than the bread of the rich.\u201d He demonstrated his class allegiances in action many times, seizing money and property from the rich without remorse and either giving it directly to the poor or putting it to use for the revolutionary cause. Villa was reviled by the Mexican bourgeoisie, whereas the peasants composed ballads about him. But Reed also observed that Villa\u2019s strengths were not political. He had lived as an outlaw prior to the revolution, and was illiterate until a stint in prison for his role in supporting Madero gave him the opportunity to learn to read. He had some idea, which he expressed vaguely to Reed, that after the revolution the state would establish large enterprises that would both employ everyone and produce all the things people needed. But Reed once asked him what he thought of socialism, to which Villa responded, \u201cSocialism \u2014 is it a thing? I only see it in books, and I do not read much.\u201d Walter Lippmann wrote in a letter to Reed that his Mexican reporting was \u2018undoubtedly the finest reporting that\u2019s ever been done.\u2019 Villa\u2019s great talent was instead his instinctive military dexterity. Reed compared his style of fighting to Napoleon\u2019s, naming among his advantages \u201csecrecy, quickness of movement, the adaptation of his plans to the character of the country and of his soldiers, the value of intimate relations with the rank and file, and of building up a tradition among the enemy that his army is invincible, and that he himself bears a charmed life.\u201d Reed saw Villa as an autodidactic military genius, capable of viewing the entire revolution in all its complexity from a high perch and making swift decisions based on gut feeling that proved consistently correct. When Reed asked Villa whether he wanted to become president of Mexico, Villa answered frankly, \u201cI am a fighter, not a statesman.\u201d Knowing the Metropolitan would be unsatisfied with the simplicity of the response, Reed was compelled to ask several more times. This annoyed Villa, who told Reed that if he asked the question again, he would be \u201cspanked and sent to the border,\u201d and walked around for several days thereafter telling everyone with amusement about the chatito (pug nose) who wouldn\u2019t drop the issue. Nonetheless, Villa liked Reed enough to spend plenty of time with him in private, and to write him an all-access pass to use the railways and telephones throughout Chihuahua free of charge. The Pancho Villa in Insurgent Mexico is great fun. He never drank or smoked, but he loved to dance. He sent his own roosters into the cockfighting pit every afternoon at four o\u2019clock. If he had extra energy to burn, he would sometimes check in at a nearby slaughterhouse to see if they had any bulls he could fight. He was a middling matador, \u201cas stubborn and clumsy as the bull, slow on his feet, but swift as an animal with his body and arms.\u201d If the bull knocked him with his horns, Villa would lunge at it and begin to wrestle, prompting his men to intervene. \u201cThe common soldiers adore him for his bravery and his coarse, blunt humor,\u201d Reed wrote admiringly. \u201cOften I have seen him slouched on his cot in the little red caboose in which he always traveled, cracking jokes familiarly with twenty ragged privates sprawled on the floor, chairs and tables.\u201d This caboose was indeed a train car: when Villa sacked the city of Torre\u00f3n for the first time, he took command of the northern Mexican railways, and thereafter his army traveled both by horse and by train. In addition to his caboose, there were hospital cars, water cars, cannon cars, and even repair cars whose purpose was to mend engines and broken segments of track, sometimes in the heat of battle. The revolutionary armies started haphazardly, with no commissaries or any formal means to provide for the daily care of soldiers, from cooking to nursing to washing and mending clothes. So from the beginning, women called soldaderas had traveled with Villa\u2019s army, caring for their enlisted husbands with their children in tow. Whole families crisscrossed the desert with Villa, first on foot and then by rail. Soldaderas also took up arms, though most spent their time cooking tortillas and big bowls of chile and hanging laundry from makeshift clotheslines atop the train cars. Without them, the whole operation would have fallen apart. Reed wrote some of his most rousing passages in Insurgent Mexico about his time on the trains with Villa\u2019s soldiers and soldaderas. Huerta\u2019s counterrevolutionary government was unstable, his enemies were legion, and his reign was coming to a close. Reed was with the Divisi\u00f3n del Norte as it advanced on Torre\u00f3n for a second time, the spectacular guerrilla trains snaking through the desert, carrying on their backs the dream of a new nation. Daybreak came with a sound of all the bugles in the world blowing; and looking out of the car door I saw the desert for miles boiling with armed men saddling and mounting. . . . A hundred breakfast fires smoked from the car-tops, and the women stood turning their dresses slowly in the sun, chattering and joking. Hundreds of little naked babies danced around, while their mothers lifted up their little clothes to the heat. A thousand joyous troopers shouted to each other that the advance was beginning . . ."}, {"url": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Insurgent_Mexico.html?id=4MIezgEACAAJ", "page_content": "\"...Villa was an outlaw for twenty-two years.

MEXICAN NIGHTS\n\nINSURGENT MEXICO\n\nON THE BORDER\n\nMercado's Federal army, after its dramatic and terrible retreat four hundred miles across the desert when Chihuahua was abandoned, lay three months at Ojinaga on the Rio Grande.\n\nAt Presidio, on the American side of the river, one could climb to the flat mud roof of the Post Office and look across the mile or so of low scrub growing in the sand to the shallow, yellow stream; and beyond to the low mesa, where the town was, sticking sharply up out of a scorched desert, ringed round with bare, savage mountains.\n\nOne could see the square, gray adobe houses of Ojinaga, with here and there the Oriental cupola of an old Spanish church. It was a desolate land, without trees. You expected minarets. By day, Federal soldiers in shabby white uniforms swarmed about the place desultorily digging trenches, for Villa and his victorious Constitutionalists were rumored to be on the way. You got sudden glints, where the sun flashed on field guns; strange, thick clouds of smoke rose straight in the still air.\n\nToward evening, when the sun went down with the flare of a blast furnace, patrols of cavalry rode sharply across the skyline to the night outposts. And after dark, mysterious fires burned in the town.\n\nThere were thirty-five hundred men in Ojinaga. This was all that remained of Mercado's army of ten thousand and the five thousand which Pascual Orozco had marched north from Mexico City to reinforce him. Of this thirty-five hundred, forty-five were majors, twenty-one colonels, and eleven generals.\n\nI wanted to interview General Mercado; but one of the newspapers had printed something displeasing to General Salazar, and he had forbidden the reporters the town. I sent a polite request to General Mercado. The note was intercepted by General Orozco, who sent back the following reply:\n\nESTEEMED AND HONORED SIR: If you set foot inside of Ojinaga, I will stand you sideways against a wall, and with my own hand take great pleasure in shooting furrows in your back.\n\nBut after all I waded the river one day and went up into the town. Luckily, I did not meet General Orozco. No one seemed to object to my entrance. All the sentries I saw were taking a siesta on the shady side of adobe walls. But almost immediately I encountered a courteous officer named Hernandez, to whom I explained that I wished to see General Mercado.\n\nWithout inquiring as to my identity, he scowled, folded his arms, and burst out:\n\n\"I am General Orozco's chief of staff, and I will not take you to see General Mercado!\"\n\nI said nothing. In a few minutes he explained:\n\n\"General Orozco hates General Mercado! He does not deign to go to General Mercado's cuartel, and General Mercado does not dare to come to General Orozco's cuartel! He is a coward. He ran away from Tierra Blanca, and then he ran away from Chihuahua!\"\n\n\"What other Generals don't you like?\" I asked.\n\nHe caught himself and slanted an angry look at me, and then grinned:\n\n\"Quien sabe....?\"\n\nI saw General Mercado, a fat, pathetic, worried, undecided little man, who blubbered and blustered a long tale about how the United States army had come across the river and helped Villa to win the battle of Tierra Blanca.\n\nThe white, dusty streets of the town, piled high with filth and fodder, the ancient windowless church with its three enormous Spanish bells hanging on a rack outside and a cloud of blue incense crawling out of the black doorway, where the women camp followers of the army prayed for victory day and night, lay in hot, breathless sun. Five times had Ojinaga been lost and taken. Hardly a house that had a roof, and all the walls gaped with cannon-shot. In these bare, gutted rooms lived the soldiers, their women, their horses, their chickens and pigs, raided from the surrounding country. Guns were stacked in the corners, saddles piled in the dust. The soldiers were in rags; scarcely one possessed a complete uniform. They squatted around little fires in their doorways, boiling corn-husks and dried meat. They were almost starving.\n\nAlong the main street passed an unbroken procession of sick, exhausted, starving people, driven from the interior by fear of the approaching rebels, a journey of eight days over the most terrible desert in the world. They were stopped by a hundred soldiers along the street, and robbed of every possession that took the Federals' fancy. Then they passed on to the river, and on the American side they had to run the gantlet of the United States customs and immigration officials and the Army Border Patrol, who searched them for arms.\n\nHundreds of refugees poured across the river, some on horseback driving cattle before them, some in wagons, and others on foot. The inspectors were not very gentle.\n\n\"Come down off that wagon!\" one would shout to a Mexican woman with a bundle in her arm.\n\n\"But, se\u00f1or, for what reason?...\" she would begin.\n\n\"Come down there or I'll pull you down!\" he would yell.\n\nThey made an unnecessarily careful and brutal search of the men and of the women, too.\n\nAs I stood there, a woman waded across the ford, her skirts lifted unconcernedly to her thighs. She wore a voluminous shawl, which was humped up in front as if she were carrying something in it.\n\n\"Hi, there!\" shouted a customs man. \"What have you got under your shawl?\"\n\nShe slowly opened the front of her dress, and answered placidly:\n\n\"I don't know, se\u00f1or. It may be a girl, or it may be a boy.\"\n\nThese were metropolitan days for Presidio, a straggling and indescribably desolate village of about fifteen adobe houses, scattered without much plan in the deep sand and cotton-wood scrub along the river bottom. Old Kleinmann, the German store-keeper, made a fortune a day outfitting refugees and supplying the Federal army across the river with provisions. He had three beautiful adolescent daughters whom he kept locked up in the attic of the store, because a flock of amorous Mexicans and ardent cow-punchers prowled around like dogs, drawn from many miles away by the fame of these damsels. Half the time he spent working furiously in the store, stripped to the waist; and the remainder, rushing around with a large gun strapped to his waist, warning off the suitors.\n\nAt all times of the day and night, throngs of unarmed Federal soldiers from across the river swarmed in the store and the pool hall. Among them circulated dark, ominous persons with an important air, secret agents of the Rebels and the Federals. Around in the brush camped hundreds of destitute refugees, and you could not walk around a corner at night without stumbling over a plot or a counterplot. There were Texas rangers, and United States troopers, and agents of American corporations trying to get secret instructions to their employees in the interior.\n\nOne MacKenzie stamped about the Post Office in a high dudgeon. It appeared that he had important letters for the American Smelting and Refining Company mines in Santa Eulalia.\n\n\"Old Mercado insists on opening and reading all letters that pass through his lines,\" he shouted indignantly.\n\n\"But,\" I said, \"he will let them pass, won't he?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" he answered. \"But do you think the American Smelting and Refining Company will submit to having its letters opened and read by a damned greaser? It's an outrage when an American corporation can't send a private letter to its employees! If this don't bring Intervention,\" he finished, darkly, \"I don't know what will!\"\n\nThere were all sorts of drummers for arms and ammunition companies, smugglers and contrabandistas; also a small, bantam man, the salesman for a portrait company, which made crayon enlargements from photographs at $5 apiece. He was scurrying around among the Mexicans, getting thousands of orders for pictures which were to be paid for upon delivery, and which; of course, could never be delivered. It was his first experience among Mexicans, and he was highly gratified by the hundreds of orders he had received. You see, a Mexican would just as soon order a portrait, or a piano, or an automobile as not, so long as he does not have to pay for it. It gives him a sense of wealth.\n\nThe little agent for crayon enlargements made one comment on the Mexican revolution. He said that General Huerta must be a fine man, because he understood he was distantly connected, on his mother's side, with the distinguished Carey family of Virginia!\n\nThe American bank of the river was patroled twice a day by details of cavalry, conscientiously paralleled on the Mexican side by companies of horsemen. Both parties watched each other narrowly across the Border. Every once in a while a Mexican, unable to restrain his nervousness, took a pot-shot at the Americans, and a small battle ensued as both parties scattered into the brush. A little way above Presidio were stationed two troops of the Negro Ninth Cavalry. One colored trooper, watering his horse on the bank of the river, was accosted by an English-speaking Mexican squatting on the opposite shore:\n\n\"Hey, coon!\" he shouted, derisively, \"when are you damned Gringos going to cross that line?\"\n\n\"Chile!\" responded the Negro. \"We ain't agoin' to cross that line at all. We're just goin' to pick up that line an' carry it right down to the Big Ditch!\"\n\nSometimes a rich refugee, with a good deal of gold sewed in his saddle-blankets, would get across the river without the Federals discovering it. There were six big, high-power automobiles in Presidio waiting for just such a victim. They would soak him one hundred dollars gold to make a trip to the railroad; and on the way, somewhere in the desolate wastes south of Marfa, he was almost sure to be held up by masked men and everything taken away from him. Upon these occasions the High Sheriff of Presidio County would bluster into town on a small pinto horse,\u2014a figure true to the best tradition of \"The Girl of the Golden West.\" He had read all Owen Wister's novels, and knew what a Western sheriff ought to look like: two revolvers on the hip, one slung under his arm, a large knife in his left boot, and an enormous shotgun over his saddle. His conversation was larded with the most fearful oaths, and he never caught any criminal. He spent all of his time enforcing the Presidio County law against carrying firearms and playing poker; and at night, after the day's work was done, you could always find him sitting in at a quiet game in the back of Kleinmann's store.\n\nWar and rumors of war kept Presidio at a fever heat. We all knew that sooner or later the Constitutionalist army would come overland from Chihuahua and attack Ojinaga. In fact, the major in command of the Border Patrol had already been approached by the Federal generals in a body to make arrangements for the retreat of the Federal army from Ojinaga under such circumstances. They said that when the rebels attacked they would want to resist for a respectable length of time,\u2014say two hours,\u2014and that then they would like permission to come across the river.\n\nWe knew that some twenty-five miles southward, at La Mula Pass, five hundred rebel volunteers guarded the only road from Ojinaga through the mountains. One day a courier sneaked through the Federal lines and across the river with important news. He said that the military band of the Federal army had been marching around the country practicing their music, and had been captured by the Constitutionalists, who stood them up in the market-place with rifles pointed at their heads, and made them play twelve hours at a stretch. \"Thus,\" continued the message, \"the hardships of life in the desert have been somewhat alleviated.\" We could never discover just how it was that the band happened to be practicing all alone twenty-two miles from Ojinaga in the desert.\n\nFor a month longer the Federals remained at Ojinaga, and Presidio throve. Then Villa, at the head of his army, appeared over a rise of the desert. The Federals resisted a respectable length of time\u2014just two hours, or, to be exact, until Villa himself at the head of a battery galloped right up to the muzzles of the guns,\u2014and then poured across the river in wild rout, were herded in a vast corral by the American soldiers, and afterward imprisoned in a barbed-wire stockade at Fort Bliss, Texas.\n\nBut by that time I was already far down in Mexico, riding across the desert with a hundred ragged Constitutionalist troopers on my way to the front.\n\nPART ONE\n\nDESERT WAR\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nURBINA'S COUNTRY\n\nA peddler from Parral came into town with a mule-load of macuche,\u2014you smoke macuche when you can't get tobacco,\u2014and we strolled down with the rest of the population to get the news. This was in Magistral, a Durango mountain village three days' ride from the railroad. Somebody bought a little macuche, the rest of us borrowed from him, and we sent a boy for some corn-shucks. Everybody lit up, squatting around the peddler three deep; for it was weeks since the town had heard of the Revolution. He was full of the most alarming rumors: that the Federals had broken out of Torreon and were headed this way, burning ranches and murdering pacificos; that the United States troops had crossed the Rio Grande; that Huerta had resigned; that Huerta was coming north to take charge of the Federal troops in person; that Pascual Orozco had been shot at Ojinaga; that Pascual Orozco was coming south with ten thousand colorados. He retailed these reports with a wealth of dramatic gesture, stamping around until his heavy brown-and-gold sombrero wabbled on his head, tossing his faded blue blanket over his shoulder, firing imaginary rifles and drawing imaginary swords, while his audience murmured: \"Ma!\" and \"Adio!\" But the most interesting rumor was that General Urbina would leave for the front in two days.\n\nA hostile Arab named Antonio Swayfeta happened to be driving to Parral in a two-wheeled gig the next morning, and allowed me to go with him as far as Las Nieves, where the General lives. By afternoon we had climbed out of the mountains to the great upland plain of Northern Durango, and were jogging down the mile-long waves of yellow prairie, stretching away so far that the grazing cattle dwindled into dots and finally disappeared at the base of the wrinkled purple mountains that seemed close enough to hit with a thrown stone. The Arab's hostility had thawed, and he poured out his life's story, not one word of which I could understand. But the drift of it, I gathered, was largely commercial. He had once been to El Paso and regarded it as the world's most beautiful city. But business was better in Mexico. They say that there are few Jews in Mexico because they cannot stand the competition of the Arabs.\n\nWe passed only one human being all that day\u2014a ragged old man astride a burro, wrapped in a red-and-black checked serape, though without trousers, and hugging the broken stock of a rifle. Spitting, he volunteered that he was a soldier; that after three years of deliberation he had finally decided to join the Revolution and fight for Libertad. But at his first battle a cannon had been fired, the first he had ever heard; he had immediately started for his home in El Oro, where he intended to descend into a gold-mine and stay there until the war was over....\n\nWe fell silent, Antonio and I. Occasionally he addressed the mule in faultless Castilian. Once he informed me that that mule was \"all heart\" (pura corazon). The sun hung for a moment on the crest of the red porphyry mountains, and dropped behind them; the turquoise cup of sky held an orange powder of clouds. Then all the rolling leagues of desert glowed and came near in the soft light. Ahead suddenly reared the solid fortress of a big rancho, such as one comes on once a day in that vast land,\u2014a mighty square of blank walls, with loop-holed towers at the corners, and an iron-studded gate. It stood grim and forbidding upon a little bare hill, like any castle, its adobe corrals around it; and below, in what had been a dry arroyo all day, the sunken river came to the surface in a pool, and disappeared again in the sand. Thin lines of smoke from within rose straight into the high last sunshine. From the river to the gate moved the tiny black figures of women with water-jars on their heads: and two wild horsemen galloped some cattle toward the corrals. Now the western mountains were blue velvet, and the pale sky a blood-stained canopy of watered silk. But by the time we reached the great gate of the rancho, above was only a shower of stars.\n\nAntonio called for Don Jesus. It is always safe to call for Don Jesus at a rancho, for that is invariably the administrador's name. He finally appeared, a magnificently tall man in tight trousers, purple silk undershirt, and a gray sombrero heavily loaded with silver braid; and invited us in. The inside of the wall consisted of houses, running all the way around. Along the walls and over the doors hung festoons of jerked meat, and strings of peppers, and drying clothes. Three young girls crossed the square in single file, balancing ollas of water on their heads, shouting to each other in the raucous voices of Mexican women. At one house a woman crouched, nursing her baby; next door another kneeled to the interminable labor of grinding corn-meal in a stone trough. The men-folk squatted before little corn-husk fires, bundled in their faded serapes, smoking their hojas as they watched the women work. As we unharnessed they rose and gathered around, with soft-voiced \"Bueno noches,\" curious and friendly. Where did we come from? Where going? What did we have of news? Had the Maderistas taken Ojinaga yet? Was it true that Orozco was coming to kill the pacificos? Did we know Panfilo Silveyra? He was a sergento, one of Urbina's men. He came from that house, was the cousin of this man. Ah, there was too much war!\n\nAntonio departed to bargain for corn for the mule. \"A tanito\u2014just a little corn,\" he whined. \"Surely Don Jesus wouldn't charge him anything.... Just so much corn as a mule could eat...!\" At one of the houses I negotiated for dinner. The woman spread out both her hands. \"We are all so poor now,\" she said. \"A little water, some beans\u2014tortillas.... It is all we eat in this house....\" Milk? No. Eggs? No. Meat? No. Coffee? Valgame Dios, no! I ventured that with this money they might be purchased at one of the other houses. \"Quien sabe?\" replied she dreamily. At this moment arrived the husband and upbraided her for her lack of hospitality. \"My house is at your orders,\" he said magnificently, and begged a cigarette. Then he squatted down while she brought forward the two family chairs and bade us seat ourselves. The room was of good proportions, with a dirt floor and a ceiling of heavy beams, the adobe showing through. Walls and ceiling were whitewashed, and, to the naked eye, spotlessly clean. In one corner was a big iron bed, and in the other a Singer sewing machine, as in every other house I saw in Mexico. There was also a spindle-legged table, upon which stood a picture-postcard of Our Lady of Guadelupe, with a candle burning before it. Above this, on the wall, hung an indecent illustration clipped from the pages of Le Rire, in a silver-gilt frame\u2014evidently an object of the highest veneration.\n\nArrived now various uncles, cousins, and compadres, wondering casually if we dragged any cigarros. At her husband's command, the woman brought a live coal in her fingers. We smoked. It grew late. There developed a lively argument as to who would go and buy provisions for our dinner. Finally they compromised on the woman; and soon Antonio and I sat in the kitchen, while she crouched upon the altar-like adobe platform in the corner, cooking over the open fire. The smoke enveloped up, pouring out the door. Occasionally a pig or a few hens would wander in from the outside, or a sheep would make a dash for the tortilla meal, until the angry voice of the master of the house reminded the woman that she was not doing five or six things at once. And she would rise wearily and belabor the animal with a flaming brand.\n\nAll through our supper\u2014jerked meat fiery with chile, fried eggs, tortillas, frijoles, and bitter black coffee,\u2014the entire male population of the rancho bore us company, in the room and out. It seemed that some were especially prejudiced against the Church. \"Priests without shame,\" cried one, \"who come when we are so poor and take away a tenth of what we have!\"\n\n\"And us paying a quarter to the Government for this cursed war!\" ...\n\n\"Shut your mouth!\" shrilled the woman. \"It is for God! God must eat, the same as we....\"\n\nHer husband smiled a superior smile. He had once been to Jimenez and was considered a man of the world.\n\n\"God does not eat,\" he remarked with finality. \"The curas grow fat on us.\"\n\n\"Why do you give it?\" I asked.\n\n\"It is the law,\" said several at once.\n\nAnd not one would believe that that law was repealed in Mexico in the year 1857!\n\nI asked them about General Urbina. \"A good man, all heart.\" And another: \"He is very brave. The bullets bound off him like rain from a sombrero....\" \"He is the cousin of my woman's first husband's sister.\" \"He is bueno para los negocios del campo\" (that is to say, he is a highly successful bandit and highwayman). And finally one said proudly: \"A few years ago he was just a peon like us; and now he is a General and a rich man.\"\n\nBut I shall not soon forget the hunger-pinched body and bare feet of an old man with the face of a saint, who said slowly: \"The Revolucion is good. When it is done we shall starve never, never, never, if God is served. But it is long, and we have no food to eat, or clothes to wear. For the master has gone away from the hacienda, and we have no tools or animals to do our work with, and the soldiers take all our corn and drive away the cattle....\"\n\n\"Why don't the pacificos fight?\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \"Now they do not need us. They have no rifles for us, or horses. They are winning. And who shall feed them if we do not plant corn? No, se\u00f1or. But if the Revolucion loses, then there will be no more pacificos. Then we will rise, with our knives and our horsewhips.... The Revolucion will not lose....\"\n\nAs Antonio and I rolled up in our blankets on the floor of the granary, they were singing. One of the young bucks had procured a guitar somewhere, and two voices, clinging to each other in that peculiar strident Mexican \"barber-shop\" harmony, were whining loudly something about a \"trista historia d'amor.\"...\n\nThe rancho was one of many belonging to the Hacienda of El Canotillo, and all next day we drove through its wide lands, which covered more than two million acres, I was told. The hacendado, a wealthy Spaniard, had fled the country two years before.\n\n\"Who is owner now?\"\n\n\"General Urbina,\" said Antonio. And it was so, as I soon saw. The great haciendas of Northern Durango, an area greater than the State of New Jersey, had been confiscated for the Constitutionalist government by the General, who ruled them with his own agents, and, it was said, divided fifty-fifty with the Revolution.\n\nWe drove steadily all day, only stopping long enough to eat a few tortillas. And along about sundown we saw the brown mud wall that hemmed El Canotillo round, with its city of little houses, and the ancient pink tower of its church among the alamo trees,\u2014miles away at the foot of the mountains. The village of Las Nieves, a straggling collection of adobes the exact color of the earth of which they are built, lay before us, like some strange growth of the desert. A flashing river, without a trace of green along its banks to contrast it with the scorched plain, made a semi-circle around the town. And as we splashed across the ford, between the women kneeling there at their washing, the sun suddenly went behind the western mountains. Immediately a deluge of yellow light, thick as water, drowned the earth, and a golden mist rose from the ground, in which the cattle floated legless.\n\nI knew that the price for such a journey as Antonio had carried me was at least ten pesos, and he was an Arab to boot. But when I offered him money, he threw his arms around me and burst into tears.... God bless you, excellent Arab! You are right; business is better in Mexico.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE LION OF DURANGO AT HOME\n\nAt General Urbina's door sat an old peon with four cartridge-belts around him, engaged in the genial occupation of filling corrugated iron bombs with gunpowder. He jerked his thumb toward the patio. The General's house, corrals and storerooms ran around all four sides of a space as big as a city block, swarming with pigs, chickens and half-naked children. Two goats and three magnificent peacocks gazed pensively down from the roof. In and out of the sitting-room, whence came the phonographic strains of the \"Dollar Princess,\" stalked a train of hens. An old woman came from the kitchen and dumped a bucket of garbage on the ground; all the pigs made a squealing rush for it. In a corner of the house-wall sat the General's baby daughter, chewing on a cartridge. A group of men stood or sprawled on the ground around a well in the center of the patio. The General himself sat in their midst, in a broken wicker arm-chair, feeding tortillas to a tame deer and a lame black sheep. Before him kneeled a peon, pouring from a canvas sack some hundreds of Mauser cartridges.\n\nTo my explanations the General returned no answer. He gave me a limp hand, immediately withdrawing it, but did not rise. A broad, medium-sized man of dark mahogany complexion, with a sparse black beard up to his cheek-bones, that didn't hide the wide, thin, expressionless mouth, the gaping nostrils, the shiny, small, humorous, animal eyes. For a good five minutes he never took them from mine. I produced my papers.\n\n\"I don't know how to read,\" said the General suddenly, motioning to his secretary. \"So you want to go with me to battle?\" he shot at me in the coarsest Spanish. \"Many bullets!\" I said nothing. \"Muy bien! But I don't know when I shall go. Maybe in five days. Now eat!\"\n\n\"Thanks, my general, I've already eaten.\"\n\n\"Go and eat,\" he repeated calmly. \"Andale!\"\n\nA dirty little man they all called Doctor escorted me to the dining-room. He had once been an apothecary in Parral, but was now a Major. We were to sleep together that night, he said. But before we reached the dining-room there was a shout of \"Doctor!\" A wounded man had arrived, a peasant with his sombrero in his hand, and a blood-clotted handkerchief around his head. The little doctor became all efficiency. He dispatched a boy for the family scissors, another for a bucket of water from the well. He sharpened with his knife a stick he picked up from the ground. Seating the man on a box, he took off the bandage, revealing a cut about two inches long, caked with dirt and dried blood. First he cut off the hair around the wound, jabbing the points of the scissors carelessly into it. The man drew in his breath sharply, but did not move. Then the doctor slowly cut the clotted blood away from the top, whistling cheerfully to himself. \"Yes,\" he remarked, \"it is an interesting life, the doctor's.\" He peered closely at the vomiting blood; the peasant sat like a sick stone. \"And it is a life full of nobility,\" continued the doctor. \"Alleviating the sufferings of others.\" Here he picked up the sharpened stick, thrust it deep in, and slowly worked it the entire length of the cut!\n\n\"Pah! The animal has fainted!\" said the doctor. \"Here, hold him up while I wash it!\" With that he lifted the bucket and poured its contents over the head of the patient, the water and blood dribbling down over his clothes. \"These ignorant peons,\" said the doctor, binding up the wound in its original bandage, \"have no courage. It is the intelligence that makes the soul, eh?\" ...\n\nWhen the peasant came to, I asked: \"Are you a soldier?\" The man smiled a sweet, deprecating smile.\n\n\"No, se\u00f1or, I am only a pacifico,\" he said. \"I live in the Canotillo, where my house is at your orders....\"\n\nSome time later\u2014a good deal\u2014we all sat down to supper. There was Lieutenant-Colonel Pablo Sea\u00f1es, a frank, engaging youth of twenty-six, with five bullets in him to pay for the three years' fighting. His conversation was sprinkled with soldierly curses, and his pronunciation was a little indistinct, the result of a bullet on the jaw-bone and a tongue almost cut in two by a sword. He was a demon in the field, they said, and a killer (muy matador) after it. At the first taking of Torreon, Pablo and two other officers, Major Fierro and Captain Borunda, had executed alone eighty unarmed prisoners, each man shooting them down with his revolver until his hand got tired pulling the trigger.\n\n\"Oiga!*\" Pablo said. \"Where is the best institute for the study of hypnotism in the United States? ... As soon as this cursed war is over I am going to study to become a hypnotist....\" With that he turned and began to make passes at Lieutenant Borrega, who was called derisively \"The Lion of the Sierras,\" because of his prodigious boasting. The latter jerked out his revolver: \"I want no business with the devil!\" he screamed, amid the uproarious laughter of the others.\n\nThen there was Captain Fernando, a grizzled giant of a man in tight trousers, who had fought twenty-one battles. He took the keenest delight in my fragmentary Spanish, and every word I spoke sent him into bellows of laughter that shook down the adobe from the ceiling. He had never been out of Durango, and declared that there was a great sea between the United States and Mexico, and that he believed all the rest of the earth to be water. Next to him sat Longinos G\u00fcereca, with a row of decayed teeth across his round, gentle face every time he smiled, and a record for simple bravery that was famous throughout the army. He was twenty-one, and already First Captain. He told me that last night his own men had tried to kill him.... Then came Patricio, the best rider of wild horses in the State, and Fidencio next to him, a pure-blooded Indian seven feet tall, who always fought standing up. And last Raphael Zalarzo, a tiny hunchback that Urbina carried in his train to amuse him, like any medieval Italian duke.\n\nWhen we had burned our throats with the last enchilada, and scooped up our last frijole with a tortilla,\u2014forks and spoons being unknown,\u2014the gentlemen each took a mouthful of water, gargled it, and spat it on the floor. As I came out into the patio, I saw the figure of the General emerge from his bedroom door, staggering slightly. In his hand he carried a revolver. He stood for a moment in the light of another door, then suddenly went in, banging it behind him.\n\nI was already in bed when the doctor came into the room. In the other bed reposed the Lion of the Sierras and his momentary mistress, now loudly snoring.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Doctor, \"there has been some little trouble. The General has not been able to walk for two months from rheumatism.... And sometimes he is in great pain, and comforts himself with aguardiente.... To-night he tried to shoot his mother. He always tries to shoot his mother .... because he loves her very much.\" The Doctor peeped at himself in the mirror, and twisted his mustache. \"This Revolucion. Do not mistake. It is a fight of the poor against the rich. I was very poor before the Revolucion and now I am very rich.\" He pondered a moment, and then began removing his clothes. Through his filthy undershirt the Doctor honored me with his one English sentence: \"I have mooch lices,\" he said, with a proud smile....\n\nI went out at dawn and walked around Las Nieves. The town belongs to General Urbina, people, houses, animals and immortal souls. At Las Nieves he and he alone wields the high justice and the low. The town's only store is in his house, and I bought some cigarettes from the Lion of the Sierras, who was detailed store-clerk for the day. In the patio the General was talking with his mistress, a beautiful, aristocratic-looking woman, with a voice like a hand-saw. When he noticed me he came up and shook hands, saying that he'd like to have me take some pictures of him. I said that that was my purpose in life, and asked him if he thought he would leave soon for the front. \"In about ten days, I think,\" he answered. I began to get uncomfortable.\n\n\"I appreciate your hospitality, my General,\" I told him, \"but my work demands that I be where I can see the actual advance upon Torreon. If it is convenient, I should like to go back to Chihuahua and join General Villa, who will soon go south.\" Urbina's expression didn't change, but he shot at me: \"What is it that you don't like here? You are in your own house! Do you want cigarettes? Do you want aguardiente; or sotol, or cognac? Do you want a woman to warm your bed at night? Everything you want I can give you! Do you want a pistol? A horse? Do you want money?\" He jerked a handful of silver dollars from his pocket and threw them jingling on the ground at my feet.\n\nI said: \"Nowhere in Mexico am I so happy and contented as in this house.\" And I was prepared to go further.\n\nFor the next hour I took photographs of General Urbina: General Urbina on foot, with and without sword; General Urbina on three different horses; General Urbina with and without his family; General Urbina's three children, on horseback and off; General Urbina's mother, and his mistress; the entire family, armed with swords and revolvers, including the phonograph, produced for the purpose, one of the children holding a placard upon which was inked: \"General Tomas Urbina R.\"\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE GENERAL GOES TO WAR\n\nWe had finished breakfast and I was resigning myself to the ten days in Las Nieves, when the General suddenly changed his mind. He came out of his room, roaring orders. In five minutes the house was all bustle and confusion,\u2014officers rushing to pack their serapes, mozos and troopers saddling horses, peons with armfuls of rifles rushing to and fro. Patricio harnessed five mules to the great coach,\u2014an exact copy of the Deadwood Stage. A courier rode out on the run to summon the Tropa, which was quartered at the Canotillo. Rafaelito loaded the General's baggage into the coach; it consisted of a typewriter, four swords, one of them bearing the emblem of the Knights of Pythias, three uniforms, the General's branding-iron, and a twelve-gallon demijohn of sotol.\n\nAnd there came the Tropa, a ragged smoke of brown dust miles along the road. Ahead flew a little, squat, black figure, with the Mexican flag streaming over him; he wore a floppy sombrero loaded with five pounds of tarnished gold braid,\u2014once probably the pride of some imperial hacendado. Following him closely were Manuel Paredes, with riding boots up to his hips, fastened with silver buckles the size of dollars, beating his mount with the flat of a saber; Isidro Amayo, making his horse buck by flapping a hat in his eyes; Jos\u00e9 Valiente, ringing his immense silver spurs inlaid with turquoises; Jesus Mancilla, his flashing brass chain around his neck; Julian Reyes, with colored pictures of Christ and the Virgin fastened to the front of his sombrero; a struggling tangle of six behind, with Antonio Guzman trying to lasso them, the coils of his horsehair rope soaring out of the dust. They came on the dead run, all Indian shouts and cracking revolvers, until they were only a hundred feet away, then jerked their little cow-ponies cruelly to a staggering halt with bleeding mouths, a whirling confusion of men, horses and dust.\n\nThis was the Tropa when I first saw them. About a hundred, they were, in all stages of picturesque raggedness; some wore overalls, others the charro jackets of peons, while one or two sported tight vaquero trousers. A few had shoes, most of them only cowhide sandals, and the rest were barefooted. Sabas Gutierrez was garbed in an ancient frockcoat, split up the back for riding. Rifles slung at their saddles, four or five cartridge-belts crossed over their chests, high, flapping sombreros, immense spurs chiming as they rode, bright-colored serapes strapped on behind\u2014this was their uniform.\n\nThe General was with his mother. Outside the door crouched his mistress, weeping, her three children around her. For almost an hour we waited, then Urbina suddenly burst out of the door. With scarcely a look at his family, he leaped on his great, gray charger, and spurred furiously into the street. Juan Sanchez blew a blast on his cracked bugle, and the Tropa, with the General at its head, took the Canotillo road.\n\nIn the meanwhile Patricio and I loaded three cases of dynamite and a case of bombs into the boot of the coach. I got up beside Patricio, the peons let go of the mules' heads, and the long whip curled around their bellies. Galloping, we whirled out of the village, and took the steep bank of the river at twenty miles an hour. Away on the other side, the Tropa trotted along a more direct road. The Canotillo we passed without stopping.\n\n\"Arr\u00e9 mulas! Putas! Hijas de la Ho\u2014\u2014!\" yelled Patricio, the whip hissing. The Camino Real was a mere track on uneven ground; every time we took a little arroyo the dynamite came down with a sickening crash. Suddenly a rope broke, and one case bounced off the coach and fell upon rocks. It was a cool morning, however, and we strapped it on again safely....\n\nAlmost every hundred yards along the road were little heaps of stones, surmounted by wooden crosses,\u2014each one the memorial of a murder. And occasionally a tall, whitewashed cross uprose in the middle of a side-road, to protect some little desert rancho from the visits of the devil. Black shiny chaparral, the height of a mule's back, scraped the side of the coach; Spanish bayonet and the great barrel-cactus watched us like sentinels from the skyline of the desert. And always the mighty Mexican vultures circled over us, as if they knew we were going to war.\n\nLate in the afternoon the stone wall which bounds the million acres of the Hacienda of Torreon de Ca\u00f1as swung into sight on our left, marching across deserts and mountains like the Great Wall of China, for more than thirty miles; and, soon afterward, the hacienda itself. The Tropa had dismounted around the Big House. They said that General Urbina had suddenly been taken violently sick, and would probably be unable to leave his bed for a week.\n\nThe Casa Grande, a magnificent porticoed palace but one story high, covered the entire top of a desert rise. From its doorway one could see fifteen miles of yellow, rolling plain, and, beyond, the interminable ranges of bare mountains piled upon each other. Back of it lay the great corrals and stables, where the Tropa's evening fires already sent up myriad columns of yellow smoke. Below, in the hollow, more than a hundred peons' houses made a vast open square, where children and animals romped together, and the women kneeled at their eternal grinding of corn. Out on the desert a troop of vaqueros rode slowly home; and from the river, a mile away, the endless chain of black-shawled women carried water on their heads.... It is impossible to imagine how close to nature the peons live on these great haciendas. Their very houses are built of the earth upon which they stand, baked by the sun. Their food is the corn they grow; their drink the water from the dwindled river, carried painfully upon their heads; the clothes they wear are spun from the wool, and their sandals cut from the hide of a newly slaughtered steer. The animals are their constant companions, familiars of their houses. Light and darkness are their day and night. When a man and a woman fall in love they fly to each other without the formalities of a courtship,\u2014and when they are tired of each other they simply part. Marriage is very costly (six pesos to the priest), and is considered a very swagger extra; but it is no more binding than the most casual attachment. And of course jealousy is a stabbing matter.\n\nWe dined in one of the lofty, barren salas of the Casa Grande; a room with a ceiling eighteen feet high, and walls of noble proportions, covered with cheap American wallpaper. A gigantic mahogany sideboard occupied one side of the place, but we had no knives and forks. There was a tiny fireplace, in which a fire was never lighted, yet the chill of death abode there day and night. The room next door was hung with heavy, spotted brocade, though there was no rug on the concrete floor. No pipes and no plumbing in all the house,\u2014you went to the well or the river for water. And candles the only light! Of course the due\u00f1o had long fled the country; but the hacienda in its prime must have been as splendid and as uncomfortable as a medieval castle.\n\nThe cura or priest of the hacienda church presided at dinner. To him were brought the choicest viands, which he sometimes passed to his favorites after helping himself. We drank sotol and aguamiel, while the cura made away with a whole bottle of looted anisette. Exhilarated by this, His Reverence descanted upon the virtues of the confessional, especially where young girls were concerned. He also made us understand that he possessed certain feudal rights over new brides. \"The girls, here,\" he said, \"are very passionate....\"\n\nI noticed that the rest didn't laugh much at this, though they were outwardly respectful. After we were out of the room, Jos\u00e9 Valiente hissed, shaking so that he could hardly speak: \"I know the dirty \u2014\u2014! And my sister...! The Revolucion will have something to say about these curas!\" Two high Constitutionalist officers afterward hinted at a little-known program to drive the priests out of Mexico; and Villa's hostility to the curas is well known.\n\nPatricio was harnessing the coach when I came out in the morning, and the Tropa were saddling up. The doctor, who was remaining with the General, strolled up to my friend, Trooper Juan Vallejo.\n\n\"That's a pretty horse you've got there,\" he said, \"and a nice rifle. Lend them to me.\"\n\n\"But I haven't any other\u2014\u2014\" began Juan.\n\n\"I am your superior officer,\" returned the doctor. And that was the last we ever saw of doctor, horse and rifle.\n\nI said farewell to the General, who was lying in torture in bed, sending bulletins to his mother by telephone every fifteen minutes. \"May you journey happily,\" he said. \"Write the truth. I commend you to Pablito.\"\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nLA TROPA ON THE MARCH\n\nAnd so I got inside the coach, with Rafaelito, Pablo Sea\u00f1es, and his mistress. She was a strange creature. Young, slender, and beautiful, she was poison and a stone to everybody but Pablo. I never saw her smile and never heard her say a gentle word. Sometimes she treated us with dull ferocity; sometimes with bestial indifference. But Pablo she cradled like a baby. When he lay across the seat with his head in her lap, she would hug it fiercely to her breast, making noises like a tigress with her young.\n\nPatricio handed down his guitar from the box, where he kept it, and to Rafael's accompaniment the Lieutenant-Colonel sang love-ballads in a cracked voice. Every Mexican knows hundreds of these. They are not written down, but often composed extemporaneously, and handed along by word of mouth. Some of them are very beautiful, some grotesque, and others as satirical as any French popular song. He sang:\n\n\"Exiled I wandered through the world\u2014 Exiled by the government. I came back at the end of the year, Drawn by the fondness of love. I went away with the purpose Of staying away forever. And the love of a woman was the only thing That made me come back.\"\n\nAnd then \"Los Hijos de la Noche\":\n\n\"I am of the children of the night Who wander aimlessly in the darkness. The beautiful moon with its golden rays Is the companion of my sorrows. \"I am going to lose myself from thee, Exhausted with weeping; I am going sailing, sailing, By the shores of the sea. \"You will see at the time of our parting I will not allow you to love another. For if so it should be, I would ruin your face. And many blows we would give one another. \"So I am going to become an American. Go with God, Antonia. Say farewell to my friends. O may the Americans allow me to pass And open a saloon On the other side of the River!\"\n\nThe Hacienda of El Centro turned out to give us lunch. And there Fidencio offered me his horse to ride for the afternoon.\n\nThe Tropa had already ridden on ahead, and I could see them, strung out for half a mile in the black mesquite brush, the tiny red-white-and-green flag bobbing at their head. The mountains had withdrawn somewhere beyond the horizon, and we rode in the midst of a great bowl of desert, rolling up at the edges to meet the furnace-blue of the Mexican sky. Now that I was out of the coach, a great silence, and a peace beyond anything I ever felt, wrapped me around. It is almost impossible to get objective about the desert; you sink into it,\u2014become a part of it. Galloping along, I soon caught up with the Tropa.\n\n\"Aye, meester!\" they shouted. \"Here comes meester on a horse! Que tal, meester? How goes it? Are you going to fight with us?\"\n\nBut Captain Fernando at the head of the column turned and roared: \"Come here, meester!\" The big man was grinning with delight. \"You shall ride with me,\" he shouted, clapping me on the back. \"Drink, now,\" and he produced a bottle of sotol about half full. \"Drink it all. Show you're a man.\" \"It's too much,\" I laughed. \"Drink it,\" yelled the chorus as the Tropa crowded up to see. I drank it. A howl of laughter and applause went up. Fernando leaned over and gripped my hand. \"Good for you, compa\u00f1ero!\" he bellowed, rolling with mirth. The men crowded around, amused and interested. Was I going to fight with them? Where did I come from? What was I doing? Most of them had never heard of reporters, and one hazarded the opinion darkly that I was a Gringo and a Porfirista, and ought to be shot.\n\nThe rest, however, were entirely opposed to this view. No Porfirista would possibly drink that much sotol at a gulp. Isidro Amayo declared that he had been in a brigade in the first Revolution which was accompanied by a reporter, and that he was called Corresponsal de Guerra. Did I like Mexico? I said: \"I am very fond of Mexico. I like Mexicans too. And I like sotol, aguardiente, mescal, tequila, pulque, and other Mexican customs!\" They shouted with laughter.\n\nCaptain Fernando leaned over and patted my arm. \"Now you are with the men (los hombres.) When we win the Revolucion it will be a government by the men,\u2014not by the rich. We are riding over the lands of the men. They used to belong to the rich, but now they belong to me and to the compa\u00f1eros.\"\n\n\"And you will be the army?\" I asked.\n\n\"When the Revolucion is won,\" was the astonishing reply, \"there will be no more army. The men are sick of armies. It is by armies that Don Porfirio robbed us.\"\n\n\"But if the United States should invade Mexico?\"\n\nA perfect storm broke everywhere. \"We are more valiente than the Americanos\u2014The cursed Gringos would get no further south than Juarez\u2014Let's see them try it\u2014We'd drive them back over the Border on the run, and burn their capital the next day...!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Fernando, \"you have more money and more soldiers. But the men would protect us. We need no army. The men would be fighting for their houses and their women.\"\n\n\"What are you fighting for?\" I asked. Juan Sanchez, the color-bearer, looked at me curiously. \"Why, it is good, fighting. You don't have to work in the mines...!\"\n\nManuel Paredes said: \"We are fighting to restore Francisco I. Madero to the Presidency.\" This extraordinary statement is printed in the program of the Revolution. And everywhere the Constitutionalist soldiers are known as \"Maderistas.\" \"I knew him,\" continued Manuel, slowly. \"He was always laughing, always.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said another, \"whenever there was any trouble with a man, and all the rest wanted to fight him or put him in prison, Pancho Madero said: 'Just let me talk to him a few minutes. I can bring him around.'\"\n\n\"He loved bailes,\" an Indian said. \"Many a time I've seen him dance all night, and all the next day, and the next night. He used to come to the great Haciendas and make speeches. When he began the peons hated him; when he ended they were crying....\"\n\nHere a man broke out into a droning, irregular tune, such as always accompanies the popular ballads that spring up in thousands on every occasion:\n\n\"In Nineteen hundred and ten Madero was imprisoned In the National Palace The eighteenth of February \"Four days he was imprisoned In the Hall of the Intendancy Because he did not wish To renounce the Presidency \"Then Blanquet and Felix Diaz Martyred him there They were the hangmen Feeding on his hate. \"They crushed.... Until he fainted With play of cruelty To make him resign. \"Then with hot irons They burned him without mercy And only unconsciousness Calmed the awful flames. \"But it was all in vain Because his mighty courage Preferred rather to die His was a great heart! \"This was the end of the life Of him who was the redeemer Of the Indian Republic And of all the poor. \"They took him out of the Palace And tell us he was killed in an assault What a cynicism! What a shameless lie! \"O Street of Lecumberri Your cheerfulness has ended forever For through you passed Madero To the Penitentiary. \"That twenty-second of February Will always be remembered in the Indian Republic. God has pardoned him And the Virgin of Guadelupe. \"Good-bye Beautiful Mexico Where our leader died Good-bye to the palace Whence he issued a living corpse \"Se\u00f1ores, there is nothing eternal Nor anything sincere in life See what happened to Don Francisco I. Madero!'\n\nBy the time he was half-way through, the entire Tropa was humming the tune, and when he finished there was a moment of jingling silence.\n\n\"We are fighting,\" said Isidro Amayo, \"for Libertad.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by Libertad?\"\n\n\"Libertad is when I can do what I want!\"\n\n\"But suppose it hurts somebody else?\"\n\nHe shot back at me Benito Juarez' great sentence:\n\n\"Peace is the respect for the rights of others!\"\n\nI wasn't prepared for that. It startled me, this barefooted meztizo's conception of Liberty. I submit that it is the only correct definition of Liberty\u2014to do what I want to! Americans quote it to me triumphantly as an instance of Mexican irresponsibility. But I think it is a better definition than ours\u2014Liberty is the right to do what the Courts want. Every Mexican schoolboy knows the definition of peace and seems to understand pretty well what it means, too. But, they say, Mexicans don't want peace. That is a lie, and a foolish one. Let Americans take the trouble to go through the Maderista army, asking whether they want peace or not! The people are sick of war.\n\nBut, just to be square, I'll have to report Juan Sanchez' remark:\n\n\"Is there war in the United States now?\" he asked.\n\n\"No,\" I said untruthfully.\n\n\"No war at all?\" He meditated for a moment. \"How do you pass the time, then...?\"\n\nJust about then somebody saw a coyote sneaking through the brush, and the entire Tropa gave chase with a whoop. They scattered rollicking over the desert, the late sun flashing from cartridge-belts and spurs, the ends of their bright serapes flying out behind. Beyond them, the scorched world sloped gently up, and a range of far lilac mountains jumped in the heat waves like a bucking horse. By here, if tradition is right, passed the steel-armored Spaniards in their search for gold, a blaze of crimson and silver that has left the desert cold and dull ever since. And, topping a rise, we came upon the first sight of the Hacienda of La Mimbrera, a walled enclosure of houses strong enough to stand a siege, stretching steeply down a hill, with the magnificent Casa Grande at the top.\n\nIn front of this house, which had been sacked and burned by Orozco's General, Che Che Campa, two years before, the coach was drawn up. A huge fire had been kindled, and ten compa\u00f1eros were slaughtering sheep. Into the red glare of the firelight they staggered, with the struggling, squealing sheep in their arms, its blood fountaining upon the ground, shining in the fierce light like something phosphorescent.\n\nThe officers and I dined in the house of the administrador Don Jesus, the most beautiful specimen of manhood I have ever seen. He was much over six feet tall, slender, white-skinned\u2014a pure Spanish type of the highest breed. At one end of his dining-room, I remember, hung a placard embroidered in red, white and green: \"Viva Mexico!\" and at the other, a second, which read: \"Viva Jesus!\"\n\nIt was after dinner, as I stood at the fire, wondering where I was to sleep, that Captain Fernando touched me on the arm.\n\n\"Will you sleep with the compa\u00f1eros?\"\n\nWe walked across the great open square, in the furious light of the desert stars, to a stone store-house set apart. Inside, a few candles stuck against the wall illumined the rifles stacked in the corners, the saddles on the floor, and the blanket-rolled compa\u00f1eros with their heads on them. One or two were awake, talking and smoking. In a corner, three sat muffled in their serapes, playing cards. Five or six had voices and a guitar. They were singing \"Pascual Orozco,\" beginning:\n\n\"They say that Pascual Orozco has turned his coat Because Don Terrazzas seduced him; They gave him many millions and they bought him And sent him to overthrow the government. \"Orozco believed it And to the war he went; But the Maderista cannon Was his calamity. \"If to thy window shall come Porfirio Diaz, Give him for charity some cold tortillas ; If to thy window shall come General Huerta, Spit in his face and slam the door. \"If to thy window shall come Inez Salazar, Lock your trunk so that he can't steal; If to thy window shall come Maclovio Herrera, Give him dinner and put the cloth on the table.\"\n\nThey didn't distinguish me at first, but soon one of the card-players said: \"Here comes Meester!\" At that the others roused, and woke the rest. \"That's right\u2014it's good to sleep with the hombres\u2014take this place, amigo\u2014here's my saddle\u2014here there is no crookedness\u2014here a man goes straight....\"\n\n\"May you pass a happy night, compa\u00f1ero,\" they said. \"Till morning, then.\"\n\nPretty soon somebody shut the door. The room became full of smoke and fetid with human breath. What little silence was left from the chorus of snoring was entirely obliterated by the singing, which kept up, I guess, until dawn. The compa\u00f1eros had fleas....\n\nBut I rolled up in my blankets and lay down upon the concrete floor very happily. And I slept better than I had before in Mexico.\n\nAt dawn we were in the saddle, larking up a steep roll of barren desert to get warm. It was bitter cold. The Tropa were wrapped in serapes up to their eyes, so that they looked like colored toadstools under their great sombreros. The level rays of the sun, burning as they fell upon my face, caught them unaware, glorifying the serapes to more brilliant colors than they possessed. Isidro Amayo's was of deep blue and yellow spirals; Juan Sanchez had one brick red, Captain Fernando's was green and cerise; against them flashed a purple and black zigzag pattern....\n\nWe looked back to see the coach pulled to a stop, and Patricio waving to us. Two of the mules had given out, raw from the traces, and tottering with the fatigue of the last two days. The Tropa scattered to look for mules. Soon they came back, driving two great beautiful animals that had never seen harness. No sooner had they smelled the coach than they made a desperate break for freedom. And now the Tropa instantly went back to their native profession\u2014they became vaqueros. It was a pretty sight, the rope-coils swinging in the air, the sudden snake-like shoot of the loops, the little horses bracing themselves against the shock of the running mule. Those mules were demons. Time after time they broke the riatas; twice they overturned horse and rider. Pablo came to the rescue. He got on Sabas's horse, drove in the spurs, and went after one mule. In three minutes he had roped him by the leg, thrown him, and tied him. Then he took the second with equal dispatch. It was not for nothing that Pablo was Lieutenant-Colonel at twenty-six. Not only could he fight better than his men, but he could ride better, rope better, shoot better, chop wood better, and dance better.\n\nThe mules' legs were tied, and they were dragged with ropes to the coach, where the harness was slipped on them in spite of their frantic struggles. When all was ready, Patricio got on the box, seized the whip, and told us to cut away. The wild animals scrambled to their feet, bucking and squealing. Above the uproar came the crack of the heavy whip, and Patricio's bellow: \"Andale! Ujos de la Gran' Ch\u2014\u2014!\" and they jerked forward, running, the big coach taking the arroyos like an express train. Soon it vanished behind its own pall of dust, and appeared hours afterward, crawling up the side of a great hill, miles away....\n\nPanchito was eleven years old, already a trooper with a rifle too heavy for him, and a horse that they had to lift him on. His compadre was Victoriano, a veteran of fourteen. Seven others of the Tropa were under seventeen. And there was a sullen, Indian-faced woman, riding side-saddle, who wore two cartridge-belts. She rode with the hombres\u2014slept with them in the cuartels.\n\n\"Why are you fighting?\" I asked her.\n\nShe jerked her head toward the fierce figure of Julian Reyes.\n\n\"Because he is,\" she answered. \"He who stands under a good tree is sheltered by a good shade.\"\n\n\"A good rooster will crow in any chicken-coop,\" capped Isidro.\n\n\"A parrot is green all over,\" chimed in someone else.\n\n\"Faces we see, but hearts we do not comprehend,\" said Jos\u00e9, sentimentally.\n\nAt noon we roped a steer, and cut his throat. And because there was no time to build a fire, we ripped the meat from the carcase and ate it raw.\n\n\"Oiga, meester,\" shouted Jos\u00e9. \"Do the United States soldiers eat raw meat?\"\n\nI said I didn't think they did.\n\n\"It is good for the hombres. In the campaign we have no time for anything but carne crudo. It makes us brave.\"\n\nBy late afternoon we had caught up with the coach, and galloped with it down through the dry arroyo and up through the other side, past the great ribota court that flanks the Hacienda of La Zarca. Unlike La Mimbrera, the Casa Grande here stands on a level place, with the peons' houses in long rows at its flanks, and a flat desert barren of chaparral for twenty miles in front. Che Che Campa also paid a visit to La Zarca. The big house is a black and gaping ruin.\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nWHITE NIGHTS AT ZARCA\n\nOf course, I took up quarters at the cuartel. And right here I want to mention one fact. Americans had insisted that the Mexican was fundamentally dishonest\u2014that I might expect to have my outfit stolen the first day out. Now for two weeks I lived with as rough a band of ex-outlaws as there was in the army. They were without discipline and without education. They were, many of them, Gringo-haters. They had not been paid a cent for six weeks, and some were so desperately poor that they couldn't boast sandals or serapes. I was a stranger with a good outfit, unarmed. I had a hundred and fifty pesos, which I put conspicuously at the head of my bed when I slept. And I never lost a thing. But more than that, I was not permitted to pay for my food; and in a company where money was scarce and tobacco almost unknown, I was kept supplied with all I could smoke by the compa\u00f1eros. Every suggestion from me that I should pay for it was an insult.\n\nThe only thing possible was to hire music for a baile. Long after Juan Sanchez and I rolled up in our blankets that night, we could hear the rhythm of the music, and the shouts of the dancers. It must have been midnight when somebody threw open the door and yelled: \"Meester! Oiga, meester! Are you asleep? Come to the baile! Arriba! Andale!\"\n\n\"Too sleepy!\" I said. After some further argument the messenger departed, but in ten minutes back he came. \"El Capitan Fernando orders you to come at once! Vamonos!\" Now the others woke up. \"Come to the baile, meester!\" they shouted. Juan Sanchez sat up and began pulling on his shoes. \"Now we're off!\" said he. \"The meester is going to dance! Captain's orders! Come on, meester!\"\n\n\"I'll go if all the Tropa does,\" I said. They raised a yell at that, and the night was full of chuckling men pulling on their clothes.\n\nTwenty of us reached the house in a body. The mob of peons blocking door and window opened to let us pass. \"The meester!\" they cried. \"The meester's going to dance!\"\n\nCapitan Fernando threw his arms about me, roaring: \"Here he comes, the compa\u00f1ero! Dance now! Go to it! They're going to dance the jota!\"\n\n\"But I don't know how to dance the jota!\"\n\nPatricio, flushed and panting, seized me by the arm. \"Come on, it's easy! I'll introduce you to the best girl in the Zarca!\"\n\nThere was nothing to do. The window was jammed with faces, and a hundred tried to crowd in at the door. It was an ordinary room in a peon's house, whitewashed, with a humpy dirt floor. In the light of two candles sat the musicians. The music struck up \"Puentes \u00e1 Chihuahua.\" A grinning silence fell. I gathered the young lady under my arm, and started the preliminary march around the room customary before the dance begins. We waltzed painfully for a moment or two, and suddenly they all began to yell: \"Ora! Ora! Now!\"\n\n\"What do you do now?\"\n\n\"Vuelta! Vuelta! Loose her!\" a perfect yell.\n\n\"But I don't know how!\"\n\n\"The fool doesn't know how to dance,\" cried one.\n\nAnother began the mocking song:\n\n\"The Gringos all are fools, They've never been in Sonora, And when they want to say: 'Diez Reales,' They call it 'Dollar an' a quarta' ....\"\n\nBut Patricio bounded into the middle of the floor, and Sabas after him; each seized a muchacha from the line of women sitting along one end of the room. And as I led my partner back to her seat, they \"vuelta'd.\" First a few waltz steps,\u2014then the man whirled away from the girl, snapping his fingers, throwing one arm up to cover his face, while the girl put one hand on her hip and danced after him. They approached each other, receded, danced around each other. The girls were dumpy and dull, Indian-faced and awkward, bowed at the shoulder from much grinding of corn and washing of clothes. Some of the men had on heavy boots, some none; many wore pistols and cartridge-belts, and a few carried rifles slung from their shoulders.\n\nThe dance was always preceded by a grand march-around; then, after the couple had danced twice the circuit of the room, they walked again. There were two-steps, waltz and mazurka beside the jota. Each girl kept her eyes on the ground, never spoke, and stumbled heavily after you. Add to this a dirt floor full of arroyos, and you have a form of torture unequaled anywhere in the world. It seemed to me I danced for hours, spurred on by the chorus: \"Dance, meester! No floje! Keep it up! Don't quit!\"\n\nLater there was another jota, and here's where I almost got into trouble. I danced this one successfully\u2014with another girl. And, afterward, when I asked my original partner to two-step, she was furiously angry.\n\n\"You shamed me before them all,\" said she. \"You\u2014you said you didn't know how to dance the jota!\" As we marched around the room, she appealed to her friends: \"Domingo! Juan! Come out and take me away from this Gringo! He won't dare to do anything!\"\n\nHalf a dozen of them started onto the floor, and the rest looked on. It was a ticklish moment. But all at once the good Fernando glided in front, a revolver in his hand.\n\n\"The Americano is my friend!\" said he. \"Get back there and mind your business!...\"\n\nThe horses were tired, so we rested a day in La Zarca. Behind the Casa Grande lay a ruined garden, full of gray alamo trees, figs, vines, and great barrel-cactuses. It was walled around by high adobe walls on three sides, over one of which the ancient white tower of the church floated in the blue sky. The fourth side opened upon a reservoir of yellow water, and beyond it stretched the western desert, miles upon miles of tawny desolation. Trooper Marin and I lay under a fig tree, watching the vultures sail over us on quiet wing. Suddenly the silence was broken by loud, swift music.\n\nPablo had found a pianola in the church, where it had escaped Che Che Campa's notice the previous year; with it was one roll, the \"Merry Widow Waltz.\" Nothing would do but that we carry the instrument out into the ruined patio. We took turns playing the thing all day long; Rafaelito volunteering the information that the \"Merry Widow\" was Mexico's most popular piece. A Mexican, he said, had composed it.\n\nThe finding of the pianola suggested that we give another baile that night, in the portico of the Casa Grande itself. Candles were stuck upon the pillars, the faint light flickering upon broken walls, burned and blackened doorways, the riot of wild vines that had twisted unchecked around the roof-beams. The entire patio was crowded with blanketed men, making holiday, even yet a little uncomfortable in the great house which they had never been allowed to enter. As soon as the orchestra had finished a dance, the pianola immediately took up the task. Dance followed dance, without any rest. A barrel of sotol further complicated things. As the evening wore on the assembly got more and more exhilarated. Sabas, who was Pablo's orderly, led off with Pablo's mistress. I followed. Immediately afterward Pablo hit her on the head with the butt end of his revolver, and said he'd shoot her if she danced with anyone else, and her partner too. After sitting some moments meditating, Sabas rose, pulled his revolver, and informed the harpist that he had played a wrong note. Then he shot at him. Other compa\u00f1eros disarmed Sabas, who immediately went to sleep in the middle of the dance-floor.\n\nThe interest in Meester's dancing soon shifted to other phenomena. I sat down beside Julian Reyes, he with the Christ and Virgin on the front of his sombrero. He was far gone in sotol\u2014his eyes burned like a fanatic's.\n\nHe turned on me suddenly:\n\n\"Are you going to fight with us?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"I am a correspondent. I am forbidden to fight.\"\n\n\"It is a lie,\" he cried. \"You don't fight because you are afraid to fight. In the face of God, our Cause is Just.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know that. But my orders are not to fight.\"\n\n\"What do I care for orders?\" he shrieked. \"We want no correspondents. We want no words printed in a book. We want rifles and killing, and if we die we shall be caught up among the saints! Coward! Huertista!...\"\n\n\"That's enough!\" cried someone, and I looked up to see Longinos G\u00fcereca standing over me. \"Julian Reyes, you know nothing. This compa\u00f1ero comes thousands of miles by the sea and the land to tell his countrymen the truth of the fight for Liberty. He goes into battle without arms, he's braver than you are, because you have a rifle. Get out now, and don't bother him any more!\"\n\nHe sat down where Julian had been, smiled his homely, gentle smile, and took both my hands in his.\n\n\"We shall be compadres, eh?\" said Longinos G\u00fcereca. \"We shall sleep in the same blankets, and always be together. And when we get to the Cadena I shall take you to my home, and my father shall make you my brother.... I will show you the lost gold-mines of the Spaniards, the richest mines in the world.... We'll work them together, eh? ... We'll be rich, eh?...\"\n\nAnd from that time on until the end, Longinos G\u00fcereca and I were always together.\n\nBut the baile grew wilder and wilder. Orchestra and pianola alternated without a break. Everybody was drunk now. Pablo was boasting horribly of killing defenseless prisoners. Occasionally, some insult would be passed, and there would be a snapping of rifle levers all over the place. Then perhaps the poor exhausted women would begin to go home; and what an ominous shout would go up: \"No vaya! Don't go! Stop! Come back here and dance! Come back here!\" And the dejected procession would halt and straggle back. At four o'clock, when somebody started the report that a Gringo Huertista spy was among us, I decided to go to bed. But the baile kept up until seven....\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\"QUIEN VIVE?\"\n\nAt dawn I woke to the sound of shooting, and a cracked bugle blowing wildly. Juan Sanchez stood in front of the cuartel, sounding Reveille; he didn't know which call Reveille was, so he played them all.\n\nPatricio had roped a steer for breakfast. The animal started on a plunging, bellowing run for the desert, Patricio's horse galloping alongside. The rest of the Tropa, only their eyes showing over their serapes, kneeled with their rifles to their shoulders. Crash! In that still air, the enormous sound of guns labored heavily up. The running steer jerked sideways,\u2014his screaming reached us faintly. Crash! He fell headlong. His feet kicked in the air. Patricio's pony jerked roughly up, and his serape flapped like a banner. Just then the enormous sun rose bodily out of the east, pouring clear light over the barren plain like a sea....\n\nPablo emerged from the Casa Grande, leaning on his wife's shoulder.\n\n\"I am going to be very ill,\" he groaned, suiting the action to the word. \"Juan Reed will ride my horse.\"\n\nHe got into the coach, weakly took the guitar, and sang:\n\n\"I remained at the foot of a green maguey My ungrateful love went away with another. I awoke to the song of the lark: Oh, what a hangover I have, and the barkeeps won't trust me! \"O God, take away this sickness, I feel as if I were surely going to die\u2014 The Virgin of pulque and whisky must save me: O what a hangover, and nothing to drink!...\"\n\nIt is some sixty-five miles from La Zarca to the Hacienda of La Cadena, where the Tropa was to be stationed. We rode it in one day, without water and without food. The coach soon left us far behind. Pretty soon, the barrenness of the land gave way to spiny, hostile vegetation,\u2014the cactus and the mesquite. We strung out along a deep rut between the gigantic chaparral, choked with the mighty cloud of alkali dust, scratched and torn by the thorny brush. Sometimes emerging in an open space, we could see the straight road climbing the summits of the rolling desert, until the eye couldn't follow it; but we knew it must be there, still farther and farther again. Not a breath of wind stirred. The vertical sun beat down with a fury that made one reel. And most of the troop, who had been drunk the night before, began to suffer terribly. Their lips glazed, cracked, turned dark blue. I didn't hear a single word of complaint; but there was nothing of the lighthearted joking and rollicking of other days. Jos\u00e9 Valiente taught me how to chew mesquite twigs, but that didn't help much.\n\nWhen we had been riding for hours, Fidencio pointed ahead, saying huskily: \"Here comes a christiano!\" When you realize that word christiano, which now means simply Man, is descended among the Indians from immeasurable antiquity,\u2014and when the man that says it looks exactly as Guatemozin might have looked, it gives you curious sensations. The christiano in question was a very aged Indian driving a burro. No, he said, he didn't carry any water. But Sabas leaped from his horse and tumbled the old man's pack on the ground.\n\n\"Ah!\" he cried; \"fine! Tres piedras!\" and held up a root of the sotol plant, which looks like a varnished century-plant, and oozes with intoxicating juices. We divided it as you divide an artichoke. Pretty soon everybody felt better....\n\nIt was at the end of the afternoon that we rounded a shoulder of the desert and saw ahead the gigantic ashen alamo trees that surrounded the spring of the Hacienda of Santo Domingo. A pillar of brown dust, like the smoke of a burning city, rose from the corral, where vaqueros were roping horses. Desolate and alone stood the Casa Grande, burned by Che Che Campa a year ago. And by the spring, at the foot of the alamo trees, a dozen wandering peddlers squatted around their fire, their burros munching corn. From the fountain to the adobe houses and back moved an endless chain of women water-carriers,\u2014the symbol of northern Mexico.\n\n\"Water!\" we shouted, joyously, galloping down the hill. The coach-horses were already at the spring with Patricio. Leaping from their saddles, the Tropa threw themselves on their bellies. Men and horses indiscriminately thrust in their heads, and drank and drank.... It was the most glorious sensation I have ever felt.\n\n\"Who has a cigarro?\" cried somebody. For a few blessed minutes we lay on our backs smoking. The sound of music\u2014gay music\u2014made me sit up. And there, across my vision, moved the strangest procession in the world. First came a ragged peon carrying the flowering branch of some tree. Behind him, another bore upon his head a little box that looked like a coffin, painted in broad strips of blue, pink and silver. There followed four men, carrying a sort of canopy made of gay-colored bunting. A woman walked beneath it, though the canopy hid her down to the waist; but on top lay the body of a little girl, with bare feet and little brown hands crossed on her breast. There was a wreath of paper flowers in her hair, and her whole body was heaped with them. A harpist brought up the rear, playing a popular waltz called \"Recuerdos de Durango.\" The funeral procession moved slowly and gaily along, passing the ribota court, where the players never ceased their handball game, to the little Campo Santo. \"Bah!\" spat Julian Reyes furiously. \"That is a blasphemy to the dead!\"\n\nIn the late sunshine the desert was a glowing thing. We rode in a silent, enchanted land, that seemed some kingdom under the sea. All around were great cactuses colored red, blue, purple, yellow, as coral is on the ocean bed. Behind us, to the west, the coach rolled along in a glory of dust like Elijah's chariot.... Eastward, under a sky already darkening to stars, were the rumpled mountains behind which lay La Cadena, the advance post of the Maderista army. It was a land to love\u2014this Mexico\u2014a land to fight for. The ballad-singers suddenly began the interminable song of \"The Bull-Fight,\" in which the Federal chiefs are the bulls, and the Maderista generals the torreros; and as I looked at the gay, lovable, humble hombres who had given so much of their lives and of their comfort to the brave fight, I couldn't help but think of the little speech Villa made to the foreigners who left Chihuahua in the first refugee train:\n\n\"This is the latest news for you to take to your people. There shall be no more palaces in Mexico. The tortillas of the poor are better than the bread of the rich. Come!...\"\n\nIt was late night\u2014past eleven\u2014when the coach broke down on a stretch of rocky road between high mountains. I stopped to get my blankets; and when I started on again, the compa\u00f1eros had long vanished down the winding road. Somewhere near, I knew, was La Cadena. At any minute now a sentinel might start up out of the chaparral. For about a mile I descended a steep road that was often the dried bed of a river, winding down between high mountains. It was a black night, without stars, and bitter cold. Finally, the mountains opened into a vast plain, and across that I could faintly see the tremendous range of the Cadena, and the pass that the Tropa was to guard. Barely three leagues beyond that pass lay Mapimi, held by twelve hundred Federals. But the hacienda was still hidden by a roll of the desert.\n\nI was quite upon it, without being challenged, before I saw it, an indistinct white square of buildings on the other side of a deep arroyo. And still no sentinel. \"That's funny,\" I said to myself. \"They don't keep very good watch here.\" I plunged down into the arroyo, and climbed up the other side. In one of the great rooms of the Casa Grande were lights and music. Peering through, I saw the indefatigable Sabas whirling in the mazes of the jota, and Isidro Amayo, and Jos\u00e9 Valiente. A baile! Just then a man with a gun lounged out of the lighted doorway.\n\n\"Quien vive?\" he shouted, lazily.\n\n\"Madero!\" I shouted.\n\n\"May he live!\" returned the sentinel, and went back to the baile....\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nAN OUTPOST OF THE REVOLUTION\n\nThere were a hundred and fifty of us stationed at La Cadena, the advance guard of all the Maderista army to the West. Our business was to guard a pass, the Puerta de la Cadena; but the troops were quartered at the hacienda, ten miles away. It stood upon a little plateau, a deep arroyo on one side, at the bottom of which a sunken river came to the surface for perhaps a hundred yards, and vanished again. As far as the eye could reach up and down the broad valley was the fiercest kind of desert,\u2014dried creek-beds, and a thicket of chaparral, cactus and sword plant.\n\nDirectly east lay the Puerta, breaking the tremendous mountain range that blotted out half the sky and extended north and south beyond vision, wrinkled like a giant's bed-clothes. The desert tilted up to meet the gap, and beyond was nothing but the fierce blue of stainless Mexican sky. From the Puerta you could see fifty miles across the vast arid plain that the Spaniards named Llano de los Gigantes, where the little mountains lie tumbled about; and four leagues away the low gray houses of Mapimi. There lay the enemy; twelve hundred colorados, or Federal irregulars, under the infamous Colonel Argumendo. The colorados are the bandits that made Orozco's revolution. They were so called because their flag was red, and because their hands were red with slaughter, too. They swept through Northern Mexico, burning, pillaging and robbing the poor. In Chihuahua, they cut the soles from the feet of one poor devil, and drove him a mile across the desert before he died. And I have seen a city of four thousand souls reduced to five after a visit by the colorados. When Villa took Torreon, there was no mercy for the colorados; they are always shot.\n\nThe first day we reached La Cadena, twelve of them rode up to reconnoiter. Twenty-five of the Tropa were on guard at the Fuerta. They captured one colorado. They made him get off his horse, and took away his rifle, clothes and shoes. THen they made him run naked through a hundred yards of chaparral and cactus, shooting at him. Juan Sanchez finally dropped him, screaming, and thereby won the rifle, which he brought back as a present to me. The colorado they left to the great Mexican buzzards, which flap lazily above the desert all day long.\n\nWhen all this happened, my compadre, Captain Longinos G\u00fcereca, and Trooper Juan Vallejo, and I, had borrowed the Colonel's coach for a trip to the dusty little rancho of Bruquilla,\u2014Longinos' home. It lay four desert leagues to the north, where a spring burst miraculously out of a little white hill. Old G\u00fcereca was a white-haired peon in sandals. He had been born a slave on one of the great haciendas; but years of toil, too appalling to realize, had made him that rare being in Mexico, the independent owner of a small property. He had ten children,\u2014soft, dark-skinned girls, and sons that looked like New England farmhands,\u2014and a daughter in the grave.\n\nThe G\u00fcerecas were proud, ambitious, warm-hearted folk. Longinos said: \"This is my dearly loved friend, Juan Reed, and my brother.\" And the old man and his wife put both their arms around me and patted me on the back, in the affectionate way Mexicans embrace.\n\n\"My family owes nothing to the Revolucion,\" said 'Gino, proudly. \"Others have taken money and horses and wagons. The jefes of the army have become rich from the property of the great haciendas. The G\u00fcerecas have given all to the Maderistas, and have taken nothing but my rank....\"\n\nThe old man, however, was a little bitter. Holding up a horsehair rope, he said: \"Three years ago I had four riatas like this. Now I have only one. One the colorados took, and the other Urbina's people took, and the last one Jos\u00e9 Bravo.... What difference does it make which side robs you?\" But he didn't mean it all. He was immensely proud of his youngest son, the bravest officer in all the army.\n\nWe sat in the long adobe room, eating the most exquisite cheese, and tortillas with fresh goat-butter,\u2014the deaf old mother apologizing in a loud voice for the poverty of the food, and her warlike son reciting his personal Iliad of the nine-days' fight around Torreon.\n\n\"We got so close,\" he was saying, \"that the hot air and burning powder stung us in the face. We got too close to shoot, so we clubbed our rifles\u2014\u2014\" Just then all the dogs began to bark at once. We leaped from our seats. One didn't know what to expect in the Cadena those days. It was a small boy on horseback, shouting that the colorados were entering the Puerta\u2014and off he galloped.\n\nLonginos roared to put the mules in the coach. The entire family fell to work with a fury, and in five minutes Longinos dropped on one knee and kissed his father's hand, and we were tearing down the road. \"Don't be killed! Don't be killed! Don't be killed!\" we could hear the Se\u00f1ora wailing.\n\nWe passed a wagon loaded with corn-stalks, with a whole family of women and children, two tin trunks, and an iron bed, perched on top. The man of the family rode a burro. Yes, the colorados were coming\u2014thousands of them pouring through the Puerta. The last time the colorados had come they had killed his daughter. For three years there had been war in this valley, and he had not complained. Because it was for the Patria. Now they would go to the United States where\u2014\u2014 But Juan lashed the mules cruelly, and we heard no more. Farther along was an old man without shoes, placidly driving some goats. Had he heard about the colorados? Well, there had been some gossip about colorados. Were they coming through the Puerta, and how many?\n\n\"Pues, quien sabe, se\u00f1or!\"\n\nAt last, yelling at the staggering mules, we came into camp just in time to see the victorious Tropa straggle in across the desert, firing off many more rounds of ammunition than they had used in the fight. They moved low along the ground, scarcely higher on their broncos than the drab mesquite through which they flashed, all big sombreros and flapping gay serapes, the last sunshine on their lifted rifles.\n\nThat very night came a courier from General Urbina, saying that he was ill and wanted Pablo Sea\u00f1es to come back. So off went the great coach, and Pablo's mistress, and Raphaelito, the hunchback, and Fidencio, and Patricio. Pablo said to me: \"Juanito, if you want to come back with us, you shall sit beside me in the coach.\" Patricio and Raphaelito begged me to come. But I had got so far to the front now that I didn't want to turn back. Then the next day my friends and compa\u00f1eros of the Tropa, whom I had learned to know so well in our march across the desert, received orders to move to Jarralitos. Only Juan Vallejo and Longinos G\u00fcereca stayed behind.\n\nThe Cadena's new garrison were a different kind of men. God knows where they came from, but it was a place where the troopers had literally starved. They were the most wretchedly poor peons that I have ever seen\u2014about half of them didn't have serapes. Some fifty were known to be nuevos who had never smelt powder, about the same number were under a dreadfully incompetent old party named Major Salazar, and the remaining fifty were equipped with old carbines and ten rounds of ammunition apiece. Our commanding officer was Lieutenant-Colonel Petronilo Hernandez, who had been six years a Major in the Federal army until the murder of Madero drove him to the other side. He was a brave, good-hearted little man, with twisted shoulders, but years of official army red tape had unfitted him to handle troops like these. Every morning he issued an Order of the Day, distributing guards, posting sentinels, and naming the officer on duty. Nobody ever read it. Officers in that army have nothing to do with the disciplining or ordering of soldiers, They are officers because they have been brave, and their job is to fight at the head of their troop\u2014that's all. The soldiers all look up to some one General, under whom they are recruited, as to their feudal lord. They call themselves his gente\u2014his people; and an officer of anybody else's gente hasn't much authority over them. Petronilo was of Urbina's gente; but two-thirds of the Cadena garrison belonged to Arrieta's division. That's why there were no sentinels to the west and north. Lieutenant-Colonel Alberto Redondo guarded another pass four leagues to the south, so we thought we were safe in that direction. True, twenty-five men did outpost duty at the Fuerta, and the Puerta was strong....\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE FIVE MUSKETEERS\n\nThe Casa Grande of La Cadena had been sacked, of course, by Che Che Campa the year before. In the patio were corraled the officers' horses. We slept on the tiled floors of the rooms surrounding it. In the sala of the owner, once barbarically decorated, pegs were driven into the walls to hang saddles and bridles on, rifles and sabers were stacked against the wall, and dirty blanket-rolls lay flung into the corner. At night a fire of corn-cobs was built in the middle of the floor, and we squatted around it, while Apolinario and fourteen-year-old Gil Tomas, who was once a colorado, told stories of the Bloody Three Years.\n\n\"At the taking of Durango,\" said Apolinario, \"I was of the gente of Captain Borunda; he that they call the Matador, because he always shoots his prisoners. But when Urbina took Durango there weren't many prisoners. So Borunda, thirsty for blood, made the rounds of all the saloons. And in every one he would pick out some unarmed man and ask him if he were a Federal. 'No, se\u00f1or,' the man would say. 'You deserve death because you have not told the truth!' yelled Borunda, pulling his gun. Bang!\"\n\nWe all laughed heartily at this.\n\n\"That reminds me,\" broke in Gil, \"of the time I fought with Rojas in Orozco's\u2014(cursed be his mother!)\u2014Revolucion. An old Porfirista officer deserted to our side, and Orozco sent him out to teach the colorados (animals!) how to drill. There was one droll fellow in our company. Oh! he had a fine sense of humor. He pretended he was too stupid to learn the manual of arms. So this cursed old Huertista\u2014(may he fry in hell!)\u2014made him drill alone.\n\n\"'Shoulder arms!' The companero did it all right.\n\n\"'Present arms!' Perfectly.\n\n\"'Port arms!' He acted like he didn't know how, so the old fool went around and took hold of the rifle.\n\n\"'This way!' says he, pulling on it.\n\n\"'Oh!' says the fellow, 'that way!' And he let him have the bayonet right in the chest....\"\n\nAfter that Fernando Silveyra, the paymaster, recounted a few anecdotes of the curas, or priests, that sounded exactly like Touraine in the thirteenth century, or the feudal rights of landlords over their women tenants before the French Revolution. Fernando ought to have known, too, for he was brought up for the Church. There must have been about twenty of us sitting around that fire, all the way from the most miserably poor peon in the Tropa up to First Captain Longinos G\u00fcereca. There wasn't one of these men who had any religion at all, although once they had all been strict Catholics. But three years of war have taught the Mexican people many things. There will never be another Porfirio Diaz; there will never be another Orozco Revolution; and the Catholic Church in Mexico will never again be the voice of God.\n\nThen Juan Santillanes, a twenty-two-year-old subteniente, who seriously informed me that he was descended from the great Spanish hero, Gil Blas, piped up the ancient disreputable ditty, which begins:\n\n\"I am Count Oliveros Of the Spanish artillery....\"\n\nJuan proudly displayed four bullet wounds. He had killed a few defenseless prisoners with his own gun, he said; giving promise of growing up to be muy matador (a great killer) some day. He boasted of being the strongest and bravest man in the army. His idea of humor seemed to be breaking eggs into the pocket of my coat. Juan was very young for his years, but very likable.\n\nBut the best friend I had beside 'Gino G\u00fcereca was Subteniente Luis Martinez. They called him \"Gachupine\"\u2014the contemptuous name for Spaniards\u2014because he might have stepped out of a portrait of some noble Spanish youth by Greco. Luis was pure race\u2014sensitive, gay and high-spirited. He was only twenty, and had never been in battle. Around the contour of his face was a faint black beard.\n\nHe fingered it, grinning. \"Nicanor and I made a bet that we wouldn't shave until we took Torreon....\"\n\nLuis and I slept in different rooms. But at night, when the fire had gone out and the rest of the fellows were snoring, we sat at each other's blankets\u2014one night in his cuartel, the one next to mine\u2014talking about the world, our girls, and what we were going to be and to do when we really got at it. When the war was over, Luis was coming to the United States to visit me; and then we were both coming back to Durango City to visit the Martinez family. He showed me the photograph of a little baby, proudly boasting that he was an uncle already. \"What will you do when the bullets begin to fly?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Quien sabe?\" he laughed. \"I guess I'll run!\"\n\nIt was late. The sentinel at the door had long since gone to sleep. \"Don't go,\" said Luis, grabbing my coat. \"Let's gossip a little longer....\"\n\n'Gino, Juan Santillanes, Silveyra, Luis, Juan Vallejo and I rode up the arroyo to bathe in a pool that was rumored to be there. It was a scorched river bed filled with white-hot sand, rimmed with dense mesquite and cactus. Every kilometer the hidden river showed itself for a little space, only to disappear at a crackling white rim of alkali. First came the horse pool, the troopers and their wretched ponies gathered around it; one or two squatting on the rim, scooping water up against the animals' sides with calabashes.... Above them kneeled the women at their eternal laundry on the stones. Beyond that the ancient path from the hacienda cut across, where the never-ending line of black-shawled women moved with water-jars on their heads. Still farther up were women bathers, wrapped round and round with yards of pale blue or white cotton, and naked brown babies splashing in the shallows. And, last of all, naked brown men, with sombreros on and bright-colored serapes draped over their shoulders, smoked their hojas, squatting on the rocks. We flushed a coyote up there, and scrambled steeply up to the desert, pulling at our revolvers. There he went! We spurred into the chaparral on the dead run, shooting and yelling. But of course he got away. And later, much later, we found the mythical pool\u2014a cool, deep basin worn in the solid rock, with green weeds growing on the bottom.\n\nWhen we got back, 'Gino G\u00fcereca became greatly excited, because his new tordillo horse had come from Bruquilla\u2014a four-year-old stallion that his father had raised for him to ride at the head of his company.\n\n\"If he is dangerous,\" announced Juan Santillanes, as we hurried out, \"I want to ride him first. I love to subdue dangerous horses!\"\n\nA mighty cloud of yellow dust filled all the corral, rising high into the still air. Through it appeared the dim chaotic shapes of many running horses. Their hoofs made dull thunder. Men were vaguely visible, all braced legs and swinging arms, handkerchiefs bound over their faces; wide-spreading rope coils lifted, circling. The big gray felt the loop tighten on his neck. He trumpeted and plunged; the vaquero twisted the rope around his hip, lying back almost to the ground, feet plowing the dirt. Another noose gripped the horse's hind legs\u2014and he was down. They put a saddle on him and a rope halter.\n\n\"Want to ride him, Juanito?\" grinned 'Gino.\n\n\"After you,\" answered Juan with dignity. \"He's your horse....\"\n\nBut Juan Vallejo already was astride, shouting to them to loose the ropes. With a sort of squealing roar, the tordillo struggled up, and the earth trembled to his furious fight.\n\nWe dined in the ancient kitchen of the hacienda, sitting on stools around a packing box. The ceiling was a rich, greasy brown, from the smoke of generations of meals. One entire end of the room was taken up by immense adobe stoves, ovens, and fireplaces, with four or five ancient crones bending over them, stirring pots and turning tortillas. The fire was our only light, flickering strangely over the old women; lighting up the black wall, up which the smoke fled, to wreathe around the ceiling and finally pour from the window. There were Colonel Petronilo, his mistress, a strangely beautiful peasant woman with a pock-marked face, who always seemed to be laughing to herself about something; Don Tomas, Luis Martinez, Colonel Redondo, Major Salazar, Nicanor, and I. The Colonel's mistress seemed uncomfortable at the table; for a Mexican peasant woman is a servant in her house. But Don Petronilo always treated her as if she were a great lady.\n\nRedondo had just been telling me about the girl he was going to marry. He showed me her picture. She was even then on her way to Chihuahua to get her wedding dress. \"As soon as we take Torreon,\" he said.\n\n\"Oiga, se\u00f1or!\" Salazar touched me on the arm. \"I have found out who you are. You are an agent of American business men who have vast interests in Mexico. I know all about American business. You are an agent of the trusts. You come down here to spy upon the movement of our troops, and then you will secretly send them word. Is it not true?\"\n\n\"How could I secretly send anybody any word from here?\" I asked. \"We're four days' hard ride from a telegraph line.\"\n\n\"Ah, I know,\" he grinned cunningly, wabbling a finger at me. \"I know many things; I have much in the head.\" He was standing up now. The Major suffered badly from gout; his legs were wrapped in yards and yards of woolen bandages, which made them look like tamales. \"I know all about business. I have studied much in my youth. These American trusts are invading Mexico to rob the Mexican people\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"You're mistaken, Major,\" interrupted Don Petronilo sharply. \"This se\u00f1or is my friend and my guest.\"\n\n\"Listen, mi Coronel,\" Salazar burst out with unexpected violence. \"This se\u00f1or is a spy. All Americans are Porfiristas and Huertistas. Take this warning before it is too late. I have much in the head. I am a very smart man. Take this Gringo out and shoot him\u2014at once. Or you will regret it.\"\n\nA clamor of voices burst out all together from the others, but it was interrupted by another sound\u2014a shot, and then another, and men shouting.\n\nCame a trooper running. \"Mutiny in the ranks!\" he cried. \"They won't obey orders!\"\n\n\"Who won't?\" snapped Don Petronilo.\n\n\"The gente of Salazar!\"\n\n\"Bad people!\" exclaimed Nicanor as we ran. \"They were colorados captured when we took Torreon. Joined us so we wouldn't kill 'em. Ordered out tonight to guard the Puerta!\"\n\n\"Till to-morrow,\" said Salazar at this point, \"I'm going to bed!\"\n\nThe peons' houses at La Cadena, where the troops were quartered, enclosed a great square, like a walled town. There were two gates. At one we forced our way through a mob of women and peons fighting to get out. Inside, there were dim lights from doorways, and three or four little fires in the open air. A bunch of frightened horses crowded one another in a corner. Men ran wildly in and out of their cuartels, with rifles in their hands. In the center of the open space stood a group of about fifty men, mostly armed, as if to repel an attack.\n\n\"Guard those gates!\" cried the Colonel. \"Don't let anybody out without an order from me!\" The running troops began to mass at the gates. Don Petronilo walked out alone into the middle of the square.\n\n\"What's the trouble, compa\u00f1eros?\" he asked quietly.\n\n\"They were going to kill us all!\" yelled somebody from the darkness. \"They wanted to escape! They were going to betray us to the colorados!\"\n\n\"It's a lie!\" cried those in the center. \"We are not Don Petronilo's gente! Our jefe is Manuel Arrieta!\"\n\nSuddenly Longinos G\u00fcereca, unarmed, flashed by us and fell upon them furiously, wrenching away their rifles and throwing them far behind. For a moment it looked as if the rebels would turn on him, but they did not resist.\n\n\"Disarm them!\" ordered Don Petronilo. \"And lock them up!\"\n\nThey herded the prisoners into one large room, with an armed guard at the door. And long after midnight I could hear them hilariously singing.\n\nThat left Don Petronilo with a hundred effectives, some extra horses with running sores on their backs, and two thousand rounds of ammunition, more or less. Salazar took himself off in the morning, after recommending that all his gente be shot; he was evidently greatly relieved to be rid of them. Juan Santillanes was in favor of execution, too. But Don Petronilo decided to send them to General Urbina for trial.\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE LAST NIGHT\n\nThe days at La Cadena were full of color. In the cold dawn, when the river pools were filmed with ice, a trooper would gallop into the great square with a plunging steer at the end of his rope. Fifty or sixty ragged soldiers, only their eyes showing between serapes and big sombreros, would begin an amateur bull-fight, to the roaring delight of the rest of the compa\u00f1eros. They waved their blankets, shouting the correct bull-fight cries. One would twist the infuriated animal's tail. Another, more impatient, beat him with the flat of a sword. Instead of banderillas, they stuck daggers into his shoulder\u2014his hot blood spattering them as he charged. And when at last he was down and the merciful knife in his brain, a mob fell upon the carcase, cutting and ripping, and bearing off chunks of raw meat to their cuartels. Then the white, burning sun would rise suddenly behind the Puerta, stinging your hands and face. And the pools of blood, the faded patterns of the serapes, the far reaches of umber desert glowed and became vivid....\n\nDon Petronilo had confiscated several coaches in the campaign. We borrowed them for many an excursion\u2014the five of us. Once it was a trip to San Pedro del Gallo to see a cock-fight, appropriately enough. Another time 'Gino G\u00fcereca and I went to see the fabulously rich lost mines of the Spaniards, which he knew. But we never got past Bruquilla\u2014j"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Reed", "page_content": "John Reed, (born Oct. 22, 1887, Portland, Ore., U.S.\u2014died Oct. 19, 1920, Moscow), U.S. poet-adventurer whose short life as a revolutionary writer and activist made him the hero of a generation of radical intellectuals.\n\nReed, a member of a wealthy Portland family, was graduated from Harvard in 1910 and began writing for a Socialist newspaper, The Masses, in 1913.

He came out of his room, roaring orders. In five minutes the house was all bustle and confusion\u2014officers rushing to pack their serapes, mozos and troopers saddling horses, peons with armfuls of rifles rushing to and fro. Patricio harnessed five mules to the great coach\u2014an exact copy of the Deadwood Stage. A courier rode out on the run to summon the Tropa, which was quartered at the Canotillo. Rafaelito loaded the General's baggage into the coach; it consisted of a typewriter, four swords, one of them bearing the emblem of the Knights of Pythias, three uniforms, the General's branding-iron, and a twelve-gallon demijohn of sotol.\n\nAnd there came the Tropa, a ragged smoke of brown dust miles along the road. Ahead flew a little, squat, black figure, with the Mexican flag streaming over him; he wore a floppy sombrero loaded with five pounds of tarnished gold braid\u2014once probably the pride of some imperial hacendado. Following him closely were Manuel Paredes, with riding boots up to his hips, fastened with silver buckles the size of dollars, beating his mount with the flat of a saber; Isidro Amayo, making his horse buck by flapping a hat in his eyes; Jos\u00e9 Valiente, ringing his immense silver spurs inlaid with turquoises; Jesus Mancilla, his flashing brass chain around his neck; Julian Reyes, with colored pictures of Christ and the Virgin fastened to the front of his sombrero; a struggling tangle of six behind, with Antonio Guzman trying to lasso them, the coils of his horsehair rope soaring out of the dust. They came on the dead run, all Indian shouts and cracking revolvers, until they were only a hundred feet away, then jerked their little cow-ponies cruelly to a staggering halt with bleeding mouths, a whirling confusion of men, horses and dust.\n\nThis was the Tropa when I first saw them. About a hundred, they were, in all stages of picturesque raggedness; some wore overalls, others the charro jackets of peons, while one or two sported tight vaquero trousers. A few had shoes, most of them only cowhide sandals, and the rest were barefooted. Sabas Gutierrez was garbed in an ancient frockcoat, split up the back for riding. Rifles slung at their saddles, four or five cartridge-belts crossed over their chests, high, flapping sombreros, immense spurs chiming as they rode, bright-colored serapes strapped on behind\u2014this was their uniform.\n\nThe General was with his mother. Outside the door crouched his mistress, weeping, her three children around her. For almost an hour we waited, then Urbina suddenly burst out of the door. With scarcely a look at his family, he leaped on his great, gray charger, and spurred furiously into the street. Juan Sanchez blew a blast on his cracked bugle, and the Tropa, with the General at its head, took the Canotillo road.\n\nIn the meanwhile Patricio and I loaded three cases of dynamite and a case of bombs into the boot of the coach. I got up beside Patricio, the peons let go of the mules' heads, and the long whip curled around their bellies. Galloping, we whirled out of the village, and took the steep bank of the river at twenty miles an hour. Away on the other side, the Tropa trotted along a more direct road. The Canotillo we passed without stopping.\n\n\"Arr\u00e9 mulas! Putas! Hijas de la Ho\u2014\u2014!\" yelled Patricio, the whip hissing. The Camino Real was a mere track on uneven ground; every time we took a little arroyo the dynamite came down with a sickening crash. Suddenly a rope broke, and one case bounced off the coach and fell upon rocks. It was a cool morning, however, and we strapped it on again safely. \u2026\n\nAlmost every hundred yards along the road were little heaps of stones, surmounted by wooden crosses\u2014each one the memorial of a murder. And occasionally a tall, whitewashed cross uprose in the middle of a side-road, to protect some little desert rancho from the visits of the devil. Black shiny chaparral, the height of a mule's back, scraped the side of the coach; Spanish bayonet and the great barrel-cactus watched us like sentinels from the skyline of the desert. And always the mighty Mexican vultures circled over us, as if they knew we were going to war.\n\nLate in the afternoon the stone wall which bounds the million acres of the Hacienda of Torreon de Ca\u00f1as swung into sight on our left, marching across deserts and mountains like the Great Wall of China, for more than thirty miles; and, soon afterward, the hacienda itself. The Tropa had dismounted around the Big House. They said that General Urbina had suddenly been taken violently sick, and would probably be unable to leave his bed for a week.\n\nThe Casa Grande, a magnificent porticoed palace but one story high, covered the entire top of a desert rise. From its doorway one could see fifteen miles of yellow, rolling plain, and, beyond, the interminable ranges of bare mountains piled upon each other. Back of it lay the great corrals and stables, where the Tropa's evening fires already sent up myriad columns of yellow smoke. Below, in the hollow, more than a hundred peons' houses made a vast open square, where children and animals romped together, and the women kneeled at their eternal grinding of corn. Out on the desert a troop of vaqueros rode slowly home; and from the river, a mile away, the endless chain of black-shawled women carried water on their heads. \u2026 It is impossible to imagine how close to nature the peons live on these great haciendas. Their very houses are built of the earth upon which they stand, baked by the sun. Their food is the corn they grow; their drink the water from the dwindled river, carried painfully upon their heads; the clothes they wear are spun from the wool, and their sandals cut from the hide of a newly slaughtered steer. The animals are their constant companions, familiars of their houses. Light and darkness are their day and night. When a man and a woman fall in love they fly to each other without the formalities of a courtship\u2014and when they are tired of each other they simply part. Marriage is very costly (six pesos to the priest), and is considered a very swagger extra; but it is no more binding than the most casual attachment. And of course jealousy is a stabbing matter.\n\nWe dined in one of the lofty, barren salas of the Casa Grande; a room with a ceiling eighteen feet high, and walls of noble proportions, covered with cheap American wallpaper. A gigantic mahogany sideboard occupied one side of the place, but we had no knives and forks. There was a tiny fireplace, in which a fire was never lighted, yet the chill of death abode there day and night. The room next door was hung with heavy, spotted brocade, though there was no rug on the concrete floor. No pipes and no plumbing in all the house\u2014you went to the well or the river for water. And candles the only light! Of course the due\u00f1o had long fled the country; but the hacienda in its prime must have been as splendid and as uncomfortable as a medieval castle.\n\nThe cura or priest of the hacienda church presided at dinner. To him were brought the choicest viands, which he sometimes passed to his favorites after helping himself. We drank sotol and aguamiel, while the cura made away with a whole bottle of looted anisette. Exhilarated by this, His Reverence descanted upon the virtues of the confessional, especially where young girls were concerned. He also made us understand that he possessed certain feudal rights over new brides. The girls, here, he said, are very passionate. \u2026\n\nI noticed that the rest didn't laugh much at this, though they were outwardly respectful. After we were out of the room, Jos\u00e9 Valiente hissed, shaking so that he could hardly speak: \"I know the dirty\u2014\u2014! And my sister \u2026 ! The Revolucion will have something to say about these curas!\" Two high Constitutionalist officers afterward hinted at a little-known program to drive the priests out of Mexico; and Villa's hostility to the curas is well known.\n\nPatricio was harnessing the coach when I came out in the morning, and the Tropa were saddling up. The doctor, who was remaining with the General, strolled up to my friend, Trooper Juan Vallejo.\n\nThat's a pretty horse you've got there, he said, and a nice rifle. Lend them to me.\n\nBut I haven't any other\u2014\u2014 began Juan.\n\nI am your superior officer, returned the doctor. And that was the last we ever saw of doctor, horse and rifle.\n\nI said farewell to the General, who was lying in torture in bed, sending bulletins to his mother by telephone every fifteen minutes. May you journey happily, he said. Write the truth. I commend you to Pablito.\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nLA TROPA ON THE MARCH\n\nAnd so I got inside the coach, with Rafaelito, Pablo Sea\u00f1es, and his mistress. She was a strange creature. Young, slender, and beautiful, she was poison and a stone to everybody but Pablo. I never saw her smile and never heard her say a gentle word. Sometimes she treated us with dull ferocity; sometimes with bestial indifference. But Pablo she cradled like a baby. When he lay across the seat with his head in her lap, she would hug it fiercely to her breast, making noises like a tigress with her young.\n\nPatricio handed down his guitar from the box, where he kept it, and to Rafael's accompaniment the Lieutenant-Colonel sang love-ballads in a cracked voice. Every Mexican knows hundreds of these. They are not written down, but often composed extemporaneously, and handed along by word of mouth. Some of them are very beautiful, some grotesque, and others as satirical as any French popular song. He sang:\n\n\"Exiled I wandered through the world\u2014\n\nExiled by the government.\n\nI came back at the end of the year,\n\nDrawn by the fondness of love.\n\nI went away with the purpose\n\nOf staying away forever.\n\nAnd the love of a woman was the only thing\n\nThat made me come back.\"\n\nAnd then \"Los Hijos de la Noche\":\n\n\"I am of the children of the night\n\nWho wander aimlessly in the darkness.\n\nThe beautiful moon with its golden rays\n\nIs the companion of my sorrows.\n\n\"I am going to lose myself from thee,\n\nExhausted with weeping;\n\nI am going sailing, sailing,\n\nBy the shores of the sea.\n\n\"You will see at the time of our parting\n\nI will not allow you to love another.\n\nFor if so it should be, I would ruin your face.\n\nAnd many blows we would give one another.\n\n\"So I am going to become an American.\n\nGo with God, Antonia.\n\nSay farewell to my friends.\n\nO may the Americans allow me to pass\n\nAnd open a saloon\n\nOn the other side of the River!\"\n\nThe Hacienda of El Centro turned out to give us lunch. And there Fidencio offered me his horse to ride for the afternoon.\n\nThe Tropa had already ridden on ahead, and I could see them, strung out for half a mile in the black mesquite brush, the tiny red-white-and-green flag bobbing at their head. The mountains had withdrawn somewhere beyond the horizon, and we rode in the midst of a great bowl of desert, rolling up at the edges to meet the furnace-blue of the Mexican sky. Now that I was out of the coach, a great silence, and a peace beyond anything I ever felt, wrapped me around. It is almost impossible to get objective about the desert; you sink into it\u2014become a part of it. Galloping along, I soon caught up with the Tropa.\n\nAye, meester! they shouted. \"Here comes meester on a horse! Que tal, meester? How goes it? Are you going to fight with us?\"\n\nBut Captain Fernando at the head of the column turned and roared: Come here, meester! The big man was grinning with delight. You shall ride with me, he shouted, clapping me on the back. Drink, now, and he produced a bottle of sotol about half full. Drink it all. Show you're a man. It's too much, I laughed. Drink it, yelled the chorus as the Tropa crowded up to see. I drank it. A howl of laughter and applause went up. Fernando leaned over and gripped my hand. \"Good for you, compa\u00f1ero!\" he bellowed, rolling with mirth. The men crowded around, amused and interested. Was I going to fight with them? Where did I come from? What was I doing? Most of them had never heard of reporters, and one hazarded the opinion darkly that I was a Gringo and a Porfirista, and ought to be shot.\n\nThe rest, however, were entirely opposed to this view. No Porfirista would possibly drink that much sotol at a gulp. Isidro Amayo declared that he had been in a brigade in the first Revolution which was accompanied by a reporter, and that he was called Corresponsal de Guerra. Did I like Mexico? I said: \"I am very fond of Mexico. I like Mexicans too. And I like sotol, aguardiente, mescal, tequila, pulque, and other Mexican customs!\" They shouted with laughter.\n\nCaptain Fernando leaned over and patted my arm. \"Now you are with the men (los hombres.) When we win the Revolucion it will be a government by the men\u2014not by the rich. We are riding over the lands of the men. They used to belong to the rich, but now they belong to me and to the compa\u00f1eros.\"\n\nAnd you will be the army? I asked.\n\nWhen the Revolucion is won, was the astonishing reply, there will be no more army. The men are sick of armies. It is by armies that Don Porfirio robbed us.\n\nBut if the United States should invade Mexico?\n\nA perfect storm broke everywhere. \"We are more valiente than the Americanos\u2014The cursed Gringos would get no further south than Juarez\u2014Let's see them try it\u2014We'd drive them back over the Border on the run, and burn their capital the next day \u2026 !\"\n\nNo, said Fernando, you have more money and more soldiers. But the men would protect us. We need no army. The men would be fighting for their houses and their women.\n\nWhat are you fighting for? I asked. Juan Sanchez, the color-bearer, looked at me curiously. Why, it is good, fighting. You don't have to work in the mines \u2026 !\n\nManuel Paredes said: We are fighting to restore Francisco I. Madero to the Presidency. This extraordinary statement is printed in the program of the Revolution. And everywhere the Constitutionalist soldiers are known as Maderistas. I knew him, continued Manuel, slowly. He was always laughing, always.\n\nYes, said another, whenever there was any trouble with a man, and all the rest wanted to fight him or put him in prison, Pancho Madero said: 'Just let me talk to him a few minutes. I can bring him around.'\n\n\"He loved bailes, an Indian said. Many a time I've seen him dance all night, and all the next day, and the next night. He used to come to the great Haciendas and make speeches. When he began the peons hated him; when he ended they were crying. \u2026 \"\n\nHere a man broke out into a droning, irregular tune, such as always accompanies the popular ballads that spring up in thousands on every occasion:\n\n\"In Nineteen hundred and ten\n\nMadero was imprisoned\n\nIn the National Palace\n\nThe eighteenth of February\n\n\"Four days he was imprisoned\n\nIn the Hall of the Intendancy\n\nBecause he did not wish\n\nTo renounce the Presidency\n\n\"Then Blanquet and Felix Diaz\n\nMartyred him there\n\nThey were the hangmen\n\nFeeding on his hate.\n\n\"They crushed. \u2026\n\nUntil he fainted\n\nWith play of cruelty\n\nTo make him resign.\n\n\"Then with hot irons\n\nThey burned him without mercy\n\nAnd only unconsciousness\n\nCalmed the awful flames.\n\n\"But it was all in vain\n\nBecause his mighty courage\n\nPreferred rather to die\n\nHis was a great heart!\n\n\"This was the end of the life\n\nOf him who was the redeemer\n\nOf the Indian Republic\n\nAnd of all the poor.\n\n\"They took him out of the Palace\n\nAnd tell us he was killed in an assault\n\nWhat a cynicism!\n\nWhat a shameless lie!\n\n\"O Street of Lecumberri\n\nYour cheerfulness has ended forever\n\nFor through you passed Madero\n\nTo the Penitentiary.\n\n\"That twenty-second of February\n\nWill always be remembered in the Indian Republic.\n\nGod has pardoned him\n\nAnd the Virgin of Guadelupe.\n\n\"Good-bye Beautiful Mexico\n\nWhere our leader died\n\nGood-bye to the palace\n\nWhence he issued a living corpse\n\n\"Se\u00f1ores, there is nothing eternal\n\nNor anything sincere in life\n\nSee what happened to Don Francisco I. Madero!'\n\nBy the time he was half-way through, the entire Tropa was humming the tune, and when he finished there was a moment of jingling silence.\n\nWe are fighting, said Isidro Amayo, for Libertad.\n\nWhat do you mean by Libertad?\n\n\"Libertad is when I can do what I want!\"\n\nBut suppose it hurts somebody else?\n\nHe shot back at me Benito Juarez' great sentence:\n\nPeace is the respect for the rights of others!\n\nI wasn't prepared for that. It startled me, this barefooted meztizo's conception of Liberty. I submit that it is the only correct definition of Liberty\u2014to do what I want to! Americans quote it to me triumphantly as an instance of Mexican irresponsibility. But I think it is a better definition than ours\u2014Liberty is the right to do what the Courts want. Every Mexican schoolboy knows the definition of peace and seems to understand pretty well what it means, too. But, they say, Mexicans don't want peace. That is a lie, and a foolish one. Let Americans take the trouble to go through the Maderista army, asking whether they want peace or not! The people are sick of war.\n\nBut, just to be square, I'll have to report Juan Sanchez' remark:\n\nIs there war in the United States now? he asked.\n\nNo, I said untruthfully.\n\nNo war at all? He meditated for a moment. How do you pass the time, then \u2026 ?\n\nJust about then somebody saw a coyote sneaking through the brush, and the entire Tropa gave chase with a whoop. They scattered rollicking over the desert, the late sun flashing from cartridge-belts and spurs, the ends of their bright serapes flying out behind. Beyond them, the scorched world sloped gently up, and a range of far lilac mountains jumped in the heat waves like a bucking horse. By here, if tradition is right, passed the steel-armored Spaniards in their search for gold, a blaze of crimson and silver that has left the desert cold and dull ever since. And, topping a rise, we came upon the first sight of the Hacienda of La Mimbrera, a walled enclosure of houses strong enough to stand a siege, stretching steeply down a hill, with the magnificent Casa Grande at the top.\n\nIn front of this house, which had been sacked and burned by Orozco's General, Che Che Campa, two years before, the coach was drawn up. A huge fire had been kindled, and ten compa\u00f1eros were slaughtering sheep. Into the red glare of the firelight they staggered, with the struggling, squealing sheep in their arms, its blood fountaining upon the ground, shining in the fierce light like something phosphorescent.\n\nThe officers and I dined in the house of the administrador Don Jesus, the most beautiful specimen of manhood I have ever seen. He was much over six feet tall, slender, white-skinned\u2014a pure Spanish type of the highest breed. At one end of his dining-room, I remember, hung a placard embroidered in red, white and green: Viva Mexico! and at the other, a second, which read: Viva Jesus!\n\nIt was after dinner, as I stood at the fire, wondering where I was to sleep, that Captain Fernando touched me on the arm.\n\n\"Will you sleep with the compa\u00f1eros?\"\n\nWe walked across the great open square, in the furious light of the desert stars, to a stone store-house set apart. Inside, a few candles stuck against the wall illumined the rifles stacked in the corners, the saddles on the floor, and the blanket-rolled compa\u00f1eros with their heads on them. One or two were awake, talking and smoking. In a corner, three sat muffled in their serapes, playing cards. Five or six had voices and a guitar. They were singing Pascual Orozco, beginning:\n\n\"They say that Pascual Orozco has turned his coat\n\nBecause Don Terrazzas seduced him;\n\nThey gave him many millions and they bought him\n\nAnd sent him to overthrow the government.\n\n\"Orozco believed it\n\nAnd to the war he went;\n\nBut the Maderista cannon\n\nWas his calamity.\n\n\"If to thy window shall come Porfirio Diaz,\n\nGive him for charity some cold tortillas;"}, {"url": "https://www.ipl.org/essay/Insurgent-Mexico-Summary-FKU35ZFMU5FV", "page_content": "In the novel Insurgent Mexico, John Reed travels south of the border to experience the Mexican Revolution first hand while traveling in the year 1914. Reed was a journalist writing for Metropolitan and was ordered to bring back his work to publish in the United States. During this time Reed travelled to many places and met all different types of people from war generals, to peones, to Indians and many others. Reed has described his time in Mexico as the \u201cmost satisfactory period\u201d in his life (Publisher\u2019s Note), and it can be reflected through the stories he shares in Insurgent Mexico about his traveling companions and his experiences. Some moments were very serious, and at times even dangerous, while others were light hearted and amusing for\n\nAt first Reed easily notices the small cultural differences such as the lack of cutlery at the dinner table (48) and also the customs of marriage, which usually signifies wealth and is \u201cno more binding then the most casual attachment\u201d (53). But later he begins to see that the American idea of Mexicans has been very off base. This first started when his misconceptions were debunked by the hospitable behavior of the people he encountered. Reed gives context of the American perception of Mexicans for example when he says, \u201cI want to mention one fact [about Mexicans]\u201d and making it a matter of importance. He continues, \u201cAmericans had insisted that the Mexican was fundamentally dishonest\u201d (65) and then contrasts this assumption by describing the wonderful hospitality that nearly all Mexicans showed him during his travels. More often than not Reed was offered the best accommodations available and not for want of anything, which is not what he had been expecting at all during his trip. While he did face backlash by some for being a gringo or a spy, the majority of the people he met were willing to vouch for him and did not want him getting hurt. Also what helped shaped Reed\u2019s view of the Mexican Revolution were his interactions with both Pancho Villa and Carranza. First Reed visits Villa and finds an uneducated peon who has won over\n\nThe father of Longinos G\u00fcereca summarized this nicely when he said \u201cwhat difference does it make which side robs you?\u201d (76-77). The poor are the true victims here and even though Villa makes it his mission to fight for them, it still is not enough. Villa said in one of his memorable speeches, \u201cthe tortillas of the poor are better than the bread of the rich\u201d (74). But this is only true to a certain extent, in that the poor are more satisfied with having less in their lives, while the rich have so much and want more (166). Reed says that all peons are \u201cincredibly poor and lavishly hospitable\u201d (104) to him and they are willing to give up so much because they cherish all that they have in a way that rich never can. The soldiers fighting in the war were barely paid at all in money, and many paid with their lives. They knew that they would not reap the benefits of their sacrifices, but instead the \u201cpacificos who will get the land-those who did not fight\u201d (90). After Reed hears that his dear friend Longinos G\u00fcereca, alongside many other soldiers, was killed he felt sick \"to think of so many useless deaths\u201d (106) These people became more than just soldiers to Reed, they were his friends who had loved ones and a history and were too poor to advocate for themselves politically so their only option was to"}, {"url": "https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-reed", "page_content": "A journalist, historian, and poet, John Reed is best known for his Ten Days that Shook the World, an eyewitness account of the Russian Revolution. Though he thought of himself as a poet and fiction writer, it was as a journalist that Reed gained acclaim. Known for crossing over the line from objective reporting into advocacy for a cause, Reed\u2019s work as both a war correspondent and an activist led Walter Lippmann, a contemporary reporter, to say that \u201cwith Jack Reed reporting begins.\u201d As critic Elmer Bendiner of the Nation explained, \u201cThe name of John Reed is breathed nowadays like a sigh for lost innocence. He was a journalist of a sort that has gone out of style . . . a reporter on horseback seeking his story in the faces and gestures of the living warriors, not in word games of press handouts or news conferences.\u201d The leader of the Communist Labor Party in the United States, Reed is the only American and one of the few foreigners to have ever been buried at the foot of the Kremlin wall.\n\n\n\nBorn and raised in a wealthy family in Oregon, Reed was educated at Harvard and began his writing career there, writing poetry and plays and serving on the editorial boards of the Lampoon and Harvard Monthly. After his graduation in 1910, he moved to Greenwich Village and joined the staff of the American Magazine as both a contributor and editor. It was during this time that Reed first became interested in social problems, and quickly became a radical. \u201cJohn Reed was so active in radical politics as to have too little time left for poetry,\u201d wrote Harriet Monroe in Poetry magazine, explaining why Reed\u2019s poetry career had never reached its full potential. \u201cKnowing himself for a poet, he hoped to prove his vocation by many poems worthy to endure; but life was so exciting, and the social struggle in these States and Mexico, in Finland, Russia\u2014everywhere\u2014so tempting to a fighting radical, that poetry had to wait for the leisure which\u2014alas!\u2014never came.\u201d In 1913, Reed joined the staff of The Masses, a periodical that reflected his political views. For The Masses, he wrote an account of the silk workers\u2019s strike in Paterson, New Jersey; during the writing of the article, he was arrested for his attempts to speak on behalf of the strikers. He went on to write a play about the strike, which he produced in Madison Square Garden, performed by the strikers themselves.\n\n\n\nIn 1914, Reed was hired as a war correspondent by Metropolitan magazine to cover the Mexican revolution. Reed followed Pancho Villa\u2019s army and lived among his soldiers for four months, traveling with them across the desert, sleeping on the ground, celebrating in looted haciendas, and being with them in battle. The resulting series of articles, republished in book form as Insurgent Mexico, attracted more critical attention and earned Reed the reputation \u201cthe American Kipling.\u201d Insurgent Mexico, divided into six sections, provides descriptions of the Desert War, the attack on Torre\u00f3n, rebel leader Pancho Villa, and an interview with Carranza, another leader of the rebellion. \u201cThe articles he sent back from the border were as hot as the Mexican desert,\u201d reported Walter Lippman, writing for the New Republic, \u201cand Villa\u2019s revolution, till then reported only as a nuisance, began to unfold itself into throngs of moving people in a gorgeous panorama of earth and sky.\u201d\n\n\n\nRobert Rosenstone, in his biography of Reed, Romantic Revolutionary, noted that the book\u2019s \u201cartistically arranged scenes have a balance, coherence and integrity that daily experience lacks. Skies often turn blood-red after battles, simple peons speak with uncanny folk wisdom, the narrator has sudden flashing insights into the symbolic meanings of complex events\u2014such things occur too often to be taken as a literal transcription of what Reed saw, heard and did.\u201d Granville Hicks, in his biography John Reed: The Making of a Revolutionary, said of this quality in the work, Reed \u201cwas indifferent to the accuracy of the historian, but he had the integrity of a poet.\u201d\n\n\n\nNot all critics were won over by Reed\u2019s narrative style. A reviewer for the Nation commented, \u201cThe book is a lurid exaggeration of some few aspects, and the frenzied manner of the whole composition aims not so much at depicting sober truths as at shocking the reader by disgusting naturalism in describing an irregular assortment of horrors such as were to be found nowhere else in the world at the time that Reed wrote.\u201d Critics in the late twentieth century, however, recognized the merits of Insurgent Mexico; a writer in History Today called it \u201ca classic indeed,\u201d and Richard Elman of the Nation claimed that the book was \u201cReed\u2019s finest writing, a book of such vividness, empathy and daring that much of what passes for personal journalism today does seem callow by comparison.\u201d\n\n\n\nReed himself described his travel to Mexico in his essay \u201cAlmost Thirty,\u201d printed in the New Republic. \u201cA terrible curiosity urged me on,\u201d he described. \u201cI felt I had to know how I would act under fire, how I would get along with these primitive folks at war. And I discovered that bullets are not very terrifying, that the fear of death is not such a great thing, and that the Mexicans are wonderfully congenial. . . . I loved them and I loved the life. I found myself again. I wrote better than I have ever written.\u201d\n\n\n\nReed returned from Mexico a popular figure, but his acclaim soon faded due to his opposition to World War I and his participation in the Socialist Party. Many magazines would no longer print his work, and his next book, The War in Eastern Europe, was called by Harry Henderson in the Massachusetts Review a \u201cdismal failure.\u201d The articles for this book were again commissioned by Metropolitan, and Reed traveled to Europe, behind both Allied and German lines. Because of Reed\u2019s socialist views, he was not granted the same insider\u2019s view as he had been in Mexico. Though he used the same form as he had for Insurgent Mexico, without his being able to identify with a specific cause, according to Henderson, \u201cReed becomes entirely disoriented as a narrator.\u201d Unable to recreate his earlier successes, Reed began co-writing and producing short plays for the Provincetown Players with Louise Bryant and Eugene O\u2019Neill. Bryant became his wife in 1917.\n\n\n\nIn August of 1917, Reed and Bryant sailed to Russia to cover the coming revolution. As a supporter of communism, Reed quickly sided with Vladimir Lenin and his supporters, and was an enthusiastic witness to the Bolshevik revolution in Petrograd. Reed alone among the foreign correspondents was given an insider\u2019s view and treated as a fellow to the cause. He kept a diary of his conversations with educated leaders and peasants alike. The book that recorded the events of the revolution, Ten Days that Shook the World, is, according to Henderson, \u201cthe great case in the history of eye-witness accounts of the right reporter being in the right place at the right time.\u201d Ten Days that Shook the World was \u201cthe first major account in America of the revolution\u2019s universal impact,\u201d according to John Stuart in his introduction to The Education of John Reed, and is often considered by critics the finest first-hand account of the Russian revolution.\n\n\n\nBertram D. Wolfe, in his book Strange Communists I Have Known, explained that Reed \u201ctried to see it all and put it all on paper. The dream of the Bolsheviks, the realities of their deeds, and the tension between the dream and reality are in his pages.\u201d Stuart praised Reed, declaring, \u201cWhat he wrote about the Russian Revolution in Ten Days that Shook the World, with its extraordinary weaving of significant detail into a triumphal theme, was a measure of the great leap forward he had made.\u201d But the reception of the book in America at the time was not positive. Even before its publication, Reed had not been allowed to return to the United States due to a sedition charge against him for articles he had written for The Masses. When he was finally allowed entrance into the country, he turned from journalism to politics, and organized the Communist Labor Party, one of the two rival communist parties in the United States. When Ten Days that Shook the World was published in 1919, Reed was indicted as a communist leader during the \u201cRed Scare\u201d after World War I, due to his radical stance and obvious support of communism. He fled the country, eventually returning to Russia where he died of typhus. Reed was buried, honored as a Soviet hero, under the Kremlin wall facing the Red Square, the only American and one of the few foreigners to receive such an honor."}]}
