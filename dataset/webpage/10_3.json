F. Kuang\n\nFrom award-winning author R. F. Kuang comes Babel, a thematic response to The Secret History and a tonal retort to Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell that grapples with student revolutions, colonial resistance, and the use of language and translation as the dominating tool of the British empire.\n\n\n\nTraduttore, traditore: An act of translation is always an act of betrayal.\n\n\n\n1828. Robin Swift, orphaned by cholera in Canton, is brought to London by the mysterious Professor Lovell. There, he trains for years in Latin, Ancient Greek, and Chinese, all in preparation for the day he'll enroll in Oxford University's prestigious Royal Institute of Translation \u2014 also known as Babel.\n\n\n\nBabel is the world's center for translation and, more importantly, magic. Silver working \u2014 the art of manifesting the meaning lost in translation using enchanted silver bars \u2014 has made the British unparalleled in power, as its knowledge serves the Empire's quest for colonization.\n\n\n\nFor Robin, Oxford is a utopia dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge. But knowledge obeys power, and as a Chinese boy raised in Britain, Robin realizes serving Babel means betraying his motherland. As his studies progress, Robin finds himself caught between Babel and the shadowy Hermes Society, an organization dedicated to stopping imperial expansion. When Britain pursues an unjust war with China over silver and opium, Robin must decide...\n\n\n\nCan powerful institutions be changed from within, or does revolution always require violence?\n\nEach year since 1965 the Nebula Awards honoring science fiction's best novel, novella, novelette, short story, and script have been awarded by the voting members of Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, Inc.\n\nHere we present the winners of the Nebula Awards' best novel category.\n\nEvery year an anthology of the prior year's Nebula Award-winning short fiction is published.

Since then, she has published six novels, three short story collections, a couple of chapbooks and some poetry. Her novel A Woman of the Iron People won the James Tiptree Jr. and the Mythopoeic Society Awards; her novel Ring of Swords won a Minnesota Book Award; and her short story \u201cDapple\u201d won the Spectrum Award. A collection of her Icelandic fantasies came out in 2014. She has since written four more stories about Icelandic ghosts, trolls, elves and ordinary people. This is one. \u201cThe Graveyard\u201d is Arnason\u2019s first appearance in Uncanny, a beautifully crafted tale that weaves together folklore and history.\n\nUncanny Magazine: I love the structure of this story\u2014we are reading the account of a narrator who is hearing about the ghosts from a curator, who in turn has heard the story from Atli. Why did you choose this structure?\n\nEleanor Arnason: The story begins with an actual conversation I had with the curator of a historical site in Iceland. She told me about a farmer who didn\u2019t believe in ghosts, but had to deal with them. But there was no end to her story. The curator didn\u2019t tell me what happened to the farmer. So, I rewrote her narrative and added an ending. The layering\u2014the narrator who is told the story by the curator, who is in turn told the story by the farmer\u2014came out of the actual situation.\n\nUncanny Magazine: What was the easiest part of writing this story? What was the most challenging thing?\n\nEleanor Arnason: The easiest part was the beginning, since I had a real (I think) incident. The hard part was finding an ending. I wanted to keep the uncertainty. Were the ghosts real? Did the characters end by believing in ghosts? And I wanted to keep the story pragmatic: the farmer had a problem. How was he going to solve it? What\u2019s more important than believing in the ghosts is finding a way to get rid of them.\n\nUncanny Magazine: \u201cThe Graveyard\u201d has a lovely anthropological feel to it, centering on a cultural conflict and weaving together Icelandic folklore and history, which are recurring topics in your work. What other topics or themes do you find yourself drawn to repeatedly?\n\nEleanor Arnason: A lot of my fiction is about social stereotypes and characters who don\u2019t fit into the roles they are assigned by society. I come out of the Second Wave of Feminism, which hit SF in the late 1960s and was very strong through the 1970s. (Theodore Sturgeon said all the good new writers in the 1970s were women, except for James Tiptree Jr.) So I do a lot with gender roles. My characters want to be something they can\u2019t be in their society, because of their gender. Sometimes they succeed in being the people they want to be. Sometimes they don\u2019t manage. But I give them tolerable lives. There is enough suffering in the world.\n\nMy Icelandic stories are different. Not about gender, for the most part. They are about people who get in difficult situations which are often supernatural and struggle to get out of the situations and get on with their lives. Maybe the commonality with the gender stories is the struggle to have one\u2019s own life. Atli has to find a way to calm down the ghosts and to get the Icelandic-American businessman to stop bothering the graveyard. There is nothing epic about this: he\u2019s not like Frodo. He just wants to get on with his life.\n\nMany of my Icelandic stories are about history: the land is built on the past, as my curator says. A lot of my Icelandic characters are trying to come to terms with the past and the folklore of their country: ghosts, trolls, elves. I am not a fan of Icelandic elves, who seem like rich people, indifferent to the suffering of the poor. But I sometimes write about them. I like trolls, which I see as ordinary people, though very large and rock-like, who struggle to get by. Ghosts are past all effort. Though they can complain.\n\nWriting the above I thought of the famous lines by Karl Marx in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte: \u201cMen make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living.\u201d Maybe that\u2019s what my fiction is about: trying to make a decent life in spite the rules of one\u2019s society and the weight of the past.\n\nUncanny Magazine: Do you believe in ghosts?\n\nEleanor Arnason: No, but neither did the farmer. I am not invested in not believing in ghosts. If I meet one, I will believe in it.\n\nUncanny Magazine: You\u2019ve been writing short stories since the 1970s, and have published dozens of short stories and three collections. What draws you to short fiction? Which writers or stories do you consider to be your strongest influences?\n\nEleanor Arnason: I think my natural length is the short story. I especially like long short stories, novelettes. But I write a fair number of classic-length short stories. I\u2019m a slow writer and writing a novel takes forever. So I like the shortness of short fiction, and the fact that\u2014written well\u2014it can have a density and tightness that\u2019s hard to get in a novel. It\u2019s hard to write a flawless novel, though Jane Austen managed in Pride and Prejudice. But you can write a close to flawless short story.\n\nI think Ursula K. Le Guin is an obvious influence on my work. Possibly Jane Austen as well. I have read Austen\u2019s novels over and over. I love her wit and clear-sightedness and extreme skill as a writer. Very obviously medieval Icelandic literature has influenced me, especially the Icelandic family sagas, not only in my Icelandic stories. My brother says he can see the influence of the sagas in everything I write. (I grant that Austen and the sagas are an odd combination. But it\u2019s what I grew up with.)\n\nUncanny Magazine: What are you working on next?\n\nEleanor Arnason: I have just finished another couple of Icelandic stories. Then I will take a break from Iceland. I have a story about a journalist who gets an assignment to interview the ghost of Hugo Chavez, the former president of Venezuela, to find out if he was involved in the 2020 American election. (Some of Trump\u2019s allies say Chavez helped steal the election. Chavez has been dead since 2013, as people keep pointing out.) I\u2019m still tinkering with that one. I think it will be difficult to sell. And I have started a story about Yu the Great, who founded the first Chinese imperial dynasty, assuming he actually existed. What I like about him is he\u2019s credited with taming the floods on the Yellow River. Imperial China was founded by an engineer! Of course, he was a supernatural engineer, helped by a yellow dragon and a gigantic black turtle. He was also, according to the Chinese stories, an exemplary person and devoted to the common people. Not all my stories work out. These last two may or may not.\n\nUncanny Magazine: Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us!\n\n\u00a9 2021 Uncanny Magazine"}, {"url": "http://dreamhavenbooks.com/event/elanor/", "page_content": "Calendar When: 2016.05.25 @ 18:30 \u2013 19:45 2016-05-25T18:30:00-05:00 2016-05-25T19:45:00-05:00 Where: DreamHaven Books\n\n2301 E 38th St\n\nMinneapolis, MN 55406\n\nUSA\n\nCost: Free Event Signing\n\nOn Wednesday, May 25, ELEANOR ARNASON reads from her work at 6:30 p.m. Ms. Arnason was born in Manhattan and grew up in New York, Chicago, London, Paris, Washington DC, Honolulu, Saint Paul, and Minneapolis.
