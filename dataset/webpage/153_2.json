He still qualified and splashed into action in the 2008 Beijing Games (semi-final) and 2012 London Games (seventh) before hanging up his goggles and cap following a first round exit at the 2016 Rio Olympics.\u201d\n\nReflecting on Baptiste\u2019s Olympic career the release said, \u201cBaptiste will also be making five consecutive appearances in a record that saw her making her Olympic debut as part of the women\u2019s 4x100m relay team at the 2004 Athens Games when the powerful Tobago-native led off the relay team that failed to carry the baton all-the way round and were disqualified in the first round.\n\n\u201cFour years later at the 2008 Beijing edition, she reached the second round in the individual event while another baton mishap saw another disqualification in the women\u2019s 4x100m relay.\u201d\n\nShe had her best showing at the 2012 Games. \u201cBaptiste\u2019s best Olympic performance came at the 2012 London Games where she finished sixth in the final but Team TTO\u2019s women\u2019s relay woes continued with another failed trip, and in 2016 Rio, she exited at the second round.\u201d\n\nBaptiste, 34, will again line up in the women's 100m dash and women's 4x100m relay team.\n\nBaptiste is being described as the \u201cstateswoman\u201d of the TT Olympic contingent.\n\nOn Tuesday, the TTOC announced the full TT team that covers seven sporting disciplines including track and field, boxing, cycling, judo, rowing, sailing and swimming. TTOC president Brian Lewis hinted that TT may make history by naming its first women\u2019s flag-bearer for the opening ceremony.\n\n\"To date, the TTOC has never had a female flag-bearer at the opening ceremony of a Summer Olympic Games,\" Lewis said.\n\n\"It is my sincere hope that a female athlete will be chosen by the chef de mission Lovie Santana to carry the TT flag during the opening ceremony in Tokyo 2020.\"\n\nTT will have Santana, the experienced TTOC senior administrative officer, at the helm while TTOC project officer, athletes services and programmes, Rheeza Grant will serve as TT's covid19 liaison officer. TT will also rely on a strong medical staff of nine led by Dr Rudranath Ramsawak.\n\nAfter the Games were rescheduled due to the pandemic, Lewis said, \"The TTOC acknowledges the perseverance, dedication and determination of every athlete who tried their best to qualify for the covid19 pandemic impacted games, the first Olympic Games in history to be postponed.\"\n\nThis year's Olympic Games also hold special significance for the TTOC as it coincides with its 75-year anniversary."}, {"url": "https://www.guardian.co.tt/sports/bovell-iii-honoured-to-be-in-hall-of-fame-6.2.1110968.fb06ed4383", "page_content": "T&T Olympic Games bronze medal swim\u00admer (2004 Athens), and for\u00admer world record hold\u00ader, George Bovell III says he is ho\u00adn\u00adoured to have been in\u00adduct\u00aded to the First Cit\u00adi\u00adzens Sports Foun\u00adda\u00adtion Hall of Fame.\n\nThe 36-year-old Bovell, who now re\u00adsides in Cana\u00adda fol\u00adlow\u00ading his re\u00adtire\u00adment from the sport al\u00admost four years ago was in\u00adduct\u00aded on Sun\u00adday, April 11, along with for\u00admer out\u00adstand\u00ading T&T ath\u00adletes Claude Noel (box\u00ading), and Cheryl Ann Sankar (taek\u00adwon\u00addo), Dex\u00adter St Louis (ta\u00adble ten\u00adnis/posthu\u00admous) as well as coach\u00ades Bertille St Clair (foot\u00adball), Lester Os\u00adouna (ath\u00adlet\u00adics), crick\u00adet um\u00adpire Ralph Go\u00adsein (posthu\u00admous) and ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtors Rev Dr Iva Gloudon, David Far\u00adrell, and sports jour\u00adnal\u00adist Dave Lamy (posthu\u00admous).\n\nOver his out\u00adstand\u00ading swim\u00adming ca\u00adreer which spanned al\u00admost more than 20 years, Bovell rep\u00adre\u00adsent\u00aded T&T at 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 Olympics.\n\nAt the 2004 Olympics, he won a bronze medal in the men's 200 IM, the ninth medal\u00adist in the coun\u00adtry's his\u00adto\u00adry and 12th medal over\u00adall.\n\nIt was al\u00adso the first-ever Olympic swim\u00adming medal for the coun\u00adtry and T&T's on\u00adly medal from the 2004 Olympics.\n\nBovell al\u00adso made it to the fi\u00adnals of the 50m Freestyle in Lon\u00addon where he placed sev\u00adenth in the fastest field ever as\u00adsem\u00adbled af\u00adter re\u00adturn\u00ading from a forced hia\u00adtus due to a brain in\u00adjury ear\u00adli\u00ader in the sea\u00adson.\n\nHe was T&T's flag bear\u00ader at the open\u00ading cer\u00ade\u00admo\u00adny of the Bei\u00adjing Olympics in 2008, the 20th Cen\u00adtral Amer\u00adi\u00adcan and Caribbean (CAC) Games in Carta\u00adge\u00adna, Colom\u00adbia and in the clos\u00ading cer\u00ade\u00admonies of 2000, 2004 and 2012 Olympic Games.\n\nAt FI\u00adNA World Cham\u00adpi\u00adonships events, Bovell won the bronze in 2013 in the 50m Long Course freestyle fi\u00adnal in (21.51 sec\u00adonds) at Barcelona against the fastest field ever as\u00adsem\u00adbled in the sport, one in which every com\u00adpeti\u00adtor in the fi\u00adnal was an Olympic medal\u00adist.\n\nA year ear\u00adli\u00ader he al\u00adso se\u00adcured bronze in the 100m in\u00addi\u00advid\u00adual med\u00adley at the World Short Course Cham\u00adpi\u00adonships in Is\u00adtan\u00adbul, a tes\u00adta\u00adment to his ver\u00adsa\u00adtil\u00adi\u00adty.\n\nOver\u00adall, he has been in ten World Cham\u00adpi\u00adonship fi\u00adnals since his first in 2001 and has won six Pan Amer\u00adi\u00adcan Games medals (two gold, two sil\u00adver and two bronze) along with eight CAC Games medals (three gold, two sil\u00adver and three bronze), both over three edi\u00adtions of the events.\n\nBovell who was sec\u00adond over\u00adall on the 2012 FI\u00adNA World Cup medals list with 16 (sev\u00aden gold and nine sil\u00adver) and a five-time NCAA in\u00addi\u00advid\u00adual cham\u00adpi\u00adon said it\u2019s a great ho\u00adn\u00adour to be in\u00adduct\u00aded in\u00adto our na\u00adtion\u00adal sport\u00ading Hall of Fame said, \"I was in Coim\u00adbat\u00adore, South In\u00addia, study\u00ading Ayurve\u00adda, when they told me about it, and had planned to re\u00adturn to the jun\u00adgle in Pe\u00adru for a few weeks to learn more about tra\u00addi\u00adtion\u00adal Ama\u00adzon\u00adian med\u00adi\u00adcine.

It was really a great moment and it will live on. Young people should go and watch that race, read the interviews and know that George Bovell III was a national hero.\n\nGeorge Bovell III: I always felt like the underdog. These big countries have everything, they have massage therapists, they have the best sports science they\u2019ve got everything and me, coming from Trinidad, we have none of those resources. I felt a sense of pride that we can reach that level despite where we\u2019re coming from because, now, we have the National Aquatic Centre, back then we have very terrible facilities, very Third World. I don\u2019t think at the time I really understood the significance of what it meant to (get) a medal for Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nOnly now, as I\u2019m out of the sport, that I can look back and say \u2018wow, maybe I blazed a trail and inspired many people\u2019. I was hoping at the time that I inspired a lot of people because I see people in Trinidad, the youths especially, and it\u2019s not that we lack opportunities, a lot of times we just lack motivation. They can never imagine that they too could be great. It\u2019s like a mental block.\n\nPeople tend to just accept mediocrity and say \u2018I\u2019m okay with just going to the Olympics\u2019. It\u2019s something I hope would just change the way we think and start to hold ourselves to a higher standard. The irony is that was my last 200 IM. A few months after that, I had a terrible knee injury and it ended my ability to swim the breaststroke properly. I had to face that reality and say either I change and go for something else or retire and say I had a good run.\n\nI bounced back to (get) a World Championship medal (bronze in the 50-metre freestyle in Barcelona, Spain in 2013) and be in an Olympic final, in the 50m freestyle, which is a completely different race. Of course, there are injuries along the way.\n\nI think that the bronze (at Athens), in a way, was a blessing. If I had won the gold medal, I think I would have become too proud. Personally, my belief, along with many other people, I doubt the legitimacy of Michael Phelps. I see the Olympic size of reality tv show and, from my own belief, that number two drop to number three, on that day, I think that with clean, fair and honourable competition, I was the best.\n\nIt does not matter of you\u2019re fighting cancer, taking chemotherapy, you\u2019re struggling to feed your family or competing in sport, life gives you a challenge. And if you have the perfect excuse, as long as you have the mental willpower to resist that excuse and keep pushing, you are a champion.\n\nSource"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/george-bovell/", "page_content": "George Richard Lytcott Bovell (born 18 July 1983) is an Olympic bronze medalist swimmer and former world record holder from Trinidad and Tobago.

He is known for organizing and conducting the annual \"George Bovell Dive In Free Swim Clinics\", that are free for the youth of Trinidad and Tobago who enjoy the privilege of being coached and mentored by renowned Olympic Medalist Swimmers from around the world.

It was also the first-ever Olympic swimming medal for the country, and T&T's only medal from the 2004 Olympics. Bovell also made it to the Finals of the 50m Freestyle in London where he placed 7th in the fastest field ever assembled after returning from a forced hiatus due to a brain injury earlier in the season. Bovell carried the T&T flag at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics in 2008, the 20th Central American and Caribbean Games in Cartagena, Colombia and in the closing ceremonies of the 2000, 2004 and 2012 Olympic Games.\n\nWorld Championships\n\nIn 2013 Bovell won the Bronze Medal in the 50m freestyle at the FINA World Long Course Championships in Barcelona against the fastest field ever assembled in the sport, one in which every competitor in the final was an Olympic Medalist.

The book examines, in detail, the history of Trinidad and Tobago's Olympic\n\n\n\nparticipation. Included in OLYMPIAN are profiles of the country's eight individual Olympic medallists, between 1948 and 2008. Between July 17 and August 9, excerpts from those eight profiles are being featured in the pages of the Trinidad Express.\n\nThe profiles, in their entirety, are being published on the Express website (http://www.trinidadexpress.com/olympics).\n\n\n\nToday, we feature swimmer George Bovell. He captured bronze in 2004, in Athens, Greece. Here he was at the start of the 200m Intermediate Medley (IM) final, all 6'5\" of him, before the crouch of course, along with the seven other finalists, all carrying with them, on their finely tuned bodies, their hopes and\n\n\n\nspirations, and at the same time the hopes and aspirations of their coaches and their nations.\n\n\n\nThe ritual of the early morning workouts, and the afternoon workouts had all come down to this. George had already been quoted as saying \"I am excited at the prospect of swimming against the best in the world at the Olympics.\" He tried to block it all out. He had already done all that was required of him, and now found himself in lane 2, trying to focus on the task at hand. He had gone this route already in the preliminaries and in the semi-final.\n\n\n\nYes, the day before at the Olympic Aquatic Center in Athens, Greece, the birth place of the Olympics, George had started his trek to the final. Drawn in lane 4 in the fifth heat, George came home third in 1:59.46. Already he had gone farther than any other national at the Olympic Games. All that earned him was an opportunity to return in the evening at 20:44 to race again in the semi-final. The pressure was off a little. He knew what he could do.\n\n\n\nDrawn in lane 5, he finished in 2:00.65, ahead of him the Hungarian, Lazlo Csech in 1:59.50. All was going to plan. Exactly six minutes before his semi-final, two serious contenders had already qualified for the final. Michael Phelps, the hot favourite had won in a relaxed 2:00.01, while the other American, Ryan Lochte, had coasted home in 2:01.41. Everyone was holding back for the big one. And so, the battle lines were drawn for the next day.\n\n\n\nThat's how George found himself in lane 2, poised to win the nation's first Olympic medal in swimming, and the nation's sole medal at the Games.\n\n\n\nThe race was off. Phelps grabbed the lead from the start and never relinquished it in a wire to wire win. At the end of the first 50m Lochte was back in fifth, George in sixth. At the end of the second 50m, the backstroke, George maintained his position.\n\n\n\nGenerally, George has a pretty good idea where he is in a race. As he put it, \"I checked my rearview mirror.\" What his rearview mirror showed was that he was still in sixth position. Half of the race was over and it was time to make a move.\n\n\n\nChecking the rearview mirror isn't the only thing on George's mind during the race. All in a flash, he considers if he is doing his stroke properly, how hard he is pushing himself, and how he judges the distance from the wall so that he can execute his turns smoothly. At the same time, he is checking out the opposition. Who's out fast, and from his experience, who's a fast finisher. In other words, George has a panoramic view of the race.\n\n\n\nAt the start of the third leg, the breaststroke, Lochte's and George's positions remain unchanged. It was on the third 50m that George made his move, swimming powerfully into second position. He traversed the third phase of the race in 33.95 seconds to move him into second spot behind the flying Phelps. Lochte remained fifth, but not for long. At this point, George seemed to have a lock on the silver. That was until Lochte made his move slicing through the last 50m, the freestyle, in 28.19 to George's 28.64.\n\n\n\nGeorge and Ryan Lochte were no strangers. They had swum competitively on several occasions, and George had had the better of him. Not today in the Olympic final when it counted most. Lochte's surge carried him from fifth to second, just enough to grab silver from George by two hundredths of a second.\n\n\n\nGeorge was on cloud nine. \"That was sweet,\" he exulted. \"I've been in a couple of world championship finals, finishing in fourth or fifth. So I'm just ecstatic about finally finishing in the top three, especially at the Olympic Games. It's just surreal; a dream come true.

We didn't work the freestyle too much, so I was just a little worried about George getting home.\"\n\n\n\nAnil's reference was to George's shoulder injury a few days before.\n\n\n\nGeorge's parents and coaches were ecstatic.

It was really a great moment and it will live on. Young people should go and watch that race, read the interviews and know that George Bovell III was a national hero.\n\nGeorge Bovell III: I always felt like the underdog. These big countries have everything, they have massage therapists, they have the best sports science they\u2019ve got everything and me, coming from Trinidad, we have none of those resources. I felt a sense of pride that we can reach that level despite where we\u2019re coming from because, now, we have the National Aquatic Centre, back then we have very terrible facilities, very Third World. I don\u2019t think at the time I really understood the significance of what it meant to (get) a medal for Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nOnly now, as I\u2019m out of the sport, that I can look back and say \u2018wow, maybe I blazed a trail and inspired many people\u2019. I was hoping at the time that I inspired a lot of people because I see people in Trinidad, the youths especially, and it\u2019s not that we lack opportunities, a lot of times we just lack motivation. They can never imagine that they too could be great. It\u2019s like a mental block.\n\nPeople tend to just accept mediocrity and say \u2018I\u2019m okay with just going to the Olympics\u2019. It\u2019s something I hope would just change the way we think and start to hold ourselves to a higher standard. The irony is that was my last 200 IM. A few months after that, I had a terrible knee injury and it ended my ability to swim the breaststroke properly. I had to face that reality and say either I change and go for something else or retire and say I had a good run.\n\nI bounced back to (get) a World Championship medal (bronze in the 50-metre freestyle in Barcelona, Spain in 2013) and be in an Olympic final, in the 50m freestyle, which is a completely different race. Of course, there are injuries along the way.\n\nI think that the bronze (at Athens), in a way, was a blessing. If I had won the gold medal, I think I would have become too proud. Personally, my belief, along with many other people, I doubt the legitimacy of Michael Phelps. I see the Olympic size of reality tv show and, from my own belief, that number two drop to number three, on that day, I think that with clean, fair and honourable competition, I was the best.\n\nIt does not matter of you\u2019re fighting cancer, taking chemotherapy, you\u2019re struggling to feed your family or competing in sport, life gives you a challenge. And if you have the perfect excuse, as long as you have the mental willpower to resist that excuse and keep pushing, you are a champion."}, {"url": "https://newsday.co.tt/2020/04/08/bovell-relies-on-the-hammer-of-justice/", "page_content": "Bovell relies on the \u2018hammer of justice\u2019\n\nGeorge Bovell III, showing off the 'hammer of justice' -\n\nGEORGE BOVELL III was TT\u2019s lone Olympic medallist at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece.\n\nBovell III, then 21 years of age, copped bronze in the men\u2019s 200-metre individual medley, becoming the first, and only, TT swimmer, to medal at the Games.\n\nRecently, Bovell III and his coach Anil Roberts spoke about the journey they both shared \u2013 leading up to the 2004 Games, as well as the event itself.\n\nHere is Part Two of the journey\u2026\n\nAnil Roberts (AR): We moved on to the 200IM a few days later. We were a little bit short of training, so I didn\u2019t want him to overdo and overpush. In the heats, we had a strategy of just doing the first 100 at about 75-80 percent, get a lead, then cool it and make sure he\u2019s in the top 16 for the semi-finals. I told him that, in the semi-final, the key is still to conserve energy because we are not as fit as we want to be. So (he\u2019ll) swim through and, in the last 20-25 metres, shut it down and make sure that you qualify for the final.\n\nCome second (and) let Laszlo Cseh from Hungary pass you. I had to insist that there was no medal in the semi-final. It was more important that he saved every bit of energy for the final. He listened and he did everything to perfection. George Bovell III (GB): I was preparing myself for the struggle of my life coming up, the 200 (metre) IM. I want to give you a quote, to describe how the 200m IM is. It\u2019s about holding up a heavy weight that gets heavier and heavier with every passing second, and it crushes you.\n\nYou\u2019re maintaining that impossible rhythm of exertion while executing mastery of technique, not one but all four strokes, and the transitions between the strokes. Total exhaustion must come long before the end of the race. You must have a really strong mind to force the body to hold on that rhythm and survive, to keep going, without drowning. That\u2019s what the 200m IM is all about.\n\nIn the heats, I really played it cool. In the semi-final, I\u2019m stacked up against a man I expect to beat to get a medal. Swimming is not only about physical condition, there is a lot of mind games that happen. I could have pushed and beat him. In the home leg, I slowed down and gave him a false sense of power over me, for him to feel like he broke (my spirit). I had to pull out all of the tricks in my book because my body was like 60 percent, because of my shoulder. That was a tactic that paid off well in the final.\n\nBovell III finished third in the second semi-final, in a time of two minutes 0.31 seconds, trailing Cseh (1:59.65) and Brazil\u2019s Thiago Pereira (2:00.07).\n\nAR: George qualified for the final, to be in lane two. We were going against Michael Phelps, (Ryan) Lochte and Cseh. In swimming, you have 25 minutes before the final where they\u2019ll go into a \u2018ready\u2019 room. Just before I was to send him down into the room, I was seeing nervousness. I tried different things but I had to be careful because, in a high-pressure situation, you don\u2019t want to add too much pressure because it will bring negative results. I just wasn\u2019t getting it.\n\n(Roberts called Bahamian swimmer Jeremy Knowles, his teammate at Auburn University). I said, \u2018I want you to talk to George, I need you to get him ready, he\u2019s looking a little nervous\u2019. Jeremy took aside and I went out of earshot. I saw Jeremy take out a marker that he had in his pocket and he drew something on the inside of his right bicep.\n\nWhatever he did, I saw this look of confidence, of self-esteem, of relaxation. George looked at me and I said, \u2018let\u2019s go\u2019. He went and had the swim of a lifetime.\n\nGB: This is everything that you wanted. You have a little voice that comes up in the back of your mind that tells you \u2018don\u2019t mess this up\u2019. Before the final, everyone must go into a room, a very small room where you wait about 20 minutes. It\u2019s very intense in this room. I was preparing myself since I had the injury, to lay my life on the line. A friend of mine came up to me and drew this hammer on my bicep.\n\nI had a reputation (and was) called the \u2018hammer of justice\u2019. If you\u2019re racing against somebody and you are very tired, and you know the other person is very tired too, and you speed up, even though you cannot sustain that acceleration, eventually what starts to happen is that the person you\u2019re racing against, who\u2019s looking over at you, they say \u2018whey boy, George he\u2019s fresh\u2019 and they eventually give up, and you break their spirit.\n\nWhen they have given up and drop back, then you can relax the pace. When you break somebody\u2019s spirit like that, in practice, that\u2019s called \u2018dropping the hammer of justice\u2019. I used to do this to people.\n\nAR: His normal freestyle split could have 28.16, it was 29.0, but it was still good enough to give him that bronze medal. Guess who he beat for the bronze medal? The very said Laszlo Cseh who, the day before, he had allowed him to pass. George made history, it was a proud effort. It was the hammer of justice which was drawn on his bicep by Knowles which brought him into the mental state of readiness, to perform. The hammer of justice represented how George used to train with his teammates when they were under pressure. George\u2019s father was the manager and I was the coach, we fell down in the pool deck, hugging up. All the countries were so happy because they love when small countries get on the podium because, in swimming, it\u2019s very rare. It was a great time and it still goes down in history as the greatest swimming moment for TT. I was so proud of George.\n\nGB: Even though my body was physically weak, I had competed in six races already. I had doubts about my physical strength. When (Knowles) drew that marker on me, it reminded me (that) my soul is strong, I am a warrior. I was ready to lay it all out. I had to pace it, I was physically weak, I was seventh after the first (part). In the backstroke I started to dig, started to put some energy and make up some ground.\n\nI felt so weak at the end of that backstroke and I couldn\u2019t believe this was happening in the final. I had a moment of weakness. In that moment of weakness comes the perfect excuse \u2013 the exhaustion, the injury. I was so tempted to take that excuse and just slow down. I didn\u2019t feel like how I hoped to feel in the Olympics final. I pushed through the pain and I kept accelerating.\n\n(Bovell III admitted that, during the turn and push-off for the breaststroke, he gained a lot of ground on his rivals).\n\nI started to push the breaststroke like a fire burning in my heart. I kept accelerating as if the end of the breaststroke was the end of the race.\n\nI moved up into second at the end of the breaststroke. Laszlo Cseh, the man next to me, I think he expected me to break. I kept my rhythm and it caused him to panic a little bit and lose his composure. I think it\u2019s because of the tactic I played in the semi-final gave me a psychological advantage over him.\n\nMy freestyle was not a strong as usual, so I kept pushing and pushing. An interesting thing happened, when I touched the wall, it showed me in second place and then the clock had me in third place, it switched places with Lochte and myself.\n\nSome people say America owns it because NBC has the tv rights, and a one-two America finish is good for the ratings. I came out of the ball with a headache, but a great sense of relief."}]}
