But there was compensation better than dollars and cents in the universal respect which Barnie, like Harry Wright, enjoyed in the base ball world.\" - from Sporting Life's obituary of Billy Barnie\n\nBilly Barnie played four seasons in the majors and managed 14 years. His playing seasons were in 1874-1875, 1883, and 1886. During his playing days, his appearances were split about equally between catcher and outfield. As a catcher, he made 76 errors in 53 games, while as an outfielder he made 23 errors in 46 games. His batting average was .171. He began managing in 1882 and spent 9 years with the Baltimore Orioles in the American Association. He then managed three teams in the National League. None of his teams finished higher than 3rd. When he wasn't managing in the AA or the NL, Barnie managed the Scranton Coal Heavers in the Eastern League in 1895, the Hartford Bluebirds in the Atlantic League in 1896, and the Hartford Indians in the EL from 1899 until mid-1900. He also was an umpire in the National League and American Association between 1882 and 1892.\n\nSporting Life of July 21, 1900 carried his lengthy obituary, calling him \"one of the best known base ball men in the country\". It stated that he started in amateur ball at a very young age in 1865. He was primarily a catcher during his playing career, but when he became \"crippled in one hand\" he started to manage. In addition to a long career as a manager, he was also the organizer and part owner of the Hartford club. He was given credit for discovering a number of famous major leaguers, including King Kelly. He served on the rules and scheduling committees of the American Association and is responsible for at least one rule change that endures to this day, the creation of the Coaches box, down the two base lines. He made the suggestion to confine coaches to such a box after a number of team had taken to the habit of having their third base coach interfere in the play by running down with a baserunner in order to draw a throw, and do various other unsporting gestures; Arlie Latham of the St. Louis Browns was a particularly enthusiastic offender. The rule was adopted at his suggestion in the middle of the 1886 season.\n\n\n\n\n\nYear-by-Year Managerial Record [ edit ]\n\nFurther Reading [ edit ]\n\nMarty Payne: \"Beer Tanks and Barbed Wire: Bill Barnie and Baltimore\", in The Baseball Research Journal, SABR, Volume 42, Number 1 (Spring 2013), pp. 25-29."}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/barnibi01.shtml", "page_content": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhen was Billy Barnie born?\n\nBilly Barnie was born on January 26, 1853.\n\nWhere was Billy Barnie born?\n\nBilly Barnie was born in New York, NY.\n\nHow tall was Billy Barnie?\n\nBilly Barnie was 5-7 (170 cm) tall.\n\nHow much did Billy Barnie weigh when playing?\n\nBilly Barnie weighed 157 lbs (71 kg) when playing.\n\nHow many seasons did Billy Barnie play?\n\nBilly Barnie played 4 seasons.\n\nIs Billy Barnie in the Hall of Fame?\n\nBilly Barnie has not been elected into the Hall of Fame.\n\nWhat position did Billy Barnie play?\n\nBilly Barnie was a Catcher and Rightfielder.\n\nHow many hits did Billy Barnie have?\n\nBilly Barnie had 55 hits over his career.\n\nHow many home runs did Billy Barnie have?\n\nBilly Barnie had home runs over his career.\n\nWhat was Billy Barnie's average?\n\nBilly Barnie had a .171 average over his career.\n\nHow many teams has Billy Barnie played for?\n\nBilly Barnie played for 4 teams; the Hartford Dark Blues, New York Mutuals, Keokuk Westerns and Baltimore Orioles.\n\nWhen did Billy Barnie retire?\n\nBilly Barnie last played in 1886.\n\nWhat are Billy Barnie's nicknames?\n\nBald Billy is a nickname for Billy Barnie."}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=barnibi01", "page_content": "Billy Barnie was born on Wednesday, January 26, 1853, in New York, New York.

He also managed the Orioles (1883-91), Washington Senators (1892), Louisville Colonels (1893-4) and Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1897-8).\n\nA New York native, Barnie started playing on local teams in 1870 before turning pro. He joined Hartford in 1874 and, as a rookie, led the league\u2026 in strikeouts (with 13). He also had a .184/.188./.226 slash line. The following season, he played in 10 games for the Keokuk (Iowa) Westerns, hitting .111. The Westerns folded after going 1-12 in their first 13 games, and Barnie signed on with the Mutuals as a backup to catcher/manager Nat Hicks. He had 5 hits in 34 at-bats for New York, bringing his 1875 batting average up to .129. Barnie would go on to insert himself into a few games when he was managing the Orioles and even had a .200 average in 17 games in 1883. All total, he hit .171 in 83 career games, with 55 hits, 23 RBIs and 32 runs scored.\n\nBarnie finished his full-time playing career in independent leagues. While nursing a hand injury in 1877 while playing for Buffalo of the League Alliance in 1877, the 24-year-old was given his first change to manage a ballclub. He\u2019d play a few seasons more, including the San Francisco Knickerbockers of the Pacific League, but his future in baseball would lie in managing.\n\nBarnie was a part of The Baseball Convention of 1881, which gave rise to the American Association as a competitor to the National League. Earlier that year, he\u2019d helped organize the Eastern Championship Association and ran the Brooklyn Atlantics team, so he was already familiar with getting a new league off the ground. He wanted a team of his own, but his financial backing was lacking. He and his partner A.J. Houck did get the Baltimore franchise in late 1882, and Barnie would spend the next 9 years as its manager.\n\nThe Orioles didn\u2019t see that much success under Barnie\u2019s tenure as part owner and manager, finishing as high as third just once. The Baltimore Sun said, \u201c\u2026his kind-hearted and easy-going ways causing players to impose on him and preventing him from making changes at times that would have been of benefit.\u201d He was succeeded by Ned Hanlon who, in his quietly ruthless way, made the changes that needed to be made for the good of the team. The Orioles would go on to win the AA championship three times under Hanlon.\n\nBarnie agreed to helm the NL\u2019s Senators in 1892. That arrangement lasted just 2 games. It seems like there was a power struggle between Barnie and the new owner. The Boston Globe reported on January 7 that Washington\u2019s shareholders put Barnie in charge of the club. Ten days later, though, it was reported that George Wagner had acquired 26 of the 29 shares, giving him absolute power. The Senators started the season with two losses, and Barnie, though he said he was given the change to manage for the whole season, was let go. No reason was given for his termination, he said.\n\nBarnie spent the rest of his life bouncing between managerial assignments in the National League and independent leagues. His time in Louisville ended when the 1895 Colonels won just 35 games while losing 95. His final run in the National League with the Bridegrooms lasted until 1898, when he was fired by Brooklyn as one of Charles Ebbets\u2019 first moves as the new owner. In 14 years as a pro manager, he went 470-548 for a .462 win %. He was credited with mentoring stars like King Kelly, Matt Kilroy and Mike Griffin. Ironically, Griffin would eventually be Barnie\u2019s replacement as the Brooklyn manager, following Ebbets\u2019 short-lived attempt at managing his own team.\n\nBarnie kept managing in the Eastern League, first in Springfield and then, until his death, in Hartford. Though he was said to be the \u201cpicture of health\u201d when he went to attend an Elks meeting in Atlantic City in early July 1900, he took ill. He returned to Hartford and died there on July 15 of pneumonia. He was 47 years old. Barnie is buried in the Paterson Family plot in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nOddly, it was the second time that an Elks meeting in Atlantic City proved to be disastrous to his health.
