{"Ernest Miller worked on over 200 films during his career.": [{"url": "https://wikimili.com/en/Ernest_Miller", "page_content": "In June 1999, Miller had a dancing contest with Disco Inferno , who he attacked in jealously over the fans's attention. They fought in Bash at the Beach in a \"dance match\" with the stipulation that the loser could not dance anymore (though this stipulation was removed at Bash at the Beach), with Miller winning thanks to Onoo. The Cat's next opponent would be Buff Bagwell , who became famous by doing an impersonation of Miller with a bald cap and black face paint. The two met at Road Wild , but this time Onoo's help backfired when he accidentally hit the wrong man with a briefcase, making Miller lose the match. After that, the two broke up and Onoo left WCW. [3]\n\nMiller then began a minor feud with Kaz Hayashi , as Onoo has been previously Hayashi's manager and had left him to manage Miller. Ernest won several matches over Hayashi with Onoo's help, and also enlisted Perry Saturn as his ally. However, Saturn suffered many losses against inferior opponents due to Miller's botched interference, so the two faced off at Starrcade , where Saturn won. Miller continued coming out and challenging the fans, the wrestlers, and anyone else to try and take him out, feuding with Scott Norton . For a time, he started coming out with the snow machine and music of Glacier, which Onoo had \"purchased\", but it was short-lived, and he soon returned to his James Brown music. In March 1999, Miller and Onoo attacked fellow martial artist Jerry Flynn , with Ernest cutting off Flynn's ponytail as a sign of disrespect. They all faced off in Uncensored in a handicap match, but Flyinn defeated them both. Miller bounced back after some time, getting a win over Scott Norton after hitting him with a crowbar . He and Norton were scheduled to wrestle in The Great American Bash , but Norton was pulled out for health problems and replaced with Horace Hogan , who Miller defeated after kicking him with a steel-tipped red dancing shoe. [3]\n\nAs a villain, Miller adopted an arrogant, Muhammad Ali -like trash-talking personality, calling himself \"The Greatest\" and gloating that he could beat anybody within two minutes, which he often did using his signature kicks. It was also around this time that Ernest began wearing ruby slippers in the ring and dancing in a James Brown -esque fashion to celebrate his victories. He would claim on Nitro that he knew the actual James Brown, leading to a pay-per-view \"dance-off\" between Miller and Brown, who had been brought in specially. Miller even went as far promoting his own instructional, karate home video with a pseudo infomercial. This served as a comedic parody to Billy Blanks ' Tae Bo exercise videos which were quite popular at the time. Miller and Onoo also did comedy duo routines similar to Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan 's characters from the film Rush Hour . [4]\n\nCommissioner (2000\u20132001)\n\nMiller became a jobber for a long time, until he was chosen as Eric Bischoff's assistant. His role initially was composed of following Bischoff wherever he went and repeating whatever Bischoff said for comedic effect, but he was eventually appointed WCW Commissioner in 2000. As a commissioner, his motivations were the ratings and impressing the people in charge, and he often booked super matches for the main events. During this time, he got in a storyline where the Jung Dragons stalked him and tried to attack him, but Miller usually fended them off. In July 2000, Miller outlawed WCW United States Heavyweight Champion Scott Steiner's finisher, the Steiner Recliner, with the pretext of being too dangerous. Miller continued interfering in Steiner's reign, helping Mike Awesome during their fight in Bash at the Beach by disqualifying Steiner and stripping him of the title. Miller then feuded with yet another Japanese wrestler, The Great Muta, leading to a match at New Blood Rising. Although Muta used his Asian mist to blind Miller at one point, Ernest's ally Tygress interfered to hit Muta with a chair, which allowed Miller to land his finishing move for the victory.\n\nAfter this match, he started to slowly turn into a fan favorite due to the high fan reaction he was getting whenever he entered an arena, coming to a rivalry with Mike Sanders from the Natural Born Thrillers stable, who sought to be the new commissioner. Miller offered Sanders a kickboxing match for the role, something which naturally had Mike afraid, but he agreed. During the match, Miller dominated three rounds, but at the last one he was attacked by Sanders's partner Shane Douglas, who pulled him out of the ring and made him being counted out. Angry at losing the commissionership, Miller kept chasing Douglas for the next months, enlisting Miss Jones as his valet to counter Douglas' Torrie Wilson. Ernest and Douglas fought at Mayhem, where Miller won after Jones overpowered Wilson and gave Miller his old loaded red shoe, which he used to knock Shane out.\n\nMiller then became an enemy of Lance Storm, the leader of Team Canada, wrestling at Starrcade. The former karate champion had to endure many interferences from Major Gunns and Elix Skipper, but although he and Miss Jones kept them at bay, she accidentally knocked the referee out with a misguided kick, which allowed a reluctant Hacksaw Jim Duggan to attack Miller, making him lose. Right after, Team Canada turned on Duggan and beat him down, until Miller saved him. Ernest turned again to get the commissioner's spot and challenged Sanders for it, but Mike wanted none of it, bringing KroniK as mercenaries to take him down and putting the role on the line only if Miller accepted to give him Miss Jones's services. Miller and Sanders fought at Sin, where Sanders tried to hit The Cat with a chair, but Miss Jones impeded it. KroniK and Natural Born Thrillers came to finally put Ernest away, but then it was revealed that KroniK had been secretly hired by Miller, which turned them against Sanders and made Miller win the match, regaining his place as the WCW commissioner.\n\nMiller's victory was short-lived, as Lance Storm came to reclaim the commissioner role with Ric Flair and his Magnificent Seven's help. Storm managed to defeat Ernest for the job and used the commissionership to aid his Team Canada, but Miller chased him and got a match for the role at SuperBrawl Revenge, where he won with Miss Jones's aid, gaining it back. The karate champion then started a feud with Chris Kanyon, who attacked Miss Jonnes to the point to put her in the hospital. Miller even gave up his role as commissioner in order to get a shot at Kanyon, chasing him for months and even having a street fight in Jones's hospital room. Kanyon then attacked Miller's limo driver, M.I. Smooth. At Greed, Miller and Kanyon faced, with The Cat having to protect Miss Jones during the match, but he was victorious with Jones and Smooth's help. Miller and his drive feuded with Kanyon and his ally, Road Warrior Animal, but the feud never had a conclusion due to the purchase of WCW by Vince McMahon in March 2001.\n\nMiller had two years on his WCW contract; as a result, he decided to stay at home for the two years to take care of his children. [5] Miller also appeared at some World Wrestling All-Stars shows in early 2002 and independent shows before going to the WWE where he would have a somewhat brief career."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/ernest.miller/2424363", "page_content": "Ernest Miller\n\ncinematographer\n\nMarch 7, 1885 (age 72) Pasadena, California, United States of America\n\nHe had nearly 350 film and television credits to his name, mostly Westerns, including some of the early episodes of Gunsmoke.

Miller was a karate instructor and was teaching Bischoff\u2019s son Garett, when Bischoff asked him to become a wrestler.\n\nMiller made his WCW debut when he saved Glacier from a two-on-one attack by Wrath and Mortis at the WCW Slamboree 1997 PPV. Initially thought as just a fan who had jumped the railing, the WCW commentators then realized that this was no ordinary man and he was in fact the three-time karate champion Ernest Miller.

Miller and Lamont proceeded to dance to his theme music, not bothering to capitalize on the advantage he\u2019d been given. When Benoit and Orton got back up, both men quickly tossed him from the ring. During his time, his catchphrase, \"somebody call my momma\" (which was also used in WCW), started to be used in WWE. This phrase also appeared in the lyrics to his theme song, which he would dance to. Miller then competed in a 15-man battle royal on SmackDown! to earn a shot at the WWE Championship against then Champion Brock Lesnar at No Way Out, but was once again thrown out during his theme song. Following this, he started a short-lived feud with Tajiri after Tajiri attacked Lamont with his trademark Buzzsaw Kick. After the feud ended, Miller was released from WWE on February 10, 2004.\n\nIn 2012 his old theme song was then recycled for the entrance of Brodus Clay\u2019s new \"Funkasaurus\" gimmick. Brodus Clay also started to use his phrase, \u2018Somebody better call my momma\u2019.

In this rare interview, \"The Cat\" who is widely known for his time working alongside Glacier in WCW as well as the infamous James Brown WCW SuperBrawl appearance opens up in this excerpt about his short run in WWE and why things may not have worked out the way everyone had hoped. The full episode can be downloaded at this link.\n\nPLEASE CREDIT CHAD & JP OF THE TWO MAN POWER TRIP OF WRESTLING FOR THIS TRANSCRIPTION\n\n\n\nWhat did he do immediately after WCW closed:\n\n\n\n\"I never thought about that being the end of my wrestling career because you only end your wrestling career if you get hurt or you end it yourself because can't nobody end your career because there's too much out there.\"\n\n\"I knew I could go to WWE anytime because I saw people going over there that I had worked with and had heard that Vince McMahon really liked my character so I knew that I could do that. But you know what? I had a boatload of money, I had a twelve year old son and a two year old daughter and I was like do I want to go back because I had just gotten off the road (280 days a year) and I was ready for a two year vacation. When that came (the WWE buyout of WCW) they said you can go right now or just stay home and collect your money. I said I'm staying home and going to collect my money and I was a stay at home Dad, got to take my son to all of his basketball games, take my daughter to school every day for about two to three years and that is why people didn't hear from me.\"\n\nEventually landing in WWE:\n\n\n\n\"When I went to WWE and I was there for two to three years, once I left them people would ask me what you did then. I left WWE because they said they couldn't write for me. Which I thought was a little strange because how could you not write for somebody like me? I could do so many things and Vince McMahon used to tell me that every day. Every time he'd see me he'd say that you are talented and I'm a fan and you've got so many things you can do that all we have to do is give you a mic and go. But when I got there I saw that things were a little different and they were doing some different things and they did give me an opportunity up there and I was happy and I still appreciate them giving me the opportunity to work with them at WWE. When I left wrestling I didn't realize that I wasn't thinking about going back to wrestling I was thinking about going right back to karate and teaching and building my business. For the first two to three years or maybe a little bit longer I didn't even do Indy shows. I was getting calls from Dubai and Germany and from all over the world.\"\n\nWhy he didn't have a long tenure with WWE:\n\n\n\n\"I was good at it but it just wasn't my time. They wanted me to wrestle and I didn't understand at the time but I understand now what they were talking about. They wanted me to go and develop myself and come right back. That is what they told me. If you go and develop yourself as a wrestler go develop yourself on the Indy circuit and we will come back and get you. But I didn't know the business. In the NFL when I tried out for the Atlanta Falcons and they release you and let you go, they aren't thinking about you when they release or coming to get you in a couple of games it is just over. But the way wrestling is totally different is that they actually told me to go hit the Indy circuit and get established your character and come back here. But me, I failed to understand that with me being so new to the business that I just said I am going to go back to karate.\"\n\nStarting to wrestle again:\n\n\n\n\"Lately I have been doing Indy shows and for some reason I've got the itch to be back in the ring and each time I do something or do a show I forget how good I was. I know that sounds kind of arrogant but I forget how but when I did a show in Chicago, the guy gave me the mic. When he gave me the mic some of the crowd knew me but a lot of them were real little kids but by the time I got out the mic the whole crowd was with me and I said to myself that damn I am good.\"\n\nFor this and every other episode of The Two Man Power Trip of Wrestling and The Triple Threat Podcast featuring \"The Franchise\" Shane Douglas please subscribe to us on iTunes, Spotify, iHeartRadio, Podomatic, and Player FM.

On graduation from high school in 1917, impatient for a less-sheltered environment, he did not enter college but went to Kansas City, where he was employed as a reporter for the Star. He was repeatedly rejected for military service because of a defective eye, but he managed to enter World War I as an ambulance driver for the American Red Cross. On July 8, 1918, not yet 19 years old, he was injured on the Austro-Italian front at Fossalta di Piave. Decorated for heroism and hospitalized in Milan, he fell in love with a Red Cross nurse, Agnes von Kurowsky, who declined to marry him. These were experiences he was never to forget.\n\nBritannica Quiz Writer\u2019s Block\n\nAfter recuperating at home, Hemingway renewed his efforts at writing, for a while worked at odd jobs in Chicago, and sailed for France as a foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star. Advised and encouraged by other American writers in Paris\u2014F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound\u2014he began to see his nonjournalistic work appear in print there, and in 1925 his first important book, a collection of stories called In Our Time, was published in New York City; it was originally released in Paris in 1924.\n\nIn 1926 he published The Sun Also Rises, a novel with which he scored his first solid success. A pessimistic but sparkling book, it deals with a group of aimless expatriates in France and Spain\u2014members of the postwar Lost Generation, a phrase that Hemingway scorned while making it famous. This work also introduced him to the limelight, which he both craved and resented for the rest of his life. Hemingway\u2019s The Torrents of Spring, a parody of the American writer Sherwood Anderson\u2019s book Dark Laughter, also appeared in 1926.\n\nThe writing of books occupied Hemingway for most of the postwar years. He remained based in Paris, but he traveled widely for the skiing, bullfighting, fishing, and hunting that by then had become part of his life and formed the background for much of his writing. His position as a master of short fiction had been advanced by Men Without Women in 1927 and thoroughly established with the stories in Winner Take Nothing in 1933. Among his finest stories are \u201cThe Killers,\u201d \u201cThe Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber,\u201d and \u201cThe Snows of Kilimanjaro.\u201d At least in the public view, however, the novel A Farewell to Arms (1929) overshadowed such works. Reaching back to his experience as a young soldier in Italy, Hemingway developed a grim but lyrical novel of great power, fusing love story with war story. While serving with the Italian ambulance service during World War I, the American lieutenant Frederic Henry falls in love with the English nurse Catherine Barkley, who tends him during his recuperation after being wounded. She becomes pregnant by him, but he must return to his post. Henry deserts during the Italians\u2019 disastrous retreat after the Battle of Caporetto, and the reunited couple flee Italy by crossing the border into Switzerland. There, however, Catherine and her baby die during childbirth, and Henry is left desolate at the loss of the great love of his life.\n\nHemingway\u2019s love of Spain and his passion for bullfighting resulted in Death in the Afternoon (1932), a learned study of a spectacle he saw more as tragic ceremony than as sport. Similarly, a safari he took in 1933\u201334 in the big-game region of Tanganyika resulted in Green Hills of Africa (1935), an account of big-game hunting. Mostly for the fishing, he purchased a house in Key West, Florida, and bought his own fishing boat. A minor novel of 1937 called To Have and Have Not is about a Caribbean desperado and is set against a background of lower-class violence and upper-class decadence in Key West during the Great Depression.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

He raised money for the Republicans in their struggle against the Nationalists under General Francisco Franco, and he wrote a play called The Fifth Column (1938), which is set in besieged Madrid. As in many of his books, the protagonist of the play is based on the author. Following his last visit to the Spanish war, he purchased Finca Vig\u00eda (\u201cLookout Farm\u201d), an unpretentious estate outside Havana, Cuba, and went to cover another war\u2014the Japanese invasion of China.\n\nThe harvest of Hemingway\u2019s considerable experience of Spain in war and peace was the novel For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940), a substantial and impressive work that some critics consider his finest novel, in preference to A Farewell to Arms. It was also the most successful of all his books as measured in sales. Set during the Spanish Civil War, it tells of Robert Jordan, an American volunteer who is sent to join a guerrilla band behind the Nationalist lines in the Guadarrama Mountains. Most of the novel concerns Jordan\u2019s relations with the varied personalities of the band, including the girl Maria, with whom he falls in love. Through dialogue, flashbacks, and stories, Hemingway offers telling and vivid profiles of the Spanish character and unsparingly depicts the cruelty and inhumanity stirred up by the civil war. Jordan\u2019s mission is to blow up a strategic bridge near Segovia in order to aid a coming Republican attack, which he realizes is doomed to fail. In an atmosphere of impending disaster, he blows up the bridge but is wounded and makes his retreating comrades leave him behind, where he prepares a last-minute resistance to his Nationalist pursuers.\n\nAll of his life Hemingway was fascinated by war\u2014in A Farewell to Arms he focused on its pointlessness, in For Whom the Bell Tolls on the comradeship it creates\u2014and, as World War II progressed, he made his way to London as a journalist. He flew several missions with the Royal Air Force and crossed the English Channel with American troops on D-Day (June 6, 1944). Attaching himself to the 22nd Regiment of the 4th Infantry Division, he saw a good deal of action in Normandy and in the Battle of the Bulge. He also participated in the liberation of Paris, and, although ostensibly a journalist, he impressed professional soldiers not only as a man of courage in battle but also as a real expert in military matters, guerrilla activities, and intelligence collection.\n\nFollowing the war in Europe, Hemingway returned to his home in Cuba and began to work seriously again. He also traveled widely, and, on a trip to Africa, he was injured in a plane crash. Soon after (in 1953), he received the Pulitzer Prize in fiction for The Old Man and the Sea (1952), a short heroic novel about an old Cuban fisherman who, after an extended struggle, hooks and boats a giant marlin only to have it eaten by voracious sharks during the long voyage home. This book, which played a role in gaining for Hemingway the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954, was as enthusiastically praised as his previous novel, Across the River and into the Trees (1950), the story of a professional army officer who dies while on leave in Venice, had been damned.\n\nBy 1960 Hemingway had left Cuba and settled in Ketchum, Idaho. (He expressed his belief in what he called the \u201chistorical necessity\u201d of the Cuban Revolution; his attitude toward its leader, Fidel Castro, who had taken power in 1959, varied.) He tried to lead his life and do his work as before. For a while he succeeded, but, anxiety-ridden and depressed, he was twice hospitalized at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where he received electroshock treatments. Two days after his return to the house in Ketchum, he took his life with a shotgun. Hemingway had been married four times: to Hadley Richardson in 1921 (divorced 1927), Pauline Pfeiffer in 1927 (divorced 1940), Martha Gellhorn in 1940 (divorced 1945), and Mary Welsh in 1946. He had fathered three sons: John Hadley Nicanor (\u201cBumby\u201d), with Hadley, born in 1923; Patrick, with Pauline, in 1928; and Gregory, also with Pauline, in 1931.\n\nHemingway left behind a substantial amount of manuscript, some of which has been published. A Moveable Feast, an entertaining memoir of his years in Paris (1921\u201326) before he was famous, was issued in 1964. Islands in the Stream, three closely related novellas growing directly out of his peacetime memories of the Caribbean island of Bimini, of Havana during World War II, and of searching for U-boats off Cuba, appeared in 1970.\n\nHemingway\u2019s characters plainly embody his own values and view of life. The main characters of The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms, and For Whom the Bell Tolls are young men whose strength and self-confidence nevertheless coexist with a sensitivity that leaves them deeply scarred by their wartime experiences. War was for Hemingway a potent symbol of the world, which he viewed as complex, filled with moral ambiguities, and offering almost unavoidable pain, hurt, and destruction. To survive in such a world, and perhaps emerge victorious, one must conduct oneself with honour, courage, endurance, and dignity, a set of principles known as \u201cthe Hemingway code.\u201d To behave well in the lonely, losing battle with life is to show \u201cgrace under pressure\u201d and constitutes in itself a kind of victory, a theme clearly established in The Old Man and the Sea.\n\nHemingway\u2019s prose style was probably the most widely imitated of any in the 20th century. He wished to strip his own use of language of inessentials, ridding it of all traces of verbosity, embellishment, and sentimentality. In striving to be as objective and honest as possible, Hemingway hit upon the device of describing a series of actions by using short, simple sentences from which all comment or emotional rhetoric has been eliminated. These sentences are composed largely of nouns and verbs, have few adjectives and adverbs, and rely on repetition and rhythm for much of their effect. The resulting terse, concentrated prose is concrete and unemotional yet is often resonant and capable of conveying great irony through understatement. Hemingway\u2019s use of dialogue was similarly fresh, simple, and natural-sounding. The influence of this style was felt worldwide wherever novels were written, particularly from the 1930s through the \u201950s.\n\nA consummately contradictory man, Hemingway achieved a fame surpassed by few, if any, American authors of the 20th century. The virile nature of his writing, which attempted to re-create the exact physical sensations he experienced in wartime, big-game hunting, and bullfighting, in fact masked an aesthetic sensibility of great delicacy. He was a celebrity long before he reached middle age, but his popularity continues to be validated by serious critical opinion."}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/ernest-hemingway", "page_content": "(1899-1961)\n\nWho Was Ernest Hemingway?\n\nErnest Hemingway served in World War I and worked in journalism before publishing his story collection In Our Time. He was renowned for novels like The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms, For Whom the Bell Tolls and The Old Man and the Sea, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. In 1954, Hemingway won the Nobel Prize. He committed suicide on July 2, 1961, in Ketchum, Idaho.\n\nEarly Life and Career\n\nErnest Miller Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899, in Cicero (now in Oak Park), Illinois. Clarence and Grace Hemingway raised their son in this conservative suburb of Chicago, but the family also spent a great deal of time in northern Michigan, where they had a cabin. It was there that the future sportsman learned to hunt, fish and appreciate the outdoors.\n\nIn high school, Hemingway worked on his school newspaper, Trapeze and Tabula, writing primarily about sports. Immediately after graduation, the budding journalist went to work for the Kansas City Star, gaining experience that would later influence his distinctively stripped-down prose style.\n\nHe once said, \"On the Star you were forced to learn to write a simple declarative sentence. This is useful to anyone. Newspaper work will not harm a young writer and could help him if he gets out of it in time.\"\n\nMilitary Experience\n\nIn 1918, Hemingway went overseas to serve in World War I as an ambulance driver in the Italian Army. For his service, he was awarded the Italian Silver Medal of Bravery, but soon sustained injuries that landed him in a hospital in Milan.\n\nThere he met a nurse named Agnes von Kurowsky, who soon accepted his proposal of marriage, but later left him for another man. This devastated the young writer but provided fodder for his works \"A Very Short Story\" and, more famously, A Farewell to Arms.\n\nStill nursing his injury and recovering from the brutalities of war at the young age of 20, he returned to the United States and spent time in northern Michigan before taking a job at the Toronto Star.\n\nIt was in Chicago that Hemingway met Hadley Richardson, the woman who would become his first wife. The couple married and quickly moved to Paris, where Hemingway worked as a foreign correspondent for the Star.\n\nLife in Europe\n\nIn Paris, Hemingway soon became a key part of what Gertrude Stein would famously call \"The Lost Generation.\" With Stein as his mentor, Hemingway made the acquaintance of many of the great writers and artists of his generation, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, Pablo Picasso and James Joyce. In 1923, Hemingway and Hadley had a son, John Hadley Nicanor Hemingway. By this time, the writer had also begun frequenting the famous Festival of San Fermin in Pamplona, Spain.\n\nIn 1925, the couple, joining a group of British and American expatriates, took a trip to the festival that would later provide the basis of Hemingway's first novel, The Sun Also Rises. The novel is widely considered Hemingway's greatest work, artfully examining the postwar disillusionment of his generation.\n\nSoon after the publication of The Sun Also Rises, Hemingway and Hadley divorced, due in part to his affair with a woman named Pauline Pfeiffer, who would become Hemingway's second wife shortly after his divorce from Hadley was finalized. The author continued to work on his book of short stories, Men Without Women.\n\nCritical Acclaim\n\nSoon, Pauline became pregnant and the couple decided to move back to America. After the birth of their son Patrick Hemingway in 1928, they settled in Key West, Florida, but summered in Wyoming. During this time, Hemingway finished his celebrated World War I novel A Farewell to Arms, securing his lasting place in the literary canon.\n\nWhen he wasn't writing, Hemingway spent much of the 1930s chasing adventure: big-game hunting in Africa, bullfighting in Spain and deep-sea fishing in Florida. While reporting on the Spanish Civil War in 1937, Hemingway met a fellow war correspondent named Martha Gellhorn (soon to become wife number three) and gathered material for his next novel, For Whom the Bell Tolls, which would eventually be nominated for the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nAlmost predictably, his marriage to Pfeiffer deteriorated and the couple divorced. Gellhorn and Hemingway married soon after and purchased a farm near Havana, Cuba, which would serve as their winter residence.\n\nWhen the United States entered World War II in 1941, Hemingway served as a correspondent and was present at several of the war's key moments, including the D-Day landing. Toward the end of the war, Hemingway met another war correspondent, Mary Welsh, whom he would later marry after divorcing Gellhorn.\n\nIn 1951, Hemingway wrote The Old Man and the Sea, which would become perhaps his most famous book, finally winning him the Pulitzer Prize he had long been denied.\n\nPersonal Struggles and Suicide\n\nThe author continued his forays into Africa and sustained several injuries during his adventures, even surviving multiple plane crashes.\n\nIn 1954, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Even at this peak of his literary career, though, the burly Hemingway's body and mind were beginning to betray him. Recovering from various old injuries in Cuba, Hemingway suffered from depression and was treated for numerous conditions such as high blood pressure and liver disease.\n\nHe wrote A Moveable Feast, a memoir of his years in Paris, and retired permanently to Idaho. There he continued to battle with deteriorating mental and physical health.\n\nEarly on the morning of July 2, 1961, Hemingway committed suicide in his Ketchum home.\n\nLegacy\n\nHemingway left behind an impressive body of work and an iconic style that still influences writers today. His personality and constant pursuit of adventure loomed almost as large as his creative talent.\n\nWhen asked by George Plimpton about the function of his art, Hemingway proved once again to be a master of the \"one true sentence\": \"From things that have happened and from things as they exist and from all things that you know and all those you cannot know, you make something through your invention that is not a representation but a whole new thing truer than anything true and alive, and you make it alive, and if you make it well enough, you give it immortality.\"\n\nIn August 2018, a 62-year-old short story by Hemingway, \"A Room on the Garden Side,\" was published for the first time in The Strand Magazine. Set in Paris shortly after the liberation of the city from Nazi forces in 1944, the story was one of five composed by the writer in 1956 about his World War II experiences. It became the second story from the series to earn posthumous publication, following \"Black Ass at the Crossroads.\"\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Ernest Hemingway\n\nBirth Year: 1899\n\nBirth date: July 21, 1899\n\nBirth State: Illinois\n\nBirth City: Cicero (now in Oak Park)\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Nobel Prize winner Ernest Hemingway is seen as one of the great American 20th century novelists, and is known for works like 'A Farewell to Arms' and 'The Old Man and the Sea.'\n\nIndustries\n\nWriting and Publishing\n\nAstrological Sign: Cancer\n\nSchools\n\nOak Park and River Forest High School\n\nDeath Year: 1961\n\nDeath date: July 2, 1961\n\nDeath State: Idaho\n\nDeath City: Ketchum\n\nDeath Country: United States\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION\n\nArticle Title: Ernest Hemingway Biography\n\nAuthor: Biography.com Editors\n\nWebsite Name: The Biography.com website\n\nUrl: https://www.biography.com/writer/ernest-hemingway\n\nAccess Date:\n\nPublisher: A&E Television Networks\n\nLast Updated: May 7, 2021\n\nOriginal Published Date: April 3, 2014\n\nQUOTES"}, {"url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/ernest-hemingway-1779812", "page_content": "Ernest Hemingway (July 21, 1899\u2013July 2, 1961) is considered one of the most influential writers of the 20th century.

Ed was a general medical practitioner and Grace a would-be opera singer turned music teacher.\n\nHemingway's parents reportedly had an unconventional arrangement, in which Grace, an ardent feminist, would agree to marry Ed only if he could assure her she would not be responsible for the housework or cooking. Ed acquiesced; in addition to his busy medical practice, he ran the household, managed the servants, and even cooked meals when the need arose.\n\nErnest Hemingway grew up with four sisters; his much-longed-for brother did not arrive until Ernest was 15 years old. Young Ernest enjoyed family vacations at a cottage in northern Michigan where he developed a love of the outdoors and learned hunting and fishing from his father. His mother, who insisted that all of her children learn to play an instrument, instilled in him an appreciation of the arts.\n\nIn high school, Hemingway co-edited the school newspaper and competed on the football and swim teams. Fond of impromptu boxing matches with his friends, Hemingway also played cello in the school orchestra. He graduated from Oak Park High School in 1917.\n\nWorld War I\n\nHired by the Kansas City Star in 1917 as a reporter covering the police beat, Hemingway\u2014obligated to adhere to the newspaper's style guidelines\u2014began to develop the succinct, simple style of writing that would become his trademark. That style was a dramatic departure from the ornate prose that dominated literature of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nAfter six months in Kansas City, Hemingway longed for adventure. Ineligible for military service due to poor eyesight, he volunteered in 1918 as an ambulance driver for the Red Cross in Europe. In July of that year, while on duty in Italy, Hemingway was severely injured by an exploding mortar shell. His legs were peppered by more than 200 shell fragments, a painful and debilitating injury that required several surgeries.\n\nAs the first American to have survived being wounded in Italy in World War I, Hemingway was awarded a medal from the Italian government.\n\nWhile recovering from his wounds at a hospital in Milan, Hemingway met and fell in love with Agnes von Kurowsky, a nurse with the American Red Cross. He and Agnes made plans to marry once he had earned enough money.\n\nAfter the war ended in November 1918, Hemingway returned to the United States to look for a job, but the wedding was not to be. Hemingway received a letter from Agnes in March 1919, breaking off the relationship. Devastated, he became depressed and rarely left the house.\n\nBecoming a Writer\n\nHemingway spent a year at his parents' home, recovering from wounds both physical and emotional. In early 1920, mostly recovered and eager to be employed, Hemingway got a job in Toronto helping a woman care for her disabled son. There he met the features editor of the Toronto Star Weekly, which hired him as a feature writer.\n\nIn fall of that year, he moved to Chicago and became a writer for The Cooperative Commonwealth, a monthly magazine, while still working for the Star.\n\nHemingway, however, longed to write fiction. He began submitting short stories to magazines, but they were repeatedly rejected. Soon, however, Hemingway had reason for hope. Through mutual friends, Hemingway met novelist Sherwood Anderson, who was impressed by Hemingway's short stories and encouraged him to pursue a career in writing.\n\nHemingway also met the woman who would become his first wife: Hadley Richardson. A native of St. Louis, Richardson had come to Chicago to visit friends after the death of her mother. She managed to support herself with a small trust fund left to her by her mother. The pair married in September 1921.\n\nSherwood Anderson, just back from a trip to Europe, urged the newly married couple to move to Paris, where he believed a writer's talent could flourish. He furnished the Hemingways with letters of introduction to American expatriate poet Ezra Pound and modernist writer Gertrude Stein. They set sail from New York in December 1921.\n\nLife in Paris\n\nThe Hemingways found an inexpensive apartment in a working-class district in Paris. They lived on Hadley's inheritance and Hemingway's income from the Toronto Star Weekly, which employed him as a foreign correspondent. Hemingway also rented out a small hotel room to use as his workplace.\n\nThere, in a burst of productivity, Hemingway filled one notebook after another with stories, poems, and accounts of his childhood trips to Michigan.\n\nHemingway finally garnered an invitation to the salon of Gertrude Stein, with whom he later developed a deep friendship. Stein's home in Paris had become a meeting place for various artists and writers of the era, with Stein acting as a mentor to several prominent writers.\n\nStein promoted the simplification of both prose and poetry as a backlash to the elaborate style of writing seen in past decades. Hemingway took her suggestions to heart and later credited Stein for having taught him valuable lessons that influenced his writing style.\n\nHemingway and Stein belonged to the group of American expatriate writers in 1920s Paris who came to be known as the \"Lost Generation.\" These writers had become disillusioned with traditional American values following World War I; their work often reflected their sense of futility and despair. Other writers in this group included F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, and John Dos Passos.\n\nIn December 1922, Hemingway endured what might be considered a writer's worst nightmare. His wife, traveling by train to meet him for a holiday, lost a valise filled with a large portion of his recent work, including carbon copies. The papers were never found.\n\nGetting Published\n\nIn 1923, several of Hemingway's poems and stories were accepted for publication in two American literary magazines, Poetry and The Little Review. In the summer of that year, Hemingway's first book, \"Three Stories and Ten Poems,\" was published by an American-owned Paris publishing house.\n\nOn a trip to Spain in the summer of 1923, Hemingway witnessed his first bullfight. He wrote of bullfighting in the Star, seeming to condemn the sport and romanticize it at the same time. On another excursion to Spain, Hemingway covered the traditional \"running of the bulls\" at Pamplona, during which young men\u2014courting death or, at the very least, injury\u2014ran through town pursued by a throng of angry bulls.\n\nThe Hemingways returned to Toronto for the birth of their son. John Hadley Hemingway (nicknamed \"Bumby\") was born October 10, 1923. They returned to Paris in January 1924, where Hemingway continued to work on a new collection of short stories, later published in the book \"In Our Time.\"\n\nHemingway returned to Spain to work on his upcoming novel set in Spain: \"The Sun Also Rises.\" The book was published in 1926, to mostly good reviews.\n\nYet Hemingway's marriage was in turmoil. He had begun an affair in 1925 with American journalist Pauline Pfeiffer, who worked for the Paris Vogue. The Hemingways divorced in January 1927; Pfeiffer and Hemingway married in May of that year. Hadley later remarried and returned to Chicago with Bumby in 1934.\n\nBack to the U.S.\n\nIn 1928, Hemingway and his second wife returned to the United States to live. In June 1928, Pauline gave birth to son Patrick in Kansas City. A second son, Gregory, would be born in 1931. The Hemingways rented a house in Key West, Florida, where Hemingway worked on his latest book, \"A Farewell to Arms,\" based upon his World War I experiences.\n\nIn December 1928, Hemingway received shocking news\u2014his father, despondent over mounting health and financial problems, had shot himself to death. Hemingway, who'd had a strained relationship with his parents, reconciled with his mother after his father's suicide and helped support her financially.\n\nIn May 1928, Scribner's Magazine published its first installment of \"A Farewell to Arms.\" It was well-received; however, the second and third installments, deemed profane and sexually explicit, were banned from newsstands in Boston. Such criticism only served to boost sales when the entire book was published in September 1929.\n\nThe Spanish Civil War\n\nThe early 1930s proved to be a productive (if not always successful) time for Hemingway. Fascinated by bullfighting, he traveled to Spain to do research for the non-fiction book, \"Death in the Afternoon.\" It was published in 1932 to generally poor reviews and was followed by several less-than-successful short story collections.\n\nEver the adventurer, Hemingway traveled to Africa on a shooting safari in November 1933. Although the trip was somewhat disastrous\u2014Hemingway clashed with his companions and later became ill with dysentery\u2014it provided him with ample material for a short story, \"The Snows of Kilimanjaro,\" as well as a non-fiction book, \"Green Hills of Africa.\"\n\nWhile Hemingway was on a hunting and fishing trip in the United States in the summer of 1936, the Spanish Civil War began. A supporter of the loyalist (anti-Fascist) forces, Hemingway donated money for ambulances. He also signed on as a journalist to cover the conflict for a group of American newspapers and became involved in making a documentary. While in Spain, Hemingway began an affair with Martha Gellhorn, an American journalist and documentarian.\n\nWeary of her husband's adulterous ways, Pauline took her sons and left Key West in December 1939. Only months after she divorced Hemingway, he married Martha Gellhorn in November 1940.\n\nWorld War II\n\nHemingway and Gellhorn rented a farmhouse in Cuba just outside of Havana, where both could work on their writing. Traveling between Cuba and Key West, Hemingway wrote one of his most popular novels: \"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\"\n\nA fictionalized account of the Spanish Civil War, the book was published in October 1940 and became a bestseller. Despite being named the winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1941, the book did not win because the president of Columbia University (which bestowed the award) vetoed the decision.\n\nAs Martha's reputation as a journalist grew, she earned assignments around the globe, leaving Hemingway resentful of her long absences. But soon, they would both be globetrotting. After the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in December 1941, both Hemingway and Gellhorn signed on as war correspondents.\n\nHemingway was allowed on board a troop transport ship, from which he was able to watch the D-day invasion of Normandy in June 1944.\n\nThe Pulitzer and Nobel Prizes\n\nWhile in London during the war, Hemingway began an affair with the woman who would become his fourth wife\u2014journalist Mary Welsh. Gellhorn learned of the affair and divorced Hemingway in 1945. He and Welsh married in 1946. They alternated between homes in Cuba and Idaho.\n\nIn January 1951, Hemingway began writing a book that would become one of his most celebrated works: \"The Old Man and the Sea.\" A bestseller, the novella also won Hemingway his long-awaited Pulitzer Prize in 1953.\n\nThe Hemingways traveled extensively but were often the victims of bad luck. They were involved in two plane crashes in Africa during one trip in 1953. Hemingway was severely injured, sustaining internal and head injuries as well as burns. Some newspapers erroneously reported that he had died in the second crash.\n\nIn 1954, Hemingway was awarded the career-topping Nobel Prize for literature.\n\nDecline and Death\n\nIn January 1959, the Hemingways moved from Cuba to Ketchum, Idaho. Hemingway, now nearly 60 years old, had suffered for several years with high blood pressure and the effects of years of heavy drinking. He had also become moody and depressed and appeared to be deteriorating mentally.\n\nIn November 1960, Hemingway was admitted to the Mayo Clinic for treatment of his physical and mental symptoms. He received electroshock therapy for his depression and was sent home after a two-month stay. Hemingway became further depressed when he realized he was unable to write after the treatments.\n\nAfter three suicide attempts, Hemingway was readmitted to the Mayo Clinic and given more shock treatments. Although his wife protested, he convinced his doctors he was well enough to go home. Only days after being discharged from the hospital, Hemingway shot himself in the head in his Ketchum home early on the morning of July 2, 1961. He died instantly.\n\nLegacy\n\nA larger-than-life figure, Hemingway thrived on high adventure, from safaris and bullfights to wartime journalism and adulterous affairs, communicating that to his readers in an immediately recognizable spare, staccato format. Hemingway is among the most prominent and influential of the \"Lost Generation\" of expatriate writers who lived in Paris in the 1920s.\n\nKnown affectionately as \"Papa Hemingway,\" he was awarded both the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize in literature, and several of his books were made into movies.\n\nSources"}], "The Ten Commandments was released in 1923.": [{"url": "https://www.film-foundation.org/ten-commandments-hfpa", "page_content": "Out of the Vaults: \u201cThe Ten Commandments\u201d, 1923\n\nMeher Tatna 11/12/2020\n\nIn May 1923, Adolph Zukor, head of Paramount Pictures, sent director Cecil B. deMille a telegram: \u201cYou have lost your mind. Stop filming and return to Los Angeles at once.\u201d\n\nThe director was in the middle of shooting his epic The Ten Commandments at the Guadalupe Nipomo Dunes in Central California. A gigantic set had been erected as Ramses\u2019 city by 500 carpenters and 600 painters and decorators. It included a 120 foot-tall temple, five enormous sphinxes, a 100-foot Great Gate, statues of the Pharaoh, and a 750-foot long city wall which deMille insisted on as he wouldn\u2019t work with painted backgrounds. Also constructed was the \u2018City of deMille,\u2019 the 24 square-mile tent city which held the cast, extras and crew of 2,500, along with 3,000 animals.\n\nThe director responded to Zukor: \u201cI cannot and will not make pictures with a yardstick.\u201d According to author Sumiko Higashi in her book \u201cCecil B. DeMille and American Culture: The Silent Era,\u201d he said, \u201cWhat do they want me to do? Stop now and release it as The Five Commandments?\u201d There was, in fact, no stopping. Filming in this location took a breakneck three weeks. A Los Angeles Times article quoted deMille as telling his actors, \u201cYour skin will be cooked raw. You will miss the comforts of home. You will be asked to endure perhaps the most unpleasant location in cinema history. I expect of you your supreme efforts.\u201d\n\nAfter the shoot wrapped, deMille was required to strike his set before departing. But the expense was too great. Rather than abandon it, and fearing rival filmmakers might use it to make cheap knockoffs, he dynamited the structures and bulldozed sand over them. (The set was discovered in 2004 and excavated piece by remaining piece in a number of attempts over several years.)\n\nThe Ten Commandments cost $1,475,836.93 and grossed $4,169,798.38 in unadjusted dollars in its initial release. It was Paramount\u2019s highest-grossing film for 25 years until deMille himself broke that record. In his 1959 autobiography, deMille wrote, \u201cThe really important question to ask about a motion picture is not \u2018What did it cost?\u2019 but \u2018What is it worth?\u2019 The real worth of a picture cannot be measured in money alone. As soon as The Ten Commandments was completed, I screened it for Jesse Lasky and Sid Kent [Paramount sales department head]. The next day Kent wired Mr. Zukor: \u2018The Ten Commandments is not a motion picture. It is bigger than all the motion pictures that have been made. It plays on the emotion in a manner that I have never felt or witnessed before and will do more good than all the combined pulpits of the country.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe reaction must have been a relief to deMille who was trying to salvage his reputation after a string of flops, the latest being Adam\u2019s Rib, one of a series of light comedic films which underperformed at the Famous Players-Lasky studio where he was contracted before it became Paramount Pictures.\n\nTo find subject matter that directly appealed to the audience, deMille had sponsored a contest in the LA Times on October 9, 1922, soliciting suggestions from the public. The article was titled \u2018Cecil de Mille Offer of $1,000 Can be Captured by Originator of Best Film Idea.\u2019 Thousands responded. He chose the one submitted by F.C. Nelson, a Michigan man, that said, \u2018You cannot break the Ten Commandments \u2013 they will break you.\u2019\n\nThe film, written by Jeanie MacPherson, is devised in two parts. The Biblical Prologue is preceded by this intertitle to set up the film: \u201cOur modern world defined God as a \u2018religious complex\u2019 and laughed at the Ten Commandments as OLD FASHIONED. Then, through the laughter, came the shattering thunder of the World War. And now a blood-drenched, bitter world \u2013 no longer laughing \u2013 cries for a way out.\u201d Most of the intertitles in the prologue are Biblical quotes.\n\nThe prologue, which is about 45 minutes, is about Moses (played by Theodore Roberts) and Rameses\u2019 (Charles de Roche) as they clash over the freeing of the enslaved Hebrews in Egypt where they are laboring under the cruel Pharaoh. A series of plagues, including the taking of every family\u2019s first-born son, causes Ramses to allow the Exodus, after which he changes his mind and pursues the Hebrews in a spectacular chariot chase, only to lose them to the parting of the Red Sea. Moses then goes to the Mount to receive the ten commandments for 40 days and nights, only to return to the debaucheries of his people, worshipping a Golden Calf and participating in hedonistic displays. Prominent among them is the fetching Miriam (Estelle Taylor). Moses invokes the Wrath of God upon them, Miriam is afflicted by leprosy, the sinners are struck down by lightning, the film dissolves into the present day (1923) where part two, the Modern Story, begins.\n\nNow the audience meets the MacTavishes \u2013 the fundamentalist zealot Martha (Edythe Chapman), and her sons John (Richard Dix) and Dan (Rod LaRoque). Both fall in love with the same woman, Mary (Leatrice Joy), but it\u2019s Dan who wins her and they split from the family, disavowing the mother\u2019s religion. Flash forward three years and now Dan is a successful building contractor, slowly breaking all ten commandments on the road to success, while the pious John has remained at home with the mother and continues his carpenter trade. In the melodrama that ensues, Dan is punished for his sins, but only after he builds a church with adulterated concrete, hires his brother to take the fall, watches his mother die when a wall collapses on her, shoots his mistress (Nita Naldi playing a stereotypical Asian whore), and drowns in a storm when he tries to escape on a speedboat. John and Mary are reunited and live happily ever after reading the Bible.\n\nThe Biblical Prologue was the kind of film that made deMille\u2019s reputation as a director of spectacles. The impressive sets, thousands of extras, special effects like the parting of the Red Sea (water poured over Jell-O, then reversed through the camera in a double exposure) and use of occasional Technicolor for the Exodus scenes, provided the sensational displays the audiences craved. These Exodus scenes are pretty spectacular considering there was no CGI, all the extras moving en masse in the distance, the camera cutting to scenes in the foreground to show the scramble of families dragging their cattle and belongings with them.\n\ndeMille was the first director to hire an art director for Commandments and used a record six cameramen, one only for the Technicolor scenes. The church construction scenes in part 2 are also remarkable, particularly the one in which Mary uses an elevator to go to John on the rooftop, both their points of view recorded through tracking shots that include the surrounding city.\n\nThe film premiered in New York at the George M. Cohan Theatre on December 21, 1923, where the lobby was decorated Egyptian-style. In Hollywood, it premiered at the Grauman\u2019s Egyptian Theatre on December 4, preceded by a stage show entitled \u2018A Night in Pharaoh\u2019s Palace.\u2019 It got universally good notices from the critics for the Prologue; the Modern Story was not as well-received, Variety calling it \u201cordinary. . . hoke.\u201d\n\nA touring show with a 28-piece orchestra to play the Hugo Riesenfeld score lasted for months. Eleven companies toured Europe. There were 250 screenings in London alone.\n\ndeMille, who had severed ties with Paramount in 1925 over the bitterness of the budget dispute, returned to the studio in 1932. He remade The Ten Commandments as a full-length film in 1956, which is the more famous version, with Charlton Heston as Moses and Yul Brynner as Pharaoh. It was once again Paramount\u2019s most expensive picture to date.\n\nThe Ten Commandments was restored by the George Eastman House with funding provided by the National Endowment for the Arts, The Film Foundation, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, and the George Eastman House Preservation Fund. In 2002, The George Eastman House started work on restoring the film from deMille\u2019s personal 35mm nitrate print. deMille kept one print of every one of his features; most of his silent films were given to the George Eastman House following his death in 1959. This was part of an ongoing initiative to restore the color back to deMille\u2019s silent films, with tinting matched and reproduced by the Desmet process. Reel 8 of deMille\u2019s personal copy was incomplete due to nitrate decomposition. This was replaced with material held at the Library of Congress. Tinting records were used to restore the color tints to this reel from an original screenplay held in the Cecil B. deMille Archives at Brigham Young University in Utah.\n\nHFPA"}, {"url": "https://prod-www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/498647/the-ten-commandments/", "page_content": "Trivia\n\nRemade as Ten Commandments, The (1956), again by Cecil B.

Adding some more wisdom culled from the notes of my dissertation, here\u2019s the account of Cecil B. DeMille\u2019s first foray into biblical film, his 1923 silent version of The Ten Commandments.\n\nCecil B. DeMille\u2019s The Ten Commandments of 1956 is the most well known biblical epic of the 20th century. For those who saw it in the theater in the fifties or have watched it on television as an Easter/Passover tradition since 1973, Charlton Heston will always be Moses, and the scenes shot in the Sinai desert with thousands of Egyptian extras will be the indelible images of the Exodus.\n\nBut few people know that the 1956 film was to some extent a remake, as DeMille had already shot the story of Moses and the Israelites in a spectacularly popular silent version of The Ten Commandments, released in 1923. It was DeMille\u2019s first big biblical feature, and it forever changed the direction of his career and his legacy as a director.\n\nPrior to 1923, DeMille had become known for sex and society films with titles like Old Wives for New (1918), Don\u2019t Change Your Husband (1919), and Why Change Your Wife? (1920). A particular DeMille trademark was scenes involving naked women in bathtubs. So when he held a contest in 1922 for fans to name the theme of his next film, it was a bit of a surprise when he chose the suggestion, \u201cIf you break the Ten Commandments\u2014they will break you\u201d as the guiding quote for his new epic. Many wondered if DeMille was the proper director to create a film about a scriptural story held sacred by both Jews and Christians.\n\nIn order to drive home the point of the continuing importance of the Decalogue, DeMille and his scenarist, Jeanie MacPherson, created a two-part story in which the Israelite Exodus acts as a frame for a modern morality tale about two brothers, their pious mother, and their differing views on the relevance of the Commandments in the Roaring Twenties.\n\nIn a 90-minute feature, this meant DeMille had no time to spare, with about 45 minutes to tell the story of the Exodus and Moses\u2019 receiving the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai. So the 1923 version is missing many classic scenes from the 1956 film, like the basket on the Nile, the burning bush, and Moses\u2019 discovery of his Hebrew origins. (Not to mention the love triangle between Moses, Rameses, and the throne princess Nefretiri.) The story picks up en medias res at the plagues and jumps quickly to the Exodus and the parting of the Red Sea.\n\nTheodore Roberts plays Moses, locking horns with George DeRoche as Pharaoh. At age 60, Roberts plays a considerably older prophet with a long Father Time beard, but still pulls off a dynamic performance. DeRoche is beefy and formidable, but possesses none of the Oriental androgyny and cold arrogance of Yul Brynner. In this version Moses\u2019 sister Miriam (Estelle Taylor) conspires with Dathan (Lawson Butt) to build the golden calf\u2014an unfair narrative invention which negates Miriam\u2019s role as a woman-hero of the Old Testament. In the orgy scene, DeMille lets loose his lady-in-the-bathtub fantasies, filming Miriam writhing on the calf idol as the Israelites descend into graphic decadence.\n\nThe outdoor scenes in \u201cEgypt\u201d were filmed on a massive set built on the Guadalupe-Nipomo dunes south of Santa Barbara. For the weeks of filming on the California coast, DeMille constructed a tent encampment of 3500 actors, technicians, and extras, divided into 14 companies of men and 7 companies of women, and governed by strict rules against alcohol, gambling, fraternizing, and coarse language. Among the extras were 225 Orthodox Jews, hired to \u201clook like their ancestors.\u201d\n\nDeMille\u2019s exterior set for the Pharaoh\u2019s city was 750 feet wide by 109 feet high, and included an avenue of 21 plaster sphinxes. He ordered 250 chariots for the chase scene to the \u201cRed Sea,\u201d along with the horses to pull them, and stables to include 5,000 donkeys, sheep, goats, and camels. The cost of shooting the film quickly spiraled out of control, nearly causing Paramount to pull funding from the film. One desperate missive from producer Adolph Zukor in Los Angeles was sent to \u201cCamp DeMille\u201d by telegraph:\n\n\u201cC.B.\u2014You have lost your mind. Stop filming and return to Los Angeles at once.\u2014A.Z.\u201d\n\nThe Ten Commandments was the first studio film to use Technicolor. In order to get in on DeMille\u2019s epic, Technicolor offered to shoot sections of the Exodus scene alongside the regular black and white cameras for free. If DeMille didn\u2019t like the footage, he didn\u2019t have to use it. The Technicolor footage was edited into the mostly black and white film, along with traditional toned tinting and the Handschliegl process of hand-coloring elements of a scene frame-by-frame.\n\nThe action sequences in the 1923 version are every bit as exciting as the 1956 version. If anything, the desperation of the Egyptians as they chase after the Israelites seems more intense as horses, chariots, and riders go tumbling over the powdery dunes.\n\nThe special effects of the fiery pillar and the parting of the Red Sea are enjoyable for their low-tech innovation. The \u201cpillar\u201d of fire was more of a curtain \u2013 actual flames superimposed on the screen through double exposure. The parting of the Red Sea was accomplished by use of molded gelatin set on top of a metal table, melted by gas jets. Running the film in reverse in fast motion achieved the sense of the waters parting and standing at jiggling attention. Certain low-budget effects and anachronisms, like the Children of Israel holding staffs with Stars of David (King David didn\u2019t come along until centuries later) and toy horses and chariots sinking in a shallow tub of water after being \u201cdrowned\u201d in the Red Sea, only add to the charm of the feature.\n\nMake no mistake, however, this spectacular telling of a biblical narrative was like nothing anyone had ever seen at the time. According to reports of the New York premiere in the Times, the audience applauded at the parting of the Jell-O sea. The Hollywood opening, held, fittingly, in Grauman\u2019s Egyptian Theater, complete with a Vaudeville-style live prologue, \u201cA Night in Pharaoh\u2019s Palace\u201d must have only added to the spectacle.\n\nWith false modesty, DeMille dismissed the film\u2019s unheard-of cost of 1.5 million as the \u201ccheapest picture that was ever made.\u201d As he said in a December 23, 1923 article in the New York Times:\n\n\u201cThis spectacle will show people that we have an obligation to the public and that motion pictures can be more than mere stories [\u2026] The reason for the spectacle in \u2018The Ten Commandments\u2019 is to bring force to the picture [\u2026] The idea of the spectacle as it is presented is worth a million.\u201d\n\nThe modern story of the McTavish family\u2014the good son John, the bad son Dan, and their Bible-wielding mother\u2014is less interesting, with the exception of one breathtaking scene shot from the rising steeples of Saints Peter and Paul Church showing a bustling 1920\u2019s San Francisco beneath. DeMille\u2019s desire to make a more complete story of Moses without the modern interruption was part of why he re-shot the film in 1956.\n\nAfter shooting wrapped on the dunes outside Santa Barbara, the sets were dynamited and bulldozed into the sand. The area is now a protected seashore and wildlife refuge, but beachcombers sometimes find artifacts from \u201cancient Egypt\u201d in the dunes. For years, there have been rumors that vast sections of the great set still sit intact beneath the sand, but film historians and archaeologists have been unable to get either the permission or the funding to excavate.\n\nThe use of such vast resources of material, time, and people set a strong precedent for biblical epics to come, whether directed by DeMille or not. Whatever the religious message of the first Ten Commandments, the message to Hollywood was clear: When it comes to filming the Bible, bigger is better, and no cost is too great.\n\nA restored version of the 1923 Ten Commandments is part of the 3-disc 50th Anniversary Collector\u2019s Edition of The Ten Commandments, released by Paramount Home Video in 2006.

The Commandments are recorded virtually identically in Exodus 20:2\u201317 and Deuteronomy 5:6\u201321. The rendering in Exodus (New Revised Standard Version) appears as follows:\n\nI am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; you shall have no other gods before me.\n\nYou shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing children for the iniquity of parents, to the third and the fourth generation of those who reject me, but showing steadfast love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments.\n\nYou shall not make wrongful use of the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not acquit anyone who misuses his name.\n\nRemember the sabbath day, and keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work. But the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God; you shall not do any work\u2014you, your son or your daughter, your male or female slave, your livestock, or the alien resident in your towns. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but rested the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and consecrated it.\n\nHonor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you.\n\nYou shall not murder.\n\nYou shall not commit adultery.\n\nYou shall not steal.\n\nYou shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.\n\nYou shall not covet your neighbor\u2019s house; you shall not covet your neighbor\u2019s wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor."}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000014532/reviews", "page_content": "8 /10\n\nThe Ten Commandments marks the beginning of the second wave of the Hollywood epic. Modelled on the contemporary/ancient parallel storytelling of Intolerance \u0096 the crowning achievement of the first wave \u0096 and its subject matter decided by a poll of cinema-goers, this is among the most significant and typically DeMillean of DeMille's pictures.\n\n\n\nDeMille had first coupled a historical tale with a modern day framing story in 1916's Joan the Woman, and even during the years when the historical feature was out of fashion (approximately 1918 \u0096 1921) he several times added a little metaphorical foray into the past to his contemporary dramas, such as Male and Female and Manslaughter. Here, it is still the modern day narrative which makes up the bulk of the picture's 130-odd minutes, and yet it is the spectacular biblical prologue that everyone remembers.\n\n\n\nDeMille had always had a talent for directing crowd scenes, giving inspiring pep talks to the mass whilst giving specific directions to the individuals. Here he works with the biggest group of extras he had ever handled, and yet he has lost none of his touch. He gives character to the multitude by focusing on a number of individuals within it, and yet when he pulls back to show the whole crowd you can still see the attention to detail, with a hundred different things going on. The stupendous sets also make an impact in themselves, but DeMille is shrewd enough to reveal them gradually, and places them squarely in the context of being symbolic of evil. The pharaoh's palace may be impressive, but DeMille ensures that the works of God \u0096 the pillar of fire, the parting of the red sea, the lightning on Sinai \u0096 are more so. Oddly, he could be accused of doing the opposite in his 1956 remake, in which the Egyptian city is absolutely awe-inspiring, whereas the special effects representing acts of God are somewhat pathetic even for the day, and certainly less effective than those in 1923. But DeMille had changed a lot by that time.\n\n\n\nIn contrast to the prologue, the contemporary story is somewhat lacklustre. It has much in common with other DeMille dramas from around this period, although it is pretty mediocre by that standard. Particularly jarring is the overuse of intertitles. Five years earlier DeMille had been a master of purely visual narrative, and the titles were only there when absolutely necessary. As time went by however, as DeMille had become more pious and his screenwriter Jeanie Macpherson had become more pretentious, so had the photoplays become more wordy. All the better for preaching with, as far as self-appointed messenger-of-God DeMille was concerned, but his pictures began to lack the grace and smoothness they had once had.\n\n\n\nWith scenes fragmented into smaller pieces, and characters unable to open their mouths without a superfluous title spelling their words out to the audience, the acting also suffers. Richard Dix, Rod La Rocque, Leatrice Joy and Nita Naldi are all adequate performers, but none of them really gets time or space to emote as much as they ought to for the story. Nevertheless, DeMille was still a master of the powerful, iconic image, and there are enough memorable shots here to keep things interesting. Among the standouts are Nita Naldi's hands emerging from a tear in a sack, the straight-up shot in the lift as Leatrice Joy ascends and Naldi ripping the curtain off its hooks, nearly forty years before the almost identical shot in Hitchcock's Psycho. It is images like this which reign supreme in DeMille's cinema, and it is from around this point on that they become more important than the credibility of the story or the actors.\n\n\n\nDeMille's Ten Commandments proved to be highly influential. Other studios got to work on their own superproductions, the western would become epic with The Iron Horse, and even Douglas Fairbanks next picture, The Thief of Bagdad, was steeped in DeMillean grandeur. Further afield, UFA studios in Germany and Abel Gance in France were also working on the principle that big is beautiful. Ten Commandments indicated the future for DeMille himself as well. Not only was it the first of the pictures that would secure his legacy as the ultimate biblical filmmaker, but the fact that the prologue is absolutely breathtaking and the contemporary drama lacks bite, hints towards his eventually becoming a director purely of epics. It's also rather telling that he loved the Old Testament God of plagues and smiting, because that is probably more or less how DeMille saw himself. He hammered home his messages with the spectacular and the incredible. A shock-and-awe filmmaker preaching the word of a shock-and-awe God."}, {"url": "https://www.chicagofilmsociety.org/2012/04/07/a-mental-and-emotional-red-sea-the-ten-commandments-1923/", "page_content": "Tonight we\u2019ll be screening an original IB Technicolor 35mm print of Cecil B. DeMille\u2019s The Ten Commandments at the Portage. This 1956 epic is unequalled in its elemental power\u2014its confusing mix of knotty, alien carnality and religious fervor has rightly frightened generations of children. (It\u2019s also sufficiently iconic and hip enough to earn a nod in Arnaud Desplechin\u2019s recent A Christmas Tale, alongside Nietzsche and Blackalicious.) But this four-hour spectacle wasn\u2019t DeMille\u2019s first attempt at bringing the Exodus to the screen. As a prologue to tonight\u2019s festivities, we\u2019re presenting a lengthy account of DeMille\u2019s 1923 version. (To put that in some perspective, Charlton Heston was born in 1923.) Written in 2008, but previously unpublished, we hope you enjoy this article. And remember: You cannot break the Ten Commandments\u2014they will break you. \u2013 Ed.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n\u201cIntolerance unfortunately was the picture really that broke [Griffith], because he made a dramatic error that should never be made,\u201d remarked Cecil B. DeMille in 1958. \u201cHe told four stories under the guise of one, and consequently all four failed. Because that is a formula that so far as I know has never been successful on the stage. One-act plays can be successful but not \u2026 the same theme running through four separate stories as one play.\u201d DeMille himself never made any film as structurally ambitious as Griffith\u2019s masterwork but his first rendition of The Ten Commandments perhaps comes closest. Intrinsically bifurcated rather than mosaical, DeMille\u2019s 1923 super-production nevertheless stands as one of the very few Intolerance descendants to seriously attempt anything resembling Griffith\u2019s thematic integration of parallel spectacles.\n\nDeMille embarked on his own \u2018dramatic error\u2019 after a string of failed pictures. The latest of them, Adam\u2019s Rib, struck many critics as another unnecessary entry in that most frivolous of genres, the high-society marital farce, which DeMille had practically created in 1918 and had been more or less confined to working in ever since by the Famous Players-Lasky front office. Meanwhile epic pictures from Fairbanks\u2019s Robin Hood to Universal\u2019s The Hunchback of Notre Dame were brought to the screen in hopes of sating a public primed for expensive costume spectacles by German imports such as Lubitsch\u2019s Madame DuBarry. Famous Players-Lasky even had the effrontery to let James Cruze, then a relative neophyte, spend $782,000 on The Covered Wagon while forcing its star director to hew to a formula of diminishing appeal. Unlike Griffith, DeMille\u2019s screen career began with and paralleled the development of the feature, his name practically synonymous with a certain notion of middle-class entertainment. Producers everywhere now laid claim to an audience that DeMille had nurtured. DeMille insisted on entering the million-dollar picture race himself, which would mean working on a scale he had not been permitted since Joan the Woman of 1916.\n\nTo make especially sure that his next picture would strike a chord with audiences DeMille made the unusual maneuver of soliciting scenarios directly from the public through a contest in the Los Angeles Times. Among thousands of submissions, DeMille was particularly taken with that of one F. C. Nelson, Lansing, Michigan, lubricant manufacturer: \u201cYou cannot break the Ten Commandments\u2014they will break you.\u201d For that line Nelson won a thousand dollars.\n\nSeven other entrants also suggested a Commandments picture and each received comparable compensation, but it was Nelson\u2019s phrasing that had the strongest influence on DeMille\u2019s conception of The Ten Commandments. Late in the film an intertitle reprints Nelson\u2019s injunction, but his sense of vernacular bluntness hangs over the whole enterprise.\n\nAt first DeMille instructed his regular scenarist Jeanie Macpherson to translate Nelson\u2019s dictum into a string of parables, each one illustrating the consequences of breaking one or perhaps two Commandments. When that structure proved unsatisfactory Macpherson concocted a convoluted scenario in which one emblematic modern man violates all ten. That was better but something was still missing.\n\n\u201c\u2018Seeing is believing,\u2019\u201d recounted Macpherson, \u201cand we believed the spectator would be much more impressed with a story based on the Commandments if he first had seen the history of them, how they were given and what effect they had upon the people who had come in contact with them during that far-away time of the birth of the Decalogue, than as if this spectator had merely a vague memory from far off Sunday-school days that somewhere at some time the Ten Commandments had been given to somebody.\u201d\n\nNo viewer of DeMille\u2019s version would fail to recollect the story of the Lawgiver. Whether Adolph Zukor or Jesse Lasky knew it or not, no expense would be spared in the commission of this holy spectacle. \u201cI cannot and will not make pictures with a yardstick,\u201d DeMille told Zukor, though neither was shy about releasing the following statistics for purposes of ballyhoo: the Exodus was recreated in Santa Barbara\u2019s Guadalupe sand dunes with the labor of 500 carpenters, 400 painters, and 380 decorators. The construction of the entrance to Rameses\u2019s city required 300 tons of plaster, 55,000 board feet of lumber, and 25,000 pounds of nails. Costumes used 16 miles of cloth. The scenes themselves would require some 3,000 animals and 2,500 extras, including a smattering of Orthodox Jews to lend authenticity. The cast and crew lived out of a tent city that measured 24 square miles, with two mess halls, 125 chefs, and 10 tons of hay consumed by the livestock on a daily basis. Communication was facilitated by an extensive army field telephone system, the largest of its kind used since the Great War.\n\n(Considering the scale of the production, the trick photography marshaled to achieve the parting of the Red Sea was rather modest: technical director Roy Pomeroy devised a traveling matte system that allowed the Jews to march across the seafloor between two wavering mountains of gelatin.)\n\nThe Ten Commandments had no less than six cinematographers\u2014four credited technicians along with additional inserts by famed photographer Edward S. Curtis and color footage by Ray Rennahan. His employer, the Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation\u2014which had already released its own feature, The Toll of the Sea, through Metro\u2014hoped to induce more Hollywood producers to utilize their two-color system. They offered Rennahan\u2019s services on ridiculously generous terms: if DeMille liked the footage, he could use it in the picture gratis and if he did not it would be destroyed. Though DeMille preferred the more artisanal (and expensive) look achieved by the Handschiegl stencil process, he could not refuse Technicolor\u2019s deal and agreed to let Rennahan shoot the Exodus and the parting of the Red Sea. (Release prints included the Handschiegl footage, the Technicolor footage, or some assortment of both, though the Technicolor version was predominant.)\n\nBy this time DeMille\u2019s profligacy had well exceeded that of Cruze, whose western saga had already settled into a very profitable eight-month run in Hollywood. DeMille agreed to waive his guarantee but insisted on his keeping his weekly salary. Neither this gesture, nor DeMille\u2019s promise that The Ten Commandments would be \u201cthe biggest picture ever made, not only from the standpoint of spectacle but from the standpoint of humanness, dramatic power, and the great good it will do,\u201d much assuaged Zukor, who seriously contemplated selling the negative back to DeMille and forfeiting Paramount\u2019s stake in any profits for a million dollars. Lasky prevailed upon him, however, and DeMille went forward with location shooting in San Francisco for the modern story. The final cost was $1,475,836.93. To remain solvent in light of that sum, Famous Players-Lasky shut down all other productions from October 1923 to year\u2019s end.\n\nEarly reaction in the industry was overwhelmingly positive. Lasky himself lauded \u201cthe sincerity with which Cecil has handled this tremendous subject \u2026 almost as if he were inspired, a new and much bigger Cecil DeMille.\u201d This theme was repeated by Motion Picture Magazine: \u201cJust when humorists were finding in the DeMille tales of distorted society life ample material for their somewhat mordant jesting, he comes forth and blazes his name on the roster of the great.\u201d Moving Picture World echoed that sentiment, too, proclaiming that \u201c[e]very member of the large cast gives an excellent performance and all seem to be imbued with the bigness of the theme.\u201d At Photoplay James Quirk went further still: \u201cThe best photoplay ever made. The greatest theatrical spectacle in history. The greatest sermon on the tablets which form the basis of all law ever preached. Strong words, indeed, but written two weeks after seeing it, after serious consideration of Griffith\u2019s Intolerance and The Birth of a Nation. It will last as long as the film on which it is recorded.\u201d\n\nAny sympathetic account of the picture has to engage with the context from which it emerged. The 1922 rediscovery of Tutankhamen\u2019s tomb had touched off immense popular interest in all things Egyptian, so much so that the Los Angeles Times printed an Egyptologist\u2019s critique of DeMille\u2019s film that alleged that, as the historical record was concerned, Rameses was the \u2018Wrong Pharaoh\u2019 for the Exodus saga. More significant, however, was the emergence of a new brand of evangelical Christianity in America, exemplified in the figure of Aimee Semple McPherson, who embodied many contradictions not dissimilar to DeMille\u2019s own. McPherson brought that most \u2018old time\u2019 of all religious denominations\u2014Pentecostalism, including speaking in tongues and faith healing\u2014into the Hollywood mainstream, dressing like a starlet and delivering sermons in the form of elaborate production numbers that rivaled the proscenium prologues of the big picture houses. The passion play was quickly being replaced by a less anti-Semitic, inherently more ecumenical form of mass religious address with the aesthetics of Hollywood and the Holy Land converging into one unbeatable box office formula. (DeMille\u2019s own King of Kings would go even further in this respect.)\n\nFor his part DeMille apparently subscribed to a kind of Millenarianism that elegantly dovetailed with the promotion of his latest picture: \u201cThe world is eagerly awaiting a universal religion. The time is ripe for a greater and truer religious understanding\u2026The world is weary of creeds, dogmas, forms, rituals, and isms, but it finds that without religion it is like a ship without a rudder\u2026. Religion does not need to be clothed in the garment of Confucianism, Buddhism, Christianity, Mohammedanism or any other set form of worship. The principles of all are the same. Look up the covenants of each, and you will find the essentials of the Ten Commandments of the Mosaic law.\u201d\n\nSome journalists, particularly those at the newspaper that had sponsored DeMille\u2019s scenario gambit, found that C. B.\u2019s new film agreeably cut through much doctrinal dross. One Los Angeles Times columnist opined: \u201cI wonder if there is any religious creed or cult that is based strictly and exclusively upon the Ten Commandments \u2026 As those Ten Commandments are flashed in mighty forcefulness direct from Heaven in the film story, one is conscious of amazed surprise at their straight-forward simplicity\u2026. There isn\u2019t a word about prohibition, gambling, dancing, smoking, women\u2019s clothes, divorce, prize fights, card-playing, evolution, nudity, or any of those bitterly controversial subjects that occupy so much attention from some pulpits.\u201d\n\nPrecisely by ignoring these contemporary concerns and focusing instead on Technicolor, tumbling jute cathedrals, and Franco-Chinese leprosy-carrying vamps did The Ten Commandments become the quintessential frivolous-sincere expression of spirituality in Coolidge-era America. It might have earned its costs back on that basis alone, but DeMille and Paramount could not have taken such a risk.\n\nZukor was still bitter about the cost overruns, a fact reflected in the virtual absence of The Ten Commandments from the firm\u2019s trade paper ads, leaving outfits like Simplex and Technicolor to tout their affiliation with the project in their own full-page spreads. That spite did not spill over to the film\u2019s public profile. Zukor signed off on a quarter-million dollars\u2019 worth of accoutrements for the film\u2019s 21 Dec 1923 New York premiere at the George M. Cohan Theatre, which included much Egyptian lobby d\u00e9cor and two screen-sized tablets that flew open like stone curtains at the start of the picture. At the end of its 36-week run at the Cohan, The Ten Commandments moved to the Criterion, which had recently hosted 59 weeks of The Covered Wagon.\n\nThe Hollywood premiere of \u201cDeMille\u2019s ultra-drama of the ages,\u201d conveniently held at Grauman\u2019s Egyptian on 4 Dec 1923, boasted some 300 Lasky celebrities and a stage show, \u201cA Night in Pharaoh\u2019s Palace.\u201d As the picture\u2019s seven-month run wore on \u201cPharaoh\u2019s Palace\u201d purportedly drew as many spectators as the feature itself. This prologue to a prologue, copyrighted by Sid Grauman, was seized upon by Paramount as an example for other big houses to emulate, filming its last performance for that very purpose. Attendees of the 350th screening of The Ten Commandments at Grauman\u2019s received miniature bronze replicas of Moses\u2019 tablets.\n\nThe road show continued with a touring twenty-piece orchestra that played Hugo Riesenfeld\u2019s score at every performance. Eighteen weeks at Chicago\u2019s Woods. Fourteen at Philadelphia\u2019s Aldine. The initial three-week engagement in Washington, D.C. was expanded to five; the National was still doing capacity business when it had to pull the picture to make way for a long-standing booking of Music Box Revue. \u201cIt is realized,\u201d noted the Washington Post, \u201cthat the De Mille epic is not a movie super-special of the kind that plays a flock of neighborhood houses directly [after] the \u201ckey\u201d run at a downtown theater is concluded. In fact, no version of The Ten Commandments will be put into movie houses for many months to come.\u201d The Ten Commandments did not return to the capital until 1926!\n\nInternational screenings proved similarly strong and equally ham-fisted. The Prince of Wales and the royal family purportedly attended the picture more than once during its 250-performance London engagement. Australian exhibitors hoping to present The Ten Commandments faced stiff contracts that stipulated an American-style publicity campaign. Eleven road shows toured the continent; each came with a Paramount agent who would spend two weeks in a given territory prior to the premiere, rustling up media coverage and recruiting locals to perform in the \u201cGrand Atmospheric Egyptian Prologue.\u201d\n\nSkeptics emerged. A Presbyterian church board member of St. Paul, Minnesota, related that \u201cWhen I saw the first [half] of this photoplay I said to myself I would like to show it to my Sunday school class. But when I saw the second half I said it wouldn\u2019t do.\u201d One rogue Los Angeles Times correspondent who attended a New York screening noted \u201c[t]he audience was wildly enthusiastic over the colored photography so who am I to say that it looked to me like a geographical case of measles. Throughout the biblical sequence the enthusiasm ran high but the modern story did not go over so well.\u201d \u2018Mae Tin\u00e9e,\u2019 the composite critic at the Chicago Tribune, reprimanded DeMille for a complicated two-part structure and then delivered the ultimate blow: \u201cAs in Intolerance one suspects the average picture-seer will leave the theater after having seen this production asking aloud or otherwise: \u2018What\u2019s it all about, anyways?\u2019\u201d\n\nDeMille disagreed. Defending Macpherson\u2019s scenario as \u2018Euripidean,\u2019 he speculated that those who applauded the prologue but maligned the modern story \u201cprobably somewhere on their mental horizon have been affected far more than they knew, not by the actual Red Sea catastrophe, but by its modern prototype, the scenes where a single man is just as surely destroyed by a mental and emotional Red Sea.\u201d\n\nEngulfed, uncomprehending, or otherwise stupefied, picturegoers continued to flock to The Ten Commandments, which topped exhibitors\u2019 polls as the most popular attraction of 1924 and 1925. More dangerous than tepid critical reaction was the very real antipathy towards DeMille on the part of Zukor and other Paramount executives. Though this holy folly eventually grossed an impressive $4,169,798.38, DeMille found himself confined to cheaper programmer pictures throughout 1924. Unhappy with material like The Golden Bed, DeMille formed his own independent company when his Paramount contract expired in 1925\u2014by which time M-G-M\u2019s six-million dollar bill for Ben-Hur made DeMille\u2019s extravagance look like a pittance. With some not insignificant exceptions, the remainder of his career would be devoted to films rather more in the mold of the Ten Commandments prologue than that of the modern story.\n\nBy 1932, however, DeMille was back at Paramount, which had recently used his 1923 footage to bring a ten-day anti-Bolshevik quickie called Forgotten Commandments up to feature length. Not content to see his great achievement made obsolete by the talkies, DeMille eventually remade the picture in 1956 as a four-hour, entirely Biblical Vistavision blockbuster. For the second time in the studio\u2019s history The Ten Commandments emerged as Paramount\u2019s most expensive venture to date."}, {"url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTenCommandments1923", "page_content": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTenCommandments1923\n\nYou cannot break the Ten Commandments \u2014 they will break you.\n\nThe Ten Commandments is a 1923 silent film, best known for inspiring the more famous 1956 remake. Both versions were directed by Cecil B. DeMille, and the 1923 version entered the Public Domain on January 1, 2019.\n\nWhile the 1956 film is devoted entirely to the Book of Exodus, the 1923 version confines the Exodus scenes to the first fifty minutes, in a section referred to as \"the prologue.\" As a result, only a small part of the Exodus story is actually covered, beginning with Moses' return to Egypt and ending with the destruction of the Golden Calf. Additionally, the first nine plagues are essentially skipped over, with only a couple brief mentions indicating that they took place off-screen.\n\nAfter the prologue, the film moves on to the intended main story, which takes place in the contemporary 1920s and seeks to illustrate how the Ten Commandments are still relevant in modern times. This story follows and contrasts the lives of two brothers, one who follows the Ten Commandments and another who does not. John, the believer, stays loyal to their pious mother, and is content to work as a simple carpenter. Dan, the cynical atheist, wins the heart of Mary, a more well-meaning atheist whom both brothers love, and he finds material success as an amoral businessman. But ultimately, of course, Dan's rejection of Biblical law brings him to ruin.\n\nThe Biblical prologue is widely regarded as the superior part of the movie, and is much better remembered as well. It's no surprise then that DeMille chose to jettison the modern story when he remade the film in 1956.\n\nTropes in the Prologue:\n\nTropes in the Story:"}, {"url": "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:The_Ten_Commandments_(1923_film)", "page_content": "The Ten Commandments is a 1923 American silent religious epic film directed by Cecil B.

The film traces his adventures, friendships, and a love affair with a charming French girl (Ren\u00e9e Ador\u00e9e).\n\nBritannica Quiz Pop Culture Quiz\n\nRoutinely touted as one of the first and greatest antiwar films, Vidor\u2019s film is a genuine epic and was one of the most sweeping productions of the silent era. Though the film was shot in Texas, Vidor captured well the gruesome nature of the trench warfare in France. (Some of the battle scenes were shot by George Hill after Vidor left the project.) Vidor not only humanized the German adversaries but also gave Gilbert the role that cemented him as one of the first genuine superstars. What makes The Big Parade of historical, as well as cinematic, importance is the fact that it was shot within a few years of the end of World War I, thus providing a fascinating look at how the war affected the American people. The film was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\u2019s highest-grossing movie to date, with revenues topping $5 million. At the Astor Theater in New York City, it played for an astounding 96 weeks."}, {"url": "https://www.sensesofcinema.com/2013/cteq/the-big-parade/", "page_content": "Viewing The Big Parade 88 years after its initial release, and 25 years following its inclusion in my upper-level course on the war film, elicited complex feelings. On the one hand, although the film still stands as a great achievement of classical Hollywood silent cinema, it, like many others, has become dated by the inclusion of elements that were once fresh but have since appeared in so many other war films. Take, for example, its use of the bildungsroman of the young man going to war and returning home more experienced, a form that so many successive films, such as The Red Badge of Courage (John Huston, 1951) and Platoon (Oliver Stone, 1986), have followed. The sudden change from comedy to carnage also links The Big Parade to the narrative reversal of works such as The Dirty Dozen (Robert Aldrich, 1968). However, other features still genuinely affected me such as the clockwork mechanical movements of the doughboys marching towards a retreating camera in the Belleau Wood sequence (1), revealing the new face of 20th century warfare as akin to an industrial machine; the anguished cries of Jim (John Gilbert) as one of his friends perishes on a deadly mission in the trenches and his touching reunion with his sweetheart at the end \u2013 all filmed in a manner free from the overtly manipulative techniques of such directors as Hitchcock and Spielberg. The Big Parade is actually complex and contradictory. Filmed seven years after the war when memories of the conflict were still fresh in the minds of its contemporary audiences, The Big Parade is definitely not a pro-war film but neither is it as anti-war as its director once thought (2).\n\nAs Michael Isenberg has pointed out, the film neither applauded the war effort nor indicted American war policy. Instead, it moulds the director\u2019s humanistic concerns to the salesmanship techniques of Irving Thalberg \u2013 responsible for developing the hero\u2019s family background as well as the romantic themes (3). Isenberg defined the complex structure of The Big Parade in the following fashion:\n\nThe themes of nationalism, honor, duty, and egalitarian heroism are all common to the war-adventure genre. Plots threaded with them cannot make a coherent antiwar or pacifist statement, since the focus of such themes is individualistic rather than situational\u2026. The individualism of the film is sketched in the positive attributes of friendship and democratic solidarity. Transferred to the emotional level of the viewer, these become the admirable qualities of loyalty, devotion, and dedication to service. Here patriotic impulse overcomes the horrors of war, not vice versa. (4)\n\nI disagree with the last sentence and argue instead that the film contains several ambivalent sequences that neither affirms a pro-war nor anti-war stance but question whether the role of agency, always ideologically promoted in a Hollywood film, can actually exist within a complex 20th century society. A choice may be made which a character thinks is due to individual choice but such choices are often socially determined. Stella Dallas may bask in the joys of a mother after seeing her daughter married but she is still an outcast removed from the society that has accepted her daughter and rejected her. Such issues concerned Vidor from the beginning to the end of his career as films like The Crowd (1928), Hallelujah (1929), Billy the Kid (1930), The Champ (1931), Our Daily Bread (1934), Stella Dallas (1937), Northwest Passage (Book I \u2013 Rogers\u2019 Rangers) (1940), H. M. Pulham, Esq. (1941), Duel in the Sun (1946), Beyond the Forest (1949), Ruby Gentry (1952), and War and Peace (1956) show in various ways. The Big Parade is the first of his major films to confront such issues and its happy ending is as ambivalent as those concluding The Crowd, Stella Dallas, and especially War and Peace \u2013 an appropriate Vidor filmic adaptation whose seemingly positive conclusion cannot banish from the spectator\u2019s mind those dominating historical forces that affect its Russian characters as much as its American ones, though in a different era. Certain sequences in The Big Parade reveal the early presence of telling contradictions that Vidor would later develop in his cinematic depictions of 20th century American society, contradictions not just confined to his version of the World War I combat film.\n\nThe film begins by introducing its three main characters separated from each other by cinematic space and class barriers in an America \u201coccupied in peaceful progression\u201d, an ideologically loaded phrase as any reader of American history and Kevin Brownlow\u2019s cinematic study of this era well knows (5). Slim (Karl Dane) may be a yeoman of industry who puts aside his rivet gun to pick up another weapon when the war siren summons \u2013 as Bull will stop wiping his glass in a Bowery bar \u2013 but like the character of Jim, he heeds his country\u2019s call to arms like a clock wound up to beat a new time sequence by the invisible hand of ideology. Even slacker Jim, who resembles George Minafer in The Magnificent Ambersons (Orson Welles, 1942), responds to the call of duty stimulated first by his upper-class sweetheart, who will never see him in the officer\u2019s uniform she desires, as well as his chums in the first of the film\u2019s various big parades. As the band plays on, Jim taps his left foot responding to the rhythm on a leg he will later lose, before rushing to join his peer group \u201cover there\u201d. Notably, no attention is given either to the actuality of the war or its causes: only mindless conformist pressure. Jim acts one-dimensionally because he is an American (though not necessarily motivated patriotically). A touching family sequence before Jim will do his \u201cbit\u201d (as expressed by his father played by Hobart Bosworth) concludes with a mid-shot of the father beaming with pride on the left-hand-side of the screen as Jim and his mother embrace on the centre and right. When the non-prodigal son returns minus his left leg, the father will be on the right-hand-side of the screen with a mournful expression on his face. Jim, again, has not really matched his expectations. The Big Parade is full of such meaningful resonances, and it is important to recognise them when they appear. Vidor may have later disliked such scenes but Brownlow is correct in stating that the director underestimates them and is actually \u201creaching his emotional high point here\u201d (6). Jim\u2019s sweetheart Justyn (Claire Adams) eventually reveals that gentlewomen prefer deferred slacker brothers and not returning veterans who are neither officers nor gentlemen (\u201cYou\u2019ll look gorgeous in an officer\u2019s uniform. I\u2019ll love you all the more then.\u201d) Jim\u2019s mother may want to spare her household later outbursts like that of Tom Cruise\u2019s Ron Kovic in Born on the Fourth of July (Oliver Stone, 1989), diplomatically performing her own form of anger management by sending him back to France despite what she says: \u201cThen you must find her. Nothing else matters.\u201d Was Vidor satirically sentimentalising the \u201cDear John\u201d syndrome for an unaware MGM?\n\nIf no atheists supposedly exist in foxholes neither do class barriers in many war movies. Slim and Bull welcome Jim as one of their own as they march and perform chores to the \u201ctitled\u201d musical accompaniment of the perennial \u201cYou\u2019re in the Army now\u201d, a song that will also feature on the soundtrack of The Dirty Dozen before things get really serious over forty years later. Humour abounds as Slim and Bull perform their own version of a Quirt and Flagg routine from What Price Glory (Raoul Walsh, 1926), and Jim finds a more pure version of Charmaine in Melisande. But all good things will come to an end \u2013 especially in a war film \u2013 as Jim leaves Melisande alone in that famous desolate long shot after tossing her his dog tags, watch and extra boot, an object that Isenberg correctly sees as \u201ca symbol of [Jim] Apperson\u2019s forthcoming injury\u201d (7). Never underestimate the power of Hollywood symbolism nor the fact that the boot will soon never again be on Jim\u2019s \u201cleft foot\u201d. Captions state in bold type \u2013 \u201cIT HAD BEGUN. THE BIG PARADE. TO THE FRONT TO THE FRONT. TO THE FRONT\u201d \u2013 as soldiers march to a different drummer in contrast to the first big parade of the film. The next big parade will be slow and deadly as the doughboys march slowly to encounter machine gun fire in Belleau Wood where writer Lawrence Stallings lost his own leg.\n\nWhen Slim is ambushed on his night mission, Jim begins shouting and waving his arms in non-military despair: \u201cI want to fight, not to wait and rot in a lousy hole while they murder my pal\u201d. This parallels the What Price Glory? (1924) moment in Stallings\u2019 original theatrical version: \u201cOrders! Who the hell is fighting this war? Men or orders?\u201d War is no longer a laughing matter for Vidor\u2019s \u201csoldiers three\u201d, nor can Jim engage in any more \u201cskirt\u201d duty. While Bull attempts to calm him down, Jim waves his bayonet in the direction of the officers, an obvious recognition by Vidor of his hero\u2019s desire to frag those in the rear with the gear. He soon loses Bull in a battle scene giving the lie to his earlier comment, \u201cThis ain\u2019t such a bad war\u201d. Wounded in his leg and discovering that a more seriously wounded German soldier is as much a victim as himself, Jim cheers doughboys on in the penultimate big parade of the film, one he cannot join in. The last big parade is the procession of ambulances removing the survivors to hospitals. When Jim awakes he sees a traumatised soldier strapped to his bed suffering badly from what was then called \u201cshell shock\u201d, a condition that John Huston attempted to depict in his later war documentary Let There be Light (1946) before it was banned from public display by the authorities. Obviously, that soldier represents Jim\u2019s real condition, one that the film suppresses by contrasting it with the figure of the lucid soldier near Jim\u2019s own bed. Vidor may need to repress the implications of Jim\u2019s real condition but allows the repressed to return in this doubled figure (8). MGM thus supplies a \u201chappy ending\u201d for Jim and the spectator. He supposedly finds peace in Vidor\u2019s version of \u201cthe stuff that dreams are made of\u201d, the dialogue featured on a titlecard that foreshadows the final ironic line of The Maltese Falcon (John Huston, 1941). But like the black bird of that later film it is not the real thing and no substitute for the grim actuality of postwar trauma.\n\nHowever, Timothy Barnard notes that Jim\u2019s return is also rhythmically different from that earlier metronomic bloody ballet of death in Belleau Wood since it may act as a counterpoint to that deterministic patriotic motion that eventually led to destruction. A veteran\u2019s disabled body becomes \u201ctied to new postwar hopes represented as individualistic, transcendentally different and ultimately redeemed\u201d (9). I would add that Jim also returns to an agrarian France bearing no resemblance to the urban America of the opening scenes of skyscrapers and \u201cmills humming away\u201d. As Doc Boone says in Stagecoach (John Ford, 1939), he is \u201csaved from the blessings of civilization\u201d \u2013 at least temporarily.\n\nThe Big Parade is a film of ambivalence and contradiction. Touching in its narrative of an individual caught in circumstances beyond his control and trapped by conventional ideology that cannot allow an alternative picture of World War I, it is nevertheless an accomplished film. Veterans and later audiences may be fully aware of the conventions used and deeper implications existing within a narrative whose postwar American sequences contains the seeds of The Best Years of Our Lives (William Wyler, 1946) (10). Isenberg may be formally correct in his assertion that \u201cNone of its ingredients were new; they were only packaged differently\u201d, but parts of the film gained significant responses from the veterans who saw it at the time, as Brownlow reports (11). They did not see the film as mindless entertainment. Neither should we.\n\nEndnotes See King Vidor, A Tree is a Tree, Harcourt, New York, 1953, pp. 156-157.

With Turner Classic Movies set to run a nine movie Gilbert birthday marathon on Wednesday, I started my copy of Dark Star , the 1985 biography by his daughter, Leatrice Gilbert Fountain, on Tuesday. I\u2019m dying to click Buy on Eve Golden\u2019s new Gilbert biography , but I just can\u2019t bring myself to do so until I\u2019ve read the earlier book that has been sitting on my bookshelf far too long.\n\nI had planned to write about my favorite Gilbert talkie, Gentleman\u2019s Fate (1931), for Wednesday, but at the last moment chose to put that off for a later date. Instead I decided to write about my first impressions of King Vidor\u2019s The Big Parade, originally released by MGM in 1925. I watched this major silent film classic for the first time late Monday night.\n\nAnd, after all, if I was going to write about it that meant I would have to watch it for a second time Tuesday so I could grab some images for this post. After spending daytime Tuesday recalling several moments I had enjoyed so much watching the night before, there was nothing I would rather do than create another opportunity to watch The Big Parade!\n\nI enjoy the history around the First World War more than I do World War II. It\u2019s no slight against the Greatest Generation, which my grandparents were a part of. I grew up around that generation in their senior years, and sadly all those I knew from it are now gone. But I shared a common world with that group long enough to hear the stories and not consider their past all that distant. Our worlds intersected; we even watched movies together. This was not the case for me with the previous generation. I had no direct relationship with any of them. Their time is only known to me through books and movies, a world just outside my reach of total understanding.\n\nBut people don\u2019t change all that much and as long as you can get over any silent film bugaboos you\u2019ll find much of what made The Big Parade work so well at the time of its original release does the same today. Love and war spring universal emotions and King Vidor captures them all in his sprawling tale of a time that was not so far removed when the film was originally released in November 1925.\n\nWe miss out on that. What must it have been like to see The Big Parade as a veteran of the War or as one who\u2019d seen their father, husband, or brother serve, perhaps even been maimed or die, during that recent world calamity?\n\nI\u2019m sure many women attending wished they had been Renee Adoree, but how would a young woman in the crowd had felt if her personal history had more resembled that of the Claire Adams character? And what of the men who had fought and made it back? Did a faint smile cross their lips while watching the antics of John Gilbert, Karl Dane and Tom O\u2019Brien? Did once forgotten dalliances cause them to flush at their wife\u2019s side as Gilbert romanced Adoree? And the battle, what might that possibly have done to them? Adrenaline surely spiked, but what emotions poured forth?\n\nThankfully, I had none of those concerns while watching The Big Parade unfold my first time. John Gilbert plays Jim Apperson, the spoiled, number two son of strict father (Hobart Bosworth) and doting mother (Claire McDowall). When War comes\u2014and this reaction always seems so foreign\u2014there is celebration. Young Apperson isn\u2019t celebrating though. He looks a little worried. At least until he is swept away by a patriotic parade that leads to his enlisting.\n\nJohn Gilbert is quickly off to Europe. But it\u2019s going to be awhile before King Vidor brings us any battle.\n\nThe next hour of the film is spent allowing the viewer to embrace the Gilbert character, whose beginnings were a bit shaky for us. First he becomes friendly with Dane and O\u2019Brien and then, more importantly, he falls in love with Renee Adoree\u2019s French girl, Melisande.\n\nThe language barrier makes this an especially cute courtship and this was probably intensified back in the mid-20s when silent film was the norm. Being so used to hearing voices, the silent Melisande did not seem nearly as foreign to me as she certainly did to Apperson. We can\u2019t hear either of them and so Gilbert comes off as chatty as any silent lead while Adoree seems more mute than foreign. Still, their differences are accentuated and the romance works, soon magnificently. It grows throughout this hour and is punctuated by the famous chewing gum scene before building to Adoree\u2019s mad dash through the streets seeking out Gilbert amongst the other soldiers after he and the other men have finally been called off to battle.\n\nWhile this is the first time I watched The Big Parade from start to finish, I had seen clips of this particular scene several times in various documentaries and so, again, from my retrospective view, while the men are being rounded up and begin marching off a little excitement built in me. Here it comes, I thought, the classic scene, the one I knew so well. But I had only known it off in space, on its own.\n\nIt would have been easy to be let down. It\u2019s happened before during similar experiences. Oh, is that it? or Wait, THAT was the climax? were thoughts that never occurred to me during my acquaintance with this scene in its correct context. Sure, it was the climax: of the first half of the movie. Tension only grows from this point as The Big Parade becomes a total war epic for the next 45 minutes. Was that it? Well, if it was, it was everything: Gilbert loves Adoree and now we\u2019re fully invested in Gilbert. He\u2019s got to survive this damned war; he\u2019s got to get this girl back!\n\nThe battle scenes that follow are eerie, ferocious, heart-breaking and rousing, sometimes all at once. While Gilbert spouts occasional corn across the title cards once the men have advanced deep into battle, it was surely served fresh back during the original run of the film. Previously my favorite infantry battle scenes were from All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) and as soon as Kirk Douglas blows his whistle in Paths of Glory (1957). Vidor\u2019s elaborately choreographed and shockingly brutal battle from The Big Parade now stands alongside them, if not out front.\n\nEven before the mustard gas or the tense wait in the shell holes I was hooked. As the men make their initial march forward, spread just a few feet apart, the silence of The Big Parade is magnified. Why? Because we\u2019re in their boots now, the movie has totally captured us. Out of the corner of your eye you\u2019ll spot a soldier dropping to the ground dead and the death just doesn\u2019t stop. The slow determined march moves forward, the falling bodies becoming more prominent and our only hope becomes that Gilbert, Dane and O\u2019Brien continue to stand and march.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest. There were times during the first half of the movie, when Gilbert and Adoree were falling for each other, that I thought to myself, isn\u2019t this supposed to be a war movie? I was enjoying what I watched, but it wasn\u2019t what I had originally expected. I knew the importance of Adoree\u2019s involvement, but still, I came to the movie expecting war to be hell from start to finish. Our war finally comes, but it really begins just before that first battle when Adoree desperately seeks out the young American she has fallen in love with.\n\nAnd that made my second viewing on Tuesday night all the more pleasant. The Big Parade gets better the second time. The power of what is to come still builds anticipation, but the story that leads us to the battlefield is improved both by knowing what does follow yet understanding just how much we will come to value these characters in reaching the hell that Vidor is about to put them through.\n\nI watched The Big Parade nearly ninety years after it was first released. I suppose the best answer as to how it was received in the 1920s would be the bottom line. It became, arguably, the highest grossing film to that time and is still, along with The Birth of a Nation (1915), one of the two all-time highest grossing films of the silent era.\n\nThe Big Parade was originally released at 140 minutes in 1925 when it premiered at Grauman\u2019s Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. A few weeks later it premiered in New York at the Astor Theatre where it ran for a stunning two years! It only had limited release at that time and most of the country had to wait nearly two years for it to reach them during a September 1927 re-release.\n\nThe copy I viewed was recorded off of TCM from the 1988 restoration produced by David Gill and Kevin Brownlow. The Big Parade was previously released on VHS in 1992 and after yet another restoration in 2005 finally comes to Blu-ray and DVD from Turner Home Entertainment on October 1, 2013.\n\nThird time should be even more the charm for me come this October.\n\nLike this: Like Loading..."}, {"url": "http://www.threemoviebuffs.com/review/bigparade.html", "page_content": "Renee Adoree and John Gilbert meet.\n\nThe Big Parade, released just seven years after the armistice that ended the First World War, captured the imagination of the country with its potent combination of realism and romanticized nostalgia. It would become the highest grossing movie of the 1920\u2019s and the second highest grossing silent movie after Griffith\u2019s landmark Birth of a Nation. They would remain at the pinnacle until a little movie called Gone with the Wind would obliterate all previous box office records in 1939. Although both Wings and All Quiet on the Western Front are better remembered today, The Big Parade was far more popular during its time. At one Manhattan movie theater it ran for an astounding 96 consecutive weeks.\n\nThe movie stars John Gilbert as the spoiled son of a wealthy American family who gets caught up in the winds of war. He leaves behind the pretty girl next door and soon finds himself in the army marching across the French countryside. Many of the day to day trials and hardships of military life are shown. One day Gilbert rigs up an outdoor shower and as two of his platoon mates are showering he spots a lone French girl (played brilliantly by Ren\u00e9e Ador\u00e9e) watching them in amusement. Thus begins a fateful wartime romance.\n\nThe final half hour or so has some well staged and exciting battle scenes of trench warfare. The most memorable scene, however, and one that you may be familiar with even if you have never heard of this movie, takes place when Gilbert\u2019s platoon is called up to the front lines and he must say goodbye - for now at least - to his French lover. King Vidor masterfully directed this segment and it is one of the greatest 10 minutes in all of silent film.\n\nFirst we see the lovers searching desperately for each other as the streets of the quaint French village fill with crowds of soldiers gathering and civilians rushing about saying goodbye. Finally the lovers spot each other, run to each other and exchange many passionate kisses. Tearfully they must say goodbye. Gilbert gets on a truck. She runs alongside, desperately, pleading with him not to go. She grabs his leg, then boot, then a chain hanging from the truck, until finally she lets go and collapses in the dust as dozens of soldiers pass her by without a glance. Vidor then shows a long shot of the big parade of soldiers disappearing into the distance. Then the final shot of the young peasant girl, still on her knees in the middle of the dirt road, only now she is all alone.\n\nJohn Gilbert was a bigger star even than Rudolph Valentino in 1925. He was the undisputed king of the box office and would soon team with Greta Garbo and achieve even greater heights of success. We will never know if Valentino would have made the transition to the talkies because of his untimely death in 1926. Gilbert, however, had one of the most spectacular falls from the heavens of any great movie star. His high-pitched, somewhat nasally speaking voice did not fit his image. He would make only one memorable talking picture, Queen Christina in 1933 at the insistence of his old costar and one time lover, Greta Garbo. He died of a heart attack in 1936 at the age of 38.\n\nThe Big Parade represents a big part of his celluloid legacy."}, {"url": "https://greatbooksguy.com/2018/11/18/the-big-parade/", "page_content": "The Big Parade (1925) Director: King Vidor\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nUnlike its offspring All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), The Big Parade is not an explicitly anti-war film. It tells the story of three young men in America in 1917 on the eve of the American entrance into World War I. They are: Slim, a blue-collar steelworker; Bull O\u2019Hara, a bartender; and Jim Apperson (played by John Gilbert), the son of a wealthy merchant. The latter is the main character of the film. The setting of Section I is as follows: Jim is a spoiled son, preferring not to work, however when the war is announced in the newspapers, his home-town love interest expresses how much more she will love him in his army suit. Thus, amid a grand parade for the soldiers, Jim joins the army and is united with Bull and Slim as they march into France. They are put on patrol in a small French village, and Jim falls in love with a young peasant woman there, Melisande. Their budding romance is cut short when the American soldiers are called to the front line.\n\nIn Section II: the plot is less rosy. The men march to the frontline through an elaborately staged set \u2013 through the woods, they march in formation amidst sniper fire and cannon fire at the front. Somehow the three men survive together in a bombed-out foxhole, but when Slim gets injured outside the foxhole, Jim tries to rescue him but it is too late. Both Jim and Bull get injured \u2013 and both Bull and Slim wind up dead. Jim\u2019s leg is injured, and though he tries, he is unable to bring himself to kill an enemy German in his foxhole who is also dying, so he gives the young man a cigarette. Jim is rescued by the red cross and is taken to a disgusting hospital in a church, but when he finds out the small French town where Melisande lives is being bombed, he attempts to flee the church on a crutch, but he cannot find her. He is taken home, and his father greets him, reminding him of his love back home, but Jim\u2019s mother witnesses Jim\u2019s brother his old girlfriend kissing. She has now fallen in love with his brother. Jim returns home on crutches with his leg amputated. After being home for a period, he departs for France in the hopes of finding Melisande.\n\nThe film was made only seven years after the Great War\u2019s armistice was reached, a ceasefire which was fresh in the minds of viewers. It was the first war film to tell the story from the perspective of a soldier. It was the first smash-hit box office success for the newly formed MGM studios, and it may well have been the most commercially successful silent film of all-time (though perhaps this title best rests with Birth of a Nation in 1915). The Big Parade was MGM\u2019s biggest hit until Gone With The Wind (1939). It established Director, King Vidor as one of the top directors in Hollywood for the rest of his life. The screenplay for the film was adopted by a semi-autobiographical novel by Laurence Stallings called Plumes.\n\nKing Vidor: some of his most well-regarded films today include The Big Parade (1925), and The Crowd (1928). He also famously directed the Kansas sequences of The Wizard of Oz (1939). He was raised in Texas and started a career as a freelance projectionist. He was a lifelong Republican, and a staunch anti-communist. He had one of the longest spanning careers as a director in Hollywood. He married three times, and died at age 88 of a heart attack at his ranch in Paso Robles, CA, in 1982 where the present-day olive oil business PasoLivo resides. He was a devoted Christian Scientist.\n\nThe Big Parade is a powerful film \u2013 emotional, violent, romantic, and even funny. It is an epic that forever changed the landscape of cinema and is a joy to watch. The playful scene of gum chewing in Section I counteracts the majestic battle sequences in Section II which are still as potent as when the film was released."}, {"url": "https://meetmeatthesodafountain.home.blog/2019/06/03/silent-film-review-the-big-parade-1925/", "page_content": "\u201cNo love has ever enthralled me as did the making of this picture. No achievement will ever excite me so much. No reward will ever be so great as having been a part of \u2018The Big Parade\u2019. It was the high point of my career. All that followed is balderdash.\u201d \u2013 John Gilbert\n\nThe Academy Awards were not around in 1925 however if they had been, MGM\u2019s WW1 epic The Big Parade would easily have won Best Picture. In fact, if the film were released today it would arguably be the best movie of 2019. Or of any year.\n\nDirected by the legendary King Vidor, The Big Parade tells the story of three American buddies \u2013 one wealthy and two working class \u2013 who are sent to France to fight in \u201cthe Great War\u201d. The film\u2019s protagonist is Jim Apperson (played by the dashing John Gilbert), the spoiled son of a wealthy businessman. Swept up by the big brass band and romantic patriotism during a recruitment parade, Jim eagerly jumps forth from the sea of waving flags to join his buddies to enlist. He is not the only one dazzled by the day\u2019s war propaganda, with its promise of heroic adventure: \u201cYou\u2019ll look gorgeous in an officer\u2019s uniform!\u201d his fianc\u00e9e gushes. \u201cI\u2019ll love you more than ever.\u201d Jim, like many young men, sees the war as his chance to travel and experience adventure; sadly his dreams of romantic heroism will mutate into real life nightmares of unspeakable horror and loss.\n\nAs historian Jeffrey Vance has pointed out, The Big Parade was made just seven years after the Armistice by the very generation that fought in World War 1. Indeed many in the cast and crew were directly involved in WW1 including Canadian actress Claire Adams who worked as a Red Cross nurse; actor Tom O\u2019Brien, who plays Jim\u2019s army buddy Bull, served in the Navy during 1917-1919 and Laurence Stallings, who wrote the film\u2019s story, had served as a Marine Captain and lost his leg fighting in the \u201cGreat War\u201d. The U.S. War Department (now known as the US Department of Defense) loaned MGM two-hundred Army trucks, four thousand soldiers and airplanes for use in the movie. Veterans of the American Expeditionary Forces worked as technical advisors on the film\u2019s combat scenes. (Source: Jeffrey Vance audio commentary, 2013 DVD release of The Big Parade)\n\nThe great writer F. Scott Fitzgerald once said that \u201cthe test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.\u201d The same can be said of a first-rate movie: The Big Parade manages to combine both light-hearted comedy and gritty drama to admirable effect. The first half of the movie, with its Chaplin-esque comic high jinks as the unit is billeted in a farming village, plays almost like summer camp, albeit a summer camp rife with head lice and fleas (\u201cWe drown the fleas in our Bee Vee Dees, we\u2019re in the Army now!\u201d the soldiers sing as they wash their laundry in a nearby creek), while the second half of the film exposes the brutal horrors of war. \u201cHow important every scene becomes when a death is being faced around the corner, just over the hills,\u201d Vidor said in an interview on the making of the film. \u201cBecause it gives a zest and a power to every scene you do.\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the sheer swoon-ability of the film\u2019s romance between Jim and village farm girl Melisande (stunningly played by actress Renee Adoree). Jim doesn\u2019t speak French and Melisande doesn\u2019t speak English but this doesn\u2019t stop them from falling in love. \u201cI don\u2019t understand a word you say,\u201d Jim says to Melisande. \u201cBut I know what you mean.\u201d This title card is also symbolic of silent film and the universal language of pantomime. Before sound, movies could be shown anywhere in the world \u2013 body language has no barrier. One of the film\u2019s most beloved scenes involves Jim teaching Melisande how to chew gum (she\u2019s never seen chewing gum before). The scene \u2013 which is one of the most joyful and romantic ever put to celluloid \u2013 was improvised by Vidor, Adoree and Gilbert. As per Gilbert after they finished filming, Vidor exclaimed \u201cI\u2019ll be damned if I ever saw a scene as good as that.\u201d In a later scene Jim receives a letter and photo from his fianc\u00e9e back home and must explain this to Melisande; the sadness and heartbreak in this scene is expressed by the actors\u2019 eyes and hand movements only. Their performances are both touching and organic \u2013 natural and human \u2013 not at all the exaggerated histrionics often associated with silent film. \u201cYou could have put all the dialogue in the world that you wanted (in that scene),\u201d King Vidor said, \u201cand you could have had sound and words and it would not have added one bit (to the scene).\u201d\n\nRomantic comedies have been considered box office poison for years now. Personally I blame 1998\u2019s There\u2019s Something About Mary and the genre\u2019s subsequent decline into cynicism and sleaze. When it comes to bringing sexy back, today\u2019s filmmakers could learn a lot from The Big Parade. Let the adults show \u2018em how it\u2019s done.\n\nOf course, the effectiveness of the film\u2019s romance owes a lot to John Gilbert (insert rapturous sigh here), also known as \u201cThe Great Lover.\u201d It is impossible to describe Gilbert without using the word \u201cdashing\u201d, however good looks alone do not a sex symbol make: in addition to his physical beauty, Gilbert possessed a great deal of vulnerability, a trait he shared with other classic sex symbols such as Clara Bow and Marilyn Monroe. Also like Bow and Monroe, John Gilbert was much more than just a pretty face; neglected by his parents and orphaned at the age of sixteen, the self-educated Gilbert went on to write and direct films, in addition to becoming one of the most popular actors of the silent era. Indeed, his performance in The Big Parade is considered one of the finest of the silent period. Though his popularity waned with the arrival of talkies, Gilbert\u2019s career was derailed not by his voice (which was just fine) but by poor scripts that were weighted down with ridiculous dialogue. His lovely body ravaged by alcoholism, Gilbert would succumb to a heart attack in 1936. He was only 38 years old.\n\nThere are many parades in The Big Parade, all are memorable and all are moving, but the most chilling is the \u201cbloody ballet\u201d, as the troops make their way to the front in a woods filled with enemy snipers. King Vidor used a metronome and bass drum on the set during the filming of this scene. He instructed the actors to take each step forward on the beat of the drum. Every physical move had to be taken on a drum beat. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d one of the extras griped. \u201cA bloody ballet?\u201d Vidor conceded later that was exactly what it was: \u201ca bloody ballet \u2013 a ballet of death.\u201d\n\nThe battle scenes in The Big Parade are genuinely suspenseful and horrifying, without reveling in gore as many modern war films do today. As per King Vidor, before the Big Parade, \u201cwar had not been explored from the GI viewpoint.\u201d The title cards in the film express a soldier\u2019s anguish: \u201cI came to fight \u2013 not to wait and rot in a lousy hole while they murder my pal!\u201d Jim exclaims. \u201cWaiting! Orders! Mud! Blood! Stinking stiffs! What the hell do we get out of this war anyway! Cheers when we left and when we get back! But who the hell cares\u2026after this?\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Warner Bros. released a gorgeous 4K digital restoration of the Big Parade on DVD, taken from the original camera negative, with the original music score composed by Carl Davis. The DVD extras include audio commentary by historian Jeffrey Vance and audio interviews with director King Vidor. I found a used copy of this DVD at Sonic Boom for twelve dollars and it is now the prize of my classic film collection.\n\nPrior to making The Big Parade, King Vidor told MGM head of production Irving Thalberg that he was \u201cweary of ephemeral films (that) came to town and played a week or so\u201d and that he wanted to work on something that \u201chad a chance at long runs throughout the country and the world.\u201d\n\nAlmost ninety-four years after its premiere, The Big Parade still enthralls audiences around the world. Talk about long runs. Mission accomplished, Mr. Vidor.\n\nLong live the King.\n\nReview written by Heather Babcock, 2019\n\nAdvertisement"}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/movies/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/big-parade", "page_content": "THE BIG PARADE\n\nUSA, 1925\n\nDirector: King Vidor\n\nProduction: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures Corp.; originally black and white with tinted sequences, 35mm, silent with music score; running time: about 125 minutes; length: originally 13 reels at 12,550 feet, later 12 reels at 11,519 feet.

Vidor countered that the huge success of the Laurence Stallings-Maxwell Anderson WWI play What Price Glory? on Broadway the previous year suggested otherwise. MGM gave him the green light to make The Big Parade.\n\nThe script by Harry Behn was based upon an outline Vidor had solicited from Stallings himself. It deals with three men from an unnamed American town who are swept up in the wave of patriotic fervor following America's entrance into the war and enlist. One, Tom O'Brien, is a salty bartender; another, Karl Dane, is a gawky, tobacco chewing blue collar type; the third, played by matinee idol John Gilbert, is the lay-about son of a wealthy mill owner. Despite their disparate backgrounds, the three become fast chums when they meet at boot camp and sustain their comradeship through the ferocious battle of Belleau Wood where they undergo their baptism of fire.\n\nAlong the way, Gilbert meets and falls in love with a French farm girl, delightfully and movingly played by Ren\u00e9e Ador\u00e9e. The scene where he introduces her to American chewing gum is one of the most famous in silent films. It is both funny and touching, and wonderfully pantomimed by the two actors under the scrutiny of Vidor's camera, which captures the moment in an uninterrupted single take. A follow-up scene where the lovers are separated is equally memorable. As Gilbert is spirited to the front in one of a long line of battle trucks, he vows to return, tossing her mementos until she is left alone in a trail of dust.\n\nGilbert's buddies are killed during a nighttime assault on the German trenches, and Gilbert himself suffers a severely wounded leg that subsequently must be amputated; he returns home a cripple. The glamour studio balked at the downbeat fate visited upon the film's leading man\u2014an incident drawn from the experience of author Stallings, who had lost a leg in the war. In his quest for realism, Vidor held his ground, however, and got his way. The scene where Gilbert's mutilation is revealed to his mother and the viewer for the first time at his homecoming is arguably the most powerful in the movie.\n\nDespite, or perhaps because of, his affliction and hellish wartime experience, the Gilbert character has now grown and matured\u2014in contrast to his brother (Robert Oder), previously viewed as the more serious and responsible sibling, but now as the real nothing in the family. Having stayed behind to attend to the family business, he's even stolen Gilbert's hometown sweetheart (Claire Adams)! No matter. At his mother's urging, Gilbert returns to France to find the love of his life Ador\u00e9e as he'd promised.\n\nThe Big Parade is really two films. The first hour and twenty minutes are standard (though at the time prototypical) service comedy stuff dealing with Gilbert's, O'Brien's, and Dane's escapades in France prior to going into action. Part two, which runs approximately the same length, is all war\u2014and the battle scenes remain frighteningly realistic and impressive to this day. The march through Belleau Wood, timed by Vidor to the inexorable beat of a metronome, as the troops are mowed down by snipers and machine gun fire is still a stunner. The trench warfare scenes are equally vivid. Many critics have noted the influence Vidor's staging of these scenes had on Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front (1930). There is even a small moment when Gilbert plucks a lone flower from atop his trench that mirrors the finale of All Quiet when Lew Ayres is killed reaching for a butterfly, and which may have served as the latter's inspiration.\n\nWhere The Big Parade departs significantly from All Quiet is the clarity of its anti-war theme. All Quiet is uncompromisingly focused in this regard. The Big Parade, despite the stark believability of its warfare scenes, is, in overall aim, more of an escapist entertainment. In his later years, Vidor all but disowned the film for that reason. \"At the time, I really believed it was an anti-war movie,\" he said. \"Today, I don't encourage people to see it.\"\n\nVidor's reassessment is too harsh. The Big Parade is one of the great silent films\u2014and the model for just about every war movie that has come our way since. It should be seen for those reasons alone. While the escapist boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl sub-plot may stray the focus away from Vidor's anti-war message at times, it eloquently engages the emotions. And the theme that war is hell, while perhaps not what the film is entirely about, is nevertheless both present and potent.\n\n\u2014John McCarty"}, {"url": "https://oldhollywoodincolor.com/2013/10/16/the-big-parade-1925-new-on-blu-ray/", "page_content": "When the First World War ended in November 1918, the public was not only sick of war, they were sick of movies about the war.

All Quiet is uncompromisingly focused in this regard. The Big Parade , despite the stark believability of its warfare scenes, is, in overall aim, more of an escapist entertainment. In his later years, Vidor all but disowned the film for that reason. \"At the time, I really believed it was an anti-war movie,\" he said. \"Today, I don't encourage people to see it.\"\n\nVidor's reassessment is too harsh. The Big Parade is one of the great silent films\u2014and the model for just about every war movie that has come our way since. It should be seen for those reasons alone. While the escapist boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl sub-plot may stray the focus away from Vidor's anti-war message at times, it eloquently engages the emotions. And the theme that war is hell, while perhaps not what the film is entirely about, is nevertheless both present and potent."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/movies/homevideo/king-vidors-1925-silent-big-parade-comes-to-blu-ray.html", "page_content": "At this moment, there\u2019s probably no better way of dispelling the tiresome myth that silent films were technically and dramatically crude than by directing skeptics to the radiant new Blu-ray of \u201cThe Big Parade\u201d from Warner Home Video. Directed by King Vidor, and originally released by MGM in November 1925, this tale of three buddies caught up in what then was called the Great War was one of the most financially successful films of the silent era. It played for almost two years at the Astor Theater in New York and enjoyed similar success worldwide.\n\nToday, the film remains a heartfelt but shrewdly judged blend of comedy, romance, action and tragedy \u2014 a movie that perfectly embodies the classical Hollywood ideal of providing something to appeal to every member of what, in the 1920s, was a wide public still unsevered by demographic categories.\n\n\u201cThe Big Parade\u201d also happens to be one of the relatively few silent features for which the original negative still exists. That\u2019s something of a miracle, given the general rule that, the more popular a film was, the more likely it is to have come down to us in compromised versions. In the early days of the medium, it was common for projection prints to be made directly from the actual film that passed through the camera, which resulted in copies of great brilliance and detail.\n\nBut as those camera negatives were used and reused, they gradually disintegrated, which meant that new prints could only made by duplicating old prints. The inevitable result was a loss of contrast and definition, and the transference of accumulated dirt and scratches from one generation to the next. The original photographic qualities are muted and compromised, and what remains can often seem a dim, jittery, striated mess, quite often projected at the wrong speed. Such were the \u201cflickers\u201d that so many people first encountered on television, and understandably preferred never to encounter again."}], "The Jazz Singer was released in 1927.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Jazz-Singer-film-1927", "page_content": "The Jazz Singer, American musical film, released in 1927, that was the first feature-length movie with synchronized dialogue. It marked the ascendancy of \u201ctalkies\u201d and the end of the silent-film era.\n\n(Read Lillian Gish\u2019s 1929 Britannica essay on silent film.)\n\nBritannica Quiz Oscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nOn Yom Kippur, cantor Rabinowitz (played by Warner Oland) looks forward to when his 13-year-old son, Jakie (Robert Gordon), will succeed him at the synagogue. However, after discovering that Jakie is singing in a saloon, the cantor beats him, and Jakie runs away from home. As an adult (Al Jolson), Jakie becomes a jazz singer, performing under the name Jack Robin. When his father falls ill before Yom Kippur, Jakie must choose between singing at the dress rehearsal of his new Broadway show or singing the Kol Nidre at the synagogue in his father\u2019s place. Jakie finishes his number and rushes to the synagogue, where his father hears him singing the Kol Nidre and then dies, reconciled to Jakie.\n\nAlthough widely credited with being the first talkie, the accolade is somewhat misleading. Other films had synchronized sound for music or sound effects prior to this film. The small studio Warner Brothers had bought a sound-on-disc system called Vitaphone and debuted the system in 1926 with Don Juan, a lavish costume drama featuring a score performed by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. However, The Jazz Singer, the second Vitaphone feature, was the first full feature film to have a sound track that included dialogue (though only the musical numbers and some select conversations amounting to one-fourth of the film were recorded for sound). The first feature in which all the dialogue was recorded was another Warner Brothers Vitaphone film, Lights of New York (1928).\n\nComedians Eddie Cantor and George Jessel (who played the lead role in the 1925 play on which the movie is based) both turned down the film, leaving the historic role for Jolson. Studio executive Sam Warner, one of the founders of Warner Brothers and the creative force behind the film, died one day before the movie\u2019s premiere, which was intentionally set for the day before Yom Kippur. One of Jolson\u2019s first lines, \u201cYou ain\u2019t heard nothin\u2019 yet,\u201d came to symbolize the arrival of the talking picture. The film\u2019s financial success established Warner Brothers as a major studio, and the studio won an honorary Academy Award for \u201cproducing The Jazz Singer, the pioneer outstanding talking picture, which has revolutionized the industry.\u201d There have been many remakes of the story onscreen and onstage. Jolson\u2019s performance in blackface has long been studied for what it says about stereotypes and the problems of assimilation often encountered by ethnic groups."}, {"url": "https://www.historylink.org/File/2485", "page_content": "On December 30, 1927, The Jazz Singer, the first commercially successful full-length feature film with sound, debuts at the Blue Mouse Theater at 1421 5th Avenue in Seattle. The movie uses Warner Brothers' Vitaphone sound-on-disc technology to reproduce the musical score and sporadic episodes of synchronized speech.\n\nThis was the first showing of the film on the West Coast after it opened in New York City in October. Costing its studio, Warner Bros., the (then) enormous sum of $500,000 to make, the picture starred Al Jolson (1886-1950). Tickets at the Blue Mouse were 50 cents each, double the pre-talkie price, but far less than what audiences were paying for tickets on the Great White Way (i.e. Broadway in New York with its blazing marquees).\n\nThe Jazz Singer, based the stage play by Samson Raphaelson (itself based on Alfred Cohn\u2019s story \"The Day of Atonement\"), cast Jolson as a cantor\u2019s son who pursues a career as a vaudeville song and dance man, spurning the wishes of his Jewish parents, who would rather he sung traditional music. The picture, a highly sentimental one, was surprisingly effective and \u201cmoved crowds to tears yesterday at the Blue Mouse\u201d (\u201cAl Jolso[n] in Jazz Singer Stirs Crowds\u201d).\n\nAlthough the song and dialogue portions of The Jazz Singer were limited to a handful of scenes, they meshed nicely with the rest of the film, shot in silent film format. Interestingly, the Vitaphone movie -- together with several Vitaphone shorts -- competed on the same bill with the Movietone News, shot using a competing sound-on-film technology. Sound-on-film would eventually become the industry standard.\n\nThere was actually a minor Seattle connection with the specific movie that is credited with debuting a fully synchronized orchestral soundtrack. In August 1926 the Hollywood film Don Juan (with John Barrymore) was released with a musical score performed by the New York Philharmonic as conducted by Henry Hadley (1871-1937). And it was Hadley whose 1909-1911 stint as director with the Seattle Symphony Orchestra saw record-breaking attendance and much praise heaped upon him by fans as well as the media. Ultimately though, Don Juan failed to recoup its production costs, a disappointed Warner Brothers shifted focus to promoting The Jazz Singer, and its overwhelming success caused the former movie's historical status to fade and the latter to often be misidentified as the world's first \"soundie.\""}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/literature-and-arts/performing-arts/film-and-television/jazz-singer", "page_content": "THE JAZZ SINGER\n\nUSA, 1927\n\nDirector: Alan Crosland\n\nProduction: Warner Bros.

It was not the first sound picture\u2014 sound films are as old as the cinema itself\u2014and it was not the first Vitaphone feature\u2014that was Don Juan\u2014nor was it the first alltalking Vitaphone feature\u2014that was The Lights of New York. The Jazz Singer is important because it was the first film with sound to catch the imagination of an audience. As one contemporary critic, Welford Beaton, wrote, \"The Jazz Singer definitely establishes the fact that talking pictures are imminent.\"\n\nUnlike the sound films that had preceded it, The Jazz Singer boasted all the right components in the right mixture. It had a sentimental\u2014silly, even by the standards of the day\u2014story involving mother love, honor and a young man's striving for success. The film featured such songs as \"Toot, Toot, Tootsie,\" \"Mother o' Mine,\" \"Mammy,\" and \"Blue Skies,\" which were to become lasting successes. (Irving Berlin had written \"Blue Skies\" a year earlier, but it became a standard after it was featured in The Jazz Singer.) Above all, The Jazz Singer starred Al Jolson, a legendary performer, on stage from the early years of the century, whose presence somehow lent validity to the production and gave it something special. Robert Benchley, writing in the old humor magazine Life, jokingly summed up the power of Jolson's performance: \"When Jolson enters, it is as if an electric current had been run along the wires under the seats where the hats are stuck. The house came to tumultuous attention. He speaks, rolls his eyes, compresses his lips, and it is all over. He trembles his lip, and your hearts break with a loud snap. He sings, and you totter out to send a night letter to your mother.\" And as if Jolson's presence was not enough, Warner Bros. wisely cast a major silent screen actress, Mae McAvoy, to play opposite him.\n\nSupposedly based on Al Jolson's own life, The Jazz Singer first saw life as a magazine story, \"The Day of Atonement,\" by Samson Raphaelson. Raphaelson\u2014who was to become a prominent screen writer in the 1930s\u2014adapted his story into a stageplay, which became a major success for its star George Jessel (who was initially cast in the film version, but backed out at the last minute apparently in a dispute over money). The story of The Jazz Singer concerns Jakie Rabinowitz who yearns to sing popular songs, but whose father, a cantor, wishes him to follow in his footsteps. Jakie leaves home, changes his name to Jack Robin (selecting a Gentile name in rejection not only of his father but also of his Jewish faith), and goes on the stage. As he is about to get his big break, opening as the star of a Broadway musical, Jakie learns that his father has been taken seriously ill. Realizing his true feelings and his place in his Jewish family, serious Jakie sings the \"Kol Nidre\" that night, delaying the opening of his show. The musical eventually opens, starring Jakie and his Gentile girlfriend, Mary Dale, and that night Jakie's mother realizes, \"He is not my boy any more. He belongs to the world.\"\n\nThe plot is ludicrous, and was treated as such even by contemporary critics, many of whom complained that the story was \"too Jewish.\" (Of course, it is worth noting that despite the awfulness of the story, The Jazz Singer has been twice remade.) What is exciting about the film is its use of sound\u2014not only the interpolated dialogue and songs, but also the musical score and sound effects arranged by Louis Silvers (who skillfully blends elements of popular music with elements of serious music by Tchaikovsky, Debussy and others).\n\nJolson's first spoken words\u2014\"Wait a minute, wait a minute, you ain't heard nothing yet. Wait a minute, I tell you. You ain't heard nothing yet. Do you want to hear 'Toot, Toot, Tootsie?\"'\u2014are electrifying in their intensity even today, some 60 or more years since they were first uttered. It is as if the viewer were participating in a very personal way, in a moment of historic significance. Similarly, there is something embarrassingly private about Jolson's remarks to his mother as he sits at the piano and sings \"Blue Skies\" to her. Jolson's apparently improvised ramblings are perhaps a little too real and, therefore, almost a little too artificial and stilted. The impact of this last dialogue sequence is further emphasized by its abrupt ending as Warner Oland (in the role of Cantor Rabinowitz) enters the scene. He looks at his wife and son, and through a title, shouts \"Stop.\" The dialogue, the human voice, is stilled, and The Jazz Singer once again becomes a silent film with musical accompaniment.\n\nAlan Crosland brings almost a documentary quality to many of the scenes, particularly the opening sequences in which Jakie, as a child, sings at a local saloon. (It is the voice of Jakie as a child, played by Bobby Gordon, that is the voice first heard in the film.) The director is obviously a highly competent technician, and gets the best from his players, even such notorious purveyors of melodrama as Warner Oland and Eugenie Besserer.\n\nThe critics admired the film, but loved Al Jolson. One commented that \"He is as solitary upon the heights of an art he has made peculiarly his own as Chaplin is upon his.\" Indeed, with The Jazz Singer Jolson heralded a new era which was to bring about the ultimate decline of Chaplin and his contemporaries, destroying one art form and creating another. Perhaps the one irony is that despite its place in the history of the sound film, the sound system utilized for The Jazz Singer\u2014Vitaphone\u2014was not the system that ultimately became standard in the industry. Vitaphone utilized sound on disc, and the future of the industry lay with sound on film.\n\n\u2014Anthony Slide"}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/this-day-history-oct-6-1927-jazz-singer-released-film-synchronized-sound", "page_content": "\"The Jazz Singer\" starring Al Jolson, the first movie that incorporated synchronized speaking parts for its actors, was released on this day in history, Oct. 6, 1927.\n\nPrimitive by today\u2019s standards, the movie revolutionized cinema in the United States and beyond and is recognized as a landmark achievement in pop culture history.\n\n\"Wait a minute, wait a minute, you ain\u2019t heard nothing yet,\" said Jolson, portraying Jakie Rabinowitz, in the first words uttered in cinematic history.\n\nON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, OCT. 5, 1813, WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON ROUTS BRITS, TECUMSEH IN BATTLE OF THE THAMES\n\n\"When [Jolson] spoke those words on the silver screen of Warner Bros' flagship theater in New York\u2019s Times Square, the audience became hysterical,\" the National Museum of American History notes.\n\n\"The truth is, they hadn\u2019t heard anything yet, at least not in the movies, and certainly not with Vitaphone synchronized dialogue and song sequences.\"\n\nJolson plays the scion of a devout Jewish family who dreams of performing pop tunes outside the local synagogue, where his father is the cantor.\n\nThe soundtrack \u2014 before the term existed or at least was widely known \u2014 featured classic tunes such as \"Toot, Toot, Tootsie (Goo\u2019 Bye),\" a hit for Jolson in 1922.\n\nJAMES BOND DAY: BOND GIRLS URSULA ANDRESS AND LANA WOOD REMINISCE ABOUT WORKING WITH SEAN CONNERY\n\n\"The Jazz Singer\" was based on the 1925 Broadway production of the same name.\n\nIt spawned several remakes, including a 1952 movie starring Danny Thomas, a 1959 TV production with Jerry Lee Lewis and a 1980 flick featuring Neil Diamond.\n\n\"When (Jolson) spoke \u2026 the audience became hysterical.\" \u2013 National Museum of American History\n\n\"Though hardly a cinematic masterpiece \u2014 or even a good film, for that matter \u2014 the 1927 version of \u2018The Jazz Singer\u2019 remains one of the most important motion pictures ever made,\" writes the Alt Film Guide.\n\n\"This part-musical, part-silent, all-mush melodrama marked the first time in a feature film that synchronized sound and voices could be heard in musical numbers and talking segments.\"\n\nON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, OCT. 4, 1927, MOUNT RUSHMORE'S MOMENT OF CREATION BEGINS IN SOUTH DAKOTA\n\nThe movie has enjoyed multi-generational acclaim.

It was the first feature-length film to included a synchronised recorded music score accompanied by lip-synced singing. It also featured speech in a handful of isolated sequences.\n\nAlthough it wasn\u2019t initially apparent, the film\u2019s released marked the end of the silent film era and marked the dawn of sound films. Of course, silent films were still released for a time after the film\u2019s debut, but retrospectively The Jazz Singer is seen as the turning point in modern cinema.\n\nThe Jazz Singer was produced by influential studio Warner Bros. and their newfound Vitaphone sound-on-disc system. This groundbreaking technique involved playing back or recording sounds on a gramophone in sync with a motion picture. Consequently of its pioneering style and filming techniques, in 1996, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of \u201cculturally, historically or aesthetically significant\u201d motion pictures.\n\nThe film was a huge hit. It features six songs performed by the mega-star of the day, Al Jolson. The narrative was based on a 1925 play of the same name by Samson Raphaelson, which the writer had adopted from one of his short stories entitled The Day of Atonement.\n\nThe funny thing about the film is that The Day of Atonement was originally based on the life of its star Al Jolson. It had been written in 1922 and published in Everybody\u2019s Magazine. Raphaelson had been captivated by Jolson\u2019s performance in the stage play Robinson Crusoe, Jr. at a show in Champaign, Illinois. In a 1927 interview, he recalled: \u201cI shall never forget the first five minutes of Jolson\u2014his velocity, the amazing fluidity with which he shifted from a tremendous absorption in his audience to a tremendous absorption in his song.\u201d\n\nAfter The Day of Atonement was adapted into the stage play version of The Jazz Singer, it premiered at the Warner Theatre in Times Square in September 1925. The play became a hit, with leading man George Jessell grabbing the headlines. The size of its hit led Warner Bros. to acquire the movie rights to the play on June 4, 1926. They also snapped up leading man Jessel. However, things were not to be. Jessel eventually left the project due to money demands that Warner Bros. couldn\u2019t meet and a disdain for how the movie\u2019s ending diverged heavily from the plays.\n\nHis role was subsequently offered to Jessel\u2019s friend and man of the hour, Al Jolson. It was noted in Jessel\u2019s autobiography that the pair did not speak for a time after, as Jessel had confided in Jolson his issues with the Warners. Furthermore, Jolson signed the contract without telling Jessel. In the end, though, Jessel wrote that Jolson \u201cmust not be blamed, as the Warners had definitely decided that I was out.\u201d In 1999, film historian Donald Crafton wrote of the decision. \u201cThe entertainer, who sang jazzed-up minstrel numbers in blackface, was at the height of his phenomenal popularity. Anticipating the later stardom of crooners and rock stars, Jolson electrified audiences with the vitality and sex appeal of his songs and gestures, which owed much to African-American sources.\u201d\n\nThe film\u2019s narrative depicts the fictional story of Jakie Rabinowitz, who was based on Jolson. Rabinowitz is a young man who defies his family\u2019s devout Jewish traditions. Early in the plot, Rabinowitz is punished by his father, a hazzan (Jewish cantor/musician), after singing popular songs in a beer garden. This prompts the young protagonist to run away from home. Ten years later, now going by Jack Robin, he has become a talented jazz singer. He attempts to build a career as an entertainer, using blackface, but his professional dreams ultimately come into conflict with his family and heritage demands.\n\nUpon its release in 1927, the film was a hit, albeit not universally. However, the more illustrious elements of the American press loved it. Mordaunt Hall, The New York Times\u2018 first-ever film critic, offered a more grounded take \u201cnot since the first presentation of Vitaphone features, more than a year ago (i.e., Don Juan), has anything like the ovation been heard in a motion-picture theatre [\u2026] The Vitaphoned songs and some dialogue have been introduced most adroitly. This in itself is an ambitious move, for in the expression of song, the Vitaphone vitalises the production enormously. The dialogue is not so effective, for it does not always catch the nuances of speech or inflexions of the voice so that one is not aware of the mechanical features.\u201d\n\nShowing that it was the technological aspect and the leading man that made the film, rather than its script, the headline of The Los Angeles Times review contended: \u201c\u2018Jazz Singer\u2019 Scores a Hit\u2014Vitaphone and Al Jolson Responsible, Picture Itself Second Rate.\u201d\n\nThe film\u2019s legacy also established the profit potentials for \u2018the talkies\u2019. The film made an impressive sum, but this was not overnight as some claims stake. The Warners had a clause in the films contract which entitled it to lengthy runs in cinemas throughout the country. Instead of a flat rental fee, they took a cut of the gate receipts. This gave the studio an increased take the longer the film was shown in theatres.\n\nA major key to the film\u2019s success was this innovative marketing scheme. It was the brainchild of Warner Bros.\u2019 sales manager, Sam Morris. In 1999, Crafton argued that \u201cthe signing of this contract by the greater New York Fox Theatres circuit was regarded as a headline-making precedent.\u201d To a considerable degree, Crafton is bang on the mark. Like the film\u2019s use of technology, Morris\u2019s arrangement would also set a game-changing precedent. Similar agreements, based on taking a cut of the gross rather than flat fees, would soon become standard for the U.S. film industry, giving rise to blockbusters.\n\nHowever, the film has also been highly divisive. The use of blackface and narrative themes of religion has caused a considerable disparity in the discourse on The Jazz Singer. Although the use of blackface was widespread at the time, it is now considered crass and highly racist. In 2005, scholar Corin Willis commented on the films unusual conflation of blackface and the central narrative: \u201cIn contrast to the racial jokes and innuendo brought out in its subsequent persistence in early sound film, blackface imagery in The Jazz Singer is at the core of the film\u2019s central theme, an expressive and artistic exploration of the notion of duplicity and ethnic hybridity within American identity. Of the more than seventy examples of blackface in early sound film 1927\u201353 that I have viewed (including the nine blackface appearances Jolson subsequently made), The Jazz Singer is unique in that it is the only film where blackface is central to the narrative development and thematic expression.\u201d\n\nSuch positivist re-examinations of the film do not abound everywhere, though. In 2000, Seymour Stark maintained that the Russian-born Jolson embodied internalised racism as the star of blackface stage shows. He argues, \u201cThe immigrant Jew as Broadway star\u2026works within a blackface minstrel tradition that obscures his Jewish pedigree, but proclaims his white identity. Jolson\u2019s slight Yiddish accent was hidden by a Southern veneer\u201d.\n\nSeymour Stark also maintained that The Jazz Singer avoids discussing the tension between Jewish identity and assimilation into American culture. He claims the film has a far more sinister undertone. He states its \u201ccovert message\u2026is that the symbol of blackface provides the Jewish immigrant with the same rights and privileges accorded to earlier generations of European immigrants initiated into the rituals of the minstrel show.\u201d\n\nIn 1998, W.T. Lhamon presented a more middling account of the film\u2019s narrative and use of blackface. The esteemed academic claims that the character of Jack Robin \u201ccompounds both tradition and stardom. The Warner Brothers thesis is that, really to succeed, a man must first acknowledge his ethnic self.\u201d Lhamon goes on to argue that the \u201cwhole film builds toward the blacking-up scene at the dress rehearsal. Jack Robin needs the blackface mask as the agency of his compounded identity. Blackface will hold all the identities together without freezing them in a singular relationship or replacing their parts.\u201d\n\nRegardless of what one thinks about the racial narrative issues inherent to The Jazz Singer, technologically and business-wise, the film was groundbreaking. It signified the start of the golden era of \u2018the talkies\u2019 and highlighted significant financial possibilities of big-budget motion pictures. The Jazz Singer marked the start of the era of the all-powerful Hollywood studios that still lasts to this day.\n\nUltimately, given it was the era of Jim Crow and that America was highly racially charged, we\u2019ll let you make your own mind up on the racial and religious themes."}, {"url": "https://www.liveabout.com/the-jazz-singer-1779241", "page_content": "When The Jazz Singer, starring Al Jolson, was released as a feature-length movie on October 6, 1927, it was the first movie that included dialogue and music on the filmstrip itself.\n\nAdding Sounds to Film\n\nBefore The Jazz Singer, there were silent films. Despite their name, these films were not silent for they were accompanied by music. Often, these films were accompanied by a live orchestra in the theater and from as early as 1900, films were often synchronized with musical scores that were played on amplified record players.\n\nThe technology advanced in the 1920s when Bell Laboratories developed a way to allow an audio track to be placed on the film itself. This technology, called Vitaphone, was first used as a musical track in a film titled Don Juan in 1926. Although Don Juan had music and sound effects, there were no spoken words in the film.\n\nActors Talking on Film\n\nWhen Sam Warner of the Warner Brothers planned The Jazz Singer, he anticipated that the film would use silent periods to tell the story and the Vitaphone technology would be used for the singing of music, just as the new technology had been used in Don Juan.\n\nHowever, during the filming of The Jazz Singer, superstar of the time Al Jolson ad-libbed dialogue in two different scenes and Warner liked the end result.\n\nThus, when The Jazz Singer was released on October 6, 1927, it became the first feature-length film (89 minutes long) to include dialogue on the filmstrip itself. The Jazz Singer made way for the future of \"talkies,\" which is what movies with audio soundtracks were called.\n\nSo What Did Al Jolson Actually Say?\n\nThe first words Jolson recites are: \u201cWait a minute! Wait a minute! You ain\u2019t heard nothin\u2019 yet!\u201d Jolson spoke 60 words in one scene and 294 words in another\n\nThe rest of the film is silent, with words written on black, title cards just like in silent movies. The only sound (besides the few words by Jolson) are the songs.\n\nThe Storyline of the Jazz Singer\n\nThe Jazz Singer is a movie about Jakie Rabinowitz, the son of a Jewish cantor who wants to be a jazz singer but is pressured by his father to use his God-given voice to sing as a cantor. With five generations of Rabinowitz men as cantors, Jakie's father (played by Warner Oland) is adamant that Jakie has no choice in the matter.\n\nJakie, however, has other plans. After being caught singing \"raggy time songs\" at a beer garden, Cantor Rabinowitz gives Jakie a belt whipping. That's the last straw for Jakie; he runs away from home.\n\nAfter setting off on his own, adult Jakie (played by Al Jolson) works hard to become a success in the field of jazz. He meets a girl, Mary Dale (played by May McAvoy), and she helps him improve his act.\n\nAs Jakie, now known as Jack Robin, becomes increasingly successful, he continues to crave the support and love of his family. His mother (played by Eugenie Besserer) supports him, but his father is disgusted that his son wants to be a jazz singer.\n\nThe climax of the movie revolves around a dilemma. Jakie must choose between starring in a Broadway show or returning to his deathly ill father and singing Kol Nidre at the synagogue. Both occur on the very same night. As Jakie says in the film (on a title card), \"It's a choice between giving up the biggest chance of my life -- and breaking my mother's heart.\"\n\nThis dilemma resonated with audiences for the 1920s were full of such decisions. With the older generation holding tight to tradition, the newer generation was rebelling, becoming flappers, listening to jazz, and dancing the Charleston.\n\nUltimately, Jakie couldn't break his mother's heart and so he sang Kol Nidre that night. The Broadway show was canceled. There is a happy ending though -- we see Jakie starring in his own show just a few months later.\n\nAl Jolson's Blackface\n\nIn the first of two scenes where Jakie is struggling with his choice, we see Al Jolson applying black makeup all over his face (except for near his lips) and then covering his hair with a wig. Although unacceptable today, the concept of blackface was popular at the time.\n\nThe movie ends with Jolson again in blackface, singing \"My Mammy.\""}, {"url": "https://time.com/3457278/the-jazz-singer/", "page_content": "This day in 1927, Oct. 6, made TIME\u2019s list of \u201c80 Days That Changed the World,\u201d and with good reason: that evening marked the premiere of The Jazz Singer, the \u201ctalkie\u201d that sits at the transition point between silent movies and a Hollywood where sound is as important as sight. The Jazz Singer was the first feature-length movie with spoken dialogue and \u2014 though it was neither the first sound on film nor the first film with talking throughout, and its minstrel-show plot doesn\u2019t exactly stand up to modern scrutiny \u2014 it was one of the most important movies ever made. As Richard Corliss wrote, explaining the date\u2019s presence on the list:\n\n\u201cWait a minute, wait a minute. You ain\u2019t heard nothin\u2019 yet!\u201d cried Al Jolson halfway through The Jazz Singer.

What was important about it, the review in the Oct. 17, 1927, issue stated, was that it was Al Jolson\u2019s first movie, and that it was noteworthy that his singing voice could be preserved. \u201cThe Vitaphone permits him to talk and sing his way through the sentimental mazes of the movie adaptation,\u201d the reviewer noted. No mention whatsoever of the real historic value of the movie.\n\nBut 1920s cinemaphiles could be forgiven for missing the point. As a matter of fact, most of them would have missed the sound entirely. Within just a few years, it was eminently clear that the movie was more important than its star \u2014 but there had been a serious technical hindrance to moviegoers realizing as much when it first came out. As TIME\u2019s 1933 review of the Jolson picture Hallelujah, I\u2019m a Bum explained:\n\nJolson and his career will be remembered because The Jazz Singer was the first sound picture ever made. It cost $500,000 and when it was released in Manhattan on Oct. 6, 1927, there were less than 100 theatres in the world equipped to show it. The success of The Jazz Singer definitely ended Hollywood\u2019s happiest era, launched the fortunes of Warner Brothers who produced it, established Al Jolson for a short time as the greatest personality in the amusement business. Jolson\u2019s later pictures have been less successful but he still has most of the $2,000,000 which made him a few years ago reputedly the third richest actor in the world.\n\nThe reason The Jazz Singer didn\u2019t impress when it was first released was that most people were seeing a different, silent version of the movie \u2014 a version which, TIME\u2019s critic in 1927 intuited, wasn\u2019t very interesting.\n\nRead Richard Corliss\u2019 full explanation for why Oct. 6, 1927, was so important: Now Hear This!\n\nWrite to Lily Rothman at lily.rothman@time.com."}], "The Public Enemy was released in 1931.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Public-Enemy", "page_content": "The Public Enemy, American gangster film, released in 1931, that became a classic and propelled its lead, James Cagney, to stardom.\n\nThe story traces the life of an impoverished young man, Tom Powers (played by Cagney), as he escalates from being a petty criminal to heading a murderous bootlegging ring.

The Great Depression of the 1930s and the Prohibition of all alcoholic beverages from 1920 to 1933 meant that crime was on the rise which enabled the rise of the gangster movie.\n\nAudiences were hungry to watch cinematic film versions of the thugs that were headlining the news. With the success of Little Caesar in 1931, it was inevitable that Warner Bros. would soon release another gangster movie.\n\nThe Public Enemy was released on April 23, 1931. The film tells the story of two young Irish American thugs, Tom Powers and Matt Doyle who begin their lives of crime as boys in the slums to become bootleggers for the ruthless but respectful Paddy Ryan.\n\nIt does not take long before Tom and Matt become killers. They connect with notorious gangster Samuel \u201cNails\u201d Nathan and begin to enjoy the trappings of their newfound wealth, such as donning tailor-made tuxedos, driving expensive cars, and dating beautiful women.\n\nTom Powers (James Cagney) prepares for bloody vengeance\n\nTom\u2019s simple-minded mother is oblivious to Tom\u2019s criminal activities and believes he is a good boy. Tom\u2019s brother Mike learns that his brother\u2019s money did not come from politics as claimed, but from bootlegging.\n\nFollowing an angry confrontation, Tom reacts angrily regarding his brother\u2019s war experience: \u201cYour hands ain\u2019t so clean. You killed and liked it. You didn\u2019t get them medals for holding hands with the Germans\u201d.\n\nTom and Matt continue their life of crime, but their ambitions would soon have bloody consequences.\n\nThe Public Enemy still packs a powerful punch as entertainment but is also an effective study of how poverty can turn young people into a life of crime. The film also featured a written prologue and epilogue with a demand for action against the hoodlums of the underworld.\n\nIt was the breakthrough movie for Hollywood great James Cagney as Tom Powers. Edward Woods plays his partner Matt Doyle, supported by a sterling cast including Joan Blondell, Mae Clarke (uncredited), and Donald Cook.\n\nThe casting could have been somewhat different. Edward Woods was initially cast in the lead role of Tom Powers and James Cagney was Matt Doyle, but their roles were soon switched. Supporting actor Joan Blondell once recalled the time she overheard director William Wellman telling Cagney that \u201cNow, you\u2019re the lead, kid!\u201d. She said that Cagney\u2019s charisma was so outstanding that he had to be the lead.\n\nDespite the switch, Wellman never reshot the sequences of Tom and Matt as children, which is why Cagney\u2019s young character looks more like Woods and the other looks more like Cagney.\n\nUnlike those many Italian-themed gangster pictures throughout the years, The Public Enemy is more Irish. Some of the characters are Irish American, such as Powers, Doyle, Paddy Ryan. etc. A few of the lead actors were Irish Americans, such as James Cagney, Robert Emmett O\u2019 Connor (who plays Paddy Ryan), and Joan Blondell. James Cagney was even a member of an exclusive Irish American group affectionately called \u201cThe Irish Mafia\u201d.\n\nIt could be argued that the Irish are used as convenient scapegoats to represent organized crime groups for the bootlegging of alcohol, but similar arguments could be used against other gangster movies about their depictions of Italians and Italian culture.\n\nThe famous grapefruit scene\n\nNevertheless, The Public Enemy is splendidly directed (William Wellman), with a great script from Harvey F. Thew, Kubec Glasmon, and John Bright (based on Beer and Blood by Glasmon and Bright). The performances are top drawer, especially from the brilliant James Cagney, whose powerful performance as Tom Powers dominates every scene in the film.\n\nEdward Wood is excellent in support, although the talented Joan Blondell, who played Mamie, should probably be given a bigger role.\n\nThe uncredited Mae Clarke plays Tom Powers\u2019 girlfriend in the famous scene when Powers smashes grapefruit into her face. This scene was rehearsed, despite reports to the contrary. According to Clarke, the filmed scene was meant to be a joke and was not expected to appear in the film.\n\nLouise Brooks was meant to play Gwen Allen (which was eventually played by Jean Harlow). Brooks declined because she \u201chated Hollywood\u201d. It has been noted by some biographers that her refusal led to the end of Brooks\u2019 film career.\n\nJames Cagney\u2019s powerhouse performance in The Public Enemy enabled him to shine in a critically acclaimed film career. Cagney became unforgettable in other gangster classics, most notably Angels with Dirty Faces (1938), The Roaring Twenties (1939), and White Heat (1949). As a talented and experienced song and dance man, Cagney starred (alongside Joan Blondell) in the brilliant Busby Berkeley musical Footlight Parade (1932) and won an Oscar for his part as Irish American George K. Cohan in Yankee Doodle Dandy in 1942. However, it was Cagney\u2019s star turn in The Public Enemy that made the biggest impact and elevated this talented Irish American talent into a film legend.\n\nSelected in 1998 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \u201cculturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\u201d, The Public Enemy ranks alongside Little Caesar (1931), Scarface (1932), Angels with Dirty Faces (1938), and The Roaring Twenties (1939) as one of the best gangster movies of the decade and one of the finest ever made.\n\nThe Sopranos\n\nIn the second episode of the third season of acclaimed crime drama The Sopranos, Tony Soprano (Tony Gandolfini) watches sequences from The Public Enemy which fills him with emotion.\n\nJames Cagney and Samuel L. Jackson worked together!\n\nCagney\u2019s last film was a comeback after 20 years called Ragtime (1981) which was also Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s first film.

An all-talking Pre-Code gangster film by Warner Brothers, the film combines the talents of Director William A. Wellman, Producer Darryl F. Zanuck, Writers Kubec Glasmon and John Bright, and Cinematographer Devereaux Jennings.\n\nThe Public Enemy is based upon an unpublished novel called Beer and Blood, written by Bright and Glasmon. The two writers who founded their tale on actual individuals and events, as they had witnessed Al Capone\u2019s cruel gang rivalries in Chicago. In fact, James Cagney based his performance on Chicago gangster Charles Dion O\u2019Bannion and two New York City criminals he had known as a youth. As a further connection to the O\u2019Bannion reference, the rival gang in the film is led by \u201cSchemer Burns\u201d, an obvious reference to the real-life \u201cSchemer Drucci\u201d, who was part of the North Side Gang led by O\u2019Bannion.\n\nThe story captured the interest of Zanuck, who bought the rights to the novel and assigned Wellman to the project. Once the story was adapted to the screen by Harvey F. Thew, Wellman vowed to Zanuck that he would craft \u201cthe toughest, most violent picture\u201d imaginable.\n\nThe film follows the characters of Irish-Americans Tom Powers and Matt Doyle, who engage in petty theft in 1900s Chicago. Putty Nose persuades them to join his gang in a fur warehouse robbery, promising that he will take care of them if anything goes awry. When a nervous Powers shoots a stuffed bear, his gunshot alerts the police, who kill another gang member. Powers and Doyle soon find themselves committing murders and other crimes and become fully enmeshed in the gang\u2019s culture. Despite the pleas of Tom\u2019s brother and perfect foil, Mike Powers, Tom Powers leads a life of crime and rises in the ranks of the gang, meeting a broad cast of characters who either work to support him or conspire against him.\n\nPUBLIC ENEMY, James Cagney, Edward Woods, Robert Emmett O\u2019Connor, 1931\n\nInitially, Edward Woods was cast in the role of Powers and Cagney was cast in the role of Doyle. However, Wellman decided that the story would be more compelling if the two actors switched roles. Moreover, with the advances in the sound technology used in this film, the lead actor did not have to have perfect enunciation. Wellman never re-shot the sequences of the characters as small children, which explains why the child playing Cagney\u2019s role looks like Woods and vice versa.\n\nAs for Powers\u2019s love interest, Louise Brooks was originally slated to play Gwen Allen. When she refused the role, it went to younger actress, Jean Harlow. Brooks contended that she \u201chated Hollywood\u201d by the time she was offered the role. Turning down the role essentially marked the end of her film career.\n\nThe finalized cast list for this film was as follows:\n\nJames Cagney as Tom Powers\n\nJean Harlow as Gwen Allen\n\nEdward Woods as Matt Doyle\n\nJoan Blondell as Mamie\n\nDonald Cook as Mike Powers\n\nLeslie Fenton as Nails Nathan\n\nBeryl Mercer as Ma Powers\n\nRobert Emmett O\u2019Connor as Paddy Ryan\n\nMurray Kinnell as Putty Nose\n\nMae Clarke as Kitty (uncredited)\n\nFrank Coghlan Jr. as Tom as a Boy (uncredited)\n\nFrankie Darro as Matt as a Boy (uncredited)\n\nRobert Homans as Officer Pat Burke (uncredited)\n\nSam McDaniel as Headwaiter (uncredited)\n\nAside from the casting of the film, there are several notable moments and scenes in the film. Interestingly, the film features a prologue and an epilogue to comment upon the story.\n\nWhen filming began in January 1931 with a small budget of $151,000, Wellman sought authentic reactions from his cast members. The script, for example, called for a scene in which Mike Powers punches his brother, Tom. Prior to filming, Wellman took Donald Cook aside and asked him to really hit Cagney. Unfortunately, when Cook hit Cagney, he struck him in the mouth so hard that he broke one of Cagney\u2019s teeth. Despite his surprise and pain, Cagney remained in character and executed the remained of the scene. In another scene, live ammunition was used, with bullets striking the wall of a building in the place where Cagney\u2019s head had just been.\n\nOf course, one of the most notorious moments in this film is \u201cthe grapefruit scene,\u201d in which Cagney\u2019s character shoves a grapefruit in Kitty\u2019s (Mae Clarke\u2019s) face.\n\nSeveral versions exist of the origin of the notorious grapefruit scene, but the most plausible is the one on which both Cagney and Mae Clarke agreed: The scene, they explained, was actually staged as a practical joke at the expense of the film crew, just to see their stunned reactions. There was never any intention of ever using the shot in the completed film. Wellman, however, eventually decided to keep the shot, and use it in the film\u2019s final release print. Another version of the scene\u2019s origin is that that Wellman and his wife at the time would get into fights but she would never talk or give any expression. Since she always had a grapefruit for breakfast, he always wanted to put the grapefruit into her face just to get a reaction out of her, so she would show some emotion. As a result, he felt that this scene gave him the opportunity to rid himself of that temptation.\n\nReactions to this scene were mixed. For one, the infamous grapefruit scene caused women\u2019s groups around America to protest the on-screen abuse of Clarke. According to Cagney\u2019s autobiography, Clarke\u2019s ex-husband, Lew Brice, enjoyed the \u201cgrapefruit scene\u201d so much that he went to the movie theater every day just to watch that scene only and leave. As for Cagney, for years afterward when dining in restaurants, fellow patrons would send over grapefruit to Cagney, which Cagney would happily eat.\n\nThe Public Enemy was considered a success thanks to the performances of its talented cast. While the New York Times cited it as \u201cweaker than most in story\u201d and \u201cstronger than most in acting\u201d, Time magazine found the story to be very \u201cwell-told.\u201d The film was so popular that a theater in Times Square ran it 24 hours a day upon its initial release. Moreover, the film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Story but lost to The Dawn Patrol (1930).\n\nOnce the Production Code was put into effect, the film was re-released with three scenes cut from it due to violating the Code\u2019s regulations. One scene included Powers being measured for a suit by an effeminate tailor. The second portrayed Doyle and his girlfriend rolling around in bed. Finally, the third depicted Powers being seduced when hiding in a woman\u2019s apartment. All three of these scenes are restored on the current DVD and Blu-ray releases of the film.\n\nToday, The Public Enemy has been preserved by the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress and was ranked 8th best in the gangster film genre by the American Film Institute\u2019s list of the Top 10 Gangster Films in 2008. In 1989, an animatronic version of a scene from The Public Enemy was incorporated into The Great Movie Ride at the Disney-MGM Studios theme park in Orlando, Florida. When the ride made its debut, Cagney\u2019s family was unhappy with his apparel in the gangster scene in the ride\u2019s tribute to Public Enemy (1931). In response, they gave the Imagineers one of Cagney\u2019s actual tuxedos to improve his appearance, even though he did not wear a tuxedo in the movie scene. The Great Movie Ride closed on August 13, 2017.\n\nWhile Cagney went on to act in many more films within this genre and beyond, his performance in The Public Enemy offered an iconic moment in his career.\n\nThis post is part of Hometowns to Hollywood\u2019s blogathon, entitled \u201cThe Hollywood Gangsters Blogathon.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/the-public-enemy-gangster-james-cagney-90-years/", "page_content": "Both Little Caesar and The Public Enemy earned their street cred, defying the then-toothless 1930 Motion Picture Production Code, which preceded the Hays Code. After New York censors cut six scenes from The Public Enemy to clear it for release, the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) set further guidelines for the proper cinematic depiction of crime.\n\nPublic Enemy director Wellman was an expert in multiple genres. He spit out biting satires like Nothing Sacred (1937) and Roxie Hart (1942), and captured gritty, dark realities in The Ox-Bow Incident (1943) and Story of G.I. Joe (1945). He won his only Oscar for A Star Is Born (1937). The Public Enemy is the first example of what would be his trademark: stylish cinematography and clever camera-work. The dark suspense he captures is completely different from the look of German expressionism. It captured the overcast shadows of urban reality and would influence the look of later noir films. His main character would inspire generations of actors.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just like you, Tom Powers. You\u2019re the meanest boy in town.\u201d\n\nOrson Welles lauded James Cagney as \u201cmaybe the greatest actor who ever appeared in front of a camera.\u201d Will Rogers said watching Cagney perform was \u201clike a bunch of firecrackers going off all at once.\u201d The New York City born performer explodes in this movie. Even in black and white, Cagney\u2019s red hair flares through the air like sulfur on a match. It turns out to be a slow burn, which will reach its ultimate climax in 1949\u2019s White Heat. The Public Enemy is loaded with top talent, but you can\u2019t take your eyes off Cagney. Not even for a second. You might miss some tiny detail, like the flash of a grin, a wink, or a barely perceptible glare.\n\nCagney had a simple rule to acting: All you had to do was to look the other person straight in the eyes and say your lines. \u201cBut mean them.\u201d In The Public Enemy, the characters communicate without lines. When Tom and Matt Doyle (Edward Woods) sneak a peek into Larry the Limp\u2019s casket, we understand this is the first time the two young thugs lost someone their own age. The scene barely implies how fortunate they are not to be in that box, but their curiosity is as palpable as the loss of their last shred of innocence.\n\nCagney was originally cast as Matt, and scenes were shot with him in the role. The parts were switched mid-production, but they didn\u2019t reshoot the flashback scenes, making it look like the pair swapped bodies between 1909 and 1915. It\u2019s a shame because Frankie Darro, who plays the young Matt, made a career out of playing baby face Cagney, and later joined the East Side Kids franchise.\n\nFormer \u201cOur Gang\u201d actor Frank Coghlan Jr. took on the role of young Tom. He takes the lashes from his cop father\u2019s belt, backtalking him the whole time. Tom Powers is reprehensible. He never says thank you and doesn\u2019t shake hands. He delights in the violence and sadism. Powers doesn\u2019t go into crime because of poverty; he just can\u2019t be contained. Cagney\u2019s mobster mangles, manhandles, maims and murders, and still needs more room in his inseam."}, {"url": "http://www.frenchfilms.org/review/the-public-enemy-1931.html", "page_content": "Film Review\n\nT he Public Enemy\n\nbefore\n\nThe Public Enemy\n\nThe Public Enemy\n\nThe Public Enemy\n\nBeer and Blood\n\nThe Public Enemy\n\nThe Public Enemy\n\nThe Public Enemy\n\n\u00a9 James Travers 2008\n\nThe above content is owned by frenchfilms.org and must not be copied.\n\nNext William A.

In fact, according to the Library of Congress, the musical fantasy is the most-watched picture in history.\n\nBut how did the film fare at the box office and with critics when it came out in 1939?\n\n\u201c\u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 was a moneymaker for its time,\u201d noted William Stillman, co-author of \u201cThe Wizardry of Oz: The Artistry and Magic of the 1939 M-G-M Classic,\u201d by email. \u201cBut with the average national ticket prices at 25 cents (more than half of its audiences were juvenile patrons who paid a dime or 15 cents), it was not expected to recoup its $3 million in production and promotion costs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVIDEO REVIEW: \u2018Oz the Great and Powerful\u2019\n\nRemember, film historian Scott Essman says, movies in those days were \u201cvery ephemeral.\u201d There wasn\u2019t any TV or DVD on which to extend their life, he points out, so \u201cthey came and they went, and that was it.\u201d\n\nThe initial reviews for \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d were mostly positive, Stillman said, with some comparing it favorably to the first full-length animated feature, Walt Disney\u2019s \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\u201d That 1937 release, he said, had inspired MGM to put \u201cOz\u201d on a production fast track. He said critics also singled out the performances, particularly Garland\u2019s and Lahr\u2019s, as exceptional.\n\nBut not everyone was enchanted. Some critics thought MGM was trying to impinge on Disney\u2019s territory, Stillman said, while those who loved L. Frank Baum\u2019s Oz book series were not happy with the film\u2019s modern touches, such as the Wicked Witch of the West\u2019s sky-writing \u201cSurrender Dorothy\u201d above the Emerald City on her broomstick.\n\n\u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d was nominated for six Academy Awards, including best film, winning Oscars for original score for Herbert Stothart and best song for \u201cOver the Rainbow,\u201d composed by Harold Arlen with lyrics by E.Y. Harburg.\n\nThe film was re-released in 1949 and 1955, \u201cby which time Garland had become an internationally recognized entertainer,\u201d Stillman said. \u201cThe film\u2019s all-American theme of solidarity, preservation of home and vanquishing of evil forces resonated with audiences in patriotic postwar 1949 and it recouped its initial losses and turned a profit.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Scenes from \u2018Oz the Great and Powerful\u2019\n\nBut the movie really gained iconic status when CBS aired it for the first time on Nov. 3, 1956. \u201cIt changed the whole nature of that movie,\u201d Essman said. \u201cIt became an event to see this film.\u201d\n\n\u201cBert Lahr, who had last seen \u2018Oz\u2019 at its 1939 premiere, introduced the program, assisted by Judy\u2019s daughter, Liza Minnelli,\u201d Stillman said. \u201cThe original 1956 broadcast was a huge success, drawing 45 million viewers.\u201d\n\nThe network didn\u2019t air it again until 1959. Hosted by Red Skelton and airing at an earlier hour \u2014 the first broadcast was at 9 p.m. \u2014 it attracted even more viewers.\n\n\u201cA new contract between CBS and MGM was negotiated for a third airing, and subsequent showings established \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 as an annual \u2018special event,\u201d\u2019 said Stillman.\n\nThe movie aired over the decades on CBS and NBC. After Turner Entertainment bought the MGM library, the film is now shown on TBS, TNT and TCM.\n\nAre you an aficionado of iconic Hollywood?

When her house is suddenly whisked away by a tornado, she ends up in the mythical land of Oz, where scarecrows talk, trees have faces, and there are such things as good witches and bad witches.

But what\u2019s missing, of course, from Frank Baum\u2019s bestselling novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, is the music that helped make those characters so beloved and those plot points so familiar. First published in 1900, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was adapted numerous times for the stage and screen and even set to music prior to 1939. It was that year\u2019s film adaptation, however, that earned Baum\u2019s work a permanent place not only in cinema history, but also in music history.\n\nLyricist Yip Harburg and composer Harold Arlen were both seasoned songwriting professionals before teaming up in 1938 to write the original songs for The Wizard of Oz, though they had worked together very little. Harburg\u2019s best-known credits to date were \u201cBrother, Can You Spare A Dime?\u201d (1931) and \u201cIt\u2019s Only A Paper Moon\u201d (1933), and Arlen\u2019s were \u201cGet Happy\u201d (1929) and \u201cStormy Weather\u201d (1933). Their first collaboration was on the Broadway musical Hooray For What! (1937), which yielded the now-standard \u201cDown With Love.\u201d The success of The Wizard of Oz, however, would quickly overshadow those earlier accomplishments.\n\nNot only did Judy Garland\u2019s signature song, \u201cOver The Rainbow,\u201d earn Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg the Oscar for Best Song at the 1940 Academy Awards, but it quickly became an indispensable standard in the American Songbook, later being acknowledged as the #1 song on the \u201cSongs of the Century\u201d list compiled in 2001 by the Recording Industry Association of America and the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nFirst and foremost, however, Arlen and Harburg\u2019s songs accomplished their primary goal with flying colors, carrying and deepening the emotional impact of the story in the film for which they were written. As innovative and impressive as the production values of The Wizard of Oz were in 1939, it is impossible to imagine the film earning the place it has in the popular imagination without songs like \u201cThe Lollipop Guild,\u201d \u201cIf I Only Had A Brain\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re Off To See The Wizard.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Judy's Garland's Stiff Competition for the Role of Dorothy in 'The Wizard of Oz'"}, {"url": "https://www.historytoday.com/archive/months-past/premiere-wizard-oz", "page_content": "Premiered at Grauman\u2019s Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, The Wizard of Oz was one of the best-loved Hollywood films ever made. It was the most expensive movie Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had produced to date and it made an international star of Judy Garland, who had begun life with the not wildly glamorous name of Frances Gumm, but endowed with a compelling singing voice. MGM signed her aged 13 in 1935 and did its utmost to pretend that she was still a young teenager when she played the role of the film\u2019s 12-year-old heroine, Dorothy Gale, who with her dog Toto is blown away by a whirlwind to Oz in Munchkin Land. Following the yellow brick road to find the Wizard of Oz, who she hopes will use his magic to send her home, she falls in with the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion (played by Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr, respectively), who also need the Wizard\u2019s help. The travellers are welcomed to Munchkin Land by its inhabitants, the Munchkins, played by an assortment of dwarfs. The Wizard turns out to be a fake and Dorothy eventually returns home by clapping her hands three times and saying \u2018There\u2019s no place like home\u2019.\n\nWork on the film started in 1938. The producer was Mervyn LeRoy and the principal director Victor Fleming. The script, by many different writers, was based on a novel written for children years before by Frank Baum. The songs had music by Harold Arlen and words by E.Y. Harburg. Besides \u2018Somewhere Over the Rainbow\u2019, which won an Academy Award and which Judy Garland would have to sing to audiences on demand for years, the songs included \u2018We\u2019re Off to See the Wizard\u2019 and \u2018Follow the Yellow Brick Road\u2019.\n\nSadly, there was to be no place like home for Garland herself. Her life was a miserable progression through mental problems, addiction to alcohol and drugs, failed relationships, suicide attempts and desperate unhappiness until death freed her when she was 47 in 1969."}, {"url": "https://theconversation.com/wizard-of-oz-why-this-extraordinary-movie-has-been-so-influential-108098", "page_content": "Film director Joel Coen \u2013 one half of the famed Coen Brothers \u2013 once quipped that \u201cevery movie ever made is an attempt to remake The Wizard of Oz\u201d \u2013 and while, strictly speaking, there\u2019s a bit of artistic licence in this statement, it seems that the tale of Dorothy\u2019s adventure on the Yellow Brick Road can reasonably lay clam to being the most influential movie of all time.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s the finding of researchers in Turin, Italy, who took a database of 47,000 films and cross-referenced them to determine which film has had the greatest influence on the industry, based on the number of times it has been referenced in other films. The winner was the 1939 film, The Wizard of Oz.\n\nSome members of the popular press seem surprised by this fact; but they really shouldn\u2019t be. Indeed, the research \u2013 which was published in Applied Network Science \u2013 only seems to have looked for direct references to the film. But if you also took account of films that were influenced by The Wizard of Oz without directly referencing it, there would hundreds, if not thousands more titles to add to the list.\n\nThe Coen Brothers are not the only big names to pay homage to the Wizard of Oz (their films are full of sly references). Derek Jarman, who is about as far away from the Hollywood archetype as you can get, also called it his favourite film. For Joel Coen, the film\u2019s brilliance probably lies in its elegant narrative structure \u2013 whereas for Jarman it has a lot to do with its design. But this is a testament to how good the film really is. Film is a highly collaborative art form and the contributions made by every department to this film \u2013 photography, set, costume, music, editing and cast \u2013 is immaculate. Indeed, to watch The Wizard of Oz is to watch the Hollywood studio machine working at the very peak of its efficiency.\n\nDreams and reality\n\nAs far as I am concerned, The Wizard of Oz has exerted the most profound influence on filmmakers around the world who refuse to see the cinema as a realist medium, but rather view it as the art form that comes closest to our dreams. In The Wizard of Oz, reality \u2013 as represented by Kansas \u2013 is literally colourless. What\u2019s worse, it\u2019s not the beautiful black and white one might expect from a Hollywood film of the period. Instead it\u2019s doubly drab sepia.\n\nBut once we enter the Land of Oz we are plunged into a world of vivid Technicolor and extraordinary painted sets that make no attempt to hide their artifice. Even the cloyingly sentimental return to Kansas in the final few minutes cannot hide the true message: the imagination is far more interesting that reality can ever be.\n\nIn this celebration of the dream life, The Wizard of Oz is a truly surrealist work.\n\nRoad movie tradition\n\nIt should come as no surprise then that one of the finest riffs on the film comes from the doyen of American surrealist filmmakers, David Lynch. His 1991 Palm d\u2019Or winner, Wild at Heart, belongs to the great American tradition of the road movie, a genre which Lynch (quite rightly) traces back to The Wizard of Oz.\n\nBut Lynch does not simply acknowledge the debt; rather he takes the plot of Barry Gifford\u2019s short, spare and ultimately realist novel and litters it with references to the 1939 film. In Wild at Heart, characters say things like \u201ctoo bad he can\u2019t just visit that old Wizard of Oz and get some advice\u201d, or \u201cseems we sort of broke down on the yellow brick road\u201d, without a hint of irony. They also have visions of the Wicked Witch of the West and get life lessons from Glenda the Good Witch.\n\nThere is more to these allusions than a mere doffing of the cap, however. The references to The Wizard of Oz serve as a reminder of how America has changed. Almost all of Lynch\u2019s protagonists are innocents who find themselves in a strange and often perilous world \u2013 just like Dorothy. But while Dorothy is able to maintain her innocence, Sailor and Lula, the central couple in Wild at Heart, fail to do so in world that\u2019s \u201cwild at heart and weird on top\u201d.\n\nHeaven and hell\n\nPerhaps the most extraordinary nod to The Wizard of Oz comes from closer to home. A Matter of Life and Death was a fantasy film written, produced and directed by the team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger in 1946. Commissioned during the final months of World War II to help mend the strained relationship between the British and their American allies, the film is set in two realms: Earth and heaven (which may or may not be a figment of a the imagination of a bomber pilot with brain trauma).\n\nFollowing the lead of The Wizard of Oz, Powell and Pressburger decided to distinguish between these two realms by shooting one in Technicolor and the other in monochrome (essentially black and white produced by undyed Technicolor film). The real stroke of genius, however, was to invert the early film\u2019s pattern and to present the real world in colour and the imaginary one in monochrome.\n\nFilmmakers, audiences and critics alike have generally accepted the paradox that the real world may be in colour, but on film black and white is more realistic \u2013 so by showing heaven in monochrome, Powell and Pressburger seem to be telling us that our imagination is more real than the real world.\n\nSuch a bold and subversive gesture would have been unthinkable, however, had the The Wizard of Oz not come before and showed filmmakers the imaginative possibilities of the medium."}, {"url": "https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-wizard-of-oz-1939", "page_content": "If \u201cWizard\u201d began in one way and continued in another, that was also the history of the production. Richard Thorpe, the original director, was fired after 12 days. George Cukor filled in for three days, long enough to tell Judy Garland to lose the wig and the makeup, and then Victor Fleming took over. When Fleming went to \u201cGone With the Wind,\u201d King Vidor did some of the Munchkin sequences, and the Kansas scenes.\n\nThere were cast changes, too; after Buddy Ebsen, as the Tin Man, had an allergic reaction to the silvery makeup, he was replaced by Jack Haley. Musical numbers were recorded and never used. Margaret Hamilton (the Wicked Witch of the West) was seriously burned when she went up in a puff of smoke. Even Toto was out of commission for two weeks after being stepped on by a crewmember.\n\nWe study all of these details, I think, because \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d fills such a large space in our imagination. It somehow seems real and important in a way most movies don't. Is that because we see it first when we\u2019re young? Or simply because it is a wonderful movie? Or because it sounds some buried universal note, some archetype or deeply felt myth?\n\nI lean toward the third possibility, that the elements in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d powerfully fill a void that exists inside many children. For kids of a certain age, home is everything, the center of the world. But over the rainbow, dimly guessed at, is the wide earth, fascinating and terrifying. There is a deep fundamental fear that events might conspire to transport the child from the safety of home and strand him far away in a strange land. And what would he hope to find there? Why, new friends, to advise and protect him. And Toto, of course, because children have such a strong symbiotic relationship with their pets that they assume they would get lost together.\n\nThis deep universal appeal explains why so many different people from many backgrounds have a compartment of their memory reserved for \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d Salman Rushdie, growing up in Bombay, remembers that seeing the film at 10 \u201cmade a writer of me.\u201d Terry McMillan, as an African-American child in northern Michigan, \u201ccompletely identified when no one had time to listen to Dorothy.\u201d Rushdie wrote that the film's \u201cdriving force is the inadequacy of adults, even of good adults, and how the weakness of grownups forces children to take control of their own destinies.\u201d McMillan learned about courage, about \u201cbeing afraid but doing whatever it was you set out to do anyway.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/17/how-the-world-fell-under-the-spell-of-the-wizard-of-oz", "page_content": "Eighty years ago, in the summer of 1939, 16-year-old Judy Garland appeared on cinema screens as the orphan Dorothy Gale, dreaming of escape from bleak, monochrome Kansas. \u201cFind yourself a place where you won\u2019t get into any trouble,\u201d her aunt beseeches, too busy for poor old Dorothy, who soon breaks into song: \u201cSomewhere, over the rainbow, skies are blue / And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true\u201d. Her wish is soon granted by a tornado that carries her to the gaudy, Technicolor Land of Oz, instilling her as an icon for misfits, migrants, gay kids, dreamers \u2013 anyone who has ever wanted to run away.\n\nMore than 40 years later, The Wizard of Oz was one of the first films I watched as a toddler in Rio de Janeiro, on my dad\u2019s Super 8 projector. My parents were already dreaming of their own escape to London, where we would go a few years later. They hadn\u2019t been born when the film was released, a few days before the start of the second world war, though by then my mother\u2019s Jewish parents were building a life in Rio, their own Oz, far away from Poland \u2013 a land that would turn out to be far bleaker than Kansas. My grandparents were homesick, not quite settled, for the rest of their lives. Unlike Dorothy, they couldn\u2019t click their heels together and magic themselves back. Home didn\u2019t exist any more; it was a memory, an idea, a receptacle for feelings of loss.\n\nEveryone has their own Oz. For my parents, it was Europe; I begged to go back to Brazil\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to guess how many times I\u2019ve watched The Wizard of Oz. Fifty? A hundred? When we came to London, I couldn\u2019t speak English and had no friends, but the film kept me company along with Mary Poppins, An American in Paris, West Side Story, reruns of The Muppet Show, musical dreamworlds I could escape to whenever I wanted. But The Wizard of Oz was The One. We had it on VHS, recorded from TV, but the tape ran out of space shortly after Dorothy returns to Kansas, so it was only years later that I heard her final words: \u201cOh, Auntie Em \u2013 there\u2019s no place like home!\u201d The empty lure of escape, the fantasy of an eternal home and perfect belonging: this is what The Wizard of Oz means to me. Dorothy is an orphan, but who are her parents? In the entire film, they are not mentioned once. Perhaps it does not matter who they are. Like many fictional orphans, from Oliver Twist to Harry Potter, Dorothy is a symbol of loss and abandonment, while Kansas v Oz is the battle we all fight between reality and fantasy, home and elsewhere.\n\nEveryone has their own Oz, be it fame, money or love; but for immigrants, it is usually an actual place. For my Jewish grandparents, it was anywhere but Europe; for my parents, it was Europe; while my siblings and I begged to go back to Brazil. For Iris Cohen, the protagonist of my second novel, Everything You Ever Wanted, Oz is the planet Nyx, a meaningful new life far from Earth from which there is no return. I didn\u2019t realise I was writing an immigration novel until I had finished the first draft, but I knew early on that Iris was my Dorothy.\n\nStrange worlds \u2026 Laura Harring and Justin Theroux in David Lynch\u2019s Mulholland Drive (2001). Photograph: Allstar/Universal\n\nIn all of western cinema, is there a more recognisable image than Dorothy in her blue gingham dress, arm in arm with the Scarecrow, the Lion and the Tin Man, skipping down the yellow brick road to the Emerald City, so that the Wizard can fulfil their dreams? It\u2019s somehow cheering that this chaotic, surreal musical about a teenage girl, her dog and her three weird friends running away from a witch, searching for a wizard, and trying to become their best selves is so influential. And surprising, too, considering that it was a troubled production and a box office flop, with a script that breaks the first rule of storytelling by having an ending that suggests it was all just a dream. (Or was it? More importantly, does it matter?) The film was based on L Frank Baum\u2019s book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but ultimately superseded it. Several directors signed up and quit in quick succession. Victor Fleming is named in the credits, but he decamped after a few months to work on Gone With the Wind, which won 10 Oscars to The Wizard of Oz\u2019s two. But who is still watching Gone With the Wind in 2019?\n\nMy novel is the latest in a long history of Oz homages, particularly in the magical, surreal and queer corners of culture. They range from Elton John\u2019s album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road to the Coen brothers\u2019 O Brother, Where Art Thou?, which owes as much to Oz as it does to Homer\u2019s Odyssey. Joel Coen once said: \u201cEvery movie ever made is an attempt to remake The Wizard of Oz.\u201d In his 1992 essay about Fleming\u2019s film, Salman Rushdie describes it as his \u201cvery first literary influence\u201d. It was one of Derek Jarman\u2019s favourite movies, and among the first he ever saw. (This is the key to its influence: the fact that everyone watches it in childhood. It seeps into your unconscious and stays there.) And there are the spin-offs, sequels and prequels \u2013 The Wiz, Return to Oz, Oz the Great and Powerful, Wicked.\n\nFantasies of belonging \u2026 Luiza Sauma. Photograph: Tim Goalen\n\nPerhaps no other artist pays tribute to The Wizard of Oz as frequently and with as much reverence as David Lynch. His best loved works, including Twin Peaks, Mulholland Drive and Blue Velvet, all follow ordinary people into strange, beguiling other worlds; they contain an Oz-like mix of innocence, surreality and nightmarish darkness. Wild at Heart is a more obvious homage, with its visions of good and bad witches, and frequent mentions of the film. At one point, Laura Dern even clicks her red shoes together.\n\nTony Kushner\u2019s two-part play Angels in America, a hallucinatory epic about Aids, identity and alienation in 1980s New York, also alludes several times to the film. Like Dorothy, its protagonist, Prior, is a lonely young person who achieves glory through fantasy; he dreams of being a prophet, just as Dorothy dreams of being a heroine. During a dream, Prior echoes her classic line: \u201cPeople come and go so quickly here!\u201d Or perhaps it isn\u2019t a dream, and he is a prophet after all. Both Lynch and Kushner understand that the line between reality and fantasy, between Kansas and Oz, is not as impermeable as it seems. The flowers in Munchkinland might look like plastic, but Kansas is just as fake, an obvious sound stage with a painted-prairie backdrop.\n\nI recently rewatched The Wizard of Oz for the first time in years, with my baby sleeping on my lap. The film is so familiar to me that I assumed I wouldn\u2019t find anything new, but of course I was wrong. The Wizard himself is even more clueless and narcissistic than I remembered: he is a corrupt politician, catnip for lost souls. Garland\u2019s rendition of \u201cOver the Rainbow\u201d is so moving and bittersweet from the vantage point of adulthood, now that my dreams of escape \u2013 from London and from myself \u2013 have been laid to rest. The empty, snickering evil of the Wicked Witch of the West is scarier than anything I\u2019ve seen in recent children\u2019s films. The Wizard of Oz doesn\u2019t sugar-coat the truth: there are monsters out there, and the only things that matter are fellowship and home, wherever you find them \u2013 a message as relevant now as it was in 1939."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/movies/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/wizard-oz", "page_content": "THE WIZARD OF OZ\n\nUSA, 1939\n\nDirector: Victor Fleming\n\nProduction: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures Corp.; Technicolor (opening and closing sequences in black and white), 35mm; running time: 101 minutes.

Produced and distributed by MGM at a cost of $2.5 million, the film is a tribute to the Hollywood style and system of filmmaking. It was a bit of \"wonderworking\" indeed, as this fantasy film would forever alter the course of the Hollywood film musical.\n\nBegun in 1938, The Wizard of Oz was produced at the apex of the classic Hollywood era, when MGM had at its disposal the foremost technical experts available in Hollywood at that time. It was this standby of talent that made the production of a film like Wizard feasible. To mount such a project today would cost at least $50 million. Ray Bolger (the Scarecrow), then a contract player at MGM, explains: \"Working at MGM during that period was the ultimate in motion picture making, musical or otherwise.\"\n\nWizard was photographed in a little-used three-strip technicolor process. In this process, three separate strips of black-and-white film were exposed through a prism which segregated the three primary colors. It was an extremely intricate process to handle and required enormous amounts of light to properly expose. While it was the most expensive process available to Hollywood at the time, it yielded an unequaled color quality. The studio chose the three-strip process because it worked out well with black-and-white stock. The framing of Dorothy's fantasy was processed in black-and-white, heightening the effect of the technicolor journey to Oz. The fact that the three-strip process originated in a black-and-white stock made this easier.\n\nFor these reasons the production of Wizard occurred entirely indoors on the sound stages of MGM. Because the film was studio-bound, a lot of responsibility fell on the special effects department. Mattes were used extensively to give depth to the Kansas landscape, and a sense of distance to the Land of Oz. Intricate trick photography was employed to allow a bicyclist and a man rowing a boat to float helplessly in a tornado.\n\nNo less important was the MGM art department. It was headed at the time by Cedric Gibbons whose career garnered 11 Academy Awards while at MGM. Elaborate sets were conceived and constructed in full scale to create Oz, the Wicked Witch's sanctuary, and the throne room of the Wizard of Oz. Working with the limitations imposed by the tri-color film process, Gibbon's department had to create a color scheme that the film stock could exploit. The result was a beautiful, color-conscious mise-en-sc\u00e8ne.\n\nPerhaps most miraculous was the role played by Jack Dawn and the MGM makeup department. It was Dawn's task to take three nonhumans\u2014a scarecrow, a tin man, and a lion\u2014and bring them to life. He had to give them personalities and human characteristics that would evoke an humanity amidst the costumes dictated by their roles. This was done convincingly, resulting in three of the most elaborate makeup/costume designs to date in Hollywood: the costumes did pose certain critical problems for production, however. Bert Lahr's costume for the Cowardly Lion, for instance, weighed nearly 100 pounds. This, coupled with the intense heat caused by the lighting needed to shoot, made filming for long durations impossible, and the film had to be shot in segments with a day's shooting often ending before a scene was complete. As a result, before the next day's shooting could begin, makeup had to be meticulously matched and perfectly recreated to retain consistency. Daily rushes were used to aid this process. While this precision slowed down the production, the commitment to perfection became a trademark of MGM.\n\nFor their efforts both Jack Dawn and Cedric Gibbons received Academy Award nominations (though Gibbon's contract insured that his name would appear in the credits of all MGM films regardless of his involvement). This recognition, while falling on individuals, was no less a tribute to the system. It was a recognition of the elaborate collaborative nature of Hollywood filmmaking.\n\nThough Wizard remains an elaborate technical achievement for its time, the technology involved has since become obsolete. Perhaps the longterm contribution of the film is the precedent it set for the type of Hollywood musical identified with MGM. Wizard was perhaps the earliest example of what came to be called the \"integrated musical.\" Traditionally, music in films had been incorporated in a performance setting, establishing logical moments in which to include musical numbers, such as the review films of the thirties, including Golddiggers and Forty-Second Street. In The Wizard of Oz the music became another dimension of the characters' language, an extension of their personalities and feelings. There is no intrinsic logic in Dorothy's singing \"Somewhere Over The Rainbow,\" but it is understood as a viable expression of some inner longing. The film narrative is advanced by musical numbers. Songs often replace dialogue as when the Munchkins pay tribute to Dorothy for killing their nemesis, the Wicked Witch of the East. In Wizard, music isn't a digression, but instead a fundamental part of the narrative structure.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz has witnessed more than 20 years of revival on both television and in theaters, remaining widely popular. Internationally, the film has enjoyed wider distribution than any other American film in history\u2014fantasy, musical or otherwise. It would seem that the directness of the film's message\u2014\"There's no place like home\"\u2014and the sincerity of its presentation is the key. However, beneath the fantasy is one of the most polished and elaborate productions ever mounted in Hollywood. The film remains a reminder of that as well.\n\n\u2014Robert Winning"}]}
