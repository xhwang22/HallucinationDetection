He has performed as trumpet player and arranged music for Stan Kenton (early 1970s), Bill Watrous, Bill Berry, Frank Capp \u2013 Nat Pierce (Juggernaut Big Band), and the Full Faith and Credit Big Band.\n\nBrown joined Kenton in September 1971, succeeding Gary Lee Pack [b. 1950; Director of Jazz Studies (retired), University of Southern Maine], holding the jazz trumpet chair and serving as an improv clinician. The Kenton trumpet section included Mike Vax, Jay Saunders, and Dennis Noday. Brown also contributed arrangements for Kenton, including \"Mi Burrito\" and \"Neverbird.\" Brown remained with the Kenton Orchestra until November 1972.\n\nBefore joining the Kenton Orchestra, Brown had served as arranger and trumpeter with the Studio Band of The United States Army Field Band at Fort Meade, Maryland (1968\u201371). His tenure with the Army Band and Kenton coincided closely with that of Jay Saunders \u2014 trumpet player, and jazz educator, who, while with the Kenton Orchestra, eventually played lead trumpet.\n\nBrown also has performed with Mundell Lowe, Leroy Vinnegar, Ray Brown (jazz double-bassist), Thad Jones, Jimmy Heath, Steve Gadd, and Billy Hart.\n\nBrown conducted the recording session of the Roy Hargrove Quintet entitled Roy Hargrove with Strings, Moment to Moment, released May 2000 on Verve.

However, what exactly is the role of these engineers after their induction?\n\nThe National Academy of Engineering elects members to its organization after a year-long process, meaning that Musk got a nomination last year and got his vote over 2021 as well. The role here is that they are a part of the organization contributing to engineering as leaders of their respective fields.\n\nElon Musk and Engineering\n\nElon Musk is, first and foremost, an engineer, and he brings a lot of projects to his company that focuses its research and development on delivering innovations to the world. Musk is known for his role in leading the project for the Tesla Bot, the autonomous AI-powered robot that features human-like qualities that the company intends to be an assistant to everyday work.\n\nThe CEO is famous online for engaging with fans for their everyday questions and queries about the products of the many companies which Musk is a part of and leads. There are also questions he answers regarding SpaceX and its many technologies that the public witnesses, especially with the Starship project to launch soon.\n\nHowever, Musk can be rendered speechless for questions that are too complex for him.\n\nMusk is an engineer and a businessman who engaged in many companies and projects, which helped him become who he is now. Because of his background as an engineer, he was able to launch these companies and help in their development as he understood what was going on in the ground or process.\n\nThe National Academy of Engineering's induction of the CEO is fitting for his role on SpaceX.\n\nRelated Article: Elon Musk Thanks Online Petition After President Biden Acknowledged Tesla as Largest EV Manufacturer\n\nThis article is owned by TechTimes\n\nWritten by Isaiah Richard\n\n\u24d2 2023 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

Brown to its ranks, putting him among the few who hold membership in the three major U.S. scientific academies.\n\nBrown, the Warren Zapol Professor of Anaesthesia at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Medical Engineering and Computational Neuroscience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2014 and the Institute of Medicine in 2007. His National Academy of Engineering appointment was announced this month.\n\nBrown, who is also co-director of the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, is an anesthesiologist and statistician studying the neurophysiology of anesthesia and developing signal-processing algorithms to analyze neuroscience data. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree from Harvard in 1978, a master\u2019s in statistics in 1984, a Ph.D in statistics in 1988, and an M.D. from HMS in 1987.\n\nBrown, who leads the Neuroscience Statistics Research Lab at MGH, said that key aspects of general anesthesia have changed little since its discovery. It is still commonly maintained by drugs derived from ether. The patient is in a physiologically stable state, yet unconscious, insensitive to pain, immobile, and wakes up with no memory of what occurred during surgery.\n\nNow nearly 170 years since anesthesia\u2019s first use, Brown\u2019s neuroscience studies are giving a clear picture of how anesthetics produce altered states of arousal and sensation. The drugs maintain powerful oscillations in brain circuits that disrupt normal information transmission and communication. A better understanding of general anesthesia and the brain, he said, will help anesthesiologists more precisely monitor and control patients\u2019 altered states, and actively hasten return to normal brain function rather than just waiting for anesthetic effects to wear off, as is the practice now.\n\nThere is also evidence that older brains don\u2019t recover from anesthesia as well as younger ones, and there are questions about its impact on brain development in babies and toddlers who have to undergo repeated surgeries. Both ends of the age spectrum can be helped by a deeper understanding of how anesthetics work, he said, and by developing new monitoring and anesthetic approaches.\n\nBrown is also working on understanding how the brain transmits and processes information in order to design new brain-controlled prosthetic devices and new treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders.\n\nBrown said his election to three national academies reflects the interdisciplinary nature of his work. He began thinking about how to bridge the worlds of statistics and medicine as an undergraduate studying applied math. He entered Harvard\u2019s M.D./Ph.D. program as the first to pursue a doctoral degree in statistics for the program\u2019s Ph.D. portion.\n\n\u201cI trained as an interdisciplinary person. That\u2019s why [my work] crosses different areas,\u201d Brown said.\n\nBrown is the first African-American to be named to all three academies, a data point in the current national discussion on academic achievements by African Americans. He received a congratulatory email out of the blue from a Nigerian student studying electrical engineering in Korea \u2014 an indication, Brown said, that our lives can have an impact that we don\u2019t expect.\n\n\u201cIt shows that these achievements are attainable by underrepresented groups as well,\u201d Brown said.\n\nAs for the future, Brown said he has plenty of scientific questions to keep him busy.\n\n\u201cIt is a very exciting time. I hope we can change the way people receive anesthesia care,\u201d Brown said."}], "Raymond Harry Brown was also a member of the National Academy of Sciences.": [{"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/raymond-harry-brown/", "page_content": "Raymond Harry \"Ray\" Brown (born November 7, 1946) is an American composer, arranger, trumpet player, and jazz educator. He has performed as trumpet player and arranged music for Stan Kenton (early 1970s), Bill Watrous, Bill Berry, Frank Capp \u2013 Nat Pierce (Juggernaut Big Band), and the Full Faith and Credit Big Band.\n\nBrown joined Kenton in September 1971, succeeding Gary Lee Pack [b. 1950; Director of Jazz Studies (retired), University of Southern Maine], holding the jazz trumpet chair and serving as an improv clinician. The Kenton trumpet section included Mike Vax, Jay Saunders, and Dennis Noday. Brown also contributed arrangements for Kenton, including \"Mi Burrito\" and \"Neverbird.\" Brown remained with the Kenton Orchestra until November 1972.\n\nBefore joining the Kenton Orchestra, Brown had served as arranger and trumpeter with the Studio Band of The United States Army Field Band at Fort Meade, Maryland (1968\u201371). His tenure with the Army Band and Kenton coincided closely with that of Jay Saunders \u2014 trumpet player, and jazz educator, who, while with the Kenton Orchestra, eventually played lead trumpet.\n\nBrown also has performed with Mundell Lowe, Leroy Vinnegar, Ray Brown (jazz double-bassist), Thad Jones, Jimmy Heath, Steve Gadd, and Billy Hart.\n\nBrown conducted the recording session of the Roy Hargrove Quintet entitled Roy Hargrove with Strings, Moment to Moment, released May 2000 on Verve.

Membership is a widely accepted mark of excellence in science and is considered one of the highest honors that a scientist can receive. Current NAS membership totals approximately 2,400 members and 500 international members, of which approximately 190 have received Nobel prizes.\n\nBecoming a Member\n\nBecause membership is achieved by election, there is no membership application process. Although many names are suggested informally, only Academy members may submit formal nominations. Consideration of a candidate begins with his or her nomination, followed by an extensive and careful vetting process that results in a final ballot at the Academy's annual meeting in April each year. Currently, a maximum of 120 members may be elected annually. Members must be U.S. citizens; non-citizens are elected as international members, with a maximum of 30 elected annually.\n\nMembers are affiliated with a section (scientific discipline) in one of six Classes:\n\nPhysical and Mathematical Sciences\n\nBiological Sciences\n\nEngineering and Applied Sciences\n\nBiomedical Sciences\n\nBehavioral and Social Sciences\n\nApplied Biological, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences\n\nVisit these resources to learn more about our members, their work, and their contributions to science:"}]}
