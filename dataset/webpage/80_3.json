So I might be coming to this one with a bit of a biased attitude, however, I still know a great book when I read one.\n\nSaul David has written a terrific account of the rise of the British Army as the Army of Empire, and by consequence, a terrific account of how Great Britain became a world superpower.\n\nWhen we think of the might and glory of the British Empire, typically we think of the \"Wooden Walls of England\", the Royal Navy. However, the Army made a name for itself on the fields of Europe, the British Isles, North America, the Caribbean, and India, as one of the best in history.\n\nThe book begins with the dawn of the creation of the modern British Army, after the end of the English Civil Wars. It's baptism of fire would be in the Glorious Revolution, and here Mr. David sets the standard for the rest of the book.\n\nHe typically will take, or two or three, significant battles to showcase the evolution, effectiveness, and capabilities of the British Army. All the while he sets the Battle in it's operational, strategic, and political context. And even if he skips over certain manor engagements, it is because he focuses less on telling the whole story of an event, in making a point about said event.\n\nCase in point, he details superbly the Battle of Blenheim in the War of the Spanish Succession, but skims over the Battle of Malplaquet with a mere mention.\n\nEven so, this book covers a considerable amount of military history between it's covers. Everything from the Glorious Revolution and the War of the Spanish Succession, to the Jacobin '48, the Seven Years War (both in Europe and North America), the Colonial War for Independence, conflicts in India, and the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nThrough it all, Mr. David showcases the tactical and doctrinal evolution of the British Army, how it's kitting changes through time, and how it's administration evolves to meet the changing needs of a growing Imperial commitment. He also gives excellent profiles, and miniature military biographies of two of Britain's greatest Captain's: John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, and Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington.\n\nThere are other personalities he showcases and discusses, of course, James Wolfe for example, but he focuses on Marlborough and Wellington. And it must be said that his descriptions of the individual battles are amazingly well done.\n\nThis was a damned exciting book to read. And if you have any English, Scottish, or Irish in you at all, this book should fill your heart with pride.\n\nVery highly recommended."}, {"url": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Indian_Mutiny.html?id=eULXUXXc2NQC", "page_content": "'A fine achievement by a huge new talent' William Dalrymple, Sunday Times\n\n\n\nIn 1857 the native troops of the Bengal army rose against their colonial masters.

The whole Peshawar garrison had been formed into three sides of an open square. The fourth was made up of forty cannons. Watching eagerly from the edge of the parade-ground were thousands of civilian spectators. Once the sentence had been read, the guns were primed with powder but no shot, and the prisoners were led forward. Each one was tied by the wrist to the upper part of the gun\u2019s wheels so that the muzzle pressed into the pit of his stomach. The artillery officer then gave the word and the guns were fired simultaneously. At first the smoke obscured all view. As it cleared, the only visible remnants of the prisoners were their arms, still attached to the guns. Then here and there, having been shot hundreds of feet into the air, fell a number of slightly blackened but otherwise intact heads\u2026\u201d\n\n- Saul David, The Indian Mutiny\n\n\n\nIn 1857, vast swaths of India were ruled by the East India Company, a British joint stock company that took corporate violence to a whole other level, exercising both military and administrative functions, as it sought to control trade and enrich itself. On May 10 of that year, however, after years of growing tensions, Indian soldiers revolted in Meerut, and then headed to Delhi, where they proclaimed the aging Bahadur Shah as the new Mogul Emperor. From there, the rebellion spread, threatening to kick Great Britain off the subcontinent.\n\n\n\nThis event goes by many names. In Great Britain, it was viewed as an insurrection, and referred to as \u201cthe Indian Mutiny\u201d or \u201cthe Sepoy Mutiny.\u201d For many in India, however, it was the First War of Independence, beginning a movement that would reach its apogee some ninety years later.\n\n\n\nWhatever it is called (for simplicity\u2019s sake, I\u2019ll refer to it as a mutiny), it was a bloody and vicious affair. Thousands of British soldiers and civilians were killed, while Indian casualties have been estimated as reaching into the hundreds of thousands. The war was marked by incredibly cruel acts, encompassing the murder of noncombatant women and children, the destruction of cities, and the macabre execution of alleged mutineers by being blown from cannons.\n\n\n\nIn The Indian Mutiny, Saul David attempts to capture this momentous struggle in just over four-hundred dense pages of text. Though devoid of any literary flair, and workmanlike in its presentation, I found this book to be a valuable overview of a complex subject. With maps, appendixes, a timeline, and a glossary, The Indian Mutiny does its best to be accessible without sacrificing its academic underpinnings.\n\n\n\nUtilizing a chronological approach, David starts with an introduction to the East India Company, and then proceeds methodically through the sequence of events from 1857 to 1859, discussing the causes of the mutiny, how it was organized, and how it ultimately played out across the country.\n\n\n\nFor the most part, this book reads like a military history. There is a lot of focus on the battles, and a somewhat obsessive accounting for all the various units involved. While David tries to touch on just about everything, the narrative coalesces around several major clashes, including the initial uprising in Delhi, along with its subsequent retaking; the siege of Lucknow; and the massacre at Cawnpore.\n\n\n\n(As an aside, some of the names used in the book have changed over time. For instance, Cawnpore is now Kanpur. David uses the 19th century English spellings).\n\n\n\nDespite battles being the centerpiece, the most interesting parts of The Indian Mutiny consist of David\u2019s analysis of the mutiny\u2019s origins. The list of Indian grievances against the East India Company was long. Not surprisingly, being ruled by a brutal for-profit foreign corporation topped that list. However, as David notes, the revolt began with Indian soldiers, and was motivated by such professional concerns as low pay, lack of advancement, disinterested British officers (who often left on detached duty to make more money), and a widening chasm between British and Indian society. Outside of that, the recent annexation of Oudh, a state in Northern India, also caused friction, especially for the troops from that region.\n\n\n\nPut simply, the situation in India resembled a tinder-dry forest, waiting for a spark.\n\n\n\nHistorically, that spark has been identified as the pre-greased cartridges used in the new Enfield rifles being supplied to the troops. Specifically, rumors abounded that the cartridges were greased with either tallow derived from beef or pork lard. (David believes those rumors to be based in truth). As a soldier had to tear the cartridge open with his teeth, exposing himself to either beef or pork grease, the cartridges were offensive to Hindus and Muslims respectively.\n\n\n\nCertainly, the belief in the animal-greased cartridges was real enough. And it definitely feels like the kind of ignorant, culturally insensitive move for which the British Empire was known. Yet, as David points out, Great Britain was actually quite responsive to Indian complaints, and went to pains to ensure that Indian soldiers could grease the cartridges themselves, to satisfy any doubts that animal fat was being used.\n\n\n\nTo David, the fact that this did not quiet the storm demonstrates that the greased cartridge controversy is a bit of a red herring. The real heart of the story is that the rebellion, far from being a spontaneous event, was the culmination of a carefully planned conspiracy. Though many of the members remain unknown, and some can only be speculated, David (who completed a PhD on the war\u2019s beginning) argues that outside influencers fanned discontent within Indian Army ranks in order to overthrow the East India Company. Thus, though it did not necessarily begin out of nationalist sentiment, it seems fair to say that the mutiny sought a nationalist outcome.\n\n\n\nThe challenge in a book like this is to recognize that the mutiny rests on the foundation of dual tragedies. The first, overarching tragedy is that of colonization, in which one group of people benefits at the expense of a lot of other people. The East India Company was a ruthlessly exploitative organization, and you can\u2019t tell this tale without acknowledging that. The second tragedy belongs to the individuals, both Indian and British, who were caught in the world as it existed at that time. The trick is in balancing these two realities, of describing \u2013 for instance \u2013 the horrors of the captive British women and children murdered at the Savada Kothi, while also recognizing the larger reasons while such a thing occurred.\n\n\n\nThough he succeeds imperfectly, David attempts to thread this particular needle by relying on a lot of different perspectives. This is important. Many histories of the Indian Mutiny/First War of Independence relied heavily on English-language accounts. For those Britons who survived, the war had been a traumatic experience, and they wrote about it. A lot. The obvious result of Anglo-centric interpretations is that Indian atrocities were given center stage, while British atrocities were minimalized, rationalized, or simply ignored.\n\n\n\nDavid does not fall into this trap. Indeed, part of the reason I chose to read The Indian Mutiny is because it was suggested by William Dalrymple, a well-respected historian of this era who is known for his dogged research into non-English sources. Though David is no Dalrymple, he does his level best to provide Indian viewpoints, so this does not become one more example of pro-Empire propaganda.\n\n\n\nOne of the interesting observations that David makes regarding the mutiny is how close it came to succeeding. With each town captured by Indian soldiers, with each garrison put to the torch, with every defeat of British troops, the rebellion grew. The East India Company could only hold India by exerting enough authority over its people to convince them that it was best to remain quiescent. As British losses started to mount, it became conceivable that a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of Indians would decide the time had come to join. That it did not happen was a result of the lack of strong central leadership. In the end, the choice to rally around the elderly, vacillating Bahadur Shah in Delhi doomed the enterprise.\n\n\n\nStill, a seed had been germinated that would, in time, mean the end of British rule in India."}, {"url": "https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/53965/the-indian-mutiny-by-saul-david/9780141005546", "page_content": "In The Indian Mutiny: 1857 Saul David explores one of Britain's most harrowing colonial battles.\n\n\n\nIn 1857 the native troops of the Bengal army rose against their colonial masters.

This book outlines the rest of Cardigan's life - his youth, his student days, his avid hunting, service as MP and eventually command (after exchange of an enormous sum of money to the previous colonel, of course) of a very posh regiment of Hussars.\n\n\n\nAlas, a never-ending string of rows with his officers over seemingly trivial matters - some ending in embarrassing court-martials - eventually annoyed his superiors so much that has was relieved of his command. After a few years of waiting and with some help from a sister who is lady-in-waiting at the court of William IV, he obtains command of a new regiment, and the trouble starts all over. In addition to the childish squabbling with his subordinates (much of it driven by Cardigan's undoubted zeal to make his regiment the smartest looking and his officers the most gentlemanly of the entire army), he also ends up in duels and even on trial for one, by no lesser court than the House of Lords itself, of which he is of course a member. At last, thankfully war breaks out and for the first time in his life (born in 1797 he missed out on Waterloo and the Peninsula), already past his mid-fifties, he can finally practice his chosen profession in earnest.\n\n\n\nThis is certainly an interesting book, providing a fascinating glimpse into military life in the first half the 19th Century in all its aspects. It is fair to Cardigan (or so it seemed to me) and also does a good job in describing the times as well as the life of the subject - from parliamentary reform to corn laws and Chartists. At 490 pages, it is arguably a bit long. Most readers, I suspect, would have preferred a less thorough rendition of the endless 'regimental trifles' (as an exasperated Wellington put it to Cardigan in an angry 'stop bothering me' letter), while they would have appreciated one or two simple maps to make the book's finale on the Crimea somewhat understandable. But if you are seriously into the times of Harry Flashman, 'Homicidal Earl' is a very good buy."}, {"url": "https://aspectsofhistory.com/book_reviews/the-homicidal-earl-the-life-of-lord-cardigan-by-saul-david/", "page_content": "The Homicidal Earl: The Life of Lord Cardigan\n\nOf all the cock-ups that provide shade from the bright light of Britain\u2019s military successes, the Charge of the Light Brigade during the Battle of Balaclava, fought in the Crimea on 25th October 1854, is one of the most enduring. In terms of the casualties suffered or the bravery displayed, there are other disasters, including the 1842 Kabul Retreat and the humiliation of Maiwand in 1880, that eclipse what was actually \u2013 in the overall scheme of things \u2013 quite a small affair.\n\nHowever, no other event in the history of British military misfortunes is quite so blessed with such an extraordinary cast of misfits as the magnificent but doomed charge of the \u2018six hundred\u2019. Indeed, no historical novelist, anxious to avoid suspending reader belief, would dream of combining an inept and one-armed GOC with an impetuous and contemptuous staff galloper, and a pair of warring aristocratic brothers-in-law.\n\nNonetheless, that is what Fate did by combining the characters, background and behaviour of Lord Raglan, Captain Lewis Nolan, and the Earls of Lucan and Cardigan. This fatal cocktail of ineptitude, arrogance and mutual contempt continues to fascinate historians, not least Saul David, whose The Homicidal Earl remains one of the best reads on the subject in general, and Cardigan in particular.\n\nWhile not shying away from the Earl\u2019s legendary faults, which he lays out in detail, Saul David\u2019s is a balanced view of man who, in his day, was both lionised and reviled, and whose posthumous reputation is seriously tainted by slurs promulgated in his lifetime. As Shakespeare has Mark Antony declaim over Julius Caesar\u2019s body in the eponymous play: \u2018The evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones.\u2019 So it is with George Brudenell, 7th and last Earl of Cardigan.\n\nAs Saul David points out in the closing pages of this excellent account of an extraordinary life, the historian Guy Paget\u2019s view that \u2018the kindest thing one can say about [Cardigan] is that he was a very stupid man, who tried to hide his stupidity by a display of arrogance and bluster\u2019, is quite simply wrong. For, as Mr David points out, while Cardigan was dogged by self-inflicted controversy, \u2018\u2026 no idiot could have come top of his class at Harrow at a time when the school was educating Prime Ministers\u2026; no idiot could have displayed such an increasingly confident performance on the floor of both Houses of Parliament.\u2019\n\nIt is worth adding to Mr David\u2019s observations, as it lends colour to Cardigan\u2019s character, that the \u2018homicidal Earl\u2019 was a founder member of that most artistic and theatrical of the gentlemen\u2019s clubs of London, the Garrick Club; and, as it gives the lie to the allegation of Cardigan\u2019s cowardice in the face of the Russian guns, that the accusation was refuted in writing by Henry Maxse (later Lieutenant Colonel Sir Henry \u2018Fitz\u2019 Maxse).\n\nMaxse had the unique distinction of being the only infantryman to charge with the Light Brigade in his role as one of Cardigan\u2019s ADCs, riding only a few lengths behind his chief and losing part of a foot in the charge. Fourteen years later, in reaction to Alexander Kinglake\u2019s account of the charge, he wrote to his brother (Commodore Frederick Maxse RN) for publication in The Times, an interesting first-hand account of the action. This included refutations of Kinglake\u2019s assertion that Cardigan had pulled up short of the Russian guns and \u2013 controversially \u2013 that Nolan, whose histrionic verbal instructions had initiated the charge, had never meant the Light Brigade to engage the Russian Battery at the end of the \u2018valley of death\u2019.\n\nThis is what he wrote: \u2018\u2026 my belief is that Cardigan\u2019s conduct as regards leading the charge was without the slightest flaw\u2026 if he had turned short then I think I might have seen him\u2026 Nolan was killed close to me and Kinglake\u2019s account is good \u2013 but absurd as to Nolan\u2019s wanting to charge any of the guns but those which he did\u2026\u2019\n\nWhen the Garrick Club\u2019s records and Maxse\u2019s account are added to that of Saul David\u2019s, a truly rounded and rather less damaging profile of the 7th Earl of Cardigan emerges \u2013 but this in no way mitigate what was undoubtedly a military cock-up of quite historic proportions.\n\nChristopher Joll is a historian and author of Spoils of War: The Treasures, Trophies & Trivia of the British Empire.\n\nThe Homicidal Earl: The Life of Lord Cardigan"}, {"url": "https://www.amazon.com.au/Homicidal-Earl-Life-Lord-Cardigan-ebook/dp/B07B5S6RLF", "page_content": "James Brudenell, Earl of Cardigan used to be a household name a generation ago, when there were still educated people who had heard of the Charge of the Light Brigade.

A good example is George IV, Prinny to friends, a grotesquely obese, self indulgent sloth driven largely by gluttony, lust, and ego (he often fantasized aloud he\u2019d been with Wellington at Waterloo. When he reminisced with the Iron Duke about the battle, his tactful reply was \u201cSo Your Majesty has often said.\u201d).\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s why I read Saul David\u2019s biography of James Brudenell, the 7th Earl of Cardigan, with no little fascination. Cardigan is best known for having led the catastrophic Charge of the Light Brigade during the Crimean War, but already had a notorious reputation beforehand for innumerable quarrels, peccadilloes, and assorted scandals. Spoiled rotten from childhood (the only boy among six sisters), possessed of almost limitless wealth, prone to indulge every impulse, Cardigan was embroiled from youth in one wretched, damned piece of business after another, duels, divorces, serial adultery, and a suit for criminal connection (sex with another man\u2019s wife). He figures prominently in Fraser\u2019s Flashman At The Charge and other fictional depictions as the very picture of a domineering, self-indulgent, rude aristocrat. Trevor Howard gives perhaps the most vivid portrayal of this in Tony Richardson\u2019s fact based 1968 film, The Charge of the Light Brigade.\n\n\n\nA keen horseman and determined upon glory, Cardigan fixed on a career as a cavalryman and, in accordance with the prevailing system for acquiring rank in the British Army, purchased his commissions, often at a very high illegal premium above the stipulated price. He soon commanded one of the most distinguished cavalry regiments in the Army, the 11th Hussars (cavalry in the 19th Century had far more status and panache than lowly infantry). While he trained his troops hard and lavished money on equipment and uniforms from his own funds, his chief feature as a commander was his almost complete inability to get along with subordinate officers. One incident after another is described in which Cardigan embroiled himself in a bitter, personal quarrel with a junior officer, the most well known being the Black Bottle Affair, where Cardigan went ape because a subordinate ordered a bottle of Moselle at a formal regimental banquet. All these matters had to be kicked upstairs for resolution by the Army\u2019s most senior officers. I know from my own limited military experience that COs absolutely hate trouble like this and it doesn\u2019t take too many such incidents for them to form a distinctly adverse opinion of the officer causing all the ruckus. It must have taken all the Iron Duke\u2019s legendary sang-froid to keep from tearing his hair out over Cardigan.\n\n\n\nHis one real chance to capture military glory, that elusive sprite, his ultimate goal, came with the Crimean War. I won\u2019t extend this review to epic length by going into the complicated and confusing details of the Charge, but will simply note that the author gives a relatively straightforward, understandable account of the encounter, aided by maps and diagrams. His verdict on Cardigan\u2019s behavior seems largely warranted to me as well: while he rode bravely with his men into the Valley of Death, he showed complete disinterest once he crossed the line of Russian guns, in fact, turned his horse and returned to the British lines with complete disregard for his men, a singularly gross act of dereliction of duty. Other unsavory details are provided, like his resting in luxury aboard his private steam yacht while his men slept in the open and their horses died of exposure and malnutrition.\n\n\n\nCardigan had the good fortune to return to England before all the Charge\u2019s unappealing details had emerged. He had a brief moment in the sun, lionized and even received by Queen Victoria and her family, but the taint of his spoiled character surely intervened as it always would. Rivals and enemies, to include his own superior and brother-in-law, Lord Lucan, vigorously disputed in public his conduct during the Charge. The black cloud of suspicion and disrepute that had followed him all his adult life gathered again. Heedless, like the extremely self-centered man he was, Cardigan continued to go his own way, with enough energy in old age to create yet another scandal by marrying a woman half his age, who\u2019d openly lived with Cardigan as his mistress previously. With Cardigan\u2019s death, the last of the Brudenells, the title transferred to a collateral branch of the family.\n\n\n\nThe biographer does his best to be fair to his subject. Against charges of Cardigan being an upper class twit, he notes his good academic record during his brief school days and points out how he matured as a politician in the House of Lords. David also observes his frequent kindnesses to enlisted men and tenants, but also recognizes that this was considered noblesse oblige, the sort of obligation aristocrats were supposed to fulfill in Cardigan\u2019s day. Despite these efforts at balance, I must say Cardigan still comes across as a thoroughly disagreeable sort of person, even making allowances for the different era and stratum he occupied from my own. And when it comes to the most important aspect of his life (by his own estimate), his military career, he was sadly lacking, the sort of superficial officer who worried more about sword knots and general turnout than unit cohesion and real combat effectiveness.\n\n\n\nI recommend this book to anyone interested in the late Regency, early Victorian era in Great Britain and the Crimean War."}, {"url": "https://www.amazon.in/Homicidal-Earl-Life-Lord-Cardigan-ebook/dp/B07B5S6RLF", "page_content": "An enjoyable romp through the life of he who bequeathed us the cardigan, that item of clothing beloved by such as Val Doonican and Mothers in Law at Christmas.
