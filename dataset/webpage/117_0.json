{"Stereophonics are a Welsh rock band that formed in 1992 in the village of Cwmaman in Cynon Valley, Wales.": [{"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/stereophonics/pages/biography.shtml", "page_content": "Formed in 1992, schoolmates Kelly Jones, Richard Jones and Stuart Cable practised their art in performances at the working men's clubs of South Wales, as covers band Tragic Love Company.\n\nWe do something right for the people on the street. The people at the cool magazines don't understand why the people on the street like us, and we don't understand either. I don't think any band understands why somebody likes you. It's impossible.\n\nFrontman Kelly Jones had aspirations beyond karaoke, though. A budding scriptwriter, his muse was his hometown, sleepy Cwmaman - and it was the village's dark underbelly that inspired the songs that would make up the band's earliest recordings: poignant narratives about the despair and celebration of small-town life.\n\nIn November 1996 V2 Records released the band's debut single, Looks Like Chaplin/More Life In A Tramp's Vest. Early comparisons likened the band to late-period Manic Street Preachers, but there was a quality to Jones' raw, soulful vocals that suggested far more than bandwagon jumping.\n\nOver the next 12 months, a flurry of singles heralded Stereophonics' debut album Word Gets Around. It was an impressive work: Local Boy In The Photograph poignantly dealt with young suicide, while Traffic found Kelly Jones' sharp observational eye roving over the minutiae of day-to-day life.\n\nIt was the band's intense work ethic that truly broke them: 1997 saw the band play over 100 live dates, rocketing the album into the Top 10. The year was capped with a Brit award for Best New Band.\n\nIf the humble tales of Word Gets Around made Stereophonics the toast of Wales, 1999's Performance And Cocktails would make them household names. The album's first single, the rollicking The Bartender And The Thief charted impressively, hitting number three in the UK chart. And while the album itself was an inferior follow-up to Word Gets Around, it was a greater commercial success.\n\nThe first of Stereophonics' genuinely huge dates - a 50,000 capacity show at Morfa stadium in Swansea - sold out before any support bands had been added to the bill. The show itself was blighted by an ugly war of words. In a show of enthusiastic patriotism, the band played a song written for the rugby international entitled As Long As We Beat The English. But a sackload of letters sent to NME by English fans accused the band's flag-waving show of bordering on fascism.\n\nAmid the furore, the band remained tight-lipped, but the exchange soured the relationship between Stereophonics and the music press.\n\nExhausted, the band took a much-deserved hiatus throughout 2000, although Mama Told Me Not To Come - which found Kelly manfully trying to outbellow Tom Jones on the Welsh renaissance man's cover of the Randy Newman original - hit number four in March. The band's return proved that their runctions with the rock press had clearly hit a raw nerve, however.\n\nThe first single to be taken from Stereophonics' third studio album was Mr Writer - a spiteful retort to music journalists. Dour and plodding, it stalled at a disappointing number five. Thankfully, the album itself - Just Enough Education To Perform - was an artistic return to form. Tellingly, Kelly Jones debuted many of the songs in an intimate solo acoustic tour in late 2000: stripped-down songs like Step On My Old Size Nines found Stereophonics losing some of their bombastic edge and embracing a subtle brand of songwriting that evoked old rockers like Neil Young.\n\nSure enough, a cover of Handbags And Gladrags - written by former Manfred Mann songwriter Mike D'Abo, and popularised by Rod Stewart in the 1970s - that rocketed Stereophonics back up the charts in the December of 2001, prompting V2 to re-release the album with the cover as a bonus track.\n\nIn January 2002, Stuart Cable dropped out of a Japanese tour citing family reasons, prompting rumours of a split. But they pulled back, and the Kelly Jones-produced fourth album, You Gotta Go There To Come Back, was released in June 2003. It was a hard-rocking, whiskey-swilling return to form for the band.\n\nHowever, on 25 September it was announced that Stuart Cable had been sacked from the band due to commitment issues. Apparently Cable only heard of the news once it became public. According to BBC News, the drummer was informed by journalists contacting him.\n\nHe later placed the matter in the hands of his lawyers, adding: \"I'm a founder member of the Stereophonics and I would like to stress that I did not leave nor ever had any intention of leaving the band. I am, and have always been, a fully committed member of the Stereophonics and am very upset that Kelly seems to be saying I was not committed to the band.\"\n\nKelly Jones' statement, on the band's website, said: \"Me and Stuart started a band when I was 12. Emotionally to me this is heartbreaking. I love him like a brother, but commitment wise there have been issues since Just Enough Education To Perform.\n\n\"We've tried resolving them but things stayed the same. Myself and Richard miss Stuart already, a band is like a gang and a lot of time he simply wasn't there, although it was our fault to allow this situation to develop in the first place.\n\n\"No one will be replacing Stuart as a band member, Stuart is irreplaceable, but Steve Gorman will continue to sit in on drums for the upcoming shows. No one member of the band is bigger than our songs. It's a rock and roll band and the upcoming shows will be rocking.\"\n\nTrue to his word, Kelly came back in style. The band recruited new drummer Javier Weyler to the fold, and scored their first UK number one single in March 2005 with the release of Dakota. It was followed by the band's fourth album, Language. Sex. Violence. Other?, widely heralded as a musical return to form.\n\nIn 2006 the band released the Live From Dakota album, followed the next year by their next studio album, Pull The Pin.\n\nIn 2008 the greatest hits package, Decade In The Sun, was released, again proving a chart smash. The forthcoming studio album, Keep Calm And Carry On, is scheduled for release on 16 November 2009, accompanied by a gig at Cardiff Castle, 11 years after their coming of age at the same venue."}, {"url": "https://genius.com/artists/Stereophonics", "page_content": "About Stereophonics\n\nStereophonics are a Welsh rock band that formed in 1992 in the village of Cwmaman in Cynon Valley.

Indeed, their roots are actually traceable back to the mid-80s, when the band\u2019s guitar and vocal frontman Kelly Jones and original drummer Stuart Cable recorded an initial demo in their first band, Zephyr.\n\nDuring their formative years, Jones and Cable lived on the same street in the small town of Cwmaman in Mid-Glamorgan, and, while Zephyr soon blew away into history, the pair eventually joined forces for a second time. Their new project suffered from the inevitable round of personnel reshuffles because Jones and Cable initially wanted to enlist a second guitarist, yet, after another Jones was drafted in \u2013 Kelly\u2019s friend Richard Jones, who brought his reliably hard-driving bass-playing with him \u2013 the group decided to remain a trio.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn rock\u2019s tried and tested fashion, the band began working the local club circuit under the name Tragic Love Company, in 1992. After a lot of slogging, they secured a support slot to the long-forgotten Smalltown Heroes, at London\u2019s small but well-respected Borderline Club (off the Tottenham Court Road), where they met a suitably impressed production team, Marshall Bird and Steve Bush.\n\nOverseen by Bird and Bush, the band demoed one of Kelly Jones\u2019 self-penned songs, \u2018A Thousand Trees\u2019, and changed their name to The Stereophonics; reputedly after Cable had seen the manufacturer name \u201cFalcon Stereophonic\u201d on a hi-fi system. The band\u2019s demo helped secured them further local gigs and also bagged them a manager, John Brand, who first saw the group perform supporting another up-and-coming Welsh act, Catatonia, at Aberdare\u2019s Coliseum Theatre in March 1996. With Brand handling management, record companies began taking an interest and, later in 1996, the band \u2013 now known simply as Stereophonics \u2013 became the first artists to sign to Virgin Records\u2019 new offshoot label, V2 (now part of Universal Music UK).\n\nThe band\u2019s initial rise to prominence was timed to perfection. With Britpop holding sway and a group of exciting, if relatively disparate young Welsh acts such as Super Furry Animals, 60 Ft Dolls and the aforementioned Catatonia scooping column inches in the rock weeklies, Stereophonics\u2019 raw, but melodic guitar pop chimed with the times. Their debut LP, Word Gets Around (released in August 1997), shot to No.6 in the UK Top 40.\n\nLargely well-received by the critics, the LP was stuffed with Kelly Jones\u2019 observational, human-interest story songs, many of which centred upon the vagaries of life in Stereophonics\u2019 home town, Cwmaman. One of the LP\u2019s quintet of 45s, the edgy \u2018More Life In A Tramp\u2019s Vest\u2019 was a rumination on life as seen through the eyes of a supermarket bag boy, while the band\u2019s first Top 30 hit, \u2018A Thousand Trees\u2019, relayed the story of a highly respected athletics coach falling from grace after an unfortunate sexual encounter with one of his students. Arguably the record\u2019s most memorable track, however, was the atypically poised ballad \u2018Traffic\u2019 (also a Top 20 hit), which showed that Stereophonics had more to offer than punchy, arena-ready anthems.\n\nStereophonics toured extensively after their debut was released, receiving a Brit Award for Best New Group in February 1998, the same week their re-released 45, \u2018Local Boy In The Photograph\u2019, became their biggest hit to date, charting at No.14 in the UK.\n\nWord Gets Around went gold in the UK and Stereophonics were on a roll. Their second LP, Performance And Cocktails, was released in March 1999 and drastically exceeded commercial expectations, selling 120,000 copies in its first week and going straight to No.1 in the UK charts. Again produced by Bird and Bush, the album eventually went on to sell over 2.5 million copies, gaining multi-platinum status and yielding three consecutive British Top 5 hits courtesy of \u2018The Bartender & The Thief\u2019, \u2018Just Looking\u2019 and the infectiously poppy \u2018Pick A Part That\u2019s New\u2019.\n\nStereophonics were rarely off the road as 1998 turned into \u201999, touring widely in Europe, Australia and the US. Their schedule included a couple of triumphant homecoming gigs: shows at Cardiff Castle (12 June 1998) and Swansea\u2019s Morfa Stadium, in \u201999 (the latter before an audience of 50,000 people) were both filmed and recorded for separate DVD releases.\n\nThe band seemed unstoppable around the time the world ushered in the new millennium, releasing their third LP, Just Enough Education To Perform, in April 2001. Again topping the UK charts, the record was another phenomenal success, becoming the fourth best-selling British album of 2001 and going on to achieve multi-platinum sales in the UK, double-platinum sales in mainland Europe, and even sneaking on to the US Billboard 200 at No.188.\n\nThe album also spawned three Top 10 UK hits in the vitriol-tinged, anti-critic paean \u2018Mr Writer\u2019, the breezy \u2018Have A Nice Day\u2019 and the band\u2019s emotive cover of the Mike d\u2019Abo-penned \u2018Handbags & Gladrags\u2019, which Rod Stewart previously recorded for his 1969 LP, An Old Raincoat Won\u2019t Ever Let You Down. Stylistically, the record was Stereophonics\u2019 most mature outing to date, with elements of blues-rock (\u2018Watch Them Fly Sundays\u2019) and gospel (\u2018Vegas Two Times\u2019) infiltrating the raw, instantly recognisable indie-rock sound they\u2019d patented on Word Gets Around and Performance And Cocktails.\n\nStereophonics enjoyed further multi-platinum success with 2003\u2019s Kelly Jones-produced You Gotta Go There To Come Back (their third consecutive LP to top the UK charts), though it would be their last record to feature original drummer Stuart Cable, who had begun to forge a parallel media career which involved him presenting a TV show named Cable TV.\n\nNew drummer Javier Weyler was announced as Cable\u2019s replacement, and Stereophonics played a successful world tour during 2003 and \u201904, which featured a celebratory Christmas show at Cardiff\u2019s Millennium Stadium and a well-received appearance at the Manchester Move Festival in July 2004. Weyler consequently made his debut on Stereophonics\u2019 fifth LP, Language. Sex Violence. Other?, which was released in March 2005. Though notably more urgent and abrasive than the laid-back blues-influenced rock dominating You Gotta Go There To Come Back, the album nonetheless put up an impressive critical showing, with trailer single \u2018Dakota\u2019 topping the UK charts and the album following suit, selling 100,000 copies in its first week of release. The record also attracted praise from the critics, most of whom dug the band\u2019s rekindled aggression and the brashness displayed by the LP\u2019s best cuts, such as \u2018Girl\u2019 and the crunching \u2018Doorman\u2019.\n\nOn 2 July 2005, Stereophonics appeared at the globally televised Live 8 concert in Hyde Park, and, the following year, issued their first officially sanctioned live LP, Live From Dakota: a two-disc compilation capturing some of the highlights from their 2005 world tour. They returned to action in 2007 with a new studio LP, Pull The Pin: a slick, accomplished outing which again topped the UK charts and went gold. Arguably the LP\u2019s stand-out moment, the first single \u2018It Means Nothing\u2019, related to the notorious 7/7 terrorist attacks in London. Despite the song\u2019s hard-hitting subject matter, it climbed to No.12 in the UK charts.\n\nFeaturing two brand new tracks, \u2018You\u2019re My Star\u2019 and \u2018My Own Worst Enemy\u2019, the band\u2019s 40-track, platinum-selling career anthology Decade In The Sun: Best Of Stereophonics followed in 2008 before they re-entered the fray with November 2009\u2019s Keep Calm And Carry On, their first record to feature recently recruited second guitarist Adam Zindani. The album stalled at No.11 on the UK charts, but it again went gold and spawned two well-received singles, \u2018Innocent\u2019 and \u2018Could You Be The One?\u2019. Drafted in to co-produce with Kelly Jones, Arctic Monkeys\u2019 producer Jim Abbiss removed some of the gloss of Pull The Pin, but the stripped-down approach suited many of the album\u2019s best tracks, including the lithe \u2018She\u2019s Alright\u2019 and the spirited \u2018I Got Your Number\u2019.\n\nOn 5 June 2010, Stereophonics played the first-ever gig at the Cardiff City Stadium, with support from Doves and unsigned South Wales band 4th Street Traffic. Advertised as \u2018Summer In The City\u2019, the event attracted a sold-out audience of 30,000 people, though the band\u2019s euphoria was dampened somewhat by the sudden death of their old friend and former drummer Stuart Cable, only two days later.\n\nStereophonics were back working on their next album during 2011, though before it was released, Jamie Morrison (ex-Noisettes) had replaced Javier Weyler on drums. Recorded primarily at ICP Studios in Brussels, the long-awaited album \u2013 Graffiti On The Train \u2013 finally arrived in March 2013, peaking at No.3 on the UK chart and selling an impressive 300,000 copies. The LP\u2019s exhilarating second single, \u2018Indian Summer\u2019, reacquainted the band with the UK Top 30 singles chart, and the album itself attracted a brace of highly positive reviews, with critics lauding the record\u2019s diversity and the quality of tracks, such as the orchestrally inclined titular song and the country/soul flavoured \u2018Been Caught Cheating\u2019.\n\nAnother worldwide promotional trek followed after the release of Graffiti On The Train but, by February 2014, Stereophonics were already ensconced in the studio working on new material. Released through their own Stylus label, the seemingly inexhaustible Welsh band\u2019s ninth album, Keeping The Village Alive, was released in September 2015 and immediately shot to No.1 in the UK, as well as climbing to an impressive No.17 on the US Billboard Heatseekers Album Chart. Another highly confident return, its 10 tracks threw a few intriguing curveballs, including the baroque-flavoured \u2018Sunny\u2019 and the sinewy, disco-inflected \u2018Fight Or Flight\u2019, but mostly it was highly credible business as usual, with soaring anthems such as \u2018C\u2019est La Vie\u2019 and \u2018Sing Little Sister\u2019 showing exactly why Stereophonics will inevitably continue to connect on the world stage.\n\nWords: Tim Peacock\n\nUK English Format:UK English"}, {"url": "https://planetradio.co.uk/absolute-radio/music/news/stereophonics/", "page_content": "Stereophonics: All your questions answered\n\nThey've achieved a huge amount in three decades together\n\nAuthor: Emma Dodds Published 5th Feb 2023\n\n\n\nWith over 30 years under their belt, not to mention eight Number 1 albums and 11 Top 10 singles, it's no wonder that Stereophonics are one of the biggest bands to ever come out of the UK.\n\nAfter the wrap of their huge 2022 arena tour, we thought it only proper to take a look back at the band's biggest moments throughout their hugely-impressive career. Find out about the Stereophonics right here...\n\nWho are Stereophonics?\n\nStarting off as a trio made up of Kelly Jones - who announced a solo album back in October 2020 - Richard Jones and Stuart Cable, the band has transformed over the years with various personnel changes. Richard and Kelly remain, now joined by Adam Zindani on rhythm guitar and Jamie Morrison on drums, with Tony Kirkham as a touring member.\n\nWhen did Stereophonics form?\n\nA teenaged Kelly Jones and Richard Jones began jamming together in around 1989, but the band officially started performing together in 1992.\n\nStereophonics: Who is in the band?\n\nKelly Jones and Richard Jones started the band, and are still in it today. Despite various line-up changes, they've stayed together. Kelly sings main vocals and guitar, and Richard plays bass guitar. Original drummer Stuart Cable was part of the group from the start until he left in 2003; he sadly passed away in 2010.\n\nJavier Weyler took over as drummer in 2004 until 2012, when he was replaced by former The Noisettes drummer Jamie Morrison. Adam Zindani joined as rhythm guitarist in 2007, and Tony Kirkham has been a touring member on the keyboard since 1999.\n\nWhere are Stereophonics from?\n\nThe band originated in the village of Cwmaman in the Cynon Valley in South Wales.\n\nHow did Stereophonics get their band name?\n\nThe band were originally called Tragic Love Company, which was taken from each members' favourite band - the Tragically Hip, Mother Love Bone and Bad Company. However, promoter Wayne Coleman convinced them to change it in 1992, telling the band they would not perform under the current name.\n\nHe then spotted a gramophone made by Falcon Stereophonic, and told Kelly about it, who - along with the rest of the band - agreed to change the name to The Stereophonics. When they signed their first record deal with V2 in 1996, they dropped 'The' to simply become Stereophonics.\n\nStereophonics: Their career so far\n\n1992: The band is born Kelly and Stuart lived on the same street in Cwmaman, Wales, and began jamming together as teenagers, recording a demo under the name Zephyr. After going their separate ways, Kelly and Stuart reunited a few years later, bringing in Richard Jones as bass guitarist - and thus, the line-up was complete.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1992, the trio - then known as Tragic Love Company - began to write together, performing in working men's clubs before landing a gig at the Borderline Club in London. They were spotted by producers Marshall Bird and Steve Bush, and recorded demo 'A Thousand Trees'.\n\n1992 - 1996: Career beginnings and name change Promoter Wayne Coleman organised gigs in South Wales after hearing their demo, and whilst he loved the music - he hated the band name, and said they wouldn't play if they kept it. He then spotted a gramophone manufacturer called Falcon Stereophonic, and the band became The Stereophonics.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey played the Coliseum Theatre in nearby Aberdare with Catatonia, and were approached by John brand afterwards who immediately became their manager. Just two months later, they were the first artists to sign to label V2, dropping 'The' from the band name.\n\n1997: Debut album and BRIT Award The band's debut album 'Word Gets Around' was released in August 1997, spawning singles 'A Thousand Trees', 'Local Boy in the Photograph' and 'Traffic' to name but a few. In 1998, they won the Best New Group BRIT Award, and released 'The Bartender and the Thief' - the first single from their follow-up, 'Performance and Cocktails', which in turn was released in March 1999.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe band played to 50,000 people at the Morfa Stadium in Swansea that year, and also collaborated with Welsh legend Tom Jones on a cover of 'Mama Told Me Not To Come'. They toured Europe, Australia and America in 1999, and performed at Cardiff Castle - later released on DVD.\n\n2001: 'Have A Nice Day' After headlining Reading and Leeds in 2000, third album 'Just Enough Education to Perform' was released in 2001, featuring two of their most famous songs: 'Have a Nice Day' and a cover of 'Handbags and Gladrags', which was included in the re-release in 2002. The band performed a two-day festival, 'A Day at the Races', at Donington Park and Cardiff's Millennium Stadium to promote the album, and also headlined Glastonbury Festival in 2002, as well as V Festival.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe band put out their fourth album 'You Gotta Go There to Come Back' in 2003, spawning singles 'Maybe Tomorrow', 'Madame Helga' and 'Since I Told You It's Over'. This was the last album to feature drummer Stuart Cable, who was let go from the band in September 2003. They also had their first headline slot at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2004, which they returned to in 2009.\n\n2005: A new line-up Stereophonics released their fifth album 'Language. Sex. Violence. Other?' in 2005, the first to feature new drummer, Javier Weyler. The album's single 'Dakota' became their first UK Number 1, and they performed that year at Live 8 in Hyde Park, London.\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly pictured here performing at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2009.\n\n2007: Kelly goes it alone Kelly also released his first solo album, 'Only the Names Have Been Changed', in 2007. He explained how it came about, \"We were recording the sixth Stereophonics album... And in-between takes I started doing these songs off the cuff. Three or four tracks in I realised that this could actually be something... Strange how it's always little things that makes big things happen.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly is pictured performing at a session for Absolute Radio in 2009.\n\n2007 - 2010: \u2018Pull The Pin\u2019 'Pull the Pin' was released in October 2007, spawning single 'It Means Nothing' which was written about the London 7/7 attack. Kelly told The Guardian it was \"about the feeling of unease in the city and people realising what was important in their lives.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThey performed at the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in Vancouver, and released seventh album 'Keep Calm and Carry On', playing a UK tour throughout 2010 to promote it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe band are pictured here at a session for Absolute Radio in 2009.\n\n2010: Stuart Cable's death Sadly, former member Stuart Cable passed away in June 2010, and Kelly decided to take a break from writing and releasing albums every two years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe band released song 'Before Anyone Knew Our Name' in 2017 in memory of Stuart. Kelly said of the song, \"I think, you know, Stuart left the band and we were still friends for seven years. And then he passed away tragically, and of course people have opinions about what happened and all this sort of stuff. We kept it very private because we were like brothers.\"\n\n2009: Isle of Wight Festival We met the band backstage at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2009, where they kindly signed a guitar for us.

It contained singles 'C'est la Vie' and 'I Wanna Get Lost with You'. They also performed a set for us at the Dingwalls venue in Camden (pictured).\n\n2016: Backstage at the Isle of Wight Festival We had a chat with the band backstage at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2016 - but there was a slight mishap when guitarist Adam Zindani fell through the deck chair...\n\n2016: Backstage at Isle of Wight Festival take two Thankfully, we were able to get Adam a different chair and complete the interview... Oops!\n\n2017: 'Scream Above the Sounds' The band made their 10th album in 2017, releasing 'Scream Above the Sounds' in October. This realised Kelly's dream that they would put out their 10th studio album in the 20th anniversary year of their debut, instead of releasing a Greatest Hits album.\n\n\n\n\n\nPictured here performing at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2016.\n\n2019: 'Kind' But they didn't stop there, getting straight back in the studio to record their eleventh album, 'Kind', which was released in October 2019 and reached Number 1 in the UK.

They're planning to release their album later this year and also preparing to tour the new music.\n\n\n\nWhat is Far From Saints?\n\nFar From Saints is lead singer Kelly Jones' new band with Austin\u2019s Patty Lynn and Dwight Baker (aka The Wind and The Wave). According to the band's publicist, they first started jamming together when Patty and Dwight performed as the support acts to Kelly's solo UK tour in 2019.\n\n\"The three found themselves jamming and co-writing songs in backstage hallways, dressing rooms, soundchecks and hotels,\" a press release explains. \"Each songwriter subconsciously merging their influences to nourish the alchemy between two formidable singers.\"\n\nAfter releasing their debut single 'Let\u2019s Turn This Back Around' in January 2023, the trio are preparing to put out an album in the summer of 2023 and tour the record.\n\nDavid Bowie inspired Stereophonics\u2019 biggest hit \u2018Dakota\u2019\n\nSpeaking on stage at The O2 in London during Stereophonics\u2019 February/March 2020 UK arena tour, Kelly Jones said David Bowie inspired him to write the smash hit \u2018Dakota\u2019. Stereophonics supported David Bowie on his 2003/2004 North American tour and struck up an immediate friendship.\n\nExplaining that Bowie often watched their soundchecks, Kelly said: \"David Bowie would be watching, so we didn\u2019t want to waste too much of his time. So, we\u2019d play a song for maybe 45 seconds, and then another song for like a minute, and then maybe another song for a minute, and then maybe 30 seconds of a song.\n\nHe continued: \"Then I would walk off the stage and I would walk towards the dressing room, and (Bowie) would put his arm on my shoulder and he would walk with me and say, 'You know, if you extended a few of those songs, you might be f---ing onto something'. So, I wrote this song, this is called \u2018Dakota\u2019.\"\n\nWATCH: Kelly Jones on the history of Stereophonics\n\nWhen was Stereophonics' latest album released?\n\nStereophonics' 12th studio album, 'Oochya!', was released on Friday 4th March 2022.

The band consists of Kelly Jones (lead vocals, lead guitar, keyboards), Richard Jones (bass guitar, piano, backing vocals), Adam Zindani (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Jamie Morrison (drums, percussion) and touring member Tony Kirkham (keyboards). The group previously included Stuart Cable (1992\u20132003) and then Javier Weyler (2004\u20132012) on drums. Stereophonics have released ten studio albums, including six UK number one albums. Their latest album is Scream Above the Sounds (2017). A successful compilation album, Decade in the Sun, was released in November 2008 and charted at number two in the United Kingdom.\n\nDescribed as \"classic UK rock delivered with whiskey vocals\"[8], the band have been summarised as possessing a sound akin to the genres of alternative rock and \"British traditional rock\".[9] Stereophonics' debut album, Word Gets Around, was released in August 1997 and charted at number six in the UK, aided by the singles \"Local Boy in the Photograph\", \"More Life in a Tramps Vest\" and \"A Thousand Trees\". The band reached mainstream success with the release of Performance and Cocktails (and its promotional singles \"The Bartender and the Thief\", \"Just Looking\" and \"Pick a Part That's New\") in 1999 and have achieved a total of ten top-ten singles as well as one number one: \"Dakota\" (2005). Having sold around 10 million copies worldwide,[10][11] Stereophonics are one of the most successful Welsh rock acts. Upon their release of Pull the Pin, they became the eighth group to achieve five consecutive UK number one albums (after the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, ABBA, Genesis, Oasis, Blur and U2).\n\nThe band have also been praised for their live performances, which have landed them headlining slots at many of the UK and Ireland's most high-profile music festivals, including Reading and Leeds in 2000, Glastonbury in 2002, V festival in 2002, the Isle of Wight in 2004 and 2009, and Oxegen in 2010. The band is part of the Cardiff music scene.\n\nHistory\n\nFormation and early years (1986\u20131991)\n\nKelly Jones and Stuart Cable lived on the same street[12] in the Welsh village of Cwmaman.[13] Jones heard Cable played drums so asked if he wanted to jam together.[14] After some time practising in Jones' dad's garage, Nicholas Geek joined in on guitar. Later,[b] Jones invited Paul Rosser and Chris Davies to play on bass guitar and keyboards, respectively.[15] Cable recalls he was the one who suggested that Jones be the singer, as his dad was a singer back in the sixties who supported Roy Orbison.[15] In 1986 the band recorded a demo under the name \"Zephyr\". When Jones went on holiday the band played a gig without him, which resulted in Jones leaving the band and Jones and Cable going their separate ways.[12] Jones, Rosser and Davies formed their own R&B band called \"Silent Runner\" while Cable joined a glam-rock band named \"King Catwalk\" on drums.[16]\n\nA few years later,[b] Cable got sacked from the band and a few weeks after that when on a bus, he waved to Jones who was standing at a bus stop and waved back.[17] It was the first contact they had since Zephyr had broken up. Two weeks later, Jones and Cable started speaking again in the Ivy Bush.[18] They agreed to give the band another go but Cable only wanted to play their own songs, to which Jones agreed.[18] The duo invited Mark Everett to play for them on bass guitar and Jones then started writing his own songs.[19]\n\nEverett went on holiday for two weeks but Jones and Cable wanted to continue rehearsing, so Jones invited long-time friend Richard Jones to fill in for Everett.[19] Stunned by Richard's appearance and bass playing, Cable convinced Kelly to keep him instead of Everett.[19] The band decided they needed another member to play lead guitar. Simon Collier was the first guitarist brought in, but didn't stay in the band; he did, however, become Kelly's guitar technician.[20] The band tried hiring two other guitarists, another Richard Jones and Glenn Hyde.[21] Neither stayed for long. Hyde did however play harmonica on \"Rooftop\" for the band's 2001 album Just Enough Education to Perform.[21] After Hyde left, the band stuck as a three-piece act.[21]\n\nName change and V2 Records (1992\u20131996)\n\nKelly, Richard and Cable began writing and performing music in working men's clubs together in 1992 as a band known as \"Tragic Love Company\", a name inspired by their favourite bands (the Tragically Hip, Mother Love Bone and Bad Company).[22] After Tragic Love Company supported Smalltown Heroes in the Borderline Club, London, they met Marshall Bird and Steve Bush who were interested in producing for the band. The band agreed and recorded a demo for \"A Thousand Trees\".[23]\n\nWayne Coleman organised a series of concerts throughout South Wales, he was sent a demo from the band. Wayne liked it a lot but hated the band name and told them they wouldn't be performing unless they changed it.[24] After Cable read the manufacturer name of a gramophone, \"Falcon Stereophonic\", he told Kelly and the band agreed to change their name to \"the Stereophonics\".[25] In March 1996, the band played a gig at their local Coliseum Theatre, Aberdare with Catatonia and the Pocket Devils.[25] When the band finished their slot, John Brand approached them and he became their manager.[26] Brand managed to get over 35 record companies in the UK interested in signing the Stereophonics.[27] In May 1996, they signed with V2,[28] the first artists to be signed to newly formed record label.[29] Upon signing, they dropped \"the\" from their name and simply became \"Stereophonics\".\n\nDebut album and ascent to fame (1997\u20132000)\n\nIn August 1997, the band released their first studio album, Word Gets Around, which reached number six in the UK charts, from which five singles were released. Afterwards, the band embarked on a successful world tour.\n\nIn February 1998, the band received a BRIT Award for Best New Group. In the same week, the band re-released the single \"Local Boy in the Photograph\", which in turn reached number fourteen in the UK Singles Chart. The band's debut album, Word Gets Around, also went gold in the UK.\n\nIn November 1998, \"The Bartender and the Thief\" (the first single from the album Performance and Cocktails) was released, eventually reaching number three on the UK charts. \"Just Looking\" was released next and reached number four in March 1999. In that same month, the album was released, entering at number one and going platinum within three weeks. Later that year, the band played in front of 50,000 people at Morfa Stadium in Swansea. The concert was filmed and released on DVD the following year. They also collaborated with Tom Jones on a cover of the Randy Newman song \"Mama Told Me Not To Come\", for the Tom Jones album Reload.\n\nThroughout 1998 and 1999, the band toured in Europe, Australia and the US. On 12 June 1998, Stereophonics played to over 10,000 spectators in the grounds of Cardiff Castle in Wales. Footage of the concert was released on VHS and DVD, titled Live at Cardiff Castle.\n\nMainstream success (2001\u20132004)\n\nThe band released their third album, Just Enough Education to Perform, in April 2001. The album included the track \"Mr. Writer\", which includes lyrics that criticise a critic who the band believe gave them a negative review. The album also contained one of the band's most famous tracks, \"Have a Nice Day\", which reached number five in the UK charts. To promote the new album, Just Enough Education to Perform, the Stereophonics played a two-day festival, which was called A Day at the Races. This event was held in Donington Park on the first day and at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on the second. The concerts were supported by Ash, Black Crowes and the Crocketts, with Proud Mary playing Donington only. Over 200,000 separate tickets were sold for the weekend festival. The performance was released on a DVD in 2002.\n\n2003 saw the release of their fourth album, titled You Gotta Go There to Come Back. In September 2003, drummer Stuart Cable was sacked. According to reports, it was because of his lack of commitment to the band. Cable, at the time, presented a TV show called \"Cable TV\" and felt that the band would never improve. Because of this, he missed several rehearsals and live concerts. He was eventually replaced by Javier Weyler.[30] Steve Gorman, from the Black Crowes, stood in for Cable during the band's live performances until Weyler was appointed. When asked about Cable leaving the band in a 2010 interview with Rip It Up magazine, Kelly Jones admitted to the difficulty of the situation.[31]\n\nTowards the end of the year, Stereophonics did a sold-out tour of the UK, ending with a Christmas show at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, supported by Feeder, Ocean Colour Scene and Adam Masterson. The show was closed with a live version of \"Merry Xmas Everybody\", originally recorded by Slade. The group took a break after their 2003\u20132004 world tour, which included a set at the Manchester Move Festival in July 2004.\n\nDrummer change and Stuart Cable's death (2005\u20132010)\n\nTheir fifth studio album, Language. Sex. Violence. Other? was released in March 2005. It marked their first recording with new drummer Javier Weyler. The band achieved their first number one hit in the UK singles charts with the album's first single, \"Dakota\". The second single from the album was \"Superman\". However, that song did not repeat the success of \"Dakota\", peaking at number thirteen. After \"Superman\" came \"Devil\", featuring a controversial video and reaching number eleven in the charts. The album was nominated for a Pop Factory award at the end of the year, losing out to Feeder's Pushing the Senses.\n\nOn 2 July 2005, the group appeared at the Live 8 concert in Hyde Park, London, playing to their biggest audience yet. The band were also scheduled to support Oasis for a number of dates across Europe, in early 2006, but pulled out due to family commitments. 2006 also saw the release of Stereophonics' first live album, Live from Dakota. The album is a two-disc compilation, featuring twenty tracks spanning all five of the band's albums and capturing the best of their 2005 world tour. Rather than being a recording of a single show, the tour was recorded every night and the band picked out the best version of each song individually. The album also features a track titled \"Jayne\", later released as part of Kelly Jones' solo album, Only the Names Have Been Changed.\n\nPull the Pin was released in the UK on 15 October 2007, along with a download-only taster; \"Bank Holiday Monday\". The track was also available for free to people who pre-ordered tickets for the band's concerts in 2007. The album was written and recorded by November 2006 but held back for release until late 2007.[32] \"It Means Nothing\" was the first single of the album, released in September before the LP was released a week later on 15 October. The album contains twelve songs and reached number one in the UK's official album chart. The next single, \"My Friends\", reached number thirty-two in the UK charts, their poorest chart performance since \"More Life in a Tramps Vest\" from their debut album.\n\nOn 20 May 2007, at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Preston, the band were joined on stage by Casino frontman Adam Zindani. Zindani continued to tour with the band for the remainder of the Pull the Pin tour, playing lead guitar and backing vocals. He has been credited for writing and performing on two of the band's new tracks, \"You're My Star\" and \"My Own Worst Enemy\". On \"You're My Star\", he sings backing vocals and plays lead guitar, whereas on \"My Own Worst Enemy\" he only plays lead guitar. In November 2008, Stereophonics released their first greatest hits compilation, Decade in the Sun.\n\nOn 8 December 2009, the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games announced the line up for performers for the nightly Victory Ceremonies.[33] These ceremonies included 30 minutes of entertainment from the evening's host province/territory, 30 minutes of medal presentations, and a one-hour performance by a musical talent. Stereophonics performed their song \"I Got Your Number\" at this event on 20 February - Yukon Night. The band's seventh album, titled Keep Calm and Carry On, was released on 16 November 2009. They decided on this name after seeing a poster in the White Horse pub in Richmond where they spent a lot of time whilst recording the album.[34] The album's debut single was \"Innocent\".[35] The second single from the album, \"Could You Be the One?\", was released on 15 February 2010. The band embarked on a seven-date tour to support the new album in March 2010 playing at Aberdeen, Newcastle, Glasgow, Nottingham, Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield and London.[34] with support from Glasgow band Hip Parade.\n\nOn 5 June 2010, Stereophonics played the first-ever gig at the Cardiff City Stadium with support from unsigned South Wales band 4th Street Traffic, followed by Kids in Glass Houses and Doves. The concert, known as \"Summer in the City\", was played to a sold-out audience of 30,000. Two days later, original drummer Stuart Cable was found dead in his home in Aberdare having choked on his own vomit after binge drinking.[36] After the Keep Calm and Carry On Tour concluded, and their contract with Universal at an end, Kelly Jones wanted to change the way the band works and so decided to take a break from writing and recording an album every two years.[37]\n\nGraffiti on the Train, Keep the Village Alive and Scream Above the Sounds (2011\u2013present)\n\nOn 3 March 2011, Stereophonics announced on their Facebook page that they were working on new music in the studio.[38] In July 2012 it was announced that Weyler and the band had parted company. The announcement was made on the band's Facebook page, though no reason was given for his departure.[39] It was announced on 24 September 2012 that Jamie Morrison, former drummer for Noisettes, had replaced Weyler in the band.[40] On 8 October 2012, Stereophonics released the video to a track titled \"Violins and Tambourines\" from the upcoming album.[41] On 4 November, the first single from the new album, \"In a Moment\", was released as a free download from the band's website.[42] On the same day, NME.com reported that the album would be titled Graffiti on the Train.[43] The album was released on 4 March 2013.[44] Second single preceding the album, \"Indian Summer\" was released in January 2013; by 10 March it had peaked at number 30 in the UK, making it their group's first UK top-40 single since 2007. A third single, the album's title track, was released on 13 May.[45]\n\nIn late September 2014, it was announced via their Twitter page that a new album has been mixed and that it should be released in 2015.[46] On 21 March 2015, Stereophonics performed in Bristol and in London's Royal Albert Hall and debuted 3 new songs \"C'est La Vie\", \"I Wanna Get Lost With You\" and \"Song for the Summer\" which are to be on their 9th album Keep the Village Alive with the release date of 11 September. \"C'est la Vie\" was released as the first single of the album. [47] In September 2015 the band appeared on BBC Two's Later... with Jools Holland.[48] During the Keep the Summer Alive Tour, Kelly Jones announced he would like to release the band's tenth studio album \"before next summer\" to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Word Gets Around, rather than release a compilation album.[49][50]\n\nOn 27 July 2017 the band announced Scream Above the Sounds as the title for the album and will be released on 27 October 2017. It became available to pre-order on the same day. The band released \"All In One Night\" on the same day as the lead single from it. On 4 September 2017 \"Caught By The Wind\" was released as the second single from the album followed by \"What's All The Fuss About?\" as the third single on 4 December 2017. They will embark on a tour in 2018\n\nOther projects\n\nOn 9 October 2007, a retrospective DVD was released in the United States, Rewind: The First 10 Years. The DVD is a double disc with a runtime of nearly four hours. Much of this footage was recorded around the time that the You Gotta Go There to Come Back album was being recorded. This is because a similar band history DVD was listed for release shortly after that album but was never released, due to the departure of Stuart Cable. This explains Jones' hairstyle (circa 2003/2004) in the interview footage and the appearance of Stuart and the rest of the band freely talking about their togetherness and solidarity as the original three members. The original footage was updated by adding further footage to the end, bringing it up to date with the band's fifth album. Stuart does not appear on any of the extra footage. Availability coincides with the US re-release of the Language.Sex.Violence.Other? DVD, and the worldwide digital debut of their latest studio album, Pull the Pin.\n\nIn 2007, Jones released a solo album, titled Only the Names Have Been Changed, while recording the band's sixth studio album, Pull the Pin. The album contains ten tracks (all named after women) and features minimal instrumentation. The album also includes the song \"Jayne\", a previously unreleased Stereophonics track featured on the live album Live from Dakota and the Rewind DVD.\n\nStereophonics also performed the original opening theme tune for the TV series Long Way Round. The song's lyrics were slightly altered for the follow-up series, Long Way Down.\n\nPersonnel\n\nCurrent members Kelly Jones \u2013 lead vocals, lead guitar, keyboards, piano (1992\u2013present)\n\nRichard Jones \u2013 bass, piano, backing vocals (1992\u2013present)\n\nAdam Zindani \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2007\u2013present)\n\nJamie Morrison \u2013 drums (2012\u2013present) Former members Stuart Cable \u2013 drums, percussion (1992\u20132003; died 2010)\n\nJavier Weyler \u2013 drums, percussion, backing vocals (2004\u20132012) Current touring musicians Tony Kirkham \u2013 keyboards, piano, harmonica, backing vocals (1999\u2013present) Former touring musicians Scott James \u2013 guitar, backing vocals (2001\u20132004)\n\nAileen McLaughlin \u2013 backing vocals (2002\u20132003)\n\nAnna Ross \u2013 backing vocals (2002\u20132003)\n\nSteve Gorman \u2013 drums, percussion (2003\u20132004; member of the Black Crowes)\n\nSam Yapp \u2013 drums, percussion (2012; member of Casino)\n\nTimeline\n\nDiscography\n\nWord Gets Around (1997)\n\n(1997) Performance and Cocktails (1999)\n\n(1999) Just Enough Education to Perform (2001)\n\n(2001) You Gotta Go There to Come Back (2003)\n\n(2003) Language.

The duo invited Mark Everett to play for them on bass guitar and Jones then started writing his own songs.\n\nEverett went on holiday for two weeks but Jones and Cable wanted to continue rehearsing, so Jones invited long-time friend Richard Jones to fill in for Everett. Stunned by Richard's appearance and bass playing, Cable convinced Kelly to keep him instead of Everett. The band decided they needed another member to play lead guitar. Simon Collier was the first guitarist brought in, but didn't stay in the band; he did, however, become Kelly's guitar technician. The band tried hiring two other guitarists, another Richard Jones and Glenn Hyde. Neither stayed for long. Hyde did however play harmonica on \"Rooftop\" for the band's 2001 album Just Enough Education to Perform. After Hyde left, the band stuck as a three-piece act.\n\nMainstream success (2001\u20132004)\n\nThe band released their third album, Just Enough Education to Perform, in April 2001. The album included the track \"Mr. Writer\", which includes lyrics that criticise a critic who the band believe gave them a negative review. The album also contained one of the band's most famous tracks, \"Have a Nice Day\", which reached number five in the UK charts. To promote the new album, Just Enough Education to Perform, the Stereophonics played a two-day festival, which was called A Day at the Races. This event was held in Donington Park on the first day and at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on the second. The concerts were supported by Ash, Black Crowes and the Crocketts, with Proud Mary playing Donington only. Over 200,000 separate tickets were sold for the weekend festival. The performance was released on a DVD in 2002.\n\n2003 saw the release of their fourth album, titled You Gotta Go There to Come Back. The album contained one of the band's most popular songs, Maybe Tomorrow. In September 2003, drummer Stuart Cable was sacked. According to reports, it was because of his lack of commitment to the band. Cable, at the time, presented a TV show called \"Cable TV\" and felt that the band would never improve. Because of this, he missed several rehearsals and live concerts. He was eventually replaced by Javier Weyler. Steve Gorman, from the Black Crowes, stood in for Cable during the band's live performances until Weyler was appointed. When asked about Cable leaving the band in a 2010 interview with Rip It Up magazine, Kelly Jones acknowledged the difficulty of the situation.\n\nTowards the end of the year, Stereophonics did a sold-out tour of the UK, ending with a Christmas show at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, supported by Feeder, Ocean Colour Scene and Adam Masterson. The show was closed with a live version of \"Merry Xmas Everybody\", originally recorded by Slade. The group took a break after their 2003\u20132004 world tour, which included a set at the Manchester Move Festival in July 2004.\n\nDrummer change and Stuart Cable's death (2005\u20132010)\n\nStereophonics performing in Hamburg, 13 September 2007\n\nTheir fifth studio album, Language. Sex. Violence. Other? was released in March 2005. It marked their first recording with new drummer Javier Weyler. The band achieved their first number one hit in the UK singles charts with the album's first single, \"Dakota\". The second single from the album was \"Superman\". However, that song did not repeat the success of \"Dakota\", peaking at number thirteen. After \"Superman\" came \"Devil\", featuring a controversial video and reaching number eleven in the charts. The album was nominated for a Pop Factory award at the end of the year, losing out to Feeder's Pushing the Senses.\n\nOn 2 July 2005, the group appeared at the Live 8 concert in Hyde Park, London, playing to their biggest audience yet. The band were also scheduled to support Oasis for a number of dates across Europe, in early 2006, but pulled out due to family commitments. 2006 also saw the release of Stereophonics' first live album, Live from Dakota. The album is a two-disc compilation, featuring twenty tracks spanning all five of the band's albums and capturing the best of their 2005 world tour. Rather than being a recording of a single show, the tour was recorded every night and the band picked out the best version of each song individually. The album also features a track titled \"Jayne\", later released as part of Kelly Jones' solo album, Only the Names Have Been Changed.\n\nPull the Pin was released in the UK on 15 October 2007, along with a download-only taster; \"Bank Holiday Monday\". The track was also available for free to people who pre-ordered tickets for the band's concerts in 2007. The album was written and recorded by November 2006 but held back for release until late 2007. \"It Means Nothing\" was the first single of the album, released in September before the LP was released a week later on 15 October. The album contains twelve songs and reached number one in the UK's official album chart. The next single, \"My Friends\", reached number thirty-two in the UK charts, their poorest chart performance since \"More Life in a Tramps Vest\" from their debut album.\n\nOn 20 May 2007, at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Preston, the band were joined on stage by Casino frontman Adam Zindani. Zindani continued to tour with the band for the remainder of the Pull the Pin tour, playing lead guitar and backing vocals. He has been credited for writing and performing on two of the band's new tracks, \"You're My Star\" and \"My Own Worst Enemy\". On \"You're My Star\", he sings backing vocals and plays lead guitar, whereas on \"My Own Worst Enemy\" he only plays lead guitar. In November 2008, Stereophonics released their first greatest hits compilation, Decade in the Sun.\n\nOn 8 December 2009, the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games announced the line up for performers for the nightly Victory Ceremonies. These ceremonies included 30 minutes of entertainment from the evening's host province/territory, 30 minutes of medal presentations, and a one-hour performance by a musical talent. Stereophonics performed their song \"I Got Your Number\" at this event on 20 February \u2013 Yukon Night. The band's seventh album, titled Keep Calm and Carry On, was released on 16 November 2009. They decided on this name after seeing a poster in the White Horse pub in Richmond where they spent a lot of time whilst recording the album. The album's debut single was \"Innocent\". The second single from the album, \"Could You Be the One?\", was released on 15 February 2010. The band embarked on a seven-date tour to support the new album in March 2010 playing at Aberdeen, Newcastle, Glasgow, Nottingham, Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield and London. with support from Glasgow band Hip Parade.\n\nOn 5 June 2010, Stereophonics played the first-ever gig at the Cardiff City Stadium with support from unsigned South Wales band 4th Street Traffic, followed by Kids in Glass Houses and Doves. The concert, known as \"Summer in the City\", was played to a sold-out audience of 30,000. Two days later, original drummer Stuart Cable was found dead in his home in Aberdare having choked on his own vomit after binge drinking. After the Keep Calm and Carry On Tour concluded, and their contract with Universal at an end, Kelly Jones wanted to change the way the band worked and so decided to take a break from writing and recording an album every two years.\n\nGraffiti on the Train, Keep the Village Alive and Scream Above the Sounds (2011\u20132018)\n\nOn 3 March 2011, Stereophonics announced on their Facebook page that they were working on new music in the studio. [non-primary source needed] In July 2012 it was announced that Weyler and the band had parted company. The announcement was made on the band's Facebook page, though no reason was given for his departure. It was announced on 24 September 2012 that Jamie Morrison, former drummer for Noisettes, had replaced Weyler in the band. [non-primary source needed] On 8 October 2012, Stereophonics released the video to a track titled \"Violins and Tambourines\" from the upcoming album. On 4 November, the first single from the new album, \"In a Moment\", was released as a free download from the band's website. On the same day, NME.com reported that the album would be titled Graffiti on the Train. The album was released on 4 March 2013. Second single preceding the album, \"Indian Summer\" was released in January 2013; by 10 March it had peaked at number 30 in the UK, making it their group's first UK top-40 single since 2007. A third single, the album's title track, was released on 13 May.\n\nIn late September 2014, it was announced via their Twitter page that a new album has been mixed and that it should be released in 2015. On 21 March 2015, Stereophonics performed in Bristol and in London's Royal Albert Hall and debuted 3 new songs \"C'est La Vie\", \"I Wanna Get Lost With You\" and \"Song for the Summer\" which are to be on their 9th album Keep the Village Alive with the release date of 11 September. \"C'est la Vie\" was released as the first single of the album. In September 2015 the band appeared on BBC Two's Later... with Jools Holland. During the Keep the Summer Alive Tour, Kelly Jones announced he would like to release the band's tenth studio album \"before next summer\" to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Word Gets Around, rather than release a compilation album.\n\nOn 27 July 2017 the band announced Scream Above the Sounds as the title for the album and will be released on 27 October 2017. It became available to pre-order on the same day. The album was released under the new distribution label \"Parlophone\", as the band parted ways with the old label V2. The band released \"All In One Night\" on the same day as the lead single from it. On 4 September 2017 \"Caught By The Wind\" was released as the second single from the album followed by \"Before Anyone Knew Our Name\" as the third single on 20 October 2017.They released the album's fourth and final single, \"What's All the Fuss About?\" on 4 December 2017. They embarked on the Scream Above The Sounds tour in 2018.\n\nKind. and Oochya! (2019\u2013present)\n\nIn January 2019, Stereophonics announced two shows as part of Forest Live, the summer concert series promoted by the Forestry Commission: 13 June at Westonbirt Arboretum, near Tetbury, Gloucestershire and 23 June at Thetford Forest, near Brandon, Suffolk. Kind. became their seventh number-one album later that year.\n\nOriginally intending to release another greatest hits album, he band announced their twelfth album, Oochya! on 6 September 2021.

The DVD is a double disc with a runtime of nearly four hours. Much of this footage was recorded around the time that the You Gotta Go There to Come Back album was being recorded. This is because a similar band history DVD was listed for release shortly after that album but was never released, due to the departure of Stuart Cable. This explains Jones' hairstyle (circa 2003/2004) in the interview footage and the appearance of Stuart and the rest of the band freely talking about their togetherness and solidarity as the original three members. The original footage was updated by adding further footage to the end, bringing it up to date with the band's fifth album. Stuart does not appear on any of the extra footage. Availability coincides with the US re-release of the Language.Sex.Violence.Other? DVD, and the worldwide digital debut of their latest studio album, Pull the Pin.\n\nIn 2007, Jones released a solo album, titled Only the Names Have Been Changed, while recording the band's sixth studio album, Pull the Pin. The album contains ten tracks (all named after women) and features minimal instrumentation. The album also includes the song \"Jayne\", a previously unreleased Stereophonics track featured on the live album Live from Dakota and the Rewind DVD.\n\nStereophonics also performed the original opening theme tune for the TV series Long Way Round. The song's lyrics were slightly altered for the follow-up series, Long Way Down and Long Way Up.\n\nPersonnel\n\nCurrent members Kelly Jones \u2013 lead vocals, guitar, keyboards, piano (1992\u2013present)\n\nRichard Jones \u2013 bass guitar, harmonica, backing vocals (1992\u2013present)\n\nAdam Zindani \u2013 guitar, backing vocals (2007\u2013present)\n\nJamie Morrison \u2013 drums, percussion (2012\u2013present) Current touring musicians Tony Kirkham \u2013 keyboards, piano, harmonica, acoustic guitar, backing vocals (1999\u2013present)\n\nGavin Fitzjohn - saxophone, guitar (2018\u2013present) Former members Stuart Cable \u2013 drums, percussion (1992\u20132003; died 2010)\n\nJavier Weyler \u2013 drums, percussion, backing vocals (2004\u20132012) Former touring musicians Scott James \u2013 guitar, backing vocals (2001\u20132004)\n\nAileen McLaughlin \u2013 backing vocals (2002\u20132003)\n\nAnna Ross \u2013 backing vocals (2002\u20132003)\n\nSteve Gorman \u2013 drums, percussion (2003\u20132004)\n\nSam Yapp \u2013 drums, percussion (2012)\n\nTimeline\n\nSource : Wikipedia"}, {"url": "https://dbpedia.org/page/Stereophonics", "page_content": "Stereophonics \u00e9s un grup de rock format per tres membres: Kelly Jones, Richard Jones i Javier Weyker.
