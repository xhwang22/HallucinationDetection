{"Wilhelm Windelband was a student of Kuno Fischer.": [{"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wilhelm-windelband/", "page_content": "First published Mon May 18, 2020\n\nWindelband was a marvelous essayist. He developed his ideas not in the format of a larger systematic work, but in a series of addresses and individual papers, a selection of which was published in his famous Pr\u00e4ludien [Preludes] in 1883. The genre of Windelband\u2019s writings does not lend itself to the development of a philosophical system, and he often changes the emphasis, framing, and terminology of his claims and arguments from one essay to the next. Nevertheless, he was a rigorous thinker. This entry provides a rational reconstruction of the systematic insights that Windelband developed in his various addresses and essays, and groups them around the central themes that reoccur throughout his oeuvre. With respect to many of these themes\u2014the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant, the fact-value distinction, the question of historical method, and the conception of the history of philosophy\u2014Windelband was a highly influential contributor to the philosophical landscape of his time. Although he did not develop a detailed and encompassing philosophical system like his student Rickert, or the neo-Kantians of the Marburg school, most notably Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945), his ideas shaped subsequent debates on these issues more profoundly than is often acknowledged.\n\nHe also made a name for himself in the history of philosophy by pioneering the method of structuring the historical presentation in terms of fundamental philosophical problems, rather than as a chronology of individual thinkers.\n\nWindelband is well-known for having introduced a distinction between the \u201cnomothetic method\u201d of the natural sciences and the \u201cidiographic method\u201d of the historical disciplines. His argument that history is a science [Wissenschaft] that captures the unique, unrepeatable and individual character of reality has been highly relevant for subsequent debates on historical method.\n\nWindelband\u2019s main philosophical contribution consists in reformulating Kant\u2019s transcendental approach in terms of a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d that focuses philosophical analysis on questions of normativity. Although Windelband thinks of his project as an anti-metaphysical \u201cscientific philosophy\u201d, he is keen to secure for philosophy a role that is independent of the special sciences. He finds the grounds for philosophy\u2019s independence in its formal-teleological method, and in its concern with a quaestio juris, rather than a quaestio facti. That is, philosophy deals with questions of justification, it does not determine matters of fact.\n\nWilhelm Windelband (1848\u20131915) was a German neo-Kantian philosopher. He is considered the founding father of the Baden (or Southwest) school of Neo-Kantianism. The Baden school included his student and successor at Heidelberg, Heinrich Rickert (1863\u20131936), and Rickert\u2019s student Emil Lask (1875\u20131915) as its core members. Alongside his contemporary Hermann Cohen (1842\u20131918)\u2014the founder of the Marburg school of Neo-Kantianism\u2014Windelband is a central proponent of the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant that became dominant in German academic philosophy from the 1880s onwards, and that constituted the backbone of \u201corthodox\u201d neo-Kantianism in the late nineteenth century.\n\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nWilhelm Windelband was born in 1848 in Potsdam, Germany. His father, Johann Friedrich Windelband was a state secretary for the Province of Brandenburg. Windelband studied in Jena, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen, attending lectures by Kuno Fischer (1824\u20131907) in Jena and studying with Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881) in G\u00f6ttingen. Fischer and Lotze would deeply influence Windelband\u2019s philosophical thinking, as well as his work as a historian of philosophy.\n\nIn 1870, Windelband completed his dissertation on Die Lehren vom Zufall [Doctrines of chance] under Lotze\u2019s supervision. The following year he served as a soldier in the German-French war. After his military service, he completed his habilitation in Leipzig and took up a position as \u201cPrivatdozent\u201d there. His habilitation was published in 1873 under the title Ueber die Gewissheit der Erkenntniss: eine psychologisch-erkenntnisstheoretische Studie [On the certainty of knowledge: a psychological-epistemological study]. In 1874, Windelband married Martha Wichgraf with whom he would have four children.\n\nTwo years later, Windelband became professor (ordinarius) of \u201cinductive philosophy\u201d in Z\u00fcrich. He lectured on psychology before taking up a position as professor of philosophy in Freiburg im Breisgau in 1877. In 1882 he accepted an offer from the University of Strasbourg. While his inaugural lectures in Z\u00fcrich and Freiburg had centered on the relation between psychology and philosophy, his works from the Strasbourg period develop his core themes in the philosophy of values and the philosophy of history. Windelband served as \u201cRektor\u201d of the University of Strasbourg in 1894/95 and 1897/98. He remained in Strasbourg until 1903, when he accepted a call from the University of Heidelberg. Between 1905 and 1908 he served as representative of the University of Heidelberg in the Baden \u201cLandtag\u201d. He was a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and of the Academies of Sciences of G\u00f6ttingen, Bayern and Heidelberg. He remained in Heidelberg and taught there until his death in 1915.\n\n2. From Kant to the Philosophy of Values\n\nWindelband\u2019s views on normativity are strongly influenced by his teacher Lotze. In his Logic (1874), Lotze distinguishes between psychological laws which determine how thinking proceeds as a matter of fact, and logical laws, which are normative laws and prescribe how thinking ought to proceed (Lotze 1874: \u00a7x; \u00a7332, \u00a7337). This distinction also corresponds to a distinction between act and content. Lotze observes that \u201cideas\u201d do occur in us as acts or events of the mind. But their content does not consist in such acts, is not reducible to mental activity, and does not exist in the way empirical processes and entities may be said to exist. It is not real, but \u201cvalid\u201d (Lotze 1874: \u00a7\u00a7314\u2013318).\n\nThe distinction between the factual and the normative would become the cornerstone of Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d. In his early writings, however, Windelband does not yet embrace this distinction. In his habilitation thesis \u00dcber die Gewi\u00dfheit der Erkenntnis (1873), he argues that logic is a normative discipline, but that it needs to be put on a psychological basis. This is because the justification of our knowledge claims is always dependent on and relative to specific epistemic purposes which, in turn, are given psychologically. Although he criticizes the identification of the conditions of knowledge with psychophysical processes, he does think of psychology and logic or epistemology as continuous with one another. His 1875 \u201cDie Erkenntnislehre unter dem v\u00f6lkerpsychologischen Gesichtspunkte\u201d [\u201cThe theory of knowledge from the perspective of folk-psychology\u201d] which was published in Moritz Lazarus\u2019 and Heyman Steinthal\u2019s Zeitschrift f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft [Journal of folk psychology and linguistics], is more radical. It denies that logical norms are independent of the conscious mind and claims that the origins of logical norms are to be found in the social history of humankind: the principle of contradiction emerges in situations of social conflict together with the distinction between true and false beliefs; and the law of sufficient reason comes into being when conflicts between rival views are no longer settled by brute force. On this picture, logical principles exist only when humans cognize them. There is no boundary between psychological acts and objective logical laws, or between actual historical acceptance and normative validity.\n\nThis is precisely the type of thinking that Windelband will later reject as \u201cpsychologistic\u201d, \u201chistoricist\u201d, and \u201crelativist\u201d (1883: 116\u2013117, 132). It is not clear what led Windelband to this change of view, but a deeper engagement with the Critique of Pure Reason and with the Kant scholarship of his time, in particular with works by Kuno Fischer (1860), Herman Cohen (1871), and Friedrich Paulsen (1875), seem to have factored in. The clear contours of Windelband\u2019s anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant emerge for the first time in his 1877 paper \u201c\u00dcber die verschiedenen Phasen der Kantischen Lehre vom Ding-an-sich\u201d [\u201cOn the different stages of the Kantian doctrine of the thing-in-itself\u201d]. In this essay, Windelband argues against the idea, held by prominent figures of the \u201cback-to-Kant\u201d movement like Friedrich Albert Lange (1828\u20131875) and Hermann von Helmholtz (1821\u20131894), that knowledge emerges from an interaction between subject and object. According to their view, the object affects the subject\u2019s mind, while the subject provides the a priori cognitive structures that organize representations. These a priori structures are innate as they consist in the psychophysical constitution of the human sensory apparatus and mind. Cohen\u2019s critique of this (mis)interpretation focuses on the concept of the a priori and the question of objectivity (Cohen 1871). Windelband, in contrast, takes the problem of the thing-in-itself and the concept of truth as his starting points. His critique of the subject-object-interaction model leads him to an immanent conception of truth, according to which truth consists in the normative rules according to which our judgments ought to be formed. The immanent concept of truth thus shifts the focus of philosophical analysis on the universal and necessary \u201crules\u201d that ground our judgments.\n\nThe 1877 essay gives a genetic account of the development of Kant\u2019s views about the thing-in-itself from the Inaugural Dissertation (1770) to the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason (1787). This genetic reconstruction is supposed to reveal the underlying philosophical problems and motivations that drove Kant\u2019s thinking, as well as the inner tensions that, according to Windelband, permeate critical philosophy. In particular, Windelband identifies a \u201cgulf\u201d (1877: 225) between Kant\u2019s critique of knowledge and the metaphysics of morals, as well as a tension between the psychological account of the faculties, and Kant\u2019s mature anti-psychologism. He distinguishes between four phases in Kant\u2019s thinking about the thing-in-itself, and argues that residues of the latter three stages are present in both editions of the Critique (1781; 1787) and in the Prolegomena (1783).\n\nThe first phase, Windelband argues, is that of the Inaugural Dissertation (1770). Kant adopts Leibniz\u2019s distinction between noumena and phenomena while formulating a genuinely novel thought: he introduces the psychological distinction between receptive sensibility and the spontaneous intellect. This distinction allows him to maintain the claim that, unlike intuitions, concepts relate to things-in-themselves (1877: 240\u2013241).\n\nIn the second phase, Kant concerns himself more deeply with the question how the concepts of the understanding can relate to objects. He is driven to the insight that\n\n[w]e can only have a priori knowledge of that which we produce by the lawlike forms of our rational activities [Vernunfthandlungen]. (1877: 246)\n\nHere, Windelband follows Fischer\u2019s claim that the categories of the understanding are a priori valid for experience because they produce or \u201cmake\u201d it (Fischer 1860). Because the understanding cannot \u201cmake\u201d the thing-in-itself, the thing-in-itself cannot be known.\n\nAccording to Windelband, Kant then proceeds to inquire why we are even assuming the existence of things-in-themselves if we cannot know them. Here he enters his third, most radical phase. Kant now thinks of the thing-in-itself as a fiction, an illegitimate hypostasis in which\n\nthe universal form of the synthetic act of the understanding is seen as something that exists independently of experience. (1877: 254)\n\nWindelband argues that it is only by dismissing the existence of the thing-in-itself and by jettisoning the phenomena-noumena distinction that Kant can undertake his anti-psychologistic turn. With the rejection of the thing-in-itself, the characterization of sensibility as \u201creceptive\u201d also needs to be abandoned. And that makes a psychological construal of the faculties nonsensical. Kant is then also able to abandon the concept of truth as correspondence between representations and objects in favor of a strictly immanent conception. The immanent conception defines truth in terms of the universal and necessary rules that the relations between our representations need to accord to (1877: 259\u2013260).\n\nAnd yet, Kant could not rest with this radical view given his commitments in moral philosophy. Practical reason, and in particular the idea that the moral law does not depend on the qualities of humans as sensuous beings, but only on reason, demands a return to the assumption that the thing-in-itself exists (1877: 262). In the fourth phase, Kant thus reintroduces the thing-in-itself, while maintaining his anti-psychologism.\n\nThis genetic reconstruction allows Windelband to think of the conflict between the different views of the thing-in-itself that had emerged within the neo-Kantian tradition as reflective of inherent tensions in the Critique. He argues that Kant was especially unclear with respect to psychologism: the distinction between judgment (as a cognitive process) and justification (as logical and normative) is inadequately articulated in the first Critique. Hence Kant is at least partly responsible for the fact that in the first wave of neo-Kantianism represented by Lange and Helmholtz \u201cthe new concept of aprioricity was soon dragged down to the old idea of psychological priority\u201d (1883: 101).\n\nBut Windelband\u2019s approach to Kant is not merely historical. His sympathies clearly lie with the Kant of the third phase. For Windelband, the insight that natural psychological processes are \u201cutterly irrelevant\u201d for the truth value of our representations (1882b: 24), and the idea that the ultimate problem of philosophy is that of normativity and justification\u2014not a quaestio facti, but a quaestio juris (1882b: 26)\u2014need to be defended from Kant\u2019s own unclarities on these matters. Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d can thus be understood as an attempt to purify, explicate and develop the radical insights of the anti-psychologistic move in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d.\n\nThe cornerstone of this endeavor is the immanent conception of truth. Windelband repeatedly returns to discussing the correspondence theory of knowledge with its metaphor of a \u201cmirror relation\u201d between mind and object. He criticizes the misconception that our sensual perceptions are the things-in-themselves and that these things could be compared with our representations. Any comparison must occur between representations, since things and representations are \u201cincommensurable\u201d (1881: 130). According to Windelband, Kant\u2019s central innovation consists in the insight that the truth of our judgments, and the relation of our representations to an object are not to be found in correspondence at all. Rather, it consists in the \u201crules\u201d for combining representations (1881: 134). This leads Windelband to define truth as the \u201cnormality of thinking\u201d (1881: 138)\u2014with \u201cnormality\u201d meaning that thinking proceeds in accordance with rules or norms. Windelband also conceptualizes the object of knowledge in terms of the rules of judgment. The object of knowledge is nothing other than\n\na rule according to which representational elements ought to organize themselves, in order for them to be recognized as universally valid in this organization. (1881: 135).\n\nWindelband uses the terms \u201caxioms\u201d and \u201cvalues\u201d interchangeably to refer to the most fundamental rules, and he uses the term \u201cnorms\u201d often, but not fully consistently to refer to values or axioms as they relate to psychological experience and the cultural-historical world. Focusing his interpretation on \u201cvalues\u201d and \u201cnorms\u201d, Windelband captures the structural similarity of Kant\u2019s three Critiques in terms of immanent truth: if truth is nothing other than accordance with a rule, then there is moral and aesthetic truth in just the same way as there is epistemic truth (1881: 140). In a later text, Windelband describes the unified project of the three Critiques in terms of the necessary and universal relation between thought and object. He writes that the postulates of practical reason relate to intelligible objects (ideas) just \u201cas necessarily\u201d as the intuitions and categories relate to the object of experience, and that teleological judgment constructs the purposive whole of nature just \u201cas universally\u201d as the principles of pure understanding apply the categories to experience (1904a: 151). While this formulation glosses over some of the nuances of the distinction between constitutive and regulative uses of reason, Windelband\u2019s main intention is not that of giving a detailed and fully accurate reconstruction of Kant\u2019s philosophy. In line with his famous dictum that \u201cunderstanding Kant means to go beyond him\u201d (1915: iv), he instead seeks to revive the critical project in a manner that allows it to answer the needs of his own time. And Windelband thinks that the critical philosophy required at the time of his writing is a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d which reveals the most fundamental values in epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics.\n\n3. The Factual, the Normative, and the Method of Philosophy\n\nAs indicated above, Windelband bases his \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d on Lotze\u2019s distinction between the factual and the normative. Throughout his career, he seeks to explicate and clarify this distinction and to illuminate its consequences for philosophical method.\n\nIn \u201cWas ist Philosophie?\u201d [\u201cWhat is philosophy?\u201d] (1882), Windelband approaches the factual-normative distinction by identifying two basic and irreducible types of cognitive operations: judgments and evaluations. While judgments relate representations in a synthesis, and thus expand our knowledge about an object, evaluations presuppose an object as given. They do not expand our knowledge. Rather, they express a relation between the \u201cevaluating consciousness\u201d and the represented object in a \u201cfeeling\u201d of approval or disapproval (1882b: 29\u201330).\n\nDespite characterizing evaluations in terms of the feelings and subjective attitudes of the evaluating consciousness, Windelband argues that some evaluations are \u201cabsolutely valid\u201d. Even if they are not embraced by everyone as a matter fact, they entail a normative demand: they ought to be accepted universally according to an absolute value (1882b: 37). The basic idea seems to be that the normative force of any particular evaluation that is carried out by an empirical consciousness is derived from its relation to a non-empirical, absolute value. Windelband argues that even if there is disagreement about which evaluations ought to be embraced as universal and necessary, the demand for absolute validity itself can be recognized by everyone: we all believe in the distinction between that which is absolutely valid and that which is not (1882b: 43).\n\nAccordingly, there must be a system of absolute values from which the validity of judgments in epistemology, aesthetics, and ethic derives. Critical philosophy, then, is nothing other than the \u201cscience of necessary and universal values\u201d (1882b: 26) that explicates this system and thus reveals the grounds of normative appraisal and valid judgment. Note that for Windelband, normativity and validity are closely linked, if not identical. Absolute values endow our judgments with a normative demand. Our judgments are valid if and only if they raise a normative demand, that is if they ought to be accepted universally and necessarily.\n\nHaving distinguished the factual and the normative by reference to different cognitive operations, Windelband also seeks to identify the points of contact between the two realms. Ultimately, he wants to explain how empirical beings can recognize absolute values. His idea that there is a system of absolute values is thus accompanied by the conception of a \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. In normal consciousness the absolute system of values is, at least partially, represented in the form of norms that are known by \u201cempirical consciousness\u201d and that have an effect on it.\n\nStarting from the immanent conception of truth as accordance with a rule, Windelband distinguishes from among the infinite possible combinations of representations that might or might not be formed by empirical consciousness a subset of combinations: the subset that accords with universal and necessary rules, and which hence ought to be formed (1881: 135\u2013139: 1882a: 72\u201373). This subset is what he calls \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d (1881: 139). Thought is related to and valid for an object if of the infinite possible combinations of our representations, our thinking forms exactly those judgments that \u201cought to be thought\u201d (1881: 135). One might say that empirical consciousness contains (parts) of the system of absolute values as its \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. To the extent that philosophy seeks not only to reveal the absolute system of values, but also to inquire into how they can be norms for empirical\u2014embodied, psychological and historically situated\u2014human beings, critical philosophy is not only a \u201cscience of values\u201d, but also a \u201cscience of normal consciousness\u201d (1882b: 46).\n\nAlthough Windelband refers to the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d as a science, he emphasizes that philosophy does not rely on the methods of the empirical sciences. Philosophy is a second-order science that reflects on the methods and results of the various empirical disciplines in order to reveal the values \u201cby virtue of which we can evaluate the form and extent of their validity\u201d (1907: 9). Crucially, this reflective endeavor cannot be carried out by means of empirical investigation. Here, the distinction between the factual and the normative assumes a methodological dimension.\n\nIn \u201cKritische oder genetische Methode?\u201d [\u201cCritical or genetic method?\u201d] (1883) Windelband lays out in great detail the differences between the \u201cexplanatory\u201d and \u201cgenetic\u201d method of the empirical sciences, on the one hand, and the \u201cteleological\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d method of philosophy, on the other. And he warns of the devastating consequences that result if the two are conflated. He singles out two disciplines that might be thought to be relevant to philosophical questions about values: individual psychology and cultural history. He does not call into question the legitimacy of these disciplines or of the \u201cgenetic method\u201d in general. He even thinks that the genetic method can be applied to values. That is, individual psychology and cultural history can yield valid genetic theories that explain the actual acceptance and development of values in an individual\u2019s mental life and in cultural history. But actual acceptance is not the same as normative validity, and validity proper cannot be found by generalizing from the empirical. A firm boundary separates the genetic method and its approach toward actually accepted values from the critical method of philosophy which concerns values as normative.\n\nWindelband\u2019s argument against the application of the genetic method to philosophical questions has three components. First, he argues that the genetic method cannot solve philosophical questions about normativity and validity, because there is too much variety regarding the values that have been and are actually accepted. The empirical method will not uncover values that are universally embraced by all cultures (1883: 114\u2013115).\n\nSecond, the genetic method can show and explain why some values have been accepted by this or that individual, or in this or that culture. But insofar as it is an empirical method, it cannot establish that the values in question are universal and necessary.\n\nThe universally valid can be found neither by inductive comparison of all individuals and peoples nor by deductive inference from \u2026 the \u2018essence\u2019 of man. (1883: 115)\n\nWindelband points to the absurdity of trying to justify by empirical means that which is the presupposition of any empirical theory: the axioms upon which the validity of any theory is based (1883: 113).\n\nThird, Windelband argues that the genetic method leads to relativism. The argument rests on the two claims just outlined, and can be reconstructed as follows. There is variation between individuals and cultures regarding which beliefs are actually prevalent, and the naturally necessary [naturnotwendig] laws of psychology lead to the formation of both true and false beliefs. As an empirical method with no access to the universal and necessary, the genetic method of cultural history and individual psychology has no criterion for distinguishing between valid and invalid beliefs. This means that it has to treat all beliefs as \u201cequally justified [alle gleich berechtigt]\u201d (1882b: 36).\n\nFor [the genetic explanation], there is thus no absolute measure; it must treat all beliefs as equally justified because they are all equally necessary by nature\u2026 [R]elativism is the necessary consequence of the purely empiricist treatment of philosophy\u2019s cardinal question. (1883: 115\u2013116)\n\nNote that Windelband does not differentiate between the idea that all beliefs have only relative validity and the claim that they are all equally justified or equally valid. In his view, the genetic method does not merely render belief relative to individuals and cultures; it also forces us to conclude that all beliefs are equally valid. An empirical psychology or cultural history that oversteps its boundaries and tries to address philosophical questions about normativity and validity leads to \u201chistoricism\u201d, \u201cpsychologism\u201d, and \u201crelativism\u201d and destroys the basis of normative appraisal altogether.\n\nHaving rejected the genetic method in philosophy, Windelband explains that philosophical method is purely \u201cformal\u201d. The axioms, or values, on which the validity of our judgments is based upon cannot be proven. But it can be shown that the purposes of recognizing truth, beauty, and can only be achieved if absolute values are presupposed. Hence the critical method of philosophy has a teleological structure:\n\n[F]or the critical method these axioms, regardless of the extent to which they are actually accepted, are norms which ought to be valid if thinking wants to fulfil the purpose of being true, volition the purpose of being good, and feeling the purpose of capturing beauty, in a manner that warrants universal validation. (1883: 109)\n\nAnd yet, while Windelband insists on the distinction between the empirical-genetic method of science and the critical-teleological method of philosophy, he takes his theory of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d to imply that empirical facts do play a role in philosophy. In particular, he wants to maintain that empirical facts about individual psychology and culture can provide the starting points for philosophical reflection. He therefore describes the philosophical method as a method of reflection [Selbstbesinnung], in which the empirical mind becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. Philosophy examines existing claims to validity in light of teleological considerations, and in this way reveals the \u201cprocessual forms of psychic life that are necessary conditions for the realization of universal appraisal\u201d (1883: 125). Put differently, teleological considerations allow the empirical consciousness to distinguish within itself between empirical and contingent contents, on the one hand, and the \u201ccontents and forms\u201d that \u201chave the value of normal consciousness\u201d, on the other (1882b: 45\u201346; 1881: 139).\n\n4. The Problem of Freedom\n\nThe distinction between the normative and the factual and the question how the two realms are related also structure Windelband\u2019s reflections on human freedom. Throughout his intellectual career, Windelband returns to this problem, presenting different strategies for reconciling causal determinism and human freedom. His dissertation, completed under Lotze in 1870, deals with the concepts of chance, causal necessity, and freedom. At that time, Windelband still embraces the Kantian concept of transcendental freedom, according to which the noumenal self is the uncaused cause of all intentional action (1870: 16\u201319). But after the 1877 essay, which had uncovered the anti-metaphysical rejection of the thing-in-itself in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d as the radical starting point for the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d, Kant\u2019s metaphysical solution to the problem of freedom ceased to convince him.\n\nWindelband\u2019s most fully developed effort to arrive at an alternative solution to the problem of freedom can be found in his 1882 essay \u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d [\u201cNorms and natural laws\u201d] and in his 1904 lectures \u00dcber Willenfreiheit [On freedom of the will]. In these texts, Windelband articulates the following core claims. First, the Kantian dualism between phenomena and noumena needs to be overcome, and we need to think of moral responsibility in a way that does not presuppose a noumenal realm. Second, causal explanation and normative evaluation are two irreducible, but ultimately compatible, ways of viewing, or constructing, the world of appearances. Third, the object of moral evaluation is neither a particular moral action, nor a transcendentally free will, but a \u201cpersonality\u201d\u2014understood as a set of relatively stable motivations and psychological dispositions\u2014that is the natural cause of our actions. Although articulating these same core thoughts, the two texts differ in how they motivate these ideas, and in the consequences that they draw from them.\n\n\u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d begins by postulating a conflict between natural law and moral law: if the moral law demands an action that would also result from natural causes alone, it is superfluous. But if it demands an action that does not accord with natural causes, it is useless, because natural necessity cannot be violated (1882a: 59).\n\nWindelband holds that causal determinism extends to mental life and that for this reason the conception of freedom as a fundamental capacity that violates \u201cthe naturally necessary functions of psychic life\u201d (1882a: 60) is implausible from the get-go. However, he grants that there are two different and irreducible ways of viewing the same objects: on the one hand, there is psychological science which explains what the facts of mental life are. On the other hand, there are ideal norms, which do not explain what the facts are, but express how they ought to be (1882a: 66\u201367). The solution to the antagonism between natural law and moral law is to be found in the relation between these two points of view.\n\nHere, Windelband introduces the claim that although ideal norms differ from causal laws, they are not incommensurable with them and, in fact, act on us causally. His argument builds on his conception of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d as the representation of the system of absolute values within empirical consciousness. Windelband argues that a mind that becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d is capable of acting on the basis of and in agreement with the norms that it has discovered within itself:\n\n[E]ach norm carries with it a sense that the real process of thinking or willing ought to form itself in accordance with it. With immediate evidence a form of psychological coercion attaches itself to the awareness of the norm. (1882a: 85)\n\nThe norm becomes a determining factor in and for empirical consciousness. It acts as \u201cpart of the causal law\u201d and determines psychological life with natural necessity (1882a: 87; see also 1883: 122).\n\nThe result is what Windelband calls a \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d (1882a: 88), according to which freedom consists in nothing other than the becoming-aware of the norms that command how we ought to act: our becoming-aware of them determines our actions with natural necessity. Freedom is the \u201cdetermination of empirical consciousness by normal consciousness\u201d (1882a: 88).\n\nBut Windelband still needs to explain how it is possible that we can be aware of a moral norm and not act on it. Long passages in the 1904 lectures are devoted to developing the thought that what determines our moral decisions and actions, and hence decisions if and when we act in accordance with the moral law is our \u201cpersonality\u201d. Windelband approaches this as a theoretical, not as a normative, question and concludes that we may well call those decisions and actions \u201cfree\u201d that are predominantly determined by our constant personality, as opposed to being determined by external circumstances or contingent affects. Freedom is \u201cthe unhindered causality of a pre-existing willing\u201d (1904b: 106).\n\nHowever, Windelband concedes that this analysis does not exhaust our concept of freedom since there is not merely a theoretical, but also a normative use of the concept. In this context, Windelband acknowledges the attraction of the Kantian argument that moral responsibility is possible only if we have transcendental free will and with it the capacity for genuine alternatives: we could act differently given the same circumstances. But Windelband rejects the project of grounding human freedom in a noumenal world. He thinks that Kant\u2019s distinction between an intelligible noumenal self that is the uncaused cause of our actions, and a deterministic empirical world as constructed by our understanding reproduces the same problems that earlier metaphysical accounts of freedom had encountered. He discusses two problems in particular.\n\nFirst, on the one hand, the personality that a particular individual has developed is part of the empirical world and therefore, on the metaphysical picture, does not feature into the free decisions of the individual. But, on the other hand, the noumenal self is empty. It is an abstract, general self, uniform in all of us; and thus it cannot account for the differences in the moral life of individuals (1904b: 161\u2013163).\n\nSecond, transcendental freedom is fundamentally incompatible with the \u201call- encompassing reality and causality of the deity\u201d (1904b: 187). God is the ultimate uncaused cause, and the only way to understand this thought is by assuming a \u201ctimeless causality\u201d between God and the intelligible characters (noumenal selves)\u2014a view which ends up undermining the freedom of the latter (1904b: 186\u20139)\n\nHaving concluded that Kantian dualism fails to avoid the pitfalls of earlier metaphysical approaches to freedom, Windelband abandons the concept of transcendental freedom altogether. But while in 1882 his alternative had been the \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d, in 1904 Windelband proceeds to articulate the view that the concept of free will is a mere placeholder in our normative discourse. We are not free in the metaphysical sense, but we are perfectly entitled to pass moral judgment. And we use the language of freedom to express the fact that when passing moral judgment we disregard questions of causal determination.\n\nTo spell out this idea, Windelband takes up the 1882 distinction between the \u201cpoints of view\u201d of explanatory science and ideal norms. He now argues that there are two ways of constructing the world of appearances: we construct the world of appearances according to causal laws, and we construct it according to our normative evaluations. Evaluation\n\nreflects within the manifoldness of the given on those moments only which can be put in relation to the norm\u2026 [O]ne could call the manner in which the objects of experience, the given manifoldness of the factual, appear uniformly in light of such an evaluation another form of \u201cappearance\u201d\u2026. (1904b: 195\u20136)\n\nFreedom then means not that the will is an uncaused cause. When speaking of freedom, we appeal to the uncaused merely in the sense that we evaluate matters independently of causal deterministic processes (1904b: 197\u2013198).\n\nWindelband believes that his view preserves moral responsibility. As described above, his theoretical investigation had yielded the result that that which determines the extent to which we act in agreement with a moral norm is our personality or character. Personality is the constant cause of voluntary action, it determines our actions necessarily according to general psychological laws. From a practical standpoint, personality then is also the ultimate object of moral appraisal. We hold personality responsible, and we are justified in doing so, even if the formation of personality is itself a causal process over which the individual has no control. Ultimately, the upshot of Windelband\u2019s discussion is that moral responsibility does not presuppose a noumenal world and transcendental freedom, because it does not presuppose that we could act otherwise. It merely presupposes that another person in the same circumstances could act otherwise. The idea that one could have acted differently refers\n\nnot to the concrete human being in these concrete circumstances, but to the generic concept of the human being. (1904b: 212)\n\n5. The Natural and the Historical Sciences\n\nIn Windelband\u2019s view, a reconsideration of the Kantian project is not only necessary because of its inherent tensions; broader developments in nineteenth-century culture and science also necessitate an adaptation of the critical method to changed historical circumstances. One important factor is the professionalization of the historical disciplines that had been underway since the early nineteenth century (1907: 12). One of Windelband\u2019s central and best known philosophical contributions concerns the question what distinguishes the \u201chistorical sciences\u201d, that is, those disciplines that study the human-historical and cultural world, from the natural sciences. Windelband\u2019s answer to this question is in line with his formal-teleological conception of philosophy: by explicating the autonomous presuppositions of historical method, critical philosophy safeguards the historical sciences against methodological holism, namely the view that there is only one scientific method, and that this is the method of physics and natural science.\n\nWindelband shares the goal of securing the autonomy of the historical disciplines with his contemporary Wilhelm Dilthey. In his 1883 Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften [Introduction to the human sciences] Dilthey had founded the distinction between the natural sciences and the human sciences or \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on a distinction between outer and inner experience. While outer experience forms the basis of hypothetical knowledge in natural science, inner experience discloses \u201cfrom within\u201d how the individual is an intersection of social and cultural relations (Dilthey 1883: 30\u201332, 60\u201361, 88\u201389). Inner experience is at the same time psychological and socio-historical, and a descriptive psychology capable of grasping the integrated nexus of inner experience can provide the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d with a solid foundation (Dilthey 1894).\n\nWindelband profoundly disagrees with Dilthey\u2019s strategy for demarcating the historical disciplines. In his Strasbourg rector\u2019s address \u201cGeschichte und Naturwissenschaft\u201d [\u201cHistory and natural science\u201d] from 1894, he takes issue with the suggestion that the facts of the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d derive from a particular type of experience. He takes Dilthey to endorse an introspective view of psychological method. To this he objects that the facts of the historical disciplines do not derive from inner experience alone, and that inner perception is a dubious method in the first place. He also classifies psychology with the natural sciences, rejecting Dilthey\u2019s idea that the human-historical disciplines could be founded on a non-explanatory and non-hypothetical descriptive psychology. Perhaps most fundamentally, Windelband rejects the term \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on the ground that it suggests that the distinction between different sciences rests on a material distinction between different objects: spirit and nature (Windelband 1894: 141\u2013143).\n\nWindelband seeks an alternative method for science-classification that is purely formal. His reflections take scientific justification in its most abstract form as their starting point: justification in science is either inductive or deductive, Windelband argues, and the basic relation on which all knowledge is based is between the general and the particular (1883: 102\u2013103).\n\nThe distinction between different empirical sciences is then also to be sought at this level. In particular, Windelband argues that science might pursue one of two different \u201cknowledge goals\u201d (1894: 143): it \u201ceither seeks the general in the form of natural law or the particular in the historically determined form\u201d (1894: 145). The former approach is that of the \u201cnomothetic sciences\u201d which seek to arrive at universal apodictic judgments, treating the particular and unique as a mere exemplar or special case of the type or of the generic concept. The \u201cidiographic sciences\u201d, in contrast, aim to arrive at singular assertoric judgments that represent a unique object in its individual formation (1894: 150).\n\nWindelband emphasizes that the distinction between nomothetic and idiographic sciences is a purely formal and teleological one. One and the same object can be approached from both points of view, and which method is appropriate depends entirely on the goal or purpose of the investigation. Moreover, most sciences will involve both general and particular knowledge. The idiographic sciences in particular depend on general and causal knowledge which has been derived from the nomothetic sciences (1894: 156\u2013157).\n\nNote, however, that Windelband is not consistently restricting his analysis to the formal level. He tends to use the terms \u201cnomothetic\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d sciences, and the terms \u201cidiographic\u201d and \u201chistorical\u201d sciences interchangeably, which at least suggests a correspondence between scientific goals, methods, and objects.\n\nAlthough Windelband does not spell this out in great detail, he also suggests that values are of integral importance to the idiographic method. First, he argues that the selection of relevant historical facts depends on an assessment of what is valuable to us (1894: 153\u2013154). Second, he suggests that the integration of particular facts into larger wholes is only possible if meaningful, value-laden relations can be established such that \u201cthe particular feature is a meaningful part of a living intuition of the whole [Gesamtanschauung]\u201d (1894: 154). And third, he claims that we value the particular, unique, and individual in a way in which we do not value the general and recurrent, and that the experience of the individual is indeed at the root of our \u201cfeelings of value\u201d (1894: 155\u2013156).\n\nIt is Windelband\u2019s student Heinrich Rickert who takes up these suggestions and develops them into a systematic account of the \u201cindividuating\u201d and \u201cvalue-relating\u201d \u201cconcept-formation\u201d of the \u201chistorical sciences of culture\u201d (Rickert 1902). Rickert argues that \u201cscientific concept formation\u201d, by which science overcomes the \u201cextensive and intensive manifold\u201d of reality, depends on a principle of selection. The principle of selection at work in the natural sciences is that of \u201cgeneralization\u201d. For this reason, the natural sciences cannot account for the unique and unrepeatable character of reality. The historical sciences, in contrast, form their concepts in a manner that allows them to capture individual realities (Rickert 1902: 225, 236, 250\u2013251). They do so on the basis of values: values guide the selection of which particular historical facts belong to and can be integrated into a specific historical \u201cindividuality\u201d (examples being \u201cthe Renaissance\u201d, \u201cthe Reformation\u201d or \u201cthe German nation state\u201d). According to Rickert, one can clearly distinguish the theoretical value-relation that is the basis of historical science and practical evaluation. The historian relies on values but does not evaluate his material (Rickert 1902: 364\u2013365). Building on Windelband\u2019s core ideas about historical method, Rickert arrives at a more refined and systematized account of how historical science forms its concepts, that ultimately leads to an account of what culture as an object of scientific study amounts to.\n\nIn some of his later writings, Windelband will pick up the more developed thoughts of his student Rickert. For example, he claims that each science creates its objects according to the manner in which it forms its concepts (1907: 18), and that the historical sciences rely on a system of universal values when making selections about what enters into their concepts (1907: 20).\n\n6. The History of Philosophical Problems\n\nA large part of Windelband\u2019s oeuvre consists of writings in the history of philosophy. Windelband primarily covers modern philosophy from the Renaissance to his own time, but he also published on ancient philosophy. As a historian, Windelband is heavily indebted to Fischer. And yet, he goes significantly beyond his teacher, developing a new method and mode of historical presentation. Windelband conceives of the history of philosophy as a \u201chistory of problems\u201d. Rather than presenting a chronological sequence of great minds, he organizes the presentation of philosophical ideas according to the fundamental problems around which the philosophical debates and arguments of an age were structured. Windelband also takes a reflective attitude towards his own historiographical practice and seeks to clarify the goals and systematic relevance of the history of philosophy.\n\nIn these reflections, Windelband seeks to integrate two main thoughts: First, the idea that philosophy is a reflection of its time and age and, second, the conviction that the history of philosophy has systematic significance. Windelband finds both thoughts in Hegel\u2019s approach to the history of philosophy. Mirroring Hegel\u2019s famous dictum that \u201cphilosophy is its own time apprehended in thought\u201d, he speaks of philosophy the \u201cself-consciousness of developing cultural life\u201d (1909: 4). He also applauds Hegel\u2019s \u201cdeep insight\u201d that the history of philosophy realizes reason and thus has intrinsic relevance for systematic philosophy (1883: 133). Windelband thinks of history as the \u201corganon of philosophy\u201d (1905: 184), as a guide to the absolute values that the critical method seeks to reveal.\n\nBut despite the Hegelian gloss of these two claims, Windelband is critical of Hegelianism. This is primarily because he has a different understanding of the idea that philosophy is \u201cits own time apprehended in thought\u201d. For Windelband, this means that philosophical thinking is shaped by historically contingent factors.\n\nAccordingly, Windelband formulates two criticisms of the Hegelian conception of the history of philosophy. First, he finds fault with the idea that the order in which successive philosophical ideas emerge is necessary and that\u2014in virtue of being necessary\u2014it has systematic significance:\n\n[I]n its essentially empirical determination which is accidental with respect to the \u201cidea\u201d the historical process of development cannot have this systematic significance. (1883: 133, see also 1905: 176\u2013177)\n\nThe history of philosophy is not only shaped by the necessary self-expression of reason, but also by the causal necessity of cultural history. The cultural determinants of philosophical thinking lead to \u201cproblem-convolutions\u201d (1891: 11), in which various, conceptually unrelated philosophical questions merge with one another. Windelband also emphasizes that the \u201cindividual factor\u201d of the philosopher\u2019s character and personality is relevant for how philosophical problems and concepts are articulated in a given historical moment (1891: 12)\n\nSecond, although Windelband agrees that the historical development of philosophical ideas is partly driven by critique and self-improvement, he does not think of this process in terms of progress. Windelband probes the often unacknowledged presuppositions of our talk about progress. In \u201cPessimismus und Wissenschaft\u201d (1876) Windelband argues that science cannot decide between historical optimism and historical pessimism (1876: 243). In \u201cKritische und genetische Methode\u201d (1883) he gives a more detailed analysis of why this is the case. Historical change itself is not progress, he observes. In order to determine whether a given historical development is progressive, we need to be in possession of \u201ca standard, the idea of a purpose, which determines the value of the change\u201d (1883: 119). Windelband is wary of triumphalist narratives that identify the historical development of present-day values with progress. History is determined by contingent cultural factors and could have produced \u201cdelusions and follies \u2026 which we only take to be truths now because we are inescapably trapped in them\u201d (1883: 121). Of progress we can only speak legitimately, if we are in possession of an absolute value that allows us to assess the historical development. At minimum, this means that the appeal to a progressive history of philosophy is of no help when it comes to the systematic task of uncovering the system of absolute values: progress cannot aid in revealing absolute values as it presupposes them.\n\nBut while the fact that philosophy is at least partly determined by contingent cultural factors undercuts necessity and progress, it also opens the door for a reconceptualization of the \u201cessence\u201d of philosophy. In his Einleitung in die Philosophie [Introduction to philosophy] (1914) Windelband reflects on the fact that everyday life, culture, and science do already contain general concepts of the world. These concepts form the initial content of philosophical reflection (1914: 6). But the business of philosophy only takes off when these initial concepts, and the assumptions that are baked into them, become unstable and collapse. An experience of shock and unsettling prompts philosophy to question, rethink, and critically assess the concepts and ideas of everyday life and science. In this process of critical assessment, philosophy strives to purify these concepts and ideas, and to connect them into a coherent, unified system. According to Windelband, in this process of conceptual reorganization, a rational necessity exerts itself. The \u201cvigorous and uncompromising rethinking of the preconditions of our spiritual life\u201d creates certain philosophical problems \u201cwith objective necessity\u201d (1914: 8).\n\nWindelband provides neither a very detailed account of what \u201cphilosophical problems\u201d exactly are, nor of how precisely they spring from the unsettling of everyday concepts. But he makes three claims that, taken together, establish that philosophy, even when reflecting its particular age, is not solely determined by contingent cultural factors. First, philosophical puzzles stem from the \u201cinadequacy and contradictory imbalance\u201d of the contents that philosophy receives from life and science (1891: 10). That is, true philosophical problems emerge whenever the systematizing drive of philosophy is confronted with the deep incoherence of life. Second, philosophical problems are necessary because the conceptual \u201cmaterial\u201d found in life already contains \u201cthe objective presuppositions and logical coercions for all rational deliberation about it\u201d (1891: 10). The necessity of philosophical problems is logical necessity. Third, despite historical change\n\n[c]ertain differences of world- and life-attitudes reoccur over and over again, combat each other and destroy each other in mutual dialectics. (1914: 10)\n\nBecause philosophical problems emerge \u201cnecessarily\u201d and \u201cobjectively\u201d, they also reoccur throughout history. Philosophical problems are thus timeless and eternal (1891: 9\u201310; 1914: 11)).\n\nWindelband also believes that the history of philosophy, pursued empirically and scientifically, can disentangle from one another the \u201ctemporal causes and timeless reasons\u201d (1905: 189) that together give rise to the emergence of philosophical problems.\n\nOnly through knowledge of the empirical trajectory that is free of constructions can come to light \u2026. what is the share of \u2026 the needs of the age on the one hand\u2026but on the other hand that of the objective necessities of conceptual progress. (1905: 189)\n\nAt this point, Windelband reaches a clear verdict on the goal and systematic significance of the history of philosophy: it lies in disentangling that which is contingently actually accepted from that which is \u201cvalid in itself\u201d (1905: 199). History is the \u201corganon of critical philosophy\u201d precisely to the extent that it allows us to distinguish the actually accepted norms of cultural life from that which is absolutely valid (1883: 132).\n\n7. Critical Philosophy and World-Views\n\nWindelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d is also an intervention into debates that had preoccupied the neo-Kantian movement and German academic philosophy more broadly since the materialism controversy [Materialismusstreit]: what the relation between science and world-views is, and whether philosophy is capable of providing a \u201cworld-view\u201d.\n\nGiven that he takes the core of the critical project to consist in a quaestio juris\u2014a concern with normativity\u2014it seems surprising that throughout the 1880s Windelband insists that critical philosophy does not provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d: the project of revealing the highest values of human life has nothing to do with \u201cworld-views\u201d, he argues, because it does not provide a metaphysical account of the world and our place in it (1881: 140\u2013141, 145). Questions about optimism or pessimism cannot be answered by means of \u201cscientific\u201d philosophy, since they depend on the idea that the world as a whole has a purpose. And claims about the ultimate purpose of the world arise only from an unscientific, subjective, and arbitrary projection of particular purposes onto the universe as such (1876: 231). Philosophy is a science, albeit a second-order formal science, and is thus barred from formulating a world-view that would be metaphysical in character.\n\nAfter 1900, however, Windelband\u2019s position on the question of world-views changes. He now claims that it is the aim of philosophy to provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d with scientific justification (1907: 1). Given that Windelband holds that philosophy in general and the Kantian project in particular need to be adapted to the developing circumstances of time and culture, this change of position is not inconsequential: the cultural landscape of the early 1900s demands a revision of the neo-Kantian project that highlights not only its \u201cnegative\u201d and critical aspects, but also develops its positive implications for cultural life (1907, 8). The shift to a more positive attitude towards philosophy as a world-view corresponds to a re-evaluation of Kant\u2019s oeuvre, in which Windelband at least partly suspends the anti-metaphysical rigor of the \u201cthird phase\u201d of the genesis of the Critique of Pure Reason, and attributes more relevance to the Critique of the Power of Judgment. This view is taken up by Rickert, who later argues in more detail that the third Critique forms the core of critical philosophy, and that Kant\u2019s metaphysical project can provide the basis for an encompassing theory of world-views (Rickert 1924: 153\u2013168).\n\nIn his 1904 \u201cNach hundert Jahren\u201d [\u201cAfter one hundred years\u201d] Windelband provides yet another take on the relation between the natural and the normative. Declaring the question how the realm of natural laws is related to the realm of values to be the \u201chighest\u201d philosophical endeavor (1904a: 162), he now sees in the Critique of the Power of Judgment the possibility of solving this problem: here one finds the idea that the purposive system of nature gives rise to the value-determined process of human history. The central concept that allows for connecting nature and history in this way is that of \u201crealization\u201d (1904a: 162\u20133).\n\nThe turn to the concept of \u201crealization\u201d also leads to a shift in how Windelband approaches the problem of science classification. In 1894, Windelband had thought of the nomothetic and idiographic sciences as two fundamental yet disjointed and even incommensurable approaches to seeking knowledge of the word: \u201cLaw and event persist next to each other as the last, incommensurable factors of our representation of the world\u201d (1894: 160). But in 1904, he claims that the concept of realization provides a common, unified basis for the natural and the historical sciences (1904a: 163).\n\nWindelband\u2019s language assumes a Hegelian tone. Critical philosophy equipped with the concept of realization is able to grasp and express the \u201cspiritual value content\u201d of reality (1904a: 165). History is capable of revealing the universal value content in the contingent maze of human interests and desires, and in so doing captures \u201cthe progressive realization of rational values\u201d (1907: 20\u201321). The human as a rational being is not determined psychologically or naturally, but humanity is a historical task: \u201conly as a historical being, as the developing species, do we have a share in world-reason\u201d (1910a: 283: see also 1905: 185). Windelband even suggests that history itself has a goal, namely the realization of a common humanity (1908: 257).\n\nThese remarks remain cursory however, and there is room for debate over how much of Hegel\u2019s ontology of history Windelband takes on board, as well as whether his talk about the progressive realization of reason in history is incompatible with the formal-teleological method that he had endorsed in the 1880s and 1890s. His \u201cKulturphilosophie und transzendentaler Idealismus\u201d [\u201cPhilosophy of culture and transcendental idealism\u201d] of 1910 presents us with a puzzling fusion of Kantian and Hegelian language. The goal of critical philosophy is that of revealing the unity of culture, Windelband now claims, and this unity can only be found"}, {"url": "https://iep.utm.edu/neo-kant/", "page_content": "Neo-Kantianism\n\nBy its broadest definition, the term \u2018Neo-Kantianism\u2019 names any thinker after Kant who both engages substantively with the basic ramifications of his transcendental idealism and casts their own project at least roughly within his terminological framework. In this sense, thinkers as diverse as Schopenhauer, Mach, Husserl, Foucault, Strawson, Kuhn, Sellers, Nancy, Korsgaard, and Friedman could loosely be considered Neo-Kantian. More specifically, \u2018Neo-Kantianism\u2019 refers to two multifaceted and internally-differentiated trends of thinking in the late Nineteenth and early Twentieth-Centuries: the Marburg School and what is usually called either the Baden School or the Southwest School. The most prominent representatives of the former movement are Hermann Cohen, Paul Natorp, and Ernst Cassirer. Among the latter movement are Wilhelm Windelband and Heinrich Rickert. Several other noteworthy thinkers are associated with the movement as well.\n\nNeo-Kantianism was the dominant philosophical movement in German universities from the 1870\u2019s until the First World War. Its popularity declined rapidly thereafter even though its influences can be found on both sides of the Continental/Analytic divide throughout the twentieth century. Sometimes unfairly cast as narrowly epistemological, Neo-Kantianism covered a broad range of themes, from logic to the philosophy of history, ethics, aesthetics, psychology, religion, and culture. Since then there has been a relatively small but philosophically serious effort to reinvigorate further historical study and programmatic advancement of this often neglected philosophy.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. Proto Neo-Kantians\n\nDuring the first half of the Nineteenth-Century, Kant had become something of a relic. This is not to say that major thinkers were not strongly influenced by Kantian philosophy. Indeed there are clear traces in the literature of the Weimar Classicists, in the historiography of Bartold Georg Niebuhr (1776-1831) and Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886), in Wilhelm von Humboldt\u2019s philosophy of language (1767-1835), and in Johannes Peter M\u00fcller\u2019s (1801-1858) physiology. Figures like Schleiermacher (1768-1834), Immanuel Hermann Fichte (1796-1879), Friedrich Eduard Beneke (1798-1854), Christian Hermann Wei\u00dfe (1801-1866), the Fries-influenced J\u00fcrgen Bona Meyer (1829-1897), the Frenchman Charles Renouvier (1815-1903), the evangelical theologian Albrecht Ritschl (1822-1889), and the great historian of philosophy Friedrich Ueberweg (1826-1871), made calls to heed Kant\u2019s warning about transgressing the bounds of possible experience. However, there was neither a systematic nor programmatic school of Kantian thought in Germany for more than sixty years after Kant\u2019s death in 1804.\n\nThe first published use of the term \u2018Neo-Kantianer\u2019 appeared in 1862, in a polemical review of Eduard Zeller by the Hegelian Karl Ludwig Michelet. But it was Otto Liebmann\u2019s (1840-1912) Kant und die Epigonen (1865) that most indelibly heralds the rise of a new movement. Here Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762-1814), Hegel (1770-1831), and Schelling (1775-1854), whose idealist followers held sway in German philosophy departments during the early decades of the 19th Century, are chided for taking over only Kant\u2019s system-building, and for doing so only in a superficial way. They sought to create the world from scratch, as it were, by finding new, more-fundamental first principles upon which to create a stronghold of interlocking propositions, one following necessarily from its predecessor. Insofar as those principles were generated from reflection rather than experience, however, the \u2018descendants\u2019 would effectively embrace Kant\u2019s idealism at the expense of his empirical realism. The steep decline of Hegelianism a generation later opened a vacuum which was to be filled by the counter-movement of scientific materialism, represented by figures like Karl Vogt (1817-1895), Heinrich Czolbe (1819-1873), and Ludwig B\u00fcchner (1824-1899). By reducing speculative philosophy to a system of naturalistic observation consistent with their realism, the materialists utilized a commonsense terminology that reopened philosophical inquiry for those uninitiated in idealist dialectics. Despite their successes in the realm of the natural sciences, the materialists were accused of avoiding serious philosophical problems rather than solving them. This was especially true about matters of consciousness and experience, which the materialists were inclined to treat unproblematically as \u2018given\u2019. Against the failings of both the idealists and the materialists, Liebmann could only repeatedly call, \u201cZur\u00fcck zu Kant!\u201d\n\nThe 1860\u2019s were a sort of watershed for Neo-Kantianism, with a row of works emerging which sought to move past the idealism-materialism debate by returning to the fundamentals of the Kantian Transcendental Deduction. Eduard Zeller\u2019s (1814-1908) Ueber Bedeutung und Aufgabe der Erkenntnishteorie (1862) placed a call similar to Liebmann\u2019s to return to Kant, maintaining a transcendental realism in the spirit of a general epistemological critique of speculative philosophy. Kuno Fischer\u2019s (1824-1907) Kants Leben und die Grundlagen seiner Lehre (1860), and the second volume of his Geschichte der neuern Philosophie (1860) manifested the same call, too, in what remain important commentaries on Kant\u2019s philosophy. Fischer was at first not so concerned to advance a new philosophical system as to correctly understand the more intricate nuances of the true master. These works gained popular influence in part because of their major literary improvement upon the commentaries of Karl Leonhard Reinhold (1757-1823), but in part also because of the controversy surrounding Fischer\u2019s interpretation of Kant\u2019s argument that space is a purely subjective facet of experience. Worried that the ideality of space led inexorably to skepticism, Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg (1802-1872) sought to retain the possibility that space was also empirically real, applicable to the things-in-themselves at least in principle. Fischer returned fire by claiming that treating space as a synthetic a posteriori would effectively annul the necessity of Newtonian science, something Fischer emphasized was at the very heart of the Kantian project. Their spirited quarrel, which enveloped a wide circumference of academics over a twenty-year span, climaxed with Trendelenburg\u2019s highly personal Kuno Fischer und sein Kant (1869) and Fischer\u2019s retaliatory Anti-Trendelenburg (1870). Although such personal diatribes attract popular attention, the genuine philosophical foundations of Neo-Kantianism were laid earlier.\n\nHermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz (1821-94) outstripped even the scientific credentials of the materialists, combining his experimental research with a genuine philosophical sophistication and historical sensitivity. His advances in physiology, ophthalmology, audiology, electro- and thermo-dynamics duly earned him an honored place among the great German scientists. His \u00dcber die Erhaltung der Kraft (1847) ranks only behind The Origin of Species as the most influential scientific treatise of the Nineteenth-Century, even though its principle claim might have been an unattr\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00adibuted adoption of the precedent theories by Julius Robert von Mayer (1814-1878) and James Joule (1818-1889). His major philosophical contribution was an attempt to ground Kant\u2019s theoretical division between phenomena and noumena within empirically verifiable sense physiognomy. In place of the materialist\u2019s faith in sense perception as a copy of reality and in advance of Kant\u2019s general ignorance about the neurological conditions of experience, Helmholtz noted that when we see or hear something outside us there is a complicated process of neural stimulation. Experience is neither a direct projection of the perceived object onto our sense organs nor merely a conjunction of concept and sensuous intuition, but an unconscious process of symbolic inferences by which neural stimulations are made intelligible to the human mind.\n\nThe physical processes of the brain are a safer starting point, a scientifically-verifiable ground on which to explain the a priori necessity of experience, than Kant\u2019s supra-naturalistic deduction of conceptual architectonics. Yet two key Kantian consequences are only strengthened thereby. First, experience is revealed to be nothing immediate, but a demonstrably discursive process wherein the material affect of the senses is transformed by subjective factors. Second, any inferences that can possibly be drawn about the world outside the subject must reckon with this subjective side, thereby reasserting the privileged position of epistemology above ontology. Helmholtz and the materialists both thought that Newtonian science was the best explanation of the world; but Helmholtz realized that science must take account of what Kant had claimed of it: science is the proscription of what can be demonstrated within the limits of possible experience rather than an articulation about objects in-themselves. Empirical physiognomy would more precisely proscribe those limits than purely conceptual transcendental philosophy.\n\nFriedrich Albert Lange (1828-1875) was, at least in the Nineteenth-Century, more widely recognized as a theorist of pedagogy and advocate of Marxism in the Vereinstag deutscher Arbeitervereine than as a forerunner to Neo-Kantianism. But his influence on the Marburg school, though brief, was incisive. He took his professorship at Marburg in 1872, one year before Cohen completed his Habilitationschrift there. Lange worked with Cohen for only three years before his untimely death in 1875.\n\nMuch of Lange\u2019s philosophy was conceived before his time in Marburg. As Privatdozent at Bonn, Lange attended Helmholtz\u2019s lectures on the physiology of the senses, and later came to agree that the best way to move philosophy along was by combining the general Kantian insights with a more firmly founded neuro-physiology. In his masterpiece, Geschichte des Materialismus und Kritik seiner Bedeutung in der Gegenwart (1866), Lange argues that materialism is at once the best explanation of phenomena, yet quite na\u00efve in its presumptive inference from experience to the world outside us. The argument is again taken from the progress of the physiological sciences, with Lange providing a number of experiments that reveal experience to be an aggregate construction of neural processes.\n\nWhere he progresses beyond Helmholtz is his recognition that the physiognomic processes themselves must, like every other object of experience, be understood as a product of a subject\u2019s particular constitution. Even while denying the given-ness of sense data, Helmholtz had too often presumed to understand the processes of sensation on the basis of a non-problematic empirical realism. That is, even while Helmholtz viewed knowledge of empirical objects as an aggregate of sense physiognomy, he never sufficiently reflected on the conditions for the experience of that very sense physiognomy. So even while visual experience is regarded as derivative from the physiognomy of the eyes, optic nerves, and brain, how each of these function is considered unproblematically given to empirical experience. For Lange, we cannot so confidently infer that our experience of physiognomic processes corresponds to what is really the case outside our experience of them\u2014that the eyes or ears actually do work as we observe them to\u2014since the argument by which that conclusion is reached is itself physiological. Neither the senses, nor the brain, nor the empirically observable neural processes between them permit the inference that any of these is the causal grounds of our experience of them.\n\nWith such skepticism, Lange would naturally dispense, too, with attempts to ground ethical norms in either theological or rationalistic frameworks. Our normative prescriptions, however seemingly unshakeable by pure practical reason, are themselves operations of a brain, which develop contingently over great spans of evolutionary history. That brain itself is only another experienced representation, nothing which can be considered an immutable and necessary basis of which universal norms could be considered derivative. Lange thought this opened a space for creative narratives and even myths, able to inspire rather than regulate the ethical side of human behavior. Through their mutual philology teacher at Bonn, Friedrich Ritschl, Lange was also a decisive influence on the epistemology and moral-psychology of Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nThe progenitors of Neo-Kantianism, represented principally by Liebmann, Fischer, Trendelenburg, Helmholtz, and Lange, evince a preference for Kant\u2019s theoretical rather than ethical or aesthetical writings. While this tendency would be displaced by both the Marburg school\u2019s social concerns and the Baden school\u2019s concentration on the logic of values, the proto-Neo-Kantians had definite repercussions for later figures like Hans Vaihinger (1852-1933), the so-called empirio-positivists like Richard Avenarius and Ernst Mach, and the founder of the Vienna Circle, Moritz Schlick (1882-1936).\n\n2. Marburg\n\nHerman Cohen (1842-1918) was Lange\u2019s friend and successor, and is usually considered the proper founder of Neo-Kantianism at Marburg. The son of a rabbi in Coswig, he was given a diverse schooling by the historian of Judaism Zacharias Frankel (1801-1875) and the philologist Jacob Bernays (1824-1881). Moving to Berlin, he studied philosophy under Trendelenburg, philology under August Boeckh (1785-1867), culture and linguistics with Heymann Steinthal (1823-1899), and physiology with Emil Du Bois-Reymond (1818-1896). One of his earliest papers, \u201cZur Controverse zwischen Trendelenburg und Kuno Fischer\u201d (1871), was a sort of coming-out in academic society. Against Fischer, the attempt above all to understand the letter of Kant perfectly \u2013even the problems that persisted in his work\u2014was tantamount to historicizing what ought to be a living engagement with serious philosophical problems. Although roughly on the side of his teacher Trendelenburg, Cohen stood mostly on his own ground in denying that objectivity required any appeal to extra-mental objects. Granted a professorship at the University of Marburg in 1876, Cohen came to combine Kant-interpretation with Lange\u2019s instinct to develop Kant\u2019s thinking in light of contemporary developments: a \u201cVerbindung der systematischen und historischen Aufgabe.\u201d It was Cohen who published Lange\u2019s Logische Studien (1877) posthumously and produced several new editions of his Geschichte des Materialismus. More interested in logic than science, however, Cohen took Lange\u2019s initiatives in a decidedly epistemological direction.\n\nCohen\u2019s early work consists mainly in critical engagements with Kant: Kants Theorie der Erfahrung (1871), Kants Begr\u00fcndung der Ethik (1877), and Kants Begr\u00fcndung der Aesthetik (1889). Where he progresses beyond Kant is most plainly in his attempt to overcome the Kantian dualism between intuition and discursive thinking. Cohen argues that formal a priori laws of the mind not only affect how we think about external objects, but actually constitute those objects for us. \u201cThinking produces that which is held to be\u201d (Logik der reinen Erkenntnis [Berlin 1902], 67). That is, the laws of the mind not only provide the form but the content of experience, leaving Cohen with a more idealistic picture of experience than Kant\u2019s empirical realism would have warranted. These laws lie beyond, as it were, both Kant\u2019s conceptual categories as well as Helmholtz\u2019s and Lange\u2019s physiognomic processes, the latter of which Cohen considered unwarrantedly naturalistic. The transcendental conditions of experience lay in the most fundamental rules of mathematical thinking, such that metaphysics, properly understood, is the study of the laws that make possible mathematical, and by derivation, scientific thinking. While Cohen did not deny the importance of the categories of the understanding or of the necessity of sensuous processes within experience, his own advancement beyond these entailed that an object was experienced and only could be experienced in terms of the formal rules of mathematics. The nature of philosophical investigation becomes, in Cohen\u2019s hands, neither a physiognomic investigation of the brain or senses as persistent \u2018things\u2019 nor a transcendental deduction of the concepts of the understanding and the necessary faculties of the mind, but an exposition of the a priori rules that alone make possible any and every judgment. The world itself is the measure of all possible experience.\n\nThe view had a radical implication for the notion of a Kantian self. Kant never much doubted that something persistent was the fundament on which judgment was constructed. He denied that this thing was understandable in the way either materialism or commonsense presumed, of course, but posited a transcendental unity of apperception as, at least, the logically-necessary ground for experience. Cohen replaces the \u2018unity\u2019 of a posited self, and indeed any \u2018faculties\u2019 of the mind, with a variety of \u2018rules\u2019, \u2018methods\u2019, and \u2018procedures\u2019. What we are is not a \u2018thing\u2019, but a series of logical acts. The importance of his view can be illustrated in terms of Cohen\u2019s theoretical mathematics, especially his notions of continuity and the infinitesimally small. Neither of these is an object, obviously, in the views of materialists or empiricists. And even idealists were at pains to decipher how either could be represented. By treating both as rules for thinking rather than persistent things, Cohen was able to show their respective necessities in terms of what sorts of everyday experiences would be made impossible without them. Continuity becomes an indispensable rule for thinking about any objects in time, while the infinitesimally smallest thing becomes an indispensable rule for thinking about the composition of objects in space. Though a substantial departure from the Kantian ascription of faculties, Cohen never prided himself so much on ascertaining and propagating the conclusions of Kant as on applying Kant\u2019s transcendental method to its sincerest conclusions.\n\nLike his Marburg colleagues, Cohen is sometimes unfairly cast as an aloof logical hair-splitter. Quite the contrary, he was deeply engaged in ethics as well as in the social and cultural debates of his time. His approach to them is also based on a generally Kantian methodology, which he sometimes dubbed a \u2018social idealism\u2019. Dismissing the practical and applied aspects of Kant\u2019s ethics as needlessly individualistic psychology, he stressed the importance of Kant\u2019s project of grounding ethical laws in practical reason, therein presenting for the first time a transcendentally necessary ought. This necessity holds for humanity generally, insofar as humanity is considered generally and not in terms of the privileges or disadvantages of particular individuals. Virtues like truthfulness, honor, and justice, which relate to the concept of humanity, thus take priority over sympathy or empathy, which operate on particular individuals and their circumstances. Like both experience and ethical life, civil laws could only be justified insofar as they were necessary, in terms of their intersubjective determinability. Because class-strata effectually inculcate authoritative relationships of power, a democratic \u2013or better\u2014 a socialist society that effaced autocratically decreed legal dicta would better fulfill Kant\u2019s exhortation to treat people as ends rather than means, as both legislators and legislated at the same time. However, Cohen thought that then-contemporary socialist ideals put too much stock in the economic aspects of Marx\u2019s theory, and in their place tried to instill a greater concentration on the spiritual and cultural side of human social life. Cohen\u2019s grounding of socialism in a Kantian rather than Marxist framework thus circumvents some of its statist and materialist overtones, as Lange also tried to do in his 1865 Die Arbeiterfrage.\n\nHermann Cohen also remains important for his contributions to Jewish thought. In proportion to his decreasing patriotism in Germany, he became an increasingly unabashed stalwart of Judaism in his later writing, and indeed is still considered by many to be the greatest Jewish thinker of his century. After his retirement from Marburg in 1912, he taught at the Berlin Lehranstalt f\u00fcr die Wissenschaft des Judentums. His posthumous Die Religion der Vernunft aus den Quellen des Judentums (1919) maintains that the originally Jewish method of religious thinking \u2013its monotheism\u2014 reveals it as a \u201creligion of reason,\u201d a systematic and methodological attempt to think through the mysteries of the natural world and to construct a universal system of morality ordered under a single universal divine figure. As such, religion is not simply an ornament to society or a mere expression of feelings, but an entirely intrinsic aspect of human culture. The grand summation of these various strands of his thought was to have been collated into a unified theory of culture, but only reached a planning stage before his death in 1918. Even had he completed it, Cohen\u2019s fierce advocacy of socialism and fiercer defense of Judaism, especially in Germany, would have made an already adverse academic life increasingly difficult.\n\nCohen\u2019s student Paul Natorp (1854-1924) was a trained philologist, a renowned interpreter of Plato and of Descartes, a composer, a mentor to Pasternak, Barth, and Cassirer, and an influence on the thought of Husserl, Heidegger, and Gadamer. Arriving at Marburg in 1881, much of Natorp\u2019s career was concerned with widening the sphere of influence of Cohen\u2019s interpretation of Kant and with tracing the historical roots of what he understood to be the essence of critical philosophy. For Natorp, too, the necessity of Neo-Kantian philosophizing lie in overcoming the speculations of the idealists and in joining philosophy again with natural science by means of limiting discourse to that which lay within the bounds of possible experience, in overcoming the Kantian dualism of intuition and discursive thinking.\n\nHowever close their philosophies, Natorp stresses more indelibly the experiential side of thinking than did Cohen\u2019s concentration on the logical features of thought. Natorp saw it as a positive advance on Kant to articulate the formal rules of scientific inquiry not as a set of axioms, but as an exposition of the rules\u2014the methods for thinking scientifically\u2014to the extreme that the importance of the conclusions reached by those rules becomes subsidiary to the rules themselves. Knowledge is an \u2018Aufgabe\u2019 or task, guided by logic, to make the undetermined increasingly more determined. Accordingly, the Kantian \u2018thing-itself\u2019 ceases to be an object that lies outside possible experience, but a sort of regulative ideal that of itself spurs the understanding to work towards its fulfillment. That endless call to new thinking along specifically ordered lines is just what Natorp means by scientific inquiry\u2014a normative requirement to think further rather than a set of achieved conclusions. Thus, where Kant began with a transcendental logic in order to ground math and the natural sciences, Natorp began with the modes of thinking found already in the experimental processes of good science and the deductions of mathematics as evidence of what conditions are necessarily at play in thinking generally. The necessities of math and science do not rest, as they arguably do for Kant, upon the psychological idiosyncrasies of the rational mind, but are self-sufficient examples of what constitutes objective thinking. Thus philosophy itself, as Natorp conceived it, does not begin with the psychological functions of a rational subject and work towards its products. It begins with a critical observation of those objectively real formations\u2014mathematical and scientific thinking\u2014to ground how the mind itself must have worked in order to produce them.\n\nOne of the consequences of Natorp\u2019s concentration on the continual process of methodological thinking was his acknowledgement that a proper exposition of its laws required an historical basis. Science, as the set of formal rules for thinking, begins to inquire by reflecting on why a thing is, not just that it is. Whenever that critical reflection on the methods of scientific thinking occurs, there ensues a sort of historical rebirth that generates a new cyclical age of scientific inquiry. This reflection, Natorp thought, involves rethinking how one considers that object: a genetic rather than static reflection on the changing conditions for the possibility of thinking along the lines of the continuing progress of science.\n\nPlato\u2019s notion of ideal forms marks the clearest occasion of \u2013to borrow Kuhn\u2019s designation for a similar notion\u2014a paradigm shift. Under Natorp\u2019s interpretation, Plato\u2019s forms are construed not as real subsistent entities that lie beyond common human experience, but regulative hypotheses intended to guide thinking along systematic lines. No transcendent things per se, the forms are transcendental principles about the possibility of the human experience of objects. In this sense, Natorp presented Plato as a sort of Marburg Neo-Kantian avant le lettre, a view which garnered little popularity.\n\nLike Cohen, Natorp also had significant cultural interests, and thought that the proper engagement with Kant\u2019s thought had the potential to lead to a comprehensive philosophy of culture. Not as interested as Cohen in the philosophy of religion, it is above all in Natorp\u2019s pedagogical writings that he espouses a social-democratic, anti-dogmatic ideal of education, the goal of which was not an orthodox body of knowledge but an attunement to the lines along which we think so as to reach knowledge. Education ought to be an awareness of the \u2018Aufgabe\u2019 of further determining the yet undetermined. Accordingly, the presentation of information in a lecture was thought to be intrinsically stilting, in comparison to the guided process of a quasi-Socratic method of question and answer. An educator of considerable skill, among his students were Karl Vorl\u00e4nder (1860-1928), Nicolai Hartmann (1882-1950), Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset (1883-1955), and Boris Pasternak (1890-1960).\n\nErnst Cassirer (1874-1945) is usually considered the last principle figure of the Marburg school of Neo-Kantianism. Entering Marburg to study with Cohen himself in 1896, though he would never teach there, Cassirer adopted both the school\u2019s historicist leanings and its emphasis on transcendental argumentation. Indeed, he stands as one of the last great comprehensive thinkers of the West, equal parts epistemologist, logician, philosopher of science, cultural theorist, and historian of thought. His final work, written after having immigrated to America in the wake of Nazi Germany, wove together Cohen\u2019s defense of Judaism together with his own observations of the fascist employment of mythic symbolism to form a comprehensive critique of the Myth of the State (published posthumously in 1946). His wide interests were not accidental, but a direct consequence of his lifelong attempt to show the logical and creative aspects of human life \u2013the Naturwissenschaften and Geisteswissenschaften\u2014 as integrally entwined within the characteristically human mode of mentality: the symbolic form.\n\nCassirer\u2019s earlier historical works adopt the basic view of history promulgated by Natorp. The development of the history of ideas takes the form of na\u00efve progresses interrupted by a series of fundamental reconsiderations of the epistemological methods that gave rise to those progresses, through Plato, Galileo, Spinoza, Leibniz, and Kant. Like Natorp, too, the progress of the history of ideas is, for Cassirer, the march of the problems and solutions constructed by the naturally progressive structure of the human mind. Despite this seemingly teleological framework, Cassirer\u2019s histories of the Enlightenment, of Modernity, of Goethe, Rousseau, Descartes, and of epistemology are generally reliable, lucidly written expositions that aim to contextualize an author\u2019s own thought rather than squeeze it into any particular historiographical framework. A sort of inverse of Hegel, for Cassirer the history of ideas is not reducible to an a priori necessary structure brought about by the nature of reason, but reliable evidence upon which to examine the progression of what problems arise for minds over time.\n\nCassirer\u2019s historicism also led him to rethink Cohen\u2019s notion of the subject. As Cohen thought the self was just a logical placeholder, the subject-term of the various rules of thinking, so Cassirer thought the self was a function that united the various symbolic capacities of the human mind. Yet, that set is not static. What the history of mathematics shows is not a timeless set of a priori rules that can in principle be deciphered within a philosophical logic, but a slow yet fluid shift over time. This is possible, Cassirer argued, because mathematical rules are tied neither to any experience of objects nor to any timeless notion of a context-less subject. Ways of thinking shift over time in response to wider environmental factors, and so do the mathematical and logical forms thereby. Einstein\u2019s relativity theory, of which Cassirer was an important promulgator, underscores Cassirer\u2019s insights especially in its assumption of non-Euclidean geometry. Put into the language of Cassirer\u2019s mature thought, the logical model on which Einsteinian mathematics was based is itself an instantiation not of the single correct outlook on the world, but of a powerful new shift in the symbolic form of science. What Einstein accomplished was not just another theory in a world full of theories, but the remarkably concise formula for a modified way of thinking about the physical world.\n\nThe complete expression of Cassirer\u2019s own philosophy is his three-volume Philosophie der symbolischen Formen (1923-9). In keeping with a general Kantianism, Cassirer argues that the world is not given as such in human experience, but mediated by subject-side factors. Cassirer thought that more complex structures constituted experience and the human necessity to think along certain pre-given lines. What Cassirer adds is a much greater historical sensitivity to earlier forms of human thinking as they were represented in myths and early religious expressions. The more complex and articulate forms of culture \u2013the three major ones are language, myth, and science\u2014 are not a priori necessary across time or cultures, but are achieved by a sort of dialectical solution to problems arising when other cultural forms become unsustainable. Knowledge for Cassirer, unlike Natorp, is not so much the process of determination, but a web of psycho-linguistic relations. The human mind progresses over history through linguistic and cultural forms, from the affective expressions of primitives, to representational language, which situates objects in spatial and temporal relations, to the purely logical and mathematical forms of signification. The unique human achievement is the symbolic form, an energy of the intellect that binds a particular sensory signal to a meaningful general content. By means of symbols, humans not only navigate the world empirically and not only understand the world logically, but make the world meaningful to themselves culturally. This symbolic capacity is indeed what separates the human species from the animals. Accordingly, Cassirer saw himself as having synthesized the Neo-Kantian insights about subjectivity with the roughly Hegelian-themed phenomenology of conscious forms.\n\n3. Baden\n\nThe intellectual pride of the Marburg school fostered a prickly relationship with their fellow neo-Kantians. The rivalry developed with the Baden Neo-Kantians (alternately named the \u201cSouthwest\u201d school) was not so much a competition for the claim to doctrinal orthodoxy as much as what the proper aims and goals of Kant-studies should be. Although it is a generalization, where the Marburg Neo-Kantians sought clarity and methodological precision, the Baden school endeavored to explore wider applications of Kantian thought to contemporary cultural issues. Like their Marburg counterparts, they concerned themselves with offering a third, critical path between speculative idealism and materialism, but turned away from how science or mathematics were grounded in the logic of the mind toward an investigation of the human sciences and the transcendental conditions of values. While they paid greater attention to the spiritual and cultural side of human life than the Marburg school, they were less active in the practical currents of political activity.\n\nWilhelm Windelband (1848-1915), a student of Kuno Fischer and Hermann Lotze (1817-1881), set the tone of the school by claiming that to truly understand Kant was not a matter of philological interpretation\u2013per Fischer\u2014nor a return to Kant\u2013per Liebmann\u2014but of surpassing Kant along the very path he had blazed. Never an orthodox Kantian, he originally said \u201cKant verstehen, hei\u00dft \u00fcber ihn hinausgehen.\u201d Part of that effort sprung from Kant\u2019s distinction between different kinds of judgment as being appropriate to different forms of inquiry. Whereas the Marburg school\u2019s conception of logic was steeped in Kant, Windleband found certain elements of Fichte, Hegel, and Lotze to be fruitful. Moreover, the Marburgers too-hastily applied theoretical judgment to all fields of intellectual investigation summarily, and thereby conflated the methods of natural science with proper thinking as such. This effectively relegated the so-called cultural sciences, like history, sociology, and the arts \u2013 Geisteswissenschaften \u2013 to a subsidiary intellectual rank behind logic, mathematics, and the natural science \u2013 Naturwissenschaften. Windelband thought, on the contrary, that these two areas of inquiry had a separate but equal status. To show that, Windelband needed to prove the methodological rigor of those Geisteswissenschaften, something which had been a stumbling block since the Enlightenment. In a distinctly Kantian vein, he was able to show that the conditions for the possibility of judging the content of any of the Geisteswissenschaften took the shape of idiographic descriptions, which focus on the particular, unique, and contingent. The natural sciences, on the other hand, are generalizing, law-positing, and nomothetic. Idiographic descriptions are intended to inform, nomothetic explanations to demonstrate. The idiographic deals in Gestaltungen, the nomothetic in Gesetze. Both are equally parts of the human endeavor.\n\nThe inclination to seek a more multifaceted conception of subjectivity was a hallmark of the Baden Neo-Kantians. The mind is not a purely mathematical or logical function designed to construct laws and apply them to the world of objects; it works in accordance with the environment in which it operates. What is constructed is done as a response to a need generated by that socio-cultural-historical background. This notion was a sort of leitmotif to Windelband\u2019s own history of philosophy, which for the first time addressed philosophers organically in terms of the philosophical problems they faced and endeavored to solve rather than as either a straightforward chronology, a series of schools, or, certainly, a sort of Hegelian conception of a graduated dialectical unfolding of a single grand idea.\n\nHeinrich Rickert (1863-1936) began his career with a concentration on epistemology. Alongside many Neo-Kantians, he denied the cogency of a thing itself, and thereby reduced an ontology of externalities to a study of the subjective contents of a common, universal mind. Having dissertated under Windelband in 1888 and succeeding him at Heidelberg in 1916, Rickert also came to reject the Marburger\u2019s assumption that the methodologies of natural science were the rules for thinking as such. Rickert argued instead that the mind engages the world along the dual lines of Geisteswissenschaften and Naturwissenschaften according to idiographic or nomothetic judgments respectively, the division which Rickert borrowed from his friend Windelband and elaborated upon (although it is sometimes attributed to Rickert or even Dilthey mistakenly). And similar to him as well, Rickert considered it a major project of philosophy to ground the former in a critical method, as a sort of transcendental science of culture. Where Rickert went his own way was in his critique of scientific explanations insofar as they rested on abstracted generalizations and in his privilege of historical descriptions on account of their attention to life\u2019s genuine particularity and the often irrational character of historical change. Where Windelband saw equality-but-difference between the Geistes\u2014and Naturwissenschaften, Rickert saw the latter as deficient insofar as it was incapable of addressing values.\n\nHistory, for Rickert, was the exemplary case of a human science. Historians write about demonstrable facts in time and space, wherein the truth or falsity of a claim can be demonstrated with roughly the same precision as the natural sciences. The relational links between historical events \u2013 causes, influences, consequences \u2013 rely on mind-centered concepts rather than on observable features of a world outside the historian; though this of itself would not preclude the possibility of at least phenomenal explanations of history. More importantly, historians deal with events which cannot be isolated, repeated, or tested, particular individuals whose actions cannot be subsumed under generalizations, and with human values which resist positive nomothetic explanation. Those values constitute the essence of an historiographical account in a way entirely foreign to the physical sciences, whose objects of inquiry \u2013 atoms, gravitational forces, chemical bonds, etc.\u2014remain value-neutral. A historian passes judgment about the successes and failures of policies, assigns titular appellations from Alexander the Great to Ivan the Terrible, decides who is king and who a tyrant, and regards eras as contributions or hindrances to human progress. The values of historians essentially comprise what story is told about the past, even if this sacrifices history\u2019s status as an exact, demonstrable, or predictive science.\n\nRickert\u2019s differentiation of the methods of history and science has been influential on post-modern continental theorists, in part through his friend and colleague, Karl Jaspers (1883-1969), and through his doctoral student, Martin Heidegger (1889-1976). The traditional scientific reliance on a correspondential theory of truth seemed woefully uncritical and thereby inadequate to the cultural sciences. The very form of reality should be understood as a product of a subject\u2019s judgment. However, Rickert\u2019s recognition of this subjective side did not entangle him in value relativism. Although the historian\u2019s values, for example, do indeed inform the account, Rickert also thought that values were nothing exclusively personal. Values, in fact, express proximate universals across cultures and eras. Philosophy itself, as a critical inquiry into the values that inform judgment, reveals the endurance and trans-cultural nature of values in such a way that grounds the objectivity of an historical account in the objectivity of the values he or she holds. That truth is something that \u2018ought to be sought\u2019 is perhaps one such value. But Rickert has been criticized for believing that the values of historians on issues of personal ethics, the defensibility of wars, the treatment of women, or the social effects of religion were universally agreed upon.\n\n4. Associated Members\n\nTwentieth-century attempts to categorize thinkers historically into this or that school led to some debate about which figures were \u2018really\u2019 Neo-Kantian. But this overlooks the fact that even until the mid-1880\u2019s the term \u2018Neo-Kantian\u2019 was rarely self-appellated. Unlike other more tightly-knit schools of thought, the nature of the Neo-Kantian movement allowed for a number of loosely-associated members, friends, and students, who were seekers of truth first and proponents of a doctrine second. Although each engaged the basic terminology and transcendental framework of either Kant or the Neo-Kantians, none did so wholesale or uncritically.\n\nHans Vaihinger (1852-1933) remains arguably the best scholar of Kant after Fischer and Cohen. And he probably maintained the closest ties with Neo-Kantianism without being assimilated into one or the other school. His massive commentary, begun in 1881 and left unfinished due to his health, exposited not only Kant\u2019s work, but also the history of Neo-Kantian interpretation to that point. He founded the Kant-Studien in 1897, which is both the worldwide heart of Kant studies and the model for all author-based periodicals published in philosophy. Vaihinger\u2019s own philosophy, which resonates in contemporary debates about fictionalism and anti-realism, takes as its starting point a curious blend of Kant, Lange, and Nietzsche in his Die Philosophie des Als-Ob (1911). For Vaihinger, the expressions that stem from our subjective makeup render moot the question whether they correspond to the real world. Not only do the concepts of math and logic have a subjective source, as per many of the Neo-Kantians, but the claims of religion, ethics, and even philosophy turn out to be subjectively-generated illusions that are found to be particularly satisfying to certain kinds of life, and thereafter propagated for the sake of more successfully navigating an unconceptualizable reality in-itself. Human psychology is structured to behave \u2018as-if\u2019 these concepts and mental projections corresponded to the way things really were, though in reality there is no way to prove whether they do. Freedom, a key notion for Vaihinger, is not merely one side of a misunderstanding between reason and the understanding, but a useful projection without which we could neither act nor live.\n\nWilhelm Dilthey (1833-1911) remains alongside Vaihinger as one of the great patrons of Kant scholarship for his work on the Academy Edition of Kant\u2019s works, which began in 1900. Taught by both Fischer in Heidelberg and Trendelenburg in Berlin, Dilthey was strongly influenced by the hermeneutics of Schleiermacher as well, and entwines his Neo-Kantian denial of material realism with the hermeneutical impulse to see judgment as socio-culturally informed interpretation. Dilthey shares with the Baden school the distinction between nomothetic and idiographic sciences. Where he stresses the distinction, though, is slightly different. The natural sciences explain by way of causal relationships, whereas history makes understood by correctly associating particulars and wholes. In this way, the practice of history itself allows us to better understand the Lebenzusammenhang \u2013how all life\u2019s aspects are interconnected\u2014in a way the natural sciences, insofar as they treat the objects of their study as abstract generalizations, cannot. The natural sciences utilize an abstract Verstand; the cultural sciences use a more holistic way of understanding, a Verstehen.\n\nDespite his shared interest in the conditions of experience, Dilthey is usually not considered a Neo-Kantian. Among several key differences, he rejects the Marburg proclivity to construct laws of thinking and experience that supposedly hold for all rational beings. Their consideration of the self as a set of logico-mathematical rules was an illegitimate abstraction from the really-lived, historically-contextualized human experience. In its place he stresses the ways historicity and social contexts shape the experiences and thinking processes of unique individuals. In distinction from the Baden school, Dilthey rejects Rickert\u2019s theses about both the necessarily phenomenal and universal character of historical experience. Since we have unmediated access to our lived inner life through a sort of \u2018reflexive awareness\u2019, our explanations of historical events may indeed require a degree of generalization and abstraction; however, our sympathetic awareness of agent\u2019s motivations and intentions remains direct. That inner world is not representational or inferential, but \u2013 contrary to the natural sciences \u2013 lived from within our inter-contextualized experience of the world. In this way, Dilthey alsocrossed the mainstay Neo-Kantian position on the role of psychology in the human sciences. It is not a field alongside sociology or economics that requires a transcendental grounding in order to gain a nomothetic status. Psychology is an immediate descriptive science that alone enables the other Geisteswissenschaften to be understood properly as a sort of mediation between the individual and their social milieu. Dilthey thought the results of psychology will, contra Windelband, allow us to move beyond a purely idiographic description of individuals to a law-like (though not strictly nomothetic) typology according to worldviews or \u2018Weltanschauungen\u2019.\n\nMax Weber (1864-1920) was a student and friend of Rickert\u2019s in Freiburg, and was also concerned with distinguishing the logic of historical judgment from that of the natural sciences. The past itself contains no intelligibility. Intelligibility is something added by means of the historian\u2019s act of contextualizing an individual in his or her social environment. Unlike Comte (1798-1857), whatever \u2018laws\u2019 we might discover in history are really just constructions. And unlike Durkheim (1858-1917), talk of \u2018societies\u2019 runs the risk of hypostasizing what is actually a convenient symbol. Social history should instead be about trying to understand the motivations behind individual and particular changes.\n\nThe sociology of Georg Simmel (1858-1918) was also informed by a personal connection to Rickert. From its foundation by Comte and Mill (1806-1873), sociology had been marked by both a positivist theory of explanation-under-law and by an uncritical empiricism. Simmel, with the familiar Neo-Kantian move, undermined their naivety and replaced it with a more careful consideration of how society could be conceived at all. How do individuals relate to society, in what sense does society have a sort of psychology in its own right that generates changes and out of which spiritual shifts emerge, and how do the representational faculties affect societal rituals like money, fashion, and the construction of cities?\n\nTaking history away from its sociological orientation and back to its conceptual roots was Emil Lask (1875-1915). Having dissertated on Fichte under Rickert in 1902 and habilitated on legal theory under Windelband in 1905, Lask was called to Heidelberg in 1910, where his inaugural lecture \u2013\u201cHegel in seinem Verh\u00e4ltnis zur Weltanschauung der Aufkl\u00e4rung\u201d\u2014 intimated a rather different line of influence. His work is comprised of two major published titles: Logik der Philosophie oder die Kategorienlehre (1911) and Lehre vom Urteil (1912). In them, Lask works out an immediate-intuitional theory of knowledge that went beyond the Kantian categories of the understanding of objects into the realm of a logic of values, and even probed the borders of the irrational. In fact he criticized the generalities of the Baden school\u2019s Problemsgeschichte for lacking a concrete grounding in actual historical movements. Although Lask\u2019s insistence to fight on the eastern front in the First World War cut short what should have been a promising career, he had significant influence on German philosophy through Weber, Luk\u00e1cs, and Heidegger. His death, in the same year as Windelband\u2019s, stands as the usual endpoint of the Baden school of Neo-Kantianism.\n\nThe physiognomic leanings of the Neo-Kantian forerunners, like Helmholtz and Lange, were revitalized by a pair of philosophers of considerable scientific reputation. Richard Avenarius (1843-96) and Ernst Mach (1838-1916), founders of empirio-criticism, sought to overcome the idealism-materialism rift in German academic philosophy by closer investigation into the nature of experience. This entailed replacing traditional physics with a phenomenalistic conception of thermodynamics as the model of positivist science. In his Kritik der reinen Erfahrung (1888-90), Avenarius showed that the physiognomic factors of experience vary according to environmental conditions. As the nervous system develops regular patterns within a relatively constant environment, experience itself becomes regularized. That feeling of being accustomed to typical experiences, rather than logical deduction, is what counts as knowledge. Mach was similarly critical of realist assumptions about sensation and experience, positing instead the mind\u2019s inherent ability to economize the welter of experience into abbreviated forms. Although the concepts we use, especially those in the natural sciences, are indispensable for communication and for navigating the world, they cannot demonstrate the substantial objects from which they are believed to be derived.\n\nAlois Riehl (1844-1924) denied Liebmann\u2019s claim that the Kantian thing-in-itself was nothing more than an incidental remnant of enlightenment rationalism. Were it, Riehl argued, Kantianism should give up any pretension to a positive engagement with science. Kant in fact never entirely rejected the possibility of apprehending the thing-in-itself, only the attempt to do so by way of the understanding and reason. It was not inconsistent with Kant to try to articulate noumena mediately, via indirect inferences from their perceptible characteristics in observation. Beyond its spatio-temporal and categorical qualifications, the particular characteristics of an object which we perceive and by which we distinguish it from any other object depend not on us so much, as upon its mode of appearance as it really is outside us.\n\nAlthough Rudolph Otto (1869-1937) taught in Marburg, he had little interest in the logic of mathematics per se. Otto did, however, follow his school\u2019s inclination to understand the objects of study in terms of the transcendental conditions of their experience as fundamental to the proper study, specifically of religion. What Otto discovered thereby was a new kind of experience \u2013the \u2018holy\u2019\u2014 that was irreducible either to the categories of the understanding or to feeling. This had a substantial influence on the religious phenomenology of two other loosely-associated Neo-Kantian thinkers, Ernst Troeltsch (1865-1923) and Paul Tillich (1886-1965).\n\nWith certain Hegelian overtones, Bruno Bauch (1877-1942) was another fringe member of the Baden school with much to say about religion. While he studied with Fischer in Heidelberg, Rickert in Freiburg, and wrote his Habilitationschrift under Vaihinger in Berlin, he was more concerned than most Badeners with logic and mathematics, and in this respect represents a key link between the Neo-Kantians and both Frege, his confidant, and Carnap, his student. But his views about religion and contemporary politics kept Bauch at considerable distance from mainline Neo-Kantians. Due, in fact to his overt anti-Semitism, he was made to resign his editorship at the Kant-Studien. Having argued that Jews were intrinsically foreign to German culture, his embrace of Nazism during the very period of Cassirer\u2019s emigration was an obvious affront, too, to the legacy of Cohen, whatever honors it may have gained him by the state-run academies.\n\nNicolai Hartmann (1882-1950) began his career as a Neo-Kantian under Cohen and Natorp, but soon after developed his own form of realism. While remaining largely beholden to transcendental semantics, Hartmann rejected the basic Neo-Kantian position on the priority of epistemology to ontology. The first condition for thinking about objects is itself the existence of those objects. It was an error of idealism to assume the human mind constitutes the knowability of those objects and equally the error of materialism to assume that those objects are all open to knowability. To Hartmann, some objects were able to be known by way of their appropriate categorization. Others, however, must remain mysterious, closed off to human inquiry at least until philosophy could point the way toward new methods of comprehending them. Philosophy\u2019s task, accordingly, was to discover the discontinuities between the \u2018subjective categories\u2019 of thought and the \u2018objective categories\u2019 of reality, and, where possible, to eventually overcome them.\n\nGiven the predominance of Neo-Kantianism in German academies during the turn of the century, a number of fringe-members deserve at least mention here. None can be considered an orthodox \u2018Marburg\u2019 or \u2018Southwestern\u2019 school Neo-Kantian, but each had certain affinities or at least critical engagements with the general movement. Friedrich Paulsen (1846-1908), Johannes Volkelt (1848-1930), Benno Erdmann (1851-1921), Rudolf Stammler (1856-1938), Karl Vorl\u00e4nder (1860-1928), the Harvard psychologist Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg (1863-1916), Ernst Troeltsch (1865-1923), the plant physiologist Jonas Cohn (1869-1947), Albert G\u00f6rland (1869-1952), Richard H\u00f6nigswald (1875-1947), Artur Buchenau (1879-1946), Eduard Spranger (1882-1963), and the neo-Friesian Leonard Nelson (1882-1927), who, though more critical than not about Neo-Kantian epistemology, shared certain ethical and social Neo-Kantian themes. There was also significant Neo-Kantian influence on French universities in the same years, with representative figures like Charles Renouview (1815-1903), Jules Lachelier (1832-1918), \u00c9mile Boutroux (1845-1921), Octave Hamelin (1856-1907), and L\u00e9on Brunschvicg (1869-1944). (For a more detailed look at French Neo-Kantians, see Luft and Capeill\u00e8res 2010, pp. 70-80.)\n\n5. Legacy\n\nFrom March 17 to April 6, 1929, the city of Davos, Switzerland hosted an International University Course intended to bring together the continent\u2019s best philosophers. The keynote lecturers and subsequent leaders of the famous disputation were the author of the recent Being and Time, Martin Heidegger, and the author of the recent Philosophy of Symbolic Forms, Ernst Cassirer. Heidegger\u2019s contribution was his interpretation of Kant as chiefly concerned with trying to ground metaphysical speculation in what he calls the transcendental imagination through temporally-finite human reason. Cassirer countered by revealing Heidegger\u2019s formulation of that imagination as unwarrantedly accepting of the non-rational. Agreeing that the progress of Kantian philosophy must acknowledge the finitude of human life, as Heidegger held, Cassirer emphasized that beyond this it must retain the spirit of critical inquiry, the openness to natural science, and the clarity of rational argumentation that marked Kant himself as a great philosopher and not only as an intuitive visionary. The Analytic philosopher Rudolf Carnap (1891-1970) was a participant in the Davos congress, and was thereafter prompted to write a highly critical review of Heidegger. What should have been an event that revitalized Neo-Kantianism in contemporary thought became instead the symbol both for the rise of the Analytic school of philosophy and for its cleavage from Continental thought. Increasingly, Cassirer was viewed as defending an unfashionable way of philosophizing, and after he emigrated from Germany in the wake of increasing anti-Jewish sentiment in 1933 the influence of Neo-Kantianism waned.\n\nEven while serious Kant scholarship thrives in the Anglophone world of the early 21st century, Neo-Kantianism remains perhaps the single worst-neglected region of the historical study of ideas. This is unfortunate for Kant studies, since it inculcates an attitude of offhandedness toward nearly a century of superb scholarship on Kant, from Fischer to Cohen to Vaihinger to Cassirer. The Neo-Kantians were also the single most dominant group in German philosophy departments for half a century. Few works of Cohen, Natorp, Rickert, or Windelband have been translated in their entirety, to say nothing of the less prominent figures. Cassirer and Dilthey have attracted the interest of solid scholars, though it tends to be historical and hermeneutical rather than programmatic. Study of Simmel and Weber has been consistently strong, but more for their sociological conclusions than their philosophical starting points. To the rest, it has become customary to attribute a secondary philosophy rank behind the Idealists, Marxists, and Positivists \u2013and even a tertiary one behind the Romantics, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Kierkegaard, none of whom, it may be reminded, held a professorship in the field. It is not uncommon even in lengthy histories of 19th Century philosophy to find their names omitted entirely.\n\nThe reasons for this neglect are complex and not entirely clear. The writing of the Marburg school is dense and academically forbidding, true, but that of Windelband, Cassirer, Vaihinger, and Simmel are quite eloquent. The personalities of Cohen and Rickert were eccentric to the point of unattractive, though Natorp and Cassirer were congenial. Their ad hominem criticisms of rival members seem crass, but such gossip is undeniably salacious as well. Some of their writing was intentionally set against the backdrop of obscure political developments, though often with other figures such obscurities give rise to cottage-industries of historical scholarship (see Willey, 1978). The two World Wars no doubt had a severely negative impact on the continuity of any movement or school, though phenomenology has fared far better. The fact that many of the Neo-Kantians were both social-liberals and Jewish virtually guaranteed their works would be repressed in Hitler\u2019s Germany. Forced resignation and even exile was a reality for many Jewish academics; Cassirer even had his habilitation at Stra\u00dfburg rejected explicitly on the grounds that he was Jewish. He and Brunschvicg both escaped likely persecution by giving up their homeland. But as the examples of Bauch and Fischer make clear, Neo-Kantianism need not be subsumed under a specifically Jewish or even minimally Semitically-tolerant worldview. And as Cohen\u2019s resurgent legacy in Jewish scholarship proves, not all aspects that were once repressed need forever be.\n\nTo ignore the Neo-Kantians, however, creates the false impression of a philosophical black hole in the German academies between the decline of Hegelianism and the rise of phenomenology, a space more often devoted to anti-academic philosophers like Kierkegaard and Nietzsche. Moreover, the Neo-Kantian influence on 20th century minds from Husserl and Heidegger to Frege and Carnap is pronounced, and should not be brushed aside lightly. In terms of early 21st century philosophy, Neo-Kantianism reminds us of the importance of reflecting on method and of philosophizing in conjunction with the best contemporary research in the natural sciences, something for which Helmholtz, Lange, and Cassirer stand as exemplars. And just as Liebmann\u2019s motto \u2018Back to Kant\u2019 was exhorted to bridge the gap between idealism and materialism in the 19th century, so too may it be a sort of third way that rectifies the split between contemporary continental and analytic partisanship. If the old saying still carries water, then \u201cone can philosophize with Kant, or against Kant; but one cannot philosophize without Kant.\u201d\n\nFortunately there are signs of renewed interest. In 2010, Luft and Rudolf Makkreel edited Neo-Kantianism in Contemporary Philosophy (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press), which presents a well-rounded contemporary collection of research papers. In Continental Europe, no one has done more to revitalize Neo-Kantian studies than Helmut Holzhey and Fabien Capeill\u00e8res, who have each published a row of books, editions, and papers on the theme. Under the directorship of Christian Krijnen and Kurt Walter Zeidler, the Desiderata der Neukantianismus-Forschung has hosted a number of congresses and meetings throughout Europe. A 2008 issue of the Philosophical Forum was dedicated to Neo-Kantianism generally, and featured articles by Rolf-Peter Horstmann, Paul Guyer, Michael Friedman, and Frederick Beiser among others. Studies of particular Neo-Kantians have been produced by Poma (1997), Krijnen (2001), Zijderveld (2006), Skildelsky (2008), and Munk (2010). And Charles Bambach (1995), Michael Friedmann (2000), Tom Rockmore (2000), and Peter Eli Gordon (2012) have composed fine works of intellectual history concerning the heritage of Neo-Kantianism in the twentieth century.\n\n6.

He returned to the subject throughout his life: philosophy and the humanities having as their object the achievements of the human brain, and scientific discovery having as its object the achievements of nature and the basic laws that control them [5]. He spent the third year of studies at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. In Strassburg, his interest in the medical sciences awakened through the lectures of the experimental pathologist Bernhard Naunyn (1839\u20131925) and the pharmacologist Oswald Schmiedeberg (1838\u20131921). He received his M.D. degree in 1896, and next worked as a resident in internal medicine in Frankfurt\u2019s St\u00e4dtisches Krankenhaus (municipal hospital) under Carl von Noorden (1858\u20131944).\n\nConsidering his education in biochemistry to be inadequate, he spent some months studying under the protein chemist Franz Hofmeister (1850\u20131922) in Strassburg, and in 1902 he took a temporary position at University College London under Ernest H. Starling (1866\u20131927) [6, 7]. A visit to Thomas R. Elliott (1877\u20131961), who was conducting his classical work on the action of epinephrine at the University of Cambridge, aroused in Loewi an interest in the autonomic nervous system [4].\n\nIn 1898, Loewi became an assistant to Hans Horst Meyer (1853\u20131939) in the Department of Pharmacology at Philipps University of Marburg. In 1900, he became a Privatdocent (lecturer), having completed the requirements for habilitation with a thesis on the metabolism of nuclein (Untersuchungen \u00fcber den Nucleinstoffwechsel), inspired by the discoverer of nucleic acid and protamine, Friedrich Miescher (1844\u20131895), whose writings were \u201ca kind of scientific bible,\u201d chiefly responsible for Loewi\u2019s choice of physiology as a calling [8].\n\nIn 1904, Meyer moved to the Pharmacological Institute of the University of Vienna, and a year later, Loewi joined him as associate professor; he became an Austrian citizen. His scientific interests centered around general, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism; diabetes; and renal function. In a study in 1902 (\u00dcber Eiweisssynthese im Thierkorper), he showed that dogs could synthesize proteins from amino acids. In Vienna, he discovered that the cardiac effects of digitalis glycosides were due to sensitization of the isolated frog heart to calcium, and also found that caffeine-induced diuresis could be explained by a vasodilatory effect on renal vessels. With Alfred Fr\u00f6hlich, he demonstrated that small doses of cocaine potentiated the responses of sympathetically innervated organs to epinephrine and sympathetic nerve stimulation, such as arterial blood pressure, urinary bladder relaxation, salivary secretion, and pupillary dilatation [1, 9].\n\nIn 1909, Loewi occupied the chair of pharmacology at Charles Francis University of Graz and, in 1923, he received the title of court councilor (Hofrat) [6]. In Graz, he demonstrated for the first time the chemical transmission of effects from the nerve endings of the autonomic nervous system [2]. It was published in Pfl\u00fcgers Archiv f\u00fcr die Gesamte Physiologie (\u00dcber humorale \u00dcbertragbarkeit der Herznervenwirkung, 1921/1922). Loewi showed that the vagus nerve worked by means of a chemical substance. After stimulating the vagus of an isolated frog\u2019s heart that contained Ringer\u2019s solution, he could produce a slowing effect on a second denervated heart by transferring the Ringer\u2019s solution from the first heart to it. He named the hypothetical substance Vagusstoff, which was later found to be acetylcholine.\n\nIn 1877, Emil du Bois-Reymond (1818\u20131896) in Berlin had theorized that nerve cells might communicate either through a \u201cstimulatory secretion\u201d or as an \u201celectrical phenomenon\u201d [10, 11]. Loewi\u2019s critical experiment unambiguously pointed to chemical transmission [10]. In his work, he credited several British scientists, including Thomas R. Elliott, William M. Bayliss (1860\u20131924), Reid Hunt (1870\u20131948), Walter E. Dixon (1871\u20131931), and Arthur Ewins (1882\u20131957), who had contributed previously to the concept that sympathetic nerves might work through the release of epinephrine [7, 10, 12].\n\nLoewi\u2019s subsequent research established the identities of Vagusstoff as acetylcholine, and of Acceleransstoff, the excitatory molecule that transmitted nerve impulses in the sympathetic ganglia of amphibians, as norepinephrine [7, 13]. By the time he delivered the Ferrier Lecture to the Royal Society in 1935, a year before winning the Nobel Prize, he still preferred to discuss the \u201chumoral\u201d transmission of nervous impulses [14]. In his later work, he adopted the term \u201cchemical transmission\u201d [15].\n\nIn 1914, Dale had discovered acetylcholine in a sample of the fungus Claviceps purpurea, commonly known as ergot [7]. His group extended the concept of cholinergic transmission to the neuromuscular junction, somatic motor fibers, and tracts of the central nervous system [12, 13]. Vagusstoff (acetylcholine) was the first neurotransmitter ever identified. These historical findings opened the way to additional studies and ultimately extended the list of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators to the dozens that were discovered later in the twentieth century, including monoamines, amino acids, polypeptides, purines, and nitric oxide [9]. In all, the work of Loewi and Dale formed the foundation for subsequent experiments that led to the elucidation of the cellular mechanisms of neuronal communication in the synaptic junction by Sir John C. Eccles (1903\u20131997) and other notable neurobiologists [2, 7, 11].\n\nIn March 1938, immediately after the Anschluss of Austria into the Third Reich, the 65-year-old Loewi and two of his sons were arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned. Attendants of the International Physiological Congress in Z\u00fcrich signed letters trying to get Loewi released [7]. This happened 2 months later. All his possessions were confiscated and he was expelled from Austria\u2014he was even forced to transfer the money he received with the Nobel Prize from the Swedish bank in Stockholm to a Nazi-controlled bank [1].\n\nAfter spending some time as a visiting professor at the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, the Nuffield Institute in Oxford, and the University of Leeds, Loewi accepted an offer in 1940 by George B. Wallace (1874\u20131948) for an appointment as tenured research professor of pharmacology at New York University College of Medicine. He spent the summers at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, and retired in 1955.\n\nLoewi held honorary degrees from New York University, Yale University, and the Universities of Graz and Frankfurt. He received the Physiology Prize of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Bologna, the Lieben Prize of the Academy of Vienna, and the Cameron Prize of the University of Edinburgh; he was made an honorary member of the Physiological Society in London, the Harvey Society in New York, and the Italian Society of Experimental Biology in Napoli; and he was a corresponding member of the Vienna Medical Association, the Vienna Biological Society, and the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina [1]. The honor that he valued as much as the Nobel Prize was his admission as a foreign member into the Royal Society of London in April 1954 [9].\n\nLoewi was naturalized as an American citizen in 1946. His last autobiographical sketch [8] was published in the autumn of 1960. He died in New York City on 25 December 1961. Stephen W. Kuffler (1913\u20131980) reflected on his close friendship with Loewi and described how his spirit soared to the end, despite physical restrictions due to ill health [3]. In April 1962, the director of the Woods Hole Laboratory arranged for the reinterment of Loewi\u2019s ashes at the yard of the Church of the Messiah. In a memoir, Dale included a complete bibliography of Loewi\u2019s 150 published works, written between 1896 and 1960 [2]."}, {"url": "https://philpapers.org/rec/WINKFG", "page_content": "Added to PP\n\n2015-02-13\n\n\n\nDownloads\n\n0\n\n\n\n6 months\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical graph of downloads\n\n\n\nSorry, there are not enough data points to plot this chart.\n\nHow can I increase my downloads?"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62364014-kuno-fischer", "page_content": "Jump to ratings and reviews\n\nNo one has reviewed this book yet.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nAbout the author\n\nWant to read\n\nWant to read\n\nWant to read\n\nWant to read\n\nCan't find what you're looking for?"}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/windelband-wilhelm-1848-1915", "page_content": "WINDELBAND, WILHELM\n\n(1848 \u2013 1915)\n\nThe German philosopher and historian of philosophy Wilhelm Windelband was born in Potsdam and educated at Jena, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen. He taught philosophy at Z\u00fcrich, Freiburg im Breisgau, Strasbourg, and Heidelberg. He was a disciple of Rudolf Hermann Lotze and Kuno Fischer and was the leader of the so-called southwestern German (or Baden) school of neo-Kantianism. He is best known for his work in history of philosophy, to which he brought a new mode of exposition\u2014the organization of the subject by problems rather than by chronological sequence of individual thinkers. As a systematic philosopher he is remembered for his attempt to extend the principles of Kantian criticism to the historical sciences, his attempt to liberate philosophy from identification with any specific scientific discipline, and his sympathetic appreciation of late nineteenth-century philosophy of value.\n\nWindelband believed that whereas the various sciences (mathematical, natural, and historical) have specific objects and limit their investigations to determined areas of the total reality, philosophy finds its unique object in the knowledge of reality provided by these various disciplines taken together as a whole. The task of philosophy, he held, was to explicate the a priori bases of science in general. The aim of philosophy was to show not how science is possible but why there are many different kinds of science; the relationships that obtain between these various sciences; and the nature of the relation between the critical intelligence\u2014the knowing, willing, and feeling subject\u2014and consciousness in general.\n\nAccording to Windelband, both the triumphs and the limitations of contemporary philosophical thought had their origins in Immanuel Kant's thought. Kant had established the dogma that all knowledge must be of the type provided by the natural sciences. But, Windelband held, if knowledge is limited to only that which can be contained within the categories as set forth in the Critique of Pure Reason, then the kinds of activities associated with the will and the emotions\u2014that is to say, the subjects of Kant's second and third critiques\u2014are removed from the province of knowledge. The inadequacies of the Kantian identification of knowledge in general with natural scientific knowledge alone had been demonstrated by the post-Kantian idealists, who sought to construct a theory of knowledge capable of appreciating \"the needs of modern culture, and \u2026 the historical material of ideas\" (History of Philosophy, p. 569). Idealism failed, however, because it ended by hypostatizing a spiritual sphere that presumably was separate from the world of matter and that operated according to principles utterly different from those which science explicated in general causal laws. Thus, whereas Kantianism had failed to include ethics and aesthetics within the domain of scientific philosophy, idealism failed to provide a place for those aspects of the world revealed by the natural sciences and eternally established as causally determined. It thus appeared to late nineteenth-century thinkers that there were at least two levels of reality, one spiritual and historical, the other material and determined; and it seemed that knowledge itself, far from being one, was at least twofold. On the one hand, it was empirical and discovered laws; on the other hand, it was rational and revealed the essential freedom behind the laws. Such at least had been the contention of Wilhelm Dilthey and the neo-idealists. As long as this division persisted, Windelband held, pessimism, the denial of philosophy, must flourish also.\n\nThe way out of the difficulty was to be provided by a fundamental reappraisal in philosophy, a reconsideration of modern thought ab initio. For Windelband this meant primarily an attempt to find a way to apply the technique of transcendental deduction to the historical as well as the physical sciences. It also meant liberation from the notion that natural science was the archetype of all knowledge.\n\nIn an early address, \"Was ist Philosophie?\" (1882), Windelband distinguished between theoretical judgments (Urteile ) and critical judgments (Beurteilungen ). The former expressed the \"mutual implicativeness\" (Zusammengeh\u00f6rigkeit ) of two \"representational contents\" (Vorstellungsinhalte ); the latter expressed the relation between the judging consciousness (beurteilenden Bewusstsein ) and the object represented (see Pr\u00e4ludien, Vol. I, p. 29). Theoretical judgments are judgments of fact and are always positive; their purpose is to extend the limits of knowledge in a given science. Critical judgments, however, can be either positive or negative, and they express the position assumed by the subject when a given theoretical judgment is endowed with a status as means to some end.\n\nThe individual sciences expand the series of theoretical judgments; philosophy examines the relations between the ability of individual consciousness to render judgments and that \"consciousness in general\" (Bewusstsein \u00fcberhaupt ) which is the intuited basis of every critical judgment. Philosophy, then, \"has its own proper field and its own problem in those values of universal validity that are the organizing principles for the functions of culture and civilization and for all the particular values of life. But it will describe and explain those values only that it may give an account of their validity; it treats them not as facts but as norms\" (History of Philosophy, pp. 680\u2013681). The various sciences are concerned with facts, which they organize in different ways according to the ends for which those facts are \"constructed.\" Philosophy, however, is concerned with the processes by which events attain the status of facts for particular sciences.\n\nCritical judgments, then, are rendered in respect not of what is but of what ought to be; in accordance not with laws but with norms. There is a \"normative consciousness\" (Normalbewusstsein ) presupposed by philosophy; this \"normative consciousness\" is in abstracto the same as that which, in concreto, underlies every scientific, moral, and aesthetic experience. It is not to be thought of as either a metaphysical or a psychological entity. It is, rather, merely the \"sum-total of the inter-connections and relations between existents\" (Logic, p. 59). These relations \"are not themselves existents, either as things, as states, or as activities; they can only become 'actual' as the content of the psychical functions of knowing.\u2026 In itself the realm of the valid is nothing else than the form and order under which that which exists is determined\" (ibid.). It follows, then, that \"this whole is closed to our knowledge; we shall never know more than a few fragments of it, and there is no prospect of our ever being able to patch it together out of the scraps that we can gather\" (ibid., p. 65). Therefore, philosophy cannot end in science or in any practical rule of life; it can only point the attention of humanity to the sensed \"principles of absolute judgment\" that are presupposed in every human confrontation of the world in scientific, moral, and aesthetic experience.\n\nWindelband regarded as baseless every attempt to distinguish between the different disciplines that constitute science on the basis of a presumed essential difference between their objects. The disciplines are distinguished only by their methods, which are in turn functions of the ends or values informing them as instruments of culture. In the address \"Geschichte und Naturwissenschaften\" (1894), he distinguished between the natural sciences and the historical sciences, and he argued that the natural sciences aim at the construction of general laws and \"explain\" an event by identifying it as an instance of a general law. Historical sciences, on the other hand, are individualizing; they concentrate on specific events and attempt to determine their specific physiognomy or form. Natural science Windelband termed nomothetic ; historical science, idiographic. But, he added, any given object could be studied by both kinds of science. A mental event, if viewed under the aspect of physical causality\u2014as an instance of the working of some general law\u2014was a natural event. That same mental event, described in its individuality and valued for its deviation from the class to which it belonged, became an object of the idiographic sciences. Positivists erred in holding that every event must be viewed nomothetically, just as idealists erred in thinking that certain kinds of events cannot be so viewed. The total picture of the world that consciousness is in principle able to construct can be constructed only through the use of both kinds of investigation. No single event can be deduced from general laws, and no law can be framed out of the contemplation of a single event. \"Law and event remain together as the ultimate, incommensurable limits of our representation of the world\" (Pr\u00e4ludien, Vol. II, p. 160).\n\nSee also Consciousness; Dilthey, Wilhelm; Fischer, Kuno; History and Historiography of Philosophy; Idealism; Kant, Immanuel; Lotze, Rudolf Hermann; Neo-Kantianism.\n\nBibliography\n\nworks by windelband\n\nDie Lehre vom Zufall.

Dilthey is best known for the way he distinguished between the natural and human sciences. Whereas the main task of the natural sciences is to arrive at law-based causal explanations, the core task of the human sciences is the understanding of the organizational structures of human and historical life. It will be shown that this distinction is not so sharp as to rule out causal explanations in human sciences such as psychology and history; it merely delimits the scope of such explanations. Dilthey\u2019s aim was to expand Kant\u2019s primarily nature-oriented Critique of Pure Reason into a Critique of Historical Reason that can also do justice to the social and cultural dimensions of human experience. Understanding the meaning of human historical events requires being able to organize them in their proper contexts and to articulate the structural uniformities that can be found in this way. Dilthey\u2019s reflections on the human sciences, historical contextualization and hermeneutics influenced many subsequent thinkers such as Husserl, Heidegger, Cassirer, Gadamer and Ricoeur. Recently, there has been some attention given to the ways in which Dilthey\u2019s empirical approach to experience influenced Carnap in his early attempts to overcome metaphysics.\n\n1. Dilthey\u2019s Life and Thought\n\n1.1 Brief Overview of Dilthey\u2019s Philosophical Development\n\nWilhelm Dilthey was born in Biebrich on the Rhine in 1833, two years after Hegel had died. Dilthey\u2019s ambivalent attitude towards Hegel can provide some initial clues about his own philosophical approach. He admired Hegel\u2019s recognition of the historical dimension of philosophical thought, but rejected the speculative and metaphysical ways he developed this relation. Like the Neo-Kantians, Dilthey proposed a return to the more focused viewpoint of Kant, but not without also taking account of the broader perspective of later idealists like Hegel.\n\nDilthey characterized his own expansive view of philosophy as one of establishing integral relations to all the theoretical disciplines and historical practices that attempt to make sense of the world. Instead of demarcating the boundaries that set philosophy apart from other ways of engaging life, Dilthey conceives its critical task as articulating the overall structures that define the human spirit in general. Relatively early in his career, philosophy is defined as \u201can experiential science of spiritual phenomena\u201d that seeks to \u201ccognize the laws governing social, intellectual and moral phenomena\u201d (1867/GS.V, 27). Philosophy should aim to preserve the scope that idealists such as Fichte, Schelling and Hegel once gave it, but it must do so by recapturing the Kantian rigor that had been lost and by applying it empirically.\n\nThese goals, as formulated in the inaugural lecture that Dilthey gave in 1867 on assuming his first professorship in Basel, were already prefigured in his early journals. Thus in 1859 Dilthey wrote that a new Critique of Reason must proceed on the basis of the psychological laws and impulses from which art, religion and science all derive. All intellectual systems are mere crystallizations of more generic schemata rooted in life (JD, 80).\n\nThe early Dilthey conceived his goal as a broadening of the critical project that would ground the human sciences as Kant had grounded the natural sciences. His hope then was that the human sciences would be able to arrive at lawful explanations just like the natural sciences. Up until at least 1887, when he published his Poetics, Dilthey was confident that inner explanations of human creativity could be arrived at. He himself formulated three laws of the imaginative metamorphosis to account for the powerful effect that poets can have on us.\n\nBut through his efforts to work out the psychology that could be appealed to by such inner explanations, Dilthey came to modify some of his basic assumptions. He increasingly stresses that our access to the human world of history is much more direct than our access to nature. Although Dilthey is still willing to accept that objects of outer experience are phenomenal, he no longer accepts the Kantian thesis that the contents of inner experience are phenomenal as well. They are real and the time that relates us to history is not merely the ideal form that Kant had exposited.\n\nThis second phase of Dilthey\u2019s thought is characterized by a stress on the reality of lived experience and on the immediate understanding of human life that this makes possible. It is in the \u201cIdeas for a Descriptive and Analytic Psychology\u201d of 1894 that Dilthey works out his explanation-understanding distinction. \u201cWe explain through purely intellectual processes, but we understand through the cooperation of all the powers of the mind activated by apprehension\u201d (1894/SW.II, 147). The human sciences will henceforth be conceived as primarily concerned with understanding the meaning of human action and interaction. Also central to this second phase of Dilthey\u2019s thought is the essay \u201cThe Origin of Our Belief in the Reality of the External World and Its Justification\u201d of 1890. Our initial access to the external world is not inferential, but is felt as resistance to the will. The world of lived experience is not merely a theoretical representation, but is directly present to us as embodying values that are relevant to our purposes. The stress on feeling and immediacy in this second phase amounts to a rejection of Hegel\u2019s dialectical approach.\n\nIf the first phase was characterized by a search for inner explanation and the second phase by direct understanding, the third phase can be characterized by the need for interpretation. This final phase can be said to span the last decade of Dilthey\u2019s life until his death in 1911. It begins with the realization in the essay \u201cThe Rise of Hermeneutics\u201d of 1900 that the inner intelligibility of lived experience does not yet constitute understanding. Self-understanding can only come from without. The way we express ourselves, whether in communication or in action, is a crucial intermediary in defining ourselves. Understanding can only be reliable if it proceeds through the interpretation of human objectifications. Thus we understand ourselves not through introspection but through history. It is in this last phase of his thought that Dilthey, who now occupied the chair that Hegel had once held in Berlin, revives his predecessor\u2019s theory of objective spirit as the medium relating us to the past. In 1906 Dilthey published a seminal work on the young Hegel that made use of recently discovered theological and political fragments. These unknown early fragments disclosed Hegel\u2019s historical geniality before it became constrained by the dialectical systematization that Dilthey had always objected to. Dilthey\u2019s student Herman Nohl was helpful in deciphering some of these fragments and went on to publish them. Nohl also edited a volume of Dilthey\u2019s writings on the history of German Idealism going back to Kant, Beck and Fichte and leading up to such contemporaries of Hegel as Schelling, Schleiermacher, Schopenhauer and Fries.\n\n1.2 The Religious Background of Dilthey\u2019s Philosophy\n\nDilthey followed family tradition by starting his university studies at Heidelberg in theology. There he was also introduced to the philosophical systems of the idealists by Kuno Fischer. Because Fischer was accused of being a pantheist, his right to teach was withdrawn in 1853. Dilthey then moved to the University of Berlin, where he came under the influence of two of Schleiermacher\u2019s students, Friedrich von Trendelenburg and August Boeckh. Increasingly, Schleiermacher became the focus of Dilthey\u2019s interests. In 1859 he was asked to complete the editing of Schleiermacher\u2019s letters. That year the Schleiermacher Society also organized an essay competition. Dilthey\u2019s submission entitled \u201cSchleiermacher\u2019s Hermeneutical System in Relation to Earlier Protestant Hermeneutics\u201d (1860, SW.IV, 33\u2013227), was awarded the first prize and led to a second commission, namely, to write Schleiermacher\u2019s biography. The first volume of this biography was published in 1870. It places Schleiermacher not only in his theological setting but also in the context of the literary and philosophical movements astir in Berlin from 1796 to 1807. The work displays Dilthey\u2019s own expanding interests in aesthetical and philosophical issues. He also wrote his dissertation on Schleiermacher\u2019s ethics.\n\nAs a theology student, Dilthey had begun a study of many early formulations of the Christian worldview, which though never completed, continued to influence his subsequent writings. In 1860 Dilthey writes that\n\nit is my calling to apprehend the innermost nature of religious life in history and to bring this to the attention of our times which are moved exclusively by matters of state and science. (JD, 140)\n\nThis means looking for religiosity not so much in its institutional practices and its theological doctrines as in the recesses of human experience. In a similar vein, he asserts that it is necessary to recover the \u201creligious-philosophical worldview that is buried under the ruins of our theology and philosophy\u201d (JD, 140).\n\nDilthey conceives religious experience as an extension of Schleiermacher\u2019s feeling of absolute dependence. It is a total experience that interweaves a feeling of dependence with an awareness of a higher life independent of nature. Religious life is regarded as the enduring background of human intellectual development, and that development can manifest itself in mythical representation, in theological doctrine, in metaphysical conceptualization as well as in scientific theory. Dilthey rejected attempts to find the roots of religion in myth. He saw myth as an attempt to represent and explain the world in religious terms. Myth is not so much a primitive mode of religion as it is a primitive mode of scientific theory.\n\nLater as he reflected on the nature of worldviews, Dilthey would occasionally return to the problem of religion. What distinguishes the religious worldview from artistic and philosophical worldviews is that it relates the visible to what is invisible, life to our awareness of death. In a striking late passage, Dilthey writes that when life is experienced religiously\n\naccording to its true nature\u2014full of hardships and a singular blend of suffering and happiness throughout\u2014[it] points to something strange and unfamiliar, as if it were coming from invisible sources, something <pressing in> on life from outside, yet coming from its own depths. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 285)\n\nThe same non-transcendent perspective on religion is to be found in Dilthey\u2019s last essay, written during the final days of his life in 1911 while he was on vacation in the Dolomites. This essay on \u201cThe Problem of Religion\u201d points to the fact that the Enlightenment has made it increasingly difficult to acknowledge the mystical aspects of religious experience. Enlightenment thinkers regarded mystical experience as irrational. But according to Dilthey, Schleiermacher was able to avoid this charge of irrationalism by relating core aspects of religious experience to the insights of transcendental philosophy. Instead of interpreting the mystical feeling of communion as an esoteric union with God, Schleiermacher explicates it as a general awareness that is attuned to the invisible coherence of things (1911/GS.VI, 295). He gives a transcendental reading of what is intuited and felt in the religious mood by transforming it into a creative principle. Whereas traditionally mysticism tended to devalue our life in this world, Schleiermacher\u2019s mysticism is seen as affirming it.\n\n2. Dilthey\u2019s Main Philosophical Works\n\n2.1 The 1880s: Broadening the Critical Framework\n\nDilthey\u2019s first important theoretical work is the Introduction to the Human Sciences of 1883. The human sciences (Geisteswissenschaften) encompass both the humanities and the social sciences. They range from disciplines like philology, literary and cultural studies, religion and psychology, to political science and economics. Dilthey insists that the human sciences be related not by some logical construct on the order of a Comte or a Mill, but by means of reflective considerations that take their historical genesis into account. Dilthey writes that\n\nthe human sciences as they exist and as they are practiced according to the reason of things that were active in their history \u2026 contain three classes of assertions. (1883/SW.I, 78)\n\nThese are 1) descriptive and historical statements, 2) theoretical generalizations about partial contents and 3) evaluative judgments and practical rules. The human sciences are more obviously normative in nature than the natural sciences for which formal norms related to objective inquiry suffice. The fact that the human sciences are forced to confront substantive normative issues puts a limit on the kind of theoretical regularities that can be established in the human sciences. Given the core role that human beings play in the socio-historical world, the understanding of individuality is as important in the human sciences as are the explanations to be found through generalizations.\n\nBut the human science of psychology that deals with human beings cannot examine them apart from interactions with society. \u201cMan as a fact prior to history and society is a fiction\u201d (1883/SW.I, 83). This means that psychology can be a foundational human science only if it is conceived as being primarily descriptive. Psychological explanations may still be possible, but only by starting with a non-hypothetical base that describes how our experience assimilates social and cultural features. Many human character traits are not purely psychological. Thus when we speak of a person as thrifty we are combining economic and psychological features.\n\nIndividual human beings are important for the understanding of history, but instead of making them the monadic building blocks of history, they are to be considered as points of intersection. Only a multidisciplinary approach to human history can do it justice. Qua conscious living beings, individuals are the carriers of history, but they are just as much the products of history. Individuals are not self-sufficient atoms. But neither are they to be regarded as swallowed up by encompassing communities like nations or peoples. Concepts that posit the spirit or soul of a people \u201care no more usable in history than is the concept of life-force in physiology\u201d (1883/SW.I, 92). Suspicion of overarching forces like peoples led Dilthey to distance himself from the nationalism of his contemporary Heinrich von Treitschke and to ally himself with a political gradualism reminiscent of Kant and Wilhelm von Humboldt.\n\nDilthey conceives of most of the human sciences as analyzing human interactions at a level that can mediate between individual initiative and communal tradition. These sciences deal with what he calls \u201ccultural systems\u201d and \u201cexternal organizations of society\u201d. Cultural systems are associations that individuals join voluntarily for certain purposes that they can only achieve through cooperation. These systems are cultural in the widest possible sense and include all aspects of our social life. They can be political, economic, artistic, scientific or religious in nature and are not bound by local or national interests. External organizations of society by contrast are those institutional structures like a family and a state that we already are born into. Here \u201cenduring causes bind the wills of many into a single whole\u201d (1883/SW.I, 94) within which relations of power, dependence and property can be established. It is important to cross-reference cultural systems and institutional organizations. Enlightenment thinkers had focused on cultural systems and their potential universal scope while overlooking how they are rooted in real life. Although Dilthey received his training from members of the Historical School, he recognized that many of them had been equally one-sided by stressing the distinctive institutional organizations that separate different peoples while ignoring the role of generalizations made possible through the analysis of cultural systems.\n\nDilthey aims to combine these two approaches to liberalize the historicist perspective and give it a methodological rigor. To understand the role of the law in historical life we must consider it both as a cultural system that frames legal issues in universal terms and as an external organization of society that examines them in terms of the positive laws of particular institutions. The Historical School was wrong to regard individuals as completely subordinate to the bonds of family and state and to think that the positive laws of institutions define the full reality of life. The authority of the state \u201cencompasses only a certain portion \u2026 of the collective power of the populace\u201d and even when state power exerts a certain preponderance it can do so only \u201cthrough the cooperation of psychological impulses\u201d (1883/SW.I, 132).\n\nIn the preface to the Introduction to the Human Sciences, Dilthey refers to his project as a Critique of Historical Reason. We can now see that this is first of all a critique of the metaphysical thesis that there can be an overarching \u201cuniversal explanatory framework for all historical facts\u201d (1883/SW.I, 141). If universal explanations are to be possible for history as well as for nature, then we must recognize that they are only possible for correlating partial contents of reality. The reason that the natural sciences have been so successful in discovering causal laws of nature is that they abstract from the full scope of the external world.\n\nThe conditions sought by the mechanistic explanation of nature explain only part of the contents of external reality. This intelligible world of atoms, ether, vibrations, is only a calculated and highly artificial abstraction from what is given in experience and lived experience. (1883/SW.I, 203)\n\nThe human sciences cannot similarly construct an abstract phenomenal world that focuses on physical and chemical processes and appeals to hypothetical atomic or even subatomic elements. It is incumbent on the human sciences to deal with the more complex networks of the historical world and the actual givens of human beings. Explanations that are adequate for the historical world will require an analysis of the multiple partial contents that are relevant in a particular context. According to Dilthey the human sciences must replace the abstract methodology of the natural sciences with an analytic counterpart.\n\nAbstraction is distinguished from analysis in that the former singles out one fact and disregards the others, whereas the latter seeks to apprehend the majority of the facts that make up the factors of a complex whole. (ca. 1880\u20131893/SW.I, 433)\n\nThe more facts that explanations seek to correlate, the more limited their scope must be. Thus the laws to be discovered in the human sciences will apply not to history in general, but to specific cultural systems or social organizations only. It may be possible to arrive at causal laws of economic growth, of scientific progress or of literary development, but not overarching historical laws of human progress.\n\nSo far Dilthey has argued for a relative independence of the human sciences vis-\u00e0-vis the better established natural sciences. However, from the transcendental perspective that considers the conditions our consciousness brings to experience, the human sciences must claim a reflective priority. The realization that the human sciences not only ascertain what is\u2014as do the natural sciences\u2014but also make value judgments, establish goals and prescribe rules, discloses that they are much more directly related to the full reality of lived experience. The I-think that is the basis of the conceptual cognition (Erkenntnis) of the natural sciences is preceded by a direct knowing (Wissen) that is rooted in the more inclusive thinking-feeling-willing of lived experience (see 1883/SW.I, 228, and ca. 1880\u201393/SW.I, 263\u201368). The natural sciences merely construct a phenomenal or ideal world that abstracts from the real nexus of lived experience. The world that is formed by the human sciences is the historical-social reality in which human beings participate. It is a real world that is directly possessed or present in what Dilthey calls Innewerden. This term is best translated as \u201creflexive awareness\u201d to indicate a self-givenness. Reflexive awareness is an \u201coriginal form of consciousness\u201d (ca. 1880\u201393/SW.I, 255) that \u201cdoes not place a content over against the subject of consciousness (it does not re-present it)\u201d (ca. 1880\u201393/SW.I, 253). Reflexive awareness involves a direct knowing that reality is present-for-me prior to there being any reflective act-content, subject-object distinctions that characterize the representational world of conceptual cognition.\n\nThe human sciences must tap the original and direct presence of this known world even when they attempt to use the intellectual tools of conceptual cognition in their analysis of partial contents. The way the historical world is represented and explained must in some way reflect the way history has been lived and understood. Understanding (Verstehen) for Dilthey is a process that employs all our capacities and is to be distinguished from pure intellectual understanding (Verstand). And if the human sciences are going to be capable of expanding the scope of our understanding beyond what is available to each of us in our particular circumstances, it must be rooted in the original fullness and richness of our lived experience.\n\nIn attempting to convey the genuine richness and depth of lived experience, the human sciences must also consider the contribution of the arts. Aesthetics constitutes an important cultural system in that it can provide a sense of how the arts can contribute to human understanding in general. Dilthey\u2019s Poetics of 1887 represents an effort to develop certain psychological concepts to explain the workings of the poetic imagination. Even in ordinary life, the images we extract from experience are subject to metamorphosis. With time all our images are transformed, for \u201cthe same image can no more return than the same leaf can grow back on a tree the following spring\u201d (1887/SW.V, 102). The first law of metamorphosis involves the exclusion of those constituents of images that are not valuable to us. Not every apprehended constituent is worth remembering. According to Dilthey we do not just passively absorb every impression that comes our way. We filter out what is not worth perceiving by a process of apperception. This apperception is guided by what is called an \u201cacquired nexus of psychic life\u201d. Because this gradually acquired nexus differs for each subject, the process of exclusion never has the same outcome.\n\nSome of what has not been excluded by the first law of imaginative metamorphosis can then become the focus of special attention. According to Dilthey\u2019s second law of imaginative metamorphosis \u201cImages are transformed when they expand or contract, when the intensity of the sensations of which they are composed is increased or decreased\u201d (1887/SW.V, 102). Such a change in intensity can apply to either the reproductive imagination of ordinary memory or the productive imagination of the poet. In the former case of memory an increase of intensity tends to be a function of a present practical interest. In the latter case of the poetic imagination an increase of intensity is more likely to be regulated by the acquired psychic nexus. What distinguishes the imagination of great poets according to Dilthey is their capacity to ignore the constant distractions and mundane interests of daily life. Only they can unfold imagery in a way that reflects their overall values.\n\nThe third law of imaginative metamorphosis involves their completion, by which Dilthey means a process \u201cby which something outer is enlivened by something inner or something inner is made visible and intuitable by something outer\u201d (1887/SW.V, 104). In completion there is an interpenetration between inner feeling and outer perception so that the very nucleus of an image can symbolize the overall acquired psychic nexus. Dilthey writes,\n\nOnly when the whole acquired psychic nexus becomes active can images be transformed on the basis of it: innumerable, immeasurable, almost imperceptible changes occur in their nucleus. And in this way, the completion of the particular originates from the fullness of psychic life. (1887/SW.V, 104)\n\nThis last law of imaginative completion applies only to artists and allows them to articulate the essential meaning of life-situations\u2014through them we come to understand what is typical in life. These laws of metamorphosis are conceived as explanative to the extent that they appeal to an overall acquired psychic nexus as their context. A generally understood context frames more specific explanations.\n\nAfter 1887 Dilthey backs away from pure psychological explanations. In the essay \u201cThree Epochs of Modern Aesthetics\u201d of 1892 he redescribes imaginative metamorphosis structurally. A portrait painter is said to order the structure of what is objectively perceived\n\naround one especially noticeable point, which I will call the aesthetic point of impression. Every carefully observed face is understood on the basis of such a dominant impression \u2026. On the basis of this impression and repeated memory, indifferent features are excluded, while telling features are stressed and refractory ones de-emphasized. The remaining whole is unified ever more decisively. (1892/SW.V, 217)\n\nNow exclusion, intensification and unifying completion are understood as part of a process of articulating the structure of our experience of the reality.\n\n2.2 The 1890s: Understanding as Structural Articulation\n\nThis new, more descriptive structural approach is inaugurated in the essay \u201cThe Origin of Our Belief in the Reality of the External World and Its Justification\u201d of 1890. Here Dilthey writes that the structure of all psychic life consists of impressions \u201cevoking purposive reactions in the system of our drives and the feelings connected with them\u201d (1890a/SW.II, 14). Rather than basing our initial sense of an external world on theoretical inferences from effects to causes, he roots it in a felt resistance to the will. But resistance must be internalized as a restraint of a volitional intention for it to signify the existence of something independent. Thus Dilthey is not merely replacing a representational phenomenalism with a direct perceptual realism. Each perceptual process has \u201can inner side\u201d that involves \u201can energy and affective tone deriving from inner strivings that connect it to our own life\u201d (1890a/SW.II, 14). All aspects of our own life are brought into play as we respond to the world.\n\nIn 1894 Dilthey published his \u201cIdeas for a Descriptive and Analytic Psychology\u201d and established how it differs from traditional explanative psychologies. He admits that even a descriptive psychology will seek to explicate the causal relationships of life, but that it must differ from explanative psychology by not trying to \u201cderive a comprehensive and transparent cognition of psychological phenomena from a limited number of univocally determined elements\u201d (1894/SW.II, 116). Unlike the associationists, Dilthey will not posit simple, stable impressions that are then combined into more complex ideas. They introduce unnecessary hypothetical elements into the foundation of psychology.\n\nIn psychology it is precisely the connectedness that is originally and continually given in lived experience: life presents itself everywhere only as a continuum or nexus. (1894/SW.II, 119-20)\n\nIt is the task of a descriptive and analytic psychology to explicate how different processes converge in the nexus of consciousness. This nexus is lived and must be distinguished from the overall acquired psychic nexus discussed earlier. The lived nexus is available to reflexive awareness and can be described as itself an ongoing process. Analysis then shows this process to have a rather uniform cross-sectional structure. Almost every momentary state of consciousness can be seen \u201cto simultaneously contain some kind of representing, feeling, and willing\u201d (1894/SW.II, 173).\n\nIf we were merely representational beings, the conditions of psychic life would be merely causal. But we at the same time estimate the value of what we represent through feeling.\n\nOnce external conditions evoke a sense of pressure or intensification in the sphere of feeling, a striving comes about to either maintain or to modify a given state. (1894/SW.II, 177)\n\nThe interest of feeling that attaches to aspects of what is experienced allows us to value them as either favorable or unfavorable to our existence and sets the stage for the will to possibly act on their basis.\n\nTo the extent that the parts [of the experiential nexus] are connected structurally so as to link the satisfaction of the drives and happiness and to reject suffering, we call this nexus purposive. It is solely in psychic structure that the character of purposiveness is originally given, and when we attribute this to an organism or to the world, this concept is only transferred from inner lived experience. Every relation of parts to a whole attains the character of purposiveness from the value that is realized in it. This value is experienced only in the life of feelings and drives. (1894/SW.II, 178)\n\nPsychic life is not constructed from discrete elements, but is always already a continuum that is constantly differentiating itself from within. By first explicating the structural unity of this nexus we bring out the breadth of its scope. When we then consider the development of the nexus we display its temporal length. As purposive, this development is characterized as teleological, but this does not entail positing any final telos to which all previous stages are to be subsumed. The purposiveness of life and its structural systems is immanent and adaptive rather than external and predetermined. Each stage of life can be understood as an epoch with its distinctive value.\n\nNothing can be more erroneous than viewing maturity as the goal of the development that constitutes life and thus transforming the early years into mere means. How could those years serve as means to a goal which in each case is so uncertain? Instead, it is part of the nature of life to strive to fill each moment with a richness of value. (1894/SW.II, 189)\n\nA further task of Dilthey\u2019s descriptive and analytic psychology is to show how the development of psychological structure produces the individuation of human life. Individuality is not conceived in terms of unique qualities that we are endowed with, but as something that each of us acquires historically. It is embodied in what was referred to earlier as a subject\u2019s acquired psychic nexus and is only gradually articulated. Even when people share the same qualities their relative intensity will differ. Sometimes qualities are present to such a small extent as to be, in effect, unnoticeable. Prominent qualities, however, tend to reinforce certain related qualities and suppress others. Each individual can thus be understood as a structural configuration of a set of dominant qualities in tension with some subordinate qualities. This tension may be unresolved for a long time until finally some articulation or Gestalt is reached that defines a person\u2019s character. Dilthey gives the example of strong ambition leading someone to gradually overcome shyness in public. Once a person recognizes that low self-confidence when speaking in public stands in the way of an important goal being fulfilled, that person can begin to cultivate the requisite qualities.\n\nThe initial response to Dilthey\u2019s descriptive psychology was rather negative. Hermann Ebbinghaus wrote an extended review which claimed that Dilthey still relies on hypotheses and that the differences between explanative and descriptive psychologies are minimal. Dilthey defended his position by showing that he never meant to banish explanative hypotheses from psychology altogether, merely from its descriptive foundations. Husserl later expressed his regret that the Ebbinghaus review deflected him from reading this \u201cgenial\u201d anticipation of phenomenology until much later.\n\nAnother source of criticism came from the Neo-Kantians, most of whom wanted to divorce philosophy from psychology. In 1894 the Baden School Neo-Kantian Wilhelm Windelband delivered a lecture in which he claimed that psychology has no real relevance for the historical sciences and should be considered a natural science rather than a human science. He sees psychology as searching for laws just as the natural sciences do and historical studies as interested in unique patterns. Thus Windelband proposed that the natural sciences are nomothetic and the historical or cultural sciences ideographic. Dilthey rejects Windelband\u2019s distinction by showing that many natural sciences have ideographic elements and many human sciences such as linguistics and economics have nomothetic aims. Moreover, Dilthey argues that the description of singular historical data only becomes meaningful if understood in the framework of regularities: \u201cWhat is most characteristic of the systematic human sciences is the connection of the general and the individual \u201d (1895\u20136/SW.II, 227). Not only is it the case that universal considerations are as important as ideographic specificity, but also the understanding of individuality is not possible without reference to some broader context.\n\n2.3 1900\u20131911: Historical Understanding and Hermeneutics\n\n2.3.1 Interpreting from the Outside In\n\nThe final phase of Dilthey\u2019s philosophy can be said to begin at the turn of the twentieth century with his essay \u201cThe Rise of Hermeneutics\u201d. Whereas the early prize-essay on Schleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics had been more focused on textual and theological interpretation, the new essay makes hermeneutics a connecting link between philosophy and history. Dilthey argues that the study of history can be reliable only if it is possible to raise the understanding of what is singular to the level of universal validity. Here he also comes to the realization that\n\nthe inner experience through which I obtain reflexive awareness of my own condition can never by itself bring me to a consciousness of my own individuality. I experience the latter only through a comparison of myself with others. (1900/SW.IV, 236)\n\nOthers cannot be assumed to be mere extensions of myself. They are accessible to me only from the outside. It is the task of understanding to confer \u201can inside\u201d to what is first given as \u201ca complex of external sensory signs\u201d (1900/SW.IV, 236).\n\nWhereas up to then lived experience had been assumed to provide us an understanding of ourselves, now Dilthey asserts that we understand ourselves only by means of our objectifications. The understanding of self requires me to approach myself as others do, that is, from the outside to the inside.\n\nThe process of understanding, insofar as it is determined by common conditions and epistemological means, must everywhere have the same characteristics. (1900/SW.IV, 237)\n\nTo the extent that rules can guide the understanding of the objectifications of life it constitutes interpretation. Hermeneutics is the theory of interpretation that relates to all human objectifications\u2014that is, not only speech and writing, but also visual artistic expressions, more casual physical gestures as well as observable actions or deeds.\n\nThis new perspective that approaches the inside from the outside also alters Dilthey\u2019s conception of psychic structure. In the first of three \u201cStudies Toward the Foundation of the Human Sciences\u201d dating from 1904\u20139, Dilthey considers what linguistic expressions can teach us about the intentionality of consciousness. No longer merely explicating the breadth of psychic life through the interweavings of acts of cognition, feeling and willing, Dilthey uses an expression such as \u201cI am worried about something\u201d to disclose the referential structure of a lived experience. Psychic acts have contents that are related to the objects of the world by means of what Dilthey calls attitudinal stances. Our attitudes toward the world are\n\nindefinite in number. Asking, believing, presuming, claiming, taking pleasure in, approving, liking and its opposite, wishing, desiring, and willing are such modifications of the psychic attitude. (1904\u20139/SW.III, 43)\n\nThese attitudinal stances are not just cognitive, but predelineate something more encompassing, which Dilthey calls \u201cknowledge\u201d. Knowledge (Wissen) adds to the conceptual cognition (Erkenntnis) of reality, \u201cthe positing of values\u201d and \u201cthe determination of purposes and the establishment of rules\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 25).\n\nWhile the kind of epistemology (Erkenntnistheorie) established by Kant and others suffices for the natural sciences, the human sciences require a more full-blooded theory of knowledge (Theorie des Wissens). Knowledge is to be \u201cdistinguished from a mere representation, presumption, question, or assumption by the fact that a content appears here with a sense of objective necessity\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 27\u201328). This objective necessity is to be located in the evidentness that accompanies thinking that is properly executed and reaches its goal whether through the self-given reality of lived experience or the \u201cgivenness that binds us to an outer perception\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 28).\n\nFor the human sciences, things in the world are not merely cognitively apprehended as phenomenal objects, but known as real for our life-concerns (Lebensbez\u00fcge). Thinking of the unfinished manuscripts in his office, Dilthey writes in the Second Study:\n\nI am tired from overworking; having reviewed my files, I worry about their unfinished contents, whose completion demands incalculably more work from me. All this \u201cabout\u201d, \u201cof\u201d, and \u201ctoward\u201d, all these references of what is remembered to what is experienced, in short, all these structural inner relations, must be apprehended by me, since I now want to apprehend the fullness of the lived experience exhaustively. And precisely in order to exhaust it, I must regress further in the structural network to the memories of other lived experiences. (1904\u20139/SW.III, 50)\n\nEvery attempt to characterize a lived experience leads beyond it to other structurally related experiences that ground it. This involves not just an observational process of willful attention, but also an involuntary \u201cbeing-pulled-along by the state of affairs itself\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 51) to other constituent parts of the nexus of human knowledge.\n\nSome of these refinements incorporated into Dilthey\u2019s descriptive program were inspired by reading Husserl\u2019s Logical Investigations (1900\u201301). Dilthey specifically follows Husserl in his account of how language contributes to \u201csignificative apprehension\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 60). In using words we do not represent them as words but fulfill their meaning by representing their objects. There is a triadic structural relation between the intuitive content of a linguistic expression, an act that gives it meaning and the object that embodies that meaning as what is expressed. But whereas Husserl\u2019s phenomenology focused in the conceptual structures of objective apprehension, Dilthey gives equal attention to the felt structures of what he calls \u201cobjective having\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 66). In objective apprehension we progress from attitude to objects, in objective having we regress from objects to attitude. This regressive turn from the outside to the inside is brought to bear on how feelings are to be interpreted. \u201cWhether we feel our own state or some object, it involves only a state of being as a kind of attitude\u2026. The way this state of being depends on outer objects or on the state of the subject is obscured through an inverse attitude that loses itself in the depth of the subject\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 69). Instead of regarding feelings merely as subjective states such as pleasure or displeasure, they can be interpreted as attitudes that assess what is given in consciousness as either furthering or diminishing one\u2019s state of being in the world. Feelings can be added to our earlier list of attitudes.\n\nFeelings as attitudes allow us to evaluate the world. Our values express adjudicative attitudes based on feeling. Although the setting of purposes is grounded in the lived experience of values, the life of feelings has an immanent teleology that does not require it to go over into the desire to act. The structural nexus of willing is thus different from that of feeling. There are many feelings that evoke further feelings rather than the impulse to do something in response to them. A feeling of suffering can for instance elicit a kind of self-pity that spreads the suffering and elicits a \u201cdistinctively mellow\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 76) mood that immobilizes.\n\nThe final general attitude relevant to the structural nexus of knowledge is that of willing. In the lived experiences of willing \u201cwe possess a reflexive awareness of an intention to realize a state of affairs\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 82). If we call this state of affairs to be realized a \u201cpurpose\u201d then what is expected from this purpose is a satisfaction of some kind.\n\n2.3.2 Reinterpreting Purposiveness and Distinguishing Elementary Understanding and Higher Understanding.\n\nDilthey\u2019s most important work is The Formation of the Historical World in the Human Sciences of 1910. Here Dilthey applies the same kind of structural analysis that we saw him develop for lived experience to the understanding of history. The human sciences give form to the historical world by analyzing the structural systems in terms of which human beings participate in history. In the Introduction to the Human Sciences Dilthey had conceived the psychic nexus, cultural system and the external organization of society as purposive systems. Now a more neutral covering concept is used to capture all the ways the forces of life can converge. This is the concept of the \u201cproductive nexus or system\u201d (Wirkungszusammenhang). The efficacy of life and of the historical world is to be understood in terms of productivity before any causal or teleological analysis is applied. The carriers of history, whether they be individuals, cultures, institutions, or communities, are productive systems capable of producing value, meaning, and, in some cases, realizing purposes. Each is to be considered structurally as centered in itself.\n\nEach individual is a psychic productive system inherently related to other more inclusive productive systems that are also at work in history. These larger productive systems come about because of the need for communication, interaction, and cooperation among individuals. But they can also take on a life of their own and survive the individuals that formed them. Dilthey\u2019s category of Wirkung or productivity is at the root of Gadamer\u2019s theory of effective history (Wirkungsgeschichte). In the Introduction to the Human Sciences, Dilthey had been unwilling to consider these larger groupings as subjects or carriers of history. In The Formation of the Historical World in the Human Sciences, he qualifies his opposition to transpersonal subjects by allowing them to be considered as logical rather than real subjects. It is possible to regard cooperative productive systems as logical subjects that transcend individuals without positing them as superempirical real subjects.\n\nEven when individuals participate in more encompassing cultural systems and organizations of society, they are never completely submerged by them. This is because any such productive system only engages some aspects of an individual. Moreover, the individuals active in a cultural system often put their stamp on its mode of productivity so that not just the rationally agreed upon function of the system is achieved. Summing up these two points, Dilthey discerns a difficulty in conceptualizing the sciences of these cultural systems in terms of the idea of purposes alone:\n\nThe individuals who cooperate in such a function belong to the cultural system only through those processes by which they contribute to the realization of the function. Nevertheless, they participate in these processes with their whole being, which means that a domain based purely on the system\u2019s functional purpose can never be constructed. Rather, other aspects of human nature are also constantly at work in this domain supplementing the energies devoted to the system\u2019s functions. (1910/SW.III, 208)\n\nIndividuals give only part of themselves to these more inclusive systems, yet they can express their whole being through this part. No cultural system will embody merely the purposes it was meant to fulfill. That is why it is crucial to reconceive purposive systems as productive systems. A productive nexus or system may be purposive in a general sense without fulfilling a determinate purpose. It is to be understood more generally as producing objectifications that express human values as well as purposes\u2014leaving open the extent to which specific goals are achieved. The important thing is how human values and purposes are expressed in productive systems and how their meaning is to be understood.\n\nAs in the essay \u201cThe Rise of Hermeneutics\u201d, understanding is said to involve a process of referring back from outer sensory phenomena to a reality that is inner. But now in The Formation of the Historical World in the Human Sciences Dilthey recognizes that this inner reality need not be psychological in nature. He uses the example of how the statutes of a state express the common will of a community. The inner content of the laws on the books is a legal meaning formation. The expressions we read in law books articulate an inner relation among legal imperatives. What is expressed in these laws is not the mental states of individual legislators, but a general way of regulating human relations. Dilthey makes the same claim for individual poetic creations. What is expressed in a drama is\n\nnot the inner processes in the poet; it is rather a nexus created in them but separable from them. The nexus of a drama consists in a distinctive relation of material, poetic mood, motif, plot, and means of presentation. (1910/SW.III, 107)\n\nThe interpretation of history must deal with all manifestations of life, not merely expressions that are intended to communicate a state of mind. In the section entitled \u201cThe Understanding of Other Persons and Their Manifestations of Life\u201d, Dilthey distinguishes three classes of life-manifestations. The first class consists of concepts, judgments and larger thought-formations. They are intended to communicate states of affairs, not states of mind. Thus the proposition \u201ctwo plus two equals four\u201d means the same in all contexts and says nothing about the person uttering it. Actions form a second class of manifestations of life. Actions as such are not meant to communicate anything, but they often do reveal something about the intentions of the actor. Thus if someone picks up a hammer nearby some nails and wooden boards, it is legitimate to assume that he or she wants to assemble the boards into some artifact. If this occurs in a large workshop, it is also plausible to think the person is a carpenter. This might also tell us something about the person\u2019s livelihood, but not much more. There is a third class of life-manifestations that Dilthey calls \u201cexpressions of lived experience\u201d and which disclose more about the individual uttering them. Expressions of lived experience can range from simple exclamations and gestures to personal self-descriptions and reflections to works of art. Often these expressions are more revealing than was intended:\n\nAn expression of lived experience can contain more of the nexus of psychic life than any introspection can catch sight of. It draws from depths not illuminated by consciousness. But at the same time, it is characteristic of an expression of lived experience that its relation to the spiritual or human content expressed in it can only be made available to understanding within limits. Such expressions are not to be judged as true or false but as truthful or untruthful. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 227)\n\nA work of art is often more disclosive of human life in general than of the specific life of the artist. It may disclose something about the state of mind or the attitude of the artist, but a work of art will only be great if its \u201cspiritual content is liberated from its creator\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 228).\n\nAfter having analyzed these three kinds of manifestations of life, which can be called theoretical, practical and disclosive respectively, Dilthey proceeds to distinguish various modes of understanding them. Elementary understanding goes back to the associative relation that normally exists between an expression and what is expressed in it. It assimilates the meanings that are commonly attached to expressions in the community that we grow up in. Dilthey uses Hegel\u2019s concept of \u201cobjective spirit\u201d to account for this commonality of meaning. Objective spirit embodies \u201cthe manifold forms in which a commonality existing among individuals has objectified itself in the world of the senses\u201d, allowing the past to become \u201ca continuously enduring present for us\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 229). Whereas Hegel restricted objective spirit to the legal, economic and political aspects of historical life, Dilthey expands the concept to include not only the sciences, but also the triad of art, religion and philosophy that Hegel had assigned to absolute spirit. But most of all, objective spirit embodies the everyday, mundane aspects of life that we grow up with.\n\nFrom earliest childhood, the self is nurtured by this world of objective spirit. It is also the medium in which the understanding of other persons and their life-manifestations takes place. For everything in which spirit has objectified itself contains something that is common to the I and the Thou. Every square planted with trees, every room in which chairs are arranged, is understandable to us from childhood because human tendencies to set goals, produce order, and define values in common have assigned a place to every square and every object in the room. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 229)\n\nThis common background suffices for the elementary understanding of everyday life. But whenever the common meaning of life-manifestations is called into question for some reason, higher understanding becomes necessary. This can occur because of an apparent inconsistency among judgments or expressions, or because of an ambiguity that attaches to them or because of a complexity that we have not come upon before. Higher understanding cannot continue to rely on the common meanings of an expression that derive from a shared local background between speaker and listener, writer and reader. Higher understanding must replace the sphere of commonality, where inference by analogy suffices, with that of universality, where inductive inference must take over. Here the human sciences become relevant by offering the appropriate universal disciplinary contexts that can help to deal with uncertainties of interpretation. These universal systematic contexts can be social or political, economic or cultural, secular or religious. When expressions can be determined to be functioning in a specific disciplinary context then ambiguities tend to disappear. Literary scholars may be able to clarify a puzzling poetic passage by showing it to contain a literary allusion to a classical work with a foreign vocabulary. Or they can perhaps clarify it by seeing it as a way of accommodating certain technical demands of the genre as such. These cases of higher understanding establish a larger context of reference.\n\nHowever, higher understanding can also focus on more specific contexts related to the work or its author. The consideration of such contexts should come only at the conclusion of the interpretive process and represents a shift from exploring the relation \u201cof expression to what is expressed\u201d toward the relation \u201cof what has been produced to productivity\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 233). Here we move from meaning relationships to something like a productive relationship to which knowledge about the authors becomes relevant. But the first recourse here is to consult more of the products of the author. How does a sentence fit into a paragraph, a chapter, a whole work, or a corpus as a whole? Only if these contexts fail to resolve the problem may we consider psychological claims about the author. The understanding of the individuality of an author should only bring in psychological factors as a last resort. Dilthey writes\n\nwe understand individuals by means of their affinities, their commonalities. This process presupposes the connection between the universally human and individuation. On the basis of what is universal, we can see individuation extended to the manifoldness of human existence. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 233)\n\nHowever, the highest form of understanding is not the reconstruction of the individuality of the author. It involves something that has been confused with reconstruction, but is distinct. What Dilthey points to is a process of re-creation or re-experiencing, which he contrasts with understanding as such:\n\nUnderstanding as such is an operation running inverse to the course of production. But a fully sympathetic reliving requires that understanding go forward with the line of the events themselves. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 235)\n\nRe-experiencing develops understanding by completing the hermeneutical circle. If understanding goes \u201cback\u201d to the overall context, re-experiencing goes \u201cforward\u201d by following out the parts that give focus to the whole. A re-experiencing is not an actual re-construction but produces a better understanding that refines the original. This is made clear by the following example:\n\nA lyrical poem makes possible, through the sequence of its verses, the re-experiencing of a nexus of lived experience\u2014not the real one that stimulated the poet, but the one that, on its basis, the poet places in the mouth of an ideal person. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 235)\n\nWhereas the arts can expand the horizon of our lived experience by means of the ideal and imaginary means of fiction, history must do so by a process of structural articulation. The task of the human sciences is to analyze the productive nexus of history as it exhibits itself in stable formations or systematic structures. The productive nexus of history differs from the causal nexus of nature in producing values and arriving at purposes.\n\nThe carriers of this constant creation of values and goods in the world of human spirit are individuals, communities, and the cultural systems in which individuals cooperate. This cooperation is determined by the fact that, in order to realize values, individuals subject themselves to rules and set themselves purposes. All these modes of cooperation manifest a life-concern connected to the human essence that links individuals with each other\u2014a core, as it were, that cannot be grasped psychologically but is revealed in every such system of relations among human beings. (1910/SW.III, 175\u201376)\n\nEach such system can be regarded as being centered within itself on the basis of some function, whether it be economic, political, cultural or religious. The structures to be analyzed here provide various cross-sections of what takes place in history. But there are also relatively enduring socio-historical contexts that we can delineate as nation-states and historical periods.\n\nA nation organized as a state can be considered as a composite structural unity of productive systems. The individual members of a nation-state exhibit commonalities which produce a solidarity. And when cultural systems transcending the scope of this nation come into contact with other local productive systems, they begin to assume commonalities distinctive of that nation. Finally, integration of associations comes about through relations of \u201cdomination and obedience, as well as of community, that are combined in the sovereign will of a state\u201d (1910/SW.III, 196).\n\nNation-states are spatially defined historical wholes, but we can also delineate temporal composite wholes such as historical phases. What characterizes generations, ages and epochs according to Dilthey is that they are general, \u201cpermeating tendencies\u201d (1910/SW.III, 198). Each epoch defines a life-horizon by which people orient their life. \u201cSuch a horizon places life, life-concerns, life-experience, and thought-formation in a certain proportion\u201d (1910/SW.III, 198), which tends to restrain the way individuals can modify their outlooks. But an epoch is only a dominating tendency that will encompass opposing tendencies. In fact, a new epoch will come about when opposing tendencies take advantage of the inevitable tensions and dissatisfactions produced by any dominant tendency.\n\nThe structural analysis of history in terms of cultural systems and the external organization of society can be guided by the various human sciences. But a reflective mode of judgment is needed when historians try to make sense of the more composite structures of nation-states and epochs. History is both a judgmental art concerned with meaning and a science concerned with objective truth. Only historical reflection can create the right balance that will transform the conceptual cognition of the human sciences into adequate historical knowledge.\n\n2.3.3 The Categories of Historical Knowledge.\n\nThis shift to historical knowledge is the main theme of the notes (ca. 1910) for a second volume of The Formation of the Historical World in the Human Sciences (1910) which were published posthumously in 1927 as Drafts for a Critique of Historical Reason. Here Dilthey analyzes the categories of life that are relevant to historical knowledge. He distinguishes between formal and real categories. Formal categories stem from elementary logical operations that are at work in all apprehension: they include the processes of comparing, noting sameness, differentiating and relating. Although such elementary operations are prediscursive, they provide the basis for discursive thought. The prediscursive noting of sameness prepares the way for the unifying concepts of discursive thought and the process of relating provides the basis for synthetic procedures. These prediscursive and discursive modes of thought account for the formal categories of unity, plurality, identity, difference, degree and relation that are shared by the natural and human sciences.\n\nBut the real categories are not the same in the natural and human sciences. Whereas time is an ideal abstract form for the natural sciences, for the human sciences it has an experienced content. It is experienced as advancing into the future and \u201calways contains the memory of what has just been present\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 216). The relation between the past and the present becomes the source for the category of meaning which is Dilthey\u2019s main historical category. The present never is in the sense of being observable, but it can be understood meaningfully to the extent that the past asserts its presence in it. When the present is merely lived, \u201cthe positive or negative value of the realities that fill it are experienced through feeling. And when we face the future, the category of purpose arises through a projective attitude\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 222). Meaning, value, and purpose are the three central categories of the human sciences and each relates to time in its own way. What is valued by feeling focuses on the momentary present, but for the will everything in the present tends to be subordinated to some future purpose. Only the category of meaning can expand the present into a presence that overcomes the mere juxtaposition or subordination of the various aspects of life to each other. The understanding of meaning involves the encompassing sense of knowledge that attempts to relate cognition to evaluation and the setting of goals.\n\nDilthey\u2019s distinction between the natural and human sciences is not a metaphysical distinction. For that reason he does not create a dualism between nature as the domain of causality and history as the domain of freedom. There are determining forces at work in history because it cannot be divorced from natural conditions. But to understand how individuals participate in history we must replace the purely external relation of cause and effect with the integral relation of \u201cagency and suffering, of action and reaction\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 219).\n\nThe doing and undergoing that characterizes human involvement in history can be brought home most forcefully in autobiography.\n\nHere a life-course stands as an external phenomenon from which understanding seeks to discover what produced it within a particular environment. The person who understands it is the same as the one who created it. This results in a special intimacy of understanding. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 221)\n\nAutobiography begins with what memory has selected as significant life-moments, which reflection then gives a certain coherence. Thereby the initial tasks of \u201cexplicating a historical nexus are already half solved by life itself\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 221).\n\nBut the fact that history derives a special intimacy through the capacity for autobiography does not mean that we should be content to understand history through individuals alone. This also becomes evident in relation to Dilthey\u2019s own work as a biographer of Schleiermacher. It became ever more clear to Dilthey that his biography could not solve its task of understanding the life of Schleiermacher without considering the intellectual life of Berlin in which he so actively participated. A biography is likely to bring more contextual conditions into play than an autobiography, but to understand how historical personalities are actively engaged in their context, full comprehension is not needed. Dilthey writes that such an individual\n\ndoes not face a limitless play of forces in the historical world: he dwells in the sphere of the state, religion, or science\u2014in brief, in a distinctive life-system or in a constellation of them. The inner structure of such a constellation draws the individual into it, shapes him, and determines the direction of his productivity. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 266\u201367)\n\nYet this very placement allows individuals to in turn exert an influence on their immediate surroundings.\n\nWhen turning to the nexus of universal history, we must move beyond the individual life-courses focused on by autobiography and biography. Universal-historical understanding cannot ignore the results of autobiography and biography, but it will focus more on the history of nations, cultural systems, and the external organizations of society.\n\nEach of these histories has its own center to which the processes are related and consequently the values, purposes, and significance that result from this relationship. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 291)\n\nAnthropological reflection expects history to teach what life is and yet history is dependent on life. There is a hermeneutical circularity here that could be escaped \u201cif unconditioned norms, purposes, or values [could] set the standard for contemplating an apprehending history\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 281). Unlike his Neo-Kantian contemporaries such as Hermann Cohen and Heinrich Rickert, Dilthey is not willing to accept unconditional values that transcend life. The spiritual nexus of history \u201cis that of life itself insofar as life produces connectedness under the conditions of its natural environment\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 280). Life is the ultimate context behind which we cannot go. It is the horizon of productivity which encompasses the organic and the mental, but cannot be defined by either. Since \u201clife is intimately related to temporal fulfillment\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 249), historicity is part of its essence. Consequently, the objective validity that is to be attached to any value cannot be separated from our temporal engagement with life. Values are not simply given or imposed by life, but are produced as part of the human process of explicating the meaning of history. In light of Dilthey\u2019s skepticism about transcendent unconditional values, it may seem surprising that he presented an ethical system that expects human beings to make unconditional commitments that are self-binding.\n\nIn 1890 Dilthey offered a lecture course at the University of Berlin that was posthumously published with the title System of Ethics (1890b). Here Dilthey sets himself the task of developing a \u201cpsycho-ethical\u201d approach that is rooted in \u201canthropological-historical analysis\u201d (1890b/GS.X, 79). Whereas traditional psychology has analyzed feelings mainly as responses to sense impressions that come from without, a psycho-ethical understanding of the feelings that can motivate us to act must be rooted in anthropological analysis of our drives, instincts and desires. Instead of focusing on the intellectual processes whereby human beings adapt to their surroundings, Dilthey argues that most of our responses are basically instinctive. The feelings that measure the effect the world has on us are not just the subjective aspect of our representations of the world. These feelings are rooted in certain drives among which the drive for sociability and a sense of solidarity are central (1890b/GS.X, 101).\n\nThis human solidarity involves a sense of movement with (Mitbewegung) others. All psychological forms of sympathy or feeling with (Mitgef\u00fchl) others, whether it be compassion (Mitleid) or shared joy (Mitfreude) or empathy (Mitempfindung) are derivable from this more basic anthropological Mitbewegung of solidarity (1890b/GS.X, 74\u201377).\n\nWe are naturally moved by and engaged with others around us, but the strength of this solidarity will vary. The extent to which we are motivated by a sense of solidarity is a function of the sphere of commonality of objective spirit that we grow up in. Our anthropological sense of solidarity and its Mitbewegung provides a more positive incentive for sociability than Hume\u2019s sympathy and Schopenhauer\u2019s compassion. But even solidarity is a mere natural incentive which does not become ethical until it is transformed into a more active or participatory incentive of benevolence (1890b/GS.X, 70).\n\nAs he develops his anthropologically based approach to ethics, Dilthey leads up to three main ethical incentives. One of them is the benevolence (Wohlwollen) that we related to human solidarity. The other two incentives are to strive for what is right (Rechtschaffenheit) and to perfect oneself in a socially legitimate manner (Vollkommenheit). These three ethical incentives had already been predelineated as moral principles in Dilthey\u2019s Habilitationsschrift of 1864 entitled \u201cVersuch einer Analyse des moralischen Bewu\u00dftseins\u201d (see 1864/GS.VI, 26\u201327). In fact, the concluding section 12 of the System of Ethics is taken almost exclusively from this earlier work, where the ethical incentives were formulated as three moral oughts. This raises the question how it is possible to move from anthropologically derived ethical incentives that are a posteriori to ultimately arrive at moral oughts that are a priori. There is a crucial subsection 9.3 that prepares us for this transition. It is entitled \u201cThe Consciousness of Commitment (Bindung) in Duty and Right\u201d. Here Dilthey is quite explicit that the commitment to do what is right demands a consciousness that cannot be conceived as a mere reflex to external pressure coming from our sense of solidarity with others. The commitment to do what is right must come from within on the basis of respect for others as ends in themselves (1890b/GS.X, 102). The mere life-value of solidarity is elevated to the spiritual value of respect for others. Having replaced Humean sympathy with benevolence, Dilthey now engages Kantian duty as part of his analysis of moral self-reflection. But instead of appealing to respect for the law to justify doing what is right, Dilthey derives respect from a commitment that is based on both a \u201cfidelity to oneself and respect for the self-worth of other persons\u201d (1890b/GS.X, 102). The sense of obligation (Verbindlichkeit) that comes with this commitment (Bindung) involves a recognition of a reciprocal human connectedness (Verbundensein) (1890b/GS.X, 71, 109) rather than a one-sided dependence on a higher law.\n\nFormally Dilthey moves even closer to Kant at the end of the lectures by acknowledging that ultimately we must make \u201cmoral judgments\u201d that are \u201cunconditional\u201d and \u201csynthetic a priori\u201d (1890b/GS.X, 108). Although Dilthey had rejected the possibility of synthetic a priori theoretical judgments for outer experience, he is now willing to speak of synthetic a priori practical judgments for inner experience. Had Dilthey published his 1890 lectures himself he would probably have tempered the language that was imported from his early essay. But he clearly still thinks that morality requires judgmental assent to oughts that are unconditionally self-binding.\n\nThe normative implications of anthropological reflection about life and history also led Dilthey to address the value of worldviews. Just as the nature of universal history forces us to conceive of history as more than a human science, so worldviews are more broadly based attempts at acquiring a unified perspective on life. The sciences are by their nature partial and cannot provide a comprehensive worldview. A worldview attempts to provide not only a cognitive picture of the world, but also an estimation of what in life is valuable and worth striving for. Worldviews have been developed in literary, religious and philosophical works. Philosophers have produced metaphysical formulations of worldviews that attempt to give them a universal conceptual determinacy. Dilthey analyzes three recurrent types of such metaphysical formulations: naturalism, the idealism of freedom and objective idealism. The naturalism of Democritus, Hobbes and others derives everything from what can be cognized and is pluralistic in structure; idealism of freedom as found in Plato, Kant and others insists on the sovereignty of the will and is dualistic; objective idealism as found in Heraclitus, Leibniz and Hegel affirms reality as the embodiment of a harmonious set of values and is monistic. The three types of metaphysical worldviews are incommensurable in that each sets its priorities differently. Dilthey finds naturalism too reductive; his ethical views incline him toward the idealism of freedom; aesthetically he felt attracted towards objective idealism. No metaphysical formulation can have more than relative validity because it attempts to arrive at a totalization that transcends experience. Literary expressions of worldviews tend to be more successful because they do not claim to be totalizing. All that is humanly possible is to probe reality on the basis of life-experience and to settle for more limited philosophical insights informed by historical understanding. Ultimately, our reflective understanding of life and history must remain determinate-indeterminate.\n\nWe can see certain parallels to Dilthey\u2019s attempt to replace metaphysical systems with more informal life-based \u201cmeta-physical reflection\u201d or worldviews in Rudolf Carnap, who studied in Jena with Dilthey\u2019s student Herman Nohl before moving to Vienna. Carnap\u2019s paper \u201cThe Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language\u201d refers to Dilthey and his students as positive counterexamples to varieties of meaningless metaphysical systems as found in Fichte, Hegel and Heidegger. Another essay by Carnap entitled \u201cMetaphysics as Expression of an Attitude to Life\u201d acknowledges the importance of Dilthey\u2019s notion of \u201cLebensgefuehl\u201d. Carnap\u2019s analogue for Dilthey\u2019s \u201cWeltanschauung\u201d is \u201cWeltauffassung\u201d. Carnap also incorporated a more or less Diltheyan conception of the human sciences in his Der logische Aufbau der Welt of 1928. Carnap refers to Dilthey\u2019s Introduction to the Human Sciences, but replaces its language of \u201cfacts of consciousness\u201d with that of \u201celementary experiences\u201d. He does not refer to Dilthey\u2019s last main work Der Aufbau der geschichtlichen Welt in den Geisteswissenschaften, but he did read Hans Freyer\u2019s Theorie des objektiven Geistes, a work heavily influenced by Dilthey\u2019s Aufbau and its approach to objective spirit as the medium of intersubjective communication. Carnap writes in his own Aufbau:\n\nonly the more recent history of philosophy (since Dilthey) has called attention to the methodological and object-theoretical distinctness of the domain of the human sciences (Geisteswissenschaften). (Carnap 1928: 23)\n\nCarnap acknowledges the independent nature of spiritual (geistigen) or intersubjective objects such as political states and social customs. They differ from psychical and physical objects in that they can \u201csurvive\u201d even though the original subjects that generated them \u201cperish and other subjects take their place\u201d (Carnap 1928: 23). It is not clear why Dilthey\u2019s work on the methods of the sciences and his empirical approach to experience did not earn him more serious consideration by the Vienna Circle as a whole and other analytically oriented philosophers. But what is evident is that his theory of understanding (Verstehen) came to be widely misinterpreted as a kind of empathy. Although Dilthey had sharply differentiated between understanding and empathy, Carnap spoke of the understanding of others as an intuitive act that involves a measure of empathy, but which can be cognitively vetted in part through the analysis of objective manifestations ranging from gestures, linguistic expressions to practical actions (Carnap 1928: 55, 143). Subsequent discussions of Dilthey\u2019s theory of Verstehen by analytic philosophers such as Theodor Abel, Ernest Nagel and Arthur Danto went further by reducing it to \u201cempathic identification\u201d. Later Danto recognized that this is not the case and acknowledged that \u201cVerstehen is a very brilliant notion, utterly misconceived heretofore by crass philosophical critics, myself included\u201d (Danto 1970: 215). Verstehen is not some immediate projection of ourselves into others, but stands for a deliberate process that finds the proper context to relate others and their objectifications to what is already familiar to us. It is a reflective mode of inquiry that provides the framework for more specific explanations, whether causal or rational."}, {"url": "https://plato.sydney.edu.au/entries/////neo-kantianism/", "page_content": "First published Fri May 18, 2018\n\nThis article has three parts. After giving an overview of the common features of Neo-Kantians, section 2 is devoted to the Marburg School, and section 3 to the Southwest (SW) School. The Neo-Kantians were systematic and comprehensive philosophers, writing on nearly every area of philosophy. Instead of attempting to cover all areas of their thought, this article will focus on the areas of their philosophies that were most central to their thought, and that were most influential on their contemporaries and successors. Accordingly, each section begins with each school\u2019s conception of philosophy (sections 2.1 and 3.1), moves on to their theory of knowledge (2.2 and 3.2), and ends with the philosophy of the special sciences most characteristic of each school (2.3 on Marburg philosophy of physics, and 3.3 on SW philosophy of history). (Three supplementary documents cover philosophies of logic, psychology, and mathematics in the Marburg School.)\n\nNeo-Kantians [ 2 ] were not only intellectually influential, they were also great successes academically in Germany. They held prominent academic chairs, and were successful in placing their students, shaping curricula, and editing important journals and books. Most of the German philosophers who came to prominence in Germany after the First World War were educated by Neo-Kantians\u2014an impressive and comprehensive list of students that includes Rudolf Carnap, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Martin Heidegger, and Hans Reichenbach. [ 3 ] But the reputation of Neo-Kantianism shifted dramatically in the decades after 1918. Neo-Kantians were associated with the old order, and so became the primary targets of the many philosophers (including their own students) wanting to make a completely fresh start. The subsequent geopolitical upheavals, not the least of which was Hitler\u2019s rise to power in 1933, nearly erased the institutional memory of Neo-Kantianism within the emerging analytic and continental traditions. However, in the last few decades, historians of philosophy of all stripes have begun to re-discover both the historical and philosophical significance of Neo-Kantianism.\n\nNeo-Kantianism was the dominant philosophical movement in Germany from roughly 1870 until the First World War. This movement drew inspiration from a diverse cast of philosophers\u2014principally, Kuno Fischer (Fischer 1860), Hermann von Helmholtz (Helmholtz 1867, 1878), Friedrich Lange (Lange 1866), Otto Liebmann (Liebmann 1865), and Eduard Zeller (Zeller 1862))\u2014who in the middle of the nineteenth century were calling for a return to Kant\u2019s philosophy as an alternative to both speculative metaphysics and materialism (Beiser 2014b). During the 1870s, the movement formed into two schools, one based around Hermann Cohen at Marburg University and another based in southwest Germany (in the province of Baden) around Wilhelm Windelband. Later members of the Marburg School include Paul Natorp and Ernst Cassirer; later members of the Southwest School include Heinrich Rickert and Emil Lask. [ 1 ]\n\n1. Common Features of Neo-Kantians\n\nThe Neo-Kantians did not always think of themselves as members of a common movement. Though the members of the Marburg school very clearly identified with one another, and the members of the Southwest school identified themselves with one another, the two schools initially[4] made little effort to present themselves as part of a common movement. Their doctrines were different in some fundamental ways, and they often criticized one another\u2019s positions. Nevertheless, there were some common features of Neo-Kantians of both schools\u2014common features that made it natural for their contemporaries and for historians today to talk about them together. This section presents seven common features of the Neo-Kantians. These seven common features make it possible to distinguish, in a principled philosophical way, between the (\u201cclassical\u201d) Neo-Kantians of the Marburg and Southwest schools and the various \u201cback to Kant\u201d philosophers of the mid nineteenth century and the assorted philosophers contemporary with the Neo-Kantians who were \u201cneo-Kantian\u201d in some broader sense. For example, Helmholtz and Lange did not share the Neo-Kantians\u2019 anti-psychologism or commitment to the transcendental method (features 2 and 3 below), while Alois Riehl did not share their idealistic theory of objective validity (feature 6).\n\n1. Most obviously, the Neo-Kantians thought of themselves as reviving, defending, and extending Kant\u2019s philosophy. They self-consciously adopted Kant\u2019s vocabulary, and some of his key ideas and arguments. They wrote commentaries on Kant\u2019s major writings, and would often present their own positive views in the form of commentaries or interpretations of Kant. Nevertheless, they never considered themselves to be orthodox Kantians, nor did they see the value in defending Kant\u2019s views on all topics. As Windelband famously said in the preface to the 1883 first edition of Windelband 1915,[5] \u201cto understand Kant means to go beyond him\u201d. And, as Natorp explained,\n\nit was never anyone\u2019s wish nor intent to cling to Kant\u2019s doctrines in an absolute way. Talk of an orthodox Kantianism within the Marburg School was never justified. (Natorp 1912a: 180)\n\nIn fact, there were some core Kantian ideas that the Neo-Kantians self-consciously rejected. They rejected the doctrine of the thing-in-itself as incoherent and unnecessary (Windelband 1910: 323), or radically reinterpreted talk of things-in-themselves as talk of a postulated final and complete theory of the world (Cohen 1885: 503ff.). Their rejection of Kant\u2019s dualism of appearances and things-in-themselves was closely related to their rethinking of Kant\u2019s distinction between two \u201cstems\u201d of cognition: sensibility and understanding. The Marburg philosophers came to fundamentally reject this distinction, while the Southwest Neo-Kantians (while maintaining the irreducibility of intuitions to concepts) still rejected the idea that intuitions are the result of a mind-independent thing-in-itself affecting sensibility. Though the Neo-Kantians took as fundamental to their philosophies the existence of substantive a priori concepts and principles that make knowledge possible, they did not accept that the categories and principles identified in the Critique of Pure Reason were complete or fixed for all time. In particular, Marburg Neo-Kantians believed that some of the categories and principles that Kant identified were relative to the scientific theories of Kant\u2019s day, and that the categories and principles could change as scientists develop new empirical theories. Southwest Neo-Kantians, on the other hand, were keen to argue that history is just as much a science as mathematical physics, and they thought that Kant\u2019s critical project had to be extended in order to identify the a priori elements in history. Last, the classical Neo-Kantians held that transcendental philosophy is distinct and independent of empirical psychology, even though (they argued) Kant himself was not always innocent of psychologism, despite the fact that Kant\u2019s philosophy when rightly interpreted is the basis for a sound anti-psychologism (Cohen 1883: \u00a78).\n\n2. The Neo-Kantians put forward a suite of arguments to show that philosophy is independent of psychology. Logic, or the theory of knowledge, concerns what is objective, not what is subjective, as psychology does (Cohen 1883: \u00a76). It does not concern itself with the mental processes of subjects, with their cognitive apparatus, or with empirical results about human sense organs or nervous system. As Windelband 1883 put it, psychologistic philosophers employ the \u201cgenetic method\u201d trying to find the justification of some part of our knowledge by tracing empirically its causal antecedents. The correct method, however, is the \u201ccritical method\u201d, which distinguishes what he calls \u201cfactual\u201d from \u201cteleological\u201d or normative validity. The critical method is the only correct method, because the fact that we do believe something, or even that all humans by some biological necessity have to believe it, does not yet solve the critical question: what we ought to believe.[6] For these reasons, the Neo-Kantians sharply distinguished a priority from innateness\u2014a distinction they claimed was obscured by philosophers such as Helmholtz and Lange.\n\nA return to an anti-psychologistic Kant was the Neo-Kantians\u2019 solution to what the historian Herbert Schn\u00e4delbach (1984: 5) called the \u201cidentity crisis\u201d that faced philosophy in the middle of the nineteenth century. Given the collapse of the conception of philosophy shared by post-Kantian speculative idealists, and the concurrent spectacular advances made in the sciences, philosophers were left questioning what (if anything) was left as the distinctive subject matter and method of philosophy (Beiser 2014a: Ch.1). In particular, in opposing psychologism, the Neo-Kantians were staking out a conception of philosophy that avoids the naturalism defended by many German philosophers in the decades after Hegel\u2019s death (Cassirer 1912). According to naturalistic conceptions of philosophy, the method of philosophy is in fact not distinguishable from that of natural science, and the theory of knowledge just becomes applied empirical psychology. Nevertheless, the Neo-Kantians shared with these naturalistic philosophers a deep distrust of speculative metaphysics: they denied that philosophy could deliver knowledge of the supersensible, could deduce facts of the special sciences from a priori principles knowable in some special philosophical way, or that philosophy could even be done in ignorance of the results of the sciences.\n\n3. This via media, this third way of doing philosophy, they found in the transcendental method. The two schools conceived of the transcendental method differently. For Cohen and his school, philosophy begins with a fact\u2014paradigmatically, the fact of science\u2014and investigates the conditions that make that fact possible. For Windelband and his school, the transcendental question is understood teleologically: given certain fundamental goals, such as knowing the truth, or doing good, or experiencing what is beautiful, what is necessary for achieving these values? Still, though, there was a common core to both schools\u2019 conceptions of the transcendental method: they wanted to identify those objective elements within some part of human culture (say, physics, history, or ethics) that made possible objective validity (say, the objective validity of physical theories, historical narratives, or ethical claims). Adherence to the transcendental method led the Neo-Kantians to reject skepticism. Philosophical reflection begins with the fact that scientists have developed successful theories of the physical world; or with the universal validity of the value of truth. So no room is left for the skeptical worry that scientific theories do not in fact deliver empirical knowledge, or that truth is in fact unattainable (Windelband 1883: 280).\n\n4. The object of the transcendental method, for the Neo-Kantians, is culture. Often, they approached human culture using Kant\u2019s three-fold distinction between knowledge, ethics, aesthetics. Because they saw the achievements of science as one of the most significant aspects of modern culture, a good portion of their writings concern the philosophy of science. As Kant applied the transcendental method to Newtonian science, they sought to apply the method to the best science of their day. Typically (not exclusively), the Marburg philosophers were concerned with the physics and mathematics of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, which (they emphasized) differed fundamentally from that of Kant\u2019s own day. The Southwest Neo-Kantians, on the other hand, were more concerned with the so-called \u201cGeisteswissenschaften\u201d (the \u201chuman sciences\u201d), which had come into their own in the nineteenth century and now deserved (they argued) to be recognized as autonomous and fully scientific (despite the fact that Kant himself had sharply distinguished history from science (Kant 1786: Ak 4:468)).\n\n5. Neo-Kantian philosophy of science is distinctive in its focus on the methodology of science. Thus, Neo-Kantian philosophy of physics is not so much concerned directly with what matter is, but with how mathematical physics comes to know about matter. Neo-Kantian philosophy of history is not concerned with grand theories concerning what drives history, but with what makes the methodology of a historian different from that of a physicist or empirical psychologist. Philosophy of science, for them, is the logic of the sciences\u2014in the extended sense of \u201clogic\u201d that includes theory of knowledge and scientific methodology. And, true to their anti-psychologistic conception of logic, Neo-Kantian accounts of scientific methodology are not intended to be empirical descriptions of what scientists do, but accounts that identify objective norms, or the fundamental principles and concepts of a particular science.[7] Philosophy of science thus becomes a second order discipline, different in kind from the natural sciences (thus avoiding naturalism). But because Neo-Kantian philosophy of science adheres to the transcendental method, it avoids the errors of speculative metaphysics. It does not, for instance, try to derive the concept of matter or life a priori, but is content to demonstrate that these concepts are necessary conditions for physics and biology. Since philosophy of science for the Neo-Kantians is a second order discipline, they were in general committed to a non-revisionist attitude. According to Rickert, philosophy\n\ndoes not claim to direct science onto the paths it should take. On the contrary, it proposes only to follow science with a view to understanding it. (1902: 340)\n\nFor Cassirer, \u201ccritical philosophy \u2026 does not seek to direct the sciences but to understand them\u201d (1907b: 31).\n\n6. Since the goal of transcendental philosophy, for the Neo-Kantians, is to identify those elements within some part of human culture that are necessary for its objective validity, they were also led to investigate the nature of objective validity itself (Natorp 1887, Rickert 1915).[8] The two schools construed the question of objective validity differently. The Marburg philosophers emphasized objectivity, and gave an account of objectivity in terms of constant laws (see section 2.2). The Southwest Neo-Kantians emphasized the question of validity\u2014specifically the validity of values (section 3.2). For both schools, a central issue in the investigation of objective validity is the question of transcendence: what does it mean that the object is independent of our knowledge and provides the standard for its truth?\n\nThere are four key ideas that are common to the Southwest and Marburg theories of objective validity. First, both schools emphasized the centrality of judgments (as opposed to concepts or intuitions), as the kind of representation that first makes objective validity possible (Rickert 1915: Ch.3; Cohen 1902: \u00a710\u201311). Second, the Neo-Kantians were emphatic that the objective validity of knowledge does not consist in its being a copy (Abbild) or mirror of the object (Windelband 1910; Rickert 1934; Cassirer 1910: Ch.1; Rickert 1915: Ch.2). This \u201ccopy theory\u201d of knowledge is inconsistent with a third key idea, that the objective validity of every area of culture is made possible by substantive a priori principles. The a priori principles that make possible some part of human culture are again not interpreted psychologistically: they are not features of the minds of individual subjects, they are not discovered empirically, and their necessity is not grounded in the empirical fact that they are universally accepted. These a priori principles are parts of culture\u2014they are its fundamental norms or laws. Fourth, the Neo-Kantians described themselves as \u201cidealists\u201d. Idealism meant different things to different Neo-Kantians (see section 2.2 and 3.2). But all Neo-Kantians shared the view that knowledge requires a priori elements that are not present in what is given in immediate intuition. Knowledge, then, requires a \u201creshaping\u201d or \u201ctransformation\u201d of what is given. The copy theory that they reject would in this sense be a kind of \u201crealism\u201d. Of course, Neo-Kantian idealism must be rigorously distinguished from other kinds of idealisms. As noted earlier, they reject Kant\u2019s doctrine of the thing-in-itself, and they emphatically do not believe that objects are in any way subjective or dependent on the representations of individual psychological subjects.\n\n7. There is one final common feature of Neo-Kantian philosophers that should not be overlooked: the Neo-Kantians were great historians of philosophy. It\u2019s not surprising that the Neo-Kantians wrote extensively on Kant, producing commentaries (e.g., Cohen 1885; Cassirer 1918) and critical editions of his writing. But the Neo-Kantians also wrote extensively on other philosophers, ancient and modern, and on the history of science and mathematics (e.g., Windelband 1891; Cassirer 1906, 1907a). These historical works were not thought of as side projects, but as essential aspects of their philosophy. Neo-Kantians did not sharply distinguish history of philosophy from philosophy (see Introduction to Windelband 1891; \u00a7I of the 1902 version of Cohen 1898).\n\n2. The Marburg School\n\nThe intellectual beginnings of the Marburg School can be traced to 1871, when Hermann Cohen (1842\u20131918) published the first edition of his Kants Theorie der Erfahrung (Kant\u2019s Theory of Experience), which interpreted Kant in an anti-psychologistic way and found in Kant\u2019s first Critique the expression of a novel way of doing philosophy: the transcendental method. In 1873 Cohen did his Habilitation in Marburg under Friedrich Lange, who had moved there in 1872. He was promoted as Professor Extraordinarius in 1875, and then took over Lange\u2019s chair in 1876 after his death. When Paul Natorp (1854\u20131924) moved to Marburg in 1880 (writing his Habilitation\u2014Natorp 1881\u2014under Cohen and being promoted to Professor in 1893), the \u201cMarburg\u201d school as an institutional force was born.\n\nCohen\u2019s work culminated in a three part system of philosophy, modeled after Kant\u2019s own tripartite division of critical philosophy: The Logic of Pure Knowledge (Cohen 1902), The Ethics of Pure Will (Cohen 1904), and the Aesthetics of Pure Feeling (Cohen 1912). His most influential works, though, were his interpretation of Kant, principally in Kant\u2019s Theory of Experience, which was significantly revised and expanded in a second edition (Cohen 1885), and his works in the philosophy of science and mathematics: The Principle of the Infinitesimal Method (Cohen 1883), and his introduction to the sixth edition of Lange\u2019s History of Materialism (Cohen 1898).[9]\n\nNatorp\u2019s most influential writings are in the interpretation of Plato, the philosophy of science, and in the philosophy of psychology. Starting with his habilitation (\u201cDescartes\u2019s Theory of Knowledge: A Study in the Pre-history of Criticism\u201d) in 1881, Natorp extended the reach of the Marburg school as historians of philosophy beyond Kant to other philosophers who in various ways anticipated the Kantian themes important to the Marburgers. Natorp\u2019s most significant work in this vein was his book Plato\u2019s Theory of Ideas (1903), which gave a serious scholarly argument for the dating of Plato\u2019s dialogues, in addition to a novel \u201ccritical\u201d reading of Platonic ideas. In the philosophy of science, his systematic work The Logical Foundations of the Exact Sciences (1910) gives a systematic philosophy of logic, arithmetic, geometry, and physics that engages with contemporary science and mathematics in a more comprehensive and detailed way than any of Cohen\u2019s works. Last, in a series of works in the philosophy of psychology (culminating in General Psychology According to the Critical Method (1912b)), Natorp defended a novel conception of psychology as the science of the subjective.\n\nAmong the many students of Cohen and Natorp\u2019s who identified themselves with the Marburg school, the most accomplished and influential was undoubtedly Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945). After writing his dissertation under Cohen in 1899 on Descartes\u2019s philosophy of mathematics and science, Cassirer moved to Berlin, where he worked as a Privatdozent (though not a Professor, which was ruled out by institutional anti-Semitism[10]). His most important works before 1914 are in the history of philosophy (especially the massive, two volume Problem of Knowledge (Cassirer 1906, 1907a), which follows the development of the philosophy of science from the late Renaissance to Kant), and the philosophy of the exact sciences (Substance and Function, 1910; Einstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity, 1921). Starting in 1921, Cassirer\u2019s philosophy broadened into a \u201cphilosophy of symbolic forms\u201d, which differs in some fundamental ways from the classic works of his teachers.\n\n2.1 Conception of Philosophy: The Transcendental Method\n\nThe core commitment of the Marburg school was to a philosophical method: \u201cthe transcendental method\u201d (Natorp 1912a; Cohen 1883: \u00a77\u20139; Cohen 1885: \u00a712; Richardson 2006). The method, as Natorp describes it, comes in two steps. In the first step, the philosopher identifies some \u201cfact\u201d of culture. Theoretical philosophy begins with the \u201cfact of science\u201d; practical philosophy with the fact of \u201csocial order\u201d; aesthetics with the fact of \u201cartistic creation\u201d. These facts are concrete, detailed, and \u201chistorically verifiable\u201d. For instance, a theoretical philosopher begins by investigating the best scientific theories of her contemporaries. In this first step, the philosopher is like a fact collector, investigating the methods, important concepts and laws of that aspect of culture, including the historical development of that area of culture up to the present day. In the second step, however, the philosopher goes beyond fact-collecting to identifying those aspects of that area of culture that make its objective validity possible. As they put it, this involves identifying the \u201claws\u201d or \u201cform\u201d of that area of culture. Their model here is Kant in the Prolegomena. As they read Kant, he began by identifying within the best scientific theory of his time\u2014Newton\u2019s\u2014the fundamental laws, concepts, and methods (which are contained in Kant\u2019s Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science). The second step is showing how these laws, concepts, and methods are made possible by even more fundamental concepts and laws, which are contained in the Critique itself\u2014laws which make objective validity possible.\n\nThere are a few aspects of this method that need to be emphasized. First, the second step in the method involves much more than just identifying a class of basic laws and concepts. If a philosopher were to axiomatize a physical theory, even a fundamental one, for the Marburgers that would be only the first step. A philosopher also needs a story of how just these laws and just these concepts make it possible for the theory to make true claims about objects\u2014a story that will require a very general account of objective validity itself. Second, the transcendental method requires demonstrating the unity of culture. A philosophy of arithmetic should show how the laws of arithmetic fit in with the laws of geometry and analysis to form the unity of mathematics; how the laws of mathematics are preconditions of all natural science to form the unity of science; and all the way up to the unity of culture. Third, these two steps are interrelated. The notion of objective validity itself is analyzed in step two on the basis of reflection on the details of concrete culture from step one; the philosopher in step one collects the relevant facts about an area of culture because she has in mind the step two goal of explaining its objective validity, in a unified account of the validity of all culture. Fourth, the method is non-skeptical, non-revisionary, and unconcerned with certainty. Since it takes an area of culture as a fact, it rules out radical skepticism about the validity of an area of culture, and it has no room to advocate a radical revision in that area of culture. Though the goal of the transcendental method is to provide foundations for culture, these foundations are not meant to be certain. Transcendental logic, one might say, is a semantic, not a Cartesian project. Fifth, though the transcendental method is rooted in the concrete facts of contemporary culture, it is nevertheless possible and even necessary for a philosopher to take sides on contested questions within culture. A philosopher is not a bystander in culture. So, for instance, Cohen argues for infinitesimal over limit methods in the calculus, for Herz\u2019s mechanics over its rivals, for liberal democracy over monarchy. After all, the transcendental philosopher, having studied the method of an area of culture and its long historical development, can show that one party in a dispute has departed in some fundamental way from that method. And the philosopher also has her eye on the question of the foundations of the objective validity of an area of culture (and its integration into a synthetic account of the objective validity of all culture), and so can intervene to show that one approach in a controversy is better suited to make objective validity possible.\n\nSince the transcendental method begins with the fact of culture, Marburg Neo-Kantians reject the possibility of speculative metaphysics. Transcendental philosophy as they understand it is also distinct from and independent of psychology. Though the goal of the theory of knowledge is to understand what makes \u201cexperience\u201d possible, they understand experience in a radically non-psychological way. As Cohen puts in (1898: x, my translation):\n\nThe transcendental method does not research the principles of human reason but rather the foundation of science that conditions scientific validity. Our organization is, insofar as it comes into question in general, a question of psychology; and there is at least no methodological means for procuring secure, scientific, and exact information from the ultimate and simplest parts of our mental essence. But the sciences lie before us in books. What makes them into sciences, wherein their character of generality and necessity rests, from which concepts their epistemological validity within their region can be derived, what tools and ways of knowing explain in its validity those historical facts of knowledge\u2014the sciences\u2014this is a methodological question, this is the question, which the sciences themselves pose, whenever they feel the impulse to think about their own principles\u2014this and nothing else is the transcendental question.\n\nThe fact of science does not occur in the minds of individual scientists; it lies before us in books. \u201cExperience\u201d is not a representation in the mind of a knower; it is the objective content. \u201cExperience\u201d is virtually equated with mathematical natural science, and a paradigm \u201cexperience\u201d is Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation. What makes experience (in this non-psychological sense) possible is \u201ca priori\u201d, now interpreted in a radically non-psychological sense as elements of the content of some aspect of culture that makes the objective validity of that culture possible. This new conception of the a priori, radically distinct from innateness and independent of any facts about human minds discoverable by empirical psychology, is articulated in Cohen\u2019s Kant\u2019s Theory of Experience. It is here that Cohen\u2019s Neo-Kantianism breaks decisively with the Kantianism of Lange and Helmholtz. In his book, Cohen distinguishes between the \u201cmetaphysical a priori\u201d and the \u201ctranscendental a priori\u201d (1885: 109; cf. 1902: 44). The metaphysical a priori are the basic structures of our thinking that we can discover by introspection or empirical study; these are irrelevant to the transcendental philosopher (unless she is doing philosophy of psychology). The transcendental a priori, on the other hand, are those aspects of the content of science that make objective validity possible. Thus, the relationship between the a priori and experience is not like the relationship between a mental apparatus and its acts. It is a logical relationship, more like the relation between an axiom and a theorem (Cassirer 1918: 151, 153)\u2014though with the important qualification that the a priori laws are not just axioms, but axioms that have the special semantic function of making objective validity possible.\n\nThe fact of culture is not static, but dynamic. As Natorp memorably put it (1912a: 184; 1910: Ch.1, \u00a74; 1903: 366ff), the fact is not a \u201cfactum\u201d (a thing done) but \u201cfieri\u201d (becoming). Culture changes; one scientific theory replaces another. In keeping with the transcendental method, only a Newtonian could have written what Kant wrote; but the transcendental method just as emphatically requires that later transcendental philosophers rethink the doctrines of the first Critique in light of the advances in mathematics and natural science since Newton. This appreciation for the historically evolving character of culture has two consequences. First, the transcendental a priori is not absolute, but relative to the current best physical theories. Second, Marburg Neo-Kantians have an additional transcendental task that Kant himself did not fully recognize: to understand how it is possible that the changes in an area of culture can themselves be objectively valid. They want to understand the objective law or method that determines how an area of culture changes.[11] This emphasis on the objectivity and lawlikeness of cultural change thus introduces a check on the potential relativistic or historicist consequences of their relativizing the a priori. (Cassirer in particular develops a sophisticated theory of the a priori with both relative and absolute elements; see section 2.3.) This emphasis on the progressive character of culture leads the Marburg Neo-Kantians to adopt a distinctive, historical method of writing and arguing, in which systematic philosophy is not separated from the history of philosophy and the history of culture.[12]\n\n2.2 Theory of Knowledge\n\nThe core of the Marburg Neo-Kantian theory of knowledge is a conception of \u201cobjective validity\u201d (Natorp 1887; Cohen 1902: \u00a711). By the \u201cobjective validity\u201d of knowledge, they mean its objectivity (that is, its independence from individual subjects), its truth, and its relation to objects. A theory of objective validity is then also a theory of the \u201ctranscendence\u201d of the object\u2014in what sense the object is an independent standard of correctness for knowledge. A good way to approach the Marburg theory is by considering an alternative they reject. Consider the view that \u201cobjects in themselves are there, outside and independent of all subjectivity, without any original relation to it\u201d. That is, begin your theory of objective validity with the notion of an independent object, taken as a theoretical given. This notion of an object is then used to explain aboutness, truth, and objectivity. A representation is about an object, say, if it is caused by an object or, perhaps, it resembles it. A representation is true if it then mirrors or copies the object as it is independently of us. And then knowledge is objective if it is about an independent object, not about the subject and its states. For Marburg Neo-Kantians, this theory of objective validity (which they call \u201cnaive realism\u201d) simply presupposes the very thing it is supposed to explain:\n\nPerhaps this actually means something correct, but at least as it is presented, it is not really an answer to the question [What is objective validity?]. The being-in-itself of the object is itself an enigma and thus cannot serve as a solution to our present enigma. If we understood what it meant to say the object in itself is there independent of all subjectivity and then is appropriated in our subjectivity by knowledge there would be no problem in the knowing of objects or in the objectivity of knowledge. (Natorp 1887: \u00a74)\n\nThe Marburg theory of objective validity, on the other hand, turns this order of explanation on its head: instead of beginning with the notion of an object as its explanatory primitive, it sees the notion of an object as dependent on many other prior notions. In particular, it begins its account of objective validity with a distinctive account of objectivity.\n\nObjectivity, according to the Marburg view, depends on laws. For example, a particular physical thing (say a table in a room) appears in a certain way from my own subjective point of view in the room. To achieve an objective representation of the table, I would need to understand how all of the various appearances at various points of view in the room are related to one another in a law-like way. When I know the law, I\u2019ve moved from appearance to reality, from subjectivity to objectivity. If there is no such law, then there is only appearance, and I cannot speak about an independent object and its properties. This simple point generalizes at higher levels. It merely appears from our subjective point of view that the earth is stationary and the sun moves. But it is objectively the case that the earth moves around the sun because the heliocentric model follows from Newton\u2019s laws of motion. Even more fundamentally, scientific theories (such as Newton\u2019s) are developed, adopted, and abandoned as science progresses; this whole progression is itself objective because there are \u201claws\u201d (that is, a common scientific method) that prescribe these changes. These laws secure the \u201cunity\u201d of knowledge: the various appearances of the same particular are united as of the same particular object by a law; a law of nature unites various observed phenomena under it; the scientific method unites science in its development, prescribing a uniquely correct path to follow. This unity can also be described as \u201cpermanence\u201d: the appearances change, even as the object stays the same; the planets move, but the law remains; theories come and go, but the method stays constant. This notion of objectivity as lawfulness is then used to give an account of truth and objecthood. Knowledge is true if it can be unified with other knowledge within an objective system of knowledge. Last, an object is then what is known by fully objective knowledge:\n\nthe object signifies the law; it signifies the lasting unity in which the changing manifold of appearance is unified and determined in thought. (Natorp 1887: \u00a74)\n\nThis theory of objective validity has some notable consequences. First, the possibility of objective validity requires that we postulate, as a regulative ideal, a final science. The unity of knowledge through laws that the Marburgers point to as the foundation of objective validity has clearly not yet been achieved: there are still phenomena that have not yet been explained, and our current theories are certainly not going to be the final word. But it is clearly the case that even now we can know objects, even if our knowledge is partial. If unity through laws makes objectivity validity possible and that unity has not yet been achieved, how then can we know any objects at all? We have to postulate that our current, only partially unified knowledge can progress in a law-like way into a unique, final theory. Such a final theory can never actually be achieved, because the task of knowledge is infinite\u2014there is always more to understand, deeper explanations to give. The postulated final theory is like the asymptote that a curve never quite reaches. This viewpoint\u2014that speaking of an object contains the demand for unity of knowledge, that this task is infinite, that we must therefore postulate the possibility of its completion\u2014Natorp calls the \u201cgenetic view of knowledge\u201d (1910: Ch.1, \u00a74\u20135). The genetic view delivers a unique way of cashing out the \u201ctranscendence\u201d of the object. The fact that the object is independent of knowledge, in the sense that it always transcends our knowledge of it, is expressed by the infinity of the task of knowledge. And the fact that the object is the standard for knowledge is expressed by the postulate that the course of knowledge is moving asymptotically towards a unique (though infinite) endpoint as its goal. Second, the emphasis on lawfulness gives the Marburgers a satisfying explanation of the application of mathematics to the objects of natural science: the laws of natural science are mathematical, and there would be no objects if there were no laws of natural science. Third, since objectivity is explained in terms of laws, and laws are a special kind of universal judgment, the Marburg theory of objective validity emphasizes the priority of judgments over concepts (Cohen 1902: \u00a710). As Cohen memorably put it, modifying Galileo\u2019s phrase: the book of nature is written in sentences (with mathematics as its letters, and the a priori principles of pure knowledge as its syntax) (1902: 204, 484).\n\nIn addition to their theory of objective validity, another core commitment in the mature writings of the Marburg school is a rejection of the \u201cgiven\u201d. In this, they are explicitly departing from Kant. Kant had argued that our cognitive faculty has two stems: a receptive faculty (sensibility), and a spontaneous faculty (understanding). Through sensibility, objects are given to us, and through the understanding, objects are thought. The representations of sensibility are intuitions, which relate to objects immediately; the representations of the understanding are concepts, which relate to objects mediately. The Marburgers\u2019 skepticism of these distinctions culminated in Cohen\u2019s Logic of Pure Knowledge (1902: \u00a77), where these dualisms are definitively rejected. As Natorp put the point:\n\nIn the end, \u201cintuition\u201d no longer remains a cognitive factor which stands across from or is opposed to thinking. It is thinking, just not thinking in terms of laws, but thinking in terms of full objects. In its implementation, in its exercise, intuition is to conceptual thought as function is to the law of function. (1912a: 186)\n\nIntuition is itself a \u201cfunction\u201d, because even intuitions are active or spontaneous, and not merely given. Similarly, they were often uncomfortable with Kant\u2019s word \u201csynthesis\u201d because it suggests that the function of thinking is only to combine a content that is already given. Instead, Cohen prefers the term \u201cgenerate\u201d in order to indicate the \u201ccreative sovereignty of thinking\u201d (1902: 25). In another favorite slogan, an object is not given [geben] to knowledge, but given as a task [aufgegeben], echoing the genetic view of knowledge described in the previous paragraph (Natorp 1912a: 183\u20134; Natorp 1910: Ch.1, \u00a75). In Substance and Function (1910: Ch.1), Cassirer attacks the given by attacking a related doctrine: the traditional view that all concepts are formed by abstraction. On this view of concept formation, concepts would have to be abstracted from given material that is completely independent of thought and its concepts\u2014thus presupposing the doctrine of the given.\n\nIt is hard to interpret the Marburg rejection of the given. It seems to deny the obvious fact that there is some passive element in perception, and to leave no room for experiment within natural science (as Natorp recognized: 1912a: 186). In interpreting the doctrine, it is helpful to remember that the Marburg theory of knowledge concerns relations among the content of knowledge\u2014how one part of the content of knowledge justifies another. It is not concerned with causal relations between acts of the mind in perception. Plausibly, the only content that could justify a thought must itself be something thinkable, since \u201cknowledge is only grounded through other knowledge\u201d (Natorp 1887: 168). (In this sense, the denial of the given is a denial of content that is not conceptual or dependent on what is conceptual.) In Cassirer\u2019s polemic against the given, he attacks the \u201cepistemological atomism\u201d implicit in it: the view that there are some contents that can be efficacious for knowledge without requiring that a knower possess any concepts or know any facts. (In this sense, the denial of the given is a defense of semantic holism.) For this reason, he argues against the given by arguing that even the most basic experiments\u2014measurements\u2014depend on the experimenter possessing concepts and knowing certain theoretical facts (see section 2.3 below).\n\nThe Marburg philosophers characterize their philosophy as a kind of \u201cidealism\u201d. This idealism should be sharply distinguished from \u201csubjectivism\u201d, since they do not believe that objects of knowledge are representations\u2014they do not believe that the objects of knowledge depend for their existence on the existence of minds to think them (Cassirer 1910: 298). This idealism is also opposed to the view that our knowledge is really illusory; they do not hold that there are unknowable objects, or that the real nature of objects of knowledge is in principle unknowable (Cohen 1902: 507ff). Rather, their position is idealist in four senses. First, they defend an \u201cidealist\u201d conception of philosophy, as following the transcendental method. In this sense, idealism is opposed to \u201cnaturalism\u201d, the view that the method of philosophy does not differ in kind from that of the natural sciences. Second, they hold that there are substantive a priori principles that make experience possible. In this sense, their idealism is opposed to empiricism. Third, according to their theory of objective validity, our conception of an object depends on our conception of objectivity, which is grounded in the idea of the unity of knowledge according to laws. In this sense of idealism, idealism is opposed to \u201crealism\u201d, which takes the concept of an object as a philosophical primitive. Fourth, according to their philosophy of science (see below section 2.3), our empirical theories make essential use of fundamental concepts (such as mathematical concepts, or \u201ctheoretical concepts\u201d, such as the concept <force> or <energy>) that are radically unlike the features that the world appears to have to untutored, everyday experience. These \u201cideal\u201d concepts are not reducible to \u201csensible\u201d concepts such as color, texture, or shape. In this sense, idealism is opposed to \u201csensualism\u201d.\n\nThe Marburg conception of philosophy, as guided by the transcendental method, along with their rejection of the given, leads them to a unique conception of logic. For further discussion, see the Supplement, Philosophy of Logic in the Marburg School.\n\nThe Marburg rejection of the given, along with their view that objectivity is conferred by laws, has significant consequences for their philosophy of psychology. For further information, see the Supplement, Philosophy of Psychology in the Marburg School.\n\n2.3 Philosophy of Natural Science\n\nThe Marburg philosophers wrote several works that engaged in a detailed way with the natural science, especially physics, of their day. In his Forward and Introduction to the sixth edition of Lange\u2019s History of Materialism, first published in 1898, Cohen gives a philosophical interpretation of work on electromagnetism since Faraday, and defends Hertz\u2019s Principles of Mechanics (Hertz 1894). In two works both published in 1910 (Natorp 1910: Ch.7; Cassirer 1910: Ch.4) Natorp and Cassirer discuss foundational issues in physics: the principles of mechanics and thermodynamics; the nature of mass, energy, space, and time; atomism and its critics. (Cassirer also addresses foundational issues in chemistry: 1910: Ch.4, section 8). The culmination of this work is Cassirer\u2019s Einstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity, published in 1921.\n\nThere are three themes that run through Marburg work in the philosophy of natural science: they argue that contemporary natural science supports philosophical idealism; they highlight radical conceptual changes in physics; and they philosophically interpret physics in the light of their conception of objective validity. Each of these themes is discussed in the rest of the section.\n\nIdealism in Natural Science\n\nOne of Cohen\u2019s chief goals in Cohen 1898 is to show that recent work in electromagnetism undermines \u201csensualism\u201d or \u201cmaterialism\u201d, and supports \u201cidealism\u201d, by transforming our conception of physical reality away from the \u201csensible\u201d and \u201cmaterial\u201d to the \u201cideal\u201d. The physical world, according to the \u201csensible\u201d conception of reality\u2014the way the world appears to us to be through our senses\u2014is composed of matter, conceived on the model of the roughly medium sized dry goods that our senses reveal to us. Physicists working in electromagnetism\u2014Cohen points to Faraday especially\u2014demonstrated the physical reality of electromagnetic fields. Following Faraday, Cohen applauds efforts to treat electromagnetic fields and forces as independent entities in their own right, not dependent on a \u201cmaterial\u201d ether. Pure field theories thus vindicate idealism, by showing that our conception of the objects of physics should not be constrained by the picture of the world supplied by our senses; our conception of the world can only be supplied by thought, and not by the senses.\n\nGiven Cohen\u2019s opposition to ether theories, it is not surprising that he feels vindicated by Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity (Cohen 1898: 134; the passage appears in 1914\u20135 edition). In fact, Cassirer claims (1921: Ch.4) that Einstein\u2019s general theory, which departs further from the \u201csensible\u201d conception of matter by not separating matter from space and time, is a natural continuation of the idealism Cohen first articulated.\n\nRadical Conceptual Change in Natural Science\n\nAccording to the Marburg transcendental method (section 2.1), the \u201cfact\u201d of science is not static, but dynamic. In advocating this method, the Marburg Neo-Kantians are thus claiming that the principles that are a priori for science will evolve as theories change, and the concepts that function as categories will be radically reconceived as science progresses. There is then a new task, to identify the principles that are a priori in a given physical theory, and to investigate how the categories\u2014space, time, substance, magnitude\u2014are being reconceived in our current best physical theories. The Marburgers are thus committed to a view of scientific progress that emphasizes conceptual shifts in science. Scientists don\u2019t just discover new facts: they also develop new concepts, and radically revise their fundamental concepts.\n\nFurthermore, according to the Marburg conception of objectivity and objecthood, objecthood\u2014what it is to be an object\u2014is conceptually dependent on objectivity, which is explained in terms of laws. The upshot of this is that our notion of a physical object is determined by the most fundamental laws of our science. Marburg Neo-Kantianism therefore highlights the fact that scientific progress requires fundamental shifts in science\u2019s ontology\u2014its conception of what there is.\n\nThese themes are apparent already in Cohen\u2019s introduction to Lange (Cohen 1898). Following Hertz, Cohen surveys three different proposals for the principles of mechanics: Newton\u2019s view (which takes as fundamental space, time, mass, and force); an alternative that replaces the notion of force with energy; and Hertz\u2019s own radical view, which uses only the notions of space, time, and mass. Cohen argues for Hertz\u2019s view, emphasizing how it fundamentally reconceptualizes the traditional notion of \u201cmass\u201d (Cohen 1898: 128ff.). This same tendency is even more apparent in Cassirer\u2019s writings on Einstein. He argues that Einstein introduces new a priori principles: the constancy of the speed of light (in the special theory), and the principles of general covariance and the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass (in the general theory) (1921: 415, 428). And he emphasizes the transformations in the notions of substance, space, and time that the general theory requires (1921: Chs. 3\u20135).[13]\n\nObjective Validity of Natural Science\n\nFor Marburg Neo-Kantianism, objectivity and objecthood are explained in terms of the unity of knowledge. Explaining the unity of scientific knowledge over time becomes especially pressing for them given their emphasis on radical conceptual change in natural science. If even the categories are shifting over time, in what sense is there unity to our knowledge?\n\nThis problem is made more pressing in conjunction with the Marburg attack on the given. (After all, if there were something given in experience, then the given in experience would determine which conceptual changes are necessary in science, and the objectivity of our scientific knowledge could be explained.) In the philosophy of science, the attack on the given amounts to an attack on the possibility of crucial experiments\u2014experiments that would, in a theory neutral way, establish the truth of a scientific theory. Marburg philosophers emphasized that even the most primitive experimental results\u2014measurements\u2014presuppose a good amount of \u201ctheoretical\u201d machinery: not only mathematics, but even physical laws. Cassirer cited Duhem in support (1910: Ch.4). Duhemian underdetermination of scientific theory by experience showed, Cassirer believed, that there is no given: no autonomous layer of self-authenticating experiences.\n\nMarburg philosophy of science thus includes the claim that there could be rival scientific theories, each of which is empirically adequate.[14] Given this, in what sense is science objective? How is there unity in science, when there are no theory-neutral experiments that would prevent different scientists from adopting different theories? Cassirer (1910) in particular proposed an intricate answer to this question (Heis 2014). He argued that there is a common set of demands on theories that will constrain the choice of theory. These demands are a priori, in a regulative sense, and partially constitute what he calls the \u201cform\u201d of a scientific theory. These demands include that a theory be simple and of wide scope.[15] He also argues that even in the face of radical conceptual changes and shifts in ontology, some features of scientific theories are maintained\u2014for instance the approximate mathematical structure of the theory.\n\nFor further discussion of the philosophy of mathematics, see the Supplement, Philosophy of Mathematics in the Marburg School.\n\n3. The Southwest School\n\nThe beginning of the Southwest School of Neo-Kantianism can arguably be located in Wilhelm Windelband\u2019s 1883 essay, \u201cCritical or Genetic Method?\u201d, which for the first time both gives a clear exposition of the philosophical point of view that would characterize the Southwest school and argues explicitly for a return to Kant. However, many of the core ideas in that essay were already articulated by Windelband\u2019s teacher, Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881), principally in his Logic (1874). Lotze argued for a clean distinction between philosophy and psychology. Logic depends on the distinction between \u201ctruth and untruth\u201d, and gives the laws that thought ought to obey, while psychology identifies the laws that mental processes do obey. Logic gives laws governing the content of thoughts, while psychology concerns acts of thinking (Lotze 1874: \u00a7x; \u00a7332; on the act/content distinction see also Lotze 1856\u201364: vol.2, 630; Lotze 1874: \u00a7337). The contents of thoughts are objective, inasmuch as they are not only shareable but have a reality independent of being thought. Though these contents are real, they do not occur (as events do), do not exist or have being (as things do), but are valid (1874: \u00a7\u00a7314\u2013318). Though Lotze did not explicitly call for a return to Kant, he did articulate many of the themes that the SW Neo-Kantians located in Kant. Lotze argued that knowing cannot be considered a copying [Abbilden] of its object (\u00a7327); he held that knowledge requires a priori elements, and that apriority is not the same as innateness (\u00a7324); and more generally he positioned his philosophy as a middle ground between speculative idealism and materialism.\n\nAfter completing his dissertation, on the doctrine of chance, under Lotze in 1870, Windelband (1848\u20131915), moved to Strassburg in 1882, and then to Heidelberg in 1902. A master essayist, he is best known for the essays and addresses collected in his Pr\u00e4ludien (1915), which was first published in 1883. In \u201cCritical or Genetic Method?\u201d\u2014the important essay just mentioned\u2014Windelband self-consciously looks to Kant and the critical philosophy as the key to clearly distinguishing philosophy from psychology. Picking up Lotze\u2019s key notion of validity, he argues that Kant\u2019s project is best understood as a study of validity: the topic of philosophy is value, or the \u201cvalidity of axioms\u201d or norms. This study of validity should be broadened to all areas of culture. This broadening of the critical project was carried further in his essay, \u201cHistory and Natural Science\u201d (1894), which argued (against the positivist theory of history), that history provides a distinct way of knowing (which he calls, \u201cidiographic\u201d), distinct from the natural scientific (\u201cnomothetic\u201d) way of knowing. Windelband was also a prolific and original historian of philosophy, culminating in 1891 with his history of philosophy from ancient to modern times (Windelband 1891). He articulated and defended a conception of doing history of philosophy (Problemgeschichte, history of philosophical problems) that became standard for the Neo-Kantians of both schools.\n\nThese programmatic ideas in the theory of knowledge and the philosophy of history were expanded systematically by Windelband\u2019s student Heinrich Rickert (1863\u20131936). After writing his dissertation (\u201cThe Theory of Definition\u201d) under Windelband in Strassburg in 1888, Rickert moved to Freiburg in 1889. The philosophical school became known as the Southwest or Baden school, because Freiburg and Heidelberg are both in Baden in southwest Germany. In 1892, he published The Object of Knowledge (Rickert 1915), which he expanded and modified in subsequent editions over the next thirty years. His most influential book, The Limits of Concept Formation in Natural Science (1st ed: 1902) greatly expands and systematically develops the core idea in Windelband\u2019s essay \u201cHistory and Natural Science\u201d. His book Das Eine, die Einheit und die Eins (Oneness, Unity, and the Number One, 1911), was one of the few SW works in the philosophy of mathematics.\n\nAmong the students of Rickert and Windelband who aligned themselves with their philosophical point of view, the most influential and philosophically sophisticated was Emil Lask (1875\u20131915).[16] After studying under Windelband in Heidelberg and Rickert in Frieburg, Lask wrote his dissertation under Rickert in 1902 (\u201cFichte\u2019s Idealism and History\u201d). He later habilitated at Heidelberg, where Windelband was located, and eventually became a professor there. While there, he wrote two dense works, The Logic of Philosophy and the Doctrine of the Categories (1911), and The Doctrine of Judgment (1912). Tragically, he died in 1915 in the Great War.\n\n3.1 Conception of Philosophy: Philosophy as Theory of Value\n\n\u201cKant posed a new conception of philosophy\u2019s task and mode of knowledge against the psychologism of his contemporaries\u201d, Windelband writes in his programmatic essay, \u201cCritical or Genetic Method?\u201d (Windelband 1883: 271). On this Kantian view, Windelband asserts, philosophy\u2019s subject matter is the \u201cvalidity\u201d [Geltung] of \u201caxioms\u201d. Philosophy must identify these axioms, put them into a system, and explain how these axioms govern the activities of knowing, acting, and judging. This latter task requires giving a general account of validity, in addition to identifying how the various sciences and areas of culture are governed by specific axioms. Logic (or theoretical philosophy, or \u201ctheory of knowledge\u201d) is the science of the axioms for knowing; ethics is the science of the norms for acting; aesthetics is the science of the rules of the \u201ceffects of the emotions\u201d (1883: 274\u20135).\n\nThis conception of philosophy furnishes the SW School with an antidote to psychologism, which differs fundamentally from the kind of anti-psychologism proferred by the Marburg school (see section 2.1). For Windelband, axioms are understood \u201cteleologically\u201d: they are the rules that must be followed if certain ends are to be realized. For instance, logic gives those norms that must be followed if one wants to believe what is true. Axioms are norms, and their necessity is normative necessity. Essentially, philosophy is distinct from psychology because norms are distinct from facts. The norms that, as a matter of fact, people do recognize have only \u201cfactual validity\u201d, and not \u201cteleological validity\u201d.[17] What Windelband calls the \u201cgenetic method\u201d recognizes only factual validity or generality. It seeks to demonstrate the validity of axioms by showing that these axioms are built into our psychology, or are universal to all cultures. The genetic method therefore makes philosophy dependent on psychology and cultural history. But the genetic method is hopeless: one cannot prove the axioms that govern all sciences by using psychology or anthropology, since these sciences themselves presuppose these axioms. Indeed, the genetic method threatens relativism, since we cannot say what humans will believe at all times and places, but only what they believe now, or what is believed in this or that culture. Indeed, on the genetic method, truth and goodness are reduced to social power or majority opinion.\n\nThe critical method, on the other hand, begins with the assumption that there are universal, absolute values which all subjects ought to recognize and conform to. It postulates a \u201cnormal consciousness whose principles must be recognized, insofar as anything at all is to have universal validity\u201d (Windelband 1883: 280). This normal consciousness,[18] inasmuch as it embodies a norm, is not an empirically real subject and cannot be investigated using the genetic method. The \u201caxioms\u201d, which form the subject matter of philosophy, are the principles that must have normative force if there is to be a normal consciousness at all. These axioms are \u201cmeans to the end of universal validity\u201d (1883: 281)\u2014they are the norms that must be recognized if there are to be any universally valid norms at all. For example, there could be a normal consciousness in a world where ripe tomatoes are blue and not red. Thus the norm \u201cBelieve that ripe tomatoes are red\u201d, though it is true and thus universally valid in our world, is not an axiom\u2014not a norm whose recognition is a precondition of universal validity. The law of contradiction, on the other hand, is a precondition of universal validity. No matter what color ripe tomatoes are in our world, there would be no point in adopting the norm \u201cBelieve that ripe tomatoes are red\u201d as a norm of truth, unless we also recognize the demand to avoid contradictions. The proof that these axioms are the indispensable preconditions of universal validity cannot be empirical, as the genetic method would require.\n\nThe defining claim of SW Neo-Kantianism is that there are universally valid norms, and every universally valid norm has an a priori ground.[19] The concept of the a priori is therefore not a psychological or biological notion (the a priori is not the innate), nor is it an anthropological notion (the a priori is not what is universally assented to). The a priori are norms, the recognition of which is indispensable for normative activities. In theoretical philosophy, the a priori are norms the recognition of which are necessary for making universally valid judgments\u2014judgments that make a claim to truth, truth for every other cognizer. These a priori theoretical norms include the laws of logic. For natural science, the law of causality is an a priori norm; for history (see section 3.3), it is a priori that there are universal values that make certain individuals historically significant (Rickert 1902: 334). Similarly, there are universally binding norms in ethics and aesthetics, which make it possible that certain actions and emotions are universally valid.\n\nLask agrees with his teachers in characterizing philosophy as the science of validity (Lask 1911: 401). He recognizes, however, that the SW Neo-Kantian insistence on the objectivity of what is valid, along with their distinction between the factual and the normative, threatens to devolve into a \u201ctwo world\u201d metaphysics that is potentially incompatible with Kantianism. In fact, Lotze (Lask argues) opted precisely for such a two world theory, where what is valid is set over against what is, or has being. This dualism is unpalatable, since it would leave it unexplained how senses (i.e., the contents of our sentences) come to be true of what is, thus reigniting the question (famously posed by Kant in his 1772 letter to Herz) about how representations can relate to objects at all. Lask thus argued that Neo-Kantianism had to be completed by taking a Kantian \u201cCopernican Turn\u201d[20] (Lask 1911: First Part, \u00a71). Just as Kant argued that the object must conform to our cognition of it, Lask holds that both the senses of our sentences and the objects that have being share a form (\u00a72). The form of a sense is theoretical validity [G\u00fcltigkeit], and the form of an object is objectivity [Gegenst\u00e4ndlichkeit]. The Copernican view, then, is that theoretical validity just is objectivity. The two world theory thus becomes a two element theory (\u00a73). There is one realm (the realm of theoretical sense or being), within which we can distinguish a formal element and a material element. The formal element is validity, which is the subject matter of philosophy, while the material element is sensible. Validity, however, is not supersensible (such as the objects of dogmatic theology or cosmology would be), but rather \u201cnon-sensible\u201d, since it is an element in the sensible objects of our experience.\n\nLast, it should be emphasized that for Windelband and the rest of the SW Neo-Kantians, the goal of the critical philosophy is to be an \u201call-encompassing philosophy of culture\u201d (Windelband 1910). In particular, they wanted to expand Kant\u2019s critical project to those areas of culture that Kant\u2019s original draft of critical philosophy had neglected: the so-called \u201cGeisteswissenschaften\u201d, principally history.\n\n3.2 Theory of Knowledge\n\nThere are four fundamental features of the SW Neo-Kantians\u2019 theory of knowledge: a normative theory of objectivity and objecthood; the act/content/object distinction; the rejection of the copy theory of knowledge; and a theory of what is given in perceptual experience. This section addresses each of these features in turn.\n\nObjectivity and Objecthood\n\nThe central question that Rickert poses in his The Object of Knowledge, which is the most developed and thorough SW work in the theory of knowledge, is \u201cWhat is the object of knowledge, which is independent of the subject, or in virtue of what does cognizing achieve objectivity?\u201d (Rickert 1915: 1). In particular, Rickert is concerned with the \u201ctranscendence\u201d of the object: that the object is an independent standard for knowledge, that it determines whether knowledge is true or objective. Rickert\u2019s answer to these questions is that the object is a \u201ctranscendent ought\u201d [Sollen], and not fundamentally a \u201ctranscendent being\u201d [Sein] or \u201creality\u201d [Wirklichkeit]. This is a distinctive view. It is, of course, a platitude that objects are normative in the sense that our beliefs about an object ought to be true of it. But a common view is that this normativity is derivative: our beliefs about an object ought to be a certain way, because the object itself is a certain way. On this common view, the object\u2019s standing as a \u201ctranscendent ought\u201d is grounded in its \u201ctranscendent being\u201d. Rickert rejects this view. He argues that the only norms that can be derived from what is [sein], are conditional norms, to the effect that one ought to do such and such if one happens to will a certain thing\u2014norms that are neither objective, nor independent of the subject. Such a view either undermines the theory of knowledge as a normative discipline (and truth as a value), or undermines objectivity (Rickert 1915: 281). Rickert therefore advocates upending the common view. He takes norms of cognition as basic and irreducible, and argues that the transcendent reality of objects is grounded in these irreducible cognitive norms.\n\nIn Lask 1911 and Lask 1912, Lask follows his teacher in talking of the object as \u201ccontaining a value\u201d or being the standard for knowledge. Drawing on Rickert\u2019s ideas, he argues that the objectivity (of an object) is just the same thing as validity (of values), and that both objects and senses share this form. Nevertheless, Lask departs from Rickert\u2019s view in two ways. First, he argues that\n\nas we must fight every version of truth that is characterized by mirroring and shadowing, so also conversely, we must fight any assertion of a dependence in the opposite direction, a priority of theoretical validity, of the \u201cdemand\u201d, of the \u201cought\u201d before being. (Lask 1911: 410)\n\nThe transcendent being of an object is no more derivative from the normativity of our claims about that object than the latter is on the former (Lask 1908). Second, Lask argues that the object has a form and a matter, and that the form alone is what is valid. Thus the object is not itself a transcendent ought, but only its form is.[21]\n\nAct, Content, and Object of Thinking\n\nLotze had distinguished psychology from the theory of knowledge (what Lotze calls \u201clogic\u201d) by distinguishing the acts of thinking, which are events and constitute the subject matter of psychology, from the contents of thinking, which are valid and constitute the subject matter of logic (Lotze 1874: \u00a7x; \u00a7332). This distinction was taken up and ramified by Rickert and Lask. Starting in the 1915 third edition of The Object of Knowledge, Rickert argued that the content [Gehalt] of a judgment had to be split up into two parts: the unreal [unwirklich], objective content [Gehalt], and the subjective, \u201cimmanent sense\u201d [Urteilssinn] of the judgment. This immanent sense is distinct from the act of judging, which is \u201creal\u201d and the subject matter of psychology. Rickert calls the immanent sense \u201cirreal\u201d [irreal]. The immanent sense is the orienting of the subject toward the objective content (Rickert 1915: 164\u2013167; Ch.3, \u00a74). What Rickert means by this can be brought out by contrasting it with the objective content, which Rickert takes to be a whole composed of connected representations. For example, the three sentences \u201cIs snow white?\u201d, \u201cSnow is white\u201d, and \u201cSnow is not white\u201d, for Rickert all have the same objective content, since in all three the same representation (\u201cwhite\u201d) is predicated categorically of the same representation (\u201csnow\u201d). The difference is in the \u201cimmanent sense\u201d of the sentences: the first sentence questions whether the content is true, the second affirms that the content is true, and the third denies that the content is true (Rickert 1915: 175; Ch.3, \u00a76). Rickert\u2019s distinction between immanent sense and objective content fits more naturally than does the simple act/content distinction with the SW conception of philosophy as the theory of values, and thus with their conception of the theory of knowledge as concerned with the norm of truth. After all, if theory of knowledge is concerned only with abstract, objective contents, then it is not clear why it would be any more normative than natural science. A science that isolates the laws of abstract things would seem just as descriptive as a science that isolates the laws of concrete things\u2014as Husserl argued forcefully in Logical Investigations (Husserl 1900). Norms seem more suited for acts, not objective contents. But to swing in the opposite direction, and take theory of knowledge to concern acts of cognition wouldn\u2019t help either, since the laws that govern the acts are just descriptive laws that predict what a psychophysical subject will think under certain circumstances. The theory of knowledge, however, can be normative if it concerns the element intermediate between acts and objective contents: it gives the norms for immanent senses, stances taken toward objective contents.\n\nA different kind of refinement of the act/content/object distinction appears in Lask\u2019s 1912 Die Lehre vom Urteil (The Doctrine of Judgment).[22] Lask wants a theory of judgment that recognizes that the object is the standard of truth; and that truth does not depend on the act of judging\u2014just as anti-psychologism demands. Lask believes that the standard distinctions between act, content, and object do not fully recognize this. In particular, he rejects Rickert\u2019s view that, in judging, a subject takes a stance with respect to the objective content. This is because Lask believes that the objective content is created by the act of judging, and so Rickert\u2019s view has the unpalatable consequence that our acts of judging are about something that is created by our acts of judgment, thus violating the idea that our judgments answer to something prior to the act of judging. On the other hand, he cannot say that in judging, we judge the object itself, since all judgments have a structure (one thing is predicated of another), and the object, he argues, is an unstructured whole whose articulation into parts is a work of the mind. Lask therefore posits, in addition to the content of the judgment and the object itself, a third thing, which he calls the \u201cprimary object\u201d (Lask 1912: Ch.1). The primary object is a structured whole, which (as structured) is distinct from the object itself, but (as structured in a way that differs from the logical structures possessed by judgments) is distinct from the content of the judgment, as well. Judging is then a decision about whether the predication in the primary object is valid, and the content is the thought that the primary object is valid. The judgment thus aims to successfully \u201creproduce\u201d or \u201crebuild\u201d [nachbilden] in a structured form the originally unstructured object (Lask 1912: Ch.2, \u00a71), and truth, as the adequate rebuilding of the object, becomes a kind of correspondence (Ch.2, \u00a72).[23]\n\nRejection of the Copy Theory of Knowledge\n\nAnother idea, present in Lotze, though ultimately derived from Kant, is the rejection of the copy theory [Abbildtheorie] of knowledge. \u201cSince the Critique of Pure Reason\u201d, Windelband writes,\n\nthe days are over once and for all when a mature philosophical consciousness might think of the world as \u201cgiven\u201d and mirrored in it, as it would seem to the naive consciousness. In everything we regard as given our reason is already at work: and the justification of our knowledge of things rests only on our first creating them for ourselves. (1910 [NKR: 318])\n\nNo knowledge, not even perceptual knowledge, is merely receptive, or a mirror, but is a product that results from the application of a priori forms to what is given. The explicit attack on the copy theory becomes more explicit in Windelband and Rickert\u2019s writings over time: starting in the 1915 third edition of The Object of Knowledge, Rickert devotes a section (Chapter 2, section VI) explicitly to attacking the copy theory, and he devotes a late essay (Rickert 1934) to what he sees as a revival of the errors of the copy theory in Heidegger. In the latter essay, Rickert attacks \u201ctheoretical intuitionism\u201d, the idea that cognition [Erkenntnis] is no more than intuition [Anschauung], a passive reception of the object that is given to us. Such a view implies that cognition is simply a copy of the object, which resembles it. However, he argues that intuition, the passive reception of what is given, merely gives \u201ckennen\u201d (acquaintance with), and not true \u201cerkennen\u201d (cognizing). Cognition requires a \u201ccomplete transformation of the given intuition through non-intuitive factors\u201d (1934 [NKR: 391]).\n\nThe Given\n\nThough the SW and Marburg school agree in their rejection of the copy theory, they take very different attitudes toward the distinction between intuitions and concepts, and toward the \u201cgiven\u201d. For the Marburg school, there is nothing given; the SW School argues only that knowledge is not a copy of the given, but requires a transformation of it. For the Marburg school, there is no distinction between intuitions and concepts; for the SW School, intuitions are irreducible to concepts. These two points are developed by Rickert. He holds that the content of a sensory consciousness, what is given in perception, is a \u201cheterogeneous continuum\u201d and an \u201cunsurveyable manifold\u201d (1915: 406\u20137; Ch.5, \u00a75, \u201cKonstitutive Wirklichkeitsformen und Methodologische Erkenntnisformen\u201d). This multiplicity of content in perception can only be felt [Erlebnis, Gef\u00fchl], since it would be an infinite (and so impossible) task to express this content in conceptual form (1915: 139; Ch.3, section 1, \u201cDas Erkennen als Vorstellen\u201d). So cognition cannot be a reproduction, or mirror, of what is given; the concept cannot be a reproduction of the intuition. Rather, concepts are always general, and overcome the multiplicity of the content of sensory consciousness by leaving out content that is present in intuition (Rickert 1902: Ch.1, \u00a71). This idea is further developed by Lask (1911). He argues that a theoretical sense (e.g., the sense of this or that sentence) is composed of matter and form, that the form of the sense is validity, while the matter is the \u201cnon-valid sensible\u201d, or \u201calogical content\u201d. This material matter, though it can be taken up into a concept as its matter, is not itself conceptual, or reducible or transformable into what is conceptual. The sensible content (i.e., the content of a sensory consciousness) is \u201csomething irrational\u201d or \u201cforeign to meaning\u201d, and can only be passively taken in, felt, and intuited (Lask 1911: 415\u2013417; First Part, \u00a73). The sense of a sentence does not mirror or copy the sensory given: the sensory given is its matter. Lask summarizes the difference between the Marburg view and this conception as a distinction between \u201cpanlogicism\u201d (the view that all content is conceptual content\u2014the kind of content that is the subject matter of logic) and \u201cpanarchy of logos\u201d (his view that all content, even sensory content, can be the matter for conceptual form, without being reduced to it) (Lask 1911: 426; Second Part, Ch.1, \u00a73).\n\n3.3 Philosophy of Historical Sciences\n\nWindelband\u2019s most influential and widely-read work, and indeed, the most influential and widely-read of all of the SW Neo-Kantian writings, is his essay, \u201cHistory and Natural Science\u201d. This essay is a contribution to the philosophical debate sparked by the 19th century explosion in what we might call the human sciences\u2014principally history, but also comparative linguistics, anthropology, and comparative religion\u2014that seemed rigorous and so \u201cscientific\u201d, but that seemed to differ fundamentally from paradigm mathematical natural sciences such as physics.[24] Windelband\u2019s chief claim is that there is an irreducible methodological difference (or, as he puts it, a \u201clogical\u201d difference) between history and the natural sciences.\n\n[W]e have before us a purely methodological classification of the empirical sciences that is grounded upon sound logical concepts. The principle of classification is the formal property of the theoretical or cognitive objectives of the science in question. One kind of science is an inquiry into general laws. The other kind of science is an inquiry into specific historical facts. In the language of formal logic, the objective of the first kind of science is the general, apodictic judgment; the objective of the other kind of science is the singular, assertoric proposition. (Windelband 1894: 291)\n\nThose sciences, such as mathematical physics, whose goal is to produce general laws are called \u201cnomothetic\u201d; those sciences, such as history, whose goal is to know a unique, singular individual, are called \u201cidiographic\u201d. The individual that is the subject of idiographic sciences need not be an individual human being, such as Caesar. It could be a unique event or sequence of events (the fall of the Roman empire); an individual nation, language, religion, or culture (Florence during the Renaissance); or a unique artifact of literature, art, or science (Homer\u2019s Iliad). The important point is that an idiographic science has as its goal to understand an individual in all its uniqueness.[25] Nomothetic sciences want to know laws; idiographic sciences want to know unique processes. The nomothetic seeks the general, and what happens invariably; the idiographic seeks the particular, and what only happens once. Nomothetic sciences begin with what is given to intuition [Anschauung], but ascend to what is abstract and no longer intuitive; idiographic sciences proceed in the opposite direction, attempting to resurrect and reproduce a unique individual in all its vitality, detail, and intuitiveness [Anschaulichkeit].\n\nWindelband\u2019s chief target is the positivist philosophy of history, defended by Comte, Mill, and others. On this view, the method of history ought to be fundamentally the same as that of the natural sciences, and its goal ought to be the discovery of general laws that explain and predict historical events.[26] A secondary target of this essay is the view that history and the natural sciences can be distinguished principally in terms of their subject matter. This view is expressed by the terms \u201cNaturwissenschaften\u201d (sciences of nature) and \u201cGeisteswissenschaften\u201d (sciences of \u201cmind\u201d or \u201cspirit\u201d), which Dilthey introduced in his 1883 book Introduction to the Geisteswissenschaften. Windelband objects that when the distinction among the sciences is drawn in this way, psychology ends up as a Geisteswissenschaft like history; indeed psychology, as the empirical science of the mind, ought to be the fundamental Geisteswissenschaft on which all other Geisteswissenschaften depend. But, Windelband argues, psychology is methodologically just as much a \u201cnomothetic\u201d science as physics is: both try to discover mathematical laws of their phenomena through controlled experimentation.[27] And the amount of psychology that a historian needs does not go beyond what is supplied by reflective common sense; the new discoveries of empirical psychologists have been, and are likely to be, of no special significance for historians.[28]\n\nThe conception of history first sketched in Windelband\u2019s \u201cHistory and Natural Science\u201d was thoroughly elaborated and expanded in Rickert\u2019s The Limits of Concept Formation in Natural Science. Rickert improves on Windelband\u2019s view in two principal ways: he systematically develops Windelband\u2019s idea that the distinction between history and natural science must be grounded in logic, and he connects the distinction in kinds of sciences to the characteristic SW distinction between fact and value.\n\nAs Rickert\u2019s title emphasizes, he conceived of history as a logical notion, as a certain way of forming concepts. The traditional logic, he claims, considers only concepts formed by abstracting away from individual particularities to form general representations. But this method has its limit: it cannot explain how we form concepts of individuals. History is a logical procedure for forming concepts of individuals, as, for instance, a historical work on Caesar would produce a concept of Caesar. In calling the products of historical research \u201cconcepts\u201d, Rickert is combating the view that a historian merely collects facts and reports them. Rather, the historian sifts through the potentially infinite number of facts about her subject and isolates, using some principle of selection, the facts about her subject that are essential for history.[29] Though Rickert employs the traditional logical notion of an individual to characterize the subject of historical concepts, he uses the term in a distinctive way. Individuals are unique and they are indivisible or irreplaceable. An adequate historical concept of Julius Caesar needs to include those features that make him unique, and unlike any other individual. Rickert uses the example of the Koh-i-noor diamond to illustrate the indivisibility or irreplaceability of an historical individual. Of course there are distinctive facts about this diamond that distinguish it from all other hunks of carbon; but the same could be said of any lump of coal. However, from the point of view of history, it is indifferent whether one lump of coal that was used to power a locomotive carrying Queen Victoria would have been destroyed and replaced by some other lump of coal. But, from the point of view of history, the massive diamond that the Queen herself was wearing is hardly replaceable. Furthermore, Rickert insisted that historical concepts, although they are of an individual, are nonetheless general in the sense that the principles of selection employed in forming these concepts are universally valid for all historians.[30]\n\nWhen Rickert insists that concepts of historical individuals are formed through employing principles of selection that are universally valid, he is bringing into the philosophy of history the characteristic SW distinction between fact and value. The principles of selection are given by values. The Koh-i-noor diamond is a historical individual because it is widely held to be uniquely beautiful, and it forms a central part of the crown jewels of the British monarch; it is thus related, say, to the values of beauty, social order, and national identity.[31] Rickert therefore concludes that \u201cthe claim that historical concepts have an unconditionally general validity presupposes the acknowledgment of unconditionally general values\u201d (Rickert 1902: 360). The SW view of history thus attempts to thread the needle between positivism and more radical forms of historicism: it makes history an autonomous science, without falling into relativism. (Clearly, in arguing that the concepts of history are objectively valid, despite the fact that history does not include universal laws, the SW Neo-Kantians are rejecting the Marburg view that objective validity depends on laws. This is a paradigm case where their differing conceptions of objective validity, as normative or nomological, are brought to bear.) Indeed, Rickert claims that there are certain a priori conditions of history, just as Kant had claimed in the first Critique that there are certain a priori conditions for natural science. It is a priori that every historical individual is value-relevant. It is also a priori that there are certain values, such as beauty or social order, that are universally valid. Inasmuch as a culture is a collection of values, or value-relevant individuals, the most apt way of characterizing the subject matter of a science like history is as a science of culture, as opposed to a science of mind (Geisteswissenschaft).[32]"}], "Wilhelm Windelband was a student of Franz Brentano.": [{"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wilhelm-windelband/", "page_content": "First published Mon May 18, 2020\n\nWindelband was a marvelous essayist. He developed his ideas not in the format of a larger systematic work, but in a series of addresses and individual papers, a selection of which was published in his famous Pr\u00e4ludien [Preludes] in 1883. The genre of Windelband\u2019s writings does not lend itself to the development of a philosophical system, and he often changes the emphasis, framing, and terminology of his claims and arguments from one essay to the next. Nevertheless, he was a rigorous thinker. This entry provides a rational reconstruction of the systematic insights that Windelband developed in his various addresses and essays, and groups them around the central themes that reoccur throughout his oeuvre. With respect to many of these themes\u2014the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant, the fact-value distinction, the question of historical method, and the conception of the history of philosophy\u2014Windelband was a highly influential contributor to the philosophical landscape of his time. Although he did not develop a detailed and encompassing philosophical system like his student Rickert, or the neo-Kantians of the Marburg school, most notably Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945), his ideas shaped subsequent debates on these issues more profoundly than is often acknowledged.\n\nHe also made a name for himself in the history of philosophy by pioneering the method of structuring the historical presentation in terms of fundamental philosophical problems, rather than as a chronology of individual thinkers.\n\nWindelband is well-known for having introduced a distinction between the \u201cnomothetic method\u201d of the natural sciences and the \u201cidiographic method\u201d of the historical disciplines. His argument that history is a science [Wissenschaft] that captures the unique, unrepeatable and individual character of reality has been highly relevant for subsequent debates on historical method.\n\nWindelband\u2019s main philosophical contribution consists in reformulating Kant\u2019s transcendental approach in terms of a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d that focuses philosophical analysis on questions of normativity. Although Windelband thinks of his project as an anti-metaphysical \u201cscientific philosophy\u201d, he is keen to secure for philosophy a role that is independent of the special sciences. He finds the grounds for philosophy\u2019s independence in its formal-teleological method, and in its concern with a quaestio juris, rather than a quaestio facti. That is, philosophy deals with questions of justification, it does not determine matters of fact.\n\nWilhelm Windelband (1848\u20131915) was a German neo-Kantian philosopher. He is considered the founding father of the Baden (or Southwest) school of Neo-Kantianism. The Baden school included his student and successor at Heidelberg, Heinrich Rickert (1863\u20131936), and Rickert\u2019s student Emil Lask (1875\u20131915) as its core members. Alongside his contemporary Hermann Cohen (1842\u20131918)\u2014the founder of the Marburg school of Neo-Kantianism\u2014Windelband is a central proponent of the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant that became dominant in German academic philosophy from the 1880s onwards, and that constituted the backbone of \u201corthodox\u201d neo-Kantianism in the late nineteenth century.\n\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nWilhelm Windelband was born in 1848 in Potsdam, Germany. His father, Johann Friedrich Windelband was a state secretary for the Province of Brandenburg. Windelband studied in Jena, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen, attending lectures by Kuno Fischer (1824\u20131907) in Jena and studying with Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881) in G\u00f6ttingen. Fischer and Lotze would deeply influence Windelband\u2019s philosophical thinking, as well as his work as a historian of philosophy.\n\nIn 1870, Windelband completed his dissertation on Die Lehren vom Zufall [Doctrines of chance] under Lotze\u2019s supervision. The following year he served as a soldier in the German-French war. After his military service, he completed his habilitation in Leipzig and took up a position as \u201cPrivatdozent\u201d there. His habilitation was published in 1873 under the title Ueber die Gewissheit der Erkenntniss: eine psychologisch-erkenntnisstheoretische Studie [On the certainty of knowledge: a psychological-epistemological study]. In 1874, Windelband married Martha Wichgraf with whom he would have four children.\n\nTwo years later, Windelband became professor (ordinarius) of \u201cinductive philosophy\u201d in Z\u00fcrich. He lectured on psychology before taking up a position as professor of philosophy in Freiburg im Breisgau in 1877. In 1882 he accepted an offer from the University of Strasbourg. While his inaugural lectures in Z\u00fcrich and Freiburg had centered on the relation between psychology and philosophy, his works from the Strasbourg period develop his core themes in the philosophy of values and the philosophy of history. Windelband served as \u201cRektor\u201d of the University of Strasbourg in 1894/95 and 1897/98. He remained in Strasbourg until 1903, when he accepted a call from the University of Heidelberg. Between 1905 and 1908 he served as representative of the University of Heidelberg in the Baden \u201cLandtag\u201d. He was a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and of the Academies of Sciences of G\u00f6ttingen, Bayern and Heidelberg. He remained in Heidelberg and taught there until his death in 1915.\n\n2. From Kant to the Philosophy of Values\n\nWindelband\u2019s views on normativity are strongly influenced by his teacher Lotze. In his Logic (1874), Lotze distinguishes between psychological laws which determine how thinking proceeds as a matter of fact, and logical laws, which are normative laws and prescribe how thinking ought to proceed (Lotze 1874: \u00a7x; \u00a7332, \u00a7337). This distinction also corresponds to a distinction between act and content. Lotze observes that \u201cideas\u201d do occur in us as acts or events of the mind. But their content does not consist in such acts, is not reducible to mental activity, and does not exist in the way empirical processes and entities may be said to exist. It is not real, but \u201cvalid\u201d (Lotze 1874: \u00a7\u00a7314\u2013318).\n\nThe distinction between the factual and the normative would become the cornerstone of Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d. In his early writings, however, Windelband does not yet embrace this distinction. In his habilitation thesis \u00dcber die Gewi\u00dfheit der Erkenntnis (1873), he argues that logic is a normative discipline, but that it needs to be put on a psychological basis. This is because the justification of our knowledge claims is always dependent on and relative to specific epistemic purposes which, in turn, are given psychologically. Although he criticizes the identification of the conditions of knowledge with psychophysical processes, he does think of psychology and logic or epistemology as continuous with one another. His 1875 \u201cDie Erkenntnislehre unter dem v\u00f6lkerpsychologischen Gesichtspunkte\u201d [\u201cThe theory of knowledge from the perspective of folk-psychology\u201d] which was published in Moritz Lazarus\u2019 and Heyman Steinthal\u2019s Zeitschrift f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft [Journal of folk psychology and linguistics], is more radical. It denies that logical norms are independent of the conscious mind and claims that the origins of logical norms are to be found in the social history of humankind: the principle of contradiction emerges in situations of social conflict together with the distinction between true and false beliefs; and the law of sufficient reason comes into being when conflicts between rival views are no longer settled by brute force. On this picture, logical principles exist only when humans cognize them. There is no boundary between psychological acts and objective logical laws, or between actual historical acceptance and normative validity.\n\nThis is precisely the type of thinking that Windelband will later reject as \u201cpsychologistic\u201d, \u201chistoricist\u201d, and \u201crelativist\u201d (1883: 116\u2013117, 132). It is not clear what led Windelband to this change of view, but a deeper engagement with the Critique of Pure Reason and with the Kant scholarship of his time, in particular with works by Kuno Fischer (1860), Herman Cohen (1871), and Friedrich Paulsen (1875), seem to have factored in. The clear contours of Windelband\u2019s anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant emerge for the first time in his 1877 paper \u201c\u00dcber die verschiedenen Phasen der Kantischen Lehre vom Ding-an-sich\u201d [\u201cOn the different stages of the Kantian doctrine of the thing-in-itself\u201d]. In this essay, Windelband argues against the idea, held by prominent figures of the \u201cback-to-Kant\u201d movement like Friedrich Albert Lange (1828\u20131875) and Hermann von Helmholtz (1821\u20131894), that knowledge emerges from an interaction between subject and object. According to their view, the object affects the subject\u2019s mind, while the subject provides the a priori cognitive structures that organize representations. These a priori structures are innate as they consist in the psychophysical constitution of the human sensory apparatus and mind. Cohen\u2019s critique of this (mis)interpretation focuses on the concept of the a priori and the question of objectivity (Cohen 1871). Windelband, in contrast, takes the problem of the thing-in-itself and the concept of truth as his starting points. His critique of the subject-object-interaction model leads him to an immanent conception of truth, according to which truth consists in the normative rules according to which our judgments ought to be formed. The immanent concept of truth thus shifts the focus of philosophical analysis on the universal and necessary \u201crules\u201d that ground our judgments.\n\nThe 1877 essay gives a genetic account of the development of Kant\u2019s views about the thing-in-itself from the Inaugural Dissertation (1770) to the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason (1787). This genetic reconstruction is supposed to reveal the underlying philosophical problems and motivations that drove Kant\u2019s thinking, as well as the inner tensions that, according to Windelband, permeate critical philosophy. In particular, Windelband identifies a \u201cgulf\u201d (1877: 225) between Kant\u2019s critique of knowledge and the metaphysics of morals, as well as a tension between the psychological account of the faculties, and Kant\u2019s mature anti-psychologism. He distinguishes between four phases in Kant\u2019s thinking about the thing-in-itself, and argues that residues of the latter three stages are present in both editions of the Critique (1781; 1787) and in the Prolegomena (1783).\n\nThe first phase, Windelband argues, is that of the Inaugural Dissertation (1770). Kant adopts Leibniz\u2019s distinction between noumena and phenomena while formulating a genuinely novel thought: he introduces the psychological distinction between receptive sensibility and the spontaneous intellect. This distinction allows him to maintain the claim that, unlike intuitions, concepts relate to things-in-themselves (1877: 240\u2013241).\n\nIn the second phase, Kant concerns himself more deeply with the question how the concepts of the understanding can relate to objects. He is driven to the insight that\n\n[w]e can only have a priori knowledge of that which we produce by the lawlike forms of our rational activities [Vernunfthandlungen]. (1877: 246)\n\nHere, Windelband follows Fischer\u2019s claim that the categories of the understanding are a priori valid for experience because they produce or \u201cmake\u201d it (Fischer 1860). Because the understanding cannot \u201cmake\u201d the thing-in-itself, the thing-in-itself cannot be known.\n\nAccording to Windelband, Kant then proceeds to inquire why we are even assuming the existence of things-in-themselves if we cannot know them. Here he enters his third, most radical phase. Kant now thinks of the thing-in-itself as a fiction, an illegitimate hypostasis in which\n\nthe universal form of the synthetic act of the understanding is seen as something that exists independently of experience. (1877: 254)\n\nWindelband argues that it is only by dismissing the existence of the thing-in-itself and by jettisoning the phenomena-noumena distinction that Kant can undertake his anti-psychologistic turn. With the rejection of the thing-in-itself, the characterization of sensibility as \u201creceptive\u201d also needs to be abandoned. And that makes a psychological construal of the faculties nonsensical. Kant is then also able to abandon the concept of truth as correspondence between representations and objects in favor of a strictly immanent conception. The immanent conception defines truth in terms of the universal and necessary rules that the relations between our representations need to accord to (1877: 259\u2013260).\n\nAnd yet, Kant could not rest with this radical view given his commitments in moral philosophy. Practical reason, and in particular the idea that the moral law does not depend on the qualities of humans as sensuous beings, but only on reason, demands a return to the assumption that the thing-in-itself exists (1877: 262). In the fourth phase, Kant thus reintroduces the thing-in-itself, while maintaining his anti-psychologism.\n\nThis genetic reconstruction allows Windelband to think of the conflict between the different views of the thing-in-itself that had emerged within the neo-Kantian tradition as reflective of inherent tensions in the Critique. He argues that Kant was especially unclear with respect to psychologism: the distinction between judgment (as a cognitive process) and justification (as logical and normative) is inadequately articulated in the first Critique. Hence Kant is at least partly responsible for the fact that in the first wave of neo-Kantianism represented by Lange and Helmholtz \u201cthe new concept of aprioricity was soon dragged down to the old idea of psychological priority\u201d (1883: 101).\n\nBut Windelband\u2019s approach to Kant is not merely historical. His sympathies clearly lie with the Kant of the third phase. For Windelband, the insight that natural psychological processes are \u201cutterly irrelevant\u201d for the truth value of our representations (1882b: 24), and the idea that the ultimate problem of philosophy is that of normativity and justification\u2014not a quaestio facti, but a quaestio juris (1882b: 26)\u2014need to be defended from Kant\u2019s own unclarities on these matters. Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d can thus be understood as an attempt to purify, explicate and develop the radical insights of the anti-psychologistic move in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d.\n\nThe cornerstone of this endeavor is the immanent conception of truth. Windelband repeatedly returns to discussing the correspondence theory of knowledge with its metaphor of a \u201cmirror relation\u201d between mind and object. He criticizes the misconception that our sensual perceptions are the things-in-themselves and that these things could be compared with our representations. Any comparison must occur between representations, since things and representations are \u201cincommensurable\u201d (1881: 130). According to Windelband, Kant\u2019s central innovation consists in the insight that the truth of our judgments, and the relation of our representations to an object are not to be found in correspondence at all. Rather, it consists in the \u201crules\u201d for combining representations (1881: 134). This leads Windelband to define truth as the \u201cnormality of thinking\u201d (1881: 138)\u2014with \u201cnormality\u201d meaning that thinking proceeds in accordance with rules or norms. Windelband also conceptualizes the object of knowledge in terms of the rules of judgment. The object of knowledge is nothing other than\n\na rule according to which representational elements ought to organize themselves, in order for them to be recognized as universally valid in this organization. (1881: 135).\n\nWindelband uses the terms \u201caxioms\u201d and \u201cvalues\u201d interchangeably to refer to the most fundamental rules, and he uses the term \u201cnorms\u201d often, but not fully consistently to refer to values or axioms as they relate to psychological experience and the cultural-historical world. Focusing his interpretation on \u201cvalues\u201d and \u201cnorms\u201d, Windelband captures the structural similarity of Kant\u2019s three Critiques in terms of immanent truth: if truth is nothing other than accordance with a rule, then there is moral and aesthetic truth in just the same way as there is epistemic truth (1881: 140). In a later text, Windelband describes the unified project of the three Critiques in terms of the necessary and universal relation between thought and object. He writes that the postulates of practical reason relate to intelligible objects (ideas) just \u201cas necessarily\u201d as the intuitions and categories relate to the object of experience, and that teleological judgment constructs the purposive whole of nature just \u201cas universally\u201d as the principles of pure understanding apply the categories to experience (1904a: 151). While this formulation glosses over some of the nuances of the distinction between constitutive and regulative uses of reason, Windelband\u2019s main intention is not that of giving a detailed and fully accurate reconstruction of Kant\u2019s philosophy. In line with his famous dictum that \u201cunderstanding Kant means to go beyond him\u201d (1915: iv), he instead seeks to revive the critical project in a manner that allows it to answer the needs of his own time. And Windelband thinks that the critical philosophy required at the time of his writing is a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d which reveals the most fundamental values in epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics.\n\n3. The Factual, the Normative, and the Method of Philosophy\n\nAs indicated above, Windelband bases his \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d on Lotze\u2019s distinction between the factual and the normative. Throughout his career, he seeks to explicate and clarify this distinction and to illuminate its consequences for philosophical method.\n\nIn \u201cWas ist Philosophie?\u201d [\u201cWhat is philosophy?\u201d] (1882), Windelband approaches the factual-normative distinction by identifying two basic and irreducible types of cognitive operations: judgments and evaluations. While judgments relate representations in a synthesis, and thus expand our knowledge about an object, evaluations presuppose an object as given. They do not expand our knowledge. Rather, they express a relation between the \u201cevaluating consciousness\u201d and the represented object in a \u201cfeeling\u201d of approval or disapproval (1882b: 29\u201330).\n\nDespite characterizing evaluations in terms of the feelings and subjective attitudes of the evaluating consciousness, Windelband argues that some evaluations are \u201cabsolutely valid\u201d. Even if they are not embraced by everyone as a matter fact, they entail a normative demand: they ought to be accepted universally according to an absolute value (1882b: 37). The basic idea seems to be that the normative force of any particular evaluation that is carried out by an empirical consciousness is derived from its relation to a non-empirical, absolute value. Windelband argues that even if there is disagreement about which evaluations ought to be embraced as universal and necessary, the demand for absolute validity itself can be recognized by everyone: we all believe in the distinction between that which is absolutely valid and that which is not (1882b: 43).\n\nAccordingly, there must be a system of absolute values from which the validity of judgments in epistemology, aesthetics, and ethic derives. Critical philosophy, then, is nothing other than the \u201cscience of necessary and universal values\u201d (1882b: 26) that explicates this system and thus reveals the grounds of normative appraisal and valid judgment. Note that for Windelband, normativity and validity are closely linked, if not identical. Absolute values endow our judgments with a normative demand. Our judgments are valid if and only if they raise a normative demand, that is if they ought to be accepted universally and necessarily.\n\nHaving distinguished the factual and the normative by reference to different cognitive operations, Windelband also seeks to identify the points of contact between the two realms. Ultimately, he wants to explain how empirical beings can recognize absolute values. His idea that there is a system of absolute values is thus accompanied by the conception of a \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. In normal consciousness the absolute system of values is, at least partially, represented in the form of norms that are known by \u201cempirical consciousness\u201d and that have an effect on it.\n\nStarting from the immanent conception of truth as accordance with a rule, Windelband distinguishes from among the infinite possible combinations of representations that might or might not be formed by empirical consciousness a subset of combinations: the subset that accords with universal and necessary rules, and which hence ought to be formed (1881: 135\u2013139: 1882a: 72\u201373). This subset is what he calls \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d (1881: 139). Thought is related to and valid for an object if of the infinite possible combinations of our representations, our thinking forms exactly those judgments that \u201cought to be thought\u201d (1881: 135). One might say that empirical consciousness contains (parts) of the system of absolute values as its \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. To the extent that philosophy seeks not only to reveal the absolute system of values, but also to inquire into how they can be norms for empirical\u2014embodied, psychological and historically situated\u2014human beings, critical philosophy is not only a \u201cscience of values\u201d, but also a \u201cscience of normal consciousness\u201d (1882b: 46).\n\nAlthough Windelband refers to the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d as a science, he emphasizes that philosophy does not rely on the methods of the empirical sciences. Philosophy is a second-order science that reflects on the methods and results of the various empirical disciplines in order to reveal the values \u201cby virtue of which we can evaluate the form and extent of their validity\u201d (1907: 9). Crucially, this reflective endeavor cannot be carried out by means of empirical investigation. Here, the distinction between the factual and the normative assumes a methodological dimension.\n\nIn \u201cKritische oder genetische Methode?\u201d [\u201cCritical or genetic method?\u201d] (1883) Windelband lays out in great detail the differences between the \u201cexplanatory\u201d and \u201cgenetic\u201d method of the empirical sciences, on the one hand, and the \u201cteleological\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d method of philosophy, on the other. And he warns of the devastating consequences that result if the two are conflated. He singles out two disciplines that might be thought to be relevant to philosophical questions about values: individual psychology and cultural history. He does not call into question the legitimacy of these disciplines or of the \u201cgenetic method\u201d in general. He even thinks that the genetic method can be applied to values. That is, individual psychology and cultural history can yield valid genetic theories that explain the actual acceptance and development of values in an individual\u2019s mental life and in cultural history. But actual acceptance is not the same as normative validity, and validity proper cannot be found by generalizing from the empirical. A firm boundary separates the genetic method and its approach toward actually accepted values from the critical method of philosophy which concerns values as normative.\n\nWindelband\u2019s argument against the application of the genetic method to philosophical questions has three components. First, he argues that the genetic method cannot solve philosophical questions about normativity and validity, because there is too much variety regarding the values that have been and are actually accepted. The empirical method will not uncover values that are universally embraced by all cultures (1883: 114\u2013115).\n\nSecond, the genetic method can show and explain why some values have been accepted by this or that individual, or in this or that culture. But insofar as it is an empirical method, it cannot establish that the values in question are universal and necessary.\n\nThe universally valid can be found neither by inductive comparison of all individuals and peoples nor by deductive inference from \u2026 the \u2018essence\u2019 of man. (1883: 115)\n\nWindelband points to the absurdity of trying to justify by empirical means that which is the presupposition of any empirical theory: the axioms upon which the validity of any theory is based (1883: 113).\n\nThird, Windelband argues that the genetic method leads to relativism. The argument rests on the two claims just outlined, and can be reconstructed as follows. There is variation between individuals and cultures regarding which beliefs are actually prevalent, and the naturally necessary [naturnotwendig] laws of psychology lead to the formation of both true and false beliefs. As an empirical method with no access to the universal and necessary, the genetic method of cultural history and individual psychology has no criterion for distinguishing between valid and invalid beliefs. This means that it has to treat all beliefs as \u201cequally justified [alle gleich berechtigt]\u201d (1882b: 36).\n\nFor [the genetic explanation], there is thus no absolute measure; it must treat all beliefs as equally justified because they are all equally necessary by nature\u2026 [R]elativism is the necessary consequence of the purely empiricist treatment of philosophy\u2019s cardinal question. (1883: 115\u2013116)\n\nNote that Windelband does not differentiate between the idea that all beliefs have only relative validity and the claim that they are all equally justified or equally valid. In his view, the genetic method does not merely render belief relative to individuals and cultures; it also forces us to conclude that all beliefs are equally valid. An empirical psychology or cultural history that oversteps its boundaries and tries to address philosophical questions about normativity and validity leads to \u201chistoricism\u201d, \u201cpsychologism\u201d, and \u201crelativism\u201d and destroys the basis of normative appraisal altogether.\n\nHaving rejected the genetic method in philosophy, Windelband explains that philosophical method is purely \u201cformal\u201d. The axioms, or values, on which the validity of our judgments is based upon cannot be proven. But it can be shown that the purposes of recognizing truth, beauty, and can only be achieved if absolute values are presupposed. Hence the critical method of philosophy has a teleological structure:\n\n[F]or the critical method these axioms, regardless of the extent to which they are actually accepted, are norms which ought to be valid if thinking wants to fulfil the purpose of being true, volition the purpose of being good, and feeling the purpose of capturing beauty, in a manner that warrants universal validation. (1883: 109)\n\nAnd yet, while Windelband insists on the distinction between the empirical-genetic method of science and the critical-teleological method of philosophy, he takes his theory of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d to imply that empirical facts do play a role in philosophy. In particular, he wants to maintain that empirical facts about individual psychology and culture can provide the starting points for philosophical reflection. He therefore describes the philosophical method as a method of reflection [Selbstbesinnung], in which the empirical mind becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. Philosophy examines existing claims to validity in light of teleological considerations, and in this way reveals the \u201cprocessual forms of psychic life that are necessary conditions for the realization of universal appraisal\u201d (1883: 125). Put differently, teleological considerations allow the empirical consciousness to distinguish within itself between empirical and contingent contents, on the one hand, and the \u201ccontents and forms\u201d that \u201chave the value of normal consciousness\u201d, on the other (1882b: 45\u201346; 1881: 139).\n\n4. The Problem of Freedom\n\nThe distinction between the normative and the factual and the question how the two realms are related also structure Windelband\u2019s reflections on human freedom. Throughout his intellectual career, Windelband returns to this problem, presenting different strategies for reconciling causal determinism and human freedom. His dissertation, completed under Lotze in 1870, deals with the concepts of chance, causal necessity, and freedom. At that time, Windelband still embraces the Kantian concept of transcendental freedom, according to which the noumenal self is the uncaused cause of all intentional action (1870: 16\u201319). But after the 1877 essay, which had uncovered the anti-metaphysical rejection of the thing-in-itself in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d as the radical starting point for the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d, Kant\u2019s metaphysical solution to the problem of freedom ceased to convince him.\n\nWindelband\u2019s most fully developed effort to arrive at an alternative solution to the problem of freedom can be found in his 1882 essay \u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d [\u201cNorms and natural laws\u201d] and in his 1904 lectures \u00dcber Willenfreiheit [On freedom of the will]. In these texts, Windelband articulates the following core claims. First, the Kantian dualism between phenomena and noumena needs to be overcome, and we need to think of moral responsibility in a way that does not presuppose a noumenal realm. Second, causal explanation and normative evaluation are two irreducible, but ultimately compatible, ways of viewing, or constructing, the world of appearances. Third, the object of moral evaluation is neither a particular moral action, nor a transcendentally free will, but a \u201cpersonality\u201d\u2014understood as a set of relatively stable motivations and psychological dispositions\u2014that is the natural cause of our actions. Although articulating these same core thoughts, the two texts differ in how they motivate these ideas, and in the consequences that they draw from them.\n\n\u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d begins by postulating a conflict between natural law and moral law: if the moral law demands an action that would also result from natural causes alone, it is superfluous. But if it demands an action that does not accord with natural causes, it is useless, because natural necessity cannot be violated (1882a: 59).\n\nWindelband holds that causal determinism extends to mental life and that for this reason the conception of freedom as a fundamental capacity that violates \u201cthe naturally necessary functions of psychic life\u201d (1882a: 60) is implausible from the get-go. However, he grants that there are two different and irreducible ways of viewing the same objects: on the one hand, there is psychological science which explains what the facts of mental life are. On the other hand, there are ideal norms, which do not explain what the facts are, but express how they ought to be (1882a: 66\u201367). The solution to the antagonism between natural law and moral law is to be found in the relation between these two points of view.\n\nHere, Windelband introduces the claim that although ideal norms differ from causal laws, they are not incommensurable with them and, in fact, act on us causally. His argument builds on his conception of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d as the representation of the system of absolute values within empirical consciousness. Windelband argues that a mind that becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d is capable of acting on the basis of and in agreement with the norms that it has discovered within itself:\n\n[E]ach norm carries with it a sense that the real process of thinking or willing ought to form itself in accordance with it. With immediate evidence a form of psychological coercion attaches itself to the awareness of the norm. (1882a: 85)\n\nThe norm becomes a determining factor in and for empirical consciousness. It acts as \u201cpart of the causal law\u201d and determines psychological life with natural necessity (1882a: 87; see also 1883: 122).\n\nThe result is what Windelband calls a \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d (1882a: 88), according to which freedom consists in nothing other than the becoming-aware of the norms that command how we ought to act: our becoming-aware of them determines our actions with natural necessity. Freedom is the \u201cdetermination of empirical consciousness by normal consciousness\u201d (1882a: 88).\n\nBut Windelband still needs to explain how it is possible that we can be aware of a moral norm and not act on it. Long passages in the 1904 lectures are devoted to developing the thought that what determines our moral decisions and actions, and hence decisions if and when we act in accordance with the moral law is our \u201cpersonality\u201d. Windelband approaches this as a theoretical, not as a normative, question and concludes that we may well call those decisions and actions \u201cfree\u201d that are predominantly determined by our constant personality, as opposed to being determined by external circumstances or contingent affects. Freedom is \u201cthe unhindered causality of a pre-existing willing\u201d (1904b: 106).\n\nHowever, Windelband concedes that this analysis does not exhaust our concept of freedom since there is not merely a theoretical, but also a normative use of the concept. In this context, Windelband acknowledges the attraction of the Kantian argument that moral responsibility is possible only if we have transcendental free will and with it the capacity for genuine alternatives: we could act differently given the same circumstances. But Windelband rejects the project of grounding human freedom in a noumenal world. He thinks that Kant\u2019s distinction between an intelligible noumenal self that is the uncaused cause of our actions, and a deterministic empirical world as constructed by our understanding reproduces the same problems that earlier metaphysical accounts of freedom had encountered. He discusses two problems in particular.\n\nFirst, on the one hand, the personality that a particular individual has developed is part of the empirical world and therefore, on the metaphysical picture, does not feature into the free decisions of the individual. But, on the other hand, the noumenal self is empty. It is an abstract, general self, uniform in all of us; and thus it cannot account for the differences in the moral life of individuals (1904b: 161\u2013163).\n\nSecond, transcendental freedom is fundamentally incompatible with the \u201call- encompassing reality and causality of the deity\u201d (1904b: 187). God is the ultimate uncaused cause, and the only way to understand this thought is by assuming a \u201ctimeless causality\u201d between God and the intelligible characters (noumenal selves)\u2014a view which ends up undermining the freedom of the latter (1904b: 186\u20139)\n\nHaving concluded that Kantian dualism fails to avoid the pitfalls of earlier metaphysical approaches to freedom, Windelband abandons the concept of transcendental freedom altogether. But while in 1882 his alternative had been the \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d, in 1904 Windelband proceeds to articulate the view that the concept of free will is a mere placeholder in our normative discourse. We are not free in the metaphysical sense, but we are perfectly entitled to pass moral judgment. And we use the language of freedom to express the fact that when passing moral judgment we disregard questions of causal determination.\n\nTo spell out this idea, Windelband takes up the 1882 distinction between the \u201cpoints of view\u201d of explanatory science and ideal norms. He now argues that there are two ways of constructing the world of appearances: we construct the world of appearances according to causal laws, and we construct it according to our normative evaluations. Evaluation\n\nreflects within the manifoldness of the given on those moments only which can be put in relation to the norm\u2026 [O]ne could call the manner in which the objects of experience, the given manifoldness of the factual, appear uniformly in light of such an evaluation another form of \u201cappearance\u201d\u2026. (1904b: 195\u20136)\n\nFreedom then means not that the will is an uncaused cause. When speaking of freedom, we appeal to the uncaused merely in the sense that we evaluate matters independently of causal deterministic processes (1904b: 197\u2013198).\n\nWindelband believes that his view preserves moral responsibility. As described above, his theoretical investigation had yielded the result that that which determines the extent to which we act in agreement with a moral norm is our personality or character. Personality is the constant cause of voluntary action, it determines our actions necessarily according to general psychological laws. From a practical standpoint, personality then is also the ultimate object of moral appraisal. We hold personality responsible, and we are justified in doing so, even if the formation of personality is itself a causal process over which the individual has no control. Ultimately, the upshot of Windelband\u2019s discussion is that moral responsibility does not presuppose a noumenal world and transcendental freedom, because it does not presuppose that we could act otherwise. It merely presupposes that another person in the same circumstances could act otherwise. The idea that one could have acted differently refers\n\nnot to the concrete human being in these concrete circumstances, but to the generic concept of the human being. (1904b: 212)\n\n5. The Natural and the Historical Sciences\n\nIn Windelband\u2019s view, a reconsideration of the Kantian project is not only necessary because of its inherent tensions; broader developments in nineteenth-century culture and science also necessitate an adaptation of the critical method to changed historical circumstances. One important factor is the professionalization of the historical disciplines that had been underway since the early nineteenth century (1907: 12). One of Windelband\u2019s central and best known philosophical contributions concerns the question what distinguishes the \u201chistorical sciences\u201d, that is, those disciplines that study the human-historical and cultural world, from the natural sciences. Windelband\u2019s answer to this question is in line with his formal-teleological conception of philosophy: by explicating the autonomous presuppositions of historical method, critical philosophy safeguards the historical sciences against methodological holism, namely the view that there is only one scientific method, and that this is the method of physics and natural science.\n\nWindelband shares the goal of securing the autonomy of the historical disciplines with his contemporary Wilhelm Dilthey. In his 1883 Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften [Introduction to the human sciences] Dilthey had founded the distinction between the natural sciences and the human sciences or \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on a distinction between outer and inner experience. While outer experience forms the basis of hypothetical knowledge in natural science, inner experience discloses \u201cfrom within\u201d how the individual is an intersection of social and cultural relations (Dilthey 1883: 30\u201332, 60\u201361, 88\u201389). Inner experience is at the same time psychological and socio-historical, and a descriptive psychology capable of grasping the integrated nexus of inner experience can provide the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d with a solid foundation (Dilthey 1894).\n\nWindelband profoundly disagrees with Dilthey\u2019s strategy for demarcating the historical disciplines. In his Strasbourg rector\u2019s address \u201cGeschichte und Naturwissenschaft\u201d [\u201cHistory and natural science\u201d] from 1894, he takes issue with the suggestion that the facts of the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d derive from a particular type of experience. He takes Dilthey to endorse an introspective view of psychological method. To this he objects that the facts of the historical disciplines do not derive from inner experience alone, and that inner perception is a dubious method in the first place. He also classifies psychology with the natural sciences, rejecting Dilthey\u2019s idea that the human-historical disciplines could be founded on a non-explanatory and non-hypothetical descriptive psychology. Perhaps most fundamentally, Windelband rejects the term \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on the ground that it suggests that the distinction between different sciences rests on a material distinction between different objects: spirit and nature (Windelband 1894: 141\u2013143).\n\nWindelband seeks an alternative method for science-classification that is purely formal. His reflections take scientific justification in its most abstract form as their starting point: justification in science is either inductive or deductive, Windelband argues, and the basic relation on which all knowledge is based is between the general and the particular (1883: 102\u2013103).\n\nThe distinction between different empirical sciences is then also to be sought at this level. In particular, Windelband argues that science might pursue one of two different \u201cknowledge goals\u201d (1894: 143): it \u201ceither seeks the general in the form of natural law or the particular in the historically determined form\u201d (1894: 145). The former approach is that of the \u201cnomothetic sciences\u201d which seek to arrive at universal apodictic judgments, treating the particular and unique as a mere exemplar or special case of the type or of the generic concept. The \u201cidiographic sciences\u201d, in contrast, aim to arrive at singular assertoric judgments that represent a unique object in its individual formation (1894: 150).\n\nWindelband emphasizes that the distinction between nomothetic and idiographic sciences is a purely formal and teleological one. One and the same object can be approached from both points of view, and which method is appropriate depends entirely on the goal or purpose of the investigation. Moreover, most sciences will involve both general and particular knowledge. The idiographic sciences in particular depend on general and causal knowledge which has been derived from the nomothetic sciences (1894: 156\u2013157).\n\nNote, however, that Windelband is not consistently restricting his analysis to the formal level. He tends to use the terms \u201cnomothetic\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d sciences, and the terms \u201cidiographic\u201d and \u201chistorical\u201d sciences interchangeably, which at least suggests a correspondence between scientific goals, methods, and objects.\n\nAlthough Windelband does not spell this out in great detail, he also suggests that values are of integral importance to the idiographic method. First, he argues that the selection of relevant historical facts depends on an assessment of what is valuable to us (1894: 153\u2013154). Second, he suggests that the integration of particular facts into larger wholes is only possible if meaningful, value-laden relations can be established such that \u201cthe particular feature is a meaningful part of a living intuition of the whole [Gesamtanschauung]\u201d (1894: 154). And third, he claims that we value the particular, unique, and individual in a way in which we do not value the general and recurrent, and that the experience of the individual is indeed at the root of our \u201cfeelings of value\u201d (1894: 155\u2013156).\n\nIt is Windelband\u2019s student Heinrich Rickert who takes up these suggestions and develops them into a systematic account of the \u201cindividuating\u201d and \u201cvalue-relating\u201d \u201cconcept-formation\u201d of the \u201chistorical sciences of culture\u201d (Rickert 1902). Rickert argues that \u201cscientific concept formation\u201d, by which science overcomes the \u201cextensive and intensive manifold\u201d of reality, depends on a principle of selection. The principle of selection at work in the natural sciences is that of \u201cgeneralization\u201d. For this reason, the natural sciences cannot account for the unique and unrepeatable character of reality. The historical sciences, in contrast, form their concepts in a manner that allows them to capture individual realities (Rickert 1902: 225, 236, 250\u2013251). They do so on the basis of values: values guide the selection of which particular historical facts belong to and can be integrated into a specific historical \u201cindividuality\u201d (examples being \u201cthe Renaissance\u201d, \u201cthe Reformation\u201d or \u201cthe German nation state\u201d). According to Rickert, one can clearly distinguish the theoretical value-relation that is the basis of historical science and practical evaluation. The historian relies on values but does not evaluate his material (Rickert 1902: 364\u2013365). Building on Windelband\u2019s core ideas about historical method, Rickert arrives at a more refined and systematized account of how historical science forms its concepts, that ultimately leads to an account of what culture as an object of scientific study amounts to.\n\nIn some of his later writings, Windelband will pick up the more developed thoughts of his student Rickert. For example, he claims that each science creates its objects according to the manner in which it forms its concepts (1907: 18), and that the historical sciences rely on a system of universal values when making selections about what enters into their concepts (1907: 20).\n\n6. The History of Philosophical Problems\n\nA large part of Windelband\u2019s oeuvre consists of writings in the history of philosophy. Windelband primarily covers modern philosophy from the Renaissance to his own time, but he also published on ancient philosophy. As a historian, Windelband is heavily indebted to Fischer. And yet, he goes significantly beyond his teacher, developing a new method and mode of historical presentation. Windelband conceives of the history of philosophy as a \u201chistory of problems\u201d. Rather than presenting a chronological sequence of great minds, he organizes the presentation of philosophical ideas according to the fundamental problems around which the philosophical debates and arguments of an age were structured. Windelband also takes a reflective attitude towards his own historiographical practice and seeks to clarify the goals and systematic relevance of the history of philosophy.\n\nIn these reflections, Windelband seeks to integrate two main thoughts: First, the idea that philosophy is a reflection of its time and age and, second, the conviction that the history of philosophy has systematic significance. Windelband finds both thoughts in Hegel\u2019s approach to the history of philosophy. Mirroring Hegel\u2019s famous dictum that \u201cphilosophy is its own time apprehended in thought\u201d, he speaks of philosophy the \u201cself-consciousness of developing cultural life\u201d (1909: 4). He also applauds Hegel\u2019s \u201cdeep insight\u201d that the history of philosophy realizes reason and thus has intrinsic relevance for systematic philosophy (1883: 133). Windelband thinks of history as the \u201corganon of philosophy\u201d (1905: 184), as a guide to the absolute values that the critical method seeks to reveal.\n\nBut despite the Hegelian gloss of these two claims, Windelband is critical of Hegelianism. This is primarily because he has a different understanding of the idea that philosophy is \u201cits own time apprehended in thought\u201d. For Windelband, this means that philosophical thinking is shaped by historically contingent factors.\n\nAccordingly, Windelband formulates two criticisms of the Hegelian conception of the history of philosophy. First, he finds fault with the idea that the order in which successive philosophical ideas emerge is necessary and that\u2014in virtue of being necessary\u2014it has systematic significance:\n\n[I]n its essentially empirical determination which is accidental with respect to the \u201cidea\u201d the historical process of development cannot have this systematic significance. (1883: 133, see also 1905: 176\u2013177)\n\nThe history of philosophy is not only shaped by the necessary self-expression of reason, but also by the causal necessity of cultural history. The cultural determinants of philosophical thinking lead to \u201cproblem-convolutions\u201d (1891: 11), in which various, conceptually unrelated philosophical questions merge with one another. Windelband also emphasizes that the \u201cindividual factor\u201d of the philosopher\u2019s character and personality is relevant for how philosophical problems and concepts are articulated in a given historical moment (1891: 12)\n\nSecond, although Windelband agrees that the historical development of philosophical ideas is partly driven by critique and self-improvement, he does not think of this process in terms of progress. Windelband probes the often unacknowledged presuppositions of our talk about progress. In \u201cPessimismus und Wissenschaft\u201d (1876) Windelband argues that science cannot decide between historical optimism and historical pessimism (1876: 243). In \u201cKritische und genetische Methode\u201d (1883) he gives a more detailed analysis of why this is the case. Historical change itself is not progress, he observes. In order to determine whether a given historical development is progressive, we need to be in possession of \u201ca standard, the idea of a purpose, which determines the value of the change\u201d (1883: 119). Windelband is wary of triumphalist narratives that identify the historical development of present-day values with progress. History is determined by contingent cultural factors and could have produced \u201cdelusions and follies \u2026 which we only take to be truths now because we are inescapably trapped in them\u201d (1883: 121). Of progress we can only speak legitimately, if we are in possession of an absolute value that allows us to assess the historical development. At minimum, this means that the appeal to a progressive history of philosophy is of no help when it comes to the systematic task of uncovering the system of absolute values: progress cannot aid in revealing absolute values as it presupposes them.\n\nBut while the fact that philosophy is at least partly determined by contingent cultural factors undercuts necessity and progress, it also opens the door for a reconceptualization of the \u201cessence\u201d of philosophy. In his Einleitung in die Philosophie [Introduction to philosophy] (1914) Windelband reflects on the fact that everyday life, culture, and science do already contain general concepts of the world. These concepts form the initial content of philosophical reflection (1914: 6). But the business of philosophy only takes off when these initial concepts, and the assumptions that are baked into them, become unstable and collapse. An experience of shock and unsettling prompts philosophy to question, rethink, and critically assess the concepts and ideas of everyday life and science. In this process of critical assessment, philosophy strives to purify these concepts and ideas, and to connect them into a coherent, unified system. According to Windelband, in this process of conceptual reorganization, a rational necessity exerts itself. The \u201cvigorous and uncompromising rethinking of the preconditions of our spiritual life\u201d creates certain philosophical problems \u201cwith objective necessity\u201d (1914: 8).\n\nWindelband provides neither a very detailed account of what \u201cphilosophical problems\u201d exactly are, nor of how precisely they spring from the unsettling of everyday concepts. But he makes three claims that, taken together, establish that philosophy, even when reflecting its particular age, is not solely determined by contingent cultural factors. First, philosophical puzzles stem from the \u201cinadequacy and contradictory imbalance\u201d of the contents that philosophy receives from life and science (1891: 10). That is, true philosophical problems emerge whenever the systematizing drive of philosophy is confronted with the deep incoherence of life. Second, philosophical problems are necessary because the conceptual \u201cmaterial\u201d found in life already contains \u201cthe objective presuppositions and logical coercions for all rational deliberation about it\u201d (1891: 10). The necessity of philosophical problems is logical necessity. Third, despite historical change\n\n[c]ertain differences of world- and life-attitudes reoccur over and over again, combat each other and destroy each other in mutual dialectics. (1914: 10)\n\nBecause philosophical problems emerge \u201cnecessarily\u201d and \u201cobjectively\u201d, they also reoccur throughout history. Philosophical problems are thus timeless and eternal (1891: 9\u201310; 1914: 11)).\n\nWindelband also believes that the history of philosophy, pursued empirically and scientifically, can disentangle from one another the \u201ctemporal causes and timeless reasons\u201d (1905: 189) that together give rise to the emergence of philosophical problems.\n\nOnly through knowledge of the empirical trajectory that is free of constructions can come to light \u2026. what is the share of \u2026 the needs of the age on the one hand\u2026but on the other hand that of the objective necessities of conceptual progress. (1905: 189)\n\nAt this point, Windelband reaches a clear verdict on the goal and systematic significance of the history of philosophy: it lies in disentangling that which is contingently actually accepted from that which is \u201cvalid in itself\u201d (1905: 199). History is the \u201corganon of critical philosophy\u201d precisely to the extent that it allows us to distinguish the actually accepted norms of cultural life from that which is absolutely valid (1883: 132).\n\n7. Critical Philosophy and World-Views\n\nWindelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d is also an intervention into debates that had preoccupied the neo-Kantian movement and German academic philosophy more broadly since the materialism controversy [Materialismusstreit]: what the relation between science and world-views is, and whether philosophy is capable of providing a \u201cworld-view\u201d.\n\nGiven that he takes the core of the critical project to consist in a quaestio juris\u2014a concern with normativity\u2014it seems surprising that throughout the 1880s Windelband insists that critical philosophy does not provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d: the project of revealing the highest values of human life has nothing to do with \u201cworld-views\u201d, he argues, because it does not provide a metaphysical account of the world and our place in it (1881: 140\u2013141, 145). Questions about optimism or pessimism cannot be answered by means of \u201cscientific\u201d philosophy, since they depend on the idea that the world as a whole has a purpose. And claims about the ultimate purpose of the world arise only from an unscientific, subjective, and arbitrary projection of particular purposes onto the universe as such (1876: 231). Philosophy is a science, albeit a second-order formal science, and is thus barred from formulating a world-view that would be metaphysical in character.\n\nAfter 1900, however, Windelband\u2019s position on the question of world-views changes. He now claims that it is the aim of philosophy to provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d with scientific justification (1907: 1). Given that Windelband holds that philosophy in general and the Kantian project in particular need to be adapted to the developing circumstances of time and culture, this change of position is not inconsequential: the cultural landscape of the early 1900s demands a revision of the neo-Kantian project that highlights not only its \u201cnegative\u201d and critical aspects, but also develops its positive implications for cultural life (1907, 8). The shift to a more positive attitude towards philosophy as a world-view corresponds to a re-evaluation of Kant\u2019s oeuvre, in which Windelband at least partly suspends the anti-metaphysical rigor of the \u201cthird phase\u201d of the genesis of the Critique of Pure Reason, and attributes more relevance to the Critique of the Power of Judgment. This view is taken up by Rickert, who later argues in more detail that the third Critique forms the core of critical philosophy, and that Kant\u2019s metaphysical project can provide the basis for an encompassing theory of world-views (Rickert 1924: 153\u2013168).\n\nIn his 1904 \u201cNach hundert Jahren\u201d [\u201cAfter one hundred years\u201d] Windelband provides yet another take on the relation between the natural and the normative. Declaring the question how the realm of natural laws is related to the realm of values to be the \u201chighest\u201d philosophical endeavor (1904a: 162), he now sees in the Critique of the Power of Judgment the possibility of solving this problem: here one finds the idea that the purposive system of nature gives rise to the value-determined process of human history. The central concept that allows for connecting nature and history in this way is that of \u201crealization\u201d (1904a: 162\u20133).\n\nThe turn to the concept of \u201crealization\u201d also leads to a shift in how Windelband approaches the problem of science classification. In 1894, Windelband had thought of the nomothetic and idiographic sciences as two fundamental yet disjointed and even incommensurable approaches to seeking knowledge of the word: \u201cLaw and event persist next to each other as the last, incommensurable factors of our representation of the world\u201d (1894: 160). But in 1904, he claims that the concept of realization provides a common, unified basis for the natural and the historical sciences (1904a: 163).\n\nWindelband\u2019s language assumes a Hegelian tone. Critical philosophy equipped with the concept of realization is able to grasp and express the \u201cspiritual value content\u201d of reality (1904a: 165). History is capable of revealing the universal value content in the contingent maze of human interests and desires, and in so doing captures \u201cthe progressive realization of rational values\u201d (1907: 20\u201321). The human as a rational being is not determined psychologically or naturally, but humanity is a historical task: \u201conly as a historical being, as the developing species, do we have a share in world-reason\u201d (1910a: 283: see also 1905: 185). Windelband even suggests that history itself has a goal, namely the realization of a common humanity (1908: 257).\n\nThese remarks remain cursory however, and there is room for debate over how much of Hegel\u2019s ontology of history Windelband takes on board, as well as whether his talk about the progressive realization of reason in history is incompatible with the formal-teleological method that he had endorsed in the 1880s and 1890s. His \u201cKulturphilosophie und transzendentaler Idealismus\u201d [\u201cPhilosophy of culture and transcendental idealism\u201d] of 1910 presents us with a puzzling fusion of Kantian and Hegelian language. The goal of critical philosophy is that of revealing the unity of culture, Windelband now claims, and this unity can only be found"}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-5137-8_7", "page_content": "So far I have emphasised Windelband\u2019s theory of judgement out of consideration for his link to the Brentanian theory. A prominent part of the \u2018Contributions to the Theory of Negative Judgement\u2019, however, is devoted to the discussion of Brentano\u2019s theses. In a decisive passage, Windelband precisely states that Brentano has anticipated (Df. J):\n\nThe exposition Brentano has given \u2014 starting from quite other, merely psychological viewpoints \u2014 is as clarifying and convincing as Bergmann\u2019s logical reflection on the issue [see Bergmann 1879; AD], and they both lead to the same result: to demonstrate in \u2018judgement\u2019, besides the function of representing (Vorstellen) or of combination of ideas (Vorstellungsverbindung), the other function of (approving or disapproving) assessment. (Windelband 1 1884a = 21921, 172)\n\nThis reference to Brentano is not astonishing, since Brentano\u2019s theory may be regarded as the prototype of the thetic view. To be sure, Windelband\u2019s concept of epistemic assessment also aims at capturing the positional or thetic dimension of any judgement, since it implies that judging is not properly combining some ideas together, yet rather assessing a given combination of ideas or a propositional content, which has been previously formed and is available for becoming the content of a judicative act. Predication is at the very least a property of judgeable content (a noematic property), provided that a judgeable content is not a full judgement yet until it is assessed as \u2018true\u2019 or \u2018false\u2019.\n\nTo some extent, this use of the act-content distinction might be considered similar to that of Brentano. Indeed, according to Brentano too, judging is simply not a way of constructing a propositional content, for propositional content is common to judgement and to question. For instance, asking or hearing the question <Is this tree red?>, Brentano remarks, I perform exactly the same connection between the representational contents <tree> and <red> as in the judgement <This tree is red>. My ability to understand the question exactly indicates that I already grasp the representational content as a whole (Brentano 2008, 228). Yet unlike judgement, question is neither true nor false. It does not imply any epistemic decision coming from the agent. In order to provide a usable theory of judgement, one has to capture precisely the difference between questioning and judging. And this requirement does not enable us to adopt, say, a noematical concept of judgement, because noematical components may be the same in judging and questioning acts. In short, both Windelband and Brentano maintain that judging is not a matter of content, but rather a matter of act. Both of them develop a noetical concept of judgement.\n\nNevertheless, for this comparison with Brentano to be instructive, it is necessary to refine our approach and to distinguish at least three Brentanian theses. Let us express them as follows:\n\n(T1) Every judicative act is grounded on a representational act (grounding thesis). (T2) A judgeable representational content does not need to be compounded; it may be simple (simplicity thesis). (T3) Every attributive judgement is reducible to an existential judgement (reducibility thesis).\n\nJust like Brentano, Windelband assumes (T1). Every judicative act surely needs a content to which it applies, and only representing acts are likely to provide us with a judgeable content. Thus, every judging act is constructed upon a representing act; it is, so to speak, an act of higher level. So we could have representations without assessment (for instance, in the case of hypotheses or questions), but we could not perform any assessment without an assessed idea. The availability of a representational content is the first condition in order to perform a successful judgement. Nevertheless, Windelband remarks it is not necessary to understand (T1) as the claim that we have a succession of acts in the stream of consciousness. On the contrary, it is possible that representation and judgement occur simultaneously in the same act. In Windelband\u2019s terms, the \u2018representing function\u2019 and the \u2018assessment function\u2019 can form \u2018two aspects (Momente) of one single indivisible act\u2019 (Windelband 1 1884a = 21921, 175). Otherwise, Windelband fully agrees with Brentano that judging is nothing but a certain way for consciousness to relate to any representational content.\n\nYet another question to consider is whether any representational content is a judgeable content or not. Supporting (T2), Brentano answers that question affirmatively. Whether a given representational content is simple or complex, as a representational content it is in either case available for being acknowledged-as-true or rejected-as-false. When I judge that S is, Brentano maintains, I just acknowledge S\u2014and not the existence-of-S. Windelband, however, does not admit this view. Unlike Brentano, he explicitly rejects (T2): When I state an affirmative judgement, he writes, the \u2018acknowledgement (Anerkennung) is never directed towards a simple representational content, but always deals with a relation (Beziehung)\u2019 (Windelband 2 1907, 192). Accordingly, in order to be a judgeable content, a representational content must be complex or compounded. Even the subject of an existential judgement is not a simple idea, for \u2018every \u201cjudgement\u201d involves a combination of ideas as object of its assessment\u2019 (Windelband 1 1884a = 21921, 182). So, though Windelband rejects the synthetic theory of judgement at the noetical level, he keeps it at the noematical level, that is to say at the level of judgeable or assessable contents. This is his first anti-Brentanian thesis.\n\nDespite his rejection of (T2), Windelband agrees with (T3). Insofar as judging itself is not producing a combination of ideas by means of a predicative feature, every judicative act may be expressed in a non-predicative way. So every judgement would be reducible to an existential assertion of the form <Sp is/is not> or <There is/is not Sp>. As Brentano remarks, this reducibility thesis applies to all forms of judgement of Aristotle\u2019s so-called logical square. Brentano\u2019s main idea is that in all the judgements we state, including the so-called universal judgements, we take something to be existent. Every epistemic decision is thus also, in Brentano\u2019s view, an ontological decision, for it is the same to acknowledge as true the connection between <a rose> and <red> and to judge that there is a red rose. If the affirmative judgement is correct, it has an object.Footnote 4 Using the notation introduced by Brentano\u2019s pupil, Franz Hillebrand (1891), one therefore obtains the following interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s logical square (note that the sign <\u2212> does not have exactly the same meaning when occurring outside or inside the brackets: Outside, <\u2212> denotes the negative existential operator, correlated to the positive existential operator <+>; inside <\u2212> denotes a negative predication-operator)Footnote 5:\n\n<Every rose is a flower>= <No rose is an animal>= <There is no rose that is not a flower> <There is no rose that is an animal> \u2013 (S-p) \u2013 (Sp) Brentano\u2019s interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s logical square + (Sp) + (S-p) <Some rose is red> = <Some rose is not red> = <There is a red rose> <There is a rose that is not red>\n\nWhat is, then, Windelband\u2019s own position towards this interpretation? As I have said, he agrees with (T3), yet he develops a more nuanced approach. Brentano\u2019s interpretation, he points out, implies that every propositional content is likely to be nominalised in order to become the subject of an existential judgement. For instance, the judgement <God rules the world> may be rendered by <God\u2019s ruling of the world is> (Windelband 1 1884a = 21921, 180). According to Windelband, Brentano would be right in maintaining such a reducibility, yet he would be wrong in neglecting the various meanings of the word <is>, which result from this nominalization process (ibid., 184). So, unlike Brentano, Windelband does not maintain that every judgement is equivalent to an existential position in the proper sense, for not every epistemic assessment is about the existence of actual objects.\n\nHis main argument consists of defending another anti-Brentanian thesis. Let us call it the ambiguity-thesis of the existential <is>. Consider the following propositions:\n\n(P3) <Freedom is.> (P4) <God is.> (P5) <Lightning is the cause of thunder.> (P6) <Every rose is a flower.>\n\n(P3) and (P4) are existential propositions, yet it is already doubtful, Windelband says, whether the word <is> has exactly the same meaning in both of them. Contrasting with (P3) and (P4), (P5) and (P6) are not existential propositions. Nevertheless, if one assumes the reducibility thesis, as Brentano and Windelband do, it must be possible to translate them into existential propositions. As for (P5), Windelband proposes the following existential translation:\n\n(P5*) <A causal relationship between lightning and thunder is.>\n\nNow, Windelband argues, the word <is> in (P5*) does not seem to have the same meaning as in (P3) and (P4), because a causal relationship cannot be said to \u2018exist\u2019 in the same sense as a property or an actual being is said to exist. The issue becomes clearer again with (P6). As we have seen, Brentano maintains that (P6) should be existentially rendered by means of a double negation: <A rose, which is not a flower, is not.> Obviously, this solution enables Brentano to conserve the univocal nature of the existential <is>: The word <is>, used in existential constructions, simply means <exists>. Yet Windelband\u2019s existential translation of the same judgement is quite different. According to him, one should render (P6) by:\n\n(P6*) <The subordination of the rose to the concept of flower is.>\n\nIn such an existential judgement, the word <is> obviously has a very specific meaning, for the subordination to a concept is not something that can actually exist the way that tables, chairs or roses do. In this case, Windelband claims, our judgement does not deal with any existential positing of objects. We certainly perform an epistemic assessment, yet this epistemic assessment is not equivalent to an existential position stricto sensu. What does it mean then? Windelband\u2019s answer is here taken from Lotze: The word <is> in (P6*) does not mean <is actually being> but rather <is valid> (gilt). So, Windelband concludes being (existence) and validity are two distinct meanings of the word <is> in existential constructions. They are meanings of the relation, which form the judgeable content. For instance, <being> is the meaning of the so-called inherence-relationship, which links a property (<red>) to a thing (<this rose>), while <validity> is the meaning of a conceptual subordination or class-inclusion. Even if those distinctions depend in each case on the assessed content (that is to say on the nominalised subject of the existential judgement), Windelband considers that they have an impact on the meaning of the assessment itself (Windelband 1 1884a = 21921, 184). Therefore, a fully developed theory of judgement has to account for the so-called division of judgements from the (noematic) viewpoint of relation.Footnote 6"}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/windelband-wilhelm-1848-1915", "page_content": "WINDELBAND, WILHELM\n\n(1848 \u2013 1915)\n\nThe German philosopher and historian of philosophy Wilhelm Windelband was born in Potsdam and educated at Jena, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen. He taught philosophy at Z\u00fcrich, Freiburg im Breisgau, Strasbourg, and Heidelberg. He was a disciple of Rudolf Hermann Lotze and Kuno Fischer and was the leader of the so-called southwestern German (or Baden) school of neo-Kantianism. He is best known for his work in history of philosophy, to which he brought a new mode of exposition\u2014the organization of the subject by problems rather than by chronological sequence of individual thinkers. As a systematic philosopher he is remembered for his attempt to extend the principles of Kantian criticism to the historical sciences, his attempt to liberate philosophy from identification with any specific scientific discipline, and his sympathetic appreciation of late nineteenth-century philosophy of value.\n\nWindelband believed that whereas the various sciences (mathematical, natural, and historical) have specific objects and limit their investigations to determined areas of the total reality, philosophy finds its unique object in the knowledge of reality provided by these various disciplines taken together as a whole. The task of philosophy, he held, was to explicate the a priori bases of science in general. The aim of philosophy was to show not how science is possible but why there are many different kinds of science; the relationships that obtain between these various sciences; and the nature of the relation between the critical intelligence\u2014the knowing, willing, and feeling subject\u2014and consciousness in general.\n\nAccording to Windelband, both the triumphs and the limitations of contemporary philosophical thought had their origins in Immanuel Kant's thought. Kant had established the dogma that all knowledge must be of the type provided by the natural sciences. But, Windelband held, if knowledge is limited to only that which can be contained within the categories as set forth in the Critique of Pure Reason, then the kinds of activities associated with the will and the emotions\u2014that is to say, the subjects of Kant's second and third critiques\u2014are removed from the province of knowledge. The inadequacies of the Kantian identification of knowledge in general with natural scientific knowledge alone had been demonstrated by the post-Kantian idealists, who sought to construct a theory of knowledge capable of appreciating \"the needs of modern culture, and \u2026 the historical material of ideas\" (History of Philosophy, p. 569). Idealism failed, however, because it ended by hypostatizing a spiritual sphere that presumably was separate from the world of matter and that operated according to principles utterly different from those which science explicated in general causal laws. Thus, whereas Kantianism had failed to include ethics and aesthetics within the domain of scientific philosophy, idealism failed to provide a place for those aspects of the world revealed by the natural sciences and eternally established as causally determined. It thus appeared to late nineteenth-century thinkers that there were at least two levels of reality, one spiritual and historical, the other material and determined; and it seemed that knowledge itself, far from being one, was at least twofold. On the one hand, it was empirical and discovered laws; on the other hand, it was rational and revealed the essential freedom behind the laws. Such at least had been the contention of Wilhelm Dilthey and the neo-idealists. As long as this division persisted, Windelband held, pessimism, the denial of philosophy, must flourish also.\n\nThe way out of the difficulty was to be provided by a fundamental reappraisal in philosophy, a reconsideration of modern thought ab initio. For Windelband this meant primarily an attempt to find a way to apply the technique of transcendental deduction to the historical as well as the physical sciences. It also meant liberation from the notion that natural science was the archetype of all knowledge.\n\nIn an early address, \"Was ist Philosophie?\" (1882), Windelband distinguished between theoretical judgments (Urteile ) and critical judgments (Beurteilungen ). The former expressed the \"mutual implicativeness\" (Zusammengeh\u00f6rigkeit ) of two \"representational contents\" (Vorstellungsinhalte ); the latter expressed the relation between the judging consciousness (beurteilenden Bewusstsein ) and the object represented (see Pr\u00e4ludien, Vol. I, p. 29). Theoretical judgments are judgments of fact and are always positive; their purpose is to extend the limits of knowledge in a given science. Critical judgments, however, can be either positive or negative, and they express the position assumed by the subject when a given theoretical judgment is endowed with a status as means to some end.\n\nThe individual sciences expand the series of theoretical judgments; philosophy examines the relations between the ability of individual consciousness to render judgments and that \"consciousness in general\" (Bewusstsein \u00fcberhaupt ) which is the intuited basis of every critical judgment. Philosophy, then, \"has its own proper field and its own problem in those values of universal validity that are the organizing principles for the functions of culture and civilization and for all the particular values of life. But it will describe and explain those values only that it may give an account of their validity; it treats them not as facts but as norms\" (History of Philosophy, pp. 680\u2013681). The various sciences are concerned with facts, which they organize in different ways according to the ends for which those facts are \"constructed.\" Philosophy, however, is concerned with the processes by which events attain the status of facts for particular sciences.\n\nCritical judgments, then, are rendered in respect not of what is but of what ought to be; in accordance not with laws but with norms. There is a \"normative consciousness\" (Normalbewusstsein ) presupposed by philosophy; this \"normative consciousness\" is in abstracto the same as that which, in concreto, underlies every scientific, moral, and aesthetic experience. It is not to be thought of as either a metaphysical or a psychological entity. It is, rather, merely the \"sum-total of the inter-connections and relations between existents\" (Logic, p. 59). These relations \"are not themselves existents, either as things, as states, or as activities; they can only become 'actual' as the content of the psychical functions of knowing.\u2026 In itself the realm of the valid is nothing else than the form and order under which that which exists is determined\" (ibid.). It follows, then, that \"this whole is closed to our knowledge; we shall never know more than a few fragments of it, and there is no prospect of our ever being able to patch it together out of the scraps that we can gather\" (ibid., p. 65). Therefore, philosophy cannot end in science or in any practical rule of life; it can only point the attention of humanity to the sensed \"principles of absolute judgment\" that are presupposed in every human confrontation of the world in scientific, moral, and aesthetic experience.\n\nWindelband regarded as baseless every attempt to distinguish between the different disciplines that constitute science on the basis of a presumed essential difference between their objects. The disciplines are distinguished only by their methods, which are in turn functions of the ends or values informing them as instruments of culture. In the address \"Geschichte und Naturwissenschaften\" (1894), he distinguished between the natural sciences and the historical sciences, and he argued that the natural sciences aim at the construction of general laws and \"explain\" an event by identifying it as an instance of a general law. Historical sciences, on the other hand, are individualizing; they concentrate on specific events and attempt to determine their specific physiognomy or form. Natural science Windelband termed nomothetic ; historical science, idiographic. But, he added, any given object could be studied by both kinds of science. A mental event, if viewed under the aspect of physical causality\u2014as an instance of the working of some general law\u2014was a natural event. That same mental event, described in its individuality and valued for its deviation from the class to which it belonged, became an object of the idiographic sciences. Positivists erred in holding that every event must be viewed nomothetically, just as idealists erred in thinking that certain kinds of events cannot be so viewed. The total picture of the world that consciousness is in principle able to construct can be constructed only through the use of both kinds of investigation. No single event can be deduced from general laws, and no law can be framed out of the contemplation of a single event. \"Law and event remain together as the ultimate, incommensurable limits of our representation of the world\" (Pr\u00e4ludien, Vol. II, p. 160).\n\nSee also Consciousness; Dilthey, Wilhelm; Fischer, Kuno; History and Historiography of Philosophy; Idealism; Kant, Immanuel; Lotze, Rudolf Hermann; Neo-Kantianism.\n\nBibliography\n\nworks by windelband\n\nDie Lehre vom Zufall.

He made important contributions to many fields in philosophy, especially to the philosophy of mind, metaphysics and ontology, ethics, logic, the history of philosophy, and philosophical theology. Brentano was strongly influenced by Aristotle and the Scholastics as well as by the empiricist and positivist movements of the early nineteenth century. Due to his introspectionist approach of describing consciousness from a first person point of view, on one hand, and his rigorous style as well as his contention that philosophy should be done with exact methods like the natural sciences, on the other, Brentano is often considered a forerunner of both the phenomenological movement and the tradition of analytic philosophy. A charismatic teacher, Brentano exerted a strong influence on the work of Edmund Husserl, Alexius Meinong, Christian von Ehrenfels, Kasimir Twardowski, Carl Stumpf, and Anton Marty, among others, and thereby played a central role in the philosophical development of central Europe in the early twentieth century.\n\nFranz Brentano was born on January 16, 1838 in Marienberg am Rhein, Germany, a descendent of a strongly religious German-Italian family of intellectuals (his uncle Clemens Brentano and his aunt Bettina von Arnim were among the most important writers of German Romanticism and his brother Lujo Brentano became a leading expert in social economics). He studied mathematics, poetry, philosophy, and theology in Munich, W\u00fcrzburg, and Berlin. Already at high school he became acquainted with Scholasticism; at university he studied Aristotle with Trendelenburg in Berlin, and read Comte as well as the British Empiricists (mainly John Stuart Mill), all of whom had a great influence on his work. Brentano received his Ph.D. from the University of T\u00fcbingen in 1862, with his thesis On the Several Senses of Being in Aristotle.\n\nAfter graduation Brentano prepared to take his vows; he was ordained a Catholic priest in 1864. Nevertheless he continued his academic career at the University of W\u00fcrzburg, where he presented his Habilitationsschrift on The Psychology of Aristotle in 1867. Despite reservations in the faculty about his priesthood he eventually became full professor in 1873. During this period, however, Brentano struggled more and more with the official doctrine of the Catholic Church, especially with the dogma of papal infallibility, promulgated at the first Vatican Council in 1870. Shortly after his promotion at the University of W\u00fcrzburg, Brentano withdrew from the priesthood and from his position as professor.\n\nAfter his Habilitation, Brentano had started to work on a large scale work on the foundations of psychology, which he entitled Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint. The first volume was published in 1874, a second volume (The Classification of Mental Phenomena) followed in 1911, and fragments of the third volume (Sensory and Noetic Consciousness) were published posthumously by Oskar Kraus in 1928.\n\nShortly after the publication of the first volume, Brentano took a job as a full professor at the University of Vienna, where he continued a successful teaching career. During his tenure in Vienna, Brentano, who was very critical towards his own writing, did not pursue his plans to complete and publish the second and third volumes of his Psychology, but preferred to publish shorter texts, most of which were based on manuscripts for public lectures. The topics range from aesthetics (Das Genie [The Genius], Das Schlechte als Gegenstand dichterischer Darstellung [Evil as Object of Poetic Representation]) and issues in historiography to The Origin of the Knowledge of Right and Wrong, in which Brentano laid out his views on ethics. The latter was Brentano\u2019s first book to be translated into English in 1902.\n\nWhen in 1880 Brentano and Ida von Lieben decided to wed, they had to confront the fact that the prevailing law in the Austro-Hungarian Empire denied matrimony to persons who had been ordained priests \u2013 even if they later had resigned from priesthood. They surmounted this obstacle by temporarily moving to and becoming citizens of Saxony, where they finally got married. This was possible only by temporarily giving up the Austrian citizenship and, in consequence, the job as full professor at the University. When Brentano came back to Vienna a few months later, the Austrian authorities did not reassign him his position. Brentano became Privatdozent, a status that allowed him to go on teaching \u2013 but did not entitle him to receive a salary or to supervise theses. For several years he tried in vain to get his position back. In 1895, after the death of his wife, he left Austria disappointed; at this occasion, he published a series of three articles in the Viennese newspaper Die neue freie Presse entitled Meine letzen W\u00fcnsche f\u00fcr \u00d6sterreich [My Last Wishes for Austria] (which soon afterwards appeared as a self-standing book), in which he outlined his philosophical position as well as his approach to psychology, but also harshly criticized the legal situation of former priests in Austria. In 1896 he settled down in Florence where he got married to Emilie Ruprecht in 1897.\n\nBrentano has often been described as an extraordinarily charismatic teacher. Throughout his life he influenced a great number of students, many of who became important philosophers and psychologists in their own rights, such as Edmund Husserl, Alexius Meinong, Christian von Ehrenfels, Anton Marty, Carl Stumpf, Kasimir Twardowski, as well as Sigmund Freud. Many of his students became professors in different parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Marty and Ehrenfels in Prague, Meinong in Graz, and Twardowski in Lvov (now Lviv), and so spread Brentanianism over the whole Austro-Hungarian Empire, which explains the central role of Brentano in the philosophical development in central Europe, especially in what was later called the Austrian Tradition in philosophy.\n\nBrentano always emphasized that he meant to teach his students to think critically and in a scientific manner, without holding prejudices and paying undue respect to philosophical schools or traditions. When former students of his took a critical approach to his own work, however, when they criticized some of his doctrines and modified others to adapt them for their own goals, Brentano reacted bitterly. He often refused to discuss criticism, ignored improvements, and thus became more and more isolated, a development that was reinforced by his increasing blindness.\n\nDue to these eye-problems Brentano could not read or write any longer, but had his wife read to him and dictated his work to her. Nonetheless, he produced a number of books in his years in Florence. In 1907 he published Untersuchungen zur Sinnespsychologie, a collection of shorter texts on psychology. In 1911 he presented not only the second volume of his Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint, but also two books on Aristotle: in Aristotle and his World View he provides an outline and interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s philosophy. In Aristoteles Lehre vom Ursprung des menschlichen Geistes Brentano continues a debate with Zeller. This debate had started already in the 1860s, when Brentano criticized Zeller\u2019s interpretation of Aristotle in his Psychology of Aristotle and became quite intense and aggressive in the seventies and eighties of the nineteenth century.\n\nWhen Italy entered war against Germany and Austria during World War I, Brentano, who felt himself a citizen of all three countries, moved from Florence to neutral Switzerland. He passed away in Zurich on March 17, 1917.\n\nBrentano left a huge number of unpublished manuscripts, including poetry and letters on a wide range of philosophical topics in his last domicile in Z\u00fcrich and in his summer-residence in Sch\u00f6nb\u00fchel bei Melk; some manuscripts were probably left behind in Florence. After his death, Alfred Kastil and Oskar Kraus, who were students of Brentano\u2019s former student Anton Marty in Prague, worked on the Nachlass, transferring a good part of it to Innsbruck. Their attempt to set up a Brentano-archive was supported by Tomas Masaryk, a former student of Brentano who had become founder and first President (from 1918 to 1935) of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. As a result, in 1932 many of the original manuscripts were moved to Prague where an archive was founded. Alas, due to the political turbulences that were to came over central Europe the project made it necessary to transfer the archive again. Substantial parts of the Nachlass were transferred to different places in the United States, some of it has later been brought back to Europe, especially to the Brentano-Forschungsstelle at the University of Graz, Austria, and the Brentano family archive in Blonay, Switzerland. (For a detailed history of Brentano\u2019s Nachlass, cf. Binder (2013)).\n\nKastil and Kraus did succeed, however, to begin to publish posthumously some of the lecture notes, letters, and drafts he had left. They tried to present Brentano\u2019s work as best as they could, putting together various texts to what they thought were rounded, convincing works, sometimes following questionable editorial criteria. Their work was continued by other, more careful editors, but has by far not yet been completed: a much needed critical edition of his complete \u0153uvre is still to be waited for.\n\nA central principle of Brentano\u2019s philosophy, which should become widely accepted among Brentano\u2019s students, was that philosophy should be done in a rigorous, scientific manner. Already early in his career, in the public defense of his Habilitation in 1866, he stated 25 theses, the fourth of which reads: \u201cThe true method of philosophy is that of natural science.\u201d (contained in: ZP, 136, my translation) [\u201cVerae philosophiae methodus nihil alia est nisi scientiae naturarum\u201d]. Brentano, thus, opposed the idea that there was a unique method for philosophy and denied that there was a \u201cfirst philosophy\u201d that could unveil genuinely philosophical truths and thus play a privileged or foundational role in the overall system of the sciences. According to Brentano, philosophy\u2014and in particular philosophical psychology\u2014should apply a method that is based on observation, description of facts, and induction; just like the (other) natural sciences.\n\nIt has been suggested that Brentano\u2019s fourth Habilitations-thesis makes him an advocate of a particular version of the unity of the sciences, according to which there is a unity of method (cf. Haller 1993, 27) and that it stands in contrast to \u201cDilthey\u2019s view according to which the so-called Geisteswissenschaften or human or moral sciences would somehow call for a special method of \u2018understanding\u2019 or Verstehen, as opposed to the \u2018explanation\u2019 of the natural sciences.\u201d (Smith 1994, 31). One has to be cautious not to overstate this point, though. While it is true that Brentano uses both the terms \u201cmethod\u201d [methodus] and \u201cnatural science\u201d [scientiae naturarum] in the singular, there is strong evidence that he had a minimal understanding of what this method should exactly consist in. He never suggested that all scientific disciplines could be reduced to other, more basic disciplines, nor did he argue that all natural sciences should apply exactly the same method, nor that mathematization or the use of a formal language was indispensable for scientificity. For Brentano, a method counts as scientific as long as it fulfills the minimal requirements of applying observation, description of facts, and induction. The specific methodological procedures applied in a given scientific discipline depend first and foremost on the objects studied:\n\n\u201cNatural science, thus, requires in no way [...] that we should proceed everywhere in the same manner and in the way we do in the simplest cases of mechanics. On the contrary, it teaches and instructs us to change our procedure [Verfahren] in accordance with the particular nature of the objects\u201d (ZP, 35, my translation).\n\n[\u201cDie Naturwissenschaft verlangt also keineswegs, [...] da\u00df wir \u00fcberall gleichm\u00e4\u00dfig und so, wie in den einfachsten F\u00e4llen der Mechanik vorgehen sollen. Im Gegenteil, sie unterweist uns und \u00fcbt uns darauf ein, der besonderen Natur der Gegenst\u00e4nde entsprechend unser Verfahren zu \u00e4ndern\u201d]\n\nRegarding formal methods he states: \u201cMathematical analysis, which is the main means of scientific progress in some areas of natural science, does not play nearly any role at all in others.\u201d (ZK 35, my translation) [\u201cDie mathematische Analyse, die auf manchem Gebiet der Naturwissenschaft das haupts\u00e4chliche Mittel des Fortschritt ist, spielt darum bekanntlich auf anderen so gut wie gar keine Rolle.\u201d] Brentano has never made an attempt to introduce formal or mathematical methods in philosophy or psychology. On the contrary, he criticized Johann Friedrich Herbart\u2019s attempts to mathematize psychology, pointing out that Herbart\u2019s mathematical deductions lack empirical foundation and therefore lose contact to the actual phenomena (cf. LW, 36). In another place where he discusses Herbart\u2019s position, he states: \u201cAlas, many believed that where there is so much mathematical rigour, there must be exact science\u201d (GA, 53f, my translation). [\u201cLeider meinten viele, wo so viel mathematische Strenge zu finden sei, m\u00fcsse exakte Wissenschaft gegeben sein.\u201d] For Brentano, any rigorous, scientific method had to be appropriate for the observed phenomena; his position, thus, is closer to classical empiricism and positivism than to the logical positivism as it was developed in Vienna a decade after his death.\n\nBrentano\u2019s views concerning the right method in philosophy was of particular importance to his contributions to psychology, as already the title of his main work, Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint suggests. Also there he argued that the right procedure consisted in observing and describing the relevant phenomena and establishing the general laws on the basis of induction. The particularity of Brentano\u2019s method lies in the fact that psychology is based mainly on observation that is performed from a first person point of view. The psychologist draws on the intimate knowledge concerning her own current mental phenomena that she gains through inner perception (which, as we shall see below, is to be distinguished from inner observation). Brentano does not suggest, however, that these descriptions are infallible: as it is impossible to live and describe a particular experience at the same time, all descriptions of mental phenomena have to rely on memory and inner observation.\n\n\u201cIf the attempt to observe the anger which stirs us becomes impossible because the phenomenon disappears, it is clear that an earlier state of excitement can no longer be interfered in this way. And we really can focus our attention on a past mental phenomenon just as we can upon a present physical phenomenon, and in this way we can, so to speak, observe it.\u201d (PES, 26).\n\n[\u201cWenn der Versuch, den Zorn, der uns bewegt, beobachtend zu verfolgen, durch Aufhebung des Ph\u00e4nomens unm\u00f6glich wird, so kann dagegen ein Zustand fr\u00fcherer Aufregung offenbar keine St\u00f6rung mehr erleiden. Auch gelingt es wirklich, dem vergangenen psychischen Ph\u00e4nomen so wie einem gegenw\u00e4rtigen physischen mit Aufmerksamkeit sich zuzuwenden, und es in dieser Weise sozusagen beobachten.\u201d (PES, 49)]\n\nMoreover, as inner perception and memory as sources of experience are limited to one\u2019s own mental life, they have to be complemented with the \u201cindirect knowledge of the mental phenomena of others\u201d [\u201cindirekte Erkenntnis fremder psychischer Ph\u00e4nomene\u201d], which we can gain on the basis of the manifest behavior we can observe in others, including their verbal behavior, i.e., when \u201ca person describes them directly in words.\u201d (PES 28) [\u201cjemand geradezu in Worten sie beschreibt\u201d] (PES 53).\n\nBrentano\u2019s approach, like that of other introspectionist psychologists of the late nineteenth century, was harshly criticized with the rise of scientific psychology in the tradition of logical positivism, especially by behaviorists, who argue that empirical psychology must not make use of introspection, but only of data that can be obtained by the observation of the manifest behaviour of human beings from a third-person point of view. This should not obscure the fact that Brentano did play a crucial role in the process of psychology becoming an independent science. He distinguished between genetic and empirical or, as he called it, descriptive psychology, a distinction that is most explicitly drawn in lecture notes form the mid-1880s that have been published in Descriptive Psychology (DP). Genetic psychology studies psychological phenomena from a third-person point of view. It involves the use of experiments and thus satisfies the scientific standards we nowadays expect of an empirical science. Even though Brentano never conducted psychological experiments in laboratories, he very actively supported the installation of the first laboratories for experimental psychology in the Austro-Hungarian Empire \u2013 a goal that was achieved by his student Alexius Meinong in Graz. Descriptive psychology (to which Brentano sometimes also referred as \u201cphenomenology\u201d (cf. DP 137)) aims at describing consciousness from a first-person point of view. Its goal is to list \u201cfully the basic components out of which everything internally perceived by humans is composed, and \u2026 [to enumerate] the ways in which these components can be connected\u201d (DP 4). Brentano\u2019s distinction between genetic and descriptive psychology strongly influenced Husserl\u2019s development of the phenomenological method, especially in its early phases. But already then Brentano could not approve of Husserl\u2019s development for it involved the intuition of abstract essences, the existence of which Brentano denied. With his so-called \u201ctranscendental turn\u201d in the mid of the first decade of the twentieth century, Husserl alienated himself more and more from the Brentanian roots of the phenomenological method.\n\nBrentano\u2019s main goal was to lay the basis for a scientific psychology, which he defines as \u201cthe science of mental phenomena\u201d (PES, 14) [\u201cWissenschaft von den psychischen Erscheinungen\u201d]. In order to give flesh to this definition of the discipline, he provides a more detailed characterization of mental phenomena. He proposes six criteria to distinguish mental from physical phenomena (PES 61\u201377), the most important of which are: (i) mental phenomena are the exclusive object of inner perception, (ii) they always appear as a unity, and (iii) they are always intentionally directed towards an object. (The other three criteria are: psychological phenomena \u2013 and only those \u2013 are presentations or phenomena based upon presentations; they seem to have no spatial extension; and have not only intentional, but also actual existence.) I will discuss the first two criteria in the next sub-section, and the third in a separate sub-section below.\n\nAll mental phenomena have in common, Brentano argues, \u201cthat they are only perceived in inner consciousness, while in the case of physical phenomena only external perception is possible\u201d (PES, 70) [\u201cda\u00df sie nur in innerem Bewu\u00dftsein wahrgenommen werden, w\u00e4hrend bei den physischen nur \u00e4u\u00dfere Wahrnehmung m\u00f6glich ist.\u201d (PES 128)]. According to Brentano, the former of these two forms of perception provides an unmistakable evidence for what is true. Since the German word for perception (Wahrnehmung), literally translated, means \u201ctaking-true\u201d, Brentano says that it is the only kind of perception in a strict sense. He points out that inner perception must not be mixed up with inner observation, which would require that one is having a mental act, the act of observing, that is directed towards another mental act, the act observed. Inner perception, on the other hand, must not be conceived as a full-fledged act that accompanies another mental act towards which it is directed. It is rather interwoven with the latter: in addition to being primarily directed towards an object, every mental act is incidentally directed towards itself as a secondary object. When I see a tree, for example, the primary object of my visual experience is the tree. But I am also aware that I am seeing and not, say, hearing or touching the tree; I am, in other words, aware of the fact that I have a mental phenomenon that is directed towards the tree. This is possible because one and the same mental phenomenon, my visual experience, is directed not only towards its primary object, the tree, it is incidentally directed also towards itself as a secondary object.\n\n\u201cThe presentation of the sound and the presentation of the presentation of the sound form one single mental phenomenon; it is only by considering it in its relation to two different objects, one of which is a physical phenomenon and the other a mental phenomenon, that we divide it conceptually into two presentations. In the same mental phenomenon in which the sound is present to our minds we simultaneously apprehend the mental phenomenon itself. What is more, we apprehend it in accordance with its dual nature insofar as it has the sound as content within it, and insofar as it has itself as content at the same time.\u201d (PES, 98)\n\n[\u201cDie Vorstellung des Tones und die Vorstellung von der Vorstellung des Tones bilden nicht mehr als ein einziges psychisches Ph\u00e4nomen, das wir nur, indem wir es in seiner Beziehung auf zwei verschiedene Objekte, deren eines ein physisches, und deren anderes ein psychisches Ph\u00e4nomen ist, betrachten, begrifflich in zwei Vorstellungen zergliederten. In demselben psychischen Ph\u00e4nomen, in welchem der Ton vorgestellt wird, erfassen wir zugleich das psychische Ph\u00e4nomen selbst, und zwar nach seiner doppelten Eigent\u00fcmlichkeit, insofern es als Inhalt den Ton in sich hat, und insofern es zugleich sich selbst als Inhalt gegenw\u00e4rtig ist.\u201d (PES, 179)]\n\nAccording to Brentano, every mental phenomenon is directed towards itself as a secondary object; inner perception is, thus, a form of mechanism on the basis of which we become aware of our own mental phenomena.\n\nAs a consequence, Brentano denies the idea that there could be unconscious mental acts: since every mental act is incidentally directed towards itself as a secondary object, we are automatically aware of every occurring mental act. He admits, however, that we can have mental acts of various degrees of intensity. In addition, he holds that the degree of intensity with which the object is presented is equal to the degree of intensity in which the secondary object, i.e., the act itself, is presented. Consequently, if we have a mental act of a very low intensity, our inner perception of the act or, as he puts it, our secondary consciousness of it will also have a very low intensity. From this Brentano concludes that sometimes we are inclined to say that we had an unconscious mental phenomenon when actually we had a conscious mental phenomenon of very low intensity.\n\nConsciousness, Brentano argues, always forms a unity. While we can perceive a number of physical phenomena at one and the same time, we can only perceive one mental phenomenon at a specific point in time. When we seem to have more than one mental act at a time, like when we are listening to a melody while tasting a sip of red wine and enjoying the beautiful view from the window, all these mental phenomena melt into one, they become moments or, to stick with Brentano\u2019s terminology, divisives of a collective. If one of the divisives ends in the course of time, e.g., when I swallow the wine and turn my eyes to the fireplace, but continue to listen to the music, the collective goes on to exist. Brentano\u2019s views on the unity of consciousness entail that inner observation, as explained above, is strictly impossible, for this would require us to have two distinct acts in the very same moment. Of course it is possible to remember another mental act one had a moment ago, or expect future mental acts, but due to the unity of consciousness one cannot have two distinct mental acts, one of which being directed towards the other, at the same time.\n\nThe fact that we can be directed towards one and the same object in different ways allows Brentano to introduce a classification of mental phenomena. He distinguishes three basic kinds: presentations, judgments, and emotions (which he refers to as \u201cphenomena of love and hate\u201d). These are not three completely distinct classes, though. Presentations are the most basic kind of acts; we have a presentation each time when we are directed towards an object, be it that we are imagining, seeing, remembering, or expecting it, etc. In his Psychology Brentano held that two presentations can differ only in the object, towards which they are directed. Later he modified his position, though, and argued that they can also differ in various modes, such as temporal modes (cf. PES 217 [This text is part of the appendix to the second part of PES from 1911 \u2013 for the German original cf. PES, vol II, 142]). The two other categories, judgments and phenomena of love and hate, are based on presentations. In a judgment we accept or deny the existence of the presented object. A judgment, thus, is a presentation plus a qualitative mode of acceptance or denial. The third category, which Brentano names \u201cphenomena of love and hate,\u201d comprises emotions, feelings, desires and acts of will. In these acts we have positive or negative feelings or attitudes towards an object.\n\nBrentano\u2019s tripartition of mental phenomena is a basic element of his theory that remained central for his whole life. The fact that he saw himself constrained to make minor adjustments shows that Brentano did approach philosophy in a very systematic manner and always had the bigger picture in mind. It can, thus, be taken as evidence that \u201cin his mind Brentano was continuously refining and chiseling away at a unified system, a system that harmonized and stabilized the bits and pieces in his messy literary state\u201d (Kriegel 2017a, 29).\n\nMoreover, his conception of secondary consciousness, in combination with this thesis of the unity of consciousness have had a strong echo in the philosophy of mind, in particular in the recent debate concerning the nature of consciousness. It has been suggested that Brentano\u2019s notion of secondary consciousness (i.e., the thesis that every mental phenomenon is incidentally directed also towards itself as a secondary object) can provide the means to overcome higher-order theories of consciousness that have been widely discussed in the late twentieth century. In this debate, the exact reading of Brentano\u2019s thesis was often at stake. Some philosophers have suggested that Brentano\u2019s view, according to which every mental phenomenon is object of inner perception, was an early expression of a higher-order perception theory of consciousness (cf., for example, G\u00fczeldere 1997, 789). This interpretation, however, does not pay due attention to the fact that according to Brentano, inner perception is not a self-standing mental phenomenon of a higher level, but rather a structural moment of every mental phenomenon. Moreover, with his unity of consciousness thesis Brentano explicitly rejects the basic assumption of all higher-order perception theories of consciousness, i.e., the idea that we can have two mental phenomena (of distinct levels) at the same time, one of them being directed towards the other: higher-order perception theories postulate what Brentano calls \u2018inner observation\u2019 (as opposed to inner perception), which according to him was impossible, as we have seen above.\n\nAccordingly, a number of recent interpreters have suggested that Brentano was an advocate of a one-level account of consciousness: \u201cSince the features that make an act conscious are firmly located within the act itself rather than bestowed on it by a second act, this locates Brentano\u2019s view as a one-level view of consciousness\u201d (Thomasson, 2000, 192). This reading has given place to neo-Brentanian theories such as Thomasson\u2019s adverbial account (cf. Thomasson 2000) or self-representational approaches (cf., for example, Kriegel 2003a, b) that build on the thesis that \u201cevery conscious state has a dual representational content. Its main content is the normal content commonly attributed to mental representations. But it also has a (rather peripheral) special content, namely, its own occurrence\u201d (Kriegel 2003a, 480), which they take as Brentano\u2019s central thesis. Moreover, Kriegel suggests that for Brentano this self-representational aspect is a necessary condition for having a presentation (Kriegel 2013).\n\nOther interprets have taken more cautious lines. Mark Textor (2006), for example, has stressed the ties between Brentano\u2019s notion of secondary consciousness and his thesis of the unity of consciousness. A mental phenomenon, according to Textor\u2019s interpretation of Brentano\u2019s theory, does not become conscious by representing itself, but rather by its being unified or fused with an immediately evident cognition of it. Dan Zahavi, on the other hand, has insisted that Brentano does distinguish two levels of perception, which sheds doubts on the one-level interpretation: \u201cIt could be argued that Brentano\u2019s claim that every conscious intentional state takes two objects, a primary (external) object and secondary (internal) object, remains committed to a higher-order account of consciousness; it simply postulates it as being implicitly contained in every conscious state\u201d (Zahavi, 2006, 5). In short, Brentano\u2019s distinction between primary and secondary consciousness \u201cintroduces some kind of level-distinction into the structure of experience\u201d (Brandl 2013, 61) but does not conceive of higher-perception as a full-fledged mental phenomenon at its own, which is why Brandl has recently proposed to regard it a \u2018one-and-a-half-level theory\u2019 (Brandl 2013, 61f).\n\nWhile the debate concerning the exact interpretation of his views concerning secondary consciousness is still open, it underlines the relevance of Brentano\u2019s contributions to contemporary philosophy of mind.\n\nBrentano is probably best known for having introduced the notion of intentionality to contemporary philosophy. He first characterizes this notion with the following words, which have become the classical, albeit not completely unambiguous formulation of the intentionality thesis:\n\n\u201cEvery mental phenomenon is characterized by what the Scholastics of the Middle Ages called the intentional (or mental) inexistence of an object, and what we might call, though not wholly unambiguously, reference to a content, direction toward an object (which is not to be understood here as meaning a thing), or immanent objectivity. Every mental phenomenon includes something as object within itself...\u201d (Brentano PES, 68)\n\n[\u201cJedes psychische Ph\u00e4nomen ist durch das charakterisiert, was die Scholastiker des Mittelalters die intentionale (auch wohl mentale) Inexistenz eines Gegenstandes genannt haben, und was wir, obwohl mit nicht ganz unzweideutigen Ausdr\u00fccken, die Beziehung auf einen Inhalt, die Richtung auf ein Objekt (worunter hier nicht eine Realit\u00e4t zu verstehen ist), oder die immanente Gegenst\u00e4ndlichkeit nennen w\u00fcrden. Jedes enth\u00e4lt etwas als Objekt in sich\u2026\u201d (Brentano, PES 124f)]\n\nThis quotation must be understood in context: in this passage, Brentano aims at providing one (of six) criteria to distinguish mental from physical phenomena with the aim to define the subject matter of scientific psychology \u2013 and not to develop a systematic account of intentionality. The passage clearly suggests, however, that the intentional object towards which we are directed is part of the psychological act. It is something mental rather than physical. Brentano, thus, seems to advocate a form of immanentism, according to which the intentional object is \u201cin the head,\u201d as it were. Some Brentano scholars have recently argued that this immanent reading of the intentionality thesis is too strong. In the light of other texts by Brentano from the same period they argue that he distinguishes between intentional correlate and object, and that the existence of the latter does not depend on our being directed towards it.\n\nWhen Brentano\u2019s students took up his notion of intentionality to develop more systematic accounts, they often criticized it for its unclarity regarding the ontological status of the intentional object: if the intentional object is part of the act, it was argued, we are faced with a duplication of the object. Next to the real, physical object, which is perceived, remembered, thought of, etc., we have a mental, intentional object, towards which the act is actually directed. Thus, when I think about the city of Paris, I am actually thinking of a mental object that is part of my act of thinking, and not about the actual city. This view leads to obvious difficulties, the most disastrous of which is that two persons can never be directed towards one and the same object.\n\nIf we try to resolve the problem by taking the intentional object to be identical with the real object, on the other hand, we face the difficulty of explaining how we can have mental phenomena that are directed towards non-existing objects such as Hamlet, the golden mountain, or a round square. Like my thinking about the city of Paris, all these acts are intentionally directed towards an object, with the difference, however, that their objects do not really exist.\n\nBrentano\u2019s initial formulation of the intentionality-thesis does not address these problems concerning the ontological status of the intentional object. The first attempt of Brentano\u2019s students to overcome these difficulties was made by Twardowski, who distinguished between content and object of the act, the former of which is immanent to the act, the latter not (cf. Twardowski 1977). This distinction strongly influenced other members of the Brentano School, mainly the two students for who the notion of intentionality had the most central place, Meinong and Husserl.\n\nMeinong\u2019s theory of objects can best be understood as a reaction to the ontological difficulties in Brentano\u2019s account. Rather than accepting the notion of an immanent content, Meinong argues that the intentional relation is always a relation between the mental act and an object. In some cases the intentional object does not exist, but even in these cases there is an object external to the mental act towards which we are directed. According to Meinong, even non-existent objects are in some sense real. Since we can be intentionally directed towards them, they must subsist (bestehen). Not all subsisting objects exist; some of them cannot even exist for they are logically impossible, such as round squares (cf. Meinong 1981). The notion of intentionality played a central role also in Husserlian phenomenology. Applying his method of the phenomenological reduction, however, Husserl addresses the problem of directedness with his notion of \u2018noema\u2019 as intentional correlate of the act (for a more detailed discussion, cf. the entry on Husserl).\n\nBrentano was not very fond of his students\u2019 attempts to resolve these difficulties, mainly because he rejected their underlying ontological assumptions. He was quick to point out that he never intended the intentional object to be immanent to the act. Brentano thought that this interpretation of his position was obviously absurd, for it would be \u201cparadoxical to the extreme to say that a man promises to marry an ens rationis and fulfills his promise by marrying a real person\u201d (PES, 299). In later texts, he therefore suggested to see intentionality as an exceptional form of relation. A mental act does not stand in an ordinary relation to an object, but in a quasi-relation (Relativliches). For a relation to exist, both relata have to exist. A person a is taller than another person b, for example, only if both a and b exist (and a is, in fact, taller than b). This does not hold for the intentional quasi-relation, Brentano suggests. A mental phenomenon can stand in a quasi-relation to an object independently of whether it exists or not. Mental acts, thus, can stand in a quasi-relation to existing objects like the city of Paris as well as non-existing objects like the Golden Mountain. Brentano\u2019s later account, which is closely related to his later metaphysics, especially to his turn towards reism, i.e., the view that only individual objects exist, can hardly be considered a solution of the problem of the ontological status of the intentional object. He rather introduces a new term to reformulate the difficulties.\n\nAccording to Brentano\u2019s thesis of the unity of consciousness, we can have only one mental phenomenon at a time. Next to this synchronic unity, however, there is also a diachronic unity of consciousness: my present mental phenomenon and the one I had just a moment or a few minutes ago form a unity as well. This becomes particularly evident when we consider cases in which we are intentionally directed towards temporally extended objects such as melodies, movies, or goals in a soccer game.\n\nBrentano regards time as a continuum of which only one point, the present moment, is real. As a consequence, mental phenomena do not have temporal extension (very much like like mathematical points on a line). The question, now, is: how can mental phenomena, which do not have any temporal extension, be directed towards objects that are extended in time? Can we be directed towards the melody, or only towards a (very small) temporal part of it? Brentano solves this problem by arguing that the object of a presentation does not vanish immediately from consciousness in the moment the presentation is over, it is rather retained in consciousness for a short while. In order to explain this process, he introduces the notion of \u201coriginal association\u201d or \u201cproteraesthesis\u201d, which, as de Warren suggests, \u201coccupies a notable place in the list of Brentano\u2019s conceptual innovations; in contrast to other distinguishing concepts of descriptive psychology ... it is without precedence in the history of philosophy\u201d (De Warren 2009, 57f).\n\nBrentano has reflected on time consciousness throughout his life, but has never given a systematic exposition of his position that would give it a static form. Rather, he has changed his position several times, often to accommodate it to changes in his overall views. Based on the testimonies of his students and manuscripts contained in the Nachlass, we can distinguish different phases of Brentano\u2019s views on time-consciousness (cf. Fr\u00e9chette 2017).\n\nAccording to his early view, time consciousness depends on the mode of judgment. I can be intentionally directed towards a past object if I judge (correctly) that, say, \u201cCaesar was stabbed on the Ides of March, 44 B.C.\u201d. The reason for characterising temporal differences as modes of judgments is probably the fact that in language we express these temporal differences with the tense of the verb (past, present, future) \u2013 but the verb also serves to express our accepting or denying the existence of an object in a judgment.\n\nIn his second phase, which he held from the early 1870s to the early 1890s, Brentano introduced the notion of original association. A mental phenomenon does not disappear from consciousness from one moment to another, it is rather retained for a short period of time. When I hear a melody a, b, c, d, for example, I first hear a. When, in a second moment, I hear b, a still persists in my consciousness, but is modified as \u201cpast\u201d. When, another moment later, I hear c, both b and a are retained in original association; now also b is given as \u201cpast\u201d, while a is \u201cpushed back\u201d even further into the past, as it were, etc. In this way, Brentano can explain how the melody (as a whole) can be the intentional object of a mental phenomenon: in each moment, the present and the (very) recent tones are given, but the latter are not given in the same way (or else we would not hear a melody, but we would hear all the tones at once; we would, in other words, not hear a melody, but a cacophony). The tones that are past are given with temporal modifications \u2013 which do not further determine them, but rather modify their ontological status from real to not real. In this period Brentano holds that two presentations can differ only in the object towards which they are directed; the continuously changing temporal moment, thus, is a modification of the objects. An object that sinks back into the past undergoes, according to this view, continuous modifications.\n\nIn the early 1890s Brentano modifies his views again, suggesting that the temporal modification is not a modification of the content, but of the attitude of acknowledgement in judgments. With this change, Brentano avoids problems of his earlier view: he no longer needs to suggest that temporal modifications are parts of the intentional objects that are given in original associations, nor does he need to explain how the real, present object can form a continuum with the past objects that are not real.\n\nIn later years, Brentano makes further changes to his theory of time-consciousness. Since temporal modifications can be observed also in mental phenomena that do not contain a judgment (for example when one imagines vividly hearing a melody), he gives up his view that two presentations can differ only in their intentional object and allows for modes of presentation \u2013 such as temporal modes. Finally, in a late manuscript that was dictated in 1915, Brentano introduces another minor modification of his theory, suggesting that past objects can be presented only in modo obliquo, while present objects are presented in modo recto.\n\nBrentano\u2019s reflections on time-consciousness illustrate very well his way of doing philosophy, but also the way in which his views have had an influence on others. As Oskar Kraus notes in his Recollections (cf. Kraus 1919, 39), Brentano has vividly engaged with the problem of time and the origins of time consciousness throughout his life. He presented it several times to students in class and discussed i in letters with colleagues at different moments in time. He never presented a systematic exposition of his views in publication, though. As a result, Brentano\u2019s views on the topic were very dynamic, as he did not hesitate to revise them when he encountered problems or when changes in other parts of his overall theory made it necessary. As he never published a systematic statement of his views on time-consciousness, interested scholars could learn about it only from the expositions of Brentano\u2019s students like Carl Stumpf, Anton Marty, and in particular Edmund Husserl who, however, used Brentano\u2019s views as departing point for their own reflections, very often in an attempt to overcome the difficulties inherent to the version of Brentano\u2019s theory they were acquainted with. Brentano\u2019s own views were, thus, very influential, but risked to become eclipsed by the contributions of his students, who further developed them.\n\nAccording to Brentano, psychology plays a central role in the sciences; he considers especially logics, ethics, and aesthetics as practical disciplines that depend on psychology as their theoretical foundation. He collocates these three disciplines in his larger systematic outlook by tying them to the three kinds of mental phenomenon: presentations, judgments, and phenomena of love and hate, i.e., emotions. The \u201ctriad of the Beautiful, the True, and the Good ... [is] related to the three aspects of our mental life\u201d (PES, 203). Moreover, the three disciplines essentially build on his views that presentations are intrinsically valuable and that not only judgments, but also emotions can be correct or not correct.\n\nLogic, according to Brentano, is the practical discipline that is concerned with judgments; i.e. with the class of mental phenomena in which we take a positive or a negative stance towards the (existence of the) object by affirming or denying it. In addition, judgments are correct or not; they have a truth-value. According to Brentano, a judgment is true when it is evident, i.e., when one perceives (in inner perception that is directed towards the judgment) that one judges with evidence. Brentano, thus, rejects the correspondence theory of truth, suggesting that \u201ca person judges truly, if and only if, his judgment agrees with the judgment he would make if we were to judge with evidence\u201d (Chisholm 1986, 38). Notwithstanding this dependence on the notion of judgment, however, truth, for Brentano, is not a subjective notion: if one person affirms an object and another person denies the same object, only one of them judges correctly. (For a more detailed discussion of Brentano\u2019s contributions to logic, cf. the entry Brentano\u2019s Theory of Judgement.)\n\nEthics, on the other hand, is concerned with emotions or, as Brentano calls them, phenomena of love and hate. Brentano sees a structural analogy between judgments and phenomena of this class: just like judgments, that are either affirmative or negative, also emotions consist in taking a positive or a negative (emotional) attitude towards an object: love or hate, inclination and disinclination, being pleased and being displeased, etc. Moreover, just as (positive and negative) judgments can be correct or incorrect, Brentano holds that also (both positive and negative) emotions can be correct or incorrect. An emotion is correct, according to Brentano, \u201cwhen one\u2019s feelings are adequate to their object \u2014 adequate in the sense of being appropriate, suitable, or fitting\u201d (ORW, 70). [\u201cWer richtig liebt und ha\u00dft, dessen Gem\u00fct verh\u00e4lt sich den Gegenst\u00e4nden ad\u00e4quat, d.h. es verh\u00e4lt sich konvenient, passend, entsprechend\u201d (USE, 76)]\n\nIf it is correct to love an object, we can say that it is good; if it is correct to hate it, it is bad:\n\n\u201cWe call a thing true when the affirmation relating to it is correct. We call a thing good when the love relating to it is correct. In the broadest sense of the term, the good is that which is worthy of love, that which can be loved with a love that is correct.\u201d (ORW, 18)\n\n[\u201cWir nennen etwas Wahr, wenn die darauf bez\u00fcgliche Anerkennung richtig ist. Wir nennen etwas gut, wenn die darauf bez\u00fcgliche Liebe richtig ist. Das mit richtiger Liebe zu Liebende, das Liebenswerte, ist das Gute im weitesten Sinne des Wortes.\u201d (USE 17)]\n\nNot any experience of pleasure is taken into consideration, one needs some sort of evidence that the pleasure is correct. Brentano characterizes the relevant form of pleasure with the following words: \u201cit is a pleasure of the highest form; it is thus the analogue of something being evident in the sphere of judgment\u201d (ORW, 22) [\u201cEs ist ein Gefallen von jener h\u00f6heren Form die das Analogon ist von der Evidenz auf dem Gebiet des Urteils\u201d (USE 21)]. In this way Brentano avoids a subjectivist position. While it is true that correct pleasure is an emotion experienced by subjects, it is impossible that one person can evidently and correctly love an object and another correctly and evidently hate it. In some cases, pleasure or love might be misguided by our prejudices, instincts or habits.\n\nBrentano presented his reflections on ethics in a lecture in 1889. The manuscript was published as a short monograph in the same year, an English translation had appeared as early as 1902 and was, for a long time, the only text by Brentano available in English. This might explain why Brentano\u2019s views on ethics have received more attention in English speaking countries than in central Europe. In particular, Brentano\u2019s basic insight that moral and aesthetic value are related to attitudes we take towards objects and that these latter attitudes can be correct or incorrect, have had a revival in recent years, as it has inspired fitting attitude theories of value.\n\nAesthetics, finally, is based on the most basic class of mental phenomena: on presentations. According to Brentano, every presentation is in itself of value; this holds even for those that become the basis of a correct, negative judgment or emotion.\n\n\u201cEvery presentation, taken by itself, is a good and recognizable as such, since an emotion that is characterized as being correct can be directed towards it. It is out of question that everyone, if they had to choose between a state of unconsciousness and the having of any presentation whatsoever, would welcome even the poorest presentation and would not envy lifeless objects. Every presentation appears of value in that it constitutes a valuable enrichment of life.\u201d (GA, 144 [my translation])\n\n[\u201cJedes Vorstellen ist aber, an und f\u00fcr sich betrachtet, ein Gut und als solches erkennbar, weil sich eine als richtig charakterisierte Gem\u00fctst\u00e4tigkeit darauf richten kann. Ohne Frage w\u00fcrde jedermann, wenn er zwischen dem Zustand der Bewu\u00dftlosigkeit und dem Besitz irgendwelcher Vorstellungen zu w\u00e4hlen h\u00e4tte, auch die \u00e4rmlichste begr\u00fc\u00dfen und die leblosen Dinge nicht beneiden. Jede Vorstellung erscheint als eine Bereicherung des Lebens von Wert.\u201d (GA, 144)]\n\nThus, while judgments and emotions consist in taking either a positive or a negative stance, the value of a presentation is always positive, but comes in degrees: some presentations are of higher value than others. Not every presentations is of particular aesthetic value, though; in order to be so, it has to become the object of an emotion in which one correctly takes a positive stance towards it. In short, according to Brentano, an object is beautiful if a presentation that is directed at it arouses a correct, positive emotion, i.e., a form of pleasure; it is ugly, on the other hand, if a presentation that is directed at it arouses a correct, negative emotion, a form of displeasure.\n\nLike secondary qualities, the aesthetic value is not an intrinsic property of the object but rather depends on the way we experience it. We tend to attribute beauty to the objects of experience, but strictly speaking, the experienced objects are neither beautiful nor ugly:\n\n\u201cWhen we call a girl beautiful, the term is used in a figurative sense. It is similar when we call objects that are outside of us green, red, warm, cold, sweet, bitter. All these expressions refer initially to what appears, and are then also transferred to that which possibly evokes in us this appearance by having an impact on us.\u201d (GA 123 [my translation])\n\n[\u201cWenn wir ein M\u00e4dchen sch\u00f6n nennen, so wird der Name in \u00fcbertragenem Sinn gebraucht. Es ist \u00e4hnlich, wie wenn wir K\u00f6rper, die au\u00dfer uns sind, gr\u00fcn, rot, warm, kalt, hei\u00df, biter nennen. Alle diese Ausdr\u00fccke bezeichnen zun\u00e4chst das, was erscheint, werden dann auch auf solches \u00fcbertragen, was unter Umst\u00e4nden auf uns einwirkend diese Erscheinungen hervorruft.\u201d (GA 123)]\n\nEven though Brentano\u2019s views on ethics and aesthetics are somewhat sketchy and not worked out in detail, we can note that his treatment of the three practical disciplines of logics, ethics, and aesthetics are unified by a common principle: the idea that judgments or emotions not only can be positive or negative, they can also be fitting or appropriate to their object. Moreover, by tying the three disciplines to his tripartition of mental phenomena (presentations, judgments, emotions), he also assigns them an exact collocation in his overall philosophical system. For these reasons, recent commentators have insisted in the systematicity of Brentano\u2019s philosophy, arguing that he \u201cwas the last philosopher to have offered a system in the sense of a structurally unified account of the true, the good, and the beautiful.\u201d (Kriegel 2017a, 29). Kriegel acknowledges, however, that \u201cBrentano was not a systematic writer\u201d (ibid., 21). This shows in the fact that Brentano saw his task mainly in sketching the basic views on aesthetics and ethics in lectures, but never presented a longer or systematic treatise of these topics, which can be explained by his conviction that science was a collective enterprise and by his aversion of the cult of the genius that was widespread in his times. Brentano probably hoped that others would continue to work out the details within the parameters he had set. We know about his views on aesthetics and ethics only from lecture notes that have been cut, revised, and amended by his students, who typically did not bother to document their substantial editorial changes in the published text. Moreover, Brentano never presented his philosophical position as a system, probably because he did not want to be associated with German system philosophers of the early and mid-nineteenth century. Thus, the claim that Brentano was a system-philosopher is somewhat questionable, though he definitely was a systematic thinker in the sense that he always kept the overall picture in mind when working on a specific problem.\n\nThe discussion of Brentano\u2019s views on logic, ethics and aesthetics shows that his philosophy has strong psychologistic tendencies. Whether or not one is to conclude that he does adopt a form of psychologism depends on the exact definition of the latter term: Brentano vehemently rejects the charge of psychologism, which he takes to stand for a subjectivist and anthropocentric position. At the same time, however, he explicitly defends the claim that psychology is the theoretical science on which practical disciplines of logic, ethics, and aesthetics are based. In LW he explicitly notes that, like all other philosophical disciplines, also aesthetics is rooted in psychology and continues: \u201cAnd similarly one could show for aesthetics and any other philosophical discipline that separated from psychology it would have to wither like a branch that is detached from the trunk.\u201d (LW, 39 [my translation]) [\u201cUnd \u00e4hnlich lie\u00dfe sich f\u00fcr die Aesthetik und jede andere Disciplin der Philosophie aufs leichteste nachweisen, da\u00df sie, losgetrennt von der Psychologie, wie ein vom Stamm losgetrennter Zweig verdorren m\u00fcsste.\u201d] Hence, Brentano does adopt the form of psychologism Husserl seems to have had in mind in the Prolegomena to his Logical Investigations, where he defines logical psychologism as a position according to which:\n\n\u2026 [T]he essential theoretical foundations of logic lie in psychology, in whose field those propositions belong \u2014 as far as their theoretical content is concerned \u2014 which give logic its characteristic pattern. \u2026 Often people talk as if psychology provided the sole, sufficient, theoretical foundation for logical psychology (Husserl 2001, 40).\n\n[Die wesentlichen theoretischen Fundamente liegen in der Psychologie; in deren Gebiet geh\u00f6ren ihrem theoretischen Gehalt nach die S\u00e4tze, die der Logik ihr charakteristisches Gepr\u00e4ge geben. \u2026 Ja nicht selten spricht man so, als g\u00e4be die Psychologie das alleinige und ausreichende theoretische Fundament f\u00fcr die logische Kunstlehre. (Husserl, 1900, 51)]\n\nBrentano\u2019s tendency to offer psychological explanations is shown also in his approach to the history of philosophy, in particular in his explanations of the mechanisms that explain the historical development in this discipline. In his text The Four Phases of Philosophy and Its Current State (1998) he defended the metaphilosophical thesis that progress in philosophy can be explained according to principles of cultural psychology. According to Brentano, philosophical progress takes place in circles. He divides the whole history of philosophy in three periods (ancient, medieval, and modern philosophy), each of which can, according to him, be subdivided in four phases. The first is a creative phase of renewal and ascending development; the other three are phases of decline, dominated by a turn towards practical interests, by scepticism, and finally by mysticism. After the fourth phase, a new period begins with a creative phase of renewal.\n\nBrentano has presented his model to a larger audience quite late in his life, but he had come up with it very early in his career; Carl Stumpf reports that Brentano first came up with this idea in 1860 and that he used it in his lectures on the history of philosophy already in W\u00fcrzburg in the mid-sixties (cf. Stumpf 1919, 89f). While both the historical accuracy of and the principles of cultural psychology that gave rise to the model can be put in question (cf. Gilson 1976), it definitely tells the reader much about Brentano\u2019s conception of philosophy and his vivid interest in its history. Brentano\u2019s short text can, thus, best be read as a simplifying narrative that allows the author to explain his conviction that philosophy ought to pursue of pure, theoretical interests and to express his fascination for philosophers like Aristotle, Thomas, or Descartes as well as his dislike of Plotinus, Nicolas of Cues, Kant, Hegel, and Schelling.\n\nEven though Brentano worked on problems in metaphysics and ontology throughout his life, he hardly published on these topics during his lifetime. The impact of his views is due to the fact that from his early lectures at the University of W\u00fcrzburg on he discussed them with his students, both in class and (especially in later years) in correspondence.\n\nEven though Brentano\u2019s views have underwent considerable changes over the years, his general attitude can be characterized as sober, parsimonious, and (in the current use of the term) nominalistic; at no point did he admit the existence of universals, he rather relied on mereological principles to account for classical problems in ontology.\n\nBrentano\u2019s early metaphysics, which is the result of his critical reading of Aristotle, is a form of conceptualism. He does distinguish between substance and accidents, but argues that both are but fictions cum fundamentum in re. With this, he wants to suggest that they do not have actual existence, but that we can make judgments about real things that are correct and contain references to substances and accidents. This view is closely connected to his epistemic notion of truth, according to which the question of whether a judgment is true does not depend on its corresponding to reality, but rather on whether it can be judged with evidence. Brentano elucidates the relation between a thing and its properties on the basis of the mereological notions of \u201clogical part\u201d and \u201cmetaphysical part,\u201d the former of which account for abstract, repeatable properties, the latter for the concrete properties of a thing. Both are not considered to be denizens of reality in a narrow sense, but rather fictions that have a foundation in reality. (For a reconstruction and discussion of the details of Brentano\u2019s early ontology, cf. Chrudzimski 2004).\n\nAfter the introduction of the notion of intentionality in his Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint (1874), Brentano struggled to account for the ontological status of the intentional object. When he first introduces the notion, suggesting, as we have seen above, that \u201c[e]very mental phenomenon includes something as object within itself\u201d (PES, 88), he seems to be interested primarily in presenting a psychological thesis and does not seem to be overly worried with its ontological implications; at this point, the talk of an \u201cimmanent object\u201d might have been a mere fa\u00e7on de parler(cf. Chrudzimski and Smith, 2003, 205). Soon Brentano finds himself in the need, however, to address this question and, as a result, to enrich the domain of objects in his ontology. He seems to admit that next to concrete things there are irrealia, that is, objects that to not really exist but have the status of thought-objects or, as he puts it, entia rationis, that do not have an essence and do not stand in causal relations. Brentano does not systematically elaborate his ontological position in this period, we rather find a bundle of ideas of which he did not seem to be fully convinced. This underlines that the formulation of these views was not made with the intention to make a contribution to ontology, but rather to reply to concerns that have emerged from his introduction of the notion of intentionality.\n\nIn his late philosophy, from 1904 on, Brentano rediscovers the virtue of ontological parsimony and takes up the main insights of his conceptualist period, developing (and radicalizing) them to a form of reism, according to which the only items that exist are individual things (res). \u201cWhile young Brentano tried to ontologically play down certain ways of speaking, late Brentano tried to eliminate them from philosophical discourse\u201d (Chrudzimski 2004, 177) [my translation. \u201cDer junge Brentano versuchte gewisse Redeweisen ontologisch zu bagatellisieren, der sp\u00e4te Brentano versuchte sie aus dem philosophischen Diskurs zu eliminieren\u201d] . He abandons the notion of irrealia, which he now regards as linguistic fictions, and continues to deny the existence of universals or abstract entities. Instead, he conceives both substances and accidents as real things that are related to one another by a particular mereological relation: an accident does not only ontologically depend on the substance, it also contains the substance as a part without, however, containing any supplementary part. A white table, accordingly, is an accident that contains the table as a part. If we were to paint it red, the white table would cease to exist and the red table would come into existence \u2013 the continuity between the two being guaranteed by the table, which was part of the white table and is now part of the red table.\n\nBrentano\u2019s ontology is known to a broader audience only through posthumously published works that were edited by his late students Oskar Kraus and Alfred Kastil, who considered his late position most important and accordingly put less emphasis on Brentano\u2019s earlier phases. Only recently the development of Brentano\u2019s views on ontology has gained more attention, mainly through the work of scholars who were able to study unpublished manuscripts in the archives (cf., for example, Chrudzimski 2004). This underlines once more the need of a critical edition of Brentano\u2019s entire Nachlass, which would make it possible for a broader audience to critically assess the development of Brentano\u2019s views in ontology.\n\nBrentano\u2019s contributions to philosophy were widely discussed among philosophers and psychologists at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century. Moreover, he had a strong impact on an impressive number of students who became famous philosophers on their own right. Often, these philosophers are referred to as the \u201cSchool of Franz Brentano,\u201d (cf. Albertazzi e.al. 1996) in order to underline that all of them drew explicitly (and when not explicitly, then recognizably) on Brentano\u2019s work. All members of the school have become acquainted with Brentano\u2019s philosophy in his lectures or through conversation or correspondence with him, but they form a quite heterogeneous group that did not make attempts to jointly develop a shared position: there was no general acceptance of a specific unifying doctrine of the \u201cSchool\u201d, nor did its members make attempts to unite forces and cooperate on specific projects. What unites the School is a vivid interests in the topics that Brentano discussed in his lectures, first and foremost in psychology and in the idea that philosophy should adopt a rigorous, scientific method (cf. Dewalque 2017a, b). In fact, it was Brentano\u2019s methodological maxim that has raised the interest in most members of the school in the first place, cf., for example, Stumpf (1919) and Husserl (1919), both of who suggest that Brentano\u2019s conception of philosophy as a rigorous science had a decisive impact on their decision to pursue a professional career in philosophy.\n\nBrentano\u2019s influence on students has seen different phases that are loosely connected to the places where he taught. In his early years in W\u00fcrzburg (1866\u20131873), Brentano became noted mainly for his attempt to renew philosophy on the basis of a rigorous, scientific method. His most important students at the time, Carl Stumpf and Anton Marty, made a significant academic career in their own right. As Brentano was not yet appointed professor and could, in consequence, not yet supervise PhD theses, both completed their PhD with Lotze in G\u00f6ttingen. Stumpf then held positions in Prague, Halle, Munich, and Berlin, where he founded a psychological laboratory and gave decisive impulses for the development of Gestalt psychology. Anton Marty became professor at the University of Prague and had a strong influence with his work on the philosophy of language. Both Stumpf and Marty developed their own positions and deviated locally from Brentano\u2019s views, but they remained faithful followers who continued to acknowledge the influence that Brentano has had on them.\n\nWhen Brentano took up teaching at the University of Vienna in 1874, his lectures soon became very popular among students. In the first years, Thomas Masaryk (who later became the first president of the Czechoslovakia), Alexius Meinong, Alois H\u00f6fler, and Christian von Ehrenfels attended Brentano\u2019s lectures. In the years after 1880 (when Brentano had lost his chair and was teaching as Privatdozent, which meant that he could no longer supervise PhD theses) Franz Hillebrand, Edmund Husserl, and Kazimierz Twardowski studied with him. Unlike Stumpf or Marty, Brentano\u2019s students in Vienna encountered a mature professor who had his opus maximum already published. Their relation to Brentano, in consequence, was less that of a friendship, and more that between a student and a renowned professor. Soon many of them have felt the urge to overcome Brentano\u2019s influence and define their own, independent philosophical position \u2013 and possibly form a school in their own right. In particular Meinong and Husserl, who are probably the most famous representants of Brentano\u2019s school, came to have a rather troublesome relation to their former teacher. It is not by accident that both used the term \u201cBrentano School\u201d only to distance themselves from it.\n\nIn 1895, when Brentano gave up his position as Privatdozent in Vienna and moved to Florence, he gave up teaching and could no longer exert a direct influence on students. In this period, the center of the Brentano school moved to Prague, where Anton Marty held regular meetings with interested students, among them Oskar Kraus and Alfred Kastil. These second-generation members of the Brentano school \u2013 who are often called \u201cBrentanoten\u201d or \u201corthodox Brentanists\u201d \u2013 stayed very faithful to Brentano\u2019s philosophy, (in particular to his last, reistic phase that they knew first-hand). They saw it as their main task to preserve Brentano\u2019s view and to defend them against the developments introduced by Husserl and the early phenomenologists as well as those introduced by Meinong and other members of the Graz School, respectively. After Brentano\u2019s death in 1917, they tried to set up and archive for Brentano\u2019s Nachlass and publish texts from it posthumously. While in the first years they achieved considerable results, not at least due to the help of the Czech president Jan Masaryk, the German invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938 forced them into emigration and so brought an end to the Brentano School.\n\nBrentano\u2019s impact in a larger philosophical audience was soon eclipsed by that of his students who founded philosophical traditions on their own: Husserl started the phenomenological movement, Meinong the Graz school, Twardowski the Lvov-Warsaw School. As a result, in the second half of the twentieth century Brentano was often mentioned as the philosopher who had (re-)introduced the notion of intentionality, as \u201cgrandfather\u201d of the phenomenological movement, or for his influence on early analytic philosophy, but his own philosophical views and arguments were hardly discussed.\n\nThere are notable exceptions to this tendency, though. Roderick Chisholm, for example, made a continuous effort to show Brentano\u2019s significance to contemporary philosophy by adopting his results in his own contributions to the philosophy of mind, but also in presentations of various aspects of Brentano\u2019s thought (cf. Chisholm 1966, 1982, and 1986). Moreover, in recent decades the tradition that is often referred to as \u201cAustrian philosophy\u201d has gained increasing interest in a broader philosophical audience, which is due mainly to the work of Rudolf Haller, Barry Smith, Peter Simons, and Kevin Mulligan, among others. By showing the systematic relevance of Brentano\u2019s (and other Austrian philosophers\u2019) contributions to problems discussed in ontology, logic, the theory of emotions, or consciousness, they could counteract the tendency to reduce Brentano\u2019s contributions to the introduction of the notion of intentionality.\n\nIt is quite interesting to note, however, that in the last two decades the philosophical contributions of Brentano have gained a new life as an increasing number of philosophers from different fields are rediscovering and elaborating on different themes from Brentano\u2019s work. His contributions to the philosophy of mind have been taken up and play a central role in the debate concerning the nature of consciousness and the relation between consciousness and intentionality, the unity of consciousness and time-consciousness; his views on ethics have been inspired fitting attitude theories of value, which analyze ethical value in terms of correct or incorrect forms of approval or disapproval. Moreover, the recent centenary of Brentano\u2019s death (2017) has given occasion to a number of conferences and publications that put Brentano\u2019s contribution at the center of attention (cf., for example, Kriegel 2017). This shows that the interest in Brentano\u2019s systematic contribution to philosophy is still strong and vivid."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Franz-Brentano", "page_content": "Franz Brentano, in full Franz Clemens Brentano, (born January 16, 1838, Marienberg, Hesse-Nassau [Germany]\u2014died March 17, 1917, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland), German philosopher generally regarded as the founder of act psychology, or intentionalism, which concerns itself with the acts of the mind rather than with the contents of the mind. He was a nephew of the poet Clemens Brentano.\n\nBrentano was ordained a Roman Catholic priest (1864) and was appointed Privatdozent (unsalaried lecturer) in philosophy (1866) and professor (1872) at the University of W\u00fcrzburg. Religious doubts, exacerbated by the doctrine of papal infallibility (1870), led to his resignation from his post and the priesthood (1873).\n\nBritannica Quiz Philosophy 101\n\nBrentano then began writing one of his best-known and most influential works, Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkte (1874; \u201cPsychology from an Empirical Standpoint\u201d), in which he tried to present a systematic psychology that would be a science of the soul.\n\nConcerned with mental processes, or acts, he revived and modernized the scholastic philosophical theory of \u201cintentional existence,\u201d or, as he called it, \u201cimmanent objectivity\u201d; in psychical phenomena, he held, there is a \u201cdirection of the mind to an object\u201d (e.g., one sees something). The object seen is said to \u201cinexist\u201d within the act of seeing or to have \u201cimmanent objectivity.\u201d He suggested that, fundamentally, the mind can refer to objects by perception and ideation, including sensing and imagining; by judgment, including acts of acknowledgment, rejection, and recall; and by loving or hating, which take into account desires, intentions, wishes, and feelings. The ideas expressed in the Psychologie formed the credo of his followers and became the starting point of their work.\n\nIn 1874 Brentano was appointed professor at the University of Vienna. His decision to marry in 1880 was blocked by Austrian authorities, who refused to accept his resignation from the priesthood and, considering him still a cleric, denied him permission to marry. He was forced to resign his professorship, and he moved with his wife to Leipzig. The following year he was allowed to return to the University of Vienna as a Privatdozent, and he remained there until 1895. He enjoyed wide popularity with his students, among whom were psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, psychologist Carl Stumpf, philosopher Edmund Husserl, and Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk, the founder of modern Czechoslovakia. Another major work of Brentano\u2019s, Untersuchungen zur Sinnespsychologie (\u201cInquiry into Sense Psychology\u201d), appeared in 1907. Completing his early masterwork was Von der Klassifikation der psychischen Ph\u00e4nomene (1911; \u201cOn the Classification of Psychological Phenomena\u201d)."}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-022-01744-1", "page_content": "Before turning to the substance of this paper, here are a few words on the significance and role of Kazimierz Twardowski in the continuation of Brentano's thought. According to the authors of the previously mentioned article, \u201cBrentano had a number of important students (\u2026) The so-called Brentano School influenced scholars such as Christian von Ehrenfels, Edmund Husserl, Alexius Meinong, Sigmund Freud, Martin Heidegger, Rudolf Steiner and Carl Stumpf\u201d (Meyer et al., 2018, p. 247). Clearly, Twardowski was not counted here among his students, although\u2014as many other researchers confirm\u2014he indisputably belonged to this group. Moreover, he was one of the most creative continuators of his thought. \u201cBrentano\u2019s impact (\u2026) was soon eclipsed by that of his students (\u2026) Husserl started the phenomenological movement, Meinong the Graz school, Twardowski the Lvov-Warsaw School\u201d (Huemer, 2019). \u201cTwardowski arrived in Lvov with the intention of spreading Brentano\u2019s ideas on Polish soil (\u2026) The influence of Brentano on the Lvov-Warsaw School was all-pervading as far as metaphilosophical ideals such as rationality and scientifically oriented precision and clarity of style\u201d (Betti, 2017, p. 338; Rollinger, 2008).\n\nAccording to Anna Bro\u017cek, a Polish researcher of Twardowski's school, when analysing Rudolf Carnap's meeting with Twardowski's pupils (including Alfred Tarski) in 1930 in Warsaw, she writes: \u201cThe main, or perhaps even the only, centres of Brentano psychology at that time were Warsaw and Lvov, rather than Vienna, where Brentano taught\u201d (Bro\u017cek, 2021, p. 208; cf. Brandl & Wole\u0144ski, 1999; Chrudzimski & \u0141ukasiewicz, 2006).\n\nThis surprising exclusion of Twardowski in the first quotation is due to a very simple reason: the philosophical tradition of his school has found a permanent place in the philosophy of both Poland and the whole world (Bro\u017cek et al., 2015, 2021; Garrido & Wybraniec-Skardowska, 2018; Kijania-Placek & Wolenski, 1998), while the psychological tradition has done so only recently (Bobryk, 2014, 2016; Citlak, 2016, 2019; P\u0142otka, 2019, 2020; Rzepa & Stachowski, 1993; Rzepa, 2019). It remains a subject of discussion among Polish psychologists as to why this occurred so belatedly and why it is one of the most incomprehensible phenomena in the history of Polish science (Rzepa & Dobroczynski, 2009). The fate of the psychology of Twardowski's school is to some extent a reflection of Brentano's fate in world psychology\u2014he was rather quickly marginalised by the psychology practised in the spirit of Edward Titchener in the USA and Wilhelm Wundt in Leipzig, i.e. physiological and atomistic psychology. Although Brentano's descriptive psychology can be placed in empirical psychology, in other words, based on internal experience and referring to Descartes or Locke, it was not experimental psychology, such as that of Wundt or Fechner. Thus, the achievements of the Viennese philosopher were mainly continued by philosophers (Husserl, Meinong, Marty, Stumpf), all the more so because Psychology from an empirical standpoint (1874) appeared at a time of heated debate on the credibility of philosophy. And, as is well known, it was psychology that was supposed to give it such credibility. Thus, the thought of Brentano\u2014the founder of empirical psychology\u2014has definitely reverberated more widely in philosophy and has only recently experienced a renaissance in consciousness research, as can be seen in the increasing number of publications on the subject as well as in the profile of some scientific journals (e.g. Philosophical Psychology, Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences). Obviously, this does not mean that at the beginning of the twentieth century Brentano's thought was exclusively confined to the field of philosophy. Indeed, the representatives of the Wurzburg School (O. Kulpe, A. Messer, K. Buhler), Gestalt psychology (M. Wertheimer, K. Koffka, W. Kohler) and, above all, the psychology of acts (E. Mach. C. Stumpf, K. Ehrenfels) were also concerned with it. Furthermore, the development of Husserl's phenomenology created new possibilities for the analysis of consciousness by attracting psychologists and philosophers. Whereas K\u00fclpe, Messer and B\u00fchler were keenly interested in combining Husserl's philosophy with empirically oriented psychology, the phenomenologists Alexander Pf\u00e4nder, Moritz Geiger, Max Scheler, to a greater extent than Husserl, tried to integrate empirical psychology with phenomenology.Footnote 2 Unfortunately, the progressive naturalisation of the mind along the lines of the natural sciences, marginalised phenomenological psychology, systematically relegating it to the realm of philosophy.\n\nThe history of the school is publicly available in literature; therefore, only a few important facts will be mentioned. Its beginnings date back to 1895, when Twardowski left the University of Vienna and arrived in Lvov, where he became the Chair of Philosophy at the Jan Kazimierz University. This was one of the two Polish universities (the other being Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w) within the borders of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, in which lectures were delivered in Polish. This was also the time of the partitions, which ended in 1918 when Poland regained its independence after 123 years. The Lvov period (1895\u20131918) was the school's most flourishing period in terms of achievements in the field of psychology, later continued mainly in Warsaw and Pozna\u0144. Whereas the heyday of philosophy and logic was the period 1918\u20131939, as represented by Alfred Tarski, Jan \u0141ukasiewicz, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, Tadeusz Kotarbi\u0144ski and Stanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski. Their achievements in the fields of logic, mathematics, epistemology and semiotics are widely known throughout the world.\n\nThe year 1939 brought irreversible geopolitical and personnel changes.Footnote 3 After the war, the school's activity was further weakened by the pressure of communist authorities, who regarded it as a relic of bourgeois thought (Koczanowicz & Koczanowicz-Dehnel, 2021). During the period of communist rule, the psychology of the school could no longer be reactivated, while the philosophical tradition continued for a long time and remains a strong intellectual formation. Most importantly, however, is that in its beginnings, Twardowski's school was a philosophical school in which psychology played an extremely important role. Many of Twardowski's works (1894/1977, 1910, 1912, 1913) appeared to be philosophical and psychological oriented. His first students were also psychologists who participated in the research or lectures of W. Wundt in Leipzig, the lectures of E. Husserl in G\u00f6ttingen, or the work of C. Stumpf (e.g. W\u0142adys\u0142aw Witwicki, Stefan Baley, Stefan B\u0142achowski, Mieczys\u0142aw Kreutz).\n\nIn 1928, Twardowski wrote: \u201cUntil now, I have performed the tasks of a professor of psychology alongside that of a professor of philosophy\u201d (after Rzepa & Dobroczy\u0144ski, 2009, p. 172). The importance and strong position of psychology was modified after the publication of E. Husserl's Logische Untersuchungen in 1900\u20131901, which rejected psychologism in logical research. Nevertheless, the psychology of acts and descriptive psychology still enjoyed great interest in the Lvov-Warsaw School, especially after Husserl's work opened a new chapter in the study of consciousness, i.e. phenomenology, which many of Twardowski's students were interested in. Lvov and Warsaw were the centres of the continuation of Brentano's thought, with lively discussions on the possibilities of research and reaching the essence of mental phenomena. The key role was to be played by descriptive psychology and the analytical approach. A similar role could be fulfilled by the emerging phenomenology.\n\nThe representatives of the Lvov-Warsaw School\u2014and the Polish philosophical community in general\u2014developed a very early interest in phenomenology. This is rather obvious, firstly because both Husserl and Twardowski derived their beliefs from Brentano's programme (they studied under him in Vienna during a similar period\u2014the former from 1884 to 1886, the latter from 1885 to 1889). Secondly, Husserl's rejection of psychologism had a significant impact on philosophy at Twardowski's school.Footnote 4 Twardowski often sent students to Vienna, G\u00f6ttingen, Berlin or Leipzig for additional philosophical and psychological studies, which provided the school with constant access to current developments in both fields. In world literature, and in Husserl's own view, the representative of his philosophy in Poland was Roman Ingarden, who had already studied in G\u00f6ttingen since 1911 and received his doctorate under the supervision of Husserl in 1918. Ingarden, however, despite his extensive links with Twardowski's school, was not its representative. One of the most prominent psychologists of the Lvov-Warsaw School, Stefan Blachowski, was Twardowski's student, who spent four years studying in G\u00f6ttingen (1909\u20131913). It was there that he studied with Georg Miller, obtained his doctorate under his supervision in 1913, attended lectures on Husserl's phenomenology, and became familiar with the work of David Katz (1884\u20131953), among others. His doctoral thesis (Blachowski, 1913) was written in a similar vein. Another of Twardowski's students interested in Husserl's philosophy was Leopold Blaustein (1905\u20131944?), who, while studying in Lvov, went to study under Husserl for one semester in 1925 in Freiburg. He devoted his dissertation of 1927 to a critical analysis of Husserl's philosophy (Blaustein, 1928), indicating possible modifications to it. After receiving his doctoral degree, he moved to Berlin on Twardowski's recommendation where he attended lectures and established contacts with Carl Stumpf, Max Wertheimer and David Baumgardt. Despite his positive relations with German psychologists and philosophers, Blaustein was fairly critical of their achievements (Glombik, 2005; Jadczak, 1997). As Witold P\u0142otka writes, Twardowski had an enormous impact on the interest in phenomenology in Poland. Among the students who on his recommendation studied in G\u00f6ttingen were Bronislaw Bandrowski (1879\u20131914), who was interested in the use of phenomenology in psychology, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz (1890\u20131963), who studied in G\u00f6ttingen in 1913/1914 and collaborated with Adolf Reinach. The first work on Husserl's philosophy in Polish was presented by \u0141ukasiewicz (1904), one of the most eminent logicians of the school, who was very early to question psychologism in philosophy and logic. W\u0142adys\u0142aw Tatarkiewicz and his publications (Tatarkiewicz, 1913) also played an important role in the reception of phenomenology in Poland. In the later period of the Twardowski School, phenomenology had also attracted the interest of Tadeusz Witwicki (1902\u20131970), Walter Auerbach (1900\u20131942), Simon Igel (1889\u20131942) and the aforementioned L. Blaustein (Plotka, 2017). Briefly, the very beginning of phenomenological thought received a lively response in the Lvov-Warsaw School. It was, on the one hand, a critical reception and, on the other hand, an attempt to use its main assumptions in various areas of epistemology, logic, psychology and aesthetics. Phenomenological reduction, the structure of consciousness, the critique of psychologism and, especially the question of an adequate method for the development of a reliable descriptive psychology, became the key themes of many works by the representatives of the Twardowski school in the first half of the twentieth century (B\u0119ben & Ples-B\u0119ben, 2013; Glombik, 2005). However, while Husserl's anti-psychologism was rather widely accepted and his theory of meaning was polemicised, the attitude towards the transcendental phase of his phenomenology was fairly critical (P\u0142otka, 2019). Unfortunately, the first attempts to use phenomenology were brutally interrupted by the outbreak of the war, as were attempts to develop an original psychological tradition in the study of consciousness.\n\nTwardowski's school, known more widely as the Lvov-Warsaw School, was an important part of the philosophical and psychological milieu in Europe at the beginning of the twentieth century. It could have also joined the widely discussed issues of the subject matter and methodology of psychology, as viewed from Brentano\u2019s perspective, although in actuality, this did not happen. The milestones of European psychology were, thus, set by other schools. The priority was given to the W\u00fcrzburg School, founded by Oswald K\u00fclpe, active until 1909, with its revolutionary achievements in the experimental psychology of thinking (Michel, 2010). A little later came the Gestalt school of psychology, represented by Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka and Wolfgang K\u00f6hler (Wagemans et al., 2012). Less well known today, although very influential at the time in the field of psychology of religion, was also the Dorpat School (now Tartu, Estonia), founded by Karl Girgensohn, who himself was influenced by the W\u00fcrzburg School and Carl Stumpf (a student of Brentano). The research on religious experience and beliefs that began at Dorpat\u2014and continued in Germany and Scandinavia\u2014is a lasting contribution to the psychology of religion worldwide (Pickren & Rutheford, 2010; Wulff, 1985). European psychology of the early twentieth century mainly used experimental introspection in the first-person perspective as the primary source of empirical data. The research of Twardowski\u2019s school was conducted in a similar vein, but the central conceptual category involved Brentano's psychology of acts."}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-016-0825-7", "page_content": "After reviewing the context and Brentano\u2019s own approach, it is now time to sum up and illustrate the potential implications. From today\u2019s perspective, it appears that a century ago, psychology largely abandoned a systematic consideration of the inner world\u2014not because this inner world would be a problematic territory per se, but because it was problematic to study it\u2014that is, it was abandoned due to a methodological insufficiency (the black box metaphor is perhaps the prime indication of this). In turn, the inner world of experiences (which was until the nineteenth century the primary territory of psychological inquiry and mostly researched by philosophers interested in psychological issues) was increasingly seen as an appendix to the physiological realm, with the latter being easier to study and hence more readily accessible. Today, the general understanding is that psychological states and experiences ultimately emanate from physiological processes\u2014an approach that leaves psychology with substantial problems that so far remain as intractable as they were at the time when the physiology-centered view began to dominate psychology (examples are the qualia problem; the mind\u2013body problem).\n\nA more systematic attention to the inner world is necessary and the road in this direction was paved by Franz Brentano. Brentano did acknowledge the in- principle reality of this inner realm and did highlight that it can ultimately only be approached via inward inquiry (resulting in evidence); this was\u2014and is\u2014a step of crucial importance. At the same time, Brentano was an advocate of inner perception, and not of inner observation (i.e., not of an introspective approach in the more original sense of the word). We suspect he did not endorse introspection in the more narrow sense because he observed substantial problems when introspecting on feelings\u2014an observation that we resonate with, but that cannot necessarily be generalized to the observation of thoughts; for observing feelings one requires a crossing of categorical boundaries (we use thoughts to observe something that is not of thought-nature), whereas observing thoughts does not. The other reason why he was skeptical of introspection is that it is conducted post hoc; we likewise agree that this is indeed a problem when post hoc means occurring after an extended time (such as a focusing on inner mental states of childhood experiences during psychoanalysis); when occurring immediately after a mental activity it is surely more precise\u2014and we argue that such immediate form of inner perception can asymptotically reach the state of an ongoing (online) form of observation.\n\nFor a methodologically developed form of introspection, we see a potential to prompt a number of revisions in our understanding of psychological phenomena\u2014in the cognitive domain as well as in other areas. These we identify as follows:\n\n1. In a first step, a more systematic form of inward inquiry is likely to yield a richer and more differentiated picture of the world of inner experiences. A more long-lasting and deliberate attention to psychological phenomena can uncover facets of a phenomenon that are not accessible to the more sporadic and ad hoc nature of incidental introspective inquiry. As an example, consider the case of mindfulness: mindful attention is often described as a form of detachment from the ongoing stream of thoughts that one allows to pass by without getting too involved in it. For instance, Winning & Boag, 2015 characterize mindfulness as the ability \u201cto observe one\u2019s thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations without engaging with them\u201d, p. 492. Even the Toronto Mindfulness Scale, a frequently used scale to measure the state of mindfulness, uses questions that tend to focus on this aspect of detachment (e.g., Question 1: \u201cI experienced myself as separate from my changing thoughts and feelings\u201d; Question 11: \u201cI was aware of my thoughts and feelings without overidentifying with them\u201d (Lau et al., 2006). A more systematic and sustained form of inquiry into the state of sustained attention, by contrast, can reveal different forms of activity during the state of mindfulness; in particular, in addition to the aspect of detachment, another aspect can became noticeable\u2014one of increased engagement with the contents of consciousness; in fact, it becomes clear that aspects of engagement and detachment alternate (e.g., Weger & Wagemann, 2015a). 2. Once we have obtained a richer and more differentiated picture of the inner quality of psychological phenomena, chances increase that we will be more reluctant to dismiss the genuinely psychological nature of experiences as being merely epiphenomenal to the physiological side. As long as we are deeply involved in one aspect\u2014the study of the body\u2014it is easy to lose the other aspect\u2014the study of the qualitative nature of the phenomenon\u2014out of sight. When both aspects are studied in tandem, by contrast, this imbalance is more likely to be resolved: psychological states and physiological processes can be seen as different modes of expression of a phenomenon, rather than seeing one (the psyche) as the causal consequence of the other (the body). 3. We suspect that a further consequence of such increased attention to the world of experiences will be that once both facets are recognized as complementary, the nature of questions that we pursue in psychology will also change. For instance, instead of asking: \u201cHow can the brain produce consciousness or the self or mental experiences, etc.?\u201d it might be less misleading and more constructive to ask: \u201cHow do we need to conceptualize neuronal or physiological processes to better understand how the body can be a platform for conscious or mental phenomena to take place in the way we observe them?\u201d, and likewise: \u201cHow do we need to conceptualize mental phenomena to understand how they impact upon ponderous matter?\u201d After all, physicists have not succeeded any more in addressing the ultimate nature of matter as psychologists have in addressing the ultimate nature of consciousness. As a more specific example, take a quote from the book by the renowned philosopher Thomas Metzinger: \u201cContrary to what most people believe, nobody has ever been or had a self. But it is not just that the modern philosophy of mind and cognitive neuroscience together are about to shatter the myth of the self. It has now become clear that we will never solve the philosophical puzzle of consciousness\u2014that is, how it can arise in the brain which is a purely physical object\u2014if we don\u2019t come to terms with this simple proposition: that to the best of our current knowledge there is no thing, no indivisible entity, that is us, neither in the brain nor in some metaphysical realm beyond this world.\u201d (Metzinger, 2009, p. 1; italicized in original). We would agree with Metzinger if we extended his quote in the following way: \u201cIt has now become clear that we will never solve the philosophical puzzle of consciousness\u201d\u2014and now comes the addition:\u2026with a third-person approach\u2014for then we will always be tempted to grasp an experiential and qualitative reality through the lens of a material process, which is in our view a category mistake (see Weger, Meyer, et al., 2016 for this point). Complementing the third-person view with a first-person approach can open new venues of inquiry that may also change the perspective we take on psychological phenomena.\n\nAs indicated, Brentano himself was not an advocate of introspection in the sense of inner observation as we have begun to outline here. But he proposed introspection in the sense of inner perception which, according to our view, is the central precursor to inner observation and, when further pursued, will naturally reach the latter. Or, to put it more precisely: a systematic form of inner perception can\u2014with sufficient training\u2014gradually and asymptotically reach the capacity of inner observation.\n\nIn terms of concrete application, our proposal would be that researchers actually study a phenomenon introspectively and thereby gain preliminary insights before they start with third-person experimentation. Most academics do so anyway\u2014but this is part of the problem: an unsystematic inner reflection that is not methodologically developed can lead to premature hypotheses and corresponding experimental designs that bias and delay the research process unnecessarily. As an example, Reisberg, Pearson, & Kosslyn (2003) examined the spontaneous introspections and intuitions of researchers involved in the imagery debate. In this debate (which unfolded over several decades), academics were in conflict regarding the view of whether mental images are actual pictures or rather propositional representations. Reisberg et al. report that spontaneous introspections and intuitions did indeed inform the researchers\u2019 theoretical position and their subsequent experimentation. Our view is that with a more systematic inquiry into the nature of mental images, one can overcome the one-sidedness of an immature introspection and can realize the pictorial as well as the propositional components of images\u2014an observation that without doubt would have been fruitful in this debate (cf. also: Weger & Wagemann, 2015a).\n\nBy a methodologically advanced form of introspection, we mean a multiple-step procedure in which the respective phenomenon is addressed in a number of stages (see Weger & Wagemann, 2015a, b; Weger, Meyer et al., 2016): (a) the researcher chooses a mental content as the topic of the introspective trial; (b) she holds it as a content of consciousness for a sustained period of time in concentrated mental focusing and takes note of the forms of mental activity retrospectively; (c) the observations are tested\u2014also taking potential opposite approaches into consideration\u2014at the stage of pursuing multiple (ideally opposing) hypotheses; the reflections on mental activities are repeated\u2014ideally to such an extent that the researcher can formulate a roadmap that other colleagues can pursue to reach the same results; here, first-person and third-person research converge.\n\nWe argue that such introspective inquiry would be particularly useful in the early stages of a theoretical development\u2014in what Hoyningen-Huene (1987) described as the context of discovery. In the subsequent stage, the context of justification, such an introspective approach can then be complemented or replaced by a third-person approach."}, {"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/Archives/spr2004/entries/brentano/", "page_content": "This is a file in the archives of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.\n\nFranz Brentano\n\nAfter graduation Brentano prepared to take his vows; he was ordained a Catholic priest in 1864. Nevertheless he continued his academic career at the University of W\u00fcrzburg, where he presented his Habilitationsschrift on The Psychology of Aristotle in 1867. Despite reservations in the faculty against his priesthood he eventually became full professor in 1873. During this period, however, Brentano struggled more and more with the official doctrine of the Catholic Church, especially with the dogma of Papal infallibility, promulgated at the first Vatican Council in 1870. Shortly after his promotion at the University of W\u00fcrzburg, Brentano withdrew from the priesthood and from his position as professor.\n\nAfter his Habilitation Brentano had started to work on a large scale work on the foundations of psychology which he entitled Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint. The first volume was published in 1874, a second volume (The Classification of Mental Phenomena) followed in 1911, and fragments of the third volume (Sensory and Noetic Consciousness) were published posthumously by Oskar Kraus in 1928.\n\nShortly after the publication of the first volume Brentano took a job as a full professor at the University of Vienna, where he continued a successful teaching career. During his tenure in Vienna Brentano, who was very critical towards his own writing, no longer wrote books but turned instead to publish various lectures. The topics range from The Genius and a series of papers on historiography to The Origin of the Knowledge of Right and Wrong, in which Brentano laid out his views on ethics. The latter was Brentano's first book to be translated into English; the translation was published in 1902.\n\nIn 1880 Brentano planned to get married to Ida von Lieben. He had to face, however, that the laws of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the time did not allow for a wedding of someone who had been ordained priest. Brentano, thus, gave up his Austrian citizenship, which meant that he also had to give up his position at the University of Vienna. He moved temporarily to Saxony, where he finally married. When he came back a few months later, the Austrian authorities did not reassign him his position. Brentano became Privatdozent, a status that allowed him to go on teaching\u2014without receiving any salary, though. For several years he tried in vain to get his position back. In 1895, after the death of his first wife, he left Austria. In 1896 he settled down in Florence where he got married to Emilie Ruprecht in 1897.\n\nBrentano has often been described as an extraordinarily charismatic teacher. Throughout his life he influenced a great number of students, many of who became important philosophers and psychologists in their own rights, such as Edmund Husserl, Alexius Meinong, Christian von Ehrenfels, Anton Marty, Carl Stumpf, Kasimir Twardowski, as well as Sigmund Freud. Many of his students became professors all over the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Marty in Prague, Meinong in Graz, and Twardowski in Lvov, and so spread Brentanianism over the whole Austro-Hungarian Empire. Another of Brentano's students, Tomas Masaryk, was to become founder and first President (from 1918 to 1935) of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, where he created ideal conditions for the study of Brentano's philosophy. These factors explain the central role of Brentano in the philosophical development in Middle-Europe, especially in what was later called the Austrian Tradition in philosophy.\n\nBrentano always emphasized that he meant to teach his students to think critically and in a scientific manner, without holding prejudices and paying undue respect to philosophical schools or traditions. When former students of his took a critical approach to his own work, however, when they criticized some of his doctrines and modified others to adopt them for their own goals, Brentano reacted bitterly. He often refused to discuss criticism, ignored improvements, and thus became more and more isolated, a development that was reinforced by his increasing blindness.\n\nDue to these eye-problems Brentano could not read or write any longer, but had his wife read to him and dictated his work to her. Nonetheless, he produced a number of books in his years in Florence. In 1907 he published Untersuchungen zur Sinnespsychologie, a collection of shorter texts on psychology. In 1911 he presented not only the second volume of his Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint, but also two books on Aristotle: in Aristotle and his World View he provides an outline and interpretation of Aristotle's philosophy. In Aristoteles Lehre vom Ursprung des menschlichen Geistes Brentano continues a debate with Zeller. This debate had started already in the 1860s, when Brentano criticized Zeller's interpretation of Aristotle in his Psychology of Aristotle and became quite intense and aggressive in the seventies and eighties of the nineteenth century.\n\nWhen Italy entered war against Germany and Austria during World War I, Brentano, who felt himself a citizen of all three countries, moved from Florence to neutral Switzerland. He passed away in Zurich on March 17, 1917.\n\nBrentano left a huge number of unpublished manuscripts on a wide range of philosophical topics. After his death, Alfred Kastil and Oskar Kraus, who were students of Brentano's former student Anton Marty in Prague, began to publish posthumously lecture notes, letters, and drafts he had left. They tried to present Brentano's work as best as they could, putting together various texts to what they thought were rounded, convincing works, sometimes following questionable editorial criteria. Their work was continued by other, more careful editors, but has not been completed yet. Moreover, a much needed critical edition of his complete \u0153uvre is still to be waited for.\n\nBrentano's approach, like that of other introspectionist psychologists of the late nineteenth century, was harshly criticized with the uprise of scientific psychology in the tradition of logical positivism, especially by the behaviorists. This should not obscure the fact that Brentano did play a crucial role in the process of psychology becoming an independent science. He distinguished between genetic and empirical or, as he later called it, descriptive psychology, a distinction, which is most explicitly drawn in his Descriptive Psychology. Genetic psychology studies psychological phenomena from a third-person point of view. It involves the use of empirical experiments and thus fulfills the scientific standards we nowadays expect from an empirical science. Even though Brentano never practiced experimental psychology himself, he very actively supported the installation of the first laboratories for experimental psychology in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a development that was continued by his student Alexius Meinong in Graz. Descriptive psychology (to which Brentano sometimes also referred to as \u201cphenomenology\u201d) aims at describing consciousness from a first-person point of view, its goal is to list \u201cfully the basic components out of which everything internally perceived by humans is composed, and by enumerating the ways in which these components can be connected\u201d (Descriptive Psychology , 4). Brentano's distinction between genetic and descriptive psychology strongly influenced Husserl's development of the phenomenological method, especially in its early phases, a development of which Brentano could not approve for it involved the intuition of abstract essences, the existence of which Brentano denied.\n\nAll mental phenomena have in common, Brentano argues, \u201cthat they are only perceived in inner consciousness, while in the case of physical phenomena only external perception is possible\u201d (Psychology, 91). According to Brentano, the former of these two forms of perception provides an unmistakable evidence for what is true. Since the German word for perception (Wahrnehmung ) means literally translated \u201ctaking-true,\u201d Brentano says that it is the only kind of perception in a strict sense. He points out that inner perception must not be mixed up with inner observation, i.e., it must not be conceived as a full-fledged act that accompanies another mental act towards which it is directed. It is rather interwoven with the latter: in addition to being primarily directed towards an object, each act is incidentally directed towards itself as a secondary object. As a consequence, Brentano denies the idea that there could be unconscious mental acts: since every mental act is incidentally directed towards itself as a secondary object, we are automatically aware of every occurring mental act. He admits, however, that we can have mental acts of various degrees of intensity. In addition, he holds that the degree of intensity with which the object is presented is equal to the degree of intensity in which the secondary object, i.e., the act itself, is presented. Consequently, if we have a mental act of a very low intensity, also our secondary consciousness of this act will have a very low intensity. From this Brentano concludes that sometimes we are inclined to say that we had an unconscious mental phenomenon when actually we only had a conscious mental phenomenon of very low intensity.\n\nConsciousness, Brentano argues, always forms a unity. While we can perceive a number of physical phenomena at one and the same time, we can only perceive one mental phenomenon at a specific point in time. When we seem to have more than one mental act at a time, like when we hear a melody while tasting a sip of red wine and enjoying the beautiful view from the window, all these mental phenomena melt into one, they become divisives of a collective. If one of the divisives ends in the course of time, e.g., when I swallow the wine and close my eyes, the collective goes on to exist. Brentano's views on the unity of consciousness entail that inner observation, as explained above, is strictly impossible, i.e., that we cannot have a second act which is directed towards another mental act which it accompanies. One can remember another mental act one had earlier, or expect future mental acts, but due to the unity of consciousness one cannot have two mental acts, one of which being directed towards the other, at the same time.\n\nBrentano points out that we can be directed towards one and the same object in different ways and he accordingly distinguishes three kinds of mental phenomena: presentations, judgments, and phenomena of love and hate. These are not three distinct classes, though. Presentations are the most basic kind of acts; we have a presentation each time when we are directed towards an object, be it that we are imagining, seeing, remembering, or expecting it, etc. In his Psychology Brentano held that two presentations can differ only in the object, towards which they are directed. Later he modified his position, though, and argued that they can also differ in various modes, such as temporal modes. The two other categories, judgments and phenomena of love and hate, are based on presentations. In a judgment we accept or deny the existence of the presented object. A judgment, thus, is a presentation plus a qualitative mode of acceptance or denial. The third category, which Brentano names \u201cphenomena of love and hate,\u201d comprises emotions, feelings, desires and acts of will. In these acts we have positive or negative feelings towards an object.\n\nEvery mental phenomenon is characterized by what the Scholastics of the Middle Ages called the intentional (or mental) inexistence of an object, and what we might call, though not wholly unambiguously, reference to a content, direction toward an object (which is not to be understood here as meaning a thing), or immanent objectivity. Every mental phenomenon includes something as object within itself... (Brentano, Psychology, 88)\n\nThis quotation must be understood in context: Brentano's goal, as we have seen above, was to deliver a further criterion to distinguish mental from physical phenomena, and not to develop a systematic account of intentionality. The passage clearly suggests, however, that the intentional object towards which we are directed is part of the psychological act. It is something mental rather than physical. Brentano, thus, seems to advocate a form of immanentism, according to which the intentional object is \u201cin the head,\u201d as it were. Some Brentano scholars have recently argued that this immanent reading of the intentionality-thesis is too strong. In the light of other texts by Brentano from the same period they argue that he distinguishes between intentional correlate and object, and that the existence of the latter does not depend on our being directed towards it.\n\nIf we try to resolve the problem by taking the intentional object to be identical with the real object, on the other hand, we face the difficulty of explaining how we can have mental phenomena that are directed towards non-existing objects such as Hamlet, the golden mountain, or a round square. Like my thinking about the city of Paris, all these acts are intentionally directed towards an object, with the difference, however, that their objects do not really exist.\n\nBrentano's initial formulation of the intentionality-thesis does not address these problems concerning the ontological status of the intentional object. The first attempt of Brentano's students to overcome these difficulties was made by Twardowski, who distinguished between content and object of the act, the former of which is immanent to the act, the latter not. This distinction strongly influenced other members of the Brentano-School, mainly the two students for who the notion of intentionality had the most central place, Meinong and Husserl.\n\nMeinong's theory of objects can best be understood as a reaction to the ontological difficulties in Brentano's account. Rather than accepting the notion of an immanent content, Meinong argues that the intentional relation is always a relation between the mental act and an object. In some cases the intentional object does not exist, but even in these cases there is an object external to the mental act towards which we are directed. According to Meinong, even non-existent objects are in some sense real. Since we can be intentionally directed towards them, they must subsist (bestehen ). Not all subsisting objects exist; some of them cannot even exist for they are logically impossible, such as round squares. The notion of intentionality played a central role also in Husserlian phenomenology. Applying his method of the phenomenological reduction, however, Husserl addresses the problem of directedness by introducing the notion of \u2018noema,\u2019 which plays a role similar to Frege's notion of \u2018sense.\u2019\n\nBrentano was not very fond of his students' attempts to resolve these difficulties, mainly because he rejected their underlying ontological assumptions. He was quick to point out that he never intended the intentional object to be immanent to the act. Brentano thought that this interpretation of his position was obviously absurd, for it would be \u201cparadoxical to the extreme to say that a man promises to marry an ens rationis and fulfills his promise by marrying a real person\u201d (Psychology, 385). He therefore suggested to see intentionality as an exceptional form of relation. A mental act does not stand in an ordinary relation to an object, but in a quasi-relation (Relativliches). For a relation to exist, both relata have to exist. A person a is taller than another person b, for example, only if both a and b exist (and a is, in fact, taller than b). This does not hold for the intentional quasi-relation, Brentano suggests. A mental phenomenon can stand in a quasi-relation to an object independent of whether it exists or not. Mental acts, thus, can stand in a quasi-relation to existing objects like the city of Paris as well as non-existing objects like the Golden Mountain. Brentano's later account can hardly be considered a solution of the problem of the ontological status of the intentional object. He rather introduces a new term to reformulate the difficulties.\n\nBrentano's account of time-consciousness was very influential on his students, especially on Edmund Husserl, whose notion of \u2018retention\u2019 bears close resemblances to Brentano's notion of \u2018original association.\u2019\n\nBrentano's interest in the history of philosophy is not only reflected by his extensive work on Aristotle, but also by his historiographical considerations. He argued the metaphilosophical thesis that progress in philosophy can be explained according to principles of cultural psychology. In philosophy progress takes place in circles: each philosophical period, Brentano holds, can be subdivided in four phases. The first is a creative phase of renewal and ascending development; the other three are phases of decline, dominated by a turn towards practical interests, by scepticism, and finally by mysticism. After the fourth phase, a new period begins with a creative phase of renewal. With this scheme Brentano succeeds in giving his philosophical preferences an intellectual justification; it allows him to explain his fascination for Aristotle, the Scholastics, and Descartes as well as his dislike of Kant and the German idealists.\n\nBrentano's views on ethics and aesthetics rest on his point that there are three classes of mental phenomena. He argues that there is an analogy between judgments and phenomena of love and hate, i.e., between phenomena of the second and the third class: we can say of phenomena of both classes that they are correct or incorrect. What seems to be quite unproblematic for judgments seems to lead to a quite controversial position in the case of phenomena of love and hate. Brentano, who admits that he has not found an adequate name for phenomena of the third class, understands love and hate in a very broad sense, as positive or negative feeling or emotion towards an object. We might (with Chisholm (1966, 395)) call it \u201cpro-emotions\u201d and \u201canti-emotions\u201d. This theory of correct emotions goes hand in hand with a theory of intrinsic value. According to Brentano, a thing is intrinsically good if it is correct to have pro-emotions and intrinsically bad if one correctly has anti-emotions about it. Also in aesthetics there is a correlation between the aesthetical value of an object and our correctly loving or hating it.\n\nIn addition to the topics discussed, Brentano made important contributions to metaphysics, especially on the relation of substance and accidents, and concerning mereology. He also developed a theory of space, time, and other continua and discussed arguments concerning the existence of God.

H. Brentano was born in Marienberg, Germany in January 16, 1838, to a Catholic family of comfortable means that had a certain degree of political and cultural influence in nineteenth century Germany. He died in Zurich, Switzerland, on March 17, 1917. His life\u2019s work was the affirmation of philosophy as a scientific discipline, and his considerations of philosophy included explicit viewpoints toward psychology.\n\nBrentano\u2019s early philosophical studies were at Aschaffenburg, Munich, W\u00fcrzburg, and Berlin. At Berlin and then at M\u00fcnster, his studies focused on Aristotle. These studies were significant insofar as they laid the foundation for Brentano\u2019s development of the concept of intentionality coming from the scholastic philosophy of the medieval age, which had incorporated the philosophy of Aristotle.\n\nIn 1862, Brentano completed his doctoral dissertation at T\u00fcbingen, \u201cOn the Manifold Sense of Being in Aristotle.\u201d In 1865, Brentano wrote his Habilitationsschrift (a qualifying monograph for academic positions), which was on \u201cThe Psychology of Aristotle, in Particular his Doctrine of the Active Intellect.\u201d Brentano was a philosopher with a more-than-average concern about psychology. In 1866, Brentano publicly defended the theses of his Habilitationsschrift at W\u00fcrzburg, declaring natural science to be the only correct method of philosophy. From 1866 through the early 1870s, Brentano lectured at W\u00fcrzburg. Among Brentano\u2019s students at W\u00fcrzburg were important figures such as Carl Stumpf, Anton Marty, and Antal (Anton) Sch\u00fctz.\n\nIn 1864, Brentano had been ordained a priest. Ordination to the priesthood contributed mightily to the year 1873 as a watershed year in the life of Brentano. In that year, in an ultimate response to the declaration of the doctrine of papal infallibility by Vatican Council I in 1870, Brentano withdrew from the priesthood and resigned from his position at W\u00fcrzburg. In 1874, he was appointed Professor Ordinarius at the University of Vienna. In 1880 with his renouncing his Austrian citizenship in order to marry as a former priest (not recognized under Austrian law at the time), he gave up his Vienna professorship. In that year, Brentano married Ida von Lieben with a son, Johannes, following 8 years after the marriage.\n\nBrentano subsequently returned to the University of Vienna as a Privatdozent. Included in his student roster in his years at Vienna were Edmund Husserl, Kasimir Twardowski, Alexius Meinong, Christian Von Ehrenfels, Alois H\u00f6fler, and Thomas Masaryk, the founder of Czechoslovakia. To be noted is that Sigmund Freud attended some of his lectures. At both W\u00fcrzburg and Vienna Universities, Brentano\u2019s students numbered among the important and distinguished in the history of his time.\n\nIn 1894, Brentano\u2019s wife Ida died. The year after his wife\u2019s death, Brentano retired as Privatdozent at the University of Vienna and decided to leave Austria and to settle in Florence, Italy. He became an Italian citizen (Italy was the origin of his family name). In 1897, he married Emilie Rueprecht. In 1915, he left Italy and moved to Zurich, Switzerland, when Italy entered World War I. He died in Zurich in 1917. His body was later reinterred in a family plot in Aschaffenburg, Germany.\n\nThere is testimony to the personality and character of Franz Brentano. Husserl, for 2 years in attendance at Brentano\u2019s lectures (1884\u20131886) in Vienna and arguably the most famous and most cited of Brentano\u2019s students, recounts how Brentano\u2019s students found him easy to speak with, and how well Brentano knew how to use questions and objections to guide beginning students. Brentano was a player in the Vienna Chess Club, Husserl reports, and was considered a \u201cclever player\u201d by fellow players. He did wood carvings; he painted and drew. Brentano was abstemious; he did not smoke and he ate and drank moderately. Husserl further comments on Brentano\u2019s \u201cchildlike openness and on his childlikeness of genius.\u201d\n\nDespite Brentano\u2019s estrangement from the Catholic Church, Husserl according to his recollections of Brentano never heard him speak of Catholicism without the greatest respect. Brentano was considered to be a pacifist, a citizen of the world. In the context of the era in which Brentano lived, an era of European empire-rivalries and of national chauvinism, this characterization of Brentano certainly stands out as quite noteworthy. Finally, of interest to Husserlian followers and to phenomenological psychologists is Husserl\u2019s claim that Brentano\u2019s example led him to believe philosophy could be scientific and that it was worthwhile for him to leave mathematics and to take up philosophy as his life\u2019s work."}, {"url": "https://study.com/academy/lesson/franz-brentano-psychology-contributions-work.html", "page_content": "Franz Brentano\n\nFranz Brentano was a priest first, a philosopher second, and a psychologist to the last. He was born in present-day Germany to parents who fostered his love of learning. Brentano first entered the university to study the philosophy of Aristotle. He believed the scholastic philosophy Aristotle had championed (in which authoritative teachers expound on their thoughts and beliefs), but he was unsatisfied with the teaching as a simple philosophy. He first wrote a dissertation on the philosophy of Aristotle, but he followed that up with another on his favorite thinker's psychology. From his study of Aristotle's thoughts and methods, Brentano developed his own psychological theories.\n\nContributions to Psychology\n\nAlthough he first entered the priesthood following his days at the university, Brentano quickly became an opponent of the established church when he argued against the infallibility of the pope. Thus, he went back to academia and became an influential professor.\n\nHis primary interest, shared by many of his contemporaries, was to free psychology from the chains of philosophy and make it a singular study. Brentano was one of the first of the new type of psychologist who used empirical methods rather than anecdotal. The difference is that anecdotal evidence is based on opinion whereas empirical evidence is gained through many observations during controlled circumstances in which the observer only reports what is seen and not what the observer thinks about what they have seen.\n\nThrough his empirical method and readings regarding Aristotle, Brentano developed what he called act psychology. He believed that psychology should focus on the mind's outputs, its acts (such as perception, and the outward signs of emotions), rather than on how the inner structures of the mind produced those outputs. He was opposed to the newly formed school of structuralism because he believed that how the mind worked was not within the purview of psychology. The mind was a physical machine whose inner workings were the concern of physicians not psychologists.\n\nIn writing about and researching act psychology, Brentano defined concepts regarding intentionality, perception, and judgment:"}]}
