She was 92.\n\nRae died at her Los Angeles home Sunday with her family at her side, said her publicist, Harlan Boll. A cause of death was not immediately available, but Rae was diagnosed last year with bone cancer after beating pancreatic cancer, Boll said.\n\nShe originated the character of Mrs. Garrett in 1978 during the first season of NBC's comedy \"Diff'rent Strokes,\" then took Mrs. Garrett with her for the spinoff \"Facts,\" which premiered the following season.\n\nInitially set at a girls' boarding school, that NBC series ran for nine seasons. Rae left after its seventh year, however, explaining later, \"I needed some time for the rest of my life.\"\n\nThe \"Facts\" role came to Rae after years of theater and television performances. She earned an Emmy nomination for the part, and she was a two-time Tony nominee for her work on Broadway.\n\nHer last feature film credit was \"Ricki and the Flash\" with Meryl Streep in 2015. That same year she released her autobiography \"The Facts of My Life,\" co-written by her son Larry Strauss.\n\nMindy Cohn and Kim Fields, who played members of Mrs. Garrett's brood, recalled her lovingly.\n\n\"She was my champion, a teacher, a proud example of the tenacity and perseverance needed to live as a creative, along with your talent and gifts. i love you char,\" Cohn, who played Natalie, posted on Instagram.\n\n\"Sorry, no words at the moment just love and tears... and yeah, smiles,\" tweeted Fields, who portrayed Tootie.\n\nTony Award-winning actress Audra McDonald tweeted: \"She was so sweet, funny, wise, lovely, and brilliant. She will be so missed. Rest In Peace Sweet Charlotte Rae.\"\n\nTodd Bridges, who was on \"Diff'rent Strokes,\" said on Twitter that she was beloved by all her colleagues and that the show \"would not have been the same without you.\"\n\nEdna Garrett provided kind if sometimes wry counsel to her \"Facts of Life\" charges (which, besides Cohn and Fields, included Lisa Whelchel, Nancy McKeon and Molly Ringwald) on a series that was praised for dealing with such sensitive issues of teenhood as sex, drug use, eating disorders and peer pressure.\n\n\"I wanted to bring in as much humanity as possible, as well as the humor,\" Rae told The Associated Press early in the show's run. \"I don't want her to be Polly Perfect, because she must have human failings and make mistakes.\"\n\nHer own life was marked by tragedy, Rae told the AP in a 2015 interview. She said the \"most devastating thing\" she faced was her son Andy Strauss' diagnosis of autism at a time when there was far less understanding of or attention to the disorder. Andy died in his mid-40s of a heart attack in 1999.\n\nBorn Charlotte Rae Lubotsky in Milwaukee, on April 22, 1926, she had studied drama at Northwestern University, then moved to New York where, despite early plans to be a \"serious\" actress, she quickly found work doing satirical sketches in Greenwich Village clubs.\n\nIt was there that Broadway producers, who frequented such bistros, discovered her, leading to her first Broadway musical, called \"Three Wishes for Jamie,\" in 1952. A few years later, she originated the role of Mammy Yokum in the Broadway musical \"Li'l Abner.\"\n\nRae made numerous TV appearances in 1950s drama anthologies including \"The U.S. Steel Hour,\" ''Playhouse 90\" and \"Armstrong Circle Theater,\" sharing the black-and-white screen with such actors as Zero Mostel, Art Carney and Gertrude Berg.\n\nIn 1961 she became a semi-regular on the New York-based cop sitcom \"Car 54, Where Are You?\" as the wife of the NYPD officer played by future \"Munsters\" grandpa Al Lewis.\n\nShe received Tony nominations in 1966 for \"Pickwick\" and in 1969 for \"Morning, Noon and Night.\"\n\nIn the early 1970s, Rae moved to Los Angeles with her then-husband, composer and music editor John Strauss, and their sons Andy and Larry. There she was cast in the short-lived Norman Lear sitcom \"Hot L Baltimore\" and a similarly unsuccessful variety show hosted by Rich Little before scoring \"Diff'rent Strokes,\" on which Mrs. Garrett was the family's housekeeper.\n\nRae stayed busy with film and stage appearances, including 1971's \"Bananas\" from Woody Allen and 1979's \"Hair.\" Other credits included the 2008 comedy \"You Don't Mess with the Zohan\" and the 2012 thriller \"Love Sick Love.\"\n\nIn 2005, at age 79, she appeared in a new comedy, \"Leading Ladies,\" at Ford's Theater in Washington.\n\nIn 2013, Rae went public with an account of why her marriage to Strauss had ended in the mid-1970s after a quarter-century. She said he disclosed to her he was bisexual and wanted an open marriage. Strauss died in 2011.\n\nIn addition to son Larry, she is survived by sister Miriam Guten and three grandchildren.\n\nServices were pending, Boll said.\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

She was 92 years old. Rae died Sunday at her Los Angeles home, according to The New York Times. Her death was confirmed by her manager, Paul Hilepo.\n\nRae got her start in the theater, eventually acting on Broadway. However, it\u2019s her television work that made her a household name. She was best known as Edna Garrett, a flame-haired housekeeper to three children on Diff\u2019rent Strokes. She continued the role on the Strokes spin-off, The Facts of Life. In that series, Garrett leaves the house to go care for several teenage girls who attend a private school. The show began airing in 1979; Garrett stuck with it until the eighth season, eventually bowing out due to health problems. In a later interview, she said that she also left because it made sense for the growing girls to see less and less of Mrs. Garrett. In addition, she wanted to focus on other aspects of her life.\n\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d like to go back and do the stage, and travel, and enjoy myself, and do other things, which I did,\u201d she said in 2017. \u201cAnd so I did a crazy thing.\u201d\n\nRae, who was born Charlotte Rae Lubotsky in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1926, began her career in New York City. She cut her teeth on the stage, performing in Broadway plays like The Threepenny Opera and Li\u2019l Abner, later picking up two Tony nominations in 1966 (for best featured actress in a musical in Pickwick) and 1969 (best actress in a play in Morning, Noon and Night).\n\nShe was also notching film and TV appearances, landing a role in the Woody Allen comedy Bananas and TV shows like The Partridge Family and All in the Family. Rae has never been shy about describing the difficulty of being an actor in those days: \u201cBeing an actor is not like any other job. It\u2019s not easy. I felt like a hooker!\u201d she joked in a 2016 interview. \u201cYou never know when your next job is going to come along.\u201d\n\nShe first played Mrs. Garrett, a frank, funny housekeeper with a distinctive bouffant, in 1978 in Diff\u2019rent Strokes. She carried on the role until 1984, going between that show and The Facts of Life. Though the actress left the role behind in the mid-1980s, she kept acting, returning to the stage and turning up in shows like ER and Pretty Little Liars, as well as movies like Ricki and the Flash, acting alongside Meryl Streep.\n\nThe actress was married from 1951 to 1975 to composer and sound editor John Strauss, with whom she often collaborated. They divorced amid respective struggles with alcohol addiction; Strauss also came out as bisexual, and told Rae that he had wanted an open marriage. The divorce was difficult, but they remained \u201cfriends and supported each other until he died\u201d in 2011, Rae said. The pair had two sons, Larry and Andy Strauss; Andy, who had autism, died of a heart attack in his forties. Rae delved into her struggles with Andy, as well as her marriage and struggles with alcohol addiction, in her 2015 memoir, The Facts of My Life, which was co-written with Larry."}, {"url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/charlotte-rae-dead-92-edna-garrett_n_5b67ad5be4b0de86f4a2b79b", "page_content": "Earl Gibson III via Getty Images\n\nActress Charlotte Rae, who was best known as Mrs. Garrett on the hit sitcom \u201cThe Facts of Life,\u201d died Sunday in Los Angeles, her manager confirmed to HuffPost.

Soon-to-be-100-year-old TV legend Norman Lear, appearing with Jimmy Kimmel, who produced the third outing in the Live series, dropped an f-bomb that had to be bleeped. The curse word toward the top of the show seemed to be a staged, though amusing, element.\n\nBefore the main event, Deadline took a peek behind the curtain during Monday night\u2019s rehearsal featuring an all-star cast of new players and plenty of surprise blast-from-the-past guest appearances.\n\nThe night\u2019s star indisputably was Ann Dowd, who pulled double duty on both shows in the role of Edna Garrett. Garrett, originally played by the late Charlotte Rae, was the Drummond family\u2019s housekeeper on Diff\u2019rent Strokes before taking on the new role of housemother at the Eastland School in the spinoff, The Facts of Life.\n\nAnn Dowd and Jon Stewart Christopher Willard/ABC\n\nNot only does Dowd capture Rae\u2019s essence in every scene, she never broke character when cameras stopped rolling. She even earned the approval of the show\u2019s original cast members Lisa Whelchel and Mindy Cohn, who opened Live with their rendition of the Facts of Life theme song. Kim Fields joined Whelchel and Cohn during the live performance but was absent during the rehearsals.\n\nMrs. Garrett didn\u2019t get mad often, but when she does in Live in Front of a Studio Audience \u2014 in the re-telling of the Season 3 episode, \u201cKids Can Be Cruel \u201d \u2014 it proves difficult not to imagine her going all Aunt Lydia on Blair (Jennifer Aniston), Tootie (Gabrielle Union), Jo (Kathryn Hahn), and Natalie (Allison Tolman), who were reprimanded for being mean in a slam book.\n\nTheir cutthroat criticisms mainly were aimed toward Carl \u201cRocky\u201d Price, a shy boy with a mouth full of metal braces played by Jon Stewart. And the ribbing increased when the guys from nearby Bates Academy arrived to help Eastland set up its charity box lunch auction.\n\nBlair\u2019s beau Dink Lockwood and his pal Tim Holyfield really didn\u2019t care for Carl, and Mrs. Garrett wasn\u2019t having any of it. Audiences might remember the actors who played Dink and Tim as they played brothers in Arrested Development: Will Arnett and Jason Bateman. Arnett and Bateman were inseparable even when the cameras ceased recording, a familiarity that comes from all their years of friendship.\n\nNot even a pro like Stewart could keep from breaking character while interacting with the pair, especially as he struggled to enunciate his lines while wearing Rocky\u2019s elaborate headgear.\n\nBut it was dear Carl who emerged as the victor by episode\u2019s end, earning not only lunch with his crush Blair but also the satisfaction of knowing she found him interesting once she got beyond the surface. They don\u2019t ride off into the sunset or anything, but it\u2019s always nice to be reminded not to judge a book by its cover or you might miss out on a gem.\n\nMrs. Garrett headed back to the big city and the Park Avenue apartment she resided in for years for the second half of the show focused on Diff\u2019rent Strokes. The production switch was heralded by a performance of the show\u2019s theme song by Boyz II Men\u2019s Shawn Stockman and Wanya Morris.\n\nBut before Kevin Hart made his big debut as pint-size Arnold Jackson \u2014 in superhero pajamas, no less \u2014 the last surviving main cast member from the original series, Todd Bridges, shared a warm appreciation to fans who continue to show love for their work after so many years while also remembering his series co-stars Rae, Gary Coleman, Conrad Bain, and Dana Plato.\n\nTruth be told, Hart\u2019s performance as the 8-year-old really gave Dowd a run for her top spot. In the reimagination of the Season 1 episode \u201cWillis\u2019 Privacy,\u201d Arnold interacted often with his adoptive father Mr. Drummond (John Lithgow), including the scene-stealing moment he plonks down on Lithgow\u2019s lap that was worthy of a comedy Emmy nomination.\n\nAdding to the height disparity favoring the tall people was the surprise addition of Snoop Dogg in the role of Vernon, Willis\u2019 best friend from Harlem. The pair are working on a photo project together and just can\u2019t seem to get Arnold off their backs long enough to develop photos worthy of excellent marks.\n\nArnold\u2019s constant need for Willis\u2019 affections and the latter\u2019s need for more privacy causes a rift that splits the room in half. But it would take more than a failed photo development to tear these sweet brothers apart.\n\nWoven into the night were remakes of classic \u201980s commercials featuring Jennifer Beals and Alfonso Ribeiro \u2014 a new element that wasn\u2019t part of the first two Live in Front of a Studio Audience specials.\n\nBefore the lights go dark once more, both casts gathered around the Diff\u2019rent Strokes living room to pay homage to legendary producer Norman Lear.\n\nA replay of the special will be available via Hulu on Wednesday.\n\nDade Hayes contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/charlotte-rae-dead-facts-of-life-diffrent-strokes-star-dies-at-92/", "page_content": "Charlotte Rae, who played Edna Garrett on Diff\u2019rent Strokes and Facts of Life died at the age of 92 at her home in Los Angeles on Sunday, August 5, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe Tony-nominated actress, who also played Woody Allen\u2018s mother in the 1971 movie Bananas, revealed in April 2017 that she had was battling bone cancer, seven years after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.\n\n\u201cNow, at the age of 91, I have to make up my mind,\u201d she said in a statement at the time about deciding whether to undergo treatment. \u201cI\u2019m not in any pain right now.

She went on to wish the star \"the happiest of homecomings.\"\n\nYou all already know my heart is heavy yet.... sorry, no words at the moment just love and tears... and yeah, smiles.... #charlotterae #ripcharlotterae \u2014 Kim Fields (@KimVFields) August 6, 2018\n\nHours after tweeting a tribute, Kim Fields, who played Tootie, released a heartfelt statement.\n\n\"Charlotte Rae was an indelible force of spirit and that is what she brought to to every character she portrayed,\" Fields wrote. \"Part of that came from her extensive theater training, most came from her passion for what she loved to do and the greatest part was just simply her light. With an infectious smile and nurturing heart full of kindness and determination, Charlotte generously gave of herself as an artist, a performer and as a friend. Though she was always (and I mean ALWAYS) busy working, she made sure to make time for her family and friends who were to her: treasures. My family and I are blessed to have been one of her treasures.\"\n\nFields added, \"While she will be missed on a level I can't even quantify, I am very happy knowing that she knew how much she was loved. She knew how well the show that SHE was the star of, was regarded. She knew she was a legend. And although she would never use those labels about herself, she knew that she was at the head of something that would impact generations. And her unique gift did. I am happy to know that she got her honors and her 'flowers' while she was still with us. She will be missed more than I could ever say. Rest well, dear friend.\u201d\n\nThank you, Charlotte, for 40 years of friendship and love.

Of the core cast of five, including himself, Rae, Gary Coleman (Arnold), Dana Plato (Kimberly) and Conrad Bain (Phillip Drummond), he's now the lone survivor.\n\nRIP IN PEACE ALL OF MY CAST MATES.

I've had a wonderful one already.\"\n\nAnd it was one that inspired so many others.\n\nCharlotte Rae was an indelible force of spirit and that is what she brought to to every character she portrayed.

The 61-year-old Damon Wayans, meanwhile, will take over for Todd Bridges as Arnold\u2019s older brother Willis.\n\nAddressing the decision to cast Actors of a Certain Age in previously pint-sized parts, executive producer Brent Miller told TVLine, \u201cIt started with Jimmy [Kimmel] and his desire to have Kevin Hart play Arnold Jackson, the Gary Coleman role\u2026. At the time, I didn\u2019t know: Is he going to want to cast everybody old, or is he just going to have the joke be Kevin? But as we started talking through it, it made sense to be consistent with that conceit of having older people play kids.\u201d\n\nAdditional participants enlisted for 90-minute special include Jennifer Aniston, John Lithgow, Kathryn Hahn, Gabrielle Union, Allison Tolman and Ann Dowd \u2014 the latter of whom will appear during both reenactments as Mrs. Garrett.\n\nScroll down to see the A-listers opposite the original stars of both comedies, then hit the comments and tell us who you think was best (and worst) cast."}]}
