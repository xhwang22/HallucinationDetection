After signing with Atlantic Records in 1965, they scored their first No. 1 hit with a cover of the Olympics' \"Good Lovin',\" which was featured on their eponymous 1966 debut album. In 1967 the Rascals released two hit albums \u2014Collections (No. 14) and Groovin' (No. 5), the latter of which featured the No. 1 hit \"Groovin'.\" \"Groovin'\" was inducted into the GRAMMY Hall Of Fame in 1999.

That same year they landed their third No. 1 hit, \"People Got To Be Free,\" which is featured on 1969's Freedom Suite.\n\nFollowing the release of The Island Of Real in 1972, the Rascals disbanded.

The quartet released impeccably performed pop masterpieces that featured soulful singing, and songwriting that captured the essence of the most optimistic elements of 1960s youth culture. Such songs as \"Groovin'\" and \"People Got to Be Free\" escaped the prison of 1960s' cultural artifacts by benefit of the crisp musical arrangements and lack of pretension in the vocal performances, and have become true timeless pop classics that have been labeled as prime examples of \"blue-eyed soul.\"\n\nThe group formed in New York in 1965. Drummer Dino Danelli was a teenage prodigy, having performed with Lionel Hampton and Little Willie John. Keyboardist Felix Cavaliere was a student of classical piano, and the only white member of the Stereos. While he was a student at Syracuse University, Cavaliere formed a doo-wop group known as the Escorts. Cavaliere moved to New York City, where he met Danelli. The duo traveled to Las Vegas to play in a casino house band, and then returned to New York, where Cavaliere accepted a job with \"Peppermint Twist\" singer Joey Dee's band the Starliters. Other members of the Starliters included singer Eddie Brigati and guitarist Gene Cornish. Cavaliere, Danelli, Cornish, and Brigati formed the Young Rascals shortly thereafter, releasing the 1965 single \"I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore,\" which was sung by Brigati. Cavaliere took over lead vocals on the group's follow-up single, \"Good Lovin',\" which was a remake of a song originally recorded by the Olympics. The song became one of the biggest hits of 1966. The early recordings of the Rascals were produced by future Eric Clapton and Allman Brothers' producer Tom Dowd. With Dowd, the group created a raucous, driving sound that emphasized Cavaliere's Hammond organ playing and rhythm-and-blues-influenced vocals. The group never hired a full-time bass player, relying instead on session and pickup players for studio and live performances.\n\nDespite the band's American popularity, they were unable to crack the European market until the release of the 1967 single \"Groovin.'\" The song featured another classic Cavaliere vocal, but with a more jazz-influenced musical backing assisted by Atlantic Records producer Arif Mardin. By now known as the Rascals, the group registered other hits in 1967 with \"How Can I Be Sure\" and \"Beautiful Morning.\" In Rock: The Rough Guide, critic Richie Unterberger assessed the group's string of hits: \"All had a light, beautifully serene grace, perhaps reflecting Cavaliere's increasing infatuation with Eastern mysticism in general, and guru Swami Satchinanda in particular. This was soul music of a new sort, equal parts white and black, driven as much by soul-searching concerns as by romantic ones.\"\n\nThe year 1967 was to be the band's creative peak. The following year they released another stellar single, \"People Got to Be Free,\" but alienated some audiences with a 1969 double album that featured the song Freedom Suite. Written by Cavaliere and Brigati, \"People Got to Be Free\" was reportedly inspired by the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy. The group did their best to emulate the social politics of King and Kennedy by insisting that they share all their billed performances with a black group. The move resulted in the band playing few if any dates in the South.\n\n\"People Got to Be Free\" was the group's last hit single, as they began to focus on integrating jazz improvisers such as Alice Coltrane and Ron Carter on their subsequent recordings. Critics generally dismissed these efforts as pretentious. See, released in 1970, led critic Lenny Kaye to ponder whether the group wasn't better off recording singles rather than full-length albums. \"Given the space of an entire album, the group seems to founder about, coming up with material that is in some cases good, but more often simply innocuous,\" wrote Kaye in Rolling Stone. The group employed such Eastern instruments as sitars and tablas to accompany the songs, which Kaye disparaged as \"quasi-mystical \u2026 reflecting itself in lyrics full of Significance and Cosmic Wonder.\" When the band stuck to their tried-and-true formula for rhythm-and-blues inflected pop, however, Kaye found them at the top of their game: \"Both 'See' and 'Carry Me Back' rock like mad, spurred by the frenetically tight drumming of Dino Danelli and carried by those soaring voices that once sat solidly behind Joey Dee and the Starlighters.\" Kaye praised the songs as \"full of fire and topped with a pair of great lyrics,\" and as \"easily the equal of anything the Rascals have yet done, which is to say that they're very good indeed.\"\n\nFor the group's other 1970 release, Search and Nearness, they recruited the help of jazz artists Hubert Laws, Joe Farrell, and Ron Carter. The group left Atlantic Records and signed with Columbia. Before their label debut, however, Brigati left the group in 1970, and Cornish quit the following year. Cavaliere and Danelli recruited Buzzy Feiten from the Butterfield Blues Band, session player Robert Popwell, and singer Ann Sutton. The latter lineup left no music of lasting value, however, and Cavaliere and Brigati folded the Rascals' tent in 1972.\n\nIn 1988 Cornish, Cavaliere, and Danelli reunited for a tour that ended in acrimony, and in 1989 Cornish and Danelli sued Cavaliere to prohibit him from touring using the Rascals' name. The judge ruled that Cornish and Danelli could tour as the New Rascals, and that Cavaliere could promote his concert appearances as a former member of the Young Rascals. Through the years the various members of the band have surfaced in different projects. In the 1970s Cornish and Danelli were in the groups Bulldog and Fotomaker; the latter with Wally Bryson of the Raspberries. Brigati toured and recorded with his brother David, and the brothers were featured in the 1991 New York Rock and Soul Revue with Steely Dan member Donald Fagen. Cavaliere toured for a season with Ringo Starr's All-Starr Band.

From 1965 through 1969, The Rascals were one of the best-selling groups on the pop charts scoring such classic chart entries as \"How Can I Be Sure,\" \"Good Lovin',\" \"A Beautiful Morning,\" \"I've Been Lonely Too Long,\" \"Groovin',\" and \"People Got to Be Free.\" These hits were marked by such a distinctive mix of R&B and rock, and romance and social consciousness, that in 1997, The Rascals were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nFelix Cavaliere was born in Westchester County, New York. His parents noting musical talent at an early age enrolled him in The Allaire School of Music where he studied classical piano and composition. Felix went to Syracuse University where he majored in Pre Med with a minor in music. Starting a band there, he was offered a record deal with a label in the area and released a single, that he penned called, \"The Syracuse\" which became a campus hit. After a brief stint in the Catskills, he was asked to join Joey Dee's Starliters on a' European tour.\n\nIn 1965, Felix formed The Young Rascals with Eddie Brigati, Dino' Danelli and Gene Cornish. Felix and Eddie were to become the band's primary songwriters and lead singers. All in all they went on to co write seven albums together.

One of America\u2019s most successful acts of the 1960s, the group recorded classics including \u201cGood Lovin\u2019,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve Been Lonely Too Long,\u201d \u201cGroovin\u2019,\u201d \u201cHow Can I Be Sure,\u201d \u201cA Girl Like You,\u201d \u201cA Beautiful Morning,\u201d and \u201cPeople Got To Be Free.\u201d\n\nThis achievement is commemorated in the band\u2019s new box set, The Complete Singles A\u2019s and B\u2019s \u2013 47 tracks collecting for the first time both sides of every Atlantic and Columbia release, with early songs in both stereo and mono.\n\n\u201cWe called those the \u2018money mixes\u2019 \u2013 made for AM radio to be heard through one speaker,\u201d Cornish said of the latter. \u201cThe stereo mixes were taken from the original master multi-tracks, so they couldn\u2019t be remixed\u2026 which is a blessing because flexing with magic is not an improvement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t one night we didn\u2019t kill onstage \u2013 we never once went out there and phoned it in.\u201d\n\nIn his years with the The Rascals, Cornish played 36 Gibson guitars, though, \u201cGibson never gave me a pick.\u201d For the past 15 years, he has referred to his Fernandes with Fender Noiseless pickups and D\u2019Addario strings as \u201cmy workhorse.\u201d Others in his collection include a Stratocaster with Joe Barden pickups, a Telecaster, and several D\u2019Angelicos including an Excel SS, Excel Madison, and Premier EXL-1. His current amplifiers include a Fender Hot Rod Deville with four 10\u2033 speakers, a Supro Rhythm King with a 15\u2033, and Fender Blues Deville with four 10s.\n\nIn 2013, Rascals superfan Steven Van Zandt managed to reunite the band for a Broadway show and tour called Once Upon Dream. When it ended, members went their separate ways.\n\nCornish, a survivor of two quadruple-bypass heart surgeries and colon cancer, still tears it up onstage with Rascals tribute shows. He\u2019s also member of a The Platinum All-Stars with drummer Carmine Appice (Vanilla Fudge, Jeff Beck), keyboardist Geoff Downes (Buggles, Asia, Yes), Ron \u201cBumblefoot\u201d Thal (Guns \u2019N Roses), singer/guitarist Phil Naro (Brian May, Peter Chris), and bassist Rudy Sarzo (Ozzy Osborne, Whitesnake).\n\nWhat are your earliest memories of moving to America?\n\nIn the early \u201950s, if you were from another country, you might as well have been from Mars. Kids were not as sophisticated, and they beat me up all the time because my name was spelled \u201cJean-Paul.\u201d I told my mom, \u201cI\u2019m not speaking French any more,\u201d and changed the spelling of my name to Gene, like Gene Autry. My dad bought me a little ukulele, and the first proper song I learned was \u201cSinging The Blues,\u201d by Guy Mitchell.\n\nWhat was your first exposure to American rock and roll?\n\nIn February of \u201956, I was at my dad\u2019s bait store, where there was an old black-and-white television on a shelf. I looked up and there was this guy with sideburns playing a guitar, another guitarist behind him and a drummer. It was Elvis with Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana. I turned up the volume, and that was all it took for me.\n\nBecause your mom had sung with Ozzie Nelson\u2019s big band, did you meet Ricky in those days?\n\nNo, not until around \u201968. But I used to watch \u201cThe Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\u201d all the time, and I loved [Ricky\u2019s guitarist] James Burton. \u201cBelieve What You Say\u201d is, to me, the ultimate guitar solo. James always played \u2013 actually mimed with \u2013 a Rickenbacker on the show because Ricky had an endorsement deal, but of course he played a Telecaster on the records.\n\nWho were some of your other early influences?\n\nWell, Chuck Berry, and because of Duane Eddy I bought my Gretsch 6120. I loved \u201cWalk Don\u2019t Run\u201d by The Ventures, which I still play in shows. Bobby Rydell was one of my idols; I was 15 when his first hit, \u201cKissin\u2019 Time,\u201d came out. The bass was so predominant that I talked my father into buying me a Fender bass. So, I was a double threat as guitarist and bass player on the early Rascals\u2019 records.\n\nAlong with 70 million other people in America, you saw The Beatles\u2019 appearance on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show\u201d in February, 1964. How did that affect you?\n\nThe Beatles changed my life and that of virtually every other guitar player because guitar used to be in the back of a band while the singer was up-front. All of a sudden, the bass player was also the lead singer. I had never seen that. It was just magic.\n\nDid seeing George Harrison playing a Country Gentleman inspire you to get one?\n\nYes, I did buy one because of him, but it got stolen before The Rascals\u2019 first rehearsal. I was playing a different Gretsch when I realized, \u201cGeorge has his guitar, McCartney has the H\u00f6fner violin bass, Buddy Holly had the Stratocaster\u2026 I gotta find my own guitar.\u201d I found it in a Gibson Barney Kessel, a double-cutaway jazz guitar, and used it on all my records.\n\nThe Rascals were unknown when you attended the Beatles\u2019 Shea Stadium concert in 1965, and promoter Sid Bernstein had the scoreboard flash the words, \u201cThe Rascals Are Coming.\u201d\n\nWe had just signed with Sid as manager about three weeks earlier, and were in the visitors\u2019 dugout, where The Beatles came out. When (Beatles\u2019 manager) Brian Epstein saw the sign, he had a f***ing fit and started screaming, \u201cI\u2019m gonna cancel the show right now if you don\u2019t take that sign down!\u201d That was our first brush with The Beatles (laughs).\n\nWhat\u2019s the story behind the Rascals turning down Phil Spector\u2019s offer to produce at a time when the band was still playing small clubs?\n\nWe were at The Barge, in the Hamptons. Phil had flown from L.A. to see us play. We knocked him out. When he came backstage afterward and told us he wanted to produce us, we were in shock. Felix, who was more educated and more worldly than any of us, told Phil, \u201cYou\u2019re the greatest producer in the world, but we want to produce ourselves.\u201d Phil said, \u201cDo you know who you\u2019re talking to?\u201d We said, \u201cYes, but we have our own ideas.\u201d He stormed out so frustrated that he kicked a fire hydrant and broke his foot.\n\nDid you ever run into him after that?\n\nYes. Seven months later, we had the #1 record with \u201cGood Lovin\u2019\u201d and were at Cantor\u2019s Deli in L.A., laughin\u2019 and talkin\u2019 at four in the morning, when Phil walked in with this huge bodyguard who looked like Odd Job in the James Bond films. We all dove under the table! Phil was still walking with a cane, and he came over, tapped on the table with the cane and started yelling, \u201cGet up here, you little c***suckers! You all got some balls. Nobody has ever turned down Phil Spector!\u201d Then he looked me in the face and started laughing, \u201cYou guys were right. I\u2019m proud of you. You did good.\u201d\n\nYou also had a pre-fame encounter with Les Paul, who had one of the few eight-track recorders in \u201965.\n\nWe were brought to his house late one evening and recorded a few songs \u2013 The Beatles\u2019 \u201cNo Reply\u201d and \u201cSlow Down.\u201d But we were still fresh, not ready to be recording artists.\n\nThe Rascals turned down several major labels before signing with Atlantic. What made the band realize it was their best option?\n\nThere were several reasons. Columbia was bigger, RCA was bigger, Capitol was bigger. They all wanted us, but they were just corporations who would have thrown us into the studio with staff producers and we would\u2019ve had no say about how the music was recorded. Atlantic, on the other hand, was the most respected label. They were the top black label long before Motown, and we were going to be their first white act. They said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have as much money as CBS, RCA, or Capitol, but if you come with us, we can get into the rock-and-roll world.\u201d That was a real invitation for an unknown act that didn\u2019t even have original songs at the time.\n\nSo, considering Atlantic\u2019s history with legends such as Ray Charles, The Drifters, and The Coasters, how intimidating was it being in their studios the first time?\n\nWell, at first we couldn\u2019t believe that they said we could produce ourselves, and also that they wouldn\u2019t charge us for studio time, which is the way many record companies recoup investments. But they said, \u201cSince you don\u2019t have a track record, we\u2019ll let you be your own producers, with some adult supervision. \u201dThat meant Tom Dowd, who worked with Aretha Franklin, Cream, Allman Brothers, and other acts, and Arif Mardin, who was Atlantic\u2019s house arranger. We were really blessed to have two of the best help us along. They never demanded or tried to control anything \u2013 they just made suggestions.\n\nWhat was your basic equipment during the Rascals days?\n\nI started with the Barney Kessel and used the same Standel amp in the studio and onstage so my sound would be consistent. I then went to a Gibson Byrdland, then a Les Paul, which was too heavy \u2013 I actually herniated a disc in my neck because of it before switching to an SG Standard. I did own one Stratocaster later on, which you can hear on \u201cSee.\u201d\n\nDid you use effects on any of the recordings?\n\nOnly on one song \u2013 the beginning chord of the solo on \u201cCome On Up\u201d uses a Sam Ash Fuzzz Boxx.\n\nHow did the band come upon \u201cGood Lovin\u2019\u2019\u2019 and what\u2019s the story behind your iconic riff on that song?\n\nFelix and Dino went to Harlem one day with a copy of Billboard, and on the \u201cBubbling Under\u201d chart was \u201cGood Lovin\u2019\u201d by The Olympics. We knew these records weren\u2019t going to get a fair chance on the pop stations, so we covered it. Basically, my guitar part was the piano part on their record. The very first time I played it was on the record, sliding the notes rather than playing straight quarter notes. I used that same style on the riff for \u201cYou Better Run.\u201d\n\nBesides The Doors, The Rascals were the only major band of the \u201960s that didn\u2019t use a bass player onstage. Wouldn\u2019t you have had a fuller sound with one?\n\nIt was credibility thing. The Beatles set the bar \u2013 except for the last performance with Billy Preston, they never brought anyone else onstage. It was a sacred number. The Beatles were four, The Rascals had four.\n\nBut the Beatles had a bass player.\n\nFelix handled the bass part perfectly well with organ pedals. He had it all down.\n\nWas there ever any thought of having Eddie learn bass?\n\nWe actually bought Eddie a Fender Mustang Bass in \u201967, which he still owns but never learned to play. He wasn\u2019t physical like that or had the head to learn. Eddie\u2019s job was doing what Jim Morrison did \u2013 he was the personality of the band, and the most lovable one to the fans. I was relegated to the George Harrison position, where I would get two songs on an album. When we first started, Eddie, Felix, and I sang an equal number of songs, but then Eddie and Felix became the lead singers. Onstage, they were magical. Certain songs fit each of them, but Eddie basically became the balladeer. Felix could never have pulled off \u201cHow Can I Be Sure.\u201d That was a different world.\n\nWould you agree that after The Rascals last big hit, \u201cPeople Got To Be Free,\u201d in \u201968, the quality of singles like \u201cHeaven,\u201d \u201cSee,\u201d \u201cCarry Me Back,\u201d and \u201cGlory, Glory\u201d was not up to the standard of the earlier work?\n\nWell, all songwriters \u2013 Billy Joel, Paul Simon, Elton John, James Taylor, Paul McCartney, or John Fogerty \u2013 you\u2019re lucky to be in a zone for three or four years, then you kind of run out of fresh ideas. You don\u2019t connect anymore. I talk to Billy Joel. He won\u2019t make another record \u2013 wants nothing to do with it. McCartney keeps going but he\u2019s not writing any new classics. Smokey Robinson ain\u2019t writing anything. If you have your time, you\u2019re really blessed.\n\nWhy did Eddie, who was Felix\u2019s songwriting partner, leave the band in 1970 and basically do nothing in music until your Once Upon A Dream musical in 2013?\n\nI can\u2019t speak for Eddie, but he had difficulties with Felix. Felix couldn\u2019t get him to live up to deadlines with lyrics, and it was a struggle for Felix. Eddie took the idea that, \u201cFelix is acting like my boss,\u201d but Felix just wanted to keep the work going. The day we were signing a contract with Columbia, Eddie got into a shouting match with Felix, and when Eddie walked out of the room, that was basically the end of The Rascals. The songwriting broke down and the spirit of the band broke down with it.\n\nIn retrospect, was leaving Atlantic a bad decision?\n\nYes, we should have never left Atlantic. Our time to be relevant, songwriting-wise, had passed, but they still pushed the hell out of our records. They wanted to keep us alive, but spent a lot more time with Aretha Franklin, who went a from a $15,000-per-year guarantee to a million dollars. So, at the end of our five years, they were still offering us the same $15,000. Columbia offered us $200,000 and said, \u201cLook how many records we\u2019re selling with Chicago \u2013 30 million on each album around the world.\u201d So, we said, \u201cThat\u2019s for us.\u201d We were not thinking. We were going to lose Arif Mardin, have to produce ourselves, and be in the corporate structure. It was just a bad deal all around. Even Clive Davis, who signed us, said in his book it was one of the biggest mistakes he ever made. Felix was the guy everybody thought could carry the whole thing by himself. But, he couldn\u2019t. It was the four of us.\n\nThe Rascals are about the only famous \u201960s band that today could do a full reunion with original members.\n\nYou nailed it. We checked it out, and there are bands where members are still alive but incapable of performing. We are still capable. We showed it on the 2013 shows. I would love to play with the guys again, without a doubt. Felix wanted to continue, but Dino and Eddie were shell-shocked. The Rascals were never smart. That\u2019s the real tragedy of the band.\n\nWhat about a new album?\n\nIt would be foolish to make another album, because nobody\u2019s in the zone anymore. What are you gonna compete with, the greatness from before? Arif Mardin is no longer with us, and he was the only person that all four of us respected totally. Sometimes it\u2019s better to just leave things be.\n\nWhat are your fondest memories of the time when The Rascals were one of America\u2019s biggest bands?\n\nThere were so many things that went by so quickly. There wasn\u2019t one night we didn\u2019t kill onstage \u2013 we never once went out there and phoned it in. Even if one of us was sick, we still poured it on, and we loved each other when we were together.\n\nLike brothers.\n\nTotally. We\u2019re still like brothers; sometimes we agree to disagree.\n\nThis article originally appeared in VG November 2017 issue. All copyrights are by the author and Vintage Guitar magazine.

That gig lasted into early 1964, after which they had been back in New York and Cavaliere was recruited into Joey Dee & the Starliters, whose ranks additionally got here to incorporate Eddie Brigati and a Canadian-born guitarist named Gene Cornish.\n\nHe and Cornish later had one other group together referred to as Bulldog that lasted for 2 albums, enjoying a regional hit along the way in which.\n\nThe Rascals got here together in 1964 after Cavaliere, Brigati, and Cornish left Dee and shaped a quartet with Danelli. In February 1965 they began gigging in New Jersey and on Long Island.
