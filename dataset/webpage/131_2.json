He killed four Arabs before running out of ammunition. An angry mob then beat him to death.\n\nA Haifa district court judge said that despite the soldier's actions, a democracy could not tolerate vigilante justice and rejected an \"eye for an eye\" defence. After the verdict on Thursday, Israeli Arabs hurled stones toward police in protest at what they called unjust punishment.\n\nMeanwhile, in Jerusalem, a two-year-old girl was moderately wounded when she was struck in the head by a stone hurled at the car in which she was traveling. A police spokesman, Micky Rosenfeld, said the attack appeared to be nationalistic in nature as Jewish vehicles are often targeted in the area by youths in nearby Arab villages.\n\nThe baby girl was taken to hospital, where the mayor of Jerusalem, Nir Barkat, called on authorities to crack down on a recent wave of stone-throwing attacks in the city. \"It's about time we start treating a stone as a weapon,\" he told Israel's Channel 10 TV.\n\nThe prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, wished the girl a speedy recovery. \"We will find these criminals and bring them to justice,\" he said."}, {"url": "https://www.haaretz.com/2005-08-08/ty-article/reconstruction-of-shfaram-lynch-shows-natan-zada-was-killed-after-some-policemen-stepped-off-bus/0000017f-ef16-d4cd-af7f-ef7e99dc0000", "page_content": "Some of the policemen who had shielded the Jewish terrorist, Eden Natan Zada, from an angry mob in Shfaram immediately after he had killed four people on a bus driving through the Arab city on Thursday, stepped off the vehicle, which enabled several people to board the bus and beat him to death. This scenario emerged from a reconstruction of the incident with Shfaram residents, defense forces and bus passengers.\n\nAt 5:05 P.M. on Thursday, Egged bus No. 165 to Shraram left Haifa's Lev Hamifratz station, where the Jewish terrorist Eden Natan Zada apparently got on. \"The religious Jewish soldier was on the bus, sitting in the back,\" Abtihaj Salame, who boarded the bus at the Kiryat Ata junction, said. \"Everyone thought he would get off before Shfaram, but he remained seated when the bus reached the city's entrance.\" Another passenger, Khail Janahawi, recalled that at 5:35 P.M., the driver asked the soldier to come to the front of the bus, but he ignored the request. \"When we reached Shfaram's Druze neighborhood, the soldier rose and walked to the front door, as though he wanted to get off. The door opened, and then he turned around and started shooting,\" Salame said.\n\nBadia Sha'aban was sitting in the back part of the bus when the attack took place. \"I didn't know what was happening,\" she said. \"I heard shots and screams, and lay between the seats. The soldier approached me, placed the barrel on my head and pulled the trigger. I closed my eyes and saw the end, but there were no bullets left. He started changing magazines, but I pushed him, and two others jumped on him and stopped him.\"\n\nA member of the security forces who was driving behind the bus in his car, said: \"I cocked my rifle and started running. I reached the back door, entered the bus with two others, and saw the terrorist aim his rifle at the head of a young woman, while he was trying to change magazines. We jumped on him. I held my rifle to his head, and told him to drop the gun. Hundreds of people crowded outside the bus. I held him tightly for a few minutes, and two policemen arrived. One of them handcuffed him, and I turned to the front of the bus to see what was happening. Four people including the driver were lying motionless there.\"\n\nThe man said that as soon as the terrorist was overcome, \"many people boarded the bus - mainly youngsters. The commotion was great. Within minutes, the bus was bursting with people and surrounded by an angry crowd, whose rage increased when it transpired that the shooter was a Jewish soldier.\"\n\nShfaram policemen reached the bus. One officer said Natan Zada was badly beaten but still alive. Channel 10 broadcast video clips yesterday confirming that the terrorist was alive after the shooting. Naatan Zada is seen walking in the bus bound. A few youngsters are seen bursting into the bus, while at least two policemen were inside it.\n\nAt 5:40 P.M. the telephone in Shfaram's emergency center rang. \"We were flooded with calls reporting massive shooting on a bus,\" M'houl, a paramedic, said. Five minutes later, M'houl was on the bus. \"I got in through the front door. The driver was slumped in his seat lifeless. Another passenger behind him was dead. Two women sat in the other front seat, one was lifeless and the other unconscious, but breathing. We started resuscitating her. I saw a commotion in the back of the bus. I did not know then that a soldier had done the shooting.\"\n\nAt 6:06 P.M., the media broadcast the report of the bus attack. Large police forces amassed at the city's entrance. Policemen surrounded Zada in the back of the bus. The crowd would not let them take Zada out with with the bodies. Ambulances came to evacuate the three bodies.\n\nShortly afterward, the crowd removed the bodies from the bus, leaving only Zada and the policemen on board. \"I saw his face covered with a black bag, but his legs were moving. I didn't know if he was alive or dead,\" a youngster said.\n\nThe police tried to prevent other youngsters from entering the bus under a shower of stones hurled by the crowd. The police tried to drive the bus away, but the crowd would not let them proceed.\n\nSome of the policemen left the bus, and many youngsters boarded it and wrestled with the remaining policemen inside. They finally reached Zada and beat him to death. \"He's finished,\" one of them yelled from the window.\n\nBy 10:20 P.M., religious leaders tried to persuade the crowd to disperse, but in vain. At 10:35 P.M., Zada's body was taken out of the back window into a police car, which drove through the crowd while youngsters threw stones at it. As soon as the terrorist's body was removed, the crowd calmed down and started to disperse.

Zada wore his Israel Defense Forces uniform and, as prescribed, carried with him his military-issued M-16 assault rifle, magazine primed in the slot. On any given day, Israel\u2019s public transport system brims with young men like him, shuttling to and from military bases across the Israeli coastal plain and the occupied Golan Heights and West Bank. On this particular day, however, he was neither returning home nor reporting for duty. Several weeks earlier, he had deserted from the army in protest at his government\u2019s evacuation of 8,000 settlers from the occupied Gaza Strip as part of Israel\u2019s self-styled \u201cdisengagement\u201d from shards of the Occupied Territories. Zada himself had recently moved to the West Bank settlement of Tapuah, where, it was later reported, he had fallen in with the far-right Kach movement. Formally outlawed by the Israeli government, Kach expounds a virulently racist ideology demanding the removal of all non-Jews from the Land of Israel. Once his bus had arrived in Shafa \u2018Amr, Zada set his M-16 on automatic and put his beliefs into practice. He killed the driver and three passengers, and wounded another 12, before being overpowered and then beaten to death by angry townspeople, who shunted aside a handful of policemen belatedly arriving at the scene to handcuff the killer. All of the victims were Palestinian citizens of Israel, often termed \u201cIsraeli Arabs\u201d by Israeli Jews.\n\nDeploying the kind of flanking public relations maneuver that has become his hallmark, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon moved quickly to contain the damage. To wide international acclaim, he branded Zada a \u201cterrorist,\u201d and slotted the shootings into appropriate context. \u201cThis terrorist event was a deliberate attempt to harm the fabric of relations among all Israeli citizens,\u201d his office explained. It was widely presumed that Zada wanted to provoke disturbances among Israel\u2019s Arab minority \u2014 a fifth of the Israeli population, and mostly concentrated in the country\u2019s north \u2014 and so force the government to divert a share of the 40,000 soldiers and police mobilized for the southern Gaza evacuations, thereby disrupting the \u201cdisengagement.\u201d At the very least, he inspired Asher Weissgan, 38, from the West Bank settlement of Shvut Rahel, who on August 17 shot dead four West Bank Palestinians with whom he worked in a nearby settlement industrial zone, and wounded two others. The following day Weissgan told the Israeli press he had \u201cno regrets\u201d and that he hoped someone would kill Sharon. The Israeli premier dutifully condemned the attack as an \u201cexceptionally grave Jewish act of terror,\u201d and \u201cinstructed the security establishment to deal harshly with all attempts to harm innocent people,\u201d Israel Radio reported. In contrast to Zada\u2019s attack, Weissgan\u2019s crime garnered few headlines in Israel, and none in the international media, which was otherwise disengaged in Gaza. BBC World evening news showed the way by appending a one-line mention of the attack to a ten-minute panorama of tearful Gaza settlers jostling with Israeli soldiers.\n\nThat their lives are cheap came as no news to Palestinians in the Occupied Territories. To Palestinian citizens of Israel, however, Weissgan\u2019s copycat rampage only deepened the sense that their own existence inside Israel is becoming similarly fraught, buffeted by obsessive Israeli demographic debates and hateful denigrations by senior politicians that reached a fever pitch in the run-up to disengagement, and in which \u201cIsraeli Arabs\u201d figure as a national threat no less than their kin across the Green Line. In this respect, the government and media\u2019s voluminous response to Zada\u2019s attack did much less to reassure them than to remind them of how warped is the \u201cfabric of relations\u201d in which they are entangled.\n\nNews from Another Country\n\nFor Arab citizens attempting to follow events in Shafa \u2018Amr on the evening of August 4, the most surreal spectacle was provided not by Natan Zada but by their national media. Following an hour of stumped silence, fragmentary reports began emerging on radio and television, hazarding at first, as transcribed by the Nazareth-based I\u2018lam Media Center, that \u201ca Druze soldier shot at the passengers in the bus.\u201d Two and a half hours after the attack, Channel 2 reported a \u201cconflict between the passengers and the soldier, who was drawn into it, with these results\u201d and went on to note that among the victims \u201cthere are some people who are not Jewish.\u201d On the rival Channel 10 news network, anchors Yiron London and Tzvi Yehezkeli \u201cretained an easy, relaxed atmosphere,\u201d observed I\u2018lam. \u201cAt the top of the broadcast, [London] gave no acknowledgement to the headline newsflash of a \u2018major event, with shooting and deaths,\u2019 [instead] beginning his report with news on the Maccabi Haifa soccer team, reporting with more seriousness than he did for\u2026Shafa \u2018Amr. [Afterwards] Tzvi Yehezkeli joined London in the studio, also with [a] calm, serene face as if the murder of these four people was an imaginary event, involving the deaths of imaginary victims.\u201d\n\nAnxious Arab families were left to imagine the worst. There was no coverage of the dozen people Zada had wounded, notes I\u2018lam: \u201cNo reports or interviews were made from the hospitals, no emergency numbers were broadcast and no psychologists assisting the families were interviewed\u2026. Not one media outlet posed even one question about the wounded, in stark contrast to standard practice in similar incidents where the victims are Jews.\u201d Coverage of Zada\u2019s victims was largely crowded out by coverage of Zada himself, presented with a solemnity otherwise reserved for Jewish victims of Palestinian terror. His picture was shown on TV, captioned with his identity as an Israeli solider, the dates of his birth and death, and the epitaph \u201cGod Bless His Soul.\u201d The day after, Hebrew and English tabloids carried front-page pictures of Zada and his bruised corpse. Papers excavated the human story behind the killer and incessantly interviewed his stricken family \u2014 an interest they could not arouse for any of his victims. While framed by a wall-to-wall display of solemn condemnation that even recruited Israeli settler representatives for full, if also surreal effect, the coverage served only to remind Palestinian citizens that they are marginal in Israeli society in ways that even a Jewish extremist like Zada could never be. The contrast with the media\u2019s parallel presentation of disengagement as a national trauma uniting Jewish settlers and soldiers in a pastiche of grief was stark.\n\nLike Zada\u2019s attack, such media coverage sharpened the question of just where Israel\u2019s Arab citizens belong. What was most disquieting about his rampage was that it enacted a belief that they are as much enemies of their state as the Palestinians in the Occupied Territories \u2014 a presumption that Zada is far from alone in making, as the coverage infallibly demonstrated. Once the full story emerged, editorials and TV commentators predicted inevitable riots, muscularly anticipated by their government. In preparation for the funerals of Zada\u2019s victims, Reuters reported, \u201cThousands of Israeli police were called to the north after alerts of potential riots,\u201d ominously recalling that \u201cforces shot dead 13 Israeli Arabs in October 2000 when they tried to quell a rally in support of a Palestinian uprising that had grown violent.\u201d Such references to the \u201cOctober Riots,\u201d as they are known to most Israeli Jews, were ubiquitous in the press. Palestinian citizens of Israel had already registered the echo of an event they saw very differently \u2014 a debacle during which they had been open targets of a rhetoric and treatment akin to that meted out across the border.\n\nThe conversations that their Jewish co-citizens conducted over their heads the following week did nothing to allay this sense of elision. On August 11, the liberal Israeli daily Ha\u2019aretz demoted the disengagement preparations and the Shafa \u2018Amr fallout to lead with a piece of breaking census information. \u201cFor the First Time, Jews No Longer a Majority Between the Jordan and the Sea,\u201d ran the headline. Nonetheless, the article reassured readers, by ditching Gaza and its 1.4 million Palestinians, Israel would buy itself Jewish demographic superiority for another 20 years. To Israel\u2019s first citizens it was an overt plug for disengagement; to Palestinian citizens of Israel, it was a pointed reminder that the Jewish left-center lumps them with other Palestinians no less than did Zada. The inferred difference is that Kach begs the bigger question: after 20 years, then what? Aptly surmounting the day\u2019s other headlines, the Ha\u2019aretz census story provided a metatext for events in Gaza and Shafa \u2018Amr. As veteran commentator Akiva Eldar fruitlessly noted in the same paper: \u201cSolid politicians and popular intellectuals who lend a hand \u2014 whether by commission or omission \u2014 to erasing the Green Line that, in the collective consciousness, distinguishes residents of the Triangle [the densest cluster of Arab towns in Israel], from their neighbors in the West Bank, are turning Israel\u2019s Arabs into enemies.\u201d\n\n\u201cLynching\u201d the Victims\n\nThe press, however, was already busy working the transformation. As I\u2018lam observed, on the night of the attack, Channel 2 broadcast only one picture from the scene: the picture of the \u201cangry mob.\u201d It lingered in the ether well into the night, explicated by comments like \u201cthe mob is still angry,\u201d and signified by incessant references to the \u201criots\u201d of October 2000. According to the version of the latter events then enshrined by the media, they were carried out by an armed Arab \u201cmob\u201d seeking to invade neighboring Jewish communities, egged on by the local Arab leadership. Evidence presented to a subsequent government-appointed inquiry, the Or Commission, showed this narrative to be patently false. Yet the myth prevailed, and it was now readily redeployed. Relentlessly interpolating \u201cIsraeli Arabs\u201d as violent, irrational and easily \u201cincited\u201d pathogens within the body politic, the effect, as in the aftermath of October 2000, was to preposition them not as an aggrieved and threatened community but as a riot-in-the-making and to license, if necessary, their violent suppression. As Palestinian citizens mourned their dead, they were reminded that there might be more if they did not mourn quietly and that, as in 2000, those killed or executed would only have themselves to blame.\n\nThe \u201clynching\u201d of Zada became a fulcrum for this discourse, the angle quickly adjusted by editorial headlines like \u201cThe Shame of the Jews \u2014 and Arabs.\u201d International wire services and major networks like the BBC also peppered their online stories with the word \u201clynching.\u201d In Israel, indeed, the killing of Zada became a story to rival his killings. On Channel 1, journalist Ayala Hason treated viewers to phrases like \u201cthey slaughtered him\u201d and \u201cthey took their fury out on him.\u201d These were carefully cultivated echoes of the lynching of two Israeli soldiers who had mysteriously become \u201clost\u201d in Ramallah during the bloodiest phase of the Israeli army\u2019s counterinsurgency in October 2000, so linking \u201cIsraeli Arab\u201d behavior to that of the Palestinian enemy at large. Israelis didn\u2019t fail to pick up on this. \u201cWho knows what happened to him?\u201d one neighbor of Zada\u2019s family told the press. \u201cMaybe the lynching of the soldiers in Ramallah affected him.\u201d That the Israeli journalist dismissed this as a \u201cdelusional theory\u201d did nothing to dampen the atmospheric resonance. The outrage was critically amplified by the fact that Zada was killed after the local police had boarded the bus and taken him into custody, effectively turning the affair into an Arab assault on Jewish authority. Sharon soon ordered a full investigation into the matter, stressing that everyone would be held accountable.\n\nBy taking Zada\u2019s killers to task, the lynching narrative also burnished Israel\u2019s self-image as a state committed to law and legality. Recouping its failure to uphold the law with respect to Jewish extremists, it thrust the spotlight back on its unruly\n\nArab minority. Indeed, as the media waxed nervous about the redistribution of security forces necessitated by disengagement, it reinforced the notion that law only existed when Jews were there to enforce it. Arab Knesset members fed grist into this mill by calling for the government to suspend its inquiry into Zada\u2019s killing. \u201cUsually a person who disarms a terrorist is considered a hero, but in this case the heroes are being accused,\u201d protested one \u201cArab sector\u201d leader to Israeli Army Radio. Under the headline \u201cA Lynching Is a Lynching,\u201d the right-leaning Jerusalem Post countered that \u201cno country in which the law is properly enforced would permit an incident in which people take the law into their own hands to be ignored without in- vestigating the circumstances and those involved.\u201d\n\nAs a few Jewish commentators observed, however, a bit of investigative vigilance would have been in order well before August 4. The attack was, as peace activist Uri Avnery commented, \u201ca massacre foretold.\u201d Zada was on an alert list maintained by the General Security Services (Shin Bet), was a known Kach member, and had done at least one reconnaissance tour on the bus in which he would stage his attack. He had also deserted the army with his gun in hand. \u201cThe murderer himself was arrested several times in the course of extreme right-wing activities in the past,\u201d noted Avnery. \u201cAnd why didn\u2019t the army act, in spite of the fact that the commanders of the murderer knew that he had deserted in protest against the disengagement, taking his rifle with him? Indeed, his mother, who foresaw what was coming, bombarded the army with requests to find him and take the weapon away from him.\u201d What no commentator reflected on, however, was the fact that if Zada had known that his was indeed a country where \u201cthe law is properly enforced,\u201d he might not have extinguished four lives.\n\n\u201cThe Police Will Come, and It Will Be OK\u201d\n\nFrom firsthand accounts it is possible to reconstruct the trail of events on August 4. As the bus entered a Druze neighborhood of Shafa \u2018Amr and pulled up at a stop, Zada went to the front, leveled his M-16 at the Arab driver, Michel Bahous, 56, and shot him. He then moved down the aisles, firing in short bursts at the dozen passengers cowering in the back. One rider managed to jump out the open door. Zada killed Nadir Hayak, 55, and sisters Hazar and Dina Turki, aged 23 and 21 respectively, but ran out of bullets with the barrel leveled at the head of a pleading young woman. As he fumbled to change his clip, she shoved him. Other passengers saw their chance and rushed the assailant. They were quickly joined by Husam al-\u2018Ayan, an armed Druze security guard who was driving in his car behind the bus, and boarded through the open door. For five minutes the other men wrestled with and beat Zada, who clung to his weapon, according to al-\u2018Ayan. He was effectively under citizens\u2019 arrest by the time a few policemen arrived to handcuff him. A mobile phone camera recording broadcast on Israeli TV showed that Zada was still alive at this time. Soon enough, however, a growing crowd overpowered the police and what remained of Zada\u2019s life was beaten out of him.\n\nInferring that \u201che knew he would never get out alive,\u201d Palestinian Knesset member Azmi Bishara dubbed Zada\u2019s \u201ca suicide operation\u201d in Egypt\u2019s al-Ahram Weekly. But Bishara was mistaken. As Zada confessed on the bus, he didn\u2019t think for a moment that he would pay with his life for what he had done. \u201cDo you know what you are doing?\u201d one man asked the pinned-down soldier, according to al-\u2018Ayan. \u201cThere are soldiers and policemen living here.\u201d The man was referring to the Druze, who have been encouraged by the state to foster an identity distinct from Arab Palestinians \u2014 and, unlike Muslims and Christians, must by law serve in Israel\u2019s armed forces. \u201cAll I know is that this is an Arab town,\u201d responded Zada. \u201cSoon the police will come, and it will be OK.\u201d His intended victims, now turned captors, knew he was right. \u201cPunishment depends on nationality,\u201d Amira Hass reminded Ha\u2019aretz readers afterwards. Among others, she recalled the example of Yoram Skolnik, who in 1993 \u201cmurdered an Arab who was bound hand and foot, and was given a life sentence. President Ezer Weizman twice reduced his sentence: first to 15 years, and then to 11 years and three months. He was ultimately released seven years after his arrest. Skolnik is part of a list of Jews who murdered Arabs and were released by the judicial system.\u201d The most poignant comparison, however, evaded even Hass.\n\nIn 1984, in what came to be known as the \u201cBus 300 Affair,\u201d operatives from the Shin Bet \u2014 the same agency charged with investigating the killing of Zada \u2014 stormed an Egged bus hijacked by four Palestinian militants from Gaza. Two gunmen and a passenger were killed. The two remaining Palestinians were removed in handcuffs, as captured on film by Israeli journalists, and were soon executed on the orders of the agency\u2019s director, Avraham Shalom. The government claimed they died on the way to hospital. Despite a lengthy and murky state investigation involving internal disciplinary hearings, no was ever jailed over the killings. When the attorney general threatened to indict the involved, he was sacked. To forestall any other legal challenges, Israeli President Chaim Herzog awarded the Shin Bet agents an amnesty in 1986, a decision subsequently backed by the Supreme Court. Ten years later, on his retirement from the Shin Bet, Ehud Yatom admitted to an Israeli newspaper that he had crushed his two captives\u2019 skulls with a stone, adding that such extrajudicial killings were routine during Shin Bet operations. Yatom\u2019s handiness did not much impede his career. In June 2001, Ariel Sharon sought to appoint him as a special \u201ccounter-terrorism\u201d advisor but was forced to back down after the courts intervened. Today Yatom is a member of the Knesset for Sharon\u2019s Likud party.\n\nSuch stories are familiar to Israel\u2019s Palestinian citizens. As one witness to the attack told the Jerusalem Post: \u201cIf this attack had occurred in a Jewish neighborhood and the attacker was Arab, he would have been killed immediately. The police came and they didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d It was notable that al-\u2018Ayan himself had not used his gun, as he was trained to do against terrorists, and despite the fact that when he boarded the bus, Zada was still clutching his M-16. Al-\u2018Ayan is employed as a security guard by the Israeli government, serves in its armed forces and, in the absence of the police, boarded the bus as the state\u2019s emissary. But the idea of an Arab killing a Jew, even when the Arab is defending life and the Jew threatening it, was too forbidding. Al-\u2018Ayan\u2019s caution doubtless underscored to the local crowd that the arrival of the police meant not that Zada would be delivered unto justice, but that justice would be snatched from his victims. Told that he had treated them all as just Arabs, they returned the gesture. Over the ensuing days, it was commonly recounted in the neighborhood that there had been an additional 14 M-16 clips in a bag Zada had carried with him on the bus.\n\nEquality before the law was not an issue for the killer alone. At the funeral of Zada\u2019s victims, \u2018Abd al-Rahman Salih, a Bedouin leader, demanded that \u201cthe Israeli government destroy the house of the man who did this. If they do it to a [Palestinian] terrorist they should do it here.\u201d In the irony-free corridors of Israel\u2019s government, however, collective responsibility does not extend to Israeli Jews: Zada\u2019s parents were not rendered homeless. When equal treatment was afforded, meanwhile, it was so conspicuous as to beg more questions than it stilled, as Amira Hass again noted: \u201cShortly after the murders in Shfaram [as Shafa \u2018Amr is rendered in Hebrew], it was reported that those wounded and the families of the murder victims would receive recognition as victims of terrorism, dealt with and compensated accordingly. And the question immediately arose, since when do you highlight as a news item something that is self-explanatory and common sense? Except that equality among Jews and Arabs in Israel is not something self-explanatory. Therefore the news item, which should never have been a news item, was appropriate.\u201d\n\nA ministerial committee later decided that it would not be possible to recognize Shafa \u2018Amr\u2019s dead and wounded as \u201cvictims of terror\u201d because Zada was a soldier and could not under the law be identified as a \u201cmember of a hostile organization.\u201d\n\nWanting to Believe\n\nZada\u2019s choice of Shafa \u2018Amr as the site for his attack exposed awkward ironies in the imagined Arab-Jewish equality in Israel. Though close to Nazareth, \u201ccapital\u201d of Israel\u2019s Arab Palestinian minority and home to many of its most prominent political and cultural figures, Shafa \u2018Amr is widely viewed as a \u201cpro-Israeli\u201d Arab town by the government and praised as such by media commentators. During Israel\u2019s 1948 war of independence its leadership openly cooperated with Jewish forces, with the result that its inhabitants were spared the forced evictions that accompanied the conquest and near emptying of Arab Palestine, executed with particular brutality in nearby villages like Tantura and Safsaf, where Zionist forces carried out a massacre of the civilian population. Tellingly, Shafa \u2018Amr\u2019s mayor served an uninterrupted term from the late 1930s through the 1960s, just after the Israeli government suspended the application of martial law to its Arab minority. Unusually, the present mayor is a member of the Likud. The spoils of such loyalty are evident in a gleaming glass-and-chrome cultural center on the outskirts of town, and in a relative prosperity that, while a pale shadow of the Galilee\u2019s self-consciously \u201ccolonizing\u201d Jewish communities, contrasts favorably with the crowded ghetto-like conditions of Arab towns like Nazareth, Acre and Sakhnin.\n\nIn this arrangement, Shafa \u2018Amr\u2019s Druze community, of which Husam al-\u2018Ayan is a typically upstanding member, occupies a marginally more privileged tier. Like him, Druze men serve in the Israeli security forces, one of the few employment advantages afforded them over other Arabs in Israel. Yet it is telling that, as a member of a community distinct from Israel\u2019s Jewish citizens, al-\u2018Ayan\u2019s exemplary conduct during the attack was not highlighted. In reporting by Ha\u2019aretz he was identified only as a \u201csecurity guard,\u201d from which many readers would infer that he is Jewish. In the Arab mob tableau, he did not fit the picture. Indeed, a day before the expiration of the first deadline set by Sharon for the Shin Bet\u2019s Shafa \u2018Amr investigation, al-\u2018Ayan had not yet been interviewed by a single official, though he was an ideal witness for the state.\n\nThough none of Zada\u2019s victims were Druze, his attack in Shafa \u2018Amr\u2019s Druze neighborhood opened minor cracks in the community\u2019s relations with the government. Shamil Ibrahim, the owner of a kiosk across the street from where the shooting took place, was among the first Druze locals to board the bus. A lean man with a crew cut, he is also a member of the Israeli army\u2019s crack Golani brigade, with a tour of duty in Lebanon on his record, and had just been called up to serve as part of the army\u2019s disengagement mobilization. The day after the attack, however, he tore up his summons. \u201cAfter what I saw, I can\u2019t wear this uniform,\u201d he explained with a hard stare. Knowing the importance of the Druze to Israel\u2019s armed forces, Zada\u2019s calculation may indeed have been to provoke precisely this kind of response. But Shamil is in a minority. Al-\u2018Ayan heeded his own call-up order that same week. Despite loud complaints from the police that nine officers had been injured in scuffles with the crowd, officers on the scene relied on local residents for cups of coffee and food as they entered a long standoff with the crowd for control of the bus. In the immediate wake of Zada\u2019s rampage, Israeli flags still fluttered from several houses in Shafa \u2018Amr\u2019s Druze neighborhood. Such a sight is rare in Arab towns in Israel, even in less aggrieved circumstances.\n\nMany of Shafa \u2018Amr\u2019s residents belong to the always small and now further shrinking segment of Israel\u2019s Arab (and less self-consciously Palestinian) population struggling to believe in the \u201cfabric of relations,\u201d tested though they may be by their government. A friend of Shamil\u2019s, Jabbour Jabbour, a local travel agent and the son of Shafa \u2018Amr\u2019s Christian deputy mayor, proudly recounted that in the late 1990s he had made national and international news by trying to become the first Arab flight attendant on El Al airlines. He was declined three times by the hiring board and then took his case public, in what proved to be a major international embarrassment for Israel\u2019s national carrier. Finally vindicated, he became a poster boy for how, purportedly, Arab citizens can combat prejudice within the parameters, and indeed with the help, of Israeli law. Though he never accepted his belated job offer, he feels his case opened the door to a few Arab individuals who later did, but he admits that such victories may still be token. He sustains no illusions in matters such as the Zada attack. \u201cThe problem was that people were afraid that if the police took him away he would be judged as crazy and freed after three to five years. He would be released a hero,\u201d he said unhesitatingly.\n\n\u201cNot an Isolated Incident\u201d\n\nJabbour\u2019s fears were justified. Zada had acted \u201cin a fit of insanity,\u201d according to a typical Israeli editorial in the wake of the attack. \u201cWe will not allow crazy men and terrorists to harm your life here,\u201d echoed Israeli Vice Premier Shimon Peres as he visited the victims\u2019 families two days later. Not incidentally, insanity was also the plea quickly adopted by Asher Weissgan\u2019s lawyer in defense of his client. \u201cA sane and balanced person would not have said what he said,\u201d he argued, prompting the Petah Tikvah Magistrate\u2019s Court to order a psychiatric evaluation. Though calls for Sharon\u2019s head were hardly an aberration among the settler community in the run-up to disengagement, this rationalization found frequent purchase. Allowing Israeli society to selectively distance itself from Zada, the moniker of the Bad Apple from Tapuah (\u201capple\u201d in Hebrew) rapidly gained currency in the press.\n\nImportantly, this pathological subtext also denied any equating of Jewish and Arab terror, Sharon\u2019s condemnations notwithstanding. Zada was a sick human being, but a human being nonetheless. Arabs, by implicit converse, are merely sickly inhuman: unlike Jews, degeneracy is innate in their nature. Such inferences could not but be drawn by Palestinian citizens habitually characterized by Jewish politicians and religious leaders as a disease or vermin. The most frank exponents of such language are the Moledet and Yisrael Beiteinu parties, which campaign openly for the Arab population\u2019s transfer from the country. Moledet sat in a coalition government with Sharon\u2019s Likud from 2001 until 2004 and, like Yisrael Beiteinu, mines a deep vein of public sympathy. Support for transfer \u2014 expulsion \u2014 has always been high in Israel and is showing no signs of abating; a 2003 Democracy Index survey shows that 57 percent of Jews support the idea, either as implemented through \u201cincentives\u201d or by force. Not surprisingly, Peres\u2019 assurances to Zada\u2019s victims that \u201cyour pain is the pain of the entire State of Israel\u201d were hard for most Palestinian citizens to swallow.\n\nAs Arab communities across Israel observed a one-day strike, Sheikh Ra\u2019id Salah, the formerly imprisoned head of the Islamic Movement in Israel, echoed the rest of the Arab leadership in his response. \u201cThis is not an isolated incident. It is the outcome of the Israeli discriminatory policy against the Arab residents of Israel,\u201d he noted at the Shafa \u2018Amr funerals. \u201cIsrael officially incites against the Arabs in the country. Senior officials repeatedly state that we are considered a demographic danger, and describe us as cancer cells which should be removed.\u201d State policy reflects such rhetoric, tightly constraining the development of Arab communities through rolling land confiscations, strict limits on new construction, house demolitions, discriminatory social budgeting and encystment by rings of Jewish development. That the Arab minority is socially disadvantaged is widely acknowledged by the Israeli media. As a rule, however, the effects of structural state violence are mystified by references to Arab primitiveness and anomie. Redress is at best indefinitely deferred, at worst openly acknowledged as a non-issue for a state whose primary responsibility is to its Jewish citizens. When Israel\u2019s National Insurance Institute published a report five days after Zada\u2019s attack showing that poverty in Israel has reached historic highs, a Ministry of Finance spokesman could accordingly hasten to add that more than two thirds of those poor were Arab and ultra-Orthodox (non-Zionist Jews). Critically, acknowledgement of discrimination never licenses Arab protest, a lack of empathy that conspicuously contrasts with the media\u2019s coverage of the Zada family\u2019s life on the down-and-out margins of the middle-class town of Rishon Letzion. \u201cThey have put us into a ghetto,\u201d complained Zada\u2019s father, Yitzhak. \u201cHow is it possible to live this way?\u201d\n\nArab leaders who posed the same question after Shafa \u2018Amr, however, were quickly intimidated and promptly vilified as agents provocateurs in an overt throwback to Israel\u2019s master narrative of October 2000. In the mandate subsequently laid down for the Or Commission by the government, incitement charges against Arab leaders were prescribed as a fact and the Commission dutifully sustained them in three cases. Resetting the stage after Shafa \u2018Amr, the hawkish Jerusalem Post sought to shift the blame even further, complaining: \u201cIn its final report that commission chose to place emphasis on the long history of official discrimination against the Arabs rather than on the growing and vociferous identification of the Israeli Arab leadership with Arafat and the PLO.\u201d As documented by the Arab Association for Human Rights in Nazareth, police brutality against Palestinian citizens has continued unabated since October 2000, subject to widespread impunity. Symptomatically, not a single policeman has been prosecuted in connection with the October 2000 shootings, even though strong evidence, pointing inter alia to point-blank executions of protesters, implicated several officers. An official line was drawn belatedly under these events in September 2005, when the Justice Ministry\u2019s investigations unit, Mahash, published a report after five years of mostly inactive inquiries in which it refused to indict a single police officer. But, whereas Israel\u2019s attorney general has argued that incitement by Jewish anti-disengagement protesters, shading into death threats against Sharon, is merely part of lively public debate, Arab leaders who worked Zada\u2019s actions into context were themselves immediately labeled as inciters.\n\nWith headlines like \u201cResidents\u2019 Restraint and Leaders\u2019 Threats,\u201d the media helped the government shift responsibility for any fallout onto Israel\u2019s Arab leaders. \u201cMost of the media (broadcast and print) did not hesitate to impose the task of \u2018calming things down\u2019 on the Arab members of the Knesset,\u201d noted I\u2018lam. \u201cChannel 1\u2019s Ayala Hason dedicated all of her post-attack interviews with Arab MKs\u2026to this subject.\u201d Editorializing on the center-left, Ha\u2019aretz admonished that \u201cIsrael\u2019s political leaders \u2014 Jewish and Arab \u2014 must work together as seldom before to ensure that, in contrast to the early days of this round of conflict in the fall of 2000, protests and anger in the Israeli Arab community do not explode into bitter violence.\u201d On the right, the Jerusalem Post fulminated against those responsible \u201cfive years ago\u201d for \u201cwidespread anti-Israel hostilities\u2026in obvious coordination with the eruption of Yasser Arafat\u2019s second murderous intifada in the territories.\u201d Largely, the coverage singled out for censure the very same leaders targeted by the Or Commission as \u201cinciters\u201d and \u201corganizers.\u201d The Jerusalem Post was not above seeing such shadowy forces at work on the bus itself. \u201cIt may well be that Zada was killed in a more calculated fashion by extremist elements in what has been one of the most pro-Israel minority cities in Israel,\u201d warned one editorial.\n\nAfterthoughts on the Margins\n\nThe final narrative of Shafa \u2018Amr came to rely heavily on the \u201cextremist element.\u201d Its ghost plainly gunned for Palestinian citizens as they grappled with the event. When the crowd sang \u201cBiladi, Biladi,\u201d the popular Palestinian national anthem, while mourning and protesting at the scene of the attack, TV reporters immediately seized upon this as a \u201ccall to extremism,\u201d noted I\u2018lam. Israeli viewers would have been even more alarmed by the funerals of Zada\u2019s victims. In cars festooned with black antenna strips \u2014 contrasting with the orange strips adopted by Israeli Jewish anti-disengagement protesters \u2014 more than 10,000 Arabs from Shafa \u2018Amr and the surrounding area gathered in town om August 5. Many joined a solemn procession conveying the coffins of sisters Hazar and Dina Turki to their graves, threaded with young men holding aloft a few Palestinian flags and shouting slogans like \u201cWith our blood and soul, we will sacrifice for you, o martyr.\u201d Leading the procession, Shafa \u2018Amr native and MK Muhammad Baraka spoke to the crowd of Israel\u2019s history of violence against its Palestinian citizens.\n\nMore ambivalent dissent was voiced by the Arab Higher Follow-Up Committee, a moribund association dominated by mayors. Spokesman \u2018Abid Anabtawi predicted the possibility of a \u201cnon-violent intifada\u201d erupting in response to the killings. \u201cA popular uprising against the fascism and negative treatment we receive is the most reasonable scenario,\u201d he told Israeli Army\n\nRadio. Yet such rhetoric was immediately softened by committee chairman Shawqi Khatib, who said that the Israeli Arab leadership would continue \u201cto act responsibly as it has in the past 57 years.\u201d There were other signs of fabric mending at work: wreaths from the Israeli government deposited on the graves of victims that none of the protesters thought to remove, and the appearance of Rabbi Menachem Froman from the West Bank settlement of Tekoa at a prayer ceremony for Zada\u2019s two Christian victims, condemning the soldier on behalf of Israel\u2019s Sephardi Chief Rabbi Shlomo Amar. \u201cNothing will happen,\u201d one despondent Arab activist commented during the funeral. \u201cPeople will talk about it. It\u2019s good, nice, to see people unite. The question is, what will we do Monday? We are still living with them [the Jews] as if nothing has happened.\u201d\n\nYet in contrast to an Arab minority still struggling to organize dissent within the forbidding parameters laid down by their government, the Jewish \u201cfringe\u201d makes no attempt to \u201clive with them as if nothing has happened.\u201d In the wake of the attack, Jerusalem Post writer Yosef Goell was content to reinvent common Israeli illusions of normalcy. \u201cNo segment of Israeli society has condoned this attack, much less cheered it,\u201d he averred. \u201cThe contrast between these attitudes and the funerals of Palestinian terrorists is telling. No frenzied thousands are waiting to march with Zada\u2019s coffin, to vow more bloodshed and glorify him as a heroic martyr.\u201d The posturing at Hamas funerals is, however, the preserve of the weak. The militant settlers, one of whom told Ha\u2019aretz at Zada\u2019s funeral that Zada was \u201ca righteous man and did what we are incapable of doing,\u201d launch attacks on Palestinian villages from state-subsidized settlements with only very occasional penalty.\n\nSentiments like those voiced at Zada\u2019s funeral, moreover, are more common than many Israelis would like to admit. A 1987 poll of Jewish youth conducted by the Van Leer Institute showed that one third \u201csupported the ideas of Rabbi Kahane and his [Kach] movement.\u201d A 2001 Haifa University survey found that 20 percent of Israelis would vote for Kach if permitted to do so. Ironically, legalization of the movement is no longer necessary, with Moledet and Yisrael Beiteinu channeling Kahane\u2019s politics into more elliptical and therefore ostensibly permissible agendas. The latitude nevertheless afforded Jewish\n\n\u201cextremists\u201d contrasts starkly with the state\u2019s obsessive concerns about Arab militancy, observes Uri Avnery. \u201cThe Kach group was officially declared a terrorist organization and outlawed some 12 years ago. This means that anyone belonging to it, supporting it or assisting it with money or in any other way, is legally considered a terrorist\u2026. But for years now, the Kach people have been roving the country without hindrance and have committed numberless outrages against Israeli Arab citizens and inhabitants of the occupied Palestinian territories.\u201d\n\nIndeed, in attempting to distance themselves from Zada, Israeli Jews struggled to compartmentalize a \u201cfringe\u201d movement whose sensibilities increasingly ply the country\u2019s political mainstream, rehabilitated by media coverage of the disengagement process. On the Israeli left, some commentators sought to attribute Zada\u2019s action to the zealotry incubated in the country\u2019s settlements. Eliding the quiet repression of Israel\u2019s own Arab citizens, this narrative also contended awkwardly with the fact that in the summer of 2005 no Israelis were at once presented as more human and more sacrificing for their nation and its ideals than these zealots. In the weeks following Zada\u2019s attack, TV screens filled with children and tight nuclear families and gardens and houses and pets, everyone hugging and crying. The pathological Zada fitted poorly into this picture. More typically therefore he was described by one reporter for the Jerusalem Post as \u201cunconsciously camouflaged by the thousands of the settlement movement\u2019s entirely peaceful activists\u2026. His newfound fanaticism fueled his hatred, and compelled him to do what the vast majority of settlers think unconscionable.\u201d\n\nThat settler \u201cactivists\u201d had on June 29 tried to stone to death a Palestinian youth by Gaza\u2019s Gush Katif bloc had no bearing on such explications. Nor did a trail of killings in the West Bank \u2014 some perpetrated by prominent settler leaders like Pinhas Wallerstein \u2014 of which Weissgan\u2019s was only the most recent. Instead, the spectacle of military officials demanding that settler leaders condemn Zada and Weissgan contributed to the re-edification of the \u201cethical\u201d colonists, and displaced questions about the underlying politics that spawns their project. Chasing away from Zada\u2019s grave \u201ca few children with long side curls and big woolen skullcaps\u2026[is] easier than dismantling Tapuah,\u201d commented Tom Segev in Ha\u2019aretz. In parsing the final ruckus over where Zada would be buried, Segev also noted that, though many settlers and ordinary Israelis might indeed shy away from emulating Zada, theirs would not be a judgment on killing Arabs, as much as the context of such killing. \u201cDefense Minister Shaul Mofaz prohibited Natan Zada\u2019s burial in a military cemetery,\u201d noted Segev, \u201cas though he had not been a soldier or had served in a different army. Mofaz, who is not exactly a moral authority, argued that the murderer of Arab passengers on a bus was \u2018not worthy\u2019 of a military grave. However, if we were to remove from the military cemeteries all the soldiers who are tainted with moral opprobrium, in some cases for illegal killing of Palestinian civilians, quite a bit of space would become available.\u201d\n\nA Matter of Time and Place\n\nAs much as Zada\u2019s attack, Israeli discourse on it proved a disturbingly revealing installment in a running debate about the terms of Palestinian life both in and out of Israel. Though it cuts to the heart of the question of just who and where they should be, this is not a debate in which Palestinian are included and it remained that way after Shafa \u2018Amr. As Yitzhak Laor characterized their enduring situation in Ha\u2019aretz: \u201cThey are part of the demographic danger; their mothers\u2019 wombs are a ticking bomb\u2026. Because they constitute a \u2018demographic danger\u2019 \u2014 and they must hear this every day, because they do make children \u2014 and if their children overcome the backwardness that is fostered from above and make it to university, here, too, they have to listen to learned discussions about the danger of their natural increase\u2026. Who will now include the experts on the demographic danger among those responsible for incitement? As a rule, the Arabs are a danger, a matter of time. How much time? It\u2019s not clear.\u201d\n\nIf disengagement is a preemptive maneuver in the demographic battle Israel self-consciously wages against all the Palestinians under its rule, Zada bloodily reminded everyone of its final frontier. Currently demarcated inside Israel by a combination of disenfranchisement, discrimination and occasionally overt violence, this divide hardened further in Shafa \u2018Amr. Unreflective acceptance of Israel\u2019s terms of engagement with its Palestinian and Arab minority allowed most Jewish Israelis to cast Zada\u2019s act as that of a crazed loner, and simultaneously use the opportunity to reinscribe limits to any Arab challenge of these terms. Israeli Palestinian reactions, on the other hand, could not but be filtered through their broader experiences within the threadbare \u201cfabric of relations.\u201d To them, the larger question remains whether Israel is disengaging not just from Gaza and slivers of the West Bank, but also from a future in which Palestinians might have a real and secure place anywhere in their own country."}, {"url": "https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3555829,00.html", "page_content": "The Haifa District Prosecution subpoenaed Sunday 12 of Shfaram's residents to a pre-trial hearing in connection with the killing of IDF soldier Eden Natan Zada.\n\nZada, a military deserter, boarded a bus in Shfaram in August of 2005 and began shooting its passengers, killing four people and wounding nine, before he was apprehended by some of the passengers.

The Israeli government condemned the random shooting and mobilized troops in anticipation of rioting in northern Israel.\n\nM16 assault rifle\n\nThe attacker, Eden Natan-Zada, 19, boarded Egged bus 165 en route from Haifa and sat mid-section. When the bus, carrying about 10\u201315 passengers, neared the bus stop at the center of the Druze neighborhood of the predominantly Israeli Arab town of Shefa-Amr in lower Galilee, Natan-Zada, walked to the front. When the bus stopped he shot the driver in the head with his M16 and began systematically firing as passengers crouched behind seats. He repeatedly shot Hazar Turki, 23 and her sister, Dina, 21, apparently to make sure they were dead.\n\nAs Natan-Zada was reloading his rifle and a young girl pleaded with him to spare her, Ahayal Jahnawi, 28 began struggling with the gunman. He succeeded in pinning Natan-Zada to the floor until the crowd broke into the bus. At first the mob mistook Jahnawi for the perpetrator and began pummeling him. They then began kicking and hurling objects at Natan-Zada. The security officer of Shefa-Amr, Jamal Aliam reportedly told Army Radio that Zada had been attacked by dozens after he had been handcuffed and subdued by police. Police were unable to control the mob, which wounded 5 officers. Magen David Adom ambulances evacuated the wounded to Rambam Medical Center in Haifa.\n\nNatan-Zada had been absent without leave from his army unit since mid-June after refusing to participate in preparations for the Gaza pullout. He moved to Kfar Tapuach, a West Bank Jewish settlement dominated by the militant Kach movement. His father Yitzhak Natan-Zada urged Eden to return his weapon and informed the army that his son was dangerous. Eden's mother Debbie, speaking from the family home in Rishon LeZion was told that someone must be AWOL for 45 days to be officially considered a deserter and was advised to go herself to Kfar Tapuah to disarm her son.\n\nEden had recently become more fanatical and encountered writings on the Internet about revenge and zealots in Judaism published by the outlawed terrorist Kach group in The Way of the Torah.
