I hope you enjoyed the read.\n\nJR: Very much so! How has the response to The Facts of My Life been so far?\n\nCR: Everyone feels that I'm actually talking to them; that it's very intimate and very honest. People tell me that they read it straight through, and that they have really gotten involved with it. I've gotten lots of letters and lots of e-mails. People seem to have enjoyed it very much... and I hope you did too!\n\nJR: Oh, yes! As a child of the '80's, I grew up with The Facts of Life. I watched it religiously when it was on-- as did a lot of other people, obviously! The show and all the characters really made their mark on American pop culture. But in the book, we learn that it was actually a long, hard road to your success on TV. There were the endless auditions, and the previous TV shows that didn't quite make it, and a lot of small acting jobs along the way. When The Facts of Life became a success, did you finally believe, \"Wow! This is the reward for all my hard work. The moment has finally come!\"?\n\nCR: Yeah! I was very grateful. It was a beautiful experience. The girls were really quite terrific. (Laughs) I mean, they were going through puberty! Today they say, \"Oh my God! What we put you through!\" (Laughs) I felt like \"the old horse\". I was very patient. They were going through what they had to go through, but they were good girls. And now that they are women, we are still very close-- especially Nancy McKeon, who played Jo; and Lisa Whelchel, who played Blair; and Kim Fields, who played Tootie. It's \"woman to woman\" now. We talk about children, and about life... and it's quite marvelous that we've been bonded all these years. They're grown up, in their 40's and 50's. It's amazing, isn't it?\n\nJR: Yes it is! And, The Facts of Life is still being shown on cable TV, 28 years later. People really loved your Mrs. Garrett. She was a motherly figure and a great role model for the girls, but it was rare that she out-and-out told them what to do; She instead tried to get them to figure out the right thing to do on their own! She guided them.\n\nCR: Right! She only talked about and shared her own experiences. She really didn't want to give advice. She didn't want to be one of \"those\" people! You know what I mean?\n\nJR: Yes! So, as we were talking about, it was a long road to becoming Edna Garrett. Early in the book you wrote about how at one time, in your theater days, you went from being in two shows at the same time to being unemployed.\n\nCS: You got it! Being an actor is not like any other job. It's not easy. I felt like a hooker! (Both laugh) You never know when your next job is going to come along.\n\nJR: Does it ever get annoying for you when people see you on the street and yell out, \"MRS. GAR-RETT!\"?\n\nCR: I don't mind. I don't mind at all. When I used to go to New York, I'd sometimes take the subway. I don't do it anymore! (Laughs) I just celebrated my 90th birthday, so I'm not like a little gazelle anymore, going up and down those stairs like that! But I remember coming up the stairs of the subway at 77nd Street, and I bumped into this big, tall, handsome guy. I looked at him, and then we embraced each other without saying a word. And then he went down to the subway. So, I love it all. I don't mind it. No, no, no! If people had a positive experience with Mrs. Garrett, that makes me so happy!\n\nJR: Wow! That's so good to hear. So, when a lot of people read a celebrity autobiography, they may expect a lot of, shall we say, \"dish\" about other celebrities, or an expose of show business. I didn't really notice that with your book. On the contrast, you seem to really make a point how wonderful and supportive most people were...\n\nCR: I'm very glad that you noticed that. I didn't want to do that. I just wanted to celebrate the people that I love. As for the people who were difficult, I didn't see any point in trying to put them down. I say, \"God bless them\".... and I stay away from them!\n\nJR: (Laughs)\n\nCR: But I really do \"let it all hang out\". I really do tell it all, don't I?\n\nJR: Yes! You are very open about your life, and how there was a lot of heartbreak along the way. You talk about your sons: Larry Strauss, who I see you co-wrote the book with...\n\nCR: Yes! The book never even would have been written if he hadn't been like, \"Mom, you're 87, and I think it's time you wrote your memoirs!\" I said, \"I can't do it. I'm not a writer!\" He answered back, \"Well, I am!\" He's written many beautiful novels and other things. He said, \"You tell me about it, and I'll write it.\" I thought to myself, \"I'm not just gonna make this a boring 'And then I did this... and then I did this... and then I got this award and then I got that award...'\" Then, I thought that it wouldn't do any harm to tell people that my life, like most lives, has been full of a lot of \"stuff\". Some of it has been fabulous and great. Some of it has been really tough. So I tell them about my son Andy who was autistic. There was nothing about autism in those days. Nothing! No one even knew what it was. When the doctor said that he was autistic, I thought he said, \"artistic\". I was like, \"Thank God. He's just a little offbeat, a little artistic. It's OK.\"\n\nJR: You said, \"It runs in the family!\"\n\nCR: Yeah! Anyway, that was a long, long thing... I think we did well with him. My husband John, my son Larry, and I did everything possible to make his life as good as can be. God bless him. He passed at the age of 45. And then, there was the alcoholism. I've been a member of Alcoholics Anonymous for 42 years, and it's really saved me. I was going through so much anguish. My drug of choice to go to sleep was alcohol. I found the program, and it's been simply wonderful. I'm still hanging in there with it. I also talk about my husband John. He found the program too. I was his little channel-- his angel to find it. I loved him dearly, and then he finally told me that he was bisexual. That was a blow. But we continued to have a beautiful relationship even after the divorce. I loved him until the day he passed. He was a good dad and a tremendously creative man.\n\nJR: You went through a lot of emotionally rough circumstances in life, especially with raising Andy. The whole time, you were working one job after another to support your family-- not like a celebrity who was working just to buy a third Rolls Royce, for example. What gave you the strength to get through all those rough times?\n\nCR: I do believe that there is some power higher than me. I'm not a religious freak, but I do believe that there is a higher power. Obviously I've pulled through so many things. I was going to give up acting and just devote myself to Andy-- and then I found this wonderful woman named Elsbeth Pfeiffer who worked at Bank Street School. She had worked with Anna Freud. She used to come to the Bellevue Deviant Children's Ward. They called it the \"Deviant Children's Ward\". Isn't that awful? I used to bring him to Bellevue every day to be with Elsbeth. She was one of God's little angels who supported me. She said to me, in her German accent, \"It's not your fault, Mrs. Strauss! No, no, no!\" She always made me feel like I was doing all the good things, and she said, \"No, you mustn't give up your work! It is very important that you continue with your work. It will be very helpful for you and your spirit... and for your son.\" All along the way, there were people there always being supportive. God's little angels, I call them. I still think they are around. Don't you find that sometimes?\n\nJR: Absolutely! As the song says, we get by with a little help from our friends!\n\nCR: And as another song says, \"I'm Still Here!\"\n\nJR: Yes! So, in the book, you also write about some moments in television history that are now lost. One of those was the controversial 1975 series The Hot L Baltimore. You wrote about how Norman Lear told you that this was his favorite TV show of all. Sadly, it appears that the show is truly lost. It's not on video, and isn't shown on TV anymore. It would be great if we could watch you on that show once again. You wrote about how you had a great time working on it.\n\nCR: Yes, I remember. It was a wonderful show. Before there were any other shows that had gay people, this show had a beautiful episode about the gay couple at the hotel. They were celebrating their anniversary. Two of the show's main characters-- the hotel manager and the hooker-- were having trouble relating with each other. They were always quarreling with each other and having a terrible time. In contrast, the gay couple were celebrating their anniversary with such dignity and grace. Norman Lear handled it so beautifully. It was way ahead of its time. I always told Norman that I thought he did such a magnificent job. I wish you could see it! Too bad you can't. That was a great show.\n\nJR: Damn!\n\nCR: I did a lot of wonderful things for Norman. I did a lot of wonderful theater too. I did a Samuel Beckett play called Happy Days at the Mark Taper Forum in L.A. It was a wonderful part. A challenging part. Then they took me to CSC Repertory Theater to do it in New York. It was just a wonderful experience. Recently, I did a Beckett play at The Kirk Douglas Theater in L.A., called Endgame. My name was Nell, and I was in an ash can! (Laughs) I'm just so grateful that I've been able to do all these wonderful things. In the book, I also talk about playing at all these supper clubs-- the Blue Angel, and the Village Vanguard...\n\nJR: ... which is still there!\n\nCR: Yes! My experience with Sheldon Harnick, and how I led him to New York, is also in the book. I was his channel! He wrote Fiddler on the Roof and She Loves Me and so many other shows. I talk about all the people in my life: Cloris Leachman, Paul Lynde...\n\nJR: While we are on that subject: Was there a fellow performer in the business who you really felt a special bond with? A real true friend?\n\nCR: Quite a few. But the one I really felt a bond with was Charles Durning. We did a play together called In The Boom Boom Room. He passed a couple of years ago. We were real buddies. We played mother and father to a girl named Chrissy, played by Madeline Kahn. She's gone now too. It was a fascinating play. We were friends forever. So many of the people who I played opposite, or just worked with, became friends forever. One of them is Marilyn Maye. I adore her. We admire each other enormously. Jo Anne Worley and I started a group called \"Ladies Who Lunch\". We get together once a month. We're going to lunch today, in fact! It's me, and Jo Anne, and Millicent Martin, and Anne Jeffreys, and Miriam Nelson. It's just a joy to get together once a month, and laugh, and have a great time!\n\nJR: Wow! With that group of ladies, how could you not have fun? I'm jealous! So, what else do you do in your spare time, when you're not working?\n\nCR: I have a granddaughter Carly. She's in her 20's. She teaches art. I have a grandson Sean. He's 15 and a junior in high school, and interested in making movies and making music for movies. I live in California and try to get to New York twice a year: in May and in October. It's a beautiful life. I'm just grateful. I'm a survivor of pancreatic cancer. I don't know... I'm just a lucky lady!\n\nJR: Is there a romantic interest in your life right now?\n\nCR: Uhm... no! (Laughs) I'm in love with everyone! (Laughs)\n\nJR: That's a great thing. So, lastly, is there anything else you'd like to tell your fans?\n\nCR: You can get the book at Amazon! (Laughs) That's about it. Oh, wait... I'd also tell them to live one day at a time. All we have is today. Just live it. We don't know about tomorrow. So, enjoy the day. Love yourself, and spread love around. Sometimes I'm in an elevator and I'll say something cheerful, even if I don't know anybody in the elevator. What the heck? Everyone can use a little love, right?\n\nJR: Absolutely! Thank you again, Ms. Rae. And have a great time at lunch with the ladies!"}, {"url": "https://www.emmys.com/shows/one-day-time", "page_content": "Camera\n\nThe cast and creators of One Day at a Time at The Power of TV: A Conversation with Norman Lear and One Day at a Time, presented by the Television Academy Foundation and Netflix in celebration of the Foundation's 20th Anniversary of THE INTERVIEWS: An Oral History Project, on Monday, June 19, 2017 in the Wolf Theatre at the Saban Media Center in North Hollywood, California.\n\nInvision/AP"}, {"url": "https://www.sitcomsonline.com/dswhere.html", "page_content": "Diff'rent Strokes: Biographies/Where are They Now?\n\nThis section contains the most recent picture of each cast member that I could find along with what they have done since Diff'rent Strokes ended as well as biographical information when available.

Wryly humorous Canadian character actor Conrad Bain was all wrapped up in such athletic pursuits as hockey and speed skating when, in his junior year of high school, he suddenly became fascinated with acting. He studied at Alberta's Banff School of Fine Arts, served in the Canadian army during World War II, then resumed his training at New York's American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He worked at the Stratford (Ontario) Shakespeare Festival and in live television before scoring his first real success in the 1956 Broadway revival of Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh. In the early 1970s, Bain began popping up in such New York-based films as Lovers and Other Strangers (1970) and Woody Allen's Bananas (1973). He gained national fame in the TV role of stuffy next-door neighbor Dr. Arthur Harmon on the Norman Lear sitcom Maude (1974-78).\n\nHe has basically retired from the business since Diff'rent Strokes ended in 1986. In 1987, he was in the short-lived Fox series, Mr. President, where he was the chief advisor to George C. Scott in the series. He appeared as the grandpa in the 1990 movie, Postcards from the Edge. In addition, he did a guest shot as Mr. Drummond on a May 20, 1996 episode of the \"Fresh Prince of Bel Air\" along with Gary Coleman.\n\nIn 2004, he was interviewed for the special features for the first season DVD release of Diff'rent Strokes.\n\nHe died of natural causes on January 14, 2014, at a retirement home in Livermore, California. Mr. Bain was 89.\n\nRemembering Conrad Bain\n\ninsanely large scan of a Conrad Bain autographed photo\n\nGary Coleman\n\n\n\nGary Coleman was born February 8, 1968 in Zion, Illinois. Adopted as an infant, his father worked for a pharmaceutical firm and his mother was a nurse. Before reaching the age of 5, Coleman had undergone three operations for a congenital kidney defect known as nephritis. As a result of his medical condition, he would never grow any taller than 4'8\". His smallness proved to be a professional advantage when he began appearing in Chicago-area TV commercials; even at the age of 9, he could still pass as a precocious five-year-old. In 1978, Coleman auditioned for a proposed television revival of the old Little Rascals comedy series. Though the project fell through, ABC chief executive Fred Silverman was enchanted by the talented tyke. Silverman cast Coleman as Arnold Jackson on the upcoming sitcom Diff'rent Strokes, which moved to NBC along with Silverman in the fall of 1978. It was this extraordinarily popular series, coupled with the precocious Coleman's spirited TV talk show appearances, that catapulted the 10-year-old to stardom. Within a year of Diff'rent Strokes' debut, Gary Coleman Productions was formed, for the purpose of starring the youngster in theatrical features like On the Right Track (1981) and made-for-TV movies like Scout's Honor (1980) and The Kid With the Broken Halo (1982). This last project was spun off into the Saturday-morning cartoon series The Gary Coleman Show (1983), with Coleman providing his own voice. An instinctive comic performer and extremely quick study, Coleman rapidly grew weary with the rigors of show business. As he grew older, Coleman's spontaneous cuteness faded. After the cancellation of Diff'rent Strokes in 1986, Coleman found the going decidedly rough. Occasionally he'd play a \"stunt\" part like a villainous gang leader on the TV series 227, but his short stature and ever-diminishing acting range made him difficult to cast. He still remained in the public eye, albeit as the central character in a bitter legal squabble between himself and his parents. Gary retired to Colorado in 1986 after Diff'rent Strokes was cancelled to a 6 bedroom - 3,500 square feet home. After leaving Colorado he lived briefly in Tucson, Arizona and worked at Tucson Hobby Shop because he is/was an active model railroader. More recently, he has reappeared in Hollywood. He has appeared in a few movies recently, Party (1994) and S.F.W. (1994). He appeared in Norm MacDonald's movie Dirty Work. He was the voice of Kenny Falmouth in a cd-rom video game from Lucas Arts called \"The Curse of Monkey Island\". He sued his adoptive parents and his former manager for mishandling his funds in 1989 and was awarded 1.3 million dollars. More recently, he has made guest appearances on television series such as Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Married with Children, Homeboys in Outer Space, The Keenen Ivory Wayans Show, and Mad TV. He was supposed to have a series sometime in 1992 after he did a guest shot on Geraldo, but the pilot did not sell and the project was scrapped. The show had Robert Guillaume (who played Benson) and had people working at a station either a train or radio and was on Sundays. It didn't last long and Gary was supposed to have the part that Robert had. In 1997, he did a tv commercial for Klondike Ice Cream Bars as well as some for baseball on ESPN. His favorite car is a Hummer. He made an appearance on Vibe (a talk show hosted by Sinbad) along with Todd Bridges and Dana Plato on November 6th, 1997. He co-starred with Harry Hamlin in holiday TV-movie on cable's Fox Family Channel called 'Like Father, Like Santa'. On July 30th, he allledgly struck a woman who asked for his autograph, a court hearing was held August 25th where he pleaded not guilty. He recently finished a movie with Todd Bridges. He has worked as a security guard, a job he is trained to do. Recently, he was a corporate spokesperson and director of promotions for HoloWorld Cafe (a restaurant with laser-tag and video games) in Pasadena, California. Gary also was a co-host of The Reel Show on the site Reelpreviews.com. He appeared in Kid Rock's \"Cowboy\" video. In October 1999, he was hired as an intern/on-air personality show Mojo and Betsy In the Morning for 93.7 KRQ in Tucson, AZ. He was in the first episode of Shasta McNasty (Shasta) in September 1999 and voiced himself in the classic Christmas episode of The Simpsons in December 1999. He wrote a weekly advice column for UGO the Coleman Confidential. Coleman also played himself in the 2001 Scooby-Doo parody, Night of the Living Doo, produced by the Cartoon Network. In 2001, Coleman was employed as a shopping mall security guard in the Los Angeles area. A surveillance video of Coleman trying to stop a vehicle from entering the mall while the driver ridiculed him was broadcast on numerous television shows. Coleman played a supporting role in the controversial 2003 computer game Postal\u02db by Running With Scissors, Inc. Coleman, who played himself, appeared at a shopping mall, and one of the game's objectives was to secure his autograph. Coleman's role was almost certainly based on a 1998 incident in which Coleman punched a fan who sought his autograph while he was at a shopping mall. Upon the player securing his autograph, police storm the mall to arrest him for an unknown crime, which leads to a violent shootout. Coleman was also featured prominently in the 2005 expansion pack to Postal\u02db, Apocalypse Weekend. Coleman was a candidate for governor in the 2003 California recall election. This campaign was sponsored by the free newsweekly the East Bay Express as a satirical comment on the recall. After Arnold Schwarzenegger announced his candidacy, Coleman stated that he would be voting for Schwarzenegger. Coleman placed 8th in a field of 135 candidates, receiving 14,242 votes. Coleman was featured in the 2004 season of The Surreal Life. He managed the restaurant at which the other cast members worked. Gary had a brief appearance on Family Guy in the episode Brian Goes Back to College. He had replaced Stewie since he owed him a favor. Coleman has also appeared in a clip of Robot Chicken. Coleman occasionally is able to cash in on his camp value to members of Generation X, by appearing in cameo roles in film and TV. As with Day-Glo, Rubik's Cube, Valley girls, Care Bears, Mr. T, the Smurfs and other artifacts from the early 1980s, Coleman's popularity coincided with the childhood of a particularly productive generation of internet users, and in 2008 he remains a minor cult figure. During 2006 and 2007, Coleman appeared in commercials for a cash-advance loan company called CashCall. He ends the commercial by saying, \"Pay your bills on time and everyone will love you.\" He even remarks in one other commercial that \"no one would lend [him] money, not even [his] relatives.\" Coleman secretly wed his girlfriend of five months, Shannon Price, 22, on August 28, 2007. They met on the set of the 2006 comedy film Church Ball.\n\nPhoto of Gary Coleman and Todd Bridges on Vibe\n\n\n\nTodd Bridges\n\n\n\nTodd Bridges was born May 27, 1965 in San Francisco, CA. He has had more than his share of personal problems since Diff'rent Strokes left the air in 1986. In 1990, he was acquitted on charges of assault with a deadly weapon after he shot an alleged crack dealer. In 1993, he pleaded guilty to drug possession and carrying a loaded weapon. In January of 1997, he was arrested after allegedly ramming a friends car with his own after an argument. Despite these problems, he has managed to appear in several movies (Busted, Homeboys, and The Sounds of Silence) and he made an appearance in episode of L.A. Heat (1996). More recently, he is trying to get on with his life and start over. He finished several movies recently including The Last Stand (with Scott Valentine and Martin Cole), Busted (with Corey Feldman), and Lunchtime Specials (directed by Soleil-Moon Frye/Punky Brewster). He produced, directed, and wrote a movie with his brother Jimmy that featured several of his family members called 'Building Bridges' in 2000. Bridges has traveled the U.S. speaking to over 6,000 kids per day in schools and churches discussing the dangers of drug use and negative peer pressure, and promoting his Christian religious beliefs. In 2001, Bridges rescued a woman who fell from her wheelchair while she was fishing. He appeared as a contestant on the Fox reality show Skating with Celebrities, but was eliminated on the second episode of the show. Bridges defeated Vanilla Ice on a 2002 episode of Celebrity Boxing. Additionally, Todd Bridges appeared along with Gary Coleman and Vanilla Ice on a VH-1's celebrity-reality show The Surreal Life. (Coleman was featured in the 2004 season of The Surreal Life where he managed a restaurant at which the other cast members worked, and after Todd Bridges appeared, was encouraged by Vanilla Ice to say \"What'chu talkin' 'bout, Willis?\" much to his dismay and disapproval resulting in Coleman leaving the restaurant.) He appeared as a contestant on a 2006 celebrity episode of the Fear Factor, but was eliminated after the first stunt. In January 2007, he appeared as a member of the \"mob\" on the US version of the game show 1 vs. 100. He was eliminated on the first question after failing to correctly answer the question, \"Which month has an extra day during a leap year?\" He appeared on MyNetworkTV's new show, Decision House with his wife, Dori Bridges on the episode titled, 'Burned Bridges' aired on November 14th, 2007. He married Dori Smith (pictured above) on March 25, 1998. He and his wife had their first child on July 15th, 1998 a boy named Spencer Todd Bridges. Click here to read about it.

She came to fame as a child star but found out soon enough that early fame often has its own pitfalls. Best known as Kimberly Drummond, the older sister on TV's \"Diff'rent Strokes,\" Dana went through a lot while never quite escaping the scrutiny of the media and fans. Dana Michele Plato was born in Maywood, California on November 7, 1964. Her birth mother (Linda Strain who was a 16-year-old unwed mother already struggling to support an 18-month-old child) gave her up for adoption as an infant and she was taken in by a Southern California couple (adopted by Dean and Florine 'Kay' Plato in June 1965) who soon enough guided her into acting. Dana landed roles on over 100 TV commercials as a child, including appearances for KFC, Arco and Dole bananas. Her questionable luck kicked in early on -- Dana was chosen for the lead role in \"The Exorcist\" but her adoptive mother refused to let her appear in such a film. So while Linda Blair went on to huge stardom, Dana was left with roles in flicks like 1975's \"Beyond the Bermuda Triangle.\" (Dana did grab a small part in \"Exorcist II: The Heretic,\" a film that has been voted one of the worst of all time.) Dana's fortunes began to turn when she was spotted by a producer during a brief appearance on TV's \"The Gong Show.\" He was casting a new sitcom for NBC which was to become \"Diff'rent Strokes,\" and Dana landed the part of Kimberly. Her girl-next-door cuteness and seemingly effortless way with comedy won her lots of fans during the show's prime time run, which lasted from 1978 to 1986. Dana moved in with rock guitarist Lanny Lambert in December 1983. In April 1984, she married Lanny and on July 2nd, 1984 their son Tyler Edward Lambert was born. Dana was fired from Diff'rent Strokes after the 1983-1984 season because of her pregnancy, but she did return for the final season on ABC in 1985-1986. By the time the program was cancelled, Dana had blossomed into a striking young woman, but her acting career could never escape the long shadows cast by her sitcom stardom. Dana's mother, Florine 'Kay' Plato, who had guided her career died of a blood disease in January of 1988 and her husband reportedly left her the same week. Dana and Lanny would divorce in March of 1990 and Dana was allowed visitation of her son, but her husband won physical custody of Tyler. Dana drifted in and out of the business over the next few years. She posed for a June 1989 pictorial in Playboy (a 5-page nude layout, the shots were taken in November 1988 in Arizona), showing off the delectable figure that she'd kept hidden for all those years. The nude pictorial did nothing to help revive her career, though, and Dana continued to languish on the fringes of the entertainment industry. She blasted her way back into the headlines in January of 1992, when she was arrested for the armed robbery of a Las Vegas video store (which she used a pellet gun and netted her $164) - she was charged with armed robbery and was later sentenced to five years probation. Her ill-conceived grab for rent money (it was really a cry for help according to many people) sent her to jail for a short stint, but her new notoriety managed to get her work in the \"no publicity is bad publicity\" world of Hollywood. Dana was helped by Las Vegas singer, Wayne Newton, who posted the $13,000 bail for her. In January of 1992 she was arrested for forging Valium prescriptions. Cited for parole violation, she served 30 days in jail. In 1993, she spent a month in a drug and alcohol rehab center in Las Vegas - one of several times she went into rehab. Following her jail term, Dana appeared in a string of B-grade features including such sterling gems as 1992's \"Bikini Beach Race\" and 1995's \"Compelling Evidence.\" She was featured in a video game in 1992 called Night Trap as a scantily clad victim. In 1995, she was in a play called \"Last of the Red Hot Lovers\" where she received passing grades. Her experiences behind bars also seemed to change more than just her career prospects -- Dana came out as a lesbian in a 1998 issue of the Sapphic pride magazine \"Girlfriends.\" (she had said in more recent interviews that she was not a lesbian and was only experimenting). She turned plenty of heads with her scintillating performance in the 1997 straight-to-video epic \"Different Strokes.\" It's a steamy softcore tale of a guy and a girl and another girl, and Dana shows off her curvaceous figure and lust for her fellow femmes in a series of sensual scenes. Sadly and tragically, she died of a prescription drug overdose on May 8th, 1999. According to Sgt. Scott Singer of the Moore (Oklahoma) Police Dept., \"At this point, we having nothing against Robert Menchaca (her fiance at the time of her death). But the statute of limitations does not run out on deaths for seven years. So if the police do get evidence that Robert is guilty by criminal negligence or actual participation, we will certainly prosecute.\" She will live on in our hearts forever, and will be sorely missed.

Dody Goodman (Aunt Sophia) Dies at 93 Dody Goodman died June 22, 2008 at Englewood (N.J.) Hospital and Medical Center. The actress had been ill for some time and had lived in the Actors Fund Home in Englewood since October. Goodman gained a measure of newspaper column space for her dancing solos in such '40s Broadway musicals as High Button Shoes and Wonderful Town. In 1955, she stopped the show in Off Broadway's Shoestring Revue with the novelty song \"Someone's Been Sending Me Flowers.\" She came to the attention of nighttime talkshow host Jack Paar, who after becoming enchanted by Goodman's ditzy persona and seemingly spontaneous malaprops, invited the lady to become a semi-regular on The Tonight Show. As Goodman's fame grew, she became difficult to handle on the show, and Paar was not happy with her upstaging habits. So she left show and appeared on other talk shows such as The Merv Griffin Show. She returned to Broadway in 1974 to appear in Lorelei with Carol Channing. Then in 1975 she played Louise Lasser's mother on the comedy-soap Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman. Her high-pitched voice could be also heard announcing the show's title at the beginning of each episode. She appeared on the spin-off Forever Fernwood as well. She was also famous in the '80s for her recurring role as Aunt Sophia on the '80s sitcom Diff'rent Strokes. Goodman also provided the voice of Miss Miller on the animated series Alvin & the Chipmunks and various specials and movies such as The Chipmunk Adventure.

She appeared in such popular films as Grease, Grease 2, playing Blanche (the principal's assistant), and in the movie Splash and Splash, Too. Both movie franchises are very memorable and she was a big part of them. She will certainly be missed by Broadway fans, TV fans, and movie fans as she had big roles in each.

He was able to get me a guest spot on 227 and a Doritos commercial. This was during the time when Gary was suing his parents, manager and other financial advisors. The manager in turn left the business and I never pursued other representation. I stopped acting for several years. Not sure what I wanted to do next, I took part-time jobs in retail during my later high school years. I went to college for a year, but found it wasn't for me. I was able to make some contacts in the entertainment industry and landed a job as a personal assistant for Yvette Lee Bowser who was a producer for 'A Different World'. During my time there, I performed as guest cast for one episode, which I decided wasn't for me anymore. My next job was as stage production assistant on 'Living Single'. I enjoyed working behind the scenes. Fortunately, Warner Bros. Studios had a spot open in their directors guild program which I landed. From there I began my career as a stage manager / assistant director, which I'm still working as today. (Living Single, Wayan's Brothers, Sunset Beach, Hype, The Berne Mac Show, The Tracy Morgan Show, and various others). Thanks for your interest in me.

She received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy in 1982. She also appeared in two Facts of Life television movies: The Facts of Life Goes to Paris in 1982 and The Facts of Life Reunion in 2001. She also provided the voice of Nanny in the cartoon 101 Dalmatians: The Series.\n\nEarly life\n\nShe was born Charlotte Rae Lubotsky in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Russian Jewish immigrants Esther (n\u00e9e Ottenstein), who was a childhood friend of Golda Meir, and Meyer Lubotsky, a retail tire business owner. She had two sisters (Miriam, a pianist, writer, and composer, and Beverly, an opera singer), and graduated from Shorewood High School in 1944. At the same high school where Charlotte attended, she had a best friend simply called \"Natalie,\" (whom she created the character for future co-star, Mindy Cohn, to play on The Facts of Life). For the first ten years of her life, Rae's family lived in Milwaukee, after which they moved to Shorewood, Wisconsin, not that far from where she was born. In a 2002 interview, Charlotte said she was interested in acting as a little girl. She did a lot of radio work and was with the Wauwatosa Children's Theatre. At 16, she was an apprentice with the Port Players, a professional theater company that came for the summer to Milwaukee, with several established actors such as Morton DaCosta, who was the director of The Music Man on Broadway. She said that she had great teachers at her high school, which also had a beautiful campus. Rae attended but did not complete her studies at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where she met Cloris Leachman, who would not just become best friends for life, but roommates, who in turn replaced Rae on The Facts of Life, for the last 2 seasons. At the same college, she also met several unknown stars and producers such as: Agnes Nixon, Charlton Heston, Paul Lynde, and songwriter, Sheldon Harnick. Rae sang to honour Harnick at a benefit, years after her days in college. Each summer, while attending college, she also appeared its annual student theatrical extravaganza, the Waa-Mu Show. She also did some stock before she became an actress.\n\nWhen a radio personality told her that her last name wouldn't do, she dropped it, becoming simply Charlotte Rae. She moved to New York City in 1948, where she performed in the theater and nightclubs. During her early years in New York, she worked at the Village Vanguard (alongside up-and-coming talents such as singer Richard Dyer-Bennett) and at the posh Blue Angel, home to budding talents Barbra Streisand, Mike Nichols and Elaine May. She moved to Los Angeles in 1974.\n\nPopular stage actress and singer\n\nA stage actress since the 1950s, she appeared in Three Wishes for Jamie, The Threepenny Opera with Bea Arthur, Li'l Abner, and Pickwick. In 1955 she released her first (and only) solo album, Songs I Taught My Mother, which featured \"silly, sinful, and satirical\" songs by (among others) Sheldon Harnick, Vernon Duke, John La Touche, Cole Porter, Rodgers & Hart, and Marc Blitzstein (who wrote the song \"Modest Maid\" especially for Rae). The album was issued on CD in 2006 by PS Classics. Also in the 1950s, Rae made several acclaimed appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show.\n\nShe appeared in Ben Bagley's revue The Littlest Revue (and on its cast album) in 1956, appearing alongside the likes of Joel Grey and Tammy Grimes and singing songs by Sheldon Harnick (\"The Shape of Things\"), Vernon Duke (\"Summer is a-Comin' In\"), and Charles Strouse & Lee Adams (\"Spring Doth Let Her Colours Fly,\" a parody of opera singer Helen Traubel's Las Vegas night club act), among others. Rae also later appeared on Bagley's studio recording Rodgers & Hart Revisited with Dorothy Loudon, Cy Young, and Arthur Siegel, singing \"Everybody Loves You (When You're Asleep)\" and in several other duets and ensembles.\n\nRae received 2 Tony Award nominations during her Broadway career. The first in 1966 for Best Featured Actress in a Musical in 'Pickwick' (losing to Bea Arthur from 'Mame'). The second came in 1969 for Best Actress in a play for 'Morning, Noon and Night' (losing to Julie Harris in 'Forty Carats').\n\nPopular character actress\n\nIn 1954, Rae on her way to becoming a top-notch character actress, made her TV debut on an episode of Look Up and Live. This led to roles on other shows such as The United States Steel Hour, Armstrong Circle Theatre, Kraft Television Theatre, NBC Television Opera Theatre, The Philco Television Playhouse, The Colgate Comedy Hour (where she first became friends with a unknown producer Norman Lear), The DuPont Show of the Week, The Phil Silvers Show, Way Out, The Defenders, Temperatures Rising, The Love Boat, The Partridge Family, Love, American Style, McMillan & Wife, Barney Miller, 227, Murder, She Wrote, St. Elsewhere, Diagnosis: Murder, among many others. She also guest-starred on Norman Lear's All in the Family and Good Times.\n\nTV roles\n\nHer first significant success was on the sitcom Car 54, Where Are You? (1961\u20131963), in which she played Sylvia Schnauser, the wife of Officer Leo Schnauser (played by Al Lewis). She was nominated for an Emmy Award for her supporting role in the 1975 drama Queen of the Stardust Ballroom. In January 1975, Rae became a cast member on the ABC television comedy Hot l Baltimore, wherein she played Mrs. Bellotti, whose dysfunctional adult son Moose, who was never actually seen, lived at the hotel. Mrs. Bellotti, who was a bit odd herself, would visit Moose and then laugh about all the odd situations that Moose would get into with the others living at the hotel. Rae also appeared in early seasons of Sesame Street as Molly the Mail Lady. In 1960, she appeared in a commercial for the National Oil Fuel Institute in which, while taking a shower, she explained how wonderful oil heat was. At the end of the commercial, the announcer asked her if she knew she was on television, to which she responded, in her usual \"trying to be sexy\" voice, \"Yes, I know!\" and then giggled softly afterward.\n\nDiff'rent Strokes & The Facts of Life\n\nIn 1978, NBC was losing to both CBS and ABC in sitcom ratings, and Fred Silverman, future producer and former head of CBS, ABC, and NBC, insisted that Norman Lear produce Diff'rent Strokes. Knowing that Rae was one of Lear's favorite actresses, he hired her immediately for the role of housekeeper Edna Garrett, and she co-starred with Conrad Bain in all 24 episodes of the first season. Her character proved to be so popular that producers decided to do an episode that could lead to a spinoff. That episode (called \"The Girls School\") was about girls attending Eastland, the school attended by Kimberly (played by the late Dana Plato). In July 1979, Rae proposed the idea for the new spinoff to the heads of NBC. They greenlighted the show, and thus The Facts of Life was born. The program, which focused on a housemother residing with four young ladies in a prestigious private school, dealt with many of the major issues facing teenage girls in the 1980s, including weight loss, depression, AIDS, drugs, alcohol, autism, cerebral palsy, dating, and marriage. The show wasn't an immediate hit, but thanks to a new time slot the show became a ratings winner between 1980 and 1986. Midway throughout both the 1984-85 and 1985-86 seasons, she missed several episodes, all because she was planning on leaving the show, while at the same time, the storylines focused more on the girls, in lieu of Mrs. Garrett. At the beginning of the eighth season, Rae left the show despite all the fame she had gained, owing to a health problem. (She later returned to the stage, displeasing the show's producers.) At the beginning of the 1986-1987 season, her character was written out as having gotten remarried and joined the Peace Corps. Cloris Leachman was then brought in as Mrs. Garrett's sister, Beverly Ann Stickle, for the show's last two years. In 1988, after 209 episodes, The Facts of Life was canceled.\n\nAlso starring on Facts were a lot of unfamiliar actresses/actors who were only on the first season before being fired, including Felice Schachter as Nancy Olson, Julie Piekarski as Sue Ann Weaver, Julie Ann Haddock as Cindy Webster, Molly Ringwald as Molly Parker, and John Lawlor as Steven Bradley. In addition, the show cast more unfamiliar actresses who also appeared on the spinoff show, Diff'rent Strokes, consisting of former Mouseketeer Lisa Whelchel as rich spoiled brat Blair Warner and Kim Fields as resident gossip Dorothy \"Tootie\" Ramsey. Rae approached a 13-year-old unknown Mindy Cohn at Westlake School in Los Angeles, California and suggested that she take the role of smart Natalie Green. The second season introduced another unfamiliar star, Nancy McKeon as the tomboy Jo, who stayed on for the entire run. During the show's seventh season, two new stars, George Clooney and Mackenzie Astin, joined the cast. During the show's first season, the entire cast didn't get along with Rae, by the time the second season was renewed after 5 actors were fired, when Nancy was brought in as the only replacement girl, the entire cast actually had a lot of fun, esp. Cohn.\n\nDuring the show's eight season run, while Rae was playing her role for 7 of 9 seasons, she was nominated only once for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 1982, but didn't win.\n\nMindy Cohn who said about being hired to playing Natalie, after Charlotte talked her into it was, \"The next day, I get a call from the Headmasters\u2019 office and saying, \u2018These people want to talk to you,\u2019 and Charlotte said, \u2018I\u2019m falling madly in love with you, I want to create a role for you on the show. We\u2019re going to call you [Natalie], and do you want to do this?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know! I mean 8th grade lady, what do I know? Is this going to mess up with my tennis team schedule, you know?\u2019\" The last thing Cohn responded as to why Charlotte Rae really wanting to leave the show was, \"One of the reasons she left was because this show is really started to focused on the girls, the pull of the show started to be different of her, she sorta felt like \u2018I\u2019m done!\u2019\" Rae and Cohn are currently close friends with the other cast. Beverly Ann's (Charlotte's real-life sister, who named Cloris Leachman's character on The Facts of Life, after her) death in 1998, drew the relationship closer between Rae, Cohn, and other cast members.

First of all my younger Sister was a bed wetter into her early teens. I also witnessed the frustration and humiliation while attending sleep-away camp in the Catskill Mountains. Sharing a cabin with bed wetting bunk mates who were harassed to no end by their peers. This condition of bed wetting is referred to as Nocturnal Enuresis. A deep sleep pattern by the child who without him or her knowing the release of bodily fluids while at rest. My Dear Mother without complaining would take the soiled sheets and bedding off my sister's bed. Put her in the shower and then wash her linens and make her bed. My Mom instilled the family secret to my siblings and yours truly never to tell anyone about my sisters misfortune. We were all very respectful of each other's disorders and never used it against her in family quarrels. The loneliest Runner (Made for TV movie), which was written and directed by Bonanza star Michael Landon shows our creator in the beginning being interview by another Olympic champion and Basketball star Rafer Johnson. Basically Mr. Johnson asked a humble John Curtis (Michael Landon) how he became a marathon runner? Our story flashes back to his youth. Everything appears normal until you see soiled bed sheets hanging out of the top story window of John's home. The Mother (DeAnn Mears) had no tolerance for the boy's lack of control and assumed he was just lazy. Her acting perfectly played as the cold and self assuring parent who will handle the problem without professional advice. Telling the boy no fluids before bed playing Doctor. Brian Keith who plays the father counteracts as the warm understanding parent who tells his wife, \"He'll grow out of it.\" The school bell rings 3:00 and Young John tired of being embarrassed, races home as soon as possible runs upstairs and pulls out the bed sheets before his girlfriend next door Nancy (Melissa Sue Anderson can spot them. Young John has a plan to stop the sheets from being displayed by his twisted minded Mother. But plans have a way of falling apart. So many Memories hit me personally from watching this film. Some parents seem to know what's best for the child and take steps which intern re-enforce negative reactions i.e. easting disorders, drug use, depression low self esteem and even running way. I personally was moved watching the frustration of a talented impressionable boy Lance Kerwin who wants to do the right thing by not wetting nightly but has no clue to stop. The Mother on the other hand takes matters into her own hands hoping the boy will succumb to his problem. No communications. A favorite line of post war parents in America about addressing a child's problem is, \"There lazy! A little discipline will do them some good!\" in some humiliating form. Michael Landon's script was basically his personal experiences with his unhinged and unstable Mother. Anyone who had problems communicating with their parents, (which is probably a huge percentage), will relate to this quick moving story . In some ways this is a prelude to Landon's future creations for Television, Little House on The Prairie and Highway To Heaven. As a youth I had learning issues and problems focusing on conversation and listening deficiencies. My parents felt without asking professionals, I was undisciplined. There are no quick fixes in life whether it's a one hour movie or half hour television program but real communication between child and parent is essential. I'm glad this particular problem was displayed."}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080467/reviews", "page_content": "9 /10\n\nWarning: Spoilers\n\nHaving done volunteer work in this area, this movie is a fantastic portrayal of teenage alcoholism and how best to treat it. 15 year old Buff Sanders (Scott Baio) is a champion ice hockey player and son of a hard drinking former professional hockey player Ken (Don Murray). The mother/wife had been killed in a tragic car accident six years earlier and both father and son were struggling with unrequited grief both medicating it by drinking to excess. Buff's friend and teammate Billy Carpenter (Lance Kerwin) begins to notice the impact Buff's drinking is having on his game and his life. After an evening of drinking so much that he almost passed out and after being severely beaten by his father, Buff is admitted to hospital and then put into a rehab clinic.\n\n\n\nHis father has too much denial and anger to attend the nightly group counseling sessions and so Billy volunteers to ride the bus every evening and be that support person. Like treatment of many alcoholics, the process of recognizing the extent of the drinking problem takes time and this movie accurately explores the ups and downs of supporting an alcoholic in recovery. Eventually there is a reconciliation with his father as the true reasons of his mother's death comes out rather than the incorrect version of events that had fueled Buff's anger.\n\n\n\nScott Baio and Lance Kerwin were 18 when the movie was filmed and were both already teen superstars and both do a fantastic job in this movie. Kerwin was no stranger to intense and empathetic roles so his was the better performance but Baio did surprisingly well given his fame to this point had been built on more easy going characters. In a final irony, Kerwin plays the loyal, upright, responsible friend and always came across as the clean cut blond all American boy and yet struggled with drug addiction through his teens and yet Baio, playing the rough, rebellious and hard drinking kid had in fact, by the standards of many Hollywood teen heart throbs, a stable career free from chemical dependency."}, {"url": "https://doyouremember.com/137542/michael-landon-the-loneliest-runner", "page_content": "Throughout his career in entertainment, Michael Landon delved into different fields. He became a renowned actor in some beloved shows but also took to writing and directing. Both proved the case for his movie The Loneliest Runner (1976). But this directorial triumph comes from a shockingly traumatic place.\n\nBefore becoming America\u2019s favorite Pa in Little House on the Prairie and before becoming a beloved sweetheart in Bonanza, Michael Landon suffered a terrible home life. Much of that stemmed from his mother who suffered emotional and mental troubles of her own. Ultimately, her own son became another victim of her woes and it inspired this movie.\n\nThe troubled early life of Michael Landon\n\nWhile Americans loved him as Pa, Michael Landon himself had a mixed relationship with his own parents. On the outside, he came from a glorious life that would supportively prime him for stardom. His father, Eli Maurice Orowitz, worked as an actor and theater manager. Meanwhile, his mother, Peggy O\u2019Neill, built a career as a comedian and dancer. But his mother actually provided a major source of debilitating stress in Landon\u2019s life. Throughout his childhood, she repeatedly attempted suicide, even right in front of him.\n\nRELATED: Whatever Happened To Michael Landon, Charles Ingalls On \u2018Little House on the Prairie?\u2019\n\nThis actually resulted in Landon needing to save her when O\u2019Neill tried to drown herself during a vacation to the beach. O\u2019Neill went back to her day as though nothing had happened while Landon vomited on what he called the worst day of his life. When she did not make attempts on her own life, O\u2019Neill actually bullied and abused Landon, even holding him at knifepoint. The stress, abuses, and threats took a huge toll on the young Landon to the point that he wet the bed well in his early teens. But O\u2019Neill\u2019s bullying wasn\u2019t over yet. She knew about his bedwetting and pulled more stunts that made Landon himself become the loneliest runner on his way home from school each day.\n\nMichael Landon was \u2018The Loneliest Runner\u2019\n\nDebuted in 1976, The Loneliest Runner follows 13-year-old John Curtis. Though Curtis goes to school within walking distance of his home, he has to sprint each day after classes. If he doesn\u2019t his friends might pass his house and see his wetted bedsheets hanging from his bedroom window, hung there by his own mother. Although it starred Lance Kerwin, in truth, Michael Landon was the loneliest runner who had to sprint home to hide this embarrassing evidence each day.\n\nLandon led a diverse life with just about every emotion on the spectrum. He endured a troubled childhood while harboring Olympic javelin ambitions. He became a beloved TV father but engaged in an extramarital affair. Some elements from this incomprehensibly full life make appearances in the movie. One takes the form of John Curtis making it to the Olympics. And he recruited his peers from Bonanza and Little House on the Prairie for key roles. Ultimately, he turned a horrible pain as the loneliest runner into inspiration."}, {"url": "https://bandsaboutmovies.com/2020/05/22/abc-afterschool-special-the-amazing-cosmic-awareness-of-duffy-moon-1976/", "page_content": "Editor\u2019s Note, January 2023: Lance Kerwin passed away on January 24, 2023, at the age of 62.

So let\u2019s jump right into the review!\n\nThis movie that aired on February 4, 1976, is simply too special to casually mention in passing amid some of the other notable young adult flicks aired during the ABC anthology series, which we pointed out in our review of Hewitt\u2019s Just Different.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause during that spring, and into the summer of 1976, anytime we faced a challenge, e.g., scaling a particularly tall tree, a knee-scraping bike stunt, or a dive off the pool house, someone would inevitably say, \u201cYou can do it, Duffy Moon!\u201d\n\nYeah, to hell with J.J, Rerun, The Fonz, and Gary Coleman (please tell me you know your \u201970s television characters) and their tired catch phrases.

It first aired on December 20, 1976 on NBC and starred Lance Kerwin, Brian Keith, DeAnn Mears, and Landon's Little House on the Prairie daughter, Melissa Sue Anderson. The film was nominated for two Emmy Awards.\n\nSynopsis\n\nJohn Curtis wins an Olympic marathon. He prepares to be interviewed on television by Rafer Johnson afterward, told that he will be asked questions like what got him into running. He flashes back to his childhood.\n\nAs a 12-year-old suffering from chronic bedwetting, John wakes up early every day to change his soiled sheets and pajamas before his parents can see, running them down to the laundromat on the way to school. His supportive father, Arnold, had promised him a regular bed to replace his child-sized bed if he can stay dry until his next birthday days later. John\u2019s mother Alice is shrill and strident, accusing him of either being too lazy to get out of bed at night to urinate or being spiteful against her.\n\nPretty Nancy Rizzi, a new classmate and next door neighbor, takes an interest in John and they walk home together. They plan to be study partners.\n\nJohn\u2019s father offers to drive him down to a football game early Saturday morning to watch John play with his team. John wakes up even earlier than normal to wash his sheets but finds the laundromat is still closed at that hour. After a resounding victory, Arnold proudly drives John and his teammates home. As they pull up, everybody sees John\u2019s soiled sheet, which his mother had found and hung out of his bedroom window to humiliate him. John\u2019s friends make excuses and walk home. With Alice goading him, Arnold decides to scold John.\n\nAn embarrassed John tells his friends a story that he had picked up a stray puppy that wet his bed but they seem unconvinced. Nancy offers to walk home with him after football practice, but John races home alone to pull in his sheet so she won\u2019t see it. He tells his parents that he\u2019s quitting the football team because he lost his gear, which he actually threw out so he wouldn\u2019t have to go to practice and could get home in time to pull in his sheet. For months, he continues to run home every day after school to hide the sheet.\n\nJohn\u2019s parents take him to a doctor, who says there\u2019s no apparent medical reason for John\u2019s condition, but that some boys have very deep sleep cycles that don\u2019t allow them to wake up. He asks if Arnold had a bedwetting problem since the condition affects boys more and is often hereditary. Arnold denies it. Alice is combative and refuses to take the doctor\u2019s advice to stop embarrassing John.\n\nAt gym class, the coach orders the class to run a mile on the track. He\u2019s astonished to see John build and hold a huge lead on the other boys. He calls the varsity track coach to tell him John has broken the school record, being faster than even the high school seniors. Impressed, the track coach invites John to practice with the track team after school but John declines so he can run home and hide his sheet. Alice refuses to delay hanging his sheet outside if he wants to run track.\n\nJohn\u2019s friends invite him to a sleepover. Alice accepts for him, believing that it will be proof of whether John\u2019s bedwetting is voluntary or involuntary. John reluctantly attends, then spends the entire night awake after the others go to sleep. Alice believes her accusations are confirmed.\n\nNancy\u2019s father shows up after school to surprise her with his new car, a Ford Thunderbird convertible. He offers John a ride home with them, but John starts running down hills and slopes, desperately trying to get home before the Rizzis. He arrives just in time to see the Rizzis pull into their driveway next door. Mortified that Nancy saw the sheet in his window, he turns and runs away. His parents are worried that night when he doesn\u2019t return home and eventually call the police.\n\nJohn has hidden away in a department store, coming out after everybody else has left. He spies a mannequin clad in the uniform of the Los Angeles Rams, his favorite team, and runs around the store after changing into it. He stops in awe when he suddenly finds himself in the bedroom department, confronted with a large display of beds. He lays down contentedly in one and quickly falls asleep.\n\nJohn is found by store personnel the next morning. The store won\u2019t press charges because John did no damage. John explains to his father that in the relaxed surroundings without the pressure of his mother's constant hectoring, he was able to stay dry that night. Arnold is proud even as Alice keeps badgering while they talk. He finally stands up to her, ordering her to shut up. He sheepishly admits that he was a bedwetter himself until he was 14. John empathetically forgives his father's secret shame. They go outside to wait until the store opens, as Arnold intends to buy John any new bed he wants immediately.\n\nJohn goes to track practice after school, where Nancy agrees to wait to walk home with him afterward.\n\nBack in the present, the interviewer asks John the question of what interested him in running. He credits his parents.\n\nCreation of film\n\nMichael Landon was the real-life version of the loneliest runner. As a child, he wet his bed until he was 14 and his mother, Peggy O'Neill, really did hang his sheets to dry outside of his bedroom window as punishment. The dysfunctional family life that Landon experienced during his early life were also similar to the ones in this autobiographical film.\n\nThe character of John Curtis is modeled after Landon, as are his parents and other supporting characters. He reused actor Walker Edmiston of Bonanza to play Doctor Claymore (who coincidentally later took two jobs on Little House guest starring as different Doctors in seasons five and nine, as well as an appearance in season three). Landon also asked his on-screen daughter, Melissa Sue Anderson to play Nancy Rizzi, saying the part was perfect for her. Melissa says she was both honored and thrilled to have been included.\n\nPrior to acting, Landon also had Olympic ambitions as a javelin thrower. Due to an injury in his shoulder ligaments during college, Landon was unable to pursue a career in sports and started acting, which eventually led to three very successful television series, in addition to other acting, directing, and writing jobs on other shows.\n\nCast\n\nSee also"}, {"url": "https://www.btutv.com/review/TheLoneliestRunner/", "page_content": "\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff1a Michael Landon \u5b64\u72ec\u7684\u957f\u8dd1\u8005 \u5b64\u72ec\u7684\u8dd1\u6b65\u8005 \u5267\u60c5 \u8fd0\u52a8\n\n\u6bd4\u5154TV\u4e3a\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b1976\u5e74\u7531Lance Kerwin,Brian Keith,DeAnn Mears\u4e3b\u6f14,Michael Landon\u5bfc\u6f14\u7684\u300a\u6700\u5b64\u72ec\u7684\u957f\u8dd1\u8005\u300b/\u539f\u540d\u300aThe Loneliest Runner\u300b/\u53c8\u540d\u300a\u5b64\u72ec\u7684\u957f\u8dd1\u8005 / \u5b64\u72ec\u7684\u8dd1\u6b65\u8005\u300b\u5267\u60c5 \u8fd0\u52a8 \u7535\u5f71\u5728\u7ebf\u89c2\u770b\u5b8c\u6574\u7248,\u300a\u6700\u5b64\u72ec\u7684\u957f\u8dd1\u8005\u300b\u767e\u5ea6\u4e91\u7f51\u76d8\u8d44\u6e90\u4ee5\u53ca\u300a\u6700\u5b64\u72ec\u7684\u957f\u8dd1\u8005\u300b\u9ad8\u6e05\u84dd\u5149mp4\u8fc5\u96f7\u4e0b\u8f7d\uff0c\u300a\u6700\u5b64\u72ec\u7684\u957f\u8dd1\u8005\u300bBT\u4e0b\u8f7d\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u60a8\u80fd\u559c\u6b22\uff01\n\nA fourteen year old bed wetter runs home from school every day to retrieve the w\n\nPlot Summary:A thirteen year-old bed wetter runs home from school every day to retrieve the wet sheet his mother has hung from his bedroom window to punish him.
