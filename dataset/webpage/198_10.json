But the number of employees at Givenchy has more than tripled since Mr. Tisci joined the house in 2005, and sales revenue is believed to have grown to around 500 million euros ($539 million) annually. There are now 72 free-standing stores worldwide (compared with seven in 2005), with a Rome flagship set to open this year, and plans for a London store are underway for next year. Last week, LVMH, the world\u2019s biggest luxury group, posted record revenue and profits for 2016, beating expectations because of strong sales in the United States and Europe and a pickup in demand in Asia.\n\n\u201cRiccardo has accomplished everything a designer can do for a brand, clocking a very respectable tenure and creating a fully realized language for them,\u201d Ms. Fargo said.\n\nSo, why leave?\n\nMr. Tisci said in his statement, \u201cI now wish to focus on my personal interests and passions.\u201d But rumors have suggested he may be headed to Versace. It would mean going home to Italy, and to a brand whose unabashed Italian sex and power-woman aesthetic mirrors his own. And Mr. Tisci is close to Donatella Versace (he shocked fashion in 2015 when he featured Ms. Versace, at least nominally a rival designer, in a Givenchy ad campaign).\n\nBesides, the suggestion, briefly beloved of the industry, that a designer needs a timeout from the increasingly endless show seasons, which was posited when both Mr. Simons and Ms. Waight Keller left their posts, increasingly seems like smoke and mirrors. After Dior, Mr. Simons took an even bigger job at Calvin Klein, and Ms. Waight Keller is said to be moving to a different brand (Givenchy?)."}, {"url": "https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/riccardo-tisci-leaves-givenchy", "page_content": "RICCARDO TISCI has left his role at Givenchy after 12 years at the helm.

She will be the first woman to design for Givenchy, and the second major female appointment that parent company LVMH has made in the last 12 months, following Maria Grazia Chiuri\u2019s appointment last June as creative director of Christian Dior.\n\nThe now cult tracksuit on the Spring Summer 2016 Chlo\u00e9 catwalk.

The Royal College of Art graduate is an industry veteran, having also designed for Pringle of Scotland, and Gucci. Givenchy will be her first time designing couture.\n\nThe designer is well-liked for her straight-talking style and an aesthetic that puts female-friendly elegance and ease at the top of the agenda. This is a departure for Givenchy. During his 12-year tenure, Tisci made streetwear and street style part of the Givenchy house codes, creating hoodies with bold prints, track pants and rockn\u2019roll-influenced leather goods. Fans included Kanye West and Rihanna. This look was successful, too: during this period, the house is thought to have expanded six times. Tisci is now expected to join Versace.\n\n\n\nA model on the Chloe AW 2017 catwalk, where Waight Keller\u2019s was creative director.

Big hitters included 70s floral prints, dresses with oversized frills and pinafore dresses, alongside her now cult designer tracksuit and a collection inspired by women on motorbikes. Her fans tend to be artistic: Solange Knowles, Isabelle Hupert and Clemence Poesy all attended her last Chlo\u00e9 show.\n\nRiccardo Tisci, formerly of Givenchy.

The post announcing Waight Keller\u2019s appointment was preceded with a quote from de Givenchy which read: \u201ctrue elegance comes with a natural gesture, an attitude in simplicity.\u201d\n\nIt could also be that Waight Keller\u2019s work at Chloe was a faithful update of the Chlo\u00e9 girl, as imagined by its founder Gaby Aghion \u2013 and her ability to translate heritage to contemporary will have been noted by Givenchy.\n\nThe industry will be intrigued to see what Weight Keller\u2019s approach is.

The appointment is effective May 2.\n\n\u201cThe teams join me in warmly welcoming Clare Waight Keller into the Givenchy family,\u201d said Philippe Fortunato, CEO of Givenchy, in a statement. \u201cI am very excited to see Clare bring her singular sense of elegance and modernity to Givenchy. By exploring our maison\u2019s 65-year heritage and the outstanding savoir faire of its ateliers, I am convinced Clare will help Givenchy reach its full potential.\u201d\n\nWaight Keller replaces Riccardo Tisci, who left the LVMH-owned brand after his combined Fall 2017 men\u2019s and Spring 2017 haute couture show in January, reportedly for Versace, though that appointment has not been made official.\n\n\u201cI am very happy to have Clare Waight Keller join the LVMH Group,\u201d Bernard Arnault, the chairman and CEO of LVMH, said in the same statement. \u201cI believe her widespread expertise and vision will allow Givenchy to enter the next phase of its unique path.\u201d\n\nFormerly the creative director of Chlo\u00e9, Waight Keller is to be the first woman to lead at Givenchy.

But during her six years at Chlo\u00e9, she built a vivid world through hit handbags, evocative advertising, a well-cast front row wearing the house\u2019s latest offerings, and lively social feeds.\n\nHer first collection for the brand, for Spring 2018, will be shown in Paris in October."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/fashion/givenchy-clare-waight-keller.html", "page_content": "Though Ms. Waight Keller, who began her career working at Calvin Klein in New York and with Tom Ford at Gucci, was also in charge of men\u2019s wear at Pringle, she has never worked with an haute couture atelier before. Givenchy suspended its formal couture shows in 2012, first holding static presentations of the collection instead, and more recently incorporating some couture looks into its men\u2019s wear shows in January and June. But the fact that Ms. Waight Keller has been specifically given responsibility for the highest form of fashion\u2019s art suggests that a return to a more formal couture offering may be in the future.\n\nIt also suggests that the idea was false that Ms. Waight Keller, who has three children and has recently moved her family to London from Paris, was taking time off after Chlo\u00e9 because of the pressures of today\u2019s fashion cycle. Her responsibilities at Givenchy, after all, will be significantly greater than her responsibilities at Chlo\u00e9: She will be overseeing at least eight collections a year, as opposed to four.\n\nLVMH does not break down the performance of individual brands in its financial results, but the Givenchy annual sales revenue is believed to be to around 500 million euros, or more than $530 million,) and there are 72 free-standing stores worldwide.

A year later, he was at Central Saint Martins and earning British scholarships that allowed him to finish his degree.\n\nHis first work experiences were in Italy, with Stefano Guerrero, Antonio Berardi, Coccapani and Ruffo Research, while he nurtured his signature label with a strong following in London. When Ruffo went bankrupt, he went soul-searching in India, gathered up his strength and returned to Milan and staged a show that would all but seal his employment contract at Givenchy.\n\nTisci, a friend of Madonna\u2019s, has designed looks for the singer\u2019s tours and other events. Here is the duo at 2016\u2019s Met Gala, outfitted in Givenchy. David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock\n\nOnce installed at the couture house, he brought a dark, Goth-tinged fierceness and severity, which he ultimately married to more romantic inclinations, clashing together such disparate influences as Victorian dressing and chola culture to produce runway fireworks.\n\nTisci would seem a natural for Versace, given his penchant for bold prints, demonstrative hardware and tough chic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m mature, and I\u2019m different, but I was born a daring designer and I\u2019m going to die as a daring designer. That is me,\u201d he told WWD last year.\n\nAs reported, Versace is rethinking the timing of its initial public offering as it embarks on a significant expansion plan ahead of a listing.\n\nAsked on Jan. 19 about Tisci\u2019s potential arrival at the company, a spokesman said, \u201cDonatella Versace is the creative director of the company and at this time we do not have any plans to change that. Beyond that, of course, we do not comment on rumors.\u201d\n\nWere Donatella Versace to welcome a designer of Tisci\u2019s stature, it would be in line with her past efforts to champion young talent. Versace tapped Christopher Kane in 2009 to help relaunch the Versus line and, when the two parted ways, she forged a new path for the brand, developing it into a seasonless line with a strong digital component, with the intention of working with young designers with a fresh approach. In 2013, she tapped Anthony Vaccarello as a guest designer for Versus, and then named him its creative director until he departed to join Saint Laurent.\n\nTo be sure, a leading designer such as Tisci would ramp up the brand\u2019s \u201ccool factor,\u201d social media reach and appeal. The designer boasts 1.8 million followers on Instagram.\n\nTisci posted on his account following the news that he was leaving Givenchy: \u201cA giant heartfelt thank you to #givenchy, #lvmh, my incredible team, the magical atelier and everyone who made these 93 collections possible and all the other crazy adventures. Your love and support, in the day and in the night, will forever remain in my heart. #love #givenchy #forever\u201d\n\nWhen Donatella Versace appeared in the Givenchy ads, Tisci told WWD: \u201cThere\u2019s no jealousy and no competition between us. It\u2019s a real, pure friendship: Somebody who\u2019s part of my gang, part of my family. We want to give a message of friendship and love.\u201d\n\nMore: Riccardo Tisci\u2019s Most Memorable Givenchy Campaigns: A Look Back\n\nAt that time, Versace echoed the sentiment, and gave a resounding endorsement to her Paris-based counterpart: \u201cRiccardo Tisci is extremely talented and, above all, my dear friend. We are family. I want to get rid of the old system, work together, support each other and make fashion a true global community.\u201d\n\nThe Blackstone Group bought a 20 percent stake in Versace in 2014. Family members hold the rest of the equity.\n\nVersace\u2019s own stores are increasingly becoming the engine behind the brand\u2019s growth, as shown by its performance in 2015, when retail sales were up 28.9 percent to 400.7 million euros, or $440.7 million.\n\nIn 2015, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 19.9 percent to 81 million euros, or $89.1 million. The Milan-based group saw revenues increase 17.5 percent to 645 million euros, or $709.5 million.\n\nDollar figures were converted from the euro at average exchange rates for the periods in question."}, {"url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/riccardo-tisci-leaves-givenchy", "page_content": "Riccardo Tisci is leaving Givenchy, the Paris house announced today.\n\nHis Fall 2017 menswear collection and Spring 2017 Haute Couture collection, shown together on the runway in Paris on January 20, were his last for the label after a 12-year run. Tisci looked to the American West for that show, but the rumors that have persisted for weeks have the Italian designer headed home, so to speak. He is thought to be joining the Milan-based brand Versace.\n\nTisci\u2019s exit ends one of the fashion business\u2019s longest and most successful appointments. In the last year and a half, Dior, Lanvin, Saint Laurent, Valentino, Chlo\u00e9, and more have seen their creative directors leave, and more and more, the three-year creative director stint is becoming the new normal. The industry has changed dramatically since Tisci\u2019s early days at Givenchy, and wherever he winds up\u2014Versace or elsewhere\u2014it would be a unique case were he to reproduce a similarly long run.\n\nSee Tisci\u2019s best work in Vogue, and stay tuned for updates."}, {"url": "https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/designer/givenchy", "page_content": "For the first 43 years of its existence, the house of Givenchy was a monument to conservative good taste. Even so, right out of the box, innovation was also part of the equation. Hubert de Givenchy made a mark with his debut collection in 1952: It was based on separates, which a woman could mix and match rather than wear slavishly as demonstrated by a designer, and that was a novel concept for the time. That the couturier was the youngest on Paris\u2019s scene (and a very handsome 6-foot-6) didn\u2019t hurt his reviews either.\n\nGivenchy was taken under the wing of the Spanish master Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga, and afterward his work became less obviously youth oriented. He and his mentor were described by The New York Times as \u201cundisputedly the world\u2019s most prophetic designers.\u201d During this era he introduced (simultaneously with Balenciaga) the revolutionary chemise, or sack dress, acclaimed as \u201ca genuinely new fashion shape.\u201d He is also credited with pioneering the princess silhouette, and when the cinematic sprite Audrey Hepburn first donned Givenchy\u2019s Little Black Dress, his name became forever linked with the Sabrina neckline.\n\nLVMH acquired the house of Givenchy in 1988, and the great man himself hung up his white lab coat (in which he was famous for working) by the end of 1995. After that, the company fell into a sort of dissolute decline. If Givenchy was \u201cthe master of non-assaultive style,\u201d as one reporter put it, his first two successors, John Galliano and Alexander McQueen, relied more on shock and awe. \u201cParisian chic\u2014with mayhem,\u201d is how the latter described his approach in Women\u2019s Wear Daily in 1998.\n\nIt began to chart a brighter course with the appointment of Riccardo Tisci, a young Italian with a gothic sensibility, as creative director in 2005. Tisci celebrated his 10th anniversary at the label on September 11, 2015, with a New York show for the industry and more than 800 members of the public. In 2017, Tisci departed the label and was succeeded by Clare Waight Keller, who had spent the prior six years at Chlo\u00e9. At Givenchy, she established a knack for elegant suiting and red carpet dresses early on. She became a household on May 19, 2018, when 29 million people around the world watched Meghan Markle marry Prince Harry in a long-sleeved, bonded-satin wedding gown of Waight Keller's design."}]}
