However, Tobin said he wasn't critical of previous Bears' drafts.\n\n'I think we have had good drafts in the past but I can see ways we can have better drafts,' said Tobin, a star running back for the University of Missouri from 1959 to 1962. 'I plan to work very closely with Mike Ditka, Jerry Vainisi and Michael McCaskey.'\n\nTobin, who began his pro career with Houston in 1963 before going to the Canadian League, said he had turned down four offers from the USFL for 'jobs with more elaborate titles' than the one he has now with the Bears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'But I wanted to be in the NFL with the Chicago Bears,' Tobin said.\n\nTobin added he anticipated the Bears would have to scout USFL games this spring for talent, adding he doesn't foresee a promising future for the rival league.\n\n'I think the NFL is doing a more aggressive selling job,' said Tobin, a native of Burlington Junction, Mo. 'I think there are some players who signed early that regret their decision ... I think we will look at the USFL games for the way they are going. They may not be around in a year or two.'\n\nMcCaskey said selecting a player personnel director was not modeled after any other team's organizational chart although he conceded it might be construed to be along the lines of the Dallas Cowboys.\n\n'I will make the final decision regarding draft choices and trades,' McCaskey added.\n\nDitka said his top priority for the upcoming draft would be defense, specifically defensive linemen.\n\n'We will want to get the best player available,' Ditka said. 'We didn't know this year that Dan (Hampton) would go down with injuries. I'd also like to see us look at a linebacker.'\n\nTobin said he didn't anticipate any disagreements with Ditka about whom to select in the draft, adding that McCaskey would have the ultimate say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTobin came to the Bears from the Green Bay Packers, where he was pro scouting director since 1972.\n\nIn a related matter, McCaskey said the club would evaluate moving to a new practice field away from Lake Forest, where the club experienced difficulty getting practice time because of inclement weather this past season.\n\nHe said he had visited facilities in Green Bay and Minnesota and estimated it would cost at least $500,000 to build an indoor facility to allow the team to practice during bad weather."}, {"url": "https://wikimili.com/en/Bill_Tobin_(American_football)", "page_content": "Nathan D.
