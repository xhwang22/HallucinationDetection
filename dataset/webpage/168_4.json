{"George Roll eventually became the company's president and CEO, and in 2001, he founded Roll Global.": [{"url": "https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-ceos-guide-to-retirement", "page_content": "Carl De Torres\n\nWhen Lloyd Blankfein was preparing to retire as chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs on October 1, 2018, he wrote a poignant letter to employees that captured his ambivalence about stepping down. \u201cIt\u2019s always been hard for me to imagine leaving,\u201d wrote Blankfein, who had just turned 64. \u201cWhen times are tougher, you can\u2019t leave. And when times are better, you don\u2019t want to leave. Today, I don\u2019t want to retire from Goldman Sachs, but\u2026it feels like the right time.\u201d\n\nGetting this timing right is an essential part of a CEO\u2019s job\u2014and it\u2019s more difficult than it appears. For leaders who have spent decades working to reach the pinnacle of their careers\u2014with all the power, perks, and prestige that come with the role\u2014retiring can be a scary, almost existential prospect. Their self-worth is often connected to their work, and the questions they face go to the heart of their self-image: How can I remain vital and relevant? Will people still respect me without my title? Where should I live now that I\u2019m not tied to headquarters? How will I fill my days? Without an organization to lead, how can I continue to make a difference in the world?\n\nWhile CEOs are working 70-to-80-hour weeks, it is impossible to consider these questions with clarity or to explore what might be possible or fulfilling after they retire. Giving up their jobs feels like stepping off a cliff. Without answers, many CEOs default to remaining too long in the job. Yet by doing so, they may imperil their legacies and their companies.\n\nI have spent more than 25 years grappling with these issues\u2014and helping others reflect on them. In 2001, at age 58, I left the CEO job at Medtronic after having served 10 years\u2014a term limit I\u2019d established when I assumed the role. At Harvard Business School, where I teach courses to CEOs, we talk extensively about the arc of a leader\u2019s tenure, finding the right time to exit, and reconstructing one\u2019s professional and personal life after leaving the job. As a board member of numerous organizations, I have been directly involved in counseling CEOs as they devise their exit strategies and postretirement plans. Apart from my board work, I have served as an informal counselor to more than two dozen chief executives who\u2019ve reached out to me when they faced this turning point.\n\nIn these conversations I encourage CEOs to leave while they are on top, rather than wait too long and risk being forced out by their boards when the business is not doing well. CEOs who refuse to retire make their boards\u2019 job much more difficult. Without a clear timetable, grooming internal successors and following an orderly succession process become challenging. By stepping aside at the appropriate moment, a CEO can create time and space for reflection before making new commitments.\n\nWith people living into their eighties and nineties, the options are numerous.\n\nFor a vivid example of the problems caused by a CEO who fails to step down at the right moment, look at General Electric. In 2017, when the GE board forced Jeff Immelt to resign after 16 years, it appointed an internal candidate, John Flannery, as CEO. The timing was terrible: Flannery spent a year trying to clean up the messes he had inherited (which included an ill-advised acquisition and an accounting scandal) before the board lost patience, fired him, and persuaded its newest board member, Larry Culp, to become CEO. Culp now faces a daunting turnaround. During Immelt\u2019s too-long tenure, GE shareholder value declined 73% while that of its peers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 179%. There was a time when business schools studied GE as a model for CEO succession. Now it\u2019s being taught as a case study in how not to handle the process, largely because of Immelt\u2019s failure to properly time his exit.\n\nAlthough CEOs inhabit a rarefied realm, variations on this decision\u2014When should I retire, and what should I do next?\u2014apply to professionals at all levels. This article focuses on the unique circumstances facing CEOs, but parts of the process I suggest are useful to anyone entering the final laps of a career.\n\nGet the Timing Right\n\nThinking about when to begin and how to spend a long retirement is a relatively new problem. A generation ago, when most people died in their late sixties or early seventies, the answer was simple: retire and move to Florida for warm weather and daily golf. Today, when many people live well into their eighties and nineties, retirement may last for decades, so deciding what to do is more complex, with a wider range of exciting options available.\n\nIn his theory of psychosocial development, Erik Erikson described the stage humans reach in late midlife as they approach retirement age and face a choice between generativity and stagnation. Generativity involves spreading your knowledge and wisdom across many people and organizations while actively continuing to learn. In contrast, stagnation occurs when leaders retire altogether and are left with no way to contribute, so they feel disconnected from their communities and society.\n\nIn my experience, when thinking about the right time for a CEO to retire, tenure in the job is a more important variable than age. It\u2019s rare to find an organization that performs better after a CEO has been in the role more than 10 to 12 years. There are exceptions, of course, including the companies whose long-tenured executives appear in HBR\u2019s best-performing CEOs ranking (some of them company founders, whose role in creating the firm and large ownership stake create power and succession dynamics different from those facing most CEOs). In general, nonfounder CEOs should avoid too-lengthy tenures for several reasons. Being CEO is an extremely demanding, travel-intensive job that requires great creativity, energy, tenacity, and resilience, and leaders often have a hard time sustaining those qualities for more than a decade. The strategies the CEO put in place may simply run out of gas, and the company will require new leadership to implement a strategic transformation. Not wanting to post poor bottom-line results, some long-tenured CEOs make decisions aimed at maintaining near-term results; thus they fail to make the bold investments required to drive long-term growth. Other CEOs display the opposite behavior: Late in their tenure they make a large acquisition in an effort to avoid a growth slowdown\u2014but in so doing, they create complexity that the board is reluctant to hand over to an inexperienced successor.\n\nAs Blankfein pointed out, there is no perfect time for a CEO to leave. To avoid staying too long, CEOs should regularly work through these questions, which are designed to identify when to exit: Take a personal inventory of your life, your career, and your time as CEO. Do you still find fulfillment and joy in the job? Do you feel the passion, energy, and excitement you once did? Are you still learning and feeling challenged?\n\nDo you have personal reasons to leave earlier than planned? Is your partner eager to start a new phase of life with you? Do you have family or health issues that may cause you to leave sooner than expected?\n\nAre you facing an unexpected career opportunity that won\u2019t come around again? Former Goldman Sachs CEO Hank Paulson wasn\u2019t planning to leave his role but felt compelled to accept President George W. Bush\u2019s appeal to become U.S. treasury secretary.\n\nHow is succession shaping up? If you have multiple internal candidates, how old are they relative to you? If you stay longer, will your successor still be young enough to have a long run in the job? Alternatively, is your successor prepared to be CEO right now and possibly unwilling to wait around if your timetable is uncertain? That situation confirmed the timing of my exit from Medtronic after 10 years: My successor, Art Collins, was only five and a half years younger than I and was ready to be CEO. If I had chosen to stay longer, he most likely would have taken a CEO position elsewhere.\n\nAt the other extreme, is your planned successor not ready or running into some difficulties? In that case you may have to extend your tenure so that other candidates can be prepared. Former Merck CEO Roy Vagelos encountered such a situation when his designated successor violated the company\u2019s code of conduct and the board asked Vagelos to stay until it could complete an external search.\n\nAre there company-specific milestones you want to achieve before you depart, such as the integration of a major acquisition, the launch of an important new product, or the completion of a long-running project? John Noseworthy remained in his role as Mayo Clinic CEO until the IT team finished implementing a very complex technology infrastructure system.\n\nIs your industry changing so dramatically that your company would benefit from a fresh perspective? After eight years as the CEO of Novartis, Joe Jimenez handed over the reins to Vas Narasimhan to lead the pharmaceutical company\u2019s push into emerging gene and cell-based therapies.\n\nDoes your company have a mandatory retirement age? Not long ago, most companies did (typically 65), but many have dropped it as health and longevity have improved. Today when a board has a high-performing CEO who wants to continue, the directors are often willing to eliminate a mandatory retirement policy. At Ford, where CEOs traditionally retired at 65, the board asked Alan Mulally to stay until just before he turned 69. Merck recently changed its policy to extend Ken Frazier\u2019s tenure as chief executive after he turns 65. Mandatory retirement policies can be useful for forcing out leaders who are reluctant to step aside, but boards should recognize that age 65 is arbitrary and that flexibility may be in the company\u2019s best interest.\n\nThe relevance of these questions will vary in each CEO\u2019s case, but taken together, they provide an important list of issues that leaders should contemplate in deciding when it\u2019s best to move on.\n\nCraft Your Next Act Slowly and Deliberately\n\nOne reason CEOs hold on too long is that they can\u2019t imagine what comes next. This is shortsighted. Today former CEOs have myriad opportunities to continue to lead and make meaningful contributions. Whether they choose to serve on corporate and nonprofit boards, teach, write books, get involved in nonprofit organizations, join a private equity firm, create a foundation, serve in government, or mentor emerging leaders, many former CEOs find that this period of generativity is very fulfilling.\n\nLeaders who construct a satisfying post-CEO life often develop a positive reputation\u2014and, in my experience, seem more content. An example is Steve Reinemund, who served as CEO at PepsiCo from 2001 to 2006. During that time he set the standard for values-centered leadership, grew revenue and market capitalization, and diversified PepsiCo\u2019s management. At age 58 Reinemund stepped down to focus on his family\u2019s needs, making way for Indra Nooyi to succeed him. After retiring he spent six years as the dean of Wake Forest\u2019s business school, giving it a focus on values and ethics. In addition, he has served on the boards of Johnson & Johnson, American Express, ExxonMobil, Walmart, and Marriott, where he has been a strong advocate for values, ethics, and diversity.\n\nWhen I discuss retirement with CEOs, I suggest this step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Finish strong and go out on top.\n\nMany CEOs worry that they will become lame ducks as soon as their succession timetable is clear. I disagree. You are in charge until the last day, and you should finish your tenure on a high note. As Ecolab CEO Doug Baker puts it, \u201cRun through the finish line.\u201d By staying fully engaged, outgoing CEOs give their successors time to plan their own agendas without the pressures of daily business. That is precisely what John Noseworthy did as Mayo Clinic\u2019s CEO: He gave the board nine months\u2019 notice to select and prepare a successor while continuing to build Mayo\u2019s medical business and leaving the financials in great shape when he retired, on December 31, 2018. During that time his successor, Gianrico Farrugia, was developing an agenda and organizing his top team.\n\n2. Meet with a career coach or a therapist a year in advance.\n\nWhen leaving Medtronic, I had fears about losing relevance, not having a platform, or lacking meaning in my life. So I went back to a therapist I had seen years before and talked those issues through. In addition to exploring my fears, the discussions enabled me to envision what my new life might look like and what my options might be. Recognizing that I didn\u2019t want to take on another full-time role gave me the freedom to explore many other things that life has to offer. I still had no idea how I would feel or what I might do when I left, but I was better prepared to cope with the unknown. After I left the job, I spent two years figuring out my next steps while teaching for 18 months as a visiting professor at two Swiss universities.\n\nBy staying fully engaged, outgoing CEOs give their successors time to plan ahead.\n\n3. If you\u2019re married, talk through the transition with your spouse.\n\nAsk questions such as What would give us the greatest satisfaction? Where will we find fulfillment? Where would we like to live and spend time? What hobbies haven\u2019t we had time to explore? Is there a bucket list of activities\u2014such as living in another country\u2014that my being CEO has prevented us from pursuing? My wife, Penny, and I met with a counselor six months before I left Medtronic to discuss those issues, and we were able to address the different stages we were at in our careers.\n\n4. Say your goodbyes and make a clean break.\n\nIn the months before you leave, make in-person visits to secure your relationships with key people, your employees, and customers. When your time is up, don\u2019t hang around the C-suite. Move your office to a new location\u2014preferably away from headquarters, but definitely far from the executive wing. I suggest that former CEOs go back to the company only when specifically invited by the new CEO.\n\n5. Take six to 12 months to explore your options before making any firm commitments.\n\nExtended time away gives leaders a tabula rasa so that they can think clearly about what comes next. After I left Medtronic, Penny and I rented a villa in Provence and had visits from family and friends\u2014something I had wanted to do previously, but then I couldn\u2019t afford the time away from the company. During this exploration phase, don\u2019t make any firm commitments. The first opportunities that come along may not be the best options, but some leaders accept them out of fear that they won\u2019t be able to fill their time. They may want to retain a title and a business card and to let colleagues know they are still active. Be careful with smaller commitments, too; they can fragment your schedule and prevent you from taking extended vacations or being available for other, higher priorities. This new stage of exploration and saying \u201cnot yet\u201d to emerging opportunities may be uncomfortable, but living with the discomfort will help you choose your next step wisely.\n\n6. Make your decisions and move ahead.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to take on new roles and activities, be flexible about your time obligations, knowing that these commitments are not forever. Then dive in 100% to learn everything you can and contribute as if you will be there the rest of your life.\n\nWeighing All the Options\n\nBeyond needing a process for weighing options, many retiring CEOs want to talk specifically about the pros and cons of the options they have. Here are the most common ones:\n\nServe on corporate boards.\n\nThese days most active CEOs are restricted by their own boards to serving on a single outside board; but once they step aside, they can make vital contributions to multiple organizations. For this reason, recently retired CEOs are very much in demand as directors. Former DuPont CEO Ellen Kullman is an example: She sits on the boards of Amgen, Carbon, United Technologies, and Goldman Sachs (as a colleague of mine), where she shows a knack for digging deep into the details and asking important questions. Serving on boards enables you to stay engaged in the important issues companies are confronting and to develop new professional colleagues. But be aware of the time investment boards can require, especially during crises, because that may constrain your other activities.\n\nTeach. As I have learned, teaching MBA candidates and executives can be both rewarding and intellectually challenging, forcing you to remain sharp enough to keep up with your students and to understand the motivations and philosophies of a younger generation. You gain entry to the very different world of academia, with all its intellectual stimulation but also its bureaucratic frustrations. Teaching should not be entered into lightly, because doing it well takes an enormous amount of time. Many retired CEOs find it worth the investment. It has enabled me to fulfill a passion to help authentic leaders develop their capabilities. Coaching the next generation of leaders can be a satisfying way of giving back.\n\nWrite books.\n\nMany retired CEOs write books. Several of these, such as those from Aetna\u2019s Ron Williams (Learning to Lead), Campbell Soup\u2019s Doug Conant (Touchpoints, with Mette Norgaard), Bridgewater\u2019s Ray Dalio (Principles), and Baxter\u2019s Harry Kraemer (Becoming the Best and From Values to Action), have been especially helpful to emerging leaders. Although writing can be very satisfying, it\u2019s important to wait at least a year after retirement so that you can gain perspective and write about more than your experience at a single company.\n\nLead nonprofit organizations.\n\nServing on the boards of nonprofits can be especially gratifying. Some executives even take full-time leadership roles there. For instance, following a successful career as the CEO of U.S. Bancorp, Richard Davis became the chief executive of Make-A-Wish Foundation, in Phoenix, while also serving on the boards of Mayo Clinic and Twin Cities YMCA. But be warned: Although nonprofit leadership is personally rewarding, it can be just as demanding as being the CEO of a for-profit company.\n\nJoin a private equity firm.\n\nThe rapid growth of the private equity sector has created a real need for executives with strong operating experience who can bring fresh eyes to the often-troubled companies in PE portfolios. A good example is Harry Kraemer, an executive partner with Madison Dearborn. Kraemer is positive about his experiences; however, several former CEOs have confided to me their disappointment in private equity. They feel that they were promised more responsibility than was delivered and that the firms were simply using their names for prestige.\n\nCreate a foundation.\n\nMany CEOs who accumulate significant wealth over the course of their careers decide to establish a foundation to achieve wider influence on important issues. That\u2019s what former IBM CEO Sam Palmisano did when he established the Center for Global Enterprise (CGE) at Rockefeller University in New York. At IBM, Palmisano developed his theories regarding globally integrated organizations. In creating CGE, he was able to engage with scholars to deepen those ideas and put them into practice. Penny and I used Medtronic stock to create the George Family Foundation, which she chairs, focused on integrated health and healing and authentic leadership. We have found it enormously rewarding to support nonprofit organizations doing important work, but it can be challenging to realize the outcomes you desire.\n\nServe in government.\n\nMany former CEOs have moved into government service, whether by appointment or by seeking elective office. My Harvard Business School classmate Michael Bloomberg is a superb example: He served three terms as mayor of New York City and remains an important voice on a range of social and political issues. In the right circumstances, serving in government can be fulfilling, create meaning, and burnish one\u2019s legacy. In the wrong ones it can be deeply frustrating, as former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson learned during his 14 months as U.S. secretary of state\u2014when he often found himself at odds with President Trump.\n\nMentor leaders.\n\nIn the past decade rising executives have sought out coaching and mentoring opportunities, and many people recognize that former CEOs make very thoughtful coaches. Coaching the next generation of leaders can be a satisfying way of giving back. Former Novartis CEO Dan Vasella travels the world coaching CEOs and running mentoring programs for leaders. Morgan Stanley\u2019s John Mack finds great joy in coaching young entrepreneurs. The rewards of mentoring far exceed the investment of time required.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAt a moment when authentic leaders are needed throughout society, it\u2019s an enormous loss if former CEOs simply retire to warmer regions and make no attempt to help solve the world\u2019s myriad problems. The possibilities listed above enable such experienced leaders to make very important contributions to society while still having time for family and friends, hobbies, and travel. Among the many former CEOs I know, the ones who are thriving have found ways to create or nurture things that will outlast them. Their generative approach to their later years brings them a sense of well-being\u2014and helps improve the world."}, {"url": "https://investor.ti.com/corporate-governance/leadership", "page_content": "Rich Templeton is chairman of the board of Texas Instruments.

He was executive vice president of the company and president of TI's Semiconductor business from June 1996 through April 2004. In these roles, Templeton helped define and execute TI's strategy to focus on semiconductors for signal processing.\n\nAs CEO, he reshaped the company, focusing resources on growth opportunities in TI's core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing. His strategic actions included the major acquisition of National Semiconductor and the successful wind-down of the company's wireless operations, which enabled resources to be more fully focused on areas of long-term return. Templeton led TI to become the global leader in analog integrated circuits, while still maintaining the company's strengths in embedded systems and digital signal processing.\n\nThroughout this process, he maintained the company's strategic investments in R&D and manufacturing, while expanding the size of the sales and applications engineering team to better serve TI customers. Within the manufacturing arena, he oversaw the opportune purchases of capacity and equipment that positioned the company for future growth.\n\nTempleton joined the company in 1980 after earning a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering from Union College in New York.

He became CEO in 1981 at the age of 45. At that time, GE had a very complex organizational structure with considerably bureaucratic rules. One of his first changes was to initiate a strategy formulation process with the guideline that each of the businesses should be number 1 or 2 in their respective areas. If this was not the case, managers had the options of fixing the problem, selling their particular business, or closing it. In an effort to streamline the organization, Welch removed the sector level and eliminated thousands of salaried and hourly employee positions.\n\nThe restructuring was followed by changing the organizational culture and the managerial styles of GE's managers. One such program was the Work-Out\uff08\u7fa4\u7b56\u7fa4\u529b\uff09.Groups of managers were assembled to share their views openly in three-day sessions. At the beginning of the meetings, the superior presented the challenges for his or her\n\norganizational unit. Then the superior had to leave, requesting the groups to find solutions to the problems. Facilitators (\u4f1a\u8bae\u4e3b\u6301\u4eba) helped these discussions. On the last day, the superior was presented with proposed solutions. He or she then had three choices: to accept the proposal, not to accept it, or to collect more information. This process put great pressure on the superior to make decisions.\n\nAnother program to improve effectiveness and efficiency was Best Practices. The aim was to learn from other companies how they obtained customer satisfaction, how they related to their suppliers, and in what ways they developed new products. This helped the GE people to focus on the processes in their operations that would improve the company's performance.\n\nJack Welch was personally involved in developing managers at GE's training center in Crotonville. Leaders, Welch suggested, are not only those who achieve results but also those who share the values of the company.\n\n\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u793a\uff1a\u6b63\u786e\u9009T\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u9009F\u3002 1.

Unfortunately, there\u2019s no school for chief executives\u2014only the school of experience. And you won\u2019t be allowed many mistakes: Close to 50% of all CEOs are replaced within five years. How to beat those odds? Develop an explicit philosophy about how you can best add value to your company. Your philosophy determines which corporate areas receive most of your attention (strategic planning? R&D? recruiting?) and how you spend each day. It also influences the kinds of people and behaviors you value, including which decisions you make personally and which you delegate. Your most effective leadership approach may not be the one that best suits your personality\u2014but it is the one that best meets your company\u2019s needs. For instance, Richard Rosenberg, chairman of BankAmerica, spends the bulk of his time designing strict controls that help his company navigate in a highly regulated environment. By contrast, Gillette CEO Al Zeien ensures consistent execution of corporate goals in his geographically dispersed enterprise by personally conducting 800 performance reviews annually. No leadership approach can guarantee your success. But when you consciously select the most appropriate approach for your company, you provide the clarity, consistency, and commitment essential for leadership. The Idea in Practice\n\nThere is no shortage of schools for businesspeople of every specialty: accountants, engineers, financiers, technologists, information specialists, marketers, and, of course, general managers, who have their choice of hundreds, if not thousands, of M.B.A. programs. But where is the school for the person in charge of getting the best results from all these members of the organization? There is no school for CEOs\u2014except the school of experience. Chief executives must learn on the job how to lead a company, and they must learn while every stakeholder is watching.\n\nCEOs must learn on the job, and they must learn while every stakeholder is watching.\n\nThe CEO\u2019s job is like no other in the organization. It is infinite. Senior executives are, by definition, ultimately responsible for every decision and action of every member of the company, including those decisions and actions of which they are not aware. CEOs\u2014even new ones\u2014are allowed few mistakes. Not surprisingly, research shows that between 35% and 50% of all CEOs are replaced within five years. That is a costly proposition for any organization, for no company can lose its leader without losing some sense, even temporarily, of its identity and direction.\n\nTwo years ago, our interest in the role of the CEO prompted us to begin an extensive study of how senior executives lead. Over 12 months, we interviewed 160 chief executives around the world, most of whom were running major corporations in industries as diverse as gold mining, computers, and soft drinks. Our goal was to examine the set of attitudes, activities, and behaviors that determined how those executives managed their organizations. To be honest, going into the project we hypothesized that there might turn out to be 160 different approaches to leadership. There were not. Only 5 distinct approaches emerged from our data.\n\nNo matter where a company is located or what it makes, its CEO must develop a guiding, over-arching philosophy about how he or she can best add value. This philosophy determines the CEO\u2019s approach to leadership. By approach, we mean which areas of corporate policy\u2014for example, strategic planning, R&D, or recruiting\u2014receive the most attention, what kind of people and behaviors the CEO values in the organization, which decisions the CEO makes personally or delegates, and how he or she spends each day. A leadership approach is a coherent, explicit style of management, not a reflection of personal style. This is a critical distinction. (See the sidebar \u201cWhat\u2019s Personality Got to Do with It?\u201d) We found that in effective companies, CEOs do not simply adopt the leadership approach that suits their personalities but instead adopt the approach that will best meet the needs of the organization and the business situation at hand. Is the industry growing explosively or is it mature? How many competitors exist and how strong are they? Does technology matter and, if so, where is it going? What are the organization\u2019s capital and human assets? What constitutes sustainable competitive advantage, and how close is the organization to achieving it? The answers to questions such as these determine which of the following five leadership approaches an effective CEO will adopt.\n\nWhat\u2019s Personality Got to Do with It? \u201cBut isn\u2019t leadership really all about personality?\u201d We hear this question frequently during discussions about our research and the five leadership approaches. We also often hear this remark: \u201cLeadership\u2014either you\u2019re born with it or you\u2019re not.\u201d We disagree, both that leadership is a genetic trait and that a person\u2019s approach to leadership is solely a function of personality. In fact, we found that personality is just one element of effective leadership and often not the decisive one. In the most successful companies, the CEO has scrutinized the business situation, determined what the organization requires from its leader, and chosen the leadership approach that best meets those requirements. Sometimes the approach fits the CEO\u2019s personality; sometimes it does not. Indeed, our research suggests that some very good leaders repress certain personality traits, or develop ones they weren\u2019t born with, in order to run their organizations effectively. Consider Richard Rosenberg of BankAmerica. He employs, by his own admission and our observation, the box approach to leadership. He says that he must: BankAmerica operates in a highly regulated industry. A small error or, worse, a case of graft can have grave consequences. BankAmerica thus owes it to its customers to have a strict set of controls, and the CEO must make them his chief responsibility. But is Richard Rosenberg the kind of person you would expect to be using the box approach? Hardly. He is relaxed, affable, gregarious. \u201cThis isn\u2019t me,\u201d he admits. \u201cI\u2019m not a box guy. I\u2019d actually fit in a lot better with the people in marketing. But our situation demanded a box. So here I am.\u201d And take a look at Dana Mead, CEO of Tenneco. When Mead was appointed to lead the $3 billion diversified industrial concern in early 1992, he thought that the company was headed in the right direction. Instead, he quickly discovered that Tenneco was entirely off course. The company had some attractive businesses, but many of its practices prevented those businesses from thriving. There was a highly politicized capital-allocation system, a compensation program that measured and rewarded meaningless goals, and no strategy formulation process. Without a complete overhaul, Mead determined, the company would not survive into the next century. The battle plan: change. Accordingly, Mead adopted practically every technique of the change approach to leadership. He launched new policies and procedures, established a new culture, divested operations, fired employees unwilling or unable to embrace new ways of doing business, and went on the road to preach the gospel of change to Tenneco employees all over the world. But does Mead have the kind of personality you\u2019d expect to find leading this charge? Again, not at all. He is soft-spoken, even a bit subdued. Indeed, in his previous position as CEO of International Paper, he was a human-assets leader\u2014a role that may have come more naturally to him. But at Tenneco, the business situation demanded a different approach, and Mead rose to the challenge. That, we argue, is the essence of effective leadership. Not surprisingly, we also encountered CEOs whose personalities seemed to be a natural fit with their leadership approaches. Herb Kelleher, Southwest Airlines\u2019 humorous, down-home CEO, probably could not work in a company that didn\u2019t require a human-assets leader. Assertive and demanding, Stephen Friedman, former managing partner of Goldman Sachs, would likely champion change at any organization. How to explain this confluence of personality and leadership approach? We see two possible scenarios. The first is fortunate coincidence: A CEO assesses the business situation, determines which leadership approach is required, and finds that it just happens to reflect his or her personal style. A second and more likely scenario: The CEO is appointed by a person or group of people who make the right match. For instance, a board of directors decides that their organization needs strong strategic direction. What sort of CEO will they look for? Not someone who wants to spend a lot of time guiding and empowering individual employees, but someone who loves to get inside the data, someone with a proven talent for analyzing current market conditions, forecasting future ones, and mapping the route between them. The board will select a candidate who already acts like a chief strategist. Not surprisingly, given his or her performance in previous positions, the new CEO will continue to use the strategy approach and will be considered a \u201cnatural\u201d for the job. Until scientists discover a gene for leadership\u2014and think of the repercussions of that in business, not to mention politics\u2014the debate about personality will persist. Even if scientists find that leadership is more a case of nurture than of nature, there will still be those who think that only classic General Patton types can lead an organization to success. Our research indicates that leadership is more complicated than that, driven not so much by what someone is like inside but by what the outside demands.\n\n1. The Strategy Approach.\n\nCEOs who use this approach believe that their most important job is to create, test, and design the implementation of long-term strategy, extending in some cases into the distant future. Their position overseeing all areas of the corporation, they explain, gives them the unique ability to determine their organizations\u2019 allocation of resources and optimal direction. On a day-to-day basis, they spend their time in activities intended to ascertain their organizations\u2019 point of departure (the current business situation) and point of arrival (the most advantageous market position in the future). These CEOs devote approximately 80% of their time to matters external to the organization\u2019s operations\u2014customers, competitors, technological advances, and market trends\u2014as opposed to internal matters such as hiring or control systems. It follows, then, that they tend to value employees to whom they can delegate the day-to-day operation of their organizations as well as those who possess finely tuned analytical and planning skills.\n\n2. The Human-Assets Approach.\n\nIn marked contrast to CEOs in the above group, human-assets CEOs strongly believe that strategy formulation belongs close to the markets, in the business units. According to these CEOs, their primary job is to impart to their organizations certain values, behaviors, and attitudes by closely managing the growth and development of individuals. These executives travel constantly, spending the majority of their time in personnel-related activities such as recruiting, performance reviews, and career mapping. Their goal is to create a universe of satellite CEOs: people at every level of the organization who act and make decisions as the CEO would. Not surprisingly, these executives value long-term employees who consistently exhibit \u201ccompany way\u201d behaviors, as opposed to so-called mavericks, who do not always adhere to organizational norms.\n\n3. The Expertise Approach.\n\nExecutives who lead by using this approach believe that the CEO\u2019s most important responsibility is selecting and disseminating within the corporation an area of expertise that will be a source of competitive advantage. Their schedules show that they devote the majority of their time to activities related to the cultivation and continual improvement of the expertise, such as studying new technological research, analyzing competitors\u2019 products, and meeting with engineers and customers. They often focus on designing programs, systems, and procedures, such as promotion policies and training plans, that reward people who acquire the expertise and share it across the borders of business units and functions. These CEOs tend to hire people who are trained in the expertise, but they also seek candidates who possess flexible minds, lack biases, and demonstrate a willingness to be immersed\u2014indoctrinated is not too strong a word\u2014in the expertise.\n\n4. The Box Approach.\n\nCEOs in this category believe that they can add the most value in their organizations by creating, communicating, and monitoring an explicit set of controls\u2014financial, cultural, or both\u2014that ensure uniform, predictable behaviors and experiences for customers and employees. CEOs who use this approach believe that their companies\u2019 success depends on the ability to provide customers with a consistent and risk-free experience. As a result, these executives spend their days attending to exceptions to their organizations\u2019 controls, such as quarterly results that are below expectations or a project that misses its deadline. In addition, they devote more time than the other types of CEOs to developing detailed, prescriptive policies, procedures, and rewards to reinforce desired behaviors. Finally, these executives tend to value seniority within the organization, often promoting people with many years of service to the corporate team and rarely hiring top-level executives from outside the company.\n\n5. The Change Approach.\n\nExecutives in this category are guided by the belief that the CEO\u2019s most critical role is to create an environment of continual reinvention, even if such an environment produces anxiety and confusion, leads to some strategic mistakes, and temporarily hurts financial performance. In contrast to CEOs who employ the strategy approach, these CEOs focus not on a specific point of arrival for their organizations but on the process of getting there. Similarly, their focus contrasts starkly with that of a box leader: Control systems, written reports, planning cycles, policies, and rules do not seem to interest these so-called change agents. Instead, they spend as much as 75% of their time using speeches, meetings, and other forms of communication to motivate members of their organizations to embrace the gestalt of change. They spend their days in the field, meeting with a wide range of stakeholders, from customers to investors to suppliers to employees at virtually all levels of the organization. Not surprisingly, the people they value are usually those who could be called aggressive and independent\u2014people who view their jobs not as entitlements but as opportunities for advancement that must be seized every day. Seniority matters little to the change agent; passion, energy, and an openness to a new, reinvented tomorrow matter much more.\n\nExecutives who lead by using the change approach spend much of their time motivating employees through speeches and meetings.\n\nIn this article, we will describe the five leadership approaches in more detail and explore which business situations call for which approaches. There is, naturally, some overlap. CEOs who adopt the strategy approach might use elements of human-assets leadership, for example. Some box CEOs employ the techniques of a strategy leader to address the out-of-the-box issues that can be overlooked in control-oriented organizations. That said, however, our research suggests that in most effectively run organizations, CEOs select a dominant approach, using it as the compass and rudder that direct all corporate decisions and actions. Our research also suggests that a CEO\u2019s approach can and should change over the course of his or her tenure. As one of our subjects, Edzard Reuter, CEO of automaker Daimler-Benz, says, \u201cA business is a living organism. There will always be a point where the environment changes, the competition changes, something critical changes, and you must realize this and take the leading role in meeting change.\u201d\n\nWhatever the approach, then, the CEO\u2019s role is to act decisively and boldly\u2014a demand of high-level leadership taught only by on-the-job training.\n\nThe Strategy Approach: Focusing on the Future, Near and Far\n\nOf all the hypotheses we held at the start of our research, none felt as unassailable as our supposition that the vast majority of CEOs consider themselves the corporation\u2019s chief visionary, responsible for setting short- and long-term strategy. Our data told another story: Of the 160 executives we interviewed, less than 20% subscribed to that leadership approach. In fact, the prevailing opinion of our subjects was that those with the most frequent and meaningful contact with customers and competitors should be responsible for strategic assessment and planning. Peter George, chief executive of Ladbroke Group, a British gaming and hotel concern, puts it simply: \u201cStrategy is the domain of the business units because the people running them are closest to the markets.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, we did encounter a distinct group of CEOs guided by the belief that their position gives them the best vantage point for making decisions about capital allocations, resource management, investments in technology, new products, and locations for doing business. For this reason, they assert, the CEO alone (although often supported by a small corporate team) is equipped to determine exactly where the company in all its parts and units should go, and how fast.\n\nOpen a strategy CEO\u2019s schedule book. What you will see is time allotted with a common theme: the collection, cultivation, and analysis of data. These CEOs devote much of their days to the activities that ultimately yield strategic decisions. They rigorously gather and test information about markets, economic trends, customers\u2019 purchasing patterns, competitors\u2019 capabilities, and other matters external to their organizations\u2019 operations. To increase their sources of data, these executives frequently use company task forces or outside consultants and eagerly draw on other sources of information and opinion, such as fundamental research, trade publications, and independent surveys. Strategy CEOs strive to understand how their customers behave and what really matters to them. They also seek to know as much as possible about every competitor\u2019s strengths, technologies, and key customer segments. Moreover, a strategy CEO focuses on knowing the organization\u2019s capabilities, or how well the organization can deliver on its strategy. What can the company do? What can\u2019t it do? What are its lowest costs, highest quality, and fastest speed of delivery? In sum, strategy leaders devote themselves to understanding the company\u2019s point of departure, selecting its point of arrival, and, perhaps most important, mapping the route between them.\n\nOpen a strategy CEO\u2019s schedule book and you\u2019ll see time devoted to collecting, cultivating, and analyzing vast amounts of data.\n\nHow do they achieve all that? More than executives in any other category, strategy CEOs employ extensive analysis as well as reporting and planning systems that test strategic scenarios, and they often focus the work of their corporate teams around these systems. For example, Coca-Cola\u2019s CEO, Roberto Goizueta, oversees a program in which country managers spend three days every six months in planning sessions with the top corporate team, examining every aspect of their businesses. \u201cWe debate what we are doing right, what is working, and what we are doing wrong,\u201d says John Hunter, principal operating officer and executive vice president for the company\u2019s international operations. \u201cWe talk about strategies for the next year and the next three years. We ask, \u2018What\u2019s going to change in terms of our consumer, our market, the marketplace environment, the competitors, and our bottler system?\u2019 We run down and review all these things, and then we say, \u2018Where do we need to be three years from now and what do we need to do to get there?\u2019\u201d Several weeks after these meetings, the country managers fly to Coke\u2019s headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, to present their one- and three-year strategic plans and operating budgets in another demanding process of debate, testing, and planning. As is the case at many companies led by strategy CEOs, these kinds of sessions are supplemented by several other forums throughout the year devoted to strategy analysis and formulation.\n\nMichael Dell of Dell Computer is another CEO who plots his company\u2019s short- and long-term strategic path by gathering vast amounts of data. The company, which assembles personal computers, has specially trained employees who take 50,000 phone calls from customers every day and document and organize their comments, which are then distributed to managers. In addition, every Friday, Dell managers from every functional area in every plant and office around the world gather in customer-advocate meetings, in which a dissatisfied customer addresses the managers over a speakerphone. \u201cThe point is to sensitize the entire organization to the customer,\u201d Dell explains. \u201cWe want to make everyone literally hear the voice of the customer, to hear the frustration when we do something that makes it difficult to use our products.\u201d Phone calls from customers are also used to spark ideas for new products and services. As a result of many calls from people wondering if Dell made a small, powerful notebook computer, for example, the company began assembling and distributing a 100-megahertz Pentium-chip model. Dell was among the first to market with the product. Michael Dell himself also logs on to the Internet on a daily basis, scanning the bulletin boards and chat rooms used most frequently by industry insiders and computer devotees for information and opinions about market trends and for reactions to his company\u2019s\u2014and his competitors\u2019\u2014products.\n\nWhat makes a CEO decide to take on the role of chief strategist? Our research indicates that neither industry type nor a company\u2019s national origin seems to be a determining factor. Instead, one relevant issue appears to be the level of complexity in the company or industry, in terms of technology, geography, or organizational structure. Coca-Cola, for example, has 32,000 employees in nearly 200 countries around the world. The volume and pace of change seem particularly relevant as well. The less stable the situation, the more likely the CEO is to believe that he or she must be both lookout and navigator. To play those roles well, we heard, the CEO needs all the data-driven insight that this approach to leadership generates. Finally, we found that the strategy approach is often selected by CEOs who must frequently make decisions that have enormous consequences. Again, this approach provides the kind of information and involves the sort of testing and planning that well-calculated risk taking requires.\n\nThe Human-Assets Approach: Managing One Person at a Time\n\nNot every CEO who adopts the human-assets approach thinks that strategy belongs in the business units, but most do. Their companies, many of the CEOs in this category explain, are either too complex or, interestingly, too straightforward to make long-term strategic planning a wise use of the CEO\u2019s time. Instead, these executives believe that in their particular organizations, success depends on superior execution\u2014the way members of their companies make decisions, interact with customers, roll out new products, or design programs to deflect or defeat the competition. Accordingly, they believe that their imperative is to hire and cultivate the kind of individuals who will act intelligently, swiftly, and appropriately without direct or constant supervision. And they believe the way to develop such individuals is by shaping the values and behaviors of virtually every member of the organization into \u201ccompany way\u201d values and behaviors through a coherent set of systems, programs, and policies. Our research indicates that this approach to leadership is the second most prevalent after the box approach and is employed by about 22% of the CEOs we surveyed.\n\nSome companies are too complex or too straightforward to make long-term planning a wise use of the CEO\u2019s time.\n\nAs a group, human-assets CEOs communicate and demonstrate what they want face-to-face. Their travel schedules rival that of a secretary of state or foreign minister, with as much as 90% of their time spent out of the office. \u201cPeople have asked me time and again, \u2018Why do you spend all that time traveling?\u2019 And the answer to that is really kind of simple,\u201d says Al Zeien, CEO of Gillette, the personal-care-products company with 34,000 employees worldwide. \u201cI travel because that\u2019s where the people are. I travel because I want to be sure that people who are making the decisions in, say, Argentina have the same reference base as I do for the company. I want to make sure they are all using the same ground rules I would use. I want to see if they have the same objectives. I travel because you can only find these kinds of things on the home ground.\u201d\n\nHuman-assets CEOs have travel schedules that rival that of a secretary of state, with as much as 90% of their time spent out of the office.\n\nWhile they are traveling, human-assets CEOs tend to focus on several specific aspects of corporate policy. The first of these is hiring, an area that occupies human-assets CEOs more than it does chief executives in any other category. At PepsiCo, for example, CEO Wayne Calloway interviews every candidate for the top 600 jobs in the company. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re going to work in Pakistan or Philadelphia\u2014I get to talk to them,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have the chance to get to know each other and make sure we have the same values and objectives and standards in mind. That way, when they\u2019re back in Pakistan and somebody wants to do something, they will say, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s not what I heard, and I heard it straight from Calloway himself, so I think that\u2019s not what we ought to be doing.\u2019\u201d Calloway, like many other human-assets CEOs, also occasionally monitors hiring at lower levels of the organization. For example, he was once involved in hiring two new M.B.A.\u2019s into PepsiCo\u2019s office in Wichita, Kansas. Similarly, Herb Kelleher of Southwest Airlines says that he has participated in the selection of ramp agents at small regional airports. Hiring, he explains, is \u201cwhere it starts. It\u2019s the head of the river, and if you pollute that, then you gradually pollute everything downstream.\u201d Speaking more generally of his approach to leadership, Kelleher sounds another theme of human-assets CEOs: \u201cWe hire great attitudes, and we\u2019ll teach them any functionality that they need.\u201d\n\nHuman-assets CEOs also focus on other areas of personnel management, such as training, incentives, career planning, and programs to increase retention. Al Zeien, for instance, personally conducts 800 performance reviews per year at Gillette, monitoring employees for their commitment to acting in ways that benefit the entire company, not just their units or countries. He attends product development meetings in virtually every division of the company to monitor R&D efforts, of course, but also to identify star employees whom he can point in directions they might not otherwise go. He once, for example, engineered the move of a manager from New Zealand to Gillette\u2019s operations in Redwood City, California, because he thought that the manager showed great promise and that the transfer would benefit the man\u2019s career and the company. The New Zealander\u2019s boss had told Zeien that the man would never leave his native country, so Zeien did what any human-assets CEO would do: He flew to New Zealand to convince the employee in person. The man accepted the appointment.\n\nOther human-assets CEOs show the same kind of attention to personnel matters. At the British food manufacturer United Biscuits, for example, chief executive Eric Nicoli oversees a system that evaluates the performance of hundreds of employees semiannually. The goal is to ensure that \u201cmotivated, caring, and optimistic\u201d members of the organization are identified and rewarded, and that others are retrained or let go. Echoing many other CEOs in this category, Nicoli notes that close attention to so many individuals and careers requires an enormous commitment of time but that it is the only way to manage an operation in which the CEO simply cannot be everywhere or know everything.\n\nAlthough most human-assets CEOs tend to value employees who display predictable \u201ccompany way\u201d values such as honesty and loyalty to the corporation, they also believe in individual empowerment. These CEOs can and do give authority to members of the organization to act quickly and freely, without corporate approval. This authority to act is awarded only to employees who already conform to the company\u2019s way of doing things. But in organizations led by effective human-assets CEOs, this group of proven team players is often large. Consider what happened at Southwest Airlines when Midway Airlines went out of business in 1991. Within hours of Midway\u2019s announcement, Southwest employees from Dallas had physically taken over every Midway gate at the Chicago airport. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know they were going to Chicago when they left. They didn\u2019t call me first,\u201d Kelleher recalls. \u201cThey came in later and said, \u2018Hey, Chief, we just did something; we thought you might like to know about it.\u2019\u201d They never doubted his approval, Kelleher notes, because \u201cwe have such a great congruency among our people.\u201d Congruency of values, and of the actions born from them in the daily execution of corporate strategy, is the essence of the human-assets approach.\n\nThe Expertise Approach: Championing Knowledge\n\nA small but distinct portion of the CEOs we interviewed, less than 15%, say that their main role is to select, cultivate, and spread a competitive expertise up, down, and across the business units of the organization. Put another way, these chief executives believe that they must create a specific capability that will allow the organization to differentiate itself from its competitors and will thereby lead the company to a position of sustainable advantage. Expertise, we found, can be a process. Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of the South African mining company Anglo American, devotes the bulk of his time to honing and disseminating within the organization the company\u2019s unique competence in deep-mining technologies. Expertise can be a package of ideas and techniques, such as the focus on the brand-consumer relationship that drives the leadership of Charlotte Beers, CEO of the international advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather. Expertise can also be a concept. At Motorola, the CEO\u2019s commitment to unassailable quality defines the work of the corporate office. When does a CEO decide to use the expertise approach? When he or she believes that a well-conceived, carefully developed area of competence is the surest way to gain and sustain a competitive advantage.\n\nIn their daily activities, expertise CEOs cover more organizational territory than CEOs from any other category because they do not become as involved in operational details. Instead, they focus on shaping corporate policies that will strengthen their organizations\u2019 competencies. In hiring, for example, expertise CEOs do not generally conduct interviews. They do, however, design and monitor the policies behind the hiring process to ensure that their companies will attract candidates who are experienced in the area of expertise or who seem inclined to become fully immersed in it. Similarly, expertise CEOs make sure that their companies\u2019 incentive programs reward employees who cultivate the expertise and share it with colleagues. And they design control and reporting systems that track their companies\u2019 missions and establish a focal point for all activity in the corporation. Expertise CEOs usually do not devote much time to gathering or analyzing data. But they direct those who perform that work to collect data that will help them determine which types of knowledge or competencies are relevant to consumers, which competitors have the edge, and how much it will cost to be the best.\n\nAn expertise CEO spends much of his or her time focusing the organization on its area of expertise and sending strong messages about the company\u2019s priorities. At Motorola, for example, former CEO Robert Galvin would walk out of meetings about a business unit\u2019s performance after quality figures were discussed, vividly demonstrating what he deemed the company\u2019s unique competence and his number one concern. CEOs who lead in this way, however, don\u2019t just preach the gospel of their selected expertise; they are proficient at creating programs or systems that reinforce it. At Houston-based Cooper Industries, which specializes in basic low-tech manufacturing, CEO Robert Cizik deploys \u201cSWAT teams\u201d of manufacturing experts from within the company that travel from division to division to investigate and upgrade factory-floor practices and equipment. The teams have clout: Their reports go directly to the CEO\u2019s office, and a yearlong stint on one of these teams is mandatory for managers who want to move up in the organization. At Anglo American, Ogilvie Thompson has developed a cadre of highly skilled men and women, called \u201cconsulting engineers,\u201d who travel to the company\u2019s operations around the world and serve as line managers wherever they go. The consulting engineers, he says, \u201cpick up an idea from the chaps at Premier diamond mine, who are running the operations with skill, and are able to transfer this idea to the DeBeers group mines in Namibia or Botswana, really for free, adding value to others.\u201d Ogilvie Thompson\u2019s commitment to this group\u2014he often personally decides who becomes a consulting engineer and determines where each will be assigned\u2014reflects his commitment to the company\u2019s expertise.\n\nCEOs who use the expertise approach don\u2019t just preach the gospel of their expertise; they create programs to reinforce it.\n\nExpertise CEOs formed the smallest group that emerged in our research. The reason, we believe, lies in the difficulty of sustaining the approach. With the free flow of information and people between companies and countries, expertise is hard to keep proprietary. In addition, an expertise won\u2019t remain relevant for long in an ever changing marketplace. Virtually every CEO in this category acknowledges these challenges. Cooper\u2019s Robert Cizik believes that his company will soon need to embrace a new competence to stay ahead. And Charlotte Beers notes that competitors can and do \u201cborrow\u201d the marketing techniques Ogilvy & Mather pioneered, the brand print and brand probe. But like many proponents of this approach, Beers advocates expertise leadership for focusing an organization on what it must do to compete and win.\n\nThe Box Approach: Applying the Pressure of Orthodoxy\n\nFrom the most entrepreneurial software company to the most conservative bank, every company has a box\u2014a set of procedural, financial, and cultural controls to which members of the organization must conform. All CEOs spend some of their time designing and maintaining controls, and evaluating the performance of business units and employees relative to those controls. But CEOs who are truly box leaders view these tasks as their primary responsibility. Our research shows that CEOs using this approach are often running companies in highly regulated industries, such as banking, or in industries in which safety is a paramount concern, such as airlines. These executives explain that their business situations allow virtually no margin for error, a reality that turns the design and application of strict controls into the CEO\u2019s highest priority.\n\nAll CEOs spend some of their time designing and maintaining controls, but true box leaders see this as their main responsibility.\n\nBox CEOs often sound remarkably similar to human-assets executives. Leaders from both categories say that they are trying to build organizations in which each individual, in any circumstance, will act just as the CEO would. But instead of using personnel development and the inculcation of values as their means, box CEOs use control systems. Many of these executives say that \u201cbuilding frameworks\u201d and \u201cdrawing boundaries\u201d are their primary responsibilities. In other words, they create explicit rules and rewards for acceptable behaviors, outcomes, and results. With such controls in place, box CEOs spend much of their time attending to the exceptions\u2014tracking down the reasons for missed deadlines, unexpected losses, or below-average performances of divisions or employees. These CEOs frequently use internal reviews and external audits, employee rating scales, strict policies, and financial reports. They usually spend their days at corporate headquarters meeting with the managers responsible for business units or with other members of the corporate team, and scrutinizing proposals for new programs or requests for resource allocations. They study reports from the field concerning performance, often request additional data, and rigorously question what they see and hear. Finally, box CEOs tend to be intensely involved in company communications, both external and internal. Maurice Lippens, chairman of Fortis, an international financial-services company based in Belgium, puts an umbrella over all these activities when he describes his most important role as \u201capplying the pressure of orthodoxy to the corporation.\u201d This phrase captures the essence of the box CEO.\n\nThirty percent of the CEOs we interviewed devote enough of their time and attention to the techniques mentioned above to be considered box leaders. Lippens, for example, employs hundreds of auditors to monitor the performance of each business unit on an ongoing basis and benchmark it against other units as well as competitors. At HSBC Holdings, formerly known as HongKong Shanghai Banking Company, chief executive John Bond oversees guidelines that control every aspect of the company\u2019s information technology system. The small staff of experts who run the bank\u2019s computer network are located at headquarters in London and are charged with maintaining a system that cannot \u201cbe tinkered with,\u201d in Bond\u2019s words. Moreover, Bond carefully monitors other aspects of the bank\u2019s information systems. \u201cEvery unit writes a technology plan each year on what they plan to spend on development, what they plan to spend on operations, and what equipment they plan to buy,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is reviewed here down to the last PC, and we will say, \u2018You don\u2019t need to buy a new computer in Malaysia; we can supply it from Indonesia.\u2019 We can control the movement of equipment around the world from London, and I can assure you it is a very detailed plan, but it isn\u2019t very popular.\u201d\n\nBond is not the only box CEO who acknowledges the negative side effects of the approach. Control systems can be stifling for those at the receiving end. But he also notes, like many other executives in this category, that the box approach brings enormous clarity and predictability, both of which can be powerful competitive weapons. \u201cWe believe ours is a business based on trust,\u201d Bond says of HSBC Holdings, which operates 3,000 banking offices in 68 countries. The company\u2019s control system leads to consistent performance by tellers and credit officers branch to branch, country to country, year to year. Such consistency begets trust. \u201cThe customers love it,\u201d Bond says.\n\nControl systems can be stifling, but they bring clarity and predictability\u2014two powerful competitive weapons.\n\nThe box approach is most prevalent in industries that demand strict procedural and financial controls, but we also found some CEOs using controls that were more cultural in nature. One example is Claude B\u00e9b\u00e9ar, president of AXA Group, an international insurance company based in France. B\u00e9b\u00e9ar has invented a language of words and symbols in an effort to create uniform priorities, behaviors, and goals among the organization\u2019s 50,000 employees in 12 countries. The language includes phrases such as \u201cTNT action\u201d and \u201cthe trap of immobility.\u201d Employees across units and national borders are encouraged to use the first phrase to express the rapid implementation of decisions and the second to describe where people find themselves when they are unwilling to change. The point of the shared language, B\u00e9b\u00e9ar says, is to create a corps of like-minded employees who freely and clearly exchange intelligence and technical advice, both of which are competitive weapons in the decentralized insurance and financial services markets. Called AXAnetics, the company\u2019s language is taught annually to thousands of employees in a French castle recently converted into the company\u2019s university.\n\nThe president of AXA has invented a special language to try to unify 50,000 employees.\n\nDespite their attention to control systems, almost all box CEOs devote some time to cultivating, in small doses, the kind of creative, nonconformist behavior that their approach usually does not reward. At BankAmerica, for instance, chairman Richard Rosenberg reads dozens of internal newsletters in search of fresh and innovative marketing ideas\u2014and thinkers\u2014to introduce to the rest of the organization. At NatWest Group, one of the United Kingdom\u2019s largest banks, chief executive Derek Wanless leads several teams of employees in an effort to draw individuals out of their highly structured roles and to encourage them to bring their creativity to issues such as diversity and new products and services. And at British Airways, chairman Colin Marshall regularly travels to airports and BA offices to meet with small groups of employees for sessions of what he calls \u201clistening to the moaning.\u201d Marshall admits that he sometimes hears complaints about the company\u2019s degree of centralized authority. But he is quick to point out that, for the most part, people at BA do in fact understand the purpose of the organization\u2019s tight controls. Speaking for many CEOs in this category, he asserts that of all the leadership approaches, the box approach is the best way to deliver what the customer wants most: no surprises.\n\nThe Change Approach: Upending the Status Quo\n\nIt\u2019s hard to be a CEO today without talking about the importance of change. With all the positive press change gets, virtually every constituent group, from shareholders to employees, expects to hear that change is under way or at least planned for the near future. Indeed, the majority of CEOs in our study, even those who use the box approach, talk about initiating, championing, or simply overseeing change. But a much smaller group, about 15% of the total, actually fall into the category of change agents. These CEOs identify their chief role as directing the complete overhaul of practically everything about their companies, down to the fundamental underpinnings.\n\nUnlike strategy CEOs, change agents focus not on where their organizations will end up but on how they will get there. These CEOs cultivate an environment of constant questioning and risk taking, and frequent reinvention of business practices and products. Change, these CEOs explain, is the best way to deliver consistently extraordinary results. It should be noted that the CEOs we identified as change agents are all leading profitable organizations. But they still believe that deeply entrenched ways of doing business will ultimately be their companies\u2019 undoing. Their job, as they see it, is to create an environment of constant renewal. Indeed, a leitmotiv of our conversations with these chief executives was their goal of building not just better organizations but organizations that enthusiastically embrace ambiguity, uncertainty, and upheaval.\n\nUnlike strategy CEOs, change agents focus not on where their organizations will end up but on how they will get there.\n\nCompared with CEOs in other categories, change agents are rather unconcerned with financial or procedural controls, written reports, planning cycles, and guidelines. They spend their days meeting with employees, customers, suppliers, and shareholders to champion change and encourage others to do the same\u2014or at least to be patient while change is under way. Virtually no one is neglected. Change agents visit factories to talk with line workers, attend company picnics, and answer their E-mail and voice mail messages daily.\n\nAll areas of corporate policy do, in relatively even doses, receive the change agent\u2019s attention. But if any area receives special attention, it is compensation, perhaps because pay and promotion are two of the most powerful tools for overcoming the aversion many people have to what is new and unpredictable. The first official act of many change agents, in fact, is to revamp their companies\u2019 performance-review and reward systems. Managers responsible for recruiting, for example, are instructed to hire nonconformists and risk takers, and then receive bonuses for doing so. Engineers or scientists in R&D are compensated for breakthrough products rather than product extensions. Stephen Friedman, the former managing partner of the investment bank Goldman Sachs, relates an example of how his organization realigned rewards to promote change. When the bank\u2019s leadership team initially decided that the organization had to expand internationally to stay competitive, there were few volunteers for its foreign offices. \u201cIt was just not valued as an attractive career opportunity by most of our U.S. people, and their spouses didn\u2019t necessarily want to go, and their dogs couldn\u2019t possibly endure living in Tokyo,\u201d Friedman recalls. \u201cSo we took an exceptionally talented young banker and promoted him to partner two years ahead of his class because he went to Asia at great personal sacrifice.\u201d\n\nInitially, a change agent often revamps a company\u2019s performance-review and reward systems.\n\nFriedman recounts another experience that illustrates one of the change agent\u2019s most important techniques: consensus building. Because change can be extremely disconcerting to members of an organization, change agents must often shepherd new ideas over rough terrain. For example, one of Friedman\u2019s first steps as a change agent in the early 1980s was to form a strategic planning committee in the investment banking division. \u201cWe composed the committee of bright, iconoclastic, younger people below the senior managerial levels, so they had no compulsion to defend the status quo,\u201d he says. Several members of this committee suggested that Goldman get into the junk bond business. Friedman came to support the idea, but he knew that his personal enthusiasm wouldn\u2019t carry the day within the bank, long a bastion of conservatism. For help, Friedman asked an experienced partner, widely considered to be among the bank\u2019s most intelligent and cautious, to conduct a study to determine whether and how Goldman should enter the junk bond business. \u201cHe came to the same conclusion we did, but with a lot more documentation and some useful refinements,\u201d Friedman says. \u201cAnd now he had bought in and was behind the plan. It had establishment blessing.\u201d\n\nChange agents often combine consensus building with another, somewhat contradictory technique: occasional public and dramatic displays of top management\u2019s strong support for new ways of doing business. At Tenneco, CEO Dana Mead sets virtually unattainable financial targets for the business units and then actually incorporates them into the budget. He requires Tenneco\u2019s five divisional CEOs to give monthly presentations about their performance relative to those targets in an open forum. \u201cThe pressure this builds is terrific, and it works,\u201d he notes. Mead, like many other executives in this category, relies heavily on company newsletters to communicate, and many change agents create monthly or quarterly videos that extol areas of their companies that have come up with innovative products or programs. CEOs in this category also communicate through their actions, firing high-profile managers who are not effecting change quickly enough, or divesting entire divisions for the same reason. J.P. Bolduc, the former CEO of W.R. Grace, recalls that he sold a Belgian mattress-ticking manufacturer that was one of the company\u2019s best-performing subsidiaries because it didn\u2019t fit into his new, \u201creinvented\u201d vision of the company. The move, he says, put W.R. Grace in \u201ccultural shock.\u201d But, he adds, \u201cnobody believed what we were trying to do, so it became clear we had to break through the sound barrier.\u201d This kind of move appears to be the flip side of the change agent\u2019s use of consensus building, but the two form sum and substance of the approach.\n\nFinally, change agents are distinct in their enthusiasm for the kinds of individuals who are often unwelcome in other types of organizations. These CEOs tend to value, as Dana Mead puts it, \u201crecalcitrants, troublemakers, or gadflies.\u201d Mead admits that such people don\u2019t always make for smooth meetings, but they do raise the kinds of questions and launch the kinds of plans that lead to substantial change. As an example, Mead points to an employee he hired soon after his appointment as CEO. The man had come to the United States as a refugee, worked his way through Stanford University, and then went on to become a White House Fellow. \u201cHe is the most aggressive, smartest guy you have ever seen, but he can stir things up and step on toes,\u201d Mead says, noting that he has had to placate the man\u2019s direct bosses more than once. But, he adds, \u201che is exactly the mold we would like to see around here. He brings in some very exciting projects for us, and he delivers results.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, our research suggests that a CEO who takes on the role of change agent takes on perhaps the most demanding and daunting of the five leadership approaches. Change is almost always accompanied by controversy, discomfort, and resistance. All the change agents in our survey comment on this frustrating reality. They also describe how this approach often forces them to rise above their natural inclinations to move more slowly or give people more leeway. That is, the change approach sometimes requires people to lead in ways inconsistent with their personalities. But Stephen Friedman speaks for many change agents when he describes the approach as more of a calling than a management style. \u201cChange for the sake of change makes no sense, of course,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you\u2019re not working for constructive strategic change, then you are the steward of something that must, by definition, erode. Competitors will surpass you, and clients will find you less relevant. If that was your approach, why would you even want the job?\u201d\n\nA Framework for Understanding Leadership\n\nDuring a recent forum on business in the year 2001, we were asked if we had concluded from our research that, in fact, CEOs were becoming obsolete. With business units in so many companies independently making decisions that used to be the sole right of the corporate office, the questioning went, what was really left for the CEO to do all day? How could he or she continue to add value?\n\nOur immediate answer was that CEOs do play a relevant role in business. That role is leadership, but not leadership defined as an outgrowth of a strong and charismatic personality\u2014a talent born and not made. Some people are naturally given to inspiring the troops and leading charges, but business leaders must also create a clear purpose and direction for an organization. And they must align all corporate systems with that direction for a sustained period and build organizational commitment to common goals. The five approaches that emerged from our research are the five ways that many CEOs choose to deliver clarity, consistency, and commitment.\n\nIn the course of our research, we encountered thriving organizations and those in severe crisis. What role does the CEO\u2019s approach to leadership play? Does a well-planned approach correctly matched to the business situation yield success? We are still analyzing that fundamental issue. A strong link appears to exist, but we cannot yet demonstrate a direct correlation.\n\nWhat we can state definitively from our research thus far is not exactly what we set out to find. We have found that some CEOs simply do not lead, try as they might. Some employ a little of each of the five leadership approaches simultaneously, destroying organizational focus and thus organizational effectiveness. For some, their days are driven by whatever event appears on their calendars or whatever crises erupt. Others act according to their natural inclinations, doing what feels enjoyable and easy. At best, those ways of leading create confusion; at worst, they create misguided or unguided organizations. Either way, they are a mistake. The stakes are too high for a chief executive to lead without conscious intent.\n\nThe stakes are too high for a CEO to lead without clarity, consistency, and commitment.\n\nThe five approaches that emerged from our research are certainly not boilerplate solutions for success, nor are they rigid roles in which all CEOs can be cast. Business is too complex for such simple analysis. But the five approaches do offer a framework for understanding how CEOs manage to give structure and meaning to their infinite jobs, learning to lead as they go."}, {"url": "https://www.companieshistory.com/dell/", "page_content": "0 Views\n\nDell Inc. history, profile and history video\n\nMichael Dell founded the company in 1984 from his Texas dorm room, starting a new computer business under the name of PC\u2019s Limited. Today Dell is the world\u2019s #3 supplier of PCs (behind #1 HP and #2 Lenovo). Dell provides a broad range of technology products for the consumer, education, enterprise, and government sectors. In addition to its line of desktop and notebook PCs, Dell offers network servers, data storage systems, printers, Ethernet switches, and peripherals, such as displays and projectors. Its 25-year history of running as a public company came to end in September when shareholders voted in favor of Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners\u2019 $25 billion bid to take Dell private.\u201d\n\n\u201c Dell History\n\nDell traces its origins to 1984, when Michael Dell created PC\u2019s Limited while a student of the University of Texas at Austin. The dorm-room headquartered company sold IBM PC-compatible computers built from stock components. Dell dropped out of school to focus full-time on his fledgling business, after getting about $300,000 in expansion-capital from his family. In 1985, the company produced the first computer of its own design, the Turbo PC, which sold for $795. PC\u2019s Limited advertised its systems in national computer magazines for sale directly to consumers and custom assembled each ordered unit according to a selection of options. The company grossed more than $73 million in its first year of operation.\n\nIn 1986, Michael Dell brought in Lee Walker, a 51-year-old venture capitalist, as president and chief operating officer, to serve as Michael\u2019s mentor and implement Michael\u2019s ideas for growing the company. Walker was also instrumental in recruiting members to the board of directors when the company went public in 1988. Walker retired in 1990 due to health, and Michael Dell hired Morton Meyerson, former CEO and president of Electronic Data Systems to transform the company from a fast-growing medium-sized firm into a billion-dollar enterprise.\n\nThe company changed its name to Dell Computer Corporation in 1988 and began expanding globally. In June 1988, Dell\u2019s market capitalization grew by $30 million to $80 million from its June 22 initial public offering of 3.5 million shares at $8.50 a share. In 1992, Fortune magazine included Dell Computer Corporation in its list of the world\u2019s 500 largest companies, making Michael Dell the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company ever.\n\nIn 1993, to complement its own direct sales channel, Dell planned to sell PCs at big-box retail outlets such as Wal-Mart, which would have brought in an additional $125 million in annual revenue. However, Bain consultant Kevin Rollins persuaded Michael Dell to pull out of these deals, believing they would be money losers in the long run. Indeed, margins at retail were thin at best and Dell left the reseller channel in 1994. Rollins would soon join Dell full-time and eventually become the company President and CEO.\u201d\n\nOn October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire EMC. This acquisition would combine Dell\u2019s enterprise server, personal computer, and mobile businesses with EMC\u2019s enterprise storage business in a significant Vertical merger of IT giants.\n\nOn September 7, 2016, Dell Inc. completed the merger with EMC Corp.

They're tools of communication, they're tools of creativity, and they can be shaped by their user.\"\n\nEarly Life\n\nBill Gates (full name: William Henry Gates III) was born on Oct. 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington, the son of William H. Gates Sr., an attorney, and Mary Maxwell, a businesswoman and bank executive who served on the University of Washington Board of Regents from 1975 to 1993. He has two sisters.\n\nGates wrote his first software program at 13 and in high school was part of a group, which also included childhood friend Paul Allen, that computerized their school\u2019s payroll system and developed Traf-O-Data, a traffic-counting system that they sold to local governments. Gates and Allen wanted to start their own company immediately, but Gates' parents wanted him to finish high school and go on to college, hoping he eventually would become a lawyer.\n\nIn 1975 Gates, then a sophomore at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts, joined Allen, who was working as a programmer for Honeywell near Boston, to write software for the first microcomputers, later called PCs. They started by adapting BASIC, a popular programming language for large computers.\n\nStarting Microsoft\n\nWith the success of this project, Gates left Harvard during his junior year and, with Allen, moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, planning to develop software for the newly emerging personal computer market. In 1975 they started what Allen named Micro-Soft by combining \"micro\" from \"microcomputers\" and \"soft\" from \"software.\" The hyphen later was dropped. In 1979, they moved the company to Bellevue, Washington, just east of Seattle.\n\nBill Gates with Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Doug Wilson / Corbis Historical / Getty Images\n\nMicrosoft became famous for its computer operating systems and killer business deals. In 1980, Gates and Allen licensed an operating system called MS-DOS to IBM, at the time the world's largest computer maker, for its first microcomputer, the IBM PC. They were smart enough to retain the right to license the operating system to other companies, which eventually made them a fortune.\n\nFinding Success\n\nBy 1983, the year Allen left the company for health reasons, Microsoft's reach had become global with offices in Great Britain and Japan and 30% of the world's computers running on its software.\n\nA few years earlier, Gates had developed a partnership with Apple to work on some shared projects. Gates soon realized that Apple's graphics interface, which displayed text and images on the screen and was driven by a mouse, appealed to the average user more than Microsoft's text-and-keyboard-driven MS-DOS system.\n\nHe launched an ad campaign claiming that Microsoft was developing an operating system that would use a graphic interface similar to Apple's products. Called \"Windows,\" it would be compatible with all MS-DOS system software. The announcement was a bluff\u2014Microsoft had no such program under development\u2014but it was sheer genius as a marketing tactic: It would encourage people using MS-DOS to wait for new Windows software releases instead of changing to another system, such as Apple's Macintosh.\n\nBill Gates in 1985, the year the first Windows operating system was launched. Deborah Feingold / Corbis Historical / Getty Images\n\nIn November 1985, nearly two years after his announcement, Gates and Microsoft launched Windows. Then, in 1989, Microsoft launched Microsoft Office, which bundled office applications such as Microsoft Word and Excel into one system.\n\nPerils of Success\n\nAll the while, Gates was defending Microsoft against lawsuits and Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice investigations of claims charging unfair dealings with computer manufacturers. Yet the innovation continued. Windows 95 was launched in 1995 and in 2001 Microsoft debuted the original Xbox gaming system. Microsoft appeared untouchable.\n\nIn 2000, Gates stepped down as Microsoft CEO and was succeeded by Harvard friend and longtime Microsoft executive Steve Ballmer. Gates assumed the new role of chief software architect. In 2008 Gates left his \"daily\" job at Microsoft but retained his position as board chairman until 2014, when he stepped down as chairman but retained a board seat and began serving as technology adviser.\n\nMarriage and Family\n\nOn Jan. 1, 1994, Gates married Melinda French, who has an MBA and a bachelor's degree in computer science and met him while she was working at Microsoft. They have three children\u2014Jennifer, Rory, and Phoebe\u2014and live in Xanadu 2.0, a 66,000-square-foot mansion overlooking Lake Washington in Medina, Washington.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nGates and his wife founded the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with the mission of improving the quality of life for people around the world, primarily in the areas of global health and learning. Their initiatives have ranged from funding tuition for 20,000 college students to installing 47,000 computers in 11,000 libraries in all 50 states. In 2005, Bill and Melinda Gates and rock star Bono were named Time magazine persons of the year for their charitable work.\n\nIn 2016 President Obama awarded both Bill and Melinda Gates the Presidential Medal of Freedom for their Foundation's charitable work.

While Cheney worked as an aid to Wisconsin Gov. Warren Knowles, his wife received a doctorate in British literature from the University of Wisconsin. She later served as chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH; 1986\u201393), where she was criticized by liberals for undermining the agency and by conservatives for opposing the closure of a controversial NEH-funded exhibit by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe in Cincinnati, Ohio.

He played a central, controversial role in conveying intelligence reports that Saddam Hussein of Iraq had developed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in violation of resolutions passed by the United Nations\u2014reports used by the Bush administration to initiate the Iraq War. However, Iraq had no WMDs that could be found. Following the collapse of Saddam\u2019s regime, Cheney\u2019s former company, Halliburton, secured lucrative reconstruction contracts from the U.S. government, raising the spectre of favouritism and possible wrongdoing\u2014allegations that damaged Cheney\u2019s public reputation. Critics, who had long charged Cheney with being a secretive public servant, included members of Congress who brought suit against him for not disclosing records used to form the national energy policy.\n\nAfter leaving office in 2009, Cheney remained in the public eye, often speaking on political matters. In 2010 he suffered his fifth heart attack. Two years later he had a heart transplant. His autobiography, In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir (cowritten with his daughter Liz Cheney), was published in 2011. Cheney also wrote, with his heart surgeon, Heart: An American Medical Odyssey (2013) and, with Liz Cheney, Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America (2015)."}, {"url": "https://fortune.com/2021/01/31/tootsie-roll-ceo-ellen-gordon-tr-stock-shares-gamestop/", "page_content": "In her 53 years running sweets maker Tootsie Roll Industries, CEO Ellen Gordon has seen a lot of things. But one thing she hadn\u2019t before this week was her company\u2019s stock getting swept up in stock market madness as day traders feuded with hedge funds.\n\nWhile GameStop and AMC Entertainment were the headline grabbers, Tootsie Roll was briefly pulled along by retail traders swapping tips on a Reddit board, r/WallStreetBets. Tootsie Roll\u2019s stock had been minding its own business last week, trading steadily around the $30 mark, and then the stock exploded in the following days, almost doubling to an all-time high of $58.98 on Wednesday before giving some of that gain back. And all that on no news at all (Tootsie Roll\u2019s sales declines caused by the pandemic had long been known).\n\nAt one point this week, the stock moves made Tootsie Roll worth more than $4 billion. And in turn, it made Gordon, who became CEO in 2015 at the age of 83 when she replaced her deceased husband, a multibillionaire with her 55% stake, according to Bloomberg Data, worth $2.2 billion. Not bad for a company taking in about $500 million a year in sales.\n\nThe media-shy Gordon who eschews the quarterly conference calls with Wall Street analysts customary for public companies, has not yet responded to a request for an interview from Fortune.\n\nDeeply ingrained in American culture, the candy maker\u2019s namesake product was invented in New York in 1896 from a recipe concocted by Austrian immigrant Leo Hirschfield and named after his daughter\u2019s nickname. (The Tootsie Pop came in 1931.)\n\nBefore this week, many hasn\u2019t realized Tootsie Rolls was even a standalone company listed on the stock market. Yet indeed it is. Tootsie Roll made its New York Stock Exchange debut in 1922.\n\nFor Gordon, n\u00e9e Rubin in 1932, becoming CEO was not simply a matter of a wife inheriting a company from her husband. On the contrary, Ellen and her family were involved with Tootsie Roll long before she ever met him: The Rubins bought shares in the company the year it went public and by the time Ellen was a tot, they were majority shareholders, with her father eventually becoming president of Sweets Co of America, as the company was known at the time.\n\nEllen and Melvin, who married in 1950, later inherited the company and eventually started running it as equals from the get-go. After her studies, which included a graduate degree from Harvard University, she began working at Tootsie Roll in 1968 in pension planning and product development, showing a knack for the latter. By 1978, she was president and chief operating officer, while her husband, 12 years her senior, was CEO. (When he died 2015 at 95, he was the oldest CEO of any company listed on either the NYSE or Nasdaq.)\n\nAt most companies, her president title would have suggested she was the company\u2019s No. 2. But the couple were equals in running the company. And she was certainly a trailblazer: she was only the second woman president of a NYSE-listed company ever.\n\nTogether, they navigated the eat-or-be-eaten world of confectionary M&A that saw mega deals like Mars buy William Wrigley and Kraft Foods buy Cadbury in the late aughts. Instead, Tootsie Roll, despite its small size and allure as a potential target and determined to stay independent, was an acquirer over the years, buying brands like Junior Mints and DOTS.\n\nUpon her husband\u2019s death, Ellen Gordon became CEO and, according to Chicago newspapers, has continued to run the company, focused on safeguarding what has made Tootsie Rolls dear to many consumers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically the same Tootsie Roll all these years,\u201d she told the Chicago Tribune in 1996. \u201cPeople like to give it to their children, pass on the candy, and the memories that go with it, from one generation to the next.\u201d"}], "George Roll founded Roll Global in 2001.": [{"url": "https://www.glassdoor.ca/Overview/Working-at-Roll-Global-EI_IE2957.11,22.htm", "page_content": "I can't honestly give any pros asides from the fact that I won't have to waste my time working a dead end job.\n\nCons\n\nthere is way to much management within the company...most of the time they make decisions without even knowing what is going on from their colleagues.

Read this interview by Kim Berckentin about what it really takes to elevate yourself and become one of the most outstanding individuals. This is a story about shifting from a local to global trajectory.\n\n\u201cThe Swedes love Volvo, however in Denmark we have a hard time with Maersk. The Swedes are much more sympathetic to the American corporate spirit than we are in Denmark, where the American approach and culture is often met with scepticism\u201d, says Martin Roll.\n\nFor the Danes, the small-is-beautiful culture makes sense. There is a limit to how big it seems wise to be, when the nation only 150 years ago and due to collective self-delusion lost a third of its territory and 40 percent of its citizens. Consequently, risk appetite may very well have a different meaning to the average Dane than to anyone else in the world. Although we daily convince ourselves that we have done away with the \u201cJantelov\u201d (a group behavior \u201claw\u201d that makes Scandinavians negatively portray and criticize individual success and achievement as being unworthy and inappropriate), it has for generations rubbed off on our business environment. There is always a \u201cVarn\u00e6s against a Skjern\u201d, Martin Roll adds, referring to the two main business characters in a popular historical TV drama which provides an excellent insight into the souls of Danish people.\n\nTalking to Martin Roll for just a minute takes you far and wide. He pieces together facts, trends and perspectives at an impressively fast pace that gives food for thought. After all, he is not just anyone. As an international management consultant and C-level advisor, he is used to talking to and socializing with top management teams, boards of Fortune 500 companies and leading companies in Asia that include a number of family-owned businesses. He is among the (very) small group of Danes who is in global demand and is therefore able to collect international top league fees for his lectures, management consulting and business coaching \u2013 a fact one cannot completely avoid thinking about while interviewing him. Fortunately, Martin is one of the most pleasant persons to talk to. He is good company and when he speaks it is with a sense of authority that implies that he is not a man to be interrupted \u2013 you may say he is unstoppable.\n\nAs an expatriate Dane for the last 15 years and a resident of Singapore, Martin has got Denmark at a distance. He has a global mindset owing to his MBA from INSEAD in France \u2013 as well as an excellent English vocabulary that he uses spontaneously and vigorously. His life journey gives him a differently perspective on the world than most Danes \u2013 yet without losing his \u201cDanish-ness\u201d.\n\nOne of the most important parameters that he analyzes when evaluating a new client, is whether there is an emerging \u201carrogance and complacency in the organization\u201d.\n\nIt is the indolence and lack of foresight, which struck companies like Esprit in the 90s, gave Adidas major challenges before they again found their tone and with which Tesco are struggling today. Just when everything is going well, arrogance and complacency may hit the organization, weaken the power of leadership, fade your brand and you may lose the whole market. Then it may quickly go downhill \u2013 a direction that is hard to turn around. This \u201cvictory\u201d disease is one of the things the Danish mindset is sensitive to: Danes smell hubris from afar. So when describing Martin Roll, and why he is successful, his Danish mindset is integral, along with his curiosity and global vision. It was his curiosity about why Asian brands had little success globally, that sent him off on a journey to the East after his graduation from INSEAD in 1999. This was at a time when Samsung was almost non-existent.\n\nMartin settled down in Singapore as a management advisor in 2001 and established the Martin Roll Company. He began working for his clients on the big questions: How to build an Asian brand that can succeed globally? What dogma must be overcome? How do you become \u201cglobal\u201d in the first place, and what management mindset does it take? The answers to these pivotal questions became his trade. Asia in 2001 was characterized by local companies: South Korean Hyundai, Japanese Shiseido and Chinese Huawei. None of them were anywhere near to where these brands are today. Clients across the region were skeptical of Martin\u2019s approach \u2013 but they were curious to meet the tall Dane who had come to talk to them about growth and a global approach to running their businesses. He advised them that the road to global success was to build their own brands and not primarily compete on cost production and low price, something Asia had done that far. By following this path, they could increase the value of their businesses.\n\nMartin had his theoretical ballast and toolbox in order. Actually, he would have liked to become a journalist, but instead he worked his way up in the global advertising industry. At Ted Bates (later Bates), he was given responsibility for the Ericsson Mobile Phones and the Ericsson corporate brand worldwide accounts. He discussed 3G and 4G with them already in the early 90s. In 1995, Martin moved to DDB Needham (later DDB) and for the next four years he was the lead for McDonald\u2019s in Denmark. The American fast food chain expanded during this period from 23 to 140 restaurants and in the process Martin learned everything about commercial strategy the American way. \u201cLearning today, leading tomorrow\u201d was the mantra from the Hamburger Marketing University in Chicago. Martin was given the responsibility to design the strategy that leveraged the tremendous expansion. According to him the four years with DDB Needham was one of the best places he worked. DDB had a unique spirit and culture.\n\nProfessionally, Martin was sent to attend the Young Managers Summer Programme at INSEAD in Fontainebleau in 1998 and he became so fascinated by the international environment and the high level of professionalism that he in 1999 pursued an MBA at the same business school. His time here became a \u201clife changer\u201d as Martin describes it, a crucial point in his career. The towering level of international professionalism and the social aspect of going international opened up new roads and it was clear that his agency life back home in Copenhagen had come to an end. Martin decided to change and moved into deep waters, where he could test himself.\n\nAfter the first years in Singapore, the conclusions from his learning journey were clear and he moved on to materialize his ideas. His first book Asian Brand Strategy was published in 2005. The book was like a recipe \u2013 10 guidelines for Asia\u2019s big challenge in management, strategy, branding and internationalization. After the usual few months of vacuum, while the book found its way out to its audience through the distribution channels, Martin started his marathon. He went on a 15-month long road show, where he delivered hundreds of lectures in Asia, US and Europe. He lectured for a variety of management audiences in 40 countries. Often there were two lectures per day, and on top of that, interviews with all relevant media. This required great stamina.\n\nBack then there was no social media to drive hype. So Martin combined his hard work with hiring an international PR agent in London and New York respectively. And it worked: CNN called him up, so did CNBC, Bloomberg, BBC \u2013 and Martin flew in and gave interviews with them all. Martin found himself in the centre of gravity of a global media campaign, and the book won international recognition. The American marketing professor Kevin Lane Keller from Tuck School of Business, the world\u2019s leading brand expert in academia, wrote: \u201cMartin Roll\u2019s Asian Brand Strategy provides superb motivation and substance into Asian brands and branding. It offers invaluable inspiration and guidance into one of the hottest areas of marketing\u201d.\n\nIn addition to hitting the global bestseller lists, the book was also voted \u201cBest Management Book\u201d in 2006 by the renowned Strategy+Business Magazine, published by PwC Strategy&. Finally, one of the world\u2019s most respected top management advisors, Dominic Barton (worldwide managing director for McKinsey & Company) wrote: \u201cBuilding successful global brands is \u2013 and will be \u2013 critical for the rapidly increasing number of Asian champions on the global stage. Martin Roll provides a compelling and practical road-map on how to do this based on his extensive experience advising Asian corporations\u201d.\n\nThe success of the book provided Martin with the legitimacy to work world-wide. Business owners, wealthy family dynasties, business schools, organizations and governments reached out to Martin to tap into his knowledge, insights and recommendations about expansion strategy and branding. Before he knew it, he gave the main keynote speech at a conference in Seoul where the President of South Korea attended along with 3500 people in the audience.\n\nSo what is it that Martin is capable of? Basically he seeks always to inspire his clients to be the \u201cmost admired\u201d \u2013 they must be in a class by themselves, rather than necessarily being the largest. It involves a number of parameters that are rarely put into use because of the usual short-term, one-sided focus on increased volume. This is where Martin challenges his clients. One of his key questions is: What\u2019s your purpose? He challenges his clients to think about what they deeply believe they are best at, what values they stand for and what they actually provide to their customers \u2013 and more broadly what they provide to the world around them. He helps them with the compass called \u201cpurpose\u201d. If you are driven by a strong purpose, and actually meet expectations all the time, then you have a strong chance to become an \u201cadmired\u201d company. But it is not a position that comes easily. It requires full attention and hard work over a long time period of time and attention to every detail. LEGO\u2019s turnaround is a good example.\n\nIf your company would close down tomorrow, what would happen then? Would the world be any different?\n\nThe Danish company LEGO has got this purpose. Most children and parents would be sad if LEGO closed tomorrow! If that is the case, a company and a brand have all the opportunities at its disposal. Think of Apple, BMW, Estee Lauder, Singapore Airlines and many other brands \u2013 they are strongly positioned in people\u2019s minds. \u201cPowerful brands enable people to do what they could not do otherwise,\u201d as branding expert Peter Fisk has said. Unfortunately, there are many companies that never really reached the goal of their purpose.\n\nOne senses that Martin has an underlying question that could be formulated as: \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Whether it is the customer, company, brand, writer and it is the many possible answers that fascinates and drives him \u2013 that is exactly what he challenges all the times. He stubbornly insists that the ultimate goal has to be the best. Otherwise he refuses to accept the answer! This approach has a clear international, tough appeal to global businesses \u2013 something which is not often the case in Denmark. Martin mentions CEO Lars Rebien S\u00f8rensen as one of those that come very close with his statement that Novo Nordisk MAYBE one day could become the world\u2019s most valuable pharmaceutical company. Bernard Arnault, who is the principal owner, chairman and CEO of the French luxury group LVMH, has built one of the world\u2019s most impressive companies by \u2013 with steely determination \u2013 redefining what luxury stands for now and in the future.\n\nIt also becomes clear that Martin enjoys motivating and inspiring others to bring out the best in them. But not as a traditional coach, more like a top manager of an elite sport. As a close ally, a business coach, which is a well-known concept in global business where being a top-level decision-maker, is very demanding and often a lonely journey. This is where Martin Roll enters and becomes a close ally of his clients, and becomes one of their closest confidants. At the same time he is one of their harshest critics \u2013 with a constructive approach to the role of a business coach. He says that he thrives watching others having success, and that is probably largely due to his own milestones in life \u2013 \u201cbe an architect of your own life\u201d. He is a pronounced ENFP profile for those who are familiar with the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator: Creative, inspiring and with high impact. He uses his skills to help others to develop their untapped potential.\n\nDuring his childhood, he was preoccupied with playing school theater and to be a communicator, but today he no longer has the need to be in the limelight and to take credit for the results. Martin orchestrates in the background the handling of large complex problems and becomes a very trusted sparring partner for global decision makers. He serves the role of the director \u2013 and sometimes also the producer. In his youth he devoted himself to his great passion for photography \u2013 he even lived off it for some years. Martin still today views the world through a photographer\u2019s lens, and is often annoyed when his camera is not within reach. Instinctively, he has always seen things that are about to happen, he says \u2013 and a good photographer presses the shutter a split second before!\n\nIt\u2019s all about daring to press the button before the other; to do so, even if it is wild. Daring to be different, he says.\n\nThe moment the power levers are pushed forward in the cockpit, the aircraft is in take-off mode. While it accelerates on the runway, the aircraft reaches the phase of \u201cvelocity 1\u201d \u2013 the moment when it is no longer possible to stop the aircraft on the runway length that is available. Pilots know that. Only option is to increase speed to \u201cvelocity 2\u201d, where the nose begins to raise from the ground \u2013 now there is no way back, the plane must BE in the air to avoid a disaster. Bringing the plane through these critical phases until it reaches a safe flying altitude and later full cruising altitude, requires high professionalism and lots of power \u2013 the same goes for entrepreneurs and business owners who try to lift their brand. They have to understand that they must make a choice \u2013 will they take off: Yes or no?\n\nOften it is a long haul, even before you are ready to touch the levers. Everything must be in place. The patience for this is not always in place in a country like Denmark. We like solutions to be ready for anything in half the time. But in Asia, they need to see that you have a long term perspective. It fits poorly with the impatient Danish management statement: \u201cWhen I am presented with a three-year plan, I always ask how we can do it in one year\u201d. Execution and efficiency do not always go hand in hand. The linear development that we cherish in the West will not work in Asia. You cannot enforce unnecessarily in Asia. In Chinese, the phenomenon is called \u201cGuanxi\u201d, and in all places in the region, they have a phrase for it: Trust through relationships. This means that a Dane will have to slow down a bit, and wait. When the relationship is developed, the reward will follow \u2013 for nowhere else in the world can things move as fast as in Asia.\n\nThe Chinese handset maker Xiaomi is a good example of this paradigm: They are now the world\u2019s fifth largest mobile brand and move extremely fast \u2013 they came almost out of nowhere. The products are well designed, can only be purchased online, and Xiaomi do not do marketing in the traditional way. In turn, Xiaomi\u2019s brand is driven by viral marketing and social media. It is the linear curve vs. the exponential \u2013 and in Asia you can employ both when it suits you. We must be careful in the West to underestimate the latter \u2013 because time is money.\n\nThe example above from aviation was not picked out of the blue. From his base in Singapore, Martin flies annually over 350,000 miles \u2013 preferably with the top of the class company Singapore Airlines. They are the \u201cmost admirable\u201d. He has a PPS Club Membership (highest membership for a narrow circle of high-flyers) with a permanent seating at the front of the plane by the window. Martin Roll, who has since 2001 helped companies in both Asia and countless other places globally to reach new heights, is by far the closest we get to a genuine Danish superstar in the business guru segment. His success is impressive. Originally, he advised within the domains of branding and marketing only. But today it is much broader general management. The diversity of his clients is impressive and broad: Governments, industry manufacturers, retail chains, airlines, fashion companies, cosmetic brands, and business schools from around the world.\n\nYou only reach Martin\u2019s level by constantly monitoring what is happening around you and with your clients. Slackness is no-go.\n\nWhen HSBC launches a concept like YUMMY, you must know what it is \u2013 and whether it is relevant to your customers when held up against a study that finds that 55% of luxury purchases in China is carried out by men against only 40% worldwide. You must have knowledge to analyze things critically.\n\nMartin\u2019s hallmark is deep knowledge combined with a horizontal view, where you can walk across professional fields and global issues of all kinds. It covers a top class specialization that ties it all together into a powerful strategy. You must have solid knowledge in a broad field so that you can always engage with C-level in the Forbes 500. The bar must constantly be raised. But according to Martin that is not a problem if you have the will to be professional and the desire to be the best. It also makes it easy to imagine his office in Singapore \u2013 a pure research lab from where the whole world is monitored and where he also spends his time reflecting on behalf of his clients on what will happen next in management \u2013 characterized by \u201cNewness occurs in the margins\u201d. His intuition has only become more astute with the years, he says \u2013 and it takes clarity to cut through the clutter. It also reflects on the extremely dynamic job where the toolbox is constantly changing and where one should always be two steps ahead. You are only as good as your last meeting and your last advisory project with a client. And as long as it is fun, he keeps on doing what he is doing. \u201cRemember, I have created the job myself\u201d, he laughs. He knows he is able to contribute. \u201cPut a dent in the universe\u201d as Steve Jobs put it.\n\nMartin Roll is also a Senior Advisor to McKinsey & Company.\n\nThe advice from Martin to young people, who really want a successful career, is to create some platforms, where one has deep knowledge and at the same time a horizontal vision \u2013 the degree of specialization to be established in the early years, and the horizontal visibility will naturally follow when the basics are in place, and the career develops. For Martin, it took a period in his life where he worked seven days a week. Nothing comes from nothing.\n\nToday, his work has three distinct components \u2013 an international keynote speaker, an external adviser to companies, and a facilitator for management meetings, board meetings and family councils. There is a duality in his work, as a lecturer and through books, articles and his own site martinroll.com everything is retrievable \u2013 unlike when he is working as an adviser, when everything is behind double-closed doors. Discretion is paramount and an important part of his global signature. His clients know it and appreciate it \u2013 thus he becomes involved as closely as he does with both owners and management. There can be no doubt about his integrity.\n\nIncreasingly, he is hired by owners of businesses as a mentor for the next generation. He starts by challenging them with the question: What would you like your legacy to be? It is important to understand how these \u201csons and daughters\u201d look at what lies ahead of them. It is Martin\u2019s task to form and shape the heirs, creating a balance between the old and the new. All of this is done with momentum as the overarching theme.\n\nHe believes in creating change and consistency at the same time.\n\nThe day when the transition occurs, the track must be laid well into the future. It is the same combination of knowledge and new ideas, which also needs to lift Denmark forward. If one looks at the big picture, there are definitely skilled, knowledge-intensive companies in Denmark. Novo, Maersk, Danfoss, Grundfos, Ramboll and COWI are examples, which Martin highlights with enthusiasm. But otherwise the Danish business world, with too many small and medium-sized enterprises, needs a more ambitious focus on wanting to be the best. We need crystal clear answers to \u201cwhat\u2019s your purpose?\u201d. Without large enterprises, Danish businesses cannot be present where growth takes place. But small businesses can grow and can become the \u201cmost admired\u201d. It is all about having the right mind-set.\n\nSo we arrive at what Martin does every day \u2013 preparing his clients for growth. Martin\u2019s primary focus areas are innovation and differentiation, which of course require capital. Unfortunately, in Denmark the investments are too little and too late. There are too many companies where time is running out. There is little margin between calculated risk and rashness. The risk acceptance is simply too small in the Danish venture capital environment, and that means that many sustainable ideas do not reach through velocity 2. Business angels in the US would rather distribute 1 billion among 20 start-up companies with the aim of finding the ONE company that \u2013 once calculated \u2013 would have a 100 % probability for success. The mindset is the difference. Finally Danish investors and entrepreneurs may not be skilled enough to convince each other that we could indeed become the best.\n\nMartin is, however, optimistic about the trend he sees globally and in Denmark. In family businesses, the 3rd generations are in several cases replacing the 1st and 2nd generations. They are active in the field with a more globalized approach, and they often have international experience from large international companies and consulting firms like McKinsey & Company.

The roll film was also the basis for the invention of the motion picture film in 1888 by world\u2019s first filmmaker, Louis Le Prince, and a decade later by his followers L\u00e9on Bouly, Thomas Edison, the Lumi\u00e8re Brothers and Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s.\n\nBiography\n\nHe was the third and youngest child of George Washington Eastman and Maria Kilbourn, both from the bordering town of Marshall. His third sister died shortly after her birth. In 1854, his father established the Eastman Commercial College in Rochester. The Eastman family moved to Rochester in 1865. Two years later after his father\u2019s death, George Eastman left high school to support his mother and sisters. At age 14 he began working as an office boy.\n\nIn 1874, Eastman became intrigued with photography, but found the process awkward. It required coating a glass plate with a liquid emulsion, which had to be quickly used before it dried. After three years of experimentation with British gelatin emulsions, Eastman developed a dry photographic plate, and patented it in both England and the US. In 1880 he began a photographic business.\n\nIn 1884, Eastman patented a photographic medium that replaced fragile glass plates with a photo-emulsion coated on paper rolls. The invention of roll film greatly sped up the process of recording multiple images.\n\nAd for the Kodak camera.\n\nEastman then received a patent in 1888 for a camera designed to use roll film. He coined the marketing phrase, \u201cYou press the button, we do the rest.\u201d The phrase entered the public consciousness. It was even incorporated into a Gilbert & Sullivan operetta (Utopia, Limited).\n\nThe camera owner could send in the camera with a processing fee of $10. The company would develop the film, print 100 pictures, and also send along a new roll of 100-exposures film.\n\nOn September 4, 1888 Eastman registered the trademark Kodak. The letter \u201cK\u201d had been a favorite of Eastman\u2019s. He said, \u201c[I]t seems a strong, incisive sort of letter\u201d. Eastman and his mother devised the name Kodak with an anagram set. He used three principal concepts to create the name: it must be short, it could not be mispronounced, and it could not resemble anything else or be associated with anything but Kodak.\n\nBy 1896, 100 Kodak cameras had been sold. The first Kodak cost USD $25. In an effort to bring photography to the masses, Eastman introduced the Brownie in 1900 at a price of just $1. It became a great success.\n\nIn 1925, Eastman gave up his daily management of Kodak, to become chairman of the board. He thereafter concentrated on philanthropic activities, to which he had already donated substantial sums. He was one of the major philanthropists of his time, ranking only slightly behind Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, and a few others, but did not seek publicity for his activities. He concentrated on institution-building and causes which could help people\u2019s health. He donated to the University of Rochester, establishing the Eastman School of Music and School of Dentistry; to Tuskegee Institute; and to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), donations which provided the capital to build several of their first buildings at their second campus along the Charles River.\n\nIn his final two years, Eastman was in intense pain, caused by a degenerative disorder affecting his spine. He had trouble standing and his walking became a slow shuffle. Today it might be diagnosed as spinal stenosis, a narrowing of the spinal canal caused by calcification in the vertebrae. Eastman grew depressed, as he had seen his mother spend the last two years of her life in a wheelchair from the same condition. On March 14, 1932, Eastman committed suicide. He left a suicide note that read, \u201cTo my Friends, My work is done. Why wait?\u201d His funeral was held at St. Paul\u2019s Episcopal Church in Rochester. Eastman, who never married, was buried on the grounds of the company he founded at Kodak Park in Rochester, New York.\n\nLegacy\n\nDuring his lifetime, he donated $100 million, mostly to the University of Rochester and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (under the alias \u201cMr. Smith\u201d). The Rochester Institute of Technology has a building dedicated to Mr. Eastman, in recognition of his support and substantial donations. He endowed the Eastman School of Music of the University of Rochester.\n\nMIT has a plaque of Eastman (the rubbing of which is traditionally considered by students to bring good luck) in recognition of his donation. Eastman also made substantial gifts to the Tuskegee Institute and the Hampton Institute. Upon his drew, his entire estate went to the University of Rochester, where his name can be found on the Eastman Quadrangle of the River Campus. His former home at 900 East Avenue in Rochester, New York was opened as the George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film in 1949. On the 100th anniversary of his birth in 1954, Eastman was honored with a postage stamp from the United States Post Office.\n\nA First Day Cover Honoring George Eastman 1954.\n\nEastman had a very astute business sense. He focused his company on making film when competition heated up in the camera industry. By providing quality and affordable film to every camera manufacturer, Kodak managed to turn its competitors into de facto business partners.\n\nIn 1926 George Eastman was approached by Lord Riddell, the Chairman of Royal Free Hospital, to fund a dental clinic in London. He agreed to give \u00a3200,000 which was matched by \u00a350,000 each from Lord Riddell and Sir Albert Levy, the Royal Free\u2019s honorary treasurer.\n\nThe Eastman Dental Clinic was opened in 20 November 1931 by the American Ambassador in the presence of Neville Chamberlain. The building, which resembled the Rochester Dispensary, was totally integrated into the Royal Free Hospital and included three wards for oral, ear, nose, and throat and cleft lip and palate surgery and was dedicated to providing dental care for children from the poor districts of central London.\n\nSee also\n\n\u2022Eastman Dental Center\n\n\u2022Eastmaninstitutet\n\n\u2022George Eastman House\n\n\u2022Eastman Dental Institute London\n\nReferences\n\n1.^ George Eastman \u2013 The Man: About His Life.

It has since been utilized in Boeing 757s and 747-400s, the latest generation of civil aircraft, and through continued improvements provides 65 percent more thrust than the original engine model introduced in 1972.\n\nBy 1945, the company employed well over 50,000 people, and car production was moved from Derby to Crewe, so that the Derby facilities could work almost exclusively on developing the gas turbine aero engine, particularly for the civil aviation industry.\n\nRolls-Royce began to make deliveries of the Welland engine in 1944, but the aircraft it was intended for, the Gloster Meteor, arrived too late for use during World War II. The Welland was superseded by the more durable Derwent engine.\n\nTwo other engines, the Hawk and the Falcon, had been designed by Royce from his home in the south of France and relayed to his production team in Derby for manufacture. It was named the Eagle and was put into wartime service beginning in 1916 at 250 horsepower in size.\n\nProof that the new Silver Ghost was to be a success came in 1911 when the Indian government ordered eight new models for use by King George V and his entourage during the Delhi Durbar that year.\n\nThe origins of the business of the company go back to Henry Royce and CS Rolls, the compatibility of whose business interests led to the formation of the original Rolls-Royce Limited in 1906.\n\nZippia gives an in-depth look into the details of Rolls-Royce, including salaries, political affiliations, employee data, and more, in order to inform job seekers about Rolls-Royce.

In order to qualify to be inducted, a period of at least 25 years must have passed before consideration by a committee that consists of rock music historians. This committee then takes their picks to be nominated, with the final group of prospective inductees voted on by another body of around 500 rock authorities from around the globe. Finally, the five to seven artists with the highest number of votes are chosen to be included in that year's round of Hall of Fame inductees.\n\nThe induction ceremony may only take place over the course of one night, but the featured artists are immortalized in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Museum (or Rock Hall) located in Cleveland, Ohio. The museum's vast collection features a variety of exhibits and galleries that take visitors on a trip through rock 'n' roll history. Items on display include instruments and gear used by rock's biggest stars, posters, never-before-seen photographs, stage equipment, and so much more.
