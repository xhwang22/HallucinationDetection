He had extensive stage experience (including some 27 appearances on Broadway) and, by the time he was signed by Fox in 1931, he had worked not only as an actor but as a stage manager and writer. On screen he appeared for the most part in \"B\" pictures, notable exceptions being the MGM musical blockbuster Born to Dance (1936) and the 20th Century-Fox classic family drama Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938). Dinehart specialized in portraying blustering or shifty businessmen, crooked politicians or racketeers. While he is usually described as a supporting player, he actually started out in the early 1930s playing leading roles opposite some of the major female stars of the period.\n\nHowever, Dinehart's characters were rarely sympathetic. In Street of Women (1932) he essayed an architect who, bored with his society wife, indiscreetly keeps a mistress (Kay Francis) on the side. In Supernatural (1933) he was true to form as the phony spiritualist fleecing a wealthy socialite, played by Carole Lombard; and in Jimmy the Gent (1934) he was an urbane con artist in competition with James Cagney. On rarer occasions Alan found gainful employment as more benevolent characters, point in case his theatrical impressario Theodore von Eltz in Dance, Girl, Dance (1933). All of these performances attracted good reviews from Mordaunt Hall of the New York Times, ranging from \"excellent\" to \"bearing up valiantly\".\n\nIn unlikely contrast to his self-styled image of \"Hollywood's most versatile villain\", Dinehart had strong comedic inclinations, co-authoring several comedy plays towards the later stages of his career. The last and most successful of these, \"Separate Rooms\" (1940-1941), with Dinehart top-billed alongside Glenda Farrell and Lyle Talbot, became one of the longest-running non-musical plays on Broadway at the time, finally closing after 613 performances.

The multiple-reel film\u2014which came to be called a \u201cfeature,\u201d in the vaudevillian sense of a headline attraction\u2014achieved general acceptance with the smashing success of the three-and-one-half-reel Les Amours de la reine \u00c9lisabeth (Queen Elizabeth, 1912), which starred Sarah Bernhardt and was imported by Zukor (who founded the independent Famous Players production company with its profits). In 1912 Enrico Guazzoni\u2019s nine-reel Italian superspectacle Quo Vadis? (\u201cWhither Are You Going?\u201d) was road-shown in legitimate theatres across the country at a top admission price of one dollar, and the feature craze was on.\n\n(Read Lillian Gish\u2019s 1929 Britannica essay on silent film.)\n\nAt first there were difficulties in distributing features, because the exchanges associated with both the MPPC and the independents were geared toward cheaply made one-reel shorts. Because of their more elaborate production values, features had relatively higher negative costs. This was a disadvantage to distributors, who charged a uniform price per foot. By 1914, however, several national feature-distribution alliances that correlated pricing with a film\u2019s negative cost and box-office receipts were organized. These new exchanges demonstrated the economic advantage of multiple-reel films over shorts. Exhibitors quickly learned that features could command higher admission prices and longer runs; single-title packages were also cheaper and easier to advertise than programs of multiple titles. As for manufacturing, producers found that the higher expenditure for features was readily amortized by high volume sales to distributors, who in turn were eager to share in the higher admission returns from the theatres. The whole industry soon reorganized itself around the economics of the multiple-reel film, and the effects of this restructuring did much to give movies their characteristic modern form.\n\nFeature films made motion pictures respectable for the middle class by providing a format that was analogous to that of the legitimate theatre and was suitable for the adaptation of middle-class novels and plays. This new audience had more demanding standards than the older working-class one, and producers readily increased their budgets to provide high technical quality and elaborate productions. The new viewers also had a more refined sense of comfort, which exhibitors quickly accommodated by replacing their storefronts with large, elegantly appointed new theatres in the major urban centres (one of the first was Mitchell L. Marks\u2019s 3,300-seat Strand, which opened in the Broadway district of Manhattan in 1914). Known as \u201cdream palaces\u201d because of the fantastic luxuriance of their interiors, these houses had to show features rather than a program of shorts to attract large audiences at premium prices. By 1916 there were more than 21,000 movie theatres in the United States. Their advent marked the end of the nickelodeon era and foretold the rise of the Hollywood studio system, which dominated urban exhibition from the 1920s to the \u201950s. Before the new studio-based monopoly could be established, however, the patents-based monopoly of the MPPC had to expire, and this it did about 1914 as a result of its own basic assumptions.\n\nMore From Britannica tap dance: Film\n\nAs conceived by Edison, the basic operating principle of the Trust was to control the industry through patents pooling and licensing, an idea logical enough in theory but difficult to practice in the context of a dynamically changing marketplace. Specifically, the Trust\u2019s failure to anticipate the independents\u2019 widespread and aggressive resistance to its policies cost it a fortune in patent-infringement litigation. Furthermore, the Trust badly underestimated the importance of the feature film, permitting the independents to claim this popular new product as entirely their own. Another issue that the MPPC misjudged was the power of the marketing strategy known as the \u201cstar system.\u201d Borrowed from the theatre industry, this system involves the creation and management of publicity about key performers, or stars, to stimulate demand for their films. Trust company producers used this kind of publicity after 1910, when Carl Laemmle of Independent Motion Pictures (IMP) promoted Florence Lawrence into national stardom through a series of media stunts in St. Louis, Missouri, but they never exploited the technique as forcefully or as imaginatively as the independents did. Finally, and most decisively, in August 1912 the U.S. Justice Department brought suit against the MPPC for \u201crestraint of trade\u201d in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Delayed by countersuits and by World War I, the government\u2019s case was eventually won, and the MPPC formally dissolved in 1918, although it had been functionally inoperative since 1914.\n\nThe rise and fall of the MPPC was concurrent with the industry\u2019s move to southern California. As a result of the nickelodeon boom, some exhibitors\u2014who showed three separate programs over a seven-day period\u2014had begun to require as many as 20 new films per week, and it became necessary to put production on a systematic year-round schedule. Because most films were still shot outdoors in available light, such schedules could not be maintained in the vicinity of New York City or Chicago, where the industry had originally located itself in order to take advantage of trained theatrical labour pools. As early as 1907, production companies, such as Selig Polyscope, began to dispatch production units to warmer climates during winter. It was soon clear that what producers required was a new industrial centre\u2014one with warm weather, a temperate climate, a variety of scenery, and other qualities (such as access to acting talent) essential to their highly unconventional form of manufacturing.\n\nVarious companies experimented with location shooting in Jacksonville, Florida, in San Antonio, Texas, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and even in Cuba, but the ultimate site of the American film industry was a Los Angeles suburb (originally a small industrial town) called Hollywood. It is generally thought that Hollywood\u2019s distance from the MPPC\u2019s headquarters in New York City made it attractive to the independents, but MPPC members such as Selig, Kalem, Biograph, and Essanay had also established facilities there by 1911 in response to a number of the region\u2019s attractions. These included the temperate climate required for year-round production (the U.S. Weather Bureau estimated that an average of 320 days per year were sunny or clear); a wide range of topography within a 50-mile (80-km) radius of Hollywood, including mountains, valleys, forests, lakes, islands, seacoast, and desert; the status of Los Angeles as a professional theatrical centre; the existence of a low tax base; and the presence of cheap and plentiful labour and land. This latter factor enabled the newly arrived production companies to buy up tens of thousands of acres of prime real estate on which to locate their studios, standing sets, and backlots.\n\nBy 1915 approximately 15,000 workers were employed by the motion-picture industry in Hollywood, and more than 60 percent of American production was centred there. In that same year the trade journal Variety reported that capital investment in American motion pictures\u2014the business of artisanal craftsmen and fairground operators only a decade before\u2014had exceeded $500 million. The most powerful companies in the new film capital were the independents, who were flush with cash from their conversion to feature production. These included the Famous Players\u2013Lasky Corporation (later Paramount Pictures, c. 1927), which was formed by a merger of Zukor\u2019s Famous Players Company, Jesse L. Lasky\u2019s Feature Play Company, and the Paramount distribution exchange in 1916; Universal Pictures, founded by Carl Laemmle in 1912 by merging IMP with Powers, Rex, Nestor, Champion, and Bison; Goldwyn Picture Corporation, founded in 1916 by Samuel Goldfish (later Goldwyn) and Edgar Selwyn; Metro Picture Corporation and Louis B. Mayer Pictures, founded by Louis B. Mayer in 1915 and 1917, respectively; and the Fox Film Corporation (later Twentieth Century\u2013Fox, 1935), founded by William Fox in 1915. After World War I these companies were joined by Loew\u2019s, Inc. (parent corporation of MGM, created by the merger of Metro, Goldwyn, and Mayer companies cited above, 1924), a national exhibition chain organized by Marcus Loew and Nicholas Schenck in 1919; First National Pictures, Inc., a circuit of independent exhibitors who established their own production facilities in Burbank, California, in 1922; Warner Brothers Pictures, Inc., founded by Harry, Albert, Samuel, and Jack Warner in 1923; and Columbia Pictures, Inc., incorporated in 1924 by Harry and Jack Cohn and Joe Brandt.\n\nThese organizations became the backbone of the Hollywood studio system, and the men who controlled them shared several important traits. They were all independent exhibitors and distributors who had outwitted the Trust and earned their success by manipulating finances in the postnickelodeon feature boom, merging production companies, organizing national distribution networks, and ultimately acquiring vast theatre chains. They saw their business as basically a retailing operation modeled on the practice of chain stores such as Woolworth\u2019s and Sears. Not incidentally, these men were all first- or second-generation Jewish immigrants from eastern Europe, most of them with little formal education, while the audience they served was 90 percent Protestant and Catholic. This circumstance would become an issue during the 1920s, when the movies became a mass medium that was part of the life of every U.S. citizen and when Hollywood became the chief purveyor of American culture to the world."}, {"url": "https://whatnerd.com/cinema-silent-era-explained-must-watch-silent-films/", "page_content": "Who remembers the silent era of film? Nobody, pretty much. The silent age has, obviously, passed beyond living memory for the most part.\n\nSure, there have been a few motion pictures since the invention of \"talkies\" that have used the silent technique, such as 2011's Academy Award-winning film The Artist. But practically speaking, silent films are history\u2014\"too artistic\" for modern box office viewers.\n\nHave you ever wondered what the silent movie era was actually like? Are there any masterpiece silent films that would still be considered great if they came out today? Well, you'd be surprised how many silent films are still considered among the industry's most beloved classics.\n\nFrom Charlie Chaplin to Fritz Lang, let's revisit the beginning years of cinema and the silent films of the era that still hold up today.\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Silent Film Era\n\nThe silent film era began in 1906 with Charles Tait directing The Story of the Kelly Gang in Australia. As the first-ever feature-length movie, The Story of the Kelly Gang was received well and succeeded financially.\n\nBut it wasn't until 1915 that so-called \"movies\" began to catch on as a mainstream artform. That's when D.W. Griffith made The Birth of a Nation, after which the American film industry was truly born.\n\nGriffith had proven the viability of feature-length movies in America. From then on, film studios operated on a new level and were willing to hire filmmakers to create their visions as feature-length narratives.\n\nThe following 15 years saw the rise of Hollywood's most memorable stars, with Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Greta Garbo all launching their careers during the silent film era. Unfortunately, many silent film stars couldn't translate their star power to \"talkies\" come the 1930s.\n\nAnd by the mid-1930s, the silent film era was done. Audiences had moved on to movies with audible dialogue, marking a landmark shift in filmmaking technology that forever changed the landscape of cinema.\n\nWhich is a shame, because silent movies still have much to offer. They're more than just pretentious works of art for snobby cinephiles to gawk over. Indeed, the silent film era gave us some of the finest movies ever produced, many of which are worth watching today.\n\nKeep reading for our picks of the best classic silent movies that are worthy of their reputation and still hold up today.\n\nCharlie Chaplin's last appearance as The Tramp is his finest effort, if you ask me. By 1936, talkies had been around for nearly a decade and silent films had been all but pushed out of the industry\u2014but Chaplin continued producing them, ignoring talkies all the way to the early 1940s.\n\nAnd we're glad he did! Modern Times is a harsh warning of modernization and mechanization to those who work in factories everywhere.\n\nIn this final tale of his iconic character, The Tramp finds Ellen and they fall madly in love with one another. But as the pair try to make their way in life, they're constantly being arrested.\n\nEver the optimist, Charlie Chaplin's The Tramp delivers an ending that feels hopeful in a world that's often bereft of it.\n\nModern Times has the Chaplin brand of humor in spades, as well as the heart that Chaplin skillfully weaves throughout his comedies. That's why the film endures and remains relevant to this day.\n\nOnce described as having \"the most beautiful final shot ever put to celluloid,\" City Lights was Charlie Chaplin's favorite film amongst the many films he made throughout his career.\n\nThe story follows his iconic character of The Tramp and his attempts to raise money to pay for a blind girl's operation so she can see.\n\nAs The Tramp makes his way through the film\u2014hilarious mishaps in tow\u2014the character becomes a figure for more than comedy. He's not interested in anybody else. He only wants to help her, which imbues a kind of depth that potently projects itself across the screen.\n\nYet even viewing it today, the comedy remains wonderfully engaging. And that acclaimed final scene? It still draws tears from the eyes.\n\nThe original dystopian sci-fi movie, Metropolis wasn't a hit upon release in 1927. Instead, it was an early example of a slow-burn movie\u2014one that, upon repeat viewings, became a cinematic titan.\n\nFritz Lang's film showcased storytelling on a huge scale, with the picture focusing on the rise of an underappreciated and undervalued workforce that was helped by Freder, the son of the master of Metropolis.\n\nRelated: Why Are Sci-Fi Movies So Popular in Modern Cinema? 5 Reasons\n\nThe picture's narrative encompasses the sheer scale of the massive fictional city and delivers a chilling warning on social class divide.\n\nToday, Metropolis still exudes an Orwellian attraction. The heroic actions of a few stand between a cold and uncaring world and the caring nature of the human species, keeping the film relevant almost a century later.\n\nTelling the real-life story of the Russian warship and the mutiny of its crew against the officers aboard, the 1925 film Battleship Potemkin is often ranked as one of the greatest movies ever made.\n\nSergei Eisenstein's direction remains a forward-thinking and edgy example of filmmaking in the silent era. He brilliantly showcases the conditions endured by the sailors aboard the ship, which led to the famous mutiny (and arguably the revolution itself).\n\nBattleship Potemkin is a highly influential film that inspired several of cinema's great filmmakers, and also served as an early example of how to make propaganda films in line with the government's agenda.\n\nNevertheless, Battleship Potemkin is a cinematic flagpole, if for no reason than it being one of the earliest epic films. The 75-minute runtime makes it highly approachable for any first-time silent film viewer.\n\nRead next: The 25 Best Classic Old Movies Everyone Should See, Ranked"}, {"url": "https://discoveringchaplin.com/who-were-the-famous-directors-of-the-silent-movie-era/", "page_content": "The silent movie era was an interesting and important period in the film industry, as it is through the limited features and resources of silent movies that we see the potential of adding sounds and color into them, thus motivating many directors, producers, and film-making companies to improve upon the technology to bring us the movies that we watch today. SO, without silent films, there wouldn\u2019t be any movies, theatres, and even Hollywood in today\u2019s era.\n\nThere have been hundreds of different directors that wanted to try creating a movie during the silent movie era, but only a few became successful. Here are some of the famous directors in the period of silent films.\n\nAlice Guy\n\nMany silent film enthusiasts probably know Alice Ida Antoinette Guy-Blach\u00e9, better known as Alice Guy, as she was not only the first female director but also one of the pioneers of silent movies. It is even speculated that between 1896 and 1906, she was the only women that directs movies. Born on July 1, 1873 in France, Alice Guy first worked as a stenography-typist in 1894 while also serving as a secretary for businessman Felix-Max Richard. The businessman\u2019s company was then sold to Leon Gaumont and three other men, and they would then become one of the pioneers of the motion-picture industry in France after producing many films.\n\nThrough the company, Alice Guy was able to direct her first film titled \u201cLa F\u00e9e aux Choux (The Cabbage Fairy)\u201d in 1896. Guy would later direct dozens of films, with her last movie being Tarnished Reputations in 1920, which is co-direct with her husband Herbert Blach\u00e9 and another filmmaker named L\u00e9once Perret.\n\nCecil B. Demille\n\nIt is a known fact that Hollywood wouldn\u2019t be the same if it weren\u2019t for Cecil B. Demille, a director and producer that is considered by many to be the founding father of American cinema due to how he brought the United States\u2019 film industry in the spotlight. Born on August 12, 1991 in the state of Massachusetts, Cecil B. Demille began his career as a stage actor in the early 1900s, but later moved to directing and writing stage productions until 1912. By 1913, he lost interest in theater and began working as a director under the Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company, with his first film being The Squaw Man, which was released in 1914.\n\nDemille would then direct some of the most commercial successful films in Hollywood, like The Ten Commandments (1923) and The King of Kings (1927). The success of his films in mainly attributed to his uses of complex narratives that are not seen yet in many silent films during his time, and it could be said that he inspired other silent film directors to also do the same style of writing and directing.\n\nKing Vidor\n\nKing Vidor is another iconic American director that became one of the few successful filmmakers in Hollywood during the silent movie era. As opposed to Demille\u2019s epic narratives, King Vidor\u2019s style of writing his films involve social issues that are more relatable to the working class people of the United States during the 1920s up to the 1950s. However, Vidor also explored other genres and themes in making his film, thus allowing him to be one of the most versatile directors in the era.\n\nFurthermore, he is also describe by many to be an \u201cactor\u2019s director,\u201d as he would often allow his actors to perform to the best of their abilities without any restrictions. Interestingly, many of the actors that he directed were nominated and won during the Academy Awards, and these actors include Anne Shirley, Jennifer Jones, Lilian Gish, and Wallace Beery.\n\nErnst Lubitsch\n\nErnst Lubitsch is a German-born American director and producer that became successful in the industry because of \u201cthe Lubitsch touch,\u201d a style of filmmaking that the director applies that is unique to him. Most of the films that he directs have a touch of the literary genre called \u201ccomedy of manners,\u201d wherein social issues would often be presented as a satire. Lubitsch was born on January 29, 1982 in Berlin, Germany, where he was trained by his father to be a tailor. He would soon leave the tailoring business and start his career in the theater in the 1910s.\n\nAfter his stint in theater, he would then star in various movies, including The Ideal Wife (1913) and his last movie appearance as an actor in Sumurun (1920). From then on he would begin to write and direct several successful movies like Trouble in Paradise (1932), To Be or Not to Be (1942), and Heaven Can Wait (1943).\n\nCharlie Chaplin\n\nAlthough most people know Charlie Chaplin as the best actor of the silent film era, he is actually considered to also be one of the best directors of that period. In fact, Chaplin directed most of the famous movies that he starred in, such as The Kid (1921), The Gold Rush (1925), City Lights (1931), The Great Dictator (1940), and Limelight (1952). Born on April 16, 1889 in London, England, Charlie Chaplin started at the bottom when his family lived in poverty. Through hard work and determination, Chaplin was able to be given jobs in acting at the age of 19, and his career as an actor further flourish when he went to America. You might want to catch a couple of his movies on a rainy day.\n\nDuring his career in the film industry he was nominated for several Academy Awards , although he was never nominated for his role as a director in some of his movies. Most people describe Chaplin\u2019s directing style as \u201cunderrated\u201d since it has never been shown in the spotlight as much as his acting career. His unpopular directorial roles may have been attributed to his simplistic style that has been abundant in many silent films during his era, which didn\u2019t allow his films to shine or stand out among the rest. However, his contributions to the film industry as a director have been celebrated in recent years thanks to many documentaries and books directed and written for him that showcased his talent in writing and directing."}, {"url": "https://entertainism.com/brief-history-of-silent-movies", "page_content": "They say speech is silver, but silence, gold. In accordance, many regard the era of silent films as a time when some of the masterpieces of the movie industry were crafted and presented to audiences. Given here is a brief history of the era of silent movies.\n\nImagining a mute movie in today\u2019s times would probably freak the daylights out of your mind! For many years, this popular medium of entertainment \u2013 cinema, movies, or films \u2013 did not have a voice. It is called the silent era of movies.\n\nMovie-makers back then had to heavily and largely depend on all other aspects of movie-making, since the technology to combine visuals with sound had not yet developed. It was only a matter of time before this technology did develop, but meanwhile, cinema witnessed the birth of many legends, who crafted many masterpieces that were appreciated and viewed over and over again, even as the \u2018talkies\u2019 arrived.\n\nThe Journey of Silent Cinema\n\nFirst Motion Picture Documentation\n\nThe history of silent movies begins with the history of cinema itself; as all movies made in those times did not have sound. Eadweard Muybridge\u2019s Sallie Gardner at a Gallop was the first silent film ever to be made. It documented equine motion and was released in 1878. The film consisted of a series of 24 photographs that were projected on the Zoopraxiscope (considered the first movie projector) in succession at high speeds to create the illusion of motion. Muybridge\u2019s Zoopraxiscope was the inspiration behind the Kinetoscope, which was meant for individual viewing. It used the same basic technique of relaying successive photographs to create the illusion of motion. However, in spite of being a \u2018motion\u2019-picture, Sallie Gardner at a Gallop cannot be really called a \u2018film\u2019, as it was merely a relay of successive photographs that created the \u2018illusion\u2019 of motion.\n\nFirst Narrative Film\n\nThe first narrative film ever, Roundhay Garden Scene was made by Louis Aim\u00e9 Augustin Le Prince. It was released on 14 October 1888, and was only 2 seconds long! Louis Le Prince is considered the true father of motion picture. Motion pictures matured into full-length feature films in the 1920s, but still lacked sound. It is this short period of a few decades that is referred to as the era of silent cinema.\n\nThe Cast and the Crew\n\nSilent movies were at their peak by the 1920s \u2013 the decade saw the birth of many a legend and many a masterpiece. By the 1920s, people had mastered the art of speaking volumes without saying a word. In fact, so adept was the film fraternity with the concept of silent films, that for quite a few years after the \u2018talkies\u2019 arrived, movies failed to create the impact they did in the silent era, for directors and actors alike could not deal with all the sound!\n\nActing\n\nCharlie Chaplin, one of the geniuses of the silent era, very correctly once said that \u201cCinema is pantomimic art\u201d. No sound meant no dialogs, so your body language and facial expressions had to do all the talking. Many actors hence adopted hyperbole in their acting. You may notice many actors exaggerate their actions in silent films \u2013 you fall, it has to be dramatic; you are sad, you have to be melodramatic; you are falling in love, you have to bat your eye-lashes and blush! Exaggeration worked especially well for comedies. Exaggerating grief is something that can very quickly and easily go wrong. But they all managed to do it beautifully; and that is sheer brilliance.\n\nMusic\n\nThe importance of music in creating a mood was already known \u2013 music was effectively used to the same purpose in plays and dramas. In the very beginning, music was only used to entertain the audiences before the actual movie began, and during the intertitles. Later, movies came to be accompanied with live music performances that coordinated with the scene. Theater organs were used to create special sound effects too. However, most of the movies adapted theater music and improvised on it. The first ever movie to have an original music score was D.W. Griffith\u2019s 1915 epic The Birth of a Nation(composed by Joseph Carl Breil). As silent movies reached their highest peaks of success, the popularity of plays and dramas slowly waned.\n\nDirection\n\nDirectors of the silent era never shied away from experimenting, for movies were still new to everyone. While most directors insisted on their actors being theatrical, melodramatic and flamboyant, a few allowed the actors to identify their own acting styles, and act naturally and candidly. Many movie-makers considered this style as rather mellow and subtle. With barely any sound and no dialogs, direction was hence a big challenge, which talented, daring directors took up bravely, and did justice to it.\n\nDialogs\n\nWhen the requirement of saying something was unavoidable, movies made use of something called intertitles. Intertitles were text plates interspersed between the visuals. They helped carry the story from one point in the plot to another. Intertitles themselves went through various stages, from simple text intertitles to elaborate ones, sometimes even carrying an illustration of one or more of the movie characters. Writing intertitles became a profession, and soon people apart from the screenplay writers (or scenario writers, as they were called back then) came to be hired to write intertitles for movies! Intertitles evolved too, like all other aspects of silent movies, to become a special feature of the films.\n\nTechnology\n\nThe technology which was used to make movies in the silent era \u2013 and hence the norms that governed movie-making \u2013 are completely different from those which exist now. But even thinking of showing a small boy flying on a broomstick or a man dreaming would have seemed blasphemous in the silent era! And yet it was achieved brilliantly by G.A. Smith as early as in the year 1898, using a technique called double exposure. Other techniques like stop motion were also used to add to the movie-watching experience. Film continuity, slow motion, animation \u2013 some of the techniques that have become the basics of movie-making now, were all developed in the silent era of cinema.\n\nMost Celebrated Legends of the Silent Era\n\nSome of the initial movies were written, directed, and produced by a single person. Even after various divisions were established, some ambitious movie-makers continued to make \u2018all-me\u2019 films, where they worked on more than just one aspect of movie-making. Below is an account of some of the most celebrated legends of the silent cinema.\n\nD.W. Griffith\n\nThe man who directed the epic The Birth of a Nation (1915), D.W. Griffith is regarded by film historians as one of the greatest American film directors ever, although he arrived in New York with the dreams of becoming a successful playwright. He made his debut in the film industry as an actor in Edward Porter\u2019s Rescued from an Eagle\u2019s Nest. With The Birth of a Nation, Griffith raised the bar of movies to another level. The movie set many a record, becoming the highest grossing film in history, and the first American feature film. Griffith is also celebrated for his other films \u2013 Lady Helen\u2019s Escapade, Intolerance: Love\u2019s Struggle Throughout the Ages, and Broken Blossoms; all of which have been preserved by the United States National Film Registry.\n\nRoscoe \u201cFatty\u201d Arbuckle\n\nRoscoe \u201cFatty\u201d Arbuckle was an actor, director and screenwriter. But he is widely and most significantly acknowledged for his comic genius. Arbuckle\u2019s is a life full of controversies. When he was born, his father named him after a politician he despised, because he did not believe Roscoe was his child. From childhood, Roscoe had a very melodious voice. He was soon pulled into vaudeville for his singing talent. Arbuckle\u2019s acting debut was Ben\u2019s Kid. He popularized the clich\u00e9 gag \u2018pie in the face\u2019 that went on to be adapted into several comedies of the silent era. But more than anything else, I think we are all indebted to Arbuckle for having mentored Charlie Chaplin (it is believed \u2018The Tramp\u2019 was adapted from Arbuckle\u2019s dressing style) and discovered Buster Keaton; two very famous personalities of the silent era.\n\nCharlie Chaplin\n\nCharlie Chaplin is one of the most sensitive comedians to have ever existed. You watch a Chaplin movie, and you laugh \u2013 but look into the eyes of the actor, and you cannot help shedding a tear. Chaplin\u2019s early life had him face tough times and go through hardships unimaginable of a small boy. It must have, however, paved the way for his film-technique \u2013 for Chaplin\u2019s humor is one that begins with laughter but leaves you ashamed of yourself and what the world around is turning into. Chaplin had the power to make you introspect, after giving you a good laugh \u2013 almost as if he were challenging you. Chaplin\u2019s films came to define and dominate the silent era, especially in the 1920s. Two of his films \u2013 The Gold Rush and The Circus, went on to become top-grossing silent films in the United States.\n\nBuster Keaton\n\nIf Charlie Chaplin epitomizes pantomime, Buster Keaton is \u2018The Great Stone Face\u2019 (as he was nicknamed). Keaton\u2019s comic appeal came from the way his characters in different films were always unfazed by the events occurring around them. Keaton\u2019s debut in The Butcher Boy was first in the legacy of films of the duo that Arbuckle and Keaton made. Keaton went on to become Arbuckle\u2019s gag-man, second-director, and best friend for life, who was to stand by Arbuckle through all his highs and lows. Such was the acting and directorial genius of the man, that he has been ranked as the 7th greatest director of all times (Entertainment Weekly) and 21st greatest male star of all times (American Film Institute). He and Arbuckle together as a pair have given the film industry some of the best comedy films.\n\nSergei Eisenstein\n\nOne cannot talk of silent cinema and not mention Eisenstein, a director and a film theorist. Eisenstein traveled a lot throughout his life. As a young boy, Sergei took up architecture and engineering, his father\u2019s profession. Eisenstein\u2019s introduction to the arts came with the study of the Japanese language, when he learned about the Kabuki theater. Eisenstein is best known for his silent film Battleship Potemkin. One who has seen this film cannot help but remember and shudder at the aesthetic beauty in which the Odessa Steps scene was shot. Though not entirely factual, the incident was added in the film to emphasize on the cruelties of the Imperial regime. Alexander Nevsky, one of Eisenstein\u2019s talkies, won him the Order Of Lenin.\n\nMaking Way For The Talkies\n\nThe first ever talking movie was The Jazz Singer, which was released in 1927. However, attempts to construct a device that could combine visuals and sound had been made many years prior to the release of this movie. Thomas Edison\u2019s Kinetophone was probably the earliest of movie projectors to combine sound and visuals. Even after the release of the first talky, silent films continued to reign the cinema world for quite a few years. The early attempts of the film fraternity to adapt to \u2018talking movies\u2019 were clumsy, and for a brief period, the quality of work produced reduced significantly. But even as talkies gained popularity, many a director, producer and film-maker continued to make silent movies, some with the specific intention of making a film that would celebrate the art of silent cinema, and some to pay a tribute to an era gone by. Murnau\u2019s City Girl (1930), and Chaplin\u2019s Modern Times(1931), are few such examples.\n\nThe names of many more maestros are associated with the silent era; like the German film director and expressionist F.W. Murnau, or Fritz Lang, who gave us the earliest science fiction film Metropolis, which was also the most expensive silent film ever made. Some film personalities even began their careers in the silent era and continued to work through the talkies till as late as the 1980s, like the silent era actress Lilian Gish, who had one of the longest careers, a complete 75 years!\n\nBeginning at personal experiments ending in a two-second clip, the U.S. movie industry has grown into a gigantic force providing employment to more than 2 million people, and contributing grossly $180 billion each year to the U.S. economy. We indeed have a lot to owe to personalities of the silent film era, for they developed in us a taste to see motion on a screen, even though it was without sound. The art of silent movies will be celebrated by generations to come."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/victor-mclaglen", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nVictor McLaglen (Victor Andrew de Bier Everleigh McLaglen) was born on 10 December, 1886 in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England, UK, is an Actor, Soundtrack.

On screen, the title is Napol\u00e9on vu par Abel Gance, meaning \"Napoleon as seen by Abel Gance\". The film is recognised as a masterwork of fluid camera motion, produced in a time when most camera shots were static. Many innovative techniques were used to make the film, including fast cutting, extensive close-ups, a wide variety of hand-held camera shots, location shooting, point of view shots, multiple-camera setups, multiple exposure, superimposition, underwater camera, kaleidoscopic images, film tinting, split screen and mosaic shots, multi-screen projection, and other visual effects. A revival of Napol\u00e9on in the mid-1950s influenced the filmmakers of the French New Wave.\n\n\n\nThe film begins in Brienne-le-Ch\u00e2teau with youthful Napoleon attending military school where he manages a snowball fight like a military campaign, yet he suffers the insults of other boys. It continues a decade later with scenes of the French Revolution and Napoleon's presence at the periphery as a young army lieutenant. He returns to visit his family home in Corsica but politics shift against him and put him in mortal danger. He flees, taking his family to France. Serving as an officer of artillery in the Siege of Toulon, Napoleon's genius for leadership is rewarded with a promotion to brigadier general. Jealous revolutionaries imprison Napoleon but then the political tide turns against the Revolution's own leaders. Napoleon leaves prison, forming plans to invade Italy. He falls in love with the beautiful Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais. The emergency government charges him with the task of protecting the National Assembly. Succeeding in this he is promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the Interior, and he marries Jos\u00e9phine. He takes control of the army which protects the French\u2013Italian border, and propels it to victory in an invasion of Italy.\n\n\n\nGance planned for Napol\u00e9on to be the first of six movies about Napoleon's career, a chronology of great triumph and defeat ending in Napoleon's death in exile on the island of Saint Helena. After the difficulties encountered in making the first film, Gance realised that the costs involved would make the full project impossible.\n\n\n\nThe film was first released in a gala at the Palais Garnier (then the home of the Paris Opera) on 7 April 1927. Napol\u00e9on had been screened in only eight European cities when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer bought the rights to it, but after screening it in London, it was cut drastically in length, and only the central panel of the three-screen Polyvision sequences were retained before it was put on limited release in the US. There, the silent masterpiece was indifferently received at a time when talkies were just starting to appear. The film was restored in 1981 after twenty years' work by silent film historian Kevin Brownlow."}, {"url": "https://www.insider.com/heartthrobs-hollywood-golden-age-2018-12", "page_content": "Hollywood's golden age took place from the end of the silent film era to the early 1960s, and was a high point for the film industry.\n\nThe era was also rife with heartthrobs, many of whom drew huge box office numbers for their respective studios.\n\nFrom Marlon Brando to Marilyn Monroe to Paul Newman, movie lovers in the early and mid 20th century had a lot to look forward to.\n\nVisit Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nTop editors give you the stories you want \u2014 delivered right to your inbox each weekday.

Though many Justin Bieber and One Direction fans may think their crushes are the first in existence, crush-worthy famous people are a phenomenon that dates back to Hollywood's golden age.\n\nSilent film star Rudolph Valentino, for example, is considered by some to be one of Hollywood's first heartthrobs.\n\nFrom Cary Grant to Sophia Loren to Doris Day, here are 27 swoon-worthy stars from Hollywood's golden years."}, {"url": "https://pophistorydig.com/topics/silent-to-sound-film-era-1920s/", "page_content": "\n\nSilent screen star Norma Talmadge, shown on the December 1929 cover of Photoplay magazine, became something less of a star after the onset of sound & the \u201ctalkies.\u201d Click for 'The Talmadge Girls' book.\n\nNorma Talmadge, a Hollywood star of the silent film era, is shown at right on the December 1929 cover of Photoplay magazine.\n\nPhotoplay was founded in Chicago in 1911 and reached its zenith in the 1920s and 1930s, becoming quite influential in the early film industry. The magazine was renowned for its beautiful cover portraits of film stars by artists such as Rolf Armstrong, Earl Christy, and Charles Sheldon. By 1937, however, with the advancement of color photography, the magazine began using photographs of the stars.\n\nTalmadge, shown here in an Earl Christy rendering, was one of a number of Hollywood stars whose careers were dramatically altered by the coming of \u201ctalking motion pictures.\u201d\n\nPhotoplay\u2019s cover story of December 1929 dealt with the hot topic of the new technology then upsetting the status quo in Hollywood, as one of the taglines explains: \u201cThe Microphone \u2014 The Terror of The Studios.\u201d\n\nPhotoplay\u2019s editors added another tagline on the cover\u2019s lower right hand corner: \u201cYou Can\u2019t Get Away With It In Hollywood\u201d \u2014 meaning that the days of \u201cimage only\u201d appeal for Hollywood\u2019s big stars were over. And for those involved in film at that time, this change was truly a terror.\n\n\n\nYoung Myrna Loy, who first worked in silent films. Click for Myrna Loy book.\n\n\u201cIt was a dreadful time, believe me,\u201d explained actress Myrna Loy to New York Times writer Guy Flatley in 1977, then writing a magazine piece at the 50th anniversary of sound in film. \u201cThere was panic everywhere,\u201d said Loy, \u201cand a lot of people said, \u2018This is ridiculous! Who wants to hear people talk?'\u201d Loy added that many people at the time still \u201cloved the silent film, the great art of pantomime perfected by the comedians and by [director, D.W.] Griffith.\u201d So much of what happened with the coming of sound \u201cwas terribly unfair,\u201d Loy charged. The studios, she believed, \u201cshould have taken the time to train those people whose voices didn\u2019t match their screen images\u2026.\u201d\n\nAnd indeed, for actors and actresses like Norma Talmadge, shown on Photoplay\u2019s cover, the problem was the sound of their voices. Often, it seemed, the image and voice didn\u2019t match up to what audiences had already cast in their minds and expected, and that\u2019s what touched off the panic among many actors and actresses, ruining some careers. But it wasn\u2019t just the movie stars with funny voices, explains Guy Flatley in his 1977 piece:\n\n\u201cEveryone was affected: actors, directors, studio chiefs, cameramen. For many the sound of the talkies was the sound of doom: Lionized stars, suddenly forced to speak, found their careers screeching to a halt. \u201cLionized stars, suddenly forced to speak, found their careers screeching to a halt.\u201d \u2013 Guy Flatley Directors accustomed to shouting orders to actors at the peak of a crucial scene heard themselves being shushed by the newly all-powerful sound technicians. Studio moguls who had reigned with supreme tyrannical confidence crumbled behind doors in solitary panic, frightened by the vast sums gambling on \u201ctalkies\u201d required.\n\n\u2026Cameras could no longer move freely, since the cameraman was now cramped into a huge soundproof booth, his camera robbed of almost all action. Even the scripts were different; tea-cup dramas, literal and static translations of Broadway plays initially dominated sound films\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain\u201d\n\n\n\nGene Kelly & Jean Hagen as Lina Lamont in hilarious \u2018sound check\u2019 scene from film \u2018Singin' in The Rain.\u2019 Click on photo to see YouTube video.\n\nSome of the early technical difficulties in making film with sound are accurately captured in a hilarious segment from the 1952 movie, Singing In the Rain, a film which is in part, about movie-making in the silent-to-sound era. During the famous \u201csound check\u201d scene in that film, Gene Kelley\u2019s character and female star, Lina Lamont, played by Jean Hagen, are trying to complete a key scene that contains amorous dialogue, but have repeated difficulties with sound, not least of which is the high-pitched voice of Lina, their big star. The directors and set crew try to record the scene numerous times, with each take confronting one or more of the temperamental variables now present in the new sound regime \u2014 all to the director\u2019s great hair- pulling frustration. Later, in the Singing in the Rain storyline, the resulting film preview is shown to a live audience, but proves to be a bust, revealing the new \u201ctalkie\u201d to be an embarrassing disaster. The big fraud then undertaken in an attempt to salvage the film and the career of the \u201csqueaky-voiced star\u201d Lina, is the dubbing of another voice in place of her\u2019s. The new voice belongs to Debbie Reynolds (Kathy), but the fraud is later revealed. Yet in real-life Hollywood, a number of careers, including that of Norma Talmadge, came to a untimely end with the onset of sound.\n\n\n\n\n\nNorma Talmadge\n\n\n\nSilent film star, Norma Talmadge. Click for rare films DVD.\n\nNorma Talmadge got her start in the movie business as a model for illustrated slides \u2014 the still images projected on movie house screens in the early days of film \u201csingalongs.\u201d Her first silent film role came in 1911 with Vitagraph Studios of Brooklyn, New York when she played a seamstress in A Tale of Two Cities. With good looks and talent, plus a mother who helped promote her, Norma Talmadge rose to become a leading-lady of the silent screen. A marriage to influential movie executive Joseph M. Schenck also helped, as Talmadge was set up in her own film company.\n\nTalmadge became known for her dramatic roles \u2014 the \u201ctwo-hankie\u201d weepers, as some were called. A big hit came with Kiki in 1926. But in 1929, after Norma ventured into her roles in talking pictures, a reversal of fortune set in. Norma Talmadge had a flat Brooklyn accent, and when this became clear with the talkies, it surprised audiences and was greatly at odds with her glamorous, big screen personality. \u201cNorma got a coach, but as soon as she tackled sound, she realized she\u2019d come a cropper,\u201d recalled screenwriter Anita Loos, who knew Talmadge and had worked with D.W. Griffith and other directors. \u201c\u2026But Norma had made over $5 million in silents,\u201d noted Loos, \u201cand was married to Joe Schenck, a multimillionaire. So it was no tragedy.\u201d\n\n\n\nNorma Talmadge on set of \u201cDu Barry, Woman of Passion,\u201d 1930.\n\nIn Time magazine of November 17, 1930, a reviewer of Talmadge\u2019s sound film, Du Barry \u2014 Woman of Passion, wrote, in part: \u201c\u2026Norma Talmadge plays less pompously than might be expected, but people who liked her program pictures in the old days may hope that this will be the last attempt to establish her as a great figure in sound pictures,\u201d offered the reviewer. \u201cHowever, her diction is improving; in her first dialog effort she talked like an elocution pupil; this time she talks like an elocution teacher.\u201d Not long thereafter, Norma Talmadge retired from film-making. And although she divorced Joseph Schenck in 1934, she was still an extraordinarily wealthy woman for the time. But once she left the world of Hollywood, she no longer felt obliged to her fans. Approached for her autograph in her post film-making years, she would wave people off, reportedly saying: \u201cGo away, my dears. I don\u2019t need you anymore.\u201d\n\nNorma Talmadge wasn\u2019t the only Hollywood star done in by the coming of sound. Dolores Costello, Corinne Griffith, May McAvoy, Charles Farrell, John Gilbert, and Marie Prevost, were among silent stars whose careers were ruined, shortened, or made difficult by the coming of sound. Other Hollywood hands \u2014 directors, writers, actors, etc., \u2014 had experiences, good and bad, with the silent-to-sound transition in film making. What follows below is a sampling of actors and directors offering their recollections and views on that changing era and difficult time in the film business.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrank Capra\n\n\n\nScreen credits for Frank Capra\u2019s famous film, \"It\u2019s A Wonderful Life\u201d of 1946. Click for DVD.\n\nFamous film director Frank Capra was right on the cusp of the silent-to-sound era. He worked as a prop man in silent films and also wrote and directed silent film comedies starring Harry Langdon and the Our Gang kids. Capra worked for Mack Sennett in 1924 and then moved to Columbia Pictures. He became famous for his own feature films of the 1930s and 1940s, among them: Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), Lost Horizon (1937), Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), Meet John Doe (1941), It Happened One Night (1941), and It\u2019s a Wonderful Life (1946). In 1977, Capra\u2019s views and recollections of the coming of sound to film were recounted with Guy Flatley in the New York Times.\n\n\u201c\u2026When film found its larynx,\u201d Capra said, \u201cit astonished, amazed and absolutely threw everyone into a tailspin.\u201d There was panic all around Hollywood, he explained. The studios were being asked to spend millions of dollars to revise everything. \u201c\u2026When film found its larynx, it astonished, amazed and absolutely threw everyone into a tailspin. There was panic all around Hollywood\u2026\u201d\n\n\u2013 Frank Capra \u201c\u2026Men like L. B. Mayer, powerful men who were in the habit of telling everyone in Hollywood what to do, were suddenly sitting in their offices, completely stunned. They didn\u2019t understand what the hell was going on, and so they lost control of the studio to the engineers. Soon the soundmen were telling everyone what to do\u2026\u201d\n\nBut the real chaos, said Capra, was among the actors. \u201cIt was easy enough to accommodate those who had experience on stage,\u201d he said, \u201cbut no film actor had ever learned lines before.\u201d Working on a completely silent set was another experience most film makers and actors had never had. \u201cIn the silent days,\u201d said Capra, \u201cthe cameraman was yelling, carpenters were hammering and a director was shouting commands on the next set. Then, all of a sudden, everything had to be as silent as a tomb. It was scary. The poor actors sweated, missed their lines, cried and broke down.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuddy Rogers in \"Wings,\" 1927.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuddy Rogers\n\nCharles Edward \u201cBuddy\u201d Rogers was born in 1904 in Olathe, Kansas. He became an American actor and jazz musician. He found his way into film when he was in college.\n\n\u201cI was studying journalism at the University of Kansas when Paramount came through looking for 10 boys and 10 girls to put together a Paramount School of Acting out at Astoria [Queens],\u201d he later told the New York Times. \u201cThey taught us how to roll down a flight of stairs without hurting ourselves, how to wear false beards and how to hold a kiss for three minutes without laughing.\u201d\n\nIn the mid-1920s, Rogers began acting professionally in Hollywood films. A talented trombonist, and skilled on several other musical instruments, Rogers performed with his own jazz band in motion pictures and on radio."}, {"url": "https://movingimage.us/collection/the-silent-film-era/", "page_content": "It is generally said to have begun in 1894, as the first paying customers lined up at a Kinetoscope Parlor showing films made by Thomas Edison near the corner of Broadway and 27th Street in Manhattan, and was certainly over by 1931, when the last of Hollywood's silent features were released by Paramount and United Artists.\n\nOnly later would those years be thought of as \"the silent film era,\" and sectioned off as a sort of prelude to the real movies that would follow. But the idea that their favorite new medium might be lacking in something essential had never occurred to audiences of the time. And the businessmen (and artists) who had created this industry were too busy enjoying their newfound fame and fortune to even dream of that sort of a change. As Harry Warner famously said, \"Who the hell wants to hear actors talk?\"\n\nThat was Warner's response to AT&T's offer to go in with them on a talking picture system. An experienced showman, he knew the sorry history of this concept, which one inventor or another was always touting as the next new thing in motion pictures. He also knew the amount of money that had been wasted on such gadgets. And he was right: there was no demand to hear actors speaking from the screen. But Warner saw something else, and did agree to help develop sound films, whose canned musical accompaniments could save the theater-owning brothers a fortune in weekly musicians' salaries. As with many technological innovations\u2014 including the internet\u2014the real benefits only became apparent after the system was already in place. And so the notion of a \"silent film era\" was born.\n\n***\n\nThe cinema is both an art and an industry, a curious mix of culture and technology that generations of critics and historians have puzzled over. The art part exists only on screen. By the 1930s a few museums and private collectors had already begun to collect prints of individual film titles, assessing their curatorial value through a range of ad hoc criteria. But the first museum to display its own collection of motion picture artifacts was the Smithsonian Institution, whose Graphic Arts Department began exhibiting film projectors and pre-cinema apparatus in 1897. A few others followed suit, sometimes putting their motion picture materials in the \"useful arts\" wing, sometimes the technology room, and occasionally even giving them a corner in the photography collection.\n\nHenri Langlois, one of the first film archivists, began to collect motion picture prints in the early 1930s, when he realized that silent films, now economically obsolete, were doomed. Langlois devoted his life to saving silent films, but he soon found himself saving every other film, too. Unlike rival archivists in New York or London, Langlois's criteria were not merely aesthetic, but cultural. He realized that cinema was not simply the part of the show that came in a can, but a complex web of economic, cultural, and technological factors which necessarily involved commerce and industry as well as art. Langlois ultimately tried to have it all, operating both an archive of films (cinematheque) and, for interpretive context, a mus\u00e9e du cinema. A radical policy for any film archive, it meant diverting scarce resources away from film prints in order to collect costumes and posters, movie cameras and theater programs.\n\nAlthough some supporters criticized this broad-based approach, few historians today would write a history of motion pictures without offering a clear understanding of their cultural and industrial context. Motion picture materials can now be found in dozens of collections all over the world, from theater libraries to science museums. Still, very few have the range of resources, from moviolas to fan magazines, to adequately document the complex role such materials have played in the development of moving image media.\n\n***\n\nAn earlier generation of historians, steeped in technological determinism, saw the coming of sound as a watershed, a step in the drive towards \"realism\" that would make everything that came before it suddenly irrelevant. Talkies did affect one corner of the marketplace, of course, as all those unemployed musicians could testify. But this was evolution, not revolution, and certainly no reason to banish the silent film to some cinematic dark age. As demonstrated by historians from Andr\u00e9 Bazin to David Bordwell, the introduction of sound was a speed bump, not an apocalypse. The grammar of film\u2014how the camera addresses its subject, and how editors cut shots together\u2014quickly returned to the classic style developed in the 1920s. No Hollywood studios went out of business. The same 35mm film went through the same film projectors (now with added sound heads), while audiences read the same film magazines and attended the same local theaters.\n\nDuring those few \"silent\" decades, Edison's invention had developed from a mechanical curiosity to a major international industry, and became\u2014as D. W. Griffith once boasted\u2014the only new art form created since antiquity. No primitive backwater, the years from 1894 to 1931 must have impressed both filmmakers and audiences as an unending stream of innovation and experimentation. Later years may have been dominated by Technicolor and television, but audiences of the 1920s would have wondered just why improvements like these took so long to catch on\u2014since both were already part of the creative mix long before The Jazz Singer (1927).\n\nSo while the advertising materials, home movie cameras, film costumes, and licensed merchandise shown here may differ in style from their modern equivalents, the important thing to remember is that their functions remain identical\u2014even in a digital age undreamed of by Harry Warner."}, {"url": "https://facts.net/silent-movie-stars/", "page_content": "In spite of their founding influence on Hollywood\u2019s formative era, modern audiences fail to recognize silent movie stars nowadays. Thanks to the advent of sound and rapid development of the film industry, the age of silent film have faded to obscurity. A truly stark contrast to movies and celebrities who are at the forefront of our pop-culture consciousness today.\n\nLet\u2019s take a trip down memory lane and take a look at some of the most iconic silent movie stars who helped shape the American film industry for decades.\n\nQuick Facts Essential Facts Interesting Facts Silent acting was also known as \u201cMime\u201d. Mary Pickford became Hollywood\u2019s first million-dollar actress. Charlie Chaplin is the most famous silent film star of all time, spanning a career of more than 75 years until his death in 1977. Silent film actor William S. Hart was Hollywood\u2019s first cowboy. The last surviving silent movie star, Baby Peggy, died in 2020 at 101 years old. The silent film era existed from the mid-1890s until the late 1920s. People also coined it as \u201cThe Age of the Silver Screen\u201d Silent movie stars exaggerate body language and facial expressions for the audience to better understand what they were feeling and portraying on screen. \u201cThe First Lady of American Cinema\u201d, Lillian Gish, starred in the highest-grossing film of the silent era, The Birth of a Nation. Douglas Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin were best friends. The former also had a 16-year marriage to Mary Pickford until they divorced in 1936. Most silent movie stars\u2019 careers dwindled during the advent of sound films or \u201ctalkies\u201d Japanese silent film actor and matin\u00e9e idol, Sessue Hayakawa, was the first Hollywood leading man of Asian descent. Greta Garbo\u2019s popularity only soared higher when she transitioned to sound films, her first speaking line famously publicized with the catchphrase \u201cGarbo talks!\u201d Clara Bow popularized the term \u201cIt Girl\u201d, thanks to her leading role in the movie It. Famous Hollywood actress, Drew Barrymore, is John Barrymore\u2019s granddaughter. Behind the cameras, silent movie stars were often involved in twisted scandals and tragedies. Max Linder spiraled down into a severe depression when he was seriously wounded during WWI, eventually committing suicide at age 41. Charlie Chaplin was so popular even in death that his body was snatched from its grave by robbers and held at ransom for $600,000. Fox Studios promoted Theda Bara as an Egyptian-born actress, with a French mother and an Italian father, despite being Jewish because mystery and exoticism were popular at that time. Harold Lloyd\u2019s famous hanging clock sequence in Safety Last! is the most recognized image in silent film history.\n\nTable of Contents 01 Buster Keaton 02 Charlie Chaplin 03 Wallace Reid 04 Douglas Fairbanks 05 Mary Pickford 06 John Gilbert 07 Greta Garbo 08 Jackie Coogan 09 Clara Bow 10 Norma Shearer 11 Rudolph Valentino 12 Harold Lloyd 13 Lillian Gish 14 Roscoe \u201cFatty\u201d Arbuckle 15 Colleen Moore 16 William S.

Today, however, he is considered one of the best stunt performers to have ever lived. He executed breathtaking stunts throughout his career such as grabbing the back of a moving vehicle to escape. He even survived a broken neck from a torrent of water falling on him from a water tower. Keaton\u2019s comedic chops and inventive feats make his films a thrill to watch, even until now.\n\nCharlie Chaplin Even those who aren\u2019t into films or film history would\u2019ve heard of Charlie Chaplin, perhaps one of the most famous silent movie stars of all time. Despite being primarily known as a comedic actor, Chaplin revolutionized global cinema as a whole. As a pioneering figure, Chaplin first popularised feature-length comedy. Prior to Chaplin, comedy mostly featured short films as a film genre. His onscreen persona, The Tramp, continues to be a worldwide icon today.\n\nWallace Reid Dubbed \u201cthe screen\u2019s most perfect lover\u201d and the perfect matinee idol, Reid earned such praises with his built physique and sex appeal. Unfortunately, he fell into a victim to Hollywood\u2019s darker side and his career came to a halt. At the behest of his producer, Jesse Lasky, he was prescribed morphine so he could continue filming. Unable to keep up with the grueling filming schedules, Reid quickly became addicted to it. He passed away in a sanatorium, at the young age of 31, while trying to recover from his drug addiction.\n\nRead also: 30 Surprising Facts About Family Guys Famous Peter Griffin\n\nDouglas Fairbanks The quintessential action hero of the silent film era, Fairbanks made his fame playing the swashbuckling hero in adventure films that included The Three Musketeers, The Mark of Zorro, and perhaps his most famous role, Robin Hood. Robin Hood also holds the distinction of being the first motion picture ever to have a Hollywood premiere.\n\nMary Pickford Pickford defined cinema\u2019s ing\u00e9nue archetype with her sweet looks and appealingly raw sincerity, thus, earning the title \u201cAmerica\u2019s sweetheart\u201d. Along with her movie star husband, Douglas Fairbanks, she co-founded the United Artists film studio. She also co-founded the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nJohn Gilbert After a few years doing bit parts in movies, Gilbert rose to fame as a popular leading man in silent romantic films. Female audiences swooned over his suave good looks and magnetic charm, earning him the nickname \u201cThe Great Lover\u201d. Nowadays, however, Gilbert is better remembered as one of the most famous silent movie stars who didn\u2019t make it in talkies. His rumored \u201csqueaky\u201d voice made him a poor choice for sound films. Gilbert\u2019s later films, however, disproved this myth, as they showcased his rich baritone voice. Today, critics mostly attribute his decline to studio politics.\n\nGreta Garbo Unlike her popular onscreen partner, John Gilbert, Garbo is an example of a silent film star whose popularity only grew with the rise of talkies. Already one of the most popular female silent movie stars, she delivered memorable and understated performances as a dramatic actor in silent film tragedies. As sound films began to take over, Garbo\u2019s distinctive husky voice made her even more appealing to audiences. Her role in the sound film A Woman of Affairs (1928) made her MGM\u2019s highest box-office grossing star.\n\nJackie Coogan One of the first child stars in Hollywood history at the age of three, Coogan began making appearances in both vaudeville and cinema. Charlie Chaplin soon discovered the boy and was so impressed, he began casting Coogan in his own films, which resulted in fame. As Coogan entered adulthood, however, he sued his mother and stepfather for squandering his film earnings. The ensuing legal battle led to the enactment of the California Child Actors Bill, commonly known as the Coogan Act, meant to legally protect the earnings of child actors.\n\nClara Bow Ever heard of the term \u2018it girl\u2019? The phrase has already existed since the start of the 20th century, but the silent romantic comedy It (1927), popularized it. The success of the film, which starred Bow as the protagonist, made her a major film star, and led people to nickname her \u2018The It Girl\u2019. Bow went on to become one of the leading sex symbols of the Roaring Twenties.\n\nRead also: A Complete List of Stephen King Books in Order\n\nNorma Shearer One of the first stars created by MGM Studios, Shearer had the ability to bring spunk, poise, and frank sexuality to her characters. The first Jewish woman to win an Academy, she also had five Academy Awards nominations for acting under her belt, owing to her versatility and sophistication.\n\nRudolph Valentino An Italian actor based in Hollywood and famously known as the \u201cLatin Lover\u201d, Valentino started off as a villainous foreigner. Despite that, screenwriter June Mathis lobbied for him to be cast in a more heroic role in her film. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921) paved the way for his transition into a leading man. His exotic good looks and refined demeanor garnered him a massive, almost exclusively female fanbase. Tragically, Valentino ranks among the silent film stars who died young, passing at the age of 31.\n\nHarold Lloyd Along with Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin, Lloyd rounds out the silent era\u2019s trio of most renowned film comedians. Like Keaton, Lloyd performed daredevil stunts. In 1919, an incident with a bomb mistaken for a prop led to Lloyd losing the thumb and index finger on his right hand. Even this couldn\u2019t stop Lloyd as he continued to act and perform his own stunts using a prosthetic glove to hide the wound. Even more prolific an actor than Chaplin, Lloyd made almost 200 comedy films spanning from 1914 to 1947.\n\nLillian Gish The \u201cFirst Lady of American Cinema\u201d and regarded as perhaps one of the best film actresses of all time, Gish transitioned from the stage to film. She pioneered the silver screen at a time when serious thespians still regarded cinema as a baser form of entertainment compared to theater. Her most famous work, The Birth of a Nation, is also the highest-grossing film of the silent era.\n\nRoscoe \u201cFatty\u201d Arbuckle One of the most sought-after silent movie actors around the 1910s, film buffs might remember him as Charlie Chaplin\u2019s mentor. He also helped discover Buster Keaton. Unfortunately, Arbuckle got entangled in a series of widely publicized trials for the killing of fellow actress Virginia Rappe. Although acquitted, the shadow of this scandal loomed over his career, and he became essentially blacklisted from Hollywood. As a result, Arbuckle went down in history as one of the most forgotten silent film stars.\n\nColleen Moore Regarded as one of the most fashionable and successful actresses of the silent film era, Moore, along with Clara Bow, also popularized the bob cut. Despite her success, almost half of Moore\u2019s films have been lost today.\n\nWilliam S. Hart Hollywood\u2019s first cowboy movie star and the forerunner of other famous Western stars such as Gary Cooper, Randolph Scott, and John Wayne. Originally a Broadway actor, Hart entered the film industry fairly late but he quickly made a name for himself as one of the silent era\u2019s leading Western heroes.\n\nErich von Stroheim Stroheim started out as an actor and a stunt performer in the silent film industry. Then, he quickly gained acclaim as one of the most visionary directors of the silent film era and foremost auteur directors. Refusing to compromise on his artistic vision even for commercial or budgetary reasons, Stroheim constantly clashed with Hollywood studios. This eventually led him to be banned as a director. Nevertheless, Stroheim continued to work as a respected actor until he passed in 1957.\n\nBen Turpin Ever tried to cross your eyes before? Meet Ben Turpin, the comedian, and actor who made the cross-eyed appearance his comedic brand. Turpin\u2019s memorable visage and physical comedy made him a popular comedic performer in the age of silent films. Unfortunately, Turpin didn\u2019t transition to talkies, as he chose to retire during the advent of sound.\n\nSessue Hayakawa The first actor of Asian descent to find fame as a leading man in the West and among the first male sex symbols of Hollywood. Although Hayakawa\u2019s brooding good looks and sex appeal made him a heartthrob, his race marked him for discrimination. He frequently acted in villainous roles, and his dissatisfaction with the typecasting eventually led him to form his own production company.\n\nJohn Barrymore A highly respected Broadway veteran even before his transition to the silver screen, Barrymore earned the nickname \u201cThe Great Profile\u201d because of his classically good looks and upright posture. He had a noted preference for posing in photographs and posters showing his left side.
