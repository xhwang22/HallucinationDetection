Miller, ASC is at the hand-cranked Bell & Howell 2709 camera, lining up on actor Richard Barthelmess while shooting the silent picture Experience (1921) for director George Fitzmaurice (seated).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the early days of cinema, many directors of photography across the United States were faced with the same problem: big, ugly white streaks in their footage created by static electricity discharge created by their hand-cranked cameras. Instead working on their solutions in isolation, a two small groups of idealists, one located on each coast, came together to solve this and many other technical problems of the day.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ASC charter from the state of California. (Click here to open in new window.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were the Cinema Camera Club, started by Edison cameramen Philip E. Rosen, Frank Kugler and Lewis W. Physioc in New York in 1913; and the Static Club of America, a Los Angeles-based society first headed by Universal cameraman Harry H. Harris.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the beginning, the two clubs had a loose affiliation, and eventually the West Coast organization changed its name to the Cinema Camera Club of California. But even as the center of film production shifted from New York to Los Angeles, the western organization was struggling to stay afloat.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhil Rosen came to Los Angeles in 1918. When he sought affiliation with the Cinema Camera Club of California, president Charles Rosher asked if he would help reorganize the association. Rosen sought to create a national organization, with membership by invitation and a strong educational component.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reorganization committee met in the home of William C. Foster on Saturday, December 21, 1918, and drew up a new set of bylaws. The 10-member committee and five visitors were designated as the board of governors for the new organization. The next evening, in the home of Fred LeRoy Granville, the first officers for the American Society of Cinematographers were elected: Philip E. Rosen, president; Charles Rosher, vice-president; Homer A. Scott, second vice-president; William C. Foster, treasurer; and Victor Milner, secretary. The Society was chartered by the State of California on January 8, 1919.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ASC\u2019s declared purpose: to advance the art of cinematography through artistry and technological progress, and to cement a closer relationship among cinematographers to exchange ideas, discuss techniques and promote cinema as an art form.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 15 original ASC members were Joe August, L.D. Clawson, Arthur Edeson, William C. Foster, Eugene Gaudio, Fred Le Roy Granville, Walter L. Griffin, J.D. Jennings, Roy H. Klaffki, Victor Milner, Robert S. Newhard, Philip E. Rosen, Charles G.

That close-up, that moment, is, to me, the most beautiful close-up ever shot \u2014 it\u2019s beyond beautiful.\n\nI love Casablanca. The trickeries of the lighting \u2014 the airport that doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s on stage. You feel the airport\u2019s presence, because they\u2019re panning a spotlight through the background. That airport had such a dynamic emotional element to it, and you feel the panic of not being able to escape, and it\u2019s just a spotlight! It\u2019s like magic.

The camera angles and the lighting are the crucial components of how the story is told. If you take away the visual elements, the story wouldn\u2019t be as powerful \u2014 and I think this is a requirement for a milestone of cinematography. This is where all the kudos go to the film\u2019s cinematographer, Robert Krasker, BSC. The famous scene when we first see Orson Welles\u2019 character, Harry Lime, drowned in shadow \u2014 you don\u2019t see his face at all, just a pair of shoes and the cat. Then all of a sudden, a neighbor in the building turns on the light and we see Harry Lime for the first time. It\u2019s told with the lighting and the camera.

I think it [epitomizes] everything that is amazing about this film \u2014 how they can do acrobatics with the camera and [accomplish] great technical achievements for that time, but in service to the film\u2019s language, and to a message, and in a way that actually serves the story.\n\n\n\nThey didn\u2019t have cranes or drones, yet the camera elevates and does all of these acrobatics. They had to create this whole system, where the operator wore a vest with a lot of hooks, and [crewmembers] were hooking him and unhooking him, and lifting him, and making him fly \u2014 with very simple means. The sequence starts with the camera on ground level, at a wide angle only a few inches from a young woman, so you really feel like you\u2019re at this \u2018human\u2019 level. But then the camera starts to lift up vertically, and then horizontally to enter the third floor of a tobacco factory. It goes through the interior of that floor, and as if the shot wasn\u2019t spectacular enough \u2014 especially for the time \u2014 the camera travels through [another] window and flies over the street, where you see a top shot of the procession. You\u2019re now three stories high, and you see hundreds of people around the body, walking through the street, and the camera keeps flying above them.\n\nTo do all of that in one single take \u2014 on film, in the 1960s in Cuba, with such limited technology \u2014 is amazing, but it\u2019s not just a technical stunt. The film\u2019s language, acrobatics and camera stunts come together in this shot to tell that story. It touches all the elements that it needs to touch during the shot, going from the individual, to the collective, to the group of workers, to the big collective, which is almost like a wide shot of Cuba itself. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to have a spectacular shot if it doesn\u2019t have a meaning and a purpose behind it.\n\nDoctor Zhivago (1965), shot by Freddie Young, BSC\n\nThe Battle of Algiers (1966), shot by Marcello Gatti\n\nThe Battle of Algiers (1966)\n\nChris Menges, ASC, BSC: The Battle of Algiers is a startling and brilliant film about the Algerian war for independence from France. Shot in black-and-white, there are the most amazing re-created scenes of the struggle in the Casbah, the citadel of Algiers, with thousands of extras. There are scenes in which the tension is so powerful, scenes so moving, that you want to cry out. It is filmmaking at its greatest.\n\n\n\nCinematographer Marcello Gatti wheels the handheld camera to catch the moment. [Director] Gillo Pontecorvo lets the shots develop, never using the classical-editing reverse-shot technique. It\u2019s inspired newsreel style: in black-and-white, with documentary-type editing to add to its sense of historical authenticity. The technique is enthralling.\n\nPontecorvo said, \u2018My idea was to give the audience the impression that it was watching a documentary as events happened. We wanted our film to look like newsreel that looked grainy. Using a handheld camera let us spontaneously catch interesting faces and action.\u2019\n\nA superb film \u2014 it lives!\n\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

I realized ultimately that it was the cinematography that did that. Robert Surtees, ASC immediately became my hero.

When I first saw it, I just loved it \u2014 but I didn\u2019t appreciate, as much as I later came to, how beautiful the photography was, and how important it was. It was such an otherworldly experience, and yet so real. It was like an extremely real dream, so I wasn\u2019t thinking too much about how they\u2019d gone about doing it.

Antiestablishmentarianism, nihilistic characters, and provocative tales of paranoia were increasingly normalized, even in the far-more-wholesome realm of network television.\n\n\n\nYet the astonishing box-office success of such optimistic, hero-driven, mid-to-late-\u201970s films as Jaws, Rocky, Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Superman: The Movie, and even Grease pointed in a new direction, with the studios seeking to capitalize on a perceived resurgence in \u201ccrowd-pleaser\u201d pictures. Executives soon began green-lighting more high-dollar projects featuring dynamic cinematography and the latest in rapidly evolving visual-effects techniques.\n\nDuring the 1980s, American Cinematographer documented many of the resulting projects, launching into this new decade with a series of in-depth cover stories on such ambitious genre efforts as The Black Hole (AC Jan. \u201980; shot by Frank Phillips, ASC), Star Trek: The Motion Picture (AC Feb. \u201980; Richard H.

On July 2, 1961, he took his life with a shotgun at his house in Ketchum.\n\nErnest Hemingway was born in a suburb of Chicago . He was educated in the public schools and began to write in high school, where he was active and outstanding. The parts of his boyhood that mattered most to him were summers spent with his family on Walloon Lake, near Petoskey , Michigan .\n\nErnest Hemingway, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954, had a great impact on other writers through his deceptively simple, stripped-down prose, full of unspoken implication, and his tough but vulnerable masculinity, which created a myth that imprisoned the author and haunted the World War II generation.\n\nErnest Hemingway, in full Ernest Miller Hemingway, (born July 21, 1899, Cicero [now in Oak Park], Illinois, U.S.\u2014died July 2, 1961, Ketchum, Idaho), American novelist and short-story writer, awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. He was noted both for the intense masculinity of his writing and for his adventurous and widely publicized life. His succinct and lucid prose style exerted a powerful influence on American and British fiction in the 20th century.\n\nThe first son of Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, a doctor, and Grace Hall Hemingway, Ernest Miller Hemingway was born in a suburb of Chicago. He was educated in the public schools and began to write in high school, where he was active and outstanding, but the parts of his boyhood that mattered most were summers spent with his family on Walloon Lake in upper Michigan. On graduation from high school in 1917, impatient for a less-sheltered environment, he did not enter college but went to Kansas City, where he was employed as a reporter for the Star. He was repeatedly rejected for military service because of a defective eye, but he managed to enter World War I as an ambulance driver for the American Red Cross. On July 8, 1918, not yet 19 years old, he was injured on the Austro-Italian front at Fossalta di Piave. Decorated for heroism and hospitalized in Milan, he fell in love with a Red Cross nurse, Agnes von Kurowsky, who declined to marry him. These were experiences he was never to forget.\n\nBritannica Quiz Writer\u2019s Block\n\nAfter recuperating at home, Hemingway renewed his efforts at writing, for a while worked at odd jobs in Chicago, and sailed for France as a foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star. Advised and encouraged by other American writers in Paris\u2014F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound\u2014he began to see his nonjournalistic work appear in print there, and in 1925 his first important book, a collection of stories called In Our Time, was published in New York City; it was originally released in Paris in 1924.\n\nIn 1926 he published The Sun Also Rises, a novel with which he scored his first solid success. A pessimistic but sparkling book, it deals with a group of aimless expatriates in France and Spain\u2014members of the postwar Lost Generation, a phrase that Hemingway scorned while making it famous. This work also introduced him to the limelight, which he both craved and resented for the rest of his life. Hemingway\u2019s The Torrents of Spring, a parody of the American writer Sherwood Anderson\u2019s book Dark Laughter, also appeared in 1926.\n\nThe writing of books occupied Hemingway for most of the postwar years. He remained based in Paris, but he traveled widely for the skiing, bullfighting, fishing, and hunting that by then had become part of his life and formed the background for much of his writing. His position as a master of short fiction had been advanced by Men Without Women in 1927 and thoroughly established with the stories in Winner Take Nothing in 1933. Among his finest stories are \u201cThe Killers,\u201d \u201cThe Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber,\u201d and \u201cThe Snows of Kilimanjaro.\u201d At least in the public view, however, the novel A Farewell to Arms (1929) overshadowed such works. Reaching back to his experience as a young soldier in Italy, Hemingway developed a grim but lyrical novel of great power, fusing love story with war story. While serving with the Italian ambulance service during World War I, the American lieutenant Frederic Henry falls in love with the English nurse Catherine Barkley, who tends him during his recuperation after being wounded. She becomes pregnant by him, but he must return to his post. Henry deserts during the Italians\u2019 disastrous retreat after the Battle of Caporetto, and the reunited couple flee Italy by crossing the border into Switzerland. There, however, Catherine and her baby die during childbirth, and Henry is left desolate at the loss of the great love of his life.\n\nHemingway\u2019s love of Spain and his passion for bullfighting resulted in Death in the Afternoon (1932), a learned study of a spectacle he saw more as tragic ceremony than as sport. Similarly, a safari he took in 1933\u201334 in the big-game region of Tanganyika resulted in Green Hills of Africa (1935), an account of big-game hunting. Mostly for the fishing, he purchased a house in Key West, Florida, and bought his own fishing boat. A minor novel of 1937 called To Have and Have Not is about a Caribbean desperado and is set against a background of lower-class violence and upper-class decadence in Key West during the Great Depression.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

He raised money for the Republicans in their struggle against the Nationalists under General Francisco Franco, and he wrote a play called The Fifth Column (1938), which is set in besieged Madrid. As in many of his books, the protagonist of the play is based on the author. Following his last visit to the Spanish war, he purchased Finca Vig\u00eda (\u201cLookout Farm\u201d), an unpretentious estate outside Havana, Cuba, and went to cover another war\u2014the Japanese invasion of China.\n\nThe harvest of Hemingway\u2019s considerable experience of Spain in war and peace was the novel For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940), a substantial and impressive work that some critics consider his finest novel, in preference to A Farewell to Arms. It was also the most successful of all his books as measured in sales. Set during the Spanish Civil War, it tells of Robert Jordan, an American volunteer who is sent to join a guerrilla band behind the Nationalist lines in the Guadarrama Mountains. Most of the novel concerns Jordan\u2019s relations with the varied personalities of the band, including the girl Maria, with whom he falls in love. Through dialogue, flashbacks, and stories, Hemingway offers telling and vivid profiles of the Spanish character and unsparingly depicts the cruelty and inhumanity stirred up by the civil war. Jordan\u2019s mission is to blow up a strategic bridge near Segovia in order to aid a coming Republican attack, which he realizes is doomed to fail. In an atmosphere of impending disaster, he blows up the bridge but is wounded and makes his retreating comrades leave him behind, where he prepares a last-minute resistance to his Nationalist pursuers.\n\nAll of his life Hemingway was fascinated by war\u2014in A Farewell to Arms he focused on its pointlessness, in For Whom the Bell Tolls on the comradeship it creates\u2014and, as World War II progressed, he made his way to London as a journalist. He flew several missions with the Royal Air Force and crossed the English Channel with American troops on D-Day (June 6, 1944). Attaching himself to the 22nd Regiment of the 4th Infantry Division, he saw a good deal of action in Normandy and in the Battle of the Bulge. He also participated in the liberation of Paris, and, although ostensibly a journalist, he impressed professional soldiers not only as a man of courage in battle but also as a real expert in military matters, guerrilla activities, and intelligence collection.\n\nFollowing the war in Europe, Hemingway returned to his home in Cuba and began to work seriously again. He also traveled widely, and, on a trip to Africa, he was injured in a plane crash. Soon after (in 1953), he received the Pulitzer Prize in fiction for The Old Man and the Sea (1952), a short heroic novel about an old Cuban fisherman who, after an extended struggle, hooks and boats a giant marlin only to have it eaten by voracious sharks during the long voyage home. This book, which played a role in gaining for Hemingway the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954, was as enthusiastically praised as his previous novel, Across the River and into the Trees (1950), the story of a professional army officer who dies while on leave in Venice, had been damned.\n\nBy 1960 Hemingway had left Cuba and settled in Ketchum, Idaho. (He expressed his belief in what he called the \u201chistorical necessity\u201d of the Cuban Revolution; his attitude toward its leader, Fidel Castro, who had taken power in 1959, varied.) He tried to lead his life and do his work as before. For a while he succeeded, but, anxiety-ridden and depressed, he was twice hospitalized at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where he received electroshock treatments. Two days after his return to the house in Ketchum, he took his life with a shotgun. Hemingway had been married four times: to Hadley Richardson in 1921 (divorced 1927), Pauline Pfeiffer in 1927 (divorced 1940), Martha Gellhorn in 1940 (divorced 1945), and Mary Welsh in 1946. He had fathered three sons: John Hadley Nicanor (\u201cBumby\u201d), with Hadley, born in 1923; Patrick, with Pauline, in 1928; and Gregory, also with Pauline, in 1931.\n\nHemingway left behind a substantial amount of manuscript, some of which has been published. A Moveable Feast, an entertaining memoir of his years in Paris (1921\u201326) before he was famous, was issued in 1964. Islands in the Stream, three closely related novellas growing directly out of his peacetime memories of the Caribbean island of Bimini, of Havana during World War II, and of searching for U-boats off Cuba, appeared in 1970.\n\nHemingway\u2019s characters plainly embody his own values and view of life. The main characters of The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms, and For Whom the Bell Tolls are young men whose strength and self-confidence nevertheless coexist with a sensitivity that leaves them deeply scarred by their wartime experiences. War was for Hemingway a potent symbol of the world, which he viewed as complex, filled with moral ambiguities, and offering almost unavoidable pain, hurt, and destruction. To survive in such a world, and perhaps emerge victorious, one must conduct oneself with honour, courage, endurance, and dignity, a set of principles known as \u201cthe Hemingway code.\u201d To behave well in the lonely, losing battle with life is to show \u201cgrace under pressure\u201d and constitutes in itself a kind of victory, a theme clearly established in The Old Man and the Sea.\n\nHemingway\u2019s prose style was probably the most widely imitated of any in the 20th century. He wished to strip his own use of language of inessentials, ridding it of all traces of verbosity, embellishment, and sentimentality. In striving to be as objective and honest as possible, Hemingway hit upon the device of describing a series of actions by using short, simple sentences from which all comment or emotional rhetoric has been eliminated. These sentences are composed largely of nouns and verbs, have few adjectives and adverbs, and rely on repetition and rhythm for much of their effect. The resulting terse, concentrated prose is concrete and unemotional yet is often resonant and capable of conveying great irony through understatement. Hemingway\u2019s use of dialogue was similarly fresh, simple, and natural-sounding. The influence of this style was felt worldwide wherever novels were written, particularly from the 1930s through the \u201950s.\n\nA consummately contradictory man, Hemingway achieved a fame surpassed by few, if any, American authors of the 20th century. The virile nature of his writing, which attempted to re-create the exact physical sensations he experienced in wartime, big-game hunting, and bullfighting, in fact masked an aesthetic sensibility of great delicacy. He was a celebrity long before he reached middle age, but his popularity continues to be validated by serious critical opinion."}, {"url": "https://theasc.com/the-15-founders-of-the-american-society-of-cinematographers", "page_content": "Founders of the American Society of Cinematographers\n\nWho were the 15 original members of the ASC when it was established in 1919?\n\nBy Robert S. Birchard\n\n\n\nThe American Society of Cinematographers succeeded two earlier organizations \u2014 the Cinema Camera Club, started by Edison camerapersons Philip E. Rosen, Frank Kugler and Lewis W. Physioc in New York in 1913; and the Static Club of America, a Los Angeles\u2013based society first headed by Universal cameraperson Harry H. Harris.\n\nFrom the beginning, the two clubs had a loose affiliation, and eventually the West Coast organization changed its name to the Cinema Camera Club of California. But, even as the center of film production shifted from New York to Los Angeles \u2014 the western cinematographers\u2019 organization was struggling to stay afloat.\n\nRosen came to Los Angeles in 1918. When he sought affiliation with the Cinema Camera Club of California, president Charles Rosher asked if he would help reorganize the faltering association. Rosen sought to create a national organization, with membership by invitation and with a strong educational component.\n\nThe reorganization committee met in the home of William C. Foster on Saturday, December 21, 1918 and drew up a new set of bylaws. The 10-member committee and five invited Cinema Camera Club member visitors were designated as the board of governors for the new organization.\n\nThe next evening, in the home of Fred LeRoy Granville, officers for the American Society of Cinematographers were elected \u2014 Philip E. Rosen, president; Charles Rosher, vice president; Homer A. Scott, second vice president; William C. Foster, treasurer; and Victor Milner, secretary.\n\nThe Society was chartered by the State of California on January 8, 1919.\n\nSo, who were the 15 founders of the ASC? Some are among the best-known cinematographers of all time, yet others are not well remembered at all.\n\nHere are their stories.\n\nDirector Phil Rosen (seated, wearing glasses) is surrounded by actors and associates on the set of Heart of a Siren (1925). Conway Tearle (seated, front left) and Barbara LaMarr (in white dress) starred. Henry Hull (between LaMarr and Rosen), Ann Pennington (seated, front right), Arnold Daly (standing, back left), and (continuing to the right) Harry Morey, Ben Finney and Veree Teasdale also took roles in the film. Rosen served as the ASC\u2019s first president, but almost immediately abandoned the camera for the megaphone. The ASC\u2019s Clubhouse since 1937 is the former home of Conway Tearle.\n\nPhilip E. Rosen\n\nBorn May 8, 1888, in Poland and raised in Machias, Maine, Rosen worked as a projectionist and lab technician before becoming an $18-a-week cinematographer in 1912. He became a co-founder of the Cinema Camera Club in New York City while working at the Thomas A. Edison Studio and later worked at Fox and shot several of Theda Bara\u2019s pictures, including Kreutzer Sonata, The Clemenceau Case, The Two Orphans and Sin (all 1915).\n\nRosen came to California in 1918 to photograph George Loane Tucker\u2019s The Miracle Man (Mayflower-Paramount, 1919), starring Lon Chaney. The success of the film brought Rosen an offer to direct from Universal, and over the next 30 years he helmed some 140 films.\n\nHe directed Rudolph Valentino in The Young Rajah (1922) and one of the most acclaimed films of the Silent Era, The Dramatic Life of Abraham Lincoln (1924), but more often than not he was a director of efficient low-budget quickies.\n\nRosen was the first \u2014 but not the last \u2014 ASC member to give up his backward cap for a director\u2019s chair and became active in the formation of the Screen Directors Guild in 1936. He served on their board and as treasurer through 1941.\n\nAt the age of 63, he died of a heart attack on October 22, 1951.\n\nHomer A. Scott\n\nAlthough he was a leader in the earliest days of the ASC and served as president from 1925\u2013\u201926 \u2014 Scott has proven to be one of the more elusive founders. He was born in Cambria Center, New York, on October 1, 1880.\n\nScott\u2019s earliest known credits are as cinematographer for actor Carlyle Blackwell\u2019s Favorite Players Film Company in 1914. When Blackwell signed with the Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company in 1915, Scott followed.\n\nScott in the 1920s, during his days as comedy king Mack Sennett\u2019s lead feature cinematographer.\n\nBeginning in 1916, he worked under the direction of William Desmond Taylor with Lasky\u2019s sister company, the Oliver Morosco Photoplay Company, in a variety of genres, culminating in several films starring Jack Pickford. Among them were Tom Sawyer (1917) and Huck and Tom (1918). In 1921, Scott photographed Molly-O, starring Mabel Normand, for Mack Sennett. Over the next two years he shot all of Sennett\u2019s feature projects, including The Crossroads of New York (1922), The Shriek of Araby (1923) and The Extra Girl (1923).\n\nScott never shied away from dangerous assignments. He was scheduled for execution in a Mexican jail as a rebel spy while photographing their revolution in 1912, but was finally pardoned after four tense days of uncertainty. During the making of The Right Direction (1916) for Pallas Pictures, a cavalry charge at his camera position resulted in a wrecked camera and Scott being hospitalized with \u201cseveral painful though not serious injuries.\u201d Scott remained cranking his camera until impact. He was trapped for six hours in a diving bell 30' underwater after a steel suspension ring broke during the filming of the Maurice Tourneur production Deep Waters (1920) off the coast of Catalina Island. He and an assistant were both unconscious when they were finally rescued.\n\nScott\u2019s name appeared on the ASC roster for years, but his name disappeared from the credits of feature films after 1923. In that year, he was loaned to Warner Bros. to shoot The Little Church Around the Corner and is said to have started shooting Warners\u2019 The Marriage Circle for director Ernst Lubitsch before being replaced. He is known to have worked as a second cameraperson for comedian Harold Lloyd, but he mainly did underwater work and other specialized cinematography in his later career. In the 1930s he did the marine work on Bird of Paradise, Tiger Shark and Below the Sea, among others.\n\nScott retired from films in 1936 and moved to the Newcastle district of Placer County to take up ranching.\n\nHe died in Sacramento, California, on December 23, 1956.\n\nFrom left, director Frank Lloyd, actress Jewel Carmen and Foster discuss a scene, likely during the production of American Methods (1917).\n\nWilliam C. Foster\n\nA pioneer of cinematography, Foster was born in Bushnell, Illinois, on December 28, 1880, and went to work for the Chicago-based Selig Polyscope Company in 1901. At the time, Selig was turning out 50' and 100' actualities and trick films. Foster left Selig in May of 1911 to join Carl Laemmle\u2019s Independent Moving Pictures Company. In 1915, he signed with the Equitable Motion Picture Corporation, working in New York and Florida.\n\nFoster was lead cinematographer on the first five two-reelers that Charlie Chaplin made for Mutual Film Corporation in 1916 \u2014 The Floorwalker, The Fireman, One A.M., The Count and The Vagabond. He later shot a number of pictures with director Frank Lloyd, including A Tale of Two Cities (Fox, 1917) and The Silver Horde (Goldwyn, 1920) and also worked with director Lois Weber on pictures including To Please One Woman (1920) and What\u2019s Worth While (1921). For a time, he was also the superintendent of the laboratories at Universal.\n\nActive in the ASC leadership, Foster served the Society membership as treasurer and first vice-president, as well as on the Board of Governors\n\nHe died on January 18, 1923, from complications related to syphilis, politely described as the \u201cgeneral paralysis of the insane.\"\n\nClawson (left) was one of an army of eight cinematographers who shot the battle scene for The Patent Leather Kid (First National, 1927). The identity of the other cameraperson is unknown.\n\nLawrence D. Clawson\n\nClawson was a veteran of some 17 years behind a movie camera when he helped found the ASC in 1919. He was born on October 4, 1885, in Salt Lake City, Utah, and his first camerawork was in association with local theater manager Harry Revier, who started the Revier Film Manufacturing Company in Salt Lake City to produce pictures in 1910.\n\nClawson moved to Los Angeles in 1912, but his first known feature credits as a cinematographer are for director Lois Weber at Bosworth, Inc. and Universal in 1914\u2013\u201915. He also worked for the American Film Company and Ince-Triangle-KayBee, where photographic superintendent and future director Irvin Willat would remember Clawson as \u201csort of like a news cameraman\u201d who was not especially noted for his lighting style.\n\nBy the early 1920s, Clawson was chief cinematographer for the popular star Anita Stewart at Louis B. Mayer Productions, yet later in the decade he often worked as a second cameraperson. He was lead cinematographer on the early talkie Syncopation (1929), however his few remaining credits were for expedition films such as Hunting Tigers in India (1929) and low-budget productions including The Black King and The Horror (both 1932).\n\nClawson died in Englewood, New Jersey, on July 18, 1937.\n\nDirector Howard Hickman, also the husband of actress Bessie Barriscale, shows leading man Jack Holt (far right) how to embrace Mrs. Hickman during the production of Kitty Kelly, M.D. (1919), Capturing the scene is Gaudio \u2014 employing a Bell & Howell 2709.\n\nGaudio, from a portrait reproduced in the February 1, 1922 issue of AC.\n\nEugene Gaudio\n\nThe younger brother of future ASC member Tony Gaudio, he was born in Italy on December 26, 1886. He learned photography in his father\u2019s portrait studio and developed an interest in movies around 1905. After coming to the United States, landing in New York City, he served as lab superintendent for IMP and Life Photo Film Corporation.\n\nArriving in California in 1915, Gaudio came out of the darkroom and went behind the camera for Universal Film Manufacturing Company \u2014 now Universal Pictures. The best known of his efforts as a cinematographer there was on the 1916 silent production of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\n\nHe later photographed films for Metro\u2019s top female stars, Alla Nazimova and May Allison. His final work was with actress Bessie Barriscale\u2019s B. B. Features.\n\nGaudio suffered an acute attack of appendicitis and tragically died on August 1, 1920, from general peritonitis after an operation.\n\nWalter L. Griffin\n\nWalter L. Griffin\n\nBorn in Fort Worth, Texas, on July 19, 1889, Griffin was a projectionist in a Los Angeles theater in 1910 and spent a year and a half in the lab before he first cranked a camera for Universal in 1914.\n\nIn 1915, he joined the Exposition Players' Corporation as the official cinematographers of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, where he headed photographic and lab operations. When the exposition closed in 1916, he spent four months in Colorado making scenic films for Denver Tourist Bureau.\n\nReturning to Hollywood, Griffin signed on with the National Film Corporation where he shot some 25 comedies featuring National\u2019s owner, William \u201cSmiling Bill\u201d Parsons. His best remembered film is Nomads of the North (1920) starring Lon Chaney, which was filmed for the National Film Corporation but released through the Associated First National Exhibitors Circuit after the untimely death of William Parsons caused the studio to close.\n\nThrough the early 1920s, Griffin ground out low-budget Westerns starring Bob Custer, Franklyn Farnum and Al Hoxie. In the mid-1920s, he gave up the wide-open spaces for the great indoors and shot a number of modest melodramas, including Rose of the Bowery (1927) and The Heart of Broadway (1928). His last known credit as a cinematographer was on City of Purple Dreams (1928).\n\nIn 1928, he retired from films and opened a florist shop and nursery on Lankershim Blvd., just north of Hollywood. He died in Ventura, California, on March 25, 1954.\n\nRoy H. Klaffki. Another portrait from the February 1, 1922 issue of AC.\n\nRoy H. Klaffki\n\nBorn in California on March 6, 1882, Klaffki was a cinematographer for a dozen years or more, working in England as well as Hollywood, but, in 1922, American Cinematographer reported that \u201che prefers just now to be identified with the laboratory rather than the camera.\n\nHe had the title director of photography at Metro Pictures in the early 1920s \u2014 shooting films as well as supervising the work of other staff cinematographers and overseeing quality control in the lab. His pictures there included The Infamous Miss Revell (1921).\n\n\n\nKlaffki took a similar position at Goldwyn in 1923 and later went on to shoot such pictures as Three Wise Crooks (1925), Queen O\u2019Diamonds (1926), The Adorable Deceiver (1926; directed by ASC co-founder Phil Rosen) and The Impostor (1926).\n\nHis last feature credit was as associate cinematographer on the opulent and indulgent drama The Wedding March (1928), principally photographed by Hal Mohr, ASC. Directed by and starring Erich von Stroheim, it features Fay Wray and Zasu Pitts, and portions were photographed in two-strip Technicolor by Ray Rennahan, ASC. The shoot lasted eight months before Paramount pulled the plug; von Stroheim\u2019s initial cut ran nine hours and a studio-edited version was not a success.\n\nKlaffki would finish his career as a technician with the Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation.\n\nHe died on September 20, 1965, of malnutrition resulting from esophageal-tracheal abscesses with complications from pulmonary emphysema.\n\nCharles E. Rosher\n\nCharles E. Rosher\n\nBorn on November 17, 1885, in London, England, Rosher hoped for a diplomatic career, but his interest in photography led him to apprenticeships with still photographers David Blount and Howard Farmer. In 1908, he became assistant to Richard Speaight, official photographer for the British Crown. Rosher was invited to show his still work at the Eastman School of Photography, and when he came to the States to accompany the exhibit, he brought a Williamson movie camera and started shooting actualities. He was friendly with fellow Englishman David Horsley, who started the Centaur Film Company in the backyard of his Ideal Billiard Parlor in Bayonne, New Jersey, in 1907.\n\nIn 1910, Horsley offered Rosher a job, and the cinematographer came west with the renamed Nestor Film Company, arriving in Hollywood on October 27, 1911. When Nestor was absorbed by Universal in 1912, Rosher went along. He left in 1913 to shoot footage of Pancho Villa in Mexico and then returned to Universal briefly before joining the staff of the Lasky Feature Play Company.\n\n\n\nAt the Pickford-Fairbanks Studio during production of Rosita (Pickford-United Artists, 1923) are (from left) James Townsend, assistant director; Paul Perry (kneeling), camera assistant; Ted Reed, production manager; Irvin K. Martin, set designer; Rosher; Ernst Lubitsch, director; Mary Pickford, star, studio head and producer; Erich Locke, continuity; Edward Knoblock, screenwriter; and Mitchell Leisen, costumer.\n\nRosher became Mary Pickford\u2019s cinematographer and photographed all her films from How Could You, Jean? (1918) through My Best Girl (1927). Pickford occasionally loaned Rosher out to other producers. One of these loan-outs was for Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (Fox, 1927), which earned Rosher and co-cinematographer Karl Struss, ASC the first Academy Award for Best Cinematography.\n\n\n\nRosher fell out with Pickford when he was unwilling to shoot Coquette (1929) with cameras locked down in soundproof \u201ciceboxes.\u201d He had no trouble finding work at other studios, however, and earned six additional Academy Award nominations throughout the years. With his work on Kismet (1944), Rosher gained a reputation for his color work, and he received the Oscar for Best Color Cinematography on The Yearling (1946).\n\n\n\nRosher retired in 1955 and died in Lisbon, Portugal, on January 15, 1974.\n\n\n\nFrom left are producer-director Cecil B. DeMille and Milner between takes on the elaborate barge set for Cleopatra (Paramount, 1934). Milner won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography for this film.\n\nVictor Milner\n\nBorn in Chavli, Russia, on December 15, 1891, Milner and his family arrived in New York City when he was 13. He first became interested in the movies at that age while attending dingy nickelodeons, watching the projector operators who were not yet hidden from view in fireproof booths. \u201cThe operator would let me take control of the projector whenever his girlfriend came to visit him,\u201d Milner remembered.\n\n\n\nHe found a job with Eberhard Schneider, who manufactured motion picture cameras and other film equipment. His first experience cranking a movie camera came when he shot footage of a storm at Rockaway Beach. In 1913, at the age of 22, Milner shot his first feature film, Hiawatha: The Indian Passion Play, but he soon returned to shooting actualities, becoming one of the first four camerapersons hired by the Path\u00e9 News.\n\n\n\nMilner shooting the 1934 version of Cleopatra.\n\nIn 1916, Milner came to California on his honeymoon and heard that the Balboa Amusement Producing Company in Long Beach was looking for a cinematographer. He got the job and gave up newsreels for dramatic films. He later gained attention as second cameraperson on 17 films for Western star William S. Hart. Milner also worked at Metro and Universal, sometimes in the first camera position and sometimes in the second \u2014 as with Scaramouche (1923), which he co-photographed with future ASC member John Seitz.\n\n\n\nMilner landed at Paramount in 1925 and spent the rest of his career at that studio, earning nine Academy Award nominations. He took home the Oscar for Cleopatra (1934). After shooting Jeopardy (1953), he retired.\n\n\n\nHe died on October 29, 1972.\n\n\n\nThis shot was taken during production of The Apostle of Vengeance (Ince-Triangle-KayBee, 1916). August stands beside the Bell & Howell camera. Front row, from left, are Dick Rush, star-director William S. Hart and assistant director Cliff Smith. Directly behind Hart is prop specialist \u201cDoc\u201d Cherry. The name of the fellow in the checkered cap is unknown.\n\nJoseph H. August\n\nKnown for his outdoor cinematography, Joe August was born on April 26, 1890, in Idaho Springs, Colorado, and grew up in ranch country. He gave up wrangling to began his film career as a cowboy at the Inceville motion-picture ranch in 1911, later becoming an assistant to cinematographer Ray Smallwood, a stern mentor who taught Joe to rely on his eyes. \u201cThere was a device\u2026 known as the \u2018illumination system\u2019\u2026 designed to obtain for the cameraman something parallel to what a meter would provide today,\u201d August recalled in 1939. \u201cI was told with considerable detail and even more emphasis just what fate would befall me if he ever found me fussing with one of those gadgets.\u201d\n\n\n\nAugust shot his first film, The Lure of the Violin, in 1912 and became chief cinematographer for Western star William S. Hart in 1915. He would shoot more than 40 of Hart's films, including Hell\u2019s Hinges (1916), The Toll Gate (1920) and Hart\u2019s swan song, Tumbleweeds (1925). August bragged that he never used a foreground reflector when working with Hart \u2014 though he sometimes utilized a white bed sheet to provide fill.\n\n\n\nThe first documented appearance of the ASC credential in a film\u2019s titles was Sand(1920), produced by and starring Hart, written and directed by Lambert Hillyer and shot by August.\n\n\n\nAfter Hart\u2019s first retirement in 1921, August went to work for the Fox Film Corporation, where he did his first work with director John Ford on Lightnin\u2019 (1925). August\u2019s association with Ford would lead to shooting The Informer (1935).\n\n\n\nShooting The Informer (1935) are director John Ford (left of camera) and August (right of camera) and crew.\n\nAlthough acclaimed for his outdoor work, August was also known for his low-key lighting \u2014 a technique developed through necessity as lamps were a luxury and not terribly efficient in his early days behind the camera. With pictures including A Damsel in Distress (1937), The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939) and The Devil and Daniel Webster (1941) at RKO to his credit, August remained one of Hollywood\u2019s top cinematographers, but he continued to rely on the principles he learned in the Silent Era. \u201cMany things have changed during the rise and development of the picturemaking industry,\u201d said August shortly after completing Gunga Din (1939), \u201cbut the basis of lighting seems to be about the same as it was in the beginning.\u201d He earned an Academy Award nomination for this picture.\n\n\n\nDuring World War II, August served with Ford\u2019s OSS film unit, which was attached two the U.S. Navy in the Pacific Theater. He was wounded while shooting the Oscar-winning documentary short The Battle of Midway (1942).\n\n\n\nAugust\u2019s final assignment was the lush romantic fantasy Portrait of Jennie (1948), directed by William Dieterle, for which he earned his second Academy Award nomination. The film was nearing completion at the Selznick International Studio in Culver City when the cinematographer collapsed and died of a heart attack on September 25, 1947.\n\n\n\nArthur Edeson\n\nThis cinematographer\u2019s credits include some of the best remembered films of all time: The Maltese Falcon (1941), Casablanca (1943), Frankenstein (1931), The Invisible Man (1933) and Mutiny on the Bounty (1935).\n\n\n\nBorn in New York City on October 24, 1891, Edeson was barely making a living as a portrait photographer in 1910 when he decided to try his hand at the movies. \u201cI went to the old Eclair Studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey, and applied for a job. While I was waiting in the outer office, a man came in and stabbed his finger around the crowded room, saying: \u2018I\u2019ll take you \u2014 and you, and you. Come with me.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t tell whether or not I was one of those selected, but I joined the group anyway. Once inside the mysterious recesses of the studio, I found I\u2019d been hired \u2014 as an actor.\u201d\n\n\n\nA Warner Bros. press release noted that Edeson never got over the habit of operating his own camera as he did in the Silent Era, and he would often step in and act as his own operator even though camera union rules frowned on the practice.\n\nEdeson never lost his interest in photography and began to shoot portraits of his fellow actors. His photos caught the attention of cinematographer John Van den Broeck, and when a cameraperson was taken ill, Van den Broeck suggested that Edeson fill in. \u201cIn those times, flat lighting was the rule of the day,\u201d Edeson wrote. \u201cHowever, I began to introduce some of the lighting ideas I had learned in my portrait work \u2014 a suggestion of modeling here, an artistically placed shadow there \u2014 and soon my efforts tended to show a softer, portrait-like quality on the motion picture screen. This was so completely out of line with what was considered \u2018good cinematography\u2019 in those days that I had to use my best salesmanship to convince everyone it was good camerawork.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen American Eclair was reorganized as the World Film Corporation, Edeson stayed on to become chief cinematographer for the star Clara Kimball Young, and when she left for California in 1917, Edeson followed. In 1920, Douglas Fairbanks saw For the Soul of Rafael, one of Edeson\u2019s films for Young, and signed the cinematographer for three of his biggest pictures \u2014 The Three Musketeers (1921), Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood (1922) and The Thief of Bagdad (1924). Of Fairbanks, Edeson would say, \u201cTo anyone who worked with him, moviemaking today seems prosaic and cramped by comparison.\u201d\n\n\n\nEdeson frames up on Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman during the production of Casablanca (1943).\n\nAmong Edeson credits in the 1920s were Stella Dallas, The Lost World (both 1925) and the atmospheric old-dark-house thriller The Bat (1926). At Fox, Edeson shot the first all-outdoor, 100-percent talkie, In Old Arizona (1929), and the first Fox Grandeur 70mm film, The Big Trail (1930). He later worked at Universal and MGM, and eventually settled in at Warner Bros., where he would remain until his 1949 retirement.\n\n\n\nHe died on February 14, 1970, in Agoura Hills, California.\n\n\n\nSid Jordan takes aim to shoot the knot off Tom Mix\u2019s four-in-hand using live ammunition for a scene in The Coming of the Law (Fox, 1919). From left are camera assistant Dan Clark (just visible at edge of photo), Granville at the Bell & Howell 2709 camera, director Arthur Rosson (with outstretched hand), Sol Wurtzel, a Fox studio executive (wearing glasses, standing behind Rosson) and assistant director Richard Rosson (kneeling).\n\nFred LeRoy Granville\n\nBorn Warnambool, Victoria, Australia, in 1896, Granville was educated in New Zealand. The February 1, 1922, issue of American Cinematographer stated that he was \u201ca bloody Britisher by birth,\u201d and \u201cfirst saw the light at Worton Hall, Isleworth, Middlesex, England.\u201d\n\n\n\nFred LeRoy Granville\n\nGranville became interested in photography as a boy. His first experience with cinematography came in 1913 under the guidance of James Crosby at the Selig Polyscope studio in Edendale, near downtown Los Angeles. Granville photographed the documentary Rescue of the Stefansson Expedition (1914) and a number of features and serials for Universal, including Liberty \u2014 A Daughter of the U.S.A. (1916) and The Heart of Humanity (1918). He also shot several of cowboy actor Tom Mix\u2019s early Fox features.\n\n\n\nIn 1920, Granville went to England, where he worked as a cinematographer and director into the mid 1920s.\n\n\n\nGranville died in London on November 14, 1932, from complications related to Bright's disease.\n\n\n\nOf note, camera assistant Clark (seen in the photo above) would later become Mix\u2019s lead cinematographer and close friend, and an ASC member.\n\n\n\nBarely visible cranking his Bell & Howell 2709 camera is J. Devereaux Jennings. This scene for College (Keaton-United Artists, 1927) was filmed at the corner of Seward Street and Waring Avenue in Hollywood. Buster Keaton finds himself standing in the rain, but in sunny California the cloudburst is supplied by overhead pipes supported by makeshift stilts, supplemented by a fire hose.\n\n\u201cDev\u201d Jennings in 1914.\n\nJoseph Devereaux Jennings\n\nOne of the founders of the ASC, Jennings remained active in the motion-picture industry until his death.\n\n\n\nHe was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, on September 22, 1884, and graduated from the University of Utah. His film career began around 1913, after his family moved to Los Angeles, and his earliest confirmed credits are with Thomas H. Ince\u2019s unit of the New York Motion Picture Corporation.\n\n\n\nJennings was an early member of the Static Club, and by contemporary accounts, was a gregarious guy. In its February 20, 1915, issue, the society\u2019s magazine, Static Flashes, called him \u201cthe entertaining cameraman\u2026 Mr. Jennings is one of the active and popular cinematographers who believes in the future of the cameraman, and he is ever alert and responsive to the wishes of his director, aiding in the best of his ability in securing proper photographic results, and always appearing with a cheerful smile.\u201d\n\n\n\nHis 1918 draft registration card reveals what could be a serious problem for a cameraman. Jennings was partially blind in his right eye, probably caused by an accident that occurred when he was seven years old and had been playing with gunpowder and matches. In the explosion, he was badly burned and it was feared that he might lose one of his eyes. But this physical disability doesn\u2019t seem to have hindered either his career or reputation as an outstanding cameraman.\n\n\n\nJennings later worked for Fox, photographing Fame and Fortune (1918) and The Daredevil (1920) and other early Tom Mix features.\n\n\n\nIn the mid-1920s he shot several of Buster Keaton\u2019s best-known comedies, including Battling Butler, The General, College and Steamboat Bill, Jr.\n\n\n\nJennings in the 1950s.\n\nFollowing the untimely death of his wife Adele in 1928, Jennings became a director of photography under contract at Warner Brothers. While there, he shot 14 films, including Vamping Venus and The Public Enemy, as well as the early two-color Technicolor extravaganzas Bride of the Regiment and Golden Dawn. But as the 1930s wore on, he began to concentrate on special effects work \u2014 which he had dabbled in since The Lost World (1925) \u2014 finally settling in at Paramount, where his brother H. Gordon Jennings, ASC was the head of the effects department.\n\n\n\nThey shared an Honorary Award from The Academy for their outstanding work in Spawn of the North (1938), and later an Academy Award nomination for their work in Unconquered (1947).\n\n\n\n\n\nJ.D. Jennings, also known to be a fine golfer, died of cancer in his brother's home on March 12, 1952.\n\n\n\nFrom left, director Wallace Worsley, Newhard and an unidentified second cameraperson prepare to shoot a scene for Universal\u2019s The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923), starring Lon Chaney.\n\nRobert S. Newhard\n\nAs early as 1922, Newhard was noted as being \u201cone of the greatest aerial cinematographers in the world,\u201d and it\u2019s not surprising that he eventually found his niche in the industry as a specialized cameraperson in this arena.\n\n\n\nHe was born in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on April 28, 1884, and began his film career working with Fred Balshofer\u2019s Bison Life Motion Pictures unit of the New York Motion Picture Company in 1910. He stayed with the N.Y.M.P.Co. when Thomas Ince took over production reins and was behind the camera on several early William S. Hart Westerns, including The Bargain (1914) and On the Night Stage (1915).\n\n\n\nAfter a five-year stint with Ince, Newhard worked three years at Paralta Plays, Inc. and followed this engagement with tenures at Fox and Goldwyn.\n\n\n\nHis last major credit was on Universal\u2019s The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923), although star Lon Chaney insisted that Virgil Miller, ASC photograph all of his closeups on that film. Newhard would receive first cinematographer credit on a handful of other films, ending with his only talkie, Party Girl (1930).\n\n\n\nBy 1933, the ASC membership roster carried Newhard\u2019s name under the category of Second Cinematographers.\n\n\n\nHe died in Los Angeles on May 20, 1945, from the effects of bladder cancer.\n\n\n\nOn the big glass stage at the American Film Company studio in Santa Barbara making Immediate Lee (American-Mutual, 1916), Wilky peers through the range finder of his Bell & Howell camera as actor-director Frank Borzage (with hand on tripod) and assistant director Park Frame (with arms crossed) watch a rehearsal.\n\nL. Guy Wilky\n\nHis stalwart stand for collective bargaining brought a sudden end to Wilky\u2019s career as a director of photography. He was born in Phoenix, Arizona, on October 12, 1888, and developed an interest in photography at the age of 10. After his junior year at the University of Arizona, Wilky took a job with the Philadelphia-based Lubin Mfg. Company\u2019s southwest unit in Tucson during the summer of 1912. \u201cI went back to the University to get my B. S. in mining engineering,\u201d Wilky recalled, \u201cand after graduating I joined Lubin again in Silver City, New Mexico. The director, Romaine Fielding, was having trouble with his cameraman and told me to learn as soon as possible so I could take over the job. We soon moved to Las Vegas, New Mexico, and it was there that I made my first picture, The Rattle Snake, in August 1913.\u201d\n\n\n\nWilky left Lubin in October of 1915 and went to California, where he worked briefly for Universal and then took a job with the American Film Company in Santa Barbara, where he worked with fledgling director Frank Borzage. \u201cI was with American about a year. Then eight companies were canceled one week because of [World War I]\u2026 and the Borzage company was one of them. I didn\u2019t get work again until January 1917 when I went to work for the Thomas Ince Company. I changed from one studio to another and finally got to Paramount, where I spent the best years of my career working with William C. and Cecil B. DeMille.\u201d\n\n\n\nWilky was a member of the original Static Club, but dissatisfied with that organization: \u201cIt was just a social club without much interest in education. So a few of us\u2026 met at the home of one of the fellows and talked over the idea of a new and better club\u2026 that was the start of the ASC.\u201d\n\n\n\nWilky was active in attempting to organize the International Photographers Union in the late 1920s, and his efforts led the major studios to blacklist him. After seven years at Paramount, his last credits as principal cinematographer were on a pair of low-budget pictures for Tiffany-Stahl in 1928.\n\n\n\nHe traveled to the south seas as second cameraperson on the classic Tabu, and later shot a film in Sri Lanka. But in Hollywood, he was relegated to working second camera on six-day \u201coaters,\u201d and forced to give up his ASC membership because he could no longer afford the dues. He finally returned to the studios \u2014 and the ASC \u2014 as a second-unit cinematographer and assistant, finishing his career at Columbia in the 1950s.\n\n\n\nWhen he received a 50-year membership pin at the ASC\u2019s anniversary dinner in 1969, Wilky considered the token \u201cone of my prized treasures.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe died of a heart attack in Walnut Creek, California, on December 25, 1971.\n\n\n\nSpecial thanks to David Kiehn, historian for the Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum, who contributed to this document.
