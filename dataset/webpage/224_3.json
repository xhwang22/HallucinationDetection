As noted in their book, NOFX: The Hepatitis Bathtub and Other Stories, the band scraped up $675 to record the album, and Gurewitz offered to release it on Epitaph. But the band wanted to launch their own label.\n\nPlus, NOFX themselves admit the album is awful. Lead singer Fat Mike considers the band's second album, 1989's S&M Airlines, to be their real first album and notes that NOFX was \"sounding, performing and behaving like sh*t\" prior to that. In fact, he says that the band had to rebuild their reputation from scratch with their second album because they had such a reputation for being terrible.\n\nIt's not just self-deprecation, either. Ron DePasquale at Allmusic.com says of the album, \"the sound is very raw and loose; the lyrics are slightly humorous at best and sophomoric at worst\" and speculates that the band just wasn't ready for the opportunity. After trying to sell the album on their own and failing miserably, NOFX sold the album to Epitaph after all, but it remains an album for dedicated fans only."}, {"url": "https://genius.com/artists/Nofx", "page_content": "About NOFX\n\nTake the melody of The Descendents, some of Bad Religion\u2019s political sense, add a handful of pills and there\u2019s NOFX.\n\nScrewing up since 1983, the Californian group is one of the most influential bands in the history of punk rock.

Not the best song on the album, but shows their talent for writing killer album-openers, this time with a absolutely mental wailing solo.\n\n\n\n#2: THE MORON BROTHERS\n\nA song about two dumb thugs, strangely catchy, with a nice breakdown of \"do-do-do's\" in the middle, and the anthemic chorus really adds to the effect. One of the better songs on the album.\n\n\n\n#3: SHOWERDAYS\n\nThe albums first really big stand-out track (ok, so I heard it before I bought the album!), which caught my listening mainly due to the lightning fast bass intro. A joyous ode to hating showers and generally being a grubby bastard. The riffs are reminiscent of \"The Death Of John Smith\" from \"The Longest Line\" EP, but that EP does show how much Fat Mike's voice has improved since this album. Overall a very good song, and very memorable.\n\n\n\n#4: FOOD, SEX, AND EWE\n\nThe first ska number on the album, and not a bad one, just not very memorable. Resist the initial urge to skip, and you'll find a reasonably good song.\n\n\n\n#5: JUST THE FLU\n\nAfter the release of \"The War On Errorism\" Fat Mike apparently got a lot of stick from people who thought NOFX shouldn't try to be political since they never had been before. Well these detractors should take a look at this song. Although not directly decrying any particular government, this song is a cautionary tale of the dangers of nuclear war and how it will eventually kill us all if it goes ahead. Sadly this is still a danger we face today, it seems NOFX can see into the future...\n\n\n\n#6: EL LAY\n\nA royal piss-taking of trumped up trendies from Los Angeles, this song is short and to the point, with a similar effect to short songs like \"Murder The Government\" and \"Monosyllabic Girl\". Another memorable and fantastic song.\n\n\n\n#7: NEW BOOBS\n\nThis a close contender for best song on the album. Kicking in with a great intro featuring a traditional NOFX spazzout riff, this song continues the theme of ripping it out of rich americans which started in \"El Lay\", with Fat Mike moaning \"My boobs are not as big as i want them to be, i want 36D\". Not only is this a catchy and hilarious song, it also contains a sort of album interlude at the end, which is equally funny, but i wont spoil it for you.\n\n\n\n#8: CHEESE / WHERE'S MY SLICE?\n\nTwo songs in one? Sounds good to me! \"Cheese\" is a short but pretty good song which serves as an intro to \"Where's My Slice?\" an anthemic rant at greedy bastards everywhere, and another contender for best song.\n\n\n\n#9: TOGETHER ON THE SAND\n\nIt seems El Hefe was not the only NOFX guitarist who was capable of taking lead vocals on a funny song (see \"Johnny Appleseed\"), as Izzy Drew Lynn, the lead guitarist on this album wrote and performed this song on his own. Although it sounds as un-NOFX as is imaginable, this is hilarious, and sounds like a hula-girl hawaii sorta song. Excellent!\n\n\n\n#10: NOWHERE\n\nAnother political song, written during the Cold War, and not a bad song either. Pretty standard.\n\n\n\n#11: BRAIN CONSTIPATION\n\nSomehow this song sounds really happy, despite the depressing lyrics, and is another album highlight, although not the best. Kinda reminds me of \"August 8th\" (from \"Heavy Petting Zoo\") but heavier.\n\n\n\n#12: GONOHERPASYPHILAIDS\n\nA song about the dangers of casual sex and AIDS etc. with the usual NOFX humorous twist. Good song, but again not the best.\n\n\n\n#13: I DON'T WANT YOU AROUND\n\nPossibly the best ska song NOFX have ever done; its catchy, its got brass, its got stupifyingly fast bass, and the signature ska chords. The rhythm is kinda offbeat, but it adds to the quirky effect of the song. Another contender for best song of the album, and one of the catchiest to boot.\n\n\n\n#14: THE MALACHAI CRUNCH\n\nWhat the title means, I'll never know, but this song is edgy, fast, powerful, and condemns gangs who beat up people for fun. Again, one of the best songs on the album, and a great ending track, with a great bridge section too.\n\n\n\nOverall, this isn't NOFX's best album (I'd say either \"Punk In Drublic,\" \"Heavy Petting Zoo,\" or \"So Long And Thanks For All The Shoes\"), but nevertheless, it is incredibly good, and not too long either.

The band has been fairly prolific in releasing music over almost 30 years and has maintained a high profile without ever reaching the levels achieved by bands like Green Day and the Offspring; something many view as a positive. Despite retaining a sense of humor, a love of alcohol and the occasional ridiculously themed song, in the past decade the band has grown up a bit in terms of the message it sends out through its music as well as appearing a bit more serious over a variety of events both national and global\u00e2\u0080\u0093a welcomed progression I think many would agree.\n\n\n\nFollowing on from 2009's decidedly average Coaster, Self Entitled comes out at a time when, for me anyway, the band's significance is clearly on a downward trajectory. From seeing them in the early '90s playing to 40 or so people and doing so with gusto, humor and a gung ho attitude that was a joy to behold, to seeing them play to over 1,500 people about five years ago when the humor seemed forced and the set was disjointed at best, I find myself in a position where NOFX are in danger of being consigned to the \"Just Another Band\" category.\n\n\n\nOpening with \"72 Hookers,\" it doesn't take too long here to realize that this is NOFX's cunning plan to dissuade those with a desire to inflict terror on the Western World in the name of Islam from carrying out their plans, which is done only in the hope of meeting with the fabled 72 virgins. Basically 100,000 hookers or one million whores to turn the heads of those intent on waging such are what are needed according to the band\u00e2\u0080\u0093simple! This track starts well with a very good long intro which builds nicely and once the lyrics kick in I'm at first mildly amused at the concept before being more than slightly put off by the idea of enlisting women (prostitutes/whores as described in the lyrics) to solve the problem. Yes, I know it's supposed to be entertaining but it just gets on the wrong side of my funny bone and doesn't make for an auspicious start.\n\n\n\nThe second offering, \"I Believe in Goddess,\" is a much better effort, being short, punchy and with a lyrical content that is not pushing itself to be anything other than mildly interesting and amusing. The recent single \"Ronnie and Mags\" is another let down in that it's not funny, it's not particularly relevant and it seems to be an idea that just seems superfluous in that surely there are more needy targets in today's fucked up world. For me the album finally kicks into gear with the fourth track, \"She Didn't Lose Her Baby,\" a more serious tale and one that mirrors \"My Orphan Year\" off Coaster in that it creates a sense of melancholy, something that NOFX can actually do quite well. \"Secret Society\" could easily be a Bad Religion song and is a slight move away from the more frantic pace often set by NOFX, but it does constantly make me think that perhaps Graffin and Co could do it better. However, it is one of the better tracks on the album.\n\n\n\nFrom there, \"I, Fatty\" isn't too bad and \"Cell Out\" is just \"mediocore\" but neither really do anything for me; at least with \"Down With The Ship\" Fat Mike and his crew manage to pull their heads above water for almost two and a half minutes.\n\n\n\nThe poignancy that NOFX is capable of is once again demonstrated on \"I've Got One Jealous Again, Again,\" the unfortunate follow up to \"We've Got Two Jealous Agains\" off The War on Errorism. The original song dealt with the coming together of two record collections when Fat Mike met his wife whilst the new version deals with the divorce of the couple and the subsequent separation of that one collection. It is nuggets like these that help display a less brash side of the band which I find more appealing these days. However, they are few and far between on this album and I'll no doubt create playlists including maybe five songs from Self Entitled. Despite the trademark NOFX sound remaining, there is the sense of decay here and what once seemed fresh and vibrant is now slightly stale and lackluster, with few high points to remark on. I like the style of music that NOFX play, and always have, but the quality of the content seems to be lacking and doesn't match up with previous work. I had hoped to like this record much more than I do but unfortunately that's not the case.\n\n\n\nFor me it's official then: NOFX are just another band these days.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://trouserpress.com/reviews/nofx/", "page_content": "NOFX fuses I-got-the-world-up-my-ass (think Circle Jerks) attitude, British punk-era political cynicism and a snotty vocal tenor wedged somewhere between Dead Milkmen bratcore and an air of early Social Distortion disillusion. The Hollywood-formed foursome jabs at the ill effects of capitalist society \u2014 repression, prejudice, the poor \u2014 all with an underlying sense of paranoia. But rather than stand on a soapbox, vocalist/bassist Fat Mike and crew opt for sarcasm and humor, producing a one-two punch that, on the early releases, helped distract from the music\u2019s monotony and continues to set the band apart from the power- punk pack. In recent years, with Fat Mike and guitarist Eric Melvin as the only remaining original members, the group has, to the disappointment of punk purists, become more pop-friendly.\n\nExpressing blatant distaste for \u201980s just-say-no conservatism, NOFX debuted with a 7-inch \u201cThe PMRC Can Suck on This,\u201d released on Fat Mike\u2019s own Fat Wreck Chords label. Soon after, the band put out Liberal Animation, a generally straightforward punk-paced collection produced by Brett Gurewitz (who, according to NOFX, offered to put it out on Epitaph, an offer they initially rejected and then regretted). It has a few reggae rhythms and \u201cHere Comes the Neighborhood,\u201d which mixes a slow, introspective intro and hard-rock guitar solos. The songs are a bit sloppy, but one look at the lyric sheet and cover illustration (three cows, one sporting a Dead Milkmen T-shirt, sitting at the dinner table partaking of roast human) makes it apparent the band\u2019s not very serious about its agit-prop. There are silly songs (\u201cOn the Rag,\u201d \u201cBeer Song,\u201d \u201cTruck Stop Blues\u201d and \u201cA200 Club,\u201d about crabs) and digs at non-carnivores. \u201cVegetarian Mumbo Jumbo\u201d asks \u201cWhy should I be sad about cows getting hit in the head\u2026It\u2019s survival of the fittest and we\u2019re winning.\u201d The band does offer up a bit more insight with the anti-politics stance of \u201cFree Dumb\u201d and the focus on hypocrisy in the lifestyle of peace punks in \u201cPiece.\u201d The main feat here is that Fat Mike pulls off stupid and sarcastic equally well.\n\nS&M Airlines maintains the breakneck speed but expands the band\u2019s stylistic repertoire with more prominent guitar solos and ska/dub grooves. Parts of the amusing \u201cProfessional Crastination\u201d recall the beginning of Iggy\u2019s \u201cThe Passenger,\u201d though the song quickly jumps to hyperspeed and then back to the reggaefied breaks; \u201cLife O\u2019Riley\u201d also toggles between ska and fast punk. Many of the lyrics again poke fun at American society \u2014 \u201cJaundiced Eye\u201d supports minority pride \u2014 but the band is no less prone to spouting un-PC humor. \u201cYou Drink, You Drive, You Spill\u201d puts a twist on the statistic that 35 percent of auto deaths are alcohol-related. \u201cThe other 65-percent are not alcohol-related/What does this tell us about the drunk drivers/They seem to have a better record than the sober team.\u201d\n\nRibbed continues the lyrical levity in \u201cMoron Brothers\u201d \u201cFood, Sex and Ewe\u201d and \u201cShower Days.\u201d \u201cNew Boobs\u201d is a funny take on silicone society and an example of the band\u2019s broadening style: the song devolves into a Sha Na Na-like \u201950s parody. NOFX even offers up its first ballad, \u201cTogether in the Sand,\u201d penned by short-term guitarist Izzy Drew Lynn. Mike doesn\u2019t alter his bratty delivery, but the record\u2019s increased use of harmonies would become permanent.\n\nIt\u2019s on The Longest Line \u2014 which introduces new guitarist, singer and trumpet-player El Hefe \u2014 that the NOFX sound really comes together and spreads apart. On \u201cKill All the White Man,\u201d NOFX takes its affinity for reggae one stop further by imitating the form\u2019s vocal style. Though the band is serious about its anti-racist stance on that cut, the \u201cBatman\u201d-like chorus of \u201cwhite man\u201d lightens the touch. On the title track, you can taste their soured view of life; \u201cThe Death of John Smith\u201d offers further commentary on the void in middle-class America.\n\nWhite Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean adds poppier melodies, softening the edge but not the attitude. A guide to creating formulaic hits (\u201cPlease Play This Song on the Radio\u201d) sticks in a slew of curses just to mess with DJs. Tracks that dive into untested waters serve to break up the more predictable fare: a jazzed-up cover of Minor Threat\u2019s \u201cStraight Edge\u201d complete with Louis Armstrong-style vocals, the Al Jolson-era ditty \u201cBuggley Eyes,\u201d the \u201cOi!\u201d chants and ska beats of \u201cBob.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s not much change in Punk in Drublic. The pace is still brisk; most of the songs hold to the standard Offspring/Green Day style. The highlights are the jokes: \u201cThe Brews\u201d is a takeoff on typical Oi skinhead sound with lyrics that would make a rabbi proud, \u201cMy Heart Is Yearning\u201d is an operatic vocal parody. As far as that Top 40 punk style, the sound works best on \u201cThe Quass,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Call Me White\u201d and \u201cPunk Guy,\u201d where the band brings back some of the old British flavor.\n\nAnnouncing that \u201cNOFX are: same as last album but older and fatter,\u201d Heavy Petting Zoo continues the band\u2019s crude and catchy socio-political-sexual analysis in Weezer-tight pop blurts like \u201cHobophobic (Scared of Bums),\u201d \u201cBleeding Heart Disease\u201d and the weight-conscious \u201cHot Dog in a Hallway.\u201d Fat Mike revels in his Howard Stern-like sensibilities: \u201cThe Black and White\u201d attempts to settle the feminist anti-pornography movement with the predictable \u201cI think they need a good hard fuck,\u201d \u201cFreedom Lika Shopping Cart\u201d accuses the homeless of chronic irresponsibility and \u201cRelease the Hostages\u201d tastefully praises Johnnie Walker Red for \u201ckeep[ing] my insides warm like a cunt.\u201d Musically unassailable and lyrically unforgivable (but with an impressively principled printed nose-thumb at TV, major labels and commercial radio), Heavy Petting Zoo is a punk album in spirit if not always in sound.\n\nThe brilliantly titled I Heard They Suck Live, recorded in early \u201995 at a Hollywood club, contains solid, straightforward live versions of songs from each of the band\u2019s prior releases plus a cover of Rudimentary Peni\u2019s \u201cNothing but a Nightmare.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/12224/NOFX-SM-Airlines/", "page_content": "NOFX\n\nS&M Airlines\n\n3.5\n\ngreat Review by pogostick1 USER (10 Reviews)\n\nMay 31st, 2007 | 10 replies by\n\nRelease Date: 1989 | Tracklist Review Summary: A good buy, but not the the classic NOFX sound of the 90's, it is surprisingly influenced by metal, and there are few great songs. However, it's essential for any NOFX fan looking to see how they developed as a band.\n\nThis was NOFX\u2019s 2nd album, released in 1989, (Liberal Animation was originally released before this, but then re-released in 1991 on Epitaph). It is 12 tracks long, although one of them is a cover of a Fleetwood Mac song, and the album is under 34 minutes long.\n\n\n\nThis album is just the beginning, it is part of the start of NOFX\u2019s career, and that is reflected in the change of the music they play in terms of hooks, - there are not that many to be found on this album, although in NOFX\u2019s later years there are hooks a-plenty. Lyrically as well, this album is not too strong, although we do see the wicked brand of NOFX humour displayed here, in songs such as \u201cYou Drink You Drive You Spill\u201d among others.\n\n\n\nNOFX here use lots of metal influenced guitar riffs, far more than on most of their other albums, and this album is far more hardcore / metal influenced than the later works which in turn took a ska and pop feel to them. Examples of this are \u201cFive Feet Under\u201d and \u201cScream for Change\u201d . The former of these has fast, sharp guitar riffs, which to my mind are similar to Metallica; the guitar riffs, not the song as a whole. Infact, it would not be too far astray from the mark to describe this album as a strange Metallica-Offspring hybrid, although far more of the latter than the former. The latter is metallic too, but less so, and has a bizarre interlude partway through the song, which some will find amusing.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou Drink You Drive You Spill\u201d and \u201cDrug Free America\u201d both are typical NOFX humour, the former talking about the perils of drink driving from a unique perspective \u2013 how much beer is spilt (I\u2019m not so worried about how many I kill / I\u2019m much more concerned with how much beer I spill), and the second song encourages people to give up drugs, albeit with the sly motive of only using free ones, in a cry for lower drug prices. The first song however, musically, could have come off of a later NOFX album, but the 2nd has far more foreboding, metallic riffs at the beginning and a longer intro than most punk songs have. At 3:43 minutes it\u2019s also quite long for a punk song, and certainly for a NOFX song, bearing in mind \u201cThe Decline\u201d was a long way in the future.\n\n\n\n\u201cVanilla Sex\u201d is a (more nasal than normal) cry for less state intrusion and more privacy, and again could have come off of a more recent record, as could possibly \u201cProfessional Crastination\u201d, which is an explanation of the band, and many of its fans, and also, many of the people in the world who are NOT fans of the band\u2019s ability to waste time. This melds the two NOFX\u2019s together, because you can still taste the metal influence here, although halfway through, the song slows down and you can see the modern day NOFX\u2019s roots here, in the steady slow down and build up of sound. There is even debatably, a lick of ska in this slowed down part, and it\u2019s one of the best songs here.\n\n\n\n\u201cMean People Suck\u201d is a song that whilst true in its nature (mean people DO suck) is not a great song here, and the whole first half is an intro. The song only starts its lyrics at the halfway mark, and even then, the lyrics are underdeveloped, informing the listener, unsurprisingly, that \u201cmean people suck\u201d. \u201cDay to Daze\u201d is a track that whilst engaging lyrically and musically will never feature in any NOFX fans wish list for a live show, because its an average number in comparison to most of their songs.\n\n\n\n\u201cJaundiced Eye\u201d lyrically is the best track on the album (excluding the amusing \u201cYou Drink...\u201d, condemning racism and fascism alike, and has an occasional jaunty riff, but is not a brilliant song for the music. The title track \u201cS&M Airlines\u201d is amusing in the lyrics department, but the music doesn\u2019t fit with it so well, almost as if NOFX hadn\u2019t discovered how to pair funny songs with equally funny music, and were forced to put this with the harder style music. The cover of Fleetwood Mac\u2019s song \u201cGo Your Own Way\u201d is punk-messy, and sprawled everywhere, but that is NOFX adding their own style to the track, and it is useful because it adds some much needed melody to the proceedings, for a punk album to go with the riffage.\n\n\n\nThe album is difficult to categorise, because it doesn\u2019t sit happily in the punk category, and has metal influences, although it would be frankly ridiculous to label it metal.

It is 12 tracks long, although one of them is a cover of a Fleetwood Mac song, and the album is under 34 minutes long.This album is just the beginning, it is part of the start of NOFX\u2019s career, and that is reflected in the change of the music they play in terms of hooks, - there are not that many to be found on this album, although in NOFX\u2019s later years there are hooks a-plenty. Lyrically as well, this album is not too strong, although we do see the wicked brand of NOFX humour displayed here, in songs such asamong others.NOFX here use lots of metal influenced guitar riffs, far more than on most of their other albums, and this album is far more hardcore / metal influenced than the later works which in turn took a ska and pop feel to them. Examples of this areand. The former of these has fast, sharp guitar riffs, which to my mind are similar to Metallica; the guitar riffs, not the song as a whole. Infact, it would not be too far astray from the mark to describe this album as a strange Metallica-Offspring hybrid, although far more of the latter than the former. The latter is metallic too, but less so, and has a bizarre interlude partway through the song, which some will find amusing.andboth are typical NOFX humour, the former talking about the perils of drink driving from a unique perspective \u2013 how much beer is spilt (I\u2019m not so worried about how many I kill / I\u2019m much more concerned with how much beer I spill), and the second song encourages people to give up drugs, albeit with the sly motive of only using free ones, in a cry for lower drug prices. The first song however, musically, could have come off of a later NOFX album, but the 2nd has far more foreboding, metallic riffs at the beginning and a longer intro than most punk songs have. At 3:43 minutes it\u2019s also quite long for a punk song, and certainly for a NOFX song, bearing in mind \u201cThe Decline\u201d was a long way in the future.is a (more nasal than normal) cry for less state intrusion and more privacy, and again could have come off of a more recent record, as could possibly, which is an explanation of the band, and many of its fans, and also, many of the people in the world who are NOT fans of the band\u2019s ability to waste time.

I was dissapointed to see that it had the same over-polished and clean sound as their last two CDs, but that's the case with most Fat Wreck CDs. Some of the songs also sounded all too similar to other NOFX songs. But that aside, this is still a pretty good CD, if you know what to expect from NOFX. The lyrics are probably the best NOFX has put out in a while on this CD, and also the most political. It was a nice change to hear songs actually about things that matter, not clams and vaginas. There are still some stupid and humorous songs, but they are few and far between. Anyways, here's a song breakdown(I've bolded the standout tracks):\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Seperation Of Church and Skate - Great song. Probably the best on the CD. I love the guitars on this song, they blend ing with each other with much awsomeness. The screaming vocals by Melvin and Mike in the chorus are awsome, too.\n\n\n\nThe Irrationality Of Rationality - Very average song. Typical fast pounding drums with some melodic singing. The guitar sounds very similar to another NOFX song, though I forget which one right now..\n\n\n\nFranco Un-American - I don't really like this song. It sounds really clean and poppy. It is catchy, but that doesn't stop me from disliking it. (Also, the chorus sound waaaaay to similar to Quart In Session)\n\n\n\nIdiots Are Taking Over - Great song. I thought it was really average at first, but it grew on me. Fast pace, some of the best lyrics on the CD, and an awsome bassline. The ska part in the middle is great.\n\n\n\nShes Nubs - This song has its moments, but then gets ruined with its sillyness. Mikes voice in the beginning(and a few other parts of the song) sounds really stupid and childish, and the \"slipping on the bannana peel\" sound effect doesn't help.\n\n\n\nMattersville - This song was already released before WOE, so you might have alright heard it. Some love it, some hate it. I don't like it that much. Again, very average.\n\n\n\nDecom-poseur - The third of the great songs on the CD, and one of the heavier ones, too. Great Hefe solo in the middle, too.\n\n\n\nMedio-core -Probably the most unique song on the CD. It is a good song, but it just doesn't float my boat. Still, most people love it. There's some awsome transitions in the song, and it does stray from the usual NOFX song-style, so I give them props for that.\n\n\n\nAnarchy Camp - I hate this song. I like ska and all, but this is one boring ska song. Is it even ska? I dunno, all I know is that I hate it. Infact, maybe I'll burn this song to a disc, and then smash the disc with a hammer. Yes, it's that bad.\n\n\n\nAmerican Errorist (I Hate Hate Haters) - Fast paced, nice solo, good lyrics. Great song. I don't know what else to say.\n\n\n\nWe Got Two Jelous Agains - Great blend of melody and heavyness(..? Sorry, I can't think of any other word right now -_-). A good song. I think it's a love song, but I don't even know. Judge for yourself.\n\n\n\n13 Stitches - One of the slower songs, but definitely better than Anarchy Camp. It's pretty straight-forward, but the less polished sound and trumpet makes it all the better.\n\n\n\nRe-gaining Unconsciousness - Again, a pretty straight-forward song, almost boring, but not quite. The lyrics make it worthwhile. Sounds like it was made as more of a rant than anything.\n\n\n\nWhoops, I OD'd - Failed attempt at an emotional/love song.\n\n\n\nOverall Rating : 6/10\n\n\n\nTweet\n\nThis CD isn't anything new, so don't go into it expecting anything revolutionary and defining.

You can tell that melvin and hefe have killer chops on the guitar, but don't show them off as often as they probably should. I love when Mike and Melvin switch vocals the way they did in the decline. Also, there was a third singer near the end... maybe. Still not sure, but it didn't really sound like either Mike or Melvin, and I have certain theories that it could be Eric the drummer. Great song though, and amazing riffs on the outro.\n\n\n\nirrationality of rationality:\n\n\n\nI like Mike's tone in the intro. It's so smooth, and flows good. Hefe and Melvin have a real talent for playing power chords all over the fretboard, without having to resort to dropped tuning like a lot of nu metals do. A cool cello part that does a good job of breaking the song up a bit, so it's not too boring.The lyrics are ok, but seem a little bit off. I love the \"and the shareholders were on the bed, legs in air, asscheeks opened wide.. they were about to get fuc[/i]ked like it was their first time\" part. Good song, but not great.\n\n\n\nFranco Unamerican:\n\n\n\nI love this song. It's as poppy as hell, but nofx can bust out poppy tunes like no other, so there's no reason not to. The synth is fun. The lyrics are great in some parts, but misinformed in others. A very enjoyable song though. Simple, but still takes great song writing talent to produce.\n\n\n\nidiots are tkaing over:\n\n\n\nthis song has to be given time to grow on you. It's kind of bland the first few times you hear it, but then it suddenly gets really catchy. The bass line is very Fat Mikish, heh. Not many people can do what he does, and he does it well. The ska part is great, and totally necessary, otherwise the rest of the song would be too repetitive. Best lyrics on the cd.\n\n\n\nshe's nubs:\n\n\n\nI fell in love with this song. It's so goofy and fun. The vocals at the start sound like adam sandler, but meh. From the fast palm muted chords, to the blazing lead part, this song kicks as[i]s. And holy shi[i][/i]t!! the way they take turns with the chorus is so cool.\n\n\n\nmattersville:\n\n\n\nI fell in love with this song since I first heard it on the fat compilation. Nofx is great for being so fast and heavy, while still taking the time to break out the xylophone for a song once in awhile. Also, this songs shows how Mike has a talent for coming up with chord progressions that really shouldn't make sense, but still sound good. Not sure who plays the guitar in the verses, but that's talent right there. Nofx sometimes uses an excessive amount of talent to come up with the simplest soudning songs. There's also a trombone on this song, but you can't hear it.\n\n\n\nmediocre:\n\n\n\nI can't believe how good this song is. I guess you either love it or don't, but I love it. Great basslines, great use of chromatics, great transitions, and the lyrics fit perfectly. It's ironic, but as soon as Fat Mike say \"predictability...\" I knew exactly what was about to come. And man, it rocks like no other. The outro is great too with the tuba, and the little melody. Best song on the cd I think.\n\n\n\ndecomposeur:\n\n\n\ncool riff at the start. Nice use of time sig switchage. I love the bass tone, and how it sounds with just the drums. The solo is really cool, and I like how the second guitar decends through the octave chords with the bass plays the progression. Great lyrics, and a great unique sound.\n\n\n\nanarchy camp:\n\n\n\nlots of people don't like it. I love it. Cool lyrics, and a good happy feeling. The saxophone is cool.\n\n\n\nthen the albums goes downhill\n\n\n\namerican errorist (I hate hate haters):\n\n\n\nthis is an ok song. I love the intro with the muted guitars and the bass and everything, but I just think this is a bland song.\n\n\n\nwe got two jealous agains:\n\n\n\nsome really catchy parts. Some funny lyrics. It's an ok song, but not all that good. It's sort of bland, and relies on it's speed to be qualified as a decent song.\n\n\n\n13 stitches:\n\n\n\nreally catchy. really weird quality to it. The trumpet part is really cool. A very unique song. It would have been horribly average if it wasn't for the unique high-mid-low-bass-low-treble-old-time-radio-bad-quality production to it.\n\n\n\nregaining consciouness:\n\n\n\ngreat lyrics; bad song. It just doesn't have anything that appeals to the listener.\n\n\n\nwhoops I OD'd:\n\n\n\nI might be biased, but I love this long. It's really cool how it's just bass and vocals. Fat Mike shows how his great song writing ability can stand up on it's own, without any speed or distorted guitars to back it up.\n\n\n\noverall, it's a great album. Very different from nofx' ususal style, but still has that standard nofx sound to it. On the first few listens it might seem bland and boring, but once you get used to it, you can appreciate it for how good it really is.\n\n\n\n9/10\n\n\n\n\n\ncds alright its good unlike other bands who are releasing new and crappy albums but my favourite cd of theires will always be punk in drublic still war on errorism was a 7/10 for me good job NOFX\n\n\n\n\n\ni love this album!!! NOFX... the best band ever. 8/10\n\n\n\n\n\nI really like this album. Anarchy Camp is one the koolest song ive ever heard.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is better NOFX cd's.. But I like this one, too. The high points on the cd for me are: Seperation of Church and Skate, Anarchy Camp, American Errorist.\n\n\n\nNice review :thumb:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis album is one I really enjoy. A few weak moments but I would tip towards Fattys review. 7.5/10\n\n\n\n\n\nI love this album. I was hoping it would be along the lines of \"Punk In Drublic\", but still, this album is great!\n\n\n\nI agree completely with Fattymattk's review. :thumb:\n\n\n\n\n\ni will give this cd 2/5 i didnt like it too well and i thought that their old stuff was a lot better...but i will tell u what is a new and good song \"idiot son of an asshole\" if u have never heard this song u should go download this song right now!! it is about how the lead singer of NOFX hates our prez and our govt. sooo much\n\n\n\n\n\nI love Nofx, they are one of my favorite bands, and one of the first Punk bands I started listening to, but this cd is so contridictinal (sp?) that it is kind of lame. It seems like in most songs, they poke fun at Good Charlotte, but I know that in real life, they are friends. And making fun of Pop-Punk, yet all the riffs on that cd are Pop-Punk. I still really all the songs on this cd though, so it gets a 4/5.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Oh yea, it also really bothered me that almost NONE of the lyrics ever rhymed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not one of my favorite NOFX albums. Not near as good as some of their other ones. Anyways, great job on the review. :thumb:\n\n\n\n\n\ndidnt like the CD that much\n\ngood review though\n\n\n\n\n\nI've heard \"Separation of...\" on the \"Tony Hawk's Underground\" soundtrack. Although I haven't heard the rest of this album, I'm still willing to bet that it's one of the better songs, because it's good.\n\n\n\nAlbum Rating: 4.0\n\n\n\nIt is an alright album. Not my favorite, but it has highs and lows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy favs:\n\n\n\nSeparation Of Church and Skate\n\n\n\nFranco Un-American\n\n\n\nMedio-Core\n\n\n\nShes Nubs\n\n\n\n\n\n9/10\n\n\n\nlove it - what more can i say?\n\n\n\n\n\nGood album, althought they've definately done better. Highlights are Separation of church and skate, mattersville, franco un-american, medio-core, anarchy camp. Good review fatmattk\n\n\n\n\n\nA lot of good stuff on this album. I have to say, I have a bias for this album being the first album i bought but i find some of the older stuff a little better. Seperation of Church and Skate is a great song, the fact that they bring in each instrument in a nice way makes it a cool song. As for Whoop's, I OD'd, It sounds a little better live, but the way Fat Mike shows that an acoustic song can be bass and vocals only makes it a nice song. All-in-all, great two reviews and i think ill agree with the 9/10 rating because there are great songs and there are ok songs, but a good album none the less.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen fattymattk talked about a third singer in seperation of church and skate, im pretty sure it is spike slawson. From the gimme gimmes and swinging utters or lagwagon (not sure which). I liked this album better than pump up the valuum. It is no where near their best though.\n\n\n\n\n\nsorry lynch the landlord, but thats el hefe. apart from the fact that you can hear who it is mike also said in AMP magaize \"I like seperation.. since me, melvin and hefe all get to sing\".\n\n\n\n\n\nI think this a great album. It's fast and fun but it also gives us a look at NOFX's views on politics.\n\n\n\nBest Songs:\n\nFranco Un-American\n\nMedio-core\n\nAmerican Errorist\n\nWhoops I Od'd\n\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nNext\n\nAdd a Comment:\n\nYou have to be logged in to post a comment.

Close this window, hop in the car, and drive to your nearest record store to pick up either Punk in Drublic or So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes. After a few listens, return back to read the rest of the review.\n\n\n\nFor the rest of you, this EP is not likely to change your opinion of the band. If you're a fan of NOFX, you will almost certainly enjoy the six songs featured on the Never Trust a Hippy EP; if you hate the band, that won't suddenly change with this release.\n\n\n\nFans of NOFX's earlier material -- dating as far back as Ribbed and White Trash... -- will be pleased to find out that most of the songs on this EP sound similar to songs recorded during that era. The only difference would be in the lyrics; instead of writing about lesbians and boobs, the majority of the songs are political in nature or are speaking out against religious extremism (although NOFX has always had political songs on all of their albums, so I really don't understand the recent backlash against some of their political lyrics).\n\n\n\nThe EP starts out with \"Seeing Double at the Triple Rock,\" a fun, midtempo song about the greatness of beer; \"I'm a religious drunk, and this is where I pray...we're praying that the taps will keep the holy water flowing.\" The song reminds me of earlier material mostly due to the lead guitar part that sounds like it came straight from White Trash.\n\n\n\n\"The Marxist Brothers\" is a slow paced, reggae-sounding song with lyrics poking fun of \"idealist bourgeoisie\" and is, what appears to be, a response to Propagandhi's diss of NOFX on their most recent album. But Propagandhi fans should not take it too seriously -- it's all in good fun, and the mood is similar to that of \"Anarchy Camp\" from The War on Errorism, so it's light-hearted.\n\n\n\nThe effort continues with \"Golden Boys,\" a song whose double-time beginning sounds very similar to the classic song \"Green Corn\" and is played in the signature NOFX style. Next up is the acoustic \"You're Wrong,\" which was also part of the 7 Inch of the Month Club. Nothing special in particular here, although the lyrics are quite bold and funny all at the same time. Ann Coulter is appropriately labeled as a \"cunted cunt\" and Fat Mike lets you know that you're wrong if you agree with Sean Hannity. NOFX has been playing this song on their latest tour, and according to Fat Mike, it will be on the new album, except it will be a full-band \"punked-out\" version.\n\n\n\nHippy closes out with \"Everything in Moderation (Especially Moderation)\" and \"I'm Going to Hell for This One.\" The former is a very basic, fast-paced NOFX song about the band's career and age: \"When your band has been a band longer than the Ramones, and critics coin you 'the punk Rolling Stones,' that's when you know this is for life.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm Going to Hell for This One\" was also on the 7 Inch of the Month Club, and is about Jesus -- well, the Jesus that NOFX believes in. They take a stab at fundamentalist Christianity and promote the belief that Jesus was a pretty cool guy...just not the person that Christians believe he was. Stylistically, this song reminds me a lot of \"The Decline,\" which is certainly a plus.\n\n\n\nOverall, this is a wonderful listen, everything from the hilarious cover art, to the lyrical content, to the classic NOFX sound we all know and love. If the new album Wolves in Wolves' Clothing sounds anything like this, then we are in for a treat.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.punknews.org/review/634/nofx-ribbed", "page_content": "\"All Nofx songs sound the same blah blah blah, they're just as stupid as Blink blah blah blah, why won't they just fucking die blah blah blah\".
