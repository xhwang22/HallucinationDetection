Skeen is a big threat in the paint and is a good three point shooter for a power forward. With a high basketball IQ and an excellent motor, it\u2019s really strange to me that Skeen\n\nwasn\u2019t drafted.\n\nJacob Pullen, Kansas State\n\nPullen was one of the NCAA\u2019s premier clutch three point shooters. And the game doesn\u2019t need to be on the line; Pullen knocks down threes all day. He prove that he could hold his own against some of college basketball\u2019s best players. We could compare Pullen not being drafted to Scottie Reynolds not being drafted last year.\n\nScotty Hopson, Tennessee\n\nAlong with the best haircut in this year's draft class, Hopson is also freakishly athletic. At 6\u20197\", Hopson has an insane 6\u201911\" wingspan. Hopson has NBA three point range and has top-notch scoring instincts. He\u2019s also an explosive leaper and would be a very fun player to watch in the NBA\u2019s dunk contests.\n\nDavid Lighty, Ohio State\n\nAfter four solid years at the Ohio State University, Light going undrafted raises many eyebrows. Lighty is a good shooter and could provide a spark off of many NBA benches. The Lakers had four second round picks, and I feel that he would have been a good choice for them.

And the reason being is that most people assumed they were going to go undrafted. Thankfully, Zeke was picked by the Kings with the 60th pick, but Silas wasn\u2019t so lucky. \u201cWell, I went undrafted,\u201d Silas tweeted after all the picks were in. \u201cAll that means is that this journey will be a bit more interesting for you and me. Quote me on this\u2026 A journey isn\u2019t a journey without a journey.\u201d You gotta love the positive outlook. So for every Kyrie Irving, there\u2019s a J.J. Barea \u2013 a guy who gets overlooked on Draft Night but makes a huge impact in the League. With that, here\u2019s are the top 10 players that didn\u2019t hear their named called last night.\n\n1. Demetri McCamey, Illinois\n\nIf the Illini had a better season, then McCamey would have been drafted. It\u2019s that easy. Now he\u2019s going to have to fight his way in. He\u2019s a legit PG with size, and I can think of at least five NBA teams that could use someone like him \u2013 most notably the Bulls. After trading Norris Cole to Miami, look for McCamey to fight for a roster spot in Chicago next season.\n\n2. David Lighty, Ohio State\n\nJust like bubble teams in the NCAA Tournament, someone\u2019s gotta be left out of the party. And last night, that someone was Lighty. As his former teammate Evan Turner tweeted, \u201cIf lighty doesnt get picked i will be sincerely pissed. 4real.\u201d I guess E.T. was pissed. You can\u2019t be mad that he wasn\u2019t drafted, but expect him to find his way in to the NBA next season.\n\n3. Scotty Hopson, Tennessee\n\nHe never quite lived up to expectations at Tennessee, has all the tools needed to be a solid NBA player. Give him some time overseas or in the D-League to get his head right \u2013 that is, if he wants to stick with basketball \u2013 and he\u2019ll find his way into training camp.\n\n4. Jereme Richmond, Illinois\n\nHe didn\u2019t have quite the freshman season that he was hoping for with the Illini, but all the talent is there. Had he stayed in school, he could have been a lottery pick next season. Now he\u2019ll have to fight to make a team. The looming lockout might actually be good for Richmond though, giving him an axe to grind and more time to work on his game.\n\n5. Matt Howard, Butler\n\nHis teammate Shelvin Mack was drafted 34th overall by the Wizards, and you know he was hoping that Howard got drafted as well. Until their back-to-back championship game runs, no one really looked at Howard as having NBA prospects. But a couple game-winners will change that. He does all the little things right, so look for a team to take a chance on him in the future.\n\n\n\n6. Jacob Pullen, Kansas State\n\nWe knew this was coming. I mean, we had Pullen pegged as the best player to go undrafted in our NBA Draft Preview in the Dime #64. But a little adversity has never stopped him from chasing his dream. Even his coach, Frank Martin, took to Twitter last night to defend his guy: \u201cI don\u2019t work for the NBA nor do I understand the NBA but I do understand winning. Look back at Jacob Pullen\u2019s record vs. the guys that got drafted. You will find that he won a lot and also had a better game from a matchup standpoint. Some people like team pictures I like winning.\u201d Enough said.\n\n7. Chris Wright, Dayton\n\nHad he come out two years ago, he would have been a lottery pick akin to Paul George. But instead, Wright graduates from school and now has go out into the real world and find a job. When we got up with him this week, he spoke specifically about his \u201chard work, effort and energy.\u201d If he\u2019s going to make it, he\u2019s going to need to continue to excel in all three areas.\n\n8. LaceDarius Dunn, Baylor\n\nDunn is another guy who probably just stayed in school too long. This season, he concluded his career as the all-time leading scorer (2,285 career points) for both Baylor and the Big 12 Conference. Not bad. You\u2019re telling me an NBA team couldn\u2019t use a guy like Dunn for instant offense off the bench? Exactly."}, {"url": "https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nba/news/ranking-the-10-best-undrafted-players-in-nba-history/1lwg2z3vtimvu1ukkget6ke1hv", "page_content": "While the NBA Draft is typically a chance for teams to land franchise-altering talents who can help shape the future of an organization, there are often players who fall through the cracks, later making people question how they were overlooked.\n\nThere are a handful of players in league history who went undrafted but grinded their way onto a roster, working their way into playing time and making a significant impact on the court.\n\nWith Ben Wallace set to become the first undrafted player in the modern draft era (1989) to enter The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on Sept. 11, who are some of the greatest undrafted players in NBA history?\n\n10. JJ Barea\n\nCollege: Northeastern\n\nCareer averages: 8.9 PTS, 3.9 AST, 2.1 REB\n\nAccolades: 2011 NBA champion\n\nBarea went undrafted out of Northeastern University in 2006 but latched on with the Dallas Mavericks shortly after and the rest was history. Playing 14 years (and possibly counting) in the NBA, Barea's career will most be remembered by his pivotal role in the Mavericks' 2011 NBA championship run over the Miami Heat's \"Big 3.\"\n\nBarea scored in double figures seven times during that playoff run, going for over 20 points twice while capping off the Finals with an exclamation point, scoring 17 points in a series-altering Game 5 before scoring 15 points in Game 6 to close out the series to win the title.\n\n9. Jose Calderon\n\nCollege: International \u2013 Spain\n\nCareer averages: 8.9 PTS, 5.8 AST, 2.9 REB, 40.7% 3PT\n\nAccolades: Retired as Raptors' all-time assists leader\n\nCalderon may not have a lengthy list of accolades, but anyone who watched him play knows the type of playmaker and sharpshooter the Spaniard guard was. He retired as the Toronto Raptors' all-time assist leader, averaging over 8.0 assists per game four times over the course of his 14-year career. He led the NBA in free throw percentage in 2008-09, making a remarkable 151 of his 154 free throw attempts (98.1 percent). He also led the league in 3-point percentage in 2012-13, converting 46.1 percent of his attempts.\n\n8. Avery Johnson\n\nCollege: Cameron University, Southern University and A&M College\n\nCareer averages: 8.4 PTS, 5.5 AST, 1.7 REB, 1.0 STL\n\nAccolades: 1999 NBA champion\n\nIt took Johnson a few years to find his footing in the NBA, but after four seasons, he became a solidified starting point guard and floor general. Johnson had six seasons where he averaged over 10.0 points per game and five seasons where he averaged over 7.0 assists per game. He played a key role in the championship run that kicked off the San Antonio Spurs' dynasty, starting in every game in 1998-99 before averaging 12.6 points, 7.4 assists and 1.2 steals per game during the postseason.\n\nIn pursuit of his sole NBA championship ring, Johnson had 11 double-digit scoring games and four double-digit assist games in the 1999 NBA Playoffs, notching three double-doubles.\n\n7. Brad Miller\n\nCollege: Purdue\n\nCareer averages: 11.2 PTS, 7.1 REB, 2.8 AST\n\nAccolades: Two-time NBA All-Star\n\nMiller went overlooked in the 1998 NBA Draft but still made a name for himself as one of four players in NBA history to go from undrafted to an All-Star.\n\nMiller did so twice, being named to the All-Star team in back-to-back seasons in 2003 and 2004. In his first All-Star season with the Indiana Pacers, he averaged 13.1 points and 8.3 rebounds per game. He was then traded to the Sacramento Kings that offseason, where he would man the middle for one of the franchise's best seasons in history, averaging 14.1 points, 10.3 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 1.2 blocks per game.\n\n6. Fred VanVleet\n\nCollege: Witchita State\n\nCareer averages: 12.1 PTS, 4.5 AST, 2.9 REB, 1.2 STL\n\nAccolades: 2019 NBA champion\n\nVanVleet made history during the 2020 NBA offseason, signing the largest contract ever (four years, $85 million) by an undrafted player. Miami Heat sharpshooter Duncan Robinson surpassed that number this past offseason (five years, $89 million), but VanVleet's is still the richest deal annually.\n\nVanVleet also set the single-game scoring record by an undrafted player this past season when he went for 54 points against the Orlando Magic, a total that marked the most in a single game in Raptors' franchise history as well.\n\nVanVleet is coming off of the strongest season of his career, averaging 19.6 points, 6.3 assists, 4.2 rebounds and 1.7 steals per game. At this current trajectory, it's safe to assume VanVleet will land much higher on this list by the end of his career.\n\n5. Udonis Haslem\n\nCollege: Florida\n\nCareer averages: 7.6 PTS, 6.7 REB\n\nAccolades: Three-time NBA champion (2006, 2012, 2013), 2004 All-Rookie Second Team\n\nHaslem joined the Heat as an undrafted free agent in 2003 and never looked back, going on his 19th season in Miami. During his prime years with the Heat, from 2005 to 2009, Haslem averaged 10.6 points, 8.4 rebounds and 1.2 assists per game, playing a huge role in helping Miami establish what is now commonly known as \"Heat Culture.\"\n\nHe was a part of all three championship teams in franchise history, starting in every playoff game in 2006, 11 of 22 playoff games in 2012 and 19 of 22 playoff games in 2013.\n\n4. Bruce Bowen\n\nCollege: Cal State Fullerton\n\nCareer averages: 6.1 PTS, 2.8 REB, 1.2 AST, 39.3% 3PT\n\nAccolades: Three-time NBA champion (2003, 2005, 2007), eight-time All-Defence\n\nBowen's career averages may not jump off the page, but his impact on the Spurs' championship teams was undeniable. His five All-Defensive First Team selections speak volumes, locking down any wing scorer during the 2000s playoff runs. He shot over 40.0 percent from 3-point range in six different seasons, and he was a career 42.2 percent 3-point shooter in the playoffs, often knocking down big shots.\n\n3. John Starks\n\nCollege: Oklahoma State\n\nCareer averages: 12.5 PTS, 3.6 AST, 2.5 REB, 1.1 STL\n\nAccolades: One-time All-Star, 1993 Second Team All-Defence, 1997 Sixth Man of the Year\n\nStarks' path to the NBA wasn't easy, but the tough-nosed guard found a way to develop his unique path into becoming a New York legend.\n\nGoing undrafted out of Oklahoma State, Starks played one year in the NBA with the Golden State Warriors before taking his talents overseas. When he returned to the NBA to play for the New York Knicks, his legacy as a player would change forever. From 1991 to 1998, Starks averaged 14.1 points, 4.0 assists, 2.7 rebounds and 1.2 steals for the Knicks, but his impact was much greater than advertised.\n\nHe averaged double figures scoring in seven of his eight seasons in New York, helping lead the team back to the NBA Finals in 1994, ending a 21-year drought. Although the Knicks lost in the Finals in seven games, Starks scored 19 or more points in five of the seven contests, going for over 20 points three times.\n\nHis attitude and demeanour left an imprint on Knicks basketball forever.\n\n2. Connie Hawkins\n\nCollege: Iowa\n\nCareer averages: 18.7 PTS, 8.8 REB, 4.1 AST, 1.2 STL\n\nAccolades: Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer, five-time All-Star, one-time All-NBA, 1968 ABA MVP, 1968 ABA champion, two-time All-ABA\n\nHawkins' reason for going undrafted was unlike any other player on this list, being banned by the NBA for a wrongfully accused point-shaving scandal during his time at Iowa. While Hawkins had his situation figured out with the NBA, he bounced around in different professional leagues before dominating the ABA, averaging 28.2 points, 8.8 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game, winning an MVP and NBA championship in 1968.\n\nHis success translated to the NBA as well, averaging over 20 points per game in his first three seasons with the Phoenix Suns, being named an All-Star in his first four years in his new league.\n\nHawkins was later inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame for his contributions to both the ABA and NBA.\n\n1. Ben Wallace\n\nCollege: Virginia Union University\n\nCareer averages: 5.7 PTS, 9.6 REB, 2.0 BLK, 1.3 AST, 1.3 STL\n\nAccolades: Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer, 2004 NBA champion, four-time Defensive Player of the Year, four-time All-Star, six-time All-Defence, five-time All-NBA, two-time rebounding champion, one-time blocks champion\n\nWallace is undeniably the greatest undrafted player in NBA history.\n\nOne of the best defenders in league history, Wallace has four Defensive Player of the Year awards to his name, tied with Dikembe Mutumbo for the most all-time. Coming into the league during an era where big men ruled the NBA, it's easy to understand how an undersized center like Wallace could get overlooked in the NBA Draft. But his intensity, physicality, attitude, effort and athleticism made up for whatever he lacked in height, becoming one of the most dominant interior players in the 2000s.\n\nHe will become the first undrafted player in the new draft era (since 1989) to be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nThe views on this page do not necessarily represent the views of the NBA or its clubs."}, {"url": "https://basketball.realgm.com/player/John-Holland/Summary/17700", "page_content": "The Improbable, Inevitable Miami Heat by John Wilmes It was not foreseeable Miami would defeat the most talented teams in the sport, flaring an unusual ability to find and corner the frightened child within some of the NBA's biggest stars.\n\nNBA Draft Report: Cason Wallace Of Kentucky by Zachary Cohen Cason Wallace is a plus defender with an NBA ready jumper that can immediately help a lot of basketball teams, and he's going to be a chameleon in the league when it comes to fit.\n\nFor The Nuggets, Attention Isn't the Prize by John Wilmes Your life is certainly better if you don't make yourself think like a media executive, but the exercise may be useful to those acting confused about why a business-first basketball team with minimal mainstream history and no loud characters has been under-publicized."}, {"url": "https://basketball.realgm.com/player/Joe-Holland/Summary/103824", "page_content": "The Improbable, Inevitable Miami Heat by John Wilmes It was not foreseeable Miami would defeat the most talented teams in the sport, flaring an unusual ability to find and corner the frightened child within some of the NBA's biggest stars.\n\nNBA Draft Report: Cason Wallace Of Kentucky by Zachary Cohen Cason Wallace is a plus defender with an NBA ready jumper that can immediately help a lot of basketball teams, and he's going to be a chameleon in the league when it comes to fit.\n\nFor The Nuggets, Attention Isn't the Prize by John Wilmes Your life is certainly better if you don't make yourself think like a media executive, but the exercise may be useful to those acting confused about why a business-first basketball team with minimal mainstream history and no loud characters has been under-publicized."}, {"url": "https://playersbio.com/john-holland/", "page_content": "John Holland is a professional basketball player for Frutti Extra Bursaspor of the Basketbol S\u00fcper Ligi, who was born in the United States.\n\nJohn Holland\u2019s positive attitude and selfless play have kept the Bursaspor\u2019s skilled pieces together and developing.\n\nAt League, there are more talented players on the field.

He was born in Bronx, New York, on November 16, 1988.\n\nHis parents, Diana Mills and John Holland, Sr, are Puerto Rican immigrants who came to the United States as children.\n\nHolland grew up and was raised in the Bronx and started playing competitive basketball.\n\nHis father, John Holland, Sr., a retired educator who played basketball as an Iona College undergraduate, instilled a love for the game.\n\nHowever, he was not raised with the intention of becoming a professional basketball player. His Bronx high school was noted for its academics rather than sports. He wasn\u2019t scouted by any major college schools, either.\n\nHigh School & College Career\n\nHolland was a McDonald\u2019s All-American nominee, a CHSAA All-Division selection, and a Journal News All-County selection at Fordham Prep, where he averaged 16 points, 8 rebounds, 8 assists, and 3 steals per game.\n\nThe athlete also played for Saint Benedict\u2019s Prep, where he had 10 points, 6 rebounds, 3 steals, 6 assists, and 2 blocks per game average.\n\nHolland was a collegiate basketball player for Boston University, where he led the America East Conference by averaging 19.2 points per game as a junior in 2009\u201310.\n\nHe went on to win the America East Conference Men\u2019s Basketball Player of the Year award and lead the Terriers to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nThe 6\u20199\u2033 American-born Ryan Bowen is a former professional basketball player who played for NBA and at present serves as an assistant coach.\n\nEuropean Career\n\nHolland was undrafted in the NBA draft in 2011. The athlete signed with Chorale Roanne Basket of France for the 2011\u201312 season on July 5, 2011.\n\nAfter that, he played for various other teams for short period like Oklahoma City Thunder, Miami Heat, Cajasol Sevilla of Spain, Minnesota Timberwolves, BCM Gravelines of France, San Antonio Spurs and Be\u015fikta\u015f of Turkey.\n\nWhile playing for Be\u015fikta\u015f of Turkey, he scored 8.7 points, 2.8 rebounds, 1.3 assists, and 0.6 steal in 15 Eurocup games.\n\nG-League Career\n\nHolland was purchased by the Canton Charge of the NBA Development League on December 23, 2015.\n\nLater that night, he made his Charge debut against the Grand Rapids Drive, with 11 points, 3 assists, 3 rebounds, and 2 steals in a 113\u2013111 loss.\n\nHe averaged 3.1 rebounds, 16.0 points, 2.0 assists, and 1.2 steals in 30.2 minutes per game in 37 games with the Charge.\n\nThe Canton Charge re-acquired Holland on December 9, 2016. He was named the D-Impact League\u2019s Player of the Year at the end of the season.\n\nHolland agreed to sign with the Beijing Eastern Bucks of the Chinese National Basketball League after the terminal of the 2016-17 NBA Development League season. He did, however, leave Beijing before participating in a single game for them.\n\nThe 7\u20191\u2033 forward / center Pau Gasol is a Spanish-born former professional basketball player who earned the NBA championship rings two times.\n\nFinally, Journey to The NBA\n\nJohn Holland signed with the Boston Celtics on April 11, 2016. On April 19, he made his Celtics debut, playing one minute off the bench in an 89\u201372 playoff loss to the Atlanta Hawks. The Celtics waived him on August 31, 2016.\n\nHolland signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers on September 26, 2016, but was released on October 22 after participating in three preseason games.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers signed Holland to a two-way contract on September 8, 2017. He will split time between both the Cavs and their G-League club, the Canton Charge, per the rules of the agreement. Holland is the Cavaliers\u2019 first player to sign such a contract.\n\nDuring this contract, he would also participate in his first NBA regular-season games after previously appearing in only one playoff game for Boston. Holland appeared in 24 games for the Cavaliers, averaging 2.3 points per game.\n\nHe won the Eastern Conference championship with the Cavaliers and advanced to the NBA Finals. However, the Golden State Warriors swept Cleveland, led by all-star LeBron James. On November 9, 2018, the Cavs waived Holland.\n\nAge, Height & Weight\n\nJohn Holland was born on November 6, 1988, in the Bronx, New York. He is currently 34 years old.\n\nHolland, who stands 6-foot-5 and weighs 205 pounds, has the size, athleticism, and toughness to guard three positions. His zodiac sign is Scorpio.\n\nAccording to reports, he enjoys playing video games and riding motorcycles in addition to basketball. His other interests include watching TV shows and being in shape.\n\nDerrick White is an American professional basketball player for the NBA\u2019s Boston Celtics. Know him more here!\n\nJohn Holland: Struggles\n\nHolland resided roughly an hour\u2019s drive south of Cleveland, just outside of Canton. He shared a home with a friend, and his life was far from glamorous \u2014 particularly for a professional athlete.\n\nAt a nearby community facility, there was practice, weight training, film sessions, and the games themselves. Aside from that, the guys spent a lot of their free time at the apartment complex where they all lived.\n\nIt was a gamble to play in the D-League when you could make much more money playing elsewhere.\n\nOnly a small percentage of D-League players are called up to the NBA.

He became the first Cavalier to sign a two-way contract.\n\nFurthermore, the starting salary for two-way players is $77,250, prorated for days spent in the G League.\n\nTwo-way players can earn up to $385,000, according to Marc Stein of the New York Times, including a prorated NBA Rookie Pay for time spent with the parent team.\n\nGirlfriend\n\nJohn Holland has not revealed any details regarding his relationships. As a result, we don\u2019t have any information regarding his partner for the time being.\n\nFurthermore, we couldn\u2019t identify any significant someone in his life after looking through his social media profile. We believe he should be focusing more on honing his basketball skills right now.\n\nHolland is working hard to return to the NBA; thus, he must not have enough time to focus on relationships in the meanwhile.\n\nWe will update you about it as soon as the basketball player discloses information about his girlfriend.\n\nAwards & Achievements\n\nIsraeli State Cup winner (2020)\n\nBSN champion (2019)\n\nAll-NBA D-League Third Team (2017)\n\nLNB Pro A All-Star (2012)\n\nAmerica East Tournament MVP (2011)\n\nAmerica East Player of the Year (2011)\n\nNBA D-League Impact Player of the Year (2017)\n\n3\u00d7 First-team All-America East (2009\u20132011)\n\nAmerica East Freshman of the Year (2008)\n\nThird-team All-America East (2008)\n\nAmerica East All-Defensive Team (2008)\n\nAmerica East All-Freshman Team (2008)\n\nSocial Media Presence\n\nInstagram \u2013 26.3k followers (As of April 2022)\n\nTwitter \u2013 8305 followers (As of April 2022)\n\nFAQs\n\nIs John Holland good?\n\nJohn Holland is not only a dynamic player on the court, but he also knows the importance of embracing and performing wherever he is.

In Poole\u2019s mind, he was going to cook Lowry on the Heat\u2019s FTX Arena floor. Poole hit Lowry with a nasty in-and-out dribble that sent him spiraling to the baseline. The third-year Warriors guard snatched the ball back, then drained a stepback three.\n\nIn high-energy minutes off the bench, Juan Toscano-Anderson dived to retrieve a loose ball, slashed through the paint and launched himself off the Chase Center floor, defying gravity and daring Suns center JaVale McGee to meet him at the rim.\n\nToscano-Anderson powered through the air and McGee\u2019s outstretched hands and threw down a brutal one-handed posterizing jam.\n\nBoth moments were signature highlight plays by the Warriors\u2019 supporting players (though Poole has made a star turn this month), and both showed growth cultivated in Santa Cruz with Warriors\u2019 G League affiliate.\n\nTwenty-nine of the NBA\u2019s 30 teams have G League affiliates. Raptors 905 and the Oklahoma City Blue are two teams known to have a close bond with their NBA counterparts, but the bond between Santa Cruz and Golden State is like the ultimate big brother-little brother relationship: Intimate and symbiotic. Same name and same game.\n\n\u201cWe try to keep everything as much similar to the Warriors as we can from what plays and sets we\u2019re running and also what our terminology is,\u201d Santa Cruz head coach Seth Cooper said. \u201cFor the most part, we try to do the same things and just adding a little more structure or teaching some of the reads in a little more detail.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that the Warriors often seem to find players who can effectively impact the game in their specific roles on the team and a lot of that has to do with what some of these players learn during stints with the Santa Cruz Warriors.\n\nIf Golden State is the main stage where the lights are shining the brightest and the harshest, Santa Cruz is backstage. It is where the players hustle and grind behind the curtains. Where they are developed, groomed and prepared for their role in the ensemble cast of the main roster and in some cases, other teams in the league.\n\nThis angle of Poole leaving Lowry in the dust \ud83d\ude32 pic.twitter.com/bshGv7Sra0 \u2014 Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) March 24, 2022\n\nWhen it clicks\n\nJordan Poole joined the Santa Cruz Warriors last season as a player who had the potential to be great and the work ethic to match. What he didn\u2019t have was a sound understanding of the Warriors\u2019 system. The month-long stint with the Sea Dubs provided the young guard extra reps and a deeper understanding that he needed to thrive.\n\nPoole\u2019s ascension came when then-Santa Cruz head coach Kris Weems pressed the young guard to speed up his decision making. In Weems\u2019 \u201c.5 seconds or less\u201d system, Poole had a half-second after receiving the ball to either shoot, dribble or pass.\n\nThe principle was influential in Poole\u2019s performances in the G League\u2019s Orlando bubble last season, including scoring 37 points in a Santa Cruz comeback win over Fort Wayne last season. It also helped him return to Golden State as a more sure and decisive player.\n\nRight now, Poole is on a tear. With his 38 points against Phoenix Wednesday night, Poole has scored 20 or more points in 15 consecutive games. For the month of March, he averaged 25.4 points per game on 50 percent from the field and 44 percent from deep \u2014 a far cry from his 28 percent 3-point shooting in his rookie season.\n\n\u201cThe big thing was just how Jordan was able to go and get confidence from playing and carrying that right over into having a really good stretch with the Warriors, and also get some of the coaching that he needed early on, where they were able to have him with the (NBA) team for a long period of time,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nFor Toscano-Anderson, his \u201cah-ha\u201d moment wasn\u2019t that extensive. It was as simple as knowing who he is and what he can bring to the Warriors \u2013 being a high-energy guy off the bench who can play solidly in fluctuating minutes.\n\n\u201cI think it started to click during the season for me,\u201d Toscano-Anderson said of his G League experience. \u201cI realized that I could play in the NBA as well, and we had an amazing coaching staff, starting with (Aaron) Miles, who was our head coach. He really helped me improve on the court.\u201d\n\nJUAN TOSCANO-ANDERSON ON JAVALE MCGEE \ud83d\ude31 pic.twitter.com/IrQr2qLJKx \u2014 ESPN (@espn) December 4, 2021\n\nToscano-Anderson and Poole are just two former Santa Cruz Warriors who have found a role in the NBA. Damion Lee has carved out a role with the Warriors. Quinn Cook was a contributor to the 2017-18 champion Warriors as a two-way player. Before catching on with Dallas, Philadelphia and now Brooklyn, Seth Curry spent his early career in Santa Cruz. The Lakers\u2019 Kendrick Nunn and Toronto\u2019s Chris Boucher also spent time as Sea Dubs as well.\n\nThat path was what the Warriors envisioned when they bought the Dakota Wizards in 2011 and moved the team to Santa Cruz. Warriors Executive Vice President Kirk Lacob told his group he wanted to see every G League player called up to Golden State \u2013 even if the roster rules wouldn\u2019t allow it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a home run across the board,\u201d Lacob said. \u201cWe set out to do what we aimed to do and we\u2019ve gotten to see players gain invaluable experience and the hope is that the wheel keeps turning.\u201d\n\nLocked in and linked\n\nThe success of the Santa Cruz-Golden State relationship is based on the idea of being intertwined on all levels. It doesn\u2019t stop at sharing the same on-court identity and principles. Their true partnership is what makes the connection between affiliate and parent club pop. It\u2019s the secret in their sauce.\n\nGolden State executives are in constant contact with their Santa Cruz counterparts. Warriors Director of Team Development Kent Lacob is known to have periodic check-ins with the players, which has helped him in his executive role for Golden State.\n\n\u201cIt gives you a different type of perspective and insight into the decisions that you want to make when you\u2019re at the bigger stage of Golden State,\u201d Lacob said. \u201cSo it\u2019s been incredibly impactful.\u201d\n\nFor Santa Cruz general manager David Fatoki, it is the Warriors\u2019 willingness \u2013 from the executives to coach Steve Kerr \u2013 to invest in their affiliate that stands out.\n\n\u201cI think the buy-in is what makes it work so well and we\u2019ve been successful in finding players over the past few years. But it comes from the top down,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen it over the last few years that (Kerr) has no hesitancy in having young Warriors, whether it\u2019s Jonathan Kuminga to Moses Moody, playing games in Santa Cruz and he trusts the coaching staff and the front office. I think it\u2019s just the buy-in, knowing that we are all on the same page and that everything we do in Santa Cruz has a purpose.\u201d\n\nLee came to the Warriors from the Celtics\u2019 G League affiliate in Maine. While Lee says that both organizations are well run, the bond between Santa Cruz and Golden State makes a difference. The cohesiveness on the court is one thing but it\u2019s the off-the-court ties that bind. Lee and other Golden State Warriors have been known to attend Sea Dubs games from time to time.\n\n\u201cI think what really makes this organization so great and so special is the fact that Santa Cruz and San Francisco are an hour and 15, maybe an hour and a half away but still taking time out to go down and watch games or even for them to come up and practice is really special.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://santacruz.gleague.nba.com/news/santa-cruz-warriors-announce-schedule-for-the-2022-23-season", "page_content": "SANTA CRUZ, CA \u2013 The Santa Cruz Warriors, the NBA G League affiliate of the Golden State Warriors, have announced the Showcase Cup and regular season schedule for the team\u2019s upcoming 2022-23 season, presented by Kaiser Permanente.

That would be the Golden State Warriors who, at this moment, are playing in the NBA Finals for the sixth time in the past eight years.\n\nThey are not only the hottest property on the sports landscape today, but Steph Curry\u2019s Dubs are the most charismatic team in the Bay Area\u2019s rich sports history at least since Joe Montana\u2019s 1980s-era 49ers. And Santa Cruz is along for the ride.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about, of course, the Santa Cruz Warriors, Golden State\u2019s one and only namesake development team in the NBA\u2019s one and only subsidiary minor league, the G League. The Santa Cruz Warriors \u2014 the \u201cSea Dubs,\u201d as they\u2019re known informally \u2014 arrived in town in 2012, just before the NBA team ascended to legendary status.\n\nThey had come to Santa Cruz from their previous perch in Bismarck, North Dakota. (Not to slag the fine state of North Dakota, but can you even conceive of two American cities more fundamentally different than Santa Cruz and Bismarck?)\n\nIt\u2019s been an amazing, even magical decade for the local professional basketball team \u2014 our Warriors, in fact, even won the G League championship in 2015, the same year the other Warriors won their first NBA championship of the Curry era.\n\nThe G League universe as it stands now. Click picture for more on how the league works and connects to the NBA. (Via G League)\n\nBizarrely, the mirroring effect between the two teams goes beyond even their names and championships. Just as the \u201cSplash Brothers\u201d \u2014 Steph Curry and Klay Thompson \u2014 were first lighting up the NBA, their respective real-life brothers \u2014 Seth Curry and Mychel Thompson \u2014 were suiting up for the Sea Dubs. Sometimes, reality is just a hack screenwriter.\n\nKlay Thompson shakes the rust in Santa Cruz on Monday, practicing with the Warriors. (Kevin Painchaud / Lookout Santa Cruz)\n\nBut now, in the cold light of the post-pandemic era, a reckoning is at hand and a question looms on the local sports scene horizon: Is there a future for the Santa Cruz Warriors?\n\nThe world of minor-league sports is particularly volatile, and it\u2019s certainly conceivable that the Warriors could depart as quickly as they arrived. Even though they\u2019ve been around for only 10 years, the Sea Dubs have now played in the same venue longer than any other G League team on the West Coast. (In that same time, the league itself has changed, morphing from the D League, meaning Development League, to the G League, which stands for \u2014 and how I wish I were making this up \u2014 the Gatorade League.)\n\nSo stability is not part of the G League brand. Even so, the Santa Cruz Warriors are facing a particularly acute problem that demands a solution sooner rather than later. The Warriors\u2019 home court, the Kaiser Permanente Arena, is not a long-term home for the team, mainly because it was never meant to be. The city-owned arena was erected on what used to be an employee parking lot for Boardwalk workers, and downtown locals still talk about how quickly the thing went up.\n\nKaiser Permanente Arena from above. (Via Google)\n\nIt was designed in much the same \u201cair tent\u201d manner as temporary arenas in the Olympics were built, steel walls supporting a fabric tent-like roof. It was a stopgap solution until the day when a more permanent venue could be built. Fast forward 10 years, and it\u2019s clear that the future is now.\n\nThe stakeholders \u2014 the Warriors, the City of Santa Cruz, and the Seaside Co., owners of the Boardwalk \u2014 are in the early stages of envisioning what that future will look like. A solution could come as early as fall 2023. The question will return this week to the Santa Cruz City Council as council members and city planners kick around ideas.\n\nAny new arena is likely to cost anywhere from $20 million to $60 million, (by comparison, the big club\u2019s new home, Chase Center in San Francisco, cost about $1.4 billion).\n\nFrom the city\u2019s perspective, the new arena will almost certainly have to be constructed within the context of providing more housing. Better acoustics (sound at KP is awful) would make the new place a promising venue for big-name touring acts. A functioning kitchen (KP has no kitchen) could introduce a vibrant new foodie appeal to catching a game (I mean, have you tried the Gilroy garlic fries at the Giants\u2019 ballpark?).\n\nBut beyond the possibility, and perhaps necessity, of a new arena, there is one question still unanswered: Is Santa Cruz really a good sports town?\n\nBut beyond the possibility, and perhaps necessity, of a new arena, there is one question still unanswered: Is Santa Cruz really a good sports town? The team logged many sellout dates, especially in the early years. But the KP Arena\u2019s capacity, a little more than 2,500, is one of the smallest in the G League, and some of those \u201csellouts\u201d involved giveaway tickets.\n\nThe SC Warriors also enjoyed the best possible circumstances in the 2010s: a honeymoon period that any new franchise experiences when bedazzled fans first discover the joys of fandom, the parent club developing into a NBA powerhouse led by a once-in-a-generation talent in Curry, and the brothers of the Splash Brothers in uniform in Santa Cruz.\n\nBut longtime Golden State fans also know that this golden age is not normal. Before Steph Curry, the Dubs wandered for years in a desert of NBA mediocrity or worse (remember the Sprewell years?). One day, this team will fall to earth, and the novelty of seeing live professional hoops will fade. How will Santa Cruz respond then?\n\nThe Sea Dubs have maximized the gameday vibe at KP Arena. (Via Warriors)\n\nAnyone who has ever been to a Sea Dubs game at KP can tell you that the energy is often downright electrifying. There\u2019s a wonderful family vibe to the scene. Kids can be gobsmacked by the intensity of the play and the spectacle of the show. Credit the Warriors with creating a constant-motion sense of entertainment, even during timeouts.\n\nRoughly half of the seating is bleachers, which are not good for the human body, particularly the aging human body. But generally, in a town as small as Santa Cruz, the likelihood you\u2019ll share a high five or a friendly greeting with a neighbor or old acquaintance is strong. That electricity also spills outside the arena into the streets. You can pick up the vibe of a Warriors game just about anywhere downtown.\n\nStill, minor-league teams have marketing issues that big-league teams simply do not have and the Warriors are not immune to those challenges. The quality of play is, by definition, not the same. Rosters in the G League are in a constant state of flux, so fan attachments to star players \u2014 and the jersey and ticket sales that result from such attachments \u2014 are essentially a non-factor. Seasons-long legacy loyalty sustains many big-league clubs, but that kind of fan allegiance is difficult to attain when franchises are constantly being shuffled, as they are in the minors.\n\nLet\u2019s say the Sea Dubs get their glittery new arena. Once the new-car smell is gone and the big-league Dubs are bad and/or boring again, will Santa Cruz fans step up to support the team out of a pure love of competition and civic pride? This is a city that, for decades, has had a tough time even establishing a thriving sports bar.\n\nSanta Cruz Warriors President Chris Murphy watches his team play basketball.\n\nWe tend to like participatory sports over the spectator kind, and wild, unpredictable loner activities like surfing over regimented, militaristic ones like football. In a town that has been dominated by a left-progressive mindset, sports is still a dirty word in some people\u2019s minds, a particularly lurid symbol of capitalist grotesquery \u2014 did we mention the league is named after Gatorade? \u2014 and a big, loud, meaningless distraction from the business of changing the world.\n\nObviously, there\u2019s a strong subset of people who love sports, who like to chill out in the bleachers at Harvey West at a ballgame, who still get excited when Harbor meets Santa Cruz High on the football field. This has been the fan base that the Warriors have been masterful in attracting. But is that demographic enough to show up on a Wednesday night in February when the team is 12 games under .500?\n\nOf course, whenever that new arena opens \u2014 it will take some time to build \u2014 it will presumably be after much of the development on lower Pacific Avenue is finished, and downtown Santa Cruz will have a new look for a new era. To the degree that the Warriors are successful in attracting fans in that new environment, it will likely be a significant indicator that Santa Cruz is changing into some new thing.\n\nTELL US WHAT YOU THINK Make your voice heard with a letter to the editor Share your thoughts by sending a letter to the editor.

Maybe then is when the Warriors will launch their rebrand and reemerge as the Santa Cruz Frisbee Dogs with tie-dye uniforms (when you name your league after a sports drink, no prediction is too outlandish).\n\nThe alternative future is that the city and the team can\u2019t come to terms, that resistance builds and an energetic group of anti-arena activists gets the signatures necessary to put the arena on the ballot and the vitriol generated makes us all nostalgic for the good old days of Measure D. Maybe the Golden State Warriors decide it\u2019s better to find some other place in the Golden State to move to, and Santa Cruz joins Bismarck on the list of cities jilted by the Gatorade League.\n\nI\u2019d hate to see that day come. The Sea Dubs are still a golden ticket, and Santa Cruzans would be wise to support any reasonable proposal for a new arena.\n\nI\u2019m surprised that I got this far in this column without a basketball analogy, so here goes: The future of the Santa Cruz Warriors is a ball still up in the air. Whether it swishes or clanks off the rim is impossible to tell at this point. Let\u2019s hope that shot goes in, because if it doesn\u2019t, there will be plenty of cities and towns in position for the rebound.\n\n\n\nMore from Wallace"}, {"url": "https://texas.gleague.nba.com/news/legends-acquire-returning-player-rights-to-isiah-brown", "page_content": "FRISCO, TX, (Oct. 6, 2021) - The Texas Legends have acquired the returning player rights to Isaiah Brown in a trade with the Santa Cruz Warriors.
