Called the \"Tournament East\u2013West football game\" at the time, the Michigan Wolverines (East) played the Stanford Indians (West) - the Wolverines won 49 - 0. (The Stanford captain requested an end to the game with 8 minutes remaining.) The Tournament of Roses Parade began in 1890 and the football game began as a way to boost tourism in the area.\n\nIn 1910, by the time he was only 8 years old, the Mann Act, also called the White-Slave Traffic Act, was signed into law. Its purpose was to make it a felony to engage in interstate or foreign commerce transport of \"any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose\". But the language was so broad that it was also applied to consensual sex between adults when wished.\n\nIn 1920, by the time he was 18 years old, Italian born factory worker Nicola Sacco and fish peddler Bartolomeo Vanzetti were picked up by police on May 5th in connection with the April 15th murder and robbery of a guard and a paymaster at the Slater and Morrill Shoe Company in South Braintree, Mass. Although in later years they were thought to be innocent, they were anarchists and were convicted of the crime and put to death.\n\nIn 1957, by the time he was 55 years old, on October 4th, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik I, the first man made earth-orbiting satellite - and triggered the Space Race. Sputnik I was only 23 inches in diameter and had no tracking equipment, only 4 antennas, but it had a big impact.\n\nIn 1974, in the year of Frank Mclain's passing, on August 9th, Gerald R. Ford became the 38th President of the United States. He had been Vice President for 8 months when he became President due to the resignation of President Nixon."}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6524605/frank-a-mclain", "page_content": "There is a problem with your email/password.\n\nWe\u2019ve updated the security on the site.

McLain, whose death occured at the home of his son, Clark McLain, at Pasadena, Calif., at the age of nearly 88 years, was a real pioneer of Story county, having lived here continuously for over 70 years, with the exception of the past couple of years, during which time he had been with the family of his son in the coast city.\n\n\n\nMr. McLain was not only a pioneer of the county and state, but he was one of the outstanding citizens of the community. Not because of public or political preferment, but for his accomplishments in the community. Through his industry, integrity and frugality he had aided much in building up the community to what it is today, and at the same time accumulated a large heritage for his family.\n\n\n\nThe body arrived here Sunday morning over the Rock Island from the California city where he had died, accompanied by his son and wife, in whose home he had found comfort and care during his last days.\n\n\n\nFuneral services were held from Central Presbyterian church Sunday afternoon, where a wide circle of old-time neighbors and friends gathered to pay their final tribute of respect to the memory of their old friend. The sermon was preached by Rev. J. Geo. Walz and the casket containing the body was bourne to its final resting place by J. G. Dutton, J. A. Mills, C. M. Minkler and John W. Cook, Jr. of Nevada, Henry Garlock of Maxwell and U. S. Griffith of Ames all oldtime friends.\n\n\n\nThe following biography of Mr. McLain was read by Rev. Walz during the service:\n\n\n\nFrank A. McLain, the third child of Wilson and Sarah E. Lockard-McLain, was born in Bedford county, Penn., January 7, 1837. When he was two years old his mother died and shortly after Wilson McLain with his three small children, Russell, Catherine and the baby Frank, moved to a location in the State of Ohio near Upper Sandusky. Wilson McLain was a farmer and there he tried to carve a farm from the primeval forest that then covered the greater part of Ohio. In a few years he succombed to a malady that in those days carried off man of the pioneers of that region.\n\n\n\nFrank, the eleven year old, went to live with his paternal grandfather, but not for long. At the age of fifteen young Frank was in the state of Illinois, near the city of Rochelle and making his own way in the world. In April of 1864, when he was in his seventeenth year he made his way to the pioneer location of Nevada in Story county.\n\n\n\nThere was but one house at that time to what was to become the future county seat of Story county. Young Frank's first job at Nevada was to go into the timber and fell trees, cut them into rail lengths, and then split the logs into fence rails to be used in fencing pioneer farms. For making these rails he received one cent each, of ten dollars per thousand. By hard work and strict economy in about two years he had saved up enough money to buy a yoke of cattle and a wagon. With this outfit he at spare times hauled wheat from the vicinity of Nevada to Iowa City, then the western terminus of a railroad, and on the return trip hauled goods back to Nevada. The round trip covered 200 miles and the pay was five dollars each way and the road was a mere trail, crossing unbridged streams and winding its way across the grass prairies and through the woodlands bordering streams. At nights he slept under his wagon and out of his pay he had to buy the food he ate.\n\n\n\nIn June 1861 he was united in marriage with Mary A. Doyle. In the following year the young couple moved onto a farm southeast of Nevada. Two children were born to them, Clark, now living in Pasadena and Mildred Lee so was the wife of Joseph M. Bricker died in Nevada in 1912.\n\n\n\nFrom the date of their marriage for the next thirty years, Mr. and Mrs. McLain were actively engaged with the other pioneers of Iowa in transforming the prairies of Iowa, with their ponds and sloughs, into the world's finest and most productive farms. Success attended their labors and in the early 1900s they moved from the old home farm to Nevada, where they had their home until in May of 1921, when Mrs. McLain died in Pasadena. Since that time he has made his home in Pasadena with the family of his son, Clark. While he had lived in Pasadena h still considered Nevada as his residence and his dearest interests all centered there.\n\n\n\nIt was his wish that he be buried by the side of his wife in the Nevada cemetery where now lie so many of his relatives and the friends of his earlier days.\n\n\n\nFrank A. McLain lived an active, clean and honest life. His preparation for his life work was gained in the University of \"Hard Knocks\" and he took the full course and emerged from his Alma Mater with a degree of self reliance that served him well during the long and busy life.\n\n\n\nBesides his son Clark, he leaves five grandchildren, and six great grandchildren.\n\nFrom Nevada Journal December 1924\n\n\n\nFRANK M'LAIN WAS REAL PIONEER OF STORY COUNTY\n\n\n\nCAME HERE AS BOY IN 1854 AND LIVED HERE NEARLY CONTINUOUSLY\n\n\n\nFrank A.

The public - and government - had felt that films in the '20's had become increasingly risque and that the behavior of its stars was becoming scandalous. Laws were being passed. In response, the heads of the movie studios adopted a voluntary \"code\", hoping to head off legislation. The first part of the code prohibited \"lowering the moral standards of those who see it\", called for depictions of the \"correct standards of life\", and forbade a picture from showing any sort of ridicule towards a law or \"creating sympathy for its violation\". The second part dealt with particular behavior in film such as homosexuality, the use of specific curse words, and miscegenation.\n\nIn 1941, by the time she was just 11 years old, in his State of the Union address on January 6th, President Roosevelt detailed the \"four freedoms\" that everyone in the world should have: Freedom of speech, Freedom of worship, Freedom from want, and Freedom from fear. In the same speech, he outlined the benefits of democracy which he said were economic opportunity, employment, social security, and the promise of \"adequate health care\".\n\nIn 1956, when she was 26 years old, this was the year that the King of Rock and Roll, Elvis Presley, became an international sensation. He began the year as a regional favorite and ended the year with 17 recordings having been on the Billboard\u2019s Top 100 singles chart, 11 TV appearances, and a movie. Elvis scandalized adults and thrilled teens.\n\nIn 1962, Sarah was 32 years old when on October 1st, African-American James H. Meredith, escorted by federal marshals, registered at the University of Mississippi - becoming the first African-American student admitted to the segregated college. He had been inspired by President Kennedy's inaugural address to apply for admission.\n\nIn 1989, at the age of 59 years old, Sarah was alive when on January 20th, George Herbert Walker Bush became the 41st President of the United States. Previously Ronald Regan's Vice President, he ran against Michael Dukakis and won the popular vote by 53.4% to 45.6%."}]}
