During his early boyhood he had the advantages of a country school education, and was noted for his exuberant wit and wonderful mimicry. A grotesque attitude or a peculiar grimace from Billy was sure to create an uproarious laugh in the school-room that resulted in a reprimand from the teacher, who was often holding his sides and straining every nerve to repress his own impulse to laugh outright at his amusing pupil.\n\n\"In due course of time the mirthful school-boy was apprenticed to S.S. Tuttle, Esq., the well-known druggist of Fredericktown, Ohio, where he rapidly won many friends by his aptitude and affability. Here he was in his glory, for the drug-store soon became the popular resort of a mirth-loving circle, of which Billy was the brightest center light. While all was sunshine the dark cloud of civil war spread its shadow over the land, and in response to his country's call, Mr Burke, though but sixteen years of age, enlisted under the old flag, and in six hard-fought battles exhibited the fortitude and heroism of a veteran. During many a tedious campaign he was the life and soul of the camp, driving dull care away during many an otherwise gloomy hour, by cheerful songs and merry jokes.\n\n\"At last, at the battle of Arkansas Post, Burke was seriously wounded, and so disabled as to soon receive an honorable discharge from the army, much to the regret of his many admiring comrades. When sufficiently recovered to permit it, Mr Burke became clerk in the large house of Eaton, McCrum & Co., Pittsburgh, Pa. Time now passed with our hero as smoothly as a gently-flowing river, rippled ever and anon by his irrepressible humor, till he turned his versatility into a professional channel by joining a minstrel troupe in 1865. After a brief tour he was secured by J.M. Nixon to join his circus, and started for Galveston, Texas. In a terrible storm at sea the vessel was wrecked, and Mr Burke's happy career seemed near its end. Though lost at sea, he never, for a moment, lost hope, and was finally picked up by the United States steamship 'South Carolina,' and brought into port at New Orleans, after a perilous experience of thirty-four eventful days upon the fathomless deep.\n\n\"At New Orleans he was quickly secured for Thayer & Noyes' circus. While with this company he received another evidence of the anger of the water spirits; for, while ascending the Red River on the steamer 'Ida May,' she was wrecked and sunk. Mr Burke escaped with only the loss of a handsome and expensive wardrobe. With this circus he remained two years, joining Mike Lipman's circus the following season. The next two seasons he was with the great Forepaugh's vast show. Following these two seasons he joined L.B. Lent's circus, that was stationed in New York City, and met with a brilliant success. His next engagement was with James Robinson's circus, with whom he was when that company merged into the \"Great Chicago Show.\" At Cincinnati, Mr Burke left the last-named concern to join the 'Trans Atlantic,' and while with it went through the yellow-fever siege at its worst in Shveveport. With his usual happy luck he escaped from the doomed city for the second time, and joined L.B. Lent's great show at St Louis. From which place he went South, remaining with the organization till the season closed at Atlanta, Ga. After that event he joined the 'Great Eastern,' and afterwards went to California, where he was soon secured by Montgomery Queen, with whom he remained two years. Since that he has been traveling with other shows, until the present circus season of 1882 sees the best clown with the largest show in the world -- that owned and managed by Barnum, Bailey & Hutchinson.\n\n\n\nBilly Burke and his Clown Elephant \"Sid\"\n\nadvertisement 1886\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliam E Burke Dead\n\n\"William E Burke, of Burke, Andrus and 'Frisco,' died of gastritis on October 5, at Huddersfield, England, where he had been playing the week before. Mr Burke was sixty-three years old. He was born in Waterford, O., and was apprenticed to a druggist in Frankstown, O., where be became a great favorite. Tiring of being behind a counter he ran away and enlisted, fighting with the Union forces during the Civil War, and being wounded was honorably discharged. He then joined a circus and was speedily promoted to the front rank, singing and making popular many songs. He went to London eight years ago and opening at the Palace for a fortnight's engagement continued the run for six months. Since then, he has performed at hundreds of halls in London and the provinces. His admirable and generous qualities caused him to become greatly esteemed both in and out of the profession, and his unexpected death is greatly regretted. He was the father of Billie Burke, who played the leading character in the recent Coliseum revue and also played in \"The Duchess of Dantzic\" \"The Blue Moon\" and other pieces. The remains were laid to rest in the family vault at Hampstead Cemetery, a service having been previously held at St Paul's Church by the Rev. Herbert Bury, who later performed the last rites at the grave. The casket was covered with beautiful floral offerings.\"\n\n\n\nSources\n\n3 Blanche Beatty\n\n96 John Beatty\n\n\n\n97 Susanna Asfordby\n\n194 William Asfordby\n\n195 Martha Burton\n\n388 John Asfordby\n\n389 Alice Wolley\n\n776 William Asfordby\n\n-Bilsby, co Linc and of Newark; buried May 1623 Saltfleetby, co Linc\n\n\n\n\n\n777 Eleanor Newcomen\n\nBillie in her autobiography, states that she was born 7 Aug but does not mention the year. The California Death Index cites \"7 Aug 1884\" , this was probably entered by Billie's only child Patricia. Various sources cite 1884, 1885 and 1886.Various websites and published sources will claim that her name was Mary William Ethelbert Appleton Burke. This is slightly true and slightly false. She was named, at birth only Ethelbert Appleton Burke, Appleton being her \"godfather\". ( Source ) Mary being her christening name many years later, and William only being a sort-of back-formation from her desire to be called \"Billie\" or \"Billy\" after her father, because she abhorred the thought of being called \"Bertha\".She states in an interview around 1926/27 that she was named \"Ethelbert Burke\". ( Source ) She also in this same interview claims a birthdate of 7 Aug 1886. However on a Passport application, her own mother uses the year 1884 for her, and there calls her \"Ethelbert Appleton\".Billie states that she was born \"in a little house on K Street\", and that her mother and she lived in Washington DC and New York while her father traveled around the country with the circus. And that at \"age 8\" the family relocated to London, where they all lived until Billie herself was at least in her late teen's. Now from this ship's manifest dated 1913 we see her birthdate given as \"7 Aug 1887\" ! Billie herself, at one point in her autobiography states, \" I was eighteen years old and the year was 1903. \" I suppose like all actresses she shaved a few years off when necessary. BGMI has several citations with years 1884, 1885 and 1886. The first mention I can find in any publication of Billie Burke, is from Lloyd's Weekly 12 Oct 1902 which in an article called \"The Music Halls \" states in mentioning various names on the music hall stages : \"...Billie Burke....\" Billie writing in 1916 states that her theatrical debut was on 9 May 1903 as Mamie Rockefeller in \"The School Girl\". The London Daily Mail, in an article \"The Motor and the Stage\", dated 23 Jun 1903 :\"...the first theatrical ladies' motor meet.... [included] Miss Billie Burke....\"The first mention I can find of her in a play is in an article in the Black and White, dated 2 Sep 1905 , in which she has a part in \"The Blue Moon\", a musical play which had premiered in the past week. On 3 Jun 1906, the Logansport Journal reported that \"Recently the popular actress was left $35,000 by Wallace T Sawyer, an old friend of her father.\"Billie's first mention in the New York Times was 26 Aug 1906, as one of : \"twenty Americans holding assured positions on the British stage at the present time.... Billie Burke....\" On 9 Jun 1907 : \"Mr [Charles] Frohman is confident that Billie Burke, who will be [John] Drew's leading woman next season, will greatly please New Yorkers. Miss Burke herself is delighted with the prospect of playing in her native land, where, up to the present, she has never appeared. Miss Burke has had a great success in London.\" On 19 Jun 1907 : \"London - Miss Billie Burke proved herself a capital actress and was warmly applauded as Madame Polacca in the revival tonight of Burnand's \"Mrs. Ponderbury's Past,\" at the Vaudeville Theatre. The cast included Charles Hawtrey.\"Sailing from Liverpool, England 25 Jul 1907 on the S.S. Baltic, arriving in New York City : \"Blanche Beatty Burke, age 60, married; Billie Burke, age 21, single\". On 17 Jun 1908, the New York Times is reporting that Billie Burke had just returned from \"the West\" after a tour of forty weeks in John Drew's company and would now sail to Liverpool with her mother. If so, she returned a month later, as I find : Sailing from Liverpool, England 23 Jul 1908 on the S.S. Baltic, arriving in New York City : \"Blanche B Burke, age 60, married; Billie Burke, age 22, single\". On 1 Aug 1908, the New York Times reports : \"Among other passengers on the Baltic were Billy Burke, who was John Drew's leading woman in 'My Wife' last season, and who is to star under the Frohman management in the Autumn....\" On 2 Nov 1908, they are reporting \"Billy Burke [sic, headlining] in 'Love Watches' at the Lyceum\"Either she or the newspapers were ambivalent about whether to spell her name \"Billy\" or \"Billie\". However, at the same time that she became known in the United States (or at least in New York), there was also a racehorse named Billy Burke, as well as a boxer named Billy Burke! One can see why, if she really was a \"Billy\", she would then decide to be a \"Billie\"! A little later, in the 1920s there was a golfer named \"Billy Burke\".Sailing from Liverpool, England 20 Jul 1909 on the S.S. Caronia, arriving in New York City : \"Blanche Beatty Burke, age 60, widow, no occupation; Billie Burke, age 23, single, actress\". Sailing from Southampton 10 Aug 1910 on the S.S. Adriatic, arriving in New York City : \"Miss Billie Burke, age 23; Mrs Blanche Burke, age 53.On 20 Aug 1910, the New York Times, reports that Billie Burke had spent time on \"her farm in Devonshire\" making hay. She likes to spend her Summers in Devonshire, because that area does not cause tan and freckles, it relates. In that article, it mentions her \"adopted daughter, Cheredal\". On 28 Sep 1910, it reports that : \"Adele Cheridah, the eighteen-year-old ward of Billie Burke, will make her metropolitan stage debut next Monday night as one of the bridesmaids in 'The Girl in the Train.' Miss Burke has withheld her consents to her ward's appearing on the stage during the three years they have been together, but this Fall she consented to let her start at the bottom and in a musical play.\"Sailing from Liverpool 9 Aug 1913, arriving in New York City : \"Blanche Burke, age 60, married, born Zanesville, Ohio, 25 Jun 1853; Billie Burke, age 26, single, born Washington DC, 7 Aug 1887, residents of Hastings-on-Hudson, New York\". Billie at this time lived in a residence she called \"Berkeley Crest\" near Hastings, New York, evidently I suppose with her mother.Billie married only once, in 1914 to showman Florenz Ziegfeld. The New York Times in an article dated 13 Apr 1914 reports the wedding as occurring \"last Saturday afternoon\" in Hoboken. The wedding was performed by Rev. Dr. J Engelberg, pastor of the Lutheran Church in Hoboken. Dr F. Ziegfeld, father of Florenz, and also his wife Mrs Ziegfeld, and also Mrs Burke, the mother, were all present. In that article they further state, \"Billie Burke whose real name is Ethel Burke is in her twenty-eighth year....\" Billie agreed to a new five-year contract with Frohman, but he died shortly, which \"automatically released her from her contract\" according to a statement from Ziegfeld.Billie's film debut was in a 1916 movie called \"Peggy\", evidently directed or produced by Thomas Ince. The New York Times reviews it in Jan 1916. Billie and Florenz had a single child, daughter Patricia, born in New York City, 23 Oct 1916, who later became an author. She is mentioned in a New York Times article dated 3 Dec 1916 as \"Florenz Patricia Burke-Ziegfeld.\" Around this time, we start to see advertisements for some type of clothing called a \"Billy Burke\", evidently a kind of pajama which had an elastic ankle so the pajama leg would not slip up. There are dozens of mentions in the New York Times during this time period, of Billie Burke being in plays and also a few movies.Still living in New York, Billie is mentioned in 1921, in a list of actresses. She is mentioned 25 Oct 1923 to appear in a new (unnamed) play. She is mentioned 7 Nov 1926 as having a pet \"baby leopard\". By 1936 however, she had relocated to Beverly Hills, California.Billie died in her sleep, in her home in Brentwood. Her body was taken to be buried in New York. Billie's tombstone in the Sharon Gardens section of Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, Westchester County, New York, also states her birthdate as 7 Aug 1884.William Ethelbert \"Billy\" Burke was born in Ohio. In the Harvard College Library, the following items are all bound together in one volume:This second item, gives us his first (and possibly only known) biographical sketch William Ethelbert \"Billy\" Burke is also cited as having been born in Youngstown, Ohio in 1843 or 1844 ( Source ). Initially apprenticed to a druggist, he \"ran away\" and enlisted for the Civil War in Ohio. After the war, he became a singing clown in Barnum & Bailey's circus. When the circus was in town in Cincinnati in 1883, he was introduced to the widow Hodkinson [Blanche], \"then living in New Orleans\". ( Source ) She had four children by her prior marriage, the youngest at this time, was eleven years old. Blanche followed the circus, until she became quite pregnant, at which time she went to Washington DC probably to live with, or near, her mother, and there had their only child Ethelbert (Billie Burke) in 1884.On 18 Aug 1886, the San Jose Daily News is advertising the \"Sells Brothers 1st Trans-Continental Tour including the mini-ad shown here.On 4 Nov 1891, 'The Day', in an article called \"Behind the Scenes\" states : \"Billy Burke, the famous clown and low comedian, fell in love with the beautiful treasury clerk whom hemarried while he was in a circus seat and he was performing in the ring in Washington.\"In the Boston Globe 22 Feb 1893, \"This week Billy Burke, the clever clown, who has made countless numbers laugh for years past with the Barnum show by his droll wit, is introducing some new pantomimic business, which has met with particular success.\" In the Boston Globe 10 Jun 1894, \"the Barnum & Bailey greatest show on earth\" arriving. \"The list of well-known clowns includes 'Pete' Conklin, 'Al' Caron and 'Billy' Burke....\"In the New York Times 16 Dec 1894, I find an advertisement for Huber's 14th St Museum including \"...Billy Burke, Barnum's Famous Clown....\" Also repeated on 23 Dec 1894. On 17 Apr 1895, in the New York Times, I find an article on \"Barnum & Bailey's Greatest Show on Earth\", which was then at Madison Square Garden, in which they particularly mention \"...old-time Billy Burke, who has such funny times with his waltzing and pugnacious dummy.\" On 16 Jun 1895 I find an article about the summer entertainment, then to be had at Manhattan Beach in which they mention : \"...Billy Burke, the principal clown....\" On 27 Dec 1896, The Philadelphia Record has an article stating the Billy Burke the clown and his elephants are performing in that city.Billie his daughter, writing in 1916 states that he was with the circus for many years \"...until pantomime and the vaudeville stage lured him... away from the sawdust.\"His obituary, appeared on 4 Nov 1906 in the Oakland Tribune:In a New York Times article, 20 Apr 1924, C I Willey, a fellow-clown describing the old days, mentions \"Billy Burke, with his clown elephant, Ah Sid. Ah Sid was one of the popular headliners.\"Billie tells us that her mother was Blanche, a widow living in Washington DC, with four children, when she married Billy Burke. That she was living long enough to see Billie successful on stage.Although her obituary states that she was born in New Orleans, Billie or whoever gave this information was probably confused. Blanche was born in Zanesville, Ohio on 24 Apr 1844. She did live in New Orleans, but it was 40 years later. In 1850 Blanche, is living with her parents John A Beatty and his wife Cecelia Flood in Muskingum County, Ohio. By 1860 the family had, for some reason, moved to Washington DC, which is probably where John died between 1860 and the 1870 census when Cecelia appears without him.Blanche married firstly to George Hodkinson, an Englishman. They married sometime between the 1860 census and 1864, their eldest child Florence Hodkinson was baptised at St Luke's in Marietta, Ohio on 16 Apr 1865. Their next child Blanche was baptized there 23 Nov 1867, and their third child George Flood Hodkinson on 15 Nov 1868. In the 1870 census of Marietta, George is listed as \"works in refinery\". They had one more child Grace born in 1871 or 1872, but she does not appear in the Parish Register and so perhaps the family had already moved by this time. By 1880, George was dead and Blanche was living in Washington, DC perhaps near her family who had stayed there.Between 1880 and 1883, Blanche relocated to New Orleans, probably with her children, her son George Flood Hodkinson would marry in 1897/98 to a woman from New Orleans. While visiting either in Cincinnati or Philadelphia, Blanche was invited to a party at which William \"Billy\" Burke was also present. They began spending time together and were married probably in 1883. Grant Hayter-Menzies uses the odd term \"eloped\" , which certainly at the age of 39 or 40 would not describe Blanche. He claims there, that they married in New York City, 11 Jan 1883, the ceremony being presided over by Rev George Hendric Houghton.Blanche followed the circus, evidently until she became unable to as her pregnancy developed. She probably then went to her mother, living in Washington DC, where Billie Burke was born 7 Aug 1884 \" in a little house on K Street \".Emergency Passport Applications, 7 Mar 1902, \"Blanche Burke\" application filed at Vienna, to include her child \"Ethelbert Appleton\" who was born at \"Washington, DC on 7 Aug 1884\". She states that she herself was born at \"Zanesville, Ohio\" on or about \"24 Apr 1844\". She states her permanent residence as \"New York, New York\". That she had left the United States on \"28 Dec 1901\" and was now temporarily sojourning at \"Budapest, Hungary\". She is here described as \"57 years 10 months, 5 foot 8, brown hair, black eyes\"New York Times, 8 Feb 1922 : \"Mrs Blanche Burke\", \"Mrs Blanche Burke, mother of Mrs Florenz Ziegfeld, who is known on the stage as Billie Burke, died yesterday at her home in Hastings. Mrs Burke was a talented newspaper woman and a pioneer of her sex in that profession. She was born in New Orleans.

Billy became the center of a mirth loving group that headquartered at the drug store.\n\nThough only sixteen years of age he joined the Union Army. At the battle of Arkansas Post, Burke was seriously wounded, and so disabled received an honorable discharge from the Army.\n\nIn 1865 his first professional mirth-making began when he joined a minstrel troupe. This association was short lived and he left soon for employment with the J. M. Nixon Circus. He was to join the show in Galveston, Texas, and fate nearly cut short his life when the steamship carrying him to the Nixon show was wrecked at sea, and after being lost he was picked up and brought to New Orleans. In this city he was quickly secured by the Thayer and Noyes\u2019 circus .

Burke was born to an Irish-American family in Massachusetts on March 18, 1858.[1] By 1880 his mother had been widowed and the family had moved to Chicago and Burke had become a professional criminal. His brother, John \u201cFat Man\u201d Burke, claimed he was a plumber but he also worked as a professional criminal. Two of Burke's younger brothers held positions in the telegraph office.

Burke weathered the highs and lows of over five decades in show business, as well as a high-profile marriage to the notorious Florenz Ziegfeld. She once shared the formula for her longevity: \"To survive in Hollywood, you need the ambition of a Latin American revolutionary, the ego of a grand opera tenor and the physical stamina of a cow pony.\"\n\nBurke was born in Washington D.C. but at the age of eight followed her father's circus troupe\u2014Billy Burke's Barnum & Great London Circus Songsters\u2014to London, where she dutifully fulfilled her mother's wish that she become an actress. Borrowing her father's name, she made her first stage appearance in 1903 at the London Pavilion, singing \"Mamie, I Have a Little Canoe,\" in a show called The School Girl. A hit, the show ran for two years and brought Burke some celebrity and better roles, including parts in The Duchess of Dantzic, The Blue Moon, and Mrs. Ponderbury's Past. In 1907, theater impresario Charles Frohman brought her back to New York to co-star with John Drew in My Wife. The delicate-featured redhead soon became the toast of Broadway, with a string of admirers, including Mark Twain, Enrico Caruso, James Barrie and Somerset Maugham. It was Maugham who escorted her to a New Year's Eve party at the Astor Hotel where she met the renowned producer of the Follies, Florenz (Flo) Ziegfeld, who was newly divorced from actress Anna Held . Burke would later say of that first encounter: \"[E]ven if I had known then precisely what tortures and frustrations were in store for me during the next eighteen years because of this man, I should have kept right on falling in love.\" After a whirlwind courtship, the couple eloped (with Burke's mother in tow) and were married in the back room of a parsonage in Hoboken, New Jersey. After a weekend honeymoon, the newlyweds made their first home in a hotel room.\n\nIn 1915, film pioneer Thomas Ince offered Burke an unprecedented $300,000 to appear in the film Peggy. She accepted but turned down a subsequent five-year contract knowing that if she stayed in Hollywood her marriage would not survive. She finally signed on to do a number of silents with Famous Players-Lasky (Paramount) who were based in New York, where she could keep tabs on the philandering Ziegfeld.\n\nAfter the birth of their daughter in 1916, they moved into a house, Burkely Crest, in Hastings-on-Hudson, which Ziegfeld, a master of overkill, outfitted with a menagerie that included a herd of deer, two bears, two lion cubs, a variety of birds, an elephant, and later a pony that had been previously owned by the prince of Wales. The couple's lavish lifestyle included dinners for 40, nightly motion pictures, and camping trips to Canada that, according to Burke, \"closely resembled a rajah on safari with carpets, ices, cooks, and distinguished guests.\"\n\nAfter a series of silents, the best of which are considered In Pursuit of Polly, Good Gracious Annabelle!, and The Misleading Widow, Burke grew weary of the movies and returned to Broadway in such hits as Booth Tarkington's Intimate Strangers and Noel Coward's The Marquise. Mothering responsibilities and the illness of her own mother also occupied much of her time, as did continuing problems with Ziegfeld, who took up gambling and Marilyn Miller almost simultaneously. When the stock market crash of '29 and a string of failures on Broadway brought Ziegfeld close to financial disaster, Burke went back to work in earnest. Her first character role in Ivor Novello's play The Truth Game, followed by another in The Vinegar Tree, led to a new image for the actress as a scatterbrained comedienne.\n\nAfter Ziegfeld's death in 1932, the movies beckoned Burke once again, and she embarked on the second phase of her career, playing what she referred to as \"my silly women.\" \"These characters,\" she wrote, \"these bird-witted ladies whom I have characterized so often \u2026 derived from my part in The Vinegar Tree. I am neatly typed today, of course, possibly irrevocably typed, although I sincerely hope not, for I should like better parts.\"\n\nWith Bill of Divorcement considered her talkie debut, other memorable efforts of this period were Topper, its sequel Merrily We Live (which earned her an Academy Award nomination), and the role of Glinda in The Wizard of Oz. Burke cited Glinda as her favorite film part\u2014nearest to her stage roles. In 1936, she was an advisor on the film The Great Ziegfeld, in which she was portrayed by Myrna Loy . Burke tried a straight role in The Cheaters in 1945, but audiences did not want to take her seriously, perhaps because they'd grown accustomed to her comedy, perhaps because her voice, always slightly high pitched, became more \"birdy\" with age.\n\nIn 1949, Burke wrote the first of her memoirs, With a Feather on My Nose. By that time, she had moved to a modest home in West Los Angeles, next door to her daughter and three grandchildren. Still busy, she continued to work until her retirement in 1953, after which she was lured out for only a few plays in stock, including The Solid Gold Cadillac, and some very small movie roles. Her second autobiography, With Powder on My Nose, was published in 1959, 11 years before her death in 1970.\n\nsources:\n\nBurke, Billie. With a Feather on My Nose.

She is also remembered for her appearances in the Topper film series. Her unmistakable high-pitched, quivering and aristocratic voice, made her a frequent choice to play dimwitted or spoiled society types.She was married to Broadway producer and impresario Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. from 1914 until his death in 1932.Early lifeBurke was born in Washington, D.C., the daughter of Blanche (n\u00e9e Beatty) and her second husband, William \"Billy\" Ethelbert Burke. She toured the United States and Europe with her father, a singer and clown who worked for the Barnum & Bailey Circus. Her family settled in London where she attended plays in the West End. She began acting on stage in 1903, making her debut in London in The School Girl. Her other London shows included The Duchess of Dantzic (1903) and The Blue Moon (1904). She eventually returned to America to star in Broadway musical comedies.CareerBurke went on to play leads on Broadway in Mrs. Dot, Suzanne, The Runaway, The \"Mind-the-Paint\" Girl, and The Land of Promise from 1910 to 1913, along with a supporting role in the revival of Sir Arthur Wing Pinero's The Amazons. There she met producer Florenz Ziegfeld, marrying him in 1914. Two years later they had a daughter, author Patricia Ziegfeld Stephenson (1916\u20132008).Burke was signed for the movies and made her cinematic debut in the title role of Peggy (1915). Her success was phenomenal, and she was soon earning what was reputedly the highest salary of any film actress up to that time. She followed her first feature with the 15-part serial Gloria's Romance (1916), another popular and critically acclaimed vehicle. By 1917, she was a favorite with silent-movie fans, rivaling Mary Pickford, Lillian Gish, Clara Kimball Young and Irene Castle. She starred primarily in provocative society dramas and comedies, similar in theme to The \"Mind-the-Paint\" Girl, her most successful American play. Her girlish charm rivaled her acting ability, and as she dressed to the hilt in fashionable gowns, furs and jewelry, her clothes sense also won her the devotion of female audiences. Among the films in which she appeared during this period were Arms and the Girl (1917), The Mysterious Miss Terry, Let's Get a Divorce (1918), Good Gracious, Annabelle (1919), Away Goes Prudence (1920) and The Frisky Mrs. Johnson (1920). As a nod to himself for his wife appearing for Zukor and Lasky, Ziegfeld insisted on promotions for each of the films to carry the tag 'By Special Arrangement with Florenz Ziegfeld'.Burke's beauty and taste made her a major trendsetter throughout the 1910s and 20s. As early as 1909, following her Broadway performance in My Wife (1909), department stores began carrying the \"Billie Burke Dress\" with a signature flat collar and lace trim. During this time, much of Burke's on- and off-screen wardrobe was provided by the leading European couturier Lucile (in private life, Lady Duff Gordon), whose New York branch was the fashion Mecca of socialites and entertainment celebrities. Burke reflected on her reputation as \"a new kind of actress, carefree, and red-headed, and I had beautiful clothes.\"In 1916, Burke had a daughter. In 1917, Burke endorsed Pond\u2019s Vanishing Cream.Despite her success in film, Burke eventually returned to the stage, appearing in Caesar's Wife (1919), The Intimate Strangers (1921), The Marquise (1927) and The Happy Husband (1928).When the family's investments were wiped out in the Wall Street Crash the following year, she resumed screen acting to aid her husband.Burke made her Hollywood comeback in 1932, when she starred as Margaret Fairfield in A Bill of Divorcement, which was directed by George Cukor. She played Katharine Hepburn's mother in the film, which was Hepburn's debut. Despite the death of her husband Florenz Ziegfeld during the film's production, she resumed acting shortly after his funeral.In 1933, Burke was cast as Millicent Jordan, a scatterbrained high-society woman hosting a dinner party in the comedy Dinner at Eight, directed by George Cukor, co-starring with Lionel Barrymore, Marie Dressler, John Barrymore, Jean Harlow and Wallace Beery. The movie was a great success and revitalized her career. She subsequently starred in many comedies and musicals, typecast as a ditzy, feather-brained upper-class matron, with her high-pitched voice.In 1936, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer filmed a biopic of Florenz Ziegfeld (The Great Ziegfeld), a film that won Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Actress (Luise Rainer as Ziegfeld's common-law wife, Anna Held). William Powell played Ziegfeld and Myrna Loy played Burke; this infuriated Burke, who was under contract to the studio and believed she could have played herself, however, MGM considered her too old to cast in the part of her younger self.Burke appeared in Topper (1937) in which she played the twittering and puritanical Clara Topper, who is married to a man haunted by socialite ghosts played by Cary Grant and Constance Bennett. She returned to the role in the film's sequels. Her next performance as Emily Kilbourne in Merrily We Live (1938) resulted in her only Oscar nomination. In 1938, she was chosen to play Glinda the Good Witch of the North in the musical The Wizard of Oz (1939), directed by Victor Fleming, starring Judy Garland. She had previously worked with Garland in the film Everybody Sing, in which she played Judy's histrionically hysterical actress-mother. Director George Cukor offered her the role of Aunt Pittypat in Gone With the Wind (1939), but she declined it. The role went to Laura Hope Crews, in a performance that Cukor wanted to be played in a \"Billie Burke-ish manner\" with \"the same zany feeling\". Another successful film series followed with Father of the Bride (1950) and Father's Little Dividend (1951), both directed by Vincente Minnelli and starring Spencer Tracy, Joan Bennett, and Elizabeth Taylor. Burke also portrayed Mrs. Ernest (Daisy) Stanley in the 1942 film The Man Who Came to Dinner.Burke wrote two autobiographies, both with Cameron Shipp, With a Feather on My Nose (Appleton 1949) and With Powder on My Nose (Coward McCann, 1959).Radio and televisionOn CBS Radio, The Billie Burke Show was heard on Saturday mornings from April 3, 1943, until September 21, 1946. Sponsored by Listerine, this situation comedy was initially titled Fashions in Rations during its first year. Portraying herself as a featherbrained Good Samaritan who lived \"in the little white house on Sunnyview Lane,\" she always offered a helping hand to those in her neighborhood. She worked often in early television, appearing in the short-lived sitcom Doc Corkle (1952). She was a guest star on several TV and radio series, including Duffy's Tavern.On television, Burke starred in her own talk show, At Home With Billie Burke, which ran on the DuMont Television Network from June 1951 through the spring of 1952. She was one of the first female talk show hosts, after the hostesses of the earlier DuMont series And Everything Nice (1949\u201350) and Fashions on Parade (1948\u201349) which both included some talk show segments.Billie Burke starred in an adaptation of Dr. Heidegger's Experiment on the TV version of Lights Out on November 20, 1950.Return to stage and final filmBurke tried to make a comeback on the New York stage. She starred in two short-lived productions: This Rock and Mrs. January and Mr. X. Although she got good reviews, the plays did not. She also appeared in several plays in California, although her mind became clouded, and she had trouble remembering lines. In the late 1950s, her failing memory led to her retirement from show business, although her explanation at the time was, \"Acting just wasn't any fun anymore.\"Burke made her final screen appearance in Sergeant Rutledge (1960), a western directed by John Ford.Personal lifeAmong Burke's early suitors was the operatic tenor Enrico Caruso.In 1910, Burke bought the Kirkham estate on Broadway in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, and renamed the mansion, Burkeley Crest.In April 1914, Burke married Florenz Ziegfeld.In 1921, Burke retired to raise her daughter Patricia, but resumed work after the Wall Street Crash of 1929.In 1932, Burke moved from New York to Beverly Hills, California, after the death of Ziegfeld.Burke died in Los Angeles of natural causes on May 14, 1970, at the age of 85, and she was interred besideZiegfeld at Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, Westchester County, New York.LegacyFor many years, Burke's framed photo was displayed above the exit staircase at New York City's Ziegfeld Theatre, but it disappeared after renovations. An opening-night program bearing a picture of her from her 1912 triumph The Mind The Paint Girl (Sir Arthur Wing Pinero) is displayed in the lobby of the Lyceum Theatre in Manhattan.For her contributions to the film industry, Burke was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 with a motion pictures star at 6617 Hollywood Boulevard.The Academy Film Archive houses the Florenz Ziegfeld-Billie Burke Collection, which consists primarily of home movies.On November 4, 2015, the crater Burke, near the north pole of the planet Mercury, was named after Billie Burke.Performance careerRadioThe Ziegfeld Follies of the Air \u2013 1932Doubting Thomas - 1935Good News of 1939 \u2013 1938The Rudy Vallee Hour \u2013 1939The Gulf Screen Guild Theater \u2013 1939The Rudy Vallee Sealtest Show \u2013 1940\u201341The Pepsodent Show \u2013 1941The Billie Burke Show \u2013 1943\u20131946Duffy's Tavern \u2013 1944The Sealtest Village Store \u2013 1944Mail Call \u2013 1944The Charlie McCarthy Show \u2013 1944\u201347Tribute to Ethel Barrymore \u2013 1945The Rudy Vallee Show \u2013 1945Show Stoppers \u2013 1946The Danny Kaye Show \u2013 1946WOR 25th Anniversary \u2013 1947Your Movietown Radio Theatre \u2013 1948The Eddie Cantor Pabst Blue Ribbon Show \u2013 1948Family Theater \u2013 1948\u201352This Is Show Business \u2013 CBS-TV, 1949The Martin and Lewis Show \u2013 1949The Bill Stern Colgate Sports Newsreel \u2013 1949Stagestruck \u2013 1954Biography in Sound \u2013 1955\u201356BroadwayMy Wife \u2013 1907Love Watches \u2013 1908Mrs. Dot \u2013 1910Suzanne \u2013 1910The Philosopher in the Apple Orchard \u2013 1911The Runaway \u2013 1911The Amazons \u2013 1913The Land of Promise \u2013 1913Jerry \u2013 1914The Rescuing Angel \u2013 1917A Marriage of Convenience \u2013 1918Caesar's Wife \u2013 1919The Intimate Strangers (musical)|The Intimate Strangers \u2013 1921Rose Briar \u2013 1922Annie Dear \u2013 1924The Marquise \u2013 1927The Happy Husband \u2013 1928Family Affairs \u2013 1929The Truth Game \u2013 1930Ziegfeld Follies of 1934 \u2013 1934 (producer)Ziegfeld Follies of 1936 \u2013 1936 (producer)This Rock \u2013 1943Ziegfeld Follies of 1943 \u2013 1943 (producer)Mrs. January and Mr. X - 1944FilmographySee alsoAcademy of Music/Riviera TheatreList of actors with Academy Award nominationsReferencesFurther readingAlistair, Rupert (2018). \"Billie Burke\".

Tennessee had enacted a law that said it was \"unlawful to teach human evolution in any state-funded school\". William Jennings Bryan headed the prosecution and Clarence Darrow headed the defense. The teacher was found guilty and fined $100. An appeal to the Supreme Court of Tennessee upheld the law but overturned the guilty verdict.\n\nIn 1938, he was just 13 years old when on October 30th, a Sunday, The Mercury Theatre on the Air broadcast Orson Welles' special Halloween show The War of the World's. A clever take on H.G. Wells' novel, the show began with simulated \"breaking news\" of an invasion by Martians. Because of the realistic nature of the \"news,\" there was a public outcry the next day, calling for regulation by the FCC. Although the current story is that many were fooled and panicked, in reality very few people were fooled. But the show made Orson Welles' career.\n\nIn 1952, Billy was 27 years old when on July 2, Dr. Jonas E. Salk tested the first dead-virus polio vaccine on 43 children. The worst epidemic of polio had broken out that year - in the U.S. there were 58,000 cases reported. Of these, 3,145 people had died and 21,269 were left with mild to disabling paralysis.\n\nIn 1965, by the time he was 40 years old, from August 11 to 16, riots broke out in Watts, a Black section of Los Angeles. An allegedly drunk African-American driver was stopped by LA police and, after a fight, police brutality was alleged - and the riots began. 34 people died in the rioting and over $40 million in property damage occurred. The National Guard was called in to help the LA police quell rioting.\n\nIn 1989, in the year of Billy Burke's passing, on November 9th, the Berlin Wall fell. The Wall was built by the East Germans to keep East Berliners from escaping into West Berlin, separating families and friends. When the head of the East German Communist Party announced that day that East Berliners could cross whenever they pleased, happy crowds surged across the border. People brought tools and took parts of the hated wall."}, {"url": "https://happyhappybirthday.net/en/age/billy-burke-person_xyfaya", "page_content": "Billy Burke\n\nAmerican actor, musician \u2013 Billy Burke was born in Bellingham (city in, and the county seat of, Whatcom County in the State of Washington, United States) on November 25th, 1966 and is 56 years old today.\n\nAge How old is Billy Burke? 56 Billy Burke is 56 years old.\n\nBiographical data\n\nBilly Burke\n\nBirthday When was Billy Burke born?

Her father was a circus clown, and as a child she toured the United States and Europe with the circus (before motion pictures and after the stage, circuses were the biggest form of entertainment in the world). One could say that Billie was bred for show business. Her family ultimately settled in London, where she was fortunate to see plays in the city's historic West End, and decided she wanted to be a stage actress. At age 18, she made her stage debut and her career was off and running. Her performances were very well received and she became one of the most popular actresses to grace the stage. Broadway beckoned, and since New York City was now recognized as the stage capital of the world, it was there she would try her luck. Billie came to New York when she was 22 and her momentum did not stop. She appeared in numerous plays and it was only a matter of time before Hollywood came calling, which is exactly what happened. She made her film debut in the lead role in Peggy (1916). The film was a hit, but then again most films were, as the novelty of motion pictures had not worn off since The Great Train Robbery (1903) at the turn of the century. Later that year, she appeared in Gloria's Romance (1916). In between cinema work, she would take her place on the stage because not only was it her first love, but she had speaking parts. Billie considered herself more than an actress--she felt she was an artist, too. She believed that the stage was a way to personally reach out to an audience, something that could not be done in pictures. In 1921, she appeared as Elizabeth Banks in The Education of Elizabeth (1921), then she retired. She had wed impresario Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. of the famed Ziegfeld Follies and, with investments in the stock market, there was no need to work.What the Ziegfelds did not plan on was \"Black October\" in 1929. Their stock investments were wiped out in the crash, which precipitated the Great Depression, and Billie had no choice but to return to the screen. Movies had become even bigger than ten years earlier, especially since the introduction of sound. Her first role of substance was as Margaret Fairlfield in A Bill of Divorcement (1932). As an artist, she loved the fact that she had dialog, but she had to work even harder because her husband had died the same year as her speaking debut - and work she did. One of her career highlights came as Mrs. Millicent Jordan in David O. Selznick's Dinner at Eight (1933), co-starring Lionel Barrymore, Wallace Beery, John Barrymore and Jean Harlow - heady company to be sure, but Billie turned in an outstanding performance as Mrs. Jordan, the scatterbrained wife of a man whose shipping company is in financial trouble and who was trying to get someone to loan his company money to help stave off disaster. Her character loved to give dinner parties because a dinner affair at the Jordans had a reputation among New York blue-blood society as the highlight of the season. With all the drama and intrigue going on around her, her main concern is that she is one man short of having a full seating arrangement. The film was a hit and once again Billie was back on top. In 1937, she had one of her most fondly remembered roles in Topper (1937), a film that would ultimately spin off two sequels, and all three were box-office hits. In 1938, Billie received her first and only Academy Award nomination for her portrayal of Emily Kilbourne in Merrily We Live (1938). This was probably the best performance of her screen career, but she was destined to be immortalized forever in the classic The Wizard of Oz (1939). At 54 years of age - and not looking anywhere near it - she played Glinda, the Good Witch of the North. The 1940s saw Billie busier than ever--she made 25 films between 1940 and 1949. She made only six in the 1950s, as her aging became noticeable. She was 75 when she made her final screen appearance as Cordelia Fosgate in John Ford's Western Sergeant Rutledge (1960). Billie retired for good and lived in Los Angeles, California, where she died at age 85 of natural causes on May 14, 1970."}, {"url": "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Burke-2407", "page_content": "William Ethelbert (Billy) \"Billy\" Burke\n\n23 Oct 1843 in Waterford, Knox County, Ohio, USA Bornin\n\nAncestors\n\nDescendants\n\nMary William Ethelbert Appleton Burke Father of\n\n5 Oct 1906 at age 62 in Huddersfield, Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees, West Yorkshire, England Diedin\n\nProfile last modified 12 Oct 2021 | Created 20 May 2014\n\nThis page has been accessed 1,168 times.\n\n\n\n\n\nBiography\n\nAfter seeing action in the American Civil War where his 'cheerful songs and merry jokes\" made him the the \"life and soul\" of the camp.

Her father was a circus clown, and as a child she toured the United States and Europe with the circus (before motion pictures and after the stage, circuses were the biggest form of entertainment in the world). One could say that Billie was bred for show business. Her family ultimately settled in London, where she was fortunate to see plays in the city's historic West End, and decided she wanted to be a stage actress. At age 18, she made her stage debut and her career was off and running. Her performances were very well received and she became one of the most popular actresses to grace the stage. Broadway beckoned, and since New York City was now recognized as the stage capital of the world, it was there she would try her luck. Billie came to New York when she was 22 and her momentum did not stop. She appeared in numerous plays and it was only a matter of time before Hollywood came calling, which is exactly what happened. She made her film debut in the lead role in Peggy (1916). The film was a hit, but then again most films were, as the novelty of motion pictures had not worn off since The Great Train Robbery (1903) at the turn of the century. Later that year, she appeared in Gloria's Romance (1916). In between cinema work, she would take her place on the stage because not only was it her first love, but she had speaking parts. Billie considered herself more than an actress--she felt she was an artist, too. She believed that the stage was a way to personally reach out to an audience, something that could not be done in pictures. In 1921, she appeared as Elizabeth Banks in The Education of Elizabeth (1921), then she retired. She had wed impresario Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. of the famed Ziegfeld Follies and, with investments in the stock market, there was no need to work.What the Ziegfelds did not plan on was \"Black October\" in 1929. Their stock investments were wiped out in the crash, which precipitated the Great Depression, and Billie had no choice but to return to the screen. Movies had become even bigger than ten years earlier, especially since the introduction of sound. Her first role of substance was as Margaret Fairlfield in A Bill of Divorcement (1932). As an artist, she loved the fact that she had dialog, but she had to work even harder because her husband had died the same year as her speaking debut - and work she did. One of her career highlights came as Mrs. Millicent Jordan in David O. Selznick's Dinner at Eight (1933), co-starring Lionel Barrymore, Wallace Beery, John Barrymore and Jean Harlow - heady company to be sure, but Billie turned in an outstanding performance as Mrs. Jordan, the scatterbrained wife of a man whose shipping company is in financial trouble and who was trying to get someone to loan his company money to help stave off disaster. Her character loved to give dinner parties because a dinner affair at the Jordans had a reputation among New York blue-blood society as the highlight of the season. With all the drama and intrigue going on around her, her main concern is that she is one man short of having a full seating arrangement. The film was a hit and once again Billie was back on top. In 1937, she had one of her most fondly remembered roles in Topper (1937), a film that would ultimately spin off two sequels, and all three were box-office hits.

The sculpture honored the firefighters, police officers and other emergency workers who responded - often at the cost of their own lives - to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Burke and Berry are siblings of Capt. Billy Burke Jr., who chose to stay in the north tower - just before it collapsed - with two stranded civilians, including a man in a wheelchair.\n\n(Dennis Nett | dnett@syracuse.com)\n\nGregg Hansson and Billy Burke met only once. That was 10 years ago this morning \u2014 Sept. 11, 2001 \u2014 near an elevator on the 27th floor of the north tower of the World Trade Center. Hansson was a lieutenant in the Fire Department of New York. He was looking for one of his firefighters, ordered by Hansson to watch over two stranded office workers from Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield.\n\nHansson did not expect to find Burke, a captain and a superior officer, with this little group of men. They spoke for a matter of seconds. A decision was made, as much by a nod and body language as by words themselves. Burke assumed command of the civilians, while Hansson and his men resumed their harrowing journey down a stairwell. Hansson is now a captain. What he didn\u2019t realize then is always with him now:\n\nBilly Burke, he said, sacrificed his own life to save theirs.\n\n\u201cI have moments in the past 10 years when I tend to reflect, and I think the biggest and toughest one is me and my guys being alive, and Billy\u2019s not,\u201d Hansson said.\n\nThe north tower was burning. At 8:46 a.m., hijackers had steered American Airlines Flight 11 into the building, touching off a fire hot enough to make steel run like butter. Sixteen minutes later, a second plane hit the building\u2019s twin. Most workers, at least those fortunate enough to have jobs beneath the flames, were on their way down or were already out. Refusing to leave the north tower was Abe Zelmanowitz, an employee of Blue Cross. Zelmanowitz made his own heroic decision: He would not go down without his colleague, Ed Beyea, a paraplegic whose wheelchair left him without any obvious way to escape.\n\nThe two civilians were discovered by Hansson and his men as they made their way upstairs, checking every floor. Even for veteran firefighters, Beyea presented a logistical problem: He was a big man. An elevator could become a death trap. And it would be a long and difficult walk to the bottom of the tower. Hansson, not yet worried about the building coming down, thought he had time to figure it out. He assigned a firefighter named Rich Billy to stay with the civilians on the 27th floor, and Hansson and his men kept going up.\n\nEverything changed when they reached the floors in the upper 30s. They endured a moment of sickening terror: The building \u2014 one of the tallest in the world \u2014 shook and swayed like a flimsy wooden bridge in a big wind. Abruptly, the structure seemed to steady itself.\n\nA voice on a firefighter's radio cried \u201cMayday!\u201d To Hansson, that meant one thing: Get out.\n\nAmong the firefighters scattered on those floors, only a few knew what had caused the building to shake \u2014 and why they needed to evacuate, and fast.\n\nBilly Burke, at 46, fully understood. Minutes before encountering Hansson at the elevator, Burke and another fire captain, Jay Jonas, had been searching other sections of the 27th floor when the building shook. Once it stopped, the two captains ran to windows at opposite ends of the floor, then sprinted back to meet in the middle.\n\n\u201cIs that what I thought it was?\u201d Jonas asked.\n\n\u201cThe south tower just collapsed,\u201d Burke replied.\n\nAs it fell, that 110-floor building sent a shock wave through its twin. Jonas called out to his men and hurried toward a stairwell. He thought Burke, an old friend, was just behind him. Roughly 28 minutes later, Jonas and the others would survive the collapse of the north tower. They were in a stairwell that formed a protective bubble against the overwhelming torrent of debris. Stunned, covered in dust and rubble, Jonas looked for Billy Burke among the survivors.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t there. Eventually, Jonas would learn that Burke \u2014 moved by some rescuer\u2019s intuition \u2014 never left the 27th floor. A captain with Engine 21, Burke had already ordered his own men to go downstairs to safety. Months later, firefighter Michael Byrne \u2014 one of Burke\u2019s men \u2014 would offer testimony to the World Trade Center Task Force. Byrne would recall how Burke brought the company upstairs, a few men at a time, on one of the few working elevators. They reached the 24th floor, then climbed to the 27th.\n\nWhen the building shook, Burke commanded his men to get out. The order almost certainly saved their lives. They would survive, while Byrne recalled how his captain kept promising by radio he\u2019d \u201cmeet (them) at the rig.\u201d\n\nIt was Hansson, back on the 27th floor, who had one final conversation with Burke.\n\n\u00bb Complete coverage of Sept. 11 memorials and news on syracuse.com.\n\nThey met at the elevator, where Burke \u2014 in his search \u2014 had already come upon the two civilians. They spoke briefly about whether it might be safe to try the elevator. Burke, who knew the south tower was already gone, had made his way upstairs on an elevator \u2014 and undoubtedly understood they lacked the time to carry Beyea, in his wheelchair, down the stairs. Hansson, who\u2019d seen what fireballs did to elevators on the lower floors, said using one wasn\u2019t worth the chance.\n\nIn that instant, Burke took charge of the two civilians \u2014 freeing Hansson to gather his own men and descend.\n\n\u201cThere was an urgency in our footsteps,\u201d Hansson recalls. Sometimes he wonders if he should have argued with Burke and tried to stay. But they had a long way to go, with no guarantee they would survive, and Burke \u2014 despite the desperate situation \u2014 never told them he had already sent his own company downstairs.\n\nA friend to many\n\nWhile Billy Burke loved his home in Manhattan, he was a regular visitor to Central New York. His older sister, Dr. Elizabeth Berry, is on the staff at Crouse Hospital. A younger brother, Chris, is a lawyer with Syracuse University. Of the many qualities Burke\u2019s siblings admired in their brother, nothing astounded them quite as much as his gift for remaining close to his many old girlfriends without threatening the new men in their lives.\n\n\u201cHe was very outgoing, very warm, very irresistible, with a big smile and blue eyes that were hard to resist,\u201d said Jean Traina, an art director who for two decades designed book covers in New York City, where she often shifted between romance and a profound friendship with Burke.\n\n\u201cWe never stopped loving each other,\u201d she said, and Sept. 11 offered deep proof of that bond.\n\nAs Burke and his company responded to the fire, it was Traina whom Burke chose to call four times. He warned her repeatedly to stay in her home. He asked her to tell his family he was all right. On the last call, when she screamed at him to stay away from the trade center, he simply lied to her \u2014 saying he was outside when he must have been in the north tower. She vividly recalls his last words on the phone:\n\n\u201cThis is what I do.\u201d\n\nFrom Burke\u2019s perspective, he was born into the job. The second child in a family of six, he was the son of a deputy chief in New York. His father did not want his children in the same profession \u2014 he\u2019d retired at 64, Berry said, worn down \u201cby stress and smoke\u201d \u2014 but Burke dreamed since childhood of fighting fires. Berry said her brother never forgot the lessons their dad offered about what to do inside a burning building: Get the civilians out, and then take care of your men.\n\nBurke saw that as a family code, even as two of the world\u2019s tallest buildings melted down.\n\nIt would be easy, then, to portray Burke as a one-dimensional lady\u2019s man, a kind of Hollywood version of a firefighting hero, except for how profoundly that would misrepresent his essence. Women were drawn to him, yes, but Berry said her brother\u2019s looks were only part of the attraction. He was \u201cmultifaceted,\u201d Berry said, \u201cliterally one of the smartest people I\u2019ve ever met in my life.\u201d\n\nBurke was a tremendous reader and a skilled photographer. He had written short stories, and he dreamed out loud about teaching literature at a small college. He was also an expert on the Civil War. Berry said he had enough passion and knowledge to lead informal tours of the battlefield at Gettysburg.\n\nHe gathered a vast circle of friends through loyalty and an endless willingness to share his time. During his undergraduate days at SUNY Potsdam, he worked up the nerve to ask out Gwen Webber-McLeod, now a businesswoman in Auburn. \u201cI had an amazing relationship with Capt. William F. Burke,\u201d she said last week. Webber-McLeod, who is African-American, describes the Irish-Catholic Burke as her \u201cfirst love.\u201d Interracial dating was hardly the norm in the early 1970s, but they stayed close even after they let go of their romance.\n\nIn 1995 \u2014 when Webber-McLeod and her husband, Tracy McLeod, learned their daughter Ashley had leukemia \u2014 Burke again became a presence. He made monthly calls to check on Ashley as the girl went through treatment and beat the disease, calls that would continue for as long as Burke lived.\n\nThat behavior was typical, said Traina, Burke\u2019s longtime companion in New York: After Traina discovered she had breast cancer, Burke was at her side during her chemotherapy. Traina and Berry also recall a little tavern in Manhattan where Burke loved to have a beer, a place owned by an old woman named Elsie.\n\nCapt. Billy Burke: Image found on a roll of film in his locker, by his family.\n\nBurke revered her. One night, he stopped in and was told she\u2019d grown too ill to tend bar. Burke, upset, made a few calls. He learned Elsie had been sent to a nursing home. Until she died, Burke was a regular visitor.\n\n\u201cHe was our oldest brother,\u201d said Chris Burke, the Syracuse lawyer, \u201cand in life he always fulfilled that role.\u201d Chris has a twin, Michael, who lives in New York. They were 18 months younger than Billy. The boys had plenty of brawls when they were young, but when it counted, Chris said, their brother always showed up.\n\nChris recalled how Billy was a center of attention in high school, a star swimmer with head-turning good looks. He was the guy every cheerleader wanted to date, the guy every other boy wanted to be. Yet he made a point of befriending smart and quirky outcasts who otherwise would have been targets of ridicule, Chris said.\n\n\u201cI remember he had this one friend, this little guy who didn\u2019t fit in, and the important thing was the way Billy never made him feel that way,\u201d Chris said. \u201cThe friendship was real. There was no contempt. He was just a guy who was always taking care of someone else.\u201d\n\nSometimes, before Chris falls asleep at night, he thinks back to an autumn morning when he and Michael were seventh-graders, part of the youngest class at their new middle school. In the auditorium, an older kid pulled a pen from Michael\u2019s pocket and threw it into a crowd of ninth-graders. The pen struck an older, much larger boy. Michael went to get it, and the kid gave him a hard shove. For a moment, the situation did not look good for Michael.\n\n\u201cThe next thing, all you see is Billy coming through,\u201d Chris said. \u201cHe gives the kid a right across the jaw, and the kid goes down like a ton of bricks.\u201d\n\nChris choked up. He could not finish the tale. This was a big brother he describes as \u201cbigger than life,\u201d a big brother who \u2014 in difficult moments \u2014 always did what the rest of us hope that we would do.\n\n'He saved all of us'\n\nOn the 27th floor of the north tower, Hansson and Burke parted ways. Burke had taken over with the civilians, leaving Hansson and his company to descend in a stairwell, still wearing the heavy gear they\u2019d brought into the tower.\n\nHansson, with four of his men, began taking the stairs two at a time, checking at every door for civilian stragglers. On the fifth floor, they came upon an office worker too tired to go on under his own power. \u201cHe was a large guy,\u201d Hansson said, \u201cand we were literally exhausted.\u201d The little company refused to leave the civilian behind. They used a belt to strap the man into an office chair, and they did their best to carry him downstairs.\n\nIt didn\u2019t work. \u201cThe chair collapsed from his weight,\u201d Hansson said. The firefighters, sensing in some primal way that their time was almost gone, grabbed the man and began pulling him down the stairs. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest,\u201d Hansson said. \u201cWe gave him a rough ride.\u201d They finally emerged at a mezzanine, where Hansson said several police officers had managed to force open a locked door.\n\nWithout that exit, the little group would have needed to find another way out. Without that exit, Hansson is sure they would be dead. He can still describe what happened, as if he sees it playing out in front of him, once they began a desperate sprint across an outdoor plaza, toward the overhang of the nearby Custom House:\n\n\u201cThey led us out that door, on the north side of the building, and we\u2019ve still got this guy by the legs, and we look around and I think: \u2018This is hell, what we\u2019re in right now.\u2019 There\u2019s debris all over the place, and I hadn\u2019t known people were jumping (from the upper floors) and we\u2019re dodging them, and I threw down my mask and we\u2019re just running. Then all of a sudden we hear this sound, this roar, and we feel like a plane is coming down on top of us .... I thought it was an explosion ..... and we go from whiteout to blackout just like that, in a second.\n\nEngine 21: The damaged firetruck that carried Capt. Billy Burke and his fellow firefighters to the World Trade Center serves as a permanent tribute at the National Sept. 11 Memorial Museum.\n\n\u201cThe building was coming down. It was deafening and you thought it was a shock wave and obviously it was the building forcing all the air into the hole, and I said a prayer and asked God to take me quick, and I got into a fetal position. All these rocks were hitting me \u2014 I felt like it was a machine gun of rocks \u2014 and in 10 seconds or so it was over. I opened my eyes and there were pockets of fire in the courtyard and holes all over the place and I had no mask and I was choking with all the smoke and dust. I had no idea what happened, and I just thought I\u2019ve got to get over to my guys ...\u201d\n\nThey had survived, as did the big man they rescued. The building, with catastrophic force, had disappeared only seconds after they ran out the door. Life or death, Hansson said, came down to one decision by a captain on the 27th floor:\n\n\u201cBill Burke\u2019s presence \u2014 and his actions \u2014 saved all of us.\u201d\n\nAs for Burke, he and the two civilians almost certainly died together. No one can be sure what was in his mind. Maybe he intended to gamble on the elevators, and he saw no reason for other firefighters to share in that risk. Maybe he understood a harsher truth: There would be no time to get a big man in a wheelchair downstairs, and Billy Burke wanted to save as many firefighters as he could \u2014 while refusing to allow Beyea and Zelmanowitz to die alone.\n\nWhat is certain is that by ordering his own men to leave the building \u2014 and by taking charge of the civilians, which set Hansson free to go \u2014 Burke saved his own company, and Hansson\u2019s men, and the office worker they rescued on the fifth floor.\n\nBurke\u2019s family and closest friends knew none of that in the hours after the towers fell. Burke had told Jean Traina he was safely outside the building, leaving her to nurture the hope he had survived. \u201cThis was Billy,\u201d said Chris Burke. \u201cYou figured he\u2019d get out, because he always did. You figured he\u2019d rise from the void on the third day, walk out of there and ask you to buy him a beer, then ask the prettiest girl in the room for her number.\u201d\n\nInstead, silence became finality. Traina, in a city where the dust of what was lost came down like snow, secluded herself in her apartment. It was only in the following weeks \u2014 as disconnected accounts were drawn together as one story \u2014 that she and so many others who loved Burke began to comprehend the full measure of his choice.\n\nChris Burke has spent 10 years, in quiet moments, reflecting on the deaths of thousands in the attacks. While the pain does not recede, he has come to see a hard beauty in the decision by his brother on the 27th floor.\n\n\u201cStaying behind with civilians? Getting his men out first? You wouldn\u2019t expect anything less,\u201d Chris said. \u201cThat comes straight from our father, from our parents. He knew what was happening. He knew that thing had minutes left before it would collapse. He chose to stay. I think about it, and in my own life \u2014 with my wife and kids \u2014 you hope to carry on that sense of honor and devotion.\u201d\n\nGregg Hansson, too, cannot forget. For him, at all times, the great tower falls behind him, offering a roar that chokes off air and shakes the earth. He is haunted by the idea that he should have argued about who was in charge of those civilians \u2014 even though Hansson was outranked, even though he knows what his fate would have been if he had stayed.\n\nNot long ago, he dropped off his stepson for his freshman year of college. It was the kind of day that is emotional for any family, a powerful yet typical rite of passage, but for Hansson nothing again can ever be typical. He gave the boy a fierce hug and said goodbye, and in that simple act of love he offered thanks to Billy Burke.\n\n\n\nSean Kirst is a columnist with The Post-Standard.

She is best known to modern audiences as Glinda the Good Witch of the North in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer movie musical The Wizard of Oz (1939).Burke was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Emily Kilbourne in Merrily We Live (1938). She is also remembered for her appearances in the Topper film series. Her unmistakable high-pitched, quivering and aristocratic voice, made her a frequent choice to play dimwitted or spoiled society types.She was married to Broadway producer and impresario Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. from 1914 until his death in 1932.Early lifeBurke was born in Washington, D.C., the daughter of Blanche (n\u00e9e Beatty) and her second husband, William \"Billy\" Ethelbert Burke. She toured the United States and Europe with her father, a singer and clown who worked for the Barnum & Bailey Circus. Her family settled in London where she attended plays in the West End. She began acting on stage in 1903, making her debut in London in The School Girl. Her other London shows included The Duchess of Dantzic (1903) and The Blue Moon (1904). She eventually returned to America to star in Broadway musical comedies.CareerBurke went on to play leads on Broadway in Mrs. Dot, Suzanne, The Runaway, The \"Mind-the-Paint\" Girl, and The Land of Promise from 1910 to 1913, along with a supporting role in the revival of Sir Arthur Wing Pinero's The Amazons. There she met producer Florenz Ziegfeld, marrying him in 1914. Two years later they had a daughter, author Patricia Ziegfeld Stephenson (1916\u20132008).Burke was signed for the movies and made her cinematic debut in the title role of Peggy (1915). Her success was phenomenal, and she was soon earning what was reputedly the highest salary of any film actress up to that time. She followed her first feature with the 15-part serial Gloria's Romance (1916), another popular and critically acclaimed vehicle. By 1917, she was a favorite with silent-movie fans, rivaling Mary Pickford, Lillian Gish, Clara Kimball Young and Irene Castle. She starred primarily in provocative society dramas and comedies, similar in theme to The \"Mind-the-Paint\" Girl, her most successful American play. Her girlish charm rivaled her acting ability, and as she dressed to the hilt in fashionable gowns, furs and jewelry, her clothes sense also won her the devotion of female audiences. Among the films in which she appeared during this period were Arms and the Girl (1917), The Mysterious Miss Terry, Let's Get a Divorce (1918), Good Gracious, Annabelle (1919), Away Goes Prudence (1920) and The Frisky Mrs. Johnson (1920). As a nod to himself for his wife appearing for Zukor and Lasky, Ziegfeld insisted on promotions for each of the films to carry the tag 'By Special Arrangement with Florenz Ziegfeld'.Burke's beauty and taste made her a major trendsetter throughout the 1910s and 20s. As early as 1909, following her Broadway performance in My Wife (1909), department stores began carrying the \"Billie Burke Dress\" with a signature flat collar and lace trim. During this time, much of Burke's on- and off-screen wardrobe was provided by the leading European couturier Lucile (in private life, Lady Duff Gordon), whose New York branch was the fashion Mecca of socialites and entertainment celebrities. Burke reflected on her reputation as \"a new kind of actress, carefree, and red-headed, and I had beautiful clothes.\"In 1916, Burke had a daughter. In 1917, Burke endorsed Pond\u2019s Vanishing Cream.Despite her success in film, Burke eventually returned to the stage, appearing in Caesar's Wife (1919), The Intimate Strangers (1921), The Marquise (1927) and The Happy Husband (1928).When the family's investments were wiped out in the Wall Street Crash the following year, she resumed screen acting to aid her husband.Burke made her Hollywood comeback in 1932, when she starred as Margaret Fairfield in A Bill of Divorcement, which was directed by George Cukor. She played Katharine Hepburn's mother in the film, which was Hepburn's debut. Despite the death of her husband Florenz Ziegfeld during the film's production, she resumed acting shortly after his funeral.In 1933, Burke was cast as Millicent Jordan, a scatterbrained high-society woman hosting a dinner party in the comedy Dinner at Eight, directed by George Cukor, co-starring with Lionel Barrymore, Marie Dressler, John Barrymore, Jean Harlow and Wallace Beery. The movie was a great success and revitalized her career. She subsequently starred in many comedies and musicals, typecast as a ditzy, feather-brained upper-class matron, with her high-pitched voice.In 1936, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer filmed a biopic of Florenz Ziegfeld (The Great Ziegfeld), a film that won Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Actress (Luise Rainer as Ziegfeld's common-law wife, Anna Held). William Powell played Ziegfeld and Myrna Loy played Burke; this infuriated Burke, who was under contract to the studio and believed she could have played herself, however, MGM considered her too old to cast in the part of her younger self.Burke appeared in Topper (1937) in which she played the twittering and puritanical Clara Topper, who is married to a man haunted by socialite ghosts played by Cary Grant and Constance Bennett. She returned to the role in the film's sequels. Her next performance as Emily Kilbourne in Merrily We Live (1938) resulted in her only Oscar nomination. In 1938, she was chosen to play Glinda the Good Witch of the North in the musical The Wizard of Oz (1939), directed by Victor Fleming, starring Judy Garland. She had previously worked with Garland in the film Everybody Sing, in which she played Judy's histrionically hysterical actress-mother. Director George Cukor offered her the role of Aunt Pittypat in Gone With the Wind (1939), but she declined it. The role went to Laura Hope Crews, in a performance that Cukor wanted to be played in a \"Billie Burke-ish manner\" with \"the same zany feeling\". Another successful film series followed with Father of the Bride (1950) and Father's Little Dividend (1951), both directed by Vincente Minnelli and starring Spencer Tracy, Joan Bennett, and Elizabeth Taylor. Burke also portrayed Mrs. Ernest (Daisy) Stanley in the 1942 film The Man Who Came to Dinner.Burke wrote two autobiographies, both with Cameron Shipp, With a Feather on My Nose (Appleton 1949) and With Powder on My Nose (Coward McCann, 1959).Radio and televisionOn CBS Radio, The Billie Burke Show was heard on Saturday mornings from April 3, 1943, until September 21, 1946. Sponsored by Listerine, this situation comedy was initially titled Fashions in Rations during its first year. Portraying herself as a featherbrained Good Samaritan who lived \"in the little white house on Sunnyview Lane,\" she always offered a helping hand to those in her neighborhood. She worked often in early television, appearing in the short-lived sitcom Doc Corkle (1952). She was a guest star on several TV and radio series, including Duffy's Tavern.On television, Burke starred in her own talk show, At Home With Billie Burke, which ran on the DuMont Television Network from June 1951 through the spring of 1952. She was one of the first female talk show hosts, after the hostesses of the earlier DuMont series And Everything Nice (1949\u201350) and Fashions on Parade (1948\u201349) which both included some talk show segments.Billie Burke starred in an adaptation of Dr. Heidegger's Experiment on the TV version of Lights Out on November 20, 1950.Return to stage and final filmBurke tried to make a comeback on the New York stage. She starred in two short-lived productions: This Rock and Mrs. January and Mr. X. Although she got good reviews, the plays did not. She also appeared in several plays in California, although her mind became clouded, and she had trouble remembering lines. In the late 1950s, her failing memory led to her retirement from show business, although her explanation at the time was, \"Acting just wasn't any fun anymore.\"Burke made her final screen appearance in Sergeant Rutledge (1960), a western directed by John Ford.Personal lifeAmong Burke's early suitors was the operatic tenor Enrico Caruso.In 1910, Burke bought the Kirkham estate on Broadway in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, and renamed the mansion, Burkeley Crest.In April 1914, Burke married Florenz Ziegfeld.In 1921, Burke retired to raise her daughter Patricia, but resumed work after the Wall Street Crash of 1929.In 1932, Burke moved from New York to Beverly Hills, California, after the death of Ziegfeld.Burke died in Los Angeles of natural causes on May 14, 1970, at the age of 85, and she was interred besideZiegfeld at Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, Westchester County, New York.LegacyFor many years, Burke's framed photo was displayed above the exit staircase at New York City's Ziegfeld Theatre, but it disappeared after renovations. An opening-night program bearing a picture of her from her 1912 triumph The Mind The Paint Girl (Sir Arthur Wing Pinero) is displayed in the lobby of the Lyceum Theatre in Manhattan.For her contributions to the film industry, Burke was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 with a motion pictures star at 6617 Hollywood Boulevard.The Academy Film Archive houses the Florenz Ziegfeld-Billie Burke Collection, which consists primarily of home movies.On November 4, 2015, the crater Burke, near the north pole of the planet Mercury, was named after Billie Burke.Performance careerRadioThe Ziegfeld Follies of the Air \u2013 1932Doubting Thomas - 1935Good News of 1939 \u2013 1938The Rudy Vallee Hour \u2013 1939The Gulf Screen Guild Theater \u2013 1939The Rudy Vallee Sealtest Show \u2013 1940\u201341The Pepsodent Show \u2013 1941The Billie Burke Show \u2013 1943\u20131946Duffy's Tavern \u2013 1944The Sealtest Village Store \u2013 1944Mail Call \u2013 1944The Charlie McCarthy Show \u2013 1944\u201347Tribute to Ethel Barrymore \u2013 1945The Rudy Vallee Show \u2013 1945Show Stoppers \u2013 1946The Danny Kaye Show \u2013 1946WOR 25th Anniversary \u2013 1947Your Movietown Radio Theatre \u2013 1948The Eddie Cantor Pabst Blue Ribbon Show \u2013 1948Family Theater \u2013 1948\u201352This Is Show Business \u2013 CBS-TV, 1949The Martin and Lewis Show \u2013 1949The Bill Stern Colgate Sports Newsreel \u2013 1949Stagestruck \u2013 1954Biography in Sound \u2013 1955\u201356BroadwayMy Wife \u2013 1907Love Watches \u2013 1908Mrs. Dot \u2013 1910Suzanne \u2013 1910The Philosopher in the Apple Orchard \u2013 1911The Runaway \u2013 1911The Amazons \u2013 1913The Land of Promise \u2013 1913Jerry \u2013 1914The Rescuing Angel \u2013 1917A Marriage of Convenience \u2013 1918Caesar's Wife \u2013 1919The Intimate Strangers (musical)|The Intimate Strangers \u2013 1921Rose Briar \u2013 1922Annie Dear \u2013 1924The Marquise \u2013 1927The Happy Husband \u2013 1928Family Affairs \u2013 1929The Truth Game \u2013 1930Ziegfeld Follies of 1934 \u2013 1934 (producer)Ziegfeld Follies of 1936 \u2013 1936 (producer)This Rock \u2013 1943Ziegfeld Follies of 1943 \u2013 1943 (producer)Mrs. January and Mr. X - 1944FilmographySee alsoAcademy of Music/Riviera TheatreList of actors with Academy Award nominationsReferencesFurther readingAlistair, Rupert (2018). \"Billie Burke\".

He's most famous because he played in, and won, the longest playoff in major championship history: 72 playoff holes.\n\nFull name: William John Burke (birth name Burkowski)\n\nDate of birth: December 14, 1902\n\nPlace of birth: Naugatuck, Connecticut\n\nDate and place of death: April 19, 1972 in Clearwater, Florida\n\nBurke's PGA Tour Wins\n\n1927 Florida Open\n\n1927 Central Florida Open\n\n1928 North and South Open\n\n1929 New York State Open\n\n1929 Glens Falls Open\n\n1930 Mid South Open\n\n1931 U.S. Open\n\n1931 Glens Falls Open\n\n1932 Florida West Coast Open\n\n1935 The Cascades Open\n\n1936 Centennial Open\n\n1939 Walter Hagen 25th Anniversary*\n\n1940 Miami Biltmore International Four-Ball*\n\nBurke is credited with wins in 13 tournaments that are now counted by the PGA Tour as official tour wins:*These two were two-man team tournaments. At the 1939 Hagen, Burke partnered with Ed Dudley . At the 1940 Miami International, his partner was Craig Wood\n\nIn the Majors\n\nHis victory in the 1931 U.S. Open (more on that to come) was Burke's lone win in a major championship. And he never played in the British Open. His best other finishes were third places in the 1934 Masters and in the 1939 Masters ; plus he reached the semifinals in the 1931 PGA Championship\n\nOverall, Burke had six Top 10s in majors. The first major he played in was the 1928 U.S. Open, and he last played in a major in the 1961 Masters.\n\nHis Epic 1931 U.S. Win\n\nNot only did Burke win the 1931 U.S. Open , he won it playing with steel-shafted golf clubs. He was the first golfer to win the U.S. Open with steel shafts.\n\nOh, and then there was that 72-hole playoff. This Open was played at Inverness in Ohio, scheduled to end on July 4. The weather was brutal with temperatures in the 90s, some days approaching 100 \u2014 the 1931 U.S. Open is sometimes remembered as \"the Inferno at Inverness.\"\n\nBurke opened with a 73, two off the lead. In the second round, he shot 72 and moved to within one of leader George Von Elm. Von Elm was the tour's leading money winner heading into this tournament.\n\nOn the third day they played 36 holes, the third and fourth rounds. Von Elm's lead over second-place Burke was two following the third round. But Burke took the lead in Round 4, until Von Elm made a 10-foot putt to tie him on the 72nd hole.\n\nFor the first time, the USGA used a 36-hole playoff to decide its Open champion. The only problem was that Burke and Von Elm ended the 36-hole playoff day tied again, and again after Von Elm made a 10-footer on the final hole to tie. They both carded 149s.\n\nSo the next day, they came back and did it all again, their third consecutive day playing 36 holes. And this 36 holes was just like the previous two: tight throughtout. In fact, Burke and Von Elm traded the lead 25 times over the final 36.\n\nIn the end, after 72 holes of regular play and 72 more playoff holes, Burke won by a single stroke. He won the second playoff 148 to 149.\n\nThe USGA reacted to this epic battle \u2014 one literally hotly contested in July \u2014 two ways: It moved the U.S. Open from July back to June to try to reduce the heat; and it eliminated 36-hole playoffs, going back to 18-hole playoffs.\n\nMore About Billy Burke\n\nBurke was the son of Polish immigrants to American from Lithuania (the family name was Burkauskas, which was polonized to Burkowski, then anglicized to Burke). Billy began playing golf at age 12 after first starting caddying.\n\nAs a teenager, Burke went to work in the same iron foundry in which his father worked. But an accident there took off Burke's ring finger on his left hand, plus part of his left pinkie. After that, he had to rebuild his golf grip to work for him despite those missing fingers.\n\nIt didn't much slow Burke's progress as a golfer. After a hard day in the foundry, Burke headed to the driving range to practice. In Connecticut golf circles, they started calling him \"the Boy Marvel\" for his golf prowess.\n\nWhen he was 18, Burke first entered the Connecticut State Amateur. The only problem was he didn't own the clothes (such as plus-fours) to meet the dress standard for that big event. His dilemma received local media attention, and two local golfers Burke caddied for stepped up to outfit him with new golf clothes and pay his fare to the tournament.\n\nIn 1923, when he was 20, Burke made it to the championship match of the Connecticut State Amateur before losing to Henry Topping. But it turned out to be a great loss for Burke: Topping was a millionaire businessman who became an ongoing benefactor for Burke's golf career, including staking him when he shortly turned pro to try the PGA Tour.\n\nBurke began winning pro tour events in the late 1920s (the 1927 Florida Open is credited as his first tour win). His final tour win was in 1940.\n\nBurke also won other tournaments that are not counted as PGA Tour events, including the Ohio Open four times: 1938, 1939, 1945 and lastly in 1955 at the age of 52.\n\nThe year of 1931 was one of three in which he won twice on tour (1927 and 1929 being the other two), but it was without question his best year. It included his only major championship win at the U.S. Open, plus he reached the semifinals in the PGA Championship. Burke made the first of two appearances on Team USA in the Ryder Cup that year, winning both matches he played. (He also played in the 1933 Ryder Cup.)\n\nAnd Burke got married that year to Marguerite, who survived him when he died at age 69 in 1972.\n\nLater in 1931, Burke and George Von Elm, off the hoopla surrounding their 72-hole playoff, went on an exhibition tour together.\n\nAlong the way, Burke also worked as a club pro and was noted as a golf instructor. He was pro for 29 years, beginning in 1934, at Cleveland (Ohio) Country Club. From 1946-62, he was the winter-season pro at Clearwater (Fla.) Country Club. Burke also taught at the 9-hole course in his hometown of Naugatuck, Conn., as well as in Dark Harbor, Maine. In addition, Burke had endorsement deals with sports equipment companies and Billy Burke-branded golf clubs and golf balls were both produced during his heyday.\n\nBurke was inducted into the PGA Hall of Fame in 1966."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/21/archives/billy-burke-golfer-who-won-open-in-31.html", "page_content": "CLEARWATER, Fla., April 20 (UPI)\u2014Billy Burke, the professional golfer, died here yesterday after a long illness. He was 69 years old.\n\nBurke made golfing record books in 1931 when he won a marathon 72\u2010hole playoff for the United States Open title. He and George Von Elm were tied at the end of regulation play in that tourney over the Inverness Golf Club course at Toledo, Ohio, and went into the playoff the next day.\n\nAt the end of the 36 holes they still were tied and had to play another 36 holes the following day. Burke won by one stroke.\n\nBurke, who played with a slightly unorthodox grip because of the loss of parts of two fingers on his left hand, was a member of the United States Ryder Cup team in 1931 and 1933 and was golf professional at the Cleveland country club for 29 years."}, {"url": "https://www.metroleague.org/is-billy-burke-a-good-golfer_gf23/", "page_content": "Billy Burke was known as one of the distinguished figures in the world of golf in the early 20th century. With several high-profile PGA Tour wins and a remarkable victory in the longest playoff in major championship history, he has left a lasting impact on the sport.\n\nAccomplishments and Statistics\n\nBilly Burke was a prominent professional golfer who made his mark in the PGA Tour scene from the 1920s through the 1940s. Although his career was not as illustrious as some of the all-time greats, such as Bobby Jones or Walter Hagen, Burke has some impressive achievements under his belt.\n\nPGA Tour Wins\n\nBurke accumulated 17 PGA Tour victories in his career. His first win came in 1927 at the Los Angeles Open, and his final win was at the Western Open in 1946. Aside from these two victories, he also won the Miami Open twice, the Greater Greensboro Open twice, and the North and South Open four times.\n\nMajor Championship Record\n\nBurke\u2019s most significant achievement in major championships was during the 1931 U.S. Open. He secured his only major win after outlasting George Von Elm in the longest playoff in major championship history, which took 72 holes to determine a winner. Burke finished his career with six top-10 finishes in major championships, including his win in 1931.\n\nCareer Earnings\n\nDuring his professional career, Burke earned a total of $30,302.50. Although this amount may seem paltry compared to today\u2019s standards, it was a respectable amount in his era.\n\nIt is worth noting that prize money was comparatively lower in those days, and professional golfers relied heavily on exhibition matches to supplement their income.\n\nScoring Average\n\nBurke\u2019s scoring average varies widely depending on the source. However, according to the PGA Tour records, his average score was 73.55. This score is not astonishingly low, but it was reasonably typical for that time. It is essential to keep in mind that courses were not as long or as challenging as they are now.\n\nBurke may not be a household name compared to some of the golfing greats, but his accomplishments and contributions to the game are noteworthy.\n\nWinning the longest playoff in major championship history and securing 17 PGA Tour victories is no small feat.

He was known for his precision and patience on the course. He was always analyzing and evaluating each shot before making his move, and this approach paid off for him in the long run. He often played smarter than his opponents and made fewer mistakes in crucial moments.\n\nHow His Style of Play Contributed to His Success\n\nBurke\u2019s strength in his short game and putting enabled him to save shots where other players might have lost strokes. This allowed him to stay in the game and potentially recover after hitting a poor tee shot or approach.\n\nHis precision and patience also contributed to his success in high-pressure situations, such as during the 1931 U.S. Open where he won after a grueling 72-hole playoff.\n\nOverall, Burke\u2019s style of play focused on accuracy, precision, and smart decision-making, uniquely suited him for success on the PGA Tour.

Facing tough competition and rivals pushed Burke to improve his game and become a better golfer.

However, golf was not initially part of his life.\n\nDiscovery of His Talent and Love for Golf\n\nBurke\u2019s introduction to golf came by chance when he was just a teenager. He accompanied his father, a baseball fan, to a golf course in the hopes of catching a glimpse of Babe Ruth, the legendary baseball player.\n\nLittle did Burke know that this visit would change the course of his life.

They enjoy global fame and a worldwide following. Hundreds of millions of people watch each of the game\u2019s four Major men's tournaments and the winners of these most prestigious events become household names. Golf fans would recognise tens, if not hundreds, of current professional players and, even non-golfing sports fans would be able to recall a decent number.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t always the case and there are many great golfing champions who have been consigned to the dustbin of history.\n\nNow, winning a single Major championship is enough to set a player up for life, whereas in days gone by it might have earned them a few hundred pounds and a pat on the back at their local club.\n\nBelow we take a look at the fascinating stories of some of those Major champions whose achievements have been forgotten, or perhaps disregarded, by all but the most enthusiastic golf statisticians.\n\nRalph Guldahl (1911 \u2013 1987)\n\nRalph Guldahl (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nBorn the year before Ben Hogan and Sam Snead, Ralph Guldahl\u2019s playing career peaked and troughed twice before either of those golfing legends reached their prime. The Texan turned pro in 1931 and quickly won the Santa Monica Open; he took the Arizona Open title the following season. In the 1933 US Open, the 6 foot 2 inch 21-year-old made up nine shots on Johnny Goodman in just 11 holes at the end of the final round. Guldahl faced a four-foot putt on the last green to force a playoff. He missed and effectively gave up competitive golf for three years, returning to his home in Dallas and becoming a used car salesman. But he took up the game again in 1936 and, between 1937 and 1939 Guldahl was arguably the best player in the world. He was second in the 1937 Masters before winning the US Open at Oakland Hills by two shots. He was second again in the 1938 Masters and successfully defended his US Open title, winning this time by six strokes at Cherry Hills. In 1939 he finally got his victory at Augusta and claimed three further titles that season.\n\nFor that brief spell, Guldahl was at the very pinnacle of the sport. But from 1940 onwards he lost his game and he quit tournament golf. He played his last US Open in 1949.\n\nMany believed his involvement in the writing of an instructional book was the reason for his golfing collapse \u2013 it caused him to over-analyse his game. Guldahl put it down to a lack of competitive drive and weariness because of the travelling.\n\nHe became a teaching professional at Braemar Country Club in California in 1959 where he worked until his death in 1987. Among many others, one of his students at Braemar was eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes.\n\nJack Fleck (1921 \u2013 2014)\n\nJack Fleck - 1955 US Open champion\n\nWith Ben Hogan safely in the clubhouse two clear of little-fancied Jack Fleck, almost everyone had given \u201cThe Hawk,\u201d the 1955 US Open title. NBC television finished their coverage before Fleck had completed his round, ending with a shot of Gene Sarazen congratulating Hogan on another US Open title.\n\nBut Fleck still had four to play. He birdied the 15th and 18th holes to fire a 67 and tie Hogan at the top. The following day, Fleck beat the great champion in an 18-hole playoff.\n\nFor many years after Fleck\u2019s surprise victory at Olympic Club, his triumph was dismissed as a fluke. He was portrayed as a club pro or journeyman, a one-hit-wonder. It\u2019s true he didn\u2019t exactly become a world-beater, but he won twice more on the PGA Tour, recorded 41 top-10s on the circuit and made the cut in 261 of the 271 tournaments he entered.\n\nThe truth is Fleck was not the man the vast majority of golf fans wanted to win at Olympic Club. His triumph over Hogan could be compared to Stewart Cink\u2019s playoff victory over Tom Watson at Turnberry in 2009: The golfing public longed for a different result.\n\nAt the presentation ceremony in 1955, Hogan announced he was, \u201cthrough with competitive golf.\u201d Many of those watching began crying. Even Fleck\u2019s own son said to him, \u201cI rooted for you dad but I was sorry Hogan lost.\u201d\n\nSo, it wasn\u2019t until recently, and particularly with the US Open returning to Olympic Club in 2012, that Fleck\u2019s achievement was more fully appreciated.\n\nFleck drove for 49 hours from his home in Iowa to San Francisco in June 1955. He opened his US Open campaign with a 76, nine shots worse than leader Tommy Bolt.\n\nBut he bounced back with a 69 to be in contention with two rounds to play. His closing 67 was one of the great Major rounds and his playoff win over the world\u2019s best player was a phenomenal display of ability and self-belief.\n\nDick Burton (1907 \u2013 1974)\n\nDick Burton (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nRichard \u201cDick\u201d Burton held the title of Open Champion longer than any man in the history of the tournament. He lifted the Claret Jug at St Andrews in 1939 and the competition was not held again until 1946, after the conclusion of the Second World War.\n\nWhen sending his application to the R&A in 1946, he included a short letter - \u201cDear Sirs, Please find enclosed my fee of five guineas for this year\u2019s Open. I will bring the trophy back when I come.\u201d\n\nBurton was no flash in the pan. Club professional at Ellesmere Port (then called Hooton) Golf Club and latterly Sale Golf Club, he won his first title at the 1934 Northern Professional Championship. He won seven professional tournaments and played three times in the Ryder Cup.\n\nBut his Open victory in the home of golf was his finest moment. Needing to shoot 72 in the final round to win, Burton birdied the 18th to beat Johnny Bulla by two strokes. Just a few weeks later war broke out and Burton enlisted in the RAF.\n\nIn later life, Burton was asked if he felt regret at not being able to take advantage of his Open triumph.\n\n\u201cI was lucky enough,\u201d he replied. \u201cA lot of those who watched me at St Andrews also went off to war and they never came back. Some of my friends didn\u2019t make it either, I did.\u201d\n\nLionel Hebert (1928 \u2013 2000)\n\nLionel Hebert (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nAs a young adult, Lionel Hebert had to make a decision whether to be a golfer or a musician. He was an excellent trumpet player and had gone to Louisiana State University to study music.\n\nBut, following in his brother Jay\u2019s footsteps, Lionel decided to embark on a career as a pro golfer.\n\nThe Heberts (pronounced A-bear) were Cajuns \u2013 an ethnic group found mainly in Louisiana, descended from French speaking Acadians (now a part of Canada.)\n\nLionel and Jay are the only brothers to have won the USPGA Championship. Lionel was the last match-play winner in 1957, while Jay took the title in stroke-play format in 1960.\n\nLionel played an incredible 580 events on the PGA Tour and senior tour. He was twice chairman of the PGA tournament committee and a founding member of the senior tour. But he never travelled to play in the Open championship as he maintained the trip was, \u201ctoo pricey.\u201d\n\nHerman Keiser (1914 \u2013 2003)\n\nHerman Keiser (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nThe 1946 Masters marked the re-start of significant professional golf following the Second World War. The stars of the day had gathered and the Augusta patrons anticipated a great battle between Hogan, Snead and Nelson.\n\nBut, after three rounds it was a relatively unknown pro from Missouri \u2013 Herman Keiser \u2013 who held a five-shot lead.\n\nNicknamed \u201cthe Missouri Mortician\u201d for the somber expression he wore on the golf course, Keiser had served 31 months at sea during the war, aboard the U.S.S Cincinnati.\n\nHogan caught Keiser with one hole to play at Augusta but \u201dThe Hawk\u201d three-putted the final green and Keiser was the champion.\n\nKeiser played in the Ryder Cup of 1947 when the US won by 11-1. That one point for Britain came courtesy of Keiser\u2019s singles defeat by Sam King. \u201cThe Mortician\u201d quit competitive golf in the mid 1950s and bought a driving range in Ohio.\n\nAndy North (born 1950)\n\nAndy North - Twice US Open champion\n\nBest known to golf fans as a television commentator, Andy North won three events on the PGA Tour. There\u2019s nothing particularly unusual about that, except two of those titles were the US Open.\n\nNorth had won the 1977 Westchester Classic, but coming into the 1978 US Open at Cherry Hills he could have been fairly described as a good journeyman. He wasn\u2019t considered a contender, but he outlasted Nicklaus, Watson, Miller and Player to win by a stroke.\n\nHe disappeared off the golfing radar again through the early 80s, recording just nine top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour between 1979 and 1984. But he reappeared in 1985 to win the US Open again, this time at Oakland Hills. After 1985, North recorded just three more top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour.\n\nBilly Burke (1902 \u2013 1972)\n\nBilly Burke - 1931 US Open champion\n\nBilly Burke\u2019s victory in the 1931 US Open was notable for two reasons: He was the first Major champion to use steel-shafted clubs and his triumph came after the longest playoff in Major history.\n\nAfter four rounds at the Inverness Golf Club in Toledo, Burke was tied at the top of the leaderboard with George Von Elm. They returned for a 36-hole playoff the following day and were still tied after that. Another 36-hole playoff ensued and, this time Burke won by one \u2013 144 holes and 589 strokes, compared to Von Elm\u2019s 590.\n\nHaving lost a finger working in a foundry as a teenager, Burke used an unorthodox grip with considerable success. He recorded 80 top-10 finishes during his PGA Tour career. The son of Polish immigrants, Burke (born Burkowski) played in the Ryder Cups of 1931 and 33 and was undefeated.\n\nOther Forgotten Major Winners\n\nThe forgotten Major winners talked about above were just some of those considered in the research for this piece. There are numerous others, and too many to cover in detail.\n\nFor example, Walter Burkemo, the 1953 USPGA champion. He had only one other PGA Tour win during his career and quit the tour in 1954 to go back to life as a club pro.\n\nDick Mayer won the 1957 US Open, and was PGA Tour player of the year. But he battled with alcoholism and it\u2019s generally viewed this prevented him winning more. He died aged 64.\n\nDick Mayer - 1957 US Open champion\n\nAccording to Sam Snead and Ben Hogan, 1950 USPGA champion Chandler Harper was the best putter in the world. He was a great friend of Bobby Jones and, in later life, became a mentor to Curtis Strange.\n\nHow about back-to-back English winners of the Open Championship in 1935 and 1936 \u2013 Alf Perry and Alf Padgham? Perry\u2019s best Open finish was a tie for 17th prior to winning at Muirfield in 1935 while Padgham, having left his clubs in the Hoylake pro-shop overnight, had to break a window to retrieve them in time for his third round in 1936.\n\nAlf Perry - 1935 Open Champion\n\nAll these men earned some sort of fame from golf, no matter how briefly. But none were rewarded financially to anywhere near the extent of today\u2019s Major winners whose lives are changed for good by the endorsements and invitations that flow in. So when the green jacket is presented next April, spare a thought for Ralph Guldahl. When the Claret Jug is lofted at Royal Troon, consider Dick Burton and the two Alfs.\n\nThese great old warriors make up an important part of golf\u2019s rich tapestry, it\u2019s just the patch they occupy has become a touch faded."}, {"url": "https://www.golfcompendium.com/2020/01/billy-burke-golfer.html", "page_content": "Billy Burke was a PGA Tour winner from the 1920s into the 1940s. He's most famous because he played in, and won, the longest playoff in major championship history: 72 playoff holes.\n\nFull name: William John Burke (birth name Burkowski)\n\nDate of birth: December 14, 1902\n\nPlace of birth: Naugatuck, Connecticut\n\nDate and place of death: April 19, 1972 in Clearwater, Florida\n\nBurke's PGA Tour Wins\n\n1927 Florida Open\n\n1927 Central Florida Open\n\n1928 North and South Open\n\n1929 New York State Open\n\n1929 Glens Falls Open\n\n1930 Mid South Open\n\n1931 U.S. Open\n\n1931 Glens Falls Open\n\n1932 Florida West Coast Open\n\n1935 The Cascades Open\n\n1936 Centennial Open\n\n1939 Walter Hagen 25th Anniversary*\n\n1940 Miami Biltmore International Four-Ball*\n\nBurke is credited with wins in 13 tournaments that are now counted by the PGA Tour as official tour wins:*These two were two-man team tournaments. At the 1939 Hagen, Burke partnered with Ed Dudley . At the 1940 Miami International, his partner was Craig Wood\n\nIn the Majors\n\nHis victory in the 1931 U.S. Open (more on that to come) was Burke's lone win in a major championship. And he never played in the British Open. His best other finishes were third places in the 1934 Masters and in the 1939 Masters ; plus he reached the semifinals in the 1931 PGA Championship\n\nOverall, Burke had six Top 10s in majors. The first major he played in was the 1928 U.S. Open, and he last played in a major in the 1961 Masters.\n\nHis Epic 1931 U.S. Win\n\nNot only did Burke win the 1931 U.S. Open , he won it playing with steel-shafted golf clubs. He was the first golfer to win the U.S. Open with steel shafts.\n\nOh, and then there was that 72-hole playoff. This Open was played at Inverness in Ohio, scheduled to end on July 4. The weather was brutal with temperatures in the 90s, some days approaching 100 \u2014 the 1931 U.S. Open is sometimes remembered as \"the Inferno at Inverness.\"\n\nBurke opened with a 73, two off the lead. In the second round, he shot 72 and moved to within one of leader George Von Elm. Von Elm was the tour's leading money winner heading into this tournament.\n\nOn the third day they played 36 holes, the third and fourth rounds. Von Elm's lead over second-place Burke was two following the third round. But Burke took the lead in Round 4, until Von Elm made a 10-foot putt to tie him on the 72nd hole.\n\nFor the first time, the USGA used a 36-hole playoff to decide its Open champion. The only problem was that Burke and Von Elm ended the 36-hole playoff day tied again, and again after Von Elm made a 10-footer on the final hole to tie. They both carded 149s.\n\nSo the next day, they came back and did it all again, their third consecutive day playing 36 holes. And this 36 holes was just like the previous two: tight throughtout. In fact, Burke and Von Elm traded the lead 25 times over the final 36.\n\nIn the end, after 72 holes of regular play and 72 more playoff holes, Burke won by a single stroke. He won the second playoff 148 to 149.\n\nThe USGA reacted to this epic battle \u2014 one literally hotly contested in July \u2014 two ways: It moved the U.S. Open from July back to June to try to reduce the heat; and it eliminated 36-hole playoffs, going back to 18-hole playoffs.\n\nMore About Billy Burke\n\nBurke was the son of Polish immigrants to American from Lithuania (the family name was Burkauskas, which was polonized to Burkowski, then anglicized to Burke). Billy began playing golf at age 12 after first starting caddying.\n\nAs a teenager, Burke went to work in the same iron foundry in which his father worked. But an accident there took off Burke's ring finger on his left hand, plus part of his left pinkie. After that, he had to rebuild his golf grip to work for him despite those missing fingers.\n\nIt didn't much slow Burke's progress as a golfer. After a hard day in the foundry, Burke headed to the driving range to practice. In Connecticut golf circles, they started calling him \"the Boy Marvel\" for his golf prowess.\n\nWhen he was 18, Burke first entered the Connecticut State Amateur. The only problem was he didn't own the clothes (such as plus-fours) to meet the dress standard for that big event. His dilemma received local media attention, and two local golfers Burke caddied for stepped up to outfit him with new golf clothes and pay his fare to the tournament.\n\nIn 1923, when he was 20, Burke made it to the championship match of the Connecticut State Amateur before losing to Henry Topping. But it turned out to be a great loss for Burke: Topping was a millionaire businessman who became an ongoing benefactor for Burke's golf career, including staking him when he shortly turned pro to try the PGA Tour.\n\nBurke began winning pro tour events in the late 1920s (the 1927 Florida Open is credited as his first tour win). His final tour win was in 1940.\n\nBurke also won other tournaments that are not counted as PGA Tour events, including the Ohio Open four times: 1938, 1939, 1945 and lastly in 1955 at the age of 52.\n\nThe year of 1931 was one of three in which he won twice on tour (1927 and 1929 being the other two), but it was without question his best year. It included his only major championship win at the U.S. Open, plus he reached the semifinals in the PGA Championship. Burke made the first of two appearances on Team USA in the Ryder Cup that year, winning both matches he played. (He also played in the 1933 Ryder Cup.)\n\nAnd Burke got married that year to Marguerite, who survived him when he died at age 69 in 1972.\n\nLater in 1931, Burke and George Von Elm, off the hoopla surrounding their 72-hole playoff, went on an exhibition tour together.\n\nAlong the way, Burke also worked as a club pro and was noted as a golf instructor. He was pro for 29 years, beginning in 1934, at Cleveland (Ohio) Country Club. From 1946-62, he was the winter-season pro at Clearwater (Fla.) Country Club. Burke also taught at the 9-hole course in his hometown of Naugatuck, Conn., as well as in Dark Harbor, Maine. In addition, Burke had endorsement deals with sports equipment companies and Billy Burke-branded golf clubs and golf balls were both produced during his heyday.\n\nBurke was inducted into the PGA Hall of Fame in 1966."}, {"url": "https://www.golfcompendium.com/2018/12/1938-pga-championship.html", "page_content": "The 1938 PGA Championship was the 21st time this major was played.\n\nWinner: Paul Runyan\n\nWhere it was played: Shawnee Country Club in Smithfield Township, Pennsylvania\n\nTournament dates: July 10-16, 1938\n\nNotable notes: Paul Runyan defeated Sam Snead in the championship match by an 8-and-7 score.

Like the 36-hole playoff format, the lighter ball was gone after 1931.\n\nBurke was born in 1902, the same year as Jones and Gene Sarazen. William John Burkowski grew up in Naugatuck, Conn., and like Eugenio Saraceni came from a working-class family. \u201cHe impresses me as a player who has learned his game through a lot of hard work,\" Jones wrote in the The American Golfer, \"as contrasted to one who has come by it easily and naturally.\" John Kiernan of The New York Times observed that Burke was \u201ca square-shouldered stalwart who might pass as pugilist or a heavy-hitting second baseman.\u201d\n\nBurke succeeded at golf despite a disability from an accident in an iron foundry.

It remains as remarkable a tale today as it was 81 years ago.\n\nBurke -- born Burkowski -- was the son of a Polish immigrant blue-collar worker. He fell in love with golf when, as a frail 12-year-old, he caddied for the first time at Naugatuck Golf Club.\n\nHis teenage years were spent lugging bags for club members. When the rounds were finished, Burke would ask to borrow members' clubs so he could practice. At 16, playing in a driving rain, he won the club championship.\n\nUpon graduating Naugatuck High, he worked at a rubber factory and later the iron foundry, practicing his golf game when the 5 p.m. whistle blew. A foundry accident cost him two fingers on his left hand, leaving Burke with an awkward swing. Still, his golf game thrived. By 1923, he was the Connecticut amateur champion.\n\nIt all led to his historic victory at the '31 Open, held at the Inverness Club in Toledo, Ohio. If a scorching heat wave wasn't enough -- temperatures exceeded 100 degrees that week -- Burke had to endure a marathon playoff with George Von Elm.\n\nThe two were tied after four rounds. Playoff rules at the time required another 36 holes. Still deadlocked, officials called for an additional 36 holes. Burke burned through 32 cigars over the grueling 144 holes, but wound up winning by a single stroke to earn the grand prize -- a whopping $1,000.\n\nRules were quickly changed to avoid a similar playoff marathon. Burke, hailed as the next Bobby Jones, returned to Naugatuck a conquering hero. He was a semifinalist at the PGA Championship later that year.

On the strength of that opening and closing, Finsterwald became the first PGA Championship winner in the tournament's new stroke-play era. A year earlier, the 1957 PGA Championship , like every previous one going back to the first in 1916, used a match-play format. Finsterwald was runner-up in 1957, losing in the final to Lionel Hebert.\n\nWhen Finsterwald left the 1957 PGA, neither he nor any of the other golfers knew it was the last match-play PGA. But at the PGA of America's national meetings in November, the organization announced it was switching to stroke play, the same format used by each of the other professional majors. Finsterwald wound up being the runner-up in the last match-play PGA and the winner in the first stroke-play PGA.\n\nFinsterwald's opening 67 gave him a one-stroke lead. He was still tied for first after a 72 in the second round, but a 70 in the third round dropped him to third. Sam Snead was the leader, one stroke ahead of Billy Casper and two ahead of Finsterwald.\n\nThen Finsterwald threw another 67 on the board in the final round that included a 31 on the front nine. It was enough to give him the two-stroke win over Casper, who was making his PGA Championship debut. Snead, going for a fourth PGA Championship win, scored 73 and finished third. For Finsterwald, this was the fourth of his 11 career wins on the PGA Tour. It remained his only win in a major.\n\nThis wasn't just the first stroke-play PGA Championship, but also the first one televised. The CBS network aired the final three holes of tournament play, plus the trophy presentation.\n\nAnd it wasn't just Casper's first PGA Championship, but also Arnold Palmer's. Palmer finished tied for 40th place. Casper went on to win 51 PGA Tour titles, and Palmer won 62.

He was of Lithuanian descent.\n\nProfessional career\n\nHis greatest season was 1931, when he won the U.S. Open, reached the semi-finals of the PGA Championship, and won four events on the professional circuit, plus appeared on the Ryder Cup team where he was undefeated in two matches. He was also selected for the 1933 Ryder Cup team but not before some agitation by Gene Sarazen was done on his behalf.[1] Burke won his only match in the 1933 competition.\n\nBurke's 1931 U.S. Open win came in a marathon playoff. He and George Von Elm were tied at 292 (8-over-par) after regulation play. They played a 36-hole playoff the next day and tied again at 149 (7-over-par). The following day they played 36 more holes and Burke emerged victorious 148 to 149.\n\nThroughout Burke's golf career he used an unorthodox grip due to the loss of two fingers on his left hand.[2] In 2005, Burke was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame.[3] Burke died in Clearwater, Florida, in 1972.\n\nHonors and awards\n\nIn 1963, Burke was inducted into the Connecticut Golf Hall of Fame\n\nProfessional wins (17)\n\nPGA Tour wins (13)\n\nMajor championship is shown in bold.\n\nOther wins (4)\n\nthis list may be incomplete\n\nMajor championships\n\nWins (1)\n\nYear Championship 54 holes Winning score Margin Runner-up 1931 U.S. Open 2 shot deficit +8 (73-72-74-73=292) Playoff 1 George Von Elm\n\n1 Defeated George Von Elm in a playoff.
