{"Harry S. Kennedy was a strong supporter of the civil rights movement.": [{"url": "https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/jfk-domestic-politics/", "page_content": "On the evening of May 3, 1963, Americans watched on television as Martin Luther King Jr.'s campaign to desegregate Birmingham, Alabama collapsed under a wave of officially sanctioned violence. Birmingham police attacked peaceful black demonstrators with clubs, dogs, and high-pressure fire hoses, and for the first time many citizens understood the breadth of America's racial divide. Perhaps no one regarded the events with more anguish than President John Fitzgerald Kennedy. The violence in Birmingham proved that Kennedy's piecemeal approach to civil rights had failed.\n\nMartin Luther King. and cabinet meeting , August 5 , 1965. Courtesy: Library of Congress\n\nElected president in 1960, Kennedy had campaigned on an idealistic New Frontier platform. The president believed that by showing the world what a free and democratic society had to offer, the United States could ensure the defeat of Communism. Unfortunately, since Kennedy had taken office, the world had seen the negative side of America -- intolerance and oppression. Despite Constitutional assurances to the contrary, African Americans were treated as second class citizens. They were frequently denied access to public facilities, prohibited from exercising their voting rights, and subjected to racist violence.\n\nUnder leaders such as King, African Americans organized nonviolent protests to gain access to public facilities. They sued in the courts for equal treatment, and used the pulpits and the press to eloquently state the case for full citizenship. And they implored their president to take a forceful public stand by issuing a call for comprehensive civil rights legislation. For the first two years of his administration, Kennedy ignored the call.\n\nThe Democrats held a narrow majority in Congress, and many of the Democratic seats were held by Southerners who opposed civil rights legislation. The president needed the white Southern vote to win reelection in 1964. So Kennedy adopted a cautious approach to civil rights, emphasizing enforcement of existing laws over the creation of new ones.\n\nKennedy pushed civil rights on many fronts. He ordered his attorney general to submit friends of the court briefs on behalf of civil rights litigants. He appointed African Americans to positions within his administration, named Thurgood Marshall to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, and supported voter registration drives.\n\nBut such an approach was problematic. By not addressing civil rights publicly and comprehensively, Kennedy was forced to address racial incidents on a case by case basis -- often after they had escalated to violence. In May, 1961, racists attacked Freedom Riders traveling by bus from Washington, D.C. to Birmingham, Alabama. Kennedy sent federal marshals to protect the protesters. But even armed marshals could not guarantee protection.\n\nJames Meredith at the University of Mississippi at Oxford, Courtesy: Library of Congress\n\nIn September 1962, James Meredith, a black man, attempted to register at the segregated University of Mississippi at Oxford. Kennedy had brokered a deal with segregationist governor Ross Barnett. The registration would occur on a Sunday, when opposition forces were least likely to be active. Federal marshals would be there to protect Meredith. But as Kennedy prematurely announced Meredith's successful registration on national television, marshals were fighting -- and losing -- a battle to control violent segregationists at the university.\n\nIf this incident embarrassed the Kennedy administration, it did little to alter the president's approach to civil rights. Activists asked Kennedy to issue an executive order ending discrimination in Federal mortgage loans. He put off the action for months, and issued a watered-down order in November of 1962. In February, 1963, he sent a civil rights package to Congress which included legislation to secure black voting rights. That the bill failed to address access to public facilities -- a major point of contention for civil rights activists -- was a moot point. The president did little to promote the bill's passage, and it quickly expired.\n\nKennedy's approach to civil rights was viewed, by civil rights leaders, as noncommittal. But the violence in Birmingham on May 3 of 1963 left him no choice but to alter his course. The nightsticks, the police dogs, and the fire hoses had revealed a glimpse of what America could become. Unless Kennedy took a firm stand, the New Frontier might deteriorate into a bloody race war.\n\nOn the evening of June 11, just hours after federal marshals had escorted black students to their dormitories at the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa, the president delivered a televised address to the nation. Speaking with conviction, Kennedy announced he would send comprehensive civil rights legislation to Congress. The package would include provisions for access to public facilities, voting rights, and technical and monetary support for school desegregation.\n\n\"The heart of the question,\" the president said, \"is whether all Americans are to be afforded equal rights and opportunities.\" The answer from those who opposed civil rights came later that evening, when segregationist Byron de La Beckwith shot and killed Medgar Evers, the NAACP's Mississippi field secretary.\n\nFive months later, Kennedy himself was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Comprehensive civil rights legislation had not yet passed. It would be up to Lyndon Baines Johnson, Kennedy's successor -- and to committed activists across the nation -- to resume the battle for equality.\n\nKennedy's failure to secure meaningful civil rights legislation was emblematic of other stalled domestic policy initiatives introduced by his administration. His efforts to cut taxes and increase funding for education also died in Congress. At the end of his brief presidency, much of the bright promise of the New Frontier had yet to be fulfilled."}, {"url": "https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/education/teachers/curricular-resources/strategies-for-support-jfk-and-the-civil-rights-act-of-1963", "page_content": "Students consider how a president can generate support for one of his legislative initiatives and help a bill become a law by investigating the steps President Kennedy took in attempting to turn his June 1963 civil rights proposal into meaningful legislation.\n\nDownload this lesson plan in PDF format.\n\nOverview\n\nGoal/Rationale\n\nAlthough the office of the presidency holds considerable power, the president alone cannot fulfill his agenda without significant support from the legislative branch of government and the American people. When President Kennedy proposed civil rights legislation in 1963, he faced substantial opposition in Congress and from a large segment of Americans. In this lesson plan, students will consider how a president can generate support for one of his legislative initiatives and help a bill become a law, by investigating the steps President Kennedy took in attempting to turn his June 1963 civil rights proposal into meaningful legislation.\n\nEssential Question:What tools does a president have to support passage of his proposed legislation?\n\nObjectives\n\nStudents will:\n\ndescribe and analyze the contents of the Civil Rights Bill of 1963.\n\nanalyze primary sources.\n\nexplain methods used by President Kennedy to garner support for his proposed civil rights legislation.\n\nMaterials\n\nPreparation\n\nHistorical Background and Context\n\nWhen John F. Kennedy became president in 1961, African Americans throughout much of the South were denied the right to vote, barred from public facilities, subjected to insults and violence, and could not expect justice from the courts. In the North, Black Americans also faced discrimination in housing, employment, education, and many other areas. But the civil rights movement had made important progress, and change was on the way.\n\nAlthough the election of 1960 between Kennedy and Nixon was very close, across the nation more than 70 percent of African Americans voted for Kennedy. These votes provided the winning edge in several key states. When President Kennedy took office in January 1961, African Americans had high expectations for the new administration.\n\nBut Kennedy's narrow election victory and small working margin in Congress left him cautious. He was reluctant to lose southern support for legislation on many fronts by pushing too hard on civil rights legislation. Instead, he appointed unprecedented numbers of African Americans to high-level positions in the administration and strengthened the Civil Rights Commission. He spoke out in favor of school desegregation and praised a number of cities for integrating their schools. He used executive orders to create the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity and prevent racial discrimination in the hiring of federal employees and contractors; and to forbid discrimination in the sale or lease of federally funded housing. Attorney General Robert Kennedy turned his attention to voting rights, initiating five times the number of suits brought during the previous administration. On February 28, 1963, Kennedy submitted a Special Message to the Congress on Civil Rights in which he asked Congress to enact legislation which included limited civil rights measures such as strengthening voting rights laws and providing assistance for schools that were voluntarily desegregating. Congress did not act on this proposal.\n\nBy the spring of 1963 Kennedy\u2019s attention became increasingly focused on civil rights. His evolution to a greater involvement in civil rights was spurred, in large measure, by the growing number and size of civil rights demonstrations, and the violent backlash from segregationists. The 1963 Birmingham Campaign in Alabama made national news with images of children attacked by dogs and blasted with fire hoses as more than 1,000 were arrested. The Kennedy administration was compelled to take action.\n\nWhen it became clear that Governor George Wallace would stand at the doorway of the University of Alabama\u2019s registration building on June 11, 1963 to prevent the registration of two African American college students, President Kennedy realized that, with the nation focused on civil rights, the timing was right to speak to the nation about the need for civil rights legislation. In his speech, he called civil rights not just a constitutional and legal issue, but a moral one as well. On June 19, 1963 he submitted a comprehensive bill for the Civil Rights Act of 1963 to Congress.\n\nProcedure\n\nIn class, review the context of the 1963 proposed civil rights bill. For homework, have students read the document \u201cImportant Background Facts on the Omnibus Civil Rights Act of 1963\u201d from the Washington State Democratic Committee. Have them pick one aspect of the bill (i.e. voting, school desegregation, fair employment opportunities, desegregation of privately owned establishments, etc.) and write a one-page essay about why they feel this particular aspect of the bill is especially important. The next day, in class, go over the homework responses of the students. Ask students from what groups the president would want to enlist support for his civil rights bill. Then, brainstorm with students how the President might generate support for his civil rights agenda from the American people and Congress.\n\nHow might he gain support from the general public?\n\nHow might he gain support from special interest groups? (i.e., business leaders)\n\nHow might he gain support from U.S. senators and U.S. representatives?\n\n[Students should be reminded of the various tools the president might have at his disposal to address these audiences such as televised speeches, the use of media for outreach through public service announcements, meetings with interest groups, meetings with political leaders and congressional committee members, etc.]\n\nAssign each student a particular audience from the three bullet points noted above, and have them work in small groups with other students assigned to their audience. Have the groups go to The Bill chapter in the 1963: The Struggle for Civil Rights microsite and pick one primary source that represents one kind of strategy for their audience and discuss with each other how it might help the president get his civil rights legislation passed. Tell them they should be prepared to discuss their findings with the entire class.\n\nProvide them with this list of possible primary sources:\n\nGaining support of the general public\n\nGaining special interest groups\u2019 support (businessmen, religious leaders, etc.)\n\nGaining support from Congress\n\n[For the October 23, 1963 tape recording noted above, have students focus on the president\u2019s remarks (Keeping the Bill Alive, Pt. 2). Les Arends was the minority whip for Republicans. Prior to the excerpt on our website, he had mentioned that he believed some Republicans would be uneasy about supporting the civil rights bill without an assurance that Democrats supported it. In the excerpt, Kennedy responds to concerns over which Party would receive the most criticism over supporting a modified civil rights bill. Most references made by Kennedy to \u201cthey\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d are to Republicans in Congress.]\n\nHere is a transcription of President Kennedy\u2019s remarks:\n\nI think you\u2019d have difficulties, if the mood is as Les has just described, selling them [Republicans] anything, unless they understood that the administration, the President, and the Democrats were signed off. Then you were giving them [Republicans] a proposition, should we go or shan\u2019t we go? If you [Republicans] go in and say well maybe the President is going to try to sell the Democrats if we agree, then the initiative has to be taken in a sense by the Republicans, rather than by the Democrats. And then they\u2019ll say, \u201cHell, let the Democrats take the heat.\u201d I would think you\u2019d sell it to them [Republicans] better, if you understood that what the Democrats were ready to go\u2026 Therefore, I would say, and I think we could get the Democrats to go, once we get an understanding of what kind of a bill. And I\u2019m not\u2026 that\u2019s why I want to know what it is on the four or five critical points, which I think we\u2019re in general agreement on, and which I\u2019m sure you and Nick [Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach] can get to complete agreement in a half hour. Then I can say to the Democrats, \u201cHere\u2019s the best we can do, and my judgment is, we ought to try to do it.\u201d Then if I can get them [the Democrats] to agree, the numbers it requires, I\u2019m confident we can get the Republicans.\u201d\n\nHave students report to the entire class about President Kennedy\u2019s various methods for gaining support for his bill, as discussed in their small groups (Step 4).\n\nFor homework, have each student write a one-page essay that includes a description of the primary source they studied in their small group and their own explanation of how it might help the president get his civil rights legislation passed.\n\nNote for students that although the comprehensive civil rights bill cleared several hurdles in Congress in the fall of 1963 and won the endorsement of House and Senate Republican leaders, it was not passed before November 22, 1963, when President Kennedy was assassinated.\n\nIn his last public statement about the bill, President Kennedy was asked two questions about the civil rights bill during a press conference on November 14, 1963 (available as video on our website):\n\n\u201cQUESTION: Mr. President, it now seems unlikely that you will get either your tax bill or your civil rights bill in this session of Congress. Does that disturb you?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I think that the longer the delay, I think-- yes, I think it is unfortunate. The fact of the matter is that both these bills should be passed. The tax bill has been before the Congress for nearly a year. The civil rights has been there for a much shorter time. It didn't go up until June. I am hopeful that the House will certainly act on that in the next month, maybe sooner. The tax bill hearings have been quite voluminous. It would seem to me that it might be possible to end those hearings and bring the matter to the Floor of the Senate before the end of the year. Otherwise, the civil rights bill will come over after the first of the year and there may be a very long debate\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cQUESTION: Mr. President, I think a few minutes ago you said it would be unfortunate if the tax bill and the civil rights bill don't get through. You just said also it is the worst attack on the foreign aid bill since its inception. Several appropriations bills are still hung up in Congress, the first time in history this late. What has happened on Capitol Hill?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: They are all interrelated. I think there is some delay because of civil rights. That has had an effect upon the passage of appropriations bills. There is not any question. On the other hand, of course, what we are talking about in both the civil rights bill and the tax bill are very complicated and important pieces of legislation, in fact more significant in their own way than legislation which has been sent up there for a decade. My judgment is that by the time this Congress goes home in the sense of next summer that in the fields of education, mental health, taxes, civil rights, this is going to be a record that is going to be-- however dark it looks now, I think that \u2018Westward look the land is bright,\u2019 and I think by next summer it may be.\u201d\n\nThe bill was left in the hands of Lyndon B. Johnson. Before becoming vice president, Johnson had served more than two decades in Congress as a congressman and senator from Texas. He used his connections with southern white congressional leaders and the outpouring of emotion after the president's assassination to pass the Civil Rights.\n\nProvisions of the legislation included: (1) protecting African Americans against discrimination in voter qualification tests; (2) outlawing discrimination in hotels, motels, restaurants, theaters, and all other public accommodations engaged in interstate commerce; (3) authorizing the US Attorney General's Office to file legal suits to enforce desegregation in public schools; (4) authorizing the withdrawal of federal funds from programs practicing discrimination; and (5) outlawing discrimination in employment in any business exceeding 25 people and creating an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to review complaints.\n\nPassed on July 2, 1964, the Civil Rights Act was a crucial step in achieving the civil rights movement's initial goal: full legal equality.\n\nExtensions\n\nHave students research a current, controversial bill that the president submitted for legislation and consider how the president has tried to gain support of the public, special interest groups, and Congress. They can present their work in a format of their choosing.\n\nHave students select a legislative cause at the national level and consider, as president, what they might do to enlist support for it. This could take the form of a multimedia presentation to the class, an essay, or an exhibit.\n\nConnections to Curriculum (Standards)\n\nNational History Standards\n\nUS History, Era 9: Postwar United States (1945 to early 1970s)\n\nStandard 3: Domestic policies after World War II\n\nStandard 4: The struggle for racial and gender equality and for the extension of civil liberties\n\nCommon Core State Standards\n\nELA College and Career Readiness Anchor Standards for Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Language\n\nELA \u2013 Reading Informational Texts, Writing, Speaking and Listening, Language, and Literacy in History/Social Studies for grades 9-10 and 11-12\n\nC3 Framework for Social Studies State Standards\n\nDiscipline 1 - Developing questions and planning inquiries\n\nDiscipline 2 - Applying disciplinary concepts and tools (History and Civics)\n\nDiscipline 3 - Evaluating sources and using evidence\n\nDiscipline 4 - Communicating conclusions and taking informed action\n\nMassachusetts History and Social Science Framework\n\nUSII.T4 -Defending democracy: the Cold War and civil rights at home\n\nUSII.T5 - United States and globalization\n\nGOV.T1 - Foundations of government in the United States\n\nMassachusetts English Language Arts Framework"}, {"url": "https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-kennedys-and-civil-rights.htm", "page_content": "President Lyndon B. Johnson hands Senator Robert F. Kennedy a pen from the signing of the Voting Rights Act. President's Room, U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC. August 6, 1965. LBJ Library photo by Yoichi Okamoto\n\nAfter the Kennedy Presidency\n\nShortly after being sworn in following President Kennedy\u2019s assassination, President Lyndon B. Johnson urged the passage of the Civil Rights Act be carried out in honor of the late president.\n\nJohnson used his connections and experience gained as former Senate Majority Leader to sucessfuly negotiate support for the bill. On July 2, 1964, a little more than a year after President Kennedy introduced the bill, President Johnson officially signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law. The act made discrimination in public facilities and federally funded programs illegal.\n\n\n\nRobert Kennedy left the Johnson Administration when he was elected as a U.S. Senator to New York. As a senator, he continued his support for the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He also continued to travel the country, expanding his views on race and poverty in America. In 1968, Kennedy made his own presidential bid. He quickly garnered overwhelming support from the Black community and other minorities who felt he would be their greatest advocate in the Oval Office.\n\n\n\nOn the evening of April 4, 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated.\n\n\n\nKennedy was scheduled to deliver a campaign speech that night in Indianapolis, IN to a crowd of predominantly Black Americans. As he delivered the shocking news of King\u2019s assassination, he empathized with his supporters and encouraged them to find peaceful and productive ways to channel their sorrow. The text and video of the speech are linked here.\n\n\n\nAs violence broke out across many American cities that evening, Indianapolis stayed peaceful. John Lewis would later say, \u201cHe {Kennedy} became the one man who could soothe the savage pain that swept through the city of Indianapolis, and there were no violent outbreaks there. I do remember calming my own sorrow in that dark hour by thinking, Dr. King is gone, but we still have Bobby.\"\n\n\n\nTwo months later, Robert Kennedy was assassinated.\n\n\n\nAlthough Senator Kennedy was assassinated in 1968, his legacy continues through the nonprofit, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights. This nonprofit continues the work of Senator Kennedy, advocating for human rights and social justice. In 1995, President Clinton visited Indianapolis' Martin Luther King Jr. Park to dedicate the \u201cLandmark for Peace\u201d memorial commemorating the site where Robert Kennedy delivered his immortal words on the night of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s assassination. In 2018, the site was added to the African American Civil Rights Network."}, {"url": "https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/civil-rights-movement", "page_content": "The civil rights movement was a struggle for social justice that took place mainly during the 1950s and 1960s for Black Americans to gain equal rights under the law in the United States. The Civil War officially abolished slavery , but it didn\u2019t end discrimination against Black people\u2014they continued to endure the devastating effects of racism, especially in the South. By the mid-20th century, Black Americans, along with many other Americans, mobilized and began an unprecedented fight for equality that spanned two decades.\n\nJim Crow Laws\n\nDuring Reconstruction, Black people took on leadership roles like never before. They held public office and sought legislative changes for equality and the right to vote.\n\nIn 1868, the 14th Amendment to the Constitution gave Black people equal protection under the law. In 1870, the 15th Amendment granted Black American men the right to vote. Still, many white Americans, especially those in the South, were unhappy that people they\u2019d once enslaved were now on a more-or-less equal playing field.\n\nTo marginalize Black people, keep them separate from white people and erase the progress they\u2019d made during Reconstruction, \u201cJim Crow\u201d laws were established in the South beginning in the late 19th century. Black people couldn\u2019t use the same public facilities as white people, live in many of the same towns or go to the same schools. Interracial marriage was illegal, and most Black people couldn\u2019t vote because they were unable to pass voter literacy tests.\n\nJim Crow laws weren\u2019t adopted in northern states; however, Black people still experienced discrimination at their jobs or when they tried to buy a house or get an education. To make matters worse, laws were passed in some states to limit voting rights for Black Americans.\n\nMoreover, southern segregation gained ground in 1896 when the U.S. Supreme Court declared in Plessy v. Ferguson that facilities for Black and white people could be \u201cseparate but equal.\"\n\nWorld War II and Civil Rights\n\nPrior to World War II, most Black people worked as low-wage farmers, factory workers, domestics or servants. By the early 1940s, war-related work was booming, but most Black Americans weren\u2019t given better-paying jobs. They were also discouraged from joining the military.\n\nAfter thousands of Black people threatened to march on Washington to demand equal employment rights, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 on June 25, 1941. It opened national defense jobs and other government jobs to all Americans regardless of race, creed, color or national origin.\n\nBlack men and women served heroically in World War II, despite suffering segregation and discrimination during their deployment. The Tuskegee Airmen broke the racial barrier to become the first Black military aviators in the U.S. Army Air Corps and earned more than 150 Distinguished Flying Crosses. Yet many Black veterans were met with prejudice and scorn upon returning home. This was a stark contrast to why America had entered the war to begin with\u2014to defend freedom and democracy in the world.\n\nAs the Cold War began, President Harry Truman initiated a civil rights agenda, and in 1948 issued Executive Order 9981 to end discrimination in the military. These events helped set the stage for grass-roots initiatives to enact racial equality legislation and incite the civil rights movement.\n\nRosa Parks\n\nOn December 1, 1955, a 42-year-old woman named Rosa Parks found a seat on a Montgomery, Alabama bus after work. Segregation laws at the time stated Black passengers must sit in designated seats at the back of the bus, and Parks complied.\n\nWhen a white man got on the bus and couldn\u2019t find a seat in the white section at the front of the bus, the bus driver instructed Parks and three other Black passengers to give up their seats. Parks refused and was arrested.\n\nAs word of her arrest ignited outrage and support, Parks unwittingly became the \u201cmother of the modern-day civil rights movement.\u201d Black community leaders formed the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) led by Baptist minister Martin Luther King Jr., a role which would place him front and center in the fight for civil rights.\n\nParks\u2019 courage incited the MIA to stage a boycott of the Montgomery bus system. The Montgomery Bus Boycott lasted 381 days. On November 14, 1956, the Supreme Court ruled segregated seating was unconstitutional.\n\nLittle Rock Nine\n\nIn 1954, the civil rights movement gained momentum when the United States Supreme Court made segregation illegal in public schools in the case of Brown v. Board of Education. In 1957, Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas asked for volunteers from all-Black high schools to attend the formerly segregated school.\n\nOn September 4, 1957, nine Black students, known as the Little Rock Nine, arrived at Central High School to begin classes but were instead met by the Arkansas National Guard (on order of Governor Orval Faubus) and a screaming, threatening mob. The Little Rock Nine tried again a couple of weeks later and made it inside, but had to be removed for their safety when violence ensued.\n\nFinally, President Dwight D. Eisenhower intervened and ordered federal troops to escort the Little Rock Nine to and from classes at Central High. Still, the students faced continual harassment and prejudice.\n\nTheir efforts, however, brought much-needed attention to the issue of desegregation and fueled protests on both sides of the issue.\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1957\n\nEven though all Americans had gained the right to vote, many southern states made it difficult for Black citizens. They often required prospective voters of color to take literacy tests that were confusing, misleading and nearly impossible to pass.\n\nWanting to show a commitment to the civil rights movement and minimize racial tensions in the South, the Eisenhower administration pressured Congress to consider new civil rights legislation.\n\nOn September 9, 1957, President Eisenhower signed the Civil Rights Act of 1957 into law, the first major civil rights legislation since Reconstruction. It allowed federal prosecution of anyone who tried to prevent someone from voting. It also created a commission to investigate voter fraud.\n\nWoolworth's Lunch Counter\n\nDespite making some gains, Black Americans still experienced blatant prejudice in their daily lives. On February 1, 1960, four college students took a stand against segregation in Greensboro, North Carolina when they refused to leave a Woolworth\u2019s lunch counter without being served.\n\nOver the next several days, hundreds of people joined their cause in what became known as the Greensboro sit-ins. After some were arrested and charged with trespassing, protesters launched a boycott of all segregated lunch counters until the owners caved and the original four students were finally served at the Woolworth\u2019s lunch counter where they\u2019d first stood their ground.\n\nTheir efforts spearheaded peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations in dozens of cities and helped launch the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to encourage all students to get involved in the civil rights movement. It also caught the eye of young college graduate Stokely Carmichael, who joined the SNCC during the Freedom Summer of 1964 to register Black voters in Mississippi. In 1966, Carmichael became the chair of the SNCC, giving his famous speech in which he originated the phrase \"Black power.\u201d\n\nFreedom Riders\n\nOn May 4, 1961, 13 \u201cFreedom Riders\u201d\u2014seven Black and six white activists\u2013mounted a Greyhound bus in Washington, D.C., embarking on a bus tour of the American south to protest segregated bus terminals. They were testing the 1960 decision by the Supreme Court in Boynton v. Virginia that declared the segregation of interstate transportation facilities unconstitutional.\n\nFacing violence from both police officers and white protesters, the Freedom Rides drew international attention. On Mother\u2019s Day 1961, the bus reached Anniston, Alabama, where a mob mounted the bus and threw a bomb into it. The Freedom Riders escaped the burning bus but were badly beaten. Photos of the bus engulfed in flames were widely circulated, and the group could not find a bus driver to take them further. U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy (brother to President John F. Kennedy) negotiated with Alabama Governor John Patterson to find a suitable driver, and the Freedom Riders resumed their journey under police escort on May 20. But the officers left the group once they reached Montgomery, where a white mob brutally attacked the bus. Attorney General Kennedy responded to the riders\u2014and a call from Martin Luther King Jr.\u2014by sending federal marshals to Montgomery.\n\nOn May 24, 1961, a group of Freedom Riders reached Jackson, Mississippi. Though met with hundreds of supporters, the group was arrested for trespassing in a \u201cwhites-only\u201d facility and sentenced to 30 days in jail. Attorneys for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) brought the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court, which reversed the convictions. Hundreds of new Freedom Riders were drawn to the cause, and the rides continued.\n\nIn the fall of 1961, under pressure from the Kennedy administration, the Interstate Commerce Commission issued regulations prohibiting segregation in interstate transit terminals\n\nMarch on Washington\n\nArguably one of the most famous events of the civil rights movement took place on August 28, 1963: the March on Washington. It was organized and attended by civil rights leaders such as A. Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin and Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nMore than 200,000 people of all races congregated in Washington, D. C. for the peaceful march with the main purpose of forcing civil rights legislation and establishing job equality for everyone. The highlight of the march was King\u2019s speech in which he continually stated, \u201cI have a dream\u2026\u201d\n\nKing\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech galvanized the national civil rights movement and became a slogan for equality and freedom.\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964\u2014legislation initiated by President John F. Kennedy before his assassination\u2014into law on July 2 of that year.\n\nKing and other civil rights activists witnessed the signing. The law guaranteed equal employment for all, limited the use of voter literacy tests and allowed federal authorities to ensure public facilities were integrated.\n\nBloody Sunday\n\nOn March 7, 1965, the civil rights movement in Alabama took an especially violent turn as 600 peaceful demonstrators participated in the Selma to Montgomery march to protest the killing of Black civil rights activist Jimmie Lee Jackson by a white police officer and to encourage legislation to enforce the 15th amendment.\n\nAs the protesters neared the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they were blocked by Alabama state and local police sent by Alabama Governor George C. Wallace, a vocal opponent of desegregation. Refusing to stand down, protesters moved forward and were viciously beaten and teargassed by police and dozens of protesters were hospitalized.\n\nThe entire incident was televised and became known as \u201cBloody Sunday.\u201d Some activists wanted to retaliate with violence, but King pushed for nonviolent protests and eventually gained federal protection for another march.\n\nVoting Rights Act of 1965\n\nWhen President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law on August 6, 1965, he took the Civil Rights Act of 1964 several steps further. The new law banned all voter literacy tests and provided federal examiners in certain voting jurisdictions.\n\nIt also allowed the attorney general to contest state and local poll taxes. As a result, poll taxes were later declared unconstitutional in Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections in 1966.\n\nPart of the Act was walked back decades later, in 2013, when a Supreme Court decision ruled that Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional, holding that the constraints placed on certain states and federal review of states' voting procedures were outdated.\n\nCivil Rights Leaders Assassinated\n\nThe civil rights movement had tragic consequences for two of its leaders in the late 1960s. On February 21, 1965, former Nation of Islam leader and Organization of Afro-American Unity founder Malcolm X was assassinated at a rally.\n\nOn April 4, 1968, civil rights leader and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on his hotel room's balcony. Emotionally-charged looting and riots followed, putting even more pressure on the Johnson administration to push through additional civil rights laws.\n\nFair Housing Act of 1968\n\nThe Fair Housing Act became law on April 11, 1968, just days after King\u2019s assassination. It prevented housing discrimination based on race, sex, national origin and religion. It was also the last legislation enacted during the civil rights era.\n\nThe civil rights movement was an empowering yet precarious time for Black Americans. The efforts of civil rights activists and countless protesters of all races brought about legislation to end segregation, Black voter suppression and discriminatory employment and housing practices.\n\nPhoto Galleries In 1957 nine Black students integrated the formerly all-white Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas.

John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum\n\nJohn Kennedy was elected president in 1960 partly because of his promise to secure equal rights for black Americans. Yet, once in office, he and his brother Robert, the attorney general, sought to avoid too great an involvement in the politically divisive struggle. Violent Southern conflict about black civil rights overtook the Kennedys, forcing them to intervene on the side of the integrationists. Still, President Kennedy resisted sending strong civil rights legislation to Congress, unwilling to risk further alienating the powerful Southern conservatives blocking his domestic program.\n\nA Rising Movement\n\nThe African American movement for equal rights had been building for years. The Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 that segregated educational facilities were inherently unequal. An African American teenager from Chicago, Emmett Till, was brutally murdered in Mississippi in summer 1955. When his mother decided to keep her son\u2019s casket open, to show what had been done to him, many people who had stayed on the sidelines were moved to join the struggle for justice. A few months later, an African American seamstress, Rosa Parks, sat in the front of a bus, refusing to move to the back, where blacks were expected to sit. Her arrest motivated a boycott of Montgomery, Alabama buses led by the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nVehement Opposition\n\nEven as supporters of equal rights increased their activism, the opposition grew. White supremacist Citizens\u2019 Councils sprung up in Mississippi following the Brown decision. In 1956 a mob nearly lynched Autherine Lucy, a black woman who tried to register as a student at the University of Alabama. George Wallace, an ambitious Alabama politician, lost his bid for governor in 1958 after receiving the endorsement of the NAACP. His victorious opponent had been endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan. Wallace took away the lesson that he needed to take a stronger position against integration; his hardened attitude would help him claim victory in 1962.\n\nThe 1960 Election\n\nBy the time John Kennedy and Richard Nixon met to debate in the 1960 presidential campaign, the civil rights issue could not be ignored. Both candidates sympathized with the plight of African Americans, but failed to provide solutions to the problem. During the campaign, Martin Luther King Jr.was arrested in Atlanta for a sit-in and sentenced to four months hard labor. His friends worried that he would be lynched while in prison. Kennedy called Mrs. King directly and offered his sympathy; meanwhile, his brother Bobby called the judge in Georgia and King was released on bail a few days later. This incident drew little mainstream press, but the African American community was well aware of it. Martin Luther King Sr., who had endorsed Nixon earlier, switched allegiances. \u201cThis man was willing to wipe the tears from my daughter[-in-law]'s eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a suitcase of votes, and I\u2019m going to take them to Mr. Kennedy.\u201d The black vote was pivotal in the swing states of Illinois, Michigan and South Carolina that Kennedy carried.\n\nReluctant Involvement\n\nThe African American vote may have been pivotal in getting Kennedy into office but once he was there he was reluctant to get involved in the divisive issue of civil rights. He and his brother Robert were drawn into the struggle when thirteen black and white members of the Congress of Racial Equality boarded a bus in Washington, D.C., and headed to New Orleans to protest segregation of interstate transportation. When these Freedom Riders were stopped by violence in Birmingham, Alabama, Robert Kennedy intervened to get the Riders back on their way. When mobs of angry whites attacked the Freedom Riders in Montgomery, Alabama, Robert Kennedy sent in federal marshals.\n\nHaving It Both Ways\n\nForced to react on the side of civil rights, the Kennedy brothers still did not seem committed to the issue. \u201cThe Kennedys wanted [it] both ways. They wanted to appear to be our friends and they wanted to be the brake on our movement,\u201d said civil rights activist Roger Wilkins. But John Kennedy saw himself as having done more than any other president for African Americans. Historian Robert Dallek wrote, \u201che had gone beyond other presidents, but it was not enough to keep up with the determined efforts of African Americans to end two centuries of oppression.\u201d Still, the Freedom Riders conflict had its impact. Robert Kennedy later said, \u201cI never recovered from it.\u201d For the rest of his life, he would remain a champion of civil rights.\n\nThe Early Sixties\n\nRacial tensions continued to build. In 1962 President Kennedy sent hundreds of U.S. marshals to enforce a court order to admit African American James Meredith to the University of Mississippi. The marshals encountered fierce resistance from violent segregationists. In a melee, two people were killed and dozens injured. In February 1963 Kennedy submitted a civil rights bill to Congress that did not address the important issue of integration of public facilities. He did little to support the bill and it floundered. When racial violence erupted in Birmingham, Alabama, in May 1963, John Kennedy realized it was time to put forward a broad new civil rights bill. Most of his advisers told him it would be a terrible political mistake. But Robert advised him that the future of the country was at stake and urged him to go ahead with the bill.\n\nA Landmark Speech\n\nOn June 11, 1963, the day that Governor George Wallace made his \u201cstand in the school room door\u201d to prevent two black students from attending the University of Alabama, President Kennedy spoke to the nation in a televised address to ask for support of the civil rights bill. He said, \u201cWe are confronted primarily with a moral issue. It is as old as the scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution. The heart of the question is whether all Americans are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities.\u201d\n\nTwo Reactions\n\nFor some, Kennedy\u2019s speech was a long-awaited show of support. \u201cAll of a sudden, he brought passion to it, he brought that eloquence to it and it electrified me and all kinds of other black people,\u201d Roger Wilkins remembered. Fellow civil rights activist John Lewis said, \u201cthat night in June\u2026 he spoke, I think, to the heart and to the soul of America. I would never forget that speech.\u201d For others, the speech was intolerable. Later that night, a reply came from those who opposed civil rights. Segregationist Byron de la Beckwith shot and killed Medgar Evers, the NAACP\u2019s field secretary in Mississippi.\n\nLegislative Victory\n\nWithin weeks, Kennedy presented to Congress the most sweeping civil rights legislation since Reconstruction. In September 1963, asked to comment on a Gallup poll reporting that fifty percent of the nation thought he was pushing too fast on integration, Kennedy said, \u201cThis is not a matter on which you can take the temperature every week or two\u2026 you must make a judgment about the movement of a great historical event which is taking place in this country\u2026 Change always disturbs.\u201d Just two months later, John Kennedy was assassinated. His successor, Lyndon Johnson, pushed the bill through Congress and signed it into law in 1964."}, {"url": "https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/educational-resources/the-civil-rights-act-of-1964", "page_content": "On June 11, 1963, President John F. Kennedy gave a televised address to the American people and announced that he would be sending a civil rights bill to Congress. His bill would become the most-far reaching act of legislation supporting racial equality in American history. Beginning in the 1950s, African Americans had been engaged in peaceful demonstrations to protest segregation and discrimination, but had encountered violence and resistance. The turmoil through the South prompted the president to take action. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed racial segregation in public accommodations including hotels, restaurants, theaters, and stores, and made employment discrimination illegal. President Lyndon Johnson signed the bill on July 2, 1964. This exhibit summarizes some of the historical events that influenced the passage of this legislation.\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement\n\nThe catalyst that ignited the modern Civil Rights Movement was the 1955 bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama. When Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white passenger, the black community organized a boycott of the city buses. After 13 months, the U.S. Supreme Court held that Alabama\u2019s laws segregating buses were unconstitutional, and the boycott ended in success. During the Montgomery boycott, Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. rose to prominence, and in 1956 the Southern Christian Leadership Council was created to coordinate and support non-violent protests against segregation and discrimination.\n\nU.S. Supreme Court held that Alabama\u2019s laws segregating buses were unconstitutional\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement was a grassroots effort, that took root as African American citizens decided to speak up, walk out, or engage in civil disobedience to bring attention to the racial injustices that permeated Southern society. In February 1960, students in Greensboro, North Carolina, began the sit-in movement, when they refused to leave a segregated lunch counter at a Woolworth\u2019s store. Their actions set off a wave of sit-ins and other non-violent protests against segregation. Later that year, students founded the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee as an outlet for younger African Americans who wanted to take part in the movement. In 1961, the Freedom Riders risked their lives trying to desegregate interstate travel facilities, such as bus stations across the South. Beginning their rides in Washington, D.C., the riders were arrested in Charlotte, North Carolina, and they encountered increasing resistance as they traveled deeper into the South. In Alabama and Mississippi, the riders were beaten and arrested. The next year, violent vigilantes rioted in Oxford, Mississippi, as James Meredith, by order of the U.S. courts, enrolled in the traditionally white University of Mississippi.\n\nThe Kennedy Administration\n\nAlthough John F. Kennedy\u2019s administration responded to civil rights protests that turned violent, such as sending federal troops to the University of Mississippi campus to quell the riots, it had been criticized for not doing enough to support African Americans fighting for social and economic equality. President Kennedy wanted to wait until his second term to send a civil rights bill to Congress, but events conspired to constrict his timetable.\n\nOn the occasion of Vanderbilt University\u2019s 90th anniversary, President John Kennedy stressed the responsibility of educated men and women to use their talents to help society. Photo courtesy of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum.\n\nBy the spring of 1963, simultaneous protests were taking place throughout the South, but the one attracting national and international attention occurred in Birmingham, Alabama. The city\u2019s black community decided to follow a strategy used in Albany, Georgia, protesting discriminatory practices with mass marches and filling up the city\u2019s jails. Birmingham\u2019s Police Commissioner Eugene \u201cBull\u201d Connor, a hard-line segregationist, responded to the peaceful protests with police force. President Kennedy was spurred into action as the Birmingham protests escalated. As photographs of police dogs attacking peaceful marchers and fire hoses being turned on children flashed across the country and around the globe, the Kennedy administration responded. In May 1963, the administration sent Burke Marshall, an official from the Justice Department, down to Birmingham, and he negotiated a short-lived agreement between business leaders and civil rights activists.\n\nThat same month, on May 18, 1963, President Kennedy delivered a speech at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, in which he mentioned the movement and the struggle for equal rights. He referred to the complexity of the problem and the importance of assuring all Americans their rights under the law.\n\nThen on May 21, federal courts ordered the University of Alabama to admit two African American students, Vivian J. Malone and James A. Hood, for the summer session beginning in June. The governor of Alabama, George Wallace, was an avowed segregationist. In his inaugural address in January 1963, Wallace \u201cdrew a line in the dust and toss[ed] the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny,\u201d declaring \u201csegregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.\u201d He pledged to block the entrance and prevent the university\u2019s desegregation.\n\nRead Wallace\u2019s full Inaugural Address from the Alabama Department of Archives and History Digital Collections.\n\nPresident Kennedy warned Governor Wallace against stopping the integration of the university, but on June 11, 1963, Governor Wallace stood in front of a university building to bar Malone\u2019s and Hood\u2019s entrance. Governor Wallace and U.S. Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach engaged in a standoff, captured on camera, and President Kennedy mobilized the Alabama National Guard to protect the students and resolve the situation. Malone and Hood ultimately entered the building and registered for classes.\n\nGovernor George Wallace (second from left) blocked U.S. Deputy Attorney General, Nicholas Katzenbach, from entering the University of Alabama.

He announced his intention to ask Congress to act, declaring that a moral crisis existed in the country and requesting Congress to move forward with legislation to desegregate public accommodations and speed up the integration of public education.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nIt [this nation] was founded on the principle that all men are created equal, and that the rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened.\n\nOn June 19, President Kennedy sent his civil rights bill to Congress.\n\nAs the bill began to slowly make its way through Congress, civil rights leaders proposed maintaining the momentum by reviving an idea from the 1940s. In 1941, A. Philip Randolph and associates had proposed a march on Washington to protest racial discrimination in the war industries. The march never came to fruition because President Franklin Roosevelt signed an executive order that prohibited discrimination in national defense industries.\n\nRead President Roosevelt's Executive Order 8802 at the Franklin D.

Source: National Archives\n\nIn 1963, civil rights leaders including Martin Luther King, Jr., Roy Wilkins, and James Farmer decided to revive Randolph\u2019s original idea. The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom took place on August 28, 1963, when more than 250,000 demonstrators gathered in Washington, D.C., in support of job creation and civil rights legislation.\n\nFollowing the peaceful March on Washington, which featured King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech, President Kennedy met with civil rights leaders at the White House. They discussed the event and the details of the civil right legislation moving through Congress. Roy Wilkins stressed their desire to have fair employment practices included in the civil rights package. They also stressed the importance of training and education.\n\nPresident Kennedy meets with civil rights leaders in the White House. Photo courtesy of the National Archives.\n\nThe Johnson Administration\n\nThen on November 22, 1963, President Kennedy was assassinated while riding in a Dallas motorcade. On becoming president, Lyndon Johnson took up the mantle of civil rights. In addressing a joint session of Congress five days after the assassination, President Johnson announced his intention to continue to pursue the passage of civil rights legislation as a tribute to President Kennedy.\n\nUsing his leadership to lobby key senators, President Johnson forged a bipartisan coalition of northern and border-state Democrats and moderate Republicans. These Senators were able to offset a coalition of southern Democrats and right-wing Republicans, including an 82-day filibuster, and the bill passed in the Senate by a vote of 73 to 27 on June 19, 1964.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson recorded many of his telephone conversations during his time in office. Photo courtesy of the National Archives.\n\nThat day, President Johnson called NAACP president, Roy Wilkins, to discuss the Senate\u2019s passage of the bill. After sharing congratulations, the president asked Wilkins for his ideas about the statement Johnson would make during the signing ceremony. The two men talked about strategy for implementing the legislation, as well as how to handle southern governors and how to enforce the law in the old Confederacy.\n\nTwo days later, President Johnson called House Minority Leader, Republican Charles Halleck of Indiana, to discuss bringing the bill up for a vote in the House. Johnson urged Halleck to pass the civil rights legislation, as well as his anti-poverty bill. Alternatively cajoling and joking with Halleck, Johnson made it clear that he planned to sign the act before the July 4th congressional recess.\n\nOn July 2, 1964, a few hours after the House passed the bill, President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in a televised White House ceremony. In his remarks, he noted the historic nature of the legislation and outlined his plan to implement the law. At the conclusion of his statement, he signed the bill using a number of different pens, which he then passed out to the bill\u2019s supporters, including President Kennedy\u2019s brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nWe believe that all men have certain unalienable rights.

Kennedy became president in 1961, African Americans faced significant discrimination in the United States. Throughout much of the South they were denied the right to vote, barred from public facilities, subjected to violence including lynching, and could not expect justice from the courts. In the North, Black Americans also faced discrimination in housing, employment, education, and many other areas.\n\nProgress and Protests: 1954-1960\n\nIn 1954, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in Brown v. Board of Education that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. Many southern political leaders invoked the tenth amendment or \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d to justify segregation and claimed the desegregation decision violated the rights of states to manage their systems of public education. They responded with defiance, legal challenges, delays, or token compliance. As a result, school desegregation proceeded very slowly. By the end of the 1950s, fewer than 10 percent of Black children in the South were attending integrated schools.\n\nThe pace of civil rights protests rose sharply in response to the Supreme Court's decision. Martin Luther King Jr. led a boycott that ended segregated busing in Montgomery, Alabama. In 1957, National Guard troops under orders from President Dwight D. Eisenhower enforced the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School in Arkansas. But, even after Little Rock, school integration was painfully slow, and segregation in general remained largely untouched.\n\nIn February 1960, four Black college students sat down at a segregated Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, and asked to be served. They refused to leave their seats after being denied service. Within days, more than 50 students had volunteered to continue the sit-in, and within weeks the movement had spread to other college campuses. Sit\u2011ins and other protests swept across the South in early 1960, touching more than 65 cities in 12 states. Roughly 50,000 young people joined the protests that year.\n\nThe Election of 1960\n\nBy the 1960 presidential campaign, civil rights had emerged as a crucial issue. Just a few weeks before the election, Martin Luther King Jr. was arrested while leading a protest in Atlanta, Georgia. John Kennedy phoned his wife, Coretta Scott King to express his concern, while a call from Robert Kennedy to the judge helped secure her husband's safe release. The Kennedys' personal intervention led to a public endorsement by Martin Luther King Sr., the influential father of the civil rights leader. The publicizing of this endorsement, combined with other campaign efforts, contributed to increased support among Black voters for Kennedy.\n\nAcross the nation, almost 70 percent of African Americans voted for Kennedy, and these votes provided the winning edge in several key states. When President Kennedy took office in January 1961, African Americans had high expectations for the new administration.\n\nBut Kennedy's narrow election victory and small working margin in Congress contributed to his cautious navigation of civil rights issues. He was reluctant to lose southern support for legislation on many fronts by pushing too hard on civil rights legislation. Instead, encouraged by staff, he appointed unprecedented numbers of African Americans to high-level positions in the administration and strengthened the Civil Rights Commission. He spoke out in favor of school desegregation, praised a number of cities for integrating their schools, and put Vice President Lyndon Johnson in charge of the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity. Attorney General Robert Kennedy turned his attention to voting rights, initiating five times the number of suits brought during the previous administration.\n\nThe Freedom Rides\n\nPresident Kennedy may have been reluctant to push ahead with civil rights legislation, but millions of African Americans forged ahead. Eventually, the administration was compelled to act.\n\nFor decades, seating on buses in the South had been segregated, along with bus station waiting rooms, rest rooms, and restaurants. In May 1961, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), led by James Farmer, organized integrated Freedom Rides to defy segregation in interstate transportation. Freedom Riders were arrested in North Carolina and beaten in South Carolina. In Alabama, a bus was burned, and the riders attacked with baseball bats and tire irons. Attorney General Robert Kennedy sent 400 federal marshals to protect the Freedom Riders and urged the Interstate Commerce Commission to order the desegregation of interstate travel.\n\nJames Meredith and the Integration of Ole Miss\n\nIn 1962, James H. Meredith Jr., an African American Air Force veteran, applied for admission to the all-white University of Mississippi, known as \"Ole Miss.\" He attempted to register four times without success.\n\nLong telephone conversations between the president, the attorney general, and Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett failed to produce a solution. When federal marshals accompanied Meredith to campus in another attempt to register for classes, rioting erupted by white protesters. Two people died and dozens were injured. President Kennedy mobilized the National Guard and sent federal troops to the campus. Meredith registered the next day and attended his first class. This was the first step in ending segregation at the University of Mississippi.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr., Bull Connor, and the Demonstrations in Birmingham\n\nIn the spring of 1963, Martin Luther King Jr., and Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth launched a campaign of mass protests in Birmingham, Alabama, which King called the most segregated city in America. Initially, the demonstrations had little impact. Then, on Good Friday, King was arrested and spent a week behind bars, where he wrote one of his most famous meditations on racial injustice and civil disobedience, \"Letter from Birmingham Jail.\" Meanwhile, James Bevel, another organizer of the Birmingham Campaign, rallied Black youths to march in the streets at the beginning of May. Birmingham City Commissioner Eugene \"Bull\" Connor used police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses to put down the peaceful demonstrations. Nearly a thousand young people were arrested. The violence was broadcast on television to the nation and the world.\n\nInvoking federal authority, President Kennedy sent several thousand troops to an Alabama air base, and his administration responded by speeding up the drafting of a comprehensive civil rights bill.\n\nIntegrating the University of Alabama\n\nGovernor George Wallace had vowed at his inauguration to defend \"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, and segregation forever.\" In June 1963, he upheld his promise to \"stand in the schoolhouse door\" to prevent two Black students from enrolling at the University of Alabama. To protect the students and secure their admission, President Kennedy federalized the Alabama National Guard. And on the evening of June 11, the president addressed the nation.\n\nKennedy defined the civil rights crisis as moral, as well as constitutional and legal. He announced that major civil rights legislation would be submitted to the Congress to guarantee equal access to public facilities, to end segregation in education, and to provide federal protection of the right to vote. A few hours later, Medgar Evers, the best-known civil rights activist in Mississippi and a field officer in the NAACP, was murdered outside his home.\n\nThe March on Washington\n\nOn August 28,1963, an interracial and interfaith crowd of more than 250,000 Americans demonstrated for social and economic justice in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Key civil rights figures led the march including A. Philip Randolph, Roy Wilkins, Bayard Rustin, Whitney Young, and John Lewis. The most memorable moment came when Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. President Kennedy, concerned about the potential impact of the March on his pending civil rights legislation, initially did not support the event. But, after the successful conclusion of the March, he invited civil rights leaders to the White House where they discussed the need for bi-partisan support of civil rights legislation.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964\n\nDuring the summer and fall of 1963, the Kennedy administration worked to build bi-partisan support for the legislation. In late fall, the comprehensive civil rights bill cleared several hurdles in Congress and won the endorsement of House and Senate Republican leaders. It was not passed, however, before November 22, 1963, when President Kennedy was assassinated. The bill was left in the hands of Lyndon B. Johnson. Before becoming vice president, Johnson had served more than two decades in Congress as a congressman and senator from Texas. He used his substantial political acumen, the assistance of Robert Kennedy\u2019s Justice Department, and the outpouring of emotion after President Kennedy\u2019s assassination to generate passage of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nProvisions of the legislation included: (1) protecting African Americans against discrimination in voter qualification tests; (2) outlawing discrimination in hotels, motels, restaurants, theaters, and all other public accommodations engaged in interstate commerce; (3) authorizing the US Attorney General's Office to file legal suits to enforce desegregation in public schools; (4) authorizing the withdrawal of federal funds from programs practicing discrimination; and (5) outlawing discrimination in employment in any business exceeding 25 people and creating an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to review complaints.\n\nPassed on July 2, 1964, the Civil Rights Act was a crucial step in achieving the civil rights movement's initial goal: full legal equality. Another milestone \u2013 the Voting Rights Act -- was passed in 1965. But more work has remained to be done. Although passage of these laws were significant achievements in the 1960s, discriminatory practices in many areas continue as civil rights activists strive for equality in the 21st century."}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jfk-decided-embrace-civil-rights-moral-issue-1963/story?id=71172778", "page_content": "Fifty-seven years ago today, John F. Kennedy made one of his most important and enduring orations, an appeal to all Americans to accept civil rights as \"a moral issue ... as old as the scriptures and as clear as the Constitution.\"\n\nIt was a welcome declaration for African Americans and other people of color who faced systemic racism and, in much of the South, segregation as a daily reality in American life.\n\nBut Kennedy's speech was long in coming.\n\nWhile he had wrestled with the festering question of civil rights in his two and a half years in the White House, Kennedy had resisted putting the full weight of the presidency behind it, contending that it was a legal issue over which he could do little. Among many others, Martin Luther King chided Kennedy for not bringing \"moral passion\" to the cause of racial equality.\n\nThat changed on June 11, 1963, when Kennedy told his aides, \"I want to go on television tonight.\"\n\n\"If an American, because his skin is dark \u2026 cannot enjoy [a] full and free life,\" the president said in his address that evening, \"...then who among us would want to have the color of his skin changed and stand in his place? Who among us would then be content with the counsels of patience and delay?\"\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy addresses the nation on TV and radio on the issue of civil rights, June 11, 1963. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nWhy did Kennedy change course on civil rights? It came largely due to the influence and evolving view of his brother, Bobby Kennedy, who served as his attorney general and closest advisor.\n\nLike his brother, Bobby Kennedy had seen no great urgency in the cause of racial equality. By his own admission, he \"did not lie awake at night worrying about the problems\" of African Americans. But in the spring of 1963 his perspective began to change.\n\nBy then, Martin Luther King had brought a direct-action civil rights campaign to Birmingham, Alabama, \"the most thoroughly segregated city in the country,\" where demonstrators were seized by vicious police dogs and brutalized by fire hoses that blasted 700 pounds of pressurized water. Arrested and thrown into solitary confinement, King scrawled his seminal \"Letter from the Birmingham Jail,\" from his small, dark cell, contributing to the slow awakening of the country to the urgency of civil rights.\n\nBut a deeper impression was made on Bobby Kennedy in New York City, where he met with a number of African American activists who gathered at his invitation. The group had been assembled by 38-year-old novelist James Baldwin, whose celebrated New Yorker piece titled \"Letter from a Region in My Mind,\" claimed, \"The Negroes of this country may never be able to rise to power, but they are well placed indeed to precipitate chaos and bring down the curtain of the American dream.\"\n\nJohn Kennedy was among those who were taken by Baldwin's powerful essay, and later by a Time magazine cover story on Baldwin called \"The Root of the Negro Problem.\" He encouraged his brother to draw out Baldwin on the matter -- and Baldwin and the \"rowdy\" group he put together at Bobby Kennedy's urging didn't hold back.\n\nThe gathering, in the Kennedy family's spacious Central Park South apartment, began civilly enough before Jerome Smith, a young Freedom Rider who had been arrested and hospitalized for the beatings he sustained, lit into the attorney general about the plight of African Americans. He \"put it like it was,\" recalled actress and singer Lena Horne, \"the plain, basic suffering of being a negro,\" becoming so worked up in his diatribe that he blurted out he wanted to vomit just being in the same room with Bobby Kennedy.\n\nAt least, that's what Kennedy heard. What Smith was trying to convey was that having to make a plea to the attorney general for rights that should intrinsically be his as an American citizen made him feel like vomiting. Nonetheless, the assault hit Kennedy between the eyes. As he turned to ignore Smith, the anger in the room hissed louder. Kennedy sat down, reeling, trying to collect himself.\n\nThe Irish were persecuted, too, he told the group. His grandfather had landed on American shores as the object of prejudice, and now, two generations later, his brother was president. As he took in Kennedy's words, Baldwin's scorn for his insularity was as palpable as his shock at his naivete; his family had been in America far longer, Baldwin countered, and they were still clinging to society's lowest rung.\n\nRev. Martin Luther King and other civil rights leaders meet with President John F. Kennedy in the Oval Office, Aug. 28, 1963. National Archives/Getty Images\n\nThough the meeting lasted three hours, it stayed with Kennedy far longer. \"After Baldwin,\" said Nicholas Katzenbach, Kennedy's deputy attorney general, \"he was in absolute shock. Bobby expected to be an honorary black \u2026 he thought he knew so much -- and he didn't.\"\n\nInitially, Kennedy seethed -- afterward, he excoriated Baldwin to others -- but as his anger cooled, his mind began to change, turning to empathy. In his own way, Bobby Kennedy knew what it was to grow up feeling inferior, in his case in the shadow of his formidable older brothers, and he talked about how he would feel if his children were on the other side of Jim Crow segregation.\n\nIf he had been born black in America, he told an aide several days after the New York meeting, his feelings wouldn't have differed much from those of Baldwin.\n\nAfterward, he urged his brother to embrace civil rights as a moral issue. Though the bulk of President Kennedy's advisors counseled him against making his speech on June 11, claiming it was too soon, Bobby Kennedy was the lone exception. \"He urged it, he felt it, he understood it, and he prevailed,\" deputy attorney general Burke Marshall said. \"I don't think there was anyone in the cabinet -- except the president himself -- who felt that way on these issues, and the president got it from his brother.\"\n\nIt offers a lesson for today. Painful as it may have been, Bobby Kennedy listened to those whose everyday experiences as Americans were far different from his. He acknowledged his privilege, he opened his mind and his heart. And he worked toward making a difference.\n\nAt that crucial moment in history, he did.\n\nMark K.

Kennedy delivering the Civil Rights Address (Wikimedia Commons)\n\n\"Can you believe that white man not only stepped up to the plate, he hit it over the fence!\" That was Martin Luther King, Jr.'s private verdict on President John F. Kennedy's famous Civil Rights Address, delivered fifty years ago on June 11, 1963.\n\nIf King's elation made sense, so did his incredulity. Kennedy had hardly been a beacon of moral resolve on civil rights. It required the Birmingham civil rights movement -- and the tough-minded theory of social change that King spelled out in the \"Letter from Birmingham Jail\" -- to provoke his speech into being. And once pushed into taking a stand with the address, Kennedy and his speechwriter Theodore Sorensen filled it with rhetoric often remarkably similar to King's. Though the address came, ostensibly, in response to a different event -- the fight over the integration at the University of Alabama -- it was full of echoes of \"Letter from Birmingham Jail.\" In a powerful sense, King and the movement were the authors of the president's oratory.\n\nThe speech was a dramatic moment in a season jammed with dramatic events, as America staggered toward non-racial democracy. In his fiery inaugural speech in January of 1963, the new governor of Alabama, George Wallace had pledged, \"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.\" In defiance of Wallace, King and the local movement launched civil rights protests in April in the furiously racist city of Birmingham. With the movement faltering, King decided to violate an injunction banning protests of any sort, and was, as a result, jailed on Good Friday, April 12.\n\nKennedy's speech constituted an about-face, and King grasped that the Birmingham campaign had instigated it\n\nWhile in jail, King read a statement by eight of the leading moderate white clergy in Alabama, condemning the protests and branding King an extremist. The indignant, frazzled leader poured his rejoinder onto newspaper margins and toilet tissue. The iconic document that emerged from those jottings, the \"Letter from Birmingham Jail,\" was always more than a spirited defense of civil disobedience. It was an indictment of white indifference. \"Few members of the oppressor race,\" King insisted, \"can understand the ... passionate yearnings of the oppressed race.\" It was also a declaration of black self-sufficiency (\"If the inexpressible cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the opposition we now face will surely fail.\") and a stirring refusal of patience. \"The word 'Wait!'\" wrote King, \"rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity.\" The \"Letter\" was radical in the scope of its rebuke. King's key targets were not the Klan and Wallace but the very core of American culture, every sort of moderate \"who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom.\"\n\nNeither King's sacrificial act nor his roiling anger was enough to jumpstart the movement, even after he got out of jail on April 20. But in early May, the city's black youth renewed the insurgency. After singing rousing verses of \"I Woke Up With My Mind Stayed on Freedom,\" they burst through the doors of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church and faced down Bull Connor's dogs and fire hoses. Within days, an agreement was forged to desegregate the city. The nation had begun its lurch toward the March on Washington, King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nMeanwhile, the federal court-ordered integration of the University of Alabama loomed on June 11. Governor Wallace vowed to stand in the schoolhouse door to block the mixing of races. Kennedy's speech, the one that so impressed and surprised King, came just hours after forcing Wallace to step aside. \"We are confronted primarily with a moral issue,\" he declared. \"It is as old as the scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution.\" The president was finally using language the demonstrators could appreciate: \"We preach freedom around the world,\" he said, \"but are we to say to the world, and . . .to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes ...?\"\n\nThroughout the speech Kennedy seemed to be channeling the \"Letter from Birmingham Jail.\" King had invited white people to put themselves in a black person's shoes: \"When you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will,\" or \" when your first name becomes 'nigger,' your middle name becomes 'boy,' ... then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait.\" Kennedy, too, used the place-trading device: \"If a Negro can't enjoy the full and free life which all of us want, then who among us would be content to have the color of his skin changed and stand in his place?\"\n\nThe president's address also resembled King's \"Letter\" in rejecting the idea that blacks should have to wait for equality. \"Who among us,\" Kennedy demanded, \"would then be content with counsels of patience and delay?\" He mimicked King's critique of \"appalling silence\": \"Those who do nothing are inviting shame as well as violence.\" The president even picked up the mass meeting chant -- \"Now is the time!\" Said Kennedy, \"Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise.\"\n\nDespite that drumbeat of immediacy, Kennedy's call to conscience was belated as well as brave. The president had long epitomized the moderates whom King had blasted in the \"Letter\" as the true \"stumbling block\" to justice. In his inaugural address, Kennedy promised to \"pay any price\" to spread freedom around the globe but he hadn't been willing to do that for black people in the United States. Kennedy, the ever risk-averse pragmatist, kept telling King to \"wait\" -- exactly the reaction King deplored in the \"Letter.\" When Attorney General Robert Kennedy, afraid that a black child might be maimed in the protests, called King to get him to call off the insurgency of the young, King retorted, \"[Black children] are hurt every day.\"\n\nSo Kennedy's speech constituted an about-face, and King grasped that the Birmingham campaign had instigated it. In the May 10 mass meeting at which the victory in Birmingham was announced, a jubilant, downhome King recounted,\n\nThose business and professional leaders were sayin', \"We're tired of these niggers, and there's nothing to do but tell the government to send the National Guard here and get this thing under martial law. . . . These niggers are just not gonna stop.\" And when they got out for lunch, and saw all those Negroes standing on the sidewalk singing \"We shall overcome\" and they \"Won't let nobody turn me round,\" I heard that when they got back in there after the lunch hour, they started sayin', \"Now, let's see, I think we could grant part one,\" and they moved down to part two and extended that.* (To hear the full, unpublished address, listen to the embedded sound file below.)\n\nMay 10 King on the Victory in Birmingham by user1981449\n\nKing had no doubt that the protests were working the same magic on the president and nudging him toward a more energetic stance on civil rights. \"When things started happening down here, Mr. Kennedy got disturbed . . . He is battling for the minds and the hearts of men in Asia and Africa. . . And they're not gonna respect the United States of America if she deprives men and women of the basic rights of life because of the color of their skin. Mr. Kennedy knows this.\" On May 3, a photographer captured the iconic image of a German Shepherd that seemed to be lunging to bite a young black boy. \"And when that picture went all over Asia and Africa and England and France, Mr. Kennedy said, 'Bobby, you better get your assistant down there and look into this matter. It's a dangerous situation for our image abroad.'\"\n\nThe truth went further than King imagined, though. The picture had in fact aroused something in Kennedy beyond concerns about America's image. At a private but recorded White House meeting on May 4, he said the picture \"made him sick.\" Kennedy sounds befuddled: he decries the black situation in Birmingham as \"intolerable\"; he exudes frustration (\"what law can you pass to do anything about [local] police power\"); he concedes \"we have done not enough [on civil rights]\"; yet he careens, \"but we have shoved and pushed . . . and there's nothing my brother's given more time to.\"\n\n\"If I were a Negro, I would be awfully sore,\" the president acknowledged. And then, as if responding to King's argument in the \"Letter\" that when whites said \"wait\" they really meant \"never,\" Kennedy added: \"I'm not saying anybody ought to be patient.\"\n\nIn the end, Kennedy's turn-about vindicated the key premise of the \"Letter from Birmingham Jail\": Blacks could not bank on moral appeal or empathy alone, let alone some intrinsic force of \"American exceptionalism,\" to awaken the conscience of whites. The unruliness of \"creative tension\" was required to galvanize the state to act on behalf of the suffering. As the president put it on June 4, \"And this may be the only way these things come to a head. We're going to end up with the National Guard in there and all sorts of trouble.\"\n\n\"All sorts of trouble\" underscores an ironic, unsettling truth: the white fear of violence pushed events forward too. In his June 11 address, President Kennedy observed, \"The fires of frustration and discord are burning in every city, North and South ... Redress is sought in the streets. . .which create[s] tensions and threaten[s] violence.\" Surely, that specter of mayhem ran counter to King's faith in nonviolence. And yet its power to transfix a president confirmed the \"Letter's\" recognition: \"Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.\" Fifty years ago today, as the president delivered his address, Martin Luther King, Jr., celebrated a victory wrought by that hardboiled truth.\n\n\n\n\n\n*The recording of Martin Luther King Jr.'s remarks on May 10, celebrating the victory in Birmingham, is posted here courtesy of the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. The recording was made by Reverend C. Herbert Oliver.\n\nReverend C. Herbert Oliver was a pioneering activist for racial justice in Birmingham beginning in the 1940s.

His advisers had heard from King's wife, Coretta, that she was very worried about her husband's safety, fearing he could be killed in prison.\n\n\"Many of President Kennedy's advisors encouraged him not to get involved,\" biographer Barbara Perry explained.\n\nBut one of them, Robert Sargent Shriver, Jr., Kennedy\u2019s soon to be brother-in-law, encouraged him to call Mrs. King. Kennedy did.\n\n\"I know this must be very hard for you, and I just wanted you to know that I was thinking about you and Dr. King,\" he reportedly told her. \"If there is anything I can do to help, please feel free to call on me.\"\n\nThe next day, his brother, Robert Kennedy, made a well-placed phone call to a judge, helping secure King's release. The moves earned Kennedy the influential endorsement of one of the country's most prominent civil rights leaders.\n\n\"This man was willing to wipe the tears from my daughter[-in-law]'s eyes,\u201d King said. \"I\u2019ve got a suitcase of votes, and I\u2019m going to take them to Mr. Kennedy.\"\n\nThe news of the Kennedy brothers' actions spread quickly among the African-American community, in large part because of the Kennedy campaign's efforts.\n\n\"The Kennedy campaign made sure they got something, what was called the Blue Bomb, this pamphlet where they advertised what Kennedy had done [for King], and made sure that on the eve of the election, the final Sunday of the campaign, this was distributed at black churches all around the country,\" Nick Bryant, author of \u201cThe Bystander: John F. Kennedy and the Struggle for Black Equality,\u201d told America Tonight.\n\nBut the news gained little traction elsewhere. \"I think it slipped past white America,\" Bryant added. \"They had no idea this had happened. Knew little or nothing about it. It was in the back pages of The New York Times.\"\n\nKennedy went on to win more than 70 percent of African-American votes across the country, giving him him the competitive advantage he needed in important swing states like Illinois, Michigan and South Carolina, and an 84-vote electoral victory.\n\n\"It is amazing that Jack Kennedy won the presidency,\" Perry said. \"He did only by a whisker in the popular vote.\""}], "Harry S. Kennedy was a key figure in the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.": [{"url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/immigration-act-1965/408409/", "page_content": "The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, whose 50th anniversary comes on October 3, officially committed the United States, for the first time, to accepting immigrants of all nationalities on a roughly equal basis. The law eliminated the use of national-origin quotas, under which the overwhelming majority of immigrant visas were set aside for people coming from northern and western Europe.\n\nIn the subsequent half century, the pattern of U.S. immigration changed dramatically. The share of the U.S. population born outside the country tripled and became far more diverse. Seven out of every eight immigrants in 1960 were from Europe; by 2010, nine out of ten were coming from other parts of the world. The 1965 Immigration Act was largely responsible for that shift. No law passed in the 20th century altered the country\u2019s demographic character quite so thoroughly. But its effects were largely inadvertent. The law\u2019s biggest impact on immigration patterns resulted from provisions meant to thwart its ability to change much at all.\n\nThe United States has long struggled to define what it really means to become American and which immigrants qualify. George Washington declared the country was open to \u201cthe oppressed and persecuted of all Nations and Religions,\u201d but the idea persists that America is a \u201cJudeo-Christian nation,\u201d that being a Muslim American is a contradiction in terms, and that some nationalities are inferior to others.\n\nSuch questions should have been settled 50 years ago with the passage of the 1965 Act. For supporters, the intent of the legislation was to bring immigration policy into line with other anti-discrimination measures, not to fundamentally change the face of the nation. \u201cWe have removed all elements of second-class citizenship from our laws by the [1964] Civil Rights Act,\u201d declared Vice President Hubert Humphrey. \u201cWe must in 1965 remove all elements in our immigration law which suggest there are second-class people.\u201d\n\nAt the signing ceremony on Liberty Island, President Lyndon Johnson said the new law \u201ccorrects a cruel and enduring wrong in the conduct of the American nation,\u201d but he downplayed its expected effect. \u201cThe bill that we sign today is not a revolutionary bill,\u201d he insisted.\n\nOpponents of the reform proposal had argued that the United States was fundamentally a European country and should stay that way. \u201cThe people of Ethiopia have the same right to come to the United States under this bill as the people from England, the people of France, the people of Germany, [and] the people of Holland,\u201d complained Senator Sam Ervin, a Democrat from North Carolina. \u201cWith all due respect to Ethiopia,\u201d Ervin said, \u201cI don\u2019t know of any contributions that Ethiopia has made to the making of America.\u201d The critics highlighted population pressures in the developing world and predicted the United States would find itself inundated by desperate migrants from poverty-stricken countries.\n\nThe more typical response to the nativist arguments was simply to deny that the proposed immigration reform would bring any significant shift in the pattern of immigration.\n\nOnly a few supporters of the 1965 legislation said the country could and should be willing to accommodate more immigrants of color. \u201cThe American nation today stands as eloquent proof that there is no inherent contradiction between unity and diversity,\u201d declared Representative Peter Rodino of New Jersey, a Democrat of Italian origin. The more typical response to the nativist arguments was simply to deny that the proposed immigration reform would bring any significant shift in the pattern of immigration. Secretary of State Dean Rusk, testifying in Congress, said he saw no indication of \u201ca world situation where everybody is just straining to move to the United States.\u201d\n\nSuch assurances did not sway conservative critics of the reform, but a last-minute change in the legislative language did alleviate their fears of a massive African and Asian influx. The original version of the 1965 Act, cosponsored by Senator Philip Hart of Michigan and Representative Emmanuel Celler of New York, both liberal Democrats, favored those immigrants whose skills were \u201cespecially advantageous\u201d to the United States. Conservatives, led by Representative Michael Feighan, an Ohio Democrat, managed to change those priorities, giving visa preferences instead to foreigners who were seeking to join their families in the United States. Feighan, who chaired the House Immigration subcommittee, argued that a family-unification preference in immigration law would establish, in the words of a glowing profile in the American Legion magazine, \u201ca naturally operating national-origins system,\u201d because it would favor immigration from the northern and western European countries that at the time dominated the U.S. population.\n\nFeighan and others were wrong. The heightened emphasis on family unification, rather than replicating the existing ethnic structure of the American population, led to the phenomenon of chain migration. The naturalization of a single immigrant from an Asian or African or Hispanic background opened the door to his or her brothers and sisters and their spouses, who in turn could sponsor their own brothers and sisters. Within a few decades, family unification had become the driving force in U.S. immigration, and it favored exactly those nationalities the critics of the 1965 Act had hoped to keep out, because those were the people most determined to move.\n\nIn the end, passage of the law did not resolve the question of America\u2019s identity, and the debate continued. Some conservatives subsequently argued that the 1965 Immigration Act had been a scheme to curry favor with liberal special interest groups or even to establish a future demographic base for the Democratic Party. But such analyses missed the irony at the heart of a law whose most revolutionary provision was originally intended to bolster the status quo.\n\nThe debate over U.S. immigration policy has long focused on what to do about people who come to the country unlawfully. Even legal immigrants face hostility these days, though, as the prospect of a nonwhite U.S. majority prompts a revival of nativist sentiment. Xenophobia was evident as well during the debate over the 1965 act, but one difference is that the country now has 50 years of experience successfully integrating non-European immigrants. The 1965 Immigration Act has never gotten the attention it warrants as the law that finally made America the open nation it had long claimed to be. Its 50th anniversary could be an occasion for celebration."}, {"url": "https://openstax.org/books/us-history/pages/29-1-the-kennedy-promise", "page_content": "Learning Objectives By the end of this section, you will be able to: Assess Kennedy\u2019s Cold War strategy\n\nDescribe Kennedy\u2019s contribution to the civil rights movement\n\nFigure 29.2\n\nIn the 1950s, President Dwight D. Eisenhower presided over a United States that prized conformity over change. Although change naturally occurred, as it does in every era, it was slow and greeted warily. By the 1960s, however, the pace of change had quickened and its scope broadened, as restive and energetic waves of World War II veterans and baby boomers of both sexes and all ethnicities began to make their influence felt politically, economically, and culturally. No one symbolized the hopes and energies of the new decade more than John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the nation\u2019s new, young, and seemingly healthful, president. Kennedy had emphasized the country\u2019s aspirations and challenges as a \u201cnew frontier\u201d when accepting his party\u2019s nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, California.\n\nTHE NEW FRONTIER The son of Joseph P. Kennedy, a wealthy Boston business owner and former ambassador to Great Britain, John F. Kennedy graduated from Harvard University and went on to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1946. Even though he was young and inexperienced, his reputation as a war hero who had saved the crew of his PT boat after it was destroyed by the Japanese helped him to win election over more seasoned candidates, as did his father\u2019s fortune. In 1952, he was elected to the U.S. Senate for the first of two terms. For many, including Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., a historian and member of Kennedy\u2019s administration, Kennedy represented a bright, shining future in which the United States would lead the way in solving the most daunting problems facing the world. Kennedy\u2019s popular reputation as a great politician undoubtedly owes much to the style and attitude he personified. He and his wife Jacqueline conveyed a sense of optimism and youthfulness. \u201cJackie\u201d was an elegant first lady who wore designer dresses, served French food in the White House, and invited classical musicians to entertain at state functions. \u201cJack\u201d Kennedy, or JFK, went sailing off the coast of his family\u2019s Cape Cod estate and socialized with celebrities (Figure 29.3). Few knew that behind Kennedy\u2019s healthful and sporty image was a gravely ill man whose wartime injuries caused him daily agony. Figure 29.3 John F. Kennedy and first lady Jacqueline, shown here in the White House in 1962 (a) and watching the America\u2019s Cup race that same year (b), brought youth, glamour, and optimism to Washington, DC, and the nation. Nowhere was Kennedy\u2019s style more evident than in the first televised presidential debate held on September 23, 1960, between him and his Republican opponent Vice President Richard M. Nixon. Seventy million viewers watched the debate on television; millions more heard it on the radio. Radio listeners judged Nixon the winner, whereas those who watched the debate on television believed the more telegenic Kennedy made the better showing. Click and Explore View television footage of the first Kennedy-Nixon debate at the JFK Presidential Library and Museum. Kennedy did not appeal to all voters, however. Many feared that because he was Roman Catholic, his decisions would be influenced by the Pope. Even traditional Democratic supporters, like the head of the United Auto Workers, Walter Reuther, feared that a Catholic candidate would lose the support of Protestants. Many southern Democrats also disliked Kennedy because of his liberal position on civil rights. To shore up support for Kennedy in the South, Lyndon B. Johnson, the Protestant Texan who was Senate majority leader, was added to the Democratic ticket as the vice presidential candidate. In the end, Kennedy won the election by the closest margin since 1888, defeating Nixon with only 0.01 percent more of the record sixty-seven million votes cast. His victory in the Electoral College was greater: 303 electoral votes to Nixon\u2019s 219. Kennedy\u2019s win made him both the youngest man elected to the presidency and the first U.S. president born in the twentieth century. Kennedy dedicated his inaugural address to the theme of a new future for the United States. \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country,\u201d he challenged his fellow Americans. His lofty goals ranged from fighting poverty to winning the space race against the Soviet Union with a moon landing. He assembled an administration of energetic people assured of their ability to shape the future. Dean Rusk was named secretary of state. Robert McNamara, the former president of Ford Motor Company, became secretary of defense. Kennedy appointed his younger brother Robert as attorney general, much to the chagrin of many who viewed the appointment as a blatant example of nepotism. Kennedy\u2019s domestic reform plans remained hampered, however, by his narrow victory and lack of support from members of his own party, especially southern Democrats. As a result, he remained hesitant to propose new civil rights legislation. His achievements came primarily in poverty relief and care for the disabled. Unemployment benefits were expanded, the food stamps program was piloted, and the school lunch program was extended to more students. In October 1963, the passage of the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act increased support for public mental health services.\n\nKENNEDY THE COLD WARRIOR Kennedy focused most of his energies on foreign policy, an arena in which he had been interested since his college years and in which, like all presidents, he was less constrained by the dictates of Congress. Kennedy, who had promised in his inaugural address to protect the interests of the \u201cfree world,\u201d engaged in Cold War politics on a variety of fronts. For example, in response to the lead that the Soviets had taken in the space race when Yuri Gagarin became the first human to successfully orbit the earth, Kennedy urged Congress to not only put a man into space (Figure 29.4) but also land an American on the moon, a goal finally accomplished in 1969. This investment advanced a variety of military technologies, especially the nation\u2019s long-range missile capability, resulting in numerous profitable spin-offs for the aviation and communication industries. It also funded a growing middle class of government workers, engineers, and defense contractors in states ranging from California to Texas to Florida\u2014a region that would come to be known as the Sun Belt\u2014becoming a symbol of American technological superiority. At the same time, however, the use of massive federal resources for space technologies did not change the economic outlook for low-income communities and underprivileged regions. Figure 29.4 On May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard became the first American to travel into space, as millions across the country watched the television coverage of his Mercury-Redstone mission, including Vice President Johnson, President Kennedy, and Jacqueline Kennedy in the White House. (credit: National Archives and Records Administration) To counter Soviet influence in the developing world, Kennedy supported a variety of measures. One of these was the Alliance for Progress, which collaborated with the governments of Latin American countries to promote economic growth and social stability in nations whose populations might find themselves drawn to communism. Kennedy also established the Agency for International Development to oversee the distribution of foreign aid, and he founded the Peace Corps, which recruited idealistic young people to undertake humanitarian projects in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. He hoped that by augmenting the food supply and improving healthcare and education, the U.S. government could encourage developing nations to align themselves with the United States and reject Soviet or Chinese overtures. The first group of Peace Corps volunteers departed for the four corners of the globe in 1961, serving as an instrument of \u201csoft power\u201d in the Cold War. Kennedy\u2019s various aid projects, like the Peace Corps, fit closely with his administration\u2019s flexible response, which Robert McNamara advocated as a better alternative to the all-or-nothing defensive strategy of mutually assured destruction favored during Eisenhower\u2019s presidency. The plan was to develop different strategies, tactics, and even military capabilities to respond more appropriately to small or medium-sized insurgencies, and political or diplomatic crises. One component of flexible response was the Green Berets, a U.S. Army Special Forces unit trained in counterinsurgency\u2014the military suppression of rebel and nationalist groups in foreign nations. Much of the Kennedy administration\u2019s new approach to defense, however, remained focused on the ability and willingness of the United States to wage both conventional and nuclear warfare, and Kennedy continued to call for increases in the American nuclear arsenal. Cuba Kennedy\u2019s multifaceted approach to national defense is exemplified by his careful handling of the Communist government of Fidel Castro in Cuba. In January 1959, following the overthrow of the corrupt and dictatorial regime of Fulgencio Batista, Castro assumed leadership of the new Cuban government. The progressive reforms he began indicated that he favored Communism, and his pro-Soviet foreign policy frightened the Eisenhower administration, which asked the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to find a way to remove him from power. Rather than have the U.S. military invade the small island nation, less than one hundred miles from Florida, and risk the world\u2019s criticism, the CIA instead trained a small force of Cuban exiles for the job. After landing at the Bay of Pigs on the Cuban coast, these insurgents, the CIA believed, would inspire their countrymen to rise up and topple Castro\u2019s regime. The United States also promised air support for the invasion. Kennedy agreed to support the previous administration\u2019s plans, and on April 17, 1961, approximately fourteen hundred Cuban exiles stormed ashore at the designated spot. However, Kennedy feared domestic criticism and worried about Soviet retaliation elsewhere in the world, such as Berlin. He cancelled the anticipated air support, which enabled the Cuban army to easily defeat the insurgents. The hoped-for uprising of the Cuban people also failed to occur. The surviving members of the exile army were taken into custody. The Bay of Pigs invasion was a major foreign policy disaster for President Kennedy. The event highlighted how difficult it would be for the United States to act against the Castro administration. The following year, the Soviet Union sent troops and technicians to Cuba to strengthen its new ally against further U.S. military plots. Then, on October 14, U.S. spy planes took aerial photographs that confirmed the presence of long-range ballistic missile sites in Cuba. The United States was now within easy reach of Soviet nuclear warheads (Figure 29.5). Figure 29.5 This low-level U.S. Navy photograph of San Cristobal, Cuba, clearly shows one of the sites built to launch intermediate-range missiles at the United States (a). As the date indicates, it was taken on the last day of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Following the crisis, Kennedy met with the reconnaissance pilots who flew the Cuban missions (b). credit a: modification of work by National Archives and Records Administration; credit b: modification of work by Central Intelligence Agency) On October 22, Kennedy demanded that Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev remove the missiles. He also ordered a naval quarantine placed around Cuba to prevent Soviet ships from approaching. Despite his use of the word \u201cquarantine\u201d instead of \u201cblockade,\u201d for a blockade was considered an act of war, a potential war with the Soviet Union was nevertheless on the president\u2019s mind. As U.S. ships headed for Cuba, the army was told to prepare for war, and Kennedy appeared on national television to declare his intention to defend the Western Hemisphere from Soviet aggression. The world held its breath awaiting the Soviet reply. Realizing how serious the United States was, Khrushchev sought a peaceful solution to the crisis, overruling those in his government who urged a harder stance. Behind the scenes, Robert Kennedy and Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin worked toward a compromise that would allow both superpowers to back down without either side\u2019s seeming intimidated by the other. On October 26, Khrushchev agreed to remove the Russian missiles in exchange for Kennedy\u2019s promise not to invade Cuba. On October 27, Kennedy\u2019s agreement was made public, and the crisis ended. Not made public, but nevertheless part of the agreement, was Kennedy\u2019s promise to remove U.S. warheads from Turkey, as close to Soviet targets as the Cuban missiles had been to American ones. The showdown between the United States and the Soviet Union over Cuba\u2019s missiles had put the world on the brink of a nuclear war. Both sides already had long-range bombers with nuclear weapons airborne or ready for launch, and were only hours away from the first strike. In the long run, this nearly catastrophic example of nuclear brinksmanship ended up making the world safer. A telephone \u201chot line\u201d was installed, linking Washington and Moscow to avert future crises, and in 1963, Kennedy and Khrushchev signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty, prohibiting tests of nuclear weapons in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Vietnam Cuba was not the only arena in which the United States sought to contain the advance of Communism. In Indochina, nationalist independence movements, most notably Vietnam\u2019s Viet Minh under the leadership of Ho Chi Minh, had strong Communist sympathies. President Harry S. Truman had no love for France\u2019s colonial regime in Southeast Asia but did not want to risk the loyalty of its Western European ally against the Soviet Union. In 1950, the Truman administration sent a small military advisory group to Vietnam and provided financial aid to help France defeat the Viet Minh. In 1954, Vietnamese forces finally defeated the French, and the country was temporarily divided at the seventeenth parallel. Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh controlled the North. In the South, the last Vietnamese emperor and ally to France, Bao Dai, named the French-educated, anti-Communist Ngo Dinh Diem as his prime minister. But Diem refused to abide by the Geneva Accords, the treaty ending the conflict that called for countrywide national elections in 1956, with the victor to rule a reunified nation. After a fraudulent election in the South in 1955, he ousted Bao Dai and proclaimed himself president of the Republic of Vietnam. He cancelled the 1956 elections in the South and began to round up Communists and supporters of Ho Chi Minh. Realizing that Diem would never agree to the reunification of the country under Ho Chi Minh\u2019s leadership, the North Vietnamese began efforts to overthrow the government of the South by encouraging insurgents to attack South Vietnamese officials. By 1960, North Vietnam had also created the National Liberation Front (NLF) to resist Diem and carry out an insurgency in the South. The United States, fearing the spread of Communism under Ho Chi Minh, supported Diem, assuming he would create a democratic, pro-Western government in South Vietnam. However, Diem\u2019s oppressive and corrupt government made him a very unpopular ruler, particularly with farmers, students, and Buddhists, and many in the South actively assisted the NLF and North Vietnam in trying to overthrow his government. When Kennedy took office, Diem\u2019s government was faltering. Continuing the policies of the Eisenhower administration, Kennedy supplied Diem with money and military advisors to prop up his government (Figure 29.6). By November 1963, there were sixteen thousand U.S. troops in Vietnam, training members of that country\u2019s special forces and flying air missions that dumped defoliant chemicals on the countryside to expose North Vietnamese and NLF forces and supply routes. A few weeks before Kennedy\u2019s own death, Diem and his brother Nhu were assassinated by South Vietnamese military officers after U.S. officials had indicated their support for a new regime. Figure 29.6 Following the French retreat from Indochina, the United States stepped in to prevent what it believed was a building Communist threat in the region. Under President Kennedy\u2019s leadership, the United States sent thousands of military advisors to Vietnam. (credit: Abbie Rowe)\n\nTENTATIVE STEPS TOWARD CIVIL RIGHTS Cold War concerns, which guided U.S. policy in Cuba and Vietnam, also motivated the Kennedy administration\u2019s steps toward racial equality. Realizing that legal segregation and widespread discrimination hurt the country\u2019s chances of gaining allies in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, the federal government increased efforts to secure the civil rights of African Americans in the 1960s. During his presidential campaign, Kennedy had intimated his support for civil rights, and his efforts to secure the release of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., who was arrested following a demonstration, won him the African American vote. Lacking widespread backing in Congress, however, and anxious not to offend White southerners, Kennedy was cautious in assisting African Americans in their fight for full citizenship rights. His strongest focus was on securing the voting rights of African Americans. Kennedy feared the loss of support from southern White Democrats and the impact a struggle over civil rights could have on his foreign policy agenda as well as on his reelection in 1964. But he thought voter registration drives far preferable to the boycotts, sit-ins, and integration marches that had generated such intense global media coverage in previous years. Encouraged by Congress\u2019s passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1960, which permitted federal courts to appoint referees to guarantee that qualified persons would be registered to vote, Kennedy focused on the passage of a constitutional amendment outlawing poll taxes, a tactic that southern states used to disenfranchise African American voters. Originally proposed by President Truman\u2019s Committee on Civil Rights, the idea had been largely forgotten during Eisenhower\u2019s time in office. Kennedy, however, revived it and convinced Spessard Holland, a conservative Florida senator, to introduce the proposed amendment in Congress. It passed both houses of Congress and was sent to the states for ratification in September 1962. Kennedy also reacted to the demands of the civil rights movement for equality in education. For example, when African American student James Meredith, encouraged by Kennedy\u2019s speeches, attempted to enroll at the segregated University of Mississippi in 1962, riots broke out on campus (Figure 29.7). The president responded by sending the U.S. Army and National Guard to Oxford, Mississippi, to support the U.S. Marshals that his brother Robert, the attorney general, had dispatched. Figure 29.7 Escorted by a U.S. marshal and the assistant attorney general for civil rights, James Meredith (center) enters the University of Mississippi over the riotous protests of White southerners. Meredith later attempted a \u201cMarch against Fear\u201d in 1966 to protest the inability of southern African Americans to vote. His walk ended when a passing motorist shot and wounded him. (credit: Library of Congress) Following similar violence at the University of Alabama when two African American students, Vivian Malone and James Hood, attempted to enroll in 1963, Kennedy responded with a bill that would give the federal government greater power to enforce school desegregation, prohibit segregation in public accommodations, and outlaw discrimination in employment. Kennedy would not live to see his bill enacted; it would become law during Lyndon Johnson\u2019s administration as the 1964 Civil Rights Act."}, {"url": "https://www.history.com/topics/immigration/us-immigration-since-1965", "page_content": "The Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, also known as the Hart-Celler Act, abolished an earlier quota system based on national origin and established a new immigration policy based on reuniting immigrant families and attracting skilled labor to the United States. Over the next four decades, the policies put into effect in 1965 would greatly change the demographic makeup of the American population, as immigrants entering the United States under the new legislation came increasingly from countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, as opposed to Europe.\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Act of 1965\n\nCorbis/Getty Images President Lyndon B. Johnson signs the Immigration Bill of 1965.\n\nBy the early 1960s, calls to reform U.S. immigration policy had mounted, thanks in no small part to the growing strength of the civil rights movement. At the time, immigration was based on the national-origins quota system in place since the 1920s, under which each nationality was assigned a quota based on its representation in past U.S. census figures. The civil rights movement\u2019s focus on equal treatment regardless of race or nationality led many to view the quota system as backward and discriminatory. In particular, Greeks, Poles, Portuguese and Italians\u2013of whom increasing numbers were seeking to enter the U.S.\u2013claimed that the quota system discriminated against them in favor of Northern Europeans. President John F. Kennedy even took up the immigration reform cause, giving a speech in June 1963 calling the quota system \u201cintolerable.\u201d\n\nDid you know? A report in early 2009 by the DHS's Office of Immigration Statistics estimated the number of \"unauthorized immigrants\" in the United States at 10.7 million, down from 11.6 million in 2008. The recent decline in immigration coincided with the economic downturn in the U.S., but figures were still up from 2000, when illegal immigrants numbered some 8.5 million.\n\nAfter Kennedy\u2019s assassination that November, Congress began debating and would eventually pass the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, co-sponsored by Representative Emanuel Celler of New York and Senator Philip Hart of Michigan and heavily supported by the late president\u2019s brother, Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts. During Congressional debates, a number of experts testified that little would effectively change under the reformed legislation, and it was seen more as a matter of principle to have a more open policy. Indeed, on signing the act into law in October 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson stated that the act \u201cis not a revolutionary bill. It does not affect the lives of millions\u2026.It will not reshape the structure of our daily lives or add importantly to either our wealth or our power.\u201d\n\nImmediate Impact\n\nIn reality (and with the benefit of hindsight), the bill signed in 1965 marked a dramatic break with past immigration policy, and would have an immediate and lasting impact. In place of the national-origins quota system, the act provided for preferences to be made according to categories, such as relatives of U.S. citizens or permanent residents, those with skills deemed useful to the United States or refugees of violence or unrest. Though it abolished quotas per se, the system did place caps on per-country and total immigration, as well as caps on each category. As in the past, family reunification was a major goal, and the new immigration policy would increasingly allow entire families to uproot themselves from other countries and reestablish their lives in the U.S.\n\nIn the first five years after the bill\u2019s passage, immigration to the U.S. from Asian countries\u2013especially those fleeing war-torn Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Cambodia)\u2013would more than quadruple. (Under past immigration policies, Asian immigrants had been effectively barred from entry.) Other Cold War-era conflicts during the 1960s and 1970s saw millions of people fleeing poverty or the hardships of communist regimes in Cuba, Eastern Europe and elsewhere to seek their fortune on American shores. All told, in the three decades following passage of the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, more than 18 million legal immigrants entered the United States, more than three times the number admitted over the preceding 30 years.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, the policies put into effect by the Immigration Act of 1965 had greatly changed the face of the American population. Whereas in the 1950s, more than half of all immigrants were Europeans and just 6 percent were Asians, by the 1990s only 16 percent were Europeans and 31 percent were of Asian descent, while the percentages of Latino and African immigrants had also jumped significantly. Between 1965 and 2000, the highest number of immigrants (4.3 million) to the U.S. came from Mexico, in addition to some 1.4 million from the Philippines. Korea, the Dominican Republic, India, Cuba and Vietnam were also leading sources of immigrants, each sending between 700,000 and 800,000 over this period.\n\nContinuing Source of Debate\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, illegal immigration was a constant source of political debate, as immigrants continue to pour into the United States, mostly by land routes through Canada and Mexico. The Immigration Reform Act in 1986 attempted to address the issue by providing better enforcement of immigration policies and creating more possibilities to seek legal immigration. The act included two amnesty programs for unauthorized aliens, and collectively granted amnesty to more than 3 million illegal aliens. Another piece of immigration legislation, the 1990 Immigration Act, modified and expanded the 1965 act, increasing the total level of immigration to 700,000. The law also provided for the admission of immigrants from \u201cunderrepresented\u201d countries to increase the diversity of the immigrant flow.\n\nThe economic recession that hit the country in the early 1990s was accompanied by a resurgence of anti-immigrant feeling, including among lower-income Americans competing for jobs with immigrants willing to work for lower wages. In 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, which addressed border enforcement and the use of social programs by immigrants.\n\nImmigration in the 21st Century\n\nIn the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 created the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which took over many immigration service and enforcement functions formerly performed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). With some modifications, the policies put into place by the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965 are the same ones governing U.S. immigration in the early 21st century. Non-citizens currently enter the United States lawfully in one of two ways, either by receiving either temporary (non-immigrant) admission or permanent (immigrant) admission. A member of the latter category is classified as a lawful permanent resident, and receives a green card granting them eligibility to work in the United States and to eventually apply for citizenship.\n\nThere could be perhaps no greater reflection of the impact of immigration than the 2008 election of Barack Obama, the son of a Kenyan father and an American mother (from Kansas), as the nation\u2019s first African-American president. Eighty-five percent white in 1965, the nation\u2019s population was one-third minority in 2009 and is on track for a nonwhite majority by 2042."}, {"url": "https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2015/09/17/fifty-year-later-a-brief-history-of-the-immigration-act-of-1965/", "page_content": "Today\u2019s post comes from Rebecca Brenner, an intern in the History Office at the National Archives in Washington, D.C.\n\nFifty years ago on October 3, 1965, at the base of the Statue of Liberty, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Immigration Act of 1965 into law.\n\nThe act was an important milestone in American immigration history. It was a significant improvement from the National Origins Act of 1924, which barred Asian immigrants, limited Latin American immigrants, and established rigid immigration quotas for European countries.\n\nThese quotas, established in an era of post\u2013World War I isolationism and xenophobia, lasted from 1924 through 1965:\n\nArmenia: 124\n\nAustralia: 121\n\nAustria: 785\n\nBelgium: 512\n\nCzechoslovakia: 3,073\n\nEstonia: 124\n\nFrance: 3,954\n\nGermany: 51,227\n\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland: 34,007\n\nHungary: 473\n\nIrish Free State: 28,567\n\nItaly: 3,845\n\nLatvia: 142\n\nLithuania: 344\n\nNetherlands: 1,648\n\nNorway: 6,453\n\nPoland: 5,962\n\nRussia: 2,248\n\nSweden: 9,561\n\nSwitzerland: 2,081\n\nYugoslavia: 671\n\nAliens needed to apply for spots on the quota in their country of birth, regardless of where they and their family lived. Some quota waiting lists were a dozen years long, while others were not filled.\n\nThe Immigration Act of 1965 abolished this quota system and eliminated the formally racial character of immigration to the United States.\n\nThe act aimed for immigration law to distinguish between hemispheres of origin, instead of discriminating on the basis of ethnicity or race.\n\nIt also prioritized keeping families together, and put a preference on skilled workers.\n\nAccording to records in the Center for Legislative Archives, the net effect of the final bill was to admit 320,000 people to the United States each year. This number included 120,000 from the Western hemisphere and 170,000 from the rest of the world, as well as 30,000 immediate relatives of U.S. citizens.\n\nOn August 25, 1965, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill with a vote of 318-95.\n\nOn September 22, the U.S. Senate passed it with a vote of 76-18.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Quarterly in October 1965, a combination of factors enabled its passage:\n\nThe Democratic majority in Congress supported the Johnson administration, which viewed quotas as discriminatory.\n\nThe general public was not as interested in the act as it was in civil rights or health care, and as a result, provided less opposition.\n\nSpecial interest groups were willing to compromise with each other.\n\nThe National Archives holds many records related to the history of immigration. The Records of Rights exhibit at the National Archives in Washington, DC, includes a compelling section on American immigration.\n\nAnd on September 17, Constitution Day, the annual naturalization ceremony for new American citizens will take place in front of the Constitution at the National Archives in Washington, DC."}, {"url": "https://www.history.com/news/immigration-act-1965-changes", "page_content": "When the U.S. Congress passed\u2014and President Lyndon B.

Johnson signs the Immigration Act of 1965 on Liberty Island in New York Harbor with a view of the New York City skyline in the background.\n\nThe 1965 Act Aimed to Eliminate Race Discrimination in Immigration\n\nIn 1960, Pew notes, 84 percent of U.S. immigrants were born in Europe or Canada; 6 percent were from Mexico, 3.8 percent were from South and East Asia, 3.5 percent were from Latin America and 2.7 percent were from other parts of the world. In 2017, European and Canadian immigrants totaled 13.2 percent, while Mexicans totaled 25.3 percent, other Latin Americans totaled 25.1 percent, Asians totaled 27.4 percent and other populations totaled 9 percent.\n\nThe 1965 act has to be understood as a result of the civil rights movement, and the general effort to eliminate race discrimination from U.S. law, says Gabriel \u201cJack\u201d Chin, immigration law professor at University of California, Davis and co-editor of The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act: Legislating a New America.\n\nREAD MORE: U.S. Immigration Timeline\n\nBettmann Archive/Getty Images President Lyndon B.

Kennedy, Chin notes, whose pamphlet written as a senator was published after his assassination as the book A Nation of Immigrants, and argued for the elimination of the National Origins Quota System in place since 1921.\n\nTed Kennedy, along with Attorney General and Sen. Robert Kennedy (D-N.Y.), were both proponents of the bill, in part to honor their brother and also because it was consistent with their general interest in civil rights and international cold war politics, Chin adds.\n\n\u201cI think every sensible person in 1965 knew that the sources of immigration would change,\u201d Chin says. \u201cThe more fundamental change, and the more fundamental policy, was the articulation by many legislators that it simply did not matter from where an immigrant came; each person would be evaluated as an individual. That kind of argument was novel, but consistent with the anti-racism of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\u201d\n\nThe act, Edward Kennedy argued during the Senate floor debate, went to the \u201cvery central ideals of our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur streets may not be paved with gold, but they are paved with the promise that men and women who live here\u2014even strangers and new newcomers\u2014can rise as fast, as far as their skills will allow, no matter what their color is, no matter what the place of their birth,\u201d he said.\n\nChanges Introduced by the Immigration Act of 1965\n\nAmong the key changes brought by the Hart-Celler Act:"}, {"url": "https://time.com/6158027/kennedys-immigration-story-tells-us-about-america/", "page_content": "In 1958, in response to an alarming uptick in xenophobic chatter, the Anti-Defamation League asked then-Senator John F. Kennedy to write about America\u2019s melting-pot strengths and the need for immigration reform. The resulting essay, \u201cA Nation of Immigrants\u201d\u2014published as a book after JFK\u2019s death\u2014popularized the idealistic phrase that\u2019s been touted by politicians ever since.\n\nAmerica still likes to think of itself as a nation of immigrants, but even JFK admitted in print: the truth has always been more complicated. All four of his grandparents were American-born children of Irish immigrants who confronted \u201cthe hostility of an already established group of \u2018Americans\u2019,\u201d wrote Kennedy. \u201cIt is not unusual for people to fear and distrust that which they are not familiar with. Every new group coming to America found this fear and suspicion facing them.\u201d\n\nThe history of immigration in America is in fact the history of its nativist foes. (Not to mention the history of colonialism, the slaughter of Native Americans, and the enslavement of Africans.) We\u2019re reluctantly and uncomfortably an inclusive nation; we\u2019re a nation of immigrants despite a deep, dark history of efforts to keep newcomers out\u2014or at least down.\n\nTake the immigrant Kennedys. JFK\u2019s paternal great-grandparents, Bridget Murphy and Patrick Kennedy, were the first to leave their respective County Wexford families, sailing in a crowded \u201ccoffin ship\u201d seeking safer shores across the Atlantic. Landing in 1848 at the docks of East Boston, not far from Terminal A at today\u2019s Logan Airport (named for the son of an Irish immigrant brewer), they met, married and started a family, but quickly discovered they were unwanted refugees.\n\nThey\u2019d been oppressed in Ireland by their homeland\u2019s colonizer\u2014England had banned their religion and their native language; prevented them from voting and holding office; reacted slowly and indifferently when the Potato Famine of the 1840s led to mass starvation (a million dead) and mass migration (upwards of two million fled).\n\nBut in America? It turned out that the land George Washington had envisioned as \u201ca safe and agreeable asylum\u201d for \u201cthe oppressed and persecuted of all Nations and Religions\u201d didn\u2019t really want them, either.\n\nAs part of the first large wave of (mostly poor and rural) Irish newcomers to (mostly urban) America\u201425,000 arrived in Boston in 1848 alone, among the million who came to North America\u2014the Kennedys experienced many of the 19th-century low points in the nation\u2019s tolerance for the outsider: voter suppression, anti-immigrant legislation and voting efforts, riots at the polls, plus the mid-1850s rise of the nativist Know Nothing party, its hatred aimed mostly at Irish and Catholics.\n\nIn their immigrant-crowded East Boston neighborhood, Bridget and Patrick Kennedy and their children and neighbors witnessed violent protests outside their homes, their church, their businesses. They looked out the window at parades of young men marching with faux-patriotic groups like the Order of Free and Accepted Americans, the Order of the American Star, the American Protestant Society, and the Wide Awakes, threatening the Irish with their angry chants, \u201cWide awake! Wide awake!\u201d Backed by their right-wing newspapers and magazines\u2014the Republican, the Protestant, the Spirit of \u201976\u2014their mantra: \u201cAmericans must rule America.\u201d\n\nBoston had been a hub of anti-slavery activism, but otherwise it was hardly a model of integration or tolerance. Take Boston artist and inventor Samuel F. B. Morse, who helped create the telegraph and Morse code. Though he later said his invention aspired to make \u201cone neighborhood of the whole country,\u201d Morse\u2019s electromagnetic dots and dashes were originally designed as a secret code that could be used to defeat a rumored plot to make \u201cPopery\u201d (Catholicism) the law of the land.\n\nA well-known anti-immigrant, pro-slavery activist, Morse\u2019s 1835 book, Foreign Conspiracy Against the Liberties of the United States, called for limits on immigration from Catholic countries and for banning Catholics from holding public office. He unsuccessfully ran for mayor of New York as candidate for the Native American Party (later known as the American Party, and generally known through the mid-1800s as the Know Nothings\u2014its members claimed to \u201cknow nothing\u201d about it. John Wilkes Booth was an adherent, as was Ulysses Grant\u2019s vice president, Henry Wilson.)\n\nMorse and the Know Nothings were among many voices roaring against nineteenth-century immigrants, their words and actions eerily familiar to those of recent years. Xenophobia had become an \u201cAmerican tradition,\u201d as Erika Lee put it in her 2019 book, America for Americans.\n\nClearly, not much has changed over the centuries. We\u2019ve always tried to prevent immigrants (and minorities) from access to the ballot (and to citizenship, and to power).\n\nToday, the street corners of the Kennedys\u2019 East Boston neighborhood are anchored by bodegas and Latin markets. Those startup businesses, many run by immigrants from Brazil and Mexico, replaced the Italian delis that in turn had replaced the Irish grocery shops like the one JFK\u2019s great-grandmother Bridget ran for twenty years after the Civil War\u2014and the Irish saloons like those that helped launch the late-1800s political career of Bridget\u2019s son, P.J..\n\nJohn F.

Recent census data shows that while 2021 had the slowest population growth in U.S. history, growth attributed to immigration contributed to an uptick in the percentage of Americans born elsewhere. Immigrants now represent 14.1 percent of the U.S. population, inching closer to the all-time high of 14.8 percent, which was reached in 1890.\n\nThen as now, immigrants came despite the efforts of men like Henry Cabot Lodge, a longtime Massachusetts statesman who through the 1890s called on voters to \u201cguard our civilization against an infusion which seems to threaten deterioration.\u201d Lodge railed against \u201chyphenism,\u201d preferring \u201c100 percent Americanism\u201d to Irish-American or Italian-American designations.\n\nWhen Lodge ran for the U.S. Senate in 1892, his support for strict immigration limits and a proposed federal literacy test for newcomers helped him defeat Irish Congressman Patrick Collins, whom Lodge decried as \u201chard-drinking, idle, quarrelsome, and disorderly.\u201d Many of Lodge\u2019s nativist ideas, including the literacy test, were later incorporated into the Immigration Act of 1917.\n\nOn the Fourth of July, 1895, the American Protective Association, an anti-Catholic group, paraded through East Boston ranting about Irish \u201caliens\u201d and \u201cenemies of the state.\u201d Riots ensued and shots were fired and an immigrant longshoreman was killed, dying on the steps of P.J. Kennedy\u2019s saloon. P.J. invited his friend, the newly elected Congressman John F. Fitzgerald, to come to East Boston and calm things down. At a fundraiser for the murdered longshoreman, Fitzgerald addressed the \u201cintense hatred of everything Irish and Roman Catholic\u201d that persisted, and blamed radical, secretive men\u2019s groups for trying to \u201cmonopolize all the Americanism in this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are one people and owe the same duty to our country,\u201d Fitzgerald told the crowd. \u201cWhy, then, this desire to set one class of people against another?\u201d\n\nDecades later, the grandson of P.J. Kennedy and \u201cHoney Fitz\u201d Fitzgerald defeated the grandson of Henry Cabot Lodge, and midway through his Senate term JFK penned his hopeful views on the subject of Americanism: \u201cThere is no part of America that has not been touched by our immigrant background,\u201d he wrote. Kennedy also lobbied in A Nation of Immigrants against a quota system that favored the Northern and Western European countries of his ancestors, and discriminated against immigrants from Asia and Africa. (That national origins quota system was ended by the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965.)\n\nThe 35th president clearly had very different views than those of the 45th president, the son, grandson, and spouse of immigrants, who infamously declared his preference for more immigrants from \u201cplaces like Norway\u201d and fewer from \u201cshithole countries.\u201d (And whose influence led to the removal of the words \u201cnation of immigrants\u201d from the mission statement of the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services.)\n\nChampions of immigration have always faced the build-a-wall fervor of former President Trump\u2019s base. As Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz put it her 2021 book, Not A Nation of Immigrants, the ideology of JFK\u2019s \u201cnation of immigrants\u201d premise is flawed\u2014and under constant assault.\n\nThe fear-mongering of the Morses, Lodges, and Trumps of America will continue to try to shout down the hopeful words of its Kennedys and Obamas. \u201cIn no other country is my story even possible,\u201d the nation\u2019s first Black president once said, echoing the optimism of George Washington, who wrote: \u201cI had always hoped that this land might become a safe and agreeable asylum to the virtuous and persecuted part of mankind, to whatever nation they might belong.\u201d Then again, America\u2019s first president was a slaveholder whose ideals on asylum clearly didn\u2019t apply to enslaved Africans.

Kennedy\u2019s New Frontier embraced the latest economic theories, promoted an empowered presidency, and reaffirmed the federal government\u2019s responsibility for ensuring the nation\u2019s economic prosperity. The 1962 Public Works Acceleration Act (PWAA) served as one of the administration\u2019s most important new economic tools in its attempt to redefine American liberalism. Although the importance of this program has been often overlooked, its passage offers enduring insights into the institutional and political barriers faced by a liberal administration that sought to bring about a neo-Keynesian revolution.Footnote 1 The year-and-a-half-long debate over the structure and timing of the PWAA demonstrate that the president was committed to countercyclical deficit spending from the beginning of his presidency. Using documents housed in the Kennedy Presidential Library archives, we trace how Kennedy challenged the Congress\u2014including his fellow Democrats\u2014to pass a proactive $2.5 billion spending package to counter cyclical growth in unemployment. As designed, every dollar would be overseen by economists inside the White House, not the Congress. Using the methods of modern economic theory\u2014the calculability of full-employment potential, the measure of consumer purchasing power, and the science of countercyclical deficit spending\u2014Kennedy and his economic advisers constructed the PWAA as a major effort to meet simultaneously the government\u2019s growing expectations to curb inflation, promote full employment, and expand the economy\u2019s overall capacity.\n\nWe argue that the PWAA should be seen as an integral part of the Kennedy administration\u2019s comprehensive plan to address economic instability and lower unemployment rates in the early 1960s. Kennedy signed the Public Works Acceleration Act into law on September 14, 1962, ending what was up to that point one of the hardest fought political battles of his administration. The eventual $900 million authorization for public works projects was an antirecessionary measure that predated the administration\u2019s more well-known use of broad-based tax cuts to restructure the economy.Footnote 2 Because of the act, federal monies continued to flow to states and localities throughout the 1960s, adding hundreds of millions of manpower hours into the economy.Footnote 3\n\nThe fight over the PWAA clearly indicates that Kennedy relied upon and advanced post\u2013World War II, neo-Keynesian fiscal policy through temporary, but massive, government spending. Kennedy and his economists combined these fiscal theories with a newly restored faith in presidential governance, one that claimed that only through the presidency could the federal government respond promptly and effectively to rebalance fluctuations in aggregate demand. This study of the PWAA therefore sheds light on a growing literature that recognizes Kennedy\u2019s embrace of cutting taxes, but complicates this narrative by suggesting that it is was an embrace that followed from his neo-Keynesian faith in countercyclical deficit-spending.Footnote 4 Similarly, while Kennedy might have vacillated on his Keynesian commitments during the 1960 campaign, internal White House documents show that the \u201cconversion\u201d of Kennedy appears to be one within the Keynesian framework. Once elected, Kennedy did not need to learn to embrace budget deficits, but rather appreciate the type of deficit spending the New Economists wanted and what type of deficits the administration could politically muster.Footnote 5 Although the most controversial and potentially revolutionary element of the PWAA never became law\u2014a \u201cstandby\u201d provision giving the president authority to stop and start spending\u2014Kennedy remained dedicated to the challenge of learning the politics of neo-Keynesian economics.\n\nKennedy\u2019s \u201cBig Five\u201d and the Depressed Areas Bill The optimism accompanying Kennedy\u2019s 1960 electoral victory belied the deep economic anxieties that had been building throughout the previous decade, as well as the growing tension in liberal economic thought over government spending.Footnote 6 Many economists credited wartime spending with the economic recovery that occurred during the 1940s, not spending for New Deal jobs programs. After an extended period of Depression and war-induced deficit spending left the United States with unprecedented levels of debt, politicians in both parties fell back on the standard call for balanced budgets, fearful even of countercyclical deficits.Footnote 7 Before his inauguration and during the campaign, Kennedy also appeared hesitant to use deficit spending proactively to counter economic recession. Early on, he indicated that despite rising unemployment, he would pursue his predecessor\u2019s course of maintaining a balanced budget, and the nomination of Douglas Dillon as Treasury Secretary seemed to portend further the administration\u2019s more centrist policy outlook.Footnote 8 As Walter Lippmann observed, all Kennedy had managed to accomplish was \u201cto carry on in all its essentials the Eisenhower economic philosophy. . . . It\u2019s like the Eisenhower Administration 30 years younger.\u201dFootnote 9 The well-known economics columnist Bernard Nossiter offered a similar assessment, writing that \u201cto be sure, the language has changed. Mr. Eisenhower employed a conservative rhetoric to clothe liberal actions; Mr. Kennedy uses a liberal rhetoric for similar programs.\u201dFootnote 10 These contemporaneous accounts of Kennedy\u2019s economic moderation comport with modern historical arguments that Kennedy\u2019s position on deficit spending and countercyclical fiscal policy evolved after a cautious first year in office.Footnote 11 However, Kennedy\u2019s cautious approach upon entering office was principally the result of his adviser\u2019s optimistic economic forecasts\u2014forecasts that would turn out to be wrong as unemployment rose throughout the new president\u2019s first few months in office. As Herbert Stein describes, at the start of Kennedy\u2019s term \u201cthe whole edifice of New Frontier fiscal policy seemed to have melted in the rising sun of economic recovery.\u201dFootnote 12 Consequently, the president did not call for immediate spending increases, but he did organize an administration staffed with experts who would spearhead the project of fundamentally reforming America\u2019s political economy. Significantly, Kennedy chose one of the nation\u2019s foremost Keynesians to be chair of his Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), Walter Heller. Heller was instrumental in implementing components of the 1947 Marshall Plan to rebuild war-torn Germany\u2014and he was a foremost scholar on the relationship between fiscal stimulus and long-term multiplier effects. Heller advised Kennedy several times during the 1960 campaign, at a time when the Massachusetts senator refused to bind himself to a more revolutionary, proactive fiscal policy. Yet, it was during the campaign when Heller first broached the subject of \u201cbypassing the Congressional process\u201d to enact \u201cproperly timed tax cuts and deficits.\u201d Kennedy, while intrigued, deliberately chose not to campaign on such an unfamiliar, potentially radical set of instruments, but promised to \u201cmake extensive use of the economic advice\u201d once elected.Footnote 13 As Heller later explained, \u201cThe power of Keynesian ideas could not be harnessed to the nation\u2019s lagging economy without putting them in forms and terms that could be understood. . . . Men\u2019s minds had to be conditioned to accept new thinking, new symbols, and new and broader concepts of the public interest.\u201dFootnote 14 During the election, that task seemed impossible, but the election of Kennedy brought this commitment to the White House from the start.Footnote 15 Soon after the selection of Heller and the rest of Kennedy\u2019s New Economists in the winter of 1961, the president-elect announced a set of sweeping proposals to revive the American economy. A mix of old Democratic spending priorities and new Kennedy fiscal instruments, \u201cThe Big Five\u201d would redefine the federal government\u2019s role in managing the economy and would be, in the president\u2019s words, the \u201cmost important domestic priority\u201d of the new administration.Footnote 16 Four of the Big Five\u2019s provisions were legislative leftovers from the previous decade, including proposals Eisenhower vetoed: a minimum-wage bill, an expanded affordable housing bill, Kennedy\u2019s own previous bill to standardize unemployment benefits across state lines, and the Democrats\u2019 1958 public works plan\u2014soon to become the administration\u2019s first major legislative success as the 1961 Area Redevelopment Act.Footnote 17 The fifth component of the Big Five was something unique to Kennedy\u2019s presidency, a $2.5 billion public works plan that amounted to approximately 3 percent of all proposed federal expenditures in FY1961. Although much of Kennedy\u2019s early budgetary proposals for new government programs contained fiscal offsets that would have maintained a balanced budget, this proposal deliberately unbalanced the budget. Under the proposal, the president would have sole responsibility for creating this purposeful deficit through standby authority to allocate money for \u201coff the shelf\u201d public works projects either already underway, in the late stages of planning, or in progress. As soon as White House economists identified a sustained economic contraction, they would have the authority to spend up to the estimated loss in full-employment output. Kennedy\u2019s proposal requested power to bypass the Congress when certain measures indicated an economic downturn. The goal was to turn the government\u2019s management of the economy into an administrative and technical decision, not a political one.Footnote 18 Giving the presidency the capacity to make up for a 0.46-percent loss in GDP at an instant\u2019s notice was a pure interpretation of Keynesian economic policy with an altered understanding of American separation of powers. Many Democrats, however, ridiculed the proposal as too experimental, declaring that such \u201cstrong medicine\u201d was unnecessary, and Kennedy hesitated to push it further that year.Footnote 19 Heller later remarked that \u201cthere was a lot of discussion with the president at that time . . . as to what was the better political strategy: to go all out for something that would have created full employment and get slapped down by Congress . . . or to get a program that would in and of itself be thought to be fiscally prudent and within bounds that the public would accept.\u201dFootnote 20 Behind the scenes, and within two weeks of taking office, Kennedy ordered Heller\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers and the Bureau of the Budget (BoB) to begin collecting a list from every government agency to determine \u201cwhich projects may be suitable for early initiation or acceleration as part of the recovery program.\u201d The prepared inventory amounted to over $4.5 billion in applicable defense and civilian infrastructure improvements. While the Department of Defense opposed the idea of seeking additional appropriations to accelerate these programs, the BoB prepared to submit requests for the remaining $2.7 billion to complement its ongoing acceleration of highway improvements ($724 million in FY1961) and accelerated government procurements ($247 million).Footnote 21 The planning for an additional massive public works proposal was also to take on a decidedly public dimension. That January, at a meeting with Heller, Paul Samuelson, James Tobin, and Theodore Sorensen, Kennedy \u201cstressed the need for educating the American people in order to set our record straight and in order to promote better understanding of the fiscal and monetary policy on the economy.\u201d Moreover, according to Heller, the president further suggested \u201cthat the Council [of Economic Advisers] do some serious thinking about how to use the White House as a pulpit for public education.\u201dFootnote 22 While the Cabinet and Executive Office of the Presidency (EOP) prepared a formalized plan, they demurred releasing it publicly, pending further consideration on how best to sell it to the American people. Kennedy\u2019s understanding about the limits of public opinion for deficit spending were soon confirmed as the nascent public works plan suffered its first defeat. When Congress passed the $394 million Area Redevelopment Act that April, Democrats who had initially supported Kennedy\u2019s public works plans feared an electoral backlash over the size of the budget.Footnote 23 Yet, the administration believed it could overcome these fears by emphasizing that proposed public works spending would only be triggered by an increase in unemployment. They could therefore craft and propose parts of the administration\u2019s \u201cSecond Stage Economic Recovery Plan\u201d without abetting the public\u2019s concern about deficits and increased inflation. As the draft report, written by Kermit Gordon (CEA), Robert Turner (BoB), and Lee White (EOP), hoped, \u201cThe request for authority on a standby rather than an immediate basis would be seen as a prudent and responsible strategy in view of the prevailing divergence of expectations concerning the rate of recovery and its effect on unemployment.\u201dFootnote 24 Given a predictable level of uncertainty on how the economy would react to expenditure increases elsewhere in the government\u2014mainly in defense and space programs\u2014the CEA outlined several possibilities, tailored to different recovery scenarios. Complicating matters further was the fact that public works spending would not only have an immediate effect on slack in the economy, but it would multiply and expand the economy\u2019s productive output; for example, the CEA estimated that a $2 billion publics work program would, over a twelve-month period, increase GNP by 6.4 percent, while a $5 billion program would increase GNP by 16.0 percent.Footnote 25 Disbursement of funds, therefore, needed to match precisely what economists determined was necessary, given preexisting stimulus, induced state and local expenditures, and incentivized private investment. To accomplish this delicate task, the White House attempted to modify public works legislation then pending before the Senate. Earlier that year, Senator Joseph Clark (D-Pa.) introduced a $1-billion public works package for immediate unemployment relief. However, Clark\u2019s bill differed significantly from Kennedy\u2019s proposed public works plan: it was substantially smaller, it relied on unemployment rates for disbursing funds rather than the rate of changing unemployment, and it failed to give the president complete discretion in disbursing funds. Clark viewed this spending as necessary given the state of the economy, while Kennedy\u2019s economists viewed it as little more than a subtle alteration of Congress\u2019s traditional pork-barrel politics. Moreover, economists in the Treasury, Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon, and members of the Bureau of the Budget\u2014including one of the drafters, Robert Turner\u2014all opposed the proposal of a standby provision on grounds that such an unfamiliar instrument would not have the desired economic or political effect of galvanizing consumer sentiment.Footnote 26 Clark\u2019s plan did emphasize the \u201coff the shelf\u201d nature of applicable projects so that spending could begin as soon as possible, and as such the administration recognized that altering Clark\u2019s legislation represented their best strategy for producing a neo-Keynesian public works bill.Footnote 27 Nevertheless, the decision to modify the Clark proposal happened just as White House economists were forecasting an economic upturn, and although the CEA acknowledged that further stimulus was needed, the persistence of any economic slack would torpedo the administration\u2019s attempts to make a standby \u201ctriggering mechanism\u201d an enduring feature of federal public works spending. As Heller and the CEA described it in a confidential report to the president, \u201cIf we were starting at the beginning to write a stand-by program for the next recession, we would probably want the trigger to fire at an unemployment rate of about 5 percent, seasonally adjusted . . . [but] we are not starting at the beginning. This recession began with 5 percent unemployment.\u201d It would be futile to push for and enact a standby provision that would kick in as soon as the president signed the authorizing legislation. Kennedy\u2019s economic and political advisers recognized that it would counteract the administration\u2019s optimistic forecasts of economic recovery, give the appearance of unnecessary economic experimentation, and jeopardize the primary goal of making a proactive triggering mechanism the \u201cbasis of a permanent formula\u201d of public works spending.Footnote 28 Additionally, Labor Secretary Goldberg previously testified against the idea of increasing federal expenditures and Kennedy publically announced his own reticence to increase federal spending in a May 25 speech, despite the months-long intra\u2013White House deliberations over the standby program. Summarizing a lengthy meeting of the CEA to discuss how to legislatively pursue the standby proposal, Heller disclosed in a memo to Kennedy that while it was \u201cgenerally felt that it [the Clark plan with revisions] would be sound economic policy to enact legislation along these lines . . . most of the participants had serious doubts about the political wisdom of asking Congress to enact Clark-type legislation now.\u201dFootnote 29 Working with Clark through the summer, Kennedy personally requested that he wait and press for standby authority in the next session.Footnote 30 \u201cI intend to embody the principle of standby authority for capital improvements projects in my legislative program,\u201d Kennedy wrote Clark, in a letter that was heavily and widely circulated within the White House.Footnote 31 While the president demurred on the need for additional stimulus given the current economic forecast, he agreed with Clark that unemployment \u201cmay exceed earlier expectations,\u201d but that, in such an event, the president\u2019s standby would ensure that Americans would not have to \u201clearn to live with prolonged and severe unemployment.\u201dFootnote 32 Yet, while praising the Clark bill, the president stated delicately what his advisers had more bluntly relayed to him weeks before: \u201cIn the face of brisk recovery, political vulnerability of a \u2018public works\u2019 type of program and recent Administration opposition to such a program, no attempt should be made to get such legislation now.\u201dFootnote 33\n\n\u201cThe Time to Repair the Roof Is When the Sun Is Shining\u201d: Kennedy\u2019s Standby Authority December 1961\u2019s sales receipts and unemployment estimates reignited fears of an economic slowdown, as the unemployment rate climbed from 5.5 percent in 1960 to 6.7 percent in 1961. While economic forecasting improved during the early 1960s, the economic-political agenda was still prepared with what Heller described as \u201cguarded optimism.\u201dFootnote 34 Following the decision to delay Clark\u2019s bill until the following winter, Heller confided to Robert Turner in the BoB that the timeline for reconsidering the public works plan was still in flux because, \u201cAt the moment, all we can do is wait and see.\u201d The changing forecast and perceived slowdown, though, confirmed what had been the administration\u2019s plans all along\u2014to return to the \u201cbig five\u201d proposals (only one of which had passed Congress) during the 1962 legislative session and continue to emphasize the need for a standby public works bill.Footnote 35 However, the push now was even riskier than when Kennedy first came to office. Republicans were well poised to reduce the Democrat\u2019s congressional majority in November\u2019s midterm elections, and conservative Democrats grew increasingly hostile to the administration\u2019s other New Frontier priorities. As one Democratic senator anonymously confessed to the Wall Street Journal, \u201cWe were looking forward to a honeymoon then at the beginning of the new Administration; now the honeymoon is over, and it wasn\u2019t much of a honeymoon at that.\u201dFootnote 36 Yet, in his 1962 State of the Union speech, Kennedy stood before the Congress asking the members to recommit themselves to the New Frontier. \u201cPleasant as it may be to bask in the warmth of recovery,\u201d Kennedy reminded them, \u201clet us not forget that we have suffered three recessions in the last seven years. The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining\u2014by filling three basic gaps in our anti-recession protection.\u201dFootnote 37 Kennedy joined two additional \u201ceconomic stabilizers\u201d to the standby public works plan. One was Kennedy\u2019s old-Senate plan to standardize unemployment insurance across state lines. The other stabilizer was a proposal to grant the president the authority to increase and decrease tax rates automatically. For the remainder of the year the pursuit of proactive, discretionary expenditures often was coupled with the automatic tax-rate adjustment plan, as both sought to give the president authority to bypass the normal appropriations process. Using modern economics to make good on an old proverb, Kennedy attempted to convince a Congress jealous of its traditional prerogatives that policymakers had finally developed the tools for measuring gross demand and consumer purchasing power; he remained adamant\u2014legislative deliberation was the problem, executive authority was the solution. The political backlash was fierce. The following day, Republican Senate leader Everett Dirksen (R-Ill.) lambasted the administration\u2019s litany of proposals as \u201ca Sears Roebuck catalog with the old prices marked up.\u201dFootnote 38 Days later, when Kennedy submitted his first complete budget for FY 1963, deficit hawks felt vindicated by what they saw. Although it called for a $1.8 billion surplus, the budget proposed an all-time peacetime high for government spending of $92.5 billion. This amount exceeded Eisenhower\u2019s final FY1960 proposal by $15.2 billion, a 19.7 percent increase in government outlays. Kennedy\u2019s proposal contained economic assumptions that enabled the budget to meet its targets. The budget\u2019s surplus depended on growth rates of two percent per quarter, over the previous quarter\u2014a figure that seemed highly optimistic in a country still reeling from two economic contractions in the previous five years. Yet, for Kennedy\u2019s economists, optimism was not the right word\u2014it was not optimistic if such gains in output were predictable, nor was it optimistic if the levers of government remained free and ready to respond to any negative signs in the economy. As Heller would soon testify before Congress\u2019s Joint Economic Committee, \u201cSuch budgetary flexibility is part and parcel of the stabilization policy of this administration. . . . Economic policy has to be flexible and to be prepared for the unexpected. . . . If he [the President] had standby authority for well-timed and well-paced public capital improvements, which could be invoked upon the development of a recession\u2014in that event we would certainly be much better buttressed against adverse economic developments.\u201dFootnote 39 The standby authority and spending authorization bills, although ultimately considered outside the normal budgetary process, drew upon the government\u2019s larger budgetary obligations. The administration proposed to transfer funds already appropriated in the budget for five agencies, but as of yet unobligated or unused, as a type of \u201cinterim financing\u201d to accelerate approved public works plans.Footnote 40 David Bell, director of the Bureau of the Budget, quickly pointed out that this was not a simple mechanism of transfer authority but was deliberately designed to \u201cunbalance\u201d the budget and incur a fiscal deficit: \u201cYou see,\u201d Bell explained, \u201cany given time there are some tens of billions of dollars of unobligated authority . . . which may never be spent.\u201d Although adding to the government\u2019s budget deficit, spending these standby funds would stimulate the economy by accelerating public works.Footnote 41 So, though a small percentage of all government spending, the $2 billion standby authority Kennedy referred to in his State of the Union Address to initiate and accelerate spending on capital improvements played a critical role in Kennedy\u2019s plans for the economy. \u201cAs the President has emphasized many times,\u201d Arthur Goldberg testified, \u201cwhen unemployment rises and other economic developments indicate a weakness in our economy, the Government must have the authority and funds to assure that sufficient jobs are created rapidly enough to put the unemployed back to work, thus creating necessary consumer purchasing power to reverse the trend.\u201dFootnote 42 Both Democrats and Republicans, big business and organized labor,Footnote 43 criticized Kennedy\u2019s insistence on standby authority. The disagreement ranged from issues over constitutional permissibility and the government\u2019s ability to identify economic trends to a fundamental disagreement over the structure of the postwar economy. \u201cThe reason for the underutilization of resources and the suppression of growth,\u201d George Hagedorn, director of Research of the National Association of Manufacturers argued, \u201cis not a temporary cyclical one. It is a cumulative result of wage increases in excess of productivity eating into profits and reducing the incentives for growth, and for utilizing resources freely.\u201dFootnote 44 Emerson P. Schmidt, Economic Consultant for the Chamber of Commerce, agreed, adding that \u201cnearly every student who has closely examined the use of public works, as a contracyclical [sic] weapon has found it an awkward and largely unsuited weapon for this purpose. . . . Public works [are] not easily turned on and off to fit neatly in some valley of recession.\u201dFootnote 45 While Congress debated the legislative proposals, Kennedy actively responded to congressional criticism\u2014especially Everett Dirksen\u2019s complaints\u2014by trying to convince members that the issue was not one of politics or constitutionalism, but economic expertise.Footnote 46 In an open letter to Congress, the president wrote, \u201cExperience has shown that the timing of these Federal actions, both Executive and Congressional, can make a substantial difference in severity and duration of any particular recession.\u201d However, the president added, spending \u201cimplemented only after the normal legislative processes, may be too late to achieve an ameliorating effect on the recession sufficient to justify the increase in budget expenditures.\u201dFootnote 47 In the face of intense opposition, the administration worked with Clark to modify the senator\u2019s proposal, increasing Clark\u2019s plan by $300 million, and dividing the now $1.2 billion bill into two parts. The first would authorize $600 million in immediate spending authority for area redevelopment in line with the spending requirements of the newly established Area Redevelopment Administration.Footnote 48 The remaining funds would be spent in accordance to growth targets set by White House economists under a standby authorization plan.Footnote 49 On March 26, the House Committee on Public Works followed Clark\u2019s lead and began its open-door work on merging the president\u2019s proposal with a public works plan targeting depressed areas. H.R. 10113 increased funding for public works and added a new administrative agency to oversee spending to become the \u201cPublic Works Coordination and Acceleration Act.\u201d Congress treated the standby authority separately in H.R. 10318, the \u201cStandby Capital Improvements Act of 1961.\u201d Together, they colloquially formed the PWAA.Footnote 50 The revised bill served the president\u2019s intent\u2014it \u201cenabled the President to take quick and effective action to stimulate the economy by inaugurating a program of needed capital improvements.\u201dFootnote 51 The bill\u2019s sponsor John Blatnik (D-Minn.) argued when introducing the bill that \u201cthe only item of budgetary expenditure that can be varied countercyclically, and that by its very nature calls for such variation, is a public works program.\u201dFootnote 52 While the amount of money available for the president\u2019s discretion was nearly cut in half, funds remained restricted for off-the-shelf projects, which would serve the intended countercyclical effect by pumping millions of dollars into the economy as fast as possible (see Table 1). The justification for bypassing the normal appropriations process and giving the president this authority made sense in the language of neo-Keynesian stimulus\u2014timing was everything. \u201cThe reason for [standby authority] is because of the difficulty of anticipating,\u201d David Bell argued. \u201cAt the time the President wanted to use these funds it would be important to move quickly under the assumed conditions of the beginning of a recession.\u201dFootnote 53 Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg similarly argued that \u201cthe proposal for authority to begin such programs now at the present level of unemployment is a recognition that, since we did not have standby authority when needed, we must take prompt and effective action now.\u201dFootnote 54 Members grew noticeably agitated as the administration\u2019s witnesses testified about the need to bypass Congress and the regular appropriations process. Representative Edwin Dooley (R-N.Y.) inquired whether the president \u201cfound the Congress to be derelict or slow in functioning.\u201d Representative William Cramer (R-Fla.) condemned the plan as \u201cone of the most brazen Presidential power grab proposals ever presented to the Congress.\u201dFootnote 55 Likewise, after being told by Michigan governor John Swainson that in \u201cperiods of severe economic hardship, we cannot wait for the laborious congressional and legislative machinery to grind out a solution to the problem,\u201d Representative James Harvey (R-Mich.) demanded to know when Congress had ever been so ineffective in responding to the needs of their shared constituents.Footnote 56 Republicans also worried that, even if staffed by experts, there existed the very real possibility that monies could flow to areas that were electorally vulnerable, tipping the scales toward the president\u2019s party. Somewhat similarly, fellow Democrats began to realize that without exercising the power to appropriate funds following the authorization, there would be no guarantee that federal largesse flowed into their own districts. While the $600 million in immediate authority would go to those areas designated under the congressionally approved Area Redevelopment Act, none of standby authorization was predetermined; it was, after all, to remain deliberately underdetermined.\n\n\u201cSwift, Flexible, and Forceful Action\u201d: Educating the Public About Keynesian Stimulus The PWAA had up to this point been a tough battle the administration was willing to fight. Opposition from Republicans as well as fellow Democrats soured public opinion on the president\u2019s \u201cexperiment.\u201d As William Batt, the newly appointed head of the Area Redevelopment Administration, later recalled, \u201cFrom the very beginning the committee members and the committee staff [of the Public Works Committee] told me that that standby proposal was sunk. We argued for it manfully.\u201dFootnote 57 On April 17, after two days of closed hearings and five days of expert testimony, the Senate Public Works Committee approved the combined package on a party-line vote. Several weeks later, however, on May 1, the PWAA suffered its most severe setback when somebody leaked that the House Democratic leadership was scrapping the standby authority due to the objections from liberal Democrats. As a compromise, they proposed a $900 million one-time special appropriation, which would not draw on unobligated budgeted funds from federal agencies that Congress would fully oversee.Footnote 58 Keenly aware of the public relations battle he would have to win, Kennedy did not sit on the sidelines and leave the fight to the economics professors.Footnote 59 \u201cWe had to sell modern fiscal policy to an unbelieving and highly suspicious public,\u201d Heller recalled shortly after stepping down as chairman of the CEA \u201cHere we sold them deficit financing.\u201dFootnote 60 Kennedy, who had already vigorously courted organized labor to back the plan, traveled to the AFL-CIO annual convention in Atlantic City to press the necessity of standby authority using as many different angles as possible\u2014new economics, national security, anticorporatism. \u201cEvery year brings new problems that are unsolved,\u201d the president proclaimed, but \u201cour basic task here at home is to attempt to develop an economy which is not subject to the violent fluctuations where we saw the recession of 1958 and the recession of 60 and even today have too many people unemployed. We have suggested three programs to give us standby power . . . so that if we see the economy turning down we can move quickly without having to wait until it runs its course over a period of months.\u201dFootnote 61 Even with the president\u2019s added support, the Democratic leadership in the Senate feared that Republicans and southern Democrats would overcome the unenthusiastic coalition supporting the bill. By May, the administration grew increasingly concerned that time was running out as congressional midterms approached. Republicans labeled the plan as the Democrats\u2019 \u201cski lifts, swimming pools, and golf courses\u201d bill, and renewed their concern that any type of deficit spending was going to drive up inflation. The House Republican Policy Committee, chaired by John Byrnes (R-Wis.) solidified the party\u2019s opposition to the bill, arguing that even without standby authority \u201cbillions of dollars already authorized for such use [were] going unspent.\u201d Kennedy claimed that the new economics could precisely measure fiscal stimulus; conservatives responded that the technocrats could hardly count.Footnote 62 Ultimately, the administration\u2019s efforts paid off in the Senate, but not without the help of a little intraparty wrangling. The Senate passed its $1.5 billion public works program by a vote of 44 to 32.Footnote 63 The standby provision given to Kennedy barely made it into the final bill. Clearly it was the most controversial element, and an amendment to scrap the standby authority would have passed if the Democratic leadership had not convinced two senators to vote \u201cpairs,\u201d or essentially abstain, at the last minute on the Senate floor. The amendment to remove presidential standby authority just narrowly failed, 36\u201337.Footnote 64 With the Senate bill passed, fiscal conservatives turned their attention to the House vote. If there were to be a public works program, they conceded, they would make their fight over Kennedy\u2019s standby authority. Having lost the Senate vote, Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) penned several high-profile, reprinted letters in the national dailies lamenting how \u201can enormous extension of executive power for the President is wrapped up in the administration\u2019s public works program.\u201d \u201cIf adopted,\u201d he warned, \u201cit would hand the President more spending power than Congress has ever before delegated to a Chief Executive for such purposes.\u201dFootnote 65 Former President Eisenhower, now working to help the Republicans in the upcoming midterms, made the public works bill\u2014and the \u201cpseudo-science\u201d undergirding it\u2014a central feature in his stump speeches. \u201cCheers, whistles, and hurrahs,\u201d greeted Ike as he lambasted Kennedy\u2019s plans, suggesting that the president was \u201cfloundering aimlessly and desperately\u201d behind a front of \u201csophistication.\u201d \u201cIt is always necessary to examine critically those appropriating,\u201d Eisenhower said, \u201cand to stop assuming that mere spending means increased strength. . . . [Sophistication is] a planned economy.\u201dFootnote 66 Indeed, the attack on professional economics was central to the Republican message. In another letter, Goldwater joined Eisenhower\u2019s critique of the New Economics, calling on voters to send a message to Kennedy to replace his \u201cbrain trusters\u201d with \u201chard-headed business men\u201d who actually understood the economy.Footnote 67 Dirksen and Halleck in their weekly press conference said that only a Republican Congress could successfully declare a moratorium on Kennedy\u2019s \u201ceconomic novelties,\u201d return the country to \u201cfiscal sanity,\u201d and abandon this \u201cold scheme to cover up extravagant government spending.\u201dFootnote 68 Undeterred, the White House continued to press for public works spending and presidential authority to manage those funds, and, in a significant act of presidential leadership, Kennedy attempted to educate the public in the workings of the \u201cnew economics.\u201d Again, the appeal for a discretionary public works bill was often coupled to a similar \u201ctriggered\u201d countercyclical tax-rate proposal, which was less developed legislatively. Moreover, by that summer, Heller, the CEA, and Kennedy decided to push through a massive, permanent tax cut. As a result, the standby public works bill was often deprioritized\u2014deliberately so\u2014in favor of tax cuts, and the even more controversial discretionary tax-cut authority.Footnote 69 At a June White House press conference, Kennedy prodded Congress to give him standby authority, telling reporters that, specifically with regard to tax cuts, \u201cthere is surely more cause now than ever before for making such authority available.\u201d Footnote 70 The president continued to seek the public works expenditures, and four days after the House Rules Committee barely released the public works bill for a full vote,Footnote 71 he once again took to the presidential \u201cbully pulpit.\u201d In one of the most iconic moments of the Kennedy administration, the president stood in front of a lectern during prime time, and, pointing to various graphs and charts, he described to the American people the status of the economy. Having already faced a tremendous challenge in convincing the public that sustained deficits could lower unemployment and increase the economy\u2019s potential, the president nevertheless remained committed to explaining why his quest for additional federal funds was needed. He first explained why he would delay a tax cut until at least the upcoming year, but then the president argued that even if the economy was healthy, there was no need for the federal government to rest on its laurels. \u201cEmployment, income, profits, construction, and investment,\u201d the president declared, \u201cmust all move up more quickly than they have been doing this summer; and the greater wages and profits which full capacity could bring to all our American citizens must soon replace the most extravagant waste\u2014which is to have men searching for jobs which they cannot find and factories which have a percentage of their machines unused.\u201d Educating the public in the logic of full-employment budgeting, Kennedy then called on the Congress to pass the legislation before it. After calling for an investment tax credit, the president turned full attention to the pending public works plan. \u201cWe need enactment of the bill to step up help to local and federal works,\u201d he declared, \u201cincreasing the yearly building of those products in parts of our country which most urgently need them where many of our fellow countrymen are out of work and there is still a good deal to be done.\u201d On the president\u2019s reading copy, the words \u201cthis year\u201d were underlined. Kennedy praised the Senate version, hoping that the same bill\u2014the bill with standby authority\u2014would soon pass the House. To be sure, the president did not draw any sustained attention to the standby provision of the bill in this speech, and the public works proposal was one of many in a long list of interventions sought by the president. Significantly for the legacy of the PWAA, Kennedy already shifted the bulk of the rhetorical attention to the \u201cmost important fiscal weapon available to strength the national economic . . . Federal tax policy.\u201d Indeed, the president did not read an entire paragraph typed out in his reading copy regarding the need for standby authority. Such authority, the president planned to say, would allow his administration \u201cto be ready with swift, flexible and forceful action to cope with any future recession.\u201dFootnote 72 At the last minute, he decided not to include the message in his address. Yet, although the president did not bring the full force of his rhetorical powers to bear on the proposal, the administration, and especially Heller, continued to seek standby authority and to structure any authorized federal obligations in a way to ensure that they had a countercyclical effect. Leaving a breakfast meeting at the White House the morning following Kennedy\u2019s televised speech, Senate Democratic leader Mike Mansfield (D-Minn.) told reporters that prospects for the public works bill looked brighter.Footnote 73 Despite this confidence, opposition stemming from the southern and western wings of the party forced House leadership to revise the bill further, scrapping plans for a coordinating central agency.Footnote 74 Even with these changes, Speaker McCormack was still forced to delay the full chamber\u2019s consideration; ultimately, the final vote, 221\u2013192, secured passage of the House plan.Footnote 75 As time ran out, the Democratic leadership agreed that it was best to pursue passage of the House bill, rather than seek standby authority in conference committee.Footnote 76 Coming so close to Election Day and devolving into partisan rancor, the new spending authorization seemed less like the New Economics promised and more like the old economics that predated even the New Deal. As the New York Times editorialized, \u201cThe Administration had sought a new flexible approach to public works . . . [but] Congress is against any change in the pork barrel system, which is aimed at producing votes rather than jobs.\u201dFootnote 77 As such, while the PWAA would add a marginal amount of demand to the economy, the absence of a standby provision means that, at best, the bill was a partial success in Kennedy\u2019s attempt to blend the competing elements of old and new liberal economic thought. Inside the White House, officials lamented changes to the standby provision and the proposed timeline for appropriations. Heller frequently grew dismayed by the markup of the PWAA in the Conference Committee, because increases in the authorization amount often were tied to increases or under specification of the authorization period. The original plan stipulated an acceleration period of twelve months, and required that all projects be complete within eighteen months after initiating the standby plan. The final bill\u2014Public Law 87\u2013658\u2014gave the president an indefinite period to determine eligible projects and disburse the authorized amount; moreover, only a \u201csubstantial portion\u201d of the accelerated project need be completed within a year after receiving federal monies.Footnote 78\n\nAdministering the PWAA Even though the final law failed to include the standby provision, the White House still viewed the rapid disbursement of funds as an essential feature of its plan to solidify\u2014both programmatically and in the public image\u2014the veracity of the New Economics. Within months after the bill\u2019s signing, internal memorandum in the CEA circulated on the need to \u201creiterate\u201d the \u201cdesirability\u201d of the standby proposal. Crafting several avenues in which to continue the uphill political struggle to convince Congress, the council recognized that any future attempt at getting standby authority would be dependent on the structure of the \u201ctax reduction reform\u201d and how well the council could study and document the success of the 1962 bill.Footnote 79 The 1962 Public Works Acceleration Act was a $900 million authorization bill. As such, Congress still needed to appropriate each of the president\u2019s spending requests, giving the House and Senate Appropriations Committees one last say in directing the funds. Commerce Secretary Luther Hodges, who Kennedy placed in charge of coordinating the administration\u2019s requests, estimated that twenty-six federal agencies produced a list of some $1.3 billion worth of projects ready for completion in 1963. William Batt, who as head of the Area Redevelopment Administration (ARA) would oversee the distribution of funds, later recalled that \u201con the public works side of the game our problem [was that] we always had more applications than we could possibly fund.\u201dFootnote 80 Although the final bill restricted disbursement to areas with unemployment rates that qualified them under the 1961 Area Redevelopment Act guidelines, the administration still pushed for, and publicly called for, the authority to distribute the money as widely as possible.Footnote 81 Nevertheless, more than a month passed after the act became law before the appropriations committees began consideration of the White House\u2019s spending requests. By that time, Congress had a much greater sense of the FY1963 economic imprint, and with $5.2 billion left to appropriate the release of PWAA funds was further delayed. As the new congressional session began that January, administration officials were quickly revising their economic forecasts. The Bureau of the Budget earlier projected that there would be a $500 million surplus, driven in large part by a dramatic increase in GDP and government tax receipts. The new projections revealed the deficit would grow to $7.8 billion, driven by rising unemployment, a 6.4 percent increase in government expenditures, and only a 5.2 percent increase in revenues. Such a deficit would be the third largest since the end of World War II, surpassed only by the 1959 budget and government spending at the end of the Korean War. Yet, the bureau confidently stood by its previous assessments, stating that \u201cif the economy in recent years had been operating closer to its potential, with an unemployment rate of about 4 percent, existing tax laws would produce an administrative budget surplus of about $2,000,000,000 this year.\u201d Unemployment for 1962 stood at 5.5 percent, and the report stressed that \u201cunder current conditions of economic recovery, significantly slower than assumed in January, the present 1963 budget estimates reflect generally accepted fiscal requirements . . . [as] the deficit is neither inflationary nor dangerous to our balance-of-payments position.\u201dFootnote 82 With such dire news, the Kennedy administration felt that the PWAA could still serve its countercyclical purpose by injecting much-needed stimulus into the economy. As the year ended, the White House allocated another $197.6 million for its list of \u201coff the shelf\u201d projects, but with only $55.4 million remaining under the appropriations bill, the president had to wait until the new Congress returned to Washington and ask them to appropriate the remaining $500 million.Footnote 83 Thus, as Table 2 shows, by the start of FY 1964\u2014almost one year after the signing of the PWAA\u2014Congress had appropriated $850 million for a variety of local, state, and federal projects, at the president\u2019s request. Yet, in FY1963, government receipts indicated that only $62.5 million (7.35 percent) had been expended. Although Congress restricted the list of projects eligible for funding to shovel-ready improvements, and even some already under way, most of the spending, $653.4 million, took place in fiscal years 1964 and 1965. As intended by members of Congress, in part because of the large degree of involvement on behalf of state governors and administrators in promoting the legislation, the majority of the PWAA\u2019s final obligations went to state and local infrastructure projects. Of the eventual $884 million eventually authorized by the Congress, state and local projects received $602.7 million in obligated funds, while federal projects received $152.5. By the end of 1971, just over $836 million dollars had finally been spent\u2014less than one-third of Kennedy\u2019s initial $2.5 billion proposal put forward ten years earlier. As a result of these adoption and implementation lags, policy analysts have difficulty in attributing specific, substantive effects to the PWAA as a fiscal stimulus. Nevertheless, the two years of largest PWAA spending, FY 1964 and FY 1965, witnessed lower rates of unemployment. The unemployment rates fell from 5.7 percent in 1963 to 5.2 in 1965 and 4.5 percent in 1965. Agencies across the Executive Branch administered the projects funded by the PWAA, but the Area Redevelopment Agency (ARA) served as the primary coordinating unit (along with Hodges) in organizing applications, assisting local governments in requesting funds, allocating lump-sum funding, and measuring total outlays.Footnote 84 The connection of the PWAA to the ARA was established, in part, by the limitations placed on eligible projects, but it was solidified further by Bureau of the Budget concerns about collecting data on the PWAA\u2019s economic imprint. As Kermit Gordon recognized, \u201cShould an acceleration program be effective in reducing the unemployment and increasing the level of economic activity of local communities, a new tool will be available to stimulate economic growth, both locally and nationally.\u201d Yet, because the BoB did not collect any evaluation data on \u201clocal area impact,\u201d the Democrats lacked some of the evidence they would need to promote another accelerated public works bill. Gordon, among others, hoped the ARA\u2019s \u201cfield information reporting program\u201d could serve their needs in the intermediate period until either the BoB or CEA could gather better statistics.Footnote 85 The ARA\u2019s administrative responsibility for implementing the PWAA should not cloud the true intent of either distinct program, especially given the fact that total spending authority under the PWAA was three times greater than that for the ARA. The ARA was not an antirecessionary measure; it had preconceived developmental targets for chronically depressed areas throughout the country. The PWAA, by contrast, had a strict appropriations timeline pegged to economic indicators. Indeed, the coupling of these two programs within one administrative agency seriously hampered the structural improvement efforts of the ARA. As Gregory Wilson argues in his detailed account of the agency, the \u201cquick success of the [PWAA] in providing funds and beginning public works construction upstaged the ARA\u2019s other efforts\u201d and solidified the idea that \u201cthe emphasis on redevelopment should be in public works.\u201dFootnote 86 By 1966, most of the federal monies authorized by the PWAA had been expended and the Johnson administration pushed for an extension of the proposal. Heller\u2014who remained chair of the CEA under President Johnson until after his election\u2014informed the new president in May 1964 that the \u201chigh quality\u201d effects of the PWAA confirmed in his mind that the administration should once again \u201csee whether a sound and fast program can be worked out for future use.\u201d Heller\u2019s insistence on the standby provision suggests that the CEA thought the provision would have made the PWAA even more effective than it was. Nevertheless, the Economic Development Act of 1965 took the form of a congressionally dominated public works package. Moreover, Johnson\u2019s bill contained the same provision that limited public works assistance for areas with a surplus labor problem\u2014now identified as Title I areas.Footnote 87 The 1971 Extension Act further refined the scope of Title I, detailing that monies spent during recessionary times were to focus on short-term employment public works projects, not those related to long-term or structural growth issues. This new Public Works Impact Program (PWIP) stood apart from the larger goals of the renamed ARA, the Economic Redevelopment Administration. However, Blatnik\u2014who continued to chair the House Public Works Committee throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s\u2014routinely fought to give the presidency more discretion in managing PWIP funds.Footnote 88 Yet, In FY2015, the EDA allocated approximately $238 million in local-development projects and while the local-state-federal cooperative elements of the original PWAA remain prevalent features, the countercyclical functions are nonexistent.Footnote 89 As Seymour Harris lamented, while the PWAA and its legislative successors added millions of manpower hours into the economy, the novelty and promise of the new economics never fully took hold. \u201cThe critics gave the President little credit for the revolutionary change in his economic thinking and in his proposals,\u201d Harris wrote.Footnote 90 While suggesting that \u201cJohn F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson stand out, then, as the first modern economists in the American Presidency,\u201d even Walter Heller emphasized the tax cuts that eventually passed Congress in 1964, while neglecting to mention that for the first two years of the new economics, the administration placed its trust, in part, in public works spending.Footnote 91"}, {"url": "https://www.cairco.org/highlights/john-f-kennedy-and-immigration-reform", "page_content": "America's immigration policy was turned upside down in 1965. The Immigration Reform and Nationality Act of 1965 represents the most significant turning point when immigration policy no longer represented the interests of America and Americans.\n\nThe article John F. Kennedy and Immigration Reform, by Ira Mehlman (The Social Contract, Summer, 1991) describes how John F. Kennedy paved the way for our disastrous immigration policy shift. Excerpts are included below:\n\nFor our \"What's past is prologue\" department we remind readers that the Immigration Act of 1965 was the first revision of US immigration policy since 1924, and that the impetus for it came mostly from a policy statement found in a little-remembered book by John F. Kennedy, A Nation of Immigrants (New York: Anti-Defamation League, 1958). Ira Mehlman, a freelance writer in Washington DC, explores the connections between the book and the subsequent legislation.\n\nIn the history of publishing it would be hard to find a book, published by a relatively small press and with almost no public notice, containing ideas that have had a greater and more long-lasting impact on public policy than John F. Kennedy's 1958 treatise, A Nation of Immigrants. The ideas expressed in A Nation of Immigrants (though Kennedy was certainly not the only one expressing them) ultimately became the basis for the immigration reforms of 1965 which, to this day, stand as the foundation of US im-migration policy....\n\nIt is not hard to detect a degree of bitterness in the writings of a man whose ethnic origins and religion were seen as obstacles to his reaching the White House. Kennedy caustically suggests a few additions to Emma Lazarus' poem A New Colossus which welcomes the world's tired and poor to America's shores As long as they come from Northern Europe, are not too tired or too poor or slightly ill...\n\nIn the American Jewish community, Kennedy found a natural ally on the issue of immigration reform. The shame and guilt of American Jews about their failure to do more to save European Jewry from the Holocaust still lingers today, and was all the more palpable so soon after the event. To this day, there is a strong feeling that, had it not been for the highly restrictive immigration policies of the US (and other countries), many of Europe's Jews could have been saved. Thus, it is not surprising that in 1958 the ADL not only endorsed, but published Kennedy's calls for a more liberal US immigration policy....\n\nLike so many of Kennedy's ideas, his views on immigration were not fulfilled in his lifetime, but rather became part of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. And, like so many of the well-intended programs of the Great Society, the immigration reforms Kennedy called for went well beyond their original intent and produced many unforeseen consequences....\n\nIn place of the national origin quota system Kennedy, first in his book, and later as President, called for the institution of an immigration policy that judges all applicants on an equal footing....\n\nWhat Kennedy clearly did not call for was a massive increase in the number of immigrants being admitted to the United States....\n\nIt is also worth noting that the original release of A Nation of Immigrants coincided with the peak of the post-World War II baby boom in the United States. In 1958 the Saturday Evening Post was again the first to recognize the dangers of runaway population growth and its connection with immigration. Long before it was the vogue the Post was writing about the need to limit population growth...\n\nWhen President Kennedy sent his historic message to Congress in 1963 calling for a complete revision of the immigration law, he decided it was also time to revise the book for use as a weapon of enlightenment in the coming legislative battle. ...\n\nIn the year following the second publication of A Nation of Immigrants, Congress incorporated many of the ideas in the book (along with many that were not) into the sweeping 1965 revisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. In retrospect, a quarter of a century later, it is now evident that these reforms were, in every respect, a component of what became known as the Great Society. Proposed and enacted with the very best of intentions, these changes set off a chain of events that few anticipated....\n\n... if the volume of immigration continues to explode, and we maintain domestic policies that continue to balkanize our increasingly diverse population, the immigration reforms of 1965 may eventually prove to be antithetical to basic American unity...."}, {"url": "https://cis.org/Report/HartCeller-Immigration-Act-1965", "page_content": "Download a PDF of this Backgrounder\n\nJerry Kammer is a senior research fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nAs President Lyndon Johnson signed a landmark immigration reform bill into law at a ceremony beneath the Statue of Liberty on October 3, 1965, he predicted the legislation would not significantly affect the life of the nation, but also declared it would accomplish an important national goal.\n\n\"This bill that we will sign today is not a revolutionary bill,\" the president said. \"It does not affect the lives of millions. It will not reshape the structure of our daily lives. ... Yet it is still one of the most important acts of this Congress and of this administration. For it does repair a very deep and painful flaw in the fabric of American justice. It corrects a cruel and enduring wrong in the conduct of the American nation.\"\n\nThe wrong that Johnson and Congress sought to correct was codified in legislation passed 41 years earlier, during a post-war era fraught with anxiety about mass immigration, the shadow of European radicalism, and theories of racial superiority.\n\nAs historian John Higham observed in his account of the 1924 Johnson-Reed Act: \"Nativists during this period argued that the so-called new immigration from southern and eastern Europe was racially inferior to the 'old immigration' from northern and western Europe. It was therefore polluting the nation's bloodstream.\"1\n\nThe 1924 law established a quota system based on national origins. It directed nearly 70 percent of the immigration slots to northern Europeans, cutting back drastically on immigration from southern and eastern Europe. It maintained formidable barriers against immigration from Asia and Africa, while leaving immigration from the Western Hemisphere unrestricted \u2014 a gesture of hemispheric solidarity that also served the cheap-labor interests of American employers.\n\nThe 1965 legislation was named the Hart-Celler Act for its principal sponsors in the Senate and House of Representatives. It abolished the quota system, which critics condemned as a racist contradiction of fundamental American values. By liberalizing the rules for immigration, especially by prioritizing family reunification, it also stimulated rapid growth of immigration numbers. Once immigrants had naturalized, they were able to sponsor relatives in their native lands in an ever-lengthening migratory process called chain migration. That unintended consequence is Hart-Celler's enduring legacy.\n\n\"The 1965 immigration law quickly transformed the ethnic portrait of the United States,\"2 scholars have noted. At first the new immigration came largely from southern Europe, especially Italy. But that stream played out in about a decade. Meanwhile, immigration from Eastern Europe was limited by repressive communist governments.\n\nBy 1980, most immigrants were coming from Latin America, Asia, and Africa \u2014 in numbers far greater than the annual average of 300,000 that had prevailed during the 1960s. Despite assurances by Hart-Celler advocates that the bill would add little to the immigrant stream, more than seven million newcomers entered the country legally during the 1980s. That trend has continued. Meanwhile, illegal immigration also began a decades-long surge.\n\nAnother major factor in the immigration boom was the worldwide population explosion. The population of Latin America, for example, soared from about 200 million in 1960 to 600 million by the end of the century. \"As Latin America's population has grown and its governments and economies have foundered, more and more of its people have looked northward for relief,\" journalist James Fallows wrote in 1983.3\n\nThe growth of immigration from Mexico was especially dramatic, for reasons of geography and labor markets as well as demography. By 1960, according to Douglas Massey and Karen Pren, \"a massive circular flow of Mexican migrants had become deeply embedded in employer practices and migrant expectations\"4 and was sustained by immigrant networks. Those networks exploded along with Mexico's population, which grew from 35 million in 1960 to 100 million at the end of the millennium.\n\nImmigration networks have also spread across Africa. In 2006, for example, a Nigerian man who had just sponsored his mother's immigration under terms of the 1965 legislation told National Public Radio, \"I don't know if you know this: Everybody in the world ... wants to come to the United States of America.\"5\n\nFifty years after the Hart-Celler signing ceremony on Liberty Island, the United States welcomes about a million immigrants each year. They travel along networks energized by the American Dream, swollen by the doubling of the world's population, and enabled by the Hart-Celler Act.\n\nAn Extension of the Fight for Civil Rights\n\nJust as the 1924 legislation was a reflection of what John Higham called \"the tribal twenties\",6 the 1965 legislation was a signature moment of the 1960s. A year earlier Congress had passed the Civil Rights Act, barring discrimination on grounds of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Attorney General Robert Kennedy, brother of slain President John F. Kennedy, connected that legislation to the national origins quota system. \"Everywhere else in our national life, we have eliminated discrimination based on national origins,\" he told a congressional hearing. \"Yet this system is still the foundation of our immigration law.\"7\n\nHart-Celler can also be seen as an expression of the power of emotions noted by John Higham. Long known as the dean of immigration scholars, Higham said that as the 1924 restrictions reduced the immigrant share of the population from 14.7 percent in 1910 to 5.4 percent in 1960, \"a very rapid and widespread assimilation went forward\", which while encouraged by the government, \"arose mostly from an enormous yearning to become Americans.\"8\n\nThat yearning \u2014 for acceptance and recognition in American society \u2014 was manifest in the struggle of ethnic and religious organizations that waged a decades-long fight to abolish the quota system that they perceived as an ongoing insult to millions of Americans and the lands from which they had come. Passage of the 1965 act was therefore a deeply satisfying symbolic gesture.\n\nWhile the consequences of the 1965 act are clear, the story of how it came to be is less well known. As this paper will show, it was shaped by the combination of political circumstances and the ideology and ambition of key figures. Here we will examine the stories of five of them: Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, Reps. Emanuel Celler of New York and Michael Feighan of Ohio, and Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy\n\nFifty-two years after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, his name is linked to immigration primarily because of his still-popular book, A Nation of Immigrants.\n\nFirst published in 1958 as Kennedy was a senator preparing to run for the presidency, the book had two central themes: a celebration of immigrants' contributions to the nation and a call to abolish the system by which they had been selected since 1924.\n\nNearly three decades after that system was enacted it was reaffirmed by the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act, which Congress passed over the veto of President Harry Truman. Truman condemned the national-origins quota system as \"a slur on the patriotism, the capacity, and the decency of a large part of our citizenry.\"9\n\nRenewal of the system was particularly offensive to groups that represented Italians and Jews, who had been particularly affected by the restrictions. The American Committee on Italian Migration conducted an intensive lobbying campaign. Publication of A Nation of Immigrants was a project of the Anti-Defamation league of B'nai B'rith, which had been impressed by Sen. John F. Kennedy's record of supporting liberal immigration laws, including measures to accept refugees from war-ravaged Europe.\n\nThe book was actually written by a member of Kennedy's staff, Myer Feldman. Describing Kennedy's participation as minimal, Feldman said the senator had \"reviewed it, and did some editing.\"10\n\nWhile Kennedy was one of his era's most outspoken reform advocates, he used a 1957 speech to the American Jewish Congress to make clear that he did not favor unlimited immigration. He stated his conviction that \"we should have a system of limited and selective migration to the United States.\"\n\nKennedy's principal objection with the status quo was about \"the nature, not the existence\" of restrictions. Asserting that a selective policy was necessary, he said that policy should \"give preference to an immigrant because he is a nuclear physicist rather than because he is an Anglo-Saxon.\"11\n\nKennedy was aware of the political as well as the ideological value of expansive immigration policies, especially in northern states where immigrants and their families were concentrated. In a 1955 letter to fellow Sen. Lyndon Johnson, he wrote, \"The Democratic Party must do something to fulfill its 1952 pledges concerning revision of the McCarran Act if it is to have any appeal in the large cities of the North in 1956.\"12\n\nKennedy's ambition to appeal to the ethnic vote, however, faced resistance from fellow Democrats whose principal concern was the Cold War confrontation with the Soviet Union. They saw immigration policy as a potential entry point for Communist subversives.\n\nOne of the most important immigration skeptics in Congress was Francis Walter (D-Pa.), co-author of the McCarran-Walter Act. As chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Walter wrote a 1957 article titled \"The War Against Our Immigration Law\", in which he warned: \"Spearheaded by the Communists, their fellow travellers, Congressional 'liberals' and spokesmen for the so-called ethnic minority blocs, the assault on America's immigration system is increasing in intensity every month.\"13\n\nIn this super-heated environment, Kennedy's approach was a mixture of liberal idealism and political pragmatism. And so, after becoming president in 1961, he moved cautiously lest he antagonize Walter, with whom he had a good relationship. The New York Times described the Pennsylvanian as \"one of President Kennedy's most valued lieutenants in the House.\"\n\nOne Justice Department official assigned to the project of drafting and promoting a bill said the task initially seemed \"almost hopeless\"14 because of the entrenched congressional opposition that had long been led by Walter. As the New York Times later reported: \"When it came to regulating immigration during the Truman and Eisenhower Administrations, President proposed, but Representative Walter disposed.\"15\n\nWalter's death in mid-1963 after a battle with leukemia enabled Kennedy to make his move. He called for a new system that would allow for \"those with the greatest ability to add to the national welfare, no matter where they were born.\" He called on Congress to \"eliminate discrimination between peoples and nations on a basis that is unrelated to any contribution that immigrants can make and is inconsistent with our traditions of welcome.\"16\n\nIn short order, twin bills that embodied the president's program were introduced. The Senate version was sponsored by Philip Hart (D-Mich.), while the House bill was sponsored by Emanuel Celler (D-N.Y.).\n\nBy this time, however, the administration was occupied with other priorities, particularly in foreign policy. Moreover, it quickly became apparent that Walter's replacement at the head of the Judiciary Committee was not eager to move on immigration.\n\nAnd so wrote Abba Schwartz, the State Department official who had been assigned to get the ball rolling on immigration: \"It was not surprising, therefore, that little was done on the pending immigration legislation before President Kennedy went to Dallas in late November, 1963.\"17\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson\n\nWhen President Lyndon Johnson signed the Hart-Celler Act into law in October 1965, he was at the height of his powers. A year earlier, after his landslide election victory over Barry Goldwater, he was in a euphoric mood as he proclaimed, \"These are the most hopeful times since Christ was born in Bethlehem.\"18 Richard Goodwin, a White House speechwriter, had coined the phrase the \"the Great Society\" to signal the extent of Johnson's ambition to establish a broad range of government services and programs. Goodwin later wrote that liberals during this period had the expansive sense that the world was \"malleable to their grasp\".\n\nBeginning the new term with an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress, Johnson presided over a series of legislative victories, including the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights act, the establishment of Medicare and Medicaid, and programs to implement his \"war on poverty\". He made immigration a priority for 1965.\n\nJohnson biographer Robert Dallek said the tragic circumstances that had put Johnson in the White House also made many Americans eager to support his redemptive vision of national greatness.\n\n\"John F. Kennedy's assassination played a large part in creating a national mood of eagerness for reform,\" Dallek wrote. \"It was as if the country wished to purge itself of feelings that it was a sick society that fostered violence instead of healing and education and uplift. Johnson, with his evangelical fervor for social change and ability to speak to the country and the South in particular ... was the right president at the right time.\"19\n\nPresident Kennedy, preoccupied with foreign policy, had not mentioned immigration in any of his three State of the Union addresses. But as Johnson delivered his first such address less than two months after becoming president he became an energetic advocate of the reform.\n\n\"We must ... lift by legislation the bars of discrimination against those who seek entry into our country, particularly those who have much needed skills and those joining their families,\" President Johnson said. In a reference to the legislation's use of preferences to replace national quotas, he added: \"A nation that was built by the immigrants of all lands can ask those who now seek admission: 'What can you do for our country?' But we should not be asking: 'In what country were you born?'\"\n\nFamous for his forceful talents of personal persuasion, Johnson summoned congressional leaders to a White House meeting that included representatives of religious, ethnic, and labor organizations. He learned that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Emanuel Celler was encountering resistance from Michael Feighan, the conservative Ohio Democrat who replaced Francis Walter as chair of the immigration subcommittee.\n\nJohnson responded with characteristic forcefulness. The New York Times reported that Johnson \"put Mr. Feighan on his fabled list for 'the treatment.' That meant White House dinners, consultations in the Oval Office and trips on Air Force One.\"\n\nJohnson's success with the immigration bill was one of his last domestic victories. His popularity would be fleeting. The war in Vietnam deeply divided the country and Johnson decided not to seek reelection in 1968. There were hints of the trouble ahead even in that fall of 1965 as he signed the immigration bill.\n\nThe same October 4, 1965, New York Times front page that reported on the signing ceremony on Liberty Island included other stories that foreshadowed the trouble ahead. One reported a warning from Chinese President Chou En-lai about the dangers of expanding the war in Vietnam. But Johnson persisted. He expanded the war, and his popularity withered. The war would have major implications for immigration. Hundreds of thousands of Southeast Asians would flee the violence as refugees and many would find homes in the United States.\n\nIn publishing the story about the signing of Hart-Celler, the Times, made an editorial decision that suggested the issue of Cuban refugees was more momentous and controversial than the sweeping immigration reform, which had passed with overwhelming majorities in both the House and Senate. Its headline read: \"U.S. to Admit Cubans Castro Frees; Johnson Signs New Immigration Bill\".\n\nThe story's lede reported that:\n\nPresident Johnson, speaking in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty, announced today that he would open the nation's gates to all Cubans who wanted to escape the regime of Fidel Castro and \"seek freedom\" in the United States.20\n\nRep. Emanuel Cellar\n\nJohn Higham described the 1924 Johnson-Reed Act as a \"blatantly discriminatory\" effort \"to freeze the existing balance of ethnic strains in the total American population\" by sharply restricting the arrival of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. \"Since the brunt of the restrictionist attack was aimed more than ever at the supposedly racial qualities of the new immigration, it stung the Jews, the Italians, the Slavs, and the Greeks deeply,\" Higham wrote.21\n\nNo one gave voice to that resentment more forcefully than Emanuel Celler. He became a member of the House of Representatives in 1923 and fought the Johnson-Reed Act from the start. Celler kept fighting for 41 years until he was able to attach his name to legislation that erased the national-origins system.\n\nWhile agreeing that Congress needed to establish limits on immigration, Celler was bitterly opposed to a system whose advocates talked of defending a \"distinct American type\" and \"keeping America for Americans\".22\n\nAs Johnson-Reed became law, to be hailed in a Los Angeles Times story headlined \"Nordic Victory Seen in Drastic Reduction\",23 Celler issued this brooding assessment:\n\nThe \"inferior complex\" is now extended to all Europe, save Nordics. The Austrian rubbing elbows with the Norwegian in the subway or on the street is beset with emotions of inferiority. His pride surges within him. He resents the stigma placed upon him. Surely he does not view the favored one with complacency. Does he not rather view him with hatred? ... And so race is set against race, class against class24\n\nCeller's combativeness grew from his affection for the immigrant strivers who lived in his district. \"The folklore of Poland, of Lithuania, of Russia, of Italy became part of my folklore because I had heard it so often,\" he wrote in his autobiography. \"I knew their richness and their laughter and the disappointing heartbreak of the struggle in America to adjust. I knew, also, their pride, the unfulfilled dream of independence that had first brought them here.\"25\n\nDuring World War II, Celler appealed in vain for President Franklin Roosevelt to rescue Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazis. In the Cold War era of the 1950s, he opposed the McCarran-Walter Act, whose advocates said it was needed to protect the country from subversives from abroad.\n\nThe prevailing national mood in the early 1950s was conservative and isolationist. It was a trying time for liberal advocates of immigration reform. One militant critic on the right mocked them as \"the usual claque of innocent dupes who don't know what they are doing \u2014 the gulliberals \u2014 who have always done the work of the Communist Party.\"26\n\nEventually the wary conservatism of the 1950s \u2014 given its most virulent expression by the notorious, red-baiting Sen. Joseph McCarthy \u2014 gave way to the liberal activism of the 1960s, whose galvanizing figure was the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. Celler, as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, played an important role in passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, whose explicit prohibition of discrimination by national origin became a predicate for immigration reform. \"In a time when this country is attempting to wipe away ancient wrongs against Negro citizens,\" said a New York Times editorial, \"its conscience will not permit a sign at all ports of entry reading: 'Only whites from Northwestern Europe are welcome.\"'27\n\nWhen President Johnson picked up the legislation written by President Kennedy's Justice Department, Celler immediately signed on. But progress stalled as Celler engaged in what became a notorious Capitol Hill feud with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee's immigration subcommittee, an ardent anti-communist and immigration skeptic from Ohio named Michael Feighan.\n\nThe communist threat was not the only concern of those who resisted changes to the national origins quota system. The early 1960s was a time of growing alarm about what the New York Times described as \"the explosive rate of the growth of the world's population\". A former chairman of the Federal Reserve System described the population boom as the \"most vitally important problem facing the world today,\" warning that it \"may well prove to be more explosive than the atomic or hydrogen bomb.\"28\n\nA New York Times editorial demonstrated the issue's connection to immigration. Citing projections that the world's population would double to more than six billion by the end of the century, it observed that the demographic boom \"imposes a severe burden on efforts to raise the miserably low standards of living of two-thirds of the world's people.\"29\n\nThose who sought to limit immigration warned that unless Congress acted, the United States could be overwhelmed by desperate people ignoring borders and clamoring for visas. The reform advocates responded with a disciplined messaging strategy. Uniting in the insistence that their proposal would allow only minimal growth of immigration, they played up the symbolic importance of erasing the old system.\n\nCeller, for example, dismissed concerns about immigration-driven population growth as \"totally irrelevant since the bill before you in no way significantly increases the basic numbers of immigrants to be permitted entry. We are not talking about increased immigration; we are talking about equality of opportunity for all peoples to reach this promised land.\"30\n\nIn another attempt to discredit the alarmists, Celler said, \"Since the people of Africa and Asia have very few relatives here, comparatively few could immigrate from those countries because they have no family ties in the United States.\"31\n\nRep. Michael Feighan\n\nIn early 1965 Ohio Democrat Michael Feighan, chairman of the House immigration subcommittee, delivered what he would call his \"bombshell\"32 speech to the 36th annual conference of the American Coalition of Patriotic Societies, a conservative group that supported the national origins quota system of immigration law.\n\nFeighan, who had used his position at the immigration subcommittee to stall the Johnson administration's push for reform, proposed an alternative plan. He would go along with abolition of the national origins system. But as part of the deal he wanted a new system whose first priority would be family unification, not boosting the nation's supply of skilled workers.\n\nFeighan sought to win over conservative groups by demonstrating that the old system had been rendered useless by special legislation \u2014 including thousands of \"private bills\" to aid individuals and families \u2014 that swelled the numbers of immigrants not covered by the quotas. \"If the system was intended to restrict immigration to the United States, it has failed,\" Feighan said.\"33\n\nHistorian Steven Gillon called Feighan's move \"a clever ploy [that] allowed him to support reform by claiming that the old system was too permissive.34 In any case, the Feighan plan became part of the 1965 law and led to the radical change in future immigration. The administration had proposed reserving 50 percent of the immigrant visas for persons with needed skills. Feighan's legislation allocated 74 percent to family visas, including so many for siblings that it was dubbed \"the Brothers and Sisters Act\".35\n\nIn a single stroke, Feighan sought to cast off the obstructionist label he had acquired in 1964 when he stalled hearings on the administration bill because of his feud with Celler over Feighan's request to fund a joint House-Senate subcommittee investigation into the federal government's management of immigration policy.\n\nCeller blocked the funding, suspecting that Feighan would turn the inquiry into a witch hunt for communist influence in U.S. policy.36 Feighan's militant anti-communism was widely known and struck some of his critics as obsessive. \"Many of Mr. Feighan's colleagues regard him as temperamental and unpredictable and bracket him vaguely with 'the right wing cranks,\" the New York Times reported.37\n\nA year earlier, columnist Drew Pearson mockingly wrote that Feighan \"has been seeing communist plots around almost every corner.\"38 Pearson openly favored Feighan's opponent in the 1964 Democratic primary, a young Cleveland attorney who had made Feighan's immigration politics a major part of his campaign.\n\nPresident Johnson also weighed in. During a campaign visit to Cleveland that year, he also reprimanded the local congressman for delaying the bill.39 A State Department official who worked on immigration reform would write that little progress was made until \"Feighan's recalcitrant attitude was broken by heavy pressure from his colleagues in the Congress, the White House, private organizations, and his constituents in Cleveland.\"40\n\nFeighan's plan was a master stroke of local politics. It not only endeared him to labor unions that did not want a soft labor market for employers of skilled workers, but also won the gratitude of ethnic organizations that represented his district's large population of voters with relatives in eastern Europe.\n\nThe archives of Feighan's documents at Princeton, his alma mater, show the importance of the ethnic groups to his narrow 1964 primary win. A letter from the Committee of Serbian Organizations of Cuyahoga County announced their unanimous endorsement of Feighan.41 Another document shows endorsements from Organized Labor, the Hungarian Democratic League, the Slovak League of America, the United Ukrainian Societies of Cleveland, the Croatian Societies of Cleveland, American Friends of Anti Bolshevik Bloc of Nations, and the Byelorussian Association of Cleveland.\n\nThe archive also shows that Feighan was under pressure from an Italian-American organization that had been frustrated by his lack of enthusiasm for reforming a system that \"blatantly brands us second-class citizens\".42\n\nFeighan's plan even had fans on the other side of the debate. Conservative and patriotic groups like the American Legion expressed satisfaction with his assurance that it would maintain the old, familiar pattern of immigration that had been eroded in recent years.\n\nAn article in the American Legion Magazine assured readers: \"Nobody is quite so apt to be of the same national origin of our present citizens as are members of their immediate families, and the great bulk of immigration henceforth will not merely hail from the same parent countries as our present citizens, but will be their close relatives.\"43\n\nIn addition to reversing the preference priorities, Feighan also sought to reduce immigration by setting an absolute annual limit on the number of immigrants welcomed to the country. That effort would fail, but concerns about population growth would live on.\n\nIn a speech delivered at the City Club of Cleveland in the spring of 1965, Feighan cited a column by influential national political commentator Eric Sevareid who spoke of \"fast-running population growth\" as a national problem and expressed concern about the 300,000 immigrants the United States was taking every year.\n\n\"That means a million extra every three years,\" wrote Sevareid in a call for a national discussion on the issue. \"This country is not going to close its doors to refugees from tyranny, or refuse to reunite families \u2014 that would harm the very soul of America \u2014 but beyond that point in immigration there is not only room for argument, but need for argument.\"44\n\nBut there was remarkably little discussion of the population issue as Hart-Celler moved through Congress. The bill's conservative foes raised the issue. Its liberal supporters were successful in dismissing it.\n\nMeanwhile, the press gave credence to the predictions that the legislation would not change the sources of the immigrant flows. A Washington Post editorial said Feighan's move to prioritize family relationships over skills \"had more emotional appeal and, perhaps more to the point, insured that the new immigration pattern would not stray radically from the old one.\"45\n\nSen. Edward Kennedy\n\nWhen the Hart-Celler Act became law, Sen. Edward Kennedy marveled at the accomplishment. \"It's really amazing,\" Kennedy said. \"A year ago, I doubt the bill would have had a chance. This time it was easy.\"46\n\nThere were multiple reasons for the success in overturning an immigration system that had been locked in place since 1924. Perhaps the most important was the landslide election of 1964, after which the Democrats held 68 seats in the Senate and 248 seats in the House. The switch of Rep. Michael Feighan from resistance to cooperation was key in the House. In the Senate, much of credit went to the political and personal skill of the 33-year-old Kennedy, who had been elected just three years earlier to the seat once held by his brother John.\n\nOne of the elements of Kennedy's success was his good working relationship with the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Mississippi Democrat James Eastland. Eastland, a notorious segregationist, had long fought to uphold the system put in place in 1924. But in the summer of 1965, the New York Times reported Eastland had said \"that he would do nothing to block the administration's measure, and turned over public hearings of the bill to one of its strongest advocates, Edward M. Kennedy.\"47 Eastland's remarkable gesture may have been an effort to support his old friend, President Johnson.\n\nKennedy was particularly effective in winning the trust of the Judiciary Committee's most articulate and committed defender of the old system, North Carolina Democrat Sam Ervin. Ervin favored special recognition of those \"groups who historically had the greatest influence in building the nation\". He described the national-origins system as a benign \"mirror reflecting the United States\".48\n\nBut of course the United States in the mid-1960s was undergoing dramatic social change where liberal values were ascendant, particularly regarding race relations and minority rights. Edward Kennedy's ability to develop friendships with those who resisted the change, particularly powerful southern Democrats, enabled him to defuse tensions like those that developed between Ervin and Kennedy's brother, Robert Kennedy, who had been elected to the Senate from New York in 1964.\n\nThe intensity of Robert Kennedy's dislike of the national-origins system brought advantages and disadvantages to the reform effort. On the one hand, he was an eloquent spokesman for the proposition that the old system was unjust. On the other, he was temperamentally incapable of concealing his frustration with Ervin's views.\n\nEdward Kennedy managed to smooth things over. As described by biographer Burton Hersh, he \"ostentatiously pinned a shamrock on Sam Ervin's lapel on Saint Patrick's Day, very soon after Bobby had riled up the old Dixie autocrat.\"49\n\nIn his effort to ease the anxiety of conservatives, Edward Kennedy met with representatives of the American Coalition of Patriotic Societies, the American Legion, the Daughters of the American Revolution, and the National Association of Evangelicals. There he appears to have benefitted from Rep. Feighan's research showing that Congress so frequently passed legislation to circumvent the quotas that the national origins system had become dysfunctional.\n\n\"While most of those with whom I met were skeptical regarding the various reform channels,\" Kennedy wrote, \"I believe it is fair to say that all recognized the unworkability of the national origins quota system and at the close of the meeting expressed a willingness to cooperate in finding a new formula for the selection of immigrants.\"50\n\nOne of the strongest arguments against the reform bill was presented at a Senate hearing by Myra C. Hacker, of a group called the New Jersey Coalition. Warning against lowering the barriers to entry at a time of a worldwide population boom, she told a Senate hearing:\n\nIn light of our 5 percent unemployment rate, our worries over the so-called population explosion, and our menacingly mounting welfare costs, are we prepared to embrace so great a horde of the world's unfortunates? At the very least, the hidden mathematics of the bill should be made clear to the public so that they may tell their congressmen how they feel about providing jobs, schools, homes, security against want, citizen education, and a brotherly welcome ... for an indeterminately enormous number of aliens from underprivileged lands.51\n\nThe Johnson administration devised a successful strategy for dismissing such concerns. It issued a \"Blue Book\" that advised reform advocates to stick to the message that their measure \"leaves the present authorized level of immigration substantially unchanged.\"52\n\nThe line was rigorously followed by two key administration officials who testified at the hearing: Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and Secretary of State Dean Rusk. And in the Senate, Edward Kennedy offered this assurance: \"The bill will not flood our cities with immigrants. It will not upset the ethnic mix of our society. It will not relax the standards of admission. It will not cause American workers to lose their jobs.\"53\n\nSuch assurances reflected political necessity rather than careful analysis. Steven Gillon reported that \"neither Congress nor the White House had carefully analyzed the potential impact of the family preference system.\"\n\nAnd so, swept along by an historic tide of liberal convictions, the Hart-Celler Act won overwhelming approval in both Houses of Congress.\n\nEdward Kennedy helped the bill clear a final obstacle by accepting the demand of Ervin and Senator Minority leader Everett Dirksen that it include a cap on immigration from the Western Hemisphere. When the bill became law, Ervin had high praise for his young colleague. He wrote that the legislation would have taken a different course \"had it not been for the tact and the understanding and the devotion which the senator from Massachusetts gave to the bill.\"54\n\nConclusion\n\nOne of the most widely quoted critiques of the Hart-Celler Act was written by journalist Theodore White, author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning book on the 1960 presidential campaign won by John Kennedy. In his 1982 book America in Search of Itself, White first described the legislation as \"noble\". Then he contradicted President Johnson's signing-day assurance that it was \"not a revolutionary bill\". White said the bill was \"revolutionary and probably the most thoughtless of the many acts of the Great Society.\"55\n\nHistorian Roger Daniels took note of the legislation's cascading demographic effects and issued this somber judgment: \"Had Congress fully understood its consequences, it almost certainly would not have passed.\"56\n\nThe nobility of the legislation lay in its defense of the American creed that all me are created equal. Its success in Congress was a demonstration of how much the nation had changed from the days when conservatives smeared immigration-reforming liberals as communist dupes and \"gulliberals\" and when frankly segregationist views were commonplace.\n\nToday, the prevailing ideological boot is on the other foot. As early as 1968, when the New York Times reported that \"the extent of the change\" in immigration because of the new law had surprised nearly everyone, it quoted someone who said corrective action was not likely because \"congressmen don't want to look like racists.\"57\n\nNow it is those who express the conservative conviction that immigration should be limited who receive the harshest attacks. Immigration advocacy groups and political operatives often label them as racists, nativists, bigots, and reactionaries.\n\nToday, the political and demographic momentum is on the side of expansive immigration. The role of the immigrant vote is more important than ever. Their political organization has grown steadily stronger from a base that was already politically effective 30 years ago when, as Carolyn Wong noted, \"Ethnic advocates representing Asian American and Hispanic communities were particularly skillful in their advocacy of open-immigration policies toward their countries of origin.\"58\n\nHart-Celler culminated the nation's dramatic change from the era after the 1924 legislation when, according to historian Aristide Zolberg, the United States in effect proclaimed to the face of the world, 'We are no longer a nation of immigrants.'\"59\n\nIn 1993, assessing the legacy of Hart-Celler, Nathan Glazer wrote, \"When one considers present immigration policies, it seems we have insensibly reverted to mass immigration, without ever having made a decision to.\"60\n\nIn 2000, Harvard sociologist Christopher Jencks took a look at the demographic consequences of U.S. immigration policy, projecting that it had put us on course for a population of 500 million by 2050. Wrote Jencks:\n\nWhen I first made these calculations, I viewed them as statistical fantasies. Long before 2050, I thought, the electorate would revolt. Every European country that has experienced high levels of immigration has seen such a revolt. But Congress will not curtail the growth of immigration just because poll data show that the public favors such a change. Immigration will level off only if the political groups that drove it up over the past generation become weaker or if those who want immigration reduced become stronger.61\n\nThen, perhaps with an idea about the sort of political pressures reflected in the 1968 New York Times article on congressmen who didn't want to appear to be racist, Jencks added a gloomy assessment of the possibilities that leaders would direct a change. \"Once I posed the problem this way,\" he wrote, \"my statistical projections no longer seemed so fanciful.\"\n\nJencks had quantified concerns that led Theodore White to lament the consequences of Hart-Celler. \"Only one other great republic has ever experienced such a change in the texture of its people \u2014 the Roman Republic,\" White wrote. He then observed that \"Rome could not pass on the heritage of its past to the people of its future\" and ultimately unraveled so badly that it \"could no longer govern itself\".\n\nWhite's pessimism about the potential consequences of mass immigration remains a central concern of those who seek to limit immigration. But, of course, there are powerful voices on the other side of the debate. In a new book released in time for Hart-Celler's 50th anniversary, journalist Tom Gjelten quotes Walter Lippman's observation in 1913 \u2014 an era of intense immigration that eventually led to the backlash that produced the 1924 Johnson-Reed Act \u2014 that while immigration \"may swamp us, it may, if we seize the opportunity, mean the impregnation of our national life with a new brilliancy.\"\n\nGjelten closes his book with an optimistic assessment of the ongoing legacy of Hart-Celler, writing that \"it is only in the half century after 1965, with a population connected to every corner of the globe, that the country has finally begun to demonstrate the exceptionalism it has long claimed for itself.\"62\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1 John Higham, \"Cultural Responses to Immigration\", Democracy and its DiscontentsNeil J.

The law created an \u201cAsiatic barred zone\u201d provision, which prohibited immigration from British India, most of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Middle East. In addition, the law required a basic literacy test for all immigrants and barred homosexuals, \u201cidiots,\u201d the \u201cinsane,\u201d alcoholics, \u201canarchists,\u201d and several other categories from immigrating.\n\nKey Takeaways: Immigration Act of 1917 The Immigration Act of 1917 banned all immigration to the United States from British India, most of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Middle East.\n\nThe Act was spurred by the isolationist movement seeking to prevent the United States from becoming involved in World War I.\n\nThe Act required all immigrants to pass a basic literacy test administered in their native language.\n\nThe Act also barred certain \u201cundesirable\u201d individuals, such as \u201cidiots,\u201d the \u201cinsane,\u201d alcoholics, \u201canarchists\u201d from entering the United States.\n\nThough President Woodrow Wilson initially vetoed the Immigration Act of 1917, Congress overwhelmingly overrode his veto, making the act a federal law on February 5, 1917.\n\nDetails and Effects of the Immigration Act of 1917\n\nFrom the late 1800s to the early 1900s, no nation welcomed more immigrants into its borders than the United States. In 1907 alone, a record 1.3 million immigrants entered the U.S. through New York\u2019s Ellis Island. However, the Immigration Act of 1917, a product of the pre-World War I isolationism movement, would drastically change that.\n\nAlso known as the Asiatic Barred Zone Act, the Immigration Act of 1917 barred immigrants from a large part of the world loosely defined as \u201cany country not owned by the U.S. adjacent to the continent of Asia.\u201d In practice, the barred zone provision excluded immigrants from Afghanistan, the Arabian Peninsula, Asiatic Russia, India, Malaysia, Myanmar, and the Polynesian Islands. However, both Japan and the Philippines were excluded from the barred zone. The law also allowed exceptions for students, certain professionals such as teachers and doctors, and their wives and children.\n\nOther provisions of the law increased the \u201chead tax\u201d immigrants were required to pay on entry to $8 per person and eliminated a provision in an earlier law that excused Mexican farm and railroad workers from it.\n\nThe law also barred all immigrants over the age of 16 who were illiterate or deemed to be \u201cmentally defective\u201d or physically handicapped. The term \u201cmentally defective\u201d was interpreted to effectively exclude homosexual immigrants who admitted their sexual orientation. U.S. immigration laws continued to ban homosexuals until the passage of the Immigration Act of 1990, sponsored by Democratic Senator Edward M. Kennedy.\n\nThe law defined literacy as being able to read a simple 30 to 40-word passage written in the immigrant\u2019s native language. Persons who claimed they were entering the U.S. to avoid religious persecution in their country of origin were not required to take the literacy test.\n\nThe law also included specific language barring the immigration of \u201cidiots, imbeciles, epileptics, alcoholics, poor, criminals, beggars, any person suffering attacks of insanity, those with tuberculosis, and those who have any form of dangerous contagious disease, aliens who have a physical disability that will restrict them from earning a living in the United States..., polygamists and anarchists,\u201d as well as \u201cthose who were against the organized government or those who advocated the unlawful destruction of property and those who advocated the unlawful assault of killing of any officer.\u201d\n\nEffect of the Immigration Act of 1917\n\nTo say the least, the Immigration Act of 1917 had the impact desired by its supporters. According to the Migration Policy Institute, only about 110,000 new immigrants were allowed to enter the United States in 1918, compared to more than 1.2 million in 1913.\n\nFurther limiting immigration, Congress passed the National Origins Act of 1924, which for the first time established an immigration-limiting quota system and required all immigrants to be screened while still in their countries of origin. The law resulted in the virtual closure of Ellis Island as an immigrant processing center. After 1924, the only immigrants still being screened at Ellis Island were those who had problems with their paperwork, war refugees, and displaced persons.\n\nIsolationism Drove the Immigration Act of 1917\n\nAs an outgrowth of the American isolationism movement that dominated the 19th century, the Immigration Restriction League was founded in Boston in 1894. Seeking mainly to slow the entry of \u201clower-class\u201d immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, the group lobbied Congress to pass legislation requiring immigrants to prove their literacy.\n\nIn 1897, Congress passed an immigrant literacy bill sponsored by Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, but President Grover Cleveland vetoed the law.\n\nBe early 1917, with America\u2019s participation in World War I appearing inevitable, demands for isolationism hit an all-time high. In that growing atmosphere of xenophobia, Congress easily passed the Immigration Act of 1917 and then overrode President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s veto of the law by a supermajority vote.\n\nAmendments Restore US Immigration\n\nThe negative effects of drastically reduced immigration and the general inequity of laws like the Immigration Act of 1917 soon become apparent and Congress reacted.\n\nWith World War I reducing the American workforce, Congress amended the Immigration Act of 1917 to reinstate a provision exempting Mexican farm and ranch workers from the entry tax requirement. The exemption was soon extended to Mexican mining and railroad industry workers.\n\nShortly after the end of World War II, the Luce-Celler Act of 1946, sponsored by Republican Representative Clare Boothe Luce and Democrat Emanuel Celler, eased immigration and naturalization restrictions against Asian Indian and Filipino immigrants. The law allowed the immigration of up to 100 Filipinos and 100 Indians per year and again allowed Filipino and Indian immigrants to become United States citizens. The law also allowed naturalized Indian Americans and Filipino Americans to own homes and farms and to petition for their family members to be allowed to immigrate to the United States.\n\nIn the final year of the presidency of Harry S. Truman, Congress further amended the Immigration Act of 1917 with its passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, known as the McCarran-Walter Act. The law allowed Japanese, Korean, and other Asian immigrants to seek naturalization and established an immigration system that placed emphasis on skill sets and reuniting families. Concerned by the fact that the law maintained a quota system drastically limiting immigration from Asian nations, Wilson vetoed the McCarran-Walter Act, but Congress garnered the votes needed to override the veto.\n\nBetween 1860 and 1920, the immigrant share of the total U.S. population varied between 13% and nearly 15%, peaking at 14.8% in 1890, mainly due to high levels of immigrants from Europe.\n\nAs of the end of 1994, the U.S. immigrant population stood at more than 42.4 million, or 13.3%, of the total U.S. population, according to Census Bureau data. Between 2013 and 2014, the foreign-born population of the U.S. increased by 1 million, or 2.5%.\n\nImmigrants to the United States and their children born in the U.S. now number approximately 81 million people, or 26% of the overall U.S. population.\n\nSources and Further Reference"}]}
