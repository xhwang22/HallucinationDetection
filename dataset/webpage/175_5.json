But fifth place is not where Ledecky, who came in targeting five gold medals, ever expected to be.\n\nImage Ledecky\u2019s teammate, Erica Sullivan, won silver. Credit...

There would be no medal ceremony before the start of her next event, the 1,500-meter freestyle.\n\nEver since the Olympic schedule came out years ago, this was the day she had circled, the day she would try to pull off a golden double by winning two vastly different races.\n\nIt would be the kind of day Michael Phelps had in 2008, when he won the 200-meter butterfly and a relay gold in the same session. Now it was going in the wrong direction, shocking her competitors.\n\n\u201cI always thought she was going to be there,\u201d Titmus said, regarding the 200, which gave her a second gold medal in three days.\n\nImage Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nInstead, Ledecky headed for the warm-down pool. She conferred with her coach, Greg Meehan. He told her be angry if she wanted to, but at least she had more time to prepare for the metric mile swim.\n\nShe said she had always planned to use the adrenaline from her performance in the 200 to power her through the 1,500, the longest race in the pool and a grueling physical and mental test.\n\n\u201cThings didn\u2019t work out super-well there,\u201d she said.\n\nAs she swam back and forth in the warm-up pool, she thought of her family, especially her grandparents, the toughest people she knows. And she tried to get her head around the next task.\n\nThen, just before noon, she hit the water in the 1,500, and roughly a minute or two later order in the swimming universe was restored.\n\nImage Ledecky built her typical dominating lead. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nLedecky, the ultimate distance freak, has loved the 1,500 since she first raced at the distance when she was 12, and has been nearly impossible to beat in it ever since.\n\nLedecky was a body-length ahead of Jianjiahe Wang of China after 200 meters and five meters ahead at the 300-meter mark. Breathing every other stroke, barely kicking, and stretching her lead on each turn, she swam in cruise control for much of the rest of the race.\n\nWomen\u2019s 1,500-Meter Freestyle PLAY Length 0 of 30 x x x x x x\n\nErica Sullivan, her American teammate, pushed her ever so slightly at the end, getting to within seven meters of Ledecky.

Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nWhen she touched the wall, Ledecky smacked the water and let out a scream.\n\nIt was her second medal of the Games, after her silver in the 400, but her first gold, the kind of medal she expects to take home. She corralled Sullivan, who did not realize she had captured the silver, a huge moment in the Tokyo pool for a woman whose mother is Japanese. Usually steely, Ledecky was close to tears \u2014 they would flow in the post-race news conferences \u2014 another superstar athlete at these games trying to manage the pressure of outsized expectations.\n\nOn Tuesday, that pressure had claimed Naomi Osaka of Japan and Simone Biles. On Wednesday, the Tokyo Games tested Ledecky in a way she had not been tested before, and she had made it through.\n\n\u201cPeople maybe feel bad for me not winning everything, but I want people to be more concerned about other things going on in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cThe most pressure I feel is the pressure I put on myself.\u201d\n\nImage Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nIn the day\u2019s other finals, Kristof Milak of Hungary did what he usually does in the 200-meter butterfly: destroy the field in a race that was never in doubt.\n\nMilak, the world-record holder, won the gold medal with a breathtaking time of 1:51.25, just off his world record of 1:50.73. It was a new Olympic record. He was more than a full body and two seconds ahead of Tomoru Honda of Japan, who won the silver, and three seconds ahead of Federico Burdisso of Italy, who won the bronze.\n\nIn the 200-meter individual medley, Yui Ohashi of Japan, an emerging star for the host country, won her second gold medal of the Tokyo Games finishing in 2:08:52. Ohashi came on strong in the final 25 meters to overtake Americans Kate Douglass and Alex Walsh by seven one-hundreths of a second.\n\nImage Ledecky and her competitors inaugurated the 1,500-meter event for women at the Olympics.

Big names pulled out of competition. The host city reported its highest one-day total of coronavirus cases. A typhoon buffeted the region with rain and wind. Pre-event light shows swirled through arenas devoid of fans because of the pandemic.\n\nLeave it to Katie Ledecky to provide a few minutes of normalcy.\n\nThe 24-year-old completed a grueling double by cruising to victory in the 1,500-meter freestyle at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre on Wednesday, about an hour after swimming the 200 freestyle final.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople maybe feel bad that I\u2019m not winning everything, but I want people to be more concerned about other things in the world,\u201d Ledecky said. \u201cPeople are truly suffering. I\u2019m just proud to bring home a gold medal.\u201d\n\nNo other swimmer at the Games attempted a similar test of speed and endurance. The feat looked routine. She spent most of the race in a familiar position: all alone in the lead with the seven other competitors trailing far behind.\n\nLedecky finished in 15 minutes 37.34 seconds \u2014 the fifth individual Olympic gold of her decorated career \u2014 in a race she\u2019s dominated like no other woman.\n\nAfter touching the wall, she pumped her arm in celebration. Then she hugged teammate Erica Sullivan, who used a strong push in the final laps to win silver, in the adjacent lane.\n\nKatie Ledecky, right, and Erica Sullivan show off their gold and silver medals after their 1-2 finish in the 1,500-meter freestyle Wednesday. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a legend and she\u2019ll forever be a legend,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cThe fact that I get to swim in the same generation as her, it\u2019s just so cool.\u201d\n\nThe event joined the women\u2019s Olympic program for the first time, though the men have competed in at the Games since 1904. That provided an opportunity for Ledecky to win gold in an event in which the outcome was as certain as, if not more certain than, any other competition.\n\nWhen Ledecky swims the 1,500, the real race is for second place. She first broke the world record in the event in 2013, her most recent record is from 2018 and, including Wednesday\u2019s race, she owns the top 13 times in history. No one else is close.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just the victory, impressive as it might have been, that stood out; it also was how Ledecky did it. The race capped an exhausting 48-hour span in which she swam 4,000 meters over six races.\n\nCompeting in the 1,500 is demanding enough. Adding a sprint like the 200 an hour beforehand doesn\u2019t happen unless your name is Ledecky.\n\nKatie Ledecky walks away from the pool at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre after finishing fifth in the 200-meter freestyle Wednesday. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\nHowever, her morning didn\u2019t start in characteristic fashion.\n\nThe 200 freestyle is the most competitive event in Ledecky\u2019s program, but she entered the final as the defending Olympic champion and appeared on track to contend for a medal, if not challenge to claim gold again, after promising swims during the preliminaries and semifinals.\n\nIt quickly became apparent this wasn\u2019t a normal race. Ledecky fell to seventh place after the first 50 meters and never challenged the leaders. The sight of the woman who has dominated freestyle swimming for more than a decade \u2014 and makes a habit of winning long-distance races by several body lengths \u2014 trailing by such a margin was jarring for the handful of athletes, officials and media in the building.\n\nAustralian sensation Ariarne Titmus, who recorded the second-best all-time mark in the event last month, won in 1:53.50. Ledecky improved her semifinal time by a tenth of a second, but still finished more than a second and a half behind in fifth place.\n\n\u201cBloody exhausted,\u201d said Titmus, who will race Ledecky later this week in the 800 freestyle. \u201cThat was a hell of a tough one.\u201d\n\nIt was the second time Titmus has gotten the better of Ledecky at the Games after edging her in the neck-and-neck 400 freestyle Monday. In that race, at least, Ledecky recorded her best time in three years and the second fastest of her career, and sounded satisfied with the accomplishment, even if it earned silver instead of gold.\n\nLedecky\u2019s first six Olympic finals \u2014 spanning London, Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo as she transformed from a little-known teenager to one of the faces of the sport \u2014 ended on the podium.\n\nThis was the first miss.\n\n\u201cI knew I had to turn the page very quickly and in the warm-down pool I was just thinking of my family,\u201d Ledecky said. \u201cEach stroke I was thinking of my grandparents. They\u2019re the toughest four people I know and that\u2019s what helped me get through that.\u201d\n\nThe sting didn\u2019t last long. The 1,500 beckoned.

She won 10 Olympic medals, 7 of which were gold.\n\nLedecky made her first splash in international swimming after her freshman year at Stone Ridge School of the Sacred Heart in Bethesda, Maryland, when she set an Olympic-trials record in the 800-metre freestyle to qualify for the 2012 London Games as the youngest member of the U.S. Olympic swimming team. At the Games she set an American record en route to the gold medal in the 800 metres. The following year Ledecky set her first world records in the 800 metres (8 minutes 13.86 seconds) and 1,500 metres (15 minutes 36.53 seconds) at the 2013 F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Natation (FINA) world championships. In addition to the golds that she won in those two events, Ledecky earned a gold medal in the 400-metre freestyle and as a member of the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay team, and she won the FINA Trophy as the highest-scoring overall female swimmer at the world championships.\n\nBritannica Quiz Sports Quiz\n\nIn June 2014 Ledecky bettered her own records in the 800 metres (8 minutes 11 seconds) and the 1,500 metres (15 minutes 34.23 seconds), and at the U.S. national championships in early August she set a global standard in the 400-metre freestyle with a time of 3 minutes 58.86 seconds, thus becoming the first female swimmer since American Janet Evans to hold simultaneous world records for the 400-, 800-, and 1,500-metre distances. At the 2014 Pan Pacific Championships, Ledecky became the first woman to capture four individual golds in that competition by winning the 200-, 400-, 800-, and 1,500-metre freestyle events, and she claimed another gold in the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay. She also broke her own world marks in the 1,500 metres (15 minutes 28.36 seconds) and the 400 metres (3 minutes 58.37 seconds).\n\nThe 6-foot- (1.83-metre-) tall Ledecky continued her stellar performance at the 2015 FINA world championships. She captured gold medals in five events (the 200-, 400-, 800-, and 1,500-metre freestyle and the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay) and earned a place in history as the only person to have won four individual freestyle swimming distances in a single world championship or Olympic competition. She also set a world record three times\u2014in the 800-metre final (8 minutes 7.39 seconds) and twice in the 1,500 metres (15 minutes 27.71 seconds in the heats and then 15 minutes 25.48 seconds in the final).\n\nShe put on a dominant showing at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games, where she captured four gold medals (the 200-, 400-, and 800-metre freestyle and the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay) and one silver (4 \u00d7 100-metre freestyle relay). Moreover, she set world records in the 400- and 800-metre races (3 minutes 56.46 seconds and 8 minutes 4.79 seconds, respectively), and the 800-metre final saw Ledecky take almost two seconds off the record time as she finished more than 11 seconds faster than her nearest competitor.\n\nAt the 2017 world championships, Ledecky won five gold medals (the 400-, 800-, and 1,500-metre freestyle as well as the 4 \u00d7 100- and 4 \u00d7 200-metre freestyle). However, she suffered an unexpected loss in the 200 metres, having to settle for silver. At a meet in 2018, Ledecky bettered her previous world record in the 1,500 metres, finishing in 15 minutes 20.48 seconds. Later that year she competed at the Pan Pacific Championships, winning gold medals in the 400-, 800-, and 1,500-metre races. She also captured one silver (4 \u00d7 200-metre freestyle) and one bronze (200-metre freestyle). Illness limited her participation at the 2019 world championships, though she managed to win gold in the 800-metre freestyle and silver in both the 400 metres and the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay. She entered the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (which were actually held in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic) as one of the favourites, and she won the 800- and 1,500-metre freestyle; it was the first time that women had competed in the latter event at the Olympics. However, in the 400 metres she suffered her first loss in an individual race at the Games, finishing in second place. In addition, she won a silver in the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay.

She has already got enough on her Olympic plate.\n\n\"Katie is amazing,\" Schmitt said.\n\nIn other races on the fourth night of the trials, Zach Harting earned his first trip to the Olympics with a victory in the men's 200 butterfly, while Alex Walsh won a thrilling race in the women's 200 individual medley -- the top three were separated by just four-hundredths of a second.\n\nHarting, a 23-year-old from Huntsville, Alabama, won with a time of 1:55.06 after a restless night.\n\n\"I couldn't sleep last night, woke up before my alarm, heart pounding out of my chest, crazy adrenaline,\" he said. \"I wanted to puke all through warm-up, still kind of want to do that. I don't think I really handled it well, but I knew I was going to win so that kind of gave me a little bit of peace.\"\n\nHarting is already making plans to get the customary Olympic rings tattoo.\n\n\"Coming in here and not making the team was not an option,\" he said. \"I don't know if I could have handled it, so the easiest thing to do was make the team and that's what I did.\"\n\nGunnar Bentz, who was among the swimmers involved in Ryan Lochte's infamous night in Rio five years ago, touched after Harting in 1:55.34 and will get the expected second spot in the event.\n\nWalsh won in 2:09.30, followed by Kate Douglass at 2:09.32 and Madisyn Cox in 2:09.34.\n\nDouglass will get the expected second spot on the Olympic team, while Cox endured another heartbreak after finishing fourth in two events at the 2016 trials.\n\nWalsh and Douglass give the American team two more first-time Olympians.\n\n\"I'm in shock,\" Walsh said.\n\nEighteen-year-old Torri Huske, who already made the team in the 100 butterfly, got off to a blistering start in her signature stroke but couldn't hold on. She faded to fourth.\n\nLedecky is one of at least two swimmers the Americans are counting on to be big stars at these Olympics, the first since 1996 that won't include Phelps. He retired after Rio with a record 23 gold medals and 28 medals overall.\n\nThe other is Caeleb Dressel, who was top qualifier in the semifinals of the 100 free with a time of 47.77.\n\nNathan Adrian, an eight-time Olympic medalist who won the 100 free at the 2012 Olympics and captured a bronze in Rio, failed to even qualify for the final after finishing sixth in his heat and 13th overall at 48.92.\n\nAdrian, who overcame testicular cancer and is now married with a daughter, conceded that it was hard to maintain the sort of focus he needed at age 32.\n\n\"When I had a bad practice before, it was a little bit of a dagger in the heart. I would be very, very affected by that,\" he said. \"Now, I just want to go home and immediately give my wife and baby a hug and a kiss.\n\n\"In so many indescribable ways, this is such an all-in sport. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to stick two good swims out there.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/sports/olympics/katie-ledecky-1500m-time.html", "page_content": "Katie Ledecky won her first gold medal of the Tokyo Games on Wednesday, dominating the 1,500-meter freestyle, just as she was expected to.\n\nFor Ledecky, the 1,500 victory in 15 minutes 37.34 seconds capped off a busy morning at the Tokyo Aquatics Center.

But until this week, she hadn\u2019t had a chance to showcase what might be her best event on an Olympic stage, because the mile race wasn\u2019t part of the program for women. In part because Ledecky has been so captivating in that event, the Olympic committee added it for the Tokyo Games.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to compare Ledecky\u2019s success in this event to any other in swimming, let alone any other sport. At the 2017 world championships, she won the 1,500-meter race by 19.07 seconds over second-place Mireia Belmonte of Spain \u2014 her most lopsided win on a world stage. That margin was wider than the gap between Belmonte and the fifth-place finisher. Ledecky bested Belmonte by 1.27 seconds per 100 meters, except she did it over and over again, 15 straight times. For comparison, the margins of victory in the women\u2019s 100-meter freestyle race in the last four world championships were 0.39, 0.04, 0.18 and 0.55 seconds.\n\nIn 2018, when Ledecky broke her own world record at 15:20.48, the fastest time recorded by any other female swimmer in the world in the 1,500-meter was 15:51.61 by Italy\u2019s Simona Quadarella. On the men\u2019s side, with no swimmer of Ledecky\u2019s caliber, such deficits are unheard of. The two fastest men\u2019s 1,500-meter times in the world in 2018 were separated by 0.73 seconds.\n\nHow an Olympic climber manages her anxiety to get in the zone | FiveThirtyEight\n\nLedecky\u2019s margin of victory at the Olympics, where her gold medal time of 15:37.34 was best by 4.07 seconds, wasn\u2019t quite as large as her previous record-setting races. But though her two closest competitors in the final each finished with a time in the top 25 all-time, Ledecky\u2019s time was still faster than any other woman who\u2019s competed internationally in the event. She now has each of the 13 fastest 1,500-meter times in history. That Ledecky swam in the final on the same night as her appearance in the 200-meter freestyle made the feat even more impressive.\n\nLedecky swims alone most of the time Top 25 fastest times recorded in the women\u2019s 1,500-meter freestyle swim Rk Swimmer Country Year Time 1 Katie Ledecky United States 2018 15:20.48 2 Katie Ledecky United States 2015 15:25.48 3 Katie Ledecky United States 2015 15:27.71 4 Katie Ledecky United States 2014 15:28.36 5 Katie Ledecky United States 2020 15:29.51 6 Katie Ledecky United States 2017 15:31.82 7 Katie Ledecky United States 2014 15:34.23 7 Katie Ledecky United States 2014 15:34.23 9 Katie Ledecky United States 2021 15:35.35 10 Katie Ledecky United States 2017 15:35.65 11 Katie Ledecky United States 2019 15:35.98 12 Katie Ledecky United States 2013 15:36.53 13 Katie Ledecky United States 2021 15:37.34 14 Lotte Friis Denmark 2013 15:38.88 15 Katie Ledecky United States 2018 15:38.97 16 Lauren Boyle New Zealand 2015 15:40.14 17 Katie Ledecky United States 2021 15:40.50 18 Katie Ledecky United States 2021 15:40.55 19 Simona Quadarella Italy 2019 15:40.89 20 Erica Sullivan United States 2021 15:41.41 21 Jianjiahe Wang China 2021 15:41.49 22 Katie Ledecky United States 2015 15:42.23 23 Kate Ziegler United States 2007 15:42.54 24 Sarah K\u00f6hler Germany 2021 15:42.91 25 Katie Ledecky United States 2021 15:42.92 Bolded times were set in the final at the Tokyo Olympics. Source: FINA\n\nAfter her race, Ledecky said she was thinking of the American female swimmers who came before her, who blew away the competition but weren\u2019t allowed to swim the 1,500-meter race in the Olympics. The world record holder before Ledecky, fellow American Kate Ziegler, set it at 15:42.54 in June 2007. \u201cI would love for it to be an Olympic event,\u201d Ziegler said at the time, \u201cbut I don\u2019t have control over that.\u201d\n\nDecorated distance swimmer Janet Evans held the record before Ziegler, setting it in 1988 at 15:52.10. Evans draped the medal around Ledecky\u2019s neck after the 1,500-meter race at the U.S. Swim Trials last month. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bittersweet for me because it was my best race,\u201d Evans said that night. \u201cBut I just love it.\u201d Before Evans came Debbie Meyer, the only other woman to win the 200-meter, 400-meter and 800-meter freestyle races in one Olympics. She never had the opportunity to add the mile to that list.\n\nAs it often does, record-breaking star power has inspired an improvement in the competition. In the middle distances, Australia\u2019s Ariarne Titmus has won gold in the 200-meter and 400-meter freestyle races in Tokyo, citing Ledecky as the swimmer who set the standard. \u201cWithout her, I would in no way possible be swimming the way that I am now,\u201d Titmus told the Olympic Network last year. \u201cShe set this benchmark so high that people have been trying to chase.\u201d\n\nAnd in the 1,500-meter, Ledecky had a teammate on the podium next to her after Erica Sullivan won the silver medal in 15:41.41. The two swam in adjacent lanes and celebrated afterward; Sullivan later told NBC, \u201cHonestly, there was a point when I saw Katie ahead of me, and she was the only one, and it really gave me the energy, having someone you look up to for years and seeing them a few meters \u2014\u201d and then she stopped herself. \u201cOr, several meters in front of you. And using it to get home.\u201d\n\nHow to watch surfing like an Olympic judge | FiveThirtyEight\n\nHow to watch skateboarding like an Olympic judge | FiveThirtyEight"}]}
