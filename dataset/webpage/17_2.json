She died in 1986 at age 26 of AIDS-related complications, at just 26 years old.\n\nMila Kunis also appeared in Gia as a younger version of Carangi, in one of her first-ever film roles, while additional cast members included Faye Dunaway, Mercedes Ruehl, Elizabeth Mitchell and Scott Cohen.\n\nDirected by Michael Cristofer (Mr. Robot) and co-written by Cristofer, 78, and Jay McInerney, Gia is about \"the life of Gia Carangi, a top fashion model from the late 1970s, from her meteoric rise to the forefront of the modeling industry, to her untimely death,\" according to a synopsis from IMDb.\n\nRead on to learn more about Carangi, from her early life to her tragic death.\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human-interest stories.\n\nGia Carangi. Andrea Blanch/Getty\n\nCarangi was born Gia Marie Carangi in Philadelphia on Jan. 29, 1960, into a working-class family that included two older brothers. Her father Joseph Carangi, who was Italian, owned a restaurant, while her mother, Kathleen Carangi (n\u00e9e Adams), was a homemaker.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Carangi was discovered on the dance floor by a local photographer. Her first modeling gig for a major advertisement was with Versace, and she had become a well-known figure at Wilhelmina Models in New York City by 1980, according to The New York Times.\n\nBut throughout her catapult to fame, Carangi \u2014 who was one of the first openly gay models, Dazed reported \u2014 struggled with addiction and substance abuse, including of cocaine and heroin.\n\nBack in 2020, makeup artist Sandy Linter recalled to The Hollywood Reporter that she and Carangi had a romance in the late 1970s that \"was never a torrid sexual affair but we did love each other.\"\n\n\"I was just as shocked as anybody that she became an addict,\" Linter said. \"She thought she was stronger than the drugs. One morning, as she was getting dressed to leave my apartment she asked, 'What happened to my natural energy?' She didn't have the energy to get dressed at 20 years old. The drugs took everything.\"\n\nGia Carangi. Dustin Pittman/WWD/Penske Media via Getty\n\nAccording to Dazed, Carangi attempted several times to get clean, including going to rehab, but it never stuck. She was diagnosed with AIDS in December 1985, and died of related complications the following November.\n\nLinter told THR that the last time she saw Carangi was in 1983 or 1984, when the model rang her doorbell, then \"sat down on my couch with me, put her head on my shoulder and cried.\"\n\n\"It was the end of our 'romance.' I knew it and she knew it. Because she looked so good, I had been tricked into thinking that she was on the road to recovery,\" Linter said. \"I never knew she had AIDS until later. After maybe 30 minutes, she looked out the window, nodded to someone in the street and left. I would never see her again.\"\n\nMore than 35 years after Carangi's death, Gia is still beloved by fans, holding a Rotten Tomatoes score of 93%, with an Audience Score of 82%.\n\nAhead of the movie's release, Jolie, now 47, told The New York Times in 1997 that she initially \"hated\" Carangi while doing research about her, based on a 20/20 interview the model once did \u2014 but eventually changed her tune and thought, \"I'd like to date Gia. I'd want to be her lover.''\n\nAngelina Jolie (center) in Gia (1998). Larry Watson/Citadel Ent/Kobal/Shutterstock\n\nThe actress also told Entertainment Weekly at the time of her role that she \"definitely needed to learn the lessons Gia needed to learn.\"\n\n\"Especially feeling that the physical is more important than anything else, or that you're only as smart and good as somebody thinks you are,\" she said. \"It's been really important for me to look at myself in the mirror, and realize that I can't let myself go down like she did.\"\n\nJolie \u2014 who went on to win an Oscar for her performances in the following year's Girl, Interrupted alongside Winona Ryder \u2014 also said she wanted the audience \"to identify with Gia and see her as being just a regular girl.\"\n\n\"No matter how together or perfect some people may appear, they have their share of pain and a deep-down need for love \u2014 the same as everyone else,\" the actress added."}, {"url": "https://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/41317/1/the-story-of-gia-the-world-s-first-supermodel-who-died-of-aids-at-26", "page_content": "Starring Angelina Jolie in the title role, the movie documenting Gia Carangi\u2019s tragic life turns 20 this year\n\nText Sabrina Cooper\n\nBefore Peter Lindbergh immortalised Naomi, Cindy, Claudia, Linda, Christy, and Tatjana on the cover of Vogue in 1990, and launched them in their ascension to icon status, there was Gia. Arguably the world\u2019s first supermodel, Gia Carangi paved the way for Campbell, Turlington, and Crawford \u2013 with the latter billed \u2018Baby Gia\u2019 when she made her runway debut. Gia\u2019s life echoed the classic rags-to-riches story, only, eventually, the riches made way for rags again. While her blue-collar background gave her an edge in the world of high fashion, and appearances on the runways of Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, Calvin Klein, and Armani saw her experience a meteoric rise to fame, behind the scenes all was not well. Struggling to cope with the pressures of her new career, Gia turned to heroin, and, despite kicking the habit a number of times and staging multiple comebacks, in 1986 she died of Aids-related complications at just 26. Twelve years after her death, Gia\u2019s tragic story was committed to a film, with a young, almost unknown Angelina Jolie taking on the role of the troubled model. Her portrayal won her a Golden Globe, as she appeared alongside Hollywood heavyweights Faye Dunaway, who played modelling mogul Wilhelmina Cooper, and Mercedes Ruehl who played her mum, Kathleen. Jolie played Gia with raw emotion throughout, exploring her drug addiction, childhood issues, and relationships with unfaltering sensitivity \u2013 having spent hours studying Gia\u2019s TV appearances before filming began. In one, Gia was interviewed on an evening news show about the dark side of modelling and its ties to drugs. She was supposed to be the \u2018bad model turned good\u2019, but shortly before her slot, Gia snorted heroin backstage. Jolie admitted that she despised Gia at first, but in the end, confessed to The New York Times in 1997: \u201cI\u2019d like to date Gia. I\u2019d want to be her lover.\u201d Now, as the film turns 20, we look back at Gia\u2019s dramatic and ultimately tragic life.\n\nSHE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST OPENLY GAY MODELS Growing up working class in Philadelphia, Gia was a member of the \u2018Bowie Kids\u2019 in high school \u2013 a group of die hard fans who went to his concerts and adopted his unique blend of androgynous dressing as their own. Gia cut her hair short and dyed it bold colours, and shopped at vintage and second hand clothing stores, where she picked up men\u2019s button-down shirts, distressed Levi\u2019s 501s, and beaten-up leather boots. As one of the first openly gay models, she often visited DCA, a gay club in the city where, she met one of her first long-term partners: Sharon Beverley. Though Gia had a few trysts with men, she identified as a lesbian. In the film, one of her friends asks if she\u2019s ever had sex with a man before. The model responds: \u201cYeah once. And I could have done that with a German Shepherd.\u201d\n\nSHE WAS THE ANTITHESIS OF OTHER MODELS OF THE ERA Gia initially got her start with a local photographer in Philadelphia who saw her dancing, and began appearing in local newspaper advertisements, before heading to New York at 17. When she arrived in the city, Gia met with Wilhelmina Cooper, who was floored and signed her immediately. Gia embodied the contrast that the fashion industry craved during that era \u2013 in a sea of blonde, blue-eyed, beautiful women, Gia had no filter, wore no make-up and took risks. One of her first shoots saw her pose nude behind a chain-link fence with make-up artist Sandy Linter for photographer Chris von Wangenheim. The shoot was her breakout moment, and led to her modelling for labels including Versace and Dior, and legendary photographers like Helmut Newton and Arthur Elgort. She also starred in an iconic music video, for Blondie\u2019s 1980 hit \u201cAtomic\u201d. \u201cWhen she was free and just being herself, Gia was unbelievable. That\u2019s the tragedy of her story. You think, God, she didn't need drugs \u2013 she was a drug\u201d \u2013 Angelina Jolie WHEN WILHELMINA DIED, SHE WENT OFF THE RAILS Cooper became a mother figure to Gia, whose own mum abandoned her when she was just 11, so when she died in 1980 the model was devastated. Though she often did cocaine in the bathroom stalls of Studio 54 and CBGB, Gia\u2019s drug habit began spiralling. The drug trend at that time shifted to heroin, which brought coke users down when they were too high. Usually Gia snorted heroin, with the common understanding that people could only get addicted through needles \u2013 which was false. A generation of accidental junkies was born, of which Gia was a part. Anita Sarka, a DJ from former downtown NYC institution Mudd Club and friend of Gia told Vanity Fair: \u201cIn those days, everyone had this idea that being a junkie was very glamorous.\u201d\n\n...AND WAS SOON OUT OF WORK Gia eventually started injecting and her habit became so bad that in one of her appointment books, she wrote (and misspelt) \u2018Get Heroine\u2019. Soon after, the track marks on her arms started showing in photos and only one photographer, Francesco Scavullo, requested her for work. During a particularly painful scene in Gia, Scavullo\u2019s stylist says out loud, \u201cWhat about that awful thing on her hand? It looks like a volcano,\u201d while pointing at an abscess. Unsurprisingly, Gia\u2019s career tanked. She garnered notoriety for scandalous stories like shooting up heroin in bathrooms during breaks, and on a Versace shoot with Richard Avedon she told everyone she was going out for cigarettes and never returned."}, {"url": "https://allthatsinteresting.com/gia-carangi", "page_content": "After moving to New York in 1977, Gia Carangi became one of the most sought-after models in fashion and a fixture of Studio 54 \u2014 but her life quickly unraveled.\n\nOn the surface, Gia Carangi seemed to have it all. In the late 70s and 80s, Carangi owned the spotlight and had droves of adoring fans.\n\nIt\u2019s said that she added the \u201csuper\u201d in supermodel to describe how exponentially successful she had been in her career. Known for an edgy personality and a smoldering stare, the world was Carangi\u2019s catwalk.\n\nBut the very attitude and wild side of America\u2019s first supermodel which made Gia Carangi so desirable also made her a great danger to herself. This would be her undoing.\n\nGia Carangi\u2019s Early Life\n\nGia Marie Carangi was born on January 29, 1960, in Philadelphia to an Italian-American father, Joseph, who owned a tiny restaurant called Hoagie City. Her mother, Kathleen Carangi, was a homemaker.\n\nCarangi\u2019s parents separated in 1971. Those close to Carangi, including herself, have admitted that this divorce had a lasting impact on her attitude.\n\nHer two brothers, both older than her, moved out and lived with their mom while Carangi stayed with her father. She spent her summers behind his counter, attending concerts like your run-of-the-mill high schooler.\n\nIt was in the summer of 1978 that a local photographer and hairdresser, Maurice Tannenbaum, asked the dark-haired beauty to pose on the dance floor after spotting her at a local nightclub. Carangi\u2019s dark, tomboyish looks, 34-24-35 measurements, and perfect face were an ideal match for the fashion world which at the time was overrun with willowy blondes.\n\nTannenbaum passed on Carangi\u2019s photos to legendary New York department store Bloomingdale\u2019s photographer, Arthur Elgort. Before Carangi knew it, she was the talk of New York.\n\n\u201cI started working with very good people,\u201d Gia Carangi confided in a 1983 interview. \u201cI mean all the time, very fast. I didn\u2019t build into a model. I just sort of became one.\u201d\n\nA Meteoric Rise To Fame\n\nGia Carangi\u2019s first photoshoot at the Philadelphia nightclub, back when she was just 16, was the beginning of her meteoric rise to stardom, and life only moved faster once she moved to New York.\n\nCarangi signed with Wilhelmina Cooper, a legendary fashion agent and owner of her own modeling agency. Wilhelmina became a kind of mother figure to Carangi.\n\nFrancesco Scavullo, a leading fashion photographer of the day and who would become a personal friend of Carangi\u2019s, gushed of her:\n\n\u201cThere was something she had\u2026 no other girl has got it. I\u2019ve never met a girl who had it. She had the perfect body for modeling: perfect eyes, mouth, hair. And, to me, the perfect attitude: \u2018I don\u2019t give a damn.'\u201d\n\nThat attitude proved to be both what was so enticing and dangerous about Carangi.\n\nHer androgynous look was in part due to her sexuality. Described in some instances as aggressive and others as vulnerable, Carangi seemed to have a need to be loved \u2014 and mostly by women.\n\nThose who had worked with her said it wasn\u2019t uncommon for her to fall in love with the models she shot with. On a shoot for photographer Chris von Wangenheim, which would become wildly popular, Carangi posed nude up against a fence with makeup artist and model Sandy Linter.\n\nThe two would embark on a passionate though unrequited love affair.\n\nIndeed, Gia Carangi appeared insatiable both in her love life and in her recreational drug use. As a teen, she was already hooked on marijuana, cocaine, and quaaludes.\n\nCarangi went on to model for Christian Dior, Giorgio Armani, Versace, Diane Von Furstenberg, Cutex, Lancetti, Levi\u2019s, Maybelline, Vidal-Sassoon, and Yves Saint Laurent \u2014 to name a few. At the age of 18, Carangi was making $100,000 a year. It was more than any other model at the time, leading many fashion historians to dub her the world\u2019s first supermodel.\n\nShe then landed on the covers of Vogue and Cosmo starting in 1979.\n\n\u201cA model has to create moods,\u201d Carangi said of her talent, \u201cYou have to be careful not to get stuck in a mood \u2013 emotions have trends just like fashion \u2026 I become what ever your eye wants to see. It\u2019s my job.\u201d\n\nBut Gia Carangi remained hard to control. Though it was her edgy attitude that drew people to her, Carangi was also tough to work with. A diva by age 18, she would walk off shoots if she wasn\u2019t feeling it, or would cancel weeks of work if she didn\u2019t like her haircut.\n\nCarangi would chow down on barbecue chicken while wearing a dress worth thousands of dollars. She was also transparent about her drug use, discussing it openly in interviews and partying often with other stars and socialites at Studio 54.\n\nBut there was also a deep loneliness in her, returning to her apartment alone after work, and constantly searching for love. \u201cI am finally really starting to dig being different. Maybe I am discovering who I am. Or maybe I\u2019m just stoned again,\u201d she admitted.\n\nGia Carangi Backslides Into Drugs\n\nThe supermodel would go from a $10,000 photo shoot to a \u201cshooting gallery\u201d, or seedy locale where one can shoot up heroin, on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side.\n\nIn 1980, Wilhelmina died and sent Carangi into a spiral. Already using heroin, the supermodel delved deeper into her habit. During a shoot that year for Vogue with famed portrait photographer Richard Avedon, Carangi escaped through a window. Though incensed, the magazine gave her a second chance at the shoot, but when the pictures came back they revealed track marks and red bumps all over the model\u2019s arms.\n\nIn 1981, she was arrested for driving under the influence of a narcotic.\n\nIn May of that same year, 21-year-old Carangi needed to get hand surgery because \u201cshe had injected herself in the same place so many times that there was an open infected tunnel leading into her vein,\u201d her biographer Stephen Fried documented.\n\nFor her final Cosmo cover photo in early 1982, fashion photographer Scavullo covered up the track marks on her arms by having her put her hands behind her back. The dress she wore was poofy enough to cover up the scars of her habit. The model also angled her face to cover up the bloating.\n\nHer brother, Michael, recalled his little sister\u2019s behavior and laments: \u201cThe biggest mistake we made was that nobody went up there with her. She could\u2019ve used a friend.\u201d\n\nGia Carangi left her modeling agency, tried to stay afloat at another, but wound up returning home to Philadelphia to live with her mother at a final grasp at finding sobriety.\n\nAn Untimely Demise\n\nGia Carangi was blackballed from New York\u2019s agencies and although magazines gave her several last chances, the model could not pull herself together. One of her final shoots appeared in Vogue in 1982 and was photographed by Andrea Blanch.\n\nBy the end of that year, Carangi had become so volatile that she couldn\u2019t get booked for jobs. No one wanted to work with the wild child any longer.\n\nShe had a successful go at rehab for about a year following in Philadelphia. By this time she was broke and receiving rehabilitation from welfare.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9npRKUAeQZI\n\nMeanwhile, model Cindy Crawford came on the scene as a newer, more put together version of Gia. Crawford admitted to Playboy that many of her jobs came from those who loved Carangi and were hoping to replace her.\n\nIn the fall of 1986, Carangi was hospitalized. It became apparent that she had been sleeping outside in the rain and had been badly beaten up and raped. Blood tests showed she was suffering from AIDS-related complications.\n\nOn November 26, 1986, America\u2019s first supermodel died of those complications, though her mother was by her side.\n\nCarangi\u2019s meteoric and tumultuous career were immortalized in the HBO movie Gia that starred Angelina Jolie nearly a decade later in 1998. Jolie said of the model herself after portraying her, \u201cYou think, \u2018God, she didn\u2019t need drugs \u2014 she was a drug.'\u201d\n\nCarangi seemed to be somewhat cognizant of her brilliant, though short, career. She said forebodingly in an interview before her demise: \u201cModeling is a short gig.\u201d\n\nAfter this look at Gia Carangi, read about who some believe was America\u2019s first \u201cit\u201d girl, Audrey Munson.

In 1986, at age 26, she died of AIDS-related complications. Believed to have contracted it from a contaminated needle, she became one of the first famous women to die of the disease.[2] Her life was dramatized in the 1998 HBO television film Gia, directed by Michael Cristofer and starring Angelina Jolie as Carangi.\n\nYouTube Encyclopedic\n\n1 / 2 Views: 18 763 16 144\n\nGorgeous Fashion of Tragic Model- Gia Marie Carangi/ Late70s- Early 80s Fashion!\u2764\ufe0f\n\nJudging Models | Gia (1998) Transcription\n\nEarly life and education\n\nCarangi was born on January 29, 1960, in Philadelphia, the third and youngest child of Joseph Carangi, a restaurant owner, and Kathleen Carangi (n\u00e9e Adams), a homemaker. She had two older brothers. Her father was Italian, and her mother was of Irish and Welsh ancestry. Joseph and Kathleen had an unstable, violent marriage, ultimately leading Kathleen to abandon the family when Carangi was eleven years old.[3] Gia was described as \"needy and manipulative\" by relatives who recalled her as spoiled and shy as a child and a \"mommy's girl\" who did not receive the motherly attention that she desired.[3] Those who knew Gia blamed her \"fractured childhood\" for the instability and drug dependence that plagued her adult life.[3]\n\nIn her adolescent years, Carangi found the attention she sought from other teenage girls, befriending them by sending flowers.[3] While attending Abraham Lincoln High School, Carangi bonded with \"the Bowie kids\", a group of obsessive David Bowie fans who emulated Bowie's \"defiantly weird, high-glam\" style.[3] Carangi was drawn to Bowie for his fashion preferences and his ambiguous gender play and outspoken bisexuality.[3] One of Carangi's friends later spoke of her \"tomboy persona\", describing her relaxed openness about her sexuality as reminiscent of the character Cay in the 1985 film Desert Hearts.[3] Carangi and her \"bi-try Bowie-mad\" friends hung out in Philadelphia's gay clubs and bars. Though she's associated with the lesbian community, she did not want to take up \"the accepted lesbian style.\"[3]\n\nCareer\n\nAfter being featured in Philadelphia newspaper ads and being discovered by Sondra Scerca in Maurice Tannenbaum's hair salon,[5] Carangi moved to New York City at the age of 17, where she signed with Wilhelmina Models.[6] Her first major shoot, published in October 1978, was with top fashion photographer Chris von Wangenheim, who had her pose nude behind a chain-link fence with makeup artist Sandy Linter. Carangi immediately became infatuated with Linter and pursued her, though the relationship never became stable.[7] By the end of 1978, her first year in New York, Carangi was already a well-established model. Of her quick rise to prominence, described by Vogue as \"meteoric\",[6] Carangi later said, \"I started working with very good people, I mean all the time, very fast. I didn't build into a model, I just sort of became one.\"[8]\n\nCarangi was a favorite model of various fashion photographers, including Von Wangenheim, Francesco Scavullo, Arthur Elgort, Richard Avedon, and Denis Piel. Well-integrated within the fashion world, she had the selection of several photographers, most notably Scavullo.[9] Carangi was featured on the cover of many fashion magazines, including the April 1979 issue of British Vogue, the April 1979 and August 1980 issues of Vogue Paris, the August 1980 issue of American Vogue, the February 1981 issue of Vogue Italia, and multiple issues of Cosmopolitan between 1979 and 1982.[4] During these years, she also appeared in various advertising campaigns for high-profile fashion houses, including Armani, Andr\u00e9 Laug, Christian Dior, Versace, and Yves Saint Laurent.[4] At the height of her career, Carangi was most known in modeling circles by only her first name.[3] During this time, she also appeared in the Blondie music video for \"Atomic\".[10][11]\n\nA regular at Studio 54 and the Mudd Club,[12] Carangi usually used cocaine in clubs.[13] After her agent, mentor, and friend Wilhelmina Cooper, died of lung cancer in March 1980, a devastated Carangi began using drugs and developed an addiction to heroin.[13][14] Carangi's addiction soon began to affect her work; she had violent temper tantrums, walked out of photo shoots to buy drugs, and fell asleep in front of the camera. Scavullo recalled a fashion shoot with Carangi in the Caribbean when \"she was crying, she couldn't find her drugs. I literally had to lay her down on her bed until she fell asleep.\"[15] During one of her final location shoots for American Vogue, Carangi had red bumps in the crooks of her elbows where she had injected heroin. Despite airbrushing, some of the photos, as published in the November 1980 issue, reportedly still showed visible needle marks.[16]\n\nIn November 1980, Carangi left Wilhelmina Models and signed with Ford Models, but she was dropped within weeks. By then, her career was in a steep decline. Modeling offers soon ceased and her fashion industry friends, including Sandy Linter, refused to speak to her, fearing their association with her would harm their careers. In an attempt to quit using drugs, she moved back to Philadelphia with her mother and stepfather in February 1981. Carangi underwent a 21-day detox program, but her sobriety was short-lived. She was arrested in March 1981 after she drove into a fence in a suburban neighborhood. After a chase with police, she was taken into custody where it was later determined she was under the influence of alcohol and cocaine. After her release, Carangi briefly signed with a new agency, Legends, and worked sporadically, mainly in Europe.\n\nIn late 1981, although still using drugs, Carangi was determined to make a comeback in the fashion industry and signed with Elite Model Management. While some clients refused to work with her, others were willing to hire her because of her past status as a top model. Scavullo photographed her for the April 1982 cover of Cosmopolitan, her last cover appearance for an American magazine.[3][4] Sean Byrnes, Scavullo's long-time assistant, later said, \"What she was doing to herself finally became apparent in her pictures. ... I could see the change in her beauty. There was an emptiness in her eyes.\"\n\nCarangi then mainly worked with photographer Albert Watson and found work modeling for department stores and catalogs. She appeared in an advertising campaign for Versace, shot by Richard Avedon. He hired her for the fashion house's next campaign, but during the photo shoot, in late 1982, Carangi became uncomfortable and left before any usable shots of her were taken. Around this time, Carangi enrolled in an outpatient methadone program but soon began using heroin again. By the end of 1982, she had only a few clients that were willing to hire her. Carangi's final photo shoot was for German mail-order clothing company Otto GmbH in Tunisia; she was sent home during the shoot for using heroin. She left New York for the final time in early 1983.\n\nDeath\n\nCarangi spent most of her modeling earnings on drugs, and spent the final three years of her life with various lovers, friends, and family members in Philadelphia and Atlantic City. She was admitted to an intense drug treatment program at Eagleville Hospital in December 1984. After treatment, she got a job in a clothing store, which she eventually quit. She later found employment as a checkout clerk and then worked in the cafeteria of a nursing home. By late 1985, she had begun using drugs again and was engaging in sex work in Atlantic City.\n\nIn December 1985, Carangi was admitted to Warminster General Hospital in Warminster, Pennsylvania, with bilateral pneumonia. A few days later, she was diagnosed with AIDS-related complex. In the fall of 1986, Carangi was hospitalized again, after being found on the street badly beaten and raped.[30] On October 18, she was admitted to Hahnemann University Hospital in Center City Philadelphia. Carangi died at the Hahnemann Hospital of AIDS-related complications one month later, on November 18, 1986, at the age of 26, becoming one of the first famous women to die of the disease.[2] Her funeral was held on November 23 at a small funeral home in Philadelphia. No one from the fashion world attended.[3] However, weeks later, Francesco Scavullo, Carangi's friend and confidant, sent a Mass card when he heard the news.\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm Year Film Role Notes 2003 The Self-Destruction of Gia Self Archive footage, posthumously release Television Year Title Role Notes 2009-2011 20 to 1 Self Archive footage, posthumously release, episode: Sizzling Superstars, Adults Only 20 to 1: Sizzling Supermodels Music video Year Title Role Artists 1980 Blonde: Atomic girl with goggles Blondie\n\nLegacy\n\nCarangi is often considered to be the first supermodel,[2][3] although that title has been applied to others, including Margaux Hemingway, Audrey Munson,[34][35] Lisa Fonssagrives,[36][37] Dorian Leigh,[38] Twiggy, Jean Shrimpton,[39] Cheryl Tiegs and Janice Dickinson.[40] Model Cindy Crawford, who rose to prominence the year Carangi died, was referred to as \"Baby Gia\" because of her resemblance to Carangi.[41] Crawford later recalled, \"My agents took me to all the photographers who liked Gia: Albert Watson, Francesco Scavullo, Bill King. Everyone loved her look so much that they gladly saw me.\"[6] Additionally, Carangi, whose sexual orientation has been reported as either lesbian or bisexual, is considered a lesbian icon and is said to have \"epitomized lesbian chic more than a decade before the term was coined.\"[3][7] Argentine model Mica Arga\u00f1araz has often been compared to Carangi, whom she considers a beauty icon.[42][43]\n\nCarangi's life has been the subject of several works. A biography of Carangi by Stephen Fried titled Thing of Beauty\u2014taken from the first line of John Keats' famous poem Endymion\u2014was published in 1993. Gia, a biographical television film starring Angelina Jolie, debuted on HBO in 1998. Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance, among other accolades. A documentary titled The Self-Destruction of Gia, released in 2003, showcased footage of Carangi, contemporary interviews with Carangi's family and former colleagues, including Sandy Linter, and footage of actress-screenwriter Zo\u00eb Lund, herself a heroin addict, who had been commissioned to write a screenplay based upon Carangi's life at the time of her own death of drug-related causes in 1999.[44][45]\n\nA biography of Carangi by Sacha Lanvin Baumann titled Born This Way: Friends, Colleagues, and Coworkers Recall Gia Carangi, the Supermodel Who Defined an Era, was published in 2015. Sondra Scerca, who brought Carangi to Wilhelmina, is currently writing a memoir titled GIA, WILLY and ME, which will be released in 2022. The AIDS Memorial Quilt contains one panel with Carangi's full name on it that only commemorates her, one panel that refers to her as Gia that only commemorates her, and one panel that refers to her as Gia and commemorates other people as well as her.[46]\n\nDesigners and brands represented\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://tomaswhitehouse.com/gia-marie-carangi-last-photo-shoot/", "page_content": "On December 18, 1980, Gia Marie Carangi posed for her last photo shoot before her death from AIDS-related complications on January 18, 1986.\n\nCarangi was born on November 29, 1960, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was a top model in the 1970s and early 1980s, appearing on the covers of magazines such as \u201cVogue\u201d, \u201cElle\u201d, and \u201cGQ\u201d.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Carangi began using drugs and developed a heroin addiction. In October 1986, she was diagnosed with AIDS. She died from the disease on January 18, 1986.\n\nCarangi\u2019s last photo shoot was taken on December 18, 1980, a few months before she was diagnosed with AIDS. The photos, which were subsequently published in the book \u201cGia\u201d, showed Carangi in a weakened state, and some have argued that the images were exploitative.\n\nDespite her struggles with addiction and AIDS, Carangi is remembered as one of the most beautiful and iconic models of her time.\n\nWho photographed Gia Carangi?\n\nWho photographed Gia Carangi? This is a question that has puzzled many people over the years. There are many theories out there, but no one knows for sure.\n\nThere are a few photographers who were close to Gia during her life. These include Norman Seeff, Mick Rock, and Chris Von Wangenheim. Von Wangenheim was the first photographer to shoot Gia, and he did so in 1978. However, there is some speculation that he may not have actually taken the photograph.\n\nRock was Gia\u2019s personal photographer, and he took many of the iconic images of her that are still remembered today. He photographed her extensively in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Seeff was also a friend of Gia\u2019s, and he photographed her in 1983, just a few months before she died.\n\nSo, who took the photograph of Gia that is so widely recognized? No one knows for sure. It is possible that it was taken by one of the photographers mentioned above, or it could have been taken by someone else entirely. The mystery continues to this day.\n\nWhere is Gia Carangi buried?\n\nWhere is Gia Carangi buried?\n\nGia Carangi was a supermodel in the late 1970s and early 1980s. She was considered one of the most beautiful women in the world. However, she had a troubled life and died from a heroin overdose at the age of 26. Her body was buried in an unmarked grave in Pennsylvania.\n\nCarangi was born in Philadelphia in 1960. She started modeling at the age of 16 and quickly became one of the most successful supermodels in the world. She was known for her striking good looks and her wild lifestyle. However, she also had a reputation for being difficult to work with.\n\nIn 1986, Carangi was diagnosed with HIV. She was one of the first celebrities to be publicly diagnosed with the virus. She continued to model, but her health began to decline and she eventually became addicted to heroin.\n\nIn November 1986, Carangi was found dead in her hotel room in Miami. She was 26 years old. An autopsy found that she had died from a heroin overdose.\n\nCarangi\u2019s body was flown back to Philadelphia and she was buried in an unmarked grave at Torresdale Cemetery. Her death was a shock to the modeling world and she was mourned by many of her friends and colleagues.\n\nThere is no official headstone or marker at Carangi\u2019s grave. However, a group of her friends and fans have erected a small plaque at the site.\n\nCarangi\u2019s life was short but she left a lasting impression on the world of fashion. She is considered to be one of the most beautiful women of all time and her legacy continues to be celebrated to this day.\n\nWhat drug was Gia Carangi addicted to?\n\nWhat drug was Gia Carangi addicted to?\n\nGia Carangi was addicted to heroin.\n\nHow did heroin affect Gia Carangi?\n\nHeroin caused Gia Carangi to feel euphoric and relaxed. It also caused her to lose weight and look gaunt.\n\nHow did Gia Carangi get addicted to drugs?\n\nHow did Gia Carangi get addicted to drugs?\n\nGia Carangi was born on January 29, 1960, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was a top model in the 1970s and was the first supermodel. She was known for her high-fashion look and her addiction to drugs.\n\nCarangi started using drugs in the late 1970s. She was addicted to heroin and cocaine. She would often use drugs before going to work. This caused her to miss assignments and to have problems with her agents.\n\nIn 1980, Carangi was diagnosed with AIDS. She was one of the first people in the world to be diagnosed with the disease. She died from AIDS on November 18, 1986, at the age of 26.\n\nThere is no one answer to the question of how Carangi became addicted to drugs. Some people may say that she was born with a predisposition to addiction. Others may say that she started using drugs as a way to cope with the stress of being a top model.\n\nWhatever the reason, it is clear that Carangi\u2019s addiction to drugs led to her downfall. She was unable to work due to her drug addiction and she eventually died from AIDS.\n\nWhy did Gia\u2019s skin fall off?\n\nIn late November 2017, a disturbing video of a young girl\u2019s skin peeling off her body went viral. The girl in the video is identified as Gia, and the cause of her skin peeling is still unknown.\n\nSince the video was published, there have been many theories about what could have caused Gia\u2019s skin to fall off. Some people believe that the girl may have been infected with a virus, while others think that she may have been poisoned.\n\nSo far, there is no definitive answer as to what caused Gia\u2019s skin to peel off. However, her family has set up a GoFundMe page to help cover her medical expenses. As of the time of this writing, the page has raised over $24,000.\n\nIf you would like to donate to Gia\u2019s medical fund, you can do so here:\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/help-gia-with-medical-expenses\n\nDid Gia have BPD?\n\nThere is no certain answer to the question of whether Gia Carangi had Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), but there are some signs that suggest she may have. People with BPD often have a history of unstable relationships, chaotic emotions, and impulsive behavior.\n\nGia was known for her volatile and tumultuous relationships with both men and women. Her breakups were often very public and messy, and she would often lash out at those around her. She also experienced intense emotions, and could go from feeling very happy to very sad in a very short period of time. Gia was also known for her impulsive behavior, which could include drug use, reckless spending, and unsafe sex.\n\nWhile there is no definite way to know whether Gia had BPD, there are some clues that suggest she may have. If you are concerned that you or someone you know may have BPD, it is important to seek professional help.\n\nDid Gia Carangi carry a knife?\n\nThere is no definitive answer to whether or not Gia Carangi carried a knife. Some reports claim that she did, while others maintain that she did not. If she did, it is not clear what purpose the knife served.\n\nThere is no evidence that Carangi ever used the knife in a violent manner. Some suggest that she may have carried it for protection, while others believe that she may have used it for self-harm.\n\nCarangi was a troubled woman who battled addiction and mental health issues throughout her life. It is possible that she carried the knife as a means of self-protection, in case she ever felt unsafe or threatened.\n\nIt is also possible that Carangi used the knife to harm herself. She was known to engage in self-destructive behaviors, and it is conceivable that she turned to the knife as a way to inflict pain on herself.\n\nUltimately, it is impossible to know for certain what Carangi\u2019s intentions were. It is possible that she carried the knife for protection, or that she used it to harm herself. Only she knows the answer to that question."}], "Gia Marie Carangi was 26 years old at the time of her death.": [{"url": "https://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/41317/1/the-story-of-gia-the-world-s-first-supermodel-who-died-of-aids-at-26", "page_content": "Starring Angelina Jolie in the title role, the movie documenting Gia Carangi\u2019s tragic life turns 20 this year\n\nText Sabrina Cooper\n\nBefore Peter Lindbergh immortalised Naomi, Cindy, Claudia, Linda, Christy, and Tatjana on the cover of Vogue in 1990, and launched them in their ascension to icon status, there was Gia. Arguably the world\u2019s first supermodel, Gia Carangi paved the way for Campbell, Turlington, and Crawford \u2013 with the latter billed \u2018Baby Gia\u2019 when she made her runway debut. Gia\u2019s life echoed the classic rags-to-riches story, only, eventually, the riches made way for rags again. While her blue-collar background gave her an edge in the world of high fashion, and appearances on the runways of Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, Calvin Klein, and Armani saw her experience a meteoric rise to fame, behind the scenes all was not well. Struggling to cope with the pressures of her new career, Gia turned to heroin, and, despite kicking the habit a number of times and staging multiple comebacks, in 1986 she died of Aids-related complications at just 26. Twelve years after her death, Gia\u2019s tragic story was committed to a film, with a young, almost unknown Angelina Jolie taking on the role of the troubled model. Her portrayal won her a Golden Globe, as she appeared alongside Hollywood heavyweights Faye Dunaway, who played modelling mogul Wilhelmina Cooper, and Mercedes Ruehl who played her mum, Kathleen. Jolie played Gia with raw emotion throughout, exploring her drug addiction, childhood issues, and relationships with unfaltering sensitivity \u2013 having spent hours studying Gia\u2019s TV appearances before filming began. In one, Gia was interviewed on an evening news show about the dark side of modelling and its ties to drugs. She was supposed to be the \u2018bad model turned good\u2019, but shortly before her slot, Gia snorted heroin backstage. Jolie admitted that she despised Gia at first, but in the end, confessed to The New York Times in 1997: \u201cI\u2019d like to date Gia. I\u2019d want to be her lover.\u201d Now, as the film turns 20, we look back at Gia\u2019s dramatic and ultimately tragic life.\n\nSHE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST OPENLY GAY MODELS Growing up working class in Philadelphia, Gia was a member of the \u2018Bowie Kids\u2019 in high school \u2013 a group of die hard fans who went to his concerts and adopted his unique blend of androgynous dressing as their own. Gia cut her hair short and dyed it bold colours, and shopped at vintage and second hand clothing stores, where she picked up men\u2019s button-down shirts, distressed Levi\u2019s 501s, and beaten-up leather boots. As one of the first openly gay models, she often visited DCA, a gay club in the city where, she met one of her first long-term partners: Sharon Beverley. Though Gia had a few trysts with men, she identified as a lesbian. In the film, one of her friends asks if she\u2019s ever had sex with a man before. The model responds: \u201cYeah once. And I could have done that with a German Shepherd.\u201d\n\nSHE WAS THE ANTITHESIS OF OTHER MODELS OF THE ERA Gia initially got her start with a local photographer in Philadelphia who saw her dancing, and began appearing in local newspaper advertisements, before heading to New York at 17. When she arrived in the city, Gia met with Wilhelmina Cooper, who was floored and signed her immediately. Gia embodied the contrast that the fashion industry craved during that era \u2013 in a sea of blonde, blue-eyed, beautiful women, Gia had no filter, wore no make-up and took risks. One of her first shoots saw her pose nude behind a chain-link fence with make-up artist Sandy Linter for photographer Chris von Wangenheim. The shoot was her breakout moment, and led to her modelling for labels including Versace and Dior, and legendary photographers like Helmut Newton and Arthur Elgort. She also starred in an iconic music video, for Blondie\u2019s 1980 hit \u201cAtomic\u201d. \u201cWhen she was free and just being herself, Gia was unbelievable. That\u2019s the tragedy of her story. You think, God, she didn't need drugs \u2013 she was a drug\u201d \u2013 Angelina Jolie WHEN WILHELMINA DIED, SHE WENT OFF THE RAILS Cooper became a mother figure to Gia, whose own mum abandoned her when she was just 11, so when she died in 1980 the model was devastated. Though she often did cocaine in the bathroom stalls of Studio 54 and CBGB, Gia\u2019s drug habit began spiralling. The drug trend at that time shifted to heroin, which brought coke users down when they were too high. Usually Gia snorted heroin, with the common understanding that people could only get addicted through needles \u2013 which was false. A generation of accidental junkies was born, of which Gia was a part. Anita Sarka, a DJ from former downtown NYC institution Mudd Club and friend of Gia told Vanity Fair: \u201cIn those days, everyone had this idea that being a junkie was very glamorous.\u201d\n\n...AND WAS SOON OUT OF WORK Gia eventually started injecting and her habit became so bad that in one of her appointment books, she wrote (and misspelt) \u2018Get Heroine\u2019. Soon after, the track marks on her arms started showing in photos and only one photographer, Francesco Scavullo, requested her for work. During a particularly painful scene in Gia, Scavullo\u2019s stylist says out loud, \u201cWhat about that awful thing on her hand? It looks like a volcano,\u201d while pointing at an abscess. Unsurprisingly, Gia\u2019s career tanked. She garnered notoriety for scandalous stories like shooting up heroin in bathrooms during breaks, and on a Versace shoot with Richard Avedon she told everyone she was going out for cigarettes and never returned."}, {"url": "https://allthatsinteresting.com/gia-carangi", "page_content": "After moving to New York in 1977, Gia Carangi became one of the most sought-after models in fashion and a fixture of Studio 54 \u2014 but her life quickly unraveled.\n\nOn the surface, Gia Carangi seemed to have it all.

Her mother, Kathleen Carangi, was a homemaker.\n\nCarangi\u2019s parents separated in 1971. Those close to Carangi, including herself, have admitted that this divorce had a lasting impact on her attitude.\n\nHer two brothers, both older than her, moved out and lived with their mom while Carangi stayed with her father. She spent her summers behind his counter, attending concerts like your run-of-the-mill high schooler.\n\nIt was in the summer of 1978 that a local photographer and hairdresser, Maurice Tannenbaum, asked the dark-haired beauty to pose on the dance floor after spotting her at a local nightclub. Carangi\u2019s dark, tomboyish looks, 34-24-35 measurements, and perfect face were an ideal match for the fashion world which at the time was overrun with willowy blondes.\n\nTannenbaum passed on Carangi\u2019s photos to legendary New York department store Bloomingdale\u2019s photographer, Arthur Elgort. Before Carangi knew it, she was the talk of New York.\n\n\u201cI started working with very good people,\u201d Gia Carangi confided in a 1983 interview. \u201cI mean all the time, very fast. I didn\u2019t build into a model. I just sort of became one.\u201d\n\nA Meteoric Rise To Fame\n\nGia Carangi\u2019s first photoshoot at the Philadelphia nightclub, back when she was just 16, was the beginning of her meteoric rise to stardom, and life only moved faster once she moved to New York.\n\nCarangi signed with Wilhelmina Cooper, a legendary fashion agent and owner of her own modeling agency. Wilhelmina became a kind of mother figure to Carangi.\n\nFrancesco Scavullo, a leading fashion photographer of the day and who would become a personal friend of Carangi\u2019s, gushed of her:\n\n\u201cThere was something she had\u2026 no other girl has got it. I\u2019ve never met a girl who had it. She had the perfect body for modeling: perfect eyes, mouth, hair. And, to me, the perfect attitude: \u2018I don\u2019t give a damn.'\u201d\n\nThat attitude proved to be both what was so enticing and dangerous about Carangi.\n\nHer androgynous look was in part due to her sexuality. Described in some instances as aggressive and others as vulnerable, Carangi seemed to have a need to be loved \u2014 and mostly by women.\n\nThose who had worked with her said it wasn\u2019t uncommon for her to fall in love with the models she shot with. On a shoot for photographer Chris von Wangenheim, which would become wildly popular, Carangi posed nude up against a fence with makeup artist and model Sandy Linter.\n\nThe two would embark on a passionate though unrequited love affair.\n\nIndeed, Gia Carangi appeared insatiable both in her love life and in her recreational drug use. As a teen, she was already hooked on marijuana, cocaine, and quaaludes.\n\nCarangi went on to model for Christian Dior, Giorgio Armani, Versace, Diane Von Furstenberg, Cutex, Lancetti, Levi\u2019s, Maybelline, Vidal-Sassoon, and Yves Saint Laurent \u2014 to name a few. At the age of 18, Carangi was making $100,000 a year. It was more than any other model at the time, leading many fashion historians to dub her the world\u2019s first supermodel.\n\nShe then landed on the covers of Vogue and Cosmo starting in 1979.\n\n\u201cA model has to create moods,\u201d Carangi said of her talent, \u201cYou have to be careful not to get stuck in a mood \u2013 emotions have trends just like fashion \u2026 I become what ever your eye wants to see. It\u2019s my job.\u201d\n\nBut Gia Carangi remained hard to control. Though it was her edgy attitude that drew people to her, Carangi was also tough to work with. A diva by age 18, she would walk off shoots if she wasn\u2019t feeling it, or would cancel weeks of work if she didn\u2019t like her haircut.\n\nCarangi would chow down on barbecue chicken while wearing a dress worth thousands of dollars. She was also transparent about her drug use, discussing it openly in interviews and partying often with other stars and socialites at Studio 54.\n\nBut there was also a deep loneliness in her, returning to her apartment alone after work, and constantly searching for love. \u201cI am finally really starting to dig being different. Maybe I am discovering who I am. Or maybe I\u2019m just stoned again,\u201d she admitted.\n\nGia Carangi Backslides Into Drugs\n\nThe supermodel would go from a $10,000 photo shoot to a \u201cshooting gallery\u201d, or seedy locale where one can shoot up heroin, on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side.\n\nIn 1980, Wilhelmina died and sent Carangi into a spiral. Already using heroin, the supermodel delved deeper into her habit. During a shoot that year for Vogue with famed portrait photographer Richard Avedon, Carangi escaped through a window. Though incensed, the magazine gave her a second chance at the shoot, but when the pictures came back they revealed track marks and red bumps all over the model\u2019s arms.\n\nIn 1981, she was arrested for driving under the influence of a narcotic.\n\nIn May of that same year, 21-year-old Carangi needed to get hand surgery because \u201cshe had injected herself in the same place so many times that there was an open infected tunnel leading into her vein,\u201d her biographer Stephen Fried documented.\n\nFor her final Cosmo cover photo in early 1982, fashion photographer Scavullo covered up the track marks on her arms by having her put her hands behind her back. The dress she wore was poofy enough to cover up the scars of her habit. The model also angled her face to cover up the bloating.\n\nHer brother, Michael, recalled his little sister\u2019s behavior and laments: \u201cThe biggest mistake we made was that nobody went up there with her. She could\u2019ve used a friend.\u201d\n\nGia Carangi left her modeling agency, tried to stay afloat at another, but wound up returning home to Philadelphia to live with her mother at a final grasp at finding sobriety.\n\nAn Untimely Demise\n\nGia Carangi was blackballed from New York\u2019s agencies and although magazines gave her several last chances, the model could not pull herself together. One of her final shoots appeared in Vogue in 1982 and was photographed by Andrea Blanch.\n\nBy the end of that year, Carangi had become so volatile that she couldn\u2019t get booked for jobs. No one wanted to work with the wild child any longer.\n\nShe had a successful go at rehab for about a year following in Philadelphia. By this time she was broke and receiving rehabilitation from welfare.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9npRKUAeQZI\n\nMeanwhile, model Cindy Crawford came on the scene as a newer, more put together version of Gia. Crawford admitted to Playboy that many of her jobs came from those who loved Carangi and were hoping to replace her.\n\nIn the fall of 1986, Carangi was hospitalized. It became apparent that she had been sleeping outside in the rain and had been badly beaten up and raped. Blood tests showed she was suffering from AIDS-related complications.\n\nOn November 26, 1986, America\u2019s first supermodel died of those complications, though her mother was by her side.\n\nCarangi\u2019s meteoric and tumultuous career were immortalized in the HBO movie Gia that starred Angelina Jolie nearly a decade later in 1998. Jolie said of the model herself after portraying her, \u201cYou think, \u2018God, she didn\u2019t need drugs \u2014 she was a drug.'\u201d\n\nCarangi seemed to be somewhat cognizant of her brilliant, though short, career. She said forebodingly in an interview before her demise: \u201cModeling is a short gig.\u201d\n\nAfter this look at Gia Carangi, read about who some believe was America\u2019s first \u201cit\u201d girl, Audrey Munson.

Gia Carangi images adorned the covers of the world\u2019s top magazines during her short-lived career in the late \u201870s and early \u201880s. In fact, at the start of her career she was featured on the cover of Cosmopolitan twice in the span of five months, and made the covers of the French, British and American Vogue. Her androgynous, borderline tomboy look and olive complexion favorably contrasted against the blonde-haired blue-eyed models that had been popular up until that time, and she was once described as a \u201cbeautiful punk, a butch pin-up girl.\u201d\n\nGia was in high demand, and if it weren\u2019t for her drug addiction and other self-destructive habits, her career would have cemented her legacy alongside famous supermodels like Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Cindy Crawford. But what Gia is perhaps best known for is her rapid self-destruction, which ultimately led to her untimely death.\n\nHow did Gia Marie Carangi die? She contracted a virus that was ravaging the world at the time, and one which the medical community knew little about \u2014 HIV, which soon had fully blown into AIDS. Stricken with the disease, ravaged by drug abuse, penniless, abandoned by all her friends, Gia passed away quietly in a hospital bed in 1986 with only her mother at her side. She was 26.\n\nIn 1998, HBO produced a film about the brief, beautiful, and reckless life of Gia Carangi, starring Angelina Jolie. But for most who haven't seen the film, Gia is little-known: a dark, quiet, but important figure from the history of modeling industry and the rise of the supermodel."}, {"url": "https://www.factinate.com/people/facts-gia-carangi/", "page_content": "Gia Carangi took the modelling industry by storm with her fearless, androgynous look and risk-taking sensibilities. Although she is widely considered to be the first supermodel, her early exposure to substances derailed her career right at the peak of her success. Gia\u2019s story is a cautionary tale\u2014one of heartbreak and regret\u2014and it only ends in tragedy.\n\n1. She Came From A Broken Family\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBorn January 29, 1960, Gia Carangi had it rough right from the get-go. Her home life was violent and unstable, and when she was only 11 years old, her mother walked out on the family. After that, Gia didn\u2019t see her mother for years. She spent her youth in Philadelphia, working at her father\u2019s small restaurant and trying to forget her yearning for a maternal figure.\n\nBut this sense of loss never went away.\n\n2. She Marched To The Beat Of Her Own Drum\n\nGia found other meaningful connections in her friendships and was shamelessly open with her feelings. She often declared intentions of friendship with floral bouquets. No flowers for the boys though! Gia was all about the ladies. In high school, she pivoted from platonic girl crushes and began frequenting gay clubs, subverting gender norms every chance she got.\n\nHowever, Gia did have time for one man, and one man only\u2014her idol, David Bowie.\n\n3. She Looked Up To A Legend\n\nGia and her friends obsessed over Bowie\u2019s glam style, bisexuality, and playful gender subversion. Taking cues from the legendary musician, Gia adopted an androgynous style. She wore men\u2019s clothes\u2014army pants and combat boots\u2013and kept her hair cropped short and brightly dyed. But that wan\u2019t all. Gia was a barefaced beauty all the way through and never wore a stitch of makeup.\n\nWhile out at the clubs, she definitely stood out from the crowd.\n\n4. She Stood Out From The Crowd\n\nEveryone noticed Gia\u2014it was hard not to. She was a hip vision in her thrifted vintage wardrobe of men\u2019s castoffs, and her signature style was a striking contrast to her unadorned natural beauty. Instantly captivated by Gia at a club she frequented, a local shutterbug, Maurice Tannenbaum, asked to take her photograph on the dance floor. Before long, bold, confident, and self-assured Gia began to model in local advertisements.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t all the nightclubs had to offer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. She Was Gay and Proud\n\nWhen she was only 15 years old, Gia partied at the gay club DCA and set her eyes on a short and beautiful blonde girl named Sharon Beverly. She\u2019d actually briefly dated Beverly\u2019s brother, but in the end, her overwhelming attraction to Beverly won out. However, there was one caveat\u2014Beverly was quite a bit older than Gia and it was about to get her in a lot of trouble.\n\n6. She Was Too Young\n\nAlthough Kathleen Sperr wasn\u2019t especially close to her daughter Gia, it didn\u2019t stop her from laying down the law. After finding out about Gia\u2019s lesbian romance with Sharon, she immediately called up Sharon\u2019s parents and warned them that their daughter was far too old to be hanging out with Gia. Of course, this never stopped Gia from pursuing what she wanted\u2014whether it be a woman or a career or a bad decision.\n\n6. She Took A Chance\n\nWith some exposure and experience, Gia decided to see how far she could get with modelling. Like many before her, Gia\u2019s dreams and aspirations were bigger than the confines of her hometown. The bright lights and endless possibilities of New York City drew Gia to the pulsing metropolis. Only 17, and all on her own in an unfamiliar and strange city, Gia didn\u2019t have to wait long before being discovered.\n\nShe soon met a woman who would not only be her agent, and mentor, but also a dear friend. This was the maternal figure she had been searching for all along.\n\n7. She Was A Hit\n\nWhen Gia met Wilhelmina Cooper, one of the most successful models of the 1960s, everything changed. Although Cooper\u2019s career had been based on her icy, aristocratic look, she immediately recognized the edgy, blue-collar Gia as a new breed of model. After signing her on, Cooper took Gia under her wing, and before long, Gia herself had become a one-name wonder.\n\n8. She Got Her First Big Break\n\nThe first major shoot Gia booked was so chaotic and iconic it\u2019s still talked about to this day. In it, Gia climbed and posed against a chain link fence. And then she amped up the drama. She started shrugging out of her clothes, eventually shedding them all together. When another model joined her on set, the two of them took it to the next level.\n\nSign up to our newsletter.

She Was Obsessed With Her Makeup Artist\n\nOn the day of her infamous photoshoot, Gia had two costars. The first round of shots were taken with Lisa Vales, but for the second round, the photographer wanted to do something more personal and asked the makeup artist, Sandy Linter, to step in. That\u2019s when the magic really started happening. She and Gia had unbelievable chemistry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. She Bared All\n\nTogether, Gia and Vales turned up the heat, sharing steamy smouldering gazes through the wire, with only the fence between them. It was risky and fearless, and absolutely successful. The pictures are now part of fashion history and still have tongues wagging to this day. More than that, the snaps launched Gia\u2019s career into the stratosphere.\n\n11. She Became The First Supermodel\n\nThe photos caused a sensation, and in a short time Gia established herself within the modelling world. She began working with top fashion houses including haute couture heavyweights Versace, Armani, and Saint Laurent. But that wasn\u2019t all. She also booked coveted jobs as a cover girl for Paris and American Vogue. As Gia\u2019s star rapidly rose, there was one person she just couldn\u2019t get out of her head.\n\n12. She Shot Her Shot\n\nThe day after their steamy photoshoot, Gia put the moves on Linter, and asked her if she wanted a ride in her bright red sports car. Linter went along with it and soon after, things started getting serious. After her busy work days, 19-year-old Gia didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of her night alone in an empty apartment. With Linter, she found companionship\u2014a balm to her ever growing sense of isolation.\n\n13. She Fell In Love\n\nGia and Linter loved one another deeply and while Linter has since admitted that it wasn\u2019t a \u201ctorrid love affair,\u201d these two girls certainly shared a special connection. They spent most of their time together. There were flowers, restaurants, and wild nights out at the clubs, but most importantly, there was the mutual feeling of being understood.\n\nBut this comfortable relationship was never destined for \u201chappily ever after.\u201d\n\n14. She Was Intensely Lonely\n\nPeople described Gina as a loner, but those closest to her claimed the opposite was true. When it came to her relationship with Linter, Gia always wanted more\u2014more stability, more affection, and more time. Unfortunately, Linter just wasn\u2019t able to give her any of this, and was hesitant to put labels on their relationship. Slowly but surely, Gia\u2019s constant need for attention doused any hope of a long-term commitment.\n\nWithout Linter and with the constant pressures of the modelling industry, Gia sought out other\u2014more dangerous\u2014coping mechanisms.\n\n15. She Was A Casual User\n\nPartygoers of the decadent disco era were nose candy enthusiasts, and the powder was ubiquitous in the night club culture that Gia adored. The hotspot club Studio 54 was a notorious place for using substances, and bumping lines off the closest mirror was commonplace with the party people crowd Gia ran with. This was a slippery slope, and Gia dove down it\u2014head first.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n16. She Was Oblivious\n\nOf course, this underworld had sinister consequences. It was almost too easy for an unsuspecting user to snort a different substance by mistake\u2026like say, if the substance was a white powder. Gia, like many others at the time, was sorely misinformed about it and believed that you couldn\u2019t get addicted unless under certain circumstances. As she soon learned, it was far more dangerous than she ever expected.\n\n14. She Hit Her Peak\n\nAmid the temptations of New York\u2019s nightlife, Gia was at the top of her game. To her delight, she participated in a rite of passage for A-list models, making a guest appearance in a music video. The band was Blondie, and as a huge fan, Gia cut across the dance floor, bobbing her head to the song \u201cAtomic.\u201d With the music video and her unparalleled success, everything was going according to plan\u2026\n\n\u2026But just as she was taking off, a tragedy struck.\n\n15. She Lost Her Mentor\n\nWhen Gia learned that her mentor Wilhelmina had been diagnosed with lung cancer, she felt her world crumbling around her. This powerful woman had acted as her center\u2014her maternal figure and guiding light. At the tragically young age of 40, Wilhelmina succumbed to her illness, leaving Gia all alone. Devastated and grieving, the young model made a terrible mistake.\n\n16. She Couldn\u2019t Keep It Together\n\nWith only two years of industry experience, Gia immediately began to falter without Wilhelmina\u2019s strong guidance and encouragement. Her depression drove her to self-medicate with the many subtances available to her and it wasn\u2019t long before she disappeared into the grip of addiction. Of course, this self-destructive behavior didn\u2019t bode well for her blossoming career.\n\n17. She Was A Diva\n\nEven before her troubles with addiction began to have an impact on her work, Gia was a total diva. Her high-maintenance behavior was part and parcel of her edgy style that made her unique. But there was only so much people were willing to tolerate. She was notoriously hard to work with. And as her use only escalated, so did her difficult antics\u2026\n\n18. She Lost Control\n\nBefore substances, it wasn\u2019t uncommon for Gia to wander off and ghost a set, or cancel work over a bad haircut, but under the influence, it only got worse. While on set, she started pulling vicious temper tantrums, and sometimes, she\u2019d even abandon a job just to seek out a score.At an extremely low point, her overwhelming exhaustion had her falling asleep in front of the cameras. But that wasn\u2019t all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n19. She Became An Addict\n\nGia\u2019s addiction became so bad that in one of her datebooks she made it a top priority, scrawling the words, \u201cGet heroine.\u201d Ugh! The grim misspelling is so multilayered. Gia, instead of continuing to be the hero of her own story became hopelessly enthralled by the narcotic that would doom her. As her addiction spiralled out of control, her peers and few friends began to see that Gia was on a crash course for disaster.\n\n20. She Didn\u2019t Have A Lot Of Friends\n\nDuring this time, one of the few friends Gia had left was her ex-girlfriend Sandy Linter. Linter herself was no stranger to using in nightclubs, and at the time, had no idea how destructive it could be. But witnessing Gia\u2019s descent into addiction changed all that. She was shocked to discover that, at the vibrant age of 20, Gia had so little energy she could barely dress herself.\n\nBut the side effects of addiction didn\u2019t end there\u2026\n\n21. She Had Surgery\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that a model\u2019s face and body is their brand and their product, and Gia certainly wasn\u2019t careful with the merchandise. As she constantly shot up in the same spot, her habit caused an abscess and infection that damaged a vein and required her to undergo surgery. Still, the surgery didn\u2019t fix the problem, and soon, the constant injections became an even bigger issue.\n\n22. She Had One Supporter\n\nTo her dismay, Gia\u2019s track marks soon became too noticeable to ignore. The scars and bruises marred her photos, and soon barely anybody wanted to work with her. Only one fashion photographer kept coming back to Gia. Francesco Scavullo, who had met Gia when she was just a teenager, stood by her. He had seen her potential from the get-go and supported her every step of the way.\n\nBut during a photoshoot in the Caribbean, even Scavullo couldn\u2019t deny that Gia needed some serious help.\n\n23. She Needed Help\n\nWhile shooting with Scavullo on location, Gia had a total breakdown. She couldn\u2019t find any scores, and became tearful and unstable. Luckily, Scavullo stepped in like a guardian angel and calmed her down, forcing her to go to bed for some much-needed rest. Gia was circling the drain\u2014rock bottom was just around the corner.\n\n24. She Became A Terrible Client\n\nDuring one of her last shoots for American Vogue, Gia\u2019s track marks were highly noticeable. So visible, in fact, that they can be seen in the final pictures. No amount of airbrushing could conceal the unsightly scars and bruises. This damage coupled with her lax professionalism endangered her career, and Gia was steps away from being blacklisted.\n\n25. She Jumped Ship\n\nWilhelmina as a company meant nothing to Gia without Cooper at the helm, and she left the agency to sign with competitor Ford Models. But her plan went horribly wrong. Ford Models dropped her almost immediately, and from there, Gia\u2019s career quickly went downhill. But the fashion companies weren\u2019t the only ones to steer clear of Gia, and soon she found herself more alone than ever.\n\n26. She Had Nobody\n\nAs her work dried up, her fashion industry \u201cfriends\u201d scattered like rats from a sinking ship, and even by some accounts her old bestie Sandy Linter wouldn\u2019t talk to her anymore. She became so toxic that no one wanted her rep to rub off on them by association. Jobless, friendless, and completely consumed by her addiction\u2014Gia knew it was time for a change.\n\n27. She Upped And Left\n\nGia desperately needed a break to find some clarity and came up with a strategy to get her life back on track. She made a drastic decision and abandoned the temptations of New York, returning home to Philadelphia to stay with her mother and stepfather. More than anything, she wanted to get clean, and decided to try a 21-day detox program. Perhaps this was the answer to all her problems\u2026\n\n28. She Tried To Get Clean\n\nAfter the detox program, Gia\u2019s sobriety seemed hopeful. But to everyone\u2019s dismay, the detox program didn\u2019t yield any long-lasting results. Not long after finishing the program, she relapsed\u2026and relapsed hard. In fact, she landed in some serious trouble. On one memorable occasion she incited a car chase with the authorities where she sped recklessly through the suburbs.\n\n29. She Crashed And Burned\n\nJust like her attempt at rehabilitation, her car chase antics ended in disappointment. She crashed into a fence and was taken into custody. There, they determined that she was indeed, extremely intoxicated and high as a kite. Resigned to her own dependencies, Gia tried to look for more work. But more than anything, she just wanted her old life back.\n\n30. She Put On A Brave Face\n\nIn 1981, Gia had her first and only television appearance. Her 20/20 interview on ABC highlighted the darker side of the modelling world, but also gave Gia the chance to set the record straight. She hoped to show the world that she\u2019d overcome her many demons, and was ready for a comeback. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\n31. She Lied On Television\n\nThroughout the interview, Gia claimed that her life of using was over, and that she was completely clean. But her glazed look throughout the segment only proved that she was still using. Her empty claims had her lying through her teeth\u2014so desperate was she for the industry to give her another chance. Then, later that year, something promising happened.\n\n32. She Attempted A Comeback\n\nIn late 1981, Elite Model Management decided to give Gia the benefit of the doubt and signed her. But even then, finding work was a struggle. Because of her tarnished reputation, many companies refused to even consider working with her. No matter how hard she tried to leverage her past status, her comeback soon proved futile.\n\nTo add insult to injury, her very last photoshoot sadly mirrored the success of her first one\u2014they were both infamous\u2013but for very different reasons\u2026\n\n33. Her Photoshoot Was A Disaster\n\nGia\u2019s last magazine cover shoot was for Cosmopolitan in 1982. Behind the camera was none other than her tried and true friend\u2014Francesco Scavullo. But not even his comforting presence could make this last project a success. One of Scavullo\u2019s assistants later reflected on Gia\u2019s dwindling health: \u201cI could see the change in her beauty. There was an emptiness in her eyes.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, the photoshoot was a disaster.\n\n34. She Hid Her Scars\n\nThe Cosmopolitan cover featured Gia with both her arms hidden by the full skirt of her dress. The awkward pose was the only solution to cover up how disfigured Gia\u2019s arms had become from her continued use of needles. After this disastrous shoot, Gia had no choice but to resort to modelling for department stores and catalogs. But even then, fate offered her another shot at redemption\u2026\n\n35. She Had One Last Chance\n\nDespite her notoriously bad behavior, Gia was given one last miraculous chance. While doing mostly catalog work, she landed a gig with famed fashion photographer, Richard Avedon. But this wasn\u2019t just any gig\u2014it was a campaign for the fashion house of Versace. For once in her life, this was one gig Gia couldn\u2019t afford to mess up.\n\n36. She Played Hooky\n\nAfter a hard night of partying, Sandy Linter remembers Gia in the morning light, sitting in the kitchen with the phone pressed to her ear. When Gia asked her whether she should go into work or not, Linter immediately responded with \u201cNot if you feel the way I do!\u201d In retrospect this was a huge mistake. When she found out what it cost Gia to skip out on work, she wished she could take it all back.\n\n37. She Missed Out\n\nAs a supermodel, missing one day of work means sacrificing a lot. When Gia took Lister\u2019s advice and played hooky, she missed out on a $5000 payoff and so much more. When she didn\u2019t show, the model Rosie Vela took her coveted position. She had effectively blown her very last chance in the modelling industry\u2014and it was a very high price to pay.\n\n38. She Hit Rock Bottom\n\nAfter this debacle, Gia was effectively blacklisted: She was no longer able to book work with any major agency, and went at whiplash speed from a hot commodity to a pariah. Her job prospects dwindled down to nothing, and it was about to get very, very desperate. In her darkest hour, she had no choice but to scrape the very bottom of the barrel.\n\n39. She Couldn\u2019t Keep A Job\n\nGia began her illustrious career posing for ads in her hometown paper, and things came full circle when she found herself doing catalog work for an obscure German mail-order company. But even that job was too much for her to manage. Gia used on set and, unwilling to tolerate this behavior, the company fired Gia and sent her home. But while this seemed like the end, the nightmare was only just beginning.\n\n40. She Was Destitute\n\nGia\u2019s glamorous life in New York had come to an end, and having spent all her money, she was essentially homeless. She began dividing her time between her hometown of Philadelphia and Atlantic City, New Jersey while couch surfing among a handful of lovers, friends, and family members. After one last stab at rehab, she swallowed her pride and tried to find employment.\n\n41. She Took A Job In The Real World\n\nGia tried her hand at a number of jobs. First she tried retail, and when that didn\u2019t work, she became a checkout clerk. She even tried working at a nursing home cafeteria. But none of these occupations ever stuck. By 1985, Gia started using again, but this time she had no safety net\u2014no second chances. With nowhere to go, her life took a dark and dangerous turn.\n\n42. She Became A Night Worker\n\nIn lieu of unemployment, Gia resorted to selling more than just her image, but also her body. Compounded with her spiralling addiction, this was a recipe for disaster. In December 1985, she was admitted to a hospital in Pennsylvania. She was extremely ill and doctors diagnosed her with bilateral pneumonia. But little did Gia know, she wasn\u2019t out of the woods yet.\n\n43. She Had A Devastating Diagnosis\n\nA few days later, doctors revealed another, more terrifying diagnosis: Gia had AIDS-related complex. Gia was diagnosed with AIDS at a time when doctors knew very little about the disease, and there was precious little that could be done to save her. In the fall of the next year, Gia was in hospital once again\u2014and this time, she was in much worse condition.\n\n44. She Was One Of The First\n\nIn 1986, Gia faced a horrific ordeal\u2014she was beaten and raped and left out on the street. On October 18, her health took a severe nosedive, and she found herself hospitalized for the final time. With so little known about her disease, doctors treated her as though she was highly infectious. They rigorously wiped down every surface she touched, and anyone attending her wore full protective gear.\n\n45. She Had Regrets\n\nAlthough the end was near, Gia didn\u2019t find much solace in her brief life or career path. Shortly before her passing, Gia had a casual conversation with one of her nurses. Oblivious to Gia\u2019s past, the nurse told her about a photographer who wanted to take pictures of her daughter. Gia\u2019s response was absolutely tragic: \u201cDon\u2019t do it. Even if she wants it, don\u2019t let her do it. I used to be a model. You don\u2019t want your kid to be a model.\u201d\n\n46. She Had A Tragic End\n\nOn November 18, 1986, Gia Carangi passed away from AIDS-related complications. She was only 26 years old. In fact, she was one of the first famous women to ever succumb to the disease. Her family held a small service in her hometown of Philadelphia. Having been such an icon in the modelling world, one might expect Gia\u2019s funeral to be attended by a great number of old coworkers and friends\u2026But this just wasn\u2019t the case\u2026\n\n47. They Forgot Her\n\nWhen her long-time supporter and collaborator, Francesco Scavullo, heard the tragic news, he sent his sympathies and a Catholic Prayer card to her family. However, not one single person or any of her so-called friends from the fashion world attended the service. The world had already moved on from Gia Carangi, and her replacement was rearing to go.\n\n48. They Replaced Her\n\nAfter Gia stepped onto the modelling scene, her signature tomboy look became highly sought after. After she disappeared from the scene, agents worked quickly to find a new model to carry the torch and fill the void left in Gia\u2019s wake. Fashion experts soon shopped around a new young model and even dubbed her \u201cBaby Gia.\u201d Who was this young model? None other than Cindy Crawford.\n\n49. She Has A Biopic\n\nIn 1998, Angelina Jolie starred in the HBO made-for-TV biopic, Gia. Jolie had really interesting, albeit bizarre things to say about portraying Gia. Among the least weird was, \u201cI\u2019d like to date Gia. I\u2019d want to be her lover.\u201d Which is one thing, until you remember Jolie was playing her. But no matter her comments, it\u2019s safe to say that this film keeps people coming back to Gia\u2019s story time and time again.\n\n50. She Lives On\n\nOne fitting and sombre tribute to Gia is her square on the AIDS Memorial quilt. The NAMES Project created the folk-art quilt that weighs over 50 tons, and in 1989 they were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Gia\u2019s square reads, \u201cYou know what I think? I think there\u2019s a reason for everything. God has a big plan for me. Just not in this life.\u201d\n\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,"}, {"url": "https://timenote.info/en/Gia-Carangi", "page_content": "Gia Marie Carangi (January 29, 1960 \u2013 November 18, 1986) was an American fashion model during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Carangi is considered by some to be the first supermodel, although that title has been applied to others, including Janice Dickinson, Dorian Leigh, and Jean Shrimpton. Model Cindy Crawford was later referred to as \"Baby Gia\" due to her resemblance to Carangi.\n\nCarangi was featured on the cover of fashion magazines, including the April 1979 edition of British Vogue, the April 1979 and August 1980 editions of Vogue Paris, the August 1980 edition of American Vogue, the January 1981 edition of Vogue Italia, and several issues of Cosmopolitan between 1979 and 1982.\n\nAfter she became addicted to heroin, Carangi's modeling career rapidly declined. She later contracted HIV, which suddenly claimed her life at the age of 26. Her death was not widely publicized and few people in the fashion industry knew of it. Carangi is thought to be one of the first famous women to die of AIDS. Gia, a biographical film starring Angelina Jolie, debuted on HBO in 1998.\n\nEarly life\n\nCarangi was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was the third and youngest child of Joseph, a restaurant owner, and Kathleen (n\u00e9e Adams) Carangi, a homemaker. She had two older brothers. Her father is Italian, and her mother is of Irish and Welsh ancestry. Joseph and Kathleen had an unstable, violent marriage leading Kathleen to ultimately abandoning the family when Carangi was eleven years old. Those who knew her blamed her \"fractured childhood\" for the instability and drug-dependence that plagued her adult life. She was described as \"needy and manipulative\" by relatives who recalled her as spoiled and shy as a child and a \"mommy\u2019s girl\" who did not receive the motherly attention that she desired.\n\nIn her adolescent years, Carangi found the attention she sought from other teenage girls, befriending them by sending flowers. While attending Abraham Lincoln High School, Carangi bonded with \"the Bowie kids\", a group of obsessive David Bowie fans who emulated Bowie's \"defiantly weird, high-glam\" style. Carangi was drawn to Bowie for his fashion preferences and his ambiguous gender play and outspoken bisexuality. A friend of Carangi described her \"tomboy persona,\" describing her relaxed openness about her sexuality as reminiscent of the character Cay in the 1985 film Desert Hearts. Carangi and her \"bi-try Bowie-mad\" friends hung out in Philadelphia\u2019s gay clubs and bars. Though she associated with the lesbian community, she did not want to take up \"the accepted lesbian style\".\n\nCareer\n\nSuccess\n\nCarangi was most known in modeling circles by only her first name. After being featured in Philadelphia newspaper ads, Carangi moved to New York City at the age of 17, where she quickly rose to prominence. She was a favorite model of various fashion photographers, including Francesco Scavullo, Arthur Elgort, Joseph Petrellis, Richard Avedon, Denis Piel, Marco Glaviano, and Chris von Wangenheim.\n\nWell-integrated within the fashion world, Carangi had the selection of several photographers, most notably Scavullo. By the end of 1978, Carangi was already a well-established model. In a 20/20 interview, she said her rise was \"very fast\" and \"I started working with well-known people in the industry, very quickly. I didn't build into a model. I just sort of became one.\"\n\nCarangi was a regular at Studio 54 and the Mudd Club. She usually used cocaine in clubs, but later developed a heroin addiction.\n\nIn October 1978, Carangi did her first major shoot with top fashion photographer Chris von Wangenheim. Wangenheim had her pose nude behind a chain-link fence with makeup assistant Sandy Linter. Carangi immediately became infatuated with Linter and started to pursue her, though the relationship never became stable.\n\nDrug abuse and career decline\n\nOn March 1, 1980, Carangi's agent and mentor, Wilhelmina Cooper, died of lung cancer. Devastated, Carangi started abusing drugs. Scavullo recalled a fashion shoot in the Caribbean when \"She was crying, she couldn't find her drugs. I literally had to lay her down on her bed until she fell asleep.\" Her addiction soon began to affect her work. Carangi began having violent temper tantrums, walking out of photo shoots to buy drugs, and began falling asleep in front of the camera. During one of her final location shoots for Vogue, Carangi had visible red bumps in the crooks of her elbows where she had injected heroin. The photos were airbrushed and eventually ran in the November 1980 issue of Vogue, but some photos reportedly still showed visible needle marks.\n\nBy November 1980, Carangi's career was in a steep decline. Modeling offers soon ceased and her fashion industry friends, including Sandy Linter, refused to speak to her fearing their association with her would harm their careers. She briefly signed with Ford Models \"for a couple of weeks\", but was soon dropped. In an attempt to quit drugs, she moved back to Philadelphia with her mother and step-father in February 1981.\n\nRetirement and attempted comeback\n\nAfter moving to Philadelphia, Carnagi went through a 21-day detox program. Her sobriety however was short-lived and she was arrested in March 1981 after she drove into a fence in a suburban neighborhood and took off. After a chase with police, she was taken into custody where it was later determined she was under the influence of alcohol and cocaine. After her release, Carangi briefly signed with a new agency, Legends. She worked sporadically, mainly in Europe.\n\nIn fall 1981, Carangi was in the throes of drug abuse. Despite this, she was still determined to make a comeback in the fashion industry and signed with Elite Model Management. While some clients were refused to work with her, other clients were willing to take a chance because of her past status as a top model. One of her first jobs was for Francesco Scavullo who photographed her for Cosmopolitan. Scavullo convinced the magazine's editors to use the shot for its April 1982 cover. Sean Byrnes, Scavullo's long-time assistant later said, \"What she was doing to herself finally became apparent in her pictures. [...] I could see the change in her beauty. There was an emptiness in her eyes.\" The Cosmo cover would be her last.\n\nDuring this time, Carangi mainly worked with photographer Albert Watson and got jobs modeling for department stores and catalogs. In April 1982, Richard Avedon hired her for the 1982 Versace campaign which lead to her being hired for the Spring 1983 campaign. She then modeled for German mail-order clothing company Otto Versand. Around this time, Carangi enrolled in an outpatient methadone program but soon began using heroin again. During a photo shoot for the Spring 1983 Versace campaign shot in the fall of 1982, Carangi became uncomfortable and left the shoot before any usable shots of her were taken. By the end of 1982, she had only a few clients that were willing to hire her. Carangi's final photo shoot was for Otto Versand in Tunisia. She was sent home during the shoot for using heroin. She left New York for the final time in Spring 1983.\n\nLater years\n\nCarangi spent her remaining years living with various lovers, friends and family members in Philadelphia and Atlantic City. She was admitted to an intense drug treatment program at Eageville Hospital in December 1984. After treatment, she got a job in a clothing store which she eventually quit. She later got a job as a checkout clerk and then worked in the cafeteria of a nursing home. By the winter of 1985, Carangi began using drugs again. In June 1986, she was admitted to Warminster General Hospital in Warminster, Pennsylvania with bilateral pneumonia. A few days later, she was diagnosed with AIDS-related complex.\n\nDeath\n\nOn October 18, 1986, Carangi was admitted to Hahnemann University Hospital. She died of AIDS-related complications on November 18, 1986. Her funeral was held on November 23 at a small funeral home in Philadelphia. No one from the fashion world attended, mainly because no one knew about her death until months after she had died. However, weeks later, Francesco Scavullo, Carangi's friend and confidant, sent a Mass card when he heard the news.\n\nLegacy\n\nA biography of Carangi by Stephen Fried called Thing of Beauty (the title of John Keats' famous poem) was published in 1993. A biographical film, Gia, debuted on HBO in 1998. Angelina Jolie starred in the title role, garnering a Golden Globe award for the role.\n\nIn 1996, actress-screenwriter Zo\u00eb Tamerlis, herself a heroin addict who died of drug-related causes in 1999, was commissioned to write a screenplay based upon Carangi's life. This version of Gia was not produced, but after Tamerlis' death, footage of Carangi, Tamerlis, photographers, Carangi's family, and Sandy Linter discussing her life was incorporated into a 2003 documentary entitled The Self-Destruction of Gia.\n\nCarangi's sexual orientation has been disputed after her death; LGBT outlets label her lesbian, and other times as bisexual due to her sexual relationships with men. In the film Gia, Jolie also portrayed her as being sexually intimate with men and women. Since Carangi's death, she has been considered a lesbian supermodel and icon.\n\nDesigners and cosmetic firms represented"}, {"url": "https://livebiography.com/biography/gia-carangi/", "page_content": "Home \u00bb Biography \u00bb Gia Carangi Biography, Age, Height, Career, Net Worth, Affairs, Death & More\n\nGia Carangi Biography, Age, Height, Career, Net Worth, Affairs, Death & More\n\nGia Carangi Biography:\n\nGia Carangi beauty is intrinsic to the human eye as we are drawn towards the symmetry of faces and bodies of enviable proportions.

Gia\u2019s friend and confidence, Francesco Scavullo sent a Mass card when the news reached his ears. The model who defined an era of fashion had died because of her drug addiction.\n\nSpread the love\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit a Bio"}, {"url": "https://timenote.info/en/Gia-Marie-Carangi", "page_content": "Gia Marie Carangi (January 29, 1960 \u2013 November 18, 1986) was an American model, considered by many to be the first supermodel.\n\nShe was featured on the cover of many magazines, including multiple editions of Vogue and Cosmopolitan, and appeared in advertising campaigns for luxury fashion houses such as Armani, Dior, Versace and Yves Saint Laurent.\n\nAfter Carangi became addicted to heroin, her career rapidly declined. In 1986, at age 26, she died of AIDS-related complications. Believed to have contracted it from a contaminated needle, she became one of the first famous women to die of the disease. Her life was dramatized in the 1998 HBO television film, Gia directed by Michael Cristofer and starring Angelina Jolie as Carangi.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nCarangi was born in January 29, 1960 in Philadelphia, the third and youngest child of Joseph Carangi, a restaurant owner, and Kathleen Carangi (n\u00e9e Adams), a homemaker. She had two older brothers. Her father was Italian, and her mother was of Irish and Welsh ancestry. Joseph and Kathleen had an unstable, violent marriage, ultimately leading Kathleen to abandon the family when Carangi was eleven years old. Gia was described as \"needy and manipulative\" by relatives who recalled her as spoiled and shy as a child and a \"mommy's girl\" who did not receive the motherly attention that she desired. Those who knew Gia blamed her \"fractured childhood\" for the instability and drug dependence that plagued her adult life.\n\nIn her adolescent years, Carangi found the attention she sought from other teenage girls, befriending them by sending flowers. While attending Abraham Lincoln High School, Carangi bonded with \"the Bowie kids\", a group of obsessive David Bowie fans who emulated Bowie's \"defiantly weird, high-glam\" style. Carangi was drawn to Bowie for his fashion preferences and his ambiguous gender play and outspoken bisexuality. One of Carangi's friends later spoke of her \"tomboy persona\", describing her relaxed openness about her sexuality as reminiscent of the character Cay in the 1985 film Desert Hearts. Carangi and her \"bi-try Bowie-mad\" friends hung out in Philadelphia's gay clubs and bars. Though she associated with the lesbian community, she did not want to take up \"the accepted lesbian style.\"\n\nCareer\n\nAfter being featured in Philadelphia newspaper ads and being discovered by Sondra Scerca in Maurice Tannenbaum's hair salon, Carangi moved to New York City at the age of 17, where she signed with Wilhelmina Models. Her first major shoot, published in October 1978, was with top fashion photographer Chris von Wangenheim, who had her pose nude behind a chain-link fence with makeup artist Sandy Linter. Carangi immediately became infatuated with Linter and pursued her, though the relationship never became stable. By the end of 1978, her first year in New York, Carangi was already a well-established model. Of her quick rise to prominence, described by Vogue as \"meteoric\", Carangi later said, \"I started working with very good people, I mean all the time, very fast. I didn't build into a model, I just sort of became one.\"\n\nCarangi was a favorite model of various fashion photographers, including Von Wangenheim, Francesco Scavullo, Arthur Elgort, Richard Avedon, and Denis Piel. Well-integrated within the fashion world, she had the selection of several photographers, most notably Scavullo. Carangi was featured on the cover of many fashion magazines, including the April 1979 issue of British Vogue, the April 1979 and August 1980 issues of Vogue Paris, the August 1980 issue of American Vogue, the February 1981 issue of Vogue Italia, and multiple issues of Cosmopolitan between 1979 and 1982. During these years, she also appeared in various advertising campaigns for high-profile fashion houses, including Armani, Andr\u00e9 Laug, Christian Dior, Versace, and Yves Saint Laurent. At the height of her career, Carangi was most known in modeling circles by only her first name. During this time, she also appeared in the Blondie music video for \"Atomic\".\n\nA regular at Studio 54 and the Mudd Club, Carangi usually used cocaine in clubs. After her agent, mentor, and friend Wilhelmina Cooper, died of lung cancer in March 1980, a devastated Carangi began using drugs and developed an addiction to heroin. Carangi's addiction soon began to affect her work; she had violent temper tantrums, walked out of photo shoots to buy drugs, and fell asleep in front of the camera. Scavullo recalled a fashion shoot with Carangi in the Caribbean when \"she was crying, she couldn't find her drugs. I literally had to lay her down on her bed until she fell asleep.\" During one of her final location shoots for American Vogue, Carangi had red bumps in the crooks of her elbows where she had injected heroin. Despite airbrushing, some of the photos, as published in the November 1980 issue, reportedly still showed visible needle marks.\n\nIn November 1980, Carangi left Wilhelmina Models and signed with Ford Models, but she was dropped within weeks. By then, her career was in a steep decline. Modeling offers soon ceased and her fashion industry friends, including Sandy Linter, refused to speak to her, fearing their association with her would harm their careers. In an attempt to quit using drugs, she moved back to Philadelphia with her mother and stepfather in February 1981. Carangi underwent a 21-day detox program, but her sobriety was short-lived. She was arrested in March 1981 after she drove into a fence in a suburban neighborhood. After a chase with police, she was taken into custody where it was later determined she was under the influence of alcohol and cocaine. After her release, Carangi briefly signed with a new agency, Legends, and worked sporadically, mainly in Europe.\n\nIn late 1981, although still using drugs, Carangi was determined to make a comeback in the fashion industry and signed with Elite Model Management. While some clients refused to work with her, others were willing to hire her because of her past status as a top model. Scavullo photographed her for the April 1982 cover of Cosmopolitan, her last cover appearance for an American magazine. Sean Byrnes, Scavullo's long-time assistant, later said, \"What she was doing to herself finally became apparent in her pictures. ... I could see the change in her beauty. There was an emptiness in her eyes.\"\n\nCarangi then mainly worked with photographer Albert Watson and found work modeling for department stores and catalogs. She appeared in an advertising campaign for Versace, shot by Richard Avedon. He hired her for the fashion house's next campaign, but during the photo shoot, in late 1982, Carangi became uncomfortable and left before any useable shots of her were taken. Around this time, Carangi enrolled in an outpatient methadone program but soon began using heroin again. By the end of 1982, she had only a few clients that were willing to hire her. Carangi's final photo shoot was for German mail-order clothing company Otto Versand in Tunisia; she was sent home during the shoot for using heroin. She left New York for the final time in early 1983.\n\nDeath\n\nAs she had spent most of her modeling earnings on drugs, Carangi spent the final three years of her life with various lovers, friends, and family members in Philadelphia and Atlantic City. She was admitted to an intense drug treatment program at Eagleville Hospital in December 1984. After treatment, she got a job in a clothing store, which she eventually quit. She later found employment as a checkout clerk and then worked in the cafeteria of a nursing home. By late 1985, she had begun using drugs again and was engaging in sex work in Atlantic City.\n\nIn December 1985, Carangi was admitted to Warminster General Hospital in Warminster, Pennsylvania, with bilateral pneumonia. A few days later, she was diagnosed with AIDS-related complex. In the fall of 1986, Gia Carangi was hospitalized again after being found on the street badly beaten and raped. On October 18, she was admitted to Hahnemann University Hospital. Gia Carangi died at the Hahnemann Hospital of AIDS-related complications one month later on November 18, 1986, at the age of 26, becoming one of the first famous women to die of the disease. Her funeral was held on November 23 at a small funeral home in Philadelphia. No one from the fashion world attended. However, weeks later, Francesco Scavullo, Carangi's friend and confidant, sent a Mass card when he heard the news.\n\nLegacy\n\nCarangi is often considered to be the first supermodel, although that title has been applied to others, including Margaux Hemingway, Audrey Munson, Lisa Fonssagrives, Dorian Leigh, Twiggy, Jean Shrimpton, and Janice Dickinson. Model Cindy Crawford, who rose to prominence the year Carangi died, was referred to as \"Baby Gia\" because of her resemblance to Carangi. Crawford later recalled, \"My agents took me to all the photographers who liked Gia: Albert Watson, Francesco Scavullo, Bill King. Everyone loved her look so much that they gladly saw me.\" Additionally, Carangi, whose sexual orientation has been reported as either lesbian or bisexual, is considered a lesbian icon and is said to have \"epitomized lesbian chic more than a decade before the term was coined.\" Argentine model Mica Arga\u00f1araz has often been compared to Carangi, whom she considers a beauty icon.\n\nCarangi's life has been the subject of several works. A biography of Carangi by Stephen Fried titled Thing of Beauty\u2014taken from the first line of John Keats' famous poem Endymion\u2014was published in 1993. Gia, a biographical television film starring Angelina Jolie, debuted on HBO in 1998. Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance, among other accolades. A documentary titled The Self-Destruction of Gia, released in 2003, showcased footage of Carangi, contemporary interviews with Carangi's family and former colleagues, including Sandy Linter, and footage of actress-screenwriter Zo\u00eb Lund, herself a heroin addict, who had been commissioned to write a screenplay based upon Carangi's life at the time of her own death of drug-related causes in 1999.\n\nA biography of Carangi by Sacha Lanvin Baumann titled Born This Way: Friends, Colleagues, and Coworkers Recall Gia Carangi, the Supermodel Who Defined an Era, was published in 2015. Sondra Scerca, who brought Carangi to Wilhelmina, is currently writing a memoir titled GIA, WILLY and ME, which will be released in 2022. The AIDS Memorial Quilt contains one panel with Carangi's full name on it that only commemorates her, one panel that refers to her as Gia that only commemorates her, and one panel that refers to her as Gia and commemorates other people as well as her.\n\nDesigners and brands represented"}, {"url": "https://people.com/movies/angelina-jolie-gia-25th-anniversary-about-death-of-model-who-inspired-movie-gia-carangi/", "page_content": "It's been 25 years since Angelina Jolie starred as Gia Carangi in Gia.\n\nThe 1998 HBO television film featured a then-22-year-old Jolie as the real-life Carangi, who was considered by many the world's first supermodel.

Andrea Blanch/Getty\n\nCarangi was born Gia Marie Carangi in Philadelphia on Jan. 29, 1960, into a working-class family that included two older brothers. Her father Joseph Carangi, who was Italian, owned a restaurant, while her mother, Kathleen Carangi (n\u00e9e Adams), was a homemaker.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Carangi was discovered on the dance floor by a local photographer. Her first modeling gig for a major advertisement was with Versace, and she had become a well-known figure at Wilhelmina Models in New York City by 1980, according to The New York Times.\n\nBut throughout her catapult to fame, Carangi \u2014 who was one of the first openly gay models, Dazed reported \u2014 struggled with addiction and substance abuse, including of cocaine and heroin.\n\nBack in 2020, makeup artist Sandy Linter recalled to The Hollywood Reporter that she and Carangi had a romance in the late 1970s that \"was never a torrid sexual affair but we did love each other.\"\n\n\"I was just as shocked as anybody that she became an addict,\" Linter said. \"She thought she was stronger than the drugs. One morning, as she was getting dressed to leave my apartment she asked, 'What happened to my natural energy?' She didn't have the energy to get dressed at 20 years old. The drugs took everything.\"\n\nGia Carangi. Dustin Pittman/WWD/Penske Media via Getty\n\nAccording to Dazed, Carangi attempted several times to get clean, including going to rehab, but it never stuck. She was diagnosed with AIDS in December 1985, and died of related complications the following November.\n\nLinter told THR that the last time she saw Carangi was in 1983 or 1984, when the model rang her doorbell, then \"sat down on my couch with me, put her head on my shoulder and cried.\"\n\n\"It was the end of our 'romance.' I knew it and she knew it. Because she looked so good, I had been tricked into thinking that she was on the road to recovery,\" Linter said. \"I never knew she had AIDS until later. After maybe 30 minutes, she looked out the window, nodded to someone in the street and left. I would never see her again.\"\n\nMore than 35 years after Carangi's death, Gia is still beloved by fans, holding a Rotten Tomatoes score of 93%, with an Audience Score of 82%.\n\nAhead of the movie's release, Jolie, now 47, told The New York Times in 1997 that she initially \"hated\" Carangi while doing research about her, based on a 20/20 interview the model once did \u2014 but eventually changed her tune and thought, \"I'd like to date Gia. I'd want to be her lover.''\n\nAngelina Jolie (center) in Gia (1998). Larry Watson/Citadel Ent/Kobal/Shutterstock\n\nThe actress also told Entertainment Weekly at the time of her role that she \"definitely needed to learn the lessons Gia needed to learn.\"\n\n\"Especially feeling that the physical is more important than anything else, or that you're only as smart and good as somebody thinks you are,\" she said. \"It's been really important for me to look at myself in the mirror, and realize that I can't let myself go down like she did.\"\n\nJolie \u2014 who went on to win an Oscar for her performances in the following year's Girl, Interrupted alongside Winona Ryder \u2014 also said she wanted the audience \"to identify with Gia and see her as being just a regular girl.\"\n\n\"No matter how together or perfect some people may appear, they have their share of pain and a deep-down need for love \u2014 the same as everyone else,\" the actress added."}, {"url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/makeup-artist-sandy-linter-recalls-gia-carangi-romance-we-did-love-1297324/#!", "page_content": "Gia Carangi, often referred to as one of the world\u2019s first supermodels, is perhaps best known simply as Gia. She burst onto the scene in the late 1970s, traveled the world, posed for famous photographers, landed on the covers of Vogue and Cosmopolitan, and fronted campaigns for Dior, Versace and Yves Saint Laurent. While her life had all the elements one would expect of a fashion darling in New York, how it ended serves as the most cautionary of tales. Carangi died of AIDS in 1986 at the age of 26 after battling a heroin addiction that derailed her once white-hot career. Her story \u2014 told in HBO\u2019s Gia starring Angelina Jolie \u2014 continues to inspire headlines and an Instagram account with 11,500 followers. In honor of Pride month and in a year that would\u2019ve marked Carangi\u2019s 60th birthday, legendary makeup artist Sandy Linter opens up to The Hollywood Reporter about their surprise romance, a St. Barts getaway and the final time she saw her.\n\nI got booked for a photo shoot for Harper\u2019s Bazaar Italia in 1978 with one of the coolest photographers ever \u2014 Chris von Wangenheim \u2014 at the Citicorp Building, a new building at the time, which worked very well for Chris, who was into modern design. A few models walked in and there was Gia Carangi.\n\nShe sat down in the chair and immediately put her feet up on the makeup table. She picked up my punk sunglasses, put them on and lit up a cigarette. I could see all this out of the corner of my eye and I remember thinking, Oh, she\u2019s trouble. She\u2019s going to be trouble. That was the first time I saw her.\n\nWhen it came time to do Gia\u2019s makeup, I walked over to look at her face. She already had foundation on but it was applied very badly. I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s this? I\u2019ll have to take this off.\u201d She told me her agency said to come makeup ready because there would be a few girls on the shoot. It was a nice gesture but looked horrible. I\u2019ve actually heard over the years that she could do her own makeup and the truth is, no. Gia introduced herself and I couldn\u2019t pronounce her name at first. She laughed. I respected her charm and her edge.\n\nI stood behind Chris as I watched them both work. At one point, he gives Gia a nod and she drops the side of her dress from one shoulder to expose one of her breasts. He took the shot and it\u2019s fabulous. You could just see that she\u2019s a star. She had power. This was 1978 and that was not a move fashion models were doing back then. Nudity was allowed in European magazines but not in America, really. Still, Gia and Chris obviously had worked something out and she was going for it. She had a saying that she was always ready to go for the \u201cgusto.\u201d\n\nI was booked to do a shoot for American Vogue with Chris and with Gia and another model named Lisa Vale. Chris was married to a drop-dead gorgeous model named Regine Jaffry. When I approached the building of CVW\u2019s studio, Regine was outside. She asked me a weird question: \u201cHow much do you weigh?\u201d I told her 99 lbs. and went inside, not thinking much of it. I did Gia and Lisa Vales\u2019 makeup. It was a nice shoot. Chris photographed them against a wire fence, similar to one you would see in a playground.\n\nAfter the shoot, I was packing up my makeup, ready to leave and Chris came back into the room. He said, \u201cI\u2019m doing a personal photo, will you do it?\u201d I agreed and he came back and said, \u201cWith Gia?\u201d I said OK again, he left the room only to come right back with another question: \u201cNude?\u201d I was freaking out a bit. What did I get myself into? I had just come back from a summer at Fire Island Pines, where we were all mostly nude or topless. It was 1978!\n\nI just told him I would keep my boots on because I was so short and that would make me feel better. When I walked on set, the stylist yelled, \u201cShe has her boots on!\u201d Chris didn\u2019t care. I figured I would just be a prop \u2014 someone in the shadows, never really seen and only there so Gia would have someone to respond to. When Gia walked out on set, she climbed the fence and was doing some very punk rock moves. I had a vision in my mind of the very glamour photos that Helmut Newton would do featuring two women. That\u2019s what I started doing and Gia followed my lead.\n\nI have a feeling that Regine was supposed to do the shoot but backed out last minute, so they asked me. These are just my thoughts after so many years. These photos that can never be duplicated, not in movies or photos, and I am proud to be a part of history as, unfortunately, I am the only one now living. Chris died in a car crash in 1981. Before his death, he gave me two autographed prints that I treasure.\n\nThe day after the shoot, late in the afternoon, my phone rang and it was Gia. She had a very different tone of voice. She sounded like she was coming on to me. I can\u2019t imitate it now but it was sexy. She said she was driving around in this hot red car and asked if I wanted to go for a ride. I mean what do you say? Who drives a car in Manhattan? She picked me up and we drove around, stopping in front of Fiorucci. She ran inside and got one ear pierced and I was just along for the ride.\n\nOne thing I quickly discovered about Gia is that she did not want to be alone. There\u2019s a lot of people out there who think they know her better than I did and so they say she was a loner. They are wrong. During the day, she worked with the best people in the business, but let\u2019s face it, at the end of the day, everybody went their separate ways. At night she did not want to be alone and she was just 19 years old alone in New York. She had her own apartment but she ended up staying with me a lot because she liked me and because she wanted the closeness of having a girlfriend. She would bring me flowers and she phoned me often. It was never a torrid sexual affair but we did love each other. This never happened again with a woman in my lifetime. So it\u2019s a difficult relationship to label. We spent a lot of time together, going to clubs, restaurants, just out all the time. We had chemistry. I got her. I didn\u2019t pry. I got her moods, and she felt safe with me.\n\nI was just as shocked as anybody that she became an addict. She thought she was stronger than the drugs. One morning, as she was getting dressed to leave my apartment she asked, \u201cWhat happened to my natural energy?\u201d She didn\u2019t have the energy to get dressed at 20 years old. The drugs took everything. She thought she could go home to her mother\u2019s house on weekends to clean up and then come back to the city but that never worked.\n\nI want all the guys and girls out there, her fans, to know that Gia finally knew that drugs are not the answer. But it was too late. I\u2019m not saying that I avoided drugs completely, but there was something unappealing about shooting up. It was the \u201980\u2019s and people were always offering me something to snort and it was like, \u201cOK, fine.\u201d They were party drugs back then. We partied, we snorted, we went to the Mudd Club and Hurrah. I always thought I was given cocaine and a couple of times it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it was heroin. That was a different high and I liked it but it wasn\u2019t worth the headache I had the next morning.\n\nOne morning after going out to a club, I heard Gia on the phone in the kitchen. I was surprised that she was up because she didn\u2019t like to get up in the morning. She asked me if she should go to work that day. I said, \u201cNot if you feel the way I do!\u201d It wasn\u2019t until years later that I learned she had stood up a TV crew with Richard Avedon as director. What a stupid thing to tell her. Gia was a supermodel and it was not a rational thing to say to her because she had a job to do. The job paid $5,000 and beautiful model Rosie Vela took her place. That\u2019s what happens when you do drugs, bad things. They happened so often for Gia; soon she had fewer and fewer bookings.\n\nWe had good times, too. We went to St. Barts together, which was not yet the place to be, like it is today. I mean, she was adorable. She took a teddy bear on the flight, flirting with the female flight attendants. When we landed, I wasn\u2019t feeling well. I was \u201con the rag\u201d with severe cramps. She immediately sprung into action, renting a Jeep and driving us over the hilly terrain of the small island. We stopped once to ask for directions from a guy in his backyard. He was visibly moved when he saw Gia, who was wearing men\u2019s shorts and an undershirt. She had that effect on everyone. I\u2019m sure he never forgot her.\n\nIt must\u2019ve been like that all her life. No makeup, just a natural beauty. It didn\u2019t matter what she wore. The fact that she loved women was just a part of that. Thinking about where she would be in her life today with the LGBTQ community, her pride would have evolved. Gia was always proud. She never apologized to anyone for who she loved or who she had sex with. I think back to how she died of AIDS and how, at that time, there was such a stigma to it. I didn\u2019t know her when she was sick or dying. I didn\u2019t even know she was sick.\n\nSometime around 1983 or \u201984, my doorbell rang. It was Gia, just standing there and smiling. She had on a yellow cashmere sweater \u2014 her favorite. She sat down on my couch with me, put her head on my shoulder and cried. My shirt was dripping wet with tears. I kept telling her how well she looked and wondered why she was crying. It was the end of our \u201cromance.\u201d I knew it and she knew it. Because she looked so good, I had been tricked into thinking that she was on the road to recovery. I never knew she had AIDS until later. After maybe 30 minutes, she looked out the window, nodded to someone in the street and left. I would never see her again.\n\nTowards the end, I connected with her on the phone a few times because we had drifted apart. Once I read an article in the New York Times and I tried to tell her to be careful because it said that IV drug users, including women, were getting sick. She was very quiet. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop this. This is real. This is a plague,\u201d I told her. She only wanted to talk about lively things, but I was taking a tough-love stance. I had to let her know that I had terms and I was worried that AIDS was going to kill her. Maybe a part of her felt it was already too late. I don\u2019t know. There is so much I will never know.\n\nThe most important thing now is that she left a legacy. Millions of people are captivated by her and I understand that. She was a one-of-kind. Just a proud kid I will always remember for sitting down at my makeup table, putting her feet up and grabbing my sunglasses. She was that kind of girl \u2014 so secure and confident."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Gia-Carangi/6000000182703070844", "page_content": "About Gia Carangi\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gia_Carangi\n\nGia Marie Carangi (January 29, 1960 \u2013 November 18, 1986) was an American model, considered by many to be the first woman to be titled as supermodel.
