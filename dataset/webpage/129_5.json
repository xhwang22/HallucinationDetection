{"Frederick Thomas Brentnall was particularly noted for his work in the Arts and Crafts style.": [{"url": "https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/brentnall-frederick-thomas-3050", "page_content": "by Ronald Lawson\n\nFrederick Thomas Brentnall (1834-1925), Wesleyan minister, journalist, company director and politician, was born on 17 June 1834 at Riddings, Derbyshire, England, eldest of the twelve children of George Brentnall, builder, and his wife Mary, n\u00e9e Clarke. He was educated at an endowed school in Alfreton, near Derby. He entered business in Ripley, Derbyshire, but in 1863 was sent to join the Wesleyan Conference of New South Wales and Queensland. After serving on several circuits in New South Wales, in April 1873 he joined the Brisbane circuit, where he quickly made an impact as a forceful and eloquent preacher. He became chairman of the Queensland district, where he was prominent in the formation of a strong loan fund which was to prove important in extending Wesleyan Methodist work in Queensland. He served also in the circuits of Fortitude Valley and Ipswich, and at the Ann Street Church in Brisbane, before a throat infection forced him to retire from the ministry in 1883.\n\nIn 1875, towards the climax of the education controversy in Queensland, Brentnall was instrumental with three other clergymen in establishing the Queensland Evangelical Standard, a journal dedicated to a system of secular education, and thus anti-Catholic in tone. Viewing the 'squatting party' as allies of the Catholics, the Standard adopted a clear political posture, championed the cause of (Sir) Samuel Griffith, a Liberal and son of a Congregational cleric, and poured invective on 'Land Rings and Railway Kings'. Brentnall used his pen with telling effect against the McIlwraith ministry in its handling of the steel rails contract of 1881 and soon afterwards of the land-grant railway proposal.\n\nBrentnall's activity in the business world seems to have been recognized as early as 1881. The Daily Observer, 28 February, openly attacked him in an advertisement: 'Wanted for the Christian Ministry \u2026 Special advantages are now offered to worldly-minded men to join the ranks \u2026 Men of business turn of mind specially eligible for this ministry, and always come to the front. \u201cFervency of spirit\u201d not at all necessary. Shareholders in gold mines, tin mines, newspaper companies, land speculating, and such like heavenly pastures, will always be accepted as specially qualified'. The Standard, smarting under the sarcasm, responded so sharply that its reply led to a libel case. On his retirement from the church Brentnall joined the Telegraph, in which he was a minor shareholder, as a journalist. In 1885 he greatly increased his holdings in the company and became chairman of directors, a position he retained until May 1893, after which he continued to hold a large financial interest. He became increasingly active in business affairs, his directorships included the Queensland Deposit Bank and Building Society, and the Queensland Trustees (later becoming chairman of directors of both companies), Queensland General Insurance, Finney Isles, Coolgarra Tin Mining, Queensland Exploration and Queensland Copper Freeholds. He speculated widely, sometimes successfully, sometimes disastrously, in Queensland mining ventures. He was one of the earliest settlers and landholders at Coorparoo and sold some of his blocks in the boom year of 1888 as it began to emerge as a prestige suburb. He was a member of the Bulimba Divisional Board and for two years first chairman of the Coorparoo Shire Council, where he acted also as shire clerk in 1888-92. In 1886 he had been nominated to the Legislative Council, where he remained active until it was abolished in 1922; in 1893-1902 he was chairman of committees. His political views had gradually become more conservative since the Standard days, especially after the rise of the Labor Party, of which he was an uncompromising enemy. He vigorously opposed 'advanced' legislation and abolition of the Legislative Council. He became a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia (Queensland). He maintained his interest in church life, served on church committees, made settlements on various Methodist institutions, giving them an annual income, and in his will left substantial sums to the Methodist Church.\n\nIn 1867 he married Elizabeth Watson, daughter of a store-keeper in Mansfield, Nottingham. She had left her position as headmistress of a large Wesleyan day school for girls at Bacup, Lancashire, and followed Brentnall to Sydney to marry him. She was the first president of the Queensland Women's Christian Temperance Union, holding office in 1885-99, and then honorary president until her death in 1909. Brentnall died in Brisbane on 11 January 1925, survived by two daughters: Flora, who in 1893 married Edgar Bridal Harris, a shipping agent, and Charlotte Amelia. He left substantial holdings in the Telegraph Newspaper Co. to his family, and his grandson later became chairman of directors."}, {"url": "https://www.howold.co/person/frederick-thomas-brentnall/biography", "page_content": "Frederick Thomas Brentnall Biography\n\nAustralian businessman and politician\n\nHon.

The movement didn't necessarily encompass one style, but it did have far-reaching effects. Take, for instance, the Craftsman-style house \u2014 a direct result of the movement coming to the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs independent scholar Monica Obniski writes for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the movement's designers wanted to \"create an environment in which beautiful and fine workmanship governed.\" In order to drive home this ethos, many of the era's most iconic figures not only designed items, they also became part of collectives and exhibitions that shone a spotlight on this work.\n\nVideo of the Day\n\nHere are just a few of the most important figures from the arts and crafts movement:\n\n1. William Morris\n\nMost major histories of the arts and crafts movement name one key figure: William Morris. Born in 1834 in East London, Morris spearheaded the resistance to mass-produced items. Along with a few other influential figures \u2014 like mathematician Charles Faulkner and civil engineer Peter Paul Marshall \u2014 Morris helped found the firm and interiors company Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. It later became Morris & Company, and Morris continued on a prolific streak. He designed everything from rugs to tapestries to wallpaper designs. His writing also focused on the importance of handicrafts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. M.H. Baillie Scott\n\nManxman Pianoforte designed by Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott Image Credit: Wikimedia Commons / Sailko\n\nAccording to the Victoria and Albert Museum, Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott believed that \"furniture should appear to grow out of the requirements of the room.\" Born in 1865, he contributed to the arts and crafts movement as both an architect and designer. One of his most famous architectural projects: the Blackwell House, originally designed as a holiday home. Located in Cumbria, England, the house includes details like carved stone, mosaic floors, wall hangings, and plaster work, according its official site. It is currently open to the public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. May Morris\n\nWhile William Morris dominates most conversations about the history of the arts and crafts movement, his daughter May Morris made some important contributions as well. Born in 1862, she studied at the National Art Training School and joined Morris and Company at 23 years old, according to Thames & Hudson. In fact, the \"Honeysuckle\" wallpaper pattern, often attributed to William, is her design. In 1896, May struck out on her own and started an embroidery workshop; she also exhibited her work through the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society. In 1907, she founded the Women's Guild of Arts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. C.F.A. Voysey\n\nBlock-printed silk textile by Charles Francis Annesley Voysey Image Credit: Wikimedia Commons / Los Angeles County Museum of Art\n\nArchitect and designer Charles Francis Annesley Voysey (a.k.a. C.F.A. Voysey) created everything from wallpapers to fabrics to homes. Born in 1857, he often used stylized nature patterns in his work. While there are debates about which era or style he fits into specifically, it's still worth noting his contributions to the arts and crafts era. While he often stuck to traditionalist design values, his focus on simple yet impactful design particularly influenced the next generation of architects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Susan Stuart Frackelton\n\nStoneware jar by Susan Stuart Frackelton Image Credit: Wikimedia Commons / Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nSusan Stuart Frackelton helped to elevate the medium of ceramics as part of the arts and crafts movement. Born in 1848, she made her mark through her pained china and stoneware pieces \u2014 as well as her patents for a portable gas kiln. She encouraged other makers by founding the Milwaukee Artist's Association in 1887, creating the National League of Mineral Painters in 1892, and publishing the highly praised handbook Tried by Fire: A Work on China-Painting. Her work earned her numerous awards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Gustav Stickley\n\nArmchair by Gustav Stickley, circa 1907-1913. Image Credit: Wikimedia Commons / Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nYou'll often hear the name Gustav Stickley in histories of the arts and crafts movement, particularly in the U.S. Born in 1858, Stickley made an impact not only as a furniture designer but also as a thinker. A trip to Europe in 1895 influenced his own design and sparked his motivation to bring the arts and crafts attitude of simplicity to the States. He started the magazine The Craftsman in 1901; over the years it covered topics like gardening, political issues, and city planning. Looking back at Stickley's work and issues of the magazine creates a fuller picture of the arts and crafts in the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Charles Robert Ashbee\n\nCovered bowl by Charles Robert Ashbee. Image Credit: Wikimedia Commons / Daderot\n\nBorn in 1863, Charles Robert Ashbee embodied the arts and crafts movement's values of returning to a pre-industrialization craftsmanship. He founded the Guild of Handicraft in 1888 and it exhibited work everywhere from Vienna to Munich to England. The guild \u2014 and Ashbee \u2014 focused on metalwork, copper, and ironwork (as well as furniture). Ashbee often lectured on the importance of handicrafts; his contributions inspired the next generation of designers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Charles Rohlfs\n\nCharles Rohlfs designed stove parts while also working as an actor, eventually focusing on furniture design. Born in 1853, he exhibited his work across the United States and Europe. His furniture pieces won the praise of writers during the era for their artistic flourishes. Rohlfs drew inspiration from Asian art, art noveau style, and American architecture, to name a few. His work was praised again in 2009 with the traveling retrospective exhibition \"The Artistic Furniture of Charles Rohlfs.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. William Arthur Smith Benson\n\nCoffee pot designed by William Arthur Smith Benson Image Credit: Wikimedia Commons / Daderot\n\nWilliam Arthur Smith Benson (a.k.a. W.A.S. Benson) made a name for himself through his metalwork pieces. Born in 1858, he started his own workshop in 1880 and opened a shop in 1887. His innovative thinking led to impactful designs for both candles and electric light, according to Cooper Hewitt Design Museum. Benson contributed to the arts and crafts movement as a founding member of the Art Workers' Guild; he also made important efforts towards the creation of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society.\n\n10. Charles and Henry Greene\n\nThe Gamble House in Pasadena, California.

Born in 1868 and 1870, respectively, the brothers started their careers by studying fields like woodworking. Around the 1890s, they started their own firm \u2014 Greene & Greene in Pasadena, California.
