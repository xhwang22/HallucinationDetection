{"Clay timpani is a type of drum.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/art/timpani", "page_content": "timpani, (Italian: \u201cdrums\u201d) also spelled tympani, orchestral kettledrums. The name has been applied to large kettledrums since at least the 17th century. The permanent orchestral use of timpani dates from the mid-17th century, early examples being in Matthew Locke\u2019s Psyche (1673) and Jean-Baptiste Lully\u2019s opera Th\u00e9s\u00e9e (1675). At first they were mainly confined to expressions of rejoicing or to supporting the brass in loud passages. Two instruments, one tuned to the tonic and the other to the dominant (first and fifth notes of the scale), were normal in 17th- and 18th-century scores. Later, more instruments were used with a variety of tunings. In the 19th century the timpani were used in more varied and expressive ways, a development stimulated in large part by the innovations of Ludwig van Beethoven. The French composer Hector Berlioz, who required 16 kettledrums in his Grand Messe des morts (1837; Requiem), even urged composers to specify which type of hard or soft sticks they wished used.\n\nIn modern timpani the bowl-shaped shell is usually of copper or brass. The membrane, of calfskin or synthetic material, is secured by a metal hoop. Its tension is varied by hand screws fixed to the shell and acting on the hoop, or, more often, by one of several 19th- and 20th-century devices: pedal or hand mechanisms that control the tension by rods connected to the hoop. A hole is pierced at the bottom of the shell to avoid air concussion splitting the head in loud passages. The tone varies according to the texture of the head of the stick and the area of the membrane struck. Occasionally, composers specify using the fingers to set the membrane in vibration.\n\nBritannica Quiz Musical Instruments\n\nThe orchestral kettledrum has a practical compass of five full tones. The compass of a pair of timpani is normally an octave from F below middle C downward; for an orchestral set of three, the tuning ranges are generally c\u2013g, G\u2013d, and E\u266d\u2013B\u266d (g = the G below middle C; E\u266d = the second E\u266d below). Such composers as Igor Stravinsky and Gustav Mahler have extended this range. The expressive resources of the timpani include reiteration of persistent rhythms, dramatic crescendos, sudden stresses, and atmospheric rolls. Special effects include damped or muffled notes, striking a note with two sticks, pedal glissando (sliding pitch) on a roll, and muting by placing a cloth on the drumhead."}, {"url": "https://hellomusictheory.com/learn/facts-about-the-timpani/", "page_content": "By Robert Jackson\n\nTimpani are those large semi-spherical drums that look like big shiny bowls or upside-down tea-kettles\u2014which is why they\u2019re also called kettledrums.\n\nA classical percussion section would never be complete without timpani. They\u2019re important both in classical orchestras and musical ensembles, including concert, marching, and even rock and roll bands.\n\nThe sound of timpani can be energetic and thunderous, as well as smooth and velvety, which is why they\u2019re considered extremely versatile.\n\nTo help acquaint you with this fascinating percussive instrument, here are 20 interesting facts about the timpani.\n\n1. The Timpani is a Pitched Percussion Instrument\n\nModern pedal timpani can be instantly tuned through a movable foot pedal to adjust the tension of the head as well as the pitch.\n\nAlthough convenient, that could still pose a challenge during a concert, since it\u2019ll require the timpanist to have a perfect ear to keep the instrument in key with the rest of the ensemble.\n\nTuning a chain timpani, which is much less common nowadays, is even more difficult since they don\u2019t have pedals.\n\nInstead, they have a roller chain and a crank.\n\n2. The Timpani Were Initially Military Drums\n\nArabian Naqqara\n\nTimpani started as military drums.\n\nTheir use dates back to the 13th century when they were introduced to Europe by crusaders who brought similar but much smaller Arabian Naqqara.\n\nBefore timpani came to be a staple instrument in the classical orchestra by the last third of the 18th century, they were used in military ceremonies throughout Europe until the 16th century.\n\nThey were even used during the American Civil war where they were played by musicians on horseback.\n\nIn the late 19th century, modern machine timpani were developed for easier adjustment of drumhead tension.\n\n3. The Timpani Has a Wide Range of Sounds\n\nTimpani produce a wide dynamic range of sounds.\n\nTheir various sounds could best be described as dull, thunderous, rumbling, booming, deep, heavy, powerful, round, mellow, velvety, substantial, resonant, dry, or hollow.\n\nThe timbre of the timpani is affected by what the mallets are made of, where the head is struck, and how hard it\u2019s struck.\n\nThe purest tone is produced from the middle of a timpani drum.\n\n4. Timpani Belong to the Percussion Family\n\nThe percussion family is the largest in the orchestra, and timpani are a central part of it because they support rhythm, add melody and color, and enhance harmony.\n\nThe timpani, along with the xylophone and piano, are percussion instruments that are tuned and can sound different notes.\n\nThe bass drums, cymbals, and castanets are examples of untuned percussion instruments with no definite pitch.\n\n5. Timpani Have a Wide Pitch Range\n\nEach timpano (the singular or timpani) has a tonal range of about an interval of a sixth, with the pitch of the lower note dependant on its size.\n\nIn a four-timpani set, the range of pitch of the four drums can therefore span around 3 octaves!\n\n6. Timpani Are Traditionally Made of Copper\n\nTimpani sets today come in a host of materials, including fiber-reinforced plastic and aluminum.\n\nHowever, the traditional copper remains the best material for the bowl since it keeps the timpani in tune more effectively, and resists temperature changes.\n\nCopper also has properties that allow it to easily stretch and shape, and allows sound to resonate deeply.\n\n7. Animal Skins are Preferred for Timpani Heads\n\nTypically, timpani heads used to cover the bowl are made of calfskin or goatskin.\n\nAlthough costly, professional timpanists prefer these skins for the warmer quality of sound they produce.\n\nHeads are also often made of plastic, which is more durable, more affordable, and less affected by temperature and humidity than animal skin.\n\n8. There Are Two Styles of Timpani Placement\n\nIn German-speaking countries, including Germany and Austria, large timpani are usually placed at the right side of the timpanist with smaller timpani to the left, increasing the pitch from right to left.\n\nInternationally, especially in Japan, the direction of the timpani is reversed so that the pitch increases from left to right, similar to a piano keyboard.\n\n9. Timpanists Are Very Well Paid\n\nTimpanists are some of the highest-earning musicians in the music industry.\n\nTheir role is central in an orchestra, and there are few of them due to the difficulty of the instrument.\n\nOf course, the more skilled and experienced a timpanist is, the higher their earning potential, especially in performing arts companies or professional symphonies.\n\nIn the US, it\u2019s reported that the median salary for a timpanist is just under $50,000 a year with some paid well over $100k a year too!\n\n10. Timpani are Very Expensive Instruments\n\nBuying a quality set of timpani could cost you. Prices vary depending on factors like brand, size, and material.\n\nA timpani set can take up to two years to build and could cost an average of $12,000-$17,000.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to be careful while moving them around to avoid costly damages.\n\n11. Timpani Are Heavy\n\nTimpani are among the largest and heaviest musical instruments.\n\nA single timpani drum can weigh up to 140 lbs\u2026\n\nMultiply that by 4 or 5 for a whole set, and you\u2019ve got a challenge on your hands.\n\nTransporting these drums can be difficult and it\u2019ll give you a good workout.\n\n12. There Are Many Different Styles of Timpani\n\nTimpani come in various shapes and sizes.\n\nThere\u2019s a cambered type with a flat bottom like a pot, and a parabolic type that\u2019s nearly hemispherical.\n\nGenerally, the smaller the drums, the higher the pitches.\n\nThe timbre is also decided by where the drum head is stricken.\n\n13. Different Timpani Mallets Give Different Sounds\n\nThere are different categories of mallets used for striking the timpani, including hard, medium-hard, soft, flannel, and wood.\n\nEach kind is used according to the sheet music to express different sounds.\n\nThey come in various sizes, weights, coverings, and lengths of handles.\n\nThe mallet tip is often made out of felt, flannel, or cork, with a bamboo or wood handle.\n\nFelt ball mallets result in a soft attack, while wood balls produce a sharp attack and greater volume.\n\nMany professional musicians prefer to make their own mallets to customize them according to their needs.\n\n14. There Are Different Grips For The Timpani Mallet\n\nTwo common grips for the timpani mallet are the German grip and the French grip.\n\nIn the German grip, the palm is almost parallel with the drum head with the thumb on the side of the mallet.\n\nIn the French grip, the palm is almost perpendicular with the drum head and the thumb is on top of the mallet.\n\nThe American grip is a combination of both.\n\n15. Timpani Go Into All Kinds of Contemporary Music\n\nMusic created by timpani has a lengthy repertoire; it has invaded many rock and roll bands, as well as pop music.\n\nFrom the Beach Boys, Queen, The Beatles, and Emerson, to Led Zeppelin, timpani have taken pride of place in the 60s-70s pop-rock music.\n\nThey\u2019re also featured in electronic music!\n\nSounds created by the timpani are versatile, and stand out in any music style or genre.\n\n16. Playing the Timpani Can Be Tricky But Fun\n\nPlaying the timpani might seem easy\u2014the rhythms are simple, and you often play only a couple of notes\u2014but in reality, there\u2019s so much technique involved.\n\nYou need a very strong musical ear to successfully tune and play your timpani.\n\nYou also need to know how to maintain your drums and mallets to ensure a longer lifespan for them.\n\nOnce you get the hang of it, playing the timpani is so much fun.\n\n17. Playing the Timpani Requires Sensitivity Over Strength\n\nIt\u2019s often thought that playing a large musical instrument like the timpani requires a lot of physical strength, but that\u2019s not true.\n\nIn fact, a large volume of sound can be given through the drum reverberations, using only a little amount of force.\n\nAll you need is to create vibration as naturally as you can.\n\nIt actually takes a lot of sensitivity to create soft sounds and maintain a steady tempo.\n\n18. The Largest Timpani in the World is in Bali\n\nThe largest timpani in the world is in Bali.\n\nAt 73 inches in tall and 63 inches in diameter, the Moon of Pejeng is an ancient kettledrum that is thought to date back to 300 BC.\n\nIt has a story attached to it too, with a Balinese legend claiming that this drum was one of the wheels of a chariot on which they pulled the moon through sky until it fell to earth.\n\nWrap-Up\n\nAs you can see, a timpanist\u2019s job isn\u2019t an easy one.\n\nWhile playing the timpani isn\u2019t easy at first, it sure is fun when you get the hang of it.\n\nWe hope the 20 facts we\u2019ve shared in this post have inspired you to delve deeper into the world of percussive instruments and enjoy some fascinating timpani solos and ensembles."}, {"url": "https://takelessons.com/blog/guide_to_different_types_of_drums_z07", "page_content": "If you\u2019re interested in learning drums, you\u2019ve probably learned a little bit about the drums that make up a drum kit.

Here\u2019s a table of contents for finding your way around this guide:\n\nHow Many Types of Drums Are There?\n\nThere are countless different drums instrument types and variations for you to choose from. In general, however, drums can be categorized into one of the following groups:\n\n\n\nDrum sets\n\nHand drums\n\nFrame drums\n\nAfrican drums\n\nMarching band drums\n\nKeep reading to learn about the many types of drums!\n\nTypes of Drum Sets\n\nLet\u2019s begin our journey on some familiar ground, and explore some different types of drum sets, to help explain each type we have included drums image for each category.\n\nAcoustic Drum Set\n\nYou\u2019re probably most familiar with this type of drum set, but there are lots of variations in size and configuration.\n\nIn most acoustic drum sets, you will find drums such as\n\nSnare drum \u2013 This is placed in the center of the drummer and offers a distinctive cracking sound when struck. There are several snare drums types , each of which can be added to create a different style of music.\n\nBass drum \u2013 This can be operated with a beater or kick pedal.\n\nFloor tom \u2013 the floor tom is the second-largest drum in an acoustic set, second only to a bass darm. It has a low booming sound with a deep tone.\n\nRack tom \u2013 This type of drum has an open, resonating sound with a defined tone.\n\nMost acoustic sets will also contain a mash-up of other equipment like pedals, percussion instruments (like cowbells and tambourines) and cymbals.\n\nAcoustic drum sets can be further classified as follows.\n\nPower/Rock: These sets generally have 12, 13, and 16-inch toms, and a 22 x 18-inch bass drum. The snare may vary in size, but it\u2019s typically 5 \u00bd or 6 x 14\u2033. They have a deeper tone and more volume due to their larger sizes.\n\nThese sets generally have 12, 13, and 16-inch toms, and a 22 x 18-inch bass drum.

Jazz Drums: These are supposed to be quick and light, and the toms usually have the same diameter as the fusion toms\u2014but with shallower depths, and the bass drum is markedly smaller; usually 18\u201d x 14\u201d. Some well-known brands include Gretsch, Yamaha, Ludwig, Pearl, Sonor, Mapex, DW, OCDP, Pacific, Tama, and Crush. There are also several options for variations in configuration.\n\nVirtual and Electronic Drum Kits: Electronic drum sets give you access to an unbelievable library of sonic options. Over the years, their \u201cbrains\u201d have become more advanced. You have a wide array of sounds with samples from top-of-the-heap kits. Additionally, you have capabilities of percussion and beyond. These kits are available in range from very basic to professional. They have the ability to work with interactive software and apps to provide everything from tutorials to packs of sounds. E-kits are very cool and a lot of fun. If you\u2019re interested in buying an E-Kit, I recommend checking out Roland, Yamaha, and Alesis.\n\nTriggers: I would be remiss not to visit the world of triggering, which allows you to reap the benefits (feel and resonance) of your acoustic kit and the brains of the V-kit by adding triggers, which touch the heads of your drums and relay signals to a module (brain) to add to your sonic capabilities. They can be particularly handy in recording/live applications to enhance and clarify your sound or to provide backing tracks.\n\nI would be remiss not to visit the world of triggering, which allows you to reap the benefits (feel and resonance) of your acoustic kit and the brains of the V-kit by adding triggers, which touch the heads of your drums and relay signals to a module (brain) to add to your sonic capabilities.

Let us know in the comments below!"}, {"url": "https://www.yamaha.com/en/musical_instrument_guide/timpani/structure/structure003.html", "page_content": "The two pedal systems used in pedal timpani are the locking system and the balanced action system.\n\nThere are two kinds of locking mechanisms, ratchet and clutch. The position of the pedal is mechanically locked with very little slippage, making it the choice of professional performers such as those playing in orchestras.\n\n\n\nThe advantage of balanced action systems, which are often used in schools and brass bands, is that they are easy to operate. There is no locking mechanism, and the pitch can be changed quickly just by moving the pedal up and down, for seamless adjustment anywhere. This is very useful when playing pieces that require frequent changes in pitch."}, {"url": "https://littlecornerofamusiclover.com/timpani-vs-bass-drum/", "page_content": "If you are wondering about \u201cWhat is the difference between timpani and bass drum?\u201d So let\u2019s read this article from beginning to end to get valuable information now!\n\nTimpani vs. Bass Drum: Comparison Table\n\nThe drum is a hollow, open cylinder (the body) with a membrane (the head) stretched over both or one of the openings. It is one of the most familiar and ancient musical instruments, which are common in most human cultures.\n\nNowadays, drums come in various types, such as snare drums, bass drums, kettledrums, tenor drums, and side drums. All of them are important to a gig.\n\nNow, we will discuss timpani (or kettledrum) and bass drum and learn about the difference between the two.

Its heads may be made from plastic and calfskin.\n\nThe bass drum is available in various sizes, but the size doesn\u2019t dictate the volume it produces.\n\nTimpani\n\nTimpani, or kettledrum, is an instrument belonging to the percussion family.\n\nIt is also known as the hemispherical drum with a body similar to a sphere\u2019s section whose cut conforms to the head.\n\nMany modern kettle drums are made from fiberglass, although most were previously made with bronze or copper bodies.\n\nHow to play\n\nBass Drum\n\nDrummers play the bass drum by hitting the drumhead with sticks that feature large soft heads, often covered with felt or sheepskin.\n\nTimpani\n\nDrummers play timpani by striking its head with a special drumstick named a timpani mallet or timpani stick. Drummers can also use various mallets, varying in composition and hardness.\n\nMost kettledrums are pedal kettledrums, allowing drummers to tune accurately and quickly to specific pitches using a movable foot pedal.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBass Drum\n\nThe bass drum is the biggest member of the percussion family, making the lowest sounds. It produces a boom and low sound when the drummer uses the mallet to hit the drumhead.\n\nIn marches, people use it to project tempo. It will also provide the beat and keep the players in step.\n\nTimpani\n\nThe kettledrum is unique as you can tune it, as it\u2019s a variable-pitch percussion instrument. People generally use timpani in sets of two or more.\n\nThere are some special effects possible with a kettledrum, and the most notable is \u201cGlissando,\u201d which is available only on drums with a pedal.\n\nMost orchestras come with four kettledrums of different sizes, allowing a musician to tune to different pitches.\n\nAlso, timpani players must have an excellent ear as they typically need to change the pitches of the drums during their gigs.\n\nFunction\n\nBass Drum\n\nBass drums can be used in several musical genres. In addition, the role can also be different for different types of bass drum.\n\nFor example, concert bass drums are typically heard or seen in ensemble, orchestral, etc.\n\nMeanwhile, pitched drums are generally used in drum corps and marching bands and are usually played in a set of three to six drums.\n\nTimpani\n\nToday, we can use timpani in a wide range of ensembles, such as marching bands, concert bands, orchestras, and some rock bands.\n\nTimpani vs. Bass Drum: Which One Is Better?\n\nThere is no answer to this question because no one is better than the other. Both have essential roles in a gig, contributing to a drummer\u2019s performance.\n\nIt means their roles are not interchangeable.

Feel free to use it on your own site, if you\u2019d like. Please link back to Drumming Review.\n\nAs seen above, the non-extended collar variant of the lowest drum reaches D2, while the extended can go low as C2.\n\nWhat Notes Sound \u201cGood?\u201d\n\nThe range on paper is one thing, but the tone is another. Just because a 26\u2033 drum can play a Bb2, it won\u2019t necessarily sound the greatest since it\u2019s the lowest pitch the drum can output.\n\nIn that example, you should strive to play the Bb2 on the 29\u2033 drum, as the skin has more tension and a fuller, warmer sound.\n\nTuning Timpani Drums to Their Range\n\nWhen tuning, set the correct range by matching the lowest note according to the drum.\n\nIf your timpani is out of range, your pedal may slip and will not hold pitch properly. In some cases, the head will stretch too much and lose resilience quicker.\n\nAny timpani heads with dents or tears need replacement \u2014 they will not hold a pitch generally.\n\nFour Timpani Drum Configuration The standard set of timpani kettle drums consists of four graduated sizes: 32\u2033\n\n29\u2033\n\n26\u2033\n\n23\u2033 The sizes listed are generalized, as timpani drums aren\u2019t always standard.\n\nFive Timpani Drums Configuration\n\nIn some cases, there is a need for a fifth drum.\n\nThe sizes of the lower drums remain the same. Depending on taste, there is an addition of either a 20\u2033 or 21\u2033 drum.\n\nThe 21\u2033 timpani is far less common in the United States. I suspect unusual sizes only exist in professional orchestras.\n\nWhether to use the 20\u2033 or 21\u2033 is a continual and subjective debate between players.\n\nPitches above C4 tend to sound fuller and warmer on a 21\u2033 drum. Former principal percussionist Gordon Peters of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra notes in his book, The Drummer: Man, that he favors the 21\u2033 drum, noting a higher degree of flexibility.\n\nOther Sized Timpani Drums\n\nFor the high school setting, students only have access to the 23\u2033 and sometimes, the 20\u2033 kettle drum, but there are even smaller drums reserved for professional orchestras.\n\nAccording to PAS, there are specially sized drums that are small as 14\u2033 and 15\u2033 respectively. I scoured the internet for photos of the instruments but had no luck (if you do, I would love to see them. Please share!).\n\nAnd, for the 808 fans out there, there\u2019s even a 70\u2033 drum (I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m writing this).\n\nYou read right \u2014 a 70\u2033 timpani drum. Jonathan Haas built the world\u2019s biggest kettle drum, which produces a B flat two octaves below the lowest C on any existing timpani.\n\nThere\u2019s no practical use for this size of a drum, but hey, it\u2019s interesting nonetheless.\n\nChanging Heads on Timpani Drums\n\nThe collar of the drum usually poses an issue, so it\u2019s best always to measure the outside diameter of the old head if you\u2019re changing.\n\nRegular collars feature heads that are 1\u2033 larger than the drum\u2019s diameter. Extended collars have heads 2\u2033 larger.\n\nAs stated before, be sure to measure if you\u2019re unsure. Drum heads for kettle drums aren\u2019t the cheapest.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have access to the old heads anymore, check out this excellent guide put together by the team at Lonestar Percussion on replacing timpani heads."}, {"url": "https://www.yamaha.com/en/musical_instrument_guide/timpani/selection/", "page_content": "When choosing a timpani, it is necessary to think about not only the sound but also changing the pitch.\n\n\n\nWith hand-tightened timpani, changing the pitch takes time since each tuning bolt must be adjusted individually.\n\nHandle-type timpani can be adjusted more quickly since the tension of the head can be changed all at once by turning the handle to adjust the position of the hoop.\n\nPedal-type timpani allow the tension of the head to be adjusted by moving the pedal up and down, so it is possible to change the pitch even more quickly. What's more, pedals are operated with the feet, leaving the hands free to focus on the performance.

This material used to be a type of vellum or treated skin, but modern drums use a synthetic material. This top section is known as the \"drumhead\". Timpani is an Italian word. It is also a plural of the word timpano. However timpano is rarely used in informal English. More often, a timpano is referred to as a drum, a timpani, or simply a timp. Someone who plays a timpani is called a \"timpanist\".\n\nDifference from other drums [ change | change source ]\n\nTimpani are different from other drums because they are tuned to certain musical notes. A timpanist will often describe the drum as being \"in voice\" (or out of voice, as the case may be) when it is correctly tuned. To play it, it is hit with a special drumstick or \"timpani mallet\". Other drums that are used in orchestras and bands make a sound rather than a note, and are not tuned. A player normally sits with a group of two, three or four timpani around him, which is why the name timpani is in the plural.\n\nBrief history [ change | change source ]\n\nTimpani were originally used in official bands. They can still be seen in the bands of the modern official as in the Household Cavalry of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, in which the \"kettle drums\" (as they are called) are carried by large drumhorses. (See picture below) In the 1700s timpani became popular in orchestral music, and can be heard in the music of Handel, Beethoven and other 19th century composers wrote music that needed the timpani. Nowadays all large orchestras have timpani, and some bands that play popular music use them as well.\n\nDifferent ways timpani can be made [ change | change source ]\n\nA basic timpano timpani.\n\nThe drumhead [ change | change source ]\n\nA timpani drumhead, also called a timpani head, can be made out of two different things. Some are made out of animal skin, like calfskin or goatskin. Other ones can be made out of thick plastic. Because plastic heads are hard to break and do not cost as much as animal skin heads, they are used more often than animal skin heads. However, a lot of professional players prefer skin heads because they think that skin heads make a better sound when they are hit. The drumhead is stretched over the bowl of the timpani and held on by screws for tuning the timpani.\n\nA chain timpani.\n\nTuning the timpani [ change | change source ]\n\nThe screws that hold and tune the drumhead are called \"tension rods\". To tune the timpani, the \"tension rods\" can all be tightened or loosened. The timpani makes a higher sound if the tension rods are made tighter, and a lower sound if they are loosened. There are usually around seven tension rods on the timpani.[1]\n\nMachine timpani [ change | change source ]\n\nTuning a timpani by turning every tension rod by itself can be very hard, so some timpani makers invented different ways to change the drum's pitch more quickly.[2]\n\nChain timpani [ change | change source ]\n\nIn a chain timpani, the tension rods are all attached to a chain. This chain is hooked up to a lever, and when a player moves the lever back and forth, it tightens and loosens all the screws at the same time to change the pitch of the drum.[1]\n\nratchet clutch system. A pedal on a pedal timpani with asystem.\n\nPedal timpani [ change | change source ]\n\nA pedal timpani is a timpani that uses a pedal to change its pitch. It is the kind of timpani that is used the most today. A player can push on the pedal to make the timpani play higher notes, or let the pedal come back up to play lower notes.[1] There are three different kinds of pedal timpani:\n\nIn a ratchet clutch system a player must pull back a lever called a clutch to release the pedal. Once the pedal is in the spot where the player wants it, they must push the clutch forward with their foot again to lock it in place.\n\nsystem a player must pull back a lever called a to release the pedal. Once the pedal is in the spot where the player wants it, they must push the clutch forward with their foot again to lock it in place. A balanced action system uses a spring that is attached to the pedal, which keeps the pedal in one spot until it is moved by a player. Since the pedal is not held in one spot by a clutch in a balanced action system, some people call it a floating pedal because it looks like the pedal is not held on by anything and is floating.\n\nuses a spring that is attached to the pedal, which keeps the pedal in one spot until it is moved by a player. Since the pedal is not held in one spot by a clutch in a balanced action system, some people call it a because it looks like the pedal is not held on by anything and is floating. In a friction clutch system, the pedal is held in one spot by a clutch, and the clutch is attached to a pole. When a player releases the clutch, the pole moves up and down as the pedal is pushed up and down.\n\nTimpani mallets [ change | change source ]\n\nA set of timpani mallets.\n\nTimpani are played with a special kind of drumstick called timpani mallets. A player uses two mallets at a time when they play the drum. The two parts of the mallet are called the shaft and the head. The head is the part of the mallet that is shaped like a circle, and is the part that hits the timpani, and the shaft is the wooden part of the mallet that is held by a timpanist. A timpani mallet's head can be made out of many things, but is usually made out of a wood sphere that is covered with felt or a thin cloth. The shaft of the mallet is usually made out of wood, like hickory, cherry, or bamboo, but can also be made out of metal, like aluminum. Some timpani mallets do not have a felt head, and just have a wooden one. These mallets are sometimes used in classical and baroque music.[3][4]\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, some mallets had shafts made out of whale bones and heads made out of sponges.[5]\n\nWith a pedal timpani, a player can produce different sound effects using the pedals. Performing glissando on timpani demands switching the pedals. Glissando is generated by pressing the pedal during the vertebra. Furthermore it is possible to play glissando at any volume level up or down. For example, Alexander Rahbari, an outstanding Iranian-Austrian composer used glissando effect produced by switching timpani pedals in the opening of his piece, Persian Mysticism Around G, where the player moves from Bb up to C and then rolling down to G(see the timpani part on right below).[6]\n\nRelated pages [ change | change source ]\n\nOther websites [ change | change source ]"}, {"url": "https://en.audiolexic.org/wiki/Timpani", "page_content": "From AudioLexic\n\nTimpani are musical instruments in the percussion family. A type of drum, they consist of a skin called a head stretched over a large bowl commonly made of copper. They are played by striking the head with a specialized drum stick called a timpani stick or timpani mallet. Unlike most drums, they produce a definite pitch when struck. Timpani evolved from military drums to become a staple of the classical orchestra in the 17th century. Today, they are used in many types of musical ensembles including concert, marching, and even rock bands.\n\nTimpani is an Italian plural, the singular of which is timpano. However, this is rarely used in informal English speech as a timpano is typically referred to as a drum, a timpani, or simply a timp. Alternative spellings with y in place of either or both is \u2013 tympani, tympany, or timpany \u2013 are occasionally encountered in older English texts. This substitution is taken from the Latin word tympanum, from which the Italian word descends. A musician who plays the timpani is known as a timpanist. While the word timpani has been widely adopted in the English language, some English speakers choose to use the native word kettledrums. The German word for timpani is Pauken, and the French is timbales.\n\nedit] The instrument\n\nedit] The basic timpano\n\nThe basic timpano consists of a drumhead stretched across the opening of a bowl typically made of copper or, in less expensive models, fiberglass and sometimes aluminum. (By one system of classification, it is thus considered a membranophone.) The drumhead is affixed to a hoop (also called a fleshhoop), which in turn is held onto the bowl by a counterhoop, which is then held by means of a number of tuning screws called tension rods placed regularly around the circumference. The head's tension can be adjusted by loosening or tightening the rods. Most timpani have six to eight tension rods.\n\nThe shape of the bowl contributes to the tone quality of the drum. For example, hemispheric bowls produce brighter tones while parabolic bowls produce darker tones. Another factor that affects the timbre of the drum is the quality of the bowl's surface. Copper bowls may have a smooth, machined surface or a rough surface with many small dents hammered into it.\n\nTimpani come in a variety of sizes from about 84 centimeters (33 inches) in diameter down to piccolo timpani of 30 centimeters (12 inches) or less. A 33-inch drum can produce the C below the bass clef, and speciality piccolo timpani can play up into the treble clef. In Darius Milhaud's 1923 ballet score La cr\u00e9ation du monde, the timpanist must play the F sharp at the bottom of the treble clef.\n\nEach individual drum typically has a range of a perfect fifth to an octave.\n\nedit] Machine timpani\n\nChanging the pitch of a timpano by turning each tension rod individually is a laborious process. In the late 19th century, mechanical systems to change the tension of the entire head at once were developed. Any timpani equipped with such a system may be called machine timpani, although this term commonly refers to drums that use a single handle connected to a spider-type tuning mechanism.\n\n\n\n\n\nedit] Pedal timpani\n\nBy far the most common type of timpani used today are pedal timpani, which allow the tension of the head to be adjusted using a pedal mechanism. Typically, the pedal is connected to the tension screws via a spider-like system of metal rods.\n\nThere are three types of pedal mechanisms in common use today:\n\nThe ratchet-clutch system uses a ratchet and pawl to hold the pedal in place. The timpanist must first disengage the clutch before using the pedal to tune the drum. When the desired pitch is achieved, the timpanist must then reengage the clutch.\n\nsystem uses a ratchet and pawl to hold the pedal in place. The timpanist must first disengage the clutch before using the pedal to tune the drum. When the desired pitch is achieved, the timpanist must then reengage the clutch. In the balanced action system, a spring or hydraulic cylinder is used to balance the tension on the timpani head so that the pedal will stay in position and the head will stay at pitch. The pedal on a balanced action drum is sometimes called a floating pedal since there is no clutch holding it in place.\n\nsystem, a spring or hydraulic cylinder is used to balance the tension on the timpani head so that the pedal will stay in position and the head will stay at pitch. The pedal on a balanced action drum is sometimes called a since there is no clutch holding it in place. The friction clutch or post and clutch system uses a clutch that moves along a post. Disengaging the clutch frees it from the post, allowing the pedal to move without restraint.\n\nAny pedal drums that are tuned using the spider system can be called Dresden timpani, though the term is most often used for drums whose design is similar to the original pedal timpani built in Dresden (see below). Strictly speaking, a Dresden drum has a pedal that is attached at the player's side. The timpanist can move this pedal with ankle motion. A Berlin-style pedal is attached by means of a long arm to the opposite side of the drum, and the timpanist must use his entire leg to adjust the pitch.\n\nThe drums most professional timpanists use are Dresden timpani, commonly with a ratchet-clutch or friction clutch pedal. Most school bands and orchestras below the university level use cheaper, more durable timpani. The mechanical parts of these timpani are almost completely contained within the frame and bowl of the drum. They may use any of the pedal mechanisms, though the balanced action system is by far the most common, followed by the friction clutch system. Many professionals also use these drums for gigs and outdoor performances because of their durability.\n\nedit] Chain timpani\n\nOn chain timpani, the tension rods are connected by a roller chain much like the one found on a bicycle, though some manufacturers have used other materials, including steel cable. In these systems, all the tension screws can then be tightened or loosened by one handle. Though far less common than pedal timpani, chain and cable drums still have practical uses. Occasionally, a player is forced to place a drum behind other items so that he cannot reach it with his foot. Professional players may also use exceptionally large or small chain and cable drums for special low or high notes.\n\nedit] Other tuning mechanisms\n\nA rare tuning mechanism allows the pitch of the head to be changed by rotating the drum itself. A similar system is used on rototoms. Jenco, a company better known for mallet percussion, made timpani tuned in this fashion.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Hans Schnellar, then timpanist of the Vienna Philhamonic, developed a tuning mechanism in which the bowl is moved via a handle that connects to the base, and the head remains stationary. These drums are referred to as Viennese timpani (Wiener Pauken) or Schnellar timpani. Adams Musical Instruments developed a pedal-operated version of this tuning mechanism in the early 21st century.\n\nedit] Timpani heads\n\nLike most drumheads, timpani heads can be found made from two materials: animal skin (typically calfskin or goatskin) and plastic (typically PET film). Plastic heads are durable, weather resistant, and relatively inexpensive. Thus, they are more commonly used than natural skin heads. However, many professional players prefer skin heads because they feel the heads produce a warmer, better quality timbre.\n\nedit] Timpani sticks\n\nTimpani are typically struck with a special type of drumstick fittingly called a timpani stick or timpani mallet. Timpani sticks are used in pairs. They have two components: a shaft and a head. The shaft is typically made from wood \u2013 usually hickory, cherry, birch, persimmon, or maple \u2013 or bamboo, but may also be made from aluminum or graphite. The head of the stick can be constructed from a number of different materials, though felt wrapped around a wood core is the most common. Other core materials include felt and cork, and other wrap materials include leather. Sticks can also have exposed wood heads. These are used as a special effect and in authentic performances of Baroque music.\n\nAlthough it is not commonly written in the music, timpanists will change sticks \u2013 often many times within the same piece \u2013 to suit the nature of the music. However, choice of stick during performance is entirely subjective and depends on the timpanist's own preference, and occasionally, the wishes of the conductor. Thus, most timpanists own a great number of timpani sticks. The weight of the stick, the size of the head, the materials used for the shaft, core, and wrap, and the method used to wrap the head all contribute to the timbre the stick produces.\n\nIn the early 20th century and before, sticks were often made with whalebone shafts, wood cores, and sponge wraps. Composers of that era often specified sponge-headed sticks. Modern timpanists execute such passages with standard felt mallets.\n\nedit] Timpani in the modern ensemble\n\nedit] A set of timpani\n\nA standard set of timpani consists of four drums: roughly 80 cm (32 in), 75 cm (29 in), 66 cm (26 in), and 61 cm (23 in) in diameter. The range of this set is roughly the D below the bass clef to the top-line bass clef A. A great majority of the orchestral repertoire can be played using these four drums. However, Leonard Bernstein requires the timpanist to execute both a top-line bass clef A flat and the B flat above it on the same drum in the Overture to Candide. Adding a 51 cm (20 in) 'piccolo timpano' to the standard set of four extends the range upwards by a few semitones. This is the instrument which Stravinsky specifies for the production of the B below middle C in The Rite of Spring -- and from which Ravel even expects a high D in L'Enfant et les Sortil\u00e8ges. Walter Piston points out that \"these small drums, even if available, certainly lack the characteristic resonance and sonority of timpani\".\n\nBeyond this extended set of five, any added drums are nonstandard. Many professional orchestras and timpanists own multiple sets of timpani consisting of both pedal and chain drums allowing them to execute music that cannot be performed correctly using a standard set of four or five drums.\n\nMany schools and ensembles that cannot afford to purchase equipment regularly only have a set of three timpani. This was the standard set until the second half of the 20th century. It consists of 75 cm (29 in), 66 cm (26 in), and 61 cm (23 in) drums. Its range extends down only to the F below bass clef.\n\nThe drums are set up in an arc or horseshoe around the performer. Traditionally, North American timpanists set their drums up with the lowest drum on the left and the highest on the right, and German and Austrian players set them up the opposite way. Over time, that distinction has blurred: German and European players have adopted the North American layout and vice versa.\n\nedit] Timpanists\n\nThroughout their education, timpanists are trained as percussionists, and they learn to play all instruments of the percussion family along with timpani. However, when a timpanist is appointed to a position in a professional orchestra or concert band, he is not required to play any other percussion instruments. In his book Anatomy of the Orchestra, Norman Del Mar writes that the timpanist is \"king of his own province\", and that \"a good timpanist really does set the standard of the whole orchestra.\"\n\nMost pieces of music call for one timpanist playing one set of timpani. However, occasionally composers seeking a thicker texture or a greater palette of pitches ask for multiple players to perform on one or many sets of timpani. Gustav Mahler writes for two timpanists in six of his symphonies. Gustav Holst uses two timpanists to achieve the range of notes needed to echo the main theme in \"Jupiter\" from The Planets suite. Using two timpanists is relatively common in late Romantic and 20th century works for large orchestras, although the early Romantic composer Hector Berlioz took multiple timpanists to the extreme in his 1837 Requiem, which calls for eight pairs of timpani played by ten timpanists.\n\nedit] Timpani concertos\n\nAlthough such compositions are not common, a few concertos have been written for timpani. The 18th century composer Johann Fischer wrote a symphony for eight timpani and orchestra, which requires the solo timpanist to play eight drums simultaneously. In 1983, William Kraft, a well regarded American percussionist and composer, composed his Concerto for Timpani and Orchestra, which won second prize in the Kennedy Center Friedheim Awards. In the year 2000, American composer Philip Glass wrote his Concerto Fantasy for two timpanists and orchestra, which has its two soloists each playing seven timpani.\n\nedit] Performance techniques\n\nedit] Striking the drum\n\nFor general playing, a timpanist will beat the head approximately 4 inches in from the edge. Beating at this spot produces the round, resonant sound commonly associated with timpani.\n\nA timpani roll is executed simply by rapidly striking the drum, alternating between left and right sticks. In general, timpanists do not use multiple stroke rolls like those played on the snare drum.\n\nThe tone quality of the drum can be altered without switching sticks or adjusting the tuning of the drum. For example, by playing closer to the edge of the head, the sound becomes thinner. A more staccato sound can be produced by beating the drum with the heads of the sticks as close together as possible. When playing rolls, the sticks may be placed farther apart to cause as much of the head as possible to vibrate. There are many more variations in technique a timpanist uses during the course of playing to produce subtle timbral differences.\n\nOccasionally, composers will ask the timpanist to strike the drum at specific spots. B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k writes a passage \"to be played at the edge of the head\" in his Violin Concerto.\n\nedit] Tuning\n\nPrior to playing the instruments, the timpanist must clear the heads by equalizing the tension at each tuning screw. This is done so every spot on the head is tuned to exactly the same pitch. When the head is clear, the timpano will produce a beautiful, in-tune sound. If the head is not clear, the pitch of the drum will rise or fall after the initial impact, and the drum will produce different pitches at different dynamic levels.\n\n\n\nIn performance, tuning is typically accomplished with a method called interval tuning. Timpanists who are not blessed with absolute pitch obtain a reference pitch from a tuning fork, pitch pipe, or even a note played by another instrument in the course of the performance, then use musical intervals to arrive at the desired note. For example, to tune the timpani to G and C, a timpanist may sound an A with a tuning fork, then sing (or think) a minor third above that A to tune the C, and then sing a perfect fourth below the C to tune the G. Timpanists are required to have a very well developed sense of relative pitch.\n\nSome timpani are equipped with tuning gauges, which provide a visual indication of the drum's pitch. They are physically connected either to the counterhoop, in which case the gauge indicates how far the counterhoop is pushed down, or the pedal, in which case the gauge indicates the position of the pedal. These gauges can be useful. However, every time the drum is moved, the overall pitch of the head changes, thus the pitches must be re-marked on the gauges before every performance. Gauges are especially useful when performing music that involves fast tuning changes that do not allow the player to listen to the new pitch before playing it. Many good timpanists prefer to tune by ear and will rely on gauges only if absolutely necessary.\n\nTimpanists are commonly required to tune in the middle of a piece of music; thus, all timpanists must develop techniques to tune undetectably and accurately in the midst of other music.\n\nOccasionally, players use the pedals to retune a drum while playing it. Portamento effects can be achieved by changing the pitch of the drum while it can still be heard. This is commonly called a glissando, though this use of the term is not strictly correct. The most effective glissandos are those from low notes to high notes and those performed during rolls. One of the first composers to call for a timpani glissando was Carl Nielsen, who used two sets of timpani, both playing glissandi at the same time, in his Symphony No. 4 (\"The Inextinguishable\").\n\n\n\nPedaling refers to changing the pitch of the drum with the pedal; it is an alternate term for tuning. In general, timpanists reserve this term for passages where the performer must change the pitch of a drum in the midst of playing \u2013 for example, playing two consecutive notes of different pitches on the same drum. In Samuel Barber's Medea's Meditation and Dance of Vengeance, the timpanist must play A\u266f\u2013B\u2013C\u266f\u2013D in consecutive sixteenth notes. There is no way to place this passage across a common set of four drums, thus the timpanist must use the pedal to change the notes while playing. Nocturne, by Benjamin Britten, contains a longer chromatic passage using the same technique.\n\nedit] Muffling\n\nMuffling or damping is an implicit part of playing timpani. Often, timpanists will muffle notes so they only sound for the length indicated by the composer. However, early drums did not resonate nearly as long as modern timpani, so composers often just wrote a note when the timpanist was to hit the drum without worrying about the sustain. Today, timpanists must use their ear and the score of the piece to determine the actual length the note should sound.\n\nThe typical method of muffling is to place the pads of the fingers against the head while holding onto the timpani stick with the thumb and index finger. Timpanists are required to develop techniques to stop all vibration of the drumhead without making any sound from the contact of their fingers.\n\nMuffling is often referred to as muting, which can also refer to playing the drums with mutes on them (see below).\n\nedit] Extended techniques\n\nedit] History\n\nedit] Pre-orchestral history\n\nArabic nakers, the direct ancestors of timpani, were brought to 13th century Europe by Crusaders and Saracens. These drums, which were small (with a diameter of about 20\u201322 cm or 8\u20138\u00bd in) and mounted to the player's belt, were used primarily for military ceremonies. This form of timpani remained in use until the 16th century.\n\nIn 1457, a Hungarian legation sent by King Ladislaus V carried larger timpani mounted on horseback to the court of King Charles VII in France. This variety of timpani had been used in the Middle East since the 12th century. These drums evolved together with trumpets to be the primary instruments of the cavalry. This practice continues to this day in sections of the British Army, and timpani continued to be paired with trumpets when they entered the classical orchestra.\n\nOver the next two centuries, a number of technical improvements were made to timpani. Originally, the head was nailed directly to the shell of the drum. In the 15th century, heads began to be attached and tensioned by a counterhoop that was tied directly to the shell. In the early 16th century, the bindings were replaced by screws. This allowed timpani to become tunable instruments of definite pitch.\n\nedit] Timpani in the orchestra\n\nJean-Baptiste Lully is the first known composer to score for timpani, which he included in the orchestra for his 1675 opera Th\u00e9s\u00e9e. Other 17th century composers soon followed suit. In music of this time, timpani are almost always tuned with the tonic note of the piece on the high drum and the dominant on the low drum \u2013 a perfect fourth apart. Interestingly, timpani are often treated as transposing instruments in the music of this period: the notes were written as C and G with the actual pitches indicated at the top of the score (for example, Timpani in A\u2013D).\n\nLater in the Baroque era, Johann Sebastian Bach wrote a secular cantata titled \"T\u00f6net, ihr Pauken! Erschallet, Trompeten!\", which translates roughly to \"Sound off, ye timpani! Sound, trumpets!\" Naturally, the timpani are placed at the forefront: the piece starts with a timpani solo and the chorus and timpani trade the melody back and forth. Bach used this material later in Christmas Oratorio (Jauchzet, frohlocket!).\n\n\n\nLudwig van Beethoven revolutionized timpani music in the early 19th century. He not only wrote for drums tuned to intervals other than a fourth or fifth, but he gave a prominence to the instrument as an independent voice beyond programmatic use as in \"T\u00f6net, ihr Pauken!\". For example, his Violin Concerto (1806) opens with five timpani strokes, and the scherzo of his Ninth Symphony (1824) pitches the timpani against the orchestra in a sort of call and response.\n\nThe next major innovator was Hector Berlioz. He was the first composer to indicate the exact sticks that should be used \u2013 felt-covered, wooden, etc. In several of his works, including Symphonie fantastique (1830), he demanded the use of several timpanists at once.\n\nUntil the late 19th century, timpani were hand-tuned; that is, there was a sequence of screws with T-shaped handles, called taps, which altered the tension in the head when turned by players. Thus, tuning was a relatively slow operation, and composers had to allow a reasonable amount of time for players to change notes if they wanted to be sure of a true note. The first pedal timpani originated in Dresden in the 1870s and are called Dresden timpani for this reason. However, since vellum was used for the heads of the drums, automated solutions were difficult to implement since the tension would vary unpredictably across the drum. This could be compensated for by hand-tuning, but not easily by a pedal drum. Mechanisms continued to improve in the early 20th century.\n\nDespite these problems, composers eagerly exploited the opportunities the new mechanism had to offer. By 1915, Carl Nielsen was demanding glissandos on timpani in his Fourth Symphony \u2013 impossible on the old hand-tuned drums. However, it took B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k to more fully realize the flexibility the new mechanism had to offer. Many of his timpani parts require such a range of notes that it would be unthinkable to attempt them without pedal drums.\n\nedit] Timpani outside the orchestra\n\nLater, timpani were adopted into other classical music ensembles such as concert bands. In the 1970s, marching bands and drum and bugle corps, which evolved both from traditional marching bands and concert bands, began to include marching timpani. Each player carried a single drum, which was tuned by a hand crank. Marching timpani were heavy and awkward to play, as the drumhead was almost at the player's chest. Often, during intricate passages, the timpani players would put their drums on the ground by means of extendable legs, and they would be played more like conventional timpani, but with a single player per drum. In the early 1980s, Drum Corps International (DCI), a drum corps governing body, allowed timpani and other percussion instruments to be permanently grounded. This was the beginning of the end for marching timpani: Eventually, standard concert timpani found their way onto the football field as part of the front ensemble, and marching timpani fell out of common usage.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs rock and roll bands started seeking to diversify their sound, timpani found their way into the studio. Starting in the 1960s, drummers for high profile rock acts like The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Beach Boys, and Queen incorporated timpani into their music. Butch Trucks of The Allman Brothers Band usually uses a timpani set during live concerts; the timpani are especially featured in the opening of the song \"Mountain Jam.\"\n\nJazz musicians also experimented with timpani. Sun Ra used it occasionally in his Arkestra (played, for example, by percussionist Jim Herndon on the songs \"Reflection in Blue\" and \"El Viktor,\" both recorded in 1957). In 1964, Elvin Jones incorporated timpani into his drum kit on John Coltrane's four-part composition A Love Supreme.\n\nJonathan Haas is one of the few timpanists who markets himself as a soloist. Haas, who began his career as a solo timpanist in 1980, is notable for performing music from many genres including jazz, rock, and classical. In fact, he released an album with a rather unconventional jazz band called Johnny H. and the Prisoners of Swing.\n\nIn RIO/Avant-prog music, Moe! Staiano plays timpani for the band Sleepytime Gorilla Museum. The timpani sounds support very well the eerie and loud atmosphere of their avant-gardist music.\n\nedit] References\n\nedit] External links"}, {"url": "https://hub.yamaha.com/drums/percussion/anatomy-of-timpani/", "page_content": "Timpani (sometimes known as \u201ckettle drums\u201d) are used in many types of ensembles, including concert bands, marching bands, orchestras and even by some rock bands. They consist of a membrane (a head) stretched over a large bowl traditionally made of copper, and they\u2019re played by striking the head with a specialized drum stick called a mallet. Modern timpani can be tuned quickly and accurately to specific pitches by skilled players using a movable foot pedal.\n\nHere\u2019s an annotated illustration of a typical timpano (\u201ctimpani\u201d is plural for a collection of timpano), followed by a description of each part, in alphabetical order:\n\nAuxiliary Brake.

The name has been applied to large kettledrums since at least the 17th century. The permanent orchestral use of timpani dates from the mid-17th century, early examples being in Matthew Locke\u2019s Psyche (1673) and Jean-Baptiste Lully\u2019s opera Th\u00e9s\u00e9e (1675). At first they were mainly confined to expressions of rejoicing or to supporting the brass in loud passages. Two instruments, one tuned to the tonic and the other to the dominant (first and fifth notes of the scale), were normal in 17th- and 18th-century scores. Later, more instruments were used with a variety of tunings. In the 19th century the timpani were used in more varied and expressive ways, a development stimulated in large part by the innovations of Ludwig van Beethoven. The French composer Hector Berlioz, who required 16 kettledrums in his Grand Messe des morts (1837; Requiem), even urged composers to specify which type of hard or soft sticks they wished used.\n\nIn modern timpani the bowl-shaped shell is usually of copper or brass. The membrane, of calfskin or synthetic material, is secured by a metal hoop. Its tension is varied by hand screws fixed to the shell and acting on the hoop, or, more often, by one of several 19th- and 20th-century devices: pedal or hand mechanisms that control the tension by rods connected to the hoop. A hole is pierced at the bottom of the shell to avoid air concussion splitting the head in loud passages. The tone varies according to the texture of the head of the stick and the area of the membrane struck. Occasionally, composers specify using the fingers to set the membrane in vibration.\n\nBritannica Quiz Musical Instruments\n\nThe orchestral kettledrum has a practical compass of five full tones. The compass of a pair of timpani is normally an octave from F below middle C downward; for an orchestral set of three, the tuning ranges are generally c\u2013g, G\u2013d, and E\u266d\u2013B\u266d (g = the G below middle C; E\u266d = the second E\u266d below). Such composers as Igor Stravinsky and Gustav Mahler have extended this range. The expressive resources of the timpani include reiteration of persistent rhythms, dramatic crescendos, sudden stresses, and atmospheric rolls. Special effects include damped or muffled notes, striking a note with two sticks, pedal glissando (sliding pitch) on a roll, and muting by placing a cloth on the drumhead."}, {"url": "https://hellomusictheory.com/learn/facts-about-the-timpani/", "page_content": "By Robert Jackson\n\nTimpani are those large semi-spherical drums that look like big shiny bowls or upside-down tea-kettles\u2014which is why they\u2019re also called kettledrums.\n\nA classical percussion section would never be complete without timpani. They\u2019re important both in classical orchestras and musical ensembles, including concert, marching, and even rock and roll bands.\n\nThe sound of timpani can be energetic and thunderous, as well as smooth and velvety, which is why they\u2019re considered extremely versatile.\n\nTo help acquaint you with this fascinating percussive instrument, here are 20 interesting facts about the timpani.\n\n1. The Timpani is a Pitched Percussion Instrument\n\nModern pedal timpani can be instantly tuned through a movable foot pedal to adjust the tension of the head as well as the pitch.\n\nAlthough convenient, that could still pose a challenge during a concert, since it\u2019ll require the timpanist to have a perfect ear to keep the instrument in key with the rest of the ensemble.\n\nTuning a chain timpani, which is much less common nowadays, is even more difficult since they don\u2019t have pedals.\n\nInstead, they have a roller chain and a crank.\n\n2. The Timpani Were Initially Military Drums\n\nArabian Naqqara\n\nTimpani started as military drums.\n\nTheir use dates back to the 13th century when they were introduced to Europe by crusaders who brought similar but much smaller Arabian Naqqara.\n\nBefore timpani came to be a staple instrument in the classical orchestra by the last third of the 18th century, they were used in military ceremonies throughout Europe until the 16th century.\n\nThey were even used during the American Civil war where they were played by musicians on horseback.\n\nIn the late 19th century, modern machine timpani were developed for easier adjustment of drumhead tension.\n\n3. The Timpani Has a Wide Range of Sounds\n\nTimpani produce a wide dynamic range of sounds.\n\nTheir various sounds could best be described as dull, thunderous, rumbling, booming, deep, heavy, powerful, round, mellow, velvety, substantial, resonant, dry, or hollow.\n\nThe timbre of the timpani is affected by what the mallets are made of, where the head is struck, and how hard it\u2019s struck.\n\nThe purest tone is produced from the middle of a timpani drum.\n\n4. Timpani Belong to the Percussion Family\n\nThe percussion family is the largest in the orchestra, and timpani are a central part of it because they support rhythm, add melody and color, and enhance harmony.\n\nThe timpani, along with the xylophone and piano, are percussion instruments that are tuned and can sound different notes.\n\nThe bass drums, cymbals, and castanets are examples of untuned percussion instruments with no definite pitch.\n\n5. Timpani Have a Wide Pitch Range\n\nEach timpano (the singular or timpani) has a tonal range of about an interval of a sixth, with the pitch of the lower note dependant on its size.\n\nIn a four-timpani set, the range of pitch of the four drums can therefore span around 3 octaves!\n\n6. Timpani Are Traditionally Made of Copper\n\nTimpani sets today come in a host of materials, including fiber-reinforced plastic and aluminum.\n\nHowever, the traditional copper remains the best material for the bowl since it keeps the timpani in tune more effectively, and resists temperature changes.\n\nCopper also has properties that allow it to easily stretch and shape, and allows sound to resonate deeply.\n\n7. Animal Skins are Preferred for Timpani Heads\n\nTypically, timpani heads used to cover the bowl are made of calfskin or goatskin.\n\nAlthough costly, professional timpanists prefer these skins for the warmer quality of sound they produce.\n\nHeads are also often made of plastic, which is more durable, more affordable, and less affected by temperature and humidity than animal skin.\n\n8. There Are Two Styles of Timpani Placement\n\nIn German-speaking countries, including Germany and Austria, large timpani are usually placed at the right side of the timpanist with smaller timpani to the left, increasing the pitch from right to left.\n\nInternationally, especially in Japan, the direction of the timpani is reversed so that the pitch increases from left to right, similar to a piano keyboard.\n\n9. Timpanists Are Very Well Paid\n\nTimpanists are some of the highest-earning musicians in the music industry.\n\nTheir role is central in an orchestra, and there are few of them due to the difficulty of the instrument.\n\nOf course, the more skilled and experienced a timpanist is, the higher their earning potential, especially in performing arts companies or professional symphonies.\n\nIn the US, it\u2019s reported that the median salary for a timpanist is just under $50,000 a year with some paid well over $100k a year too!\n\n10. Timpani are Very Expensive Instruments\n\nBuying a quality set of timpani could cost you. Prices vary depending on factors like brand, size, and material.\n\nA timpani set can take up to two years to build and could cost an average of $12,000-$17,000.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to be careful while moving them around to avoid costly damages.\n\n11. Timpani Are Heavy\n\nTimpani are among the largest and heaviest musical instruments.\n\nA single timpani drum can weigh up to 140 lbs\u2026\n\nMultiply that by 4 or 5 for a whole set, and you\u2019ve got a challenge on your hands.\n\nTransporting these drums can be difficult and it\u2019ll give you a good workout.\n\n12. There Are Many Different Styles of Timpani\n\nTimpani come in various shapes and sizes.\n\nThere\u2019s a cambered type with a flat bottom like a pot, and a parabolic type that\u2019s nearly hemispherical.\n\nGenerally, the smaller the drums, the higher the pitches.\n\nThe timbre is also decided by where the drum head is stricken.\n\n13. Different Timpani Mallets Give Different Sounds\n\nThere are different categories of mallets used for striking the timpani, including hard, medium-hard, soft, flannel, and wood.\n\nEach kind is used according to the sheet music to express different sounds.\n\nThey come in various sizes, weights, coverings, and lengths of handles.\n\nThe mallet tip is often made out of felt, flannel, or cork, with a bamboo or wood handle.\n\nFelt ball mallets result in a soft attack, while wood balls produce a sharp attack and greater volume.\n\nMany professional musicians prefer to make their own mallets to customize them according to their needs.\n\n14. There Are Different Grips For The Timpani Mallet\n\nTwo common grips for the timpani mallet are the German grip and the French grip.\n\nIn the German grip, the palm is almost parallel with the drum head with the thumb on the side of the mallet.\n\nIn the French grip, the palm is almost perpendicular with the drum head and the thumb is on top of the mallet.\n\nThe American grip is a combination of both.\n\n15. Timpani Go Into All Kinds of Contemporary Music\n\nMusic created by timpani has a lengthy repertoire; it has invaded many rock and roll bands, as well as pop music.\n\nFrom the Beach Boys, Queen, The Beatles, and Emerson, to Led Zeppelin, timpani have taken pride of place in the 60s-70s pop-rock music.\n\nThey\u2019re also featured in electronic music!\n\nSounds created by the timpani are versatile, and stand out in any music style or genre.\n\n16. Playing the Timpani Can Be Tricky But Fun\n\nPlaying the timpani might seem easy\u2014the rhythms are simple, and you often play only a couple of notes\u2014but in reality, there\u2019s so much technique involved.\n\nYou need a very strong musical ear to successfully tune and play your timpani.\n\nYou also need to know how to maintain your drums and mallets to ensure a longer lifespan for them.\n\nOnce you get the hang of it, playing the timpani is so much fun.\n\n17. Playing the Timpani Requires Sensitivity Over Strength\n\nIt\u2019s often thought that playing a large musical instrument like the timpani requires a lot of physical strength, but that\u2019s not true.\n\nIn fact, a large volume of sound can be given through the drum reverberations, using only a little amount of force.\n\nAll you need is to create vibration as naturally as you can.\n\nIt actually takes a lot of sensitivity to create soft sounds and maintain a steady tempo.\n\n18. The Largest Timpani in the World is in Bali\n\nThe largest timpani in the world is in Bali.\n\nAt 73 inches in tall and 63 inches in diameter, the Moon of Pejeng is an ancient kettledrum that is thought to date back to 300 BC.\n\nIt has a story attached to it too, with a Balinese legend claiming that this drum was one of the wheels of a chariot on which they pulled the moon through sky until it fell to earth.\n\nWrap-Up\n\nAs you can see, a timpanist\u2019s job isn\u2019t an easy one.\n\nWhile playing the timpani isn\u2019t easy at first, it sure is fun when you get the hang of it.\n\nWe hope the 20 facts we\u2019ve shared in this post have inspired you to delve deeper into the world of percussive instruments and enjoy some fascinating timpani solos and ensembles."}, {"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timpani", "page_content": "Timpani (sometimes called kettle drums) are drums that are made out of large bowls that are usually made of copper shaped by craftsmen, which after being tuned, have a skin-like material stretched over the top. This material used to be a type of vellum or treated skin, but modern drums use a synthetic material. This top section is known as the \"drumhead\". Timpani is an Italian word. It is also a plural of the word timpano. However timpano is rarely used in informal English. More often, a timpano is referred to as a drum, a timpani, or simply a timp. Someone who plays a timpani is called a \"timpanist\".\n\nDifference from other drums [ change | change source ]\n\nTimpani are different from other drums because they are tuned to certain musical notes. A timpanist will often describe the drum as being \"in voice\" (or out of voice, as the case may be) when it is correctly tuned. To play it, it is hit with a special drumstick or \"timpani mallet\". Other drums that are used in orchestras and bands make a sound rather than a note, and are not tuned. A player normally sits with a group of two, three or four timpani around him, which is why the name timpani is in the plural.\n\nBrief history [ change | change source ]\n\nTimpani were originally used in official bands. They can still be seen in the bands of the modern official as in the Household Cavalry of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, in which the \"kettle drums\" (as they are called) are carried by large drumhorses. (See picture below) In the 1700s timpani became popular in orchestral music, and can be heard in the music of Handel, Beethoven and other 19th century composers wrote music that needed the timpani. Nowadays all large orchestras have timpani, and some bands that play popular music use them as well.\n\nDifferent ways timpani can be made [ change | change source ]\n\nA basic timpano timpani.\n\nThe drumhead [ change | change source ]\n\nA timpani drumhead, also called a timpani head, can be made out of two different things. Some are made out of animal skin, like calfskin or goatskin. Other ones can be made out of thick plastic. Because plastic heads are hard to break and do not cost as much as animal skin heads, they are used more often than animal skin heads. However, a lot of professional players prefer skin heads because they think that skin heads make a better sound when they are hit. The drumhead is stretched over the bowl of the timpani and held on by screws for tuning the timpani.\n\nA chain timpani.\n\nTuning the timpani [ change | change source ]\n\nThe screws that hold and tune the drumhead are called \"tension rods\". To tune the timpani, the \"tension rods\" can all be tightened or loosened. The timpani makes a higher sound if the tension rods are made tighter, and a lower sound if they are loosened. There are usually around seven tension rods on the timpani.[1]\n\nMachine timpani [ change | change source ]\n\nTuning a timpani by turning every tension rod by itself can be very hard, so some timpani makers invented different ways to change the drum's pitch more quickly.[2]\n\nChain timpani [ change | change source ]\n\nIn a chain timpani, the tension rods are all attached to a chain. This chain is hooked up to a lever, and when a player moves the lever back and forth, it tightens and loosens all the screws at the same time to change the pitch of the drum.[1]\n\nratchet clutch system. A pedal on a pedal timpani with asystem.\n\nPedal timpani [ change | change source ]\n\nA pedal timpani is a timpani that uses a pedal to change its pitch. It is the kind of timpani that is used the most today. A player can push on the pedal to make the timpani play higher notes, or let the pedal come back up to play lower notes.[1] There are three different kinds of pedal timpani:\n\nIn a ratchet clutch system a player must pull back a lever called a clutch to release the pedal. Once the pedal is in the spot where the player wants it, they must push the clutch forward with their foot again to lock it in place.\n\nsystem a player must pull back a lever called a to release the pedal. Once the pedal is in the spot where the player wants it, they must push the clutch forward with their foot again to lock it in place. A balanced action system uses a spring that is attached to the pedal, which keeps the pedal in one spot until it is moved by a player. Since the pedal is not held in one spot by a clutch in a balanced action system, some people call it a floating pedal because it looks like the pedal is not held on by anything and is floating.\n\nuses a spring that is attached to the pedal, which keeps the pedal in one spot until it is moved by a player. Since the pedal is not held in one spot by a clutch in a balanced action system, some people call it a because it looks like the pedal is not held on by anything and is floating. In a friction clutch system, the pedal is held in one spot by a clutch, and the clutch is attached to a pole. When a player releases the clutch, the pole moves up and down as the pedal is pushed up and down.\n\nTimpani mallets [ change | change source ]\n\nA set of timpani mallets.\n\nTimpani are played with a special kind of drumstick called timpani mallets. A player uses two mallets at a time when they play the drum. The two parts of the mallet are called the shaft and the head. The head is the part of the mallet that is shaped like a circle, and is the part that hits the timpani, and the shaft is the wooden part of the mallet that is held by a timpanist. A timpani mallet's head can be made out of many things, but is usually made out of a wood sphere that is covered with felt or a thin cloth. The shaft of the mallet is usually made out of wood, like hickory, cherry, or bamboo, but can also be made out of metal, like aluminum. Some timpani mallets do not have a felt head, and just have a wooden one. These mallets are sometimes used in classical and baroque music.[3][4]\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, some mallets had shafts made out of whale bones and heads made out of sponges.[5]\n\nWith a pedal timpani, a player can produce different sound effects using the pedals. Performing glissando on timpani demands switching the pedals. Glissando is generated by pressing the pedal during the vertebra. Furthermore it is possible to play glissando at any volume level up or down. For example, Alexander Rahbari, an outstanding Iranian-Austrian composer used glissando effect produced by switching timpani pedals in the opening of his piece, Persian Mysticism Around G, where the player moves from Bb up to C and then rolling down to G(see the timpani part on right below).[6]\n\nRelated pages [ change | change source ]\n\nOther websites [ change | change source ]"}, {"url": "https://www.yamaha.com/en/musical_instrument_guide/timpani/trivia/trivia005.html", "page_content": "You may not have this impression of Bach, but there are a few of his compositions in which timpani plays an important role.

A drum kit or trap kit.\n\nThis idea came about initially at the end of the US civil war. Until then, marching bands had always been on the move - one drum per drummer was the standard setup.\n\nDrummers in orchestras would also be booked one man per drum, but in smaller theatres with lower budgets, people were trying to come up with methods to reduce the costs.\n\nThe first of these was a snare & bass drum, with an overhanging pedal arrangement so one man could play both. Because techniques were still based on marching - we got the bass drum on the 1 & 3.. blend that with early jazz & vaudeville had begun.\n\nDrummers would supplement this basic setup with maybe a cymbal, as Chinese immigrants brought that idea with them & a whole set of things to rattle, blow & bang - tambourines, swanee whistles, wood blocks & cow bells - which they would keep on a tray above the bass drum. This was their 'contraption tray', abbreviated to trap\u2026 from where we get the modern definition of a trap kit.\n\nAdd to that a couple of Chinese tom drums, then the last part to really complete what we think of as a modern kit came in 1926 with the invention of the hi-hat stand.\n\nSo, TL:DR pre-20th century orchestras didn't use drum kits because they didn't yet exist.\n\nAlso see Zildjian/Vic Firth's A Century of Drum Set Evolution with Daniel Glass. Well worth a watch."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/art/jazz", "page_content": "Nonetheless, one important aspect of jazz clearly does distinguish it from other traditional musical areas, especially from classical music: the jazz performer is primarily or wholly a creative, improvising composer\u2014his own composer, as it were\u2014whereas in classical music the performer typically expresses and interprets someone else\u2019s composition .\n\nMost early classical composers (such as Aaron Copland , John Alden Carpenter \u2014and even Igor Stravinsky , who became smitten with jazz) were drawn to its instrumental sounds and timbres, the unusual effects and inflections of jazz playing (brass mutes, glissandos, scoops, bends, and stringless ensembles), and its syncopations, completely ignoring, or at least underappreciating, the extemporized aspects of jazz. Indeed, the sounds that jazz musicians make on their instruments\u2014the way they attack, inflect, release, embellish, and colour notes\u2014characterize jazz playing to such an extent that if a classical piece were played by jazz musicians in their idiomatic phrasings, it would in all likelihood be called jazz.\n\nJazz, in fact, is not\u2014and never has been\u2014an entirely composed, predetermined music, nor is it an entirely extemporized one. For almost all of its history it has employed both creative approaches in varying degrees and endless permutations. And yet, despite these diverse terminological confusions, jazz seems to be instantly recognized and distinguished as something separate from all other forms of musical expression . To repeat Armstrong\u2019s famous reply when asked what swing meant: \u201cIf you have to ask, you\u2019ll never know.\u201d To add to the confusion, there often have been seemingly unbridgeable perceptual differences between the producers of jazz (performers, composers, and arrangers) and its audiences. For example, with the arrival of free jazz and other latter-day avant-garde manifestations , many senior musicians maintained that music that didn\u2019t swing was not jazz.\n\nAny attempt to arrive at a precise, all-encompassing definition of jazz is probably futile . Jazz has been, from its very beginnings at the turn of the 20th century, a constantly evolving, expanding, changing music, passing through several distinctive phases of development; a definition that might apply to one phase\u2014for instance, to New Orleans style or swing \u2014becomes inappropriate when applied to another segment of its history, say, to free jazz . Early attempts to define jazz as a music whose chief characteristic was improvisation , for example, turned out to be too restrictive and largely untrue, since composition , arrangement , and ensemble have also been essential components of jazz for most of its history. Similarly, syncopation and swing, often considered essential and unique to jazz, are in fact lacking in much authentic jazz, whether of the 1920s or of later decades. Again, the long-held notion that swing could not occur without syncopation was roundly disproved when trumpeters Louis Armstrong and Bunny Berigan (among others) frequently generated enormous swing while playing repeated, unsyncopated quarter notes.\n\njazz , musical form , often improvisational, developed by African Americans and influenced by both European harmonic structure and African rhythms. It was developed partially from ragtime and blues and is often characterized by syncopated rhythms, polyphonic ensemble playing, varying degrees of improvisation, often deliberate deviations of pitch, and the use of original timbres.\n\nWest Africa in the American South: gathering the musical elements of jazz\n\nThe elements that make jazz distinctive derive primarily from West African musical sources as taken to the North American continent by slaves, who partially preserved them against all odds in the plantation culture of the American South. These elements are not precisely identifiable because they were not documented\u2014at least not until the mid- to late 19th century, and then only sparsely. Furthermore, Black slaves came from diverse West African tribal cultures with distinct musical traditions. Thus, a great variety of Black musical sensibilities were assembled on American soil. These in turn rather quickly encountered European musical elements\u2014for example, simple dance and entertainment musics and shape-note hymn tunes, such as were prevalent in early 19th-century North America.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

It is only a slight oversimplification to assert that the rhythmic and structural elements of jazz, as well as some aspects of its customary instrumentation (e.g., banjo or guitar and percussion), derive primarily from West African traditions, whereas the European influences can be heard not only in the harmonic language of jazz but in its use of such conventional instruments as trumpet, trombone, saxophone, string bass, and piano.\n\nThe syncopations of jazz were not entirely new\u2014they had been the central attraction of one of its forerunners, ragtime, and could be heard even earlier in minstrel music and in the work of Creole composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk (Bamboula, subtitled Danse des N\u00e8gres, 1844\u201345, and Ojos Criollos, 1859, among others). Nevertheless, jazz syncopation struck nonblack listeners as fascinating and novel, because that particular type of syncopation was not present in European classical music. The syncopations in ragtime and jazz were, in fact, the result of reducing and simplifying (over a period of at least a century) the complex, multilayered, polyrhythmic, and polymetric designs indigenous to all kinds of West African ritual dance and ensemble music. In other words, the former accentuations of multiple vertically competing metres were drastically simplified to syncopated accents.\n\nThe provenance of melody (tune, theme, motive, riff) in jazz is more obscure. In all likelihood, jazz melody evolved out of a simplified residue and mixture of African and European vocal materials intuitively developed by slaves in the United States in the 1700s and 1800s\u2014for example, unaccompanied field hollers and work songs associated with the changed social conditions of Blacks. The widely prevalent emphasis on pentatonic formations came primarily from West Africa, whereas the diatonic (and later more chromatic) melodic lines of jazz grew from late 19th- and early 20th-century European antecedents.\n\nHarmony was probably the last aspect of European music to be absorbed by Blacks. But once acquired, harmony was applied as an additional musical resource to religious texts; one result was the gradual development of spirituals, borrowing from the white religious revival meetings that African Americans in many parts of the South were urged to attend. One crucial outcome of these musical acculturations was the development by Blacks of the so-called blues scale, with its \u201cblue notes\u201d\u2014the flatted third and seventh degrees. This scale is neither particularly African nor particularly European but acquired its peculiar modality from pitch inflections common to any number of West African languages and musical forms. In effect these highly expressive\u2014and in African terms very meaningful\u2014pitch deviations were superimposed on the diatonic scale common to almost all European classical and vernacular music.\n\nThat jazz developed uniquely in the United States, not in the Caribbean or in South America (or any other realm to which thousands of African Blacks were also transported) is historically fascinating. Many Blacks in those other regions were very often emancipated by the early 1800s and thus were free individuals who actively participated in the cultural development of their own countries. In the case of Brazil, Blacks were so geographically and socially isolated from the white establishment that they simply were able to retain their own African musical traditions in a virtually pure form. It is thus ironic that jazz would probably never have evolved had it not been for the slave trade as it was practiced specifically in the United States.\n\nJazz grew from the African American slaves who were prevented from maintaining their native musical traditions and felt the need to substitute some homegrown form of musical expression. Such composers as the Brazilian mulatto Jos\u00e9 Maur\u00edcio Nunes Garcia were fully in touch with the musical advances of their time that were developing in Europe and wrote music in those styles and traditions. American slaves, by contrast, were restricted not only in their work conditions and religious observances but in leisure activities, including music making. Although slaves who played such instruments as the violin, horn, and oboe were exploited for their musical talents in such cities as Charleston, South Carolina, these were exceptional situations. By and large the slaves were relegated to picking up whatever little scraps of music were allowed them."}, {"url": "https://www.allaboutjazz.com/a-tale-of-two-genres-the-surprising-similarities-in-the-development-of-jazz-and-classical-music", "page_content": "What is Jazz?\n\nTextures moving from polyphony to homophony from the Baroque to Classical and from Dixieland to Swing.\n\nEnsembles standardized in the Classical Era (symphony orchestras and string quartets) and in the Swing Era (big band).\n\nFigured Bass: A Short-form Notation System for the Improvising Baroque Keyboardist\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach, Cantata \"Komm, s\u00fc\u00dfer Tod\" (\"Come Sweet Death\") BWV 478\n\nRameau's Chord Revolution\n\nJazz Leadsheets (Figured Soprano?): A Short-form Notation System for All Improvising Jazz Musicians\n\nLeadsheet for \"Blue In Green\" by Miles Davis and Bill Evans\n\nIn Closing\n\nJazz and classical music are two of the most monumental achievements in human history. Together, they encompass a range of expressive capability that is simply astounding, giving voice to the human experience from centuries past to the present and in doing so, enriching our lives immeasurably. This is more remarkable when one considers that they have nothing to do with our survival as a species, but rather serve to nurture our emotional and intellectual needs, occupying a place in our psyches near our spiritual and religious beliefs.If we consider their stylistic development from a broad, conceptual perspective, striking similarities are found. Patterns of innovation emerge in both genres that speak to some deep rooted characteristics of human creativity. Separated by time and place in such dramatic fashion, these creative minds nonetheless moved forward from era to era in spectacularly similar ways, for example:Of course, not all developments occurred in the same order. The most notable, (as highlighted in the graphic), is the development of a short-form notation system that was practiced in the Baroque Era, but did not emerge in jazz until the Be-Bop Era. The Baroque and Be-Bop Eras have some shared attributes that make both very demanding for both composer and performer\u0097most importantly, both feature a similar approach to the resolution of dissonance, but the notation systems, separated by 250 years, are also very interesting to consider.Figured bass is the short-form notation system that features numbers written above bass notes. These tell the keyboardist what the notes are that should be played above the notated bass line. For example, if the bass note was a 'C' with a 3 and a 5 above it, then the keyboardist knows that the 3rd and the 5th note above 'C' are the correct notes for the intended harmony. This system does not tell the performer how or where these notes should be played\u0097that is entirely up to the keyboardist who is therefore improvising the solution to these numerical symbols. Of course, the keyboardist was working in a stylistic framework that connected chords together using quite stringent \"rules\" that arose from practice. Thus, the keyboardist was improvising, but was doing so within a well-defined set of stylistic guidelines.Jean-Philippe Rameau (1683-1784) was a composer and theorist who first came up with the idea of \"chords\" with roots. Prior to this development in the first quarter of the 18C, composers did not think of a \"C chord\" or a \"G minor chord\"\u0097they thought in terms of the intervals above a bass note. A 'C' in the bass with an 'E' and a 'G' above was not thought of as a C chord\u0097 it was simply a 'C' in the bass with a 3rd and a 5th above it. Rameau also claimed that when another pitch from the chord was found in the bass\u0097i.e. the C chord with an E in the bass\u0097then it was a C chord that had been \"inverted\" with its 3rd in the bass and its root (C) above it. Since Rameau's conceptual breakthrough, his chord theory and its concomitant ideas on chord inversion revolutionized classical music theory, but is also the preferred method of short form notation for popular music of all kinds.If this had followed suit with other developments, we would have expected to find it being adopted in the Swing Era. It was likely being utilized in that era to some degree, but the chord notation system used in jazz really came to the fore in the 1940s.It is very much akin with the figured bass practices in the Baroque, except that the single note melody provided in the manuscript is not the bass (although the bass notes are identified in the chord symbol)\u0097it is the melody, or the \"soprano.\" In this chord notation, the chords are written above the melody, sometimes with quite explicit information about what notes are in the chord as in the example below), sometimes without.The pianist or guitarist in a jazz setting reads these symbols and, as in the Baroque era, improvises a chordal accompaniment. This accompaniment, while improvised, must, however, still adhere to stylistic proclivities\u0097a set of \"rules\" that, as with the figured bass realization in the Baroque, arose from practice.Unlike figured bass, these symbols are also read by the all of the instrumentalists. The bassist improvises a bass line using these symbols, the horns base their improvisations on them, and the drummer, along with the entire ensemble, use them to identify the form of the piece. (With this in mind, it reminds us anew how astonishing this perfectly poised and crafted piece of music is, created from such an impossibly minimalistic sketch that was rendered, on a first take no less, into a masterwork byand his all-star ensemble on Kind of Blue (Columbia, 1959).)These are two of the most celebrated genres of \"art music,\" for lack of a better term, but their origins could not be more disparate. The creative geniuses in each genre are separated by hundreds of years. They come from different continents, different cultures, different races, different political systems, and different folk music roots. As such, the two genres are, on the surface, very different from one another, and yet, the humanity and creativity that shines through across time and space speak to something else at play here\u0097an unfathomably deep connection that defies the temporal, geographical, racial, cultural and the myriad other differences, revealing instead the shared human spirit that is manifested in these powerful artistic expressions."}, {"url": "https://www.cmuse.org/classical-vs-jazz-music/", "page_content": "This article is an opportunity for two established pillars of the musical community to square up to one another and to discover how they compare. Are there areas where the two genres of music connect, or are they radically different? Is the popularity of Jazz greater than that of classical music today? Or, could it be that actually, Jazz and classical music are really rooted in the same creative soil, almost impossible to separate?\n\nClassical vs Jazz Music\n\nClassical music can be considered to cover a time span that covers over a millennium. During this long span of time classical music underwent a number of significant transitions through different periods of music. This broadly speaking began in the Medieval period and continues now in the classical music of the 21st century.\n\nIn between, there were the Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, Impressionist, Nationalist periods of music, each offering huge developments in music. This gives classical music an impressively rich cultural heritage and diversity that has facilitated the emergence of other notable genres of music including Jazz and Popular Music.\n\nBy comparison, Jazz really began in the mid-nineteenth century with the music of the black slaves. This music came to be known more commonly as The Blues. It can be argued that the whole world of Jazz music stemmed from these repressed beginnings, developing as it did into one of the most popular genres of music ever.\n\nFrom the Blues came Ragtime music, primarily through the work of one composer, Scott Joplin who sort to combine the rhythms of both cultures into one style that became known as Ragtime. The effect of Ragtime music was widely felt and allowed the music of black musicians to become more accepted amongst the white communities.\n\nAs time moved on both white and black musicians united through the emerging jazz music to create \u2018Swing\u2019, Boogie-Woogie, Big Band, Be-Bop, Cool Jazz and even Free-Form Jazz. Spin-offs of these types of jazz including Funk, Post-Bop have ensured the continuing development of the genre.\n\nBoth genres of music have a wealth of diversity and cultural heritage to give them lasting credibility and popularity. Are there perhaps differences that a closer examination might reveal? A popular form in jazz is the 32 bar standard. This is essentially an AABA structure that means the first idea is repeated and returns after the contrasting tune in the second section.\n\nThe same form exists in classical music as exemplified for instance, by the Minuet and Trio. Where the two genres differ in their treatment of the musical material. In the classical form, the music is stated but rarely developed any further. A Mozart Minuet and Trio could be wondrously inventive, and beautifully crafted but the development of material is not the central focus of this form. In jazz, by contrast, once the musical material has been played, what happens next is the chance to improvise on it.\n\nIn many ways, it is this element of musical content and direction that differs significantly from classical to jazz music. Whilst the musical material in both genres stems from equally diverse sources and can be inventive, creative and fresh, jazz has a fundamentally different focus. Improvisation is such a key aspect of jazz music that it clearly distinguishes itself from the world of classical music where, for the most part, what is notated is what is played.\n\nA thirty-two bar jazz standard, even though the actual composition may only last two minutes, can lead to a performance of considerably longer and with an almost limitless musical outcome. A Beethoven Symphony, although subject to different interpretations and editions, is performed from beginning to end without change. This, in turn, has given rise to developments in jazz, free-form for example, where improvisation is the creation of the piece, scrubbing out the need for a prescribed structure at all.\n\nSo does improvisation play no part in classical music at all? Is jazz unique in this way? Actually, the answer is no. Improvisation is a part of classical music too but not in the same way as jazz. Consider a \u2018cadenza\u2019 in a concerto. This section in the concerto where the soloist is able to improvise on the ideas presented by the composer. Some cadenzas are notated by composers, others by notable performers of the time, but an improvisation it is none the less.\n\nIn Baroque music, there are a bewildering number of conventions that govern the decoration of a melodic line according to French, Italian, German or English tastes. Keyboard players who formed part of the \u2018continuo\u2019 in Baroque pieces were expected to improvise their parts from a notated bass line and what was known as a \u2018figured bass\u2019. Here the composer added numbers underneath the bass line that indicated the desired harmony to be played; but the performer had control of the \u2018how\u2019 it would be played.\n\nRhythmic feel plays a vital part in both classical and jazz music. Where jazz plots a distinctive course is with the idea of \u2018swing\u2019. Classical music does have compound time signatures like 6, 9, and 12/8, but the feel of these is not an exact representation of what happens with swing in jazz. The Swing Era was ushered in in the late 1930s as the world plunged towards the Second World War. Big Bands that consisted of saxes, trumpets, trombones, drums, guitar, piano and bass gave the Swing Era its sound.\n\nThe \u2018swing\u2019 came from the subtle division of beat into a quaver ratio of something close to 2/3rd to 1/3rd as opposed to an equal quaver pairing. Swing is a feature that runs through the majority of jazz music and with it brings a completely unique trait that is not common in classical music.\n\nCurious as it may sound the two worlds of jazz and classical do collaborate and collide. In the last century, both genres have made a significant impact on each other. Composers like Stravinsky in his \u201cRagtime for 11 Instruments\u201d, through to Copland\u2019s Clarinet Concerto for the King of Swing, Benny Goodman. The music of Leonard Bernstein owes much to the world of jazz too.\n\nMany exponents in the jazz world have been influenced by their classical contemporaries including Duke Ellington whose compositions like \u201cThe Black and Tan Fantasy\u201d, absorbed the concept of more complex classical structures. One final addition is the French jazz-pianist Jacques Loussier, who has taken Bach and Vivaldi to a whole other level."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/teach/bring-the-noise/the-woodwind-family/z7hphbk", "page_content": "Historically woodwind instruments got their name from being made out of hollowed out wood and passing a stream of wind through them to generate a sound. Nothing has changed other than the material they are made from.\n\nWhat to consider when choosing a brass instrument\n\nGenres: These instruments are very popular because they are commonly used instruments across the different genres including traditional folk, classical and contemporary to name but a few.\n\nSize and weight: As a beginner, you'll most likely start either with a flute, clarinet or alto saxophone because of their size and weight but this does not mean you shouldn't research an oboe or lower-pitched instruments. Braces can be attached to heavier instruments so that the weight can be distributed across the shoulders.\n\nMouth muscles: A strong embouchure is needed to produce a sound from a reed and non-reed instrument, so practising scales and playing in general will help build endurance. The mouth muscles are used differently than with a brass instrument - the lower lip is tucked under the mouthpiece with a woodwind instrument - so swapping over may take more time than you first think.\n\nClefs and key signatures: Clefs are symbols written at the start of a piece of music to indicate the pitch range. Next to the clef symbol is a further set of symbols - the key signature - that inform the performer of the upcoming notes that are to be assumed sharp or flat. Learning the different clefs and key signatures is also another skill to develop because woodwind instruments are transposing instruments - the note sounds different to the one written - but is an incredibly important skill for arranging.\n\nWhat are woodwind instruments made from\n\nTraditionally from wood and clay but most woodwind instruments are now made from plastic, metal or a combination of both.\n\nHow to play woodwind instruments\n\nPut simply, the performer has to blow down one end of a tube whilst closing and opening holes along the pipe which will produce a sound from out of the other end.\n\nMost woodwind instruments need a mouthpiece with a reed - a thin piece of wood - to vibrate that will be amplified by the instrument. However, an instrument like the flute does not need a reed mouthpiece and must be blown as if you were blowing across the top of a bottle.\n\nThe sound they make\n\nWoodwind instruments like the saxophone and clarinet need a single reed to rest against the mouthpiece but sound quite different.\n\nClarinets sound mellow because of their long-pure shape and smooth plastic lining whereas saxophones are made of brass so they sound brighter.\n\nSome instruments like the oboe and bassoon feature a double reed mouthpiece which makes the sound much less smooth and has a raspy quality to it. In Sergei Prokofiev\u2019s orchestral piece, Peter and the Wolf, the oboe plays the part of the duck because of the likeness in sound.\n\nFlutes and piccolos have mouthpieces that need the performer to blow across, as if when blowing into a bottle, which generates a clear and light sound."}, {"url": "https://en.audiolexic.org/wiki/Timpani", "page_content": "From AudioLexic\n\nTimpani are musical instruments in the percussion family. A type of drum, they consist of a skin called a head stretched over a large bowl commonly made of copper. They are played by striking the head with a specialized drum stick called a timpani stick or timpani mallet. Unlike most drums, they produce a definite pitch when struck. Timpani evolved from military drums to become a staple of the classical orchestra in the 17th century. Today, they are used in many types of musical ensembles including concert, marching, and even rock bands.\n\nTimpani is an Italian plural, the singular of which is timpano. However, this is rarely used in informal English speech as a timpano is typically referred to as a drum, a timpani, or simply a timp. Alternative spellings with y in place of either or both is \u2013 tympani, tympany, or timpany \u2013 are occasionally encountered in older English texts. This substitution is taken from the Latin word tympanum, from which the Italian word descends. A musician who plays the timpani is known as a timpanist. While the word timpani has been widely adopted in the English language, some English speakers choose to use the native word kettledrums. The German word for timpani is Pauken, and the French is timbales.\n\nedit] The instrument\n\nedit] The basic timpano\n\nThe basic timpano consists of a drumhead stretched across the opening of a bowl typically made of copper or, in less expensive models, fiberglass and sometimes aluminum. (By one system of classification, it is thus considered a membranophone.) The drumhead is affixed to a hoop (also called a fleshhoop), which in turn is held onto the bowl by a counterhoop, which is then held by means of a number of tuning screws called tension rods placed regularly around the circumference. The head's tension can be adjusted by loosening or tightening the rods. Most timpani have six to eight tension rods.\n\nThe shape of the bowl contributes to the tone quality of the drum. For example, hemispheric bowls produce brighter tones while parabolic bowls produce darker tones. Another factor that affects the timbre of the drum is the quality of the bowl's surface. Copper bowls may have a smooth, machined surface or a rough surface with many small dents hammered into it.\n\nTimpani come in a variety of sizes from about 84 centimeters (33 inches) in diameter down to piccolo timpani of 30 centimeters (12 inches) or less. A 33-inch drum can produce the C below the bass clef, and speciality piccolo timpani can play up into the treble clef. In Darius Milhaud's 1923 ballet score La cr\u00e9ation du monde, the timpanist must play the F sharp at the bottom of the treble clef.\n\nEach individual drum typically has a range of a perfect fifth to an octave.\n\nedit] Machine timpani\n\nChanging the pitch of a timpano by turning each tension rod individually is a laborious process. In the late 19th century, mechanical systems to change the tension of the entire head at once were developed. Any timpani equipped with such a system may be called machine timpani, although this term commonly refers to drums that use a single handle connected to a spider-type tuning mechanism.\n\n\n\n\n\nedit] Pedal timpani\n\nBy far the most common type of timpani used today are pedal timpani, which allow the tension of the head to be adjusted using a pedal mechanism. Typically, the pedal is connected to the tension screws via a spider-like system of metal rods.\n\nThere are three types of pedal mechanisms in common use today:\n\nThe ratchet-clutch system uses a ratchet and pawl to hold the pedal in place. The timpanist must first disengage the clutch before using the pedal to tune the drum. When the desired pitch is achieved, the timpanist must then reengage the clutch.\n\nsystem uses a ratchet and pawl to hold the pedal in place. The timpanist must first disengage the clutch before using the pedal to tune the drum. When the desired pitch is achieved, the timpanist must then reengage the clutch. In the balanced action system, a spring or hydraulic cylinder is used to balance the tension on the timpani head so that the pedal will stay in position and the head will stay at pitch. The pedal on a balanced action drum is sometimes called a floating pedal since there is no clutch holding it in place.\n\nsystem, a spring or hydraulic cylinder is used to balance the tension on the timpani head so that the pedal will stay in position and the head will stay at pitch. The pedal on a balanced action drum is sometimes called a since there is no clutch holding it in place. The friction clutch or post and clutch system uses a clutch that moves along a post. Disengaging the clutch frees it from the post, allowing the pedal to move without restraint.\n\nAny pedal drums that are tuned using the spider system can be called Dresden timpani, though the term is most often used for drums whose design is similar to the original pedal timpani built in Dresden (see below). Strictly speaking, a Dresden drum has a pedal that is attached at the player's side. The timpanist can move this pedal with ankle motion. A Berlin-style pedal is attached by means of a long arm to the opposite side of the drum, and the timpanist must use his entire leg to adjust the pitch.\n\nThe drums most professional timpanists use are Dresden timpani, commonly with a ratchet-clutch or friction clutch pedal. Most school bands and orchestras below the university level use cheaper, more durable timpani. The mechanical parts of these timpani are almost completely contained within the frame and bowl of the drum. They may use any of the pedal mechanisms, though the balanced action system is by far the most common, followed by the friction clutch system. Many professionals also use these drums for gigs and outdoor performances because of their durability.\n\nedit] Chain timpani\n\nOn chain timpani, the tension rods are connected by a roller chain much like the one found on a bicycle, though some manufacturers have used other materials, including steel cable. In these systems, all the tension screws can then be tightened or loosened by one handle. Though far less common than pedal timpani, chain and cable drums still have practical uses. Occasionally, a player is forced to place a drum behind other items so that he cannot reach it with his foot. Professional players may also use exceptionally large or small chain and cable drums for special low or high notes.\n\nedit] Other tuning mechanisms\n\nA rare tuning mechanism allows the pitch of the head to be changed by rotating the drum itself. A similar system is used on rototoms. Jenco, a company better known for mallet percussion, made timpani tuned in this fashion.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Hans Schnellar, then timpanist of the Vienna Philhamonic, developed a tuning mechanism in which the bowl is moved via a handle that connects to the base, and the head remains stationary. These drums are referred to as Viennese timpani (Wiener Pauken) or Schnellar timpani. Adams Musical Instruments developed a pedal-operated version of this tuning mechanism in the early 21st century.\n\nedit] Timpani heads\n\nLike most drumheads, timpani heads can be found made from two materials: animal skin (typically calfskin or goatskin) and plastic (typically PET film). Plastic heads are durable, weather resistant, and relatively inexpensive. Thus, they are more commonly used than natural skin heads. However, many professional players prefer skin heads because they feel the heads produce a warmer, better quality timbre.\n\nedit] Timpani sticks\n\nTimpani are typically struck with a special type of drumstick fittingly called a timpani stick or timpani mallet. Timpani sticks are used in pairs. They have two components: a shaft and a head. The shaft is typically made from wood \u2013 usually hickory, cherry, birch, persimmon, or maple \u2013 or bamboo, but may also be made from aluminum or graphite. The head of the stick can be constructed from a number of different materials, though felt wrapped around a wood core is the most common. Other core materials include felt and cork, and other wrap materials include leather. Sticks can also have exposed wood heads. These are used as a special effect and in authentic performances of Baroque music.\n\nAlthough it is not commonly written in the music, timpanists will change sticks \u2013 often many times within the same piece \u2013 to suit the nature of the music. However, choice of stick during performance is entirely subjective and depends on the timpanist's own preference, and occasionally, the wishes of the conductor. Thus, most timpanists own a great number of timpani sticks. The weight of the stick, the size of the head, the materials used for the shaft, core, and wrap, and the method used to wrap the head all contribute to the timbre the stick produces.\n\nIn the early 20th century and before, sticks were often made with whalebone shafts, wood cores, and sponge wraps. Composers of that era often specified sponge-headed sticks. Modern timpanists execute such passages with standard felt mallets.\n\nedit] Timpani in the modern ensemble\n\nedit] A set of timpani\n\nA standard set of timpani consists of four drums: roughly 80 cm (32 in), 75 cm (29 in), 66 cm (26 in), and 61 cm (23 in) in diameter. The range of this set is roughly the D below the bass clef to the top-line bass clef A. A great majority of the orchestral repertoire can be played using these four drums. However, Leonard Bernstein requires the timpanist to execute both a top-line bass clef A flat and the B flat above it on the same drum in the Overture to Candide. Adding a 51 cm (20 in) 'piccolo timpano' to the standard set of four extends the range upwards by a few semitones. This is the instrument which Stravinsky specifies for the production of the B below middle C in The Rite of Spring -- and from which Ravel even expects a high D in L'Enfant et les Sortil\u00e8ges. Walter Piston points out that \"these small drums, even if available, certainly lack the characteristic resonance and sonority of timpani\".\n\nBeyond this extended set of five, any added drums are nonstandard. Many professional orchestras and timpanists own multiple sets of timpani consisting of both pedal and chain drums allowing them to execute music that cannot be performed correctly using a standard set of four or five drums.\n\nMany schools and ensembles that cannot afford to purchase equipment regularly only have a set of three timpani. This was the standard set until the second half of the 20th century. It consists of 75 cm (29 in), 66 cm (26 in), and 61 cm (23 in) drums. Its range extends down only to the F below bass clef.\n\nThe drums are set up in an arc or horseshoe around the performer. Traditionally, North American timpanists set their drums up with the lowest drum on the left and the highest on the right, and German and Austrian players set them up the opposite way. Over time, that distinction has blurred: German and European players have adopted the North American layout and vice versa.\n\nedit] Timpanists\n\nThroughout their education, timpanists are trained as percussionists, and they learn to play all instruments of the percussion family along with timpani. However, when a timpanist is appointed to a position in a professional orchestra or concert band, he is not required to play any other percussion instruments. In his book Anatomy of the Orchestra, Norman Del Mar writes that the timpanist is \"king of his own province\", and that \"a good timpanist really does set the standard of the whole orchestra.\"\n\nMost pieces of music call for one timpanist playing one set of timpani. However, occasionally composers seeking a thicker texture or a greater palette of pitches ask for multiple players to perform on one or many sets of timpani. Gustav Mahler writes for two timpanists in six of his symphonies. Gustav Holst uses two timpanists to achieve the range of notes needed to echo the main theme in \"Jupiter\" from The Planets suite. Using two timpanists is relatively common in late Romantic and 20th century works for large orchestras, although the early Romantic composer Hector Berlioz took multiple timpanists to the extreme in his 1837 Requiem, which calls for eight pairs of timpani played by ten timpanists.\n\nedit] Timpani concertos\n\nAlthough such compositions are not common, a few concertos have been written for timpani. The 18th century composer Johann Fischer wrote a symphony for eight timpani and orchestra, which requires the solo timpanist to play eight drums simultaneously. In 1983, William Kraft, a well regarded American percussionist and composer, composed his Concerto for Timpani and Orchestra, which won second prize in the Kennedy Center Friedheim Awards. In the year 2000, American composer Philip Glass wrote his Concerto Fantasy for two timpanists and orchestra, which has its two soloists each playing seven timpani.\n\nedit] Performance techniques\n\nedit] Striking the drum\n\nFor general playing, a timpanist will beat the head approximately 4 inches in from the edge. Beating at this spot produces the round, resonant sound commonly associated with timpani.\n\nA timpani roll is executed simply by rapidly striking the drum, alternating between left and right sticks. In general, timpanists do not use multiple stroke rolls like those played on the snare drum.\n\nThe tone quality of the drum can be altered without switching sticks or adjusting the tuning of the drum. For example, by playing closer to the edge of the head, the sound becomes thinner. A more staccato sound can be produced by beating the drum with the heads of the sticks as close together as possible. When playing rolls, the sticks may be placed farther apart to cause as much of the head as possible to vibrate. There are many more variations in technique a timpanist uses during the course of playing to produce subtle timbral differences.\n\nOccasionally, composers will ask the timpanist to strike the drum at specific spots. B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k writes a passage \"to be played at the edge of the head\" in his Violin Concerto.\n\nedit] Tuning\n\nPrior to playing the instruments, the timpanist must clear the heads by equalizing the tension at each tuning screw. This is done so every spot on the head is tuned to exactly the same pitch. When the head is clear, the timpano will produce a beautiful, in-tune sound. If the head is not clear, the pitch of the drum will rise or fall after the initial impact, and the drum will produce different pitches at different dynamic levels.\n\n\n\nIn performance, tuning is typically accomplished with a method called interval tuning. Timpanists who are not blessed with absolute pitch obtain a reference pitch from a tuning fork, pitch pipe, or even a note played by another instrument in the course of the performance, then use musical intervals to arrive at the desired note. For example, to tune the timpani to G and C, a timpanist may sound an A with a tuning fork, then sing (or think) a minor third above that A to tune the C, and then sing a perfect fourth below the C to tune the G. Timpanists are required to have a very well developed sense of relative pitch.\n\nSome timpani are equipped with tuning gauges, which provide a visual indication of the drum's pitch. They are physically connected either to the counterhoop, in which case the gauge indicates how far the counterhoop is pushed down, or the pedal, in which case the gauge indicates the position of the pedal. These gauges can be useful. However, every time the drum is moved, the overall pitch of the head changes, thus the pitches must be re-marked on the gauges before every performance. Gauges are especially useful when performing music that involves fast tuning changes that do not allow the player to listen to the new pitch before playing it. Many good timpanists prefer to tune by ear and will rely on gauges only if absolutely necessary.\n\nTimpanists are commonly required to tune in the middle of a piece of music; thus, all timpanists must develop techniques to tune undetectably and accurately in the midst of other music.\n\nOccasionally, players use the pedals to retune a drum while playing it. Portamento effects can be achieved by changing the pitch of the drum while it can still be heard. This is commonly called a glissando, though this use of the term is not strictly correct. The most effective glissandos are those from low notes to high notes and those performed during rolls. One of the first composers to call for a timpani glissando was Carl Nielsen, who used two sets of timpani, both playing glissandi at the same time, in his Symphony No. 4 (\"The Inextinguishable\").\n\n\n\nPedaling refers to changing the pitch of the drum with the pedal; it is an alternate term for tuning. In general, timpanists reserve this term for passages where the performer must change the pitch of a drum in the midst of playing \u2013 for example, playing two consecutive notes of different pitches on the same drum. In Samuel Barber's Medea's Meditation and Dance of Vengeance, the timpanist must play A\u266f\u2013B\u2013C\u266f\u2013D in consecutive sixteenth notes. There is no way to place this passage across a common set of four drums, thus the timpanist must use the pedal to change the notes while playing. Nocturne, by Benjamin Britten, contains a longer chromatic passage using the same technique.\n\nedit] Muffling\n\nMuffling or damping is an implicit part of playing timpani. Often, timpanists will muffle notes so they only sound for the length indicated by the composer. However, early drums did not resonate nearly as long as modern timpani, so composers often just wrote a note when the timpanist was to hit the drum without worrying about the sustain. Today, timpanists must use their ear and the score of the piece to determine the actual length the note should sound.\n\nThe typical method of muffling is to place the pads of the fingers against the head while holding onto the timpani stick with the thumb and index finger. Timpanists are required to develop techniques to stop all vibration of the drumhead without making any sound from the contact of their fingers.\n\nMuffling is often referred to as muting, which can also refer to playing the drums with mutes on them (see below).\n\nedit] Extended techniques\n\nedit] History\n\nedit] Pre-orchestral history\n\nArabic nakers, the direct ancestors of timpani, were brought to 13th century Europe by Crusaders and Saracens. These drums, which were small (with a diameter of about 20\u201322 cm or 8\u20138\u00bd in) and mounted to the player's belt, were used primarily for military ceremonies. This form of timpani remained in use until the 16th century.\n\nIn 1457, a Hungarian legation sent by King Ladislaus V carried larger timpani mounted on horseback to the court of King Charles VII in France. This variety of timpani had been used in the Middle East since the 12th century. These drums evolved together with trumpets to be the primary instruments of the cavalry. This practice continues to this day in sections of the British Army, and timpani continued to be paired with trumpets when they entered the classical orchestra.\n\nOver the next two centuries, a number of technical improvements were made to timpani. Originally, the head was nailed directly to the shell of the drum. In the 15th century, heads began to be attached and tensioned by a counterhoop that was tied directly to the shell. In the early 16th century, the bindings were replaced by screws. This allowed timpani to become tunable instruments of definite pitch.\n\nedit] Timpani in the orchestra\n\nJean-Baptiste Lully is the first known composer to score for timpani, which he included in the orchestra for his 1675 opera Th\u00e9s\u00e9e. Other 17th century composers soon followed suit. In music of this time, timpani are almost always tuned with the tonic note of the piece on the high drum and the dominant on the low drum \u2013 a perfect fourth apart. Interestingly, timpani are often treated as transposing instruments in the music of this period: the notes were written as C and G with the actual pitches indicated at the top of the score (for example, Timpani in A\u2013D).\n\nLater in the Baroque era, Johann Sebastian Bach wrote a secular cantata titled \"T\u00f6net, ihr Pauken! Erschallet, Trompeten!\", which translates roughly to \"Sound off, ye timpani! Sound, trumpets!\" Naturally, the timpani are placed at the forefront: the piece starts with a timpani solo and the chorus and timpani trade the melody back and forth. Bach used this material later in Christmas Oratorio (Jauchzet, frohlocket!).\n\n\n\nLudwig van Beethoven revolutionized timpani music in the early 19th century. He not only wrote for drums tuned to intervals other than a fourth or fifth, but he gave a prominence to the instrument as an independent voice beyond programmatic use as in \"T\u00f6net, ihr Pauken!\". For example, his Violin Concerto (1806) opens with five timpani strokes, and the scherzo of his Ninth Symphony (1824) pitches the timpani against the orchestra in a sort of call and response.\n\nThe next major innovator was Hector Berlioz. He was the first composer to indicate the exact sticks that should be used \u2013 felt-covered, wooden, etc. In several of his works, including Symphonie fantastique (1830), he demanded the use of several timpanists at once.\n\nUntil the late 19th century, timpani were hand-tuned; that is, there was a sequence of screws with T-shaped handles, called taps, which altered the tension in the head when turned by players. Thus, tuning was a relatively slow operation, and composers had to allow a reasonable amount of time for players to change notes if they wanted to be sure of a true note. The first pedal timpani originated in Dresden in the 1870s and are called Dresden timpani for this reason. However, since vellum was used for the heads of the drums, automated solutions were difficult to implement since the tension would vary unpredictably across the drum. This could be compensated for by hand-tuning, but not easily by a pedal drum. Mechanisms continued to improve in the early 20th century.\n\nDespite these problems, composers eagerly exploited the opportunities the new mechanism had to offer. By 1915, Carl Nielsen was demanding glissandos on timpani in his Fourth Symphony \u2013 impossible on the old hand-tuned drums. However, it took B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k to more fully realize the flexibility the new mechanism had to offer. Many of his timpani parts require such a range of notes that it would be unthinkable to attempt them without pedal drums.\n\nedit] Timpani outside the orchestra\n\nLater, timpani were adopted into other classical music ensembles such as concert bands. In the 1970s, marching bands and drum and bugle corps, which evolved both from traditional marching bands and concert bands, began to include marching timpani. Each player carried a single drum, which was tuned by a hand crank. Marching timpani were heavy and awkward to play, as the drumhead was almost at the player's chest. Often, during intricate passages, the timpani players would put their drums on the ground by means of extendable legs, and they would be played more like conventional timpani, but with a single player per drum. In the early 1980s, Drum Corps International (DCI), a drum corps governing body, allowed timpani and other percussion instruments to be permanently grounded. This was the beginning of the end for marching timpani: Eventually, standard concert timpani found their way onto the football field as part of the front ensemble, and marching timpani fell out of common usage.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs rock and roll bands started seeking to diversify their sound, timpani found their way into the studio. Starting in the 1960s, drummers for high profile rock acts like The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Beach Boys, and Queen incorporated timpani into their music. Butch Trucks of The Allman Brothers Band usually uses a timpani set during live concerts; the timpani are especially featured in the opening of the song \"Mountain Jam.\"\n\nJazz musicians also experimented with timpani. Sun Ra used it occasionally in his Arkestra (played, for example, by percussionist Jim Herndon on the songs \"Reflection in Blue\" and \"El Viktor,\" both recorded in 1957). In 1964, Elvin Jones incorporated timpani into his drum kit on John Coltrane's four-part composition A Love Supreme.\n\nJonathan Haas is one of the few timpanists who markets himself as a soloist. Haas, who began his career as a solo timpanist in 1980, is notable for performing music from many genres including jazz, rock, and classical. In fact, he released an album with a rather unconventional jazz band called Johnny H. and the Prisoners of Swing.\n\nIn RIO/Avant-prog music, Moe! Staiano plays timpani for the band Sleepytime Gorilla Museum. The timpani sounds support very well the eerie and loud atmosphere of their avant-gardist music.\n\nedit] References\n\nedit] External links"}]}
