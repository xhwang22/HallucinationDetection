He worked at the University Settlement, teaching the poor of Edinburgh's slums. In 1891 Neilson immigrated with his family to Canada, where his brother had settled. After brief periods of teaching at Bryn Mawr College (1898 - 1900), Harvard (1900 - 1904), and Columbia (1904 - 1906), he was in 1906 appointed professor of English at Harvard, where he remained until 1917, when he accepted the presidency of Smith College. In 1904 he spent the summer in Offenburg in the family of Oskar Muser, a lawyer and member of the Landtag of the Duchy of Baden. Neilson became an American citizen in 1905. At Harvard, Neilson won distinction as both teacher and scholar. He taught Chaucer, Shakespeare and other Elizabethan dramatists, Milton, and various nineteenth-century authors. He joined President Charles W. Eliot as associate editor of the Harvard Classics (the 50-volume \"Five-Foot Bookshelf, \" 1909-1910), writing the notes and introductions. His edition of Shakespeare's Complete Dramatic and Poetic Works, revised with Prof. Charles J. Hill in 1942, is a standard and important one. During his career at Smith, he served as editor-in-chief of the second edition of Webster's New International Dictionary, which appeared in 1934. Neilson hesitated for some time before accepting the Smith presidency. His two predecessors, L. Clark Seelye and Marion Le Roy Burton, had both been clergymen. Neilson had no desire to increase the size of the student body of Smith, fixed at 2, 000. He was, however, determined to provide college residences for all students, many of whom were living in private dormitories, a practice felt to be undemocratic. In the course of adding ten new dormitories he greatly enlarged the physical college and built two brick quadrangles on a tract adjacent to the old campus, which preserved the college's tradition of small dormitory units. He beautified the campus by planting and landscaping. In spite of his insistence that fund raising was not his province, Neilson not only balanced the budget, even during the depression, but through his great personal popularity brought sizable gifts to the college that significantly increased the endowment. He maintained a balanced faculty of men and women. Himself a teacher during the early years of his presidency, he brought to Smith many distinguished scholars and teachers from abroad as well as from the United States, with the result that he left the college well on a par with leading universities. He won the respect and loyalty of the faculty for his fairmindedness and devotion to academic freedom. Always a fighter for liberal causes, Neilson was violently opposed by the local community and by some of the Smith faculty for his defense of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. His compassion for the victims of Nazism led him to become a director of the National Refugee Service and co-chairman of the Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born. As the national and international situation grew more tense through the 1930's, he devoted his Monday chapel talks to attempts to make students more aware of the issues in national and international affairs. After his retirement in 1939, Neilson settled in Falls Village, Connecticut, where he had bought a remodeled farmhouse. He continued to spend part of the winters in Northampton, working on a history of Smith College, and he died there in 1946 of a coronary thrombosis. His ashes were buried on the Smith campus, appropriately in the midst of a natural garden he had planned on a hillside."}, {"url": "https://snaccooperative.org/view/25680249", "page_content": "Educator, editor and author.

WorldCat record id: 51231676\n\nWilliam Allan Neilson was born March 28, 1869, in Doune, Pertshire Scotland. He attended Edinburgh University where he studied philosophy, graduating with honors in 1891. In order to join his brother who emigrated to Canada, Neilson crossed the Atlantic and began teaching in Upper Canada College in Toronto which was a boarding school for young boys.\n\nDeciding that he would prefer to be a scholar than a school master, Neilson went on to Harvard Graduate School in Cambridge, MA where he received his Ph.D. in English in 1898. Upon receiving his Ph.D., Neilson accepted a position as an Associate in English Literature at Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr, PA. Neilson taught at many other fine institutions before settling into the work of an administrator. Harvard, Radcliffe, the Sorbonne, Columbia, Barnard, and the University of California all made use of Neilson's talents at one time or another.\n\nIt was during his years as a professor that Neilson distinguished himself as the sort of scholar that an academic institution would wish to guide it. Before coming to Smith, Neilson made a name for himself both as a professor devoted to his students' learning (he was the only instructor of Helen Keller's who learned the manual sign language she used for communication) but also as a writer and an editor. Among his writings were Essentials of Poetry (1912)and The Facts about Shakespeare (1913). He also was the editor of Milton's Minor Poems (1899) and Shakespeare's Complete Works (1906).\n\nIn 1917, Neilson was offered the Presidency of Smith College. He accepted on the conditions that he would not be obligated to raise money, and that a president's house would be built, with which the trustees complied.\n\nPerhaps one of the best assets that Neilson brought to Smith was his quick wit that endeared him to student, staff, faculty, and alumnae alike. At Neilson's final commencement in 1939 Cynthia Walsh recalled one particular instance:\n\nThe seniors will especially recall that on May Day when they went to serenade him, his new collie puppy began to bark, not realizing what sweet voices were vying with the birds so early in the morning. When the president stepped out he said, \"My dog thinks you're sheep,\" and the volleys of laughter which greeted this remark quite drowned out the rest: \"-but I think you're lambs!\"\n\nNeilson's accomplishments at Smith were many. When Neilson noticed that a majority of Smith students lived off campus he set about the task of purchasing and building new residences so that all Smith students would live on campus. After building the Great Quadrangle, purchasing Chapin House, Talbot House, Sessions House, and many others his goal was completed. During Neilson's 22-year term as president, the campus also saw the additions of Sage Music Hall, Scott Gymnasium, Tryon Art Gallery, the Alumnae House, the Infirmary, and the President's house.\n\nNeilson also established the Junior Year in France, Junior Year in Italy, and the Junior Year in Spain Programs. Special Honors, the Smith College Day School, and the School for Social Work were additions that Neilson made to the college.\n\nNever one to rest on his laurels, Neilson continued writing and editing while looking after the well being of 2,000 students. In 1920 he wrote History of English Literature and in 1922 he edited Roads to Knowledge. He also was the editor-in-chief of Webster's New International Dictionary, 2nd edition, 1934.\n\nFrom the guide to the Office of President William Allan Neilson Files RG 32., 1917-1939, (Smith College Archives)\n\n: Born in Doune, Perthshire, Scotland, March 28\n\n: Attended Montrose Academy\n\n: Studied at the University of Edinburgh, received M.A.\n\n: Immigrated with family to Canada\n\n: Resident English Master, Upper Canada College, Toronto\n\n: Graduate work in English, Harvard University, M.A. (1897), Ph.D. (1898)\n\n: Associate Professor of English Literature, Bryn Mawr College\n\n: Instructor of English, Harvard University\n\n: Professor of English, Columbia University\n\n: Became American citizen\n\n: Professor of English, Harvard University\n\n: Married Elisabeth Muser in Offenburg, Germany, June 25\n\n: Exchange Professor, University of Paris\n\n: President of Smith College\n\n: Trustee, Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Education Served intermittently on the College Entrance Examination Board\n\n: Initiated Special Honors program at Smith College\n\n: President, Modern Language Association\n\n: Editorial Board of G.C.

While these papers contain material dating from Neilson's years at Smith College (1917-1939), his official correspondence as president of the college is stored separately in the College Archives' holdings of records of the Office of the President.\n\n\n\nThe papers document Neilson's personal life with extensive family material. His letters to his brother and sisters are particularly valuable. Among other things these letters present Neilson's view of life at Bryn Mawr College under M. Carey Thomas, his strong opinions on world politics, his experiences tutoring Helen Keller at Radcliffe College, and his first impressions of Smith College. This series of letters is especially strong for the years between Neilson's arrival at Harvard University for graduate study in 1895 and his marriage in 1905. In addition to the Neilson family correspondence there is extensive correspondence between the Neilson and Muser families plus diaries and writings of Elisabeth Muser Neilson, her parents, and her sister. Much of the Muser family material is in German.\n\n\n\nOther personal material such as photographs, correspondence, class notes, and student essays document Neilson's youth and education. His love of his native Scotland and his study of its language and literature are clearly in evidence in his University of Edinburgh essays.\n\n\n\nCorrespondence and miscellaneous papers, 1917-1946, document such day-to-day concerns as finances, family health, the running of the household, and travel arrangements.\n\n\n\nNeilson's career as professor and scholar of English and Scottish literature is represented by class notes and correspondence with students and colleagues which date primarily from his years at Harvard and Radcliffe. Smith College material includes a few notes for courses Neilson taught in the English department but consists primarily of documentation of the events and celebrations of his presidency such as his appointment, inauguration, tenth and twentieth anniversaries, and retirement. Other material documents Neilson's affiliation with scholarly organizations such as the Modern Language Association, the Scottish Text Society, and the Shakespeare Association of America. There are also texts and notes for speeches on Shakespeare and Burns. Neilson's scholarly publications are represented by a number of articles, an unfinished manuscript for a book on allegory, and proofs for a 1942 edition of Shakespeare's plays and poems. Correspondence and news clippings document other writing and editorial projects in different stages of the work. Two such projects of particular interest are the 'five foot shelf' series of Harvard Classics, which Neilson edited with Charles W. Eliot, and the second edition of Webster's New International Dictionary, for which Neilson was editor-in-chief.\n\n\n\nIn addition to his work as professor, administrator, and scholar, Neilson was much in demand for committee work. As a respected educator and administrator, his advice and support was continually sought by educational institutions and organizations. Correspondence documents Neilson's work as a member of various committees for Harvard University, his suggestions on the planning of the campus and curriculum of Bennington College, and his advice and endorsements for the New School for Social Research and a variety of organizations promoting adult education such as the Affiliated Schools for Workers, the Eliot Foundation for Adult Education, and the Committee on University Extension in the Connecticut Valley.\n\n\n\nNeilson was also well-known for his vigorous support of liberal causes of the day. His political activities are reflected in his involvement with a large number of organizations most of which worked for civil liberties, peace, aid to refugees, or improved foreign relations. This work is documented by correspondence with such organizations as the American Civil Liberties Union, the Foreign Policy Association, the American Society for Cultural Relations with Russia, the National Refugee Service, various League of Nations organizations, and the Commission to Study the Organization of Peace.\n\n\n\nAll of Neilson's interests and concerns are in evidence in his speeches and writings. Texts contained in the papers are a rich source for the study of life at Smith College, and trends in education and politics during Neilson's term as president of Smith (1917-1939). News clippings document the quite considerable attention paid to his views.\n\n\n\nNeilson was a renowned speaker who seldom prepared a text, preferring to talk from cursory notes made shortly before the speech was to be delivered. Because of this process the texts contained in the papers are almost exclusively transcriptions. Some of them were edited for publication, others remain more or less as they were delivered. The papers also contain some of Neilson's handwritten notes for speeches.\n\n\n\nCorrespondence, citations, and news clippings document Neilson's many awards and honors and a group of biographical articles gives an overview of Neilson's life and work. The papers also contain notes, typescripts, and correspondence for Margaret Farrand Thorp's 1956 biography Nelson of Smith."}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/1022290.William_Allan_Neilson", "page_content": "Showing 30 distinct works.\n\nsort by popularity original publication year title average rating number of pages\n\nThe Original Of The Complaynt Of Scotlande...\n\nIntellectual honesty, and other addresses, being mainly chapel talks at Smith college\n\nShakspere's Twelfth Night: Or What You Will\n\nThe Lake English Classics: Milton's Minor Poems.

The lecture series will address the theme \"Public Feelings: Love, Compassion, and Indifference in the U.S.\" Each talk will take place in the Leo Weinstein Auditorium in Wright Hall at 4:30 p.m. and will be followed by a reception in the Neilson Browsing Room. The events are free of charge and wheelchair accessible. On Thursday, Sept. 18, Berlant will present \"Remembering Love, Forgetting Everything Else: Now, Voyager,\" in which she will explore some of the compromises women and-less often-men make in order to secure or remain in love relationships. The lecture culls from the 1942 film \"Now, Voyager,\" which starred Bette Davis as a painfully introverted woman who undergoes a dramatic transformation and begins a relationship with a married man. Berlant's second lecture, \"Capitalism and Compassion,\" will take place on Monday, Oct. 20. Her final talk, \"Why Be Normal? Globalization, Psychoanalysis, and Intimacy,\" will be delivered on Monday, Nov. 17. Over the last decade, Berlant has established an international reputation for her in-depth cultural analyses of the social and historical construction of emotions and attachments, particularly for women. Her most recent books are \"The Queen of America Goes to Washington City: Essays on Sex and Citizenship\" (1997) and \"Our Monica, Our Selves: Clinton, Scandal, and Affairs of State\" (2001). Berlant is the recipient of numerous awards for her scholarly contributions to gender studies and the humanities. She received the 1999 Society of American Publishers award for Best Special Issue of a magazine or journal, which became her book \"Intimacy\"(2001). In 1993, she won the Norman Foerster Award for the year's best essay in American literature for \"The Queen of America Goes to Washington City (Harriet Jacobs, Frances Harper, Anita Hill),\" on which she later based the book of the same title. The Neilson Professorship, which commemorates President William Allan Neilson, was established in 1927. Berlant joins past Neilson professors such as Alfred Kazin (English, 1954-55), Eudora Welty (English, 1961-62), Charles Hamilton (government, 1988-89) and Romila Thapar (religion and biblical literature, 1998-99). -30- Office of College Relations\n\nSmith College\n\nGarrison Hall\n\nNorthampton, Massachusetts 01063 Marti Hobbes\n\nNews Assistant\n\nT (413) 585-2190\n\nF (413) 585-2174\n\nmhobbes@email.smith.edu"}, {"url": "https://www.smith.edu/news/maya-lin-new-neilson-news-release", "page_content": "Now, as the redesigned library opens to members of the on-campus community, the new Neilson offers, McCartney says, \u201ca reenvisioning of a building that has been at the heart not just of our campus but also of the educational experiences of generations of students, staff and faculty.\n\n\u201cThis state-of-the-art library houses the new and the old: our archives and special collections, digital design studios, the Jill Ker Conway Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, and so much more,\u201c McCartney said. \u201cIt is a place of learning, connection, discovery and beauty\u2014a place that invites us to explore the world in all its wonder.\u201d\n\nArchitectural designer Maya Lin\u2019s re-imagined Neilson Library is an innovative, contemporary structure that presents a compelling vision for the modern library while respecting the building\u2019s historic significance.\n\nWith an emphasis on natural light, sustainable environmental design principles, and flexible interior space that can be used for a variety of purposes, Lin\u2019s design re-imagines the library as a space for collaboration and reflection. It also reconnects the college\u2019s science quadrangle with the campus\u2019 historic center, restoring integrity to Frederick Law Olmsted\u2019s 1893 campus plan.\n\nMaya Lin Studio developed the design in partnership with colleague William Bialosky and the firm of Shepley Bulfinch. Landscape architecture is by Lin with landscape designer Edwina von Gal (in collaboration with Ryan Associates).\n\nBegun in 2018, the five-story, 153,865 gross-square-foot project is Lin\u2019s first college library and one of the most significant capital projects in Smith College\u2019s history.\n\nIn an artist\u2019s statement, Lin says she envisioned the new Neilson as \u201ca dialogue between old and new.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy preserving the original, historic Neilson foundations and exterior, the new library retains the memory of the original structure. But completely rethinking and reconstructing the interior speaks to the needs of students today\u2014with more room for collaborating and socializing. And of course the book is still central to the space,\u201d Lin says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in Neilson, you\u2019ll know that you are in a house of books.\u201d\n\nThe new Neilson retains the original 1909 structure, including the venerable Neilson Browsing Room, but replaces the 1962 and 1982 additions with \u201cjewel box\u201d wings\u2014constructed of masonry, wood and glass\u2014that offer open, inviting, light-filled spaces designed to support research, teaching and learning in a variety of styles. Featuring gracious entryways on each side of the building, the new library draws people in from every direction.\n\nInside, books are abundant and visible. Visitors will also notice that all five floors are connected by an eye-catching central \u201coculus,\u201d an open core designed to capture and disseminate ethereal light throughout the space.\n\nTwo curved, \u201cjewel box\u201d wings (recently named for Smith presidents emeritae Ruth Simmons and Mary Maples Dunn) create comfortable space for reading (in the South wing) and socializing (in the North Wing). These striking, curved additions to the building\u2019s original 1909 core replace outmoded wings that divided the heart of Smith\u2019s campus, uniting Smith\u2019s historic quadrangle with its science quadrangle. \u201cThe two curved, organically shaped jewel boxes are a contrast to the original, orthogonal design, and speak to my aesthetic, which introduces a more hand drawn and organic shape,\u201d says Lin.\n\nThe primary purpose of Smith\u2019s library redesign was not to expand space for existing collections, which are among the strongest of any liberal arts college, but to think creatively and intentionally about what a forward-looking library should be, how it should function, and what scholarly and social goals it might serve.\n\nIn particular, Smith sought to develop a library that reflects and conveys the nature of a Smith education, which is global in scope and based on learning across disciplines.\n\nThe project cost for the new Neilson Library was $120 million, of which $42.8 million has been funded through philanthropy.\n\nReflecting the purpose of a contemporary library\n\nThe new Neilson places a premium on flexible space that blends traditional collections with new technologies and an intentional focus on collaborative learning.\n\nA \u201clearning hub\u201d for the campus\u2014offering classrooms, quiet study and reading rooms, as well as expanded space for collaboration, socializing and high-tech work\u2014the new Neilson features a Digital Media Hub with multimedia equipment and studio space for recording digital content; GIS and gaming labs; and a large, multifunctional Learning Commons where students can work with research librarians, instructional technologists and writing and quantitative learning specialists.\n\nThe Jill Ker Conway Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center, named for Smith\u2019s first woman president, is housed in a prominent place within the central core of the library, just to the left of the entrance from Seelye Lawn. Across from the Conway Center, the Neilson Browsing Room\u2014a longstanding and beloved home for readings, lectures and other events\u2014has been restored and updated.\n\nOn the top floor, the Skyline Reading Room provides large, open space for meetings, classes, events or individual study. A rooftop patio offers expansive views of the Holyoke Range.\n\nProvost and dean of the faculty Michael Thurston says, \u201cWhat\u2019s especially exciting to me is the way the shape and flow of spaces emphasize collaborative inquiry. It really emblematizes and enacts the ancient and vital identity of a library as the place where a community of scholars engages both the preserved thought of the past and the ongoing conversation that looks to renew and enrich our understanding.\u201d\n\nLeading in sustainability\n\nThe new Neilson is intentionally designed as one of the greenest, most energy-efficient libraries in the U.S., using 50 percent less energy than a typical library and contributing significantly to the college\u2019s goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2030. Maximizing the use of natural light through the central, light-catching \u201coculus\u201d and expansive windows (laced with an ultraviolet webbing pattern that prevents bird collisions), Smith\u2019s new Neilson Library unites the indoors and outdoors with an exterior courtyard and an outdoor amphitheater that can be used for performances and classroom instruction. Throughout, the structure emphasizes the use of locally sourced materials, including limestone.\n\nLin said, \u201cMy approach was to create a new, state-of-the-art, sustainable building that creates a dialogue with the historic Neilson and opens up and restores the Olmsted master plan, expanding the possibilities of the library while reducing the overall footprint of the building and restoring the heart of the campus.\u201d\n\nHistory of the project\n\nSmith\u2019s library redesign began in 2010, when the college engaged Shepley Bulfinch to partner on a master plan for all of the college\u2019s libraries. Soon after, the college worked with Shepley Bulfinch on several studies to assess what could feasibly be accomplished with current library space. In 2014, the trustees approved the concept of a redesign of Neilson and the hiring of an architect.\n\nMaya Lin and Shepley Bulfinch were hired in April 2015. They approached the Smith library redesign as a creative exploration and an active partnership with members of the Smith community. During the process, nearly 1,900 students, faculty, staff, alums and members of the Northampton community participated in more than 30 \u201cengagement sessions\u201d designed to help re-imagine Neilson for the 21st century.\n\nThe library\u2019s interior design reflects priorities identified during those sessions, including:\n\na strong desire for natural light\n\nflexible space that can easily be rearranged to suit a variety of teaching, learning and research purposes\n\na cafe where students can be \u201calone together,\u201d studying in solitude while surrounded by their peers\n\nstudy spaces, where students and faculty can work in solitude\n\na variety of spaces that support quiet reflection as well as task-oriented scholarship\n\nintegrated space for Smith\u2019s outstanding special collections\u2014one of the world\u2019s largest and best collections of materials related to women\u2019s history.\n\nNamed for Smith\u2019s third president, William Allan Neilson, Neilson Library serves as the sciences, social sciences and humanities library and includes the library administration offices. Neilson also is home to Smith\u2019s extraordinary Special Collections\u2014including the Smith College Archives, the Mortimer Rare Book Room, and the Sophia Smith Collection\u2014one of the world\u2019s largest and most important archives of women\u2019s history.\n\nAbout the Location\n\nBuilt in 1909 and expanded in 1962 and in 1982, Neilson Library holds pride of place on the Smith College campus, sitting between the science quad and the arts and humanities quad.\n\nWorking within Frederick Law Olmsted\u2019s 1939 plan for the Smith campus, Lin\u2019s design for the new Neilson eliminates the architectural barrier created by the previous building, unifying the campus and opening the view\u2014and the paths for travel\u2014from the Smith College Museum of Art to the science quad, and from Green Street to Chapin Lawn.\n\nThe new Neilson highlights significant improvements to the surrounding landscape, recalling Olmsted\u2019s original campus plan, which Lin describes as \u201cnot formal, but very organic. Our goal,\u201d Lin says, \u201cwas to restore the heart of the Smith Campus\u2014creating a landscape that welcomes you to sit, read and gather outside as well as bringing back the flow around the building.\u201d\n\nThe revised landscaping effectively reveals and incorporates the 16-foot elevation change between Neilson\u2019s east and west sides, and will also preserve several heritage trees that surround the original 1909 structure.\n\nAbout Maya Lin\n\nKnown for her large-scale environmental installations, memorials and architectural works, Maya Lin is an American artist, architectural designer and environmentalist whose many mould-breaking projects defy explicit categories. Always trying to find a balance between opposing forces, she says, \u201cMy work originates from a simple desire to make people aware of their surroundings.\u201d\n\nNature and the environment have long been central concerns for Lin, who attended Yale University, where she earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1981 and a Master of Architecture degree in 1986. Lin was thrust into the spotlight when, as a senior at Yale, she submitted the winning design in a national competition for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to be built in Washington, D.C. She has gone on to a remarkable career in both art and architecture, while still being committed to memory works that focus on some of the critical historical issues of our time.\n\nLin\u2019s art explores how we experience and relate to landscape, setting up a systematic ordering of the land that is tied to history, memory, time and language. Her interest in landscape has led to works influenced by topographies and geographic phenomena.\n\nHer architectural projects are largely undertaken at the request of non-profit institutions and include the newly renovated Neilson Library (2021) at Smith College, the Museum for Chinese in America (2009) in New York City, the Riggio-Lynch Interfaith Chapel (2004), the Langston Hughes Library (1999) in Clinton, Tennessee, and the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research: Cambridge Campus (2015).\n\nHer designs create a close dialogue between the landscape and built environment, and she is committed to advocating sustainable design solutions in all her works.\n\nIn 2009, Maya Lin started work on her last memorial, \u201cWhat is Missing?\u201d, an ongoing, multi-sited multimedia installation that raises awareness about habitat loss and biodiversity and emphasizes how protecting and restoring habitats can help protect species and significantly reduce climate change emissions.\n\nLin, who operates Maya Lin Studio in New York, has received many honors, among them the National Medal of Arts (2009) and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2016), both conferred by President Barack Obama, and the Gish Prize (2014). The film \u201cMaya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision\u201d won the 1994 Oscar for Best Documentary.\n\nAbout Julia Chang Lin, Class of 1951\n\nThe new Neilson\u2019s sunken courtyard is named for Maya Lin\u2019s mother, Julia Chang Lin, who led an extraordinary life.\n\nBorn in Shanghai in 1928, she grew up in a small coastal town in South China, attended private schools, and in 1947 enrolled at St. John\u2019s University in Shanghai.\n\nIn May 1949, on the same day that the Communists marched into Shanghai, Lin received a telegram from Smith, notifying her that she\u2019d been accepted as a transfer student and awarding her a $1,000 scholarship. The family housekeeper, Liu Ma, sewed the telegram and two $10 bills into the collars of Lin\u2019s Chinese dress. As the Nationalist government bombed the coast, Lin was smuggled to the United States on a fishing boat with her best friend. Detained for weeks on an island held by the Nationalists, Lin arrived at Smith one month after the semester had started, in October 1949.\n\nAfter graduating from Smith and earning graduate degrees from the University of Washington, Julia Chang Lin taught for nearly 30 years in the English Department at Ohio University, where she also helped establish the university\u2019s Chinese language courses. The author of four books, she was influential in bringing generations of Chinese women poets to a western audience. In 1999, Lin was one of 29 \u201cremarkable women\u201d honored by Smith for \u201cachievements representing the accomplishments of generations of Smith alumnae.\u201d\n\nJulia Chang Lin died of cancer in New York in 2013, at age 85. At the time of her death, she was writing an autobiography. The sunken courtyard at the center of the new Neilson has been named for Julia Chang Lin.\n\nAbout Smith: Founded in 1871, Smith College opened in 1875 with 14 students. Today, it is one of the largest women\u2019s liberal arts colleges in the United States, educating women of promise for lives of distinction and purpose. Smith enrolls 2,600 students from nearly every state and more than 50 other countries to cultivate leaders able to address the complex, urgent problems of today. As a community of scholars, entrepreneurs, scientists, activists and humanitarians, Smith is changing the world.

He worked at the University Settlement, teaching the poor of Edinburgh's slums. In 1891 Neilson immigrated with his family to Canada, where his brother had settled. After brief periods of teaching at Bryn Mawr College (1898 - 1900), Harvard (1900 - 1904), and Columbia (1904 - 1906), he was in 1906 appointed professor of English at Harvard, where he remained until 1917, when he accepted the presidency of Smith College. In 1904 he spent the summer in Offenburg in the family of Oskar Muser, a lawyer and member of the Landtag of the Duchy of Baden. Neilson became an American citizen in 1905. At Harvard, Neilson won distinction as both teacher and scholar. He taught Chaucer, Shakespeare and other Elizabethan dramatists, Milton, and various nineteenth-century authors. He joined President Charles W. Eliot as associate editor of the Harvard Classics (the 50-volume \"Five-Foot Bookshelf, \" 1909-1910), writing the notes and introductions. His edition of Shakespeare's Complete Dramatic and Poetic Works, revised with Prof. Charles J. Hill in 1942, is a standard and important one. During his career at Smith, he served as editor-in-chief of the second edition of Webster's New International Dictionary, which appeared in 1934. Neilson hesitated for some time before accepting the Smith presidency. His two predecessors, L. Clark Seelye and Marion Le Roy Burton, had both been clergymen. Neilson had no desire to increase the size of the student body of Smith, fixed at 2, 000. He was, however, determined to provide college residences for all students, many of whom were living in private dormitories, a practice felt to be undemocratic. In the course of adding ten new dormitories he greatly enlarged the physical college and built two brick quadrangles on a tract adjacent to the old campus, which preserved the college's tradition of small dormitory units. He beautified the campus by planting and landscaping. In spite of his insistence that fund raising was not his province, Neilson not only balanced the budget, even during the depression, but through his great personal popularity brought sizable gifts to the college that significantly increased the endowment. He maintained a balanced faculty of men and women. Himself a teacher during the early years of his presidency, he brought to Smith many distinguished scholars and teachers from abroad as well as from the United States, with the result that he left the college well on a par with leading universities. He won the respect and loyalty of the faculty for his fairmindedness and devotion to academic freedom. Always a fighter for liberal causes, Neilson was violently opposed by the local community and by some of the Smith faculty for his defense of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. His compassion for the victims of Nazism led him to become a director of the National Refugee Service and co-chairman of the Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born. As the national and international situation grew more tense through the 1930's, he devoted his Monday chapel talks to attempts to make students more aware of the issues in national and international affairs. After his retirement in 1939, Neilson settled in Falls Village, Connecticut, where he had bought a remodeled farmhouse. He continued to spend part of the winters in Northampton, working on a history of Smith College, and he died there in 1946 of a coronary thrombosis. His ashes were buried on the Smith campus, appropriately in the midst of a natural garden he had planned on a hillside."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/William-Allan-Neilson", "page_content": "William Allan Neilson (28 March 1869 \u2013 1946) was a Scottish-American educator, writer and lexicographer, graduated in the University of Edinburgh in 1891 and became a Ph.D. in Harvard University in 1898.

Bill attended Franklin and Bellerive State schools and (A. G.) Ogilvie High School, New Town, which prepared students in commercial subjects for the Intermediate certificate. Leaving school at 14, he entered Commonwealth employment as a junior clerk in the Postmaster-General\u2019s Department. At 16 he joined the Australian Labor Party. In November 1946 he was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly as a member for Franklin, the youngest serving parliamentarian in the British Commonwealth and the youngest candidate ever elected to an Australian parliament. He was immediately elected Labor whip, a role he retained until 1955.\n\nOn 25 May 1948 at the office of the government statist, Melbourne, Neilson married 18-year-old Jill Benjamin. The pair had eloped when her father refused to consent to the marriage because of her age. Her mother, Phyllis Benjamin, was later a Labor member (1952-75) of the State\u2019s Legislative Council and, as leader of the government in the Upper House (1968-69), a close colleague of Neilson.\n\nBy the mid-1950s Neilson was considered to be the State\u2019s most promising Labor back-bencher. Following the election in October 1956, he was sworn in as minister for the Tourist and Immigration Department, and also for forestry, in (Sir) Robert Cosgrove\u2019s cabinet. When Eric Reece became premier in August 1958 Neilson was entrusted with the ministry of education; for two months he was also attorney-general. Despite his limited formal schooling, he became a confident and innovative minister of education. Several new high schools were opened and two-year matriculation colleges were introduced. A keen planner, Neilson absorbed information quickly and cultivated interests in Tasmanian history and literature and in the performing arts.\n\nDuring the late 1960s the Reece government lost momentum and popularity and the premier relied heavily on an inner circle of ministers comprising Roy Fagan, Mervyn Everett and Neilson. At its State conference in February 1968 the ALP elected Neilson its president. His first challenge in the post was to argue vigorously against the expulsion of the maverick right-wing union organiser and secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labor Council, Brian Harradine, who had claimed that 'friends of the communists' on the executive were trying to silence him. Minister for education until the government\u2019s defeat at the 1969 election, he resumed the portfolio after the party\u2019s landslide victory in April 1972.\n\nThe next few years witnessed considerable turbulence within the State Labor Party, including a 'revolt' in 1973 by members of Labor Youth of Tasmania. In April 1974 Neilson was elected deputy-premier; relinquishing education, he took on the portfolios of attorney-general, police and licensing, and the environment. When Reece stepped down as premier on 31 March 1975, Neilson was immediately elected to the leadership by caucus, and was strongly endorsed by the outgoing premier. The two likely rival candidates, Neil Batt and Michael Barnard, who had been active in the 'youth rebellion' against Reece, were not given the opportunity to contest the position.\n\nAs premier, Neilson also assumed the treasury and planning and development portfolios. His first year in office was unusually difficult. In addition to having to justify ongoing budget deficits, he was faced with the unresolved Harradine affair and the resulting conflict between the federal and State ALP executives. The government also had to deal with the social consequences of the Tasman Bridge collapse. Neilson was a resident of the eastern shore and among those deprived of easy road access to the city; he regularly joined the morning queue for an improvised and limited ferry service. Highly strung, and susceptible to tension and stomach aliments, Neilson suffered nervous exhaustion through the latter phase of his premiership and in mid-1977 he proposed to cabinet that he vacate office to become Tasmania\u2019s agent-general in London. Stepping down as premier on 1 December, he took up the agent-general\u2019s post in January 1978. That year he was appointed AC.\n\nNeilson\u2019s bass-baritone voice and his attraction to the stage, particularly popular musicals, had offered light relief to the demands of political life, and he sometimes parried colleagues, including the Opposition leader, (Sir) Max Bingham, with cheeky verse and song. At parliament\u2019s farewell dinner for Neilson, Bingham suggested that one of the retiring premier\u2019s signature tunes, 'If I were a rich man', should, in light of his forthcoming agent-general\u2019s salary, become 'Now I am a rich man!'\n\nDuring Neilson\u2019s third year as agent-general, his successor as premier, Douglas Lowe, announced that the London post was proving too expensive to run and would be closed. Neilson publicly challenged the decision, even though his own precarious health made it unlikely that he would serve a second term. Back in Hobart, he became an occasional columnist and theatre reviewer for the Mercury, and retained a close interest in Labor Party affairs and Australian rules football. He also enjoyed reading, chess and playing cards. His last few years were marred by ill health. Survived by his wife and their three daughters and adopted son, he died of cancer on 9 November 1989 at his South Hobart home and was cremated. Although he admitted to no firm religious belief, Neilson had planned the proceedings for his state funeral, held at St David\u2019s Anglican Cathedral on 13 November.\n\nThroughout his thirty-one years as a politician Neilson had been clearly identified as a populist, who retained a close grass-roots connection with his electorate. He enjoyed a broadly based popularity and worked hard to sustain it. Although he entered parliament as a self-styled radical, as a minister he was seldom driven by doctrine. Writing in the Hobart Mercury, a political journalist, Wayne Crawford, credited him with 'innate political adroitness'. In retirement Neilson cited his handling of the education portfolio as his proudest achievement. His portrait, painted by Clifton Pugh in 1978, hangs in Parliament House, Hobart."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/william-allen-neilson/", "page_content": "William Allan Neilson (28 March 1869 \u2013 1946) was a Scottish-American educator, writer and lexicographer, graduated in the University of Edinburgh in 1891 and became a Ph.D. in Harvard University in 1898.

About 1867 he returned to Almonte, where he trained as a machinist. After securing his journeyman\u2019s papers he found work in Toronto with iron-founders Dickey, Neill and Company. In 1873 he moved to Brockville; at the time of his marriage he advertised himself as an agent for Singer sewing machines. By 1878 he had become the proprietor of a fancy goods store, but he did not meet with much success. After falling into insolvency in the early 1880s, he gave temporary responsibility for the store to his wife; in 1889 he announced that he was selling out, \u201chaving made arrangements to open a business in Chicago.\u201d\n\nInstead, Neilson moved in 1890 to Toronto. Again insolvent, he opened a grocery, flour, and feed business in his wife\u2019s name on Parkdale (Sorauren) Avenue. It too proved disappointing; on at least one occasion he left to work for ready money on a brother\u2019s farm in North Dakota. Many years later he said that he had produced his first ice-cream \u2013 \u201ca few gallons daily\u201d \u2013 in 1891. By 1893, however, he had quit retailing altogether and relocated on Lynd Avenue, where, aided by his wife and children, he began manufacturing ice-cream on a commercial scale. Reportedly some 3,750 gallons were produced in the first season. Although the family kept a few cows, when more cream was required Neilson purchased whole milk, took off the cream, and retailed the skim milk door-to-door along with his wife\u2019s mincemeat.\n\nNeilson built his reputation on high-quality products made with the purest ingredients, a reputation that he would carefully guard. His ice-cream had a very high butterfat content \u2013 in 1908 it would test at 21.9 to 24.9 per cent, making it substantially richer than the products of his competitors or the premium brands of today. In the early years most of his sales were to druggists, confectioners, and restaurants and took the form of bulk, two-gallon containers packed in crushed ice and salt. As well, he produced fancy and seasonal moulded novelties. Until the turn of the century his chief rivals were the bakers, dairies, and confectioners who made ice-cream in the warmer months. In 1900, to advance their own knowledge, Mary Neilson and her son Fred Harry Morden attended the dairy school at the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph. That same year, in Toronto, Walter Edward Hart Massey* and others founded the City Dairy Company Limited to produce sanitary milk products, a large-scale venture that targeted in particular the more than 300 local dealers who delivered milk in unsterilized containers and the Italian street vendors who sold penny ices.\n\nThough Neilson may have welcomed such high-minded competition, he took no chances and moved decisively to strengthen his business. He stopped buying milk, gave up his milk routes, and contracted to buy the cream he needed. Next, taking his lead from a rival (probably City Dairy), he began about 1903 to package his ice-cream as bricks as well as in bulk. Unlike his competitor, which made quart-sized bricks, he adopted the pint, an astute move when few homes had the means to store ice-cream properly. He also declined to follow the example of manufacturers who opened ice-cream parlours in competition with their customers. By 1910 he claimed to supply over 500 Toronto confectioners and druggists daily, having virtually saturated the market. Ice-cream from City Dairy, his largest competitor, was available in fewer than a third this number of outlets. In time Neilson also acquired considerable expertise in distribution, most of it within 600 miles of Toronto.\n\nThe new factory Neilson opened on Gladstone Avenue in 1905 was essential to the growth of his business. Equipped with the most modern refrigerating equipment, it had a daily capacity of 2,500 gallons of ice-cream and 15 tons of ice. Additions were made in 1906 to accommodate ice-crushers and tanks, and in 1910 and 1912 for the manufacture of confectionery. In 1907 the business was incorporated as William Neilson Limited.\n\nNeilson\u2019s diversification into confectionery started modestly enough in 1908 as a way of keeping his ice-cream makers busy during the winter. The shift also made sense because the shopkeepers who stocked his ice-cream sold confectionery too. By 1911 he was offering at least three varieties of boxed milk chocolates; shortly afterwards he launched a line of chocolate bars similar to ones introduced by the firms of Gilbert White Ganong and William Church Moir* in the Maritimes and John Warren Cowan* in Toronto. As the demand for chocolate exceeded expectations, the sideline took on its own identity. Ideas of sharing staff were abandoned when sales of both ice-cream and candy boomed and when it became clear that the ice-cream makers, most of them men, had less dexterity than women for dipping candy. In 1912 Neilson employed between 160 and 170 females in his candy department and about 100 men elsewhere, as ice-cream makers, delivery men, and clerks. By the outbreak of war in 1914, he was making more than 560,000 pounds of chocolate per annum.\n\nIn 1911 Neilson had purchased a former cheese factory in Beachville, Ont., and equipped it to process milk from the area\u2019s many dairy farms, thus securing a larger and more reliable supply of cream. When Canada\u2019s dairy and cold storage commissioner surveyed 60 ice-cream manufacturers on the eve of World War I, all reported growing volumes. The cream they used, the commissioner estimated, was equivalent to that required to make about two million pounds of butter. Since Neilson\u2019s annual production of ice-cream was then about one million gallons, it follows that his share of the Canadian market (excluding the amount made in homes and on farms) exceeded 60 per cent.\n\nAfter William Neilson\u2019s death in 1915, his son Morden became president of the prospering company; another son, Charles Edward, was secretary-treasurer, and a third son, James William Allen, was a vice-president. In the manner perhaps of their mother, Morden had been a strong source of support and advice since the late 1890s. Indeed, without his help it is doubtful that Neilson, who was 49 when he began his greatest venture, could have been as successful. Ice-cream and chocolate were his life, and to them he devoted all his energies.\n\nStephen A. Otto"}]}
