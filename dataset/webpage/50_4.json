Born in Melbourne, Gielnik grew up in Queensland playing a different kind of round ball sport: basketball. Injuries saw her eventually pick up football at age 12.\n\nShe played her junior football at Redlands United. Current Junior Matildas coach and Football Australia Women\u2019s Technical Advisor Rae Dower was the Technical Director at the club when Gielnik was there.\n\nDespite making the Queensland squad for the National Championships, Gielnik didn\u2019t make it into the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) team.\n\nShe would end up in the QAS team eventually, thanks to a school trip to Canberra where she took part in a Matildas training session at the AIS under then-coach Tom Sermanni.\n\n\n\nSermanni suggested Gielnik to the QAS coach at the time, Jeff Hopkins, who would go on to work with Gielnik in the W-League at Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory.\n\nGielnik\u2019s domestic career mirrored that of her national team one. A strong season in orange saw her earn the \u2018super sub\u2019 tag where she helped the Roar make a grand final. Later in 2012, she made her senior national team debut against Japan at the age of 20.\n\nBut after breaking into the national team, she spent some time away from the W-League and the Matildas.\n\nShe explored passions outside football and opened a gym, working on her own fitness and helping others. Fitness is still something that interests her as she is currently undertaking a Bachelor of Exercise Science alongside club and country teammate Clare Polkinghorne.\n\nGielnik worked hard to get back onto the national team radar. While she didn\u2019t make the squad for the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in Canada, she was a part of the team which qualified for the Rio Olympics the following year.\n\n\n\nThe forward scored her first national team goal in that tournament in a 9-0 win over Vietnam.\n\nHowever, with plenty of talent and a small squad, Gielnik didn\u2019t make the final cut. Instead, she travelled as an alternate player.\n\nAt the time, Gielnik said her omission left her genuinely heartbroken and described it as the biggest emotional toll football had ever taken on her.\n\nFollowing on from being so close to selection, Gielnik moved to Norway before linking back up with Jeff Hopkins, this time at Melbourne Victory in the W-League.\n\nA \u2018feel good, play well\u2019 kind of player, Gielnik returned to the national team fold and began to cement herself in the team, adding more goals to her tally.\n\nShe was selected to go to Jordan in 2018 for the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup and to France in 2019 where she played in three of Australia\u2019s four matches.\n\nA move to German giants Bayern Munich saw her learn plenty about herself but she returned to Scandinavia and the W-League once again.\n\n\n\nA scintillating 2020-21 season with Brisbane Roar saw Gielnik take home the golden boot before she signed for Vittsj\u00f6 in Sweden. With 10 goals in 42 games for her country, the determined and dedicated Gielnik is inching ever close to half a century of caps.\n\nA strong presence with the ability to play on the wing and more centrally, Gielnik is an invaluable asset to the Matildas in Tokyo."}, {"url": "https://beyond90.com.au/part-i-the-making-of-emily-gielnik/", "page_content": "If there was ever a moment that encapsulates the evolution of Emily Gielnik, it was a superb strike against Korea Republic in the 2019 Cup of Nations.\n\nDeep in the match, the 26 year old drifted in from the left wing, sized up the full back, cut inside and rifled a strike at the near post.\n\nIt was a strike of a player full of confidence and at the height of her powers.\n\nGielnik has become a hot topic of conversation for women\u2019s football fans of late, with her newly-commanding presence on the pitch leaving those new to the game wondering where this prolific forward came from.\n\nHer story is one of resilience, grit and determination. One of being knocked down and finding your steel.\n\nMaking choices\n\nIt was not a forgone conclusion that Gielnik would end up in football. Like many Matildas, Gielnik was a naturally gifted athlete from a young age with a penchant towards competing with the best.\n\nA basketballer to begin with, it was a serendipitous intervention from her mother that led to her finding a ball at her feet.\n\n\u201cI was one of those kids who could play any sport, I was very competitive and would play basketball and rugby against the boys,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cMum would stress about me getting injured, so as a compromise, I convinced her to let me play football instead and that\u2019s where my journey started.\u201d\n\nGielnik realised early on that she had a knack for scoring goals \u2013 it would be a theme of her career.\n\n\u201cIn the early days, I was never about the discipline or the skill of football, I just played for fun and would score from anywhere and everywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cI actually scored 62 goals the first school season I played and most of them were toe punts because I\u2019d never had a coach to teach me that technique back then.\u201d\n\nOnce she received the proper coaching her transition to the beautiful game was seamless. Soon the Queenslander would be impressing those around her, resulting in her selection for U12s State Team.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started playing in a proper team, I had a world of confidence,\u201d she remembered.\n\n\u201cI was in my prime. I wasn\u2019t the most skilled player, but I had the speed, agility and competitiveness that helped me pick things up really quickly.\u201d\n\nThis natural athletic ability would continue to guide her to success.\n\nTaking the long road\n\nCheryl Salisbury, Diane Alagich, Joey Peters, Heather Garriock \u2013 they are some of the luminaries of Australian women\u2019s football.\n\nAnd in 2007 in Coffs Harbour, they were preparing for what would be a history making FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup campaign in China.\n\nWatching on was a young Emily Gielnik and what she saw on that day changed the trajectory of her life.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I saw the Matildas play in Coffs Harbour when I was 14, I knew I wanted to make the team one day,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\nAlthough the decision was made in her young mind, Gielnik\u2019s pathway to elite football was not going to be easy, nor conventional.\n\nShe learnt early on, that she was going to have to make the journey her own.\n\n\u201cThat year [2007] was really tough for me as I\u2019d had some bad injuries and missed out on selection. So I took a year off, which was really make or break for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of my friends received invitations from the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) but having that year off combined with some injuries meant I didn\u2019t make it.\n\n\u201cAll I wanted was to play in the Young Matildas and the W-League. I saw everyone get ahead of me, which was tough, but it didn\u2019t deter me, it motivated me to find another way.\u201d\n\nWhile it felt like doors were closing around the young footballer, in another fortuitous moment, a door opened up for Gielnik. And again, it involved the Matildas.\n\n\u201cAfter I missed out on QAS, I went on a school tour to the Australian Institute of Sport and the Matildas just happened to be training there with Tom Sermanni. My school coach asked if I could join in and I had an absolute blinder,\u201d Gielnik recalled.\n\n\u201cI was 15, totally intimidated and playing against the best female footballers in the country, but Tom called my coach afterwards wanting to get me into the QAS program and that was where I found my way in.\u201d\n\nMastering the art of resilience\n\nBeing a part of the QAS program opened new avenues for Gielnik.\n\nThat same year she also achieved another one of her goals by making the Brisbane Roar squad for the inaugural W-League season in 2008.\n\nCoached by Jeff Hopkins, it was a Brisbane Roar team littered with some of the greats of Australian women\u2019s football in Kate McShea and future stars including Clare Polkinghorne, Tameka Butt and Elise Kellond-Knight-Knight.\n\nAgain, the progress was tempered by a setback, The 16 year old was sidelined for the entire season after sustaining a stress fracture to her ankle.\n\nNot for the first time in her young career, Gielnik would have to call on her resilience. Gielnik didn\u2019t have time to grieve, as her eyes were firmly set on recovering and proving herself to her teammates and to herself.\n\n\u201cWhen I first made the Brisbane Roar squad, I was so nervous and more than anything I just wanted to gain the respect of the older players,\u201d she shared.\n\n\u201cIt took me a long time to believe I deserved to be there. I was disciplined and just spent the first few seasons earning my spot and spending a lot of time in the grandstands and on the bench.\u201d\n\nGielnik believes it was a change in mindset that led to her performance improving and earning her moniker, the \u2018super sub.\u2019\n\n\u201cAfter years of injury, missing out on squads and spending finals in the grandstands, I finally got my chance in the 2011/12 season.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was subbed on in extra time and in that season scored 12 goals, all while only being on for five or 10 minutes.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I started to believe in myself and prove my worth, that everything came together.\u201d\n\nHer form continued and Gielnik ticked another goal off her list, making the Young Matildas squad.\n\nDuring her junior national team debut at the AFC U19 Women\u2019s Championships, the then 19-year-old took the Young Matildas from a 3-1 deficit to a 4-3 win, when she scored an incredible hattrick in the second half.\n\n\u201cDuring that game, I really felt like I hadn\u2019t played a good first half of football,\u201d she said of her first match as a Young Matilda.\n\n\u201cWe were down 1-0 and I was panicking. I thought to myself, \u2018I\u2019m going to be subbed off on my debut,\u2019 but then I scored that first goal which gave me so much confidence and I just kept scoring.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat game was a real turning point in my career and one of my key memories in the green and gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the first time I felt like I belonged and deserved to be in that team. It showed me that even though you may have some bad minutes or a bad half there is always a way to turn it around.\u201d\n\nAnd turn it around she did, making her debut for the senior Matildas the following year in Japan.\n\n\u201cIt was so overwhelming because there were so many girls in that team I had idolised and never truly believed I would be up there with,\u201d Gielnik recounted of her Matildas debut.\n\n\u201cInstead of looking up to them as a fan, I was now competing for their position which was pretty surreal.\n\n\u201cIt came to a point where I had to see myself as an equal and understand that I had a job to do in representing my country.\n\n\u201cInstead of thinking about how lucky I was, I had to embrace that this was now my reality.\u201d\n\nThe 14 year old who had watched her heroes years before was now playing alongside them in the jersey she dreamed to pull on.\n\nPART II: The making of Emily Gielnik will be published on 17 March\n\nRelated Images:"}, {"url": "https://thewomensgame.com/news/third-times-the-charm-for-gielnik-525158", "page_content": "Gielnik made her Matildas debut in 2012 when she was 20 but with Australia's strong attacking prowess which featured the likes of Sam Kerr, Kyah Simon, Caitlin Foord and Lisa De Vanna, it was hard to get a foothold in the squad.\n\nShe missed out on the 2015 World Cup squad after changes to the coaching staff but a determine Gielnik wasn't going to give up.\n\nIn 2016 she found herself back in the green and gold after a superb season for her then club Brisbane Roar put her on Alen Stajcic's map for the Matildas Olympic qualifying squad.\n\nThe Matildas would go on to be undefeated in the qualification tournament while Gielnik also scored a goal.\n\nHowever, it was a heartbreaking moment when Gielnik just missed out on the Rio Olympics squad.\n\n\"I think the biggest challenge by far that stood out to me the most was shyly missing out of on the Olympics, just missed out by one there,\" she said.\n\n\"I think that was the most devastation I've felt in my career.\n\n\"I knew that feeling and I never wanted to have it again so I think that left a big desire in my heart.\"\n\n\"I am crying, but it's a good cry!\"\n\n\n\nWatch the moment @EGielnik found out she made the squad for France \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 pic.twitter.com/jgKHYx3cIl \u2014 Westfield Matildas (@TheMatildas) May 14, 2019\n\nThe 27-year-old has been flourishing in the Matildas and has been a regular member of the team since missing out on that Olympic team.\n\nHowever, since her return to Melbourne, there has been more confidence in her playing ability.\n\nGielnik played a major role in Victory lifting the Premiership in the past W-League season with her pace and eye for goal."}, {"url": "https://www.foxsports.com.au/football/w-league/emily-gielniks-move-to-melbourne-victory-is-paying-off-as-the-matilda-looks-to-lock-in-a-world-cup-spot/news-story/4ed1095158941733f24e097ec4ca275b", "page_content": "Emily Gielnik had a decision to make.\n\nLess than a year out from the Women\u2019s World Cup, the dynamic winger had two options: stay at W-League powerhouse Brisbane Roar, the club she\u2019d joined as a teenager \u2014 or take on a new challenge.\n\nThe latter option was joining her former Roar manager Jeff Hopkins at Melbourne Victory \u2014 a club trying to return from three years in the finals wilderness.\n\nWith the pain of missing out on the Matildas\u2019 2015 World Cup and 2016 Olympics squads still burning fiercely, Gielnik turned her back on the comfort of home and threw herself headlong into a move interstate.\n\n\u201cWell to be honest, Jeff has asked me (to come to Victory) the last couple of years and it wasn\u2019t until this year I made the move,\u201d Gielnik told foxsports.com.au.\n\n\u201cI think I personally needed a bit of a challenge, a change of environment, just being around a different diverse of players and I just really needed to challenge myself in football.\n\n\u201cSo I really feel like I just needed something new to be honest, I just didn\u2019t want to become stagnant and be at the same place for such a long time.\n\n\u201cBut my loyalty was really, really important to me. If I could\u2019ve, I would\u2019ve stayed at Brisbane for the rest of my life, the rest of my football career.\n\n\u201cBut I really think that looking at the bigger picture in terms of the World Cup, this was a really critical move for me and \u2026 when I made the decision, it wasn\u2019t overnight it was weeks and weeks and it was an emotional one.\n\n\u201cSo it was a really calculated decision and I think so far for me, it\u2019s proven to be a good one.\u201d\n\nEmily Gielnik and Laura Alleway celebrate (Photo by Scott Barbour/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images\n\nSix weeks into the W-League season, Gielnik is reaping the rewards of her bold move.\n\nVictory is sitting pretty, undefeated and outright top of the table, with the winger nominated for the PFA\u2019s recent W-League player of the month award.\n\nIn her five appearances for Victory, Gielnik has scored one goal, assisted one, made 10 key passes, created 11 chances and provided 23 crosses.\n\nShe\u2019s also combined beautifully with captain Natasha Dowie and star playmaker Christine Nairn, with the trio comprising one of the W-League\u2019s most intimidating attacks.\n\n\u201cI think if you look at it in the perspective of a couple of weeks, it feels really good, obviously because of where we are as a team and everything,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cAnd me personally, I\u2019ve already felt a lot of improvement. Most importantly, it\u2019s just in my happiness and my mentality more than anything and I\u2019ve got a really good support network in terms of leaving home as well.\n\n\u201cAnd obviously the staff here is great and obviously Jeff has the best intentions for me, so they\u2019re really going above and beyond to try and cater for everything that I need football-wise. So that was really important to me in the lead up to making that decision to play for Victory.\n\n\u201cBut obviously I already feel a really good shift and a good change for me so far but I think there\u2019s still over half a season to go and much more improvement that I\u2019m longing for, definitely, with the World Cup being obviously in my sights but the team being the priority of course at the moment.\u201d\n\nEmily Gielnik. (AAP Image/Julian Smith) Source: AAP\n\nIf moving states was one sacrifice that\u2019s paid off, then Gielnik\u2019s other big call was at least as significant.\n\nThe Matilda recently made the decision to end the lease on the gym she\u2019s owned and run for several years \u2014 and admits pulling the pin on that ambition to focus solely on her football has lifted a weight off her shoulders.\n\n\u201cTo cut a long story short \u2014 I honestly just feel like things in my life are going good and I have such a great support network and I have really, really good friends and I started to really put football first,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cMy gym actually, ShredEm Fitness, that had been a lifelong dream for me that I opened before I was in the Matildas, I\u2019ve actually just ended the lease there and decided to put all my focus into football. So that was a big thing for me.\n\n\u201cPurely because football is not forever and that dream job is something I can always come back to, no matter the age. So I really just want to \u2014 after years and years of sacrifice to football, I thought this was really the ultimate thing to do just to give it everything that I\u2019ve got and enjoy every single challenge and experience because I\u2019m obviously lucky enough to have the opportunity to be a contracted Matilda at the moment.\n\n\u201cSo I weighed up some options and it\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t take it (football) seriously before, it\u2019s just more that I\u2019ve really made it a massive part of my life, which it has been for a long time.\n\n\u201cAnd so I think I\u2019ve been a lot happier and a lot more focused and I\u2019ve really dedicated a lot of my time to it off the field as well now, more from a mental aspect and keeping myself in good condition and in other parts of fitness to make sure that I\u2019m physically good on the park.\u201d\n\nEmily Gielnik.

It also meant that reality would hit quickly and often as she moved in and out of the national team program.\n\n\u201cMy first couple of years in the Matildas, I had some big ups and some really big downs,\u201d she shared.\n\n\u201cI was just very inconsistent. I lost that sense of self-belief and I questioned whether or not I belonged in the team anymore.\u201d\n\nLike many women\u2019s footballers in the Australian system, Gielnik was juggling working and football. Unlike many others, Gielnik had decided go out on her own by creating a small fitness business, Shred Em fitness.\n\nStarted in her garage, it quickly grew to become a thriving business that kept the young entrepreneur occupied.\n\nHowever, the success off the field began to impact Gielnik\u2019s success on it.\n\n\u201cAt one stage, Staj (Alen Stajcic) left me out of a tournament against China, which was actually the best thing for me. He had every right to do that because I didn\u2019t believe I was worthy of being there,\u201d she remembered.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t training or performing the way I should\u2019ve been and representing your country is a performance-based privilege.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt served as a good chance for me to consider if and how I could come back from that. I was in and out of the squad for a couple of years and was juggling my personal training business, Shred Em, and was just not choosing football, so I had to make a tough decision.\u201d\n\nGielnik made the call and put her business aspirations on hold to fully commit to football.\n\n\u201cIf you want to be at the top level you need to make those changes and really live at the top level, there is no 50/50 you are either all in or all out,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo in the end I gave up Shred Em, which I loved, but once I fully committed and just indulged myself into living and breathing the game, that\u2019s when everything changed.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BreDwIXB7bS/\n\nRe-finding focus\n\nDespite her re-commitment to the football, Gielnik found her form just a little too late ahead of the 2015 World Cup.\n\nWhile there were big changes occurring for the 24 year old off the pitch, there were more subtle but no less career altering changes occurring on the pitch.\n\nAt six feet, Emily Gielnik cuts a commanding figure on the football pitch. As a striker, there is the inclination to play her in the traditional centre forward role to utilise her height and strength.\n\nThat number 9 role was basis of her early success and selection in the Matildas. The problem with pigeon holing the forward into that traditional mindset is that it didn\u2019t utilise all of Gielnik\u2019s attributes.\n\nAs well as her height, Gielnik has always possessed deceptive pace. Running Shred Em Fitness and practicing what she was preaching saw her increase her aerobic capacity and become a more honed athlete. Along with her fitness work, she was also refining her football skills and touch and developing her final ball.\n\nSpeed, stamina, dribbling, crossing and goal scoring; Emily Gielnik was no longer a centre forward, she was a now built to be a winger. And out wide she went.\n\nA familiar theme\n\nBy the time 2016 Rio Olympic Games qualification came around in February 2016, the 24-year-old was back to feeling like she belonged.\n\n\u201cI really got back into it after the World Cup, I was playing good football. I was happy and Alen brought me back into the squad.\u201d\n\nThe Matildas had a barnstorming run to qualify for Rio. They finished the qualifiers undefeated, on top of the standings and, for the first time, the number one ranked team in Asia.\n\nRight in the thick of the action was Emily Gielnik, in her new role out wide.\n\n\u201cWe went to the Olympic qualifiers and did really well, it was the first time I\u2019d felt good in a long time. My coach was positive and I was in the best physical condition I\u2019d ever been in.\u201d\n\nWhat followed next was six months of intense preparation for the chance at realising another lifetime dream \u2013 becoming an Olympian.\n\nScoring goals, playing her best football, with her confidence at an all-time high and her body in peak condition, Gielnik wasn\u2019t prepared for what was to come.\n\n\u201cI had that dreaded meeting where I was told I was the first player on standby for the Rio Olympics and had missed out by one spot,\u201d she remembered.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t just a tournament I was missing out on, the Olympics are so special and so prestigious, every kid dreams of being an Olympian one day, so to miss out was completely devastating.\n\n\u201cThat was the biggest emotional toll football has ever taken on me. I was genuinely heartbroken.\u201d\n\nMoving forward, again\n\nAfter all the sporting adversity, the blow of missing out on the Olympic Games could have been the final straw for Gielnik.\n\nWhen asked if she considered throwing in the towel she said, \u201cNot for a second.\u201d In fact, it spurred the Queenslander on once again.\n\n\u201cFrom that point on, I chose to never feel that again. I wanted to be in a position where, \u2018No, you\u2019re not coming,\u2019 wasn\u2019t an option anymore.\u201d\n\nThe tenacious forward carried on with this mindset and into the 2017 Algarve Cup.\n\nThe tournament proved to be another breakthrough moment where she reminded naysayers why she deserved to be in the squad.\n\nScoring three goals during the Matildas campaign, the 2017 Algarve Cup was a tournament where Gielnik used everything in her arsenal to demonstrate why she is an imposing figure for full backs to contend with.\n\nWhile an ankle injury ruled Gielnik out of the 2018 Algarve Cup, by the time the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup around, the winger was ready for her first major senior international tournament.\n\nGielnik played in three of Australia\u2019s matches helping the Matildas qualify for the 2019 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup.\n\nVictorious mentality\n\nThe months following the 2018 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup have been Emily Gielnik\u2019s best yet.\n\nFootball was again the focus when the 26 year old moved her life from Brisbane to Melbourne to play for the Melbourne Victory.\n\nIt also saw a reunion with Jeff Hopkins, her first senior coach at Brisbane Roar. The result was a stellar season with her four goals and two assists helping her new side transform from two-time wooden spoon winners, to 2018/19 W-League Premiers.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that although her athletic abilities are considerable, Emily Gielnik\u2019s path to a Matildas regular is really a story about mindset.\n\nAs every inspirational sports instagram quote will tell you, sport is about mentality.\n\nWhen asked where her upbeat outlook and mental toughness comes from, Gielnik says it was something she needed to learn.\n\n\u201cI was always my harshest critic and put so much pressure and expectation on myself,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI had to learn to take a step back and just enjoy the game without worrying what others think about me or how I should play.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe shift came when I just got back to doing what\u2019s natural and playing my own game.\n\n\u201cWhen I got back to the old me, I realised how happy that made me both within and outside of football,\u201d she said.\n\nEmily Gielnik's brilliant Matildas form 13 November \u26bd\ufe0f. 28 February \u26bd\ufe0f. 3 March \u26bd\ufe0f. Emily Gielnik has three goals in her last three appearances for the Westfield Matildas! Posted by Westfield Matildas on Sunday, 3 March 2019\n\nAnd her mindset extends to beyond just herself, also wanting the best for her team as a whole.\n\n\u201cI think I am just a positive person, towards myself and towards other players. Even if someone plays over me, I genuinely want them to do well, I want that player to feel so good and I want us to win together.\n\n\u201cAs much as I love scoring goals, I love setting others up, so they get the glory.\u201d\n\nThe next time Emily Gielnik pulls on the green and gold jersey, there will be an inscription on the inside that reads \u2018Never Say Die.\u2019 It is fitting for the poster girl for perseverance.\n\nIf Gielnik\u2019s evolution is any indication, her greatest feats are yet to come."}, {"url": "https://www.matildas.com.au/news/emily-gielnik-redefining-success", "page_content": "Emily Gielnik is redefining success and herself\n\nThe highs and lows of football not only define someone as football, but also as person. Westfield Matildas\u2019 forward Emily Gielnik embodies that notion.\n\nWith the world firmly placed on pause during the period of COVID-19, restrictions have shut down the normality of life around the globe.\n\nBeing in lockdown with your thoughts to keep you company can be in equal parts challenging and invigorating. For Emily Gielnik, isolation has been a time for reflection and consideration.\n\n\u201cI saw the light; you communicate more and you get to look at life from a different perspective,\u201d she said from her apartment in Munich, Germany.\n\n\u201cI was actually feeling quite fortunate. Even though football is my job, my career, my life and it\u2019s hard to go from doing what you love to not be doing it at all, but watching the news really put things into perspective for me.\u201d\n\nA TIME OF REFLECTION\n\nAfter returning from the AFC Women\u2019s Olympic Qualifiers, Emily Gielnik and her Bayern Munich teammates soon found themselves returning to their homes as COVID-19 restrictions came into effect in Germany.\n\nFor the 28-year-old, the restrictions occurred at a fortuitous time with both her mum and partner on hand to ride out the opening weeks.\n\n\u201cIt was nice to have her [Mum] here,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201c[We were] just sharing some good quality time. There was definitely a lot of laughs and a lot of cooking happening!\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter years of intermittent separation, the time mother and daughter spent together away from reality was a blessing.\n\n\u201cWhen you go over to their [her parents] house and you see them on the weekend, it\u2019s so rushed and you're not really there. You're replying to people and on social media. I feel like she was here, and I was actually engaging.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t been in quarantine, it would have been a lot different if she was here. I was at full time training and I would have only seen her a little bit in the morning and a little bit in the afternoon.\u201d\n\nFATHER & FRIEND\n\nEmily Gielnik admits that her life story is much like her football story; a tale of a late bloomer.\n\nUnlike many of her peers, with basketball and rugby being her first loves, Gielnik didn\u2019t playing football until the age of twelve. Even then, it was after much encouragement on the part of the teenager to coax her parents to let her take to the pitch.\n\n\u201cIt took a lot of persuading in terms of my Mum and her letting me play soccer because she thought it's such high injury sport - although I played rugby against boys so I can't comprehend it,\u201d she laughed.\n\nGielnik made the switch from rugby to football and never looked back (Supplied: Emily Gielnik)\n\nWhile her Mum may have been apprehensive about those first steps, Gielnik\u2019s Dad was right beside her every step of the way.\n\n\u201cI had that Dad that was always taking me to every sporting event possible,\u201d she remembered fondly.\n\n\u201cHe would watch all my basketball games; all my football games and he was without a doubt that man that is running up and down the sidelines of the game and yelling at you to stop watching the play.\u201d\n\nGielnik credits her father\u2019s patience and support for pushing her to the next level. Criticism, no matter how constructive, can be a difficult to take on as a teenager. Looking back with the time and distance, Gielnik has no doubt his influence shaped her into the player she needed to be in order become a professional player.\n\n\u201cI always wanted to be pro one day,\u201d she said \u201cI didn't grow up with this those skills or that coaching, I just had my Dad,\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he could sense that I wanted to get there so then he was criticising me, maybe at times he was criticising me too tough.\u201d\n\nHe just wanted to make me better because maybe he could see that I could make it to the top and he knew I could be good.\u201d\n\nAt the age of 15, Gielnik made the Queensland squad for the National Championships at Coffs Harbour but as her friends and teammates made their way into the Queensland Academy of Sport, Gielnik never received a letter.\n\nOpportunities can pop up in the strangest of places and while on a school trip where she visited the Australian Institute of Sport, Gielnik got her chance to train with the Westfield Matildas. Her letter from QAS came shortly after.\n\nThat finally put Gielnik on the path she had wanted for so long. A season with the QAS resulted in the striker earning a contract the following year with a star studded Brisbane Roar outfit.\n\nGielnik settling into the Matildas (Photo Credit: Rachel Bach / By the White Line)\n\nAfter a successful 2011/12 season with Roar, where she earned the moniker of \u2018super sub\u2019, Gielnik finally earned a call up to the Westfield Matildas.\n\nHer first appearance for the Westfield Matildas came in Japan in 2012. While it might have been an ocean away, her father wasn\u2019t far away from her thoughts. These days he is a fixture Westfield Matildas home matches and proudly boasts the number 15.\n\n\u201cHe wears that jersey with pride\u2026you can\u2019t miss him!\u201d Gielnik laughed.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m in the starting line-up whomever is next to me is like \u2018oh my god Em, that\u2019s your Dad\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm actually playing for two people. Sometimes he lines up a shot and fully kicks like an air swing on the sideline. He's got like that as if he's kicked it. He's a part of the game, like he's a part of us.\u201d\n\nREDEFINING SUCCESS\n\nIn a scripted Disney production, realising a dream and playing for the Westfield Matildas should have been the beginning of a long and steady stint in the senior national team.\n\nHowever, in real life, Gielnik\u2019s ride was set to be a rollercoaster instead. That first run with the national team was followed by long periods away, and more frustrating periods of being close but not quite close enough.\n\n2015 saw her omission from the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup and 2016 resulted in heartbreak after being a part of the 2016 Rio Olympic Games qualification campaign.\n\nEach time, the Queenslander has dusted herself off \u2013 although it has not been without some soul searching and exploring different outlets for self fulfillment.\n\n\n\n\"After I got cut from the Olympics, I started to realise that I\u2019ve got to do something that makes me happy now and I opened the gym [ShredEm Fitness],\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cEverything just went so well, and I had never been so happy so of course my football just skyrocketed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was like obsessed with helping people. I was obsessed with helping someone from being so miserable and not comfortable at any other gyms and then they came and gave me a shot,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI wasn't then putting so much pressure about making the Matildas squad or proving myself that stage I was like I got this gym now I'm just going to play W- League enjoy it and love it.\u201d\n\nOf course I was missing and craving the Matildas, but I stopped putting so much heavy pressure on myself thinking that that's all I wanted. I had the gym and so that created some happiness and some drive for me.\u201d\n\nEventually the off the field success began to impact Gielnik\u2019s success on it. A breakthrough 2017 Algarve Cup, a brilliant Westfield W-League season with Melbourne Victory in 2018/19 culminated in being named to her first major tournament squads for the 2018 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup and FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup 2019.\n\nFinding her confidence and goal scoring touch for the Westfield Matildas saw big clubs around the world begin to take notice of the powerful forward.\n\nAfter stints in the United States, Japan and Norway, Gielnik joined Frauen Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich.\n\n\u201cI heard from KK and Emily (Van Egmond), and people that have played in Germany, that their regiment was just craziness,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFor some reason I was longing for that environment.\u201d\n\n\n\nMoving halfway across the world with a language barrier was a welcome challenge for Gielnik but the move has also tested her in ways that were unforeseen. It has also precipitated further introspection from a larger than life figure.\n\nWhatever the level of football, success is a personal and intimate topic. It is one that, in her quiet times, she has had to grapple with and redefine to her own satisfaction.\n\n\u201cTo put it this way, I don't personally feel like I've accomplished everything I wanted to at this club,\u201d Gielnik said quietly.\n\n\u201cI got to play for this club but in all fairness, I don't feel like I've been successful at this club. I haven't come here and scored a ton of goals.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to overcome the feeling of failure and that's how I've actually felt here at Bayern and although I had a massive part of the team and I work hard \u2026 I don't feel as part of the success.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe physical challenges are what I thought I was getting here, but I'm getting the mental challenge here as a footballer.\u201d\n\nOn her own personal football journey, Bayern has proved to be one of the biggest challenges and the most instructive.\n\nGielnik\u2019s time in Germany over the last year has become her greatest learning experience, demonstrating that perseverance and determination aren\u2019t easily earned traits.\n\n\u201cI could have left on several occasions and I had offers in the transfer window to great clubs, but I thought about it and you know that\u2019s just not me.\u201d\n\nLeaving and giving up and quitting it wasn\u2019t me. I still wanted the opportunity to turn it around and see the light and to make the best of it and that's just like a part of my personality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe success, I will say, is that I came here as a player that the coach wanted. He wanted me because I was that different player but then wanted me to adjust adapt to the German style football and that's not in me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had to stay true to myself.\u201d\n\nEmily Gielnik is not sure what her next move will be. What is certain that wherever she goes she will once again be better equipped to face it.\n\nAfter all, they do say good things come to those who are wait \u2013 or a late bloomers."}, {"url": "https://www.olympics.com.au/olympians/emily-gielnik/", "page_content": "Fast Facts\n\nSport: Football\n\nEvent: Women's\n\nOlympic History: Tokyo 2020\n\nCoach: Tony Gustavsson\n\nYear Born: 1992\n\nState Born: Victoria\n\nAbout Emily\n\nEmily Gielnik had an Australian U19s debut for the ages, scoring a hat-trick on debut in October 2011.\n\nLess than 12 months later she received her first selection to the Matildas, appearing in a 3-0 defeat against Japan in July 2012 friendly.\n\nEmily was named in the Matildas Olympic qualifying squad for Rio 2016 and scored a goal against Vietnam, however wasn\u2019t named in the final team for the Olympics.\n\nShe appeared in all three matches for Australia at the 2018 Asian Cup.

Westfield Matildas forward Emily Gielnik is one of those stories.\n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the age of 12 that Gielnik started playing football, after injuries in basketball convinced her parents to encourage her to give a different round ball game a go.\n\nPlaying most of her junior football with Redlands United FC, Gielnik worked under the guidance of current Junior Matildas coach Rae Dower, who was Technical Director at the Cleveland-based club at the time.\n\n\u201cRae coming up was good for my development; she more or less gave me the confidence to be free as a player, take players on and score goals,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what made me become more of a goal scorer so most definitely she had impact when I was younger and obviously as I got older and matured as a player there are a lot of other coaches and people.\u201d\n\nIn her first season of playing, the Melbourne-born attacker made the Queensland squad for the National Championships at Coffs Harbour however, at the age of 15 with teammates and friends making the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) team, Gielnik didn\u2019t receive a letter.\n\nIt was a disappointing moment for the teenager.\n\nHowever, opportunities pop up in the strangest of ways and it was while on a school trip to Canberra when she visited the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), that an unbelievable chance came about.\n\nThe Matildas were training at the AIS with then Head Coach Tom Sermanni when Gielnik\u2019s sports teacher asked him if she could join the training session.\n\n\u201cI must have trained out of my skin even though I was so intimidated because it was all the best players in Australia, and all the really old-school Matildas were there,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTom Sermanni asked me to come back the next day and I played a training match with the Matildas.\u201d\n\nImpressed with Gielnik, Sermanni called Jeff Hopkins who was heading up the women\u2019s football program at QAS and recommended he get her into the program.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of how my journey kicked off,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\nShe played a whole season with the QAS before earning a contract the following year with Brisbane Roar, however an injury would keep her sidelined for the whole 2009 Westfield W-League season.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the following season at 18 that she made her debut.\n\nGielnik had to work incredibly hard to get her Westfield W-League opportunity and even in her first two seasons with the club she wouldn\u2019t see much game time with 15 of her 19 appearances coming from the bench.\n\nHowever, after a successful 2011-12 season with Roar, where she was dubbed the \u2018super sub\u2019 for her ability to score goals as a substitute, Gielnik earnt a call up to the Westfield Matildas.\n\nIt was a tough squad to break into at the time, particularly being a striker, with the likes of Sam Kerr, Lisa De Vanna and Kyah Simon just some of the players who had cemented spots in the national team.\n\nAfter making several appearances, Gielnik spent a couple of years away from the national team but fought her way back into Westfield Matildas fold for the 2016 Olympic qualification campaign.\n\nHowever, there was heartbreak when she just missed out on going to the Rio Olympics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening to be out of the squad but once you are it makes you realise how hungry you are to get back in,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\nAlways one to work hard, she continued to keep pushing and made the decision to leave Roar for Melbourne Victory ahead of the 2018-19 Westfield W-League season to reach new heights as a player.\n\nAll her hard work paid off when Gielnik got the phone call that she was selected in the Westfield Matildas FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup squad for the France tournament this year.\n\nIt was an emotional moment for the 27-year-old, who cried after hearing the news.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t really put a word on it to be honest,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more a sense of relief and satisfaction in a way with the build-up and how everything has come together.\n\n\u201cI know I spoke about it in W-League and how desperate I was to make this one so it was more the relief of what I had done had been recognised and I\u2019ve been rewarded for it.\u201d\n\nGielnik puts her recent selection for the national team down to perseverance and dedication.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just persistence and I think that\u2019s the key for me, the earlier I learnt that it takes more than training with the teams and that it takes dedication then that\u2019s where you\u2019ll be rewarded,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Westfield Matildas are currently in Antalya, Turkey for a 10-day camp as they prepare for their opening game of the World Cup on June 9 against Italy.\n\nImage: Matt King/Getty Images"}, {"url": "https://www.matildas.com.au/news/22-emily-gielnik-i-wasnt-going-stop-until-i-got-there", "page_content": "My Westfield Matildas Story: Emily Gielnik - 'I wasn\u2019t going to stop until I got to the World Cup'\n\nEmily Gielnik has always dreamed of running out as a Westfield Matilda at a FIFA World Cup.

With only 18-players able to be selected on an Olympic Football squad, Emily Gielnik missed out on making the Australian women\u2019s football team for the Rio 2016 Games by one spot. \u201c[It] was heart wrenching and disappointing, to say the least, I felt entirely defeated at that point, I felt like I had done what I could do, and I wasn't going,\u201d the Matildas forward, who had also missed out on the 2015 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup squad a year prior, told Tokyo 2020 in April. \u201cA very difficult time in my career to understand but moving past that was just as important for me so that's what I focussed on.\u201d The Brisbane-born footballer knew she wanted to be an Olympian as soon as she pulled on the green and gold jersey \u2013 making her senior national debut against Japan, Tokyo in 2012. \u201cI remember that feeling of actually watching the girls at the Olympics from my couch with my family and just how passionate and excited I was to be supporting them,\u201d Gielnik said. \u201cI knew that's what I wanted. I wanted to be on the on the other end of that, being a part of that. So that was more so when it really sunk in that I wanted that more than anything.\u201d Now the 28-year-old is squarely within the mix for Tokyo 2020 selection after scoring a double against Rio 2016 gold medallist Germany in Australia\u2019s 5-2 friendly loss last month.\n\nHowever, Gielnik wasn\u2019t the only Matilda to miss out five years ago with Aivi Luik also named as an alternate for Rio 2016. The 36-year-old told Tokyo 2020 it would be a dream come true to represent Australia at Tokyo 2020. \u201cTo be able to go there and compete with the best in a tournament that has such history, I think it would be amazing, it would be a once in a lifetime kind of experience. And it was something that I always wanted as a kid.\u201d\n\nThe ability to preserve Getting knocked down, facing challenges, and overcoming barriers is something both Gielnik and Luik know all too well. For Gielnik, after missing out on Rio 2016, she didn\u2019t let her determination die, she continued to work hard and made the decision to leave her long-time club Brisbane Roar for Melbourne Victory ahead of the 2018-19 W-League season. It was a move that would pay dividends as she made Australia\u2019s squad for the 2019 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in France. \u201cWhat I would put it down to, honestly, is just how I've approached every football season from then onwards leaving no stone unturned, just knowing my own body, knowing what it takes to stay at that top level and what's required of me in working alongside the clubs but also working on my own in terms of individual performance away from the football clubs,\u201d she said of her desire to continue being her best.\" \u201cThat's really what's got to me, is just honing in on that that focus and those extra things that have that kept me in the top level and keep giving me the opportunity to come back into the Matildas squad.\u201d Luik, who also got her start in the W-League with Brisbane Roar, had to wait a tad longer before making her World Cup debut despite making her international debut in 2010 and was part of Australia\u2019s victorious AFC Asian Cup team that year. But throughout her career she was plagued with injuries including bilateral hamstring tendinopathy. Despite missing out on selection for both the 2011 and 2015 World Cups then Rio 2016 Olympics, the midfielder continued playing because it had been her dream to go to a World Cup. \u201cAfter that second let down, I didn't really think it was going to be in the cards for me, but I continued to play,\u201d she said.\n\nAivi Luik (2018 Getty Images)\n\nIt was in 2018, seven years after her last appearance in the green and gold, that Luik took to the pitch as a Matilda once again during their 5-0 friendly win against Thailand and after a successful season with Spanish club Levante in 2019, she was on the radar of then Matildas coach Ante Milicic for the upcoming World Cup in France. Named in the 23-player World Cup squad, it wouldn\u2019t be until Australia\u2019s final group game that the Perth-born player would take to the field. \u201cI thought maybe I was going on and it didn't happen so I [was] starting to wonder if maybe it wouldn't happen but I did get that debut and it felt amazing,\u201d she said. Australia beat Jamaica 4-1 in that match. \u201cIt was really emotional afterwards, especially to see my brother and sister in the crowd. Having them witness my dream since I was a kid was amazing. It's very hard to put into words, but it's definitely one of the highlights of my life.\u201d\n\nTogether again after 400 days Assembling at Soest, the headquarters of the Dutch Football Federation, it was the first time since Australia had secured qualification for Tokyo 2020 in March last year during their 5-0 and 2-1 wins over Vietnam, that they were together again. And for many, it was the first time they had seen their national teammates \u2013 many have spent the last decade playing together in the green and gold \u2013 in over a year so there was excitement. \u201cIt was so good to see everyone again in camp, obviously, their familiar faces, but it's like you never left. It feels like we had we just saw them not long ago. So really exciting, really good vibes. We are one big family, and it was just so good to see everyone again,\u201d Gielnik said ahead of the team\u2019s first match in 400 days. With Australian-based players unable to be selected, it was up to the Matildas playing abroad to put their best foot forward in front of Tony Gustavsson, who was appointed head coach in September last year. The former United States assistant coach took the reins of Australia\u2019s most loved national team in the New Year but due to the global pandemic hadn\u2019t been able to meet players in person. With the playing group meeting Gustavsson for the first time, there were positive vibes around camp. \u201cTony has showed us the way that he believes we can play in order to get us to the next level,\u201d Luik said of the Swedish-born coach. \u201cThat's what we all want at the end of the day and through his words, through his intensity and the belief in us, I think that's really flowed through his meetings and how he runs training sessions.\u201d \u201cVery good energy, good vibe and most importantly, extremely encouraging just coming in. So that really works well for me,\u201d Gielnik said. \u201cI think me as a player, I really respond better with someone who really believes in me and has that positive energy to want you to get on the ball. So I'm really looking forward to what he's got in store for all of us.\u201d\n\nWelcoming the pressure From fighting for equality, recognition, and the right to play the game they love, the Matildas of today have become one of the most recognisable sport teams in Australia \u2013 and in women\u2019s football. Following their Rio 2016 quarter-finals loss in a penalty shootout, it was at the 2017 Tournament of Nations that Australia reached new heights as they beat Japan (4-2), the United States (1-0) and Brazil (6-1) to win their first piece of silverware since the 2010 AFC Asian Cup success. Going on to win their next four matches on home soil, the following year still saw solid performances including a fourth-placed finish at the 2018 Algarve Cup and runners-up performance at the 2018 AFC Asian Cup. The 2019 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup left more to be desired, as they bowed out in the quarter-finals to Norway, but their qualification for Tokyo 2020 once again brought excitement. While recent 5-2 and 5-0 losses to Germany and the Netherlands brought harsh critics from Australian media \u2013 just three months out from Tokyo 2020. But the pressure to produce results is something the side welcome. \u201cI think it's something that we enjoy and welcome with open arms, because if you're a team that is not doing well, there's no pressure on you so because we've risen through the rankings and we've got a name for ourselves, now there is that pressure but it's great,\u201d Luik said. \u201cIt means people are following us. People want us to do well, and people expect us to do well. And I think that can actually help with results in the times when the pressure can get a little much, we've got a really good playing group and we can look for support, and also from our family and friends and our fans or some of the best in the world. And I don't say that lightly. \u201cI think they care genuinely about our journeys and they care about our ups and downs and they really want to see us succeed.\""}, {"url": "https://www.olympics.com.au/olympians/emily-gielnik/", "page_content": "Fast Facts\n\nSport: Football\n\nEvent: Women's\n\nOlympic History: Tokyo 2020\n\nCoach: Tony Gustavsson\n\nYear Born: 1992\n\nState Born: Victoria\n\nAbout Emily\n\nEmily Gielnik had an Australian U19s debut for the ages, scoring a hat-trick on debut in October 2011.\n\nLess than 12 months later she received her first selection to the Matildas, appearing in a 3-0 defeat against Japan in July 2012 friendly.\n\nEmily was named in the Matildas Olympic qualifying squad for Rio 2016 and scored a goal against Vietnam, however wasn\u2019t named in the final team for the Olympics.\n\nShe appeared in all three matches for Australia at the 2018 Asian Cup.

Born in Melbourne, Gielnik grew up in Queensland playing a different kind of round ball sport: basketball. Injuries saw her eventually pick up football at age 12.\n\nShe played her junior football at Redlands United. Current Junior Matildas coach and Football Australia Women\u2019s Technical Advisor Rae Dower was the Technical Director at the club when Gielnik was there.\n\nDespite making the Queensland squad for the National Championships, Gielnik didn\u2019t make it into the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) team.\n\nShe would end up in the QAS team eventually, thanks to a school trip to Canberra where she took part in a Matildas training session at the AIS under then-coach Tom Sermanni.\n\n\n\nSermanni suggested Gielnik to the QAS coach at the time, Jeff Hopkins, who would go on to work with Gielnik in the W-League at Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory.\n\nGielnik\u2019s domestic career mirrored that of her national team one. A strong season in orange saw her earn the \u2018super sub\u2019 tag where she helped the Roar make a grand final. Later in 2012, she made her senior national team debut against Japan at the age of 20.\n\nBut after breaking into the national team, she spent some time away from the W-League and the Matildas.\n\nShe explored passions outside football and opened a gym, working on her own fitness and helping others. Fitness is still something that interests her as she is currently undertaking a Bachelor of Exercise Science alongside club and country teammate Clare Polkinghorne.\n\nGielnik worked hard to get back onto the national team radar. While she didn\u2019t make the squad for the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in Canada, she was a part of the team which qualified for the Rio Olympics the following year.\n\n\n\nThe forward scored her first national team goal in that tournament in a 9-0 win over Vietnam.\n\nHowever, with plenty of talent and a small squad, Gielnik didn\u2019t make the final cut. Instead, she travelled as an alternate player.\n\nAt the time, Gielnik said her omission left her genuinely heartbroken and described it as the biggest emotional toll football had ever taken on her.\n\nFollowing on from being so close to selection, Gielnik moved to Norway before linking back up with Jeff Hopkins, this time at Melbourne Victory in the W-League.\n\nA \u2018feel good, play well\u2019 kind of player, Gielnik returned to the national team fold and began to cement herself in the team, adding more goals to her tally.\n\nShe was selected to go to Jordan in 2018 for the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup and to France in 2019 where she played in three of Australia\u2019s four matches.\n\nA move to German giants Bayern Munich saw her learn plenty about herself but she returned to Scandinavia and the W-League once again.\n\n\n\nA scintillating 2020-21 season with Brisbane Roar saw Gielnik take home the golden boot before she signed for Vittsj\u00f6 in Sweden. With 10 goals in 42 games for her country, the determined and dedicated Gielnik is inching ever close to half a century of caps.\n\nA strong presence with the ability to play on the wing and more centrally, Gielnik is an invaluable asset to the Matildas in Tokyo."}, {"url": "https://beyond90.com.au/part-ii-the-making-of-emily-gielnik/", "page_content": "Emily Gielnik\u2019s road to the national team from a 14 year old in the stands to a 20 year old Matildas debutante was the prologue.\n\nThe main feature would begin once she reached her dream. It also meant that reality would hit quickly and often as she moved in and out of the national team program.\n\n\u201cMy first couple of years in the Matildas, I had some big ups and some really big downs,\u201d she shared.\n\n\u201cI was just very inconsistent. I lost that sense of self-belief and I questioned whether or not I belonged in the team anymore.\u201d\n\nLike many women\u2019s footballers in the Australian system, Gielnik was juggling working and football. Unlike many others, Gielnik had decided go out on her own by creating a small fitness business, Shred Em fitness.\n\nStarted in her garage, it quickly grew to become a thriving business that kept the young entrepreneur occupied.\n\nHowever, the success off the field began to impact Gielnik\u2019s success on it.\n\n\u201cAt one stage, Staj (Alen Stajcic) left me out of a tournament against China, which was actually the best thing for me. He had every right to do that because I didn\u2019t believe I was worthy of being there,\u201d she remembered.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t training or performing the way I should\u2019ve been and representing your country is a performance-based privilege.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt served as a good chance for me to consider if and how I could come back from that. I was in and out of the squad for a couple of years and was juggling my personal training business, Shred Em, and was just not choosing football, so I had to make a tough decision.\u201d\n\nGielnik made the call and put her business aspirations on hold to fully commit to football.\n\n\u201cIf you want to be at the top level you need to make those changes and really live at the top level, there is no 50/50 you are either all in or all out,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo in the end I gave up Shred Em, which I loved, but once I fully committed and just indulged myself into living and breathing the game, that\u2019s when everything changed.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BreDwIXB7bS/\n\nRe-finding focus\n\nDespite her re-commitment to the football, Gielnik found her form just a little too late ahead of the 2015 World Cup.\n\nWhile there were big changes occurring for the 24 year old off the pitch, there were more subtle but no less career altering changes occurring on the pitch.\n\nAt six feet, Emily Gielnik cuts a commanding figure on the football pitch. As a striker, there is the inclination to play her in the traditional centre forward role to utilise her height and strength.\n\nThat number 9 role was basis of her early success and selection in the Matildas. The problem with pigeon holing the forward into that traditional mindset is that it didn\u2019t utilise all of Gielnik\u2019s attributes.\n\nAs well as her height, Gielnik has always possessed deceptive pace. Running Shred Em Fitness and practicing what she was preaching saw her increase her aerobic capacity and become a more honed athlete. Along with her fitness work, she was also refining her football skills and touch and developing her final ball.\n\nSpeed, stamina, dribbling, crossing and goal scoring; Emily Gielnik was no longer a centre forward, she was a now built to be a winger. And out wide she went.\n\nA familiar theme\n\nBy the time 2016 Rio Olympic Games qualification came around in February 2016, the 24-year-old was back to feeling like she belonged.\n\n\u201cI really got back into it after the World Cup, I was playing good football. I was happy and Alen brought me back into the squad.\u201d\n\nThe Matildas had a barnstorming run to qualify for Rio. They finished the qualifiers undefeated, on top of the standings and, for the first time, the number one ranked team in Asia.\n\nRight in the thick of the action was Emily Gielnik, in her new role out wide.\n\n\u201cWe went to the Olympic qualifiers and did really well, it was the first time I\u2019d felt good in a long time. My coach was positive and I was in the best physical condition I\u2019d ever been in.\u201d\n\nWhat followed next was six months of intense preparation for the chance at realising another lifetime dream \u2013 becoming an Olympian.\n\nScoring goals, playing her best football, with her confidence at an all-time high and her body in peak condition, Gielnik wasn\u2019t prepared for what was to come.\n\n\u201cI had that dreaded meeting where I was told I was the first player on standby for the Rio Olympics and had missed out by one spot,\u201d she remembered.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t just a tournament I was missing out on, the Olympics are so special and so prestigious, every kid dreams of being an Olympian one day, so to miss out was completely devastating.\n\n\u201cThat was the biggest emotional toll football has ever taken on me. I was genuinely heartbroken.\u201d\n\nMoving forward, again\n\nAfter all the sporting adversity, the blow of missing out on the Olympic Games could have been the final straw for Gielnik.\n\nWhen asked if she considered throwing in the towel she said, \u201cNot for a second.\u201d In fact, it spurred the Queenslander on once again.\n\n\u201cFrom that point on, I chose to never feel that again. I wanted to be in a position where, \u2018No, you\u2019re not coming,\u2019 wasn\u2019t an option anymore.\u201d\n\nThe tenacious forward carried on with this mindset and into the 2017 Algarve Cup.\n\nThe tournament proved to be another breakthrough moment where she reminded naysayers why she deserved to be in the squad.\n\nScoring three goals during the Matildas campaign, the 2017 Algarve Cup was a tournament where Gielnik used everything in her arsenal to demonstrate why she is an imposing figure for full backs to contend with.\n\nWhile an ankle injury ruled Gielnik out of the 2018 Algarve Cup, by the time the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup around, the winger was ready for her first major senior international tournament.\n\nGielnik played in three of Australia\u2019s matches helping the Matildas qualify for the 2019 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup.\n\nVictorious mentality\n\nThe months following the 2018 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup have been Emily Gielnik\u2019s best yet.\n\nFootball was again the focus when the 26 year old moved her life from Brisbane to Melbourne to play for the Melbourne Victory.\n\nIt also saw a reunion with Jeff Hopkins, her first senior coach at Brisbane Roar. The result was a stellar season with her four goals and two assists helping her new side transform from two-time wooden spoon winners, to 2018/19 W-League Premiers.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that although her athletic abilities are considerable, Emily Gielnik\u2019s path to a Matildas regular is really a story about mindset.\n\nAs every inspirational sports instagram quote will tell you, sport is about mentality.\n\nWhen asked where her upbeat outlook and mental toughness comes from, Gielnik says it was something she needed to learn.\n\n\u201cI was always my harshest critic and put so much pressure and expectation on myself,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI had to learn to take a step back and just enjoy the game without worrying what others think about me or how I should play.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe shift came when I just got back to doing what\u2019s natural and playing my own game.\n\n\u201cWhen I got back to the old me, I realised how happy that made me both within and outside of football,\u201d she said.\n\nEmily Gielnik's brilliant Matildas form 13 November \u26bd\ufe0f. 28 February \u26bd\ufe0f. 3 March \u26bd\ufe0f. Emily Gielnik has three goals in her last three appearances for the Westfield Matildas! Posted by Westfield Matildas on Sunday, 3 March 2019\n\nAnd her mindset extends to beyond just herself, also wanting the best for her team as a whole.\n\n\u201cI think I am just a positive person, towards myself and towards other players. Even if someone plays over me, I genuinely want them to do well, I want that player to feel so good and I want us to win together.\n\n\u201cAs much as I love scoring goals, I love setting others up, so they get the glory.\u201d\n\nThe next time Emily Gielnik pulls on the green and gold jersey, there will be an inscription on the inside that reads \u2018Never Say Die.\u2019 It is fitting for the poster girl for perseverance.\n\nIf Gielnik\u2019s evolution is any indication, her greatest feats are yet to come."}, {"url": "https://footballqueensland.com.au/2019/05/28/emily-gielniks-journey-from-queensland-to-her-first-world-cup/", "page_content": "In football there are stories of disappointment but there are also the ones of triumph and dedication, where players fight tooth and nail to get their chance. Westfield Matildas forward Emily Gielnik is one of those stories.\n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the age of 12 that Gielnik started playing football, after injuries in basketball convinced her parents to encourage her to give a different round ball game a go.\n\nPlaying most of her junior football with Redlands United FC, Gielnik worked under the guidance of current Junior Matildas coach Rae Dower, who was Technical Director at the Cleveland-based club at the time.\n\n\u201cRae coming up was good for my development; she more or less gave me the confidence to be free as a player, take players on and score goals,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what made me become more of a goal scorer so most definitely she had impact when I was younger and obviously as I got older and matured as a player there are a lot of other coaches and people.\u201d\n\nIn her first season of playing, the Melbourne-born attacker made the Queensland squad for the National Championships at Coffs Harbour however, at the age of 15 with teammates and friends making the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) team, Gielnik didn\u2019t receive a letter.\n\nIt was a disappointing moment for the teenager.\n\nHowever, opportunities pop up in the strangest of ways and it was while on a school trip to Canberra when she visited the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), that an unbelievable chance came about.\n\nThe Matildas were training at the AIS with then Head Coach Tom Sermanni when Gielnik\u2019s sports teacher asked him if she could join the training session.\n\n\u201cI must have trained out of my skin even though I was so intimidated because it was all the best players in Australia, and all the really old-school Matildas were there,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTom Sermanni asked me to come back the next day and I played a training match with the Matildas.\u201d\n\nImpressed with Gielnik, Sermanni called Jeff Hopkins who was heading up the women\u2019s football program at QAS and recommended he get her into the program.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of how my journey kicked off,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\nShe played a whole season with the QAS before earning a contract the following year with Brisbane Roar, however an injury would keep her sidelined for the whole 2009 Westfield W-League season.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the following season at 18 that she made her debut.\n\nGielnik had to work incredibly hard to get her Westfield W-League opportunity and even in her first two seasons with the club she wouldn\u2019t see much game time with 15 of her 19 appearances coming from the bench.\n\nHowever, after a successful 2011-12 season with Roar, where she was dubbed the \u2018super sub\u2019 for her ability to score goals as a substitute, Gielnik earnt a call up to the Westfield Matildas.\n\nIt was a tough squad to break into at the time, particularly being a striker, with the likes of Sam Kerr, Lisa De Vanna and Kyah Simon just some of the players who had cemented spots in the national team.\n\nAfter making several appearances, Gielnik spent a couple of years away from the national team but fought her way back into Westfield Matildas fold for the 2016 Olympic qualification campaign.\n\nHowever, there was heartbreak when she just missed out on going to the Rio Olympics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening to be out of the squad but once you are it makes you realise how hungry you are to get back in,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\nAlways one to work hard, she continued to keep pushing and made the decision to leave Roar for Melbourne Victory ahead of the 2018-19 Westfield W-League season to reach new heights as a player.\n\nAll her hard work paid off when Gielnik got the phone call that she was selected in the Westfield Matildas FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup squad for the France tournament this year.\n\nIt was an emotional moment for the 27-year-old, who cried after hearing the news.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t really put a word on it to be honest,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more a sense of relief and satisfaction in a way with the build-up and how everything has come together.\n\n\u201cI know I spoke about it in W-League and how desperate I was to make this one so it was more the relief of what I had done had been recognised and I\u2019ve been rewarded for it.\u201d\n\nGielnik puts her recent selection for the national team down to perseverance and dedication.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just persistence and I think that\u2019s the key for me, the earlier I learnt that it takes more than training with the teams and that it takes dedication then that\u2019s where you\u2019ll be rewarded,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Westfield Matildas are currently in Antalya, Turkey for a 10-day camp as they prepare for their opening game of the

"page_content": "Emily Gielnik had a decision to make.\n\nLess than a year out from the Women\u2019s World Cup, the dynamic winger had two options: stay at W-League powerhouse Brisbane Roar, the club she\u2019d joined as a teenager \u2014 or take on a new challenge.\n\nThe latter option was joining her former Roar manager Jeff Hopkins at Melbourne Victory \u2014 a club trying to return from three years in the finals wilderness.\n\nWith the pain of missing out on the Matildas\u2019 2015 World Cup and 2016 Olympics squads still burning fiercely, Gielnik turned her back on the comfort of home and threw herself headlong into a move interstate.\n\n\u201cWell to be honest, Jeff has asked me (to come to Victory) the last couple of years and it wasn\u2019t until this year I made the move,\u201d Gielnik told foxsports.com.au.\n\n\u201cI think I personally needed a bit of a challenge, a change of environment, just being around a different diverse of players and I just really needed to challenge myself in football.\n\n\u201cSo I really feel like I just needed something new to be honest, I just didn\u2019t want to become stagnant and be at the same place for such a long time.\n\n\u201cBut my loyalty was really, really important to me. If I could\u2019ve, I would\u2019ve stayed at Brisbane for the rest of my life, the rest of my football career.\n\n\u201cBut I really think that looking at the bigger picture in terms of the World Cup, this was a really critical move for me and \u2026 when I made the decision, it wasn\u2019t overnight it was weeks and weeks and it was an emotional one.\n\n\u201cSo it was a really calculated decision and I think so far for me, it\u2019s proven to be a good one.\u201d\n\nEmily Gielnik and Laura Alleway celebrate (Photo by Scott Barbour/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images\n\nSix weeks into the W-League season, Gielnik is reaping the rewards of her bold move.\n\nVictory is sitting pretty, undefeated and outright top of the table, with the winger nominated for the PFA\u2019s recent W-League player of the month award.\n\nIn her five appearances for Victory, Gielnik has scored one goal, assisted one, made 10 key passes, created 11 chances and provided 23 crosses.\n\nShe\u2019s also combined beautifully with captain Natasha Dowie and star playmaker Christine Nairn, with the trio comprising one of the W-League\u2019s most intimidating attacks.\n\n\u201cI think if you look at it in the perspective of a couple of weeks, it feels really good, obviously because of where we are as a team and everything,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cAnd me personally, I\u2019ve already felt a lot of improvement. Most importantly, it\u2019s just in my happiness and my mentality more than anything and I\u2019ve got a really good support network in terms of leaving home as well.\n\n\u201cAnd obviously the staff here is great and obviously Jeff has the best intentions for me, so they\u2019re really going above and beyond to try and cater for everything that I need football-wise. So that was really important to me in the lead up to making that decision to play for Victory.\n\n\u201cBut obviously I already feel a really good shift and a good change for me so far but I think there\u2019s still over half a season to go and much more improvement that I\u2019m longing for, definitely, with the World Cup being obviously in my sights but the team being the priority of course at the moment.\u201d\n\nEmily Gielnik.

So that was a big thing for me.\n\n\u201cPurely because football is not forever and that dream job is something I can always come back to, no matter the age. So I really just want to \u2014 after years and years of sacrifice to football, I thought this was really the ultimate thing to do just to give it everything that I\u2019ve got and enjoy every single challenge and experience because I\u2019m obviously lucky enough to have the opportunity to be a contracted Matilda at the moment.\n\n\u201cSo I weighed up some options and it\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t take it (football) seriously before, it\u2019s just more that I\u2019ve really made it a massive part of my life, which it has been for a long time.\n\n\u201cAnd so I think I\u2019ve been a lot happier and a lot more focused and I\u2019ve really dedicated a lot of my time to it off the field as well now, more from a mental aspect and keeping myself in good condition and in other parts of fitness to make sure that I\u2019m physically good on the park.\u201d\n\nEmily Gielnik.

After stopping basketball due to injuries she took up soccer and was eventually signed by Brisbane Roar for the second season of the W\u2013League.[1] At Brisbane she became recognised as a \"super sub\" for her knack of coming off the substitutes' bench to score late goals.[2] Gielnik played eight seasons at Brisbane, appearing in 83 games and scoring 30 goals. She won the W-League Championship in 2010\u201311 and the Premiership in 2012\u201313 and 2017\u201318.[3]\n\nLiverpool LFC and Ottawa Fury, 2012\u20132013\n\nIn May 2012, Gielnik signed for English club Liverpool L.F.C., during the 2012 FA WSL season.[4] In October 2012, she was one of ten players to be released by Liverpool's new manager Mark Beard.[5] In 2013, Gielnik joined Ottawa Fury for their W-League season.[6]\n\nUrawa Red Diamonds, 2016\n\nAfter the 2016 Olympics, Gielnik joined Japanese club Urawa Red Diamonds.[7]\n\nAvaldsnes IL, 2017\n\nGielnik joined Norwegen team Avaldsnes IL for the 2017 season. She had a breakout season with the team, scoring eight goals in league play. Avaldsnes finished second in the Toppserien and won the Norwegian Cup.[8]\n\nMelbourne Victory, 2018\u20132019\n\nGielnik signed with Melbourne Victory for the 2018\u201319 W-League season.\n\nBayern Munich, 2019\u20132020\n\nOn 23 August 2019, Gielnik joined German Frauen-Bundesliga club Bayern Munich.[9] In July 2020, she left the club after making only 6 appearances, partially due to injury.[10]\n\nVittsj\u00f6, 2020\n\nA week after leaving Bayern Munich, Gielnik signed with another European club, joining Swedish club Vittsj\u00f6.[11]\n\nBrisbane Roar, 2020\u2013\n\nIn November 2020, Gielnik returned Australia, signing with her hometown club, Brisbane Roar.[12]\n\nInternational career\n\nGielnik scored a hat-trick on her international debut for Australia U-19s in October 2011.[1] She made her first appearance for the senior Matildas team in a 3\u20130 friendly defeat to World champions Japan in Tokyo on 11 July 2012.[13]\n\nGielnik was named to the Australian squad for 2016 Olympic Qualifying, she scored a goal against Vietnam.[14] Australia won the tournament and qualified for the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\nGielnik was part of the Matildas squad that won the 2017 Tournament of Nations and defeated the United States for the first time ever.[15]\n\nAt the 2018 AFC Women's Asian Cup Gielnik appeared in three matches for Australia.

But the weight of expectation has been lightened since January\u2019s shock sacking of coach Alen Stajcic amid allegations of a toxic and stagnating environment, and significant question marks linger as to whether Ante Milicic can impress his bold footballing philosophy upon the squad with just a handful of games to prepare for France.\n\nConversely, this makes the Matildas a genuine dark horse for the tournament. Galvanised by a frustrating past year or two, and ambitious to explore the uncharted \u2013 with a determined, likeable, close-knit squad of players \u2013 they could pull it off in style. Tactically, the system employed in April\u2019s entertaining friendly defeat against the US was already a bold evolution from that seen during the recent Cup of Nations tournament. Australia surprised the world\u2019s best team on home soil with an aggressive 4-2-4 (or lopsided 3-3-4) system that pressed the full-backs high, and played swiftly and vertically in transition, forcing the US into uncharacteristic mistakes. Though, as a 5-3 scoreline indicates, at times this left the Matildas vulnerable at the back, with a high line exposing their key defensive stalwarts for pace.\n\nMilicic is very clear in his philosophy \u2013 he wants the Matildas to dominate possession, to play with attacking intent and courage and let the opposition adapt to their game. This is tempered with pragmatism \u2013 against the US the collective system was adapted to best support the attributes of key individuals, surrounding spearhead Sam Kerr with the energetic Caitlin Foord, with width provided by attacking wingers Lisa De Vanna, Emily Gielnik or Hayley Raso. In midfield, the accomplished ball players Elise Kellond-Knight and Emily van Egmond are tasked with building the play from deep, while rising star Ellie Carpenter is given licence to attack from right-back.\n\nWith 12 players boasting 50 or more caps the squad is an excellent blend of youth and experience. Australians make up the largest foreign cohort of NWSL starters, with the complementary calendars of the domestic W-League and the elite US competition meaning year-round football for the nation\u2019s best players. Whether the Matildas are the finished article in time for this World Cup remains to be seen, but Milicic is emphatic his side will play \u201cthe Australian way\u201d \u2013 with energy, with courage and with self-belief.\n\nCoach\n\nMilicic is a highly regarded coach domestically, who served as the men\u2019s national team assistant under Ange Postecoglou, a side that won international acclaim for its attacking showing at the 2014 men\u2019s World Cup and silverware in the form of Australia\u2019s first men\u2019s Asian Cup trophy in 2015. Hard-working, meticulous and forensic in his preparation, Milicic is a taskmaster, but personable enough to extract the very best from this talented playing group.\n\nStar player\n\nWhat more is there to write about Sam Kerr? One of the undisputed stars of the women\u2019s game, Kerr is the all-time leading goalscorer in both the NWSL and the W-League, and arrives in France coming off four consecutive domestic Golden Boot awards \u2013 and all this at just 25 years old. Overlooked for Fifa\u2019s major individual honours \u2013 due perhaps to previous criticism of the governing body \u2013 but a star-turn in France and a move to one of Europe\u2019s top clubs post-World Cup could change that.\n\nSam Kerr is the all-time leading goalscorer in both the NWSL in the US and Australia\u2019s W-League. Photograph: Justin Edmonds/Getty Images\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe veteran Lisa De Vanna could join an elite club by scoring at a fourth World Cup \u2013 something that seemed unlikely when the mercurial but tempestuous star was described by a former coach ahead of her first World Cup as \u201chigh maintenance\u201d, \u201ca brat\u201d and possessing mood swings \u201clike the stock market crash of 1987\u201d.\n\nDescribed by historians Roy Hay and Bill Murray as being held back by \u201cantagonistic relations at the institutional level\u201d women\u2019s football in Australia endured almost a century of chauvinistic dismissal from the 1880s onwards, with a 1921 committee examining outdoor games for girls finding football \u201cunsuitable\u201d, given that \u201cmuch physical exercise might increase the difficulties of parturition\u201d, aka childbirth. Buoyed by second-wave feminism and championed by pioneering figures such as Elaine Watson and Heather Reid the women\u2019s game planted its first roots in semi-professionalism in the 1970s. A first national championship took place in 1974, with the foundation of the Australian Women\u2019s Soccer Association \u2013 a body that the then governing body refused to ratify \u2013 leading to a first national team tour in 1978.\n\nNevertheless due to financial limitations, it wasn\u2019t until 1984 that the Matildas first played a game outside Oceania and 1994 outside Asia, with Australia failing to qualify for the inaugural Women\u2019s World Cup on goal-difference to New Zealand. Since then, the Matildas have been ever-present at World Cups, but didn\u2019t record a win (4-1 v Ghana) until 2007 where they emerged from the group stage for the first time.\n\nWhich player is going to surprise everyone at the World Cup?\n\nEllie Carpenter. Already a veteran of six domestic seasons in Australia and the United States and with an Olympics campaign under her belt, the still teenage Carpenter has already blossomed into a key component of this Matildas squad. Tenacious, hard-working, with pace and an engine that goes all day, Carpenter will be crucial both in attack and defence, from a position that has been an achilles heel for Australia in recent campaigns.\n\nEllie Carpenter is only 19 but is already a key member of the Matildas squad. Photograph: Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images\n\nWhat is the realistic aim for France and why?\n\nSemi-finals. The upheaval following the dismissal of Stajcic has cooled dreams of the trophy, as has a mixed year of performances following Australia\u2019s defeat of the US in Seattle in 2017. This is unquestionably the Matildas\u2019 strongest ever squad, and if Kerr fires, a fairytale charge to the final could be on the cards. Australia have fallen at the quarter-finals at the past three World Cups \u2013 they would desperately love to go at least one better in France.\n\nAnnual budget\n\nBelieved to be $2m-4m. Football Federation Australia spent $11.3m on national teams in 2018, but with that being a men\u2019s World Cup year, it\u2019s likely the lion\u2019s share went to the men\u2019s game.\n\nRegistered players\n\nFFA reports there are 140,000 female players \u201cparticipating in regular structured football\u201d, but a recent AusPlay survey cites 250,000 female participants in what is, despite the investment from Aussie rules football, netball and cricket, still the nation\u2019s largest grassroots participation sport.\n\nRichard Parkin writes for the Guardian Australia.

Born in Melbourne, Gielnik grew up in Queensland playing a different kind of round ball sport: basketball. Injuries saw her eventually pick up football at age 12.\n\nShe played her junior football at Redlands United. Current Junior Matildas coach and Football Australia Women\u2019s Technical Advisor Rae Dower was the Technical Director at the club when Gielnik was there.\n\nDespite making the Queensland squad for the National Championships, Gielnik didn\u2019t make it into the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) team.\n\nShe would end up in the QAS team eventually, thanks to a school trip to Canberra where she took part in a Matildas training session at the AIS under then-coach Tom Sermanni.\n\n\n\nSermanni suggested Gielnik to the QAS coach at the time, Jeff Hopkins, who would go on to work with Gielnik in the W-League at Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory.\n\nGielnik\u2019s domestic career mirrored that of her national team one. A strong season in orange saw her earn the \u2018super sub\u2019 tag where she helped the Roar make a grand final. Later in 2012, she made her senior national team debut against Japan at the age of 20.\n\nBut after breaking into the national team, she spent some time away from the W-League and the Matildas.\n\nShe explored passions outside football and opened a gym, working on her own fitness and helping others. Fitness is still something that interests her as she is currently undertaking a Bachelor of Exercise Science alongside club and country teammate Clare Polkinghorne.\n\nGielnik worked hard to get back onto the national team radar. While she didn\u2019t make the squad for the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in Canada, she was a part of the team which qualified for the Rio Olympics the following year.\n\n\n\nThe forward scored her first national team goal in that tournament in a 9-0 win over Vietnam.\n\nHowever, with plenty of talent and a small squad, Gielnik didn\u2019t make the final cut. Instead, she travelled as an alternate player.\n\nAt the time, Gielnik said her omission left her genuinely heartbroken and described it as the biggest emotional toll football had ever taken on her.\n\nFollowing on from being so close to selection, Gielnik moved to Norway before linking back up with Jeff Hopkins, this time at Melbourne Victory in the W-League.\n\nA \u2018feel good, play well\u2019 kind of player, Gielnik returned to the national team fold and began to cement herself in the team, adding more goals to her tally.\n\nShe was selected to go to Jordan in 2018 for the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup and to France in 2019 where she played in three of Australia\u2019s four matches.\n\nA move to German giants Bayern Munich saw her learn plenty about herself but she returned to Scandinavia and the W-League once again.\n\n\n\nA scintillating 2020-21 season with Brisbane Roar saw Gielnik take home the golden boot before she signed for Vittsj\u00f6 in Sweden. With 10 goals in 42 games for her country, the determined and dedicated Gielnik is inching ever close to half a century of caps.\n\nA strong presence with the ability to play on the wing and more centrally, Gielnik is an invaluable asset to the Matildas in Tokyo."}, {"url": "https://www.foxsports.com.au/football/matildas/australias-emily-gielnik-reflects-on-her-surreal-world-cup-debut/news-story/ee648b160f0e082ad6b73fac59d3be93", "page_content": "Making your World Cup debut is special enough.\n\nFew get to achieve that milestone in a game as memorable as this.\n\nAustralia\u2019s 2019 World Cup win over Brazil was genuinely one for the ages, with the Matildas completing a remarkable comeback from 2-0 down to win 3-2.\n\nBut for Emily Gielnik, it was special for another reason: it was the winger\u2019s debut in a major tournament.\n\n\u201cHonestly I can\u2019t even put it into words how we\u2019re all feeling,\u201d Gielnik said post-match.\n\n\u201cI just feel so bloody good and just like, it was such a do-or-die game and we won our way and I just \u2014 I\u2019m just speechless, feeling on top of the world right now.\u201d\n\nGielnik missed out on Australia\u2019s 2015 World Cup squad, then was again overlooked for the 2016 Olympics.\n\nHaving sat on the bench for the opening loss to Italy, the Melbourne Victory winger was called upon by Ante Milicic to start against Brazil.\n\n\u201cIt is surreal.

So it was a hard one to watch as that one went in since it all started with my nutmeg.\n\n\u201cSo look, it\u2019s a tough one, I\u2019ll learn from it and I just hope to not make those little mistakes again.\u201d\n\nAs the game went on, Gielnik got more involved, creating a good chance for Sam Kerr shortly before Caitlin Foord\u2019s opening goal, then playing a role in the build-up to Chloe Logarzo\u2019s equaliser.\n\n\u201cYeah definitely (I got more involved). Look, I don\u2019t want to say I have any regrets, I do think I could have done things a little bit better with a little bit better intention,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd I think I could have been a little bit more aggressive going forward and I guess I was a little bit hesitant in a sense of not getting done in behind.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s kind of one of those 50-50s, risk and reward so I\u2019ll learn from it and at the end of the day, I\u2019m just glad that we won, so that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\n\nChloe Logarzo, Caitlin Foord and Emily Gielnik (Photo by Pascal GUYOT / AFP) Source: AFP\n\nWhen Gielnik made way for Raso in the 71st minute, with Australia\u2019s 3-2 comeback complete, she and Milicic shared a big embrace, with the winger relishing in her coach\u2019s show of faith.\n\n\u201cHe was terrific,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not often that people get an opportunity to play in the World Cup and just said he hoped I enjoyed my debut and my minutes at my very first World Cup.\n\n\u201cAnd you know, it was a nice moment and I really appreciate that and I\u2019m grateful for it because at the end of the day, he decides who gets the minutes and I definitely didn\u2019t have to start, nor do I have to come on.\n\n\u201cSo hopefully I\u2019m proving myself to him and hopefully I did my bit for the team and I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity that he gave me.\u201d\n\nAnd if the moment was special on an individual level for Gielnik, she was also more than aware of the significance of the win for the team as a whole.\n\n\u201cIt lifts our confidence obviously. No-one loves to lose their first game and I think it put a lot of pressure (on us) but another cliche saying of the Matildas: \u2018never say die\u2019 \u2014 we knew this game was do or die for us,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cSo we really took on that pressure and we executed well and I think we were gonna fight to the end for this win, no matter what it took.\n\n\u201cI know that we had the players and the depth to do that and we finished it \u2014 whether it was ugly or pretty, the three points was crucial for us. But not winning that first game was hard, but losing this game would have been harder, so that was just a no for us basically.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://footballqueensland.com.au/2019/05/28/emily-gielniks-journey-from-queensland-to-her-first-world-cup/", "page_content": "In football there are stories of disappointment but there are also the ones of triumph and dedication, where players fight tooth and nail to get their chance. Westfield Matildas forward Emily Gielnik is one of those stories.\n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the age of 12 that Gielnik started playing football, after injuries in basketball convinced her parents to encourage her to give a different round ball game a go.\n\nPlaying most of her junior football with Redlands United FC, Gielnik worked under the guidance of current Junior Matildas coach Rae Dower, who was Technical Director at the Cleveland-based club at the time.\n\n\u201cRae coming up was good for my development; she more or less gave me the confidence to be free as a player, take players on and score goals,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what made me become more of a goal scorer so most definitely she had impact when I was younger and obviously as I got older and matured as a player there are a lot of other coaches and people.\u201d\n\nIn her first season of playing, the Melbourne-born attacker made the Queensland squad for the National Championships at Coffs Harbour however, at the age of 15 with teammates and friends making the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) team, Gielnik didn\u2019t receive a letter.\n\nIt was a disappointing moment for the teenager.\n\nHowever, opportunities pop up in the strangest of ways and it was while on a school trip to Canberra when she visited the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), that an unbelievable chance came about.\n\nThe Matildas were training at the AIS with then Head Coach Tom Sermanni when Gielnik\u2019s sports teacher asked him if she could join the training session.\n\n\u201cI must have trained out of my skin even though I was so intimidated because it was all the best players in Australia, and all the really old-school Matildas were there,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTom Sermanni asked me to come back the next day and I played a training match with the Matildas.\u201d\n\nImpressed with Gielnik, Sermanni called Jeff Hopkins who was heading up the women\u2019s football program at QAS and recommended he get her into the program.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of how my journey kicked off,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\nShe played a whole season with the QAS before earning a contract the following year with Brisbane Roar, however an injury would keep her sidelined for the whole 2009 Westfield W-League season.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the following season at 18 that she made her debut.\n\nGielnik had to work incredibly hard to get her Westfield W-League opportunity and even in her first two seasons with the club she wouldn\u2019t see much game time with 15 of her 19 appearances coming from the bench.\n\nHowever, after a successful 2011-12 season with Roar, where she was dubbed the \u2018super sub\u2019 for her ability to score goals as a substitute, Gielnik earnt a call up to the Westfield Matildas.\n\nIt was a tough squad to break into at the time, particularly being a striker, with the likes of Sam Kerr, Lisa De Vanna and Kyah Simon just some of the players who had cemented spots in the national team.\n\nAfter making several appearances, Gielnik spent a couple of years away from the national team but fought her way back into Westfield Matildas fold for the 2016 Olympic qualification campaign.\n\nHowever, there was heartbreak when she just missed out on going to the Rio Olympics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening to be out of the squad but once you are it makes you realise how hungry you are to get back in,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\nAlways one to work hard, she continued to keep pushing and made the decision to leave Roar for Melbourne Victory ahead of the 2018-19 Westfield W-League season to reach new heights as a player.\n\nAll her hard work paid off when Gielnik got the phone call that she was selected in the Westfield Matildas FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup squad for the France tournament this year.\n\nIt was an emotional moment for the 27-year-old, who cried after hearing the news.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t really put a word on it to be honest,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more a sense of relief and satisfaction in a way with the build-up and how everything has come together.\n\n\u201cI know I spoke about it in W-League and how desperate I was to make this one so it was more the relief of what I had done had been recognised and I\u2019ve been rewarded for it.\u201d\n\nGielnik puts her recent selection for the national team down to perseverance and dedication.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just persistence and I think that\u2019s the key for me, the earlier I learnt that it takes more than training with the teams and that it takes dedication then that\u2019s where you\u2019ll be rewarded,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Westfield Matildas are currently in Antalya, Turkey for a 10-day camp as they prepare for their opening game of the World Cup on June 9 against Italy.\n\nImage: Matt King/Getty Images"}, {"url": "https://olympics.com/en/news/the-tale-of-two-matildas", "page_content": "It\u2019s the heart-breaking phone call that no athlete wants to receive. With only 18-players able to be selected on an Olympic Football squad, Emily Gielnik missed out on making the Australian women\u2019s football team for the Rio 2016 Games by one spot. \u201c[It] was heart wrenching and disappointing, to say the least, I felt entirely defeated at that point, I felt like I had done what I could do, and I wasn't going,\u201d the Matildas forward, who had also missed out on the 2015 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup squad a year prior, told Tokyo 2020 in April. \u201cA very difficult time in my career to understand but moving past that was just as important for me so that's what I focussed on.\u201d The Brisbane-born footballer knew she wanted to be an Olympian as soon as she pulled on the green and gold jersey \u2013 making her senior national debut against Japan, Tokyo in 2012. \u201cI remember that feeling of actually watching the girls at the Olympics from my couch with my family and just how passionate and excited I was to be supporting them,\u201d Gielnik said. \u201cI knew that's what I wanted. I wanted to be on the on the other end of that, being a part of that. So that was more so when it really sunk in that I wanted that more than anything.\u201d Now the 28-year-old is squarely within the mix for Tokyo 2020 selection after scoring a double against Rio 2016 gold medallist Germany in Australia\u2019s 5-2 friendly loss last month.\n\nHowever, Gielnik wasn\u2019t the only Matilda to miss out five years ago with Aivi Luik also named as an alternate for Rio 2016. The 36-year-old told Tokyo 2020 it would be a dream come true to represent Australia at Tokyo 2020. \u201cTo be able to go there and compete with the best in a tournament that has such history, I think it would be amazing, it would be a once in a lifetime kind of experience. And it was something that I always wanted as a kid.\u201d\n\nThe ability to preserve Getting knocked down, facing challenges, and overcoming barriers is something both Gielnik and Luik know all too well. For Gielnik, after missing out on Rio 2016, she didn\u2019t let her determination die, she continued to work hard and made the decision to leave her long-time club Brisbane Roar for Melbourne Victory ahead of the 2018-19 W-League season. It was a move that would pay dividends as she made Australia\u2019s squad for the 2019 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in France. \u201cWhat I would put it down to, honestly, is just how I've approached every football season from then onwards leaving no stone unturned, just knowing my own body, knowing what it takes to stay at that top level and what's required of me in working alongside the clubs but also working on my own in terms of individual performance away from the football clubs,\u201d she said of her desire to continue being her best.\" \u201cThat's really what's got to me, is just honing in on that that focus and those extra things that have that kept me in the top level and keep giving me the opportunity to come back into the Matildas squad.\u201d Luik, who also got her start in the W-League with Brisbane Roar, had to wait a tad longer before making her World Cup debut despite making her international debut in 2010 and was part of Australia\u2019s victorious AFC Asian Cup team that year. But throughout her career she was plagued with injuries including bilateral hamstring tendinopathy. Despite missing out on selection for both the 2011 and 2015 World Cups then Rio 2016 Olympics, the midfielder continued playing because it had been her dream to go to a World Cup. \u201cAfter that second let down, I didn't really think it was going to be in the cards for me, but I continued to play,\u201d she said.\n\nAivi Luik (2018 Getty Images)\n\nIt was in 2018, seven years after her last appearance in the green and gold, that Luik took to the pitch as a Matilda once again during their 5-0 friendly win against Thailand and after a successful season with Spanish club Levante in 2019, she was on the radar of then Matildas coach Ante Milicic for the upcoming World Cup in France. Named in the 23-player World Cup squad, it wouldn\u2019t be until Australia\u2019s final group game that the Perth-born player would take to the field. \u201cI thought maybe I was going on and it didn't happen so I [was] starting to wonder if maybe it wouldn't happen but I did get that debut and it felt amazing,\u201d she said. Australia beat Jamaica 4-1 in that match. \u201cIt was really emotional afterwards, especially to see my brother and sister in the crowd. Having them witness my dream since I was a kid was amazing. It's very hard to put into words, but it's definitely one of the highlights of my life.\u201d\n\nTogether again after 400 days Assembling at Soest, the headquarters of the Dutch Football Federation, it was the first time since Australia had secured qualification for Tokyo 2020 in March last year during their 5-0 and 2-1 wins over Vietnam, that they were together again. And for many, it was the first time they had seen their national teammates \u2013 many have spent the last decade playing together in the green and gold \u2013 in over a year so there was excitement. \u201cIt was so good to see everyone again in camp, obviously, their familiar faces, but it's like you never left. It feels like we had we just saw them not long ago. So really exciting, really good vibes. We are one big family, and it was just so good to see everyone again,\u201d Gielnik said ahead of the team\u2019s first match in 400 days. With Australian-based players unable to be selected, it was up to the Matildas playing abroad to put their best foot forward in front of Tony Gustavsson, who was appointed head coach in September last year. The former United States assistant coach took the reins of Australia\u2019s most loved national team in the New Year but due to the global pandemic hadn\u2019t been able to meet players in person. With the playing group meeting Gustavsson for the first time, there were positive vibes around camp. \u201cTony has showed us the way that he believes we can play in order to get us to the next level,\u201d Luik said of the Swedish-born coach. \u201cThat's what we all want at the end of the day and through his words, through his intensity and the belief in us, I think that's really flowed through his meetings and how he runs training sessions.\u201d \u201cVery good energy, good vibe and most importantly, extremely encouraging just coming in. So that really works well for me,\u201d Gielnik said. \u201cI think me as a player, I really respond better with someone who really believes in me and has that positive energy to want you to get on the ball. So I'm really looking forward to what he's got in store for all of us.\u201d\n\nWelcoming the pressure From fighting for equality, recognition, and the right to play the game they love, the Matildas of today have become one of the most recognisable sport teams in Australia \u2013 and in women\u2019s football. Following their Rio 2016 quarter-finals loss in a penalty shootout, it was at the 2017 Tournament of Nations that Australia reached new heights as they beat Japan (4-2), the United States (1-0) and Brazil (6-1) to win their first piece of silverware since the 2010 AFC Asian Cup success. Going on to win their next four matches on home soil, the following year still saw solid performances including a fourth-placed finish at the 2018 Algarve Cup and runners-up performance at the 2018 AFC Asian Cup. The 2019 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup left more to be desired, as they bowed out in the quarter-finals to Norway, but their qualification for Tokyo 2020 once again brought excitement. While recent 5-2 and 5-0 losses to Germany and the Netherlands brought harsh critics from Australian media \u2013 just three months out from Tokyo 2020. But the pressure to produce results is something the side welcome. \u201cI think it's something that we enjoy and welcome with open arms, because if you're a team that is not doing well, there's no pressure on you so because we've risen through the rankings and we've got a name for ourselves, now there is that pressure but it's great,\u201d Luik said. \u201cIt means people are following us. People want us to do well, and people expect us to do well. And I think that can actually help with results in the times when the pressure can get a little much, we've got a really good playing group and we can look for support, and also from our family and friends and our fans or some of the best in the world. And I don't say that lightly. \u201cI think they care genuinely about our journeys and they care about our ups and downs and they really want to see us succeed.\""}, {"url": "https://www.olympics.com.au/olympians/emily-gielnik/", "page_content": "Fast Facts\n\nSport: Football\n\nEvent: Women's\n\nOlympic History: Tokyo 2020\n\nCoach: Tony Gustavsson\n\nYear Born: 1992\n\nState Born: Victoria\n\nAbout Emily\n\nEmily Gielnik had an Australian U19s debut for the ages, scoring a hat-trick on debut in October 2011.\n\nLess than 12 months later she received her first selection to the Matildas, appearing in a 3-0 defeat against Japan in July 2012 friendly.\n\nEmily was named in the Matildas Olympic qualifying squad for Rio 2016 and scored a goal against Vietnam, however wasn\u2019t named in the final team for the Olympics.\n\nShe appeared in all three matches for Australia at the 2018 Asian Cup.
