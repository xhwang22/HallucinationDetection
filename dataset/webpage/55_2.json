{"The Ridzik Foundation is a philanthropic organization.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/philanthropic-foundation", "page_content": "philanthropic foundation, a nongovernmental, nonprofit organization, with assets provided by donors and managed by its own officials and with income expended for socially useful purposes. Foundation, endowment, and charitable trust are other terms used interchangeably to designate these organizations, which can be traced far back in history. They existed in the ancient civilizations of the Middle East, Greece, and Rome. Plato\u2019s Academy (c. 387 bce), for example, was established with an endowment that helped to sustain its existence for some 900 years. The medieval Christian church set up and administered trusts for benevolent purposes. The Islamic world developed an equivalent of the foundation, the waqf, as early as the 7th century ce. Western European merchants in the 17th and 18th centuries founded similar organizations for worthy causes.\n\nThose early philanthropic forms were usually small and for local and palliative purposes. Although there are still many small foundations, the late 19th and the 20th centuries witnessed the creation of distinctive large ones that usually originated in the fortunes of wealthy industrialists. Having broad purposes and great freedom of action, including the ability by many to conduct programs worldwide, such foundations are variously categorized as: community, which have support from many donors and are located in a specific community or region; corporation-sponsored, which have increased dramatically in number, size, scope, and importance since World War II; operating, which carry out projects with their own staff; and independent, which are established by wealthy individuals and families. Most of the larger and best-known foundations in the United States and other countries have been of the last type.\n\nJames Smithson and George Peabody provided funds for the establishment in the United States of the Smithsonian Institution (1846) and the Peabody Education Fund (1867), respectively. At the turn of the century, Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller inaugurated the first of their many philanthropies. Carnegie\u2019s giving exceeded $350 million, with much of it used for the establishment of such foundations as the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (1905) and the Carnegie Corporation of New York (1911). Rockefeller established the General Education Board (1902) and the Rockefeller Foundation (1913).\n\nOther American foundations of considerable size and impact were the Russell Sage Foundation (1907), the Commonwealth Fund (1918), the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (1925), the Ford Foundation (1936), the W.K. Kellogg Foundation (1930), the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (1936), the Lilly Endowment, Inc. (1937), the Pew Memorial Trust (1948), the J. Paul Getty Trust (1953), the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation (1966), the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation (1969), the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation (1970), and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation (2000). The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, established in 2000, was the largest philanthropic foundation in the world in the early 21st century.\n\nOutside the United States some of the wealthiest foundations include the Wellcome Trust (1936), in the United Kingdom; the Robert Bosch Foundation (1964), Germany; the Li Ka Shing Foundation (1980), Hong Kong; Stichting INGKA Foundation (1982), Netherlands; the MasterCard Foundation (2006), Canada; and the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Foundation (2007), United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe large modern foundations have expended most of their funds for activities in the fields of education, social welfare, science, health, religion, conservation, international relations, and public policy. Whereas some foundations have been reluctant to publicize their activities, others, especially the larger ones, provide regular reports on their operations."}, {"url": "https://health-policy-systems.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12961-015-0074-z", "page_content": "In this article, we have identified the 10 largest funding organizations of health research globally and shed more light on their funding distribution mechanisms and funding patterns. Two main conclusions can be drawn from this mapping of influential funders of health research.\n\nDifferences between funding organizations: the need for more evaluation of funding distribution models\n\nFirst, there is considerable diversity between funding organizations in terms of what they fund and how they distribute those funds. This begs the question: do some funding distribution models have more impact than others? The impact of different approaches to funding health research is regularly discussed in the literature, for example, for intramural versus extramural funding [23], for targeted versus untargeted funding [37], for \u2018people grants\u2019 versus project grants [36, 38], for small grants versus large grants [10], and for competitive versus non-competitive research funding [39]. However, comparative evaluations of the impact of various funding models are scarce [10, 23, 38], even though approaches to measure the impact of health research are available [40]. An exception has been the recent comparisons of \u2018people grants\u2019 versus projects grants in the United States, which compared HHMI with NIH researchers and NIH Pioneer Awards with NIH project grants [36, 41\u201343]. These comparisons have led the NIH to consider a broad shift toward \u2018people grants\u2019, demonstrating the value and potential impact of such evaluations [36]. Evaluations of this kind provide new insights when comparing funding models across funding organizations, but given the different contexts in which funders operate, comparing the impact of different models within one funding organization is perhaps particularly valuable and should become more common practice.\n\nThere is also a need for more debate about where the power to decide priorities for publicly funded health research should lie (with parliaments, ministries, funding agencies, or independent committees of experts). Such debate is needed because there are finite resources for investing in health research and thus priorities need to be set using fair and legitimate methods and using the best possible evidence [44]. In practice, public sector health research funding decisions are not only made on the basis of what research is needed, but are regularly influenced by other factors, such as political interests, advocacy and lobbying [2]. Thus, there is a need for transparency on who makes those decisions and to debate who should make them [2, 13, 45\u201347]. Analysis of funding organizations\u2019 priority setting processes was not part of this study (see Limitations) but deserves to be a more frequent subject of research studies in the future.\n\nImproving publicly available data on health research funding\n\nSecond, to enable evaluation and debates as noted above, it is necessary to have a map of the health research funding landscape: to know who the main funders of health research are, what they fund, and how they decide what gets funded [2, 6\u201311, 13]. Yet, this study shows that these data are often not available. Through our study, we did not find a list of all public or philanthropic health research funders worldwide that included their annual health research expenditures (Additional file 1). Therefore, we have now established such a list ourselves at www.healthresearchfunders.org. On this website, we provide access to the data collected for this article and to information on more than 200 other public and philanthropic funders of health research that we have added to this website since the mapping for this article was completed.\n\nBesides the absence of a global listing of funding organizations, we found that data on organizations\u2019 funding patterns and funding distribution mechanisms are often not available, and when they are, they are difficult to aggregate, owing to differences in funders\u2019 data classification systems. Notably, we only collected these data for the 10 largest funding organizations of health research. The absence of such information, and the difficulties in aggregating the data across funders, are likely to be more prominent when smaller funders are also included. There is currently no consensus on a framework for producing descriptive data on funders\u2019 funding patterns (both in terms of health areas and research types) nor on a framework for describing their funding distribution mechanisms [6, 8, 37]. In this article, we have proposed three frameworks for reporting data on health research funding: for reporting data on funding distribution mechanisms (Table 4), for reporting data on funding patterns in terms of health problems (the Global Burden of Disease classification [34]), and for reporting data on funding patterns in terms of research types (biomedical research, clinical research, epidemiological research or health systems research, as proposed by Frenk [35]). The adoption of standards for reporting funding data, including guidance on what data classification systems to use, by funding organizations, for example through collaborative initiatives such as the Heads of International Research Organizations, would substantially improve the quality and comparability of reported funding data [9].\n\nFunding organizations are starting to support the goal of transparency and are increasingly recognizing the problems noted above and addressing them. At the 2014 World Health Summit in Berlin, several major funders of health research expressed interest to work together toward developing a common approach for mapping health research funding flows [12]. Another good example of a multi-funder collaboration to increase insight in health research investments is the World RePORT website [48]. On a national level, the United Kingdom has led the way in terms of harmonized reporting by showing it is feasible to collect comparable data on health research funding from all major public funding bodies and charities in a country [22]. Besides initiatives from funders themselves, there are also several promising initiatives from other parties to address the lack of data on global health research funding [1, 16, 49\u201351]. The recent decision to establish a Global Observatory on Health R&D at WHO in particular may help to improve transparency in this area [1].\n\nLimitations\n\nFinally, we note that the mapping conducted for this article has had several limitations. First, we have excluded funding organizations in the private for-profit sector (these are listed elsewhere [30]). Second, national systems for funding health research vary. In many countries, a large amount of health funding is dispersed directly from governments to universities or research institutes via block grants. We excluded these block grants and therefore the public funding organizations that we report on do not all contribute the same share of all health research that is publicly funded in a country. Third, we had to make several generalizations in order to be able to report data across funders that were diverse in their funding distribution mechanisms and reporting systems. For instance, what we have termed \u2018targeted\u2019 research funding, is a grey area that ranges from broad prioritized research areas to specific research topics or questions [52]. Also, funders reported on their expenditures on health research in various formats. Although we have kept track of these varying reporting formats, they decrease comparability across funders. Fourth, we would have liked to exclude overhead costs within project funding (not operational costs of the funder, which we did exclude where possible, but overhead costs of the research organization), to measure only the amount of funding that went to research, but this was not feasible because it was mostly not reported. Fifth, our proposed framework for reporting on funders\u2019 funding distribution mechanisms (Table 4) lacks detail. It would have been interesting to also report on more detailed mechanisms, such as funders\u2019 grants for businesses and PDPs/PPPs, but we did not include such analyses because of a lack of comparable data across funders. Sixth, funding organizations frequently make adaptations to their funding strategies, and therefore our findings should be viewed as a snapshot of funders\u2019 expenditures, funding distribution mechanisms and funding patterns during the time of our data collection [53]. Seventh, in addition to reporting about funding organizations\u2019 funding distribution mechanisms and patterns, we would have liked to report on funding organizations\u2019 priority setting processes as part of this work (another important aspect of how funders decide what gets funded). However, we found that priority setting processes were generally not well-described and highly variable across funders, making it difficult to analyse and report our data. It deserves recommendation that such an analysis is conducted in the future, but the development of a framework for assessing priority setting processes at funders is needed first, potentially based on existing guidance for health research priority setting [44]. Lastly, and most importantly, our search strategy was limited in scope (see for more detail Additional file 1), was aimed only at finding the 10 largest funding organizations of health research in the world, and detailed data were only collected for those 10 organizations."}, {"url": "https://www.arcolab.org/en/worlds-100-largest-philanthropic-foundations-list/", "page_content": "This list is the result of a research, carried out by ARCO\u2019s Social Economy Unit about the top 100 largest philanthropic foundations in the world by total assets; it is based on up to date financial data concerning the period 2016-2018. The sources mostly used, are the financial statements published by the foundations and the Foundation Centre database. We included the country where the foundation was established, the founding year and the official website.\n\nThe objective is to provide a complete list of the largest philanthropic foundations in the world.\n\nAt the first place there is the Dutch Stichting INGKA Foundation. It has been established by the founder of IKEA, Ingvar Kamprad and its philanthropic activity underpins on the support to architectural and interior design innovation. Recently it extended its philanthropic agenda to the fight against poverty in developing countries.\n\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation comes after Stichting INGKA at the second place. The US foundation mainly acts in the field of medical research, fight against AIDS and malaria, reduction of extreme poverty and education.\n\nThe Howard Hughes Medical Institute places third and it focuses on medical and biological research.\n\nThe majority of the foundations are from USA, followed by European ones, mostly from UK. We did not take consortium into account."}, {"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/philanthropy.asp", "page_content": "What Is Philanthropy?\n\nPhilanthropy involves charitable giving to worthy causes on a large scale, but it is much more than just a charitable donation. Philanthropy is an effort an individual or organization undertakes based on an altruistic desire to improve human welfare, and wealthy individuals sometimes establish private foundations to facilitate their philanthropic efforts.\n\nNonprofits are organizations set up to support a variety of social causes, such as educational, health, scientific, public safety, and human rights. In the United States, organizations that qualify as nonprofits are exempt from federal tax liability under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 501(c).\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways Philanthropy refers to charitable acts or other good works that help others or society as a whole.\n\nPhilanthropy can include donating money to a worthy cause or volunteering time, effort, or other forms of altruism.\n\nIncreased transparency is a serious matter for many nonprofits, and how funds are obtained and used should be carefully documented. Technology, including social media, has also shaped how many individuals give to others.\n\nAndrew Carnegie is one of America's most famous philanthropists, noted for the large scale of his charitable contributions, which included building more than 2,500 libraries worldwide.\n\nIn modern times, philanthropy is often undertaken by those seeking tax breaks, in addition to feeling good and helping others.\n\nUnderstanding Philanthropy\n\nPhilanthropy refers to charitable acts or other good works like volunteering your time or efforts that help others or contribute to the well-being of society overall. For some people, philanthropy means donations of money, often large sums, to support or create university buildings, research centers, or fund four-year college scholarships. For others, acts of philanthropy mean an annual donation to a local theater, food pantry, or public school.\n\nThere are many ways to make charitable contributions on a local to a global scale, including corporate philanthropy. There are also individual philanthropists. Philanthropy may be done for tax breaks or altruism, or a combination of the two things. Anyone can be a philanthropist if they give of their talent, time, money, or skills.\n\n\n\nThe word philanthropy traces its origins to the Latin word philanthropia and the Greek word philanthr\u014dpia, which mean love or kindness to mankind.\n\nHistory of Philanthropy\n\nPhilanthropy dates back to Greek society. For instance, Plato instructed his nephew in his will to use the proceeds of the family farm to fund the academy that he founded in 347 B.C. The money helped students and faculty keep the academy running.\n\nAround 150 years later, Pliny the Younger contributed one-third of the funds for a Roman school for young boys. He instructed the fathers of the students to come up with the rest. The intention was to keep young Romans educated in the city rather than abroad.\n\nIn 1630, John Winthrop of the Massachusetts Bay Colony preached to Puritan settlers that the rich should care for the poor, who could not help themselves. And in 1638, John Harvard laid the foundations for Harvard University after bequeathing half of his estate to found the school.\n\nMore modern and notable philanthropists include Mother Teresa and Norman D. Rockefeller. In the 21st century, philanthropy continues to be practiced in many forms by individuals like Warren Buffett, Melinda Gates, and Dolly Parton, as well as corporations.\n\nTechnology, including social media, has also shaped how many individuals give to others.\n\nBenefits of Philanthropy\n\nThere are many benefits to being a philanthropist. Experts conclude that charitable giving can improve one's emotional and even physical well-being, and philanthropists have the satisfaction of knowing they have contributed to the greater good. In fact, some studies show that philanthropists have less depression, higher self-esteem, lower blood pressure, and may even live longer than those who don't give.\n\nThe benefits of philanthropy are not limited to individuals. Corporations that support charitable giving receive a wealth of offerings from building a better public image, creating more vital brand awareness, and attracting new partners and talent who may be attracted to a company that contributes to charities.\n\nIn addition, employees who work for companies that give back to society are happier and contribute more to their jobs. And, because corporations are created to make money, a strong philanthropic streak often boosts sales and new customers.\n\nThe Charitable Contributions Deduction allows American taxpayers who make substantial charitable gifts to take generous tax deductions for the year in which their donations were made. Instructions for this tax deduction can be found on Schedule A on the IRS website.\n\nPhilanthropy and Taxes\n\nWhile it is true that individuals benefit from charitable giving when tax time comes, some benefit more than others. The IRS allows most individuals to deduct around 60% of their adjusted gross income (AGI).\n\nThere are very wealthy individuals who use charitable giving to shield themselves from large tax bills. But some say billionaires are dodging paying their fair share of taxes under the guise of charitable giving to the needy.\n\n\n\nStatistics on Giving\n\nAmericans and U.S. organizations gave about $484.85 billion to national charities in 2021. That number increased 4% from the previous year's estimated total of $466.23 billion, according to Giving USA as reported by Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. Some of the wealthiest Americans gave as much as $15 billion during the year, which represented 5% of all giving by individuals.\n\nSome of the highlights from Giving USA's annual report include:\n\nRoughly $326.87 billion in donations by individuals\n\nAn estimated $90.88 billion by foundations and other organizations\n\nMore than $46 billion through bequests, which are made through trusts and wills\n\nMore than $28 billion in corporate donations\n\nReligious organizations ($135.78 billion), education ($70.79), and human services ($65.33) received the most money. Donations to environmental and animal organizations (11%), foundations (9.3%), and health (7.7%) grew the most. These figures were not adjusted for inflation.\n\nAlthough the number rose from 2020, experts at Giving USA say the total didn't keep up with inflation. These were some of the challenges faced by individuals, corporations, and nonprofits alike during and immediately after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nExamples of Philanthropists\n\nMany people in the United States give money to causes in which they believe. The following are just some of the examples of people and corporations that engage in philanthropic activities.\n\n\n\nAndrew Carnegie\n\nPerhaps the most famous example of philanthropy came from Andrew Carnegie, simply because of the scale of his giving. Carnegie's wealth helped build more than 2,500 libraries all over the world. He also endowed several universities and a charitable trust that still runs 100 years after Carnegie's death in 1919.\n\nEstimates of his total charitable contributions exceed an estimated $350 million. Carnegie lived up to his credo that a man who dies rich dies disgraced, and the rest of society learned to follow his example.\n\nThe Ford Foundation\n\nThe Ford Foundation's legacy of giving is another example of how philanthropy works, The corporation was established by Edsel Ford, the son of Ford Motor Company founder Henry Ford. The foundation focuses on strengthening democracy, improving economic opportunity, and advancing education.\n\nSome of the areas the organization covers include:\n\nCivic engagement and government\n\nDisability inclusion\n\nGender, racial and ethnic justice\n\nNatural resources and climate change\n\n\n\nBill and Melinda Gates\n\nBillionaire and Microsoft mogul Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda, established the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to support global development and global health programs. The organization works globally and in the United States to research and combat disease and to fight poverty. According to the foundation's website, it has spent almost $54 billion on charitable giving since 2000.\n\n\n\nMother Teresa\n\nYou don't have to be a billionaire or give money away to be considered a philanthropist. In fact, there are notable individuals who aren't ultra-rich and are known for their philanthropic efforts. Mother Teresa is one of the most famous examples. The Catholic nun set up the Order of the Missionaries of Charity (now known simply as the Missionaries of Charity) in Kolkata, India, in 1950. The goal of the organization was to provide vulnerable communities with \"material and spiritual welfare.\"\n\n\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between Charity and Philanthropy? While some use the words charity and philanthropy interchangeably, philanthropy often casts a broader net of giving. Its role is to help society or groups in the community flourish over a long-term period. Charity is usually based on individual giving and helping in a short-term way, like donating coats to the homeless in winter, helping out or contributing goods to a local food pantry, or sending money to a scholarship fund. These are all acts of charity but may not be considered philanthropic efforts like building a school or a library or donating millions to a scholarship fund.\n\nWhich Philanthropist Has Donated the Most Money? According to an annual report in Forbes magazine, Warren Buffet has donated the most money, $46.1 billion, over his 91 years, as of January 2022.\n\n\n\nHow Can I Become a Philanthropist? Anyone can become a philanthropist, even if they are not wealthy individuals. You can donate your time, efforts, and cash to a specific cause, and over time, you may become known as a philanthropist.\n\nWhat Is Corporate Philanthropy? Corporate philanthropy is the act of giving to charitable causes and/or organizations by corporations. The most common way of giving through a corporation is by donating money but there are other ways to do so. Some of them include volunteering (like when employees donate their time to charities), scholarships, community investments, and sponsorships.\n\nWhat Are the Different Types of Philanthropy? Philanthropy can take on many different forms. It can be done by individuals and corporations. There can be a combination of both, where a company does matching donations whenever someone makes a donation. Or it can be done by bequest, which means instructions are left to give money and other assets to charity in a trust or someone's will. People can donate money directly to charity, fund scholarships, or offer grants and stipends. And it isn't just money that falls under the philanthropic umbrella. In fact, people can donate their time through volunteer work.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nMany of the world's billionaires donate a good portion of their wealth to charitable causes. And it can be hard to live up to that reputation. Contrary to what you may think, you don't have to be among the ultra-rich to be a philanthropist. Donating some of your monthly income may feel like the only way you can do good in the world but there are other ways to make a difference in the world. Giving some of your free time to causes you believe in is also a great way to become a philanthropist."}, {"url": "https://cof.org/content/foundation-basics", "page_content": "What is a charitable organization?\n\nCharities are a large and diverse group of nonprofit institutions that play a key role in American society and help to form and strengthen communities. With the help of millions of volunteers and the generosity of countless donors, they provide many services and perform many functions that in some countries are largely performed by government. Organizations that only operate charitable activities are classified under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nMany types of organizations are tax-exempt, but not all qualify for 501(c)(3) status. The 501(c)(3) designation is a legal designation reserved for organizations that are exclusively charitable. Other organizations exempt from federal income tax can be found under Section 501(c) of the Tax Code, but they do not qualify as 501(c)(3) organizations because they are permitted to operate programs that are both charitable and non-charitable.\n\nA few basic legal characteristics of 501(c)(3) organizations:\n\nContributions to 501(c)(3) organizations are generally tax deductible.\n\nGrants and activities may not assist election campaigns that support or oppose candidates for public office.\n\nGrants, compensation, and other payments must be made within specific guidelines, and for a charitable purpose, not for personal or private benefit.\n\nThe IRS classifies all 501(c)(3) organizations into two distinct types: private foundations and public charities.\n\nThe IRS is a good source of general information on the different types of tax-exempt organizations, all of which are under 501(c) of the Tax Code.\n\nIRS listing of all categories of tax-exempt organizations: https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/types-of-tax-exempt-organizations.\n\nback to top\n\nWhat is a foundation?\n\nIn the nonprofit sector, the term \"foundation\" has no precise meaning. The Council on Foundations defines a foundation as an entity that supports charitable activities by making grants to unrelated organizations or institutions or to individuals for scientific, educational, cultural, religious, or other charitable purposes. While foundations are often primarily engaged in grantmaking activities, some may engage in their own direct charitable activities or programs. When thinking about foundations in the charitable context, it is helpful to see how the IRS describes private foundations and public charities. Visit the Charities and Nonprofits section of the IRS website at www.irs.gov.\n\nThe IRS classifies all 501(c)(3) organizations into two distinct types: private foundations and public charities.\n\nback to top\n\nWhat is a private foundation?\n\nPrivate foundations are generally financially supported by one or a small handful of sources\u2014an individual, a family, or a corporation. There are a few different kinds of private foundations: independent, family, and corporate. These categories are not legally defined. Rather, they are commonly used in the field of philanthropy to distinguish the different kinds of private foundations. Private foundations must pay out at least 5 percent of their assets each year in the form of grants and operating charitable activities. A private operating foundation is a kind of private foundation and must operate under similar rules. However, it does not have to pay out 5 percent or more of its assets each year in grants. Instead, it must carry out its own charitable purposes. All private foundations are 501(c)(3) organizations. Under the Internal Revenue Code, a charity is presumed to be a private foundation unless it can prove that it is a public charity.\n\nMore about the different kinds of foundations is available in:\n\nback to top\n\nWhat is a public charity?\n\nPublic charities include a wide variety of charitable organizations, including hospitals, schools, churches, and organizations that make grants to others. Charities that primarily make grants are commonly referred to as public foundations. Most of these foundations are publicly supported charities, meaning they receive their funds from multiple sources, which may include private foundations, individuals, government agencies, and fees they charge for charitable services they provide. Some foundations are public charities because they meet at least one of the IRS tests for qualifying as a public charity. One kind of public charity, known as a supporting organization, is recognized by the IRS as charitable simply because of its legal relationship to one or more other public charities. A community foundation is yet another kind of public charity. In some cases, corporate foundations are set up as public, rather than private, foundations.\n\nThe IRS\u2019s \u201cCompliance Guide for Public Charities\u201d provides an overview of the compliance requirements public charities must meet in order to stay tax-exempt.\n\nIRS Compliance Guide for Public Charities\n\nWhat are the different types of public charities?\n\nback to top\n\nDo charities pay taxes?\n\nCharities generally do not pay state or federal income tax. They also may be exempt from paying state sales tax on their purchases and from local property tax on property they use to carry out their charitable activities. The extent and nature of exemptions from state taxes will vary from state to state. These generous exemptions recognize the important principle that organizations that act voluntarily to further the public good should be freed from the obligation to support government through the payment of taxes. Exemptions maximize the ability of charities to help others.\n\nback to top\n\nWhat are some key differences between a public charity and a private foundation?\n\nThe distinction between public charities and private foundations is a matter of federal tax law.\n\nPublic charities, unlike private foundations, are heavily supported by the public. For this reason, public charities are more subject to public scrutiny, which can help ensure adherence to appropriate standards of conduct in the absence of the more strict rules and regulations governing private foundations.\n\nSince 1969, private foundations have been subject to stricter and more extensive federal rules than public charities, including strict prohibitions on self-dealing, and limits on the amount of stock they can hold in any one company. Examples of the various regulated private foundation activities include:\n\nfinancial transactions between the foundation and its largest contributors, officers, and other insiders\n\namounts paid out toward operating costs, grants, and charitable programs\n\nreasonableness of the types and amounts of expenses incurred to operate the foundation\n\ncompensation of foundation staff and board members\n\nbusiness holdings of the foundation\n\nengaging in overly risky investments with charitable assets\n\ngrants or other payments to individuals, other private foundations, certain kinds of charities, and organizations that are not charities\n\nThese more stringent rules were less applicable in the public charity context, but in recent years have been applied in some degree to charities that administer funds that are considered to be donor-advised. Although public charities were traditionally not as heavily regulated as private foundations, it has been and is still recommended that charities follow the private foundation rules closely as guidance. Indeed, more and more, the IRS is requiring that public charities adhere to many of the private foundation rules when making certain kinds of grants or payments to individuals, charities, and non-charities. In addition, private foundations, supporting organizations, and organizations that administer donor-advised funds or scholarship funds must also stay in compliance with the charitable grantmaking provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 www.cof.org/ppa.\n\nback to top\n\nWhat are some different kinds of private foundations?\n\nOnce a foundation has been classified by the IRS as a private foundation, there are ways to describe it based on how the foundation is funded and governed. Most of the following terms are not legal classifications, but rather descriptive terms used within the field of philanthropy to help others understand how the foundation operates. What these foundations have in common is that they are established to aid social, educational, religious, or other charitable needs. Generally, there is a board of directors that makes discretionary giving decisions, often within specific guidelines as to charitable field of interest and/or geographic area.\n\nIndependent foundations are distinct from other kinds of private foundations like family or corporate foundations, in that they are not governed by the benefactor, the benefactor\u2019s family, or a corporation. They are usually funded by endowments from a single source such as an individual or group of individuals.\n\nare distinct from other kinds of private foundations like family or corporate foundations, in that they are not governed by the benefactor, the benefactor\u2019s family, or a corporation.

Corporate foundations (or company-sponsored foundations) are philanthropic organizations that are created and financially supported by a corporation. The foundation is created as a separate legal entity from the corporation, but with close ties to the corporation. Companies establish corporate foundations and giving programs to have a positive impact on society. Corporate foundations tend to make grants in fields related to their corporate activities or in communities where the corporation operates, or where their employees reside. Corporate foundations are usually set up as private foundations, but can be created as public foundations, particularly if they will be largely publicly supported. Rather than establish a separate foundation, a company can also make gifts and grants directly to charitable organizations through a program within the company itself. This is called a corporate giving program.\n\nare philanthropic organizations that are created and financially supported by a corporation.

The term \u201cinternational foundations\u201d also can refer to foundations in any country that primarily engage in cross-border giving. Not all foundations that engage in cross-border giving are private foundations; many are established as public charities. Under U.S. law, contributions from U.S. donors and corporations are not eligible for a charitable deduction if the organization is not formed in the United States or recognized by the United States as charitable.\n\ntypically are foundations based outside the United States that make grants in their own countries and overseas.

Private operating foundations are private foundations that primarily operate their own charitable programs, although some also make grants. Private operating foundation is a legal classification under the Internal Revenue Code, and these foundations must follow many of the private foundation rules. Unlike private foundations that are not operating, a private operating foundation is required to spend a certain portion of its assets each year on charitable activities. By contrast, private non-operating foundations are required to pay out 5 percent or more of their assets each year in grants.\n\nback to top\n\nWhat are the different types of public charities?\n\nStatutory public charities are considered charities as a matter of law and generally perform charitable activities rather than issuing grants. Some examples of statutory public charities are churches, universities, schools, nonprofit hospitals, and medical research institutions. Statutory public charities are classified under Sections 170(b)(1)(A) (i) through (v) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nPublic charities supported through donations are organizations that can show that a minimum percentage of their financial support comes from a broad cross-section of the public, rather than from just one source. These charities fall under Section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) of the Internal Revenue Code. The charity or foundation must satisfy one of two tests, both of which measure public support as a fraction of the total support the organization receives. This test is referred to as the public support test. Examples of charities that are publicly supported are community foundations, the American Red Cross, and the YMCA.\n\nPublic charities receiving exempt function income get a substantial portion of their support from program service revenue. These organizations earn revenue from activities like selling tickets, or by charging admission or other fees for the charitable services they provide. These public charities fall under Section 509(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code. Charities in this category must ensure their investment income does not normally exceed one-third of their total support. An example of this kind of charity would be a museum or opera that charges for admission.\n\nSupporting organizations are public charities classified under Section 509(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. A supporting organization is an organization that attaches itself to or supports another public charity (or charities) and\u2014in effect\u2014acquires the public charity status of the organization it supports. An example of a supporting organization is the philanthropic arm of a university or hospital. Certain grants to specific kinds of supporting organizations are prohibited or can only be made within strict guidelines.\n\nback to top\n\nAre contributions made to foundations tax deductible?\n\nContributions made to public and private foundations may be deducted from the donor\u2019s federal income tax if the donor is an individual or corporation. The amount of the deduction is subject to certain limits under federal tax law.\n\nGenerally, gifts to public charities receive more favorable tax treatment than gifts to private foundations. For example, charitable cash donations are deductible at up to 50 percent of the taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross income (AGI) when given to public charities, but the same gift to a private foundation is deductible at a rate of only 30 percent of AGI.\n\nThe best resource for finding out if you can take a charitable tax deduction and the applicable limits is the IRS website, www.irs.gov, and IRS Publication 526, as well as your tax and other professional advisors."}, {"url": "https://givingcompass.org/article/charity-versus-philanthropy", "page_content": "We connect donors to learning resources and ways to support community-led solutions. Learn more about us .\n\nWhen the Giving Compass team learned that the term \u201ccharity\u201d has been searched on Google six times more than \u201cphilanthropy\u201d since 2004, it initiated a dialogue about semantics and donor journeys.\n\nAlthough Giving Compass guides donors toward high-impact philanthropy practices, we recognize there are many different ways to do good. The conversation that occurred in our little microcosm got us thinking: How do others define charity and philanthropy and what does it mean to each of us?\n\nCharity vs. Philanthropy: Definitions\n\nCharity and philanthropy are sometimes used interchangeably, but there are noticeable differences.\n\nCharity is a natural, emotional impulse to an immediate situation and giving usually occurs in the short-term. Charity can take the form of monetary donations or volunteering.\n\nPhilanthropy addresses the root cause of social issues and requires a more strategic, long-term approach. In addition to giving money or volunteering, some philanthropists participate in advocacy work.\n\nDisaster relief is an example of where charity and philanthropy both play a role. When we see a tragedy in the news or via social media, many of us are inclined to provide aid for basic necessities during an emergency. For example, Google searches for \u201ccharity\u201d and correlated keywords reached an all-time high during the period surrounding Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (the 2004 Sri Lanka tsunami came in second for charity searches). In both cases, the number of searches increased roughly five-fold during peak times.\n\nOn the other hand, philanthropy looks at the full disaster relief life cycle, from prevention, to preparedness to recovery. Donors may focus on certain populations, such as the elderly or the poor, as part of their strategy or work directly with stakeholders to improve systems.\n\nRegardless of the issue area, the two terms -- and practices -- share one main thing in common: They\u2019re all about spreading the love.\n\nThe original meaning of charity -- \u201cChristian love of one\u2019s fellow,\u201d is rooted in Late Old English while philanthropy, or \u201cthe love of humanity,\u201d originated in Greek. When \u201ccharity\u201d entered the English lexicon by way of Old French\u2019s \u201ccharite,\u201d the meaning evolved to what we are familiar with today: Giving help or money to those in need. Meanwhile, the practice of modern philanthropy is often credited to titans of industry like Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller.\n\nDictionaries and history books are a great start, but what better way to understand modern-day charity and philanthropy than with a data dive into Google Trends. Here\u2019s what we learned:\n\nCharity has a strong correlation with donations, charitable giving, giving, children, charity ratings, and charity organizations.\n\nPhilanthropy correlates with searches related to managing, creating, knowledge, research, and organization.\n\nWhile charity is a popular search term nationwide, the term philanthropy is most popular in Washington, D.C., followed distantly by northeast strongholds New York and Massachusetts -- perhaps because many philanthropic organizations are headquartered in these areas.\n\nFrom Charity to Philanthropy (or Somewhere in Between)\n\nThose who are charitable give always, even when they have little, but when they have more and seek to up their game they start to connect with philanthropy.\n\nThere\u2019s also a place for both, whether you consider yourself a philanthropist or not. Each of us has a choice of where we want to make the most impact, including the ratio of charity and philanthropy we want to engage in.\n\nHow do you view charity and philanthropy? What form of giving is more empowering? For whom?\n\nGoogle Trends and Google Correlate data was accessed on Dec. 19, 2018 and March 31, 2020."}, {"url": "https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Philanthropic_foundation", "page_content": "\n\nA philanthropic foundation is a legal categorization of nonprofit organizations that either donate funds and support to other organizations, or provide the sole source of funding for their own activities. However, the United States Internal Revenue Code distinguishes between private foundations (usually funded by an individual, family, or corporation) and public charities (community foundations and other nonprofit groups that raise money from the general public). Private foundations have more restrictions and less tax benefits than public charities like community foundations. These foundations take different forms throughout the world.\n\nA philanthropic foundation is a way to live for the sake of others by supporting worthy causes that are for the betterment of society as a whole. Since it is difficult for people to provide these services directly and individually to the wider society, establishing such a foundation is a way for people with the desire and finances to help others, but not necessarily the ability or opportunity, to do so.\n\nOverview\n\nA philanthropic foundation is a permanent fund established and maintained by contributions for charitable, educational, religious, research, or other benevolent purposes. It generally takes the form of an institution or association given to rendering financial aid to colleges, schools, hospitals, and charities and generally supported by gifts for such purposes.[1]\n\nThe term \"foundation\" originates in civil law jurisdictions, where it is used to describe a distinct legal entity. A foundation has legal personality, and is entered in a public registry like a company. Unlike a company, it has no shareholders, though it may have voting members. It holds assets in its own name for the purposes set out in its constitutive documents, and its administration and operation is carried out in accordance with contractual rather than fiduciary principles. The foundation has a distinct patrimony independent of its founder.[2]\n\nFoundations are often set up for charitable purposes. The foundation finds its source in institutions of medieval times when a patron would establish a foundation to endow a monastery or other religious institution in perpetuity.\n\nThe act of giving wealth to benefit society is known as philanthropy, and individuals who establish these types of foundation for such purpose are philanthropists.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution Building or \"Castle\" on the National Mall serves as the Institution's headquarters.\n\nGeorge Peabody and James Smithson are well known early philanthropists. Peabody personally began the systematic program of donations which made him the world's first great philanthropist. The bulk of his fortune went to various scientific and educational institutions and to programs supporting the poor of England and the United States.[3] Smithson's will arranged that his fortune, barring any heirs, be donated to the United States government to establish a center of knowledge for the public, which became the world famous Smithsonian Institution.\n\nA Carnegie library, Macomb, Illinois.\n\nThe two most famous philanthropists of the Gilded Age pioneered the sort of large-scale private philanthropy of which permanent charitable foundations are a modern pillar: John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie. These businessmen each accumulated private wealth on a scale previously unknown outside of royalty, and each in their later years decided to give much of it away. Carnegie gave away the bulk of his fortune in the form of one-time gifts to build libraries and museums. Rockefeller followed suit (notably building the University of Chicago), but then gave nearly half of his fortune to create the Rockefeller Foundation. By far the largest private permanent endowment for charitable giving created to that time, the Rockefeller Foundation was the first to become a widely understood example of the species: a standing charitable grant-making entity outside of direct control by any level of government.\n\nStarting at the end of World War II, the United States' high top income tax rates spurred a burst of foundations and trusts being created, of which many were simply tax shelters. President Harry S. Truman publicly raised this issue in 1950, resulting in the passage later that year of a federal law that established new rigor and definition to the practice. The law did not go very far in regulating tax-exempt foundations, however; a fact which was made obvious throughout the rest of that decade as the foundation-as-tax-refuge model continued to be propagated by financial advisers to wealthy families and individuals. Several attempts at passing a more complete type of reform during the 1960s culminated in the Tax Reform Act of 1969, which remains the controlling legislation in the United States.\n\nFavorable income tax laws in the 1940s further spurred philanthropic activity. During the early 1950s many American foundations were attacked by right-wing journalists and Congressmen; between 1950 and 1953, the House of Representatives conducted two separate investigations into \u201csubversion and Communist penetration\u201d of the nation's philanthropic foundations. Attacks on the foundations began to subside, however, with the passing of the so-called McCarthy era. The 1980s and 1990s saw a doubling in the number of grantmaking foundations, including those developed by financier George Soros and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Due in part to economic prosperity, foundation giving doubled between 1990 and 1998 to $19.5 billion. In 1997, the largest recipients of grant dollars were education, health, and human services.[4]\n\nTypes of Foundations\n\nThe United States Internal Revenue Code defines many kinds of non-profit organizations which do not pay income tax. However, only charities can receive tax-deductible contributions and avoid paying property and sales tax. For instance, a donor would receive a tax deduction for money given to a local soup kitchen (assuming it has filed the proper 501(c)(3) documents), but not for giving money to the National Basketball Association, even though the NBA is a non-profit association.[5]\n\nTax-exempt charitable organizations fall into two categories: public charities and private foundations. Community foundations are considered public charities.[6]\n\nCommunity foundation\n\nCommunity foundations are instruments of civil society designed to pool donations into a coordinated investment and grant making facility dedicated primarily to the social improvement of a given place, or community. In other words, a community foundation is like a public foundation. This type of foundation requires community representation in the governing board and grants made to improve the community. Often there will be a city that has a community foundation where the governing board comprises many leaders of the business, religious, and local interests. Such grants that the community foundation would then make would have to benefit the people of that city. A typical example would be the Cleveland Foundation.\n\nExpress public involvement and oversight in community foundations allow their classification as public charities rather than private foundations.[7]\n\nPrivate foundation\n\nPrivate foundations typically have a single major source of funding (usually gifts from one family or corporation rather than funding from many sources) and most have as their primary activity the making of grants to other charitable organizations and to individuals, rather than the direct operation of charitable programs. When a person or a corporation founds a private foundation frequently family members of that person or agents of the corporation are members of the governing board. This limits public scrutiny over the private foundation, which entails unfavorable treatment compared to community foundations.\n\nFor tax purposes, there are a few variants of private foundation. The material difference is between \"operating\" foundations and \"grant-making\" foundations. Operating foundations use their endowment to achieve their goals directly. Grant-making foundations, like the Rockefeller Foundation, use their endowment to make grants to other organizations, which indirectly carry out the goals of the foundation. Operating foundations have preferential tax treatment in a few areas including allowing individual donors to contribute more of their income and allowing grant-making foundation contributions to count towards the five percent minimum distribution requirement.[8]\n\nFoundations around the world\n\nUnited States\n\nIn the United States a foundation is a type of philanthropic or charitable organization set up by individuals or institutions as a legal entity (a corporation or trust) with the purpose of distributing grants to support causes in line with the goals of the foundation or as a charitable entity that receives grants in order to support a specific activity or activities of charitable purpose.\n\nIn the United States, \"foundation\" has no special legal status (unlike \"incorporated\"), so foundations do not always have the word \"foundation\" in their name, while for-profit and public charities, that one would not consider to be a foundation, may use the word \"foundation\" in their name. The status of an organization is determined not by their name but by federal tax code as interpreted by the Internal Revenue Service.[9]\n\nMany philanthropic and charitable organizations are considered to be foundations. However, the Internal Revenue Code distinguishes between private foundations (usually funded by an individual, family, or corporation) and public charities (community foundations and other nonprofit groups that raise money from the general public). Private foundations have more restrictions and less tax benefits than public charities.\n\nThe Tax Reform Act of 1969 defined the fundamental social contract offered to private charitable foundations, the core of which has been imitated in law by other nations. In exchange for exemption from paying most taxes and for limited tax benefits being offered to donors, a charitable foundation must (a) pay out at least five percent of the value of its endowment each year, none of which may be to the private benefit of any individual; (b) not own or operate significant for-profit businesses; (c) file detailed public annual reports and conduct annual audits in the same manner as a for-profit corporation; (d) meet a suite of additional accounting requirements unique to nonprofits.\n\nAdministrative and operating expenses count towards the five percent requirement; they range from trivial at small understaffed foundations, to more than half a percent of the endowment value at larger staffed ones. Congressional proposals to exclude those costs from the payout requirement typically receive much attention during boom periods when foundation endowments are earning investment returns much greater than five percent; the idea typically fades when foundation endowments are shrinking in a down market.\n\nEngland\n\nIn England, the word foundation is sometimes used in the title of a charity, as in the British Heart Foundation and the Fairtrade Foundation. Despite this, the term is not generally used in English law, and (unlike in civil law systems) the term has no precise meaning.\n\nCanada\n\nFoundations in Canada collectively comprise a very large asset base for philanthropy. As of 2003, there were over two thousand active grantmaking foundations in Canada, who had total assets of twelve and a half billion dollars CAD, with total grants given that year of over one billion Canadian dollars. Under Canadian law, foundations may be public or private, but both are charities. In Canada under Canadian law, foundations may be public or private, but both are charities. They collectively comprise a large asset base for philanthropy.\n\nJapan\n\nMany successful Japanese corporations have established foundations for philanthropic work, an activity in keeping with their company vision. Toyota Motor Corporation established the Toyota Foundation in 1974, with the goal of advancing the happiness of individuals, and thereby to contribute to \"greater human happiness.\"[10] Numerous foundations in Japan exist that are supported by a corporate parent. Generally, however, they are not tied directly to the profitability of their parent corporation, but enjoy an independent existence. As the president of the Toyota Foundation notes, \"by contributing to society in this manner, Japanese corporations have created a special kind of private organization that they can be justifiably proud of on a global basis.\"[11]\n\nAdditionally, a number of Japanese corporations that have established foundations in America, based on their success in the US. Thus, the American Honda Foundation was established in 1984 in conjunction with American Honda's 25th anniversary in the United States. It was established to say \"thank you\" to the American people for their support through the years.[12] Other Japanese corporations establishing philanthropic foundations in the US include Sony Corporation of America and the Panasonic Foundation. Such philanthropic activity stems from a corporate philosophy built on the basic principle of respect for the individual and sharing joy with our customers, associates (employees) and society.[13]\n\nSpain\n\nFoundations in Spain are organizations founded with the purpose of not seeking profit and serving the general needs of the public. Such foundation may be founded by private individuals or by the public. These foundations have an independent legal personality separate from their founders. Foundations serve the general needs of the public with a patrimony that funds public services and which may not be distributed to the founders' benefit.\n\nSweden\n\nA foundation in Sweden is a legal entity without an owner. It is formed by a letter of donation from a founder donating funds or assets to be administered for a specific purpose. When the purpose is for the public benefit, a foundation may enjoy favorable tax treatment. A foundation may have diverse purposes, including but not limited to public benefit, humanitarian or cultural purposes, religious, collective, familiar, or the simple passive administration of funds. Normally, the supervision of a foundation is done by the county government where the foundation has its domicile, however, large foundations must be registered by the County Administrative Board (CAB), which must also supervise the administration of the foundation.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences ISBN links support NWE through referral fees\n\nBurlingame, Dwight F. 2004.

It is a bit confusing, even for those of us who work in it.\n\nHere is my take on the different kinds of philanthropic giving, including where the money comes from and how it operates, as well as some considerations and tips for grant seekers.\n\nThe different kinds of philanthropic funders\n\nOverall, philanthropic funding tends to fall into the following categories:\n\nPersonal Giving: Most of us give money to good causes, perhaps on a small scale like a donation to an online appeal, or perhaps on a large scale, like supporting the redevelopment of a children\u2019s hospital. And it is something that we can do any time \u2013 even through making a bequest in our will. Individual giving has historically been the largest single source of community funding.\n\nPrivate trusts and foundations: eg Tindall Foundation, JR McKenzie Trust, Todd Foundation, NEXT Foundation. Essentially this is a larger scale and more intentional, organised, transparent and accessible version of individual giving, where wealthy families or individuals set up a charitable organisation specifically to provide funding for good causes. Often the money is given out in the form of grants, which are financed through the income earned from an endowment fund that is invested and designed to last for generations. Some foundations operate on a \u201cspend-down\u201d model where a large sum of money is progressively given to the community until none remains, and sometimes the money may come from annual donations from family members. Some family foundations operate nationally and some regionally.\n\nCommunity Foundations, Donor Advised Funds and Trust companies eg Acorn Foundation, Auckland Foundation, the Gift Trust, Perpetual Guardian and Public Trust. These organisations provide a shared infrastructure both for managing giving from estates after the donor has passed on, and for people with some wealth who don\u2019t want to set up their own foundation. Services usually include both managing the investments and supporting grant making. The seventeen Community Foundations and the Gift Trust are non-profit models, while Trust Companies like Perpetual Guardian and Public Trust are commercial organisations.\n\nStatutory Trusts: These are grant-giving organisations which are set up via various acts of parliament and/or are administered by government agencies. Aotearoa NZ is unusual internationally in that we have a significant number of statutory trusts, which are in turn responsible for a significant portion of philanthropic funding. They include:\n\nCommunity Trusts: like Foundation North, Rata Foundation and Wellington Community Fund. These trusts were set up when the regional Savings Banks were sold in the 1980s and 1990s. The proceeds of these sales were invested, and the annual income generated is given as grants to communities, with each Community Trust focusing on the region in which their Trust bank operated. Here are twelve community trusts operating across Aotearoa.\n\nEnergy Trusts: like Rotorua Energy Charitable Trust, TECT. These trusts were set up in the 1990s, when the electricity supply authorities (e.g., local power boards) were restructured. There are 24 Energy Trusts in Aotearoa, although some support their communities through energy rebates rather than grants. Like Community Trusts, they also operate on a regional basis.\n\nGaming Trusts: eg Lion Foundation, NZ Community Trust, Pub Charity. These are technically statutory trusts however their funds come from the proceeds of gaming machines (pokies). Gaming Trusts are required by law to distribute at least 40% of gaming machine proceeds to the community.\n\nGovernment-administered grant schemes: eg Lottery Grants Board, Community Organisation Grants Scheme (COGS). Some grantmaking is administered directly by government agencies, and in particular the Department of Internal Affairs is responsible for a considerable number of funds, including the Lottery Grants, which distributes funds from the sale of lotto tickets. Many other government departments also provide grant schemes alongside funding provided through contracted services.\n\nThe above is not a definitive list but it covers most of the different kinds of philanthropic organisations in Aotearoa NZ. My acknowledgements to BERL, as the categorisation above is based on their research released in 2015 into the Philanthropic sector.\n\nOther considerations\n\nHere are two additional considerations:\n\nThe terms used are often not very helpful. Take for example the word \u201cfoundation.\u201d As Wikipedia notes, a \u201cfoundation is category of nonprofit organization or charitable trust that typically provides funding and support for other charitable organizations through grants\u2026.However, the term \u201cfoundation\u201d may also be used by organizations that are not involved in public grantmaking\u201d. So, if an organisation calls itself a foundation, the chances are that they provide grants to the community, but there are many examples, e.g., university and hospital foundations, which are endowment funds designed to specifically benefit the organisation which set them up. Similarly, a public grant-giving organisation may choose to call themselves a Trust rather than a Foundation.\n\nThere is a joke which goes \u201cIf you have seen one funder\u2026. you\u2019ve seen one funder\u201d. In other words, it is difficult to make generalisations about what funders want or how they think, because every funder works differently. Some are transparent (see my previous blog on funder transparency) and community focussed, some less so. But, thanks largely to the good work of peak body Philanthropy NZ, more funders are actively exploring their role to support communities well, particularly those who choose to be members of Philanthropy NZ.\n\nTop tips for grant-seekers\n\nSo yes, the philanthropic sector is a confusing one.\n\nWhat does this mean for community sector organisations looking for funding? Here are my top tips:\n\n1. Look for a good fit between what you do and what the funder focuses on. It is a waste of everyone\u2019s time to apply for funding when there is no alignment in what you are both trying to achieve.\n\n2. Try to have a conversation before applying. Often funders are willing to provide informal advice about potential applications.\n\n3. Look at who they have funded & how much they gave. If a funder only supports arts organisations and you are working on environmental projects, it is probably not worth applying. Similarly, if their average grant size is 10k and you are looking for 250k, again it is probably not worth applying.\n\n4. When writing grant applications, try to pitch them to an audience who:\n\n- Don\u2019t have much time \u2013 in other words, keep in succinct\n\n- Are not experts in your field \u2013 in other words, keep it simple and clear\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article appears on Kate Frykberg\u2019s website at https://kate.frykberg.co.nz/"}, {"url": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/values-aligned-philanthropy-foundations-resisting-hate-and-extremism/", "page_content": "Recent years have seen a rise in anti-democratic extremism, hate speech, and violence in the U.S. In 2019, the FBI documented hate incidents at an all-time high, not only in numbers but with increased levels of violence, including murder. As concern about these problems has grown, the search for solutions has led to questions about how hate groups are funded. What is the role of philanthropy and in particular, foundations of different types, in stopping the growth of hate and extremism? How does philanthropy handle requests from donors when those requests do not align with their values? What policies need to be proactively developed to address these issues?\n\nIn late 2020, the Council on Foundations launched the Values-Aligned Philanthropy initiative to build on previous efforts within the philanthropic sector and partner with others to respond to growing concerns about the issue of funding hate and extremism. The Council conducted interviews with 24 organizations from across the sector including a diverse group of foundations and Philanthropy-Supporting Organizations (PSOs), as well as advocates with specialized knowledge of how hate groups are funded. The Council released the Values-Aligned Philanthropy: Foundations Resisting Hate and Extremism white paper in August 2021, which identified five key challenges facing the sector:\n\nA lack of definitional clarity and broadly accepted resources for identifying these organizations Aligning organizational values Establishing policies and procedures Issues specific to Donor-advised funds (DAFs) Enlisting government support\n\nChallenge #1: A lack of definitional clarity and resources for identifying hate groups and gauging their harm\n\nA great many definitions of \u201chate\u201d and \u201cextremism\u201d exist, from the broad to the politically motivated to the definitions used by law enforcement agencies, several of which the Council collected as a resource for foundations looking for examples. Some foundations and advocates are content to let the terms speak for themselves and feel that the question of whether these terms apply to a specific group is one that should be decided on a case-by-case basis. Others are looking for a standard definition for the philanthropic sector that would be widely accepted and used. Having an agreed-upon definition can be a useful reference point in making determinations about funding when challenges arise but developing a policy should not be dependent on having a definition. It is not necessarily the best first step if it becomes a barrier to action rather than a helpful exercise. In practice, no matter what the definition, gray areas will remain and even the most carefully crafted definition will at times require discussion as to its application.\n\nMost foundations, especially small community foundations, do not have the capacity to conduct a thorough examination of all the activity of every single grantee- in order to determine for themselves whether groups qualify as hate groups, particularly groups that fall into ideological gray areas. However, foundations do not have to start from scratch: resources and tools do exist, including the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s (SPLC) frequently used list of documented hate groups and anti-government organizations, and foundations should use them in their decision-making. However, others feel that this list, while useful, represents a political point of view that is not accepted by all their stakeholders. Other organizations also track hate incidents\u2014see the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s HEAT Map and Council of American-Islamic Relations\u2019 Islamophobia Network. Additionally, Horizon Forum is currently developing a tool to aid foundations in their due diligence.\n\nIn short, there are tools available, but foundations should use discretion when using those tools: read the rationale behind a group\u2019s placement on the hate list and use that rationale to determine whether a group does or does not align with your organization\u2019s values.\n\nChallenge #2: Aligning organizational values\n\nIt is essential for foundations to clearly define organizational values\u2014and follow through with those values when both making and receiving grants. As one community foundation interviewed for the Council\u2019s report put it, \u201cIf you don\u2019t align with our ethical foundation, the action will probably be that your grant won\u2019t be honored.\u201d Further complications arise from communities with conflicting values, especially around polarizing issues. It is difficult and time-consuming to bring stakeholders into alignment to develop a shared understanding of what is valued. This is especially true for foundations serving ideologically, ethnically, politically, and religiously diverse communities\u2014and representing a group of stakeholders with the same level of diversity. Even foundations serving politically homogenous regions and with politically aligned staff do not agree on every issue. Moreover, foundations across the political spectrum struggle with not wanting to push any one political perspective onto donors.\n\nIn other words, the line between values and politics is not always clear. To circumvent this, foundations must clearly define their values. This has different meanings for different types of foundations. For example, some community foundations connect their concerns with hate and extremism with their organization-wide work around equity and inclusion, emphasizing that values that are shared across the political spectrum can be most powerful. For the Cleveland Foundation, developing an anti-hate policy was part of a broader equity and inclusion initiative\u2014and, for an organization representing diverse stakeholders and serving a diverse community, grounding its anti-hate policy in its anti-racism and inclusion programming gave the policy important context and logic.\n\nOther community foundations think beyond banning hate to instead reducing harm, which to them means ending any funding to programs they believe cause harm in the communities they serve\u2014for example, some foundations have ended funding to police-related charities in Black communities that have experienced police violence. Still other community foundations believe in neutrality and avoid taking sides on any controversial issues; they are nevertheless able to balance this principle of neutrality with concern about the impact of hate and extremism by funding groups regardless of their stance on certain political issues while simultaneously drawing the line at groups espousing hate or violence.\n\nTo do this, it is vital for community foundations to be proactive in establishing policies and procedures. For example, the Community Foundation of the Ozarks, headquartered in a conservative part of southwestern Missouri, began considering a viewpoint-based policy in the fall of 2020 after reading about another community foundation that had run into the issue. The Community Foundation of the Ozarks did what other foundations have done: they reached out to others in the sector for advice and sample policies. Yet even as they worked to develop this policy, a donor suggested a grant to an organization flagged by the SPLC as a hate group. Because the foundation did not have the policy in place, they felt it had to honor the requests\u2014but contacted the donor directly once the policy was approved to tell them they would not make future grants to the flagged organization. The donor was not happy with the change but maintained their relationship with\u2014and DAF at\u2014the foundation.\n\nIt is also key for organizations to remember that this is a sector-wide issue regardless of politics or ideology. Foundations serving communities across the ideological spectrum have developed anti-hate policies. The fight against hate and extremism is not limited to one side or the other. For example, Stand Together is a philanthropic community founded by Charles Koch to unite Americans across the political spectrum against division and violence. In the aftermath of the Charlottesville riots, Stand Together helped found Communities Overcoming Extremism: The After Charlottesville Project in partnership with the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nChallenge #3: A lack of knowledge about policy options and the need for sample policies\n\nIn general, foundations wading into this issue for the first time often lack the knowledge necessary to establish policies and procedures that are legal, effective, and broadly supported. This is further complicated by the varying needs faced by different types of foundations\u2014for example, community foundations that must maintain donor relationships or corporate foundations that must manage broad based brand appeal.\n\nFortunately, this problem has a relatively straightforward solution. The world of values-aligned grantmaking is collaborative to the point of symbiosis; foundations with these policies already in place tend to make them public, and furthermore, tend to welcome other foundations to adopt or modify their policies and procedures for those foundations\u2019 own needs. This came up regularly in the Council\u2019s research: the Community Foundation of the Ozarks and the Cleveland Foundation both reached out to other organizations for sample policies. (The Council recently launched a resource hub featuring sample policies from a variety of foundations across the U.S. that can serve as a starting point for those looking to establish their own policies.)\n\nOrganizations with deeper pockets can conduct even more outreach. For example, when Facebook sought to create its own policy around Facebook Fundraisers, it sought input from worldwide stakeholders, including experts on extremism and counterterrorism; experts on philanthropy; and members of civil society, especially NGOs. Their policy now makes explicit that Facebook reserves the right to deny or remove access to fundraising tools for organizations that violate its community standards.\n\nChallenge #4: Issues specific to donor-advised funds\n\nDonor-advised funds (DAFs) are valuable tools for donors, grantmaking, and grantees. For many community foundations, they are key sources of funding and a vital component of their sustainability model. For donors, they are an important tool for long-term support for a cause or community the donor cares about. But, because DAFs provide donors with an extra layer of anonymity, there is not public scrutiny when it comes to funding hate groups. Hypothetically, a donor can give to a DAF at a community foundation and knowingly or unknowingly advise the community foundation to make a grant to a hate group while maintaining anonymity about that donation. In addition, because of the importance of DAFs at community foundations, community foundations looking to establish values-aligned policies may worry that these policies will alienate donors who direct their donations to support controversial causes\u2014or that donors will avoid a foundation with any kind of grantmaking restrictions, especially when large national DAF sponsors do not always publicize similar restrictions.\n\nSome individual DAF holders believe that putting restrictions on where the funds can go is a violation of their First Amendment rights. This, however, has little legal support, because when the funds are given to the foundation for a tax benefit, the foundation assumes fiscal and legal responsibility for them, per the contract they have entered. Donors can make requests about where the funds are directed, but there are existing rules that already limit what kind of organizations can receive them, and foundations may exercise \u201cvariance power\u201d in determining where funds can go. Even large national DAF sponsors have exercised this option, as when Fidelity Charitable and Schwab Charitable banned new donations to 501(c)(3) organizations associated with the National Rifle Association in 2019.\n\nThis demonstrates the importance of a community foundation knowing its legal rights while also engaging in donor education where necessary. And again, foundations can avoid this issue by having a policy and process already in place when approached by donors; they can point to these policies when asked to make grants that do not align with their values, as the Community Foundation of the Ozarks now does. Clear communication is key here: if a foundation is upfront and honest about not supporting groups that advocate extremism, violence, or hate, it can avoid the complications associated with DAFs without sacrificing the flexibility and privacy they provide.\n\nSometimes DAF donors genuinely do not know that an organization could be considered a hate group and are unaware of all the activities and positions of the organization. Educating donors and taking the time to have a longer conversation is necessary, even if, in the end, no agreement is reached. Very few foundations reported major problems with donors once they were made aware of the situation, with more recounting that donors had been grateful to learn more about the organizations they had wished to support.\n\nChallenge #5: Enlisting government support\n\nFoundations and advocacy organizations were united in their belief that the IRS should take a more active role in stopping hate and extremist organizations from receiving tax-exempt non-profit status. In order to receive this status, charitable organizations must demonstrate that they are dedicated to the public good, and most people believe that an organization with non-profit status has done so. But oversight has become weakened in recent years, with many organizations being approved through online submissions that receive only the most perfunctory review. Although many donors assume that any organization achieving 501(c)(3) status, which makes contributions to them tax-exempt, has been closely examined as to its activities and screened to make sure that it does not engage in hate or extremism, this is simply not the case.\n\nCalls for increased funding for the IRS to improve oversight and to hold extremist and hate groups accountable have intensified since public awareness of the problem of hate funding has grown. In 2019, Congress held hearings related to hate groups and charitable organization status. This issue is contentious, with legal analysts expressing conflicting opinions over whether excluding them would violate First Amendment principles. Across the political spectrum, philanthropic organizations struggle with concerns about creating too much restriction and government intervention, and the impact this could have on donor enthusiasm, while simultaneously longing for a solution to this problem that could be provided from outside the sector. Many advocates believe that increasing government oversight and transparency can lead to exposure of organizations that are violating the law, as well as increasing the ability of government officials to monitor suspicious organizations.\n\nGovernment attention to these issues is high in the wake of the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and the key role played by racist extremists in the insurrection. Federal officials from many different agencies, including the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense, are working to understand how these events occurred. As the federal government does this work and issues reports on how extremists operate, it will increase public understanding of who these groups are and how to track their activity, which will aid philanthropy in helping to make sure they are not receiving foundation dollars. The Anti-Defamation League published a report in the wake of the January 6 events investigating extremist and hate groups who may be abusing their tax-exempt status.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe eight recommendations we propose to address these issues are detailed below. Foundation staff looking to get ahead of the issue should:\n\nFormulate a policy proactively, before a difficult situation arises. Pair your policy with a process for making decisions. Make sure you clearly understand and can explain the legal issues, particularly regarding DAFs. Use existing resources to inform your decisions. Align your policy with your organizational values. Create consistency with both giving and receiving funds. Communicate clearly and constantly with all the stakeholders. Join others in philanthropy taking a stand.\n\nFor the sector, as for the Council on Foundations, this work is ongoing. It is vital that the sector speaks with a united voice in the fight against extremism, violence, and hate. To do this, grantmaking organizations must be proactive about defining their values and creating policies and processes aligned with those values. The Council on Foundations is developing tools to support foundations working on these recommendations, including our Values-Aligned Philanthropy resource hub, and will release additional resources over the next year."}], "The Ridzik Foundation supports education, health, and economic development initiatives.": [{"url": "https://archpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13690-020-00402-5", "page_content": "In this section we identify and analyze patterns and associations between education and health indicators and discuss the results. Since countries vary in population sizes and other criteria, we use the estimated averages in all our analyses.\n\nComparison of health outcomes for countries by GDP per capita\n\nWe first analyzed to see if our data reflected the expectation that countries with higher GDP per capita have better health status (Fig. 1). We compared the average life expectancy at birth, average infant mortality, average deaths from cancer and average potential year of life lost, for different levels of GDP per capita (Fig. 1).\n\nFig. 1 Associations between Average Life Expectancy (years) and Average Infant Mortality rate (per 1000), and between Deaths from Cancer (rates per 100,000) and Average Potential Years of Life Lost (years), by GDP per capita (for all countries for years 1995\u20132015) Full size image\n\nFigure 1 depicts two charts with the estimated averages of variables for all countries in the sample. The X-axis of the first chart depicts average infant mortality rate (per 1000), while that of the second chart depicts average potential years of life lost (years). The Y-axis for both charts depicts the GDP per capita shown in intervals of 10 K ranging from 0 K\u2013110 K (US Dollars). The analysis is shown as an average for all the countries in the sample and for all the years (1995\u20132015). As seen in Fig. 1, countries with lower GDP per capita have higher infant mortality rate and increased potential year of life lost (which represents the average years a person would have lived if he or she had not died prematurely - a measure of premature mortality). Life expectancy and deaths from cancer are not affected by GDP level. When studying infant mortality and potential year lost, in order to avoid the influence of a control variable, it was necessary to group the samples by their GDP per capita level.\n\nAssociation of Infant Mortality Rates with enrollment rates and education levels\n\nWe explored the association of infant mortality rates with the enrollment rates and adult educational levels for all countries (Fig. 2). The expectation is that with higher education and employment the infant mortality rate decreases.\n\nFig. 2 Association of Adult Education Levels (ratio) and Enrollment Rates (ratio) with Infant Mortality Rate (per 1000) Full size image\n\nFigure 2 depicts the analysis for all countries in the sample. The figure shows the years from 1995 to 2015 on the X axis. It shows two Y-axes with one axis denoting average infant mortality rate (per 1000 live births), and the other showing the rates from 0 to 120 to depict enrollment rates (primary/secondary/tertiary) and education levels (below secondary/upper secondary/tertiary). Regarding the Y axis showing rates over 100, it is worth noting that the enrollment rates denote a ratio of the total enrollment (regardless of age) at a level of education to the official population of the age group in that education level. Therefore, it is possible for the number of children enrolled at a level to exceed the official population of students in the age group for that level (due to repetition or late entry). This can lead to ratios over 100%. The figure shows that in general, all education indicators tend to rise over time, except for adult education level below secondary, which decreases over time. Infant mortality shows a steep decreasing trend over time, which is favorable. In general, countries have increasing health status and education over time, along with decreasing infant mortality rates. This suggests a negative association of education and enrollment rates with mortality rates.\n\nAssociation of Education Outcomes with life expectancy at birth\n\nWe explored if the education outcomes of adult education level (tertiary), school life expectancy (tertiary), and NEET (not in employment, education, or training) rates, affected life expectancy at birth (Fig. 3). Our expectation is that adult education and school life expectancy, particularly tertiary, have a positive influence, while NEET has an adverse influence, on life expectancy at birth.\n\nFig. 3 Association of Adult Education Level (Tertiary), NEET rate, School Life Expectancy (Tertiary), with Life Expectancy at Birth Full size image\n\nFigure 3 show the relationships between various education indicators (adult education level-tertiary, NEET rate, school life expectancy-tertiary) and life expectancy at birth for all countries in the sample. The figure suggests that life expectancy at birth rises as adult education level (tertiary) and tertiary school life expectancy go up. Life expectancy at birth drops as the NEET rate goes up. In order to extend people\u2019s life expectancy, governments should try to improve tertiary education, and control the number of youths dropping out of school and ending up unemployed (the NEET rate).\n\nAssociation of Tertiary Enrollment and Education with potential years of life lost\n\nWe wanted to explore if the potential years of life lost rates are affected by tertiary enrollment rates and tertiary adult education levels (Fig. 4).\n\nFig. 4 Association of Enrollment rate-tertiary (top) and Adult Education Level-Tertiary (bottom) with Potential Years of Life Lost (Y axis) Full size image\n\nThe two sets of box plots in Fig. 4 compare the enrollment rates with potential years of life lost (above set) and the education level with potential years of life lost (below set). The analysis is for all countries in the sample. As mentioned earlier, the enrollment rates are expressed as ratios and can exceed 100% if the number of children enrolled at a level (regardless of age) exceed the official population of students in the age group for that level. Potential years of life lost represents the average years a person would have lived, had he/she not died prematurely. The results show that with the rise of tertiary adult education level and tertiary enrollment rate, there is a decrease in both value and variation of the potential years of life lost. We can conclude that lower levels in tertiary education adversely affect a country\u2019s health situation in terms of premature mortality.\n\nAssociation of Tertiary Enrollment and Education with child vaccination rates\n\nWe compared the performance of tertiary education level and enrollment rates with the child vaccination rates (Fig. 5) to assess if there was a positive impact of education on preventive healthcare.\n\nFig. 5 Association of Adult Education Level-Tertiary and Enrollment Rate-Tertiary with Child Vaccination Rates Full size image\n\nIn this analysis (Fig. 5), we looked for associations of child vaccination rates with tertiary enrollment and tertiary education. The analysis is for all countries in the sample. The color of the bubble represents the tertiary enrollment rate such that the darker the color, the higher the enrollment rate, and the size of the bubble represents the level of tertiary education. The labels inside the bubbles denote the child vaccination rates. The figure shows a general positive association of high child vaccination rate with tertiary enrollment and tertiary education levels. This indicates that countries that have high child vaccination rates tend to be better at tertiary enrollment and have more adults educated in tertiary institutions. Therefore, countries that focus more on tertiary education and enrollment may confer more health awareness in the population, which can be reflected in improved child vaccination rates.\n\nAssociation of NEET rates (15\u201319; 20\u201324) with infant mortality rates and deaths from Cancer\n\nIn the realm of child health, we also looked at the infant mortality rates. We explored if infant mortality rates are associated with the NEET rates in different age groups (Fig. 6).\n\nFig. 6 Association of Infant Mortality rates with NEET Rates (15\u201319) and NEET Rates (20\u201324) Full size image\n\nFigure 6 is a scatterplot that explores the correlation between infant mortality and NEET rates in the age groups 15\u201319 and 20\u201324. The data is for all countries in the sample. Most data points are clustered in the lower infant mortality and lower NEET rate range. Infant mortality and NEET rates move in the same direction\u2014as infant mortality increases/decrease, the NEET rate goes up/down. The NEET rate for the age group 20\u201324 has a slightly higher infant mortality rate than the NEET rate for the age group 15\u201319. This implies that when people in the age group 20\u201324 are uneducated or unemployed, the implications on infant mortality are higher than in other age groups. This is a reasonable association, since there is the potential to have more people with children in this age group than in the teenage group. To reduce the risk of infant mortality, governments should decrease NEET rates through promotional programs that disseminate the benefits of being educated, employed, and trained [7]. Additionally, they can offer financial aid to public schools and companies to offer more resources to raise general health awareness in people.\n\nWe looked to see if the distribution of population without employment, education, or training (NEET) in various categories of high, medium, and low impacted the rate of deaths from cancer (Fig. 7). Our expectation is that high rates of NEET will positively influence deaths from cancer.\n\nFig. 7 Association of Deaths from Cancer and different NEET Rates Full size image\n\nThe three pie charts in Fig. 7 show the distribution of deaths from cancer in groups of countries with different NEET rates (high, medium, and low). The analysis includes all countries in the sample. The expectation was that high rates of NEET would be associated with high rates of cancer deaths. Our results, however, show that countries with medium NEET rates tend to have the highest deaths from cancer. Countries with high NEET rates have the lowest deaths from cancer among the three groups. Contrary to expectations, countries with low NEET rates do not show the lowest death rates from cancer. A possible explanation for this can be attributed to the fact that in this group, the people in the labor force may be suffering from work-related hazards including stress, that endanger their health.\n\nAssociation between adult education levels and health expenditure\n\nIt is interesting to note the relationship between health expenditure and adult education levels (Fig. 8). We expect them to be positively associated.\n\nFig. 8 Association of Health Expenditure and Adult Education Level-Tertiary & Upper Secondary Full size image\n\nFigure 8 shows a heat map with the number of countries in different combinations of groups between tertiary and upper-secondary adult education level. We emphasize the higher levels of adult education. The color of the square shows the average of health expenditure. The plot shows that most of the countries are divided into two clusters. One cluster has a high tertiary education level as well as a high upper-secondary education level and it has high average health expenditure. The other cluster has relatively low tertiary and upper secondary education level with low average health expenditure. Overall, the figure shows a positive correlation between adult education level and compulsory health expenditure. Governments of countries with low levels of education should allocate more health expenditure, which will have an influence on the educational levels. Alternatively, to improve public health, governments can frame educational policies to improve the overall national education level, which then produces more health awareness, contributing to national healthcare.\n\nAssociation of Compulsory Health Expenditure with NEET rates by country and region\n\nHaving explored the relationship between health expenditure and adult education, we then explored the relationship between health expenditure and NEET rates of different countries (Fig. 9). We expect compulsory health expenditure to be negatively associated with NEET rates.\n\nFig. 9 Association between Compulsory Health Expenditure and NEET Rate by Country and Region Full size image\n\nIn Fig. 9, each box represents a country or region; the size of the box indicates the extent of compulsory health expenditure such that a larger box implies that the country has greater compulsory health expenditure. The intensity of the color of the box represents the NEET rate such that the darker color implies a higher NEET rate. Turkey has the highest NEET rate with low health expenditure. Most European countries such as France, Belgium, Sweden, and Norway have low NEET rates and high health expenditure. The chart shows a general association between low compulsory health expenditure and high NEET rates. The relationship, however, is not consistent, as there are countries with high NEET and high health expenditures. Our suggestion is for most countries to improve the social education for the youth through free training programs and other means to effectively improve the public health while they attempt to raise the compulsory expenditure.\n\nDistribution of life expectancy at birth and tertiary enrollment rate\n\nThe distribution of enrollment rate (tertiary) and life expectancy of all the countries in the sample can give an idea of the current status of both education and health (Fig. 10). We expect these to be positively associated.\n\nFig. 10 Distribution of Life Expectancy at Birth (years) and Tertiary Enrollment Rate Full size image\n\nFigure 10 shows two histograms with the lines representing the distribution of life expectancy at birth and the tertiary enrollment rate of all the countries. The distribution of life expectancy at birth is skewed right, which means most of the countries have quite a high life expectancy and there are few countries with a very low life expectancy. The tertiary enrollment rate has a good distribution, which is closer to a normal distribution. Governments of countries with an extremely low life expectancy should try to identify the cause of this problem and take actions in time to improve the overall national health.\n\nComparison of adult education levels and deaths from Cancer at various levels of GDP per capita\n\nWe wanted to see if various levels of GDP per capita influence the levels of adult education and deaths from cancer in countries (Fig. 11).\n\nFig. 11 Comparison of Adult Education Levels and Deaths from Cancer at various levels of GDP per capita Full size image\n\nFigure 11 shows the distribution of various adult education levels for countries by groups of GDP per capita. The plot shows that as GDP grows, the level of below-secondary adult education becomes lower, and the level of tertiary education gets higher. The upper-secondary education level is constant among all the groups. The implication is that tertiary education is the most important factor among all the education levels for a country to improve its economic power and health level. Countries should therefore focus on tertiary education as a driver of economic development. As for deaths from cancer, countries with lower GDP have higher death rates, indicating the negative association between economic development and deaths from cancer.\n\nDistribution of infant mortality rates by continent\n\nInfant mortality is an important indicator of a country\u2019s health status. Figure 12 shows the distribution of infant mortality for the continents of Asia, Europe, Oceania, North and South America. We grouped the countries in each continent into high, medium, and low, based on infant mortality rates.\n\nFig. 12 Distribution of Infant Mortality rates by Continent Full size image\n\nIn Fig. 12, each bar represents a continent. All countries fall into three groups (high, medium, and low) based on infant mortality rates. South America has the highest infant mortality, followed by Asia, Europe, and Oceania. North America falls in the medium range of infant mortality. South American countries, in general, should strive to improve infant mortality. While Europe, in general, has the lowest infant mortality rates, there are some countries that have high rates as depicted.\n\nAssociation between child vaccination rates and NEET rates\n\nWe looked at the association between child vaccination rates and NEET rates in various countries (Fig. 13). We expect countries that have high NEET rates to have low child vaccination rates.\n\nFig. 13 Association between Child Vaccination Rates and NEET rates Full size image\n\nFigure 13 displays the child vaccination rates in the first map and the NEET rates in the second map, for all countries. The darker green color shows countries with higher rates of vaccination and the darker red represents those with higher NEET rates. It can be seen that in general, the countries with lower NEET also have better vaccination rates. Examples are USA, UK, Iceland, France, and North European countries. Countries should therefore strive to reduce NEET rates by enrolling a good proportion of the youth into initiatives or programs that will help them be more productive in the future, and be able to afford preventive healthcare for the families, particularly, the children.\n\nAverage smoking rate in different continents over time\n\nWe compared the trend of average smoking rate for the years 1995\u2013201 for the continents in the sample (Fig. 14).\n\nFig. 14 Trend of average smoking rate in different continents from 1995 to 2015 Full size image\n\nFigure 14 depicts the line charts of average smoking rates for the continents of Asia, Europe, Oceania, North and South America. All the lines show an overall downward trend, which indicates that the average smoking rate decreases with time. The trend illustrates that people have become more health conscious and realize the harmful effects of smoking over time. However, the smoking rate in Europe (EU) is consistently higher than that in other continents, while the smoking rate in North America (NA) is consistently lower over the years. Governments in Europe should pay attention to the usage of tobacco and increase health consciousness among the public.\n\nAssociation between adult education levels and deaths from Cancer\n\nWe explored if adult education levels (below-secondary, upper-secondary, and tertiary) are associated with deaths from cancer (Fig. 15) such that higher levels of education will mitigate the rates of deaths from cancer, due to increased awareness and proactive health behavior.\n\nFig. 15 Association of deaths from cancer with adult education levels Full size image\n\nFigure 15 shows the correlations of deaths from cancer among the three adult education levels, for all countries in the sample. It is obvious that below-secondary and tertiary adult education levels have a negative correlation with deaths from cancer, while the upper-secondary adult education level shows a positive correlation. Barring upper-secondary results, we can surmise that in general, as education level goes higher, the deaths from cancer will decrease. The rationale for this could be that education fosters more health awareness and encourages people to adopt healthy behavioral practices. Governments should therefore pay attention to frame policies that promote education. However, the counterintuitive result of the positive correlation between upper-secondary levels of adult education with the deaths from cancer warrants more investigation.\n\nWe drilled down further into the correlation between the upper-secondary education level and deaths from cancer. Figure 16 shows this correlation, along with a breakdown of the total number of records for each continent, to see if there is an explanation for the unique result.\n\nFig. 16 Association between deaths from cancer and adult education level-upper secondary Full size image\n\nFigure 16 shows a dashboard containing two graphs - a scatterplot of the correlation between deaths from cancer and education level, and a bar graph showing the breakdown of the total sample by continent. We included a breakdown by continent in order to explore variances that may clarify or explain the positive association for deaths from cancer with the upper-secondary education level. The scatterplot shows that for the European Union (EU) the points are much more scattered than for the other continents. Also, the correlation between deaths and education level for the EU is positive. The bottom bar graph depicts how the sample contains a disproportionately high number of records for the EU than for other continents. It is possible that this may have influenced the results of the correlation. The governments in the EU should investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon. Also, we defer to future research to explore this in greater detail by incorporating other socioeconomic parameters that may have to be factored into the relationship.\n\nAssociation between average tertiary school life expectancy and health expenditure\n\nWe moved our focus to the trends of tertiary school life expectancy and health expenditure from 1995 to 2015 (Fig. 17) to check for positive associations.\n\nFig. 17 Association between Average Tertiary School Life Expectancy and Health Expenditure Full size image\n\nFigure 17 is a combination chart explaining the trends of tertiary school life expectancy and health expenditure, for all countries in the sample. The rationale is that if there is a positive association between the two, it would be worthwhile for the government to allocate more resources towards health expenditure. Both tertiary school life expectancy and health expenditure show an increase over the years from 1995 to 2015. Our additional analysis shows that they continue to increase even after 2015. Hence, governments are encouraged to increase the health expenditure in order to see gains in tertiary school life expectancy, which will have positive implications for national health. Given that the measured effects of education are large, investments in education might prove to be a cost-effective means of achieving better health."}, {"url": "https://www.health.org.uk/publications/reports/using-economic-development-to-improve-health-and-reduce-health-inequalities", "page_content": "Creating a society where everyone has an opportunity to live a healthy life requires action across government.

He is the founder of philosophical Taoism and is worshipped as a deity in Taoism and traditional Chinese religions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are more children in school today than ever before. For example, in 1950 the average level of schooling in Africa was less than two years. It is more than five years today. In East Asia and the Pacific, the schooling of the population went from two to seven years between 1950 and 2010. This is a more than a 200 percent increase! Globally, average years of schooling are now projected to rise to 10 years by 2050. This is larger than a five-fold increase within a century and a half.\n\nYet, there are still 124 million children and adolescents not in school. Also, more than 250 million school children cannot read, even after several years of schooling.\n\n\n\nHere are five things you should know about the pivotal role of education in economic development:\n\n\n\nEducation is an investment\n\n\n\nThe importance of knowledge and learning has been recognized since the beginning of time. Plato wrote: \u201cIf a man neglects education, he walks lame to the end of his life.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut it was really the Nobel winning economists that put the argument of education as investment. T.W. Schultz argued that investment in education explains growth and Gary Becker gave us the Human Capital Theory.\n\n\n\nIn a nutshell, the Human Capital Theory posits that investing in education has a payoff in terms of higher wages. Moreover, the theory and empirical estimates are backed up by current science, as explained by James Heckman.\n\n\n\nNeurogenesis tells us that learning can continue into advanced ages. The relative costs and benefits to investments in older persons compared to younger persons differs. Investments in more able workers at any age generate higher returns than investments in less able workers, and ability is formed at early ages.\n\n\n\nEducation pays\n\n\n\nOverall, another year of schooling raises earnings by 10 percent a year. This is typically more than any other investment an individual could make:"}, {"url": "https://www.globalpartnership.org/blog/investments-health-and-education-support-developing-countries-path-self-reliance", "page_content": "To illustrate this point, let\u2019s consider children ages 5 to 9 who are at greatest risk of not attending school due to infections and malnutrition. School-based deworming can reduce absenteeism by 25% [3] and school meals can increase attendance by 8% [4].\n\nFor these reasons, school-based health interventions are sometimes found to have a larger impact on access to schooling and learning than incentive- and instruction-based interventions [5].\n\nRebalancing investments in health and education for greatest impact\n\nPresently global investment in both health and education is insufficient and inappropriately targeted to meaningfully improve human capital. Countries are largely directing health investments to children in younger ages, while conversely, education investments are targeted to older children [2].\n\nWhat is apparent is that greater investment by the health sector for school-age children and adolescents would enhance education returns, through better learning and attendance, and create an enabling environment for vulnerable children to transition to secondary school.\n\nSimilarly, greater education investments targeted to early childhood education can foster soft skill development and school readiness and leverage better health outcomes from a better educated population. After all, children and adolescents need to be healthy and have the necessary educational foundation to enter, adapt and perform in the labor market when transitioning to adulthood.\n\nInvestments in human capital have strong returns throughout the crucial development phases during the first 8000 days - from child survival, to early child development, through school age and adolescence. The health and education sectors each have tangible and specific areas of investment that require greater attention to improve human capital outcomes. These include:\n\nThe education sector\u2019s current focus on early childhood development needs to be matched by a focus on early childhood education. Similarly, the focus on primary education should be supported by an equal focus on secondary education, including vocationally-focused curricula, which includes and goes beyond digital literacy.\n\nThe health sector should sustain its investment in the first 1000 days, and at least double its investment during middle childhood and adolescence when children have their most important opportunity to attend school and learn.\n\nThe education and health sectors should coordinate their efforts to maximize synergies; the timing of interventions relative to critical development stages matters.\n\nThe Human Capital Index comes at a pivotal point in our global economy. Technology is driving economic change at an unprecedented pace. Multisector programming and coordination can best position populations to respond to these challenges.\n\nGreater investment in health and education across the first 8,000 days is an investment that will pay dividends as countries aim to sustainably address their most pressing development challenges."}, {"url": "https://pha.berkeley.edu/2021/04/20/health-economics/", "page_content": "by Kaavya Venkat in Spring 2021\n\nHealthcare can be dependent on an individual\u2019s/nation\u2019s income. But, a country\u2019s economy can be heavily influenced by better health practices and policies. As Bloom and Canning stated: \u201cHealth may be not only a consequence but also a cause of high income.\u201d This can work through several mechanisms. These mechanisms include increasing human capital via methods such as keeping a stable population, taking public health/preventive methods to ensure safety for all, and ensuring that there is an equitable distribution of national funds.\n\nWhen we first view healthcare, we examine how the economy has benefited us. Studies show that an increase in income is correlated with better health. If income was even 1 percent higher in developing countries, the infant mortality rates in these regions will decrease immensely. Raising per capita incomes will be an important component of any country\u2019s health strategy. However, there are limitations to this. When new treatments come out to the public, the people who can access it first will be the people who are better off. This causes a divide between classes of people, which increases healthcare inequality, which is when one group of people in an economy is in much worse health than another group. In the United States, health inequality is heavily correlated with income inequality. As healthcare becomes more privatized, it becomes harder for poor populations to get the help they need.\n\nIncreased income also contributes to increased spending on public and private goods that directly or indirectly improve health. But, this can only occur if this increased income also comes with policies stating that there will be an equitable distribution of income. According to the Preston Curve, over time there will be an increasing and concave relationship, shifting upward. The Preston Curve only models 10-25% of the improvements countries have made in terms of their life expectancy and national income per capita. 70-90% of the improvements for life expectancy come from other factors such as public health interventions and diffusion of health sector innovations.\n\nAccording to Amartya Sen\u2019s Capabilities Approach, \u201cgiven other factors, higher income is a contributory factor to better health,\u201d but it\u2019s not the only factor. Also, other factors may not be generalized across various countries due to differences in governance and policy. Sen believes deeply in the idea that healthier workers are more productive, which is what makes a nation wealthier. He believed in two processes in which economic growth may affect human health. The first method is the growth-mediated process. This describes a fast economic growth, where success depends on \u201ceconomically broad\u201d systems (strong employment emphasis is a major factor) and the use of funds for social services, such as health care, education, and social security. The second process is the support led process in which it \u201cdoes not operate through fast economic growth, but works through a program of skillful social support of health care, education, and other relevant social arrangements.\u201d The support led process gave a more holistic approach to healthcare, which would be a way to catalyze human capital. This process gives us insight into how health can cause an increase in income, benefiting the economy.\n\nHealth and economic development are very interconnected as we can see already from the examples above. Recently, studies have shown that better health helps with economic growth (healthy workers help build a wealthy nation). Three factors contribute to the concept of health being the facilitator for economic growth. The first factor is having a low age dependency ratio, which means that the population age structure needs regulation so that it can be maintained to sustain people\u2019s lifestyles. Declining mortality and fertility rates help lower the dependency ratio. The dependent population consists of children (0-14 years old) to senior citizens (65+ years old). These are vulnerable groups of people because the children need strong support during their developing years since they are being trained to eventually go into the workforce to then in return take care of the older generation that also helped them get to a stable place in life. The age ratio is calculated by dividing the dependent population by the working population (15-64 years old). As more children and the elderly become more dependent, there will be a noticeable shortage of labor, which is harmful for the economy. The country would not be able to make enough income to support all its citizens. According to the World Bank, as the dependency ratio went down between 1965-2009, the GDP per capita increased in Asian Countries. This is known as the Asian Miracle (the data for this is shown in the World Bank\u2019s table on demographic variables affecting economic growth from 1965 \u2013 2005) (see Table 1).\n\nThe link between health and GDP is depicted in the chart by Ruger and co (see Figure 1). Poor health reduces GDP per capita by reducing both labor productivity and the relative size of the labor force. A higher dependency ratio is shown to lower GDP per capita. When there is a higher dependency, sometimes populations are not able to sustain themselves due to high fertility/mortality, and a reduction in the labor force. These would be consequences of child/adult illness and malnutrition, which directly affects productivity among the workforce.\n\nThe other two factors are high physical capital accumulation (savings) and higher investments towards Human capital development (to create healthier, more educated and productive labor). Better health increases productivity within laborers. These factors had a huge role to play within the Asian Miracle. High levels of savings contributed to high rates of physical capital. This helps build a more sustainable environment because there is an increase in the need for saving towards retirement funds. The working population usually has the main peak in savings when they are preparing for retirement. A longer perspective lifespan can increase the incentive to save for retirement and business investment. As long as families can sustain their earnings and spending, they are usually in a comfortable position. The only issue some countries face is the high cost of healthcare, which can cause families to go into debt/poverty. But in an ideal situation, the savings can alleviate some of the stress when it comes to healthcare costs.\n\nWhen people start saving more, this causes a savings boom, which in turn causes a baby boom. Baby booms help provide the future with labor supply, but it also ensures that there will be a higher investment in education and health since they are dependent on the working (saving) population. Childhood is fundamental for development, which sets the stage for the rest of people\u2019s lives. If they have a strong foundation with proper education it can have a direct correlation to their cognitive skills, learning abilities, and willingness to continue education to go into the workforce. A lower mortality rate will also be observed with this factor since the older population can rely on the working population too. But low mortality rates correlate with low birth/fertility rates, which is also good to keep the population stable. Low mortality and fertility rate also correlated to a more working population and even more female labor force participation.\n\nWith a better population structure, Asia was able to build its human capital, which has also helped with their economic growth, making Asian countries some of the largest and most dominant powerhouses in the world. When there is more productivity and a goal for holistic healthcare for workers, it encourages people to contribute to the workforce, which is beneficial for the economy.\n\nThe most recent pandemic that has affected a lot of lives this year is the coronavirus. This has forced nations to look at epidemiologic methods to help solve the issue. \u201cepidemiology is concerned with the distribution of disease and death, and with their determinants and consequences in population groups.\u201d According to the epidemiologic transition model, disease control is not only a prerequisite of fertility transition but an effective instrument of socio-economic development as well. There are three main disease determinants that we need to focus on to tackle the coronavirus. First are the eco-biological determinants, which requires the balancing of the disease with the environment and the hosts. Then we have socioeconomic, political, and cultural determinants, which ties in with economics because this relates to healthy living conditions, hygiene, and access to quality nutrition. Finally, we have medical and public health determinants. With a better economy, the country can focus on public health awareness and health education that can warn people about large-scale pandemics. Also, with proper distribution of funds, a country can develop into having better sanitation, immunizations, and access to therapy (because health is more than just medical/physical healthcare).\n\nAs countries become more modernized (westernized), technological advancements play a larger role in the healthcare field. The developing world is being significantly influenced by imported medical technology. But, historical evidence shows that economic growth was not the only source of epidemiological change. In most cases, the past shows that economic growth, with increased industrialization, has always affected health negatively. For example, the industrial revolution (1830-1840) created epidemiological disasters in new industrial cities within England. Social and political movements were the cause of spreading healthcare awareness and benefits with a nation\u2019s accumulation of wealth. This includes public health measures such as ensuring that there is a clean water system, better housing with increased community health efforts, and regulation of urban lifestyles with food and environmental issues.\n\nWith this public health approach, citizens can be more informed about their surroundings and health issues that may arise. The coronavirus is one of the largest pandemics we have seen in years. If there had been accessible health services, and more awareness about health and hygiene, this could have been prevented. The reason the virus is spreading so fast and across the globe is due to a lack of awareness of how to contain this in certain regions. However, some countries are shutting off the entry, or are making sure to do intensive checks on people to make sure the virus does not spread more.\n\nIn Singapore, the government is highly involved in protecting the health of its people. As soon as they received news about outbreaks, they closed the country to the virus through the land, air, and sea. They make sure to do extensive checks on cars entering the island, airports are filled with officials making sure that the health of people entering Singapore is safe, and the coastal lines are highly secured as well. Anyone with a fever does not get through. Within the country, they are putting more effort into sanitation by cleaning bus poles, playgrounds, schools, food courts, elevator buttons, and anything accessible to the public. Also, the Singapore army packed around a million masks for the whole country for every single household and distributed them to everyone for their safety. This is a great example of how a government should be spending its money on better preventative public health measures. These measures were taken place due to the government prioritizing the pandemic through the distribution of the nation\u2019s wealth into awareness and action against coronavirus.\n\nHuman capital, as a driver of upwards-socioeconomic mobility, is the key to improving our healthcare system. It is the glue for a holistic approach that bridges the gap between the physical financial barriers and productive healthcare policy."}, {"url": "https://ideas.repec.org/a/cup/macdyn/v23y2019i02p837-869_00.html", "page_content": "This paper examines the relationships of income with education and health using heterogeneous panel cointegration techniques to account for the potential cross-country heterogeneity in the effects of education and health.

It refers to the process where a country\u2019s poor living conditions improve for the better, which ultimately results in improved economic and social conditions for the population. Education is one of the primary resources of change; its role is to help people acquire knowledge and skills, which can, in turn, be used to acquire jobs.\n\nHouseholds with educated people stand a better chance of lifting themselves out of poor living conditions than households without educated people in them. Consistent income offered to the working class ensures financial security for the working class, their families and their communities. Because of its contribution to economic development, education is viewed as human capital. Any type of investment made in education builds opportunities for national economic development.\n\n\n\nThe current state of skills development\n\nAs a developing country, education in South Africa is still a huge challenge with many cities and rural areas still grappling with the lack of poor infrastructures such as school buildings, transportation roads to the schools, electricity, food and other basic necessities.\n\nThere\u2019s also a huge gap in skills development areas, with both soft skills and hard skills lacking in various fields. This adds to the current state of unemployment, which is at a high of 29.1 percent, with a 0.1 percent increase in the third quarter of 2019, according to Stats SA. Skills development is critical in ensuring that South Africans have access to quality skills and training, which will equip them with the necessary skills to enter the workforce.\n\nThe Skills Development Act 97 of 1998 seeks to empower South Africans with skills necessary in the workforce. It also has a responsibility to improve the quality of life of the people who are already working and to improve their productivity levels. It seeks to increase the levels of investment in education and training in the labour market.\n\nLastly, the act aims to improve on the return of investment, promote self-employment and improve the delivery of services within the workforce. However, work in the skills development sector has not yielded any notable results, and there are a number of setbacks, as mentioned above, which have a huge impact on the progress of economic development.\n\nThe question here is, are there any future plans to find solutions to these issues?\n\nSolutions and how they impact economic development\n\nWhen the minister of finance, Tito Mboweni, held the 2020 budget speech at the National Assembly, he outlined a few plans geared towards the revamping of the education system in the country. He outlined that the budget for education infrastructure is allocated at R5.2 billion over the medium term. Furthermore, in 2017, the National Treasury allocated funds to the Department of Basic Education (DBE) in order to address the backlogs in the eradication of inappropriate school structures and the provision of basic services (water, sanitation and electricity) to schools. This is done through the Infrastructure Delivery Division (IDD). The programme is part of the schooling 2025 plan aimed at improving learning outcomes and bringing better access to education. The IDD conceived this programme as a medium-to-long-term initiative, with the goal of eliminating the backlog in schools\u2019 infrastructure.\n\nDBSA acts as an implementing agent for the construction of new schools under the programme, and thus far, we have been able to complete the construction of 111 schools. The schools have been completed in phases based on when the handover to contractor took place and the size and scope of the school. The overall success in this programme has opened up opportunities for the Bank to also support other provincial departments of education with the realignment, construction and refurbishment of storm-damaged schools.\n\n\n\nReaching the economic development goal\n\nThe slow pace in this sector has made a significant impact on economic development. However, between the public, private sectors and DBSA, a lot of work is being put into place to ensure that there are notable improvements and movements in the education infrastructure area. This, in conjunction with the skills and development initiatives, will help the country achieve its educational goals and add to the economic development of our country.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/activities/health-workforce-education-and-training", "page_content": "The Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health and the report of the High-Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth evidence a growing mismatch between supply, need (SDG-based) and demand (ability to employ) resulting in skills and staff shortages, even in high-income countries. Shortages are driven both by the demographic and epidemiological transitions facing countries and by the ambition of UHC and integrated, people-centred service delivery models.\n\n\n\nScaling up and strengthening the quality of health workforce education and training to address the global gap of 18 million health workers, and to support, strengthen and empower the existing health workforce, is a priority in the 2019 multi-agency SDG global action plan and the WHO 13th General Programme of Work.\n\n\n\nThe WHO Secretariat supports countries to review policy options, including regulatory frameworks, management and information systems for human resources for health, and education systems that can meet current and future needs of communities. Socially accountable education models for health professionals will have to be matched by scale-up of technical vocational education and training for other health and social occupations.\n\n\n\nCurrent priorities within the WHO Health Workforce Department include:\n\nThe Global Health Workforce Network Education Hub, coordinated by the WHO Health Workforce Department, brings together a collaboration of networks, agencies, academic institutions and individual experts to work collaboratively towards the development and dissemination of products that facilitate better alignment of student selection, pre-service and in-service education and training with population needs, health systems and health labour markets. The Education Hub is currently focusing on the development of a Global Competency Framework for UHC;\n\nEnsuring the quality and sustainability of the health workforce is essential to the achievement of UHC. The accreditation of educational institutions and the regulation of health worker practice are core mechanisms to ensure health workforce quality and sustainability. Across WHO Member States, regulatory mechanisms and resources are under stress due to the increasing volume and privatization of health professional education; rising importance of previously unregulated occupations; emergence of new occupations; humanitarian crises; accelerating international mobility; as well as escalating patient demand and expectation. At the same time, innovations and reforms in regulation are underway across WHO Member States to strengthen health workforce quality and sustainability. WHO is convening 2-300 stakeholders at a symposium in December to address these issues;\n\nDigital education, if properly designed and implemented, can strengthen health workforce capacity by delivering education to remote areas and enabling continuous learning for health workers. WHO is developing guidelines on digital education for health workforce education and training.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/education/overview", "page_content": "The World Bank\u2019s global education strategy is focused on ensuring learning happens \u2013 for everyone, everywhere. Our vision is to ensure that everyone can achieve her or his full potential with access to a quality education and lifelong learning. We envision a world in which all countries prepare all their children and youth to succeed as citizens and have the tools to participate in their country\u2019s development.\n\nBy 2030, our target is to halve Learning Poverty \u2013 the share of 10-year-old children around the world who cannot read and understand a simple text. We are working toward the target by helping countries build foundational skills like literacy, numeracy, and socioemotional skills \u2013 the building blocks for all other learning. Throughout all education levels \u2013 from early childhood to tertiary education and beyond \u2013 we help children and youth acquire the skills they need to thrive in school, the labor market and throughout their lives.\n\nWe work directly with governments, providing technical assistance, loans, and grants. We help countries share and apply innovative solutions to education challenges, focusing on systemic reform throughout the education cycle.\n\nWorld Bank support to countries covers the entire learning cycle to support resilient, equitable, and inclusive education systems that ensure learning happens for everyone. We do this by generating and disseminating evidence, ensuring alignment with policymaking processes, and bridging the gap between research and practice.\n\nThe World Bank is the largest source of external financing for education in developing countries, with a portfolio of about $24 billion in 95 countries, including IBRD, IDA and Recipient-Executed Trust Funds. IDA operations comprise about 60% of the education portfolio. In the last three fiscal years (FY 20-22), our lending for education has doubled compared to the preceding 10 years.\n\nOur portfolio encompasses the whole learning cycle. The investment in early childhood education has increased dramatically and now accounts for 11% of our portfolio. About 25% of our portfolio is in FCV settings.\n\nWorld Bank projects reach at least 432 million students and 18 million teachers \u2013 one-third of students and nearly a quarter of teachers in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nWe are also the largest implementing agency of the Global Partnership for Education\u2019s (GPE) grants for low-income countries, managing 55% of GPE\u2019s portfolio at the country level ($1.9 billion).\n\nStrategic Approach to Education\n\nOur vision for the future is that learning should happen with joy, purpose, and rigor for everyone, everywhere. This vision should guide today\u2019s investments and policy reforms so that countries can lay the foundations for effective, equitable, and resilient education systems.\n\nTo guide our policy advisory and operational support to countries, we focus on policy actions that are needed to accelerate learning and that characterize the way many successful systems operate. These are presented within five interrelated pillars of a well-functioning education system that underpin the World Bank\u2019s education policy approach: learners, teachers, learning resources, schools, and system management.\n\nLearners are prepared and motivated to learn; Teachers at all levels are effective and valued; Classrooms are equipped for learning; Schools are safe and inclusive spaces; and Education systems are well managed.\n\nOur Principles\n\nTackling the Global Learning Crisis and the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nEven before COVID-19, the world was facing a learning and skills crisis. COVID-19 deepened this crisis. School closures have led to huge learning losses, and without urgent policy action, today\u2019s students could lose 10% of their future average annual earnings. Beyond reduced incomes, learning losses will lead to lower productivity, greater inequality, and increased risks of social unrest for decades to come. These trends can be reversed if countries act quickly, decisively, and with adequate resources, guided by evidence on what works.\n\nThe World Bank responded to the pandemic immediately, ramping up its support to countries through a variety of different channels and on different priority interventions.\n\nOur operational and policy support is not just responding to the crisis, but is building forward better so that systems use this window of opportunity to shape more resilient systems that are better prepared to cope with future shocks, as well as more equitable systems that ensure opportunities for all. Our operations are helping countries re-enroll and retain students in school, measure learning losses, and implement evidence-based pedagogical approaches for accelerating learning, including targeted instruction and self-guided learning.\n\nLaying the groundwork for the future, now\n\nThe predicted increase in Learning Poverty is a simulation, not a forecast. Learning losses can be minimized if urgent action is taken now.\n\nCountry challenges vary, but there is a menu of options to build forward better, more resilient, and equitable education systems.\n\nCountries are facing an education crisis that requires a two-pronged approach: first, confronting the emergency and supporting actions to recover lost time through remedial and accelerated learning; and, second, building on these investments for a more equitable, resilient, and effective system.\n\nRecovering from the learning crisis must be a political priority, backed with adequate financing and the resolve to implement needed reforms. Domestic financing for education over the last two years has not kept pace with the need to recover and accelerate learning. Across low- and lower-middle-income countries, the average share of education in government budgets fell during the pandemic, and in 2022 it remained below 2019 levels.\n\nThe best chance for a better future is to invest in education and make sure each dollar is put toward improving learning. In a time of fiscal pressure, protecting spending that yields long-run gains \u2013 like spending on education \u2013 will maximize impact.\n\nEvidence-based policy responses at scale are crucial to recover and accelerate learning. The RAPID framework for learning recovery can provide this approach. Its five elements are focused on ensuring that all children and youth are in school and building the foundational skills that they will need for success in school and beyond:\n\nR each every child and keep them in school\n\neach every child and keep them in school A ssess learning levels regularly\n\nssess learning levels regularly P rioritize teaching the fundamentals\n\nrioritize teaching the fundamentals I ncrease the efficiency of instruction including through catch-up learning\n\nncrease the efficiency of instruction including through catch-up learning Develop psychosocial health and well-being\n\nWithout prompt action, there is a serious risk that the learning losses suffered during the pandemic could become permanent. But countries that adopt these five elements \u2013 tailored to their own contexts \u2013 can quickly make up the losses.\n\nEducation technology can be a powerful tool to implement these actions by supporting teachers, children, principals, and parents; expanding accessible digital learning platforms, including radio/TV/Online learning resources (which is here to stay); and using data to identify and help at-risk children, personalize learning, and improve service delivery.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nWe must seize this opportunity to reimagine education in bold ways. The World Bank is committed to supporting countries during these challenging times. Together, we can build forward better more equitable, effective, and resilient education systems for the world\u2019s children and youth. We not only owe it to them \u2013 in their minds rest our future.\n\nGlobal Initiatives\n\nAt the global level, the World Bank promotes cross-regional and cross-sectoral knowledge; fosters in-depth technical knowledge and teams of experts through Global Solutions Groups and Thematic Groups; and incubates ideas, programs, and partnerships \u2013 including with multilateral, bilateral, foundations and with civil society organizations (CSOs) \u2013 in strategic areas of knowledge, advisory, and operational support.\n\nAccelerating Improvements:\n\nSupporting countries in establishing time-bound learning targets and a focused education investment plan, outlining actions and investments geared to achieve these goals.\n\nLaunched in 2020, the Accelerator Program works with a set of \u2018Accelerator\u2019 countries to channel investments in education and to learn from each other. The program coordinates efforts across partners to ensure that the countries in the program show improvements in foundational skills at scale over the next three to five years. These investment plans build on the collective work of multiple partners, and leverage the latest evidence on what works, and how best to plan for implementation.\n\nUniversalizing Foundational Literacy:\n\nReadying children for the future by supporting acquisition of foundational skills \u2013 the most fundamental of which is literacy \u2013 which are the gateway to other skills and subjects.\n\nThe Literacy Policy Package (LPP) includes near-term interventions of the education approach that successful countries have followed to help all children in classrooms become literate today. These include assuring political and technical commitment to making all children literate; ensuring effective literacy instruction by supporting teachers; providing quality, age-appropriate books; teaching children first in the language they speak and understand best; and fostering children\u2019s oral language abilities and love of books and reading.\n\nStrengthening Measurement Systems:\n\nEnabling countries to gather and evaluate information on learning and its drivers more efficiently and effectively.\n\nThe World Bank supports initiatives to help countries effectively build and strengthen their measurement systems to facilitate evidence-based decision-making. Examples of this work include:\n\n(1) The Global Education Policy Dashboard (GEPD): developed by the World Bank\u2019s Education Global Practice, can help countries reduce Learning Poverty. This tool offers a strong basis for identifying priorities for investment and policy reforms that are suited to each country context by focusing on the three dimensions of practices, policies, and politics. GEPD:\n\nHighlights gaps between what the evidence suggests is effective in promoting learning and what is happening in practice in each system; Allows governments to track progress as they act to close the gaps.\n\nThe GEPD has been implemented in seven education systems \u2013 Ethiopia, Jordan, Madagascar, Niger, Peru, Sierra Leone and Rwanda \u2013 and preparation is ongoing in eight more countries with expected completion by the end of 2024.\n\n(2) Learning Assessment Platform (LeAP): a one-stop shop for knowledge, capacity-building tools, support for policy dialogue, and technical staff expertise to aid those working toward better assessment for better learning. LeAP is currently supported by the Russia Education Aid for Development (READ) Trust Fund program.\n\nBuilding & Synthesizing Evidence:\n\nFilling gaps on what works to improve learning and drawing out lessons to inform policy and implementation.\n\nGlobal Education Evidence Advisory Panel (GEEAP): The GEEAP, co-convened by the World Bank, the UK\u2019s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, and UNICEF Office of Research-Innocenti, brings together a diverse group of leading researchers and practitioners to provide guidance for policymakers. It is chaired by Professor Kwame Akyeampong of The Open University and Dr. Rukmini Banerji, CEO of Pratham.\n\nThe first GEEAP report focused on cost-effective policies to improve education access and foundational learning;\n\nThe second report offers guidance on how to reverse the devastating learning losses caused by the pandemic.\n\nStrategic Impact Evaluation Fund (SIEF): In the past five years, the SIEF, a multi-donor trust fund focused on building evidence in the human development sectors, has supported 45 randomized control trials (with total funding of nearly US$20 million) that test out different approaches for improving education outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. To ensure the findings make a difference, SIEF has also invested in disseminating this evidence and building capacity of government staff, local researchers, and local journalists to help them critically appraise education evidence.\n\nSupporting Successful Teachers:\n\nHelping systems develop the right selection, incentives, and support to the professional development of teachers.\n\nThe Global Platform for Successful Teachers has two main instruments: global public goods that support the implementation of the key principles, and operations that accompany governments in implementing successful teacher policies. Currently, the World Bank Education Global Practice has over 100 active projects supporting over 18 million teachers worldwide, about a third of the teacher population in low- and middle-income countries. In 12 countries alone, these projects cover 16 million teachers, including all primary school teachers in Ethiopia and Turkey, and over 80% in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Vietnam. Two examples of Global Public Goods created as part of the Platform are:\n\nTeach: A World Bank-developed classroom observation tool designed to capture the quality of teaching in low- and middle-income countries, which is available in 12 languages. Since Teach launched in 2019, it has been applied in 36 countries, reaching almost 200,000 students.\n\nCoach: The World Bank\u2019s program focused on accelerating student learning by improving in-service teacher professional development (TPD) around the world. While Teach helps identify teachers\u2019 professional development needs, Coach leverages these insights to support teachers to improve their teaching.\n\nSupporting Education Finance Systems:\n\nStrengthening country financing systems to mobilize more resources and improve the equity and efficiency of sector spending.\n\nThe Global Education Finance Platform (GEFP) aims to support the strengthening of country financing systems to mobilize more resources and improve the equity and efficiency of education spending, by bringing together various partners to work on the development of sustainable financing strategies, better public financial management and stronger data and monitoring systems for education financing.\n\nOur Work in Fragile, Conflict, and Violent (FCV) Contexts:\n\nThe massive and growing global challenge of having so many children living in conflict and violent situations requires a response at the same scale and scope. Our education engagement in the Fragility, Conflict and Violence (FCV) context, which stands at US$5.35 billion, has grown rapidly in recent years, reflecting the ever-increasing importance of the FCV agenda in education. Indeed, these projects now account for more than 25% of the World Bank education portfolio of US$23.6 billion.\n\nAs our support continues to grow to face the more numerous and longer-lasting crises (including those induced by climate emergencies), investments will be guided by our recent White Paper. The paper states that education is especially crucial to minimizing the effects of fragility and displacement on the welfare of youth and children in the short-term and preventing the emergence of violent conflict in the long-term. It outlines our proposed way forward for keeping children safe and learning in these most difficult contexts, following the pillars of the WBG Strategy for Fragility, Conflict, and Violence.\n\nLast Updated: Apr 11, 2023"}, {"url": "https://victordahdalehfoundation.com/", "page_content": "THE VICTOR DAHDALEH FOUNDATION IS A GLOBAL CHARITABLE ORGANISATION FOCUSED ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.\n\nFounded by Canadian businessman and philanthropist Victor Dahdaleh, the Victor Dahdaleh Foundation supports education, health and social development programmes around the world, taking an active role in the initiatives it funds.
