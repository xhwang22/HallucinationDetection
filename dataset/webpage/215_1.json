Kleine labored over \u201cPhyllis and Harold\u2019\u2019 for a dozen years, knowing it could not be released until after her father\u2019s death (he died suddenly in 2003) since it reveals a family secret that she felt would have been too painful for him to see. Unlike the rapport and shared interests so evident between Kleine and Gregory, Phyllis and Harold seemed to exist as strangers in separate marriages. He was a hard-working dentist who escaped the poverty of New York\u2019s Lower East Side and thought his wife a \u201cwonderful woman.\u2019\u2019 She was a fashionable beauty and a frustrated artist who felt she\u2019d married the wrong man for the wrong reasons. The irony, Gregory points out, is that Harold\u2019s prolific home movies and thoughtful photographs reveal \u201ca creative man\u2019\u2019 who may have been more interesting than the \u201cvulgar dentist\u2019\u2019 his unhappy wife perceived.\n\n\u201cI saw \u2018 \u2019Til Death Do Us Part\u2019 as a blur because we were making out in the editing room,\u2019\u2019 laughs Gregory, sipping tea with Kleine in their Truro home (they divide their time between New York City and Cape Cod). Surrounded by wildflowers, the house is spacious but understated: books line the walls, a litter box sits in the hall. (\u201cI don\u2019t have kids; I have cats,\u2019\u2019 says Kleine. Gregory has a grown son from his first marriage.) The couple talk about what movie they\u2019ll see over the weekend \u2014 perhaps Tilda Swinton\u2019s \u201cI Am Love,\u2019\u2019 a recent favorite that begs to be revisited on a bigger screen. Angular and full of easy charm at age 76, Gregory excuses himself to prepare for a phone call from friend and frequent collaborator Wallace Shawn; he\u2019s planning to direct three of Shawn\u2019s plays at New York\u2019s Public Theater next year. Kleine, 52, seems the more reserved of the pair, but she\u2019s engaging and animated when talking about the labor of love that was \u201cPhyllis and Harold.\u2019\u2019\n\nKleine has been married for 12 years to director, playwright, and actor Andre Gregory, who produced the film (the pair will engage in a post-screening discussion with the audience July 25 at 3 p.m.). Her parents have hovered over the relationship from the start. Gregory recalls that when they met, Kleine was finishing \u201c \u2019Til Death Do Us Part,\u2019\u2019 her 1998 short film about her parents that served as a precursor to \u201cPhyllis and Harold.\u2019\u2019\n\nPerhaps her own happy marriage provided filmmaker Cindy Kleine with the prism through which to view her parents\u2019 \u201chideous\u2019\u2019 one. That\u2019s Kleine\u2019s description of the late Phyllis and Harold Kleine\u2019s 59-year union, one that she\u2019s chronicled with journalistic inquisitiveness and no small dose of humor in the documentary \u201cPhyllis and Harold\u2019\u2019 (it opens Friday at the Coolidge Corner Theatre). As Kleine digs beneath the fa\u00e7ade of her middle class, Jewish, Long Island upbringing to reveal deceit, delusion, and denial, \u201cPhyllis and Harold\u2019\u2019 plays like Ingmar Bergman\u2019s \u201cScenes From a Marriage\u2019\u2019 starring Tennessee Williams-esque characters.\n\n\u201cPhyllis and Harold\u2019\u2019 fits in with a spate of recent documentaries such as \u201c51 Birch Street,\u2019\u2019 \u201cMust Read After My Death,\u2019\u2019 \u201cCapturing the Friedmans,\u2019\u2019 and \u201cCrazy Love\u2019\u2019 that probe the darker side of post-World War II suburban, middle-class families. For a generation of filmmakers now hitting middle age, it should be no surprise that they would look close to home, at ordinary lives that often hid extraordinary family secrets. It\u2019s also a generation that\u2019s fast disappearing.\n\n\u201cThey are all gone,\u2019\u2019 says Kleine of her parents and their peers. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t told it, no one would know their story. I am endlessly fascinated by the mystery of life \u2014 the hope of youth; then you are old and dead in the blink of an eye.\u2019\u2019 Her film uses her father\u2019s photographs and home movies, on-camera commentary by Kleine herself, and interviews with Kleine\u2019s older sister, Erica \u201cRicky\u2019\u2019 Kleine. As with many dysfunctional families, Kleine points out that Ricky\u2019s perspective on their childhood is quite different from her own. The sisters were not close as children, but as they matured, and through the filmmaking process, they forged a bond. \u201cWe remember different parents. But she loves the film,\u2019\u2019 says Cindy Kleine. \u201cI think it helped her; it objectified the situation so now we can laugh at it.\u2019\u2019\n\nFor Gregory, who confesses to seeing his wife\u2019s film \u201c70 or 80 times,\u2019\u2019 the personal story speaks to a generation of marriages. \u201cI love the way it depicts many couples of that generation, where the women married men for security \u2014 there were not many alternatives \u2014 and then felt trapped and lived in contempt of these men,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u201cBeing older myself, I am also deeply moved by the pathos of these young people becoming old, the changing geography of the face. Having had a mother and a father who were raging narcissists, I was fascinated by Phyllis\u2019s narcissism and her willingness to spill the beans.\u2019\u2019\n\nFor Kleine, delving into the personal for raw material is how she learned filmmaking. She studied with influential documentary film pioneer Richard Leacock and Glorianna Davenport, cofounder of the MIT Media Lab, during the heyday of the now defunct MIT Film/Video Section in the late 1970s. Kleine, who eventually earned her BFA from Tufts University, was a student at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts when she began taking film classes at MIT in an exchange program. \u201cI holed up there and spent a lot of time. I remember a two-week documentary workshop with Robert Frank \u2014 I never knew he made films. It was an amazing time and an amazing community.\u2019\u2019 Besides Davenport and Leacock, Kleine credits instructor John Gianvito, who would go on to program the Harvard Film Archive and direct several acclaimed films, with influencing a generation of film students. \u201cHis film history courses exposed me to European cinema, especially the work of [Russian director Andrei] Tarkovsky,\u2019\u2019 she says.\n\nThe story of her parents\u2019 marriage may be behind her, but Kleine is about to tackle another film memoir, this time collaborating with her husband. The couple just returned from Gregory\u2019s hometown of Los Angeles where they shot footage for a documentary about Gregory\u2019s family and its influence on his life and work.\n\n\u201cI have no problem talking, as you might have gathered,\u2019\u2019 says Gregory, whose musings across a table with Wally Shawn turned \u201cMy Dinner With Andre\u2019\u2019 into an unlikely indie smash in 1981. \u201cI love examining personal relationships even when it\u2019s in public.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cAndre lights up when the camera goes on,\u2019\u2019 adds Kleine.\n\n\u201cPhyllis and Harold\u2019\u2019 hit the festival circuit after a successful screening as part of the Boston Jewish Film Festival in November 2008. That led to international bookings and a recent DVD release. But for Kleine, the success is bittersweet. Phyllis Kleine died in 2006 and never saw the film\u2019s final cut.\n\n\u201cEvery time I go to an opening and see the title on the marquee, I think how much my mother would have loved it. The film is critical of her, but she wouldn\u2019t see it that way at all,\u2019\u2019 says Kleine. \u201cShe would see it as a homage; she\u2019d be thrilled people were paying such close attention to her.\u2019\u2019\n\nLoren King can be reached at loren.king@comcast.net.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company."}, {"url": "https://www.wbur.org/news/2013/08/01/andre-gregory-kleine", "page_content": "Fifteen years ago filmmaker Cindy Kleine fell in love with Andr\u00e9 Gregory, a legendary theater director known more for co-writing and playing a version of himself in 1981\u2019s conversational film drama \u201cMy Dinner With Andr\u00e9.\u201d (Other moviegoers might associate him more for getting his eye gouged out in the 1993 blockbuster, \u201cDemolition Man.\u201d)\n\nWhen Kleine and Gregory married she was 39 and he was 63. Over time the age gap became more palpable and stirred her documentarian\u2019s impulse to freeze time. Part love letter (that occasionally borders on too intimate) and part artist portrait, Kleine\u2019s documentary, \u201cAndr\u00e9 Gregory: Before and After Dinner,\u201d opens today at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and runs through Aug. 9. Kleine and Gregory will be present at tonight\u2019s 7:30 screening to answer questions.\n\nFrom \"Andr\u00e9 Gregory: Before And After Dinner.\" (Courtesy, Cinema Guild)\n\nKleine, who narrates, sets a convivial pace and tone, best illustrated during a scene when she catalogs the 18 boyfriends who preceded Gregory. Photographs of each man flips by as Kleine lists, \u201cJonathan, Rob, Fernando, Rob ...\u201d How did she manage such thorough record-keeping pre-Instagram? And so few clothes!\n\nKleine studied filmmaking at The Museum School and at MIT under Richard Leacock, who knew a thing or two about personal documentaries. Her last documentary, \u201cPhyllis and Harold,\u201d held a microscope to her parents\u2019 59-year marriage. (It premiered in Boston as part of the Boston Jewish Film Festival and this run is also co-presented by BJFF.)\n\nHere, the marriage is unquestionably strong. Kleine pokes fun at Gregory\u2019s close friendship and life-long collaboration with actor/writer Wallace Shawn, who appears frequently in \u201cBefore and After Dinner\u201d and was his foil in \u201cMy Dinner With Andr\u00e9.\u201d And Gregory calls this friendship his \u201csecond marriage,\u201d but it\u2019s lighthearted. Kleine is yang to Gregory\u2019s yin. In his youth he was never hugged, he says. In her family, \u201cfighting was the primary means of communication and everyone talked at once.\u201d\n\nKleine steps into the background and devotes the second part of the film to Gregory, with fascinating footage from his formative days in experimental theater (the Richard Avedon stills from \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland\u201d are a knock-out) and a peppering of Gregory\u2019s theatrical wisdom and anecdotes told to wide-eyed, nodding listeners.\n\nIn one scene Gregory spins a delicate yarn about his first kiss, which just happened to take place in a moonlit, Marblehead, Mass. cemetery. His knees buckled and he fainted. In another, he recalls a moment of hysterical blindness.\n\nThough both are Jewish, Gregory\u2019s parents maintained a severely tight lip in this regard and the nature of his father\u2019s relationship to the highest ranks of Nazi leadership continues to plague him and occupies a major thread of this film. Yet, as compelling as it to delve into the underpinnings of Gregory\u2019s artistic drive, which he attributes to his terrifying father, the most gripping moments come while he\u2019s directing Ibsen\u2019s \u201cThe Master Builder\u201d in his living room.\n\nWhat sets him apart as director, we learn, is his willingness to take the time that a production needs \u2014 he rehearsed \u201cThe Master Builder\u201d for 14 years, for example. His obsession with \"Uncle Vanya\" was documented in \"Vanya on 42nd Street\" by Louis Malle, who also filmed \"My Dinner with Andr\u00e9.\" Gregory also has an incorrigible trust in the actors he chooses. \u201cI never audition an actor I only interview them,\u201d he says.\n\nThere\u2019s a discomfort at first with how long shots linger on Gregory\u2019s intense, piercing gaze while actors deliver their lines off camera. An hour or so into this film, convinced of his portrait as a bottomless well of artistic chutzpah and encouragement, we are desperate to watch only his reactions. The act of directing, or life itself, is manifest in every line of his face.\n\nErin Trahan edits the online film magazine The Independent and moderates the current season of The DocYard. you can reach her at erin@erintrahan.net."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/19/movies/19phyllis.html", "page_content": "Whenever the filmmaker Cindy Kleine pondered her parents\u2019 quarrelsome, 59-year marriage, her most frequent thought was, \u201cWhat are they doing together?\u201d Hoping that movie audiences would be equally inquisitive, Ms. Kleine embarked on a 12-year journey through photographs and home movies, love letters and long-kept secrets to produce \u201cPhyllis and Harold,\u201d an impossibly self-involved portrait of a union far more commonplace than its offspring seem to believe.\n\nOnly when interviewing her parents separately in their Long Island home and eliciting wildly different descriptions of the early years of their marriage (\u201cI was always angry.\u201d \u201cThat was a wonderful time in my life.\u201d), does Ms. Kleine briefly tap into something \u0097 a rhythm, a device that would have given her story form.

Inside Out is truly a world of lunatics, lovers, and dreamers.\n\nview clip \u2192\n\n\n\n\u2190 previous film | next film \u2192\n\n\u2190 main film page"}, {"url": "https://www.huffpost.com/author/cindy-kleine", "page_content": "Cindy Kleine is a film and video artist whose prolific career began when she was an undergraduate at The Museum School and at the legendary (and long-gone) MIT Film/Video Section, studying with Richard Leacock and Ed Pincus, and among a legion of future filmmakers in the program, including Ross McElwee, Robb Moss and John Gianvito.

A witty and often hilariously funny raconteur, Gregory looks back on a career that spanned decades, shattered boundaries and established him as a cultural icon. He recalls the making of My Dinner With Andr\u00e9, the Louis Malle-directed classic in which he starred and co-wrote, reflects on his pivotal role in American theatre, dishes on his brief sojourn in Hollywood, and talks about the discovery that led him to question his own identity and life's work. Bringing us back and forth in time, Gregory looks not only at his life, but at the nature of art, love and the creative process. Directed by award-winning filmmaker Cindy Kleine (who is also his wife), Andr\u00e9 Gregory: Before and After Dinner is a brilliant portrait of a modern renaissance man.\n\nBefore And After Dinner opened at Film Forum in New York and The Music Hall in Los Angeles, followed by runs in Chicago, Portland, Boston, Santa Fe, San Francisco, Cleveland, Seattle, Detroit and Toronto.

Over time the age gap became more palpable and stirred her documentarian\u2019s impulse to freeze time. Part love letter (that occasionally borders on too intimate) and part artist portrait, Kleine\u2019s documentary, \u201cAndr\u00e9 Gregory: Before and After Dinner,\u201d opens today at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and runs through Aug. 9. Kleine and Gregory will be present at tonight\u2019s 7:30 screening to answer questions.\n\nFrom \"Andr\u00e9 Gregory: Before And After Dinner.\" (Courtesy, Cinema Guild)\n\nKleine, who narrates, sets a convivial pace and tone, best illustrated during a scene when she catalogs the 18 boyfriends who preceded Gregory. Photographs of each man flips by as Kleine lists, \u201cJonathan, Rob, Fernando, Rob ...\u201d How did she manage such thorough record-keeping pre-Instagram? And so few clothes!\n\nKleine studied filmmaking at The Museum School and at MIT under Richard Leacock, who knew a thing or two about personal documentaries. Her last documentary, \u201cPhyllis and Harold,\u201d held a microscope to her parents\u2019 59-year marriage. (It premiered in Boston as part of the Boston Jewish Film Festival and this run is also co-presented by BJFF.)\n\nHere, the marriage is unquestionably strong. Kleine pokes fun at Gregory\u2019s close friendship and life-long collaboration with actor/writer Wallace Shawn, who appears frequently in \u201cBefore and After Dinner\u201d and was his foil in \u201cMy Dinner With Andr\u00e9.\u201d And Gregory calls this friendship his \u201csecond marriage,\u201d but it\u2019s lighthearted. Kleine is yang to Gregory\u2019s yin. In his youth he was never hugged, he says. In her family, \u201cfighting was the primary means of communication and everyone talked at once.\u201d\n\nKleine steps into the background and devotes the second part of the film to Gregory, with fascinating footage from his formative days in experimental theater (the Richard Avedon stills from \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland\u201d are a knock-out) and a peppering of Gregory\u2019s theatrical wisdom and anecdotes told to wide-eyed, nodding listeners.\n\nIn one scene Gregory spins a delicate yarn about his first kiss, which just happened to take place in a moonlit, Marblehead, Mass. cemetery. His knees buckled and he fainted. In another, he recalls a moment of hysterical blindness.\n\nThough both are Jewish, Gregory\u2019s parents maintained a severely tight lip in this regard and the nature of his father\u2019s relationship to the highest ranks of Nazi leadership continues to plague him and occupies a major thread of this film. Yet, as compelling as it to delve into the underpinnings of Gregory\u2019s artistic drive, which he attributes to his terrifying father, the most gripping moments come while he\u2019s directing Ibsen\u2019s \u201cThe Master Builder\u201d in his living room.\n\nWhat sets him apart as director, we learn, is his willingness to take the time that a production needs \u2014 he rehearsed \u201cThe Master Builder\u201d for 14 years, for example. His obsession with \"Uncle Vanya\" was documented in \"Vanya on 42nd Street\" by Louis Malle, who also filmed \"My Dinner with Andr\u00e9.\" Gregory also has an incorrigible trust in the actors he chooses. \u201cI never audition an actor I only interview them,\u201d he says.\n\nThere\u2019s a discomfort at first with how long shots linger on Gregory\u2019s intense, piercing gaze while actors deliver their lines off camera. An hour or so into this film, convinced of his portrait as a bottomless well of artistic chutzpah and encouragement, we are desperate to watch only his reactions. The act of directing, or life itself, is manifest in every line of his face.\n\nErin Trahan edits the online film magazine The Independent and moderates the current season of The DocYard. you can reach her at erin@erintrahan.net."}, {"url": "https://cindykleine.com/films/secrets.html", "page_content": "SECRETS OF CINDY\n\n1983, 15 MINS\n\nSecrets of Cindy | Kleine\u2019s first videotape, produced as a Museum School student, won First Prize at the American Film Institute\u2019s Student Video Competition.

Utilizing old photographs, long-forgotten early love letters between her folks, and fairly recent interviews with the two of them, Kleine weaves a sadly uneventful narrative of Mr. and Mrs. Kleine\u2019s sham of a marriage. Phyllis and Harold, who were married in the early 1940s and stayed together until Harold\u2019s death in the past decade, seem at first like an average Long Island couple, but hiding beneath the mundane surface of their life together is an ultimately banal secret of on-again-off-again marital infidelity. The way in which the director covers this central theme, which is the essential raison d\u2019\u00eatre for the film, is one-sided and draws the supposed impartiality of her work into question.\n\nThe single most intriguing facet of Phyllis and Harold is how Kleine\u2019s mother remembers certain key events in her life differently in her various interviews. This could have sparked an exploration of the nature of memory and how our emotions color our reflections of the past. However, the director glosses over the significance of Phyllis\u2019 divergent remembrances and regrets, leaving out the one thing that would have made Phyllis and Harold more interesting than discovering a pedestrian home movie shot by a family you never knew. We find out soon enough that, according to Phyllis, she never really loved Harold. Of course, this begs the question as to why she sent him so many heartfelt and sentimental letters during his military service before their nuptials and the start of his rather successful career as a dentist.\n\nIn beautiful and floridly written missives, Phyllis pours her heart out to Harold, telling him she cannot live without him and how deeply she misses him, etc. The problem is that during this period of intense letter-writing, Phyllis began a relationship with her boss in Manhattan, an affair that would continue for nearly five years after her marriage to Harold. In tear-filled interviews, Phyllis explains to her daughter Cindy how awful it was to have sex with Harold and how disgusted by him she became during her whirlwind romance with a man who continually refused to leave his wife for her. Phyllis, if her own words are any indication, has led a life of bad faith and shows a vicious contempt for the man who supported her throughout her adult life.\n\nIn the end, Kleine explains how proud of her mother she is for pursuing a difficult affair, hiding significant parts of her life from her husband, and refusing to be pigeonholed into the role of devoted mother, even though this led to serious problems of detachment and disillusionment in her two daughters. Kleine never gives us a sufficient reason to congratulate her mother for the betrayal of her husband and neglect of their children.\n\nThrough Kleine\u2019s interviews with her father, which are sparing and somewhat forced throughout the film, we are given a glimpse into the life of a completely oblivious cuckold. Harold comes across as a boring yet stable individual, who despite his reticence and curmudgeonly ways still managed to take his wife on vacations all over the world for the duration of their 50+ year marriage. We are never given a compelling reason why Kleine sees her mother\u2019s infidelity as an authentic way of taking power back from the patriarchy. He\u2019s no monster, after all. The fact that Phyllis probably never should have gotten married or had children isn\u2019t enough of a reason to justify making a feature-length documentary about her."}, {"url": "http://archive.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2010/07/18/her_documentary_is_a_family_drama_in_the_truest_sense/", "page_content": "It was Gregory who encouraged Kleine to submit \u201c \u2019Til Death Do Us Part\u2019\u2019 to film festivals and, after some success, urged her to expand it into a feature. Kleine labored over \u201cPhyllis and Harold\u2019\u2019 for a dozen years, knowing it could not be released until after her father\u2019s death (he died suddenly in 2003) since it reveals a family secret that she felt would have been too painful for him to see. Unlike the rapport and shared interests so evident between Kleine and Gregory, Phyllis and Harold seemed to exist as strangers in separate marriages. He was a hard-working dentist who escaped the poverty of New York\u2019s Lower East Side and thought his wife a \u201cwonderful woman.\u2019\u2019 She was a fashionable beauty and a frustrated artist who felt she\u2019d married the wrong man for the wrong reasons. The irony, Gregory points out, is that Harold\u2019s prolific home movies and thoughtful photographs reveal \u201ca creative man\u2019\u2019 who may have been more interesting than the \u201cvulgar dentist\u2019\u2019 his unhappy wife perceived.\n\n\u201cI saw \u2018 \u2019Til Death Do Us Part\u2019 as a blur because we were making out in the editing room,\u2019\u2019 laughs Gregory, sipping tea with Kleine in their Truro home (they divide their time between New York City and Cape Cod).

The couple talk about what movie they\u2019ll see over the weekend \u2014 perhaps Tilda Swinton\u2019s \u201cI Am Love,\u2019\u2019 a recent favorite that begs to be revisited on a bigger screen.

Kleine, 52, seems the more reserved of the pair, but she\u2019s engaging and animated when talking about the labor of love that was \u201cPhyllis and Harold.\u2019\u2019\n\nKleine has been married for 12 years to director, playwright, and actor Andre Gregory, who produced the film (the pair will engage in a post-screening discussion with the audience July 25 at 3 p.m.). Her parents have hovered over the relationship from the start. Gregory recalls that when they met, Kleine was finishing \u201c \u2019Til Death Do Us Part,\u2019\u2019 her 1998 short film about her parents that served as a precursor to \u201cPhyllis and Harold.\u2019\u2019\n\nPerhaps her own happy marriage provided filmmaker Cindy Kleine with the prism through which to view her parents\u2019 \u201chideous\u2019\u2019 one. That\u2019s Kleine\u2019s description of the late Phyllis and Harold Kleine\u2019s 59-year union, one that she\u2019s chronicled with journalistic inquisitiveness and no small dose of humor in the documentary \u201cPhyllis and Harold\u2019\u2019 (it opens Friday at the Coolidge Corner Theatre). As Kleine digs beneath the fa\u00e7ade of her middle class, Jewish, Long Island upbringing to reveal deceit, delusion, and denial, \u201cPhyllis and Harold\u2019\u2019 plays like Ingmar Bergman\u2019s \u201cScenes From a Marriage\u2019\u2019 starring Tennessee Williams-esque characters.\n\n\u201cPhyllis and Harold\u2019\u2019 fits in with a spate of recent documentaries such as \u201c51 Birch Street,\u2019\u2019 \u201cMust Read After My Death,\u2019\u2019 \u201cCapturing the Friedmans,\u2019\u2019 and \u201cCrazy Love\u2019\u2019 that probe the darker side of post-World War II suburban, middle-class families. For a generation of filmmakers now hitting middle age, it should be no surprise that they would look close to home, at ordinary lives that often hid extraordinary family secrets. It\u2019s also a generation that\u2019s fast disappearing.\n\n\u201cThey are all gone,\u2019\u2019 says Kleine of her parents and their peers. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t told it, no one would know their story. I am endlessly fascinated by the mystery of life \u2014 the hope of youth; then you are old and dead in the blink of an eye.\u2019\u2019 Her film uses her father\u2019s photographs and home movies, on-camera commentary by Kleine herself, and interviews with Kleine\u2019s older sister, Erica \u201cRicky\u2019\u2019 Kleine. As with many dysfunctional families, Kleine points out that Ricky\u2019s perspective on their childhood is quite different from her own. The sisters were not close as children, but as they matured, and through the filmmaking process, they forged a bond. \u201cWe remember different parents. But she loves the film,\u2019\u2019 says Cindy Kleine. \u201cI think it helped her; it objectified the situation so now we can laugh at it.\u2019\u2019\n\nFor Gregory, who confesses to seeing his wife\u2019s film \u201c70 or 80 times,\u2019\u2019 the personal story speaks to a generation of marriages. \u201cI love the way it depicts many couples of that generation, where the women married men for security \u2014 there were not many alternatives \u2014 and then felt trapped and lived in contempt of these men,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u201cBeing older myself, I am also deeply moved by the pathos of these young people becoming old, the changing geography of the face. Having had a mother and a father who were raging narcissists, I was fascinated by Phyllis\u2019s narcissism and her willingness to spill the beans.\u2019\u2019\n\nFor Kleine, delving into the personal for raw material is how she learned filmmaking. She studied with influential documentary film pioneer Richard Leacock and Glorianna Davenport, cofounder of the MIT Media Lab, during the heyday of the now defunct MIT Film/Video Section in the late 1970s. Kleine, who eventually earned her BFA from Tufts University, was a student at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts when she began taking film classes at MIT in an exchange program. \u201cI holed up there and spent a lot of time. I remember a two-week documentary workshop with Robert Frank \u2014 I never knew he made films. It was an amazing time and an amazing community.\u2019\u2019 Besides Davenport and Leacock, Kleine credits instructor John Gianvito, who would go on to program the Harvard Film Archive and direct several acclaimed films, with influencing a generation of film students. \u201cHis film history courses exposed me to European cinema, especially the work of [Russian director Andrei] Tarkovsky,\u2019\u2019 she says.\n\nThe story of her parents\u2019 marriage may be behind her, but Kleine is about to tackle another film memoir, this time collaborating with her husband. The couple just returned from Gregory\u2019s hometown of Los Angeles where they shot footage for a documentary about Gregory\u2019s family and its influence on his life and work.\n\n\u201cI have no problem talking, as you might have gathered,\u2019\u2019 says Gregory, whose musings across a table with Wally Shawn turned \u201cMy Dinner With Andre\u2019\u2019 into an unlikely indie smash in 1981. \u201cI love examining personal relationships even when it\u2019s in public.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cAndre lights up when the camera goes on,\u2019\u2019 adds Kleine.\n\n\u201cPhyllis and Harold\u2019\u2019 hit the festival circuit after a successful screening as part of the Boston Jewish Film Festival in November 2008. That led to international bookings and a recent DVD release. But for Kleine, the success is bittersweet. Phyllis Kleine died in 2006 and never saw the film\u2019s final cut.\n\n\u201cEvery time I go to an opening and see the title on the marquee, I think how much my mother would have loved it. The film is critical of her, but she wouldn\u2019t see it that way at all,\u2019\u2019 says Kleine. \u201cShe would see it as a homage; she\u2019d be thrilled people were paying such close attention to her.\u2019\u2019\n\nLoren King can be reached at loren.king@comcast.net.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/19/movies/19phyllis.html", "page_content": "Whenever the filmmaker Cindy Kleine pondered her parents\u2019 quarrelsome, 59-year marriage, her most frequent thought was, \u201cWhat are they doing together?\u201d Hoping that movie audiences would be equally inquisitive, Ms. Kleine embarked on a 12-year journey through photographs and home movies, love letters and long-kept secrets to produce \u201cPhyllis and Harold,\u201d an impossibly self-involved portrait of a union far more commonplace than its offspring seem to believe.\n\nOnly when interviewing her parents separately in their Long Island home and eliciting wildly different descriptions of the early years of their marriage (\u201cI was always angry.\u201d \u201cThat was a wonderful time in my life.\u201d), does Ms. Kleine briefly tap into something \u0097 a rhythm, a device that would have given her story form.

Over time the age gap became more palpable and stirred her documentarian\u2019s impulse to freeze time. Part love letter (that occasionally borders on too intimate) and part artist portrait, Kleine\u2019s documentary, \u201cAndr\u00e9 Gregory: Before and After Dinner,\u201d opens today at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and runs through Aug. 9. Kleine and Gregory will be present at tonight\u2019s 7:30 screening to answer questions.\n\nFrom \"Andr\u00e9 Gregory: Before And After Dinner.\" (Courtesy, Cinema Guild)\n\nKleine, who narrates, sets a convivial pace and tone, best illustrated during a scene when she catalogs the 18 boyfriends who preceded Gregory. Photographs of each man flips by as Kleine lists, \u201cJonathan, Rob, Fernando, Rob ...\u201d How did she manage such thorough record-keeping pre-Instagram? And so few clothes!\n\nKleine studied filmmaking at The Museum School and at MIT under Richard Leacock, who knew a thing or two about personal documentaries. Her last documentary, \u201cPhyllis and Harold,\u201d held a microscope to her parents\u2019 59-year marriage. (It premiered in Boston as part of the Boston Jewish Film Festival and this run is also co-presented by BJFF.)\n\nHere, the marriage is unquestionably strong. Kleine pokes fun at Gregory\u2019s close friendship and life-long collaboration with actor/writer Wallace Shawn, who appears frequently in \u201cBefore and After Dinner\u201d and was his foil in \u201cMy Dinner With Andr\u00e9.\u201d And Gregory calls this friendship his \u201csecond marriage,\u201d but it\u2019s lighthearted. Kleine is yang to Gregory\u2019s yin. In his youth he was never hugged, he says. In her family, \u201cfighting was the primary means of communication and everyone talked at once.\u201d\n\nKleine steps into the background and devotes the second part of the film to Gregory, with fascinating footage from his formative days in experimental theater (the Richard Avedon stills from \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland\u201d are a knock-out) and a peppering of Gregory\u2019s theatrical wisdom and anecdotes told to wide-eyed, nodding listeners.\n\nIn one scene Gregory spins a delicate yarn about his first kiss, which just happened to take place in a moonlit, Marblehead, Mass. cemetery. His knees buckled and he fainted. In another, he recalls a moment of hysterical blindness.\n\nThough both are Jewish, Gregory\u2019s parents maintained a severely tight lip in this regard and the nature of his father\u2019s relationship to the highest ranks of Nazi leadership continues to plague him and occupies a major thread of this film. Yet, as compelling as it to delve into the underpinnings of Gregory\u2019s artistic drive, which he attributes to his terrifying father, the most gripping moments come while he\u2019s directing Ibsen\u2019s \u201cThe Master Builder\u201d in his living room.\n\nWhat sets him apart as director, we learn, is his willingness to take the time that a production needs \u2014 he rehearsed \u201cThe Master Builder\u201d for 14 years, for example. His obsession with \"Uncle Vanya\" was documented in \"Vanya on 42nd Street\" by Louis Malle, who also filmed \"My Dinner with Andr\u00e9.\" Gregory also has an incorrigible trust in the actors he chooses. \u201cI never audition an actor I only interview them,\u201d he says.\n\nThere\u2019s a discomfort at first with how long shots linger on Gregory\u2019s intense, piercing gaze while actors deliver their lines off camera. An hour or so into this film, convinced of his portrait as a bottomless well of artistic chutzpah and encouragement, we are desperate to watch only his reactions. The act of directing, or life itself, is manifest in every line of his face.\n\nErin Trahan edits the online film magazine The Independent and moderates the current season of The DocYard. you can reach her at erin@erintrahan.net."}, {"url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/all-about-her-mother-cind_b_469162", "page_content": "To say that director Cindy Kleine spins her search for truth into an art form only begins to describe the new film, Phyllis and Harold, documenting the bewildering marriage of her parents. While father Harold remains a dark and shadowy figure, mother Phyllis is eventually painstakingly and fully fleshed out. The deeper focus and graphic details, which reveal the subtle and sometimes secret aspects of her mother's life, could not be revealed until Harold passed away in 2003. And, I won't spoil the accruing dramatic suspense by being too specific here. Suffice it to say, its impact is powerful and poignant.\n\nThe feelings the film evokes remind one of a first reading of Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique in which essential aspects of one's own mother or grandmother were given credence and revealed as never before. Phyllis and Harold is the perfect companion piece to Friedan's seminal work on the quiet plight of suburban women in the 1940s and 50s, proving once again that life was anything but pure and simple way back when.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike Friedan's book, Cindy Kleine's film has captured something quietly but essentially tragic about many American women who were born in the 1920s and 30s. While this film is a very individual and unique unfolding of Klein's mother Phyllis' deeply complicated, lifelong dilemma, it also strikes notes of universality many will recognize as they recall the lives of the women from the WWII generation in their own families. In choosing duty and loyalty over satisfaction and a greater sense of freedom, these women stayed home, remained trapped, and suffered in silence.\n\nBut a mother's deep unhappiness and yearning for something missing (or in Phyllis' case someone who is missing) -- even when veiled by middle-class props such as a killer wardrobe, a tastefully decorated home, a pool in the back yard, and trips abroad -- seldom go unnoticed by her own children. It's striking to hear Harold recall the story of their 59-year marriage and compare it with Phyllis' recollections and those of her two sensitive and observant daughters.\n\nPhyllis' story is a heartbreaker, but so too is the effect it had on Cindy Kleine and her sister who are also interviewed. They worshipped their mother even though most of the time she was only half there. Kleine's extraordinary empathy and insight into her mother as well as her early exposure to photography which developed her visual sensibilities thanks to her father are the some of the elements that make this film so effective and ring so true. Ironically, the film -- unlike Phyllis' real life -- allows her ultimately to be revealed a whole human being.\n\nPhyllis and Harold. directed, produced, and written by Cindy Kleine. Opens in NYC on February 19, 2010. Limited release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActress Jean Simmons: Leading Lady in Her Final Film\n\nBorn nine years after Phyllis, the actress Jean Simmons shares some things in common with her. Simmons' career flourished through almost three decades before it began to wane in the late 1960s. Her second husband, film director Richard Brooks, sensed this frustration as well as problems with alcohol use and the effects of the increasing invisibility of middle age and an unhappy marriage. He created the film The Happy Ending especially for her. Released in an important and transitional year in Hollywood--1969--it was far from a perfect movie, but Jean Simmons made the most of a role that paralleled her life so closely and was nominated--a second time--for an Academy Award. It's another film that tries to make sense of Friedan's feminine mystique--that awful, nagging sense that something in life is missing.\n\n\n\nJean Simmons (1929-2010).\n\nSimmons always made wildly interesting if not important movies -- whether theatrically released or for television -- in almost every decade following her film debut in 1944 at the age of 15. 1940s: Great Expectations, Hamlet; 1950s: Young Bess, The Actress, Until They Sail; 1960s: Elmer Gantry, Spartacus ;1970s: Mr. Sycamore, Dominique, The Eastern Promise; 1980s: December Flowers, The Thornbirds, (television remake) Great Expectations; 1990s: How to Make an American Quilt.\n\nShe was luminous in black and white as well as Technicolor and shined brightly in quirky, contemporary dramas (Mister Buddwing, 1966) as well as in lavish, period pieces (The Robe, 1953). She even bridged the gap to musicals starring with Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra in Guys and Dolls (1955) and unlike her contemporaries Audrey Hepburn, Deborah Kerr, and Natalie Wood her singing voice was not dubbed by Marnie Nixon.\n\nHer final decade included a wide variety of work: serving as narrator of PBS's American Masters series' documentary on legendary Hollywood director George Cukor (On Cukor); playing Countess Lucinda Rhives in Winter Solstice alongside Geraldine Chaplin and Peter Ustinov; and in the English version of the critically acclaimed animated feature Howl's Moving Castle, she teamed up with Lauren Bacall, Christian Bale, Blythe Danner, and Emily Mortimer lending their voices to Hayao Miyakazi's rich characters in which Simmons played Grandma Sophie to great effect.\n\nAdvertisement"}, {"url": "http://www.cindykleine.com/films/nana.html", "page_content": "NANA\n\n1987, 25 MINS\n\nNana | The filmmaker\u2019s affectionate portrait of her 90-year-old grandmother, the sole occupant of a deteriorating three-story house in Far Rockaway, Queens, where various renters once resided and where Nana has lived, seemingly forever, with Mike, her devoted husband, dead at 92.

She has a gift in being able to see beyond the surface, and as a filmmaker she has been using this ability to make documentaries for the past 25 years. Passionate about telling stories that come straight from life, she aims not to send a message about a particular topic, but rather to uncover the deep psychological and emotional factors that influence people and their behavior.\n\n\"I never think of my films as having messages,\" she says. \"They\u2019re always more of an inquiry \u2014 an investigation \u2014 of what I find compelling and fascinating about people and relationships. What I want to do is reveal the truth, or a truth.\"\n\nTruth, however, is not easily defined; it is subjective, as Kleine\u2019s recent film \"\u2019Til Death Due Us Part\" so aptly demonstrates. With this three-part film (the second part of which she is currently editing), Kleine investigates how men and women experience the institution of marriage in entirely different ways. \"One truth this film speaks about is that there is no truth,\" she explains. \"In other words, there are only the stories each person invents about themselves and their history. But each person\u2019s story is completely different, even when they\u2019ve spent their entire lives together, sleeping in the same bed every night. Even those stories and memories change all the time.\"\n\nThe very fact that Kleine strives to uncover the things people hide from each other \u2014 and themselves \u2014 requires that her films be extremely personal, and she does not shy away from turning the camera on herself and her own life; the unhappy 55-year marriage she examines in \"\u2019Til Death Due Us Part\" is that of her parents. Making this film was, she says, \"more cleansing and clarifying than painful \u2014 like an exorcism,\" but she also admits that cutting so close to the bone was sometimes difficult. \"Certainly focusing this much energy and time on the bizarre and unhealthy aspects of my upbringing has, at times, been painful.\"\n\nIn her latest film, \"Inside Out,\" Kleine examines the strong correlation between pain and creativity, one that she recognizes in her own life. NewEnglandFilm.com recently caught up with her at her part-year home in Truro, Massachusetts, to talk about her teaching background, commercial success, and \"Inside Out,\" which will be screened at the Provincetown International Film Festival this month.\n\nKaren Sampson: What made you decide you wanted to be a filmmaker?\n\nCindy Kleine: I was a photography major at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts (SMFA) in Boston, and found myself wanting to make the pictures move. My boyfriend at the time was majoring in film (Visual Studies) at Harvard. He leant me his 16mm camera, showed me how to use it and how to edit, and from then on I was hooked.\n\nKS: Can you talk a bit about your teaching background?\n\nKleine: When I was 25, I got offered a teaching job at Boston College. I taught there from 1985 until 1997, with other teaching jobs during those years, too. My last teaching job was at The New School in New York, in about 1999. I\u2019ve since \"retired\" from teaching, but I still teach workshops from time to time, most recently in Provincetown and at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu.\n\nWhat I loved about teaching, and what I miss, is the pleasure of working with wonderful, talented students, turning them on to films they\u2019d never otherwise see, and helping them to realize their vision. I also miss being around young people; I learned [from my students] as much as they learned from me.\n\nKS: Your films are mostly short documentaries. What attracted you to this genre?\n\nKleine: I found that what I was passionate about expressing was always nonfictional \u2014 straight out of my life, or the lives of others who had touched me. My documentaries are never traditional docs, though; they\u2019re more arty, personal, weird, unusual. . .however you might put it.\n\nThe length, I suppose, has more to do with what I have to say, rather than being a choice, but I find my films are getting longer and longer \u2014 \"Inside Out\" is 45 minutes, and the one I am working on now is feature length. I guess the older I get, the more I have to say, and hopefully, the more wisdom I have in saying it! I\u2019m happy about this because there is an inherent problem in distributing short films, especially when they\u2019re too long to be classic \"shorts\" and too short to be considered features.\n\nKS: Do you feel that making documentaries is as creative an endeavor as making feature films? Why or why not?\n\nKleine: I think they are two completely different forms of expression, and unique talents are required to do either of them well. Because I make docs, narratives seem more difficult to me, though I love excellent well-made narrative films, and have often dreamed of making them. The work involved seems daunting to me though, and my standards are so high that I would always be afraid I wouldn\u2019t be able to live up to them.\n\nKS: Do you do all of the work (camera, editing, sound, etc.) on your films or do you work with a crew?\n\nKleine: I used to do all the work myself \u2014 shooting, sound, editing, writing, producing. With \"Inside Out,\" however, I worked with an editor (for a brief period actually two editors), and after a certain point, a cameraperson. I needed an editor because the amount of footage was way more than I\u2019d ever handled before (about 80 hours), and the film was really difficult to edit for many reasons.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve worked with a good cameraperson, I can never go back. The more experience I have, the more I am able to acknowledge my own limitations and admit the fact that I just can\u2019t do everything.\n\nKS: How important is commercial success to you?\n\nKleine: If I were to make a wish list, it would be very important. I\u2019d love for my films to be more widely seen, and I\u2019d love to make some money with them. But since it\u2019s not something I\u2019ve ever had, and I\u2019ve been making films for 25 years, I guess it\u2019s not all that important! In other words, if I wanted to, I could make \"commercial films\" \u2014 docs for TV, etc. \u2014 but I\u2019m not willing to compromise my aesthetic judgment for that purpose specifically, so it hasn\u2019t happened. My aesthetic tastes and what is considered \"commercial,\" in this country at least, are apparently not one and the same thing.\n\nKS: In your experience, what is the creative climate like for filmmakers in New England?\n\nKleine: I was nurtured and \"reared\" as a filmmaker in New England \u2014 Boston, specifically \u2014 and learned everything I know there from amazingly gifted teachers and filmmakers. Boston, and New England in general, supports my work in a way other places in the country don\u2019t. There is an atmosphere here that is very supportive of truly independent works like mine. People are much more open to it.\n\nKS: Your films have been shown at a number of prominent festivals around the country. Can you talk a bit about the festival circuit for documentaries?\n\nKleine: Things are certainly different than when I started sending work to festivals 20 years ago. More and more film festivals are now not only showing docs, but also placing greater emphasis on them. Also, there are a lot more festivals. It\u2019s a great way to have work shown (often the only way) and to meet other like-minded documentary makers. Festivals always give me an important sense of community. We forget, huddled over our little editing machines obsessing about our own personal subject matter, that there are thousands of other nuts out there doing the same thing. It\u2019s comforting to be reminded of that.\n\nKS: Your most recent film, \"Inside Out,\" introduces viewers to six very eccentric characters who create their own unique forms of art. Tell us about making this film.\n\nKleine: In 1999, while spending the summer in Santa Fe, I came across a yard that had a display of baby doll heads on sticks, and I became fascinated with exploring the idea of people who use their personal space as their own gallery. I got a photographer (Polly Brown) on board, and she and I spent two years traveling the country taking photos and footage. We found (mostly through word-of-mouth) 28 subjects altogether.\n\nAt the time I shot the footage, I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do with it, so when I decided to pull it together as a film I really struggled with the editing. There have been 100 incarnations of this film; at one point it was a feature film with animation \u2014 a whole elaborate thing.\n\nKS: Can you talk about the role creativity has played in the lives of the people you present in \"Inside Out\"?\n\nKleine: Coming from an upper middle-class background with all the advantages, education, etc., I have always had this incredible battle with my creative work. Yet these people \u2014 most of whom are poor and have had incredibly tragic lives \u2014 don\u2019t struggle with their work at all. Creativity, for them, is a way of healing. It is how they find peace and solace and the strength to go on.\n\nKS: In your synopsis of \"Inside Out\" you say the film is meant to offer us hope. Can you expand on this?\n\nKleine: I don\u2019t think it is an accident that I began working on this at a time when I began to despair about the political climate in this country. The characters in this film are meant to stand as beacons of hope by showing that no matter how bad things get, there is a way out. These people are all finding their own positive way to get by, and I believe that we \u2014 each one of us \u2014 can use our creative energy to solve any problem.\n\nKS: You have said that making \"Inside Out\" was the hardest thing you\u2019ve ever done. Are you happy with the results of all your hard work?\n\nKleine: In the end I am happy with it. It\u2019s a strange, odd film, but very much what I wanted. It\u2019s very much about the people who are in it \u2014 I gave it back to them."}, {"url": "https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/film-review-andre-gregory-before-and-after-dinner-1200332279/#!", "page_content": "Cindy Kleine pays tribute to her famed theater-director hubby in \u201cAndre Gregory: Before and After Dinner,\u201d with thoroughly delightful results. Gregory\u2019s tale-spinning fluency dazzles just as much as it did in Louis Malle\u2019s \u201cMy Dinner With Andre,\u201d but this time with a wry familiarity all Kleine\u2019s own. Shot at home or in various improvised rehearsal spaces \u2014 with much photographic evidence of Gregory\u2019s sterile, unhappy childhood, as well as occasional clips from \u201cMy Dinner With Andre\u201d and the other filmed Gregory/Wallace Shawn collaboration, \u201cVanya on 42nd Street\u201d \u2014 the film juxtaposes work and biography with wondrous open-endedness, and should enchant fans as well as those new to the table.\n\nInterspersed with various reminiscences of past productions by Gregory and his regular actors, Kleine affords tantalizing glimpses of the helmer\u2019s greatest hits, chief among them his celebrated \u201cAlice in Wonderland,\u201d which ran for seven years in the 1970s. The only remaining traces of \u201cAlice\u201d stagecraft appear in Richard Avedon\u2019s famous book of photographs and in short film snippets, including scenes with the three-man caterpillar and a satisfyingly chaotic tea-party excerpt. \u201cAlice\u201d also allows Gregory to establish a link between his private and professional lives, never very separate in any case: \u201c \u2018Alice\u2019 was the portrait of my childhood \u2026 plummeted into this horrifying, terrifying, insane world where everyone\u2019s a mindfucker.\u201d\n\nKleine neither elides nor naturalizes her own presence in Gregory\u2019s life; her grounding in their shared experience instead lends a welcome, matter-of-fact transparency to the proceedings. Husband and wife had radically different Jewish childhoods, although Kleine contents herself with mere snapshots of her loud, argumentative Long Island clan, having seemingly laid those ghosts to rest in her fascinating documentary \u201cPhyllis and Harold\u201d (the poster for which is seen prominently on a wall in the background).\n\nBy contrast, Gregory\u2019s upper-class Russian-Jewish family, which he likens to the despotic rulers of a small Balkan state, still exerts a certain awful fascination. Pursuing a respected historian\u2019s claim that Gregory\u2019s father collaborated with Hitler to destabilize the franc prior to WWII, Gregory hires researchers in Paris and Berlin to investigate the charges.\n\nThe film also continues \u201cMy Dinner With Andre\u2019s\u201d dialogue, Shawn functioning here as part of a dialectic between life and art. During ongoing rehearsals for \u201cThe Master Builder\u201d (a work in progress for 14 years), Gregory sits languidly conducting a scene, in relaxed harmony with surrounding friends and family; meanwhile, in a corner of the frame, Shawn positively vibrates with knife-edge tension as Ibsen\u2019s title character. This dual focus extends to the film\u2019s final scene, where whether art is imitating life or vice versa is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nAndre Gregory: Before and After Dinner\n\n(Documentary)\n\nReviewed on DVD, New York, March 31, 2013.
