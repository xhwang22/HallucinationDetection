He was also a founder-member of Snafu. Together with his former Whitesnake colleague Bernie Marsden he founded the Moody Marsden Band, and later, The Snakes, having previously collaborated with unofficial 5th Status Quo member Bob Young in Young & Moody. Along with Marsden and ex-Whitesnake bassist, Neil Murray, he formed Company of Snakes and M3 Classic Whitesnake with which they mainly performed early Whitesnake songs. More recently, he has toured and recorded with Snakecharmer.\n\nBesides this, Moody has also toured with Roger Chapman, Frankie Miller and Chris Farlowe. He has also performed live alongside the likes of Eric Clapton, Alvin Lee, Mick Taylor, Bruce Dickinson, Sam Brown, Gary Brooker, Suggs, Dennis Locorriere, Paul Jones, P. P. Arnold, James Hunter, Rick Wakeman, Jon Lord, Newton Faulkner, Uriah Heep, Alice Cooper, Mark King, Alfie Boe, Sandi Thom, Brian Auger, Paul Weller, Eric Bibb, Meat Loaf, Boy George, Elkie Brooks, Nona Hendryx, Mud Morganfield and one of his early guitar heroes, Duane Eddy. Since 2000 he has released several solo albums: I Eat Them For Breakfast (2000), Don't Blame Me (2006), Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009). A versatile guitarist, Moody has been an active session musician and his own website lists over 100 albums to which he has contributed musically. 2006 saw the release of the autobiographical Playing With Trumpets \u2013 A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship, a memoir about his early days on the music scene. His library music has been featured on such TV programmes as Waking the Dead, Bo' Selecta!, America's Next Top Model, How to Look Good Naked, Top Gear, Horizon, Jersey Shore, Mad Men, Wife Swap and Paul Hollywood's Bread.\n\nBiography\n\n1960s\n\nWhile still at school in Middlesbrough and attending private guitar lessons, Moody formed The Roadrunners with several others from the smae area including Paul Rodgers (later of Free and Bad Company). They were joined some time later by bass player Bruce Thomas, who moved onto play with Elvis Costello and the Attractions. The band performed a range of covers in local halls and clubs. By 1967 they had developed and outgrown the local music scene and turned professional, changing their name to The Wildflowers and subsequently moving to London. They had some success and undertook some touring, but relationships within the band frayed and they eventually split without making any recordings. Moody returned home to Middlesbrough where for a while he widened his musical horizons by taking classical guitar lessons. He also became increasingly interested in slide guitar techniques (a style he would later be closely associated with). While living in Middlesbrough he was asked by local singer and entrepreneur John McCoy, to form a group which became Tramline. A deal for two albums was signed with Island Records, but by the time the second album was released the band had broken up. Moody joined Lucas and the professional Soul band Mike Cotton Sound who became Gene Pitney's backing band for UK tours as well as others such as Paul Jones.\n\n1970s\n\nIn 1970 he joined the recently re-patriated keybopard player Zoot Money as guitarist. He then replaced Neil Hubbard in Juicy Lucy with whom he recorded three albums and toured extensively before the group disbanded. After the band split, Moody co-founded Snafu which combined his funk-rock guitar style with U.S down-home stateside grooves. The band recorded three albums SNAFU, Situation Normal and All Funked Up. They also appeared on a John Peel The Old Grey Whistle Test session and the T.V series Supersonic. Extensive touring followed before the band broke up. At this time Moody undertook occasional work as a session player most notably for Graham Bonnet. He also contributed to one track on Gerry Rafferty's City to City. He performed with the former Status Quo drummer John Coghlan's Diesel Band, then recorded an album with the band's tour manager and lyricist Bob Young which became Young & Moody. He then toured with Frankie Miller and stood in as a guste with with Hinkley's Heroes before joining his friend David Coverdale. Moody had known Coverdale from the local music scene in the Middlesbrough area in the late sixties, upto this time Coverdale had been fronting Deep Purple and was looking to undertake a solo venture. Coverdale invited Moody to work with him and the album White Snake was released in 1977. Moody shared writing credits on four songs including the title track. A second album Northwinds followed in 1978, on which Moody contributed to three songs. Following the demise of Deep Purple MkIV, Coverdale and Moody joined forces with Bernie Marsden, Neil Murray, Dave 'Duck' Dowle and keyboardist Brian Johnston to form a band that took its name Whitesnake from the title of Coverdale's first solo album. In 1978 they recorded the E.P Snakebite followed by two Studio albums, Trouble (1978) and Lovehunter (1979) which were recorded by a modified line up with Jon Lord on keyboards. Moody is credited with co-writing four of the ten tracks on Trouble and was sole writer of Belgian Tom's Hat Trick', an instrumental. While working with Whitesnake he also played slide guitar on Roger Chapman's debut solo album Chappo.\n\n1980s\n\nMoody contributed slide guitar to three tracks on former Lindisfarne member Ray Jackson's solo debut In the Night, which was released in 1980. By this point Whitesnake now featured Ian Paice from Deep Purple on drums, who had been brought into the group to replace Dowle. In 1980 this line up released the album Ready an' Willing, from which two UK singles were taken, Fool for Your Loving and the album title track, both co-written by Moody. The band also released the double album Live...in the Heart of the City in the same year. At his time he recorded two singles with Bob Young, with all tracks written by Moody.\n\nIn 1981 Graham Bonnet released his album Line-Up which featured Moody playing guitar on all tracks and also featured three songs written by Moody in partnership with Bob Young. Moody continued to maintain a busy schedule with Whitesnake and the band released the album Come an' Get Itin the same year. Relationships within the band were beginning to sour and Moody's guitar partner Bernie Marsden left prior to the final completion of the next album Saints and Sinners. Moody himself followed soon after. Whitesnake took time out for much of 1982 and Moody undertook some session work, with Sheena Easton and others. By late 1982 Whitesnake was reformed with Mel Galley replacing Marsden and Moody joining Galley on the album's backing vocal sessions. In 1983 Coverdale replaced Ian Paice and Neil Murray with Cozy Powell and Colin Hodgkinson. Moody was not happy with the direction the new band was taking and felt increasingly sidelined by Coverdale. However, despite the deteriorating situation within Whitesnake, Moody recorded Slide It In with them. A process he described as an 'unhappy experience' and after which he left the band in 1983.\n\nMoody returned to session work with Mike Oldfield, Gary Glitter, Mike d'Abo and Roger Chapman, as well as selected T.V music library work. He toured with Chris Farlowe and also worked with former Meal Ticket singer Willy Finlayson and his band the Hurters. Taking a wry, yet witty view on some of the people and experiences they'd encountered over the years, he got together with Bob Young to write a book on musician's humour, the acclaimed Language of Rock and Roll. He also put together the first version of the Micky Moody Band featuring former Taste bassist Charlie McCracken and drummer Chris Hunt. Towards the end of the decade he and Bernie Marsden played selected venues with their own Moody Marsden Band.\n\n1990s\n\nDuring the early part of the 1990s, Moody toured extensively with Roger Chapman before re-uniting on a more permanent basis with Whitesnake guitarist Bernie Marsden, to tour and record with the Moody Marsden Band in U.K and Europe. The Moody Marsden Band recorded two live albums, Never Turn Our Back on the Blues and Live in Hell and a studio set, Real Faith. In 1996, Moody toured the USA as part of the Best of British Blues tour which also featured Eric Burdon, Alvin Lee, Aynsley Dunbar, Boz Burrell and Tim Hinkley. The following year, Moody and Marsden teamed up with Norwegian rockers Jorn Lande, Willy Bendickson and Sid Ringsby to form The Snakes, a band that specialised in re-producing the sounds of the original Whitesnake. Don Airey would often be brought in to augment them on keyboards. The band recorded two albums, Once Bitten and Live in Europe before making way for The Company of Snakes, which featured in its line up former Bad Company vocalist Robert Hart, original Whitesnake bass player Neil Murray and ex-Manfred Mann's Earth Band drummer John Lingwood. Hart was eventually replaced by ex-Snakes in Paradise frontman Steffan Berggren, and the band released two albums, Burst the Bubble and a live set Here They Go Again.\n\n2000s\n\nIn 2000, Micky wrote and produced library music prior to the release of his first official solo album, I Eat Them For Breakfast. Whilst continuing to perform with Company of Snakes and take on occasional session work, Moody joined his former Juicy Lucy bandmate Paul Williams to arrange and record a selection of acoustic classic Chicago blues tracks for the album Smokestacks, Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men. He also started to play occasional duo gigs with bluesman Papa George. 'Snake' metamorphosed into M3 Classic Whitesnake and also released released a live CD featuring Martin and a live DVD featuring Berggren with a guest appearance from former Ritchie Blackmore and Yngwie Malmsteen frontman Doogie White. Also featured in this line-up were Go West and Tears for Fears drummer Jimmy Copley and keyboard player Mark Stanway from Magnum.\n\nAround this time Moody played on the album Nah Aufnahme by German musician Westernhagen, which eventually appeared in thethe national charts. 2006 saw the release of Moody's self-produced solo album Don't Blame Me which was released at the same time as publication of his autobiographical memoirsPlaying with Trumpets \u2013 A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship. M3 broke up later that year, after which Moody performed more shows with Roger Chapman plus selected dates with a line-up of the Micky Moody Band that featured his eldest son Micky Moody Jr. on drums. In 2008 he toured Japan as special guest of Jimmy Copley and Japanese guitar legend Char. Also featured was ex-Herbie Hancock bassist Paul Jackson and keyboard wizard Yoshinobu Kojima. The shows were recorded and released on DVD as Jimmy Copley & Char: Special Session. To celebrate his love of instrumental music, Micky wrote and produced the albums Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009).\n\n2010s\n\nIn 2011, Moody co-wrote library music for both Warner/Chapell and Universal before co-forming Snakecharmer, a stellar line up which also includes former Whitesnake colleague Neil Murray. He also made regular appearances alongside blues guitarist Papa George and has been an active member of the Sunflower Jam house band and the Bad Apples.\n\nDiscography\n\nWith Tramline\n\n1968 Somewhere Down The Line\n\n1969 Moves of Vegetable Centuries\n\nWith Juicy Lucy\n\n1970 Lie Back and Enjoy It\n\n1971 Get a Whiff a This\n\n1972 Pieces\n\nWith Snafu\n\n1973 Snafu\n\n1974 Situation Normal\n\n1975 All Funked Up\n\nWith The Moody Marsden Band\n\n1992 Never Turn Our Back on the Blues\n\n1994 live in Hell\n\n1994 The Time Is Right For Live\n\n1994 Real Faith\n\n2000 The Night the Guitars Came to Play\n\nWith Bob Young\n\n1977 Young and Moody\n\n1995 The Nearest Hits Album\n\n2010 Back for the Last Time Again\n\nWith David Coverdale\n\n1977 White Snake\n\n1978 Northwinds\n\n2003 The Early Years\n\nWith Whitesnake\n\n1978 Snakebite\n\n1978 Trouble\n\n1978 Live at Hammersmith\n\n1979 Lovehunter\n\n1980 Ready an' Willing\n\n1980 Live...in the Heart of the City\n\n1981 Come an' Get It\n\n1982 Saints & Sinners\n\n1984 Slide It In (UK version)\n\n(UK version) 1994 Greatest Hits\n\n2003 Best of Whitesnake\n\n2003 The Silver Anniversary Collection\n\n2004 The Early Years\n\n2008 30th Anniversary Collection\n\n2011 Box of Snakes\n\nWith The Snakes, Company of Snakes & M3\n\n1998 Once Bitten (Japan)\n\n(Japan) 1998 Live in Europe\n\n2001 Here They Go Again\n\n2002 Burst the Bubble\n\n2005 Classic Snake Live\n\n2005 Rough An' Ready (live album, CD)\n\n(live album, CD) 2007 Rough An' Ready (live album, DVD)\n\nWith Snakecharmer\n\n2013 Snakecharmer\n\nWith The Bad Apples\n\n2014 Played\n\nWith Ali Maas\n\n2016 Black & Chrome\n\nSolo\n\n2000 I Eat Them for Breakfast\n\n2002 Smokestacks Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men (with Paul Williams)\n\n(with Paul Williams) 2006 Don't Blame Me\n\n2007 Acoustic Journeyman\n\n2008 Live and Rocking! \u2013 Live at the Hell Blues Festival 2000 (Micky Moody & Friends)\n\n(Micky Moody & Friends) 2009 Electric Journeyman\n\n2016 Black & Chrome (with Ali Maas)\n\nGuest appearances"}, {"url": "https://www.wikilogy.com/biography/micky-moody/", "page_content": "Micky Moody is an English musician, best known as a guitarist.

Along with Marsden and ex-Whitesnake bassist, Neil Murray, he formed Company of Snakes and M3 Classic Whitesnake with which they mainly performed early Whitesnake songs. From 2010 he has been working with Murray, guitarist Laurie Wisefield, drummer Harry James, singer Chris Ousey and keyboard player Michael Bramwell in Monsters of British Rock which has morphed into Snakecharmer with Adam Wakeman on keyboards.\n\nBesides this, Moody has also toured with Roger Chapman, Frankie Miller and Chris Farlowe. He has also worked alongside the likes of Eric Clapton, Alvin Lee, Mick Taylor, Bruce Dickinson, Sam Brown, Gary Brooker, Suggs, Dennis Locorriere, Paul Jones, PP Arnold, James Hunter, Rick Wakeman, Jon Lord, Newton Faulkner and Uriah Heep. For TV he has also accompanied such stars as Meat Loaf, Boy George, Elkie Brooks, Nona Hendryx, Ben E. King and one of his early guitar heroes, Duane Eddy. Since 2000 he has released several solo albums: I Eat Them For Breakfast (2000), Don't Blame Me (2006), Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009).[1] A versatile guitarist, Moody has been an active session musician and his own website lists over 100 albums to which he has contributed musically. 2006 saw the release of the autobiographical Playing With Trumpets - A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship, a memoir about his early days on the music scene.[2] His media music has been featured on such TV programmes as Waking the Dead, Bo Selecta, America's Next Top Model, How To Look Good Naked, Top Gear, Mad Men and Wife Swap USA.\n\nBiography\n\n1960s\n\nWhile still at school in Middlesbrough and regularly attending private guitar lessons, Moody formed a band named The RoadRunners with several other local boys including Paul Rodgers (later to form Free and Bad Company), and later, Bruce Thomas, who would eventually play bass with Elvis Costello and the Attractions. The band were kept busy performing a range of covers in local halls and clubs. By 1967 they had developed and outgrown the local music scene so they took the decision to turn professional, change their name to the Wildflowers, and move to London. They had some success and undertook some touring, but relationships within the band frayed and they eventually split without ever releasing any recordings. Moody returned home to Middlesbrough where for a while he widened his musical horizons by taking classical guitar lessons. He also became increasingly interested in slide guitar techniques (a style he would later be closely associated with). While living in Middlesbrough he was asked by local singer and entrepreneur, John McCoy, to form a group which became Tramline. A deal for two albums was signed with Island Records, but by the time the second album was released the band had already split and gone their separate ways. At this point Moody joined Lucas and the Mike Cotton Sound who, as well as proving to be a highly-polished Soul band, also acted as Gene Pitney's backing band for his UK tours as well as backing others, such as Paul Jones.[3][4]\n\n1970s\n\nIn 1970 he joined the recently re-patriated Zoot Money before replacing Neil Hubbard in Juicy Lucy. As a member of Juicy Lucy, he recorded three albums and toured extensively before the group disbanded. After the band split, Micky co-founded Snafu which combined his funk-rock guitar style with some down-home stateside grooves. The band recorded three albums - SNAFU, Situation Normal, and All Funked Up. They also appeared on a John Peel session, the Old Grey Whistle Test and Supersonic and toured extensively before the individual members headed off to pursue different ventures. Moody undertook occasional work as a session player before, during and after Snafu, most notably for Graham Bonnett. He also contributed to one track on City to City by Gerry Rafferty. Moody performed as an original member of Status Quo drummer John Coghlan's Diesel Band, then recorded an album with the band's tour manager and lyricist, Bob Young. The result was Young & Moody. He then toured with Frankie Miller and guested with Hinkley's Heroes before hooking up with another friend from the North East, David Coverdale. Micky had known Coverdale from the local music scene in the Middlesbrough area in the late sixties, but by this point Coverdale had been fronting Deep Purple and was looking to undertake a solo venture. He invited Moody to assist and the result was the album White Snake released in 1977 which was followed by a second album Northwinds in 1978. Moody shared writing credits on four of the nine songs on Whitesnake (including the title track) and three of the eight songs featured on Northwinds. With the demise of Deep Purple MkIV, Coverdale and Moody joined forces with Bernie Marsden, Neil Murray, Dave 'Duck' Dowle and keyboardist Brian Johnston (replaced after a few months by Pete Solley) to form a band that took its name Whitesnake from the title of Coverdale's first solo album. In 1978 they recorded the EP Snakebite followed by two Studio albums: Trouble (also in 1978) and Lovehunter (1979) which were recorded by a modified line up with Jon Lord on keyboards. Moody is credited with co-writing four of the ten tracks on Trouble, and was sole author of a fifth (the lively instrumental, Belgian Tom's Hat Trick). He contributed to three of the ten songs on Lovehunter, most notably the title track. While working with Whitesnake he found time to play slide guitar on several tracks on Roger Chapman's debut solo album, Chappo.\n\n1980s\n\n\n\nCourtesy: Andrew King Bernie Marsden (left) and Micky Moody; at Hammersmith Odeon, in 1981Courtesy: Andrew King\n\nMoody contributed slide guitar to three tracks on Ex-Lindisfarne Ray Jackson's solo debut In the Night released in 1980. By this point Whitesnake now featured Ian Paice from Deep Purple on drums, who had been brought into the group to replace Dowle. In 1980 this line up released the album Ready an' Willing, which spawned two UK single hits in the form of Fool for your Loving and the album title track; Moody co-wrote both tracks. The band also released the double album Live...in the Heart of the City in that year. He also found time to write and record two singles with Bob Young. In 1981 Graham Bonnet released his album Line-Up which featured Moody playing guitar on all tracks and also featured three songs written by Moody in partnership with Bob Young. Micky maintained a busy schedule with Whitesnake and the band released the album Come an' Get It that year. Relationships within the band were beginning to sour and Moody's guitar partner Bernie Marsden left prior to the final completion of the next album Saints and Sinners. Moody himself followed soon after. The band was put on hold for much of 1982 and Moody undertook some session work, for the likes of Sheena Easton. By late 1982 Whitesnake were back, (with Mel Galley replacing Marsden), and a re-juvinated Moody joining Galley on the album's backing vocal sessions. Going into 1983, Coverdale replaced Ian Paice and Neil Murray with Cozy Powell and Colin Hodgkinson. However Micky was not particularly happy with the direction the new band was taking and felt increasingly sidelined by Coverdale.[5] Despite the deteriorating situation within Whitesnake, Moody persevered with recording the Slide It In album (which he describes as an 'unhappy experience' ) before quitting the band in 1983 at the end of a tour.[1] Moody went back to session work with a series of artists including Mike Oldfield, Gary Glitter, Mike d'Abo, and Roger Chapman as well as selected TV work. He toured with Chris Farlowe and also worked with ex-Meal Ticket singer Willy Finlayson and his band the Hurters. Taking a wry, yet witty view on some of the people and experiences they'd encountered over the years, he got together with Bob Young to write a book on musician's humour, the acclaimed Language Of Rock And Roll. He also put together the first version of the Micky Moody Band featuring ex-Taste bassist Charlie McCracken and drummer Chris Hunt. Towards the end of the decade he and Bernie Marsden played selected venues with the their own Moody Marsden Band.\n\n1990s\n\nDuring the early part of the 1990s, Moody toured extensively with Roger Chapman before re-uniting on a more permanent basis with his erstwhile Whitesnake guitarist-in-crime, Bernie Marsden, to tour and record with the Moody Marsden Band, concentrating mostly on the British and western European markets. Featured in various line-ups were drummers Zak Starkey, Terry Williams, John Trotter, Henry Spinetti and Dave Dowle; bass players Jaz Lochrie, Pete Stroud, Steve Price, Neil Murray and David Levy, and keyboard players Don Ariey and Josh Phillips. Guests in the studio included harmonica player Mark Feltham, keyboard player Volker 'Wolfman' Kunschner, brass players Nick Pentelow, Frank Mead and Martin Drover, and backing singers Monica Reed-Price and Mick Lister. The Moody Marsden Band recorded two live albums, Never Turn Our Back On the Blues and Live In Hell and a studio set, Real Faith. In 1996, Moody toured the USA as part of the Best of British Blues tour which also featured Alvin Lee, Eric Burdon, Aynsley Dunbar, Boz Burrell and Tim Hinkley. The following year, Moody and Marsden teamed up with Norwegian rockers Jorn Lande, Willy Bendickson and Sid Ringsby to form The Snakes, a band that specialised in re-producing the sounds of the original Whitesnake. Don Airey would often be brought in to augment them on keyboards. The band recorded two albums, Once Bitten and Live in Europe before making way for The Company of Snakes, which featured in its line up former Bad Company vocalist Robert Hart, original Whitesnake bass player Neil Murray and ex-Manfred Mann's Earth Band drummer John Lingwood. Hart was eventually replaced by ex-Snakes in Paradise frontman Steffan Berggren, and the band released two albums, Burst the Bubble and a live set, Here They Go Again.\n\n2000s\n\nIn 2000, Micky wrote and produced media music prior to the release of his first official solo album, I Eat Them For Breakfast. Whilst continuing to perform with Company Of Snakes and take on occasional session work, Moody joined his former Juicy Lucy bandmate Paul Williams[6] to arrange and record a selection of classic Chicago blues tracks in a mostly 'unplugged' fashion; the result was Smokestacks, Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men. He also started to play occasional gigs in a duo format with bluesman Papa George, and continues to do so. The next 'Snake' metamorphosis was into M3 Classic Whitesnake, and although ex-Black Sabbath singer Tony Martin was in the starting line-up, Stefan Berggren was soon back in the frontman's spot. M3 released a live CD featuring Martin, and a live DVD featuring Berggren with a guest appearance from former Richie Blackmore and Yngwie Malmsteen frontman Doogie White. Also featured in this line-up were ex-Paul Rodgers Band, Go West and Tears for Fears drummer Jimmy Copley and keyboard player Mark Stanway from Magnum.\n\nAround this time, Moody played on the album Nah Aufnahme by German superstar Westernhagen, which eventually topped the national charts. 2006 saw the release of Moody's self-produced solo album Don't Blame Me in tandem with the autobiographical Playing with Trumpets - A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship, the latter recounting his early days in the music business, mostly in the company of Paul Rodgers. M3 broke up later that year, after which Moody performed more shows with Roger Chapman plus selected dates with a line-up of the Micky Moody Band that featured his eldest son Micky Moody Jr. on drums. In 2008 he toured Japan as special guest of Jimmy Copley and Japanese guitar legend Char. Also featured was ex-Herbie Hancock bassist Paul Jackson and keyboard wizard Yoshinobu Kojima. The shows were recorded and released on DVD as Jimmy Copley & Char: Special Session. To celebrate his love of instrumental music, Micky wrote and produced Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009).\n\n2010s\n\nIn 2011, Moody co-wrote library music for both Warner/Chapell and Universal before forming Snakecharmer with Neil Murray, also formerly of Whitesnake and The Company of Snakes.\n\nDiscography\n\nWith Tramline\n\n1968 Somewhere Down The Line\n\n1969 Moves of Vegetable Centuries\n\nWith Juicy Lucy\n\n1970 Lie Back and Enjoy It\n\n1971 Get a Whiff a This\n\n1972 Pieces\n\nWith Snafu\n\n1973 SNAFU (album)\n\n1974 Situation Normal\n\n1975 All Funked Up\n\nWith The Moody Marsden Band\n\n1992 Never Turn Our Back On The Blues\n\n1994 live In Hell\n\n1994 The Time Is Right For Live\n\n1994 Real Faith\n\n2000 The Night the Guitars Came to Play\n\nWith Bob Young\n\n1977 Young and Moody\n\n1995 The Nearest Hits Album\n\n2010 Back for the Last Time Again\n\nWith David Coverdale\n\n1977 White Snake\n\n1978 Northwinds\n\n2003 The Early Years\n\nWith Whitesnake\n\nWith The Snakes, Company of Snakes & M3\n\n1998 Once Bitten (Japan)\n\n(Japan) 1998 Live in Europe\n\n2001 Here They Go Again\n\n2002 Burst The Bubble\n\n2005 Classic Snake Live\n\n2005 Rough An' Ready (live album, CD)\n\n(live album, CD) 2007 Rough An' Ready (live album, DVD)\n\nSolo\n\n2000 I Eat Them For Breakfast\n\n2002 Smokestacks Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men (with Paul Williams)\n\n(with Paul Williams) 2006 Don't Blame Me\n\n2007 Acoustic Journeyman\n\n2008 Live and Rocking! - Live at the Hell Blues Festival 2000 (Micky Moody & Friends)\n\n(Micky Moody & Friends) 2009 Electric Journeyman\n\nGuest appearances\n\n1969 You Can All Join In (VA)\n\n(VA) 1970 Zoot Money (Zoot Money)\n\n(Zoot Money) 1973 In Memory of Robert Johnson (Paul Williams)\n\n(Paul Williams) 1973 I Never Got (Tony Kelly)\n\n(Tony Kelly) 1973 Manor Live (VA)\n\n(VA) 1973 Me and My Friend (Patrick Campbell Lyons)\n\n(Patrick Campbell Lyons) 1974 Funkist (Bobby Harrison)\n\n(Bobby Harrison) 1975 Squire (Alan Hull)\n\n(Alan Hull) 1975 Legend (Mickey Jupp)\n\n(Mickey Jupp) 1977 Graham Bonnet (Graham Bonnet)\n\n(Graham Bonnet) 1977 Fancy That (Joanna Carlin)\n\n(Joanna Carlin) 1977 City to City (Gerry Rafferty)\n\n(Gerry Rafferty) 1979 Chappo (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1981 Line Up (Graham Bonnet)\n\n(Graham Bonnet) 1982 Riff Burglars (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1982 Music Money And Madness (Sheena Easton)\n\n(Sheena Easton) 1986 In Quo Country (Bob Young)\n\n(Bob Young) 1987 Islands (Mike Oldfield)\n\n(Mike Oldfield) 1987 Party Album (Gary Glitter)\n\n(Gary Glitter) 1987 Reaching Out (Paul Millns)\n\n(Paul Millns) 1987 Indestructible (Mike D'Abo)\n\n(Mike D'Abo) 1987 No Angel (Sanne Salomonsen)\n\n(Sanne Salomonsen) 1988 New Day (Jane Harrison)\n\n(Jane Harrison) 1989 Walking The Cat (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1990 Hybrid and Lowdown (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1991 Blue-Eyed Slide (Brian Knight)\n\n(Brian Knight) 1992 Parlour Games (John Spencer)\n\n(John Spencer) 1992 Blues Brittania (VA)\n\n(VA) 1992 Waiting In The Wings (Chris Farlowe)\n\n(Chris Farlowe) 1992 Very Much Alive (Willy Finlayson and The Hurters)\n\n(Willy Finlayson and The Hurters) 1993 Midnight Postcards (Adam Faith)\n\n(Adam Faith) 1994 Tellin' Stories (Walter Trout)\n\n(Walter Trout) 1994 Line Up (Borderline)\n\n(Borderline) 1995 Together (Peter Smith)\n\n(Peter Smith) 1995 Green and Blues (Bernie Marsden)\n\n(Bernie Marsden) 1996 Kiss My Soul (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1996 Blue Thunder (Blue Thunder)\n\n(Blue Thunder) 1998 Pinboard Wizards (Jackie Lynton)\n\n(Jackie Lynton) 2000 Here After (Jamie Marshall)\n\n(Jamie Marshall) 2000 Gimme All Your Topp (VA)\n\n(VA) 2000 Snakebites (VA)\n\n(VA) 2000 Glory Bound (Chris Farlowe)\n\n(Chris Farlowe) 2001 Another Hair Of the Dog (VA)\n\n(VA) 2001 Tam de ti ye...

By this point Whitesnake now featured Ian Paice from Deep Purple on drums, who had been brought into the group to replace Dowle. In 1980 this line up released the album Ready an' Willing, from which two UK singles were taken, Fool for Your Loving and the album title track, both co-written by Moody. The band also released the double album Live...in the Heart of the City in the same year. At his time he recorded two singles with Bob Young, with all tracks written by Moody.\n\nIn 1981 Graham Bonnet released his album Line-Up which featured Moody playing guitar on all tracks and also featured three songs written by Moody in partnership with Bob Young. Moody continued to maintain a busy schedule with Whitesnake and the band released the album Come an' Get Itin the same year. Relationships within the band were beginning to sour and Moody's guitar partner Bernie Marsden left prior to the final completion of the next album Saints and Sinners. Moody himself followed soon after. Whitesnake took time out for much of 1982 and Moody undertook some session work, with Sheena Easton and others. By late 1982 Whitesnake was reformed with Mel Galley replacing Marsden and Moody joining Galley on the album's backing vocal sessions. In 1983 Coverdale replaced Ian Paice and Neil Murray with Cozy Powell and Colin Hodgkinson. Moody was not happy with the direction the new band was taking and felt increasingly sidelined by Coverdale. However, despite the deteriorating situation within Whitesnake, Moody recorded Slide It In with them. A process he described as an 'unhappy experience' and after which he left the band in 1983.\n\nMoody returned to session work with Mike Oldfield, Gary Glitter, Mike d'Abo and Roger Chapman, as well as selected T.V music library work. He toured with Chris Farlowe and also worked with former Meal Ticket singer Willy Finlayson and his band the Hurters. Taking a wry, yet witty view on some of the people and experiences they'd encountered over the years, he got together with Bob Young to write a book on musician's humour, the acclaimed Language of Rock and Roll. He also put together the first version of the Micky Moody Band featuring former Taste bassist Charlie McCracken and drummer Chris Hunt. Towards the end of the decade he and Bernie Marsden played selected venues with their own Moody Marsden Band.\n\n1990s\n\nDuring the early part of the 1990s, Moody toured extensively with Roger Chapman before re-uniting on a more permanent basis with Whitesnake guitarist Bernie Marsden, to tour and record with the Moody Marsden Band in U.K and Europe. The Moody Marsden Band recorded two live albums, Never Turn Our Back on the Blues and Live in Hell and a studio set, Real Faith. In 1996, Moody toured the USA as part of the Best of British Blues tour which also featured Eric Burdon, Alvin Lee, Aynsley Dunbar, Boz Burrell and Tim Hinkley. The following year, Moody and Marsden teamed up with Norwegian rockers Jorn Lande, Willy Bendickson and Sid Ringsby to form The Snakes, a band that specialised in re-producing the sounds of the original Whitesnake. Don Airey would often be brought in to augment them on keyboards. The band recorded two albums, Once Bitten and Live in Europe before making way for The Company of Snakes, which featured in its line up former Bad Company vocalist Robert Hart, original Whitesnake bass player Neil Murray and ex-Manfred Mann's Earth Band drummer John Lingwood. Hart was eventually replaced by ex-Snakes in Paradise frontman Steffan Berggren, and the band released two albums, Burst the Bubble and a live set Here They Go Again.\n\n2000s\n\nIn 2000, Micky wrote and produced library music prior to the release of his first official solo album, I Eat Them For Breakfast. Whilst continuing to perform with Company of Snakes and take on occasional session work, Moody joined his former Juicy Lucy bandmate Paul Williams to arrange and record a selection of acoustic classic Chicago blues tracks for the album Smokestacks, Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men. He also started to play occasional duo gigs with bluesman Papa George. 'Snake' metamorphosed into M3 Classic Whitesnake and also released released a live CD featuring Martin and a live DVD featuring Berggren with a guest appearance from former Ritchie Blackmore and Yngwie Malmsteen frontman Doogie White. Also featured in this line-up were Go West and Tears for Fears drummer Jimmy Copley and keyboard player Mark Stanway from Magnum.\n\nAround this time Moody played on the album Nah Aufnahme by German musician Westernhagen, which eventually appeared in thethe national charts. 2006 saw the release of Moody's self-produced solo album Don't Blame Me which was released at the same time as publication of his autobiographical memoirsPlaying with Trumpets \u2013 A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship. M3 broke up later that year, after which Moody performed more shows with Roger Chapman plus selected dates with a line-up of the Micky Moody Band that featured his eldest son Micky Moody Jr. on drums. In 2008 he toured Japan as special guest of Jimmy Copley and Japanese guitar legend Char. Also featured was ex-Herbie Hancock bassist Paul Jackson and keyboard wizard Yoshinobu Kojima. The shows were recorded and released on DVD as Jimmy Copley & Char: Special Session. To celebrate his love of instrumental music, Micky wrote and produced the albums Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009).\n\n2010s\n\nIn 2011, Moody co-wrote library music for both Warner/Chapell and Universal before co-forming Snakecharmer, a line up which also includes former Whitesnake colleague Neil Murray and Adam Wakeman. He also made regular appearances alongside blues guitarist Papa George and has been an active member of the Sunflower Jam house band and the Bad Apples.\n\nWith Tramline\n\n1968 Somewhere Down The Line\n\n1969 Moves of Vegetable Centuries\n\nWith Juicy Lucy\n\n1970 Lie Back and Enjoy It\n\n1971 Get a Whiff a This\n\n1972 Pieces\n\nWith Snafu\n\n1973 Snafu\n\n1974 Situation Normal\n\n1975 All Funked Up\n\nWith The Moody Marsden Band\n\n1992 Never Turn Our Back on the Blues\n\n1994 live in Hell\n\n1994 The Time Is Right For Live\n\n1994 Real Faith\n\n2000 The Night the Guitars Came to Play\n\n2001 Ozone Friendly\n\nWith Bob Young\n\n1977 Young and Moody\n\n1995 The Nearest Hits Album\n\n2010 Back for the Last Time Again\n\nWith David Coverdale\n\n1977 White Snake\n\n1978 Northwinds\n\n2003 The Early Years\n\nWith Whitesnake\n\n1978 Snakebite\n\n1978 Trouble\n\n1978 Live at Hammersmith\n\n1979 Lovehunter\n\n1980 Ready an' Willing\n\n1980 Live...in the Heart of the City\n\n1982 Saints & Sinners\n\n1984 Slide It In (UK version)\n\n1994 Greatest Hits\n\n2003 Best of Whitesnake\n\n2003 The Silver Anniversary Collection\n\n2004 The Early Years\n\n2008 30th Anniversary Collection\n\n2011 Box of Snakes\n\nWith The Snakes, Company of Snakes & M3\n\n1998 Once Bitten (Japan)\n\n1998 Live in Europe\n\n2001 Here They Go Again\n\n2002 Burst the Bubble\n\n2005 Classic Snake Live\n\n2005 Rough An' Ready (live album, CD)\n\n2007 Rough An' Ready (live album, DVD)\n\nWith Snakecharmer\n\n2013 Snakecharmer\n\n2017 Second Skin\n\nWith The Bad Apples\n\n2014 Played\n\nWith Ali Maas\n\n2016 Black & Chrome\n\nSolo\n\n2000 I Eat Them for Breakfast\n\n2002 Smokestacks Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men (with Paul Williams)\n\n2006 Don't Blame Me\n\n2007 Acoustic Journeyman\n\n2008 Live and Rocking! \u2013 Live at the Hell Blues Festival 2000 (Micky Moody & Friends)\n\n2009 Electric Journeyman\n\n2016 Black & Chrome (with Ali Maas)\n\nGuest appearances\n\n1969 You Can All Join In (VA)\n\n1970 Zoot Money (Zoot Money)\n\n1973 In Memory of Robert Johnson (Paul Williams)\n\n1973 I Never Got (Tony Kelly)\n\n1973 Manor Live (VA)\n\n1973 Me and My Friend (Patrick Campbell Lyons)\n\n1974 Funkist (Bobby Harrison)\n\n1975 Squire (Alan Hull)\n\n1975 Legend (Mickey Jupp)\n\n1977 Graham Bonnet (Graham Bonnet)\n\n1977 Fancy That (Joanna Carlin)\n\n1977 City to City (Gerry Rafferty)\n\n1979 Chappo (Roger Chapman)\n\n1981 Line Up (Graham Bonnet)\n\n1982 Riff Burglars (Roger Chapman)\n\n1982 Madness, Money & Music (Sheena Easton)\n\n1986 In Quo Country (Bob Young)\n\n1987 Islands (Mike Oldfield)\n\n1987 Party Album (Gary Glitter)\n\n1987 Reaching Out (Paul Millns)\n\n1987 Indestructible (Mike D'Abo)\n\n1987 No Angel (Sanne Salomonsen)\n\n1988 New Day (Jane Harrison)\n\n1989 Walking The Cat (Roger Chapman)\n\n1990 Hybrid and Lowdown (Roger Chapman)\n\n1991 Blue-Eyed Slide (Brian Knight)\n\n1992 Parlour Games (John Spencer)\n\n1992 Blues Brittania (VA)\n\n1992 Waiting in the Wings (Chris Farlowe)\n\n1992 Very Much Alive (Willy Finlayson and The Hurters)\n\n1993 Midnight Postcards (Adam Faith)\n\n1994 Tellin' Stories (Walter Trout)\n\n1994 Line Up (Borderline)\n\n1995 Together (Peter Smith)\n\n1995 Green and Blues (Bernie Marsden)\n\n1996 Kiss My Soul (Roger Chapman)\n\n1996 Blue Thunder (Blue Thunder)\n\n1998 Pinboard Wizards (Jackie Lynton)\n\n2000 Here After (Jamie Marshall)\n\n2000 Gimme All Your Topp (VA)\n\n2000 Snakebites (VA)\n\n2000 Glory Bound (Chris Farlowe)\n\n2001 Another Hair of the Dog (VA)\n\n2001 Tam de ti ye...

Micky quickly graduated to the recording studios via the R&B combo Tramline before touring Britain and Europe with some of the countrys top soul musicians.\n\nJoining the highly acclaimed Juicy Lucy was a large step towards rock stardom, and major tours of Britain, Europe and the USA accompanied a regular output of recorded works. After Juicy Lucy split, Micky co-founded Snafu, combining his rock-style guitar with down-home stateside grooves, and became a major contributor on the song-writing front. Snafu recorded three albums and toured extensively before the individual members headed off to pursue their different ventures. Micky then became engrossed in session work as his reputation as a versatile performer spread. Soon a phone call from David Coverdale assured Micky of a vital place in his future plans, starting with the guitar slot and co-writing position on his forthcoming solo albums, Whitesnake and Northwinds.\n\n\n\nAs a sideman, Micky has featured alongside such classic British singers as Graham Bonnet, Frankie Miller, Chris Farlowe, Sheena Easton, Roger Chapman, Elkie Brookes and Eric Burdon. Visitors from the states such as Meat Loaf, Matt guitar Murphy, Ben E. King and Walter Trout have all employed his talents to enhance their performances.\n\nMicky's session work has included many T.V. commercials and some film scores. As a writer or co-writer his credits are numerous and include many of the classic Whitesnake favourites. With the Moody Marsden band, he and his guitar sparring partner Bernie Marsden toured extensively and released four albums before continuing their Whitesnake legacy with the Snakes and the Company of Snakes.\n\nIn 2000 Micky finally released his first solo album I Eat Them For Breakfast on Armadillo records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview by Michael Limnios\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat was the first gig you ever went to & what were the first songs you learned?\n\nAs a child I was taken by my parents to a Christmas pantomime where the special guests were Cliff Richard and the Shadows. I was aware of their music and, like a lot of youngsters who took up the guitar in the early 1960's, I was especially drawn to the playing of Hank Marvin. I went to private guitar lessons from the age of twelve, so the first tunes I learned to play where from guitar tutor books.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich was the best moment of your career and which was the worst?\n\nGetting my first gold album (Ready an'Willing - Whitesnake) was a great moment. Playing onstage with Eric Clapton was also special.\n\nThe worst was performing with Snafu at the huge Roosevelt Stadium in New Jersey supporting Emerson Lake & Palmer. It was the ugliest drink and drug-sodden atmosphere I have ever experienced. We should never have supported ELP, this was not our audience and our management were to blame. We had to leave the stage because of the abuse, and also to avoid the missiles that were thrown at us from a truly dystopian gathering.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you learn about yourself from music? What experiences in your life make you a GOOD musician?\n\nI believe the special 'something' that differentiates a good musician from a not-so-good musician is natural ability; you either have it or you don't. Practice, dedication, experience and inventiveness helps too!\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom whom have you have learned the most secrets about blues rock music & in which songs can someone hear the best of your work?\n\nI loved the Jeff Beck Group with Rod Stewart on vocals. They could take blues and soul songs and heavy them up, and some of their originals songs sounded very inspired. Beck played like nobody else, and still does. I'm also a fan of American guitarist Harvey Mandel, especially the stuff he did in the late 6o's-early 70's and, of course, Eric Clapton in Cream. Blues rock slide? Early Johnny Winter; Duane Allman; Lowell George; Ry Cooder; Zoot Horn Rollo; Sonny Landreth, and Glenn Ross Campbell's steel playing.\n\nI think I improved with age! Some of my best playing is on my solo albums 'I Eat Them For Breakfast' and 'Don't Blame Me'. I was more in control of my own destiny on those albums.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat characterizes your \u201cphilosophy\u201d about the music?\n\nI've always been fascinated by the number of different styles of music that you can coax from the guitar. I'm known primarily as an electric guitarist but I have always loved the natural sound of acoustic music. I've discovered a lot of open tunings throughout the years, and different types of right-hand picking techniques from pick and fingers, thumpick and fingers and flesh (no picks at all). In the last few years I have written and produced two instrumental albums: 'Acoustic Journeyman' and 'Electric Journeyman'. Although I've been involved in a lot of song writing over the years, playing the guitar is still my main passion. People sometimes ask me what is my favourite kind of music, and my answer is always \"Good music!\" If possible, always play the kind of music that stimulates your emotions, and try to keep an open mind.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy did you think that Micky Moody, continues to generate such a devoted following?\n\nI don't know if I have a devoted following! Maybe people appreciate that I've never been afraid to attempt different styles and that I try to express a range of emotions when I play.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the \u201cthing\u201d you miss most from the Tramline? Which memory from the Wildflowers makes you smile?\n\nTramline: I was only seventeen at the time, in great health with my whole life ahead of me. Yes, I miss that feeling! The Wildflowers: Traveling to London with the other three guys in an old van fitted-out with bunk beds; we were so dedicated!\n\n\n\n\n\nTell me about the beginning of Juicy Lucy. How did you get together and where did it start?\n\nJuicy Lucy's Singer Paul Williams had seen me perform in Tramline, Lucas and the Mike Cotton Sound and Zoot Money's band. He must have been impressed because when Neil Hubbard left Juicy Lucy to join the Grease Band he suggested me to the other guys. They were rehearsing at a house in the countryside so I went and rehearsed with them and got the job.\n\n\"I believe the special 'something' that differentiates a good musician from a not-so-good musician is natural ability; you either have it or you don't. Practice, dedication, experience and inventiveness helps too!\"\n\nWhat are some of the most memorable stories you've had from Juice Lucy?\n\nSoon after I joined Juicy Lucy we flew to the United States for a tour which lasted for nearly a month. It was my first time in America and suddenly I was looking at things and visiting places I'd only seen on television. New York: we played at the legendary Fillmore East supporting Cactus and Lee Michaels; visited Atlantic's famous recording studio where Roberts Flack was recording with some of the greatest session musicians in the US (including the great Bernard 'Pretty' Purdie on drums). The Fillmore West, San Francisco where we supported Elton John and The Kinks, and looking out on a warm November day at Alcatraz Prison and the San Francisco Bay. Los Angeles: two or three nights at the Whiskey A Go- Go, staying at the Tropicana Hotel - Californian groupies! Boston: two nights at the Boston Tea Party supporting Leon Russell and Elvin Bishop - both had great bands. Went to Chicago and Madison WN too.\n\nLots of touring, especially in Germany, and taking over as lead guitarist when members from the original line-up quit. It was all great experience!\n\n\n\n\n\nAny comments about your experiences with Chris Farlowe, Roger Chapman & Bernie Marsden? Would you like to tell your best memory about them?\n\nI was aware of Chris and Roger from my teens back in the north of England. Chris Farlowe and the Thunderbirds featured Albert Lee on guitar which was a real bonus for us guitar players. Tramline supported Family on a club date so I got see them live; Roger singing in that unusual fashion over very original-sounding songs. So it's been a thrill to actually work with them. Other great singers I've worked on stage with include Frankie Miller, Graham Bonnet, Gary Brooker, , Paul Rodgers in the Roadrunners/Wildflowers and David Coverdale in Whitesnake. Bernie and I developed a special understanding as dual guitarists, firstly with Whitesnake, then with the Moody Marsden Band. It had very little to do with Wishbone Ash or Thin Lizzie, and was influenced by the 60's British Blues players and American Southern Rockers like the Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd.\n\nWould you mind telling me your most vivid memory from Snafu?\n\nSee above! On a more positive note, recording the first album at the Manor Studios. We had a nice, tight funky thing going on in the early days.\n\n\"People sometimes ask me what is my favourite kind of music, and my answer is always \"Good music!\" If possible, always play the kind of music that stimulates your emotions, and try to keep an open mind.\"\n\nDo you remember anything interesting stories from Whitesnake?\n\nI have an incredible amount of interesting stories from my days with Whitesnake. How many weeks do you have to listen to them?!! It's impossible to pick out a few as there were so many. I had some of the best times of my life - it was the 70s, totally politically-incorrect, sexy and indulgent. That's all I'm saying!\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did you first meet John Mayall, do you remember anything interesting from touring with him?\n\nI was still in London after the breakup of the Wildflowers (1967) and Bruce Thomas, the bass player, discovered where John Mayall lived. Although I'd already decided that I would move back to my home town and spend some time studying the classical guitar, Bruce wanted to progress in the blues scene. We took the tube train to Paddington Station and walked a few blocks to Mayall's flat, which was at the top of a house close to the station. He had no idea who we were but was kind enough to invite us up to his flat, where his new guitarist Mick Taylor sat listening to blues albums. Bruce gave him his number for future reference and we had a nice cup of tea!\n\nI met him again the following year when Tramline supported his 'Crusade' band at the Marquee Club in London. In the spring of 1970, when I was playing with Zoot Money, we supported him and his drummer-less band on a number of shows on his British tour. His line-up was very odd: Jon Mark on nylon-strung guitar; Johnny Almond on Saxophones and Alex Dmochowski on bass. He seemed like quite a private, laid-back person.\n\n\"Being in a position to enjoy playing the guitar professionally, working with hundreds of talented people, writing songs and instrumentals pieces, and being able to afford good instruments.\"\n\nHow has the music business changed over the years since you first started in music?\n\nI was very lucky to have started my career in the Sixties and to have developed it in the Seventies. There was very little in the way of entertainment for the masses apart from music, TV (very limited those days) and film, and most people went to gigs and bought records. The opportunities were immense, unlike today were the public have so much choice, most of it available through the internet or multimedia. Recorded works and live performances were treated with respect and giving things for free, or worse, having them pirated, was rarely an option. I also think that, in some regards, technology has made the art of creating and performing music too accessible and instantaneous. If utilized correctly technology can be put to good use, but practice and dedication to one's instrument will always produce the better musician.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do you think that the blues doesn\u2019t quite get the recognition and respect that other genres seem to get? Give one wish for the BLUES\n\nI'm not sure I agree with your opinion! I think that after pop and rock, blues is one of the most accepted forms of music to be embraced by a wide audience. Long may the Blues continue!\n\n\"I would give more thought to the business side of things; there are a lot of smiling assassins out there who have no second thoughts about taking things that do not belong to them - usually money.\"\n\nWith such an illustrious career, what has given you the most satisfaction musically?\n\nBeing in a position to enjoy playing the guitar professionally, working with hundreds of talented people, writing songs and instrumentals pieces, and being able to afford good instruments.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference and similarity between the LIVE/GIG and the STUDIO feeling? And between your session projects, solo albums and the band\u2019s recording?\n\nThere's obviously a big difference between playing live and playing in a recording studio; some people excel in one and struggle with the other. I think that for most people, playing live is their raison d'etre, whilst the recording studio is a workshop within which you can create. I've been lucky enough to have had a lot of experience in both, some experiences turning out better than others. Playing live, there is (hopefully) an atmosphere created by both performers and audience, whereas you have to create an atmosphere in a studio - and concentrate - you have to live with the results!\n\nI'm in control of my own projects so I'm responsible for the outcome. On sessions you have to try and make the artist/producer comfortable and pleased with your efforts. I'm involved in a new band called Snakecharmer and we're all very experienced - watch out for us!\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there any memories from the US tour \u201cBest of British Blues\u201d, which you\u2019d like to share with us?\n\nUnfortunately the 'Best of British Blues' tour of 1996 was memorable for the wrong reasons. The line-up consisted of featured artists Eric Burdon and Alvin Lee, and the band was Aynsley Dunbar, Boz Burrell, Tim Hinkley and myself. I don't like to talk ill of the dead, but Boz created problems right from the first gig; he was unhappy with the promoter and seemed uncomfortable with the personnel. Halfway through the tour he went to pieces and couldn't continue, so Aynsley suggested Tony Franklin who'd played with bass with The Firm (Paul Rodgers/Jimmy Page). The band then seemed to split into two camps: Burdon, Dunbar and Franklin, and Lee, Hinkley and Moody. Eric Burdon thought that his guitarist should come to the House of Blues in L.A. and perform on stage with us just to show me how it should be done! What a fucking insult! Alvin sensed the vibes and a couple of gigs later he booked a plane home. We didn't even finish the tour. There were some good moments, but overall, definitely one to forget!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you go back to the past what things you would do better and what things you would avoid to do again?\n\nI would give more thought to the business side of things; there are a lot of smiling assassins out there who have no second thoughts about taking things that do not belong to them - usually money.\n\n\n\nMicky Moody - Official website\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/4039868", "page_content": "Michael Joseph \"Micky\" Moody (born 30 August 1950) is an English guitarist, and a former member of the rock bands Juicy Lucy and Whitesnake. He was also a founder-member of Snafu. Together with his former Whitesnake colleague Bernie Marsden he founded the Moody Marsden Band, and later, The Snakes. Along with Marsden and ex-Whitesnake bassist, Neil Murray, he formed Company of Snakes and M3 Classic Whitesnake with which they mainly performed early Whitesnake songs. From 2010 he has been working with Murray, guitarist Laurie Wisefield, drummer Harry James, singer Chris Ousey and keyboard player Michael Bramwell in Monsters of British Rock which has morphed into Snakecharmer with Adam Wakeman on keyboards.\n\nBesides this, Moody has also toured with Roger Chapman, Frankie Miller and Chris Farlowe. He has also worked alongside the likes of Eric Clapton, Alvin Lee, Mick Taylor, Bruce Dickinson, Sam Brown, Gary Brooker, Suggs, Dennis Locorriere, Paul Jones, PP Arnold, James Hunter, Rick Wakeman, Jon Lord, Newton Faulkner and Uriah Heep. For TV he has also accompanied such stars as Meat Loaf, Boy George, Elkie Brooks, Nona Hendryx, Ben E. King and one of his early guitar heroes, Duane Eddy. Since 2000 he has released several solo albums: I Eat Them For Breakfast (2000), Don't Blame Me (2006), Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009).[1] A versatile guitarist, Moody has been an active session musician and his own website lists over 100 albums to which he has contributed musically. 2006 saw the release of the autobiographical Playing With Trumpets - A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship, a memoir about his early days on the music scene.[2] His media music has been featured on such TV programmes as Waking the Dead, Bo Selecta, America's Next Top Model, How To Look Good Naked, Top Gear, Mad Men and Wife Swap USA.\n\nBiography\n\n1960s\n\nWhile still at school in Middlesbrough and regularly attending private guitar lessons, Moody formed a band named The RoadRunners with several other local boys including Paul Rodgers (later to form Free and Bad Company), and later, Bruce Thomas, who would eventually play bass with Elvis Costello and the Attractions. The band were kept busy performing a range of covers in local halls and clubs. By 1967 they had developed and outgrown the local music scene so they took the decision to turn professional, change their name to the Wildflowers, and move to London. They had some success and undertook some touring, but relationships within the band frayed and they eventually split without ever releasing any recordings. Moody returned home to Middlesbrough where for a while he widened his musical horizons by taking classical guitar lessons. He also became increasingly interested in slide guitar techniques (a style he would later be closely associated with). While living in Middlesbrough he was asked by local singer and entrepreneur, John McCoy, to form a group which became Tramline. A deal for two albums was signed with Island Records, but by the time the second album was released the band had already split and gone their separate ways. At this point Moody joined Lucas and the Mike Cotton Sound who, as well as proving to be a highly-polished Soul band, also acted as Gene Pitney's backing band for his UK tours as well as backing others, such as Paul Jones.[3][4]\n\n1970s\n\nIn 1970 he joined the recently re-patriated Zoot Money before replacing Neil Hubbard in Juicy Lucy. As a member of Juicy Lucy, he recorded three albums and toured extensively before the group disbanded. After the band split, Micky co-founded Snafu which combined his funk-rock guitar style with some down-home stateside grooves. The band recorded three albums - SNAFU, Situation Normal, and All Funked Up. They also appeared on a John Peel session, the Old Grey Whistle Test and Supersonic and toured extensively before the individual members headed off to pursue different ventures. Moody undertook occasional work as a session player before, during and after Snafu, most notably for Graham Bonnett. He also contributed to one track on City to City by Gerry Rafferty. Moody performed as an original member of Status Quo drummer John Coghlan's Diesel Band, then recorded an album with the band's tour manager and lyricist, Bob Young. The result was Young & Moody. He then toured with Frankie Miller and guested with Hinkley's Heroes before hooking up with another friend from the North East, David Coverdale. Micky had known Coverdale from the local music scene in the Middlesbrough area in the late sixties, but by this point Coverdale had been fronting Deep Purple and was looking to undertake a solo venture. He invited Moody to assist and the result was the album White Snake released in 1977 which was followed by a second album Northwinds in 1978. Moody shared writing credits on four of the nine songs on Whitesnake (including the title track) and three of the eight songs featured on Northwinds. With the demise of Deep Purple MkIV, Coverdale and Moody joined forces with Bernie Marsden, Neil Murray, Dave 'Duck' Dowle and keyboardist Brian Johnston (replaced after a few months by Pete Solley) to form a band that took its name Whitesnake from the title of Coverdale's first solo album. In 1978 they recorded the EP Snakebite followed by two Studio albums: Trouble (also in 1978) and Lovehunter (1979) which were recorded by a modified line up with Jon Lord on keyboards. Moody is credited with co-writing four of the ten tracks on Trouble, and was sole author of a fifth (the lively instrumental, Belgian Tom's Hat Trick). He contributed to three of the ten songs on Lovehunter, most notably the title track. While working with Whitesnake he found time to play slide guitar on several tracks on Roger Chapman's debut solo album, Chappo.\n\n1980s\n\n\n\nCourtesy: Andrew King Bernie Marsden (left) and Micky Moody; at Hammersmith Odeon, in 1981Courtesy: Andrew King\n\nMoody contributed slide guitar to three tracks on Ex-Lindisfarne Ray Jackson's solo debut In the Night released in 1980. By this point Whitesnake now featured Ian Paice from Deep Purple on drums, who had been brought into the group to replace Dowle. In 1980 this line up released the album Ready an' Willing, which spawned two UK single hits in the form of Fool for your Loving and the album title track; Moody co-wrote both tracks. The band also released the double album Live...in the Heart of the City in that year. He also found time to write and record two singles with Bob Young. In 1981 Graham Bonnet released his album Line-Up which featured Moody playing guitar on all tracks and also featured three songs written by Moody in partnership with Bob Young. Micky maintained a busy schedule with Whitesnake and the band released the album Come an' Get It that year. Relationships within the band were beginning to sour and Moody's guitar partner Bernie Marsden left prior to the final completion of the next album Saints and Sinners. Moody himself followed soon after. The band was put on hold for much of 1982 and Moody undertook some session work, for the likes of Sheena Easton. By late 1982 Whitesnake were back, (with Mel Galley replacing Marsden), and a re-juvinated Moody joining Galley on the album's backing vocal sessions. Going into 1983, Coverdale replaced Ian Paice and Neil Murray with Cozy Powell and Colin Hodgkinson. However Micky was not particularly happy with the direction the new band was taking and felt increasingly sidelined by Coverdale.[5] Despite the deteriorating situation within Whitesnake, Moody persevered with recording the Slide It In album (which he describes as an 'unhappy experience' ) before quitting the band in 1983 at the end of a tour.[1] Moody went back to session work with a series of artists including Mike Oldfield, Gary Glitter, Mike d'Abo, and Roger Chapman as well as selected TV work. He toured with Chris Farlowe and also worked with ex-Meal Ticket singer Willy Finlayson and his band the Hurters. Taking a wry, yet witty view on some of the people and experiences they'd encountered over the years, he got together with Bob Young to write a book on musician's humour, the acclaimed Language Of Rock And Roll. He also put together the first version of the Micky Moody Band featuring ex-Taste bassist Charlie McCracken and drummer Chris Hunt. Towards the end of the decade he and Bernie Marsden played selected venues with the their own Moody Marsden Band.\n\n1990s\n\nDuring the early part of the 1990s, Moody toured extensively with Roger Chapman before re-uniting on a more permanent basis with his erstwhile Whitesnake guitarist-in-crime, Bernie Marsden, to tour and record with the Moody Marsden Band, concentrating mostly on the British and western European markets. Featured in various line-ups were drummers Zak Starkey, Terry Williams, John Trotter, Henry Spinetti and Dave Dowle; bass players Jaz Lochrie, Pete Stroud, Steve Price, Neil Murray and David Levy, and keyboard players Don Ariey and Josh Phillips. Guests in the studio included harmonica player Mark Feltham, keyboard player Volker 'Wolfman' Kunschner, brass players Nick Pentelow, Frank Mead and Martin Drover, and backing singers Monica Reed-Price and Mick Lister. The Moody Marsden Band recorded two live albums, Never Turn Our Back On the Blues and Live In Hell and a studio set, Real Faith. In 1996, Moody toured the USA as part of the Best of British Blues tour which also featured Alvin Lee, Eric Burdon, Aynsley Dunbar, Boz Burrell and Tim Hinkley. The following year, Moody and Marsden teamed up with Norwegian rockers Jorn Lande, Willy Bendickson and Sid Ringsby to form The Snakes, a band that specialised in re-producing the sounds of the original Whitesnake. Don Airey would often be brought in to augment them on keyboards. The band recorded two albums, Once Bitten and Live in Europe before making way for The Company of Snakes, which featured in its line up former Bad Company vocalist Robert Hart, original Whitesnake bass player Neil Murray and ex-Manfred Mann's Earth Band drummer John Lingwood. Hart was eventually replaced by ex-Snakes in Paradise frontman Steffan Berggren, and the band released two albums, Burst the Bubble and a live set, Here They Go Again.\n\n2000s\n\nIn 2000, Micky wrote and produced media music prior to the release of his first official solo album, I Eat Them For Breakfast. Whilst continuing to perform with Company Of Snakes and take on occasional session work, Moody joined his former Juicy Lucy bandmate Paul Williams[6] to arrange and record a selection of classic Chicago blues tracks in a mostly 'unplugged' fashion; the result was Smokestacks, Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men. He also started to play occasional gigs in a duo format with bluesman Papa George, and continues to do so. The next 'Snake' metamorphosis was into M3 Classic Whitesnake, and although ex-Black Sabbath singer Tony Martin was in the starting line-up, Stefan Berggren was soon back in the frontman's spot. M3 released a live CD featuring Martin, and a live DVD featuring Berggren with a guest appearance from former Richie Blackmore and Yngwie Malmsteen frontman Doogie White. Also featured in this line-up were ex-Paul Rodgers Band, Go West and Tears for Fears drummer Jimmy Copley and keyboard player Mark Stanway from Magnum.\n\nAround this time, Moody played on the album Nah Aufnahme by German superstar Westernhagen, which eventually topped the national charts. 2006 saw the release of Moody's self-produced solo album Don't Blame Me in tandem with the autobiographical Playing with Trumpets - A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship, the latter recounting his early days in the music business, mostly in the company of Paul Rodgers. M3 broke up later that year, after which Moody performed more shows with Roger Chapman plus selected dates with a line-up of the Micky Moody Band that featured his eldest son Micky Moody Jr. on drums. In 2008 he toured Japan as special guest of Jimmy Copley and Japanese guitar legend Char. Also featured was ex-Herbie Hancock bassist Paul Jackson and keyboard wizard Yoshinobu Kojima. The shows were recorded and released on DVD as Jimmy Copley & Char: Special Session. To celebrate his love of instrumental music, Micky wrote and produced Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009).\n\n2010s\n\nIn 2011, Moody co-wrote library music for both Warner/Chapell and Universal before forming Snakecharmer with Neil Murray, also formerly of Whitesnake and The Company of Snakes.\n\nDiscography\n\nWith Tramline\n\n1968 Somewhere Down The Line\n\n1969 Moves of Vegetable Centuries\n\nWith Juicy Lucy\n\n1970 Lie Back and Enjoy It\n\n1971 Get a Whiff a This\n\n1972 Pieces\n\nWith Snafu\n\n1973 SNAFU (album)\n\n1974 Situation Normal\n\n1975 All Funked Up\n\nWith The Moody Marsden Band\n\n1992 Never Turn Our Back On The Blues\n\n1994 live In Hell\n\n1994 The Time Is Right For Live\n\n1994 Real Faith\n\n2000 The Night the Guitars Came to Play\n\nWith Bob Young\n\n1977 Young and Moody\n\n1995 The Nearest Hits Album\n\n2010 Back for the Last Time Again\n\nWith David Coverdale\n\n1977 White Snake\n\n1978 Northwinds\n\n2003 The Early Years\n\nWith Whitesnake\n\nWith The Snakes, Company of Snakes & M3\n\n1998 Once Bitten (Japan)\n\n(Japan) 1998 Live in Europe\n\n2001 Here They Go Again\n\n2002 Burst The Bubble\n\n2005 Classic Snake Live\n\n2005 Rough An' Ready (live album, CD)\n\n(live album, CD) 2007 Rough An' Ready (live album, DVD)\n\nSolo\n\n2000 I Eat Them For Breakfast\n\n2002 Smokestacks Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men (with Paul Williams)\n\n(with Paul Williams) 2006 Don't Blame Me\n\n2007 Acoustic Journeyman\n\n2008 Live and Rocking! - Live at the Hell Blues Festival 2000 (Micky Moody & Friends)\n\n(Micky Moody & Friends) 2009 Electric Journeyman\n\nGuest appearances\n\n1969 You Can All Join In (VA)\n\n(VA) 1970 Zoot Money (Zoot Money)\n\n(Zoot Money) 1973 In Memory of Robert Johnson (Paul Williams)\n\n(Paul Williams) 1973 I Never Got (Tony Kelly)\n\n(Tony Kelly) 1973 Manor Live (VA)\n\n(VA) 1973 Me and My Friend (Patrick Campbell Lyons)\n\n(Patrick Campbell Lyons) 1974 Funkist (Bobby Harrison)\n\n(Bobby Harrison) 1975 Squire (Alan Hull)\n\n(Alan Hull) 1975 Legend (Mickey Jupp)\n\n(Mickey Jupp) 1977 Graham Bonnet (Graham Bonnet)\n\n(Graham Bonnet) 1977 Fancy That (Joanna Carlin)\n\n(Joanna Carlin) 1977 City to City (Gerry Rafferty)\n\n(Gerry Rafferty) 1979 Chappo (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1981 Line Up (Graham Bonnet)\n\n(Graham Bonnet) 1982 Riff Burglars (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1982 Music Money And Madness (Sheena Easton)\n\n(Sheena Easton) 1986 In Quo Country (Bob Young)\n\n(Bob Young) 1987 Islands (Mike Oldfield)\n\n(Mike Oldfield) 1987 Party Album (Gary Glitter)\n\n(Gary Glitter) 1987 Reaching Out (Paul Millns)\n\n(Paul Millns) 1987 Indestructible (Mike D'Abo)\n\n(Mike D'Abo) 1987 No Angel (Sanne Salomonsen)\n\n(Sanne Salomonsen) 1988 New Day (Jane Harrison)\n\n(Jane Harrison) 1989 Walking The Cat (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1990 Hybrid and Lowdown (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1991 Blue-Eyed Slide (Brian Knight)\n\n(Brian Knight) 1992 Parlour Games (John Spencer)\n\n(John Spencer) 1992 Blues Brittania (VA)\n\n(VA) 1992 Waiting In The Wings (Chris Farlowe)\n\n(Chris Farlowe) 1992 Very Much Alive (Willy Finlayson and The Hurters)\n\n(Willy Finlayson and The Hurters) 1993 Midnight Postcards (Adam Faith)\n\n(Adam Faith) 1994 Tellin' Stories (Walter Trout)\n\n(Walter Trout) 1994 Line Up (Borderline)\n\n(Borderline) 1995 Together (Peter Smith)\n\n(Peter Smith) 1995 Green and Blues (Bernie Marsden)\n\n(Bernie Marsden) 1996 Kiss My Soul (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1996 Blue Thunder (Blue Thunder)\n\n(Blue Thunder) 1998 Pinboard Wizards (Jackie Lynton)\n\n(Jackie Lynton) 2000 Here After (Jamie Marshall)\n\n(Jamie Marshall) 2000 Gimme All Your Topp (VA)\n\n(VA) 2000 Snakebites (VA)\n\n(VA) 2000 Glory Bound (Chris Farlowe)\n\n(Chris Farlowe) 2001 Another Hair Of the Dog (VA)\n\n(VA) 2001 Tam de ti ye...

He was also a founder-member of Snafu. Together with his former Whitesnake colleague Bernie Marsden he founded the Moody Marsden Band, and later, The Snakes, having previously collaborated with unofficial 5th Status Quo member Bob Young in Young & Moody. Along with Marsden and ex-Whitesnake bassist, Neil Murray, he formed The Company of Snakes and M3 Classic Whitesnake with which they mainly performed early Whitesnake songs. From 2011 to 2015, Moody toured and recorded with Snakecharmer, a band he co-formed.\n\nBesides this, Moody has also toured with Roger Chapman, Frankie Miller and Chris Farlowe. He has also performed live alongside the likes of Eric Clapton, Alvin Lee, Mick Taylor, Bruce Dickinson, Sam Brown, Gary Brooker, Suggs, Dennis Locorriere, Paul Jones, P. P.

His library music has been featured on such TV programmes as Waking the Dead, Bo' Selecta!, America's Next Top Model, How to Look Good Naked, Top Gear, Horizon, Jersey Shore, Mad Men, Wife Swap and Paul Hollywood's Bread.[citation needed] More recently Micky has worked alongside Ali Maas Moody and they have co-written and released two albums, Black & Chrome and Who's Directing Your Movie?\n\nYouTube Encyclopedic\n\n1 / 5 Views: 2 300 942 329 818 4 308 3 962\n\nMicky Moody - A Taste For Bourbon\n\nMicky Moody [All information in the comments]\u200e\n\nRelaxing Whiskey Blues Music - Best Of Slow Blues - Fantastic Electric Guitar Blues\n\nJuicy Lucy - Who Do You Love (1971) (MIcky Moody)\n\nMicky Moody - My Lady Friend Transcription\n\nBiography\n\n1960s\n\nWhile at school in Middlesbrough and attending private guitar lessons, Moody formed The Roadrunners with others from the area including Paul Rodgers (later of Free and Bad Company). They were subsequently joined by bass player Bruce Thomas, later to play with Elvis Costello and the Attractions. The band performed covers in local halls and clubs. By 1967 they had developed and outgrown the local music scene and turned professional, changing their name to The Wildflowers and subsequently moving to London. They had some success and undertook some touring, but relationships within the band frayed and they eventually split without making any recordings. Moody returned home to Middlesbrough where for a while he widened his musical horizons by taking classical guitar lessons. He also became increasingly interested in slide guitar techniques (a style he would later be closely associated with). While living in Middlesbrough he was asked by local singer and entrepreneur John McCoy, to form a group which became Tramline. A deal for two albums was signed with Island Records, but by the time the second album was released the band had broken up. Moody joined Lucas and the professional Soul band Mike Cotton Sound who became Gene Pitney's backing band for UK tours as well as others such as Paul Jones.[3][4]\n\n1970s\n\nIn 1970 he joined recently re-patriated keyboard player Zoot Money as guitarist. He then replaced Neil Hubbard in Juicy Lucy with whom he recorded three albums and toured extensively before the group disbanded. After the band split, Moody co-founded Snafu which combined his funk-rock guitar style with U.S down-home stateside grooves. The band recorded three albums SNAFU, Situation Normal and All Funked Up. They also appeared on a John Peel The Old Grey Whistle Test session and the T.V series Supersonic. Extensive touring followed before the band broke up. At this time Moody undertook occasional work as a session player most notably for Graham Bonnet. He also contributed to one track on Gerry Rafferty's City to City. He performed with the former Status Quo drummer John Coghlan's Diesel Band, then recorded an album with the band's tour manager and lyricist Bob Young which became Young & Moody. He then toured with Frankie Miller and stood in as a guest with Hinkley's Heroes before joining his friend David Coverdale. Moody knew Coverdale \u2013 who had fronted Deep Purple and was looking to undertake a solo venture \u2013 from the Middlesbrough music scene in the late sixties. Coverdale invited Moody to work with him and the album White Snake was released in 1977. Moody shared writing credits on four songs including the title track. A second album Northwinds followed in 1978, on which Moody contributed to three songs. Following the demise of Deep Purple MkIV, Coverdale and Moody joined forces with Bernie Marsden, Neil Murray, Dave 'Duck' Dowle and keyboardist Brian Johnston to form a band that took its name Whitesnake from the title of Coverdale's first solo album. In 1978 they recorded the E.P Snakebite followed by two studio albums, Trouble (1978) and Lovehunter (1979), recorded by a modified lineup with Jon Lord on keyboards. Moody is credited with cowriting four of the tracks on Trouble and was sole writer of 'Belgian Tom's Hat Trick', an instrumental. While working with Whitesnake he also played slide guitar on Roger Chapman's debut solo album Chappo.[citation needed]\n\n1980s\n\nMoody contributed slide guitar to three tracks on former Lindisfarne member Ray Jackson's solo debut In the Night, which was released in 1980. By this point Whitesnake now featured Ian Paice from Deep Purple on drums, who had been brought into the group to replace Dowle. In 1980 this line up released the album Ready an' Willing, from which two UK singles were taken, Fool for Your Loving and the album title track, both co-written by Moody. The band also released the double album Live...in the Heart of the City in the same year. At his time he recorded two singles with Bob Young, with all tracks written by Moody.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1981, Graham Bonnet's Line-Up featured Moody playing guitar on all tracks and three songs written by Moody with Bob Young. Moody maintained a busy schedule with Whitesnake and the band released the album Come an' Get Itin the same year. Relationships within the band were beginning to sour and Moody's guitar partner Bernie Marsden left prior to the final completion of the next album Saints and Sinners. Moody himself followed soon after. Whitesnake took time out for much of 1982 and Moody undertook some session work, with Sheena Easton and others.[citation needed] By late 1982 Whitesnake was reformed with Mel Galley replacing Marsden and Moody joining Galley on the album's backing vocal sessions. In 1983 Coverdale replaced Ian Paice and Neil Murray with Cozy Powell and Colin Hodgkinson. Moody was unhappy with the direction the new band was taking and felt increasingly sidelined by Coverdale.[5] Despite this deteriorating situation, he recorded Slide It In \u2013 a process he described as an 'unhappy experience' \u2013 but then left the band in 1983.[1]\n\nMoody returned to session work with Mike Oldfield, Gary Glitter, Mike d'Abo and Roger Chapman, as well as selected TV music library work. He toured with Chris Farlowe and worked with former Meal Ticket singer Willy Finlayson and his band the Hurters. Taking a wry, witty view of some of the people and experiences they'd encountered over the years, he and Bob Young wrote a book on musicians' humour, the acclaimed Language of Rock and Roll. He also put together the first version of the Micky Moody Band, featuring former Taste bassist Charlie McCracken and drummer Chris Hunt. Towards the end of the decade, he and Bernie Marsden played selected venues with their own Moody Marsden Band.[citation needed]\n\n1990s\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Moody toured extensively with Roger Chapman. \"What a bloke,\" marvelled the singer. \"Every hotel we stayed in, he used to get his black bin-liners out and start taping them to the windows \u2013 can't sleep if there's any light in the room. They used to think he was mad. Lovely fella though. A great guitarist. And intelligent too. Too intelligent for Coverdale.\"[6]\n\nMoody reunited on a more permanent basis with Whitesnake guitarist Bernie Marsden, to tour and record as the Moody Marsden Band in U.K and Europe. They issued two live albums, Never Turn Our Back on the Blues and Live in Hell and a studio set, Real Faith. In 1996, Moody toured the US as part of the Best of British Blues tour, also featuring Eric Burdon, Alvin Lee, Aynsley Dunbar, Boz Burrell and Tim Hinkley. The following year, Moody and Marsden teamed up with Norwegian rockers J\u00f8rn Lande, Willy Bendickson and Sid Ringsby to form The Snakes, a band that specialised in reproducing the sounds of the original Whitesnake. Don Airey would often be brought in to augment them on keyboards. The band recorded two albums, Once Bitten and Live in Europe before making way for The Company of Snakes, which featured former Bad Company vocalist Robert Hart, original Whitesnake bass player Neil Murray and ex-Manfred Mann's Earth Band drummer John Lingwood. Hart was eventually replaced by ex-Snakes in Paradise frontman Stefan Berggren, and the band released two albums, Burst the Bubble and a live set Here They Go Again.[citation needed]\n\n2000s\n\nIn 2000, Micky wrote and produced library music prior to the release of his first official solo album, I Eat Them For Breakfast. Continuing to perform with Company of Snakes and take on occasional session work, Moody joined his former Juicy Lucy bandmate Paul Williams[7] to arrange and record a selection of acoustic classic Chicago blues tracks for the album Smokestacks, Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men. He also played occasional duo gigs with bluesman Papa George.[citation needed] 'Snake' metamorphosed into M3 Classic Whitesnake and also released a live CD (featuring former Black Sabbath singer Tony Martin) and a live DVD with the former The Company Of Snakes singer Stefan Berggren back, and with the special guest appearance from former Ritchie Blackmore and Yngwie Malmsteen frontman Doogie White. The DVD also featured sessionman Jimmy Copley (who worked with bands such as Go West and Tears for Fears) on drums and Mark Stanway from Magnum on the keyboards.\n\nAround this time Moody played on Nah Aufnahme by German musician Westernhagen, which eventually appeared in the national charts. 2006 saw the release of Moody's self-produced solo album Don't Blame Me, released at the same time as his memoirs Playing with Trumpets \u2013 A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship. M3 broke up later that year, after which Moody performed more shows with Roger Chapman plus selected dates with a line-up of the Micky Moody Band that featured his eldest son Micky Moody Jr. on drums. In 2008 he toured Japan as special guest of Jimmy Copley and Japanese guitar legend Char. Also featured was ex-Herbie Hancock bassist Paul Jackson and keyboard wizard Yoshinobu Kojima. The shows were recorded and released on DVD as Jimmy Copley & Char: Special Session. To celebrate his love of instrumental music, Micky wrote and produced the albums Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009).\n\n2010s\n\nIn 2011, Moody co-wrote library music for both Warner/Chapell and Universal before co-forming Snakecharmer, a line up which also includes former Whitesnake colleague Neil Murray, former Wishbone Ash guitarist Laurie Wisefield, singer Chris Ousey (Heartland), drummer Gary James (Thunder, Magnum) and Ozzy's keyboardist Adam Wakeman. In 2015, Moody left \"Snakecharmer\" to pursue his solo career.

The band recorded three albums between 1973-76 and also featured the talents of keyboard player Pete Solley, also later to make an appearance in an early incarnation of Whitesnake. Although critically well recieved, commercial success was to evade the band despite successfull tours with The Doobie Brothers(Europe) and The Eagles(USA). A tour of Germany supporting the 'lost classic' All Funked Up, was to be the end of the road. It was then that a certain David Coverdale enlisted Micky to help co-write and play all guitars on his solo albums, Whitesnake and Northwinds. This led to what most people now refer to as the classic Whitesnake line-up during which time Micky toured extensively world-wide acquiring many gold discs and some long overdue recognition. Key albums of this early period are Live...In The Heart Of The City and the glorius Ready An' Willing, which perfectly capture the band in full flow with Bernie Marsden's guitar proving to be a perfect complement to Micky's. A tired and uninspired Micky first quit the band in late 1981 during sessions for the Saints and Sinners album (largely because the group's musical success had not translated into monetary success). The band effectively ceased to exist at this point as DC sorted out managerial issues. However, a year later Micky was persuaded to rejoin the band to finish off the aforementioned Saints and Sinners album. With the band no longer incorporating Ian Paice, Neil Murray, or Bernie Marsden, the recently married Micky found himself increasingly isolated from his bandmates. This isolation was not just social it was also musical with drummer Cozy Powell signalling the start of a heavier and more image conscious era for the band. Micky's final contribution was to be the Slide It In album; check out the fantastic co-write Slow an' Easy. In 1983 things came to an unfortunate head during a tour with Thin Lizzy where DC allegedly humiliated him in front of Lizzy and future 'Snake guitarist John Sykes. Micky gathered the band together (with the notable absence of Mr Coverdale who was 'busy') and resigned. By now Micky's reputation as a player was well known and session work was to follow; Graham Bonnet, Frankie Miller, Chris Farlowe, Sheena Easton, Roger Chapman, Elkie Brookes and Eric Burdon all benefitted from his guitar work. American artists such as Meat Loaf, Ben E. King, and Walter Trout enlisted the skills of this multi talented player who also found work in T.V. commercials and film scores. Over the years Micky has toured extensively and released four albums with his old 'Snake partner Bernie Marsden under the Moody Marsden Band monicker. The pair have also tapped into their Whitesnake legacy over the years with The Snakes and The Company of Snakes, also featuring former 'Snake bass player Neil Murray. This ultimately resulted in the M3-Classic Whitesnake band, also featuring singer Stefan Berggren, keyboard player Mark Stanway (Magnum), and drummer Jimmy Copley (Paul Rodgers Band, Tears For Fears, Go West). It wasn't until 2000 that Micky released his first, and long overdue, solo album I Eat Them For Breakfast. Soon after, he teamed up with singer Paul Williams(Juicy Lucy) to celebrate the music of Howlin\u0092 Wolf, Elmore James and Muddy Waters, for the Smokestacks, Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men album. The future seems to suggest more solo albums from this versatile and highly respected player, including a foray into a more acoustic driven direction.

David Coverdale, even though he is a great singer, frontman, songwriter and driving force, has always depended on his fellow musicians, first division players and songwriters, to maintain the high standards he refuses to drop. Coverdale once said \"as the captain of HMS Whitesnake, I don't want any passengers\". Coverdale is apparently a tough taskmaster. Some will accuse him of changing the line-up the way most people like to change their underwear. Anyway, you can't argue with the fact that he's good at picking the right people; the guy has worked with some of the best hard rock musicians on the planet, Ian Paice, Jon Lord, Neil Murray, John Sykes, Micky Moody, Bernie Marsden, Rudy Sarzo, Tommy Aldridge, Cozy Powell, Vivian Campbell, Steve Vai, Denny Carmassi etc. In Part One we talk to Micky Moody, the great guitar hero - the slide guitarist from hell and one of the talented songwriters in one of the classic line-ups with songs like Fool For Your Loving, Here I Go Again, Don't Break My Heart Again, Lovehunter to their credit.\n\nIt is only natural to introduce Micky Moody and Bernie Marsden together. After all, they were always like a pair, and along with David Coverdale, the creative force in the original Whitesnake. The old fans looked up to them, just as much as the highly regarded partnership of Brian Robertson and Scott Gorham from Thin Lizzy. Judging from the audience responses in the early eighties, Micky's slide solo was like a good seduction. It was like seeing the master of the art at work. The way the slide guitar was integrated, was a huge part of the Whitesnake sound. Bernie was his axeman partner in crime. It was impossible not to love the intensity of their 'guitar wars'. Bernie and Micky's knowledge, instinctive feeling of the blues, the way they combined it with the punch and power of rock, their memorable, melodic solos, song writing talents and harmony vocals, made for some glorious moments together on the first six Whitesnake albums, Trouble (78), Lovehunter (79), Ready An' Willing (80), Live In The Heart Of The City (81), Come And Get It (81) and Saints And Sinners (82). The original concept of Whitesnake had more in common with rhythm 'n' blues than heavy metal, the band was founded on a heritage of Muddy Waters, Bobby Bland, John Lee Hooker, Robert Johnson, the English blues from the sixties etc. Ready And Willing, Live In the Heart Of The City, Come And Get It and Saints And Sinners, featured the definitive, classic Whitesnake line-up, David Coverdale, Jon Lord, Ian Paice, Bernie Marsden, Micky Moody and Neil Murray. This line-up firmly established them in Europe, information which might surprise people who regarded Whitesnake as an overnight success in the late eighties. Bernie will always say, 'It's all their fault, once you've worked with players of that class, it's hard to adapt to anything else'. Even though Bernie and Micky are still playing like their lives are depending on it in the band 'The Snakes', together with Jorn Lande, a very talented Norwegian singer who sings exactly like David Coverdale (Jorn sounds like Ronnie James Dio not DC IMHO - Webmaster) and Don Airey, the legendary keyboard player and maestro who has played together with 'everybody', Ozzy Osbourne, Rainbow, Gary Moore, Uli Roth and the list goes on...'The Snakes are doing a mix of the classic Whitesnake songs, and new material in the same style. It seems like they will be injecting a bit of classic into rock 'n roll again with new material in a forthcoming studio album along with new material in an upcoming live album. Bernie and Micky have always stayed true to their roots in Moody Marsden Band. Check out their album The Time Is Right For Live, which is fifty percent acoustic, fifty percent electric, and the inside information of two men on a mission. Bernie made a tribute album to Peter Green called Green In Blues, the ultimate labour of love, and we'll get back to Bernie Marsden in part 2, but for now, here's my conversation with the one and only Micky Moody.\n\nI know you and David Coverdale go back a long way. What was your relationship like in the early days?\n\nIn 1968 I was living in Middlesborough in the North East of England. David is from nearby, and I was in a top professional local band who had made a few records. I got to know him then and he started singing in a few local bands. I think one of them was called The Dead Of A Mule (Denver Mule, Ann). One was like a soul band, one was a rock band. I remember the first time I heard him sing, he was obviously a great singer. David hadn't found his style by then, he wasn't singing that much rock stuff, he wasn't as raunchy, but he had a very good pitch, and a very distinctive, full and strong voice. He would sing the Walker Brothers songs. David could sing like Scott Walker. He could sing like a lot of people and I think he didn't have his own style until later. David admired David Clayton Thomas from the band Blood Sweat And Tears, Robert Plant and Paul Rogers. I think blues is something he got into by listening to Jimmy Hendrix. We used to meet at lunchtimes in a coffee bar called The Purple Onion, where the musicians used to hang out. In '69 I moved to London. About three or four of us who were from the same area, musicians and a couple of roadies, suddenly got a call from David in '74, to go to a Holiday Inn. David was leaving the country to go and live in California with Deep Purple, so we had a party that night, and he was a little bit apprehensive and afraid about leaving and going to America, so he wanted to be with his friends I think. David got drunk, he got a lot of brandy, a lot of Jack Daniel's and what have you..., and then I didn't stay in touch with him until he called me up in '76 and said 'I'm gonna make a solo album, would you like to play on it?' We got together and I could see he really wanted to leave Deep Purple. There was too much going on, internal problems in the 'Purple camp. Deep Purple were playing at Wembley Arena in London. It seemed odd, he seemed to walk on and off the stage. I thought 'Something is not right here'. He preferred to be with his future wife Julia, myself and my girlfriend at the time. After the gig he got his tour manager to look for me and we just left, he didn't speak to any of the others in Deep Purple. I don't know what was going on David just said 'Come on, let's get out'. He was under a lot of pressure. David wanted to leave the band, he was pretty highly strung, intense, lonely and upset. I think being with me, he could be very normal and silly, which was good for him to relax and just forget all the pressure because it must have been an immense pressure to go from a small band in the North East of England to Deep Purple, one of the biggest bands in the world. I think Whitesnake was an outlet for him to avoid all the ego problems that occurred in Purple.\n\nMe and David became friends again, and I went to stay with him in Germany, we ended up getting very close, we hadn't been that close as friends before. We became MATES.\n\nWhat was the original concept of Whitesnake?\n\nMe and David started writing a lot of songs and then I ended up playing and being with him on his two solo albums, being his friend and writing with him, getting drunk with him. There are some really good songs on his first two solo albums. David had a great talent for writing songs, but they're very diverse. There's no real direction. I don't think he'd be very pleased with them now, even though they are very musical and I thought David was very expressive, especially on some of the ballads, I thought were fantastic, like the Northwinds and Only My Soul. I think David's attitude must have been 'to hell with all this, I wanna do exactly what I wanna do'. He could do so many styles. I was never a hard rock guitarist, although I liked Led Zeppelin and bands like that. My roots were still from the sixties. Jeff Beck, Clapton etc. My style was more American and funkier. I used to love Ry Cooder, Little Feat and those kind of bands. I presumed David just wanted me to play one track maybe, some slide or something, you know? I think it would have been nice to have a guitarist who played a heavier style on some of the tracks, but David said 'no, let's keep it, you do all the guitars'. The guitar playing is pretty good, but people were expecting it to be a bit heavier, cause he had just left Deep Purple.\n\nThe original Whitesnake had nothing to do with heavy metal anyway. We were a rock 'n' roll band, the early Whitesnake songs were influenced by The Rolling Stones, Jeff Beck, Led Zeppelin, and my slide playing came from maybe Little Feat. Me and Bernie's influence on the guitar playing was more bluesy than Ritchie Blackmore and Tommy Bolin. On some songs we sounded like Bob Seager and his band, which was unusual for a band with half of Deep Purple in it. We were obviously influenced by the blues. Ain't Gonna Cry No More comes from a certain tuning on the guitar from Blind Willie Mactell in 1944.\n\nThere is a lot of nostalgia in blues. A lot of people played the blues, and it was boring if you heard the same tunes all the time. I thought it was what you made of it. That's why I loved the Allman Brothers Band. They played blues, but still kept their own style, which we did in the early Whitesnake. I think you can appreciate the importance of Neil, Bernie and myself to get that sound, which was very successful in Europe and Japan with that style of music. We put these twin guitar parts on them and David sang much heavier than the blues singers etc. The blues didn't have to be so negative. My intention was to make people happy on stage. I didn't wanna go out there, being so serious and go 'I got the blues, I woke up in a dustbin, I had no clothes'. Because it's not true.\n\nThe way your slide guitar was integrated became a bit part of the early Whitesnake sound. What was the attraction?\n\nI think I have an individual approach to the slide guitar, it just hits something in my soul that makes me want to do it. My slide solo usually gets a great reaction, I will always do it. A lot of hard rock guitarists are just playing a lot of fast notes, what they have practised at home, it doesn't mean anything. I think with the slide thing because I play it finger style, I can keep the rhythm going etc, and it's like a little band itself. What annoys me sometimes is that they say, 'Micky Moody, oh the slide guitarist', but I'm not, as you know I can play any style really, it's just one style I became known for.\n\nHow would you like to remember one of the definitive Whitesnake line-ups with yourself, Bernie Marsden, Ian Paice, Coverdale, Jon Lord and Neil Murray?\n\nI think David enjoyed that particular line-up, because there was a lot of strong feelings between us. We were all mates originally when the band started. We had such a great time playing together and partying together. We had a great sense of humour. Some of the road crew were very funny guys too. Sometimes the humour came on stage, which is not always a good thing, but it's difficult to leave it behind sometimes. I think the audience appreciated that we enjoyed it, we weren't posing all the time. Quite often I was standing on Bernie's toe. It was usually in the beginning of Ain't No Love In The Heart Of The City, cause I was trying to put him off. David was worse than us. If you listen to some of the out takes from the live album, some of the things he said was just like a comedy show. The good vibe showed in the records. Some band members were more quiet than others, but in general the rest of us were just being crazy, silly, staying up drinking, dancing or whatever. There were no drugs, falling on the floor, none of that shit, just being 'the boys are back in town'.\n\nWe had a fine time 78, 79 and 1980. Ready An' Willing and Live In The Heart Of The City were the best Whitesnake albums ever. There is something special about Ready An' Willing. It retains the early blues sound, with things like Loveman. It wasn't just a boring blues, it had good lyrics and modern playing. Whitesnake wrote good songs. A lot of the heavy rock bands, even in those days was just a singer shouting on top of a guitar riff. Whitesnake always had good melodies and a strong melody will always last. Forget the sex stuff, David wrote some great words. He wrote some wonderful lyrics like Ain't Gonna Cry No More, which is still a great song to play live and people like to sing along to it, Blindman and Fool For Your Loving. Whitesnake found its style and sound by Ready An' Willing. It just had that Whitesnake vibe about it. You could tell everyone was really happy playing. It's funny listening to the earlier albums like Trouble and Lovehunter, the band hadn't quite found its sound or its direction. There's some very odd things on those albums, like the jazz funk on Night Hawk, Come And Get It in 81 was very good and maybe better in the production, but it was getting a little bit away from the roots.\n\nIt must have been fabulous playing with the legendary Jon Lord and Ian Paice from Deep Purple?\n\nYeah, Duck Dowle is a fantastic player, but at the end of the day, when David said 'I've asked Ian Paice if he would like to join the band', it was difficult to say no because he was more suitable to Whitesnake and Ian is the best, he's the best rock drummer I've ever worked with. It must have been difficult for Jon because we had two lead guitar players, but bless him, he never complained saying 'would you two be quiet and let me play a solo'. The great thing about Jon's playing was that he would listen to the guitar riffs and he would play along with them, so you had this big fat sound of two guitars and the keyboard player playing the same riff. That was fantastic really, when you took it away you noticed, but you didn't always know when he was there because he was so in tune with the guitar playing. Jon is just a brilliant musician.\n\nWhy weren't you able to keep this line-up together anymore?\n\nBy '81 people were becoming tired. We had too many late nights, too much partying. We weren't making nowhere near the kind of money we should have been making. Whitesnake always seemed to be in debt, and I thought 'what is this?, we're playing in some of the biggest places and we're still being told we're in debt, where is all the money going?'. We hadn't got much money out of it and to be told you're 200,000 pounds in debt, when you just had six golden albums. It wasn't just me, cause everybody was getting tired, pissed off and losing their sense of identity. It was over by then, we couldn't get any further. It's difficult for a band to go more than three or four years without getting tired of each other and losing ideas. Nothing lasts forever. Everybody wanted to do something different after a few years, a solo album or write with someone else. We weren't Status Quo. They couldn't play with someone else, cause it would always end up sounding like somebody playing Status Quo anyway, but we had the talents to do other things. By the end of 81 we did the Saints And Sinners album, and it took three or four studios before we were happy to just a certain extent. The money still wasn't coming in and I left the band in December 81. It wasn't fun anymore and I had problems at home anyway. We dried up on the song writing. The money was going 'somewhere'. I got drunk one night and said 'I'm sick of this shit, I don't like what's going on' and the next thing I heard in the beginning of 82 was that the band had broken up, that I wasn't being replaced.\n\nHow come you went back around eight months later?\n\nTowards the end of 82, David rang me up and said 'we wanna finish the Saints And Sinners album and we need to do some backing vocals etc'. He wanted to work with Mel Galley, as he had admired him as a guitar player and writer in Trapeze. Jon Lord was back and Cozy Powell was brought into the band as well. Colin had just played on Cozy's latest solo album, so Cozy said 'I want this guy in'. Then Jon Lord was asked back. So we finished the vocals on the album and at the end of 82, Saints And Sinners was completed, and Mel didn't play guitar but sang the backing vocals with me. Then David said he wanted to reform the band next year. David had taken over the band businesswise. He was handling the economic side with certain businessmen. John Coletta was no longer our manager.\n\nDavid asked me back and said 'it's gonna be great, we've got a lot of good things lined up and we're gonna make money'. I said 'Well, good it's about time we made some money from Whitesnake'.\n\nThen why did you decide to leave Whitesnake again in late '83?\n\nI wanted to do it properly, but I realised that as soon as we started rehearsing and playing that it wasn't the same band, it never felt right. Mel Galley is very talented, a good singer, a great guitar player, but that band just didn't work out. Cozy was a great drummer, I always had a lot of respect for him, but he just didn't have any feel for the old Whitesnake sound. Cozy Powell brought with him a bass player called Colin Hodgkinson. Me and David knew Colin in the North East back in the sixties. He was a great legendary bass player, worked with the jazz/blues styles, but he never struck me as the bass player for Whitesnake. It was more the heavy metal attitude, probably because of Cozy's influence. He was a more heavy drummer than Ian Paice. There were flames and explosions going on, not really my cup of tea. It seems to me now that maybe Cozy wanted the band to be much more heavier and flasher. Maybe he wanted more of a whammy bar guitar player. John Sykes was more in key with this image, cause Cozy was very image conscious. I'm not sure, but that's the impression I got. We played at Donington in 83. It was almost like a hard rock cabaret, people coming together to put on an act. It was six individual people on stage together doing their thing. The atmosphere changed on the Slide It In album. When I was in the studio it was obvious it was David and Cozy's album. Cozy was kind of taking over by then. Mel was featured heavily because he wrote a lot of the songs. What I thought was gonna be David and Mel turned out to be David and Cozy.\n\nMel likes to party so he wasn't always there and he wasn't that kind of character, he was a laid back guy and didn't care really. It certainly wasn't Micky and David anymore. I can only speak for myself, but I was paid a fee for playing on the record, as a session man. Me and David weren't friends and co-writers anymore. David never said anything to me. He just didn't socialise with me anymore. David was a guy who five, six years earlier was my best friend. Now he acted as if I wasn't there. I got married by then, I was a little straighter and I wasn't partying anymore, I wasn't being wild. Maybe I was too boring for him, but that's fine. I don't mind if people don't think I'm living up to an image that I was supposed to. Nobody said anything to me but I think people knew I wasn't particularly happy at this point and I wasn't making the kind of money I thought I would be making, considering we were playing all the big Monsters Of Rock festivals that year and topping the bill. The whole atmosphere wasn't very nice. There were certain people in David's management who I'd known for a long time, who treated me like shit. They were talking to me like they never knew me. I thought, 'these guys are arseholes'. I left Whitesnake twice. I was never sacked from Whitesnake. I wasn't socialising and I wasn't happy on stage. There were people coming over from Geffen Records, standing on the side of the stage, taking down notes, writing things and I thought 'I don't like the look of this'. Then one night we were in Germany and we did kind of a mini festival with Thin Lizzy and John Sykes was on guitar. Back at the hotel we were all sitting around and David was really talking a lot to John Sykes. I was sitting there quietly and David just turned around to me, pointing his fingers and said 'don't you ever turn your back on the audience again'. I went 'pardon?'. He said 'that's really unprofessional', in front of John Sykes to make me look small and I thought to myself 'that's it'. I nearly said to him 'get him in the band', cause even I knew by then he wanted somebody like John Sykes, cause he looked good and he was a good guitar player. I decided to leave after finishing the end of the tour. The last gig was in Brussels in Belgium in October 83. After the gig, I said to the tour manager 'I want to have a meeting in my room with all the band, I have something to say'. The other band members arrived and I said 'where is David?'. The tour manager came and told me 'David is entertaining people in his suite, and he won't come down'. Anyway, I told the others that I was leaving. Jon Lord was quite upset. He said, 'but you're part of the sound of this band, your style of playing is different to most players because of the slide, and the rock 'n' roll style, it's not the obvious heavy metal sound'. I said 'thank you Jon, but it's just not the same band'. David did an interview in sounds in 84, and he said 'Moody and Hodgkinson were passengers on HMS Whitesnake'. That's not true. I don't know about Colin, but I left.\n\nCoverdale, Marsden and yourself were the creative force. In hindsight, do you think you've been give enough credit for this by David Coverdale?\n\nNo, David should have given us more credit. We didn't badmouth David Coverdale or anybody, but when David starts saying negative things, we have to stand up for ourselves. The funny thing is that one of David's little sayings or whatever was 'Never wash your dirty laundry in public', but that seems to be what he's doing anyway. I don't understand why he badmouths people. He must be paranoid, cause there's no need for it. I mean Whitesnake was his idea, his baby, that's fine. We're not saying it was ours, but we played a big part in that. It's not nice to be pushed away like we were just there to get him a cup of tea or something, like we were disposable diapers. That's bad because this is our profession, this is our life. I've known David for over thirty years, so I'm annoyed when a guy talks about you like you never existed. As I said, when he left Deep Purple he was upset and he was lonely, screwed up, I was a friend who helped him get normal again, he forgets all that. David has no right to put people down. He's not God. I don't care if it's him, Prince Charles or President Gorbachev, nobody should say that about you. I mean you can't say that session musicians go on stage and do solo spots, which we all did. I did a slide solo for ten minutes, a session guitar player wouldn't do that. Bernie did a long guitar solo on Mistreated etc. David's not the guy that rang me up in '76 anymore, we all change I suppose but... I've heard some of his interviews for Restless Heart. He sounds a little bitter and unhappy. Maybe we will have to go to Munich again and get drunk and play football.\n\nSince leaving Whitesnake what do you think about their musical direction?\n\nIt's not really the same band I was in. It's called Whitesnake but it has nothing to do with the band I was in, so I don't see them as Whitesnake really. It doesn't mean anything to me, but I'm very pleased they're doing some of the old songs live. I've heard Restless Heart and I didn't think it was a very good production to be quite honest. One or two songs were good, but it sounded under produced, it didn't sound as if there was enough effort in it. The guitar player, Adrian Vandenberg, I don't know him but he doesn't play with enough fire to be a blues player. You really need to be playing with fire and venom, and he doesn't play like that, you either do or you don't. So if David wants to play blues again, he has to get a different guitar player to start with, because that guy doesn't play blues to me.\n\nBERNIE MARSDEN INTERVIEW - MOODY/MARSDEN PART 2\n\nRETURN TO MUSICIANS' INDEX"}, {"url": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Snakes_and_Ladders_My_Autobiography.html?id=RJ4nDQAAQBAJ", "page_content": "WHEN THE WORLD WAS BITTEN BY THE HARD-ROCKING, HARD-TOURING AND HARDDRINKING WHITESNAKE, IT WAS MICKY MOODY\u2019S GRITTY RIFFS AND SIGNATURE BLUESY SLIDE-GUITAR THAT HELPED PROPEL THEM TO INTERNATIONAL STARDOM, AS THEY SHOULDERED ASIDE CONTEMPORARY RIVALS, GOING ON TO SELL MILLIONS OF ALBUMS WORLDWIDE.\n\nBut before Whitesnake\u2014and life on the road with former Deep Purple singer David Coverdale\u2014became a chaotic reality, Moody had already formed a teenaged band with Free\u2019s Paul Rodgers, played with Juicy Lucy, been a founder member of Snafu and worked as an in-demand session musician.

He was also a founder-member of Snafu. Together with his former Whitesnake colleague Bernie Marsden he founded the Moody Marsden Band, and later, The Snakes, having previously collaborated with unofficial 5th Status Quo member Bob Young in Young & Moody. Along with Marsden and ex-Whitesnake bassist, Neil Murray, he formed [the Company of Snakes and M3 Classic Whitesnake with which they mainly performed early Whitesnake songs. More recently, he has toured and recorded with Snakecharmer.\n\nBesides this, Moody has also toured with Roger Chapman, Frankie Miller and Chris Farlowe. He has also performed live alongside the likes of Eric Clapton, Alvin Lee, Mick Taylor, Bruce Dickinson, Sam Brown, Gary Brooker, Suggs, Dennis Locorriere, Paul Jones, P. P. Arnold, James Hunter, Rick Wakeman, Jon Lord, Newton Faulkner, Uriah Heep, Alice Cooper, Mark King, Alfie Boe, Sandi Thom, Brian Auger, Paul Weller, Eric Bibb, Meat Loaf, Boy George, Elkie Brooks, Nona Hendryx, Mud Morganfield and one of his early guitar heroes, Duane Eddy. Since 2000 he has released several solo albums: I Eat Them For Breakfast (2000), Don't Blame Me (2006), Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009). A versatile guitarist, Moody has been an active session musician and his own website lists over 100 albums to which he has contributed musically. 2006 saw the release of the autobiographical Playing With Trumpets \u2013 A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship, a memoir about his early days on the music scene. Another book of memoirs Snakes And Ladders was released in 2016. His library music has been featured on such TV programmes as Waking the Dead, Bo' Selecta!, America's Next Top Model, How to Look Good Naked, Top Gear, Horizon, Jersey Shore, Mad Men, Wife Swap and Paul Hollywood's Bread.\n\n1960s\n\nWhile still at school in Middlesbrough and attending private guitar lessons, Moody formed The Roadrunners with several others from the area including Paul Rodgers (later of Free and Bad Company). They were joined some time later by bass player Bruce Thomas, who moved onto play with Elvis Costello and the Attractions. The band performed a range of covers in local halls and clubs. By 1967 they had developed and outgrown the local music scene and turned professional, changing their name to The Wildflowers and subsequently moving to London. They had some success and undertook some touring, but relationships within the band frayed and they eventually split without making any recordings. Moody returned home to Middlesbrough where for a while he widened his musical horizons by taking classical guitar lessons. He also became increasingly interested in slide guitar techniques (a style he would later be closely associated with). While living in Middlesbrough he was asked by local singer and entrepreneur John McCoy, to form a group which became Tramline. A deal for two albums was signed with Island Records, but by the time the second album was released the band had broken up. Moody joined Lucas and the professional Soul band Mike Cotton Sound who became Gene Pitney's backing band for UK tours as well as others such as Paul Jones.\n\n1970s\n\nIn 1970 he joined the recently re-patriated keyboard player Zoot Money as guitarist. He then replaced Neil Hubbard in Juicy Lucy with whom he recorded three albums and toured extensively before the group disbanded. After the band split, Moody co-founded Snafu which combined his funk-rock guitar style with U.S down-home stateside grooves. The band recorded three albums SNAFU, Situation Normal and All Funked Up. They also appeared on a John Peel The Old Grey Whistle Test session and the T.V series Supersonic. Extensive touring followed before the band broke up. At this time Moody undertook occasional work as a session player most notably for Graham Bonnet. He also contributed to one track on Gerry Rafferty's City to City. He performed with the former Status Quo drummer John Coghlan's Diesel Band, then recorded an album with the band's tour manager and lyricist Bob Young which became Young & Moody. He then toured with Frankie Miller and stood in as a guest with Hinkley's Heroes before joining his friend David Coverdale. Moody had known Coverdale from the local music scene in the Middlesbrough area in the late sixties, upto this time Coverdale had been fronting Deep Purple and was looking to undertake a solo venture. Coverdale invited Moody to work with him and the album White Snake was released in 1977. Moody shared writing credits on four songs including the title track. A second album Northwinds followed in 1978, on which Moody contributed to three songs. Following the demise of Deep Purple MkIV, Coverdale and Moody joined forces with Bernie Marsden, Neil Murray, Dave 'Duck' Dowle and keyboardist Brian Johnston to form a band that took its name Whitesnake from the title of Coverdale's first solo album. In 1978 they recorded the E.P Snakebite followed by two Studio albums, Trouble (1978) and Lovehunter (1979) which were recorded by a modified line up with Jon Lord on keyboards. Moody is credited with co-writing four of the ten tracks on Trouble and was sole writer of Belgian Tom's Hat Trick', an instrumental. While working with Whitesnake he also played slide guitar on Roger Chapman's debut solo album Chappo.\n\n1980s\n\nMoody contributed slide guitar to three tracks on former Lindisfarne member Ray Jackson's solo debut In the Night, which was released in 1980. By this point Whitesnake now featured Ian Paice from Deep Purple on drums, who had been brought into the group to replace Dowle. In 1980 this line up released the album Ready an' Willing, from which two UK singles were taken, Fool for Your Loving and the album title track, both co-written by Moody. The band also released the double album Live...in the Heart of the City in the same year. At his time he recorded two singles with Bob Young, with all tracks written by Moody.\n\nIn 1981 Graham Bonnet released his album Line-Up which featured Moody playing guitar on all tracks and also featured three songs written by Moody in partnership with Bob Young. Moody continued to maintain a busy schedule with Whitesnake and the band released the album Come an' Get Itin the same year. Relationships within the band were beginning to sour and Moody's guitar partner Bernie Marsden left prior to the final completion of the next album Saints and Sinners. Moody himself followed soon after. Whitesnake took time out for much of 1982 and Moody undertook some session work, with Sheena Easton and others. By late 1982 Whitesnake was reformed with Mel Galley replacing Marsden and Moody joining Galley on the album's backing vocal sessions. In 1983 Coverdale replaced Ian Paice and Neil Murray with Cozy Powell and Colin Hodgkinson. Moody was not happy with the direction the new band was taking and felt increasingly sidelined by Coverdale. However, despite the deteriorating situation within Whitesnake, Moody recorded Slide It In with them. A process he described as an 'unhappy experience' and after which he left the band in 1983.\n\nMoody returned to session work with Mike Oldfield, Gary Glitter, Mike d'Abo and Roger Chapman, as well as selected T.V music library work. He toured with Chris Farlowe and also worked with former Meal Ticket singer Willy Finlayson and his band the Hurters. Taking a wry, yet witty view on some of the people and experiences they'd encountered over the years, he got together with Bob Young to write a book on musician's humour, the acclaimed Language of Rock and Roll. He also put together the first version of the Micky Moody Band featuring former Taste bassist Charlie McCracken and drummer Chris Hunt. Towards the end of the decade he and Bernie Marsden played selected venues with their own Moody Marsden Band.\n\n1990s\n\nDuring the early part of the 1990s, Moody toured extensively with Roger Chapman before re-uniting on a more permanent basis with Whitesnake guitarist Bernie Marsden, to tour and record with the Moody Marsden Band in U.K and Europe. The Moody Marsden Band recorded two live albums, Never Turn Our Back on the Blues and Live in Hell and a studio set, Real Faith. In 1996, Moody toured the USA as part of the Best of British Blues tour which also featured Eric Burdon, Alvin Lee, Aynsley Dunbar, Boz Burrell and Tim Hinkley. The following year, Moody and Marsden teamed up with Norwegian rockers Jorn Lande, Willy Bendickson and Sid Ringsby to form The Snakes, a band that specialised in re-producing the sounds of the original Whitesnake. Don Airey would often be brought in to augment them on keyboards. The band recorded two albums, Once Bitten and Live in Europe before making way for The Company of Snakes, which featured in its line up former Bad Company vocalist Robert Hart, original Whitesnake bass player Neil Murray and ex-Manfred Mann's Earth Band drummer John Lingwood. Hart was eventually replaced by ex-Snakes in Paradise frontman Steffan Berggren, and the band released two albums, Burst the Bubble and a live set Here They Go Again.\n\n2000s\n\nIn 2000, Micky wrote and produced library music prior to the release of his first official solo album, I Eat Them For Breakfast. Whilst continuing to perform with Company of Snakes and take on occasional session work, Moody joined his former Juicy Lucy bandmate Paul Williams to arrange and record a selection of acoustic classic Chicago blues tracks for the album Smokestacks, Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men. He also started to play occasional duo gigs with bluesman Papa George. 'Snake' metamorphosed into M3 Classic Whitesnake and also released released a live CD featuring Martin and a live DVD featuring Berggren with a guest appearance from former Ritchie Blackmore and Yngwie Malmsteen frontman Doogie White. Also featured in this line-up were Go West and Tears for Fears drummer Jimmy Copley and keyboard player Mark Stanway from Magnum.\n\nAround this time Moody played on the album Nah Aufnahme by German musician Westernhagen, which eventually appeared in thethe national charts. 2006 saw the release of Moody's self-produced solo album Don't Blame Me which was released at the same time as publication of his autobiographical memoirsPlaying with Trumpets \u2013 A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship. M3 broke up later that year, after which Moody performed more shows with Roger Chapman plus selected dates with a line-up of the Micky Moody Band that featured his eldest son Micky Moody Jr. on drums. In 2008 he toured Japan as special guest of Jimmy Copley and Japanese guitar legend Char. Also featured was ex-Herbie Hancock bassist Paul Jackson and keyboard wizard Yoshinobu Kojima. The shows were recorded and released on DVD as Jimmy Copley & Char: Special Session. To celebrate his love of instrumental music, Micky wrote and produced the albums Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009).\n\n2010s\n\nIn 2011, Moody co-wrote library music for both Warner/Chapell and Universal before co-forming Snakecharmer, a line up which also includes former Whitesnake colleague Neil Murray and Adam Wakeman. He also made regular appearances alongside blues guitarist Papa George and has been an active member of the Sunflower Jam house band and the Bad Apples.\n\nWith Tramline\n\n1968 Somewhere Down The Line\n\n1969 Moves of Vegetable Centuries\n\nWith Juicy Lucy\n\n1970 Lie Back and Enjoy It\n\n1971 Get a Whiff a This\n\n1972 Pieces\n\nWith Snafu\n\n1973 Snafu\n\n1974 Situation Normal\n\n1975 All Funked Up\n\nWith The Moody Marsden Band\n\n1992 Never Turn Our Back on the Blues\n\n1994 live in Hell\n\n1994 The Time Is Right For Live\n\n1994 Real Faith\n\n2000 The Night the Guitars Came to Play\n\n2001 Ozone Friendly\n\nWith Bob Young\n\n1977 Young and Moody\n\n1995 The Nearest Hits Album\n\n2010 Back for the Last Time Again\n\nWith David Coverdale\n\n1977 White Snake\n\n1978 Northwinds\n\n2003 The Early Years\n\nWith Whitesnake\n\n1978 Snakebite\n\n1978 Trouble\n\n1978 Live at Hammersmith\n\n1979 Lovehunter\n\n1980 Ready an' Willing\n\n1980 Live...in the Heart of the City\n\n1982 Saints & Sinners\n\n1984 Slide It In (UK version)\n\n1994 Greatest Hits\n\n2003 Best of Whitesnake\n\n2003 The Silver Anniversary Collection\n\n2004 The Early Years\n\n2008 30th Anniversary Collection\n\n2011 Box of Snakes\n\nWith The Snakes, Company of Snakes & M3\n\n1998 Once Bitten (Japan)\n\n1998 Live in Europe\n\n2001 Here They Go Again\n\n2002 Burst the Bubble\n\n2005 Classic Snake Live\n\n2005 Rough An' Ready (live album, CD)\n\n2007 Rough An' Ready (live album, DVD)\n\nWith Snakecharmer\n\n2013 Snakecharmer\n\n2017 Second Skin\n\nWith The Bad Apples\n\n2014 Played\n\nWith Ali Maas\n\n2016 Black & Chrome\n\nSolo\n\n2000 I Eat Them for Breakfast\n\n2002 Smokestacks Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men (with Paul Williams)\n\n2006 Don't Blame Me\n\n2007 Acoustic Journeyman\n\n2008 Live and Rocking! \u2013 Live at the Hell Blues Festival 2000 (Micky Moody & Friends)\n\n2009 Electric Journeyman\n\n2016 Black & Chrome (with Ali Maas)\n\nGuest appearances\n\n1969 You Can All Join In (VA)\n\n1970 Zoot Money (Zoot Money)\n\n1973 In Memory of Robert Johnson (Paul Williams)\n\n1973 I Never Got (Tony Kelly)\n\n1973 Manor Live (VA)\n\n1973 Me and My Friend (Patrick Campbell Lyons)\n\n1974 Funkist (Bobby Harrison)\n\n1975 Squire (Alan Hull)\n\n1975 Legend (Mickey Jupp)\n\n1977 Graham Bonnet (Graham Bonnet)\n\n1977 Fancy That (Joanna Carlin)\n\n1977 City to City (Gerry Rafferty)\n\n1979 Chappo (Roger Chapman)\n\n1981 Line Up (Graham Bonnet)\n\n1982 Riff Burglars (Roger Chapman)\n\n1982 Madness, Money & Music (Sheena Easton)\n\n1986 In Quo Country (Bob Young)\n\n1987 Islands (Mike Oldfield)\n\n1987 Party Album (Gary Glitter)\n\n1987 Reaching Out (Paul Millns)\n\n1987 Indestructible (Mike D'Abo)\n\n1987 No Angel (Sanne Salomonsen)\n\n1988 New Day (Jane Harrison)\n\n1989 Walking The Cat (Roger Chapman)\n\n1990 Hybrid and Lowdown (Roger Chapman)\n\n1991 Blue-Eyed Slide (Brian Knight)\n\n1992 Parlour Games (John Spencer)\n\n1992 Blues Brittania (VA)\n\n1992 Waiting in the Wings (Chris Farlowe)\n\n1992 Very Much Alive (Willy Finlayson and The Hurters)\n\n1993 Midnight Postcards (Adam Faith)\n\n1994 Tellin' Stories (Walter Trout)\n\n1994 Line Up (Borderline)\n\n1995 Together (Peter Smith)\n\n1995 Green and Blues (Bernie Marsden)\n\n1996 Kiss My Soul (Roger Chapman)\n\n1996 Blue Thunder (Blue Thunder)\n\n1998 Pinboard Wizards (Jackie Lynton)\n\n2000 Here After (Jamie Marshall)\n\n2000 Gimme All Your Topp (VA)\n\n2000 Snakebites (VA)\n\n2000 Glory Bound (Chris Farlowe)\n\n2001 Another Hair of the Dog (VA)\n\n2001 Tam de ti ye...

We don't find out the consequences of this as the book ends with his departure from Whitesnake when he's still dabbling in all sorts.\n\nFor me a bit too much of the book is about drugs and booze and the stories are a bit repetitive they seem like a bit of padding , its better when he talks about the different bands he was in , musicians he met and how things formed and fell apart. Would have liked to hear more about the way his early band with Paul Rodgers fell apart but not much detail. He doesn't compare so no views on Rodgers v Coverdale personality and vocal talent maybe he just didn't want to get into that sort of stuff. He seems quite honest about things and doesn't have too much of a go about David Coverdale and Micky doesn't always come out of this book too well he does seem quite lad back at times though clearly a respected and sought after musician, I certainly prefer him the the guitarists Whitesnake has used in recent years.\n\n\n\nI assume there is going to be part 2 as he has done a lot more since 1983 , though not as high profile.

He was also a founder-member of Snafu. Together with his former Whitesnake colleague Bernie Marsden he founded the Moody Marsden Band, and later, The Snakes. Along with Marsden and ex-Whitesnake bassist, Neil Murray, he formed Company of Snakes and M3 Classic Whitesnake with which they mainly performed early Whitesnake songs. From 2010 he has been working with Murray, guitarist Laurie Wisefield, drummer Harry James, singer Chris Ousey and keyboard player Michael Bramwell in Monsters of British Rock which has morphed into Snakecharmer with Adam Wakeman on keyboards.\n\nBesides this, Moody has also toured with Roger Chapman, Frankie Miller and Chris Farlowe. He has also worked alongside the likes of Eric Clapton, Alvin Lee, Mick Taylor, Bruce Dickinson, Sam Brown, Gary Brooker, Suggs, Dennis Locorriere, Paul Jones, PP Arnold, James Hunter, Rick Wakeman, Jon Lord, Newton Faulkner and Uriah Heep. For TV he has also accompanied such stars as Meat Loaf, Boy George, Elkie Brooks, Nona Hendryx, Ben E. King and one of his early guitar heroes, Duane Eddy. Since 2000 he has released several solo albums: I Eat Them For Breakfast (2000), Don't Blame Me (2006), Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009).[1] A versatile guitarist, Moody has been an active session musician and his own website lists over 100 albums to which he has contributed musically. 2006 saw the release of the autobiographical Playing With Trumpets - A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship, a memoir about his early days on the music scene.[2] His media music has been featured on such TV programmes as Waking the Dead, Bo Selecta, America's Next Top Model, How To Look Good Naked, Top Gear, Mad Men and Wife Swap USA.\n\nBiography\n\n1960s\n\nWhile still at school in Middlesbrough and regularly attending private guitar lessons, Moody formed a band named The RoadRunners with several other local boys including Paul Rodgers (later to form Free and Bad Company), and later, Bruce Thomas, who would eventually play bass with Elvis Costello and the Attractions. The band were kept busy performing a range of covers in local halls and clubs. By 1967 they had developed and outgrown the local music scene so they took the decision to turn professional, change their name to the Wildflowers, and move to London. They had some success and undertook some touring, but relationships within the band frayed and they eventually split without ever releasing any recordings. Moody returned home to Middlesbrough where for a while he widened his musical horizons by taking classical guitar lessons. He also became increasingly interested in slide guitar techniques (a style he would later be closely associated with). While living in Middlesbrough he was asked by local singer and entrepreneur, John McCoy, to form a group which became Tramline. A deal for two albums was signed with Island Records, but by the time the second album was released the band had already split and gone their separate ways. At this point Moody joined Lucas and the Mike Cotton Sound who, as well as proving to be a highly-polished Soul band, also acted as Gene Pitney's backing band for his UK tours as well as backing others, such as Paul Jones.[3][4]\n\n1970s\n\nIn 1970 he joined the recently re-patriated Zoot Money before replacing Neil Hubbard in Juicy Lucy. As a member of Juicy Lucy, he recorded three albums and toured extensively before the group disbanded. After the band split, Micky co-founded Snafu which combined his funk-rock guitar style with some down-home stateside grooves. The band recorded three albums - SNAFU, Situation Normal, and All Funked Up. They also appeared on a John Peel session, the Old Grey Whistle Test and Supersonic and toured extensively before the individual members headed off to pursue different ventures. Moody undertook occasional work as a session player before, during and after Snafu, most notably for Graham Bonnett. He also contributed to one track on City to City by Gerry Rafferty. Moody performed as an original member of Status Quo drummer John Coghlan's Diesel Band, then recorded an album with the band's tour manager and lyricist, Bob Young. The result was Young & Moody. He then toured with Frankie Miller and guested with Hinkley's Heroes before hooking up with another friend from the North East, David Coverdale. Micky had known Coverdale from the local music scene in the Middlesbrough area in the late sixties, but by this point Coverdale had been fronting Deep Purple and was looking to undertake a solo venture. He invited Moody to assist and the result was the album White Snake released in 1977 which was followed by a second album Northwinds in 1978. Moody shared writing credits on four of the nine songs on Whitesnake (including the title track) and three of the eight songs featured on Northwinds. With the demise of Deep Purple MkIV, Coverdale and Moody joined forces with Bernie Marsden, Neil Murray, Dave 'Duck' Dowle and keyboardist Brian Johnston (replaced after a few months by Pete Solley) to form a band that took its name Whitesnake from the title of Coverdale's first solo album. In 1978 they recorded the EP Snakebite followed by two Studio albums: Trouble (also in 1978) and Lovehunter (1979) which were recorded by a modified line up with Jon Lord on keyboards. Moody is credited with co-writing four of the ten tracks on Trouble, and was sole author of a fifth (the lively instrumental, Belgian Tom's Hat Trick). He contributed to three of the ten songs on Lovehunter, most notably the title track. While working with Whitesnake he found time to play slide guitar on several tracks on Roger Chapman's debut solo album, Chappo.\n\n1980s\n\n\n\nCourtesy: Andrew King Bernie Marsden (left) and Micky Moody; at Hammersmith Odeon, in 1981Courtesy: Andrew King\n\nMoody contributed slide guitar to three tracks on Ex-Lindisfarne Ray Jackson's solo debut In the Night released in 1980. By this point Whitesnake now featured Ian Paice from Deep Purple on drums, who had been brought into the group to replace Dowle. In 1980 this line up released the album Ready an' Willing, which spawned two UK single hits in the form of Fool for your Loving and the album title track; Moody co-wrote both tracks. The band also released the double album Live...in the Heart of the City in that year. He also found time to write and record two singles with Bob Young. In 1981 Graham Bonnet released his album Line-Up which featured Moody playing guitar on all tracks and also featured three songs written by Moody in partnership with Bob Young. Micky maintained a busy schedule with Whitesnake and the band released the album Come an' Get It that year. Relationships within the band were beginning to sour and Moody's guitar partner Bernie Marsden left prior to the final completion of the next album Saints and Sinners. Moody himself followed soon after. The band was put on hold for much of 1982 and Moody undertook some session work, for the likes of Sheena Easton. By late 1982 Whitesnake were back, (with Mel Galley replacing Marsden), and a re-juvinated Moody joining Galley on the album's backing vocal sessions. Going into 1983, Coverdale replaced Ian Paice and Neil Murray with Cozy Powell and Colin Hodgkinson. However Micky was not particularly happy with the direction the new band was taking and felt increasingly sidelined by Coverdale.[5] Despite the deteriorating situation within Whitesnake, Moody persevered with recording the Slide It In album (which he describes as an 'unhappy experience' ) before quitting the band in 1983 at the end of a tour.[1] Moody went back to session work with a series of artists including Mike Oldfield, Gary Glitter, Mike d'Abo, and Roger Chapman as well as selected TV work. He toured with Chris Farlowe and also worked with ex-Meal Ticket singer Willy Finlayson and his band the Hurters. Taking a wry, yet witty view on some of the people and experiences they'd encountered over the years, he got together with Bob Young to write a book on musician's humour, the acclaimed Language Of Rock And Roll. He also put together the first version of the Micky Moody Band featuring ex-Taste bassist Charlie McCracken and drummer Chris Hunt. Towards the end of the decade he and Bernie Marsden played selected venues with the their own Moody Marsden Band.\n\n1990s\n\nDuring the early part of the 1990s, Moody toured extensively with Roger Chapman before re-uniting on a more permanent basis with his erstwhile Whitesnake guitarist-in-crime, Bernie Marsden, to tour and record with the Moody Marsden Band, concentrating mostly on the British and western European markets. Featured in various line-ups were drummers Zak Starkey, Terry Williams, John Trotter, Henry Spinetti and Dave Dowle; bass players Jaz Lochrie, Pete Stroud, Steve Price, Neil Murray and David Levy, and keyboard players Don Ariey and Josh Phillips. Guests in the studio included harmonica player Mark Feltham, keyboard player Volker 'Wolfman' Kunschner, brass players Nick Pentelow, Frank Mead and Martin Drover, and backing singers Monica Reed-Price and Mick Lister. The Moody Marsden Band recorded two live albums, Never Turn Our Back On the Blues and Live In Hell and a studio set, Real Faith. In 1996, Moody toured the USA as part of the Best of British Blues tour which also featured Alvin Lee, Eric Burdon, Aynsley Dunbar, Boz Burrell and Tim Hinkley. The following year, Moody and Marsden teamed up with Norwegian rockers Jorn Lande, Willy Bendickson and Sid Ringsby to form The Snakes, a band that specialised in re-producing the sounds of the original Whitesnake. Don Airey would often be brought in to augment them on keyboards. The band recorded two albums, Once Bitten and Live in Europe before making way for The Company of Snakes, which featured in its line up former Bad Company vocalist Robert Hart, original Whitesnake bass player Neil Murray and ex-Manfred Mann's Earth Band drummer John Lingwood. Hart was eventually replaced by ex-Snakes in Paradise frontman Steffan Berggren, and the band released two albums, Burst the Bubble and a live set, Here They Go Again.\n\n2000s\n\nIn 2000, Micky wrote and produced media music prior to the release of his first official solo album, I Eat Them For Breakfast. Whilst continuing to perform with Company Of Snakes and take on occasional session work, Moody joined his former Juicy Lucy bandmate Paul Williams[6] to arrange and record a selection of classic Chicago blues tracks in a mostly 'unplugged' fashion; the result was Smokestacks, Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men. He also started to play occasional gigs in a duo format with bluesman Papa George, and continues to do so. The next 'Snake' metamorphosis was into M3 Classic Whitesnake, and although ex-Black Sabbath singer Tony Martin was in the starting line-up, Stefan Berggren was soon back in the frontman's spot. M3 released a live CD featuring Martin, and a live DVD featuring Berggren with a guest appearance from former Richie Blackmore and Yngwie Malmsteen frontman Doogie White. Also featured in this line-up were ex-Paul Rodgers Band, Go West and Tears for Fears drummer Jimmy Copley and keyboard player Mark Stanway from Magnum.\n\nAround this time, Moody played on the album Nah Aufnahme by German superstar Westernhagen, which eventually topped the national charts. 2006 saw the release of Moody's self-produced solo album Don't Blame Me in tandem with the autobiographical Playing with Trumpets - A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship, the latter recounting his early days in the music business, mostly in the company of Paul Rodgers. M3 broke up later that year, after which Moody performed more shows with Roger Chapman plus selected dates with a line-up of the Micky Moody Band that featured his eldest son Micky Moody Jr. on drums. In 2008 he toured Japan as special guest of Jimmy Copley and Japanese guitar legend Char. Also featured was ex-Herbie Hancock bassist Paul Jackson and keyboard wizard Yoshinobu Kojima. The shows were recorded and released on DVD as Jimmy Copley & Char: Special Session. To celebrate his love of instrumental music, Micky wrote and produced Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009).\n\n2010s\n\nIn 2011, Moody co-wrote library music for both Warner/Chapell and Universal before forming Snakecharmer with Neil Murray, also formerly of Whitesnake and The Company of Snakes.\n\nDiscography\n\nWith Tramline\n\n1968 Somewhere Down The Line\n\n1969 Moves of Vegetable Centuries\n\nWith Juicy Lucy\n\n1970 Lie Back and Enjoy It\n\n1971 Get a Whiff a This\n\n1972 Pieces\n\nWith Snafu\n\n1973 SNAFU (album)\n\n1974 Situation Normal\n\n1975 All Funked Up\n\nWith The Moody Marsden Band\n\n1992 Never Turn Our Back On The Blues\n\n1994 live In Hell\n\n1994 The Time Is Right For Live\n\n1994 Real Faith\n\n2000 The Night the Guitars Came to Play\n\nWith Bob Young\n\n1977 Young and Moody\n\n1995 The Nearest Hits Album\n\n2010 Back for the Last Time Again\n\nWith David Coverdale\n\n1977 White Snake\n\n1978 Northwinds\n\n2003 The Early Years\n\nWith Whitesnake\n\nWith The Snakes, Company of Snakes & M3\n\n1998 Once Bitten (Japan)\n\n(Japan) 1998 Live in Europe\n\n2001 Here They Go Again\n\n2002 Burst The Bubble\n\n2005 Classic Snake Live\n\n2005 Rough An' Ready (live album, CD)\n\n(live album, CD) 2007 Rough An' Ready (live album, DVD)\n\nSolo\n\n2000 I Eat Them For Breakfast\n\n2002 Smokestacks Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men (with Paul Williams)\n\n(with Paul Williams) 2006 Don't Blame Me\n\n2007 Acoustic Journeyman\n\n2008 Live and Rocking! - Live at the Hell Blues Festival 2000 (Micky Moody & Friends)\n\n(Micky Moody & Friends) 2009 Electric Journeyman\n\nGuest appearances\n\n1969 You Can All Join In (VA)\n\n(VA) 1970 Zoot Money (Zoot Money)\n\n(Zoot Money) 1973 In Memory of Robert Johnson (Paul Williams)\n\n(Paul Williams) 1973 I Never Got (Tony Kelly)\n\n(Tony Kelly) 1973 Manor Live (VA)\n\n(VA) 1973 Me and My Friend (Patrick Campbell Lyons)\n\n(Patrick Campbell Lyons) 1974 Funkist (Bobby Harrison)\n\n(Bobby Harrison) 1975 Squire (Alan Hull)\n\n(Alan Hull) 1975 Legend (Mickey Jupp)\n\n(Mickey Jupp) 1977 Graham Bonnet (Graham Bonnet)\n\n(Graham Bonnet) 1977 Fancy That (Joanna Carlin)\n\n(Joanna Carlin) 1977 City to City (Gerry Rafferty)\n\n(Gerry Rafferty) 1979 Chappo (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1981 Line Up (Graham Bonnet)\n\n(Graham Bonnet) 1982 Riff Burglars (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1982 Music Money And Madness (Sheena Easton)\n\n(Sheena Easton) 1986 In Quo Country (Bob Young)\n\n(Bob Young) 1987 Islands (Mike Oldfield)\n\n(Mike Oldfield) 1987 Party Album (Gary Glitter)\n\n(Gary Glitter) 1987 Reaching Out (Paul Millns)\n\n(Paul Millns) 1987 Indestructible (Mike D'Abo)\n\n(Mike D'Abo) 1987 No Angel (Sanne Salomonsen)\n\n(Sanne Salomonsen) 1988 New Day (Jane Harrison)\n\n(Jane Harrison) 1989 Walking The Cat (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1990 Hybrid and Lowdown (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1991 Blue-Eyed Slide (Brian Knight)\n\n(Brian Knight) 1992 Parlour Games (John Spencer)\n\n(John Spencer) 1992 Blues Brittania (VA)\n\n(VA) 1992 Waiting In The Wings (Chris Farlowe)\n\n(Chris Farlowe) 1992 Very Much Alive (Willy Finlayson and The Hurters)\n\n(Willy Finlayson and The Hurters) 1993 Midnight Postcards (Adam Faith)\n\n(Adam Faith) 1994 Tellin' Stories (Walter Trout)\n\n(Walter Trout) 1994 Line Up (Borderline)\n\n(Borderline) 1995 Together (Peter Smith)\n\n(Peter Smith) 1995 Green and Blues (Bernie Marsden)\n\n(Bernie Marsden) 1996 Kiss My Soul (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1996 Blue Thunder (Blue Thunder)\n\n(Blue Thunder) 1998 Pinboard Wizards (Jackie Lynton)\n\n(Jackie Lynton) 2000 Here After (Jamie Marshall)\n\n(Jamie Marshall) 2000 Gimme All Your Topp (VA)\n\n(VA) 2000 Snakebites (VA)\n\n(VA) 2000 Glory Bound (Chris Farlowe)\n\n(Chris Farlowe) 2001 Another Hair Of the Dog (VA)\n\n(VA) 2001 Tam de ti ye...
