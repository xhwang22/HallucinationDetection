When your elementary, junior high or high school teacher rolled a TV cart into the classroom, the odds were good the next half-hour was \u201cgonna be fire.\u201d\n\nSometimes literally.\n\nOriginally airing in 1981, the namesake program celebrates its 40th anniversary as the brainchild of Dr. Walker, or \u201cJearl,\u201d as he\u2019s hailed to both on-campus and off. The beloved CSU physics professor first joined faculty here in 1973 and has been a staple of many a Viking\u2019s education ever since.\n\nJearl\u2019s \u201cshow don\u2019t tell\u201d approach to teaching became the basis for his 1977 book, Jearl Walker's The Flying Circus of Physics. An essential tome, it sold over 100,000 copies across nearly a dozen editions and has had as many translations. Like his show, the book is widely regarded as \u201ca cult classic.\u201d\n\nJearl sat down with CSU to recount his life in physics, his nearly 50 years as a professor, his stints on television and the six online seasons of CSU\u2019s \u201cThe Flying Circus of Physics\u201d. Take it away, Jearl\u2026\n\nVideo of Jearl Walker\n\nA Kinetic Karnival Home Companion and Episode Guide on its 40th Anniversary\n\nDidn\u2019t see \u201cKinetic Karnival\u201d during its heyday? Every bit as influential as Don \u201cMister Wizard\u201d Herbert and Bill Nye \u201cThe Science Guy,\u201d the program won over millions of impressionable kids in the United States and Canada who thought they couldn\u2019t possibly love science.\n\nHere are your SparkNotes (or CliffsNotes, depending on your age!) mapping out the beloved series:\n\nEp1. Forces and Collisions: Using freakish news stories about five-story falls and failed parachutes, Jearl reinforces the premise of impact time and contact area \u2013 using egg drops to alliterate the science. From there, he chops concrete bricks with his bare hands and offers himself up as human lunchmeat for a bed-of-nails \u201csandwich.\u201d It won\u2019t be the first time students look on in awe, nor will it be the last.\n\nEp2. Rotation: At Aurora, Ohio\u2019s 550-acre amusement park Geauga Lake (1887-2007, RIP), Jearl covers circular motion and conservation of angular momentum. He then uses the park\u2019s more popular rides including the Rotor and Corkscrew to illuminate the scientific explanations. Bonus: we see Jearl and his \u201cwild hair\u201d back home at CSU, leaping from the diving platform into the Busbey Natatorium pool!\n\nEp3. Fluid Flow and Friction: Jearl tackles the drain swirl myth from the bathtub, offers up \u201cthe tablecloth trick\u201d seen in nearly every sitcom and Saturday morning cartoon show, describes an early dating disaster (a theme of sorts we learn in later episodes) and then he hangs a spoon from his nose. Now, why was he having trouble dating again?\n\nEp4. Viscosity: An episode focused on toying with viscous and non-Newtonian fluids. During this half-hour show, Jearl tinkers with corn starch, gets stuck in quicksand \u2013 something that we all thought would happen more often when we were kids! \u2013 and jumps feet-first into unflavored gravy.\n\nEp5. The Leidenfrost Effect: This episode on heat transfer and phase change includes Jearl cooking crepes on a clothes iron, placing liquid nitrogen in his mouth, and doing an incredible bit of firewalking before segueing into the now-legendary hand-into-molten-lead stunt.\n\nEp6. The Science of Cooking: Jearl prepares a special meal for a dinner date, describing the physics and chemistry involved in a variety of dishes. How did the date go, you ask? Despite his penchant for cooking hotdogs in liquid lead and making crepes on clothes irons, the meal goes better than his date does.\n\nEp7. A Late-Night: While not an official KK episode, Jearl appears on a certain late-night talk show (see video above) with a \u201cgreatest hits\u201d of KK experiments, plus the molten lead stunt. The revered host calls our hero \u201crather unorthodox for a teacher.\u201d Without missing a beat, intrepid Jearl deadpans, \u201cI\u2019m a little bit strange at times, yes.\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t find these \u201cKinetic Karnival\u201d episodes? Not to worry. Viewers can binge-watch all six seasons of \u201cThe Flying Circus of Physics,\u201d filmed and produced right here at CSU over the last several years! The shows are clever, concise and most certainly bingeworthy\u2026 and hey, you\u2019re on winter break now, so dig in!\n\nEat your heart out, Netflix!"}, {"url": "https://facultyprofile.csuohio.edu/csufacultyprofile/detail.cfm?FacultyID=HRW", "page_content": "Brief Bio: Jearl Walker, professor of physics at Cleveland State University, received his BS in physics from MIT in 1967 and his PhD in physics from University of Maryland in 1973. He arrived at CSU in September 1973, greatly relieved to have been hired at one of only two schools nationwide with a tenure possibility. He has enjoyed CSU ever since.\n\nHis book The Flying Circus of Physics was first published 41 years ago and was translated into at least 10 languages. The second edition was published in 2006 and is still being translated into other languages. For 16 years he toured his Flying Circus talk throughout the U.S. and Canada, introducing such physics stunts as the bed-of-nails demonstration and the walking-on-hot-coals demonstration to countless physics teachers, who then proceeded to hurt themselves when they repeated the stunts in their own classrooms. These talks led to his PBS television series Kinetic Karnival that was rerun nationally for years and which landed him a local Emmy, now proudly displayed in his first-floor bathroom. Since then he was on the Canadian radio Quirks and Quarks weekly for 11 years and, later, on the Discovery Channel Canada show Daily Planet numerous times.\n\nDuring his 13 years with Scientific American magazine, he wrote 152 articles for The Amateur Scientist section, which were translated into at least 9 languages world wide and had over 2 million readers each month. His topics ranged from the physics of judo to the physics of b\u00e9arnaise sauce and lemon meringue pies.\n\nIn 1990, he took over the textbook Fundamentals of Physics from David Halliday and Robert Resnick, the textbook he used in his first year at MIT. Since then he has published nine editions of the book, with 18 translations and selling over one million copies in North America and perhaps three or four million copies world wide (it is the number one book world wide in its market). He has lost count of the number of times he has been on television and radio and interviewed for newspapers and magazines. However, he clearly remembers the 20 minutes he spent performing on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, where he stuck his fingers into molten lead without losing any of them, to the great relief of his mother who was at home watching the show."}, {"url": "https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Flying+Circus+of+Physics%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9780471762737", "page_content": "Hurry!

His popular book, The Flying Circus of Physics, has been translated into at least 10 languages and is still being sold worldwide. For 16 years he toured his fun-filled Flying Circus lecture throughout the U.S. and Canada, introducing countless teachers to such physics phenomena as molecular adhesion by hanging spoons from his face and Leidenfrost's phenomenon by dipping his wet hand in molten lead without getting hurt.\n\nThese lectures led to his national PBS television show, Kinetic Karnival, which ran for several years and won him a local Emmy Award.

About Author :-\n\nThe author David Halliday (1916\u20132010) was an American physicist known for his physics textbooks, Physics and Fundamentals of Physics, which he wrote with Robert Resnick. Both textbooks have been in continuous use since 1960 and are available in more than 47 languages.\n\nHalliday attended the University of Pittsburgh both as an undergraduate student and a graduate student, receiving his Ph.D. in physics in 1941. During World War II, he worked at the MIT Radiation Lab developing radar techniques. In 1946 he returned to Pittsburgh as an assistant professor and spent the rest of his career there. In 1950, he wrote Introductory Nuclear Physics, which became a classic text and was translated into four languages. In 1951 Halliday became the Department Chair, a position he held until 1962.\n\nHis Physics has been used widely and is considered by many to have revolutionized physics education. Now in its tenth edition in a two-volume set revised by Jearl Walker, and under the title Fundamentals of Physics, it is still highly regarded. It is noted for its clear standardized diagrams, very thorough but highly readable pedagogy, outlook into modern physics, and challenging, thought provoking problems. In 2002 the American Physical Society named the work the most outstanding introductory physics text of the 20th century.\n\nThe author Robert Resnick (1923\u20132014) was a physics educator and author of physics textbooks.\n\nHe was born in Baltimore, Maryland on January 11, 1923 and graduated from the Baltimore City College high school in 1939. He received his B.A. in 1943 and his Ph.D. in 1949, both in physics from Johns Hopkins University. From 1949 to 1956, he was a member of the faculty at the University of Pittsburgh, where he first met David Halliday, with whom he wrote his most widely read textbook. He later became a professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and was head of the interdisciplinary science curriculum for fifteen years. During his years at RPI, he authored or co-authored seven textbooks on relativity, quantum physics, and general physics, which have been translated into more than 47 languages. It is estimated that over 10 million students have studied from his books. In 1960, Physics, the first-year textbook he wrote with Prof. Halliday, was published. The book has been used widely and is considered to have revolutionized physics education. Now in its tenth edition in a five-volume set revised by Jearl Walker, and under the title Fundamentals of Physics, it is still highly regarded. It is noted for its clear standardized diagrams, very thorough but highly readable pedagogy, outlook into modern physics, and challenging, thought provoking problems. In 2002 the American Physical Society named the work the most outstanding introductory physics text of the 20th century.\n\nHe received the Oersted Medal (1974), the highest award given by the American Association of Physics Teachers, and was president of that society from 1986 to 1990. As well as being a Fulbright Scholar, he was also an honorary research fellow and visiting professor at Harvard University (1964\u201365). Other awards include that of being an Honorary Visiting Professor to the People's Republic of China (in 1981 and 1985), the Exxon Foundation Award for Outstanding Teaching (1954), the RPI Distinguished Faculty Award (1971), Outstanding Educator of the Year (1972), a fellow of the American Physical Society and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a member of the Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi honorary societies.\n\nAll Famous Books of this Author :-\n\nHere is list all books, text books, editions, versions or solution manuals avaliable of this author, We recomended you to download all.\n\n\u2022 Download PDF Physics 1 (5E) by Robert Resnick, David Halliday, Kenneth Krane\n\n\u2022 Download PDF Physics 1 (Soluton Manual) by Robert Resnick, David Halliday, Kenneth Krane\n\n\u2022 Download PDF Physics 2 (4E) by Robert Resnick, David Halliday, Kenneth Krane '\n\n\u2022 Download PDF Fundamentals of Physics (8E) Solution by Jearl Walker, Robert Resnick, David Halliday\n\n\u2022 Download PDF Fundamentals of Physics Extended (8E) by Jearl Walker, Robert Resnick, David Halliday\n\n\u2022 Download PDF Fundamentals of Physics (9E) by David Halliday, Robert Resnick, Jearl Walker\n\n\u2022 Download PDF Fundamentals of Physics (9E Solution Manual) by David Halliday, Robert Resnick, Jearl Walker\n\n\u2022 Download PDF Fundamentals of Physics Extended (10E) by David Halliday, Robert Resnick, Jearl Walker\n\n\u2022 Download PDF Fundamentals of Physics Extended (10E Solution Manual) by David Halliday, Robert Resnick, Jearl Walker\n\n\u2022 Download PDF Principles of Physics (10E) by David Halliday, Robert Resnick, Jearl Walker '\n\n\u2022 Download PDF The Flying Circus of Physics (2E) by Jearl Walker\n\n\u2022 Download PDF The Flying Circus of Physics (2E): with Answers by Jearl Walker\n\nJoin our new updates, alerts:-\n\nFor new updates and alerts join our WhatsApp Group and Telegram Group (you can also ask any [pdf] book/notes/solutions manual).\n\n\n\nBook Contents :-\n\nFundamentals of Physics Extended (10E Solution Manual) written by David Halliday, Robert Resnick, Jearl Walker cover the following topics.

When your elementary, junior high or high school teacher rolled a TV cart into the classroom, the odds were good the next half-hour was \u201cgonna be fire.\u201d\n\nSometimes literally.\n\nOriginally airing in 1981, the namesake program celebrates its 40th anniversary as the brainchild of Dr. Walker, or \u201cJearl,\u201d as he\u2019s hailed to both on-campus and off. The beloved CSU physics professor first joined faculty here in 1973 and has been a staple of many a Viking\u2019s education ever since.\n\nJearl\u2019s \u201cshow don\u2019t tell\u201d approach to teaching became the basis for his 1977 book, Jearl Walker's The Flying Circus of Physics. An essential tome, it sold over 100,000 copies across nearly a dozen editions and has had as many translations. Like his show, the book is widely regarded as \u201ca cult classic.\u201d\n\nJearl sat down with CSU to recount his life in physics, his nearly 50 years as a professor, his stints on television and the six online seasons of CSU\u2019s \u201cThe Flying Circus of Physics\u201d. Take it away, Jearl\u2026\n\nVideo of Jearl Walker\n\nA Kinetic Karnival Home Companion and Episode Guide on its 40th Anniversary\n\nDidn\u2019t see \u201cKinetic Karnival\u201d during its heyday? Every bit as influential as Don \u201cMister Wizard\u201d Herbert and Bill Nye \u201cThe Science Guy,\u201d the program won over millions of impressionable kids in the United States and Canada who thought they couldn\u2019t possibly love science.\n\nHere are your SparkNotes (or CliffsNotes, depending on your age!) mapping out the beloved series:\n\nEp1. Forces and Collisions: Using freakish news stories about five-story falls and failed parachutes, Jearl reinforces the premise of impact time and contact area \u2013 using egg drops to alliterate the science. From there, he chops concrete bricks with his bare hands and offers himself up as human lunchmeat for a bed-of-nails \u201csandwich.\u201d It won\u2019t be the first time students look on in awe, nor will it be the last.\n\nEp2. Rotation: At Aurora, Ohio\u2019s 550-acre amusement park Geauga Lake (1887-2007, RIP), Jearl covers circular motion and conservation of angular momentum. He then uses the park\u2019s more popular rides including the Rotor and Corkscrew to illuminate the scientific explanations. Bonus: we see Jearl and his \u201cwild hair\u201d back home at CSU, leaping from the diving platform into the Busbey Natatorium pool!\n\nEp3. Fluid Flow and Friction: Jearl tackles the drain swirl myth from the bathtub, offers up \u201cthe tablecloth trick\u201d seen in nearly every sitcom and Saturday morning cartoon show, describes an early dating disaster (a theme of sorts we learn in later episodes) and then he hangs a spoon from his nose. Now, why was he having trouble dating again?\n\nEp4. Viscosity: An episode focused on toying with viscous and non-Newtonian fluids. During this half-hour show, Jearl tinkers with corn starch, gets stuck in quicksand \u2013 something that we all thought would happen more often when we were kids! \u2013 and jumps feet-first into unflavored gravy.\n\nEp5. The Leidenfrost Effect: This episode on heat transfer and phase change includes Jearl cooking crepes on a clothes iron, placing liquid nitrogen in his mouth, and doing an incredible bit of firewalking before segueing into the now-legendary hand-into-molten-lead stunt.\n\nEp6. The Science of Cooking: Jearl prepares a special meal for a dinner date, describing the physics and chemistry involved in a variety of dishes. How did the date go, you ask? Despite his penchant for cooking hotdogs in liquid lead and making crepes on clothes irons, the meal goes better than his date does.\n\nEp7. A Late-Night: While not an official KK episode, Jearl appears on a certain late-night talk show (see video above) with a \u201cgreatest hits\u201d of KK experiments, plus the molten lead stunt. The revered host calls our hero \u201crather unorthodox for a teacher.\u201d Without missing a beat, intrepid Jearl deadpans, \u201cI\u2019m a little bit strange at times, yes.\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t find these \u201cKinetic Karnival\u201d episodes? Not to worry. Viewers can binge-watch all six seasons of \u201cThe Flying Circus of Physics,\u201d filmed and produced right here at CSU over the last several years! The shows are clever, concise and most certainly bingeworthy\u2026 and hey, you\u2019re on winter break now, so dig in!\n\nEat your heart out, Netflix!"}]}
