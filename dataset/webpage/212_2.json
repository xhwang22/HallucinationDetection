His grandfather, Charles Hugo was a journalist, pioneer of early photographic techniques and a campaigner against the death penalty, and his father Georges Hugo was a published author and a recognised painter.\n\nHis mother, Pauline M\u00e9nard-Dorian, was the daughter of Paul-Fran\u00e7ois M\u00e9nard, conseiller g\u00e9n\u00e9ral and d\u00e9put\u00e9 of the H\u00e9rault department during the 1870s\u201380s, by his wife Aline Dorian, daughter of Pierre Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dorian, minister of works during the siege of Paris.\n\nJean Hugo was married twice, first in 1919 to Valentine Hugo (n\u00e9e Valentine Gross, no children from this marriage) and then in 1949 to Lauretta Hope-Nicholson, daughter of Hedley Hope-Nicholson.[1] Jean Hugo and Lauretta had seven children, several of whom have gone on to establish successful careers in the arts."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Victor-Hugo", "page_content": "Victor Hugo is remembered as a beloved writer of the people, who knew how to write with simplicity and power of common joys and sorrows. He is also remembered for the verbal inventiveness and technical virtuosity with which he created poems ranging from intimate lyrics to visionary and prophetic epics.\n\nVictor Hugo was an influential proponent of Romanticism . In a preface to his verse play Cromwell (1827), he called for a drama of action\u2014which he saw as appropriate to modern man, the battleground of matter and spirit\u2014that could transcend Classical categories and mix the sublime and the grotesque.\n\nPoet , novelist, and dramatist Victor Hugo is considered the most important of the French Romantic writers. Though regarded in France as one of that country\u2019s greatest poets, he is better known abroad for such novels as Notre-Dame de Paris (1831; The Hunchback of Notre-Dame) and Les Mis\u00e9rables (1862).\n\nVictor Hugo , in full Victor-Marie Hugo , (born February 26, 1802, Besan\u00e7on , France\u2014died May 22, 1885, Paris), poet, novelist, and dramatist who was the most important of the French Romantic writers. Though regarded in France as one of that country\u2019s greatest poets, he is better known abroad for such novels as Notre-Dame de Paris (1831) and Les Mis\u00e9rables (1862).\n\nHugo emerged as a true Romantic, however, with the publication in 1827 of his verse drama Cromwell . The subject of this play, with its near-contemporary overtones, is that of a national leader risen from the people who seeks to be crowned king. But the play\u2019s reputation rested largely on the long, elaborate preface, in which Hugo proposed a doctrine of Romanticism that for all its intellectual moderation was extremely provocative. He demanded a verse drama in which the contradictions of human existence\u2014good and evil, beauty and ugliness, tears and laughter\u2014would be resolved by the inclusion of both tragic and comic elements in a single play. Such a type of drama would abandon the formal rules of classical tragedy for the freedom and truth to be found in the plays of William Shakespeare . Cromwell itself, though immensely long and almost impossible to stage, was written in verse of great force and originality. In fact, the preface to Cromwell, as an important statement of the tenets of Romanticism, has proved far more important than the play itself.\n\nIn 1823 he published his first novel, Han d\u2019Islande, which in 1825 appeared in an English translation as Hans of Iceland. The journalist Charles Nodier was enthusiastic about it and drew Hugo into the group of friends, all devotees of Romanticism , who met regularly at the Biblioth\u00e8que de L\u2019Arsenal. While frequenting this literary circle, which was called the C\u00e9nacle , Hugo shared in launching a new review of moderate tendencies, the Muse Fran\u00e7aise (1823\u201324). In 1824 he published a new verse collection, Nouvelles Odes, and followed it two years later with an exotic romance, Bug-Jargal (Eng. trans. The Slave King). In 1826 he also published Odes et ballades, an enlarged edition of his previously printed verse, the latest of these poems being brilliant variations on the fashionable Romantic modes of mirth and terror. The youthful vigour of these poems was also characteristic of another collection, Les Orientales (1829), which appealed to the Romantic taste for Oriental local colour. In these poems Hugo, while skillfully employing a great variety of metres in his verse and using ardent and brilliant imagery, was also gradually shedding the legitimist royalism of his youth. It may be noted, too, that \u201cLe Feu du ciel,\u201d a visionary poem, forecast those he was to write 25 years later. The fusion of the contemporary with the apocalyptic was always a particular mark of Hugo\u2019s genius.\n\nFrom 1816, at least, Hugo had conceived ambitions other than the law. He was already filling notebooks with verses, translations\u2014particularly from Virgil \u2014two tragedies, a play, and elegies. Encouraged by his mother, Hugo founded a review, the Conservateur Litt\u00e9raire (1819\u201321), in which his own articles on the poets Alphonse de Lamartine and Andr\u00e9 de Ch\u00e9nier stand out. His mother died in 1821, and a year later Victor married a childhood friend, Ad\u00e8le Foucher, with whom he had five children. In that same year he published his first book of poems, Odes et po\u00e9sies diverses, whose royalist sentiments earned him a pension from Louis XVIII . Behind Hugo\u2019s concern for classical form and his political inspiration, it is possible to recognize in these poems a personal voice and his own particular vein of fantasy.\n\nVictor was the third son of Joseph-L\u00e9opold-Sigisbert Hugo, a major and, later, general in Napoleon \u2019s army. His childhood was coloured by his father\u2019s constant traveling with the imperial army and by the disagreements that soon alienated his parents from one another. His mother\u2019s royalism and his father\u2019s loyalty to successive governments\u2014the Convention, the Empire, the Restoration\u2014reflected their deeper incompatibility. It was a chaotic time for Victor, continually uprooted from Paris to set out for Elba or Naples or Madrid , yet always returning to Paris with his mother, whose royalist opinions he initially adopted. The fall of the empire gave him, from 1815 to 1818, a time of uninterrupted study at the Pension Cordier and the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand, after which he graduated from the law faculty at Paris, where his studies seem to have been purposeless and irregular. Memories of his life as a poor student later inspired the figure of Marius in his novel Les Mis\u00e9rables.\n\nSuccess (1830\u201351)\n\nThe defense of freedom and the cult of an idealized Napoleon in such poems as the ode \u201c\u00c0 la Colonne\u201d and \u201cLui\u201d brought Hugo into touch with the liberal group of writers on the newspaper Le Globe, and his move toward liberalism was strengthened by the French king Charles X\u2019s restrictions on the liberty of the press as well as by the censor\u2019s prohibiting the stage performance of his play Marion de Lorme (1829), which portrays the character of Louis XIII unfavourably. Hugo immediately retorted with Hernani, the first performance of which, on February 25, 1830, gained victory for the young Romantics over the Classicists in what came to be known as the battle of Hernani. In this play Hugo extolled the Romantic hero in the form of a noble outlaw at war with society, dedicated to a passionate love and driven on by inexorable fate. The actual impact of the play owed less to the plot than to the sound and beat of the verse, which was softened only in the elegiac passages spoken by Hernani and Do\u00f1a Sol.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The Hunchback of Notre-Dame), an evocation of life in medieval Paris during the reign of Louis XI. The novel condemns a society that, in the persons of Frollo the archdeacon and Phoebus the soldier, heaps misery on the hunchback Quasimodo and the gypsy girl Esmeralda. The theme touched the public consciousness more deeply than had that of his previous novel, Le Dernier Jour d\u2019un condamn\u00e9 (1829; The Last Days of a Condemned), the story of a condemned man\u2019s last day, in which Hugo launched a humanitarian protest against the death penalty. While Notre-Dame was being written, Louis-Philippe, a constitutional king, had been brought to power by the July Revolution. Hugo composed a poem in honour of this event, Dict\u00e9 apr\u00e9s juillet 1830. It was a forerunner of much of his political verse.\n\nFour books of poems came from Hugo in the period of the July Monarchy: Les Feuilles d\u2019automne (1831; \u201cAutumn Leaves\u201d), intimate and personal in inspiration; Les Chants du cr\u00e9puscule (1835; Songs of Twilight), overtly political; Les Voix int\u00e9rieures (1837; \u201cInner Voices\u201d), both personal and philosophical; and Les Rayons et les ombres (1840; \u201cSunlight and Shadows\u201d), in which the poet, renewing these different themes, indulges his gift for colour and picturesque detail. But Hugo was not content merely to express personal emotions; he wanted to be what he called the \u201csonorous echo\u201d of his time. In his verse political and philosophical problems were integrated with the religious and social disquiet of the period; one poem evoked the misery of the workers, another praised the efficacy of prayer. He addressed many poems to the glory of Napoleon, though he shared with his contemporaries the reversion to republican ideals. Hugo restated the problems of his century and the great and eternal human questions, and he spoke with a warmhearted eloquence and reasonableness that moved people\u2019s souls.\n\nSo intense was Hugo\u2019s creative activity during these years that he also continued to pour out plays. There were two motives for this: first, he needed a platform for his political and social ideas, and, second, he wished to write parts for a young and beautiful actress, Juliette Drouet, with whom he had begun a liaison in 1833. Juliette had little talent and soon renounced the stage in order to devote herself exclusively to him, becoming the discreet and faithful companion she was to remain until her death in 1883. The first of these plays was another verse drama, Le Roi s\u2019amuse (1832; Eng. trans. The King\u2019s Fool), set in Renaissance France and depicting the frivolous love affairs of Francis I while revealing the noble character of his court jester. This play was at first banned but was later used by Giuseppe Verdi as the libretto of his opera Rigoletto. Three prose plays followed: Lucr\u00e8ce Borgia and Marie Tudor in 1833 and Angelo, tyran de Padoue (\u201cAngelo, Tyrant of Padua\u201d) in 1835. Ruy Blas, a play in verse, appeared in 1838 and was followed by Les Burgraves in 1843.\n\nHugo\u2019s literary achievement was recognized in 1841 by his election, after three unsuccessful attempts, to the French Academy and by his nomination in 1845 to the Chamber of Peers. From this time he almost ceased to publish, partly because of the demands of society and political life but also as a result of personal loss: his daughter L\u00e9opoldine, recently married, was accidentally drowned with her husband in September 1843. Hugo\u2019s intense grief found some mitigation in poems that later appeared in Les Contemplations, a volume that he divided into \u201cAutrefois\u201d and \u201cAujourd\u2019hui,\u201d the moment of his daughter\u2019s death being the mark between yesterday and today. He found relief above all in working on a new novel, which became Les Mis\u00e9rables, published in 1862 after work on it had been set aside for a time and then resumed.\n\nWith the Revolution of 1848, Hugo was elected a deputy for Paris in the Constituent Assembly and later in the Legislative Assembly. He supported the successful candidacy of Prince Louis-Napol\u00e9on for the presidency that year. The more the president evolved toward an authoritarianism of the right, however, the more Hugo moved toward the assembly\u2019s left. When in December 1851 a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat took place, which eventually resulted in the Second Empire under Napoleon III, Hugo made one attempt at resistance and then fled to Brussels."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/jean.hugo/3743152", "page_content": "Jean Hugo\n\nartist designer illustrator writer\n\nNovember 19, 1894 (age 89) Paris, France\n\nJean Hugo is mainly known as the author of a great number of sketches and oil or gouache paintings, which are often small sized. He also created illustrations for books, designed theatre sets, and costumes as well as produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo's first published illustration appeared in 1918. It was a monogram for La Sir\u00e8ne publishing house. Then he also illustrated Les Joues en Feu by Raymond Radiguet, Bernouard, in 1920; Pommes d'Anis by Francis Jammes, Emile-Paul, 1923; Les Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel by Jean Cocteau, NRF, and Les Amis Nouvel by Paul Morand, Au Sans Pareil, both in 1924; Rom\u00e9o et Juliette by Shakespeare, Au Sans Pareil, in 1926, among others. Jean Hugo\u2019s paintings were unique in the artistic world of the 20th century. They maintained an authentic originality while recalling certain avant-garde themes of metaphysical painting or magical realism. At the start of the 1930s, in between various theatrical projects, including Jean Cocteau\u2019s Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel, he produced a series of masterful artworks, such as Solitude (1933). He was interested in forest scenes (L'Ermite de Meudon, 1933) and religious themes (La C\u00e8ne, 1933). L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. Many of his paintings were based on the sketches that he created all the time. He used to say that \"inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it.\" L'Imposteur (1931) was a conclusion of Jean Hugo's first artistic period. Around this time he moved from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, after the death of his grandmother. His painting of that period was a masterful assembly of the most important insights he had acquired so far. The lessons of the Italian primitives, of Poussin, of Henri Rousseau, and Picasso, were among the sources of inspiration on which he was constantly drawing. In the middle of the 1930s, Jean Hugo started to use oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. The artist's work witnessed his intention to work outside of present-day currents and fashionable theories. He never took part in the artistic debates and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public. The artist illustrated many limited edition books published between 1948 and 1984 by Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Benoit (PAB), collaborating with such writers as Ren\u00e9 Char, Marcel Jouhandeau, Tristan Tzara and Ren\u00e9 Crevel. Jean Hugo's artworks were widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the United States.

His grandfather, Charles Hugo was a journalist, pioneer of early photographic techniques and a campaigner against the death penalty, and his father Georges Hugo was a published author and a recognised painter. His paternal aunt was the socialite Jeanne Hugo.His mother, Pauline M\u00e9nard-Dorian, was the daughter of Paul-Fran\u00e7ois M\u00e9nard, conseiller g\u00e9n\u00e9ral and d\u00e9put\u00e9 of the H\u00e9rault department during the 1870s\u201380s, by his wife Aline Dorian, daughter of Pierre Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dorian, minister of works during the siege of Paris.Jean Hugo was married twice, first in 1919 to Valentine Hugo (n\u00e9e Valentine Gross, no children from this civil marriage) and then in 1949 to Lauretta Hope-Nicholson, daughter of Hedley Hope-Nicholson. Jean Hugo and Lauretta had seven children: Charles Hugo (farmer), Marie Hugo (artist), Jean-Baptiste Hugo (artist), Ad\u00e8le Hugo (artist), Jeanne Hugo-Chabrol (teacher), Sophie Hugo-Lafont (librarian), L\u00e9opoldine Hugo (artist).Jean Hugo's half-brother Fran\u00e7ois Hugo designed limited-edition jewellery interpretations for Pablo Picasso, Jean Cocteau, Max Ernst and Coco Chanel during the '20s Modern period. Pierre Hugo \u2013 son of Fran\u00e7ois Hugo \u2013 is also a jewellery designer and has written a book about the artistic legacy of the Hugo family, Les Hugo \u2013 Un t\u00e9moignage (Rocher, France, 2007).PaintingsHugo is predominantly known for his sketches and oil or gouache paintings, which are often executed in small formats. He also illustrated books, designed theatre sets and costumes and produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo designed the sets and costumes for Carl Theodor Dreyer's film The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928). His paintings can be viewed at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, and are also present in collections in London, Tokyo, Toronto, Paris, Marseille, and at the Musee Fabre in Montpellier, France \u2013 where there is a room dedicated to his paintings.Jean Hugo's painting is unique in the artistic panorama of the first half of the 20th century and maintains originality while evoking avant-garde themes of magical realism or metaphysical painting. At the start of the 1930s, in between na\u00efve and happy scenes and various theatrical projects \u2013 such as Jean Cocteau's Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel \u2013 he produced a series of works in brooding, unsettling, tones (Solitude, 1933).He showed an interest in forest scenes (L'Ermite de Meudon, 1933) and religious themes (La C\u00e8ne, 1933). L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. His painting were based on the sketchbooks that he had with him at all times. He used to say that \"Inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it\".L'Imposteur (1931) concludes Hugo's first artistic period, which coincides with his move from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, following the death of his grandmother. This imposing painting is an assembly of the most important insights he had acquired thus far: the lessons of the Italian primitives, of Henri Rousseau, of Poussin and Picasso, sources of inspiration on which he is constantly drawing. The subject of the painting evokes the discomfort of the catechumen in the midst of the faithful, prevented from taking communion during Christmas mass at the Church of Saint-Fran\u00e7ois in Montpellier. The painting is set in the countryside around Lunel, with its vineyards and low scrubland (garrigue). The tense and complex composition of the work is extremely well executed. No element, line, motif, nuance of colour or object is secondary. Each element contributes to the pictorial vision. The delicate volumes are bathed in luminosity and stand out from the background. The figures are fixed in the space by superimposed connections, in the Florentine manner.In the middle of the 1930s, he began using oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. Le Mangeur au chandail ray\u00e9 (autoportrait) (1940) shows the artist in his home at the Mas de Fourques. The motif of the stripes contrasts with the neat contours of the table, the chimney and the wall. In this homely setting, the figure seems surrounded by mystery and casualness. Although Hugo does not draw greatly on De Chirico, this work evokes the feeling of isolation and mystery that characterises the production of the latter.Jean Hugo's work bears witness to his intention to work outside of current trends and fashionable theories. He never felt the need to participate in the artistic debates of his time and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public.His auction record is $US308,200, for Les Plaisirs et les Jours, set at Fran\u00e7ois de Ricql\u00e8s' auction, Paris, on 26 November 1999.Selected exhibitionsHugo's work has been widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the USA.Jean Hugo and Max Jacob, Claridge Gallery, London, 1929The Art of Jean Hugo, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, 1973Jean Hugo, Mus\u00e9e Paul Val\u00e9ry, S\u00e8te, 1974Jean Hugo '77, Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977Jean Hugo, Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1977\u201378Paintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau, Sotheby's, London, 1981Jean Hugo: Costumes pour \"l'Homme qui rit\", Maison de Victor Hugo, Paris, 1984Jean Hugo: 1894\u20131984, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985Jean Hugo: palettes et souvenirs, Mus\u00e9e Victor Hugo, Paris, 1994\u201395Jean Hugo: Dessins des ann\u00e9es de guerre (1915\u20131919), Ch\u00e2teau de Bl\u00e9rancourt Mus\u00e9e de la coop\u00e9ration franco-am\u00e9ricaine, 1994\u201395Jean Hugo: Une R\u00e9trospective, Pavillon du Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1995Jean Hugo: a Retrospective, Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996Jean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne, Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001Jean Hugo, le manuscrit enlumin\u00e9, Mus\u00e9e M\u00e9dard, Lunel, 2014Jean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien, Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014Published workLe Retour de l'enfant terrible: Lettres 1923\u20131966 by Jean Bourgoint, Jean Hugo, Jean Mouton (Descl\u00e9e de Brouwer, 1975)Avant d'oublier (Before I Forget), autobiography (Fayard, 1976), was a humorous memoir of his family and a first-hand account of the 1920s French Surrealist movement.Le Regard de la m\u00e9moire (Actes Sud, 1983) \u2013 Jean Hugo's memoirs of the period from 1914 to 1945.

The book conveys the philosophy of his later years, sometimes disenchanted and often delectable. \"My illness\", wrote Jean Hugo on the last page of his diary, \"is called art\u00e9rite p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique, like the new boulevard around Paris.\"The book includes drawings and colour reproductions of Jean Hugo's paintingsDessins des ann\u00e9es de guerre (1915\u20131919) \u2013 Drawings of the war (Actes Sud, 1994)Books illustrated by Jean HugoHugo's first published illustration appeared in 1918, a monogram for La Sir\u00e8ne publishing house.Raymond Radiguet: Les Joues en Feu, Bernouard, 1920.Francis Jammes: Pommes d'Anis, Emile-Paul, 1923.Jean Cocteau: Les Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel, NRF, 1924.Paul Morand: Les Amis Nouvel, Au Sans Pareil, 1924Shakespeare: Rom\u00e9o et Juliette, Au Sans Pareil, 1926 (republished, in English, by the Folio Society, 1950).Jean Hugo: Le Miroir Magique, Jeanne Bucher, 1927.Jean Cocteau: Orph\u00e9e, Stock, 1927.Marte Bibesco: Le Perroquet Vert, Jeanne Walter, 1929.Andr\u00e9 Maurois: Climats, Chamontin, 1929.Robert Louis Stevenson: An Inland Voyage, Overbrook Press, 1938.Maurice Sachs: Au temps du Boeuf sur le toit, Nouvelle Revue critique, 1939.Paul Eluard: En Avril 1944: Paris respirait encore!, Galerie Charpentier, 1945.Jean Racine: Ph\u00e8dre, Tisn\u00e9, 1946.F\u00e9licit\u00e9 de Lammenais (translator): L'Imitation de Notre Seigneur J\u00e9sus-Christ, Arts et M\u00e9tiers, 1946Max Jacob: Le cornet \u00e0 d\u00e9s, Gallimard, 1948.Shakespeare: Romeo and Juliet, Folio Society, 1950.Charles P\u00e9guy: Le Myst\u00e8re de la Charit\u00e9 de Jeanne d'Arc, Gallimard, 1951.Paul Claudel and Charles-Jean Odic: Cheminots de France, R\u00e9sistance-Fer, 1952.Jean Hugo: Voyage \u00e0 Moscou et L\u00e9ningrad, Cercle d'Art, 1953.Gustav Jaeger: Jaeger's Natural History, WS Cowell, 1953.Louise de Vilmorin: L'Alphabet des aveux, NRF, 1954.Emmanuel d'Astier de la Vigerie: Sept fois sept jours, Guilde du Livre, 1956.Jean Hugo: Shakespeare's Cotswolds, Lund Humphries, 1964Jean Hugo: Actes pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s de saint Alban de Nant, Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Benoit, 1968Maurice Sc\u00e8ve: Saulsaye, Nouveau cercle parisien du livre, 1971.Jean-Pierre Geay: L'Age d'or selon Jean Hugo, Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Benoit, 1984Jean Hugo: Petit Office de Notre-Dame, Les \u00e9ditions de l'oeuvre d'art, 1994.In addition Hugo illustrated many limited edition books published from 1948 to 1984 by Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Benoit (PAB), collaborating with writers including Ren\u00e9 Char, Marcel Jouhandeau, Tristan Tzara and Ren\u00e9 Crevel.Jean Hugo's theatrical projects1921: costumes and masks for les Mari\u00e9s de la tour Eiffel, ballet-pantomime by Jean Cocteau, with music by Les Six\u2014 costumes for la Belle Excentrique, ballet by Erik Satie1922: decor and costumes for Esther de Carpentras, opera by Darius Milhaud and Armand Lunel1924: decor and costumes for Cocteau's Rom\u00e9o et Juliette (subsequently used by the Folio Society for their 1950 edition of Shakespeare's text)1925: decor and costumes for la Femme silencieux, with music by Georges Auric1926: decor for Cocteau's l'Orph\u00e9e (costumes by Coco Chanel\u2014 decors and costumes for le Village blanc, ou Olive chez les n\u00e8gres, operetta by Jean Wiener and Henri Falk1927: decor and costumes for Armand Lunel & Darius Milhaud's Les malheurs d'Orph\u00e9e\u2014 decors and costumes for Marcel Achard's le Jouer d'\u00e9checs1935: decors and costumes for Boris Kochno's ballet les Cent Baisirs1938: decors and costumes for the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise's production of Ruy Blas1939: decors and costumes for the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise's production of Ph\u00e8dre1941: costumes for les Folies Fran\u00e7aises ballet based on music by Couperin1942: costumes for les Nuits, by Alfred de Musset1945: decors and costumes for Andr\u00e9 Gide's translation of Antony and Cleopatra at the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise1946: decors and costumes for Boris Kochno's ballet les Amours de Jupiter1981: decors for Jean-Joseph de Mondonville's Daphnis et Alcimadure, l'Op\u00e9ra de MontpellierBooks and films about Jean HugoThe Art of Jean Hugo (Art Gallery of Ontario, 1973) \u2013 by Richard WattenmakerAlbums de familles \u2013 Apostrophes (TV show, 17 February 1984) Ina.frJEAN HUGO, Dessins des ann\u00e9es de guerre, 1915\u20131919 (Actes Sud- R\u00e9union des Mus\u00e9es Nationaux, 1994) \u2013 Catalogue d\u2019exposition, Mus\u00e9e National de la coop\u00e9ration franco-am\u00e9ricaineJEAN HUGO, une r\u00e9trospective (Actes Sud \u2013 Ville de Montpellier \u2013 R\u00e9union des Mus\u00e9es Nationaux, 1995) -

He was, and remains the very image of that perfect humility of the illuminators, for whom daily truths trumpeted decorative graces. His powerful hand, his big Jupiterian eye, his olympism in a way, did not use thunder but little watercolours so vast that it seemed as if their size was the result of a phenomenon of perspective. Indeed, he seems to view the sea in Brittany from a distance, and the garrigue by the big end of the telescope, which does not prevent him from evoking around us the mysterious odour of seaweed and wild herbs. Jean Hugo, subtle peasant, medieval monk, chases the angel from the bizarre through knowing all its tricks by heart.\"Gustave Thibon: \"I knew him intimately. He was a strange being, admirable, a mystic, a lover, a great artist, who no doubt sinned by excess of modesty. He had been a little tired of fame by his name, which was extremely heavy. [...]Jean Hugo spent his youth in that golden world of the big families of the Third Republic, the Berthelot, the Favre, the Renan, the Daudet, a world that he moved away from for a more isolated life in Lunel. His work is far better known, and valued, in America than in France, where he still suffers a little of being eclipsed by his name. I consider him a great painter, and a great painter that is relatively unknown. If he hadn't found others to look after publicising him, he would never have sold a single painting. Picasso, who was a good friend of his, used to say to him \"you do nothing for your fame\". And indeed he did nothing for it \u2013 others did it to him.Once again, he was a pure being. If the word innocence could be applied to anyone it was him. He was very handsome, and of prodigious vitality \u2013 dare I say Hugolian. He was detached enough not to install himself in his own name \u2013 while still showing unconditional admiration for the work of his great ancestor, that he knew in detail.\" Entretiens avec Gustave Thibon by Philippe Barthelet (\u00c9ditions du Rocher, Monaco, 2001)Maurice Sachs: \"Jean Hugo was calm, kind and generous. Life flowed calmly before him and we knew of no enemies of his. He carried the heavy burden of his family name with elegance. Like his father Georges Hugo he was a man of the world, a man of great distinction in heart and spirit, a kind friend, a man you would want to have in your life.\" La D\u00e9cade de l'illusion (Paris, Gallimard, 1950 pp. 14\u201316)Paul Morand: \"Jean Hugo's artistic temperament holds its own outside of all fashions. His work reminds us of the marvels that the relaxation of some prince of ancient times might have produced, as can be found in the tales of a thousand and one nights.\"ReferencesExternal linksNew York Times Obituary \u2013 June 23, 1984 \"Jean Hugo, Artist, Dies at 89\"Presentation of the Jean Hugo room at the Musee Fabre, Montpellier (in French) Archived 21 September 2014 at the Wayback MachineJean Hugo paintings on WikiArtJean Hugo collection at the Barnes Foundationwebsite of Jean Hugo's home, the Mas de FourquesPast auction results for Jean Hugo at Christie's\n\n\n\nBiography from Wikipedia (see original) under licence CC BY-SA 3.0"}, {"url": "https://www.priaulxlibrary.co.uk/articles/article/victor-hugo-and-guernsey-jean-hugo", "page_content": "Jean Hugo was the great-grandson of Victor Hugo. A talented artist and theatre designer, he was a schoolboy at Elizabeth College in Guernsey and made later visits to the island, of which he was very fond, including attending the inauguration of Jean Boucher's celebrated statue of the poet in 1914. The Library has a signed copy of his autobiography, Le Regard de la m\u00e9moire, which he gave to Roger Martin, the curator of Hauteville House at the time of his visit in 1977; Roger Martin's ancestor was, coincidentally, one of Victor Hugo's 'poor children.' The photograph is courtesy of the Guernsey Press.\n\nBy Dinah Bott.\n\nJean Hugo was born in Paris in 1894, the son of Georges Hugo and his wife, Pauline M\u00e9nard-Dorian. His wife\u2019s family owned a holiday home on the cliffs at Icart in Guernsey known as La Marcherie. From 1907 until 1910 Jean was at school at Elizabeth College in Guernsey. He enjoyed his time at school here greatly; he played football, was very good at boxing (his bony physique gave him a long reach !), did a great turn in the annual French school play, won prizes for French and Latin and excelled at art. He was in School House and during term time probably boarded. We do not know if he remained in Guernsey for the summer, although he did say in his memoirs that the Sundays he spent in Guernsey were among the best of his life. He recalled his school years in Guernsey in a beautifully written vignette in the second of his two biographical works, Le Regard de la m\u00e9moire, which was published just before his death and takes his life up to 1945.\n\nAfter leaving College he attended sixth-form in Paris. Like his father he joined up as soon as he could, in 1914. He was wounded in May 1915 at La Targette in Pas-de-Calais, and rejoined the front in September 1915. He commenced then an extensive series of delicate sketches and drawings of operations in Artois, Verdun, and Picardy, which he continued until 1918. They depict war-torn landscapes and scenes of soldiers\u2019 lives at the front and behind the lines. Aside from their artistic merit they join his father\u2019s war sketches as being very valuable documentary evidence of WWI.\n\nHugo went on to mix with the artistic post-war elite, amongst whom he counted as great friends such luminaries as Jean Cocteau, Pablo Picasso, Paul Eluard, Francis Poulenc, Max Jacob, Cecil Beaton and Eric Satie. As well as painting vividly in oils he illustrated books with watercolours and lithographs. He was particularly interested in the theatre and designed costumes and sets, for which he produced exquisite maquettes. His work was greatly appreciated in the UK and America, and he painted backdrops of Stratford-upon-Avon for the Quatercentenary of Shakespeare\u2018s birth in 1964 which are in the collection of the V&A. In 1931 he acquired an estate in Provence, the Mas de Fourques at Lunel, which remained his base until his death in 1984. He married twice, first to artist Valentine Grossman, and secondly to Laura Hope-Nicholson, by whom he had seven children.\n\nMaurice Sachs: \u2018Jean Hugo was calm, kind and generous. Life flowed calmly before him and as far as we knew he had no enemies. He carried the heavy burden of his family name with elegance.

She knew Guernsey well. She married a childhood friend, the controversial author L\u00e9on Daudet (1867-1942), who had plenty to say about Victor Hugo - very little of it complimentary. The marriage did not last long.\n\nBy Dinah Bott.\n\nJeanne Hugo, the granddaughter of the sublime Victor, and the spoilt child of the world of art and of letters, has received a long walrus-tooth formed into a paper-cutter. On one side is her monogram, \u2018JH\u2019 and on the other the inscription, 'Produit de la chasse de la Vega dans la mer polaire offert \u00e0 Mlle Jeanne Hugo par A E Nordenskjold.'/ (From the voyage of the SS Vega in the Arctic Ocean, presented to Mlle Jeanne Hugo by A[dolf] E[rik] Nordenskjold.) [Glasgow Evening Post, 5 June 1880.]\n\nL\u00e9opoldine Cl\u00e9mence Ad\u00e8le Lucie Jeanne Hugo was only eleven years old when this little article was written about her, the report of a gift from the leader of a famous Swedish scientific expedition to the Arctic. Her starring r\u00f4le along with her elder brother Georges in the immensely popular book of poetry that Hugo had published in 1877, L\u2019Art d\u2019\u00eatre grand-p\u00e8re, and the fact that Hugo was the children\u2019s guardian meant that for those who were admirers of \u2018the sublime Victor\u2019 they had the status from a very young age almost of royalty, basking in their grandfather\u2019s golden glow. As Jeanne grew she seemed to glide serenely through the fame. Always accompanied by her mother, her social life was enthusiastically documented in the newspapers.\n\nVictor Hugo died in 1885. The Hugo family had a close circle of friends, and Jeanne followed the family tradition by falling in love with one of them, L\u00e9on Daudet, the son of the very popular novelist Alphonse Daudet. Handsome, of the same age as the Hugo children, he was Georges Hugo\u2019s best friend. At the time, L\u00e9on Daudet seemed the perfect match, as many contemporary newspapers remarked. A marriage of love, both wealthy (although Daudet much less so than Jeanne), both from literary families, both brought up in the company of the greatest literary minds in contemporary France! Jeanne had to wait until she reached her majority to marry, as Victor Hugo, no doubt mindful of his late daughter L\u00e9opoldine, whom he had perhaps seen reborn in Jeanne, had inserted a proviso into his will that meant she would not receive the main part of her sizeable inheritance if she married earlier. Jeanne decided the marriage at Passy should be a civil one, out of respect for her grandfather; it attracted large crowds of onlookers and was attended by the glitterati, who heard long eulogies to Victor Hugo and comparatively little about the happy couple.\n\nAt the time L\u00e9on Daudet was a great admirer of Victor Hugo, and appears to have remained obsessed with him for years. From 1885 he attended medical school with Jean-Baptiste Charcot, the son of a world-famous neurologist and friend of his father\u2019s, Dr J-M Charcot. For a while they and Georges (who did not attend university) were great pals, having fun running amok in Paris, fighting, drinking, politically active republicans, getting into the newspapers for their outrageous behaviour; but then Daudet failed his exams. He mortally offended Charcot by claiming that he only passed his medical examinations because his father was their professor. Charcot never forgave him.\n\nAfter his marriage in early 1891 he published his first novel. His mother had hoped that marriage to Jeanne would quieten him down, but his political views changed and hardened. He became a monarchist; following the publication by his father in 1886 of Edouard Drumont\u2019s La France juive he had become virulently anti-Semitic. He was, however, able to remain close to Georges Hugo for some years despite Georges\u2019 many Jewish friends. Like his father Alphonse Daudet, L\u00e9on was passionate about politics, irascible and easily offended. He was prone to fighting duels.\n\nL\u00e9on and Georges were united in their dislike of Georges\u2019 stepfather, Edouard Lockroy, and in later life Daudet reserved nearly as much venom for Lockroy as he did for Emile Zola, one of his main b\u00eates noires (although he had known him too from childhood). Jeanne had a son by Daudet, Charles, but the marriage was soon in trouble. Daudet tells us that in 1885, he decided, while at Hauteville House sorting out Hugo\u2019s belongings with Georges, that he would one day write a novel:\n\nWe were submerged in relics. At that time I got the ambitious idea of writing a monograph about a genius, in his particular field, including a study of his entourage. But I didn\u2019t get around to writing The black star for eight years, until 1893, in that same house where I discovered, in 1885, the remains, the crumbs, the debris of Hugo\u2019s fat head. Although I tried to disguise reality as much as I could, something of the truth remained, and when Lockroy read the proofs (anyway he hated Hugo and Hugo hated him) it caused quite some drama. Hauteville House is fated to host scenes, and would have been a perfect place to be included in the remarkable book by Edouard Estauni\u00e9: Objects talk. [Nous \u00e9tions submerg\u00e9s de reliques. Des cette \u00e9poque, me venait par l\u2019ambiance l\u2019id\u00e9e ambitieuse d\u2019une monographie d\u2019un homme de g\u00e9nie, dans son cadre et dans son milieu, avec r\u00e9actions sur l\u2019entourage. N\u00e9anmoins je ne devais \u00e9crire L\u2019Astre noir que huit ans plus tard, en 1893, dan cette m\u00eame maison ou m\u2019\u00e9taient apparus, en 1885 les restes, les miettes et d\u00e9bris de la grosse t\u00eate de Hugo. Bien que je me fusse appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9former la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 autant que possible, il en \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 quelque chose, et la lecture des \u00e9preuves de L\u2019Astre noir par Lockroy \u2013 lequel d\u2019ailleurs d\u00e9testait Hugo et \u00e9tait d\u00e9test\u00e9 de lui \u2013 fut l\u2019occasion d\u2019un joli drame. Hauteville-House est pr\u00e9destin\u00e9e aux sc\u00e8nes, et c\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e0 un fameux d\u00e9cor pour le remarquable livre d\u2019Edouard Estauni\u00e9 : les Choses parlent.]\n\nHe wrote this novel, The black star, while sitting in Hauteville House with his wife, Victor Hugo\u2019s beloved granddaughter, only two years in to their marriage. Jeanne divorced him in 1895 and was awarded custody of the children, whom Daudet (who had issued a counter-divorce suit) was prevented from seeing for thirteen years by Edouard Lockroy. Jeanne then had a couple of failed engagements in quick succession, before marrying Dr Jean-Baptiste Charcot, all-round boys\u2019 own hero, in 1896. Daudet and Charcot fought a duel, inevitably. Charcot was livid that Georges, who refused to attribute blame for the divorce to either party, did not drop Daudet, as Jeanne had requested. In fact Georges took Daudet\u2019s side (perhaps because of his antipathy to Lockroy). He upset his mother by turning his back on her in the street. In 1898, when the family was attending the first performance of Victor Hugo\u2019s play \u2018La Grand\u2019m\u00e8re,\u2019 Charcot saw Georges with Daudet, stormed over to him, accused him of disrespecting his sister and slapped him so hard he knocked him down. Georges accepted the challenge, and he and Daudet both sent seconds, but Charcot changed his mind. The next day they were in court. Apparently Jeanne Hugo had been very upset that Georges continued to take L\u00e9on Daudet to visit Hauteville House, a place so special to her. Charcot said that he and Georges had been friends, but that Georges had refused to speak to him after the divorce. He, Charcot, had only wanted to help an unfortunate young lady rebuild her life. A horrible scandal, written up with relish by the newspapers who compared the two sides to the Montagues and Capulets. In the end the court decided it was six of one and half-a-dozen of the other, and fined Charcot 50 francs.\n\nSadly, Jeanne did not take into account her knight in shining armour\u2019s ambitions to be an explorer. She divorced Charcot for desertion, serving the notice when he set out for the South Pole, and in 1906 settled down with a Greek naval captain, Michel Negroponte, who died at the early age of 42 in 1914. Jeanne sent Canon Bourde de la Rogerie some money for the poor children of Guernsey in remembrance of him. She came to Guernsey in 1927 when after Georges\u2019 death she and his children handed over Hauteville House to the City of Paris.\n\nDaudet last spoke to Georges Hugo in 1903. He married his cousin and had another son, Philippe. He wrote a biography of Victor Hugo called The tragic life of Victor Hugo, which he claimed was based on material he had learnt from the family. Although Hugo\u2019s life was in many ways tragic, the same could be said of L\u00e9on Daudet, whose son Philippe fell in with the anarchists (the polar opposite to his father) and who committed suicide at the age of fourteen by shooting himself in the head with a gun he had been given in order to commit a political assassination. L\u00e9on Daudet would not accept this and was determined that his son had been murdered. He went to prison for libel, escaped, went on the run, was pardoned. He renounced his antisemitism in 1929, disliked the Nazis but was quite keen on Mussolini. He died in 1942, supporting the Vichy administration, having written 9000 articles and 128 books. The devil does indeed have some of the best tunes, because L\u00e9on Daudet was a brilliant writer. Jeanne, who was extremely proud of her heritage and spent a great deal of time safeguarding her grandfather\u2019s memory and estate, died in Paris in 1941.\n\nJeanne's autograph, along with those of other members of the Hugo entourage, is to be found in the Priaulx Library's The Album of Maggie Lelean. Maggie was the daughter of a sea-captain, and she and her sisters were near neighbours of Hugo and his grandchildren in 1878; they played with Georges and Jeanne at Hauteville House."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-hugo", "page_content": "The great-grandson of Victor Hugo, Jean Hugo was a French painter, illustrator, theatre designer and author.

He also illustrated books, designed theatre sets and costumes and produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo designed the sets and costumes for Carl Theodor Dreyer's film The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928). His paintings can be viewed at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, and are also present in collections in London, Tokyo, Toronto, Paris, Marseille, and at the Musee Fabre in Montpellier, France \u2013 where there is room dedicated to his paintings.\n\n\n\nJean Hugo's painting is unique in the artistic panorama of the first half of the 20th century and maintains an authentic originality while evoking certain avant-garde themes of magical realism or metaphysical painting. At the start of the 1930s, in between na\u00efve and happy scenes and various theatrical projects \u2013 such as Jean Cocteau's Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel \u2013 he produced a series of masterful works in brooding, unsettling, tones (Solitude, 1933).\n\nThis is a part of the Wikipedia article used under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License (CC-BY-SA).

[Glasgow Evening Post, 5 June 1880.]\n\nL\u00e9opoldine Cl\u00e9mence Ad\u00e8le Lucie Jeanne Hugo was only eleven years old when this little article was written about her, the report of a gift from the leader of a famous Swedish scientific expedition to the Arctic. Her starring r\u00f4le along with her elder brother Georges in the immensely popular book of poetry that Hugo had published in 1877, L\u2019Art d\u2019\u00eatre grand-p\u00e8re, and the fact that Hugo was the children\u2019s guardian meant that for those who were admirers of \u2018the sublime Victor\u2019 they had the status from a very young age almost of royalty, basking in their grandfather\u2019s golden glow. As Jeanne grew she seemed to glide serenely through the fame. Always accompanied by her mother, her social life was enthusiastically documented in the newspapers.\n\nVictor Hugo died in 1885. The Hugo family had a close circle of friends, and Jeanne followed the family tradition by falling in love with one of them, L\u00e9on Daudet, the son of the very popular novelist Alphonse Daudet. Handsome, of the same age as the Hugo children, he was Georges Hugo\u2019s best friend. At the time, L\u00e9on Daudet seemed the perfect match, as many contemporary newspapers remarked. A marriage of love, both wealthy (although Daudet much less so than Jeanne), both from literary families, both brought up in the company of the greatest literary minds in contemporary France! Jeanne had to wait until she reached her majority to marry, as Victor Hugo, no doubt mindful of his late daughter L\u00e9opoldine, whom he had perhaps seen reborn in Jeanne, had inserted a proviso into his will that meant she would not receive the main part of her sizeable inheritance if she married earlier. Jeanne decided the marriage at Passy should be a civil one, out of respect for her grandfather; it attracted large crowds of onlookers and was attended by the glitterati, who heard long eulogies to Victor Hugo and comparatively little about the happy couple.\n\nAt the time L\u00e9on Daudet was a great admirer of Victor Hugo, and appears to have remained obsessed with him for years. From 1885 he attended medical school with Jean-Baptiste Charcot, the son of a world-famous neurologist and friend of his father\u2019s, Dr J-M Charcot. For a while they and Georges (who did not attend university) were great pals, having fun running amok in Paris, fighting, drinking, politically active republicans, getting into the newspapers for their outrageous behaviour; but then Daudet failed his exams. He mortally offended Charcot by claiming that he only passed his medical examinations because his father was their professor. Charcot never forgave him.\n\nAfter his marriage in early 1891 he published his first novel. His mother had hoped that marriage to Jeanne would quieten him down, but his political views changed and hardened. He became a monarchist; following the publication by his father in 1886 of Edouard Drumont\u2019s La France juive he had become virulently anti-Semitic. He was, however, able to remain close to Georges Hugo for some years despite Georges\u2019 many Jewish friends. Like his father Alphonse Daudet, L\u00e9on was passionate about politics, irascible and easily offended. He was prone to fighting duels.\n\nL\u00e9on and Georges were united in their dislike of Georges\u2019 stepfather, Edouard Lockroy, and in later life Daudet reserved nearly as much venom for Lockroy as he did for Emile Zola, one of his main b\u00eates noires (although he had known him too from childhood). Jeanne had a son by Daudet, Charles, but the marriage was soon in trouble. Daudet tells us that in 1885, he decided, while at Hauteville House sorting out Hugo\u2019s belongings with Georges, that he would one day write a novel:\n\nWe were submerged in relics. At that time I got the ambitious idea of writing a monograph about a genius, in his particular field, including a study of his entourage. But I didn\u2019t get around to writing The black star for eight years, until 1893, in that same house where I discovered, in 1885, the remains, the crumbs, the debris of Hugo\u2019s fat head. Although I tried to disguise reality as much as I could, something of the truth remained, and when Lockroy read the proofs (anyway he hated Hugo and Hugo hated him) it caused quite some drama. Hauteville House is fated to host scenes, and would have been a perfect place to be included in the remarkable book by Edouard Estauni\u00e9: Objects talk.\n\n[Nous \u00e9tions submerg\u00e9s de reliques. Des cette \u00e9poque, me venait par l\u2019ambiance l\u2019id\u00e9e ambitieuse d\u2019une monographie d\u2019un homme de g\u00e9nie, dans son cadre et dans son milieu, avec r\u00e9actions sur l\u2019entourage. N\u00e9anmoins je ne devais \u00e9crire L\u2019Astre noir que huit ans plus tard, en 1893, dan cette m\u00eame maison ou m\u2019\u00e9taient apparus, en 1885 les restes, les miettes et d\u00e9bris de la grosse t\u00eate de Hugo. Bien que je me fusse appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9former la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 autant que possible, il en \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 quelque chose, et la lecture des \u00e9preuves de L\u2019Astre noir par Lockroy \u2013 lequel d\u2019ailleurs d\u00e9testait Hugo et \u00e9tait d\u00e9test\u00e9 de lui \u2013 fut l\u2019occasion d\u2019un joli drame. Hauteville-House est pr\u00e9destin\u00e9e aux sc\u00e8nes, et c\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e0 un fameux d\u00e9cor pour le remarquable livre d\u2019Edouard Estauni\u00e9 : les Choses parlent.]\n\nHe wrote this novel, The black star, while sitting in Hauteville House with his wife, Victor Hugo\u2019s beloved granddaughter, only two years in to their marriage. Jeanne divorced him in 1895 and was awarded custody of the children, whom Daudet (who had issued a counter-divorce suit) was prevented from seeing for thirteen years by Edouard Lockroy. Jeanne then had a couple of failed engagements in quick succession, before marrying Dr Jean-Baptiste Charcot, all-round boys\u2019 own hero, in 1896. Daudet and Charcot fought a duel, inevitably. Charcot was livid that Georges, who refused to attribute blame for the divorce to either party, did not drop Daudet, as Jeanne had requested. In fact Georges took Daudet\u2019s side (perhaps because of his antipathy to Lockroy). He upset his mother by turning his back on her in the street. In 1898, when the family was attending the first performance of Victor Hugo\u2019s play \u2018La Grand\u2019m\u00e8re,\u2019 Charcot saw Georges with Daudet, stormed over to him, accused him of disrespecting his sister and slapped him so hard he knocked him down. Georges accepted the challenge, and he and Daudet both sent seconds, but Charcot changed his mind. The next day they were in court. Apparently Jeanne Hugo had been very upset that Georges continued to take L\u00e9on Daudet to visit Hauteville House, a place so special to her. Charcot said that he and Georges had been friends, but that Georges had refused to speak to him after the divorce. He, Charcot, had only wanted to help an unfortunate young lady rebuild her life. A horrible scandal, written up with relish by the newspapers who compared the two sides to the Montagues and Capulets. In the end the court decided it was six of one and half-a-dozen of the other, and fined Charcot 50 francs.\n\nSadly, Jeanne did not take into account her knight in shining armour\u2019s ambitions to be an explorer. She divorced Charcot for desertion, serving the notice when he set out for the South Pole, and in 1906 settled down with a Greek naval captain, Michel Negroponte, who died at the early age of 42 in 1914. Jeanne sent Canon Bourde de la Rogerie some money for the poor children of Guernsey in remembrance of him. She came to Guernsey in 1927 when after Georges\u2019 death she and his children handed over Hauteville House to the City of Paris.\n\nDaudet last spoke to Georges Hugo in 1903. He married his cousin and had another son, Philippe. He wrote a biography of Victor Hugo called The tragic life of Victor Hugo, which he claimed was based on material he had learnt from the family. Although Hugo\u2019s life was in many ways tragic, the same could be said of L\u00e9on Daudet, whose son Philippe fell in with the anarchists (the polar opposite to his father) and who committed suicide at the age of fourteen by shooting himself in the head with a gun he had been given in order to commit a political assassination. L\u00e9on Daudet would not accept this and was determined that his son had been murdered. He went to prison for libel, escaped, went on the run, was pardoned. He renounced his antisemitism in 1929, disliked the Nazis but was quite keen on Mussolini. He died in 1942, supporting the Vichy administration, having written 9000 articles and 128 books. The devil does indeed have some of the best tunes, because L\u00e9on Daudet was a brilliant writer. Jeanne, who was extremely proud of her heritage and spent a great deal of time safeguarding her grandfather\u2019s memory and estate, died in Paris in 1941.\n\nJeanne\u2019s autograph, along with those of other members of the Hugo entourage, is to be found in the Priaulx Library\u2019s The Album of Maggie Lelean. Maggie was the daughter of a sea-captain, and she and her sisters were near neighbours of Hugo and his grandchildren in 1878; they played with Georges and Jeanne at Hauteville House."}, {"url": "https://frenchquest.com/2017/07/14/translating-victor-hugo-the-art-of-being-a-grandfather-lesson-one-the-moon/", "page_content": "Translating Victor Hugo: The Art of Being a Grandfather: Lesson One, The Moon\n\nThere is no experience in life that can compare to being a grandparent. The joy is pure and simple; there are fewer expectations and agendas. The time I spend with George Walker, 3, and Margot Rose, 9 months, is invaluable; for both sides. In L\u2019Art d\u2019\u00eatre grand-p\u00e8re (\u201cThe Art of Being a Grandfather\u201c) Victor Hugo shares his joys and experiences of being a grandparent in this beautiful book of poems, published in 1877. They were among the last he wrote. Tragically, Hugo outlived all of his children and became the guardian of Charles\u2019 children after his premature death in 1871. These poems were written shortly after.\n\nThis poem, The Art of Being a Grandfather, is taken from his first book of poems, Lesson One. Hugo is exploring nature with his granddaughter Jeanne. As I read his intimate conversation with her, I am reminded of the special moments with my own grandchildren; of introducing them to a new world and being inspired by their sense of wonderment and awe.\n\nPart II of this post is my English Translation. In the first line, as Hugo describes his little granddaughter sitting in the grass, contemplating her surroundings, I chose \u201csolemn\u201d in the translation of grave to represent the seriousness of Jeanne\u2019s expression as she surveys her surroundings and \u201cpink\u201d for rose as I imagined her little sun-kissed checks and frilly pin-a-fore. I love that Hugo used gruette to describe his protectiveness of Jeanne as one would \u201cwatch out for the enemy\u201d. In line 11, Hugo uses rauque and effrayante to describe the chanting of the sea which evokes fear in a child, but is necessary in their quest of wonderment. I also love the ending: As Hugo leads Jeanne to look for the small creatures, she leads her Pop Pop to the heavens!\n\n(*I took a liberty to add Pop Pop to the translation as this is George\u2019s name for his grandfather! I translated Hugo\u2019s One Year Old poem for George: .)\n\nThe Art of Being a Grandfather: Lesson One, The Moon by Victor Hugo\n\nJeanne songeait, sur l\u2019herbe assise, grave et rose ;\n\nJe m\u2019approchai : \u2014Dis-moi si tu veux quelque chose,\n\nJeanne ? \u2014car j\u2019ob\u00e9is \u00e0 ces charmants amours\n\nJe les guette, et je cherche \u00e0 comprendre toujours\n\nTout ce qui peut passer par ces divines t\u00eates.\n\nJeanne m\u2019a r\u00e9pondu : \u2014Je voudrais vois des b\u00eates.\n\nAlors je lui montrai dans l\u2019herbe une fourmi.\n\nVois ! \u2014Mais Jeanne ne fut contente qu\u2019\u00e0 demi.\n\n\u2014Non, les b\u00eates, c\u2019est gros, me dit-elle.\n\nLeur r\u00eave,\n\nC\u2019est le grand.

He became a deputy in the National Assembly (1871) but resigned the following month. Though he still fought for his old ideals, he no longer possessed the same energies. The trials of recent years had aged him, and there were more to come: in 1868 he had lost his wife, Ad\u00e8le, a profound sadness to him; in 1871 one son died, as did another in 1873. Though increasingly detached from life around him, the poet of L\u2019Ann\u00e9e terrible (1872), in which he recounted the siege of Paris during the \u201cterrible year\u201d of 1870, had become a national hero and a living symbol of republicanism in France. In 1878 Hugo was stricken by cerebral congestion, but he lived on for some years in the Avenue d\u2019Eylau, renamed Avenue Victor-Hugo on his 80th birthday. In 1885, two years after the death of his faithful companion Juliette, Hugo died and was given a national funeral. His body lay in state under the Arc de Triomphe and was buried in the Panth\u00e9on .\n\nReputation\n\nHugo\u2019s enormous output is unique in French literature; it is said that he wrote each morning 100 lines of verse or 20 pages of prose. \u201cThe most powerful mind of the Romantic movement,\u201d as he was described in 1830, laureate and peer of France in 1845, he went on to assume the role of an outlawed sage who, with the easy consciousness of authority, put down his insights and prophetic visions in prose and verse, becoming at last the genial grandfather of popular literary portraiture and the national poet who gave his name to a street in every town in France.\n\nThe recognition of Hugo as a great poet at the time of his death was followed by a period of critical neglect. A few of his poems were remembered, and Les Mis\u00e9rables continued to be widely read. The generosity of his ideas and the warmth of their expression still moved the public mind, for Hugo was a poet of the common man and knew how to write with simplicity and power of common joys and sorrows. But there was another side to him\u2014what Paul Claudel called his \u201cpanic contemplation\u201d of the universe, the numinous fear that penetrates his sombre poems La Fin de Satan and Dieu. Hugo\u2019s knowledge of the resources of French verse and his technical virtuosity in metre and rhyme, moreover, rescued French poetry from the sterility of the 18th century. Hugo is one of those rare writers who excites both popular and academic audiences alike."}], "Victor Hugo was the poet, novelist, and dramatist": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Victor-Hugo", "page_content": "Victor Hugo is remembered as a beloved writer of the people, who knew how to write with simplicity and power of common joys and sorrows. He is also remembered for the verbal inventiveness and technical virtuosity with which he created poems ranging from intimate lyrics to visionary and prophetic epics.\n\nVictor Hugo was an influential proponent of Romanticism . In a preface to his verse play Cromwell (1827), he called for a drama of action\u2014which he saw as appropriate to modern man, the battleground of matter and spirit\u2014that could transcend Classical categories and mix the sublime and the grotesque.\n\nPoet , novelist, and dramatist Victor Hugo is considered the most important of the French Romantic writers. Though regarded in France as one of that country\u2019s greatest poets, he is better known abroad for such novels as Notre-Dame de Paris (1831; The Hunchback of Notre-Dame) and Les Mis\u00e9rables (1862).\n\nVictor Hugo , in full Victor-Marie Hugo , (born February 26, 1802, Besan\u00e7on , France\u2014died May 22, 1885, Paris), poet, novelist, and dramatist who was the most important of the French Romantic writers. Though regarded in France as one of that country\u2019s greatest poets, he is better known abroad for such novels as Notre-Dame de Paris (1831) and Les Mis\u00e9rables (1862).\n\nHugo emerged as a true Romantic, however, with the publication in 1827 of his verse drama Cromwell . The subject of this play, with its near-contemporary overtones, is that of a national leader risen from the people who seeks to be crowned king. But the play\u2019s reputation rested largely on the long, elaborate preface, in which Hugo proposed a doctrine of Romanticism that for all its intellectual moderation was extremely provocative. He demanded a verse drama in which the contradictions of human existence\u2014good and evil, beauty and ugliness, tears and laughter\u2014would be resolved by the inclusion of both tragic and comic elements in a single play. Such a type of drama would abandon the formal rules of classical tragedy for the freedom and truth to be found in the plays of William Shakespeare . Cromwell itself, though immensely long and almost impossible to stage, was written in verse of great force and originality. In fact, the preface to Cromwell, as an important statement of the tenets of Romanticism, has proved far more important than the play itself.\n\nIn 1823 he published his first novel, Han d\u2019Islande, which in 1825 appeared in an English translation as Hans of Iceland. The journalist Charles Nodier was enthusiastic about it and drew Hugo into the group of friends, all devotees of Romanticism , who met regularly at the Biblioth\u00e8que de L\u2019Arsenal. While frequenting this literary circle, which was called the C\u00e9nacle , Hugo shared in launching a new review of moderate tendencies, the Muse Fran\u00e7aise (1823\u201324). In 1824 he published a new verse collection, Nouvelles Odes, and followed it two years later with an exotic romance, Bug-Jargal (Eng. trans. The Slave King). In 1826 he also published Odes et ballades, an enlarged edition of his previously printed verse, the latest of these poems being brilliant variations on the fashionable Romantic modes of mirth and terror. The youthful vigour of these poems was also characteristic of another collection, Les Orientales (1829), which appealed to the Romantic taste for Oriental local colour. In these poems Hugo, while skillfully employing a great variety of metres in his verse and using ardent and brilliant imagery, was also gradually shedding the legitimist royalism of his youth. It may be noted, too, that \u201cLe Feu du ciel,\u201d a visionary poem, forecast those he was to write 25 years later. The fusion of the contemporary with the apocalyptic was always a particular mark of Hugo\u2019s genius.\n\nFrom 1816, at least, Hugo had conceived ambitions other than the law. He was already filling notebooks with verses, translations\u2014particularly from Virgil \u2014two tragedies, a play, and elegies. Encouraged by his mother, Hugo founded a review, the Conservateur Litt\u00e9raire (1819\u201321), in which his own articles on the poets Alphonse de Lamartine and Andr\u00e9 de Ch\u00e9nier stand out. His mother died in 1821, and a year later Victor married a childhood friend, Ad\u00e8le Foucher, with whom he had five children. In that same year he published his first book of poems, Odes et po\u00e9sies diverses, whose royalist sentiments earned him a pension from Louis XVIII . Behind Hugo\u2019s concern for classical form and his political inspiration, it is possible to recognize in these poems a personal voice and his own particular vein of fantasy.\n\nVictor was the third son of Joseph-L\u00e9opold-Sigisbert Hugo, a major and, later, general in Napoleon \u2019s army. His childhood was coloured by his father\u2019s constant traveling with the imperial army and by the disagreements that soon alienated his parents from one another. His mother\u2019s royalism and his father\u2019s loyalty to successive governments\u2014the Convention, the Empire, the Restoration\u2014reflected their deeper incompatibility. It was a chaotic time for Victor, continually uprooted from Paris to set out for Elba or Naples or Madrid , yet always returning to Paris with his mother, whose royalist opinions he initially adopted. The fall of the empire gave him, from 1815 to 1818, a time of uninterrupted study at the Pension Cordier and the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand, after which he graduated from the law faculty at Paris, where his studies seem to have been purposeless and irregular. Memories of his life as a poor student later inspired the figure of Marius in his novel Les Mis\u00e9rables.\n\nSuccess (1830\u201351)\n\nThe defense of freedom and the cult of an idealized Napoleon in such poems as the ode \u201c\u00c0 la Colonne\u201d and \u201cLui\u201d brought Hugo into touch with the liberal group of writers on the newspaper Le Globe, and his move toward liberalism was strengthened by the French king Charles X\u2019s restrictions on the liberty of the press as well as by the censor\u2019s prohibiting the stage performance of his play Marion de Lorme (1829), which portrays the character of Louis XIII unfavourably. Hugo immediately retorted with Hernani, the first performance of which, on February 25, 1830, gained victory for the young Romantics over the Classicists in what came to be known as the battle of Hernani. In this play Hugo extolled the Romantic hero in the form of a noble outlaw at war with society, dedicated to a passionate love and driven on by inexorable fate. The actual impact of the play owed less to the plot than to the sound and beat of the verse, which was softened only in the elegiac passages spoken by Hernani and Do\u00f1a Sol.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The Hunchback of Notre-Dame), an evocation of life in medieval Paris during the reign of Louis XI. The novel condemns a society that, in the persons of Frollo the archdeacon and Phoebus the soldier, heaps misery on the hunchback Quasimodo and the gypsy girl Esmeralda. The theme touched the public consciousness more deeply than had that of his previous novel, Le Dernier Jour d\u2019un condamn\u00e9 (1829; The Last Days of a Condemned), the story of a condemned man\u2019s last day, in which Hugo launched a humanitarian protest against the death penalty. While Notre-Dame was being written, Louis-Philippe, a constitutional king, had been brought to power by the July Revolution. Hugo composed a poem in honour of this event, Dict\u00e9 apr\u00e9s juillet 1830. It was a forerunner of much of his political verse.\n\nFour books of poems came from Hugo in the period of the July Monarchy: Les Feuilles d\u2019automne (1831; \u201cAutumn Leaves\u201d), intimate and personal in inspiration; Les Chants du cr\u00e9puscule (1835; Songs of Twilight), overtly political; Les Voix int\u00e9rieures (1837; \u201cInner Voices\u201d), both personal and philosophical; and Les Rayons et les ombres (1840; \u201cSunlight and Shadows\u201d), in which the poet, renewing these different themes, indulges his gift for colour and picturesque detail. But Hugo was not content merely to express personal emotions; he wanted to be what he called the \u201csonorous echo\u201d of his time. In his verse political and philosophical problems were integrated with the religious and social disquiet of the period; one poem evoked the misery of the workers, another praised the efficacy of prayer. He addressed many poems to the glory of Napoleon, though he shared with his contemporaries the reversion to republican ideals. Hugo restated the problems of his century and the great and eternal human questions, and he spoke with a warmhearted eloquence and reasonableness that moved people\u2019s souls.\n\nSo intense was Hugo\u2019s creative activity during these years that he also continued to pour out plays. There were two motives for this: first, he needed a platform for his political and social ideas, and, second, he wished to write parts for a young and beautiful actress, Juliette Drouet, with whom he had begun a liaison in 1833. Juliette had little talent and soon renounced the stage in order to devote herself exclusively to him, becoming the discreet and faithful companion she was to remain until her death in 1883. The first of these plays was another verse drama, Le Roi s\u2019amuse (1832; Eng. trans. The King\u2019s Fool), set in Renaissance France and depicting the frivolous love affairs of Francis I while revealing the noble character of his court jester. This play was at first banned but was later used by Giuseppe Verdi as the libretto of his opera Rigoletto. Three prose plays followed: Lucr\u00e8ce Borgia and Marie Tudor in 1833 and Angelo, tyran de Padoue (\u201cAngelo, Tyrant of Padua\u201d) in 1835. Ruy Blas, a play in verse, appeared in 1838 and was followed by Les Burgraves in 1843.\n\nHugo\u2019s literary achievement was recognized in 1841 by his election, after three unsuccessful attempts, to the French Academy and by his nomination in 1845 to the Chamber of Peers. From this time he almost ceased to publish, partly because of the demands of society and political life but also as a result of personal loss: his daughter L\u00e9opoldine, recently married, was accidentally drowned with her husband in September 1843. Hugo\u2019s intense grief found some mitigation in poems that later appeared in Les Contemplations, a volume that he divided into \u201cAutrefois\u201d and \u201cAujourd\u2019hui,\u201d the moment of his daughter\u2019s death being the mark between yesterday and today. He found relief above all in working on a new novel, which became Les Mis\u00e9rables, published in 1862 after work on it had been set aside for a time and then resumed.\n\nWith the Revolution of 1848, Hugo was elected a deputy for Paris in the Constituent Assembly and later in the Legislative Assembly. He supported the successful candidacy of Prince Louis-Napol\u00e9on for the presidency that year. The more the president evolved toward an authoritarianism of the right, however, the more Hugo moved toward the assembly\u2019s left. When in December 1851 a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat took place, which eventually resulted in the Second Empire under Napoleon III, Hugo made one attempt at resistance and then fled to Brussels."}, {"url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/biography-of-victor-hugo-4775732", "page_content": "Victor Hugo (February 26, 1802 \u2013 May 22, 1885) was a French poet and novelist during the Romantic Movement.

He had two older brothers: Abel Joseph Hugo (born 1798) and Eug\u00e8ne Hugo (born 1800). Hugo\u2019s father was a general in the French army and a fervent supporter of Napoleon. As a result of his military career, the family moved frequently, including stints in Naples and Rome. For the most part, though, he spent his early years in Paris with his mother.\n\nHugo\u2019s childhood was a time of immense political and military turmoil in France. In 1804, when Hugo was 2 years old, Napoleon was proclaimed emperor of France; a little over a decade later, the monarchy of the House of Bourbon was restored. These tensions were represented in Hugo\u2019s own family: his father was a general with republican beliefs and a supporter of Napoleon, while his mother was Catholic and fervently royalist; her lover (and Hugo\u2019s godfather) General Victor Lahorie was executed for conspiracies against Napoleon. Hugo\u2019s mother was primarily responsible for his upbringing, and as a result, his early education was both intensely religious and strongly biased towards pro-monarchy sentiments.\n\nAd\u00e8le Foucher married Victor Hugo in 1821. Maison de Victor Hugo - Hauteville House / Paris Mus\u00e9es / public domain\n\nAs a young man, Hugo fell in love with Ad\u00e8le Foucher, his childhood friend. They were well-matched in personality and in age (Foucher was only one year younger than Hugo), but his mother strongly disapproved of their relationship. Because of this, Hugo would not marry anyone else, but would not marry Foucher while his mother was still alive, either. Sophie Hugo died in 1821, and the couple were able to marry the following year, when Hugo was 21. They had their first child, Leopold, in 1823, but he died in infancy. Eventually, they were the parents of four children: two daughters (Leopoldine and Adele) and two sons (Charles and Fran\u00e7ois-Victor).\n\nEarly Poetry and Plays (1822-1830)\n\nOdes et po\u00e9sies diverses (1822)\n\nOdes (1823)\n\nHan d'Islande (1823)\n\nNouvelles Odes (1824)\n\nBug-Jargal (1826)\n\nOdes et Ballades (1826)\n\nCromwell (1827)\n\nLe Dernier jour d'un condamn\u00e9 (1829)\n\nHernani (1830)\n\nHugo began writing as a very young man, with his first publication coming in 1822, the same year as his marriage. His first collection of poetry, titled Odes et po\u00e9sies diverses was published when he was only 20 years old. The poems were so admired for their elegant language and passion that they came to the attention of the king, Louis XVIII, and earned Hugo a royal pension. He also published his first novel, Han d'Islande, in 1823.\n\nIn these early days\u2014and, indeed, through much of his writing career\u2014Hugo was heavily influenced by one of his predecessors, French writer Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand, who was one of the preeminent literary figures in the Romantic Movement and one of France's most visible writers during the early 19th century. As a young man, Hugo vowed to be \"Chateaubriand or nothing,\" and in many ways, he got his wish. Like his hero, Hugo became both an icon of Romanticism and an involved party in politics, which eventually led to his exile from his homeland.\n\nVictor Hugo began writing as a very young man. Maison de Victor Hugo - Hauteville House / Paris Mus\u00e9es / public domain\n\nAlthough the youthful, spontaneous nature of his early poems put him on the map, Hugo\u2019s later work soon evolved to show off his remarkable skill and craftsmanship. In 1826, he published his second volume of poetry, this one titled Odes et Ballades. This work, in contrast to his more precocious first work, was more technically skillful and contained several well-received ballads and more.\n\nHugo\u2019s early writings were not solely confined to poetry, though. He became a leader in the Romantic Movement with several plays during this time as well. His plays Cromwell (1827) and Hernani (1830) were at the epicenter of literary debates about the Romantic Movement\u2019s tenets versus the rules of neoclassical writing. Hernani, in particular, sparked intense debate between traditionalists and Romantics; it came to be considered the vanguard of French Romantic drama. Hugo\u2019s first work of prose fiction was also published during this time. Le Dernier jour d'un condamn\u00e9 (The Last Day of a Condemned Man) was published in 1829. Telling the story of a man condemned to death, the short novel was the first appearance of the strong social conscience that Hugo\u2019s later works would be known for.\n\nFirst Novel and Further Writing (1831-1850)\n\nNotre-Dame de Paris (1831)\n\nLe roi s'amuse (1832)\n\nLucrezia Borgia (1833)\n\nMarie Tudor (1833)\n\nRuy Blas (1838)\n\nLes Rayons et les Ombres (1840)\n\nLe Rhin (1842)\n\nLes Burgraves (1843)\n\nIn 1831, Notre-Dame de Paris, known in English as The Hunchback of Notre Dame, was published; it was Hugo\u2019s first full-length novel. It became a huge hit and was quickly translated into other languages for readers across Europe. The novel\u2019s biggest legacy, though, was much more than literary. Its popularity led to a surge of interest in the real Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, which had fallen into disrepair as a result of ongoing neglect.\n\nThe renovations to Notre Dame inspired by Hugo saved the cathedral from ruin. IAISI / Getty Images\n\nBecause of the stream of tourists who loved the novel and wanted to visit the real cathedral, the city of Paris began a major renovation project in 1844. The renovations and restorations lasted for 20 years and included the replacement of the famous spire; the spire built during this period stood for nearly 200 years, until it was destroyed in the 2019 Notre Dame fire. On a broader scale, the novel led to a renewed interest in pre-Renaissance buildings, which began to be cared for and restored more than they had in the past.\n\nHugo\u2019s life during this period was also subject to some immense personal tragedy, which influenced his writing for some time. In 1843, his oldest (and favorite) daughter, Leopoldine, drowned in a boating accident when she was a 19-year-old newlywed. Her husband also died while trying to save her. Hugo wrote \"\u00c0 Villequier,\u201d one of his most famous poems, in mourning for his daughter.\n\nVictor Hugo circa 1840, engraving by J. Sartain from the original painting by Maurir. Kean Collection / Getty Images\n\nDuring this period, Hugo also spent some time in political life. After three attempts, he was finally elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise (a council on French arts and letters) in 1841 and spoke in defense of the Romantic Movement. In 1845, he was raised to the peerage by King Louis Philippe I and spent his career in the Higher Chamber speaking out for issues of social justice\u2014against the death penalty, for freedom of the press. He continued his political career via election to the National Assembly of the Second Republic in 1848, where he broke ranks with his fellow conservatives to denounce widespread poverty and to advocate for universal suffrage, the abolition of the death penalty, and free education for all children. However, his political career came to an abrupt end in 1851, when Napoleon III took over in a coup. Hugo strongly opposed Napoleon III\u2019s reign, calling him a traitor, and as a result, he lived in exile outside of France.\n\nWriting While in Exile (1851-1874)\n\nLes Ch\u00e2timents (1853)\n\nLes Contemplations (1856\n\nLes Mis\u00e9rables (1862)\n\nLes Travailleurs de la Mer (1866)\n\nL'Homme qui rit (1869)\n\nQuatre-vingt-treize (Ninety-Three) (1874)\n\nHugo eventually settled in Guernsey, a small island under British jurisdiction in the English Channel off the French coast of Normandy. Although he did continue to write political content, including several anti-Napoleon pamphlets that were banned in France yet still managed to make an impact, Hugo went back to his roots with poetry. He produced three volumes of poetry: Les Ch\u00e2timents in 1853, Les Contemplations in 1856, and La L\u00e9gende des si\u00e8cles in 1859.\n\nFor many years, Hugo had planned a novel about social injustices and the misery suffered by the poor. It wasn\u2019t until 1862 that this novel was published: Les Mis\u00e9rables. The novel sprawls over a few decades, interweaving stories of an escaped parolee, a dogged policeman, an abused factory worker, a rebellious young rich man, and more, all leading up to the June Rebellion of 1832, a historical populist uprising that Hugo had witnessed himself. Hugo believed the novel to be the pinnacle of his work, and it became immensely popular among readers almost instantly. However, the critical establishment was much harsher, with almost universally negative reviews. In the end, it was the readers who won out: Les Mis became a genuine phenomenon which remains popular in the modern day, and has been translated into many languages and adapted into several other mediums.\n\nThis page from an illustrated edition of Les Mis\u00e9rables shows Cosette, a main character. Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France / public domain\n\nIn 1866, Hugo published Les Travailleurs de la Mer (The Toilers of the Sea), which pivoted away from the themes of social justice in his previous novel. Instead, it told a quasi-mythic tale about a young man trying to bring home a ship to impress his father, while battling natural forces and a giant sea monster. The book was dedicated to Guernsey, where he lived for 15 years. He also produced two more novels, which returned to more political and social themes. L'Homme Qui Rit (The Man Who Laughs) was published in 1869 and took a critical view of the aristocracy, while Quatre-vingt-treize (Ninety-Three) was published in 1874 and dealt with the Reign of Terror following the French Revolution. By this time, realism and naturalism were coming into vogue, and Hugo\u2019s Romantic style decreased in popularity. Quatre-vingt-treize would be his last novel.\n\nLiterary Styles and Themes\n\nHugo covered a wide variety of literary themes throughout his career, ranging from politically charged content to much more personal writings. In the latter category, he wrote several of his most acclaimed poems about his daughter\u2019s untimely death and his own grief. He expressed his concerns for the welfare of others and of historical institutions, with themes reflecting his own republican beliefs and his anger at injustices and inequality.\n\nHugo was one of the most notable representatives of romanticism in France, from his prose to his poetry and plays. As such, his works largely embraced Romantic ideals of individualism, intense emotions, and a focus on heroic characters and actions. These ideals can be seen in many of his works, including some of his most notable ones. Sweeping emotion is a hallmark of Hugo\u2019s novels, with language that drops the reader into the intense feelings of passionate, complicated characters. Even his most famous villains\u2014Archdeacon Frollo and Inspector Javert\u2014are permitted inner turmoil and strong feelings. In some cases, in his novels, Hugo\u2019s narrative voice goes into immense detail about specific ideas or places, with intensely descriptive language.\n\nPortrait of Victor Hugo later in life. pictore / Getty Images\n\nLater in his career, Hugo became notable for his focus on themes of justice and suffering. His anti-monarchical views were on display in The Man Who Laughs, which turned a harsh eye on the aristocratic establishment. Most famously, of course, he focused Les Mis\u00e9rables on the plight of the poor and the horrors of injustice, which are depicted both on an individual scale (the journey of Jean Valjean) and a societal one (the June Rebellion). Hugo himself, in the voice of his narrator, describes the book thusly towards the end of the novel: \u201cThe book which the reader has before him at this moment is, from one end to the other, in its entirety and details ... a progress from evil to good, from injustice to justice, from falsehood to truth, from night to day, from appetite to conscience, from corruption to life; from bestiality to duty, from hell to heaven, from nothingness to God. The starting point: matter, destination: the soul.\u201d\n\nDeath\n\nHugo returned to France in 1870, but his life was never quite the same. He suffered a series of personal tragedies: the death of his wife and two sons, the loss of his daughter to an asylum, the death of his mistress, and he suffered a stroke himself. In 1881, he was honored for his contributions to French society; a street in Paris was even renamed for him and bears his name to this day.\n\nThe sign for Avenue Victor Hugo in Paris's 16th arrondissement. Jupiterimages / Getty Images\n\nOn May 20, 1885, Hugo died of pneumonia at the age of 83. His death sparked mourning across France due to his immense influence and the affection the French held for him. He had requested a quiet funeral but was instead given a state funeral, with over 2 million mourners joining the funeral procession in Paris. He was buried in the Panth\u00e9on, in the same crypt as Alexandre Dumas and \u00c9mile Zola, and left 50,000 francs to the poor in his will.\n\nLegacy\n\nVictor Hugo is widely considered an icon of French literature and culture, to the point where many French cities have streets or squares named after him. He is, certainly, among the most recognizable French writers, and his works continue to be widely read, studied, and adapted in the modern day. In particular, his novels The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Les Mis\u00e9rables have had a long and popular life, with multiple adaptations and entry into mainstream popular culture.\n\nA musical production of Les Mis\u00e9rables was performed in Tehran, Iran in 2018.

His work was a strong influence in the music world, especially given his friendship with composers Franz Liszt and Hector Berlioz, and many operas and other musical works were inspired by his writing\u2014a trend which continues into the contemporary world, with the musical version of Les Mis\u00e9rables becoming one of the most popular musicals of all time. Hugo lived through a time of intense upheaval and societal change, and he managed to stand out as one of the most notable figures of a notable time.\n\nSources"}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/victor-hugo", "page_content": "(1802-1885)\n\nWho Was Victor Hugo?\n\nVictor Hugo was a French poet and novelist who, after training as a lawyer, embarked on the literary career. He became one of the most important French Romantic poets, novelists and dramatists of his time, having assembled a massive body of work while living in Paris, Brussels and the Channel Islands. Hugo died on May 22, 1885, in Paris.\n\nEarly Life\n\nVictor-Marie Hugo was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, on February 26, 1802, to mother Sophie Tr\u00e9buche and father Joseph-L\u00e9opold-Sigisbert Hugo. His father was a military officer who later served as a general under Napoleon.\n\n'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'\n\nHugo studied law between 1815 and 1818, though he never committed himself to legal practice. Encouraged by his mother, Hugo embarked on a career in literature. He founded the Conservateur Litteraire, a journal in which he published his own poetry and the work of his friends. His mother died in 1821. The same year, Hugo married Ad\u00e8le Foucher and published his first book of poetry, Odes et po\u00e9sies diverses. His first novel was published in 1823, followed by a number of plays.\n\nHugo's innovative brand of Romanticism developed over the first decade of his career.\n\nIn 1831, he published one of his most enduring works, Notre-Dame de Paris (The Hunchback of Notre Dame). Set in the medieval period, the novel presents a harsh criticism of the society that degrades and shuns the hunchback, Quasimodo. This was Hugo's most celebrated work to date and paved the way for his subsequent political writing.\n\n'Les Mis\u00e9rables'\n\nA prolific writer, Hugo was established as one of the most celebrated literary figures in France by the 1840s. In 1841, he was elected to the French Academy and nominated for the Chamber of Peers. He stepped back from publishing his work following the accidental drowning of his daughter and her husband in 1843. In private, he began work on a piece of writing that would become Les Mis\u00e9rables.\n\nHugo fled to Brussels following a coup in 1851. He lived in Brussels and in Britain until his return to France in 1870. Much of the work that Hugo published during this period conveys biting sarcasm and fierce social criticism. Among these works is the novel Les Mis\u00e9rables, which was finally published in 1862. The book was an immediate success in Europe and the United States. Later reinterpreted as a theatrical musical and a film, Les Mis\u00e9rables remains one of the best-known works of 19th-century literature.\n\nDeath and Legacy\n\nThough Hugo returned to France after 1870 as a symbol of republican triumph, his later years were largely sad. He lost two sons between 1871 and 1873. His later works are somewhat darker than his earlier writing, focusing on themes of God, Satan and death.\n\nIn 1878, he was stricken with cerebral congestion. Hugo and his mistress, Juliette, continued to live in Paris for the rest of their lives. The street on which he lived was renamed Avenue Victor Hugo on the occasion of his 80th birthday in 1882. Juliette died the following year and Hugo died in Paris on May 22, 1885. He received a hero's funeral. His body lay in state beneath the Arc de Triomphe before burial in the Panth\u00e9on.\n\nHugo remains one of the giants of French literature. Although French audiences celebrate him primarily as a poet, he is better known as a novelist in English-speaking countries.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Victor\n\nBirth Year: 1802\n\nBirth date: February 26, 1802\n\nBirth City: Besan\u00e7on\n\nBirth Country: France\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Victor Hugo is a celebrated French Romantic author best known for his poetry and his novels, including 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' and 'Les Mis\u00e9rables.'\n\nIndustries\n\nFiction and Poetry\n\n\n\nTheater and Dance\n\nAstrological Sign: Pisces\n\nNacionalities\n\nFrench\n\nDeath Year: 1885\n\nDeath date: May 22, 1885\n\nDeath City: Paris\n\nDeath Country: France\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION\n\nArticle Title: Victor Hugo Biography\n\nAuthor: Biography.com Editors\n\nWebsite Name: The Biography.com website\n\nUrl: https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/victor-hugo\n\nAccess Date:\n\nPublisher: A&E; Television Networks\n\nLast Updated: April 1, 2021\n\nOriginal Published Date: April 2, 2014\n\nQUOTES"}, {"url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/victor-hugo/m01vh096?hl=en", "page_content": "Victor-Marie Hugo was a French poet, novelist, essayist, playwright, and dramatist of the Romantic movement.

Born and raised in a royalist Catholic family, Hugo would\u2014like so many of the Romantics\u2014rebel against the conservative political and religious establishment in favor of liberal republicanism and the revolutionary cause. Hugo, like Gustave Flaubert, was disgusted with what he saw as the corruption of imperial France and with the Church's complicity in social injustices, and he devoted much of his energies (both in fiction and in essays) to overthrowing the monarchy.\n\nWhile he made significant contributions to the revolutionary cause, Hugo was much more than a political activist. He was one of the most gifted writers of his times. Like Charles Dickens in England, Hugo became immensely popular among the working classes, viewed as a hero who exposed the underbelly of French society.\n\nHugo was recognized and continues to be lauded as a major force within the literary community. More than perhaps any other French author with the exception of Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand, Hugo ushered in the literary movement of Romanticism in France, which would become one of the most influential movements in the history of French and all European literature. Hugo espoused the virtues of Romanticism\u2014liberty, individualism, spirit, and nature\u2014which would become the tenets of high art for generations.\n\nIn his poetry, which in France is considered to be of equal worth to his frequently-translated novels, Hugo brought the lyrical style of German and English Romantic poets into the French language, in effect setting into motion a sea-change in the style of nineteenth-century French poetry. Among many volumes of poetry, Les Contemplations and La L\u00e9gende des si\u00e8cles stand particularly high in critical esteem. In the English-speaking world his best-known works are the novels Les Mis\u00e9rables and Notre-Dame de Paris (sometimes translated into English (to Hugo's dismay) as The Hunchback of Notre-Dame).\n\nHugo is a towering figure in French literature and politics, and in the Western movement of Romanticism.\n\nEarly life and influences\n\nVictor Hugo as a young man\n\nVictor Hugo was the youngest son of Joseph L\u00e9opold Sigisbert Hugo (1773\u20131828) and Sophie Tr\u00e9buchet (1772-1821). He was born in 1802 in Besan\u00e7on (in the region of Franche-Comt\u00e9) and lived in France for the majority of his life. However, he was forced to go into exile during the reign of Napoleon III\u2014he lived briefly in Brussels during 1851; in Jersey from 1852 to 1855; and in Guernsey from 1855 until his return to France in 1870.\n\n\n\nHugo's early childhood was turbulent. The century prior to his birth saw the overthrow of the Bourbon Dynasty in the French Revolution, the rise and fall of the First Republic, and the rise of the First French Empire and dictatorship under Napoleon Bonaparte. Napoleon was proclaimed Emperor two years after Hugo's birth, and the Bourbon Monarchy was restored before his eighteenth birthday. The opposing political and religious views of Hugo's parents reflected the forces that would battle for supremacy in France throughout his life: Hugo's father was a high-ranking officer in Napoleon's army, an atheist republican who considered Napoleon a hero; his mother was a staunch Catholic Royalist who is suspected of taking General Victor Lahorie as her lover, who was executed in 1812 for plotting against Napoleon.\n\nSophie followed her husband to posts in Italy where he served as a governor of a province near Naples, and Spain where he took charge of three Spanish provinces. Eventually weary of the constant moving required by military life, and at odds with her unfaithful husband, Sophie separated from L\u00e9opold in 1803 and settled in Paris. Thereafter she dominated Victor's education and upbringing. As a result, Hugo's early work in poetry and fiction reflect a passionate devotion to both the king and faith. It was only later, during the events leading up to France's 1848 Revolution, that he would begin to rebel against his Catholic Royalist education and instead champion Republicanism and free thought.\n\nEarly poetry and fiction\n\nLike many young writers of his generation, Hugo was profoundly influenced by Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand, the founder of Romanticism and France\u2019s pre-eminent literary figure duing the early 1800s. In his youth, Hugo resolved to be \u201cChateaubriand or nothing,\" and his life would come to parallel that of his predecessor\u2019s in many ways. Like Chateaubriand, Hugo would further the cause of Romanticism, become involved in politics as a champion of Republicanism, and be forced into exile due to his political stances.\n\nThe precocious passion and eloquence of Hugo's early work brought success and fame at an early age. His first collection of poetry Nouvelles Odes et Poesies Diverses was published in 1824, when Hugo was only 22 years old, and earned him a royal pension from Louis XVIII. Though the poems were admired for their spontaneous fervor and fluency, it was the collection that followed two years later in 1826 Odes et Ballades that revealed Hugo to be a great poet, a natural master of lyric and creative song.\n\nAgainst his mother's wishes, young Victor fell in love and became secretly engaged to his childhood sweetheart, Ad\u00e8le Foucher (1803-1868). Unusually close to his mother, it was only after her death in 1821 that he felt free to marry Ad\u00e8le the following year. He published his first novel the following year Han d'Islande (1823), and his second three years later Bug-Jargal (1826). Between 1829 and 1840 he would publish five more volumes of poetry; Les Orientales (1829), Les Feuilles d'automne (1831), Les Chants du cr\u00e9puscule (1835), Les Voix int\u00e9rieures (1837), and Les Rayons et les ombres (1840), cementing his reputation as one of the greatest elegiac and lyric poets of his time.\n\nTheatrical work\n\nHugo did not achieve such quick success with his works for the stage. In 1827, he published the never-staged verse drama Cromwell, which became more famous for the author's preface than its own worth. The play's unwieldy length was considered \"unfit for acting.\" In his introduction to the work, Hugo urged his fellow artists to free themselves from the restrictions imposed by the French classical style of theater, and thus sparked a fierce debate between French Classicism and Romanticism that would rage for many years. Cromwell was followed in 1828 by the disastrous Amy Robsart, an experimental play from his youth based on the Walter Scott novel Kenilworth, which was produced under the name of his brother-in-law Paul Foucher and managed to survive only one performance before a less-than-appreciative audience.\n\nThe first play of Hugo's to be accepted for production under his own name was Marion de Lorme. Though initially banned by the censors for its unflattering portrayal of the French monarchy, it was eventually allowed to premiere uncensored in 1829, but without success. However, the play that Hugo produced the following year\u2014Hernani\u2014would prove to be one of the most successful and groundbreaking events of nineteenth century French theatre. On its opening night, the play became known as the \"Battle of Hernani.\" Today the work is largely forgotten, except as the basis for the Giuseppe Verdi opera of the same name. However, at the time, performances of the work sparked near-riots between opposing camps of French letters and society: classicists versus romantics, liberals versus conformists, and republicans versus royalists. The play was largely condemned by the press, but played to full houses night after night, and all but crowned Hugo as the preeminent leader of French Romanticism. It also signaled that Hugo's concept of Romanticism was growing increasingly politicized. Romanticism, he expressed, would liberate the arts from the constraints of classicism just as liberalism would free the politics of his country from the tyranny of monarchy and dictatorship.\n\nIn 1832 Hugo followed the success of Hernani with Le roi s'amuse (The King Takes His Amusement). The play was promptly banned by the censors after only one performance, due to its overt mockery of the French nobility, but then went on to be very popular in printed form. Incensed by the ban, Hugo wrote his next play, Lucr\u00e9ce Borgia (see: Lucrezia Borgia), in only fourteen days. It subsequently appeared on the stage in 1833, to great success. Mademoiselle George the former mistress of Napoleon was cast in the main role, and an actress named Juliette Drouet played a subordinate part. However, Drouet would go on to play a major role in Hugo\u2019s personal life, becoming his life-long mistress and muse. While Hugo had many romantic escapades throughout his life, Drouet was recognized even by his wife to have a unique relationship with the writer, and was treated almost as family. In Hugo\u2019s next play (Marie Tudor, 1833), Drouet played Lady Jane Grey to George\u2019s Queen Mary. However, she was not considered adequate to the role, and was replaced by another actress after opening night. It would be her last role on the French stage; thereafter she devoted her life to Hugo. Supported by a small pension, she became his unpaid secretary and travel companion for the next fifty years.\n\nHugo\u2019s Angelo premiered in 1835, to great success. Soon afterward the Duke of New Orleans and brother of King Louis-Philippe, an admirer of Hugo\u2019s work, founded a new theatre to support new plays. Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Renaissance opened in November 1838 with the premiere of Ruy Blas. Though considered by many to be Hugo\u2019s best drama, at the time it met with only average success. Hugo did not produce another play until 1843. The Burgraves played for only 33 nights, losing audiences to a competing drama, and it would be his last work written for the theater. Though he would later write the short verse drama Torquemada in 1869, it was not published until a few years before his death in 1882 and was never intended for the stage. However, Hugo's interest in the theater continued, and in 1864 he published a well-received essay on William Shakespeare, whose style he tried to emulate in his own dramas.\n\nMature fiction\n\nVictor Hugo's first mature work of fiction appeared in 1829, and reflected the acute social conscience that would infuse his later work. Le Dernier jour d'un condamn\u00e9 (\u201cLast Days of a Condemned Man\u201d) would have a profound influence on later writers such as Albert Camus, Charles Dickens, and Fyodor Dostoevsky. Claude Gueux, a documentary short story that appeared in 1834 about a real-life murderer who had been executed in France, was considered by Hugo himself to be a precursor to his great work on social injustice, Les Miserables. But Hugo\u2019s first full-length novel would be the enormously successful Notre-Dame de Paris (\u201cThe Hunchback of Notre Dame\u201d), which was published in 1831 and quickly translated into other European languages. One of the effects of the novel was to shame the City of Paris to undertake a restoration of the much neglected Cathedral of Notre Dame, which was now attracting thousands of tourists who had read the popular novel. The book also inspired a renewed appreciation for pre-renaissance buildings, which thereafter began to be actively preserved.\n\nHugo began planning a major novel about social misery and injustice as early as the 1830s, but it would take a full 17 years for his greatest work, Les Miserables, to be realized and finally published in 1862. The author was acutely aware of the quality of the novel and publication of the work went to the highest bidder. The Belgian publishing house Lacroix and Verboeckhoven undertook a marketing campaign unusual for the time, issuing press releases about the work a full six months before the launch. It also initially published only the first part of the novel (\"Fantine\"), which was launched simultaneously in major cities. Installments of the book sold out within hours, exerting an enormous impact on French society. Response ranged from wild enthusiasm to intense condemnation, but the issues highlighted in Les Miserables were soon on the agenda of the French National Assembly. Today the novel is considered a literary masterpiece, adapted for cinema, television and musical stage to an extent equaled by few other works of literature.\n\nHugo turned away from social/political issues in his next novel, Les Travailleurs de la Mer (\u201cToilers of the Sea\u201d), published in 1866. Nonetheless, the book was well received, perhaps due to the previous success of Les Miserables. Dedicated to the channel island of Guernsey where he spent 15 years of exile, Hugo\u2019s depiction of man\u2019s battle with the sea and the horrible creatures lurking beneath its depths spawned an unusual fad in Paris, namely squid. From squid dishes and exhibitions, to squid hats and parties, Parisiennes became fascinated by these unusual sea creatures, which at the time were still considered by many to be mythical.\n\nHugo returned to political and social issues in his next novel, L'Homme Qui Rit (\u201cThe Man Who Laughs\u201d), which was published in 1869 and painted a critical picture of the aristocracy. However, the novel was not as successful as his previous efforts, and Hugo himself began to comment on the growing distance between himself and literary contemporaries such as Gustave Flaubert and Emile Zola, whose naturalist novels were now exceeding the popularity of his own work. His last novel, Quatrevingt-treize (\u201cNinety-Three\u201d), published in 1874, dealt with a subject that Hugo had previously avoided: the Reign of Terror that followed the French Revolution. Though Hugo\u2019s popularity was on the decline at the time of its publication, many now consider Ninety-Three to be a powerful work on par with Hugo\u2019s better-known novels.\n\nLes Miserables\n\nLes Mis\u00e9rables (trans. variously as \u201cThe Miserable Ones,\u201d \u201cThe Wretched,\u201d \u201cThe Poor Ones,\u201d \u201cThe Victims\u201d) is Hugo's masterpiece, ranking with Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace and Fyodor Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov as one of the most influential novels of the nineteenth century. It follows the lives and interactions of several French characters over a twenty year period in the early nineteenth century during the Napoleonic wars and subsequent decades. Principally focusing on the struggles of the protagonist\u2014ex-convict Jean Valjean\u2014to redeem himself through good works, the novel examines the impact of Valjean's actions as social commentary. It examines the nature of good, evil, and the law, in a sweeping story that expounds upon the history of France, architecture of Paris, politics, moral philosophy, law, justice, religion, and the types and nature of romantic and familial love.\n\nPlot\n\nLes Mis\u00e9rables contains a multitude of plots, but the thread that binds them together is the story of the ex-convict Jean Valjean, who becomes a force for good in the world, but cannot escape his past. The novel is divided into five parts, each part divided into books, and each book divided into chapters. The novel's more than twelve hundred pages in unabridged editions contains not only the story of Jean Valjean but many pages of Hugo's thoughts on religion, politics, and society, including his three lengthy digressions, including a discussion on enclosed religious orders, another on argot, and most famously, his epic retelling of the Battle of Waterloo.\n\nAfter nineteen years of imprisonment for stealing bread for his starving family, the peasant Jean Valjean is released on parole. However, he is required to carry a yellow ticket, which marks him as a convict. Rejected by innkeepers who do not want to take in a convict, Valjean sleeps on the street. However, the benevolent Bishop Myriel takes him in and gives him shelter. In the night, he steals the bishop\u2019s silverware and runs. He is caught, but the bishop rescues him by claiming that the silver was a gift. The bishop then tells him that in exchange, he must become an honest man.\n\nSix years later, Valjean has become a wealthy factory owner and is elected mayor of his adopted town, having broken his parole and assumed the false name of P\u00e8re Madeleine to avoid capture by Inspector Javert, who has been pursuing him. Fate, however, takes an unfortunate turn when another man is arrested, accused of being Valjean, and put on trial, forcing the real ex-convict to reveal his true identity. At the same time, his life takes another turn when he meets the dying Fantine, who had been fired from the factory and has resorted to prostitution. She has a young daughter, Cosette, who lives with an innkeeper and his wife. As Fantine dies, Valjean, seeing in Fantine similarities to his former life of hardship, promises her that he will take care of Cosette. He pays off the innkeeper, Th\u00e9nardier, to obtain Cosette. Valjean and Cosette flee for Paris.\n\nTen years later, angry students, led by Enjolras, are preparing a revolution on the eve of the Paris uprising on June 5 and 6, 1832, following the death of General Lamarque, the only French leader who had sympathy towards the working class. One of the students, Marius Pontmercy, falls in love with Cosette, who has grown to be very beautiful. The Th\u00e9nardiers, who have also moved to Paris, lead a gang of thieves to raid Valjean\u2019s house while Marius is visiting. However, Th\u00e9nardier\u2019s daughter, \u00c9ponine, who is also in love with Marius, convinces the thieves to leave.\n\nThe following day, the students initiate their revolt and erect barricades in the narrow streets of Paris. Valjean, learning that Cosette's love is fighting, goes to join them. \u00c9ponine also joins. During the battle, Valjean saves Javert from being killed by the students and lets him go. Javert, a man who believes in absolute obedience of the law, is caught between his belief in the law and the mercy Valjean has shown him. Unable to cope with this dilemma, Javert kills himself. Valjean saves the injured Marius, but everyone else, including Enjolras and \u00c9ponine, is killed. Escaping through the sewers, he returns Marius to Cosette. Marius and Cosette are soon married. Finally, Valjean reveals to them his past, and then dies.\n\nThemes\n\nGrace\n\nAmong its many other themes, a discussion and comparison of grace and legalism is central to Les Mis\u00e9rables. This is seen most starkly in the juxtaposition of the protagonist, Valjean, and the apparent antagonist, Javert.\n\nAfter serving 19 years, all Jean Valjean knows about is the judgment of the law. He committed a crime for which he suffered the punishment, although he feels that this is somehow unjust. Rejected because of his status as an ex-convict, Valjean first encounters grace when the bishop not only lies to protect him for stealing the two silver candlesticks from his table, but famously also makes a gift of the candlesticks to Valjean. This treatment that does not correspond to what Valjean \"deserves\" represents a powerful intrusion of grace into his life.\n\nThroughout the course of the novel, Valjean is haunted by his past, most notably in the person of the relentless Javert. It is fitting then that the fruition of that grace comes in the final encounter between Valjean and Javert. After Javert is captured going undercover with the revolutionaries, Jean Valjean volunteers to execute him. However, instead of taking vengeance as Javert expects, he sets the policeman free. The bishop's act of grace is multiplied in the life of Jean Valjean, even extending to his arch-nemesis. Javert is unable to reconcile his black-and-white view with the apparent high morals of this ex-criminal and with the grace extended to him, and commits suicide.\n\nGrace plays a positive moral force in Jean's life. Whereas prison has hardened him to the point of stealing from a poor and charitable bishop, grace sets him free to be charitable to others.\n\nPolitical life and exile\n\nVictor Hugo Among the Rocks on Jersey (1853-55); Photograph taken by son Charles Hugo (1853-55);\n\nAfter three unsuccessful attempts, Hugo was finally elected to the Acad\u00e9mie Francaise in 1841, solidifying his position in the world of French arts and letters. Thereafter he became increasingly involved in French politics as a supporter of the Republican form of government. He was elevated to the peerage by King Louis-Philippe in 1841, entering the Higher Chamber as a Pair de France, where he spoke against the death penalty and social injustice, and in favor of freedom of the press and of self-government for Poland. He was later elected to the Legislative Assembly and the Constitutional Assembly, following the 1848 Revolution and the formation of the Second Republic.\n\nWhen Louis Napoleon (Napoleon III) seized complete power in 1851, establishing an anti-parliamentary constitution, Hugo openly declared him a traitor of France. Fearing for his life, he fled to Brussels, then Jersey, and finally settled with his family on the channel island of Guernsey, where he would live in exile until 1870.\n\nWhile in exile, Hugo published his famous political pamphlets against Napoleon III, Napol\u00e9on le Petit and Histoire d'un crime. The pamphlets were banned in France, but nonetheless had a strong impact there. He also composed some of his best work during his period in Guernsey, including Les Miserables, and three widely praised collections of poetry Les Ch\u00e2timents (1853), Les Contemplations (1856), and La L\u00e9gende des si\u00e8cles (1859).\n\nAlthough Napoleon III granted an amnesty to all political exiles in 1859, Hugo declined, as it meant he would have to curtail his criticisms of the government. It was only after the unpopular Napoleon III fell from power and the Third Republic was established that Hugo finally returned to his homeland in 1870, where he was promptly elected to the National Assembly and the Senate.\n\nReligious views\n\nHugo during his \"Spiritualist\" period. (1853-55) (1853-55)\n\nAlthough raised by his mother as a strict Roman Catholic, Hugo later become extremely anti-clerical and fiercely rejected any connection to the church. On the deaths of his sons Charles and Fran\u00e7ois-Victor, he insisted that they be buried without cross or priest, and in his will made the same stipulation about his own death and funeral.\n\nDue in large part to the church's indifference to the plight of the working class under the monarchy, which crushed their opposition, Hugo evolved from non-practicing Catholic to a Rationalist Deist. When a census-taker asked him in 1872 if he was a Catholic, Hugo replied, \"No. A Freethinker.\" He became very interested in spiritualism while in exile, participating in s\u00e9ances.\n\nHugo's rationalism can be found in poems such as Torquemada (1869), about religious fanaticism, The Pope (1878), violently anti-clerical, Religions and Religion (1880), denying the usefulness of churches and, published posthumously, The End of Satan and God (1886) and (1891) respectively, in which he represents Christianity as a griffin and rationalism as an angel. He predicted that Christianity would eventually disappear, but people would still believe in \"God, Soul, and Responsibility.\"\n\nDeclining years and death\n\nWhen Hugo returned to Paris in 1870, the country hailed him as a national hero. He went on to weather, within a brief period, the Siege of Paris, a mild stroke, his daughter Ad\u00e8le\u2019s commitment to an insane asylum, and the death of his two sons. His other daughter, L\u00e9opoldine, had drowned in a boating accident in 1833, while his wife Adele passed away in 1868.\n\nTwo years before his own death, Juliette Drouet, his lifelong mistress died in 1883. Victor Hugo's death on May 22, 1885, at the age of 83, generated intense national mourning. He was not only revered as a towering figure in French literature, but also internationally acknowledged as a statesman who helped to preserve and shape the Third Republic and democracy in France. More than two million people joined his funeral procession in Paris from the Arc de Triomphe to the Panth\u00e9on, where he was buried.\n\nDrawings\n\nHugo was almost as prolific an artist as he was a writer, producing about 4,000 drawings in his lifetime. Originally pursued as a casual hobby, drawing became more important to Hugo shortly before his exile, when he made the decision to stop writing in order to devote himself to politics. Drawing became his exclusive creative outlet during the period 1848-1851.\n\nHugo worked only on paper, and on a small scale; usually in dark brown or black pen-and-ink wash, sometimes with touches of white, and rarely with color. The surviving drawings are surprisingly accomplished and modern in their style and execution, foreshadowing the experimental techniques of surrealism and abstract expressionism.\n\nHe would not hesitate to use his children's stencils, ink blots, puddles and stains, lace impressions, \"pliage\" or foldings (Rorschach blots), \"grattage\" or rubbing, often using the charcoal from match sticks or his fingers instead of pen or brush. Sometimes he would even toss in coffee or soot to get the effects he wanted. It is reported that Hugo often drew with his left hand or without looking at the page, or during spiritualist s\u00e9ances, in order to access his unconscious mind, a concept only later popularized by Sigmund Freud.\n\n\"Town With Tumbledown Bridge\" (1847) (1847)\n\nHugo kept his artwork out of the public eye, fearing it would overshadow his literary work. However, he enjoyed sharing his drawings with his family and friends, often in the form of ornately handmade calling cards, many of which were given as gifts to visitors while he was in political exile. Some of his work was shown to and appreciated by contemporary artists such as Vincent van Gogh and Eugene Delacroix. The latter expressed the opinion that if Hugo had decided to become a painter instead of a writer, he would have outshone the other artists of their century.\n\nReproductions of Hugo\u2019s striking and often brooding drawings can be viewed on the Internet at ArtNet and on the website of artist Misha Bittleston.\n\nReferences ISBN links support NWE through referral fees\n\nOnline references\n\nFurther reading\n\nBarbou, Alfred (1882).

He was part of the Romantic Movement, best known for his novel, Les Mis\u00e9rables (1862), set during the Paris Uprising or June Rebellion of 1832, an anti-monarchist insurrection led by the Republicans to reverse the 1830 \"July Monarchy\" of Louis-Philippe. Though the July Monarchy had over ten time as many troops as the Republicans, both sides lost comparable casualties before the rebellion was thwarted. It was a particularly terrible time of turmoil and suffering in France, with widespread food shortages, poverty, and a cholera epidemic that killed over 100,000.\n\nHugo was writing a play in the Tuileries Gardens when he heard the gunshots that started the Rebellion. He was surrounded by barricades with bullets flying, inspiration for what became his legacy. Thirty years later, he published the epic novel, Les Mis\u00e9rables, that would forever chronicle these significant events in France's history."}, {"url": "https://www.poetry.com/poet/Victor+Hugo", "page_content": "Victor Hugo 1802 (Besan\u00e7on) \u2013 1885 (Paris) 1802 (Besan\u00e7on) \u2013 1885 (Paris)\n\nVictor Hugo\n\n1802 (Besan\u00e7on) \u2013 1885 (Paris)\n\nVictor Marie Hugo (26 February 1802 \u2013 22 May 1885) was a French poet, novelist, and dramatist of the Romantic movement. During a literary career that spanned more than sixty years, he wrote abundantly in an exceptional variety of genres: lyrics, satires, epics, philosophical poems, epigrams, novels, history, critical essays, political speeches, funeral orations, diaries, letters public and private, and dramas in verse and prose. Hugo is considered to be one of the greatest and best-known French writers. Outside France, his most famous works are the novels Les Mis\u00e9rables, 1862, and The Hunchback of Notre-Dame (French: Notre-Dame de Paris), 1831. In France, Hugo is renowned for his poetry collections, such as Les Contemplations (The Contemplations) and La L\u00e9gende des si\u00e8cles (The Legend of the Ages). Hugo was at the forefront of the Romantic literary movement with his play Cromwell and drama Hernani. Many of his works have inspired music, both during his lifetime and after his death, including the musicals Les Mis\u00e9rables and Notre-Dame de Paris. He produced more than 4,000 drawings in his lifetime, and campaigned for social causes such as the abolition of capital punishment. Though a committed royalist when he was young, Hugo's views changed as the decades passed, and he became a passionate supporter of republicanism; his work touched upon most of the political and social issues and the artistic trends of his time. His opposition to absolutism and his colossal literary achievement established him as a national hero. He was honoured by interment in the Panth\u00e9on.\n\nComplete biography of Victor Hugo \u00bb"}, {"url": "https://www.discoverfrance.net/France/Theatre/Hugo/hugo.shtml", "page_content": ".

Adversity makes men, and prosperity makes monsters. -- Victor Hugo (1802-1885)\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS Victor Hugo:\n\nA Biography SAVE 20% Like Proust, his fellow countryman, Victor Hugo is a writer whose works are discussed more often than they are actually read. Perhaps we had Les Mis\u00e9rables force-fed to us in high school or saw one of the many film versions of his novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame. But of his many other works of prose, poetry, and drama, most modern readers are ignorant -- as they are of the details of Hugo's life. In Victor Hugo, Graham Robb brings a fresh eye to an old subject with laudable results. During his lifetime, Hugo himself was the author of most of the legend that has grown up around him, from his pastoral conception on a mountainside to his heroic republican opposition to Napoleon. Robb turns these myths inside out as he searches for the underlying compulsions that led Hugo to obsessively recreate his own history. Robb thoroughly and compassionately presents the tangled, sometimes sordid, often ridiculous events of Hugo's life, at the same time commenting knowledgeably on his work. Victor Hugo is a terrific biography of a fascinating man, a great motivator for readers to start agitating for more translations of Hugo's work. by Graham Robb Paperback - 720 pages\n\nPublished May 1999 by\n\nW.W.

DiscoverFrance.net\n\nT he novelist, poet, and dramatist Victor Marie Hugo {hue'-goh or ue-goh'}, b. Besan\u00e7on, France, Feb. 26, 1802, d. May 22, 1885, was the preeminent French man of letters of the 19th century and the leading exponent and champion of romanticism. A conservative in youth, Hugo later became deeply involved in republican politics, and his work touched upon many of the major currents of artistic and political thought of his time. Although best known in the English-speaking world for his two major novels, Notre-Dame de Paris (1831; trans. as The Hunchback of Notre Dame, 1833) and Les Mis\u00e9rables (1862; Eng. trans., 1862), Hugo was also the outstanding French lyric poet of the 19th century.\n\nU ntil age 10, Hugo traveled with his father, a general under Napoleon. He then settled (1812) in Paris with his mother, whose strong royalist sympathies young Hugo shared. He had early success as a poet and novelist and in 1822 married his childhood sweetheart, Adele Foucher. The home of the young couple became a meeting place of romantic writers -- among them Alfred de Vigny and the critic Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve -- whose search for freedom in art is exemplified in Hugo's epic play Cromwell (1827; Eng. trans., 1896). The play's preface was the most widely read and influential manifesto of romantic literary theory. In it, Hugo spoke of freeing art from the formal constraints of classicism so that it might reflect the full extent of human nature. Hugo's romantic theory is exemplified by Hernani (1830; Eng. trans., 1830), whose first performance on the stage of the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise, scene of many productions of plays by the classical dramatist Jean Racine, was a triumph for romantic writers. Many of Hugo's novels, like his dramas, use historical settings. The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a powerfully melodramatic story of medieval Paris that deals with a deformed bell ringer's devotion to a wild gypsy girl. Les Mis\u00e9rables centers on the life of Jean Valjean, a victim of social injustice, but includes a multitude of scenes and incidents that offer a panoramic view of post-Napoleonic France and the early years of the 19th century.\n\nT he publication of Hugo's third collection of poems, Odes and Ballads (1826), marked the beginning of a period of intense creativity. During the next 17 years Hugo published essays, three novels, five volumes of poems, and the major part of his dramatic works. In 1843, however, the failure of his verse drama Les Burgraves (Eng. trans., 1896), followed by the death of his beloved daughter Leopoldine, interrupted his prodigious creativity. In 1845 he accepted a political post in the constitutional government of King Louis Philippe and in 1848 became a representative of the people after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte became president of the Second Republic. When Napoleon seized complete power in 1851, Hugo's republican beliefs drove him into exile, first to Brussels and then to the Channel Islands, where he continued to write savage denunciations of the French government.\n\nWhen a woman is talking to you, listen to what she says with her eyes. There is one thing stronger than all the armies in the world, and that is an idea whose time has come. -- Victor Hugo\n\nI n exile, accompanied by his devoted mistress Juliette Drouet, Hugo reached maturity as a writer, producing the first volumes of his visionary epic poem Legend of the Centuries (1859-83; Eng. trans., 1894), Les Miserables, and Contemplations (1856; Eng. trans., 1887), often considered his finest collection of poems. He returned to Paris after the fall of the Second Empire (1870) to find himself a national hero. He was elected a member of the National Assembly, then a senator of the Third Republic.\n\nT he last two decades of his life were saddened by the deaths of his sons, wife, and mistress, but he continued to write poetry and remained active in politics until 1878, when his health began to fail. His death was an occasion of national mourning, and he received a state funeral.\n\nH ugo's works have survived controversy and critical indifference and remain, by the challenge of their thematic range and the richness of their style, among the most significant of the 19th century.\n\nCharles Affron, Professor of French, New York University, New York City.\n\nSource: 1997 Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia v.9.0.1\n\nBibliography: Charles Affron, A Stage for Poets: Studies in the Theatre of Hugo and Musset (1971); Victor Brombert, Victor Hugo and the Visionary Novel (1984; repr. 1986); Samuel Edwards, Victor Hugo: A Tumultuous Life (1971); Elliott M.

Outside of his native France, he is best known for Notre-Dame de Paris, written in 1831 and known in England as The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and Les Mis\u00e9rables, written in 1862. Upon publication, the former of these was quickly translated into other European languages, and one of the major effects of the novel was to force by shame the City of Paris into restoring its much-neglected Notre Dame Cathedral, which was now attracting thousands of tourists who had read the novel. The book also inspired a renewed love for pre-Renaissance buildings, which began to be actively restored and preserved.\n\nWhen Hugo died from pneumonia at the age of 83 on the 22nd of May, 1885, a period of national mourning was begun. Hugo was not just greatly known as a towering figure in literature, but as a statesman who shaped the Third Republic and democracy in France. Over two million people lined his funeral procession in Paris, from the Arc de Triomphe to the Panth\u00e9on, where he was interred. He shares his crypt with Alexandre Dumas and \u00c9mile Zola and today most large French towns and cities have a street named after him.\n\nVictor Hugo\u2019s parting shot came in the form of five sentences, which his will requested be officially published. They read thus: I leave 50,000 francs to the poor. I want to be buried in their hearse. I refuse orations of all churches. I beg a prayer to all souls. I believe in God."}]}
