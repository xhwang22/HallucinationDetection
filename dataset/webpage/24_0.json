In 1221 he succeeded his father as Margrave of Meissen and Lusatia, at first under guardianship of his maternal uncle, Landgrave Louis IV of Thuringia, and after his death in 1227, under that of Duke Albert I of Saxony. In 1230 he was legally proclaimed an adult.\n\nHenry had his first combat experience in sometime around 1234, while on crusade in Prussia, fighting against the Pomesanians. His pilgrimage and company is well-documented by Peter of Dusburg, and it resulted in the construction of Balga castle, an important administrative centre for the Teutonic http://Knights.In 1245 after many years of conflict with the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg, he was forced to cede the fortresses of K\u00f6penick, Teltow and Mittenwalde north of Lower Lusatia. In 1249 however, the Silesian duke Boles\u0142aw II the Bald granted him the eastern area around Schiedlo Castle at the Oder river, where Henry founded the town of F\u00fcrstenberg.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the struggle between the Hohenstaufen Emperor Frederick II and Pope Gregory IX, Henry took the side of the Emperor. In consideration, Frederick II in 1242 promised him the heritage of Henry Raspe as Landgrave of Thuringia and Count palatine of Saxony. In 1243 the Emperor also betrothed his daughter Margaret of Sicily to Henry's son Albert II.\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry remained a loyal supporter of the Hohenstaufens and not before the departure of Frederick's son Conrad IV from Germany did he recognise the antiking William of Holland. After the death of Henry Raspe in 1247, he enforced his rights in Thuringia by military means in the War of the Thuringian Succession against the claims raised by Sophie of Thuringia, daughter of late Landgrave Louis IV, and her husband Duke Henry II of Brabant, as well as by Prince Siegfried I of Anhalt-Zerbst. After a long drawn-out war he detached the Landgraviate of Hesse in the west and gave it to Sophie's younger son Henry, but kept Thuringia, which he granted to his son Albert II together with the Palatinate of Saxony. The Thuringian acquisition significantly increased the Wettin territorial possessions, which now reached from the Silesian border at the B\u00f3br river in the east up to the Werra in the west, and from the border with Bohemia along the Erzgebirge in the south to the Harz range in the north.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 1273 Henry was an important support to the newly elected Rex Romanorum Rudolph of Habsburg in his struggle against rivaling King Ottokar II of Bohemia. Against Bohemia he won, among other places, Sayda and Purschenstein Castle near Neuhausen,\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was known throughout the whole empire as a glittering prince, famous as a patron of the arts and a model knight, and as a significant minnesinger (not to be confused with Heinrich Frauenlob), poet and composer. Henry was patron of many tournaments and singing competitions, in which he also took part himself, and commissioned the famous Christherre-Chronik. He set to music hymns to be sung in the churches, by express permission of the pope.\n\nFamily\n\nIn 1234 Henry married Constance of Babenberg, the daughter of Duke Leopold VI of Austria. Together they had two sons:\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbert II, Margrave of Meissen (1240\u20131314)\n\nTheodoric of Landsberg (1242\u20131285)\n\nAs early as 1265 he attached the Imperial Pleissnerland around Altenburg, the dowry of his daughter-in-law Margaret, to the Landgraviate of Thuringia and gave both to his elder son Albert II, otherwise Albert the Degenerate. For his younger son Theodoric, Henry had created \u2013 though without imperial consent \u2013 the smaller Margraviate of Landsberg in the western part of the Lusatian lands around Leipzig. Henry kept for himself only the Margraviate of Meissen, the remaining Lower Lusatian lands, and a formal power of oversight. Only domestic disorders, caused by the unworthiness of his son Albert, clouded the later years of his reign and indeed, long after his death in 1288, led to the loss of Lusatia and Thuringia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the death of Constance in 1243 Henry took as his second wife Agnes (d. 1268), a daughter of King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, and in his third marriage the daughter of a ministerialis, or serving knight, Elisabeth von Maltitz, who bore him Friedrich Clem (whose only daughter Elisabeth married Otto II, Prince of Anhalt-Aschersleben) and Hermann the Long.\n\n\u4ea8\u5229\u4e09\u4e16\n\n\u8fc8\u68ee\u85e9\u4faf\n\n1221-1288\u5e74\n\n\u524d\u4efb \u897f\u5965\u591a\u91cc\u514b\u4e00\u4e16\n\n\u7ee7\u4efb\u8005

He was a member of the House of Wettin.\n\nHe was the eldest son of Henry the Illustrious, Margrave of Meissen by his first wife, Constantia of Austria.\n\nLife\n\nIn 1265 Margrave Henry III granted the Landgraviate of Thuringia and the Palatinate to Albrecht and the Margraviate of Landsberg in the Osterland to his younger brother Dietrich. Henry III kept for himself the Margraviates of Meissen and Lusatia as a formal power over his sons.\n\nIn June 1255 Albert married Margaret of Sicily, the daughter of Emperor Frederick II, who was also King of Sicily, and Isabella of England. Margaret, also known as Margaret of Schwaben was a sister of Henry Otto, also known as Carlotto. As a dowry the Pleissnerland was pledged to the House of Wettin. Albert and Margaret had five children:\n\nFile:Dresden F\u00fcrstenzug 083.JPG Albert II, Margrave of Meissen (1288\u20131307) and Frederick I, Margrave of Meissen (1307\u20131324); F\u00fcrstenzug, Dresden, Germany\n\nHenry, Lord of Pleissnerland (b. 21 March 1256 - d. 25 January/23 July? 1282), inherited the Pleissnerland in 1274. Frederick (b. 1257 - d. Wartburg, 16 November 1323), Margrave of Meissen. Dietrich, called Diezmann (b. 1260 - murdered Leipzig, 10 December 1307), Margrave of Lusatia. Margaret (b. 1262 - d. young, aft. 17 April 1273). Agnes (b. 1264 - d. September 1332), married before 21 July 1282 to Henry I, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen.\n\nAfter what was at first a happy rule and marriage, Albert turned away from Margaret and began a passionate love affair with Kunigunde of Eisenberg. She bore him two children: a daughter, Elisabeth in 1269,[1] and a son, Albert (\"Apitz\") in 1270.\n\nWhen she discovered the adultery and the illegitimate births, Margaret left Wartburg on 24 June 1270 and went to Frankfurt am Main where she died on 8 August of the same year. The two younger sons, Frederick and Diezmann were looked after by their uncle, Theodoric of Landsberg. Henry, the oldest, disappeared in Silesia in 1282.\n\nAlbert married Kunigunde in 1274 and legitimised their children. When Albert intended to leave the Landgraviate of Thuringia to Apitz and compensate his sons from his first marriage with only the Osterland (which included the inheritance from their mother) and the County Palatine of Saxony, they began a war against their father. Frederick was captured by his father and was locked up in Wartburg castle; however, he escaped one year later and continued the war against his father together with Diezmann. During this time, in 1284, their uncle Theodoric of Landsberg died, and four years later, in 1288, Henry the Illustrious, Albert's father, also died. These deaths heightened the family disputes.\n\nAt the death of his father, Albert became Margrave of Meissen, while his nephew Frederick Tuta - son of Theodoric of Landsberg - inherited the Margraviate of Lusatia, which was sold off by Albert's son Diezmann in 1303. Shortly after, Frederick captured his father Albert in battle. By the Treaty of Rochlitz (1 January 1289), Albert obtained his freedom after the renunciation of large parts of his lands. He retained Meissen for himself, but later sold it to Frederick Tuta. When, after his death (1291) his cousins Frederick and Diezmann arbitrarily took possession of his lands, Albert \u2014suffering financial difficulties\u2014 was compelled to sell Thuringia in 1293 to the German King Adolf of Nassau; in the contract, it was stipulated that the king could take possession of the lands after Albert's death. In the sale, Albert included Meissen and Osterland as his fiefs, despite the fact they were in the hands of his sons. Thanks to this, Adolf's successor Albert I of Habsburg was able to take possession of these lands, claiming that the contract of sale was legitimate and lawful.\n\nKunigunde of Eisenberg died on 31 October 1286. Four years later, on 1 October 1290, Albert married thirdly Elisabeth of Orlam\u00fcnde, heiress of Nordhalben and widow of Hartmann XI of Lobdeburg-Arnshaugk. The same year, Apitz, Albert's son by Kunigunde, was formally legitimized by the Emperor and created Herr of Tenneberg.\n\nOn 11 April 1291 Apitz's younger full-sister, Elisabeth, married Henry III of Frankenstein; the marriage was short-lived and childless.[2] Elisabeth died on 28 September 1293.[3] Three years later (9 October 1296), Apitz married a sister of his brother-in-law Henry III, apparently also called Elisabeth.[4] This marriage, like his sister's, was childless.\n\nFour years later (24 August 1300) Albert's eldest surviving son, Frederick, married Elisabeth of Lobdeburg-Arnshaugk, daughter of his stepmother; this make the final reconciliation between father and son. Five years later (27 June 1305) Apitz of Tenneberg died, aged thirty-five. The death of his favorite son was a terrible blow to Albert. He never recovered from the loss.\n\nTwo years later, in 1307, Albert finally resigned the Landgraviate of Thuringia and the County Palatine of Saxony to his son Frederick in exchange for an annuity. He died seven years later in Erfurt, aged seventy-four.\n\nAncestors\n\nSee also"}], "Albert I, Margrave of Meissen died on July 13, 1307.": [{"url": "https://theodora.com/encyclopedia/a/albert_the_degenerate.html", "page_content": "ALBERT, surnamed THE Degenerate (c. 1240-1314), land grave of Thuringia, was the eldest son of Henry III., the Illustrious, margrave of Meissen.

In 1186 in \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem he married the P\u0159emyslid princess Sophia, a daughter of Duke Frederick of Bohemia.\n\nF\u00fcrstenzug, Dresden Otto the Rich and his son and Albert;, Dresden\n\nHis father did not intend to let Albert succeed him in Meissen, openly preferring his younger brother Theodoric. Albert did not accept this and started a war against his father and brother. In 1188, he even took his father prisoner. Under the orders of the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa, he had to set him free but in 1190 he was able to obtain the margravial title upon Otto's death.\n\nAlbert accompanied Barbarossa's son Henry VI on his campaign to Sicily; nevertheless, he quickly abandoned the Imperial forces and returned to Meissen when his brother tried to regain the margraviate.[1][2] Theodoric, with the support of his father-in-law Landgrave Hermann of Thuringia, took up arms and defeated Albert's forces in a battle near R\u00f6blingen. The Margrave, in disguise as a monk, narrowly escaped to Leipzig and tried in vain to gain the support of furious Emperor Henry.\n\nThe fratricidal war ended when Albert suddenly died in June 1195, presumably poisoned, with no children to succeed him. He was buried in the Cistercian monastery of Altzella, established by his father in 1162. Meissen, with its rich mines, was seized by Emperor Henry VI as a princeless Imperial Estate. Not until 1198, Theodoric finally came into possession of his inheritance, following Henry's death in 1197.[2]\n\nAncestors\n\nSee also\n\nNotes and references"}, {"url": "https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/437421882", "page_content": "Henry III, Margrave of Meissen\n\nMargrave of Meissen\n\nReign 1221\u20131288\n\nPredecessor Theodoric I\n\nSuccessor Albert II\n\nRegent Louis IV of Thuringia (until 1217)\n\nAlbert I of Saxony (until 1230)\n\nMargrave of Lusatia\n\nReign 1221\u20131288\n\nPredecessor Theodoric II\n\nRegent Louis IV of Thuringia (until 1217)\n\nAlbert I of Saxony (until 1230)\n\nLandgrave of Thuringia,\n\nCount Palatine of Saxony\n\nReign 1242\u20131265\n\nPredecessor Henry Raspe\n\nSuccessor Albert II\n\nBorn 1215\n\nMeissen, Duchy of Saxony, Holy Roman Empire\n\nDied 15 February 1288 (aged 72\u201373)\n\nDresden, Duchy of Saxony, Holy Roman Empire\n\nSpouse Constance of Babenberg\n\nAgnes of Bohemia\n\nElisabeth von Maltitz\n\nIssue Albert II, Margrave of Meissen\n\nTheodoric of Landsberg\n\nHouse House of Wettin\n\nFather Theodoric I, Margrave of Meissen\n\nMother Jutta of Thuringia\n\nHenry III, called Henry the Illustrious (Heinrich der Erlauchte) (c. 1215 \u2013 15 February 1288) from the House of Wettin was Margrave of Meissen and last Margrave of Lusatia (as Henry IV) from 1221 until his death; from 1242 also Landgrave of Thuringia.\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\nBorn probably at the Albrechtsburg residence in Meissen, Henry was the youngest son of Margrave Theodoric I, Margrave of Meissen and his wife Jutta, daughter of Landgrave Hermann I of Thuringia. In 1221 he succeeded his father as Margrave of Meissen and Lusatia, at first under guardianship of his maternal uncle, Landgrave Louis IV of Thuringia, and after his death in 1227, under that of Duke Albert I of Saxony. In 1230 he was legally proclaimed an adult.\n\nHenry had his first combat experience in sometime around 1234, while on crusade in Prussia, fighting against the Pomesanians. His pilgrimage and company is well-documented by Peter of Dusburg, and it resulted in the construction of Balga castle, an important administrative centre for the Teutonic http://Knights.In 1245 after many years of conflict with the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg, he was forced to cede the fortresses of K\u00f6penick, Teltow and Mittenwalde north of Lower Lusatia. In 1249 however, the Silesian duke Boles\u0142aw II the Bald granted him the eastern area around Schiedlo Castle at the Oder river, where Henry founded the town of F\u00fcrstenberg.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the struggle between the Hohenstaufen Emperor Frederick II and Pope Gregory IX, Henry took the side of the Emperor. In consideration, Frederick II in 1242 promised him the heritage of Henry Raspe as Landgrave of Thuringia and Count palatine of Saxony. In 1243 the Emperor also betrothed his daughter Margaret of Sicily to Henry's son Albert II.\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry remained a loyal supporter of the Hohenstaufens and not before the departure of Frederick's son Conrad IV from Germany did he recognise the antiking William of Holland. After the death of Henry Raspe in 1247, he enforced his rights in Thuringia by military means in the War of the Thuringian Succession against the claims raised by Sophie of Thuringia, daughter of late Landgrave Louis IV, and her husband Duke Henry II of Brabant, as well as by Prince Siegfried I of Anhalt-Zerbst. After a long drawn-out war he detached the Landgraviate of Hesse in the west and gave it to Sophie's younger son Henry, but kept Thuringia, which he granted to his son Albert II together with the Palatinate of Saxony. The Thuringian acquisition significantly increased the Wettin territorial possessions, which now reached from the Silesian border at the B\u00f3br river in the east up to the Werra in the west, and from the border with Bohemia along the Erzgebirge in the south to the Harz range in the north.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 1273 Henry was an important support to the newly elected Rex Romanorum Rudolph of Habsburg in his struggle against rivaling King Ottokar II of Bohemia. Against Bohemia he won, among other places, Sayda and Purschenstein Castle near Neuhausen,\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was known throughout the whole empire as a glittering prince, famous as a patron of the arts and a model knight, and as a significant minnesinger (not to be confused with Heinrich Frauenlob), poet and composer. Henry was patron of many tournaments and singing competitions, in which he also took part himself, and commissioned the famous Christherre-Chronik. He set to music hymns to be sung in the churches, by express permission of the pope.\n\nFamily\n\nIn 1234 Henry married Constance of Babenberg, the daughter of Duke Leopold VI of Austria. Together they had two sons:\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbert II, Margrave of Meissen (1240\u20131314)\n\nTheodoric of Landsberg (1242\u20131285)\n\nAs early as 1265 he attached the Imperial Pleissnerland around Altenburg, the dowry of his daughter-in-law Margaret, to the Landgraviate of Thuringia and gave both to his elder son Albert II, otherwise Albert the Degenerate. For his younger son Theodoric, Henry had created \u2013 though without imperial consent \u2013 the smaller Margraviate of Landsberg in the western part of the Lusatian lands around Leipzig. Henry kept for himself only the Margraviate of Meissen, the remaining Lower Lusatian lands, and a formal power of oversight. Only domestic disorders, caused by the unworthiness of his son Albert, clouded the later years of his reign and indeed, long after his death in 1288, led to the loss of Lusatia and Thuringia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the death of Constance in 1243 Henry took as his second wife Agnes (d. 1268), a daughter of King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, and in his third marriage the daughter of a ministerialis, or serving knight, Elisabeth von Maltitz, who bore him Friedrich Clem (whose only daughter Elisabeth married Otto II, Prince of Anhalt-Aschersleben) and Hermann the

As French philosopher, and contributor of the Encyclopedie Denis Diderot, said \"Indeed, the purpose of an encyclopedia is to collect knowledge disseminated around the globe; to set forth its general system to the men with whom we live, and transmit it to those who will come after us, so that the work of preceding centuries will not become useless to the centuries to come; and so that our offspring, becoming better instructed, will at the same time become more virtuous and happy, and that we should not die without having rendered a service to the human race. \"\n\nAccessibility World Heritage Encyclopedia, (WorldHeritage.org) is a live collaboration differing from paper-based reference sources in important ways.

WorldHeritage.org is fully accessible on a tablet, smartphone, laptop, desktop computer, or any Internet-connected device with a Web browser.\n\nIs Print Obsolete?\n\n\"Thinking beyond the format\", Encyclopedias join a long list of paper we once thought we couldn't live without, like the Sears catalog, Yellow Pages and maps. Even the world famous Encyclopedia Britannica will no longer be printed after 244 years, the final edition costing almost $1400. Today, the modern encyclopedia is often in electronic form and much more affordable then the traditional paper versions. Unlike many online encyclopedias, World Heritage Encyclopedia is an aggregation of professionally written, crowd sourced, peer reviewed, and edited articles, making our information the most reliable and complete encyclopedia. On-line encyclopedias offer the additional advantage of being dynamic; new information can be presented almost immediately as it is happening in the world. With modern technology we have the extra advantage of information being portable as well."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/albert-ii-margrave-of-meissen/", "page_content": "Albert II, the Degenerate (de: Albrecht II der Entartete) (1240 \u2013 20 November 1314) was a Margrave of Meissen, Landgrave of Thuringia and Count Palatine of Saxony. He was a member of the House of Wettin.\n\nHe was the eldest son of Henry III, Margrave of Meissen by his first wife, Constantia of Austria.\n\nLife\n\nIn 1265 Margrave Henry III granted the Landgraviate of Thuringia and the Palatinate to Albert and the Margraviate of Landsberg in the Osterland to his younger brother Dietrich. Henry III kept for himself the Margraviates of Meissen and Lusatia as a formal power over his sons.\n\nIn June 1255 Albert married Margaret of Sicily, the daughter of Emperor Frederick II, who was also King of Sicily, and Isabella of England. Margaret, also known as Margaret of Schwaben was a sister of Henry Otto, also known as Carlotto. As a dowry the Pleissnerland was pledged to the House of Wettin. Albert and Margaret had five children:\n\nHenry, Lord of Pleissnerland (b. 21 March 1256 - d. 25 January/23 July? 1282), inherited the Pleissnerland in 1274; he married Hedwig, daughter of Henry III the White. Frederick (b. 1257 - d. Wartburg, 16 November 1323), Margrave of Meissen. Dietrich, called Diezmann (b. 1260 - murdered Leipzig, 10 December 1307), Margrave of Lusatia. Margaret (b. 1262 - d. young, aft. 17 April 1273). Agnes (b. 1264 - d. September 1332), married before 21 July 1282 to Henry I, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen.\n\nAfter what was at first a happy rule and marriage, Albert turned away from Margaret and began a passionate love affair with Kunigunde of Eisenberg. She bore him two children: a daughter, Elisabeth in 1269, and a son, Albert (\"Apitz\") in 1270.\n\nWhen she discovered the adultery and the illegitimate births, Margaret left Wartburg on 24 June 1270 and went to Frankfurt am Main where she died on 8 August of the same year. The two younger sons, Frederick and Diezmann were looked after by their uncle, Theodoric of Landsberg. Henry, the oldest, disappeared in Silesia in 1282.\n\nAlbert married Kunigunde in 1274 and legitimised their children. When Albert intended to leave the Landgraviate of Thuringia to Apitz and compensate his sons from his first marriage with only the Osterland (which included the inheritance from their mother) and the County Palatine of Saxony, they began a war against their father. Frederick was captured by his father and was locked up in Wartburg castle; however, he escaped one year later and continued the war against his father together with Diezmann. During this time, in 1284, their uncle Theodoric of Landsberg died, and four years later, in 1288, Henry the Illustrious, Albert's father, also died. These deaths heightened the family disputes.\n\nAt the death of his father, Albert became Margrave of Meissen, while his nephew Frederick Tuta - son of Theodoric of Landsberg - inherited the Margraviate of Lusatia, which was sold off by Albert's son Diezmann in 1303. Shortly after, Frederick captured his father Albert in battle. By the Treaty of Rochlitz (1 January 1289), Albert obtained his freedom after the renunciation of large parts of his lands. He retained Meissen for himself, but later sold it to Frederick Tuta. When, after his death (1291) his cousins Frederick and Diezmann arbitrarily took possession of his lands, Albert - suffering financial difficulties - was compelled to sell Thuringia in 1293 to the German King Adolf of Nassau; in the contract, it was stipulated that the king could take possession of the lands after Albert's death. In the sale, Albert included Meissen and Osterland as his fiefs, despite the fact they were in the hands of his sons. Thanks to this, Adolf's successor Albert I of Habsburg was able to take possession of these lands, claiming that the contract of sale was legitimate and lawful.\n\nKunigunde of Eisenberg died on 31 October 1286. Four years later, on 1 October 1290, Albert married thirdly Elisabeth of Orlam\u00fcnde, heiress of Nordhalben and widow of Hartmann XI of Lobdeburg-Arnshaugk. The same year, Apitz, Albert's son by Kunigunde, was formally legitimized by the Emperor and created Herr of Tenneberg. He wished to make Apitz his successor in Thuringia, but the plan was resisted by his two elder sons.\n\nOn 11 April 1291 Apitz's younger full-sister, Elisabeth, married Henry III of Frankenstein; the marriage was short-lived and childless. Elisabeth died on 28 September 1293. Three years later (9 October 1296), Apitz married a sister of his brother-in-law Henry III, apparently also called Elisabeth. This marriage, like his sister's, was childless.\n\nFour years later (24 August 1300) Albert's eldest surviving son, Frederick, married Elisabeth of Lobdeburg-Arnshaugk, daughter of his stepmother; this caused the final reconciliation between father and son. Five years later (27 June 1305) Apitz of Tenneberg died, aged thirty-five. The death of his favorite son was a terrible blow to Albert. He never recovered from the loss.\n\nTwo years later, in 1307, Albert finally resigned the Landgraviate of Thuringia and the County Palatine of Saxony to his son Frederick in exchange for an annuity. He died seven years later in Erfurt, aged seventy-four.\n\nAncestors"}, {"url": "https://everything.explained.today/Albert_I%2c_Margrave_of_Meissen/", "page_content": "Albert I, Margrave of Meissen explained\n\nAlbert I (1158 \u2013 24 June 1195), called the Proud (German: Albrecht der Stolze), a member of the House of Wettin, was the Margrave of Meissen from 1190 until his death.\n\nLife\n\nAlbert was the eldest son of Margrave Otto the Rich (1156\u20131190) with his consort Hedwig of Brandenburg, a daughter of the Ascanian margrave Albert the Bear.

Albert did not accept this and started a war against his father and brother. In 1188, he even took his father prisoner. Under the orders of the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa, he had to set him free but in 1190 he was able to obtain the margravial title upon Otto's death.\n\nAlbert accompanied Barbarossa's son Henry VI on his campaign to Sicily; nevertheless, he quickly abandoned the Imperial forces and returned to Meissen when his brother tried to regain the margraviate.[1] Theodoric, with the support of his father-in-law Landgrave Hermann of Thuringia, took up arms and defeated Albert's forces in a battle near R\u00f6blingen. The Margrave, in disguise as a monk, narrowly escaped to Leipzig and tried in vain to gain the support of furious Emperor Henry.\n\nThe fratricidal war ended when Albert suddenly died in June 1195, presumably poisoned, with no children to succeed him. He was buried in the Cistercian monastery of Altzella, established by his father in 1162. Meissen, with its rich mines, was seized by Emperor Henry VI as a princeless Imperial Estate.

In 1221 he succeeded his father as Margrave of Meissen and Lusatia, at first under guardianship of his maternal uncle, Landgrave Louis IV of Thuringia, and after his death in 1227, under that of Duke Albert I of Saxony. In 1230 he was legally proclaimed an adult.\n\nHenry had his first combat experience in sometime around 1234, while on crusade in Prussia, fighting against the Pomesanians. His pilgrimage and company is well-documented by Peter of Dusburg, and it resulted in the construction of Balga castle, an important administrative centre for the Teutonic http://Knights.In 1245 after many years of conflict with the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg, he was forced to cede the fortresses of K\u00f6penick, Teltow and Mittenwalde north of Lower Lusatia. In 1249 however, the Silesian duke Boles\u0142aw II the Bald granted him the eastern area around Schiedlo Castle at the Oder river, where Henry founded the town of F\u00fcrstenberg.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the struggle between the Hohenstaufen Emperor Frederick II and Pope Gregory IX, Henry took the side of the Emperor. In consideration, Frederick II in 1242 promised him the heritage of Henry Raspe as Landgrave of Thuringia and Count palatine of Saxony. In 1243 the Emperor also betrothed his daughter Margaret of Sicily to Henry's son Albert II.\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry remained a loyal supporter of the Hohenstaufens and not before the departure of Frederick's son Conrad IV from Germany did he recognise the antiking William of Holland. After the death of Henry Raspe in 1247, he enforced his rights in Thuringia by military means in the War of the Thuringian Succession against the claims raised by Sophie of Thuringia, daughter of late Landgrave Louis IV, and her husband Duke Henry II of Brabant, as well as by Prince Siegfried I of Anhalt-Zerbst. After a long drawn-out war he detached the Landgraviate of Hesse in the west and gave it to Sophie's younger son Henry, but kept Thuringia, which he granted to his son Albert II together with the Palatinate of Saxony. The Thuringian acquisition significantly increased the Wettin territorial possessions, which now reached from the Silesian border at the B\u00f3br river in the east up to the Werra in the west, and from the border with Bohemia along the Erzgebirge in the south to the Harz range in the north.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 1273 Henry was an important support to the newly elected Rex Romanorum Rudolph of Habsburg in his struggle against rivaling King Ottokar II of Bohemia. Against Bohemia he won, among other places, Sayda and Purschenstein Castle near Neuhausen,\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was known throughout the whole empire as a glittering prince, famous as a patron of the arts and a model knight, and as a significant minnesinger (not to be confused with Heinrich Frauenlob), poet and composer. Henry was patron of many tournaments and singing competitions, in which he also took part himself, and commissioned the famous Christherre-Chronik. He set to music hymns to be sung in the churches, by express permission of the pope.\n\nFamily\n\nIn 1234 Henry married Constance of Babenberg, the daughter of Duke Leopold VI of Austria. Together they had two sons:\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbert II, Margrave of Meissen (1240\u20131314)\n\nTheodoric of Landsberg (1242\u20131285)\n\nAs early as 1265 he attached the Imperial Pleissnerland around Altenburg, the dowry of his daughter-in-law Margaret, to the Landgraviate of Thuringia and gave both to his elder son Albert II, otherwise Albert the Degenerate. For his younger son Theodoric, Henry had created \u2013 though without imperial consent \u2013 the smaller Margraviate of Landsberg in the western part of the Lusatian lands around Leipzig. Henry kept for himself only the Margraviate of Meissen, the remaining Lower Lusatian lands, and a formal power of oversight. Only domestic disorders, caused by the unworthiness of his son Albert, clouded the later years of his reign and indeed, long after his death in 1288, led to the loss of Lusatia and Thuringia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the death of Constance in 1243 Henry took as his second wife Agnes (d. 1268), a daughter of King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, and in his third marriage the daughter of a ministerialis, or serving knight, Elisabeth von Maltitz, who bore him Friedrich Clem (whose only daughter Elisabeth married Otto II, Prince of Anhalt-Aschersleben) and Hermann the Long.\n\n\u4ea8\u5229\u4e09\u4e16\n\n\u8fc8\u68ee\u85e9\u4faf\n\n1221-1288\u5e74\n\n\u524d\u4efb \u897f\u5965\u591a\u91cc\u514b\u4e00\u4e16\n\n\u7ee7\u4efb\u8005

(German: Albrecht der Stolze), a member of the House of Wettin, was the Margrave of Meissen from 1190 until his death.\n\nLife\n\nAlbert was the eldest son of Margrave Otto the Rich (1156\u20131190) with his consort Hedwig of Brandenburg, a daughter of the Ascanian margrave Albert the Bear. In 1186 in \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem he married the P\u0159emyslid princess Sophia, a daughter of Duke Frederick of Bohemia.His father did not intend to let Albert succeed him in Meissen, openly preferring his younger brother Theodoric. Albert did not accept this and started a war against his father and brother. In 1188, he even took his father prisoner. Under the orders of the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa, he had to set him free but in 1190 he was able to obtain the margravial title upon Otto's death.\n\nAlbert accompanied Barbarossa's son Henry VI on his campaign to Sicily; nevertheless, he quickly abandoned the Imperial forces and returned to Meissen when his brother tried to regain the margraviate.[1] Theodoric, with the support of his father-in-law Landgrave Hermann of Thuringia, took up arms and defeated Albert's forces in a battle near R\u00f6blingen. The Margrave, in disguise as a monk, narrowly escaped to Leipzig and tried in vain to gain the support of furious Emperor Henry.\n\nThe fratricidal war ended when Albert suddenly died in June 1195, presumably poisoned, with no children to succeed him. He was buried in the Cistercian monastery of Altzella, established by his father in 1162. Meissen, with its rich mines, was seized by Emperor Henry VI as a princeless Imperial Estate. Not until 1198, Theodoric finally came into possession of his inheritance, following Henry's death in 1197.\n\nSee also\n\nNotes and References"}, {"url": "https://everything.explained.today/%5C/Albert%2C_Margrave_of_Meissen_(1934%E2%80%932012)/", "page_content": "Albert, Margrave of Meissen (1934\u20132012) explained\n\nPrince Albert Joseph Maria Franz-Xaver of Saxony, Duke of Saxony, Margrave of Meissen[2] (30 November 1934[3] \u2013 6 October 2012)[4] was the head of the Royal House of Saxony and a German historian. The fourth child and youngest son of Friedrich Christian, Margrave of Meissen and his wife Princess Elisabeth Helene of Thurn and Taxis, he was the younger brother of Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen, who was his predecessor as head of the Royal House of Saxony. Had he been King he would have been known as Albert II\n\nLife\n\nAlbert received his secondary education at the Federal Gymnasium in Bregenz, Austria. He passed his matura in 1954. His parents and their children then moved to Munich, with support from his mother's relatives from the Thurn und Taxis dynasty. In Munich, Albert studied at the Ludwig Maximilian University. He initially studied macroeconomics, and later switched to history and ethnography. On 13 February 1961, he received his PhD for a thesis on his great-great-grandfather, King John of Saxony, and his reform of Saxon commercial law.\n\nOn 30 January 1960 the German: Studiengruppe f\u00fcr S\u00e4chsische Geschichte und Kultur e.V. (\"Study group for Saxon history and culture\") was founded by Albert together with his parents, his elder brother Maria Emanuel, some other Saxon nobles, the Chapter of the Military Order of St. Henry, the chapter of the association of people from Dresden, and the association of Heimatvertriebene in the history department of the University of Munich. This study group became one of the largest historical societies in West Germany. After completing his studies, Albert worked as a historian and referent. He studied the history of the Duchy of Saxony and the Kingdom of Saxony, in particular the relationship of Saxony to Bavaria.\n\nAt times, he was vice president of the German: Bund der Mitteldeutschen (\"Association of Central Germans\"). In 1972, he joined the German: Mitteldeutschen Kulturrat e.V. (\"Central German Culture Council\"), where he represented the interests of the Free State of Saxony.\n\nIn the summer of 1982, he was allowed to visit Saxony for the first time since his youth. He visited again in 1983 and 1985. He was then not allowed to enter the German Democratic Republic again, for unknown reasons, until 1989/1990. On 22 January 1990, he participated in a Monday demonstration in Dresden and was unexpectedly asked to address the crowd. He told his audience about their task to rebuild Saxony and ended with the words \"Long live Saxony, Germany, Europe and the western-Christian culture.\"\n\nIn the subsequent elections for the Saxon parliament, he ran as a DSU candidate; he was not elected, nor did the newly elected government of Saxony employ him as an advisor. After the German reunification, he has tried to reclaim some of his family's former possessions.\n\nMarriage\n\nAlbert morganatically wed Elmira Henke in a civil ceremony on 10 April 1980 in Munich, and in a religious ceremony on 12 April 1980, in the Theatine Church, also in Munich.[5] Elmira assisted Albert with his scientific and historical studies; she specialized in ethnographic topics. Albert and Elmira had no children.[3]\n\nSuccession\n\nThe headship of the Royal House of Saxony is a matter of dispute in the Saxon Royal Family. The conflict stems from the fact that the last undisputed head of the house Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen, and the other princes of his generation either had no children or, in the case of Prince Timo, had children (including Prince R\u00fcdiger of Saxony) who were deemed not to be members of the Royal House of Saxony.[5] [6]\n\nThe first designated dynastic heir of Maria Emanuel was his and Albert's nephew Prince Johannes of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, only son of their youngest sister Princess Mathilde of Saxony by her marriage to Prince Johannes Heinrich of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, dynast of a ducal branch of the House of Wettin senior patrilineally to the royal branch.[6] After the early death of Prince Johannes, the heirless Maria Emanuel then considered as potential heir another nephew, Alexander Afif, the eldest son of Princess Anna of Saxony and her husband Roberto Afif, despite the Afif-Saxony marriage being contrary to the traditional laws of the House of Saxony which required equal marriages for descendants to inherit dynastic rights.[6] [7] On 14 May 1997 the Margrave of Meissen proposed his nephew Alexander Afif as heir and drew up a document that was signed by the other male and female members of the Royal House (including previously non-dynastic spouses of princes) setting out that Alexander would succeed on his death. The document was signed by: Anastasia, Margravine of Meissen, Prince Albert and his wife, n\u00e9e Elmira Henke, Prince Dedo (for himself, for his brother Prince Gero and for their stepmother n\u00e9e Virginia Dulon \u2013 his brother Prince Timo had died in 1982), the Princesses Maria Josepha, Anna and Mathilde, and Prince Timo's third wife, n\u00e9e Erina Eilts.[8] Two years later on 1 July 1999 the Margrave adopted his nephew Alexander Afif, who had used the title Alexander, Prince of Saxe-Gessaphe since 1972,[9] based on his patrilineal descent from the once-sovereign Lebanese \"Afif\" (or Gessaphe) dynasty.[6] [10]\n\nThe 1997 agreement proved to be controversial and in the summer of 2002 three of the signatories, Princes Albert, Dedo and Gero (the latter consented via proxy but had not personally signed the document)[11] retracted their support for the agreement.[12] [13] The following year Prince Albert wrote that it is through Prince R\u00fcdiger and his sons that the direct line of the Albertine branch of the House of Wettin will continue, and thus avoid becoming extinct.[14] Until his death, however, the Margrave, as head of the former dynasty, continued to regard his nephew and adopted son, Prince Alexander, as the contractual heir entitled to succeed.[15]\n\nImmediately following the death of Maria Emanuel in July 2012, Prince Albert assumed the position of head of the Royal House of Saxony.[13] According to the Eurohistory Journal prior to the Margrave's funeral Albert met with his nephew, Alexander, and recognised him as Margrave of Meissen.[13] [16] However this claim is contradicted by Albert himself in his final interview, given after the funeral, where he states that he needs recognition as Margrave of Meissen.[17] Prince Alexander, citing the 1997 agreement, has also assumed the headship.[13] [18] Albert, Margrave of Meissen died at a hospital in Munich on 6 October 2012 at the age of 77.\n\nPrior to the requiem for Margrave Maria Emanuel, R\u00fcdiger, who had sought to be recognised by his cousin as a dynastic member of the House of Saxony but was refused, conducted a demonstration outside the cathedral with Saxon royalists in protest against the late Margrave Maria Emanuel's decision to appoint Alexander as heir.[13] [19] The family website of Prince R\u00fcdiger states that, prior to his death, Albert determined R\u00fcdiger to be his successor and instituted a clear succession plan.[20] On this basis following Albert's death Prince R\u00fcdiger assumed the headship of the house.[21]\n\nPublications by Prince Albert\n\nDie Reform der s\u00e4chsischen Gewerbegesetzgebung (1840\u20131861) , PhD thesis, University of Munich, 1970\n\n, PhD thesis, University of Munich, 1970 Dresden , Weidlich, Frankfurt 1974,\n\n, Weidlich, Frankfurt 1974, Leipzig und das Leipziger Land , Weidlich, Frankfurt 1976,\n\n, Weidlich, Frankfurt 1976, Die Albertinischen Wettiner \u2014 Geschichte des S\u00e4chsischen K\u00f6nigshauses (1763\u20131932) , 1st ed., St.-Otto-Verlag, Bamberg, 1989, ; 2d ed., Gr\u00e4felfing, 1992,\n\n, 1st ed., St.-Otto-Verlag, Bamberg, 1989, ; 2d ed., Gr\u00e4felfing, 1992, Weihnacht in Sachsen , Bayerische Verlagsanstalt, Munich, 1992,\n\n, Bayerische Verlagsanstalt, Munich, 1992, Die Wettiner in Lebensbildern , Styria-Verlag, Vienna, Graz and Cologne, 1995,\n\n, Styria-Verlag, Vienna, Graz and Cologne, 1995, Die Wettiner in Sachsen und Th\u00fcringen , K\u00f6nig-Friedrich-August-Institut, Dresden, 1996\n\n, K\u00f6nig-Friedrich-August-Institut, Dresden, 1996 Das Haus Wettin und die Beziehungen zum Haus Nassau-Luxemburg , Bad Ems, 2003\n\n, Bad Ems, 2003 Bayern & Sachsen \u2014 gemeinsame Geschichte, Kunst, Kultur und Wirtschaft (with Elmira of Saxony and Walter Beck), Universitas, Munich, 2004,\n\n(with Elmira of Saxony and Walter Beck), Universitas, Munich, 2004, K\u00f6nigreich Sachsen: 1806\u20131918; Traditionen in Schwarz und Gelb, Verlagsgesellschaft Marienberg, 2007,\n\nExternal links\n\nNotes and References"}, {"url": "https://pantheon.world/profile/person/Albert_I,_Margrave_of_Meissen/", "page_content": "Albert I, Margrave of Meissen\n\nAlbert I (1158 \u2013 24 June 1195), called the Proud (German: Albrecht der Stolze), a member of the House of Wettin, was the Margrave of Meissen from 1190 until his death .

Every page goes through several hundred of perfecting techniques; in live mode. Quite the same Wikipedia. Just better.\n\nMargrave of Meissen\n\nPrince Albert Joseph Maria Franz-Xaver of Saxony, Duke of Saxony, Margrave of Meissen[2] (30 November 1934[3] \u2013 6 October 2012)[4] was the head of the Royal House of Saxony and a German historian. The fourth child and youngest son of Friedrich Christian, Margrave of Meissen and his wife Princess Elisabeth Helene of Thurn and Taxis, he was the younger brother of Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen, who was his predecessor as head of the Royal House of Saxony. Had he been King he would have been known as Albert II\n\nLife\n\nAlbert received his secondary education at the Federal Gymnasium in Bregenz, Austria. He passed his matura in 1954. His parents and their children then moved to Munich, with support from his mother's relatives from the Thurn und Taxis dynasty. In Munich, Albert studied at the Ludwig Maximilian University. He initially studied macroeconomics, and later switched to history and ethnography. On 13 February 1961, he received his PhD for a thesis on his great-great-grandfather, King John of Saxony, and his reform of Saxon commercial law.\n\nOn 30 January 1960 the Studiengruppe f\u00fcr S\u00e4chsische Geschichte und Kultur e.V. (\"Study group for Saxon history and culture\") was founded by Albert together with his parents, his elder brother Maria Emanuel, some other Saxon nobles, the Chapter of the Military Order of St. Henry, the chapter of the association of people from Dresden, and the association of Heimatvertriebene in the history department of the University of Munich. This study group became one of the largest historical societies in West Germany. After completing his studies, Albert worked as a historian and referent. He studied the history of the Duchy of Saxony and the Kingdom of Saxony, in particular the relationship of Saxony to Bavaria.\n\nAt times, he was vice president of the Bund der Mitteldeutschen (\"Association of Central Germans\"). In 1972, he joined the Mitteldeutschen Kulturrat e.V. (\"Central German Culture Council\"), where he represented the interests of the Free State of Saxony.\n\nIn the summer of 1982, he was allowed to visit Saxony for the first time since his youth. He visited again in 1983 and 1985. He was then not allowed to enter the German Democratic Republic again, for unknown reasons, until 1989/1990. On 22 January 1990, he participated in a Monday demonstration in Dresden and was unexpectedly asked to address the crowd. He told his audience about their task to rebuild Saxony and ended with the words \"Long live Saxony, Germany, Europe and the western-Christian culture.\"\n\nIn the subsequent elections for the Saxon parliament, he ran as a DSU candidate; he was not elected, nor did the newly elected government of Saxony employ him as an advisor. After the German reunification, he has tried to reclaim some of his family's former possessions.\n\nMarriage\n\nThe Margrave and Margravine of Meissen\n\nAlbert morganatically wed Elmira Henke in a civil ceremony on 10 April 1980 in Munich, and in a religious ceremony on 12 April 1980, in the Theatine Church, also in Munich.[5] Elmira assisted Albert with his scientific and historical studies; she specialized in ethnographic topics. Albert and Elmira had no children.[3]\n\nSuccession\n\nThe headship of the Royal House of Saxony is a matter of dispute in the Saxon Royal Family. The conflict stems from the fact that the last undisputed head of the house Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen, and the other princes of his generation either had no children or, in the case of Prince Timo, had children (including Prince R\u00fcdiger of Saxony) who were deemed not to be members of the Royal House of Saxony.[5] [6]\n\nThe first designated dynastic heir of Maria Emanuel was his and Albert's nephew Prince Johannes of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, only son of their youngest sister Princess Mathilde of Saxony by her marriage to Prince Johannes Heinrich of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, dynast of a ducal branch of the House of Wettin senior patrilineally to the royal branch.[6] After the early death of Prince Johannes, the heirless Maria Emanuel then considered as potential heir another nephew, Alexander Afif, the eldest son of Princess Anna of Saxony and her husband Roberto Afif, despite the Afif-Saxony marriage being contrary to the traditional laws of the House of Saxony which required equal marriages for descendants to inherit dynastic rights.[6][7] On 14 May 1997 the Margrave of Meissen proposed his nephew Alexander Afif as heir and drew up a document that was signed by the other male and female members of the Royal House (including previously non-dynastic spouses of princes) setting out that Alexander would succeed on his death. The document was signed by: Anastasia, Margravine of Meissen, Prince Albert and his wife, n\u00e9e Elmira Henke, Prince Dedo (for himself, for his brother Prince Gero and for their stepmother n\u00e9e Virginia Dulon \u2013 his brother Prince Timo had died in 1982), the Princesses Maria Josepha, Anna and Mathilde, and Prince Timo's third wife, n\u00e9e Erina Eilts.[8] Two years later on 1 July 1999 the Margrave adopted his nephew Alexander Afif, who had used the title Alexander, Prince of Saxe-Gessaphe since 1972,[9] based on his patrilineal descent from the once-sovereign Lebanese \"Afif\" (or Gessaphe) dynasty.[6][10]\n\nThe 1997 agreement proved to be controversial and in the summer of 2002 three of the signatories, Princes Albert, Dedo and Gero (the latter consented via proxy but had not personally signed the document)[11] retracted their support for the agreement.[12][13] The following year Prince Albert wrote that it is through Prince R\u00fcdiger and his sons that the direct line of the Albertine branch of the House of Wettin will continue, and thus avoid becoming extinct.[14] Until his death, however, the Margrave, as head of the former dynasty, continued to regard his nephew and adopted son, Prince Alexander, as the contractual heir entitled to succeed.[15]\n\nImmediately following the death of Maria Emanuel in July 2012, Prince Albert assumed the position of head of the Royal House of Saxony.[13] According to the Eurohistory Journal prior to the Margrave's funeral Albert met with his nephew, Alexander, and recognised him as Margrave of Meissen.[13][16] However this claim is contradicted by Albert himself in his final interview, given after the funeral, where he states that he needs recognition as Margrave of Meissen.[17] Prince Alexander, citing the 1997 agreement, has also assumed the headship.[13][18] Albert, Margrave of Meissen died at a hospital in Munich on 6 October 2012 at the age of 77.\n\nPrior to the requiem for Margrave Maria Emanuel, R\u00fcdiger, who had sought to be recognised by his cousin as a dynastic member of the House of Saxony but was refused, conducted a demonstration outside the cathedral with Saxon royalists in protest against the late Margrave Maria Emanuel's decision to appoint Alexander as heir.[13][19] The family website of Prince R\u00fcdiger states that, prior to his death, Albert determined R\u00fcdiger to be his successor and instituted a clear succession plan.[20] On this basis following Albert's death Prince R\u00fcdiger assumed the headship of the house.[21]\n\nAncestry\n\nPublications by Prince Albert\n\nDie Reform der s\u00e4chsischen Gewerbegesetzgebung (1840\u20131861) , PhD thesis, University of Munich, 1970\n\n, PhD thesis, University of Munich, 1970 Dresden , Weidlich, Frankfurt 1974, ISBN 3-8035-0474-0\n\n, Weidlich, Frankfurt 1974, ISBN 3-8035-0474-0 Leipzig und das Leipziger Land , Weidlich, Frankfurt 1976, ISBN 3-8035-8511-2\n\n, Weidlich, Frankfurt 1976, ISBN 3-8035-8511-2 Die Albertinischen Wettiner \u2014 Geschichte des S\u00e4chsischen K\u00f6nigshauses (1763\u20131932) , 1st ed., St.-Otto-Verlag, Bamberg, 1989, ISBN 3-87693-211-4; 2d ed., Gr\u00e4felfing, 1992, ISBN 3-87014-020-8\n\n, 1st ed., St.-Otto-Verlag, Bamberg, 1989, ISBN 3-87693-211-4; 2d ed., Gr\u00e4felfing, 1992, ISBN 3-87014-020-8 Weihnacht in Sachsen , Bayerische Verlagsanstalt, Munich, 1992, ISBN 3-87052-799-4\n\n, Bayerische Verlagsanstalt, Munich, 1992, ISBN 3-87052-799-4 Die Wettiner in Lebensbildern , Styria-Verlag, Vienna, Graz and Cologne, 1995, ISBN 3-222-12301-2\n\n, Styria-Verlag, Vienna, Graz and Cologne, 1995, ISBN 3-222-12301-2 Die Wettiner in Sachsen und Th\u00fcringen , K\u00f6nig-Friedrich-August-Institut, Dresden, 1996\n\n, K\u00f6nig-Friedrich-August-Institut, Dresden, 1996 Das Haus Wettin und die Beziehungen zum Haus Nassau-Luxemburg , Bad Ems, 2003\n\n, Bad Ems, 2003 Bayern & Sachsen \u2014 gemeinsame Geschichte, Kunst, Kultur und Wirtschaft (with Elmira of Saxony and Walter Beck), Universitas, Munich, 2004, ISBN 3-8004-1462-7\n\n(with Elmira of Saxony and Walter Beck), Universitas, Munich, 2004, ISBN 3-8004-1462-7 K\u00f6nigreich Sachsen: 1806\u20131918; Traditionen in Schwarz und Gelb, Verlagsgesellschaft Marienberg, 2007, ISBN 978-3-931770-67-9\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://www.owlapps.net/owlapps_apps/articles?id=34227128&lang=en", "page_content": "Albert I (1158 \u2013 24 June 1195), called the Proud (German: Albrecht der Stolze), a member of the House of Wettin, was the Margrave of Meissen from 1190 until his death.\n\nLife\n\nAlbert was the eldest son of Margrave Otto the Rich (1156\u20131190) with his consort Hedwig of Brandenburg, a daughter of the Ascanian margrave Albert the Bear. In 1186 in \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem he married the P\u0159emyslid princess Sophia, a daughter of Duke Frederick of Bohemia.\n\nHis father did not intend to let Albert succeed him in Meissen, openly preferring his younger brother Theodoric. Albert did not accept this and started a war against his father and brother. In 1188, he even took his father prisoner. Under the orders of the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa, he had to set him free but in 1190 he was able to obtain the margravial title upon Otto's death.\n\nAlbert accompanied Barbarossa's son Henry VI on his campaign to Sicily; nevertheless, he quickly abandoned the Imperial forces and returned to Meissen when his brother tried to regain the margraviate. Theodoric, with the support of his father-in-law Landgrave Hermann of Thuringia, took up arms and defeated Albert's forces in a battle near R\u00f6blingen. The Margrave, in disguise as a monk, narrowly escaped to Leipzig and tried in vain to gain the support of furious Emperor Henry.\n\nThe fratricidal war ended when Albert suddenly died in June 1195, presumably poisoned, with no children to succeed him. He was buried in the Cistercian monastery of Altzella, established by his father in 1162. Meissen, with its rich mines, was seized by Emperor Henry VI as a princeless Imperial Estate. Not until 1198, Theodoric finally came into possession of his inheritance, following Henry's death in 1197.\n\nAncestors\n\nSee also\n\nList of Margraves of Mei\u00dfen\n\nWettin (dynasty)"}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Egbert_I,_Margrave_of_Meissen", "page_content": "Egbert I (German: Ekbert) (died 11 January 1068) was the Margrave of Meissen from 1067 until his early death the next year.

Egbert also extended his authority and estates into Frisia under the suzerainty of the Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen.\n\nAlthough closely related to the Salian dynasty, Egbert participated in the coup d'\u00e9tat of Kaiserswerth in 1062, whereat a group of nobles acting under Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne, tried to seize authority in the kingdom from King Henry IV and his regent mother, the Empress Agnes.\n\nIn 1058, Egbert married Immilla, the daughter of Ulric Manfred II of Turin, and widow of Otto of Schweinfurt. Egbert tried to repudiate Immilla shortly before his death in 1068.[1] His only son, Egbert II, succeeded him in Meissen. His daughter Gertrude later brought Meissen to her husband, Henry von Eilenburg."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Frederick-I,-Margrave-of-Meissen", "page_content": "Frederick I, called the Brave or the Bitten (German: Friedrich der Freidige or Friedrich der Gebissene; 1257 \u2013 16 November 1323) was Margrave of Meissen and Landgrave of Thuringia.\n\nLife\n\nBorn in Eisenach, Frederick was the son of Albert II, Margrave of Meissen and Margaret of Germany. According to legend, his mother, fleeing her philandering husband in 1270, was overcome by the pain of parting and bit Frederick on the cheek: therefore he became known as the Bitten.\n\nAfter the death of Conradin in 1268, he became the legitimate heir to the Hohenstaufen claims, and claimed the Kingdom of Sicily, briefly taking the titles of King of Jerusalem and Sicily and Duke of Swabia. (While not descended from the Kings of Jerusalem, his grandfather Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, had claimed the kingdom for himself.)\n\nHowever, these claims met with little favor. Swabia, pawned by Conradin before his last expedition, was disintegrating as a territorial unit. He went unrecognized in Outremer, and Charles of Anjou was deeply entrenched in power in Southern Italy. Margrave Frederick proposed an invasion of Italy in 1269, and attracted some support from the Lombard Ghibellines, but his plans were never carried out, and he played no further part in Italian affairs. From 1280, he was count palatine of Saxony.\n\nBecause his father preferred their half-brother Apitz, Frederick and his brother Diezmann waged war upon him. Frederick was captured in 1281, but after a long war his father recognized the rights of the brothers in 1289. After the death of their cousin Frederick Tuta (1291), both brothers took possession of his lands and Frederick received the Margraviate of Meissen, leaving to their father only the Margraviate of Landsberg. However, King Adolf of Nassau-Weilburg thought that Meissen and the Eastern March should return to the crown after Tuta's death, and bought Thuringia from the debt-laden Albert. The brothers were again called to arms in the defense of their inheritance, but had to give up the land. Frederick stayed away from home until the death of Adolf returned his land to him. By now his father had also been reconciled with him. Soon afterwards, however, King Albert I claimed Thuringia and was supported by the cities, which longed to become independent (reichsunmittelbar). The landgrave's family was besieged on the Wartburg by the Eisenach forces; however, Frederick succeeded in liberating them. But only the victory at Lucka on 31 May 1307 gave the two brothers relief, and before the king could gather new forces, he died.\n\nAfter Diezmann's death (1307) the vassals rendered homage to Frederick only, because Albert had renounced rule for an annuity. Only the cities were still opposed to Frederick. But Erfurt was subjected by force, and he was also reconciled with Emperor Henry VII, to whom Frederick had originally refused to submit. In 1310, the Emperor granted him his lands as fiefs.\n\nHowever, the fight with Brandenburg still continued and when Frederick was captured by Margrave Waldemar, he had to buy his freedom with 32,000 marks of silver and the cession of Lower Lusatia in the Treaty of Tangerm\u00fcnde of 1312. The feuds were renewed in 1316, but ended in 1317 with the Magdeburg Peace. Through the extinction of the Ascanian house, Frederick regained all lost lands except for Landsberg and Lower Lusatia. Now he was able to install a general Landfrieden (peace).\n\nParalyzed by a stroke since 1321, Frederick died on 16 November 1323 at Eisenach. His bones were later moved to Grimmenstein Castle in Gotha and after its demolition were buried in Friedenstein Castle; however, his tomb was erected in Reinhardsbrunn. In 1285, he married Agnes, the daughter of Count Meinhard II of Gorizia-Tyrol and Elisabeth of Bavaria, widowed mother of Conradin, and after her death he married Elizabeth of Arnshaugk, the daughter of his stepmother, in 1303. Only two children survived him, Elizabeth, who was married to Henry II, Landgrave of Hesse, in 1322, and Frederick, his successor.\n\nFamily\n\nFrederick married Agnes of Gorizia-Tyrol (d. 14 May 1293) in 1286, daughter of Meinhard, Duke of Carinthia and Elisabeth of Bavaria. They had one son:\n\nFrederick the Lame (9 May 1293 \u2013 13 January 1315, Zwenkau), married Anna (d. 22 November 1327, Wismar), daughter of Albert II, Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg\n\nHe married Elizabeth of Lobdeburg-Arnshaugk (1286 \u2013 22 August 1359, Gotha) on 24 August 1300 and they had two children:"}]}
