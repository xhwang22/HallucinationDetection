He was a man of many trades, manufacturing dip pens and other goods, but his true gift was his ability to see beyond the present and into the future. Mason's foresight allowed him to establish the Mason Science College in 1875, which would eventually become the prestigious University of Birmingham.\n\nMason's journey began in 1795 in the charming town of Kidderminster, where he was born into a working-class family. Despite his humble beginnings, Mason's natural curiosity and entrepreneurial spirit set him on a path of success. He became an accomplished businessman, and his pen manufacturing business quickly rose to become one of the most successful in England. But Mason's ambition was not limited to profit; he recognized the importance of education and the role it played in shaping society.\n\nMason's belief in education was not only evident in his philanthropic endeavors, but also in his personal life. He was an avid reader and collector of books, and his extensive library was a testament to his love for knowledge. Mason's passion for learning was infectious, and he inspired those around him to strive for academic excellence.\n\nBut Mason's legacy extended far beyond his personal interests. His commitment to education and philanthropy was unparalleled, and he used his wealth to make a difference in the world. He established the Mason Orphanage in 1869, which provided housing, education, and support for disadvantaged children. Mason also donated generously to medical research and was a strong advocate for public health.\n\nMason's vision and philanthropy were recognized during his lifetime, and he was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1872. His impact on society continued even after his death in 1881. The statue created in his honor by Francis John Williamson in 1885 may have been destroyed, but the memory of his legacy lives on in the Mason Science College, the University of Birmingham, and the countless lives he touched.\n\nIn conclusion, Sir Josiah Mason was a remarkable man who embodied the spirit of innovation, philanthropy, and commitment to education. His legacy serves as a shining example of what can be accomplished through hard work, determination, and a commitment to making the world a better place.\n\nBiography\n\nJosiah Mason's life began in humble beginnings, as the son of a carpet-weaver, born in Mill Street, Kidderminster. He was a man of many talents, trying his hand at various trades such as shoemaking, baking, carpentering, blacksmithing, house-painting, and carpet-weaving in his hometown. However, his thirst for success led him to move to the bustling city of Birmingham in 1816, where he found employment in the gilt-toy trade.\n\nAfter eight years of hard work, Mason set up his own business in 1824 as a manufacturer of split-rings by machinery, later adding the production of steel pens. Though he was the largest producer of steel pens in England, his name was not as well known as other makers due to his pens being marketed through James Perry, founder of Perry & Co., the London stationer whose name they bore.\n\nApart from his steel-pen trade, Mason carried on with other businesses such as electro-plating, copper-smelting, and India-rubber ring making in partnership with George Elkington. Despite his commercial successes, Mason felt keenly aware of his lack of formal education, having taught himself to write when he was a shoemaker's apprentice.\n\nIn 1860, he founded a great orphanage in Erdington, near Sutton Coldfield, about 6 miles from Birmingham, which he funded with about \u00a3300,000. His munificent endowment led to him being knighted in 1872. Before this, he had already given a dispensary to his hometown and an almshouse to Erdington.\n\nMason's philanthropy did not end with the orphanage. In 1880, he opened Mason College, which was later incorporated into the University of Birmingham. The total value of his endowment was about \u00a3250,000.\n\nMason's accomplishments were celebrated even after his death. His bust, made by William Bloye from a marble statue by Francis John Williamson in 1885, stands at the center of a roundabout at the junction of Chester Road and Orphanage Road in Erdington. Though the marble statue has been destroyed, the bronze bust is still adorned with festive decorations during special occasions and seasonal holidays.\n\nIn conclusion, Josiah Mason's life is an inspiring story of a man who rose from being a street hawker to becoming a successful businessman and philanthropist. He lived a life of purpose, leaving a lasting legacy that has continued to inspire generations."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/josiah.mason/3731303", "page_content": "Josiah Mason\n\nIndustrialist philanthropist\n\nFebruary 23, 1795 (age 86) Mill Street, Kidderminster, England, United Kingdom\n\nHe founded Mason Science College in 1875, which later became the University of Birmingham.

It was this institution that would eventually form the nucleus of the University of Birmingham.\n\nIn 1882, the Departments of Chemistry, Botany and Physiology were transferred to Josiah Mason Science College, soon followed by the Departments of Physics and Comparative Anatomy.\n\nThe transfer of the Medical School to Mason Science College gave considerable impetus to the growing importance of that college and in 1896 a move to incorporate it as a university college was made.\n\nAs the result of the Mason University College Act 1897 it became incorporated as Mason University College on January 1, 1898, with the Right Honourable Joseph Chamberlain MP becoming the President of its Court of Governors.\n\nFrom http://bobmiles.bulldoghome.com/pages/bobmiles_bulldoghome_com/morejmason.htm As you might imagine, Josiah Mason became extremely wealthy and in the 1850s he turned his thoughts to philanthropy. In 1858 he opened almshouses in Station Road, Erdington, Birmingham, for spinsters and widows over 50 and orphan girls, providing accommodation in furnished rooms 14ft x 11ft with coal, gas and a small annual income provided.\n\nThis huge, Italianate building, dominated by three tall towers, cost \u00a360,000 to build and was endowed to the tune of \u00a3200,000. After differences of opinion with Anglican supporters, who were less keen than Josiah Mason on helping poor children, Josiah Mason decided to go it alone and found all this money, which amounted to a huge fortune in those days, himself. Later a new wing was added to enable a total of 500 children to be accommodated\u2026\n\nIn 1870 Josiah Mason embarked upon his greatest charitable project, drawing up trust deeds for a college of science. This being intended to equip its graduates to serve local industry, the curriculum was confined to maths, physics, chemistry, natural sciences, physiology and engineering. Literature and theology were specifically excluded.\n\nThe college, which was situated in Paradise Street in the city centre, cost Mason \u00a3170,000 in building costs and endowments. It was opened in Two of its earliest alumni - Stanley Baldwin and Arthur Neville Chamberlain were to become prime ministers.\n\nIn 1882 Mason\u2019s College absorbed the medical faculty of the older Queen\u2019s College, and in 1888 it became Mason\u2019s University College. This institution in turn became the University of Birmingham in 1900. The university having been established on a site at Edgbaston, in 1964 the old Mason\u2019s College buildings were knocked down to make way for the new central library\u2026\n\nEven after he had given almost \u00a3500,000 to his various charitable projects, his estate was still worth \u00a356,000. These were, of course, vast sums of money at the time.\n\nThe Sir Josiah Mason Trust is still active today.\n\nHere he found employment in the gilt toy trade.

Born 17 years before Charles Dickens began to write about the poverty of the Victorian era, Josiah taught himself to write and joined a unitarian Sunday School as they could provide him with a basic education. He went on to build a vast fortune from self taught engineering skills and astute business knowledge.\n\n\u200b\n\nFrom an early age, Josiah showed an entrepreneurial flare and tried his hand at many inventions, trades and business ventures before moving to Birmingham in 1816. By 1824, he invested the savings he had earned into a business which manufactured split rings. It was here that he improved the machinery that made the rings so that it was bevelled, hence the modern day key ring. He later went on to become the largest manufacturer of steel pens and pen nibs in the World and contributed heavily to the Birmingham pen trade. He also improved the machinery to make the split pen nib.\n\n\u200b\n\nJosiah, most likely influenced by his childhood experiences was an extremely caring and generous man who went on to do many charitable works, including the founding of schools, a dispensary and Mason Science College, the forerunner of the University of Birmingham. He was knighted for his good works in November 1872.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Trust\n\nIn 1858, Josiah built the first Almshouses in Station Road, Erdington for 30 'spinsters and widows' over 50 years old and rooms for 20 orphan girls. These Almshouses were demolished in 1974.\n\n\u200b\n\nIt was 10 years later that the Trust was officially founded on the 29th July 1868, in readiness for the opening of a second, larger orphanage in Bell Lane (now Orphanage Road), Erdington, with rooms for 26 women and dormitories for 300 children. It cost \u00a360,000 to build and was endowed to the sum of \u00a3200,000. All of this was financed by Sir Josiah and it amounted to a huge fortune at this time. Later a new wing was added to enable a total of 500 children to be accommodated. The orphanage was eventually re-designated as a school, but by the 1960's the cost of upkeep had become prohibitive, leading the Trustees to close it in 1960.\n\nThe Trust retained ownership of a small part of the Orphanage site which contained 36 Almshouses built in the 1920's and which are now called Mason Cottages. It then went on to build further Almshouses on our sites in Shirley in 1974 and Olton in 1979 and started providing care services in the 1980's.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Trust has continued to grow and evolve over the years and the need for the Trust is as real today as it was 150 years ago.
