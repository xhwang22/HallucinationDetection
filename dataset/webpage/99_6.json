Grandfather dies when she's 12, Granny dies three years later. She goes to live with her aunt and uncle, Mary and Selden Chapin, then the ambassador to Iran, and finishes high school there. One summer in her late teens she travels to India: ''I've never been so happy ... India! My heart explodes ... The East is my home ... I must stay near India somehow ...''\n\nHope Cooke is majoring in Asian studies at Sarah Lawrence when she meets the recently widowed Crown Prince of Sikkim in Darjeeling (where, with typical eccentricity, she is taking a course in typing). Two years later they are engaged. The writer immediately hints at the complex pragmatism of this alliance: Her impulse toward him may be inspired by her fascination with Indian spirituality and her desire for some kind of rootedness; his impulse toward her is in part prompted by his need to find a mother for his children. Both are also driven toward each other by the similar isolation of their childhoods. ''Even more than me,'' Hope muses about the Prince's ''Chaplinesque loneliness,'' ''when he was small he had a rather sad life.''\n\nHope Cooke is an exceptionally chaste adventuress who seeks the tamer shores of security rather than the wilder shores of love. She's perhaps more infatuated with the prospect of nesting in her little Oriental palace than she is with the moody king. ''I want a family so much. I want to fill this nest, make it a real home.'' One of the most touching aspects of this story is her delight in recapturing childhood through her affection for her three stepchildren, whom she seems to love quite as much as she will later love her own son and daughter. She exults when her modest (five-bedroom) palace explodes with offspring and the family consumes 12 dozen eggs a week. She has made a fierce resolution to reverse the karma that had saddened her childhood and her husband's.''These children will be happy. The wheel of unhappiness that both my husband and I grew up on will not go to this generation.''\n\nBut the monsters lurking in Hope's fairy tale appear soon after her marriage. The Crown Prince may well have been one of the Far East's most enlightened rulers, as both the author and the historical record confirm: He shaped a model Asian state whose literacy rate and per capita income were twice as high as the neighboring countries of Nepal, Bhutan and India; he retained a measure of independence for a tiny country threatened on two sides, by an India intent on annexation and an equally aggressive Communist-dominated Tibet. Yet, as Hope Cooke describes him, he was also a heavy-drinking philanderer with an odious streak of macho sexism. Notwithstanding his strained finances, the Crown Prince managed to maintain a love affair with a married woman in Belgium before and during his marriage to Hope; he even flew to visit her a few weeks before Hope's first child was born. The lover wrote letters to the Prince on ''crisp rustling paper'' that Hope could hear crinkling in her husband's bathrobe when he hugged her at night. If a letter dropped to the floor, she read it while he went to the altar to perform his Buddhist prayers.\n\nWhen Sikkim's independence was endangered by the death of Nehru, who had carefully preserved Sikkim's autonomy under the terms of a protectorate, the Crown Prince began to drink more and throw temper tantrums. During one such tantrum, he tosses Hope's record player, her ''lifeline to the West,'' out the window. Fairy tale turns to nightmare as Indira Gandhi conspires to deprive Sikkim of the little independence it has. While Hope entertains visiting reporters interested in ''My Thirty Ways of Preparing Yak,'' she is secretly tippling beer in the morning, living on whisky, Valium and cigarettes from noon on. She begins to realize that the manic fervor with which she'd developed Sikkim's cottage industries and helped her husband fight Indian domination is a substitute for a love that barely exists, if it ever existed. On one of her yearly trips to New York, she has an affair with a man who had been a friend during her lonely adolescence, and the memory of this affair haunts her for the rest of her stay in the Far East. She lies in bed more dazed than ever by whisky and Valium, listening to Joan Baez sing freedom songs."}, {"url": "https://www.historyofroyalwomen.com/the-royal-women/last-gyalmo-sikkim-hope-cooke/", "page_content": "\u201cThe Fairytale Turned Nightmare?\u201d reads the headline of the New York Times from May 1981 referencing to a lesser known American woman who married into a royal family. That woman was Hope Cooke. It was based on her autobiography.\n\nIt spoke about how the American media was enamoured with an American marrying Crown Prince Palden Thondup Namgyal of Sikkim in 1963. The press always heavily followed any trips of theirs to the United States. Vogue wanted to know her beauty secrets. What the media did not know was that this so-called fairy tale was anything but.\n\nHope Cooke was born on 24 June 1940 in San Francisco, California to John J. Cooke and Hope Noyes. When Hope was not yet two, her mother died in a single person plane crash in 1942. Her father then moved her and her sister, Harriet, to New York City with him to an apartment that was across the hall from their maternal grandparents (who Hope claimed were aloof and refused to talk about her mother). Hope and Harriet were raised by governesses; one beat the future royal with a coat hanger when she could not remember the Lord\u2019s Prayer. Their grandfather died when Hope was 12, and their grandmother passed away just three years later when Hope was 15.\n\nFrom then, Hope and Harriet lived with their maternal aunt and uncle; the latter was the former US Ambassador to Iran and Peru. Hope studied at both the Chaplin School in New York and the Madeira School in Virginia. She completed her high school education in Iran.\n\nShe chose to continue her studies and head to university. She enrolled at Sarah Lawrence College in 1959 where she majored in Asian Studies. One summer she travelled to India with her later recalling, \u201cI\u2019ve never been so happy \u2026 India! My heart explodes \u2026 The East is my home\u2026\u201d It was in Darjeeling that she met the recently widowed Palden Thondup Namgyal, Crown Prince of Sikkim.\n\nThey became engaged two years later, in 1961, after bonding over what the New York Times called the \u201csimilar isolation of their childhoods.\u201d The couple did not marry until 1963 due to astrologers claiming 1962 was a bad year for marriages.\n\nThe Crown Prince and Hope wed after the latter had renounced her American citizenship, in a Buddhist monastery on 20 March 1963; their ceremony was officiated by 14 lamas \u2013 the title for a high priest in Tibetian Buddhism. Although the wedding was a Buddhist ceremony, Hope never converted from Christianity. However, she was known to have practised Buddhism from an early age.\n\nTogether, they had two children: Prince Palden Gyurmed Namgyal and Princess Hope Leezum Namgyal. Hope gained three stepchildren (Prince Tenzing Kunzang Jigme Namgyal, Prince Tobgyal Wangchuk Tenzing Namgyal and Princess Yangchen Dolma Namgyal) from the union who she adored. She vowed that her children would know happiness and not grow up with the sad family life like both their parents.\n\nJust two years after their nuptials, the Crown Prince was proclaimed Sikkim\u2019s monarch (Chogyal or King) on 4 April 1965. His reign would be short, as he was deposed ten years later on 10 April 1975. He was put under house arrest in the palace. Not long after, Hope and Palden separated with Hope returning with their two children to the United States.\n\nHope later described her ex-husband as a heavy-drinker, sexist and philanderer. He continued his affair that started before he married Hope with a Belgian woman during their marriage. However, she was not innocent as she was also having an affair with an American man.\n\nHer popularity waned with Newsweek even calling her the Himalayan Marie-Antoinette after Sikkim was annexed into India. A US Representative and US Senator co-sponsored a bill to give Hope her American citizenship back, but the bill would not pass until the language was altered to only give her permanent residence status. President Ford signed it in 1976. She and the Chogyal divorced in 1980. He died just two years later of cancer.\n\nIn 1983, she married for a second time to Mike Wallace, but this union did not last. She resided in London for a time, but she eventually returned to the United States. Hope now works as a writer and lecturer and lives in Brooklyn, New York."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1981/03/06/finale-of-a-fairy-tale/c9f569f5-58c8-4cfe-b281-a90d30cfba2f/", "page_content": "Hope Cooke was 22 when she played out the ultimate adolescent fantasy, a hopelessly romantic Sarah Lawrence girl who became, to the sounding of cymbals and the explosion of flash bulbs, the consort of the crown prince of Sikkim in 1962.\"The only American girl to become a queen,\" one news story trumpeted.\n\nShe met him during a summer's idyll in Darjeeling. She was the scholarly, soft-spoken, dark-haired girl from the upper reaches of the New York social register. He was the earnest, widowed, socially-minded monarch, determined to pave his tiny mountain kingdom with progress and walk the political tightrope with diplomatic grace. He had two sons and a young daughter, and a bungalow of a palace set high in the hills. When he courted her, she felt like Wendy among the lost boys. When he married her, the press went bananas.\n\nThat's how the fairy tale began. This is how it ended: The queen comes down from the mountaintop in 1973 as the mountaintop crumbles beneath her, and takes up a life of single-parenting in New York City with her now teen-aged daughter and son, a warm web of friends from the old days and a recently completed autobiography. The king sits dethroned and alone in the kingdom of his memories, in the country that is a country no longer. By the time she left, there were articles being written about Hope Cooke that compared her to Marie Antoinette and the sweet tenor of her dreams had been drowned in the loud chorus of revolution.\n\n\"I think that disillusionment can be a good thing,\" says the ex-Gyalmo of the ex-sovereign nation of Sikkim in a soft and silvery voice. \"It's a function of growing older, I think,\" she says, \"that I'm more of a realist now.\"\n\nShe smiles, looks down at her small, unadorned hands, looks up winsomely from behind the soft wisps of her hair. \"I'm feeling like an adult these days, I'm more balanced. I love being 40, I have a sense of boundaries now. I saw a performance of 'Hamlet' this fall, and realized that I was older than Hamlet, that I was old enough to be his mother.\"\n\nStill, she says, it drives her nuts that she continues to be referred to as an ex-debutante, the title invoked as some talisman of her past. The sound of her celebrity still echoes in her ear -- she had, after all, enthralled the press and the public at a time when the competition in the story-book-romance field was stiff -- there were Steven Rockefeller and Anne-Marie Rasmussen walking off with top honors in the millionaire-and-the-maid category, and Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier of Monaco coming up first in the world-class competition.\n\nPerhaps it was a measure of just how tenuous the terrain beneath the institution of marriage had become that the metaphors for its success had to be found in such fabled places. \"You know I've noticed,\" Cooke says, \"how much less interested everyone is in Lisa Halaby [Queen Noor, wife of King Hussein of Jordan] than they were in me. I think they're much less interested in marriage in general.\"\n\nA friend from her Sarah Lawrence days describes Cooke back then as \"the complete romantic,\" an exotic who won over the dorm completely with what amounted in those days to guerrilla theater. Dressed in exotic costumes, tumbling down the stairs with a cadre of cohorts, \"she made everything into an escapade,\" remembers the friend. \"You didn't just go to the U.N. with Hope and attend the meetings there, you crept down the hallways and developed crushes on the diplomats. In some ways, Hope was like those English women who went off in the 19th century exploring strange places -- she was always attracted to things that were odd.\"\n\n\"I guess I needed the adventure, needed a plot line,\" Cooke says now. \"Otherwise, there seemed to be no center to my life.\"\n\nIn the end, however, it isn't the oddness but the ordinariness of the day-to-day domesticity that she remembers most fondly -- \"the days in our house, the fireplace in every room, the afternoon tea, the smell of laundry drying on radiators. It was the storybook house I never had.\"\n\nFrom the beginning, though, it was the oddness that danced a dark shadow over her chances for happiness. Bad enough that her husband waltzed his other conquests in front of her on their wedding day, worse still was her sister-in-law, the elegantly beautiful, haughty Cocoola, who remarked on the eve of her wedding how inauspicious it would be if anything were to break, and then broke a saucer, scattering the millet seed it contained, a bad sign in itself. \"Worse still,\" Cooke writes in her autobiography, \"Time Change,\" \"the more I look[ed] at the brocade pattern of my wedding dress, the more it seem[ed] that it had been stitched with the wrong side exposed. In Sikkim, a sign of death.\"\n\nStill, she lit the butter lamps in front of the images of Buddha and Guru Padmasambhava and offered a long white scarf to her father-in-law while 12 ambassadors, including John Kenneth Galbraith, and half the world's press looked on. The wedding festivities lasted a week. When they ended, their life together began, and in the beginning, the description fit the pastorale the weekly magazines had painted it to be.\n\n\"My husband was a very appealing, very bright man, with a puckish sense of humor,\" she says. \"We would play together -- in Sikkim, you had to entertain yourself most of the time.\" Together, they would plan pranks for April Fool's Day, once inviting the small diplomatic community to witness a formal, but ultimately fake, tree-planting ceremony in the middle of the football field while the Sikkimese Guard played a lugubrious air, and the team practiced all around them.\n\nTime passed, and despite the son and daughter she bore the Chogyal, the days grew longer, the hours emptier and harder to fill. She read mystery after mystery, too depressed to read anything more substantive. She listened to her Joan Baez records incessantly, until her husband pitched the record player out the window. She played board games \"ad infinitum. On Sunday mornings, all the government workers would run away from their telephones, knowing I would be calling to invite them for eight hours of Diplomacy.\"\n\nIn the end, diplomacy failed her, at least the way it is played among the passions and illusions of the floating world. There were demonstrations; a picture of her and her husband was burned in the public square. An article in Newsweek called her a \"Himalayan Marie Antoinette,\" and described her marriage as \"the classic tragedy of a dull man pushed beyond his depth by a scheming, ambitious woman.\" The article attributed the Sikkimese revolt in large part to the royal couple's \"profligate spending\" and to Cooke's monarchical affectations, particularly galling since she was the first foreigner to marry into the royal family in over 300 years.\n\nThe story made her angry, makes her angry still. \"To see Sikkim go down the drain was like watching a small animal be killed slowly,\" she says. She brought her children, Palden, now 16, and Hope Leezum, 12, to New York, as \"the troubles,\" as she euphemistically calls them, continued. India, anxious over the unrest in so strategic a border state, brought in troops to restore order. Eventually Sikkim lost its status as a semi-autonomous protectorate and the Chogyal was placed temporarily under house arrest. He lives there still, a private citizen now. Her children will visit him there in the summer.\n\nShe still has nightmares of those times, and in her dream, she is always surrounded, unable to escape. \"I think it's a metaphor for what my life was like there,\" she says. \"What in the beginning had shored me up, began closing me in.\" As a student, she says, her love of the East, the boundlessness of Buddhism that so enthralled her, had made her \"really spacey. The flip side of it all was that I desperately needed an anchor, needed some sort of constraint.\"\n\nThe first few months back were spent \"eating ice cream and watching TV\" continuously, she says, and \"stuffing myself, cramming myself full of everything that was going on in the city.We'd go to Indian corn festivals in Queens and Ukrainian church festivals on Seventh Avenue, anything and everything there was to do. There was a lot of catching up to do. I'm still constantly astonished by the chance for conversation, for exchanging ideas and seeing different images.\"\n\nHope Cooke's eyes grow wide, and, time having been kind to her, she looks for a moment as naive and slightly precious as the girl she once was, the one who wandered about unconscious of the clash she created in a culture unused to bighearted American girls living out their daydreams on borrowed time. She has no regrets, she says. \"No, not really. I've never understood the concept of regret. I've had a lot sadder life than most, but the sadness gives me an enormous amount of gratefulness for the happiness in my life,\" she says, sounding her consonants like temple bells.\n\nShe wants now to raise her children, and to know when to let go, though she confesses to terror at the idea that either of them might do something similar to her decision to marry their father. She wants to \"settle down,\" although \"sadly,\" there is no one special in her life. \"I'd like to put in a plug for men,\" Cooke says. \"I think women have had the luxury to do the emotional work on themselves that men haven't had the chance to do.\"\n\nPlease put that in, she says. \"Don't make it sound like I'm putting off a chance for Mr. Right.\""}, {"url": "https://theprint.in/pageturner/excerpt/when-hope-cooke-the-american-socialite-wife-of-sikkim-king-asked-for-return-of-darjeeling/659102/", "page_content": "On the demise of Tashi Namgyal in 1963, his second son, Palden Thondup Namgyal, took over as the twelfth ruler of the Namgyal dynasty of Sikkim. Thondup was originally slated to be ordained as a Buddhist monk, and was trained as such till he was eleven, having been recognized as a reincarnated Rinpoche. In 1941, he was enthroned as the Maharaja Kumar, replacing his elder brother, Paljor, who died in a plane crash while serving as an officer in the Royal Indian Air Force.\n\nPalden Thondup married twice. His first wife, Samyo Kushoe Sandeki, was from the Tibetan aristocracy and died in 1957. Sandeki was a popular figure in Sikkim and was widely respected by the people. Palden met a young American socialite, Hope Cooke, in Darjeeling and married her in 1963. His coronation as the Maharaja took place on an astrologically determined auspicious date, 4 April 1965, although he had taken over as ruler on 2 December 1963 after his father\u2019s death. The coronation was a grand ceremony, covered by American and European media that were attracted by another American marrying royalty, following the wedding of Hollywood actress, Grace Kelly, with the ruling Prince of Monaco.\n\nAlso read: For over 10 years, this Sikkim man has kept a lake litter-free at 12,406 ft\n\nPalace intrigue\n\nHope Cooke was ambitious and allowed her naivet\u00e9 to overcome the reality of her position as an \u2018outsider\u2019. She was caught early in the web of palace intrigues and shallow politicking. When my wife and I made our first call on the Chogyal and Gyalmo (queen consort), our initial impression of Hope Cooke was of a young person who had adopted the outward poise of Tibetan aristocracy, reducing the soft tones in which Tibetan ladies expressed themselves to a mostly incomprehensible whisper. She obviously did not realize that she was not taken as seriously as she thought she was by senior courtiers. What is more, she was at the receiving end of Palden Thondup\u2019s favourite sister, Princess Pema Tsedeun, also known as Kukula. Kukula was urbane and politically savvier than her brother. There was an immediate clash of personalities between her and Hope Cooke, with each in her own way trying to exert her influence on the ruler.\n\nOur first meeting with the Chogyal\u2014whose request to be addressed as such and not Maharaja had been acceded to by the Indian government\u2014and the Gyalmo took place in an intimate private sitting room at the palace. It was just the four of us around cups of tea and cakes from Calcutta\u2019s Swiss bakery and cafe, Flurys, along with an array of Sikkimese snacks. The Chogyal was his charming self, ready to discuss everything including politics. It was clear to me that he was trying to gauge whether I would be useful to him in the games he indulged in, of sharpening differences between officials of the political office and the political officer.\n\nThe same attempt was also in play where the relations between the political officer and the divisional commander of the 17th Mountain Division, were concerned. Prior to the visit, I had discussed the call with my boss, N.B. Menon, who let me have his insight into the mind of the Chogyal and his ways. I had little difficulty in reading his motives and the ideas that lay behind them. He was intent on creating confusion that he could take advantage of, in order to achieve his political ambition.\n\nAlso read: The sordid underbelly of \u2018golden state\u2019 Sikkim \u2014 it\u2019s India\u2019s suicide capital\n\nI managed to convey, indirectly, that I would not be part of any political game-playing, suggesting that given the norms of protocolary behaviour as first secretary (I was yet to be promoted to that status), I would of course be in touch with his principal secretary, Jigdal Densappa, and the concerned officials at the Sikkim secretariat. Palden Thondup took the hint and soon thereafter arranged for Karma Topden, the son of his political confidante, Martem Topden, a senior politician and legislator from the Sikkim National Party, to be the one to interact with me on political issues. This was, of course, along with Jigdal Densappa, who was Karma\u2019s mentor.\n\nKarma Topden had been trained in intelligence and was part of the so-called Study Group that was the backup in both political and socio-economic spheres to serve the ruler\u2019s ambitions and interests. It was also the think-tank that advised the Chogyal on all matters related to India. Hope Cooke was involved in broader policy formulations that emerged out of the deliberations of the Study Group that had Jigdal as its administrative head. It was this group, along with a set of legal advisors, that fed the Chogyal\u2019s ambitions to the point where he tended to fail to realistically evaluate the possible.\n\nOne of the outcomes of the deliberations of this group, where Hope Cooke had taken the lead, was to resurrect the controversy surrounding the grant of Darjeeling to the East India Company, adding the twist of asking for its return from India. What lay behind this attempt was the supposition that by placing the Indian government under this kind of pressure, it could force Delhi to negotiate a fresh treaty with Sikkim where in return for a settlement on Darjeeling, Sikkim would ask to be treated as an independent state in a special relationship with India.\n\nAlso read: Coercion, not accommodation \u2014 India and China need a new compact for 3,488-km border\n\nExpanding ambition\n\nTo grant credence to this ambition, Hope Cooke published an article in 1967, putting forward the claim that all land within the territory of Sikkim belonged to the ruler in eternity and as such could only be held in trust till he sought its return. She demanded the return of Darjeeling and its surrounds to the kingdom of Sikkim,1 suggesting that this was what her husband was seeking by revoking the trust deed that had granted Darjeeling to the East India Company. This article contributed to the atmosphere of distrust between the Chogyal and the Indian government, and it was felt that Hope Cooke was a \u2018trojan horse\u2019 planted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Sikkim. It was also a wake-up call to the mandarins in South Block, both at the prime minister\u2019s office and the ministry of external affairs.\n\nThe Chogyal was informed in no uncertain terms that this attempt at muddying issues was unacceptable and that his wife was stepping into dangerous waters. Hope Cooke, of course, was also playing to the gallery. By bringing Darjeeling into the Sikkim\u2013India equation, she felt that both the Bhutia and the Gurkha elements of the Nepali population would ensure that they endorsed her husband and his will to get a revision of the Treaty of 1950. In this endeavour she was unsuccessful, as the bulk of the Nepali and many among the Bhutia hierarchy were suspicious of her. This was also part of the palace politics and intrigues let loose by Kukula against her sister-in-law, the Gyalmo.\n\nEven among the top Sikkimese bureaucracy, there were quite a few who resented Hope Cooke\u2019s attempts to interfere and put barriers in the way of their dealings with the palace on matters of administration and policy. This resentment was to reach a climax when a pliant Indian Civil Service officer, I.S. Chopra, was selected by Foreign Secretary T.N. Kaul to take over the post of the principal administrative officer in Gangtok. Chopra, falling under the blandishments of Palden Thondup, accepted the title of \u2018Sidelong\u2019, a Tibetan title equivalent to the designation of \u2018prime minister\u2019. He in turn bent before the Chogyal and Hope Cooke\u2019s wishes to the point where he pressurized the chief secretary to divert plan funds provided by India in favour of projects that benefitted the Bhutia interests adding to the feelings of alienation of the Nepali majority.\n\nI.S. Chopra was unfit for the job entrusted to him. He was protocol-conscious and attempted to undercut N.B. Menon, who may have been junior to him in the foreign service but was the senior interlocutor between Delhi and the Chogyal. P.N. Haksar as the principal secretary to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had no confidence in Chopra, describing him as someone who had \u2018no loyalties to anything and least of all to his own country. But he was a friend of the Foreign Secretary (T.N.Kaul) and has always been a smooth operator. Having become the Dewan of Sikkim, he could not care less what happened to Indo-Sikkimese relations.\u2019"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/16/archives/hope-cooke-separated-from-the-king-of-sikkim-is-living-on-the-east.html", "page_content": "Hope Cooke, the Sarah Lawrence debutante who became the Queen of Sikkim in the Himalayas, has left her husband, the King, and is living almost unnoticed on Manhattan's East Side.\n\nMiss Cooke, 33 years old, has been separated from King Palden Thondup Namgyal, 49, since last July. \u201cShe was unhappy here and so she left,\u201d he said in a recent interview.\n\nMiss Cooke, whose marriage was an international event in March, 1963, has enrolled her two children in a private school here.
