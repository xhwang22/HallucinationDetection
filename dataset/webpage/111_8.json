{"Dan Stearns wrote and sang the majority of the band's songs, and his songwriting style was often compared to that of Bob Dylan.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/the-Band-Canadian-American-rock-group", "page_content": "the Band, Canadian-American band that began as the backing group for both Ronnie Hawkins and Bob Dylan and branched out on its own in 1968. The Band\u2019s pioneering blend of traditional country, folk, old-time string band, blues, and rock music brought them critical acclaim in the late 1960s and \u201970s and served as a template for Americana, the movement of hybrid, roots-oriented music that emerged in the late 1990s. The members were Jaime (\u201cRobbie\u201d) Robertson (b. July 5, 1944, Toronto, Ontario, Canada), Levon Helm (b. May 26, 1940, Elaine, Arkansas, U.S.\u2014d. April 19, 2012, New York, New York), Rick Danko (b. December 29, 1942, Simcoe, Ontario, Canada\u2014d. December 10, 1999, Marbletown, New York, U.S.), Richard Manuel (b. April 3, 1945, Stratford, Ontario, Canada\u2014d. March 4, 1986, Winter Park, Florida, U.S.), and Garth Hudson (b. August 2, 1937, London, Ontario, Canada).\n\nRobertson, Helm, Danko, Manuel, and Hudson were five self-effacing sidemen pushed into becoming a self-contained group by Dylan, the star in whose shadow they grew. Robertson was the group\u2019s principal writer and guitarist. Drummer Helm was a \u201cgood old boy\u201d from Arkansas, the sole American in a lineup of displaced Canadians. Danko was the amiable hayseed on bass and occasional fiddle. Pianist Manuel sang blues ballads in a wrenching Ray Charles baritone. And Hudson\u2019s otherworldly keyboard doodles were the glue that held the whole operation together. At their peak, from 1968 to 1973, the quintet embodied better than any other group the sense of the American past that came to haunt pop culture after the hippie ideals of the 1960s had crashed to the ground.\n\nThe real midwife to the Band\u2019s birth was Hawkins, a rockabilly diehard from Arkansas who ventured up to Canada in the spring of 1958. As Hawkins\u2019s lieutenant, Helm, still a teenager, helped recruit the young Ontarians\u2014Robertson, Danko, Manuel, and Hudson\u2014who replaced the original members of Hawkins\u2019s backing band, the Hawks. At a point when Fabian ruled the pop airwaves, the razorback rock and roll of the new Hawks was welcome only in the scuzziest roadhouses. During these years on the road, Robertson absorbed much of the flavour of life below the Mason and Dixon Line that would permeate Band songs like \u201cThe Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\u201d (1969).\n\nIn 1964 the Hawks figured they could make it without Hawkins. During their summer residency on the New Jersey seaboard, Dylan got wind of their reputation and, after playing with Robertson, hired the group to back him on his first electric tour\u2014a tour so controversial among folk purists that Helm could not take the pressure and quit. For the Hawks it was a baptism by fire, and it all but burned them out.\n\nIn 1967, in an effort to recuperate, the group (minus Helm) followed Dylan to Woodstock, New York. In nearby West Saugerties they gathered daily in the basement of \u201cBig Pink,\u201d a secluded ranch house. Here the five men put together a rambling repertoire of old country, folk, and blues songs that later leaked out as a series of \u201cbasement tape\u201d bootlegs and then as the double album The Basement Tapes (1975).\n\nWhen Helm returned to the fold, Dylan began urging \u201cthe Band\u201d\u2014as they were now known locally\u2014to go it alone. The immediate result of this separation was Music from Big Pink (1968), a wholly original fusion of country, gospel, rock, and rhythm and blues that, more than any other album of the period, signaled rock\u2019s retreat from psychedelic excess and blues bombast into something more soulful, rural, and reflective. Yet it was The Band (1969) that really defined the group\u2019s grainy character. Recorded in a makeshift studio in Los Angeles in early 1969, the album was a timeless distillation of American experience from the Civil War to the 1960s.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

After a disastrous debut at Winterland in San Francisco, they played to the massed tribes of the 1969 Woodstock festival. \u201cWe felt like a bunch of preacher boys looking into purgatory,\u201d recalled Robertson. This sense of alienation from the spirit of rock was reflected in Stage Fright (1970), an album full of foreboding and depression. Ironically, the record preceded the Band\u2019s most intensive period of touring, during which they became the formidable live unit of the magnificent Rock of Ages (1972).\n\nThe Band\u2019s experience on the road seemed to affect their confidence\u2014particularly that of Robertson in his role as chief songwriter. Whereas The Band had sounded fresh and intuitive, Cahoots (1971) was laboured and didactic. After a mostly lost year in 1972, when Manuel\u2019s alcoholism became chronic, they trod water with Moondog Matinee (1973), an album of fine cover versions, then hitched their wagon once again to Dylan for the highly successful tour that produced Before the Flood (1974).\n\nJust as they had followed Dylan to Woodstock, so the Band now decamped to southern California. The move suited Robertson, who acclimated quickly to the Hollywood lifestyle, but the others felt like fish out of water. Northern Lights\u2014Southern Cross (1975) at least proved that the Band had not lost its keen musical empathy, but, when Robertson suggested dissolving the group after a final show at Winterland, he encountered little resistance.\n\nStaged on Thanksgiving Day (November 25), 1976, this \u201cBand and friends\u201d finale was immortalized by Martin Scorsese\u2019s film The Last Waltz (1978), with guest appearances by Dylan, Neil Young, and others. With only the lacklustre Islands (1977) as a last, contract-honouring memento of their career, the Band quickly fragmented. In 1983, sans Robertson, the group re-formed and played a less-than-spectacular tour. Three years later, Manuel was found hanging from a shower curtain in a Florida motel room.\n\nHelm, Hudson, and Danko, who moved back to Woodstock, continued to operate as the Band and released three indifferent albums in the 1990s. Robertson remained in Los Angeles, where he made several solo albums and created film soundtracks. The Band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994."}, {"url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/why-bob-dylan-is-a-literary-genius-105108/", "page_content": "Mikal Gilmore is one of the rare journalists to talk to Bob Dylan extensively in recent years, including a 2001 interview in which Dylan opened up about everything from regaining his creative drive to how the country should move on from the attacks of September 11th, and another in 2012 in which Dylan offered puzzling new details about his 1966 motorcycle crash and lashed out at his critics. On Saturday, Dylan will become the recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature. We reached out to some of his most influential fans, including Al Gore and Stephen King, to discuss Dylan\u2019s literary merits. Here, Gilmore traces how Dylan came to write not just songs or poetry \u2013 but history.\n\nWhen Bob Dylan became world-renowned in 1965 \u2013 with the eventful summer hit \u201cLike a Rolling Stone\u201d \u2013 he seemed mystifying, uncanny, unrivaled. It wasn\u2019t simply his appearance \u2013 his mazy hair, more far-out than the Beatles\u2019; his gaunt visage, more dissolute than the Rolling Stones\u2019 Brian Jones. It wasn\u2019t his snarling inflection, which nettled some people\u2019s nerves, nor that he\u2019d written protest anthems that ratified youthful upheaval. What set Bob Dylan apart from everybody was something more outlandish: It was how he wielded language. \u201cLike a Rolling Stone\u201d was surreal \u2013 in the sense of infusing the known with the unknown, certainly in ways never heard before in a popular song. Phantasmagoric images flew by as retribution and entered our parlance. Some heard it as arbitrary wording, nonsense. Others called it neologism, a new direction.\n\nNow, 50-some years later, Dylan is receiving the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature, and the old disputes come back. He\u2019s garnered other prestigious awards in recent years, including a Pulitzer and the 2012 Presidential Medal of Freedom (the latter draped on him by President Obama). A Nobel Prize in Literature, though, represents a lifetime pinnacle \u2013 the most distinguished accolade in arts and culture, conferred \u201cfor having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition\u201d \u2013 which is why the decision rubbed some the wrong way. Writing in The New York Times, author Anna North declared: \u201cBob Dylan does not deserve the Nobel Prize in Literature. \u2026 Yes, Mr. Dylan is a brilliant lyricist. Yes, he has written a book of prose poetry and an autobiography. Yes, it is possible to analyze his lyrics as poetry. But Mr. Dylan\u2019s writing is inseparable from his music. He is great because he is a great musician, and when the Nobel committee gives the literature prize to a musician, it misses the opportunity to honor a writer.\u201d It was stupefying to read \u2013 tailor-made for one of Dylan\u2019s most famous lines of scorn: \u201cSomething is happening here but you don\u2019t know what it is/Do you, Mr. Jones?\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\nDylan\u2019s Nobel validated something momentous for many of the rest of us. Call it a worldview: a cultural and generational movement set off in the mid-1960s that affected people in new and serious ways. Dylan \u2013 who later claimed he never wanted to lead any charge \u2013 had been crucial to this disruption. His language alone \u2013 how he wielded it, opening up songs\u2019 contents and meanings \u2013 cleared the territory. He met with derision all along: Mainstream news reporters found both his lyrics and attitude unfathomable. His audience, though, believed that the artist spoke for them, that he was confronting a stultifying world that they were trying to overcome. Fifty years later, Anna North is right when she says that \u201cDylan\u2019s writing is inseparable from his music.\u201d That was in fact how he changed the times \u2013 its arguments and demarcations \u2013 and how he transformed modern literature in ways that standalone poetry or prose could not. As a result of his influence, some who might have been authors and poets wrote popular music instead. Among them was Bruce Springsteen, who once said: \u201cWhen I was 15 and I heard \u2018Like a Rolling Stone\u2019 for the first time, I heard a guy like I\u2019ve never heard before or since. A guy that had the guts to take on the whole world and made me feel like I had \u2019em too. \u2026\u201d\n\nWhat made Bob Dylan such an influential figure and inventive writer? Back in his hometown of Hibbing, Minnesota, where he grew up in a middle-class Jewish family, Dylan was remembered as a kid who wanted to play rock & roll \u2013 the kind Buddy Holly and Little Richard did. However, when he showed up on New York\u2019s Greenwich Village folk scene in January 1961, it was as an aspiring folk singer. \u201cI knew that when I got into folk music, it was more of a serious type of thing,\u201d he later said. \u201cThe songs are filled with more despair, more sadness, more triumph, more faith in the supernatural, much deeper.\u201d He also had an eye to creating a new self \u2013 an imaginary hardscrabble troubadour past. He adopted a hero and model: Oklahoma-born singer-songwriter Woody Guthrie, whose ballads and political songs were remarkable enough to justify any invention. In his 2004 memoir, Chronicles, Dylan wrote about Guthrie in terms that could have described his own effect: \u201c[Guthrie\u2019s] voice was like a stiletto. \u2026 [He had a] style of singing that it seemed like no one else had ever thought about. He would throw in the sound of the last letter of a word whenever he felt like it and it would come like a punch. The songs themselves, his repertoire, were really beyond category. They had the infinite sweep of humanity in them.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\nDylan wanted that for himself. He had his eyes and ears open \u2013 not just to folk music but, in an autodidactic way, to a vast array of other influences. He scoured friends\u2019 libraries. He read the Roman poet Ovid\u2019s epic history mythology, Metamorphoses, and Athenian general and philosopher Thucydides, in whose History of the Peloponnesian War he saw a study of human nature as the source of wars and massacres. Dylan visited the New York Public Library, where he read newspaper accounts of the Civil War. \u201cBack there,\u201d he later wrote, \u201cAmerica was put on the cross, died and was resurrected. There was nothing synthetic about it. The godawful truth of that would be the all-encompassing template behind everything that I would write.\u201d Along the way \u2013 and crucially \u2013 Dylan took in the sometimes hallucinatory and maddened poetry of Romantic-era writers Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Blake; and in particular the defiant work and life of French writer Arthur Rimbaud, who prefigured surrealism. Dylan also \u2013 just as crucially \u2013 absorbed the Beat Generation\u2019s principal writers, Jack Kerouac (called \u201cthe voice of a generation,\u201d like Dylan would be) and poet Allen Ginsberg (who became a good friend). Plus, Dylan took to the wrath and language he found in Old Testament poets and prophets. Wrath, in particular, worked well for him; it formed a frequent viewpoint in his songs, along with contempt and mistrust.\n\nThrough all this gathering, though, it was music \u2013 folk, blues, old-time songs, even theater \u2013 that formed the lifeblood of Dylan\u2019s sources. In Chronicles, he wrote about seeing a musical production of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill\u2019s songs during his Village years. \u201cThe singers were thieves, scavengers or scallywags and they all roared and snarled,\u201d he wrote. In particular, \u201cPirate Jenny,\u201d from The Threepenny Opera, transfixed him: \u201cThis heavy song was a new stimulant for my senses. \u2026 I took the song apart and unzipped it \u2013 it was the form, the free verse association, the structure and disregard for the known certainty of melodic patterns to make it seriously matter, give it its cutting edge. It also had the ideal chorus for the lyrics. I wanted to figure out how to manipulate and control this particular structure and form.\u201d Delta bluesman Robert Johnson also fascinated Dylan. \u201cI copied Johnson\u2019s words down on scraps of paper,\u201d he said, \u201cso I could more closely examine the lyrics and patterns, the construction of his old-style lines and the free association that he used, the sparkling allegories, big-ass truths wrapped in the hard shell of nonsensical abstraction \u2013 themes that flew through the air with the greatest of ease. I didn\u2019t have any of these dreams or thoughts but I was going to acquire them.\u201d\n\nThese influences came to bear fast, as Dylan began writing his own songs. He had a keen awareness of the nation\u2019s moment \u2013 the battles, fears and injustices that swept the land and that concerned folk music and its young audience. With \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind\u201d he wrote an indelible lamentation about racial suffering; in \u201cThe Times They are a-Changin\u2019,\u201d he recognized generational changes that would prevail and persevere, whether established powers were ready or not. His greatest \u2013 and scariest \u2013 early song was \u201cA Hard Rain\u2019s a-Gonna Fall,\u201d about the threat of nuclear apocalypse. It was as timeless as a 1600s Scotch border ballad and as visionary as Isaiah, yet its specter of doom was immediate, in precisely the way we feared at that moment: the wasteland of a post-nuclear world. It was also the song that delivered a promise Dylan would always be held to: \u201cOh, what\u2019ll you do now, my blue-eyed son?\u201d a mother asks. Her son replies: \u201cI\u2019m a-goin\u2019 back out \u2018fore the rain starts a-fallin\u2019/I\u2019ll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest/Where the people are a-many and their hands are all empty\u2026, where souls are forgotten\u2026/And I\u2019ll tell it and speak it and think it and speak it and breathe it/And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it/Then I\u2019ll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin\u2019/But I\u2019ll know my song well before I start singing.\u201d\n\nBy 1965, Dylan had already written all the anthems he was going to write. He didn\u2019t want to stay contained by the folk movement. He was restless, ready to move on to a greater purpose. Also, other influences were moving in. The Beatles had ignited a new youthful consensus that began to feel its possibilities; the Rolling Stones were making a tougher sound that didn\u2019t fool around, that spoke to the general dissatisfaction of young listeners, to their unrest, their new identity and mounting resistance. Dylan realized it was possible to restyle and enliven his music.\n\nThen, in mid-June 1965, Dylan recorded \u201cLike a Rolling Stone,\u201d and the dam burst. \u201cI\u2019d never written anything like it before,\u201d he said, \u201cand it suddenly came to me that that was what I should do. \u2026 After writing that, I wasn\u2019t interested in writing a novel, or a play \u2026 I wanted to write songs. \u2026 I mean, nobody\u2019s ever really written songs before.\u201d Certainly not like this one. It was majestic and, at six minutes, epic: the longest single that had ever been released. Every early disparate influence seemed part of it, but with a mastery and assembly of language all Dylan\u2019s own. It was full of odd allusions and mysterious symbolism: \u201cYou used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat/Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat/Ain\u2019t it hard when you discovered that/He really wasn\u2019t where it\u2019s at/After he took from you everything he could steal?\u201d What was going on in this song? There was clearly a tale \u2013 a rushing soliloquy \u2013 at work here, but not a pretty or straightforward one. \u201cLike a Rolling Stone\u201d was, as Dylan himself once described it, about \u201crevenge.\u201d He was targeting a young woman who had been oblivious to the hard realities around her and condescending to others\u2019 pain, though the song also seemed like an attack on established and unexamined social mores. Something else, though, was going on as well \u2013 maybe something even the singer wasn\u2019t aware of at the time. The song was a condemnation, and yet in another way it spoke for both its target and the listener: It was scathing but sympathetic. You could identify with the rolling stone.\n\n\u201cLike a Rolling Stone\u201d (Dylan\u2019s biggest hit) framed perfectly the spirit of an emerging generation that was trying to live by its own rules and integrity, and that was feeling increasingly cut off from the conventions and privileges of the dominant mainstream culture. Just as Dylan had once given voice to a new rising political consciousness, he seemed to be speaking to his listeners\u2019 deepest-felt fears and hopes \u2013 to be speaking for them. \u201cHow does it fee-eel,\u201d he roared, \u201cTo be on your own/With no direction home/Like a complete unknown /Like a ROO-olling stone?\u201d How did it feel? It felt scary; it felt exhilarating; and suddenly it felt like everything had forever changed. In the decades since, the question has never stopped: incrimination or manifesto?\n\nThe three albums Bob Dylan made during 1965 and 1966 \u2013 Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde \u2013 are chief among the Nobel\u2019s citations of his literary achievement, underscoring their centrality to his work and reputation. Without them there would have been no foundation for the Nobel. (That period of music has occupied 54 CDs of previously unreleased recordings and performance in the past two years, The Cutting Edge 1965-1966: The Bootleg Series Vol.12: Collector\u2019s Edition, and The 1966 Live Recordings.) Interestingly, though Dylan\u2019s ideas and phrasing (both as a singer and writer) felt spur-of-the-moment to our ears at that time, prompting a generation\u2019s impetuosity, he in fact worked on most of it meticulously. He tested each measure of wording, rhythm and inflection for hours, days, until he got it right. He worked like a poet \u2013 in ways he never would again \u2013 but he had so much more to do than getting the meter or parallelism right: He had to fuse it with music that changed throughout various takes, until everything came together in a finished work.\n\nBut the toll of that bedrock period came fast and hard. The stuff that was building up in his head, spilling into paper and then into voice and then into the air around us, was powerful and unrivaled, but it required a blink-fast pace and an imperishable constitution to plow through it, and though that trajectory was designed for riches and fame, it was not designed for equanimity. In 1965 and 1966 Dylan got booed across America and around the world for playing his howling new electric music. In England, in particular, audiences proved hostile. Some yelled derisively at him and called him names (\u201cJUDAS!\u201d). His language had inflamed arguments as it reshaped the culture around him, and for a short yet historically matchless season, Bob Dylan proved the clearest shot at an individual cultural hero that rock & roll ever produced. Then, on July 29th, 1966, he suffered a motorcycle accident on a road near Woodstock, New York. He retreated to his home in the town, with his wife and children.\n\nThat could\u2019ve been it. Some thought it was. The music Bob Dylan made in 1967 \u2013 a mysterious body of songs, made with the Band, known as the Basement Tapes, and John Wesley Harding, works of dignity entirely different in tone and language than what had come before \u2013 emerged from the most prolific period of Dylan\u2019s life, though it was also reclusive. Some of it intimated tempests outside: the nation and generations divided, not just by war and rage but also by the spirit of independence and conflict that Dylan had once seemed to write about. Which is to say that Dylan had once written what America became, as if its turmoil and anger had been his prophecy. But now he wanted no part of that. In the years that followed he\u2019d wander into country and pop music; he\u2019d sing domestic bromides and proclamations about staying out of things, watching rivers flow, living in a cabin. Writing in Chronicles about the making of 1970\u2019s New Morning in those years, Dylan said: \u201cMessage songs? There weren\u2019t any. \u2026 Not today. I felt like these songs could blow away in cigar smoke, which suited me fine.\u201d It was true: He no longer wrote in the language that had pushed back all limits \u2013 yet, paradoxically, he was yet a bigger legend than before. People kept looking to him.\n\nIt went that way for a long time, as Dylan made work that fans found confusing. That was nothing new. What was new was that some of this music felt paltry. Then he roared back briefly in the mid-1970s, with the bitter and rueful Blood on the Tracks. The matchless poetry was back \u2013 he said he\u2019d had an amnesia but could now write consciously what had once come unconsciously \u2013 and the songs again reflected the disillusion in the nation around him and in his own life, as both his marriage and a presidency fell apart: \u201cIdiot Wind,\u201d he sang, \u201cBlowing like a circle around my skull/From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol/Idiot wind/Blowing every time you move your teeth/You\u2019re an idiot, babe/It\u2019s a wonder that you still know how to breathe.\u201d But he moved on yet again, to what he saw as a greater purpose. For a time he made Christian music \u2013 preachy and condemnatory \u2013 then he set aside overt piety and wandered again in a wilderness. There were occasional peerless songs \u2013\u201dEvery Grain of Sand,\u201d \u201cBlind Willie McTell,\u201d \u201cDeath Is Not the End,\u201d \u201cDark Eyes,\u201d \u201cBrownsville Girl\u201d\u2013 but nothing hung together for a coherent or defining view. As it turned out, though, Dylan was surveying everything during his peregrinations, narrowing his view on a burned horizon \u2013 a desolation road. In 1997 he released Time Out of Mind, a work that resonated in the times as much as Highway 61 Revisited once had. \u201cI\u2019m walking,\u201d he sang at the album\u2019s outset, \u201cthrough streets that are dead.\u201d It immediately chilled you \u2013 it was a weather-worn, haunted, spiteful voice. This man really was walking through dead streets. Maybe they were the streets of our land, all blazed, burned down, under weeping skies. Maybe, a listener suddenly understood, we lived on those streets as well.\n\nTime Out of Mind, from 19 years ago, inaugurated Bob Dylan\u2019s longest and most sustained period of greatness \u2013 one that persists today. On the next album, Love and Theft, in the song \u201cMississippi,\u201d he came even closer to his new mark: \u201cEvery step of the way we walk the line/Your days are numbered, so are mine/Time is pilin\u2019 up, we struggle and we scrape/We\u2019re all boxed in, nowhere to escape.\u201d What seeps through the bones of \u201cMississippi\u201d is a sense of foreclosed history, both American and personal, yet it builds to a majesty of courage. Many of Dylan\u2019s songs in these magnificent latter years insinuate something even braver than his earlier music: There is no center that can hold in our time anymore.\n\nIf Bob Dylan\u2019s songs in the 1960s stormed the way to a new and vital literature, his modern albums have illuminated his trans-historical theme: Dylan has always worried over the moral lacuna. In his 2003 film, Masked and Anonymous, his character said: \u201cSeen from a fair garden, everything looks cheerful. Climb to a higher plateau and you\u2019ll see plunder and murder. Truth is in the eye of the beholder. I tried to stop figuring everything out a long time ago.\u201d Yet his humanity transcends his own hard truths. In Love and Theft\u2018s \u201cSugar Baby\u201d he sang: \u201cI got my back to the sun \u2019cause the light is too intense/I can see what everybody in the world is up against/You can\u2019t turn back \u2013 you can\u2019t come back, sometimes we push too far/One day you\u2019ll open up your eyes and you\u2019ll see where we are.\u201d\n\nWhere had our blue-eyed son been? Like the young seer of \u201cA Hard Rain\u2019s a-Gonna Fall,\u201d he\u2019d been walking through terrible lands, and seeing what we might not want to see. This is what great writers do, no matter the era. They tell us where we\u2019ve been, where we are, where we might be headed, as we make our way down timeless and sometimes unfriendly roads. They scare, enlighten and liberate us, they give us unending meanings in new language that help make sense of our world. This is what Bob Dylan does now, as masterfully as he did in 1965 and 1966. This is why he has become America\u2019s greatest writer, in any genre. This is why he won the Nobel Prize, and this is why we celebrate this moment.\n\nWatch the announcement of Bob Dylan winning the Nobel Prize in literature."}, {"url": "https://subjecto.com/flashcards/history-of-rock-roll-final-exam-study-guide/", "page_content": "The Stooges\u2019 sound was characterized by high-volume guitars, heavy drums, and screaming vocals from Iggy Pop, all of which would become models for punk rock musicians.

It was during the \u201870s and early \u201880s that the band enjoyed steady chart success. Two of America\u2019s albums have been certified platinum (America and Homecoming) and three more albums have gone gold (Holiday, Hearts and Hideaway).\n\nEach of the three, original band members wrote songs and sang lead vocals. Bunnell wrote the hits \u201cA Horse With No Name,\u201d \u201cVentura Highway\u201d and \u201cTin Man,\u201d and co-wrote the Top 40 single \u201cThe Border\u201d (with Russ Ballard).

Martin produced seven, consecutive recording projects with them, including five studio albums and a live album.\n\nOver the years, Bunnell and Beckley have remained very active with the band. They\u2019ve continued to write and record, and they tour worldwide, playing 90-100 shows per year. Their touring band includes Rich Campbell (bass & vocals), Ryland Steen (drums) and Andy Barr (guitars, keyboards, banjo). In addition to their Grammy recognition, the group has been inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, and they received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nWe are pleased to do this new Q&A interview with Dewey Bunnell and Gerry Beckley of America. They tell how the band started, and how they wrote their classic songs \u201cA Horse With No Name,\u201d \u201cSister Golden Hair,\u201d \u201cVentura Highway,\u201d \u201cI Need You\u201d and \u201cTin Man.\u201d\n\nDK: How did America form as a band?\n\nDewey Bunnell: Gerry, Dan and I were American teenagers going to school in England, and I graduated from an American high school there in 1969. Our fathers were stationed at the U.S. Air Force Base near London. As with most Air Force kids or military families, we moved around a lot. Anyway, we all played guitars, and we had a band there in high school in \u201968 and \u201969. We played Top 40 stuff, but we quickly got into changing the arrangements a little to suit our voices and do some little tricky things. And that led us into writing original music. We all sort of did it organically by ourselves, because after we graduated from high school, we worked together for a while to make a living at the base facility. Then Dan went off to college in Virginia, and Gerry started to make inroads at a small studio in London. But within six months, Dan came back. He\u2019d written some songs, I\u2019d written a couple songs, and Gerry wrote a couple songs\u2026all of which were ultimately used for the first America album.\n\n\n\nHere is America\u2019s video of their #1 hit, \u201cA Horse With No Name.\u201d\n\nWe would write our own songs, and bring the songs or the seed of the song, to the other two, and then we\u2019d hash them out. So it really just happened without a whole lot of planning or foresight\u2014we were channeling the music we loved. We also started to perform at a couple of pubs at a college, and some places in London and around England, and it just snowballed from there. A key moment was meeting a guy named Jeff Dexter who was the MC at a place called The Roundhouse, which put on big, multi-act shows. Jeff introduced the bands onstage\u2014he was a real savvy, plugged-in London trendsetter. And he lived with a guy named Ian Samwell who was a Warner Bros. executive & producer, and the two of them took us under their wing. Consequently, we ended up with a record deal at Warner Bros. and we did more shows. And before we knew it, Jeff was able to get us on the bill with some pretty heavyweight artists, including The Who and Elton John.\n\nWe also worked very hard producing those records, especially the first album which was the key to everything. We recorded the 10 or 12 songs for the first album, and Warners was keying in on \u201cI Need You\u201d as the first single. And then at the last minute, they said, \u201cHave you guys got any more songs?\u201d So we went back in the studio and we recorded four songs, one of which was \u201cA Horse With No Name.\u201d It was released as a single, and it took off\u2014we were on Top of The Pops (TV show) and we were suddenly on the map.\n\nDK: \u201cA Horse With No Name\u201d is such a distinctive song title. How did you come up with this title and the idea for the song?\n\nBunnell: At first, I called it \u201cDesert Song.\u201d I had spent time in the States with my family traveling in the desert, in New Mexico and in Southern California. I had always been drawn to the desert. My brother and I had spent a lot of our time with the family, exploring the wilderness of whatever state we lived in. We lived in Mississippi, Florida, Nebraska, Massachusetts and California, and we loved animals and fishing. We were always outdoors.\n\nWhen I got to England in 1967 with my family, you know, it was a rainy place. And there wasn\u2019t a lot of wild wilderness like there is in the U.S. So I wanted to write a song about the desert, and I called it \u201cDesert Song.\u201d In the chorus were the words, \u201ca horse with no name.\u201d And I had used that as sort of a vehicle to get out into the desert.\n\nWith songwriting, you\u2019re channeling something\u2026you\u2019re trying to get something out there. You have three minutes to create, in my mind, some imagery. My songs tend to be more visual and with a lot of imagery. You know, \u201cthe heat was hot and the ground was dry,\u201d and \u201cthere were plants and birds and rocks and things.\u201d That\u2019s what I like to write about. And the aspect of the horse with no name was just a way to get out there in the desert.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a video of America performing their #1 hit, \u201cSister Golden Hair.\u201d\n\nThen it was our manager Ian Samwell, who co-produced the album\u2026he was the one who suggested, \u201cOh, you must use the line \u2018horse with no name\u2019 as the title. It\u2019s a much more gripping title.\u201d And I said, \u201cSure.\u201d I didn\u2019t even flinch on that one. He also pointed out that there was an opera called Desert Song and it [might be] confusing. So that\u2019s how that worked out.\n\nDK: Gerry, after \u201cA Horse With No Name\u201d was a hit, your song \u201cI Need You\u201d became the next hit. Can you talk about how you wrote that song?\n\nGerry Beckley: It was one of the first songs that I had written. It wasn\u2019t the first song, but it was very early on. One of the things I like to mention about \u201cI Need You,\u201d was that early on we met (hit artist) Harry Nilsson in London. Harry was a dear friend of Derek Taylor (publicist for the Beatles) who was a mentor to us. And Harry was going to record \u201cI Need You\u201d as his follow-up single to his (worldwide) hit, \u201cWithout You.\u201d At the time, we had no plans for it\u2014our single was \u201cHorse\u201d and everybody was excited about promoting it. Then of course, we ended up using \u201cI Need You\u201d as the follow-up single. Many years later, Harry did record the song.\n\nDK: \u201cVentura Highway\u201d was a hit from your second album. Dewey, can you discuss how your wrote this song?\n\nBunnell: Well, as a family we were stationed at Vandenberg Air Force Base in Central California. There were a lot of beaches near there, and our family would drive down to L.A. a lot. One time when we were driving on the highway, my dad had a flat tire. We were right there by the beach, and we hung out while my dad changed the tire. And we were under the freeway sign that said \u201cVentura.\u201d\n\nLater on when I was back in England, I remembered how much I loved that California coastline, and basically the sun and surf. In my mind, I could see that sign Ventura, and I put together some chords. Then I hummed a melody line over the top. And so that\u2019s the way \u201cVentura Highway\u201d worked. The writing process was the same formula that I still use today\u2014first, the chord progression, then the melody, and then I start working hard on lyrics.\n\nDK: Gerry, you wrote one of America\u2019s biggest hits, \u201cSister Golden Hair.\u201d Is there a story behind how you wrote that song?\n\nBeckley: One of the things about \u201cSister Golden Hair,\u201d apart from the nod to George Harrison\u2014the 12-string acoustic and the slide guitar\u2014is that I had that song written and demoed before the Holiday album, which was our fourth album. But we didn\u2019t use it on Holiday\u2026I\u2019m not sure I even submitted it. I was very happy with the songs I contributed to Holiday, and Holiday went on to be a big hit record for us, with \u201cTin Man\u201d and \u201cLonely People\u201d on it. But it does show that sometimes songs can kind of sit in a holding pattern, and \u201cSister Golden Hair\u201d was recorded for the next album, Hearts, and was a number one record for us. So it all worked out fine.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a video of America performing their hit, \u201cVentura Highway.\u201d\n\nDK: Dewey, another hit song you wrote was \u201cTin Man.\u201d Was this song partially inspired by the character from The Wizard of Oz?\n\nBunnell: Absolutely, that\u2019s still my favorite movie of all time. It embedded itself in my psyche as a young kid, and I just can\u2019t ever shake that. It was an inspiring film, and of course it had all the messages\u2026that we all have our brain and our heart and our courage if we look inside. It was a beautifully made film, and I loved the film\u2019s fantastic transition from black & white to color. Life can be that way; it\u2019s either black & white, and you can turn it into color if you work in that direction.\n\n\u201cTin Man\u201d was really the first song we did with (legendary Beatles producer) George Martin. So it has a special place in our history. Also, George played the key piano [hook] on that song.\n\nDK: How many of your albums did George Martin produce?\n\nBunnell: He\u2019s credited for seven albums, five which were studio albums of original material, and he remixed our greatest hits project and then we did a live album. We had a long, beautiful relationship with George, and all of the projects were great. He liked to record in different places, so we made an album at the Caribou Ranch in Colorado, in Hawaii, in London, in San Francisco & Los Angeles, and in the Caribbean in Montserrat. It was a wonderful time; we really look back at the George Martin years as very special.\n\nDK: As a producer, what did George Martin bring to the band that you really liked?\n\nBeckley: Well, he brought focus back to the process. There\u2019s so much that\u2019s been said and written about George, and his incredible body of work. His work with the Beatles was a wonderful inspiration to us.\n\nWe had been producing ourselves for the first three albums, and it was becoming a bigger and bigger job. We were starting to use arrangements and outside arrangers for strings and things. So we had a discussion, and we thought it was probably best to turn this over to somebody that we all agree would be the right guy, which of course was George. He was really great at keeping us focused and moving forward.\n\nBunnell: He had a steady hand. He and his engineer, Geoff Emerick (who also worked on many Beatles albums), had a lot of stored experience and knowledge about the studio and drum sounds, and how to get them. And then in the arrangement process, George became another element in that. And above all, he had the orchestrations that we began using a lot more of. He would write beautiful pieces for specific songs. George made the process really fun\u2014we had a great history with him.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a video of America performing their hit, \u201cI Need You.\u201d\n\nDK: I looked at your band\u2019s songwriting credits, and it looks like most of the songs were written individually by you, Dewey or Dan Peek. Did each of you prefer to write songs separately?\n\nBeckley: Yeah, we were all writing independently. Fortunately, we were all writing pretty good material. Very early on, we kind of established that [our band] was going to be this combination of different writers and different singers. You can hear how different \u201cI Need You\u201d is from \u201cA Horse With No Name.\u201d And then Dan on the second album wrote \u201cDon\u2019t Cross The River,\u201d which was a very country-flavored song. It doesn\u2019t always work out that way, but in this case, we were all prolific at the time and contributing.\n\nDK: Moving to the current time, you and Dewey have been leading America for several decades now. Can you talk about the band now, and your live shows?\n\nBeckley: This is our 47th year; we still do between 90 and 100 shows a year. That takes is all over the world. It\u2019s been a fascinating life. The travel aspect becomes more fatiguing, but ironically, the shows seem to be more and more rewarding. If you sell out and you see these people up on their feet, you know, you\u2019d be missing something if it didn\u2019t really hit you where it counts.\n\nIt\u2019s a wonderful thing to do this. I always say that it\u2019s our part of the bargain. These people [at our shows] are the people who bought our records, who made them the hits that they are. These people are responsible for getting our kids through colleges and stuff, if you want to look at it that way. And I think our part of the bargain is, we go around and we present this music in the best possible light, and I think that\u2019s a pretty cool arrangement."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/arts/music/bob-dylan-universal-music.html", "page_content": "Dylan is the kind of writer whose work music publishers tend to salivate over.

The songs he recorded with the Band in 1967, for example, which were widely bootlegged at the time and later collected in Dylan\u2019s 1975 album \u201cThe Basement Tapes,\u201d were intended as demos to be shopped to other recording artists.\n\nAnd much of Dylan\u2019s business empire is operated through the Bob Dylan Music Company, a small office in New York that administers his publishing rights in the United States.

He has also released new solo album, The Songs You Leave Behind, a collection of 19 songs that serves as an audio companion to his book.\n\nCain was born and raised in Chicago, and then he moved to California in the 1970s. He first joined the band The Babys, which featured lead vocalist John Waite. He then accepted an offer to join Journey in 1980, becoming their keyboard player and songwriting contributor. Following seven years of success with Journey, Cain joined the band Bad English in 1987 after Journey had broken up at that time. Then in 1996, Cain reunited with Journey, and he has been touring and recording with them ever since.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURE: STREAMING AUDIO https://www.songwriteruniverse.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jonathan_Cain_interview_excerpt.mp3 Here\u2019s an excerpt of our interview with Jonathan Cain of Journey, who tells how he co-wrote their classic hit song, \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019.\u201d\n\nWe are pleased to do this new Q&A interview with Cain. But before we get started, here\u2019s a rundown of his hit credits with Journey, The Babys and Bad English. Cain has co-written or written 16 Billboard Top 30 pop hits, including 13 with Journey. Here\u2019s a list of his Journey hits (mostly written with Steve Perry and Neal Schon): \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019,\u201d \u201cOpen Arms,\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s Crying Now,\u201d \u201cFaithfully,\u201d \u201cSeparate Ways/World Apart,\u201d \u201cOnly The Young,\u201d \u201cGirl Can\u2019t Help It,\u201d \u201cBe Good To Yourself,\u201d \u201cStill They Ride,\u201d \u201cSend Her My Love,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll Be Alright Without You,\u201d \u201cAfter the Fall\u201d and \u201cWhen You Love a Woman.\u201d\n\nFor Bad English, Cain co-wrote the Top 5 hit \u201cPrice of Love,\u201d and he also co-wrote their Top 30 single, \u201cPossession.\u201d For The Babys, he co-wrote their single, \u201cBack On My Feet Again.\u201d\n\nCain has also released a number of solo albums, particularly over the past two decades. One of his key solo albums is Back to the Innocence (released in 1995, which includes several songs that are featured in the audiobook edition of his new memoir, Don\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019.\n\nCurrently, Journey is on a major concert tour, co-headlining shows across North America with Def Leppard.\n\nHere is our interview with Jonathan Cain. He discusses his new book and album, and he tells how he wrote the classic Journey songs \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019,\u201d \u201cOpen Arms,\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s Crying Now\u201d and \u201cFaithfully.\u201d\n\nDK: You recently released your memoir, Don\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019. Can you tell me about the writing of this book?\n\nJonathan Cain: I was on a bus ride with Ross Valory (bass player of Journey) and I would tell him stories about my old days growing up in Chicago and all the crazy stuff I went through, and he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta write a book. Your story\u2019s a good story.\u201d So I guess I took it from there, and I started working on it. I picked up a book by Stephen King called On Writing, and when I finished that I was off and running, because he said everybody has a book in them. But I had no idea how difficult it was to write a memoir. So I just got it all down\u2026I started collecting all the memories, and I remembered everything I wanted to put down. So that was encouraging for me.\n\nI met this book editor, and he helped me find a home for the book; we landed a deal with (book publishers) Zondervan/Harper Collins. They\u2019re a bigtime publisher and they were excited about my story, and they wanted to tell it the way I wanted to tell it.\n\nAlso, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame (induction ceremony for Journey) was on the horizon (in 2017). It was a blessing, because I would be remiss if I had released the book and not had the Hall of Fame event in the book. The night of the ceremony, I really saw how the book should go. I saw Steve Perry standing next to me, and I remember him and I having this conversation (many years earlier) about writing a song for the ages. We had just met each other, and yet that\u2019s what our dream was. At the time, the Beatles were having their resurgence (when their albums were released on CD), and we were amazed at their sales even 20 years later. And we thought\u2026Wow, what if that happened for us one day? We were a couple guys who had just met each other, and we were marveling at the power of the songs the Beatles wrote, being together for just six years (1964-1970). It was remarkable what they did in six years. And for us, six years seemed to be the period of time that Steve and I and Neal (Schon) hunkered down together and did the big records\u2026Escape, Frontiers and Raised on Radio\u2026those were the big ones. It was pretty crazy that it happened in just six years.\n\nSo as I was standing onstage at the Hall of Fame, it was like the Lord showed me, \u201cHere\u2019s how you begin and here\u2019s how you\u2019ll end\u201d (laughs). And to have the Hall of Fame event come into my life, it made me put everything in its place. I knew then the story I needed to tell, which is encouraging people to have a dream, and that anything is possible. Also, that you\u2019re not what other people say you are\u2026you\u2019re uniquely you. That was my message.\n\nDK: You\u2019ve also released a new album called The Songs You Leave Behind. Can you talk about this album?\n\nCain: This was a kind of prophetic thing\u2026I had been writing these songs about my life. After Steve (Perry) left Journey in 1987, I had to define who I was as a songwriter. Was I just the guy in Journey, or did I have something to say? And I really put myself to it. I wanted to find the guy that wrote \u201cFaithfully,\u201d and I did. I built a studio in my backyard, and I set about making a solo album in the \u201890s. [As it turns out] these songs fit in the audiobook perfectly, because I was defining the crossroads of my life. I wrote songs about the school fire [I survived as a child], almost drowning in a lake, my children being born, my father passing, and even my dog that I loved so much. So all these songs fit in the audiobook perfectly.\n\nThe album (The Songs You Leave Behind) is a collection of 19 songs for the people that love the story of my book Don\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019 that want the whole song. This is because a lot of the songs in the audiobook are only a minute or minute-in-a-half long, and then they fade away. So if you want to hear the whole songs, this album is sort of the partner to the book.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a video of Journey (with Steve Perry) performing their hit,\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019.\u201d\n\nDK: You\u2019ve written many songs for Journey with Steve Perry and Neal Schon. What was the songwriting process for the three of you?\n\nCain: There was a certain preparation. We knew we were going to get together on any given day. We\u2019d come in with something\u2014Steve would have something in his head, I\u2019d have something in mind, and Neal would have something in mind. We all came to the table with something to contribute, and beautifully enough, it worked well. We were on the same wavelength many times. Steve would bring in a melody and I would have the piano part for it. Or one of us would have the chorus, and I would have the lyric and he would have the melody for that lyric.\n\nI remember how we wrote \u201cWho\u2019s Crying Now.\u201d Steve was just humming this thing and snapping his fingers to this groovy thing. Steve sang what sounded like \u201cWooh ooh, wow ooh wow\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cWell it sounds like you\u2019re saying Who\u2019s Crying Now.\u201d And this was me just pulling stuff out of the air and pinning the tail on the donkey and there it is\u2026Boom. Many times, Steve would scat stuff and it would sound like something. And I would ask myself\u2026what did it sound like? Knowing we would get together, we would always try to bring a nugget to the table. We trusted each other enough in that brotherhood, to see the ideas through.\n\nDK: In recent years, \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019\u201d has become Journey\u2019s most popular song. How did you, Steve and Neal write this song?\n\nCain: In a nutshell, I was in Hollywood trying to make it in the \u201870s, [and at the time money was tight and] I had to ask my father for money. My dog got hit by a car, and it was a $1000 vet bill to keep her alive. I worked out a deal with the vet, and then I called my dad and said, \u201cGosh, I don\u2019t have this money.\u201d I was living month-to-month. So he loaned me some money and I said to him, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m gettin\u2019 my butt kicked here\u2026should I come home?\u201d And he said, \u201cJon, don\u2019t stop believing. We had this vision for you all along since you were a little kid. You\u2019re gonna make it, don\u2019t worry.\u201d And I said, \u201cOkay dad.\u201d So I wrote the words \u201cdon\u2019t stop believin\u2019\u201d in my lyric book and kept it with me.\n\nThen years later when I working with Journey on an album, Steve Perry asked if I had any lyrics or melodies that might work for the new album. I went home and paged through all my spiral notebooks. On the last page of my notebook I found three words scribbled: \u201cDon\u2019t stop believin\u2019.\u201d And I thought that could be a good song, and Steve would like the title and love singing that. So I wrote the chorus that night and brought it to rehearsal, and they loved it. Then the three of us kind of wrote the song backwards. Neal came up with the bass line and the B section. We didn\u2019t really know what the lyric was going to be until the next day.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a video of Journey (with Steve Perry) performing their hit,\n\n\u201cOpen Arms.\u201d\n\nI had the title and most of the lyrics for the chorus, but we didn\u2019t know how we were gonna get there. So we went backwards (working on the verse after writing the chorus first). I shared with them how I grew up and lived in Laurel Canyon in the \u201870s, going down to Sunset Boulevard on a Friday night and seeing the menagerie of hustlers and dreamers and stuff. And I asked, \u201cWhat if it was like this? This small town girl and this city boy, and they were gonna jump on a midnight train going anywhere.\u201d [We came up with train] because Neal had this staccato guitar line that sounded like a train going somewhere. So it was like dreaming about making it. [We came up with the lyrics] \u201cSome will win and some will lose,\u201d and \u201cthe smell of wine and cheap perfume\u201d might as well be the Whisky a Go Go club. And Steve and I were both singers in a smoky room, because we grew up in the nightclubs. So it was sort of a perfect concept for Steve too, so the two of us grafted that lyric and the rest is history. We laid the track down and it was the first song on the Escape album.\n\nDK: Another one of your big hits was the ballad, \u201cOpen Arms.\u201d How did you and Steve write this song?\n\nCain: I actually had that song when I came up to San Francisco. I had written the melody and the chorus, and I had lyrics to the chorus but I didn\u2019t have lyrics to the verse. When I landed in San Francisco, Steve wanted to know if I had any ballads. He said, \u201cI really want to sing a ballad on this album, and I\u2019m thinking about making a solo album.\u201d I looked at him and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to make a solo album. You\u2019ve got Journey, man. You can do anything you want in this band.\u201d And he said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m just looking for a ballad I can soar on.\u201d I said, \u201cWell I have a song called \u2018Open Arms\u2019.\u201d So I played him the song on a little Wurlitzer piano I\u2019d brought over to his house. Steve loved it and said, \u201cLet\u2019s finish the lyric.\u201d And so we did\u2014in about two hours, the lyrics were done.\n\nThis is one of the first songs that I knew we were a team, because it was so magically easy. Steve and I were on the same wavelength in a lot of ways lyrically. And Neal and I were very close musically. So when I would get Neal\u2019s music, I could give it to Steve and give him some ideas. \u201cOpen Arms\u201d was a song that Neal wasn\u2019t part of [the writing], so we brought it in rehearsal, and the band looked at us puzzled, like \u201cWhat do we do with this?\u201d (because it was a piano ballad). And Steve was so positive\u2014he said, \u201cThis is gonna be orchestrated and we\u2019re gonna make it this epic ballad. It\u2019s gonna be soaring\u2026it will be amazing in the arenas.\u201d The song ended up doing very well for us. It\u2019s still the [romantic song] that couples hold on to each other and hug and kiss when they hear it.\n\nDK: A Journey hit that you wrote by yourself was \u201cFaithfully.\u201d What inspired you to write this song?\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a video of Journey (with Arnell Pineda) performing their hit,\n\n\u201cFaithfully.\u201d\n\nCain: I was feeling distance with my (first) wife. I was the new guy in the band, and one day I was sitting out at an empty arena; we were waiting for our crew. I sat and watched the riggers take down the big stage and I was thinking, \u201cWow this is crazy, we\u2019re like a circus family.\u201d And I thought about how we all missed our family and loved ones\u2026we all pay a price for the road life. Then I thought\u2026what if we had a song that we could all hold on to each other and say \u201cThis is what we do,\u201d and they could send that song home and Journey says, \u201cWe\u2019re forever yours\u2026Faithfully.\u201d And so I started writing this song on a bus. I wrote the lyrics on a napkin.\n\nI went to sleep and I woke up the next morning, and I took the napkin with me. I looked at it and I started writing. I wrote the lyrics, line after line. It was pouring out of me. And then I had a little Casio keyboard and I started plunking out the melody. Then I took the song to soundcheck, and I found this big symphony piano and started playing the song. I realized that it was a good song and that I would show it to Steve. I knew he would love it.\n\nSo I played Steve \u201cFaithfully,\u201d but then he said he wanted it for his solo album. And I took the cassette from him and said, \u201cNo\u2026it has to be for Journey.\u201d And he said, \u201cReally?\u201d I said, \u201cYou write your own album. This is a Journey song.\u201d\n\nThen later on for the Frontiers album (in 1983), the producer called me and said, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna cut a ballad. Bring in a ballad tomorrow. I was wondering\u2026how did he know this? I had only played \u201cFaithfully\u201d for Steve. But it was the producer who brought this song into light. Then we recorded it\u2014Neal wrote a chart, Ross wrote a chart\u2026we did three takes. Then Steve said, \u201cI\u2019ll sing it on one condition. You stay away from the studio and let me do my thing with it.\u201d I said, \u201cYou got it, sir.\u201d So I think he sang it for a couple of days, and they comped the vocals and called me in and I got chills when I heard it. And that\u2019s how the song came to be. Sreve did an amazing job. And Neal played an amazing guitar solo on it, and he came up with the french horn part.\n\nSome songs you write just get bigger than anything you\u2019d imagine. When we played it live, we started seeing fans coming into the show with signs saying, \u201cWe\u2019re forever yours\u2026Faithfully.\u201d And I said, \u201cAlright\u2026that\u2019s it\u2014they can\u2019t kick me out of the band now (laughs).\n\nDK: You\u2019ve been with Journey for almost 40 years now. How would you sum up the experience of being with this band for all these years?\n\nCain: Yeah it\u2019s been 37 years. You know, I guess we became the soundtrack for people\u2019s lives. It\u2019s remarkable to be part of that musical legacy, and then to go into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame really caps it off. You realize that this music resonates with people, and it\u2019s important to keep it alive. It\u2019s just remarkable and an honor, and you live in that grateful place all the time and just go, \u201cThank you.\u201d And I give the Lord all credit and praise for my success throughout these years. As I mentioned in the book, it had to be divine intervention to send a kid from Chicago into the Journey camp (laughs). We would write this music, and I had no idea what I was walking into, except the Lord did. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be great, Jon.\u201d (laughs)."}, {"url": "https://www.udiscovermusic.com/playlists/singer-songwriters-the-100-greatest-songs/", "page_content": "In a time long ago \u2013 well, sometime before the early 60s \u2013 songwriters wrote songs and singers sang them. It was less often that people did both. Of course, there were exceptions; arguably it was the coming of Bob Dylan that signalled a great leap forward for singer-songwriters.\n\nBut, cast your mind back, if you can, to March 1962 and the release of Dylan\u2019s self-titled debut album. Of the 13 songs on the album, just two were written by the Bobster. Five were Dylan\u2019s arrangements of traditional songs, two were other people\u2019s arrangements of traditional songs, and there were covers of Blind Lemon Jefferson, Jesse Fuller, Bukka White and Curtis Jones. It wasn\u2019t until a year later, in May 1963, that Bob\u2019s second album revealed his emerging songwriting talents: 11 of its 13 tracks were Dylan originals. Two months earlier and Lennon and McCartney wrote eight of the 14 tracks on The Beatles\u2019 debut album. It was something of a turning point.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDylan came out of the folk tradition, and it was the acoustic-folk genre that was \u2013 and remains \u2013 the spiritual home of the singer-songwriter, where performers tend to provide the sole accompaniment to an entire composition or song, typically using a guitar or piano. The political protest songs of Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie are what people thought of as singer-songwriters before Dylan, but by 1963 there was a subtle shift that accelerated as the 60s advanced. Even before that time, however, singers such as Hank Williams were forging a place in musical history where they wrote and performed their own songs, though they were often backed by a group, which causes some to forget that Williams was a true singer-songwriter.\n\nGo back a little further and Blind Lemon Jefferson, Blind Willie McTell, Son House and others from the Mississippi Delta were doing just the same in the 30s. Add to that list Robert Johnson, who created a canon second to none of songs that have been covered by countless others ever since. But at the same time, never forget that when Johnson was playing juke joints and house rent parties, he would frequently cover the hits of Bing Crosby who was singing songs from the writers that frequented New York\u2019s Tin Pan Alley. He, like so many performers, was trying to entertain and earn a crust\u2026 the covers band and covers singer is a proud tradition. Recently someone posted a video online of a guy with a guitar covering Stevie Wonder\u2019s \u2018Superstition\u2019 on stage at a hotel, somewhere in America; Stevie himself was in the hotel and he went on stage to join the unknown performer to sing his own composition. Somehow it feels like the tradition finally came full circle.\n\nWe have tried to come up with the ultimate playlist of the greatest songs performed and written by singer-songwriters. It includes all the usual suspects, From Dylan, Elton and Stevie to Carole King, Joni and Dolly. It also unearths some real gems by singer-songwriters who have crafted superb songs that forced their way into our list.\n\nThere\u2019s Scott Walker\u2019s \u2018Such A Small Love\u2019, from his debut solo album; one of Canada\u2019s finest songwriter-singers, Gino Vannelli and \u2018Gypsy Days\u2019 Nashville\u2019s Gretchen Peters\u2019 \u2018Secret Of Life\u2019, Clifford T Ward\u2019s \u2018Home Thoughts From Abroad\u2019 and Stephen Bishop\u2019s \u2018On and On\u2019. Which is just what we could do with this list\u2026 The 70s was the heyday of the singer-songwriter, but they are as meaningful today as they\u2019ve ever been.\n\nSo what are the 100 greatest songs?\n\n100.

It doesn't necessarily need words.\n\nLegally, it may be a musical work combined with a literary one. Words and music. The author (or authors) of the song are the people who invent the music and the words. Other components of what we might think of as a song -- harmony, chordal cushioning, rhythm, contrapuntal texturing, feel, etc., are not considered part of the writing of the song, but part of a song's arrangement.\n\nAn arranger, in the eyes of the law, is not an author.\n\nBut let's consider how things actually work in the world. Songs do not always arrive in discrete packages; they are not always the product of an artist retreating to a room with a guitar or a piano and emerging with a lead sheet and lyrics. Often songs come in the heat of collaboration, in a sweaty garage or basement or rehearsal hall where musicians are playing together, investigating the possibility of a beat, of a key. Songs can start with a riff or an offhand joke by the bass player.\n\nIn the world of practice, it is not so easy to define what came from where. It's impossible to engrave your initials on the underside of an idea. The author of a song is the one who files the papers first.\n\nThis matters. In the music business, publishing royalties are important. Owning a song is like owning a business; playing bass or guitar or singing in a band is like working for a wage. Once upon a time you could get rich playing rock 'n' roll music, power chords in 4/4 time. But you could get a lot richer writing classic rock 'n' roll songs.\n\nThere is a simple answer to who wrote The Band's songs. Look at the credits on the first two albums. On 1968's \"Music From Big Pink,\" Robbie Robertson is credited as the sole writer of four songs, \"The Weight,\" \"Caledonia Mission,\" \"To Kingdom Come,\" and \"Chest Fever.\"\n\nRichard Manuel has three solo writing credits (\"In a Station,\" \"We Can Talk,\" \"Lonesome Suzie,\") and a co-write with Bob Dylan (\"Tears of Rage\").\n\nRick Danko is credited, along with Dylan, for \"This Wheel's on Fire.\"\n\nThe Band also covers Dylan's \"I Shall Be Released\" and the Marijohn Wilkin/Danny Dill chestnut \"Long Black Veil.\"\n\nOn the second album, 1969's \"The Band,\" Robertson is credited as the sole author of eight of the 12 songs, shares credit with Manuel on three others and with Levon Helm on \"Jemima Surrender.\"\n\nFrom this we might deduce that Robertson is the primary creative engine for the Band, with others making significant lesser contributions. Had Helm not famously disputed this, had he not vociferously protested that Robertson took advantage of his bandmates who were more interested in the process of music making than the assigning of credit (and future royalties), we would accept Robertson as one of the great rock 'n' roll songwriters.\n\nHelm's position was that Robertson was just the one who filed the papers. And there is something to that -- who thinks of \"Chest Fever\" as anything but a Garth Hudson song?\n\n\"Does it even have lyrics?\" Robertson, its putative lyricist, once asked, and there are accounts of the lyrics been improvised by the singers Helm, Manuel and Danko. Hudson started it out interpolating Bach's Tocatta and Fugue in D minor, and there's a weird part where Manuel is sawing on a violin while Hudson honks on a sax. But J.R. Robertson is listed as the sole songwriter.\n\nThe Band (from top right, clockwise): Richard Manuel on piano, Levon Helm on drums, lead guitarist Robbie Robertson and bass guitarist Rick Danko, take the stage for their final live performance at Winterland Auditorium in San Francisco on Nov. 27, 1976.(AP file photo)\n\nWe will never know. In Sandra B. Tooze's sympathetic new biography \"Levon: From Down in the Delta to the Birth of The Band and Beyond\" (Diversion Books, $28.99) she sets out Helm's position as being that \"the music was a group effort, an amalgamation of all their creativity.\"\n\nThis is no doubt true, though it doesn't preclude the possibility that Robertson was the author of the melody and lyrics to those songs in which he claims sole copyright.\n\nWhat is legal is not always what is fair and ethical. Robertson's version is that he was taking care of business while his bandmates partied and wallowed in drug abuse. He kept The Band going when the others would have frittered the dream away. He has made his case in his 2016 book \"Testimony\" and in Daniel Roher's recent documentary \"Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and the Band.\"\n\nBy way of disclosure, like a lot of people in Arkansas, I had some dealings with and warm feelings for Helm. I've written a lot about The Band. But I understand Robertson's point of view.\n\nYet there's another argument. If Robertson's taking sole credit for \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\" wasn't outright theft, it was at least an egregious case of cultural appropriation.\n\nWhile Tooze tries to remain nonpartisan, the romantic view will always tilt toward the charismatic, easy-flowing Helm over the relatively buttoned-up and occasionally vainglorious Robertson. She gives the final word to Canadian musician David Clayton-Thomas (Blood, Sweat & Tears), who says that \"Music From Big Pink\" really began before the as-yet-unnamed Band retreated to Woodstock, when they were still playing clubs on Toronto's Yonge Street:\n\n\"I know a great deal of that album was Levon Helm. Sure, everyone contributed, but I just knew what a force he was in that band, and there's no way he didn't co-write some of those songs, and he maintained that right up until his death. And I believe him because I was privy to the process of that group and how they worked. Levon definitely was the driving force ...\n\n\"It's more likely Robbie was smart and they were busy partying and drugging ... I would have felt better about it had [Robbie] gotten the publishing but still credited the writers ... I knew how much they contributed.\"\n\nPhillips County native Levon Helm was photographed in 1994 for the Democrat-Gazette\u2019s High Profile section.(NWA Democrat-Gazette/David Gottschalk)\n\nThankfully Tooze's biography, the only major book about Helm apart from the 1993 memoir he wrote with Stephen Davis, \"This Wheel's on Fire,\" doesn't belabor the feud, and does some wonderful work excavating Helm's childhood in Turkey Scratch, thanks largely to extensive interviews with family friends that elevate the book above the sort of clip-job biographies that rely exclusively on secondary sources. (Tooze also relies on a lot of secondary sources. Bravo.)\n\nA wonderfully detailed account of young Levon -- champion tractor driver, indifferent student, irrepressible personality and grace-touched musician -- emerges in the early pages before moving into the more familiar story of how Ronnie Hawkins brought teen-ager Helm with him to Toronto and the lucrative Canadian bar circuit.\n\nThere, as part of Hawkins' backing band The Hawks, Helm grew into an assured multi-instrumentalist, on-stage band leader, and an uncommonly alert and sensitive artist. Tooze, a Canadian who interviewed Helm for her 1997 biography of Muddy Waters, one of Helm's musical touchstones, is very good at limning Helm's musical and show-biz education under the tutelage of Hawkins, who quickly understood that Helm and the other young musicians -- the nascent Band -- he'd collected would eventually outgrow him.\n\n\"They were the best white rhythm and blues band probably in the world at that time,\" she quotes Hawkins as saying. \"They were too musical for me. They got too good.\"\n\nHelm and Robertson were especially close, and even before as The Hawks set out on their own it was apparent that their skills were complementary. Robertson was the cerebral one who could write lyrics, while Helm was an incandescent showman who effortlessly channeled traditional musical styles while imbuing it with his own signature panache. Technically, Robertson was the writer, Helm the arranger. (And, at least in the beginning, the best guitar player in The Hawks. And probably the best bassist.)\n\nTooze understands and explicates Helm's not always obvious gifts, the way \"he laid down his groove at the far end of the beat\" to make a song more danceable; the way he managed great projection with a light touch and maintained a \"slight swing, inhabiting a sweet spot between a shuffle and a straight groove, a technique influenced by Earl Palmer.\"\n\nThere's a lot here that will be familiar to even casual fans of Helm and The Band. But Tooze has done us a significant service -- \"Levon\" is a judicious, tender and remarkably thorough biography of an American icon, a definitive biography of Levon Helm.\n\nEmail:\n\npmartin@adgnewsroom.com\n\nblooddirtangels.com"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/the-Beatles", "page_content": "The Beatles\u2019 first hit was the song \u201cLove Me Do\u201d in 1962, which peaked at number 17 on the U.K. singles charts. The song was released by the record label Parlophone but had been recorded before the band was signed.\n\nBeatlemania was the name given to the popular frenzy surrounding the Beatles after the band\u2019s first appearances on British television in 1963. When the Beatles appeared on American television in 1964, Beatlemania also erupted in the United States. Mass media created the conditions for the collective frenzy that was Beatlemania.\n\nThe Beatles were formed around the nucleus of members John Lennon and Paul McCartney , who first performed together in Liverpool, England, in 1957. They performed with a changing cast of accompanists and under a changing list of band names before settling on their final members and name.\n\nthe Beatles, formerly called the Quarrymen or the Silver Beatles, byname Fab Four, British musical quartet and a global cynosure for the hopes and dreams of a generation that came of age in the 1960s. The principal members were John Lennon (b. October 9, 1940, Liverpool, Merseyside, England\u2014d. December 8, 1980, New York, New York, U.S.), Paul McCartney (in full Sir James Paul McCartney; b. June 18, 1942, Liverpool), George Harrison (b. February 25, 1943, Liverpool\u2014d. November 29, 2001, Los Angeles, California, U.S.), and Ringo Starr (byname of Richard Starkey; b. July 7, 1940, Liverpool). Other early members included Stuart Sutcliffe (b. June 23, 1940, Edinburgh, Scotland\u2014d. April 10, 1962, Hamburg, West Germany) and Pete Best (b. November 24, 1941, Madras [now Chennai], India).\n\nFormed around the nucleus of Lennon and McCartney, who first performed together in Liverpool in 1957, the group grew out of a shared enthusiasm for American rock and roll. Like most early rock-and-roll figures, Lennon, a guitarist and singer, and McCartney, a bassist and singer, were largely self-taught as musicians. Precocious composers, they gathered around themselves a changing cast of accompanists, adding by the end of 1957 Harrison, a lead guitarist, and then, in 1960 for several formative months, Sutcliffe, a promising young painter who brought into the band a brooding sense of bohemian style. After dabbling in skiffle, a jaunty sort of folk music popular in Britain in the late 1950s, and assuming several different names (the Quarrymen, the Silver Beetles, and, finally, the Beatles), the band added a drummer, Best, and joined a small but booming \u201cbeat music\u201d scene, first in Liverpool and then, during several long visits between 1960 and 1962, in Hamburg\u2014another seaport full of sailors thirsty for American rock and roll as a backdrop for their whiskey and womanizing.\n\nBritannica Quiz Phenomenon From Across the Pond\n\nIn autumn 1961 Brian Epstein, a local Liverpool record store manager, saw the band and fell in love. Unshakably convinced of their commercial potential, Epstein became their manager and proceeded to bombard the major British music companies with letters and tape recordings of the band, finally winning a contract with Parlophone, a subsidiary of the giant EMI group of music labels. The man in charge of their career at Parlophone was George Martin, a classically trained musician who from the start put his stamp on the Beatles, first by suggesting the band hire a more polished drummer (they chose Starr) and then by rearranging their second recorded song (and first big British hit), \u201cPlease Please Me,\u201d changing it from a slow dirge into an up-tempo romp.\n\nThroughout the winter and into the spring of 1963, the Beatles continued their rise to fame in England by producing spirited recordings of original tunes and also by playing classic American rock and roll on a variety of British Broadcasting Corporation radio programs. In these months, fascination with the Beatles\u2014at first confined to young British fans of popular music\u2014breached the normal barriers of taste, class, and age, transforming their recordings and live performances into matters of widespread public comment. In the fall of that year, when they belatedly made a couple of appearances on British television, the evidence of popular frenzy prompted British newspapermen to coin a new word for the phenomenon: Beatlemania. In early 1964, after equally tumultuous appearances on American television, the same phenomenon erupted in the United States and provoked a so-called British Invasion of Beatles imitators from the United Kingdom.\n\nBeatlemania was something new. Musicians performing in the 19th century certainly excited a frenzy\u2014one thinks of Franz Liszt\u2014but that was before the modern mass media created the possibility of collective frenzy. Later pop music idols, such as Michael Jackson in the mid-1980s and Garth Brooks in the 1990s, sold similarly large numbers of records without provoking anything approaching the hysteria caused by the Beatles. By the summer of 1964, when the Beatles appeared in A Hard Day\u2019s Night, a movie that dramatized the phenomenon of Beatlemania, the band\u2019s effect was evident around the world as countless young people emulated the band members\u2019 characteristic long hair, flip humour, and whimsical displays of devil-may-care abandon. Indeed, their transformative social and cultural influence was even recognized among the upper echelons of political power. In 1965 each of the four Beatles was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), having been recommended for the honour by British Prime Minister Harold Wilson (and despite a brief storm of protest by some previous recipients, mainly military veterans, against what they perceived as a lowering of the dignity of the royal order).\n\nThe popular hubbub proved to be a spur, convincing Lennon and McCartney of their songwriting abilities and sparking an outpouring of creative experimentation all but unprecedented in the history of rock music, which until then had been widely regarded, with some justification, as essentially a genre for juveniles. Between 1965 and 1967 the music of the Beatles rapidly changed and evolved, becoming ever more subtle, sophisticated, and varied. Their repertoire in these years ranged from the chamber pop ballad \u201cYesterday\u201d and the enigmatic folk tune \u201cNorwegian Wood\u201d (both in 1965) to the hallucinatory hard rock song \u201cTomorrow Never Knows\u201d (1966), with a lyric inspired by Timothy Leary\u2019s handbook The Psychedelic Experience (1964). It also included the carnivalesque soundscape of \u201cBeing for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\u201d (1967), which featured stream-of-consciousness lyrics by Lennon and a typically imaginative arrangement (by George Martin) built around randomly spliced-together snippets of recorded steam organs\u2014a tour de force of technological legerdemain quite typical of the band\u2019s studio work in this era.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

A year later, in June 1967, this period of widely watched creative renewal was climaxed by the release of Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band, an album avidly greeted by young people around the world as indisputable evidence not only of the band\u2019s genius but also of the era\u2019s utopian promise. More than a band of musicians, the Beatles had come to personify, certainly in the minds of millions of young listeners, the joys of a new counterculture of hedonism and uninhibited experimentation\u2014with music and with new ways of life. (Various members of the band in these years flirted with mind-expanding drugs such as LSD and also with exotic spiritual exercises such as transcendental meditation, a technique taught to them by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a barnstorming guru from India.)\n\nIn those years the Beatles effectively reinvented the meaning of rock and roll as a cultural form. The American artists they admired and chose to emulate\u2014Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Elvis Presley, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, the pioneering rock composers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, the influential soul songwriter Smokey Robinson, and, after 1964, folksinger and topical songwriter Bob Dylan\u2014became widely regarded as canonic sources of inspiration, offering \u201cclassical\u201d models for aspiring younger rock musicians. At the same time, the original songs the Beatles wrote and recorded dramatically expanded the musical range and expressive scope of the genre they had inherited. Their close vocal harmonies, subtle arrangements, and clever production touches, combined with an elemental rhythm section anchored by Starr\u2019s no-nonsense drumming, created new standards of excellence and beauty in a form of music previously known for amateurism.\n\nAfter 1968 and the eruption of student protest movements in countries as different as Mexico and France, the Beatles insensibly surrendered their role as de facto leaders of an inchoate global youth culture. They nevertheless continued for several more years to record and release new music and maintained a level of popularity rarely rivaled before or since. In 1968 they launched their own record label, Apple; hoping to nurture experimental pop art, they instead produced chaos and commercial failure, apart from the work of the Beatles themselves. The band continued to enjoy widespread popularity. The following year Abbey Road went on to become one of the band\u2019s best-loved and biggest-selling albums.\n\nMeanwhile, personal disagreements magnified by the stress of symbolizing the dreams of a generation had begun to tear the band apart. Once the collaborative heart and soul of the band, Lennon and McCartney fell into bickering and mutual accusations of ill will. By now millions of dollars were at stake, and the utopian aura of the performers was in jeopardy, given the discrepancy between the band\u2019s symbolic stature as idols of a carefree youth culture and their newfound real status as pampered plutocrats.\n\nIn the spring of 1970 the Beatles formally disbanded. In the years that followed, all four members went on to produce solo albums of variable quality and popularity. Lennon released a corrosive set of songs with his new wife, Yoko Ono, and McCartney went on to form a band, Wings, that turned out a fair number of commercially successful recordings in the 1970s. Starr and Harrison, too, initially had some success as solo artists. But, as time went by, the Beatles became as much of a historical curio as Al Jolson or Bing Crosby or Frank Sinatra or Elvis Presley before them.\n\nIn 1980 Lennon was murdered by a demented fan outside the Dakota, an apartment building in New York City known for its celebrity tenants. The event provoked a global outpouring of grief. Lennon is memorialized in Strawberry Fields, a section of Central Park across from the Dakota that Yoko Ono landscaped in her husband\u2019s honour.\n\nIn the years that followed, the surviving former Beatles continued to record and perform as solo artists. McCartney in particular remained musically active, both in the pop field, producing new albums every few years, and in the field of classical music\u2014in 1991 he completed Liverpool Oratorio; in 1997 he supervised the recording of another symphonic work of large ambition, Standing Stone; and in 1999 he released a new classical album, Working Classical. McCartney was knighted by the queen of England in 1997. Starr was also very visible in the 1990s, touring annually with his All-Star Band, a rotating group of rock veterans playing their hits on the summertime concert circuit. Beginning in 1988, Harrison recorded with Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, and Roy Orbison in a loose amalgam known as the Traveling Wilburys, but, for most of the 1980s and \u201990s, he had a low profile as a musician while acting as the producer of several successful films. After surviving a knife attack at his home in 1999, Harrison succumbed to a protracted battle with cancer in 2001.\n\nEarly in the 1990s McCartney, Harrison, and Starr had joined to add harmonies to two previously unreleased vocal recordings by Lennon. These new songs by \u201cthe Beatles\u201d served as a pretext for yet another publicity blitz, aimed at creating a market for a lavishly produced quasi-historical series of archival recordings assembled under the supervision of the band and released in 1995 and 1996 as The Beatles Anthology, a collection of six compact discs that supplemented a 10-hour-long authorized video documentary of the same name. A compilation of the band\u2019s number one singles, 1, appeared in 2000 and enjoyed worldwide success, topping the charts in such countries as England and the United States. The afterglow of Beatlemania may have disappeared, but the iconography of an era of youthful tumult had been reverently preserved for posterity.\n\nThe Beatles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and Lennon (1994), McCartney (1999), Harrison (2004), and Starr (2015) were also inducted as individuals. In September 2009, specially packaged digitally remastered versions of the Beatles\u2019 entire catalog and a Beatles version of the popular electronic music game Rock Band were released simultaneously. After it was reported in February 2010 that the financially troubled EMI was soliciting buyers for its Abbey Road Studios, where the Beatles made the great majority of their recordings, the British Department for Culture, Media, and Sport declared the recording complex a historic landmark. EMI subsequently announced that it would retain ownership of the iconic studio while seeking outside investment to improve its facilities."}, {"url": "https://bob-dylan.org.uk/archives/2220", "page_content": "By Tony Attwood\n\nIn my earlier article on how Dylan writes songs I outlined the notion that there are at least seven different types of art ranging from representational art to religious art. In that article I quoted from Dylan\u2019s interview for Rolling Stone in which he gave a fairly clear indication of his religious convictions.\n\nNow I want to move on to the speech Dylan gave at the Musicare Awards in which he gave as detailed account as he ever has on his writing and where the songs come from. This speech was interesting, for it was Dylan\u2019s chance to contradict the Rolling Stone interview and say, for example, \u201cYou\u2019re right \u2013 all these characters in these songs are all coded messages to do with the need to follow what is laid down in the Bible,\u201d but he didn\u2019t. Instead he continued the theme of the interview, revealing the influences that worked upon his songs.\n\nRight at the start of the speech he said,\n\n\u201cThese songs of mine, they\u2019re like mystery stories, the kind that Shakespeare saw when he was growing up. I think you could trace what I do back that far. They were on the fringes then, and I think they\u2019re on the fringes now.\u201d\n\nThe stories Dylan refers to are generally known (at least in the UK) as the Mystery Plays or Miracle Plays \u2013 cycles of plays in verse which dramatised stories from the Bible. Each town or city had its own cycle of plays \u2013 the most famous being the 48 play cycle from York. They would be performed over a number of days, and in the larger towns in several locations around the town.\n\nWhat one has to remember is that the audience of the day so no other dramatic entertainment, so when the characters (including God) got onto stage, this was real to the audience. They literally had never seen anything like it. Think perhaps of little children going to a theatrical performance for the first time today. To them, there is nothing to distinguish what they are seeing on stage with what they see day by day. All is real.\n\nThere is indeed a lot of evidence that the plays were performed across the country, so Shakespeare may well have seen them in Stratford on Avon as a child, and known of them in London when he moved there in the late 16th century.\n\nThe Miracle Plays were also the blockbuster productions of their day, costing huge amounts to put on, and often sponsored by guilds where the story could be used to show a trade or profession in a particularly positive light. As a result the performances were entertainment, advertising, and the truth of the Christian story all mixed up as one.\n\nToday we don\u2019t necessarily associate religious festivals with humour and energy, but the Mystery Plays had lots of these. Over the years the plays evolved and were re-written, and their \u201cownership\u201d if there was any, was by the current performers.\n\nDrama was the key, and so the fall of Adam, the murder of Abel and Noah\u2019s flood etc were there to be used as New Testament events \u2013 and were often liked because of their vitality.\n\nThinking of this it is not too hard to see what Dylan was saying; he\u2019s taking the myths and legends of his time and re-working them into stories, using the dominant medium of today that appeals to his chosen audience \u2013 the popular song \u2013 just as the Mystery Plays took theatre as their method of presentation.\n\nIf we just look at a few of the songs from 1962, the year in which Dylan wrote the first songs that are still widely recognised today, we can see that he is indeed this sort of story teller \u2013 and one blessed with an ability to tell stories in an incredibly varied way.\n\nBallad for a friend tells us of the death of a friend, while Talkin\u2019 John Birch Society Blues makes fun of the far right wing. Blowing in the wind tells us to look out to the wider world to find what we want, but Corrina Corrina brings us back to the heart with a simple tale of lost love as does Tomorrow is a long time And all this comes before the anti-war protest song Hard Rain\u2019s a gonna fall and the desperate sadness and awfulness of life for the impoverished farmer in the Ballad of Hollis Brown and all this is followed (in terms of the order the songs were written in) by Don\u2019t think twice the archetypal song of leaving, and then the protest against racism, Oxford Town \u2013 again told not as a \u201cthis is terrible dont do this\u201d song, but as a story.\n\nWhat Dylan is saying here is that he\u2019s a story teller, and just as the original performed entertainments were in the style suitable for the day (religious tales acted out on temporary stages) so he started out as the storyteller with his guitar.\n\nThat then is the background \u2013 how he saw himself \u2013 as the story teller talking to the masses. But in the next section of the same speech Dylan also gave us a clue as to how the songs came out as they did. As he said,\n\n\u201cThese songs didn\u2019t come out of thin air. I didn\u2019t just make them up out of whole cloth. Contrary to what Lou Levy said, there was a precedent. It all came out of traditional music: traditional folk music, traditional rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and traditional big-band swing orchestra music.\n\n\u201cI learned lyrics and how to write them from listening to folk songs. And I played them, and I met other people that played them back when nobody was doing it. Sang nothing but these folk songs, and they gave me the code for everything that\u2019s fair game, that everything belongs to everyone.\n\n\u201cFor three or four years all I listened to were folk standards. I went to sleep singing folk songs. I sang them everywhere, clubs, parties, bars, coffeehouses, fields, festivals. And I met other singers along the way who did the same thing and we just learned songs from each other. I could learn one song and sing it next in an hour if I\u2019d heard it just once.\n\n\u201cIf you had sung that song as many times as I did, you\u2019d have written \u201cHow many roads must a man walk down?\u201d too.\u201d\n\nDylan was undoubtedly referring to two things here. One is the obvious link between \u201cJohn Henry said a man ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 but a man\u201d and \u201cHow many roads must a man walk down before you call him a man?\u201d and the other is the overall concept of the song in talking about the world around us, the world we experience.\n\nDylan continued\u2026\n\n\u201cBig Bill Broonzy had a song called \u201cKey to the Highway.\u201d I\u2019ve got a key to the highway / I\u2019m booked and I\u2019m bound to go / Gonna leave here runnin\u2019 because walking is most too slow. I sang that a lot. If you sing that a lot, you just might write, Highway 61.\u201d\n\nOf course there\u2019s no immediate link between Key to the Highway and \u201cHe asked poor Howard where can I go, Howard said there\u2019s only one place I know, Sam said tell me quick man I got to run, Howard just pointed with his gun, And said that way down on Highway 61,\u201d but there is the sold link with the blues (Highway 61 being the blues highway) and\n\nWhen the moon peeks over the mountains\n\nI\u2019ll be on my way.\n\nI\u2019m gonna roam this old highway\n\nUntil the break of day.\n\nOf course Dylan is exaggerating when he says, that \u201cYou\u2019d have written [Highway 61] too if you\u2019d sang \u201cKey to the Highway\u201d as much as me, but he is again giving us two big indications to what his work was all about. It was seeing himself as the theatrical story teller, and the man who was utterly immersed in the folk and blues music that had gone before him.\n\nHe is talking here not only about themes, but also about feel \u2013 the particular implication that the lonesome highway has for the men and women whose music he listened to time and time again and into whose culture he moved.\n\nThus we have a clear indication from Dylan as to where he sees himself coming from and what his music is about: Dylan the storyteller, Dylan the inheritor of America\u2019s popular musical traditions, Dylan the travelling showman tracing his performances back to mediaeval England.\n\nI\u2019ll continue my investigation in the next article\n\nAll the songs reviewed on this site\n\nDylan\u2019s work in the chronological order in which the songs were written."}]}
