He published many successful botanical texts, in particular studying collections made in North Africa. His father was the botanist Louis Claude Marie Richard.\n\n\n\nRichard received his Doctor of Medicine degree in Paris in 1820, by which time he had already published a successful botanical textbook, Nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de botanique (1819). The book went through ten editions and was translated into several languages, including Russian.\n\n\n\nFrom 1817 Richard was employed as curator of the Delessert Herbarium and as an aide-demonstrateur at the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle. In 1821 he was appointed aide-naturaliste at the latter and in 1823 published another well-received work, Botanique m\u00e9dicale (1823). Richard's first systematic monograph, meanwhile, dealt with the genus Hydrocotyle (1819). He later completed works on orchids and the family Rubiaceae.\n\n\n\nIn 1827 Richard left the Delessert Herbarium to work full time at the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, where he remained until 1831, in which year he was appointed Professor of Botany in the Faculty of Medicine, Paris. He was made a member of the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1834 and a foreign member of the Linnean Society in 1843.\n\n\n\nAchille Richard did not himself collect plants beyond Europe, but completed a two-volume flora of Ethiopia (Tentamen Florae Abyssinicae, 1847-1851) based on material from Richard Quartin-Dillon, Anton Petit and G.H.W. Schimper. Providing descriptions of more than 1,000 species, it served as the most complete reference work for the country's flora for many years, as there was virtually no more collecting undertaken in Ethiopia until the Italian occupation in 1935-1941. He also contributed to the Florae Senegambiae Tentamen (1830-1857) of J.B.A. Guillemin and G.S. Perrottet and with R.P. Lesson authored the section on the botany of New Zealand in the accounts of the Voyage of the Astrolabe.\n\n\n\nSources:\n\nAnon., 1853, Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London, 53: 243-244\n\nI.

He is noted for developing the scientific method in the area of materia medica. His techniques such as separating verified and unverified reports led to the development of the field of pharmacology. He was a teacher of fellow Andalusian botanist Ibn al-Baitar. Nabati authored his famous work Botanical Journey, an early book on plant and herb species which he based on his observations around the world.

Two notable plant finds were Celmisia adamsii from the crags of Table Mountain and Castle Rock and Elytranthe adamsii from the Hape Creek above the township of Thames. His eldest son, Ernest Adams, married the daughter of his friend, J. W. Hall, an early resident of the Thames after whom Podocarpus halli Kirk is named.

He recruited through advertisements in the newspapers, teachers in country schools, and the contacts made on his travels. Over the next forty years, more than 1,300 amateur enthusiasts would contribute to Mueller\u2019s flora of Australia. His network spanned the continent, decades before Australia was a country. It included more than two hundred women and twenty young girls, the youngest just six years old when she sent Mueller her first plant.\n\nOne of the most prolific collectors was Mary Kennedy. She lived on a sheep station in Wilcannia in New South Wales, about as far inland as you could go at the time without falling off the map, with eleven children to raise. We know she collected more than five hundred plants.\n\nAlong with the specimens themselves, she asked the local Indigenous people for the names of these plants and their uses; preserving a rich treasury of traditional knowledge that endures to this day.\n\nMueller gave her a legacy in exchange, a species of grevillea named in her honour: Grevillea kennedyana.\n\nA century would pass before the term \u201ccitizen science\u201d entered into the academic lexicon, and decades again before it gained deep credibility.\n\nIn hindsight, we can see that\u2019s exactly what Mueller\u2019s project was: a pioneering scientific project powered by people. It satisfied the three criteria that we look for in any great citizen science endeavour today: quality science, linked with the community, and with a broader goal of making the world a better place.\n\nCitizen science has to be good science\n\nTo be good science, citizen science must be consistent with the exacting standards we apply to every other experimental process.\n\nMueller knew that his claims to a comprehensive flora of Australia would be widely reported and intensely scrutinised. Tripping through the fields collecting wildflowers is easy. Peer-reviewed botany is hard. His collectors, including those with limited education or grounding in the scientific method, had to appreciate the difference. He made it his priority to explain.\n\nWhen a woman on a sheep station picked up her basket and headed off into the scrub, or put the samples on the mantelpiece to dry, she did so in the name of science.\n\nIt gave purpose to the collectors, and rigour to Mueller\u2019s research.\n\nCitizen science has to be a door to the world of science for the community\n\nMueller was an opportunist in his advocacy for amateur botany.\n\nHe recruited children, because they were sharp-eyed and enthusiastic; school teachers, because they could outsource the work to students; and women, because he saw their talent going to waste.\n\nIn an era when women rarely went to university, or entered the professions, he offered a taste of a world that many longed to enter. They proved they were worthy of far more: full and equal access with men, on merit.\n\nTimes have changed, and very much for the better, thanks in large part to those female pioneers. The need for those doors to science in the community remains.\n\nAlan Finkel , Author provided\n\nCitizen science has to make the world a better place\n\nIn the end, that\u2019s what makes it worth doing.\n\nThat spirit shines through in the letters written to Mueller by farmers\u2019 wives and stockmen\u2019s daughters.\n\nIt\u2019s the 1800s: the era of Banjo Paterson and Henry Lawson, when a newly prosperous people were falling in love with the bush. There\u2019s talk of Federation in the newspapers.\n\nHere was a project that united men and women from every colony, with a mighty vision, and a love of country.\n\nWe often focus on the \u201cscience\u201d part of citizen science. The \u201ccitizen\u201d is important as well. It reminds us that we are part of something greater than ourselves, with a duty to generations to come.\n\nRead more: Finkel's Law: robots won't replace us because we still need that human touch\n\nThere are some who believe that citizen science will be left in the twentieth century: a relic of an era before advances in artificial intelligence made human-power obsolete.\n\nI disagree. If humans today are anything like the humans of Mueller\u2019s day, we will never stop inventing new ways to be useful.\n\nThis article is based on a speech Dr Finkel delivered to the Citizen Science Association Conference 2018 in Adelaide on February 7."}, {"url": "https://plants.jstor.org/stable/history/10.5555/al.ap.person.bm000005866", "page_content": "Biography\n\nGerman-Australian botanist who initiated the National Herbarium of Victoria in Melbourne. Ferdinand von Mueller was one of the leading lights of early Australian botany and directed the Botanic Gardens at Melbourne for 15 years. A prolific plant collector and employer of collectors, he published numerous descriptions of new plant taxa and contributed many articles to scientific journals on botany and other subjects, including geography, pharmacy and agriculture. His prodigious correspondence with European scientists established his international reputation, but he lost out on authoring a flora of Australia to George Bentham, who was able to access historical specimens and their descriptions held at Kew. Highly respected in Europe, not least for his generosity in sharing his specimens, he held 20 knighthoods, five doctorates and membership of some 150 scientific societies.\n\n\n\nFerdinand von M\u00fcller was born in Rostock, northern Germany (he later anglicised his surname to Mueller). His father died of tuberculosis when the young Mueller was only ten years old and the family moved to T\u00f6nning, further to the west. Here he developed his love of nature, roaming the north-west coast and fields. Beginning an apprenticeship as an apothecary after his mother died in 1840, he then moved to the nearby town of Husum. As part of his apprenticeship Mueller was required to generate a herbarium, a task he took to with such relish that he was able to complete his first botanical work, Husums Phanerogamische Flora, in 1843. He later produced a flora of the whole state. He went on to graduate in pharmacy from the University of Kiel and was awarded his doctorate for a thesis on the flora of south-west Schleswig when he was 21. At this time his older sister, Iwanne, died of tuberculosis, and one of his two younger sisters began to show signs of the disease. This, together with the fact that he suffered delicate health himself, prompted the decision for Mueller and his two remaining sisters, Bertha and Clara, to emigrate to the warmer climes of Australia, on the recommendation of a family friend, Dr. Ludwig Preiss.\n\n\n\nArriving in Adelaide, Mueller immediately began work in a chemist's shop and zealously started to make collections of the local flora. At this time he anglicised his name and in 1849 became a British subject in South Australia. The early 1850s saw Mueller make trips farther afield to collect, and the first of his articles on the South Australian flora appeared in journals. In 1852 he sent a paper to the Linnean Society in London on the flora of South Australia, for example, and in 1853 both a German journal and Hooker's Journal of Botany & Kew Miscellany featured his piece \"Flora of South Australia displayed in its fundamental features\". In 1852 he left his sisters behind and joined friends moving to Victoria, though he did not share their plans to dig for gold. Instead, settling in Melbourne, he made the acquaintance of the Governor, C.J. La Trobe, who pounced upon Mueller's skills by appointing him the first Government Botanist of the Colony of Victoria in February 1853. He remained in this position until his death, as well as leading the Melbourne Botanic Gardens from 1857-1873.\n\n\n\nMueller never married but was dedicated to his botanical work, travelling far and wide searching for specimens and producing thousands of pages of botanical literature and correspondence. His early expeditions focussed on the Australian Alps, where he travelled with the botanic garden superintendent, John Dallachy, in 1853. He found the striking shrub Grevillea victoriae F.Muell. on this trip, which he named after Queen Victoria, and Acacia dallachiana F.Muell. He made two more fruitful trips to the Alps in 1853-1855, discovering the small white Ranunculus millani F.Muell. among more than a hundred more new species. He named this alpine plant after his host at Gippsland, the explorer Angus McMillan. Scaling two mountains he believed to be as yet undiscovered, Mueller named them Mount Hotham and Mount Latrobe, but they are now known as Mount Loch and Mount Feathertop, respectively, owing to later surveyors' difficulty in reconciling Mueller's compass readings, which may have suffered interference from the basalt cap of Mt. Loch. In 1855 he joined the North West Australia Expedition, though with trepidation because of the hostile nature of the area's Aboriginal population and the arid climate. He was rewarded with 8 species new to Australia.\n\n\n\nIn 1859 Mueller became president of the Royal Society of Victoria, which succeeded the former Philosophical Institute. Active in the society's Exploration Committee, he helped to set up the Burke and Wills expedition of 1860 (the first to cross the country) and as well as continuing his prolific writings, planned more collecting adventures for himself. In 1867 he visited Western Australia, choosing to explore the area around King George Sound, taking in Albany, the Porongorups and the Stirling Range, whose highest peaks he climbed. A decade later, commissioned by the government of Western Australia, he returned to the region to discover its northern landscapes, travelling overland as far as the Greenough River, then beyond Northampton to the Murchison River and across the barren plains to Shark Bay and Freycinet Harbour. Returning to Swan River, he also visited other parts of the south coast up to the Shannon River. Although he did not discover a great number of new taxa in Western Australia, Mueller was moved by the peculiar beauty of the area's flora. In particular, he was entranced by the myrtaceous Verticordia oculata Meisn., which he dubbed 'the princess of the Australian flora'.\n\n\n\nBecause of his lack of counterparts in Australia, Mueller was forced to be independent in many ways, though he relied very much on correspondence with Kew in England to verify his work. In his later life, however, he employed others to collect for him and began to publish with other botanists in Australia, such as J.H. Maiden. Among his major publications were the 12-volume Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae (1858-1882), Eucalyptographia (1879-1884) and The Iconography of Australian Species of Acacia and Cognate Genera (1887-1888). His 1879 Report on the Forest Resources of Western Australia, meanwhile, was one of the first to deal with the practical value of the country's trees. He also helped George Bentham with Flora Australiensis, in particular the section on Eucalyptus; his own dreams to publish such a flora dashed by his not returning to Europe to consult herbarium collections there. Correspondence with William Hooker indicates that he made plans to go to Europe in the late 1850s, but decided not to go for fear of being stripped of his government position in his absence from Melbourne.\n\n\n\nMueller's lone nature came to the fore when indeed he was ousted from his position at the Melbourne Botanic Gardens. The decision was seemingly made because of his focus on science at the expense of making the gardens appealing to the general public. A Royal Commission on the gardens in 1871 saw Mueller replaced within two years by William Guilfoyle, though he retained his position as Government Botanist. While devastated at this turn of events, he was yet to enjoy myriad honours in the next two decades. He had already been appointed a baron in his native Germany in 1871 and was made CMG in 1868, followed by KCMG in 1879. A Fellow of the Linnean Society and of the Royal Society, he received the latter's Royal Medal in 1888, and in 1890 was elected president of the new Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n\n\nAs well as his exploration, plant collecting and publishing achievements, Mueller may claim credit for introducing many economic plants to Australia, as well as sending eucalyptus to other countries. For example, plantations of Eucalyptus globulus at the Pontine marshes near Rome, established from 1870, made the inhospitable area habitable, and earned him a papal knighthood. A Lutheran Christian who believed in the immutability of species, Mueller was a correspondent of Charles Darwin but found the idea of evolution impossible to stomach. His views on this matter do not seem to have done much damage to his reputation as one of the foremost botanists in Australian history. The genus Muellerina Tieghem (Loranthaceae) is named after him, as is the journal of the Melbourne Royal Botanic Gardens, Muelleria, and numerous place names in his adopted country.\n\n\n\nSources:\n\nJ.

Part III\n\nBy Henry Noltie & Mark Watson (continued from Part II)\n\nHorticulturists and Civil Servants\n\nThe designation \u2018professional\u2019, which, during the twentieth century, increasingly came to be used in antithesis to \u2018amateur\u2019, was in a state of flux in the early nineteenth century. While Wallich occupies an interesting position in what is called the professionalisation of science (paid for his botanical work even if seen, at least by the EIC, more in its applied sense than that of \u2018scientific\u2019 research), most of his correspondents and donors of plants and seeds would in a modern sense be denoted \u2018amateur\u2019.\n\nTwo Horticulturists\n\nThe Calcutta Garden\u2019s Plant Collectors, being paid for a single specialised activity, can certainly be considered \u2018professional\u2019, as can two individuals who, at this stage in their lives, can be called horticulturists. After the Collectors and medics, these contributed the largest number of specimens (255) to the Herbarium, of which by far the majority (252) were sent by George Isaac Porter (1800\u20131848) from Penang. The small contribution of Alexander Moon (d 1825), three specimens from Ceylon, would almost certainly have been much greater but for his premature death.\n\nGeorge Porter emerges as a fascinating character, who, at the request of Wallich in August 1819, was transferred from the Bengal Artillery at Dum Dum to be \u2018Overseer\u2019 of the Botanic Garden, though how their paths crossed is unknown. As Porter\u2019s life shows, Wallich clearly had an eye for potential as the gunner was only 18 at the time. Esther Little Bryden also had an eye for potential as she had married Porter in June, the newlyweds acquiring an instant family in the form of four apprentice boys from the Free School who came to live with them at the Garden (see Henry Bruce and William Gomez in Part I) \u2013 they would later have seven children of their own. Porter travelled with his employer on Wallich\u2019s sick leave to Singapore in 1822, but was left in Georgetown, the capital of what was then Prince of Wales Island (later Penang), to establish a botanic garden, which he ran for two years.\n\nGeorgetown overlooking Province Wellesley, Penang, in 1818. Wikipedia\n\nIt must have been during this period that Porter sent the specimens to Calcutta, as in 1824 he became Schoolmaster of the Free School and Parish Clerk of St George\u2019s Church. His family had joined him and his enterprising spirit clearly predominated as Porter gave up the teaching post after two years and entered into a business that prospered. Information that has recently become available on the Internet shows that Porter went on to greater things. In 1835, with his wife and six surviving children, he emigrated to Australia, where he established a business in Sydney. In 1839 he moved to Melbourne where (to his considerable financial advantage) he took an active part in the development of the town, including its cultural (the Mechanics Institution and the beginnings of the Botanic Garden), medical, and ecclesiastical institutions before his relatively early death in 1848.\n\nCeylon did not form part of the EIC territories and from 1798, following its seizure from the Dutch, was administered as a Crown Colony. The island had always been important in terms of its botanical resources, especially cinnamon, and the British established a botanic garden at Colombo. On the recommendation of Sir Joseph Banks, Alexander Moon was appointed as the garden\u2019s superintendent in succession to William Kerr, who had died in 1814 after only two years in post. Little is known of Moon, who arrived in Ceylon in 1817 having previously worked as a gardener at Kew. He is known to have been Scottish and of three boys of that name for whom records survive, all born in Perthshire at around the right time, the one born at Blair Atholl in 1791 is perhaps the most likely.\n\nCeylon in the nineteenth century\n\nIn 1822 Moon moved the existing botanic garden from the lowlands at Kalutara to Peradeniya in the central highlands near Kandy, where it remains to this day. From the remarkable Catalogue of his new garden, beautifully printed in Colombo in 1824, which includes local plant names in Singhalese script and many new species (though mostly not formally described), Moon\u2019s abilities were clearly outstanding. He employed Harmanis de Alwis Seneviratne as an artist (a post he held for 38 years), who fathered a dynasty of distinguished botanical artists. Moon succumbed to fever in 1825, though three of the plants he sent to Wallich for cultivation at Calcutta were made into herbarium specimens, for two of which Moon\u2019s manuscript names were used in the Catalogue: Convolvulus zeylanica (now Ipomoea corymbosa) and Premna procumbens.\n\nThe Civil Servants\n\nOf EIC officials who sent material to Wallich that was preserved in the Herbarium the largest group after the medics was the civil servants. Between them eight of these \u2018amateur\u2019 botanists account for some 196 specimens, and these greatly expand the geographical range covered by the doctors.\n\nThe Nilgiri Hills\n\nIn the Herbarium are large numbers of specimens from South India, but largely in the \u2018incorporated\u2019 herbaria that are not discussed here. The great exception comes from the biodiverse section of the Western Ghats known as the Nilgiri Hills (then spelt in a variety of phonetic variants). By far the most important collection, 148 specimens, was sent to Wallich by Benjamin Noton (1784\u20131869), Assay Master of the Bombay Mint, who was appointed to the EIC in 1812 and retired in 1838.\n\nThe means of his citation, both in the Herbarium and the Catalogue, has led to his being quartered into four different people, bearing the initials \u2018P.J.\u2019, \u2018E.\u2019 and \u2018W.\u2019 in addition to the correct \u2018B.\u2019 This started with Wallich\u2019s misreading as \u2018P.J.\u2019 of a slightly squint and unspooled capital B, written in Noton\u2019s hand, and published as such when Wallich named the beautiful deep-blue \u2018gesner\u2019 Wulfenia notoniana (now Rhynchoglossum notonianum) for him in 1826. The error was later propagated on many tickets in the Herbarium, written in a variety of hands. The \u2018E\u2019 seems to have arisen as a translocation/conflation from the source of the plant \u2018E Nilghiry\u2019 (meaning \u2018from the Nilgiris\u2019) to the collector as \u2018Dom[inus] E. Noton\u2019; and, although Benjamin did have a military brother William in India, the \u2018W\u2019 is probably a corruption of \u2018Mr\u2019 Noton written on some specimen labels.\n\nRhynchoglossum notonianum, painted at Sispara, Nilgiri Hills, 1855, by Mary Cotton (nee Cunliffe). Cleghorn Collection, RBGE\n\nThe reunified Benjamin emerges as a significant contributor not only to the Herbarium, but to the early discovery of the Nilgiri flora. The collections (except for a few from the Deccan much closer to Bombay, probably what is now Karli) are all from the Nilgiris, mostly from Dimhutty, and were collected between December 1824 and June 1826. This might, perhaps, suggest that Noton was then on sick-leave in the Nilgiris and occupying his time with an intellectually stimulating diversion.\n\nThe post of Assay Master of the Indian mints, of which Bombay is the oldest (founded 1672), was usually given to someone with scientific ability (most famously James Prinsep in Calcutta). This is reflected in Noton\u2019s labels some of which are unusual in the Herbarium in the habitat and habit details included (he even noted heterostyly in Hedyotis stylosa, Wall. Cat. 853.1). This makes it all the more surprising that after this restricted period Noton appears entirely to have given up botany. He is, however, known from the literature as a recorder of tidal data from Bombay Harbour and, in collaboration with his lawyer brother George (1789\u20131862), for a long-running series of meteorological records. Benjamin retired, a bachelor, to Chichester where he lived with two maiden sisters, but died at St Leonards-on-Sea.\n\nTwo other individuals each contributed a single specimen from the Nilgiris. Frederick Fenby Clementson (1798\u20131881), at the time the Magistrate and Assistant Collector of Coimbatore, the major town at the southern foot of the Nilgiris, but who had a house in Ooty, sent a handsome pink Lysimachia. Wallich intended to name it for him, but it had an earlier name and is now known as L. leschenaultii.\n\nThe final Nilgiri contributor is the only cleric represented in the Herbarium, the Rev John Hawtayne (c 1791\u20131833), whom Wallich met in Calcutta where his first appointment was as private chaplain to the first Bishop of Calcutta. The diocese was established in 1813, when the EIC was forced to commence an ecclesiastical establishment, and Thomas Middleton was appointed to cover the whole of the East India Company\u2019s territories including Ceylon, SE Asia, parts of Australia and southern Africa. In Calcutta in 1826 the young cleric not only found a wife (Margaret, daughter of the Judge Sir John Franks), but achieved preferment to become the second Archdeacon of Bombay, the Venerable Dr John Hawtayne. Though only a single contribution the plant, as with Clementson\u2019s, is an extremely handsome one, an \u2018acanth\u2019, which survives with Wallich\u2019s name as Thunbergia hawtayneana.\n\nThe Khasia and Jaintia Hills (\u2018Silhet\u2019)\n\nAs already noted in Part I, three of the Garden\u2019s Plant Collectors, William Gomez, Henry Bruce and Francis De Silva were active in the Sylhet area, primarily the Khasia and Jaintia Hills, the botanical riches of which had first been made known by Matthew Richard Smith (1749\u20131819). Little is known of Smith other than what is recorded in the authoritative, but frustratingly unreferenced, \u2018Chapters in the History of Indian Botany\u2019 by Isaac Henry Burkill, Smith is described as a \u2018magistrate\u2019 based at Pundua at the foot of the Khasia Hills, 16 miles north of Sylhet, where he had a \u2018botanic garden\u2019. Ray Desmond, in his \u2018European Discovery of the Indian Flora\u2019, mentions Smith\u2019s superintendence of a teak plantation, and that he was probably given a government allowance to employ \u2018native collectors\u2019.\n\nSmith had first started to communicate with the Calcutta Garden in Roxburgh\u2019s time, and is credited with the introduction of almost 200 plants to it between 1810 and 1813 (he also sent Roxburgh a basket lined with caoutchouc, a natural rubber from Ficus elastica). The fact that he was already, in British-Indian terms, an old man by the time of Wallich\u2019s tenure (Wallich stated that Smith had been in Sylhet for forty years, i.e. since around 1780), and his death in 1819, probably explains why only twenty specimens are attributed to him in the Herbarium. What is inexplicable and surely incorrect, at least in the current usage of the term, is Wallich\u2019s designation in a paper of 1818 of Smith as his \u2018assistant\u2019. A magistrate cannot have been a paid plant collector, and in 1830 Wallich described him, surely more accurately, as a \u2018zealous contributor\u2019 to the Calcutta Garden.\n\nCanton\n\nPerhaps the most important of all items of trade for the EIC at this period was tea, which, even with the shameful use of Indian opium in exchange, was still a major source of expenditure by the Company that it wished to reduce, one means of which would be to grow the plant in India, or to find a local substitute. The Chinese strictly controlled access to their country by foreigners and restricted them to certain ports; the export of tea by the EIC was through Canton.\n\nSyzygium malaccense, by a Cantonese painter commissioned by John Reeves. Wikipedia\n\nIn 1812 John Reeves (1774\u20131856) was appointed Assistant (later becoming Chief) Inspector of Tea for the Company and was based there, where he became interested in both plants and animals and sent many specimens back to both Calcutta and to Europe, many of the plants originating from the Fa-tee nurseries. Of specimens sent to Wallich for cultivation in the Calcutta Garden 16 were made into herbarium specimens that bear Reeves\u2019s name as donor. Two of these Wallich intended to name for him: \u2018Callicarpa Reevesii\u2019 (now C. nudiflora) and \u2018Eupatorium Reevesii\u2019 (now E. chinense).\n\nSingapore\n\nAs noted in Part II Raffles, in 1818, travelled from Bencoolen to Calcutta to persuade Lord Hastings to establish a free port at the mouth of the Straits of Malacca. The following year Raffles sailed with his entourage from Calcutta, depositing his pregnant wife Sophia at Penang in the care of Dr Jack. Raffles continued southwards to negotiate for what was to become Singapore, leaving William Farquhar (of whom more anon, in Part IV) there as its first Resident.\n\nMore than thirty years earlier John Prince (c 1772\u20131848) had been appointed as a Company \u2018writer\u2019 and posted to Fort Marlborough at Bencoolen. Prince spent most of the rest of his career in Sumatra, taking over as Resident on Raffle\u2019s departure from Bencoolen. When this outpost was dissolved Prince was transferred to Singapore, where he held the post of Resident Councillor for fifteen months from August 1826. In Bencoolen Prince had continued to employ Raffles\u2019s Chinese artist A. Kow whom he appears to have taken with him to Singapore, from where Prince sent Wallich both paintings and specimens. Eight of the latter are in the Herbarium, one of which Wallich intended to name \u2018Erycibe Princei\u2019 (now E. tomentosa).\n\nManipur\n\nIt was probably the aftermath of the Burmese war that took David Scott (1786\u20131831) to Manipur, one of the north-eastern states ceded to the EIC. Although Scott contributed only a single specimen to the Herbarium, it is an interesting one and allows his name to be added to the list of distinguished botanists who, like Robert Brown, William Paterson and George Don, were born in the county of Angus. His father was Archibald Scott of Usan; his uncle was the influential EIC Director David Scott of Dunninald.\n\nScott\u2019s Indian diplomatic postings were entirely in the north-east, from where he started to correspond with and send plants to Wallich from Cooch Behar in 1819. Shortly to become the Governor-General\u2019s Agent and Commissioner of Assam, he is remembered today mainly for his founding of Cherrapunji as a sanatorium in what is allegedly the wettest place on earth, and where a monument to his memory survives.\n\nDavid Scott\u2019s monument at Cherrapunji. Wikidata\n\nScott is also one of the players in the story of the discovery of wild tea in north-east India in the 1820s and \u201930s \u2013 a topic then of potentially huge commercial interest if it would allow the breaking of the Chinese tea monopoly. Scott and others were aware that what was probably a wild species of tea grew in the Naga Hills and had sent living plants of it to Calcutta in 1826, but which died. In the same year, in Manipur, he found a plant that was known definitively to be a wild tea and sent some of its leaves, with a covering letter, to James Kyd of Calcutta (Kyd was a shipbuilder and twice-removed cousin of Colonel Robert Kyd, founder of the Calcutta Garden). It was these two leaves (and the letter), of what Wallich intended to call \u2018Camellia scottiana\u2019 that found their way into Herbarium. Now, along with the Naga plants, known as Camellia sinensis var. assamica, it would come to form a major part of the success story of tea in India.\n\nNepal\n\nNepal seems to have held a special fascination for Wallich, possibly in part for its \u2018Shangri La\u2019 mystique (snowy mountains; the difficulty to obtain permission to enter it), but also for its botanical riches. These had first been revealed by Francis Buchanan on his visit of 1802\u20133, and even if only a portion of his remarkable finds had been published (a few species cherry-picked by J.E. Smith, and in condensed form in David Don\u2019s Prodromus of 1825), Wallich would have known of them at first-hand from Buchanan himself.\n\nAs already noted in Part I, the Hon Edward Gardner (1784\u20131861), a Bengal civil servant, had been the Resident in Kathmandu since 1816, where he employed plant collectors whose specimens (living and herbarium) were sent to Wallich in Calcutta. Eventually, through Gardner\u2019s considerable diplomatic skills, the Nepal Court allowed Wallich\u2019s Plant Collectors Blinkworth, Bharat Singh and Francis De Silva to work in the country, and then Wallich himself to visit in 1821/2.\n\nWallich\u2019s own collections, of which there are many from Nepal in the Herbarium, are not discussed here, and the earlier ones of Gardner, his deputy Robert Stuart, and the Plant Collectors (with very few exceptions) do not form part of the Herbarium. These had been sent back to Britain long before 1828, notably to A.B. Lambert and J.E. Smith, under Wallich\u2019s name, and many of them were published in Don\u2019s Prodromus of 1825. One of the first names ever published by Wallich was Daphne (now Edgeworthia) gardneri, in gratitude for Gardner\u2019s prolific dispatches of plants to the Calcutta Garden.\n\nIn his own unique style, the Nepalese collections of Gardner are discussed by Chris Fraser-Jenkins in his equally characteristically titled 2006 book: The first botanical collectors in Nepal, the fern collections of Hamilton, Gardner and Wallich: lost herbaria, a lost botanist, lost letters and lost books somewhat rediscovered. The result is that there is only a single specimen in the Herbarium attributed to Gardner (now called Rubus glandulifer), though his name occurs in connection with seven specimens collected by Wallich in 1821 in the Kathmandu Residency garden at Ranikabag (now Lainchaur).\n\nNext: Part IV.

She became engaged to Maurice No\u00ebl, a soldier who died in the Congo from tropical disease in 1904 before the marriage could take place. B\u00e9raud lived with General Elie No\u00ebl and his wife at Villa Carmen in Algiers. She claimed she developed her psychic ability after the death of her fianc\u00e9.\n\nIn 1905, she held a series of s\u00e9ances at Villa Carmen and sitters were invited. In these s\u00e9ances she claimed to materialize a spirit called Bien Boa, a 300-year-old Brahmin Hindu. However, photographs taken of Boa looked like the figure was made from a large cardboard cutout. In other sittings Charles Richet reported that Boa was breathing, had moved around the room and had touched him. A photograph revealed Boa to be a man dressed up in a cloak, helmet and beard.\n\nA newspaper article in 1906 revealed that an Arab coachman known as Areski, who had previously worked at the villa, had been hired to play the part of Bien Boa and that the entire thing was a hoax. Areski wrote that he made his appearance into the room by a trapdoor. B\u00e9raud also admitted to being involved with the hoax.\n\nIn 1909, B\u00e9raud changed her name to Eva Carri\u00e8re (Eva C) to hide the fraud of her past and began a new career as a psychic. B\u00e9raud had a sexual relationship with a woman 25 years her elder, Juliette Bisson (1861\u20131956), with whom she performed during her seances.\n\nBeraud died in 1943.\n\nInvestigations\n\nCarri\u00e8re's psychic performances were investigated by Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes mystery series. He believed that her performances were genuine and that she was not engaged in any deception. Another famous psychic investigator of the time, Harry Houdini, observed one of her s\u00e9ances and *erted that they were fraudulent. Houdini was never convinced by Carri\u00e8re and likened her performance to a magician's trick, the Hindu needle trick.\n\nThe physician-psychical researcher Gustav Geley investigated Carri\u00e8re and wrote she was a genuine psychic but never-published photographs were discovered after Geley's death which revealed fraudulent activity from the psychic's companion, Juliette Bisson, such as wires seen running from Carri\u00e8re's head supporting fake ectoplasm. Another physician-psychical researcher, Albert von Schrenck-Notzing, investigated Carri\u00e8re and believed the ectoplasm she produced was genuine. The psychiatrist Mathilde Ludendorff wrote that the experiments of Schrenck-Notzing were unscientific and that he had been duped by tricks of Carri\u00e8re. In the Schrenck-Notzing psychic sessions with Carri\u00e8re the scientific controls were scarce and there was evidence that she had freed her hands in the s\u00e9ance room.\n\nCarri\u00e8re has been described as \"perverse and neurotic\". She was well known for running around the s\u00e9ance room naked indulging in sexual activities with her audience. Her companion Juliette Bisson would, during the course of the s\u00e9ance sittings with Schrenck-Notzing, introduce her finger into Eva's * to ensure no \"ectoplasm\" had been loaded there beforehand to fool the investigators, and she would also strip nude at the end of a s\u00e9ance and demanded another full-on gynecological exam. The psychic sessions of Carri\u00e8re with Schrenck-Notzing have been described as adult movieographic. The photographs that were taken during the s\u00e9ances show Carri\u00e8re in the nude emerging from her cabinet and others revealing fake ectoplasm strings hanging from her breasts. Another photograph revealed ectoplasm in the shape of a deflated and disembodied *. According to historian Ruth Brandon, Juliette Bisson and Carri\u00e8re were in a sexual relationship together, and they worked in collaboration with each other to fake the ectoplasm and eroticize their male audience.\n\nIn 1920, anthropologist Eric Dingwall and physician-psychical researcher V. J. Woolley tested Carri\u00e8re in London. They found no evidence of psychic phenomena, discovered that her ectoplasm was made from chewed paper, and said \"the s\u00e9ances proved negative\". Ruth Brandon wrote that Carri\u00e8re produced some of her effects by regurgitation, hiding her ectoplasm in the s\u00e9ance cabinet and using her secret accomplice Juliette Bisson.\n\nAccording to Harry Price, the photographs of her ectoplasm taken with Schrenck-Notzing looked artificial and two-dimensional, made from cardboard and newspaper portraits, and that there were no scientific controls, as both her hands were free. In 1920, Carri\u00e8re was investigated by the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) in London. She was also investigated in 1922 and the result of the tests were negative.\n\nIn 1954, Donald West wrote that Carri\u00e8re's ectoplasm was made of cut-out paper faces from magazines and newspapers, on which fold marks could sometimes be seen from the photographs. A photograph of Carri\u00e8re taken from the back of the ectoplasm face revealed it was made from a magazine cut out, complete with the letters \"Le Miro\". The two-dimensional face had been clipped from the French magazine Le Miroir. Back issues of the magazine also matched some of Carri\u00e8re's ectoplasm faces. In 1913, a Miss Barkley in an article in the newspaper Neue Wiener Tagblatt exposed the fraud of Carri\u00e8re:\n\nMiss Eva prepared the heads before every s\u00e9ance, and endeavoured to make them unrecognizable. A clean-shaven face was decorated with a beard. Grey hairs became black curls, a broad forehead was made into a narrow one. In spite of all her endeavours, she could not obliterate certain characteristic lines.\n\nCarri\u00e8re used cut out faces of Woodrow Wilson, King Ferdinand of Bulgaria, French president Raymond Poincar\u00e9, and the actress Mona Delza.\n\nAlso in 1954, Rudolf Lambert, an SPR member, published details of fraud which had been covered up by many early members of the Ins*ute Metapsychique International (IMI). Lambert had studied Gustav Geley's files on Eva Carri\u00e8re, and discovered photographs taken by her companion Juliette Bisson depicting fraudulent ectoplasm. Various \"materializations\" were artificially attached to Eva's hair by wires. Geley never published his discovery. Eug\u00e9ne Osty, the director of the Ins*ute, and members Jean Meyer, Albert von Schrenck-Notzing and Charles Richet all knew about the fraudulent photographs, but were firm believers in spirituality phenomena, so demanded the scandal be kept secret.\n\nGallery\n\nThe spirit Bien Boa, which was discovered to be a dressed-up man\n\nCarri\u00e8re with fake ectoplasm made from the French magazine Le Miroir\n\nCarri\u00e8re during a s\u00e9ance\n\nCarri\u00e8re with fake ectoplasm\n\nSee also\n\nSpirituality\n\nSpiritualism\n\nPsychokinesis\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nRuth Brandon.

They were incorporated into the historical herbarium of the Jussieu family but are now stored and curated separately. The first systematic effort to constitute an \u2018herbarium\u2019 was, however, that of Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (1656\u20131708)3,4, who initially acquired specimens from France, and particularly from around Paris, to serve as a working base for his \u00c9lements de Botanique5, later translated into Latin under the title \u2018Institutiones rei herbariae\u20196. Tournefort\u2019s herbarium was subsequently enriched with his own collections from the Middle East and was personally donated by him to King Louis XIV3,7,8.\n\nIt was during the reign of King Louis XV that interest in botany significantly increased in France. The king\u2019s passion for the sciences, combined with the influence within his Court of scientists such as Guy-Crescent Fagon (1638\u20131718) and Louis Guillaume Le Monnier (1717\u20131799), created a thriving climate for botany at the Jardin royal. The path initiated by Tournefort was followed by scientists such as S\u00e9bastien Vaillant (1669\u20131722), Antoine de Jussieu (1686\u20131758), Bernard de Jussieu (1699\u20131777), Jean Baptiste de Lamarck (1744\u20131829) and Antoine Laurent de Jussieu (1748\u20131836), each of whom constituted a personal herbarium while also contributing to the emergence of modern botany. In parallel with the development of these natural history collections (referred to in French as a \u2018cabinet d\u2019histoire naturelle\u2019), the king funded several expeditions spanning the globe with a declared aim of conducting scientific studies. These included expeditions by Joseph de Jussieu (1704\u20131779) to South America, Andr\u00e9 Michaux (1746\u20131802) to the Middle-East and then to North America, Jean Baptiste Christian Fus\u00e9e-Aublet (1720\u20131778) to what is now French Guiana, Ren\u00e9 Louiche Desfontaines (1750\u20131833) to the Atlas mountains, Louis Antoine de Bougainville (1729\u20131811) and Philibert Commerson (1727\u20131773) around the world, and Jacques-Julien Houtou de La Billardi\u00e8re (1755\u20131834) to Lebanon3,9. Some of the specimens collected during these trips were included in Le Monnier\u2019s private herbarium, which was later acquired by Jules Paul Benjamin Delessert (1773\u20131847), whose herbarium is now kept in Geneva (G). Duplicates of some of these specimens can also be found in Vaillant herbarium, now housed at P3.\n\nDuring the French Revolution, the Jardin royal and its collections were nationalized and in 1793 became the Mus\u00e9um national d\u2019histoire naturelle. Desfontaines, while holding the Chair of Botany at the Mus\u00e9um, organised the National Herbarium (in the modern sense of the word) between 1793 and 1802 (refs 3,10), which comprised a general herbarium based on Vaillant\u2019s collections enriched with Fagon\u2019s herbarium3. For historical reasons Desfontaines kept Pitton de Tournefort\u2019s collection separate. At the time the collection included about 25,000 specimens, including both vascular and non-vascular plants now housed in both parts of the National Herbarium (P and PC). By 1808 the collections had outgrown the Mus\u00e9um\u2019s Cabinet d\u2019Histoire naturelle and were transferred to the Maison L\u00e9ger, a building situated close to the H\u00f4tel de Magny within the modern day Jardin des Plantes, which had been purchased in 1802 but was demolished in 1878 (ref. 1).\n\nDuring the first half of the 19th century many societies were established for the exchange of herbarium specimens. They persisted for a century and grew into one of the major sources of material for P. In parallel, from the beginning of the 19th century through the middle of the 20th century, material was received form missionaries and \u2018correspondents\u2019, botanists based in the field who collected at least in part for the MNHN and sent specimens to Paris. With the start of colonisation in the 1850s, military and colonial administrators also contributed greatly to P. Together these added significantly to the size and richness of today\u2019s herbarium. By 1835, due to the tremendous increase in the size of the collection, it again became necessary to relocate the P herbarium, which was transferred to a newly built \u2018Gallery of Botany and Mineralogy\u2019, likewise within the Jardin des Plantes1.\n\nThe beginning of the 20th century was a period of rapid growth for P, with major donations enriching its holdings (Table 1). By 1935, the collections, which contained more than 4 million specimens, were stored in 4 separate buildings and most were inaccessible for research. Thanks to the pugnacity of Paul Henri Lecomte (1856\u20131934), who held the Chair of Botany starting in 1906, and a donation from the Rockefeller Foundation, the present herbarium building was constructed to host the collections and facilitate their study1. The collection was dramatically enriched with material from Madagascar during the period when Jean-Henri Humbert (1887\u20131967) held the Chair of Botany, from 1931 to 1958, reflecting his strong interest in the island\u2019s flora, which was sustained by his successors, including Andr\u00e9 Aubr\u00e9ville (1897\u20131984), who held the Chair from 1958 to 1971 and was also interested of all of the other French-speaking territories (former colonies)10.\n\nTable 1 Major acquisitions at P. Full size table\n\nAfter World War II and the subsequent period of decolonisation, the rate at which the Paris collection grew started to decrease. Field work conducted by MNHN botanists and exchanges between herbaria became the main sources of new acquisitions. The main activities of botanists at P remained focused on the floras of the former colonies and French overseas territories, of which the holdings at P are particularly strong. The closure of several botanical institutions within France that were unable to maintain collections for financial reasons provided another source of material for P (Table 1).\n\nBy the end of the 20th century the collections had outgrown the capacity of the original storage facilities in the 1935 building and the decision was made in 2005 to undertake a complete renovation of the herbarium in order to increase its capacity and improve specimen storage conditions. Starting in 2008 the collections were moved into newly installed compactors, making it possible to integrate the accumulated backlog of some 830,000 previously unmounted specimens and accommodate new specimen acquisition for the next three decades. This operation included a comprehensive resorting of the entire collection into a linear sequence following the APG III classification system11. Concomitantly a mass digitisation project was undertaken1,12,13, which led to the integration of high resolutions images of all specimens into a dedicated database as described below, accompanied by basic information (accession number, family, genus, specific epithet, geographic region of origin and image) for those that had not already been fully databased.\n\nDatabasing of the physical collection\n\nThe first discussions about biodiversity databases began at P during the mid-1970s and the first tool specifically designed to manage herbarium information was developed during the mid-1980s with the creation of the Vaillant database14,15. Commissioned in 1993, the current herbarium database, named Sonnerat (Data Citation 1), was developed to serve as a computerised catalogue of the P collections. It was named after Pierre Sonnerat (1748\u20131814), a French naturalist, illustrator and explorer who identified, described and illustrated numerous species, mainly from Asia and Mauritius. The database has now developed into the repository for the other herbarium collections of the MNHN (registered in the index herbarorium as PC & PAT16) as well as for the network of herbaria in French-speaking countries and the partners in the e-ReColNat project (see below). Sonnerat serves as the core source for data delivered by other portals (e.g., GBIF, e-ReColNat). As with all of the other shared collection databases at the MNHN, Sonnerat is a relational database and was developed under Oracle. The main tables constituting Sonnerat, with the header of the conlumns they contain and the relations between them are presented in a Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram in Fig. 1. To manage the data and facilitate their dissemination over the web, a specific tool was developed under Java starting in 1997 by the Centre Informatique du Mus\u00e9um. It was initially named JCIM (for Java [solution] of the Centre Informatique du Mus\u00e9um) and later renamed JACIM in order to avoid internal confusion with the name of the Ichtyological collection database (GICIM). Updates and upgrades are performed internally by a dedicated team in the Direction des Services Informatiques.\n\nFigure 1: Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram of the main tables of the Sonnerat database. It presents the column header disposition through the tables, and the tables relations. Full size image\n\nData are published online through the Data Portal of the MNHN17. Additionally a Darwin Core archive (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/index.htm) is regularly generated and available on GBIF data portal (Data Citation 1). As for every collection database, the archive is generated using the Occurrence core. All field definitions (Darwin Core Terms) are available on the Darwin Core website (at: http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm#occurrenceindex). The archive itself is constitute of 4 text files containing the structural information (the occurrence core, which here comes together with 3 extensions: multimedia, identifier and identification), an eml file containing the data themselves, and an xml file doing the link in between the source database (here Sonnerat) and the archive.\n\nConsidering the sheer size of the collection at P, its digitisation has been a tremendous task and indeed this process is still ongoing to deal with the holdings that remain to be scanned (1% of the total; an estimated 10% of the collection remains to be databased).\n\nThe first databasing efforts were concentrated on the day to day activities of the herbarium, in particular recording specimens being sent on loan and new accessions related to studies conducted by MNHN researchers. Initially between 20,000 and 30,000 new entries were made per year, but since initiation of the mass digitisation of the collection carried out under the Renobota project starting in 2008, work on the database has changed radically and become a key tool for herbarium management, focusing mainly on updating and enriching the data and in particular adding collection information to those entries that have not yet been fully databased. Moreover, during the Renobota project only a single entry was made per specimen, even for those on which more than one distinct collection has been mounted (this is particularly true for the Cosson herbarium). A Nikon D800 camera mounted on a Kaiser R1 copy stand system is currently being used to image all new specimens and for image updates.\n\nIn order to increase the rate of databasing in addition to this routine herbarium work, systematic data entry efforts were developed from 2001 onwards, involving numerous skilled personnel (Supplementary File 1). Continental African Asteraceae, Malagasy Fabaceae-Caesalpinioideae and Papilionoideae, as well as specimens from Mayotte Island and the Union of the Comoros were treated during this process15,18,19.\n\nThe substantial dataset that is available today17 (Data Citation 1) was also achieved through the MNHN\u2019s active involvement in several national and international databasing projects, each focusing on distinct aspects of data acquisition corresponding to different uses of the rich botanical collection housed at P. As shown in Fig. 2, the most notable of these projects, in terms of the amount of data captured, is the Renobota project, which would not have been possible without input from precursor projects, and for which much work remains to be done in order to achieve full digitisation of the collection. The main projects based at P are presented below and their output is fully integrated in the general dataset (Data Citation 1).\n\nFigure 2 Growth of the P dataset (number of specimen entries) per year according to project. Full size image\n\nCyperaceae from tropical Asia and tropical Americas digitising project (2001\u20132003)\n\nFunding: Institut Klorane, MNHN\n\nDigitising for the Cyperaceae from tropical Asia and tropical Americas project focused on all Cyperaceae specimens from these regions. Over 8,000 specimens from Asia and 23,000 from America were treated over a three year period.\n\nGlobal biodiversity information facility project (2002\u20132004)\n\nFunding: GBIF France\n\nThe GBIF project was the first global databasing effort undertaken at P. It focused on tropical material of two families: over 34,000 specimens of Orchidaceae and 16,800 specimens of Solanaceae where databased, and a search for type specimens was implemented.\n\nMillennium seed bank project (2004\u20132008)\n\nFunding: Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew\n\nThis project, which focused on databasing specimens from Mali, Burkina Faso and Madagascar, was conducted in collaboration with the Kew Millennium seed bank. A total of 31,000 specimens from 120 families (45 for Madagascar and 75 for Burkina Faso and Mali) were fully databased, including post-facto calculated geolocation data.\n\nGlobal plants projects (African plant initiative 2004\u20132006, latin American plant initiative 2007\u20132008, global plant initiative 2009\u20132015)\n\nFunding: Andrew W. Mellon Foundation\n\nThese three projects funded by the Mellon Foundation aimed at databasing and producing high-resolution (600 dpi) scans of all the type specimens held in herbaria throughout the world, including P. The first phase, the African Plant Initiative (API), which operated from 2004 to 2006, focused on the African type specimens. It was then followed by the Latin American Plant Initiative (LAPI), from 2007 to 2008, and finally the Global Plant Initiative (GPI) followed from 2009 to 2015, which sought to scan all types from throughout the world, with the exception of Europe.\n\nThese three projects resulted in the databasing and digitisation of 185,937 specimens (including 177,045 type specimens and 8,892 specimens of nomenclatural interest), amongst which 45,500 types were located for the first time in the collection, requiring verification. For most of these specimens, the digitisation process was done with Herbscan units, in which a scanner is mounted upside-down, which were provided by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. For thick specimens as well as especially fragile material, high definition Leaf photographic equipment mounted on a motorized bench was used. A 300 dpi copy of each image is linked to the data on the MNHN server (Data Citation 1), while a 600 dpi image, together with the most important data, is duplicated on the Global Plants on JSTOR portal (materials contributed by the Mus\u00e9um National d\u2019Histoire Naturelle (P) available at: http://plants.jstor.org/partner/P).\n\nHerbier Lamarck project (2004)\n\nFunding: Centre national de la Recherche scientifique\n\nThis project sought to digitise the totality of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck\u2019s herbarium, in its current composition, as part of a project portal dedicated to Lamarck\u2019s scientific legacy. All of the ca. 19,000 specimens were scanned after having been given an accession number, and are available on a dedicated portal (http://www.lamarck.cnrs.fr/herbier.php). When a record for an accession in the Lamarck herbarium also exists in Sonnerat, a link is automatically provided. The data from the Lamarck portal will be fully integrated into the P dataset in the near future (Data Citation 1).\n\nAuguste de Saint-Hilaire virtual herbarium project (2009)\n\nFunding: Instituto de Botanica de S\u00e3o Paulo(IBt), Centro de Refer\u00eancia em Informa\u00e7\u00e3o Ambiental (CRIA ), Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo (Fapesp), Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Vitae, Institut des Herbiers Universitaires, CLF, Clermont-Ferrand\n\nThis project, conducted remotely in Brazil, concentrates on digitising the herbarium material collected by Auguste de Saint-Hilaire (1779\u20131853) in Brazil from 1816 to 1822. Specimen data are presented in a dedicated portal under the form of a virtual herbarium, where the sheets are linked to the relevant pages of Saint-Hilaire\u2019s field notebooks. Data are harvested twice a day from Sonnerat by the virtual herbarium. To date P has contributed over 9,300 specimens, and the rate of data capture has increased significantly since 2012 mainly due to the databasing efforts of the Reflora project20 (available at: http://hvsh.cria.org.br/hv).\n\nRenobota project (2008\u20132013)\n\nFunding: Mus\u00e9um national d\u2019histoire naturelle, Paris (MNHN)\n\nRenobota is the abbreviated name used to designate the massive digitisation of the herbarium specimens at P as part of the MNHN\u2019s comprehensive renovation project of the National Herbarium. This integrated project, carried out from 2008 to 2013, involved renovation of both the collection and the building (doubling its storage capacity, offering new working space, and providing controlled environmental condition for specimen storage).\n\nWork on the collections comprised two distinct and complementary operations. The first involved processing the huge backlog of material accumulated over decades, including unmounted and unfiled specimens that had long been unavailable for consultation and research. This material was sorted by the herbarium staff and ca. 120,000 duplicate specimens were dispatched to botanical institutions around the world, with priority given to the countries in which the collections had been made. A private company, Grahal, was contracted during a four year period to carry out this operation, which resulted in the mounting of 830,000 herbarium sheets of vascular plants. The specimens were arranged by family and packed, awaiting their incorporation into the general collection as part of the second operation.\n\nThe second step aimed to digitise and rearrange the entire holdings of vascular plants at P. Oce Business Services France was contracted to carry out a multi-objective process at a dedicated site selected for this specific purpose. The objectives included: integration of the newly mounted specimens among the remainder of the collection, reconditioning with new genus folders, mass digitisation of all specimens, rearrangement according to the APG III classification system and, within each family, to a new sequence of generic and of geographic areas. Each sheet received a barcoded accession number label (if one had not previously been given) and was then scanned, with the exception of type specimens (stored in red folders, which had already been treated as part of the Global Plants Science projects; see above) and Vaillant specimens (stored in green folders and treated in part by the GPI team). Essential data were captured (accession number, geographic region and taxon name), which is the basic information necessary to link the virtual collection (i.e., the scanned images) to the physical collection (the specimens). The resulting data and associated images were then uploaded into the Sonnerat database12,13. Over 5,000,000 specimens were digitised and for more than 90% of them, a new database entry was created in Sonnerat. The project resulted in a massive number of specimen entries, each associated with an image, but only limited collection label data were captured (Data Citation 1).\n\nAs a result of the Renobota project, the operating procedures at P as well as access for the botanical community to the herbarium\u2019s facilities and collections have been significantly improved, although managing the process of updating both the virtual and real herbaria remains a considerable challenge.\n\nLes Herbonautes project (2012-present)\n\nFunding: MNHN, Fondation de la Maison de la Chimie, e-ReColNAt (ANR-11-INBS-0004), Mus\u00e9um national d\u2019histoire naturelle, Paris (MNHN)\n\nLes Herbonautes (http://lesherbonautes.mnhn.fr/) is an ongoing participatory science project aimed at transcribing the information written on herbarium labels through a dedicated web-based portal. Images are shown to registered web volunteers through thematic projects (called \u2018missions\u2019) designed by researchers curating collections and focusing on scientific research needs. The web volunteers (called \u2018herbonauts\u2019) transcribe, for each image, data on the collection locality, date, collector, collection number, identification, and geolocation, as requested. The data quality is cross-checked: in order to be validated, the same data must be captured independently by several different contributors. Tests of data quality have shown comparable levels between data obtained using this method and professional standards. Since the opening of the website in December 2012, 37 missions have been launched, 35 of which have been completed. As of September 9, 2015, a total of 2,181 contributors have examined 119,956 specimens, providing 1,685,738 entries (i.e., responses to a single question). After three years, the public\u2019s enthusiasm for databasing herbarium specimens remains high, although a certain seasonality can be seen: more contributions are made in winter than summer (Fig. 3).\n\nFigure 3 Monthly contributions to Les Herbonautes from its launch (December 2012) to the end of September 2015. Full size image\n\nThe initial version of the Les Herbonautes portal was developed as part of the Renobota project and a Version 2, developed through the e-ReColNat project, was released in January 2016. This new version allows for better follow up by both the project managers and the public. The data generated through Les Herbonautes can now be transferred to the Sonnerat database (Data Citation 1) through the ReColNat portal.\n\nOpen Up! project (2013)\n\nFunding: Europeana grant for OpenUp!\n\nThe OpenUp! project aims to provide images from natural history museum collections to the Europeana portal (http://www.europeana.eu/). The images, selected based on criteria for potential interest to the broad public, were chosen from among those generated during the Renobota project. In parallel, curation of the entire set of the taxonomic data in the Sonnerat database was performed (Data Citation 1). Data from 385,286 specimens of P were provided to the Europeana portal (available at: http://www.europeana.eu/).\n\nReflora project (2013\u20132016)\n\nFunding: Conseil National pour la Recherche (CNPq)-Vale\n\nThe Reflora project aims to create a portal giving access to data from every botanical collection relating to the Brazilian flora. All of the ca. 300,000 images produced by the Renobota project from specimens collected in Brazil are being sent to the Herbarium Collection of the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden, where teams of botanists and students are databasing them. Data are then sent back to P for incorporation into Sonnerat (Data Citation 1). To date, some 130,000 images have been provided to Reflora and data derived from 30,000 of these have been added to the P dataset. The global data resulting from the Reflora project are available on a dedicated virtual herbarium (http://reflora.jbrj.gov.br/reflora/herbarioVirtual/).\n\nAs part of this project, and in partnership with the National Museum of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, a virtual herbarium was established that is dedicated to the specimens collected by Auguste Glaziou (http://glaziou.cria.org.br), build on the model of the Auguste de Saint-Hilaire virtual herbarium.\n\ne-ReColNat project (2013\u20132019)\n\nFunding: PIA Agence Nationale de la Recherche-11-INBS-0004, Mus\u00e9um national d\u2019histoire naturelle.\n\nThis project aims to facilitate online access to the biodiversity collections held in France. At P, it consists mainly of a quality control monitoring of the Sonnerat database, while also developing new accessibility tools. A platform (Explore, available at: https://explore.recolnat.org/), bringing together resources from most of the French natural history collections and allowing an advanced browsing and data enrichment process, is under development. Explore will allow enrichment of the databased specimens through participatory science projects, directly through the platform and through a dedicated version of Les Herbonautes.\n\nAdditionally, using the structure created by e-ReColNat, a backlog of ca. 70,000 specimens from P have been digitised by Picturae at Heiloo21, after having been mounted. These mainly include new material received recently, loans returned too late to be included in the Renobota project, and some material left over from the earlier mounting initiative.\n\nAdditional databasing\n\nMost of the databasing efforts described above concerned the general herbarium collection at P. The standing-alone collections housed at MNHN (referred to as \u2018historical collections\u2019) were not part of the Renobota digitisation process. However, some were treated in part during various projects, as follows:\n\n- The Humboldt & Bonpland Herbarium was fully digitised and databased by the GPI team. 3525 entries are available in the P dataset.\n\n- The Lamarck herbarium was completely digitised during a dedicated project. Data remain to be uploaded to Sonnerat. To date, 4053 specimens are available in the P dataset.\n\n- The American specimens of the Jussieu herbarium, estimated to represent ca. 10% of the material in this collection, are being digitised and databased as part of the Reflora project; 13,500 specimens (including the American material and some other specimens) have so far been databased.\n\n- Various specimens from other stand-alone collections were databased as part of the regular specimen loan procedure. The most significant of these are 543 specimens from the herbarium of L\u00e9on Mercurin (1898\u20131994), 230 from the Michaux herbarium, 133 from the Tournefort herbarium, 19 from Desfontaines Flora Atlantica herbarium, 18 from the herbarium of Elias Magloire Durand (1794\u20131873), and 6 from the Adanson herbarium.\n\nData published through GBIF: http://collections.mnhn.fr/ipt/resource.do?r=mnhn-p (Data Citation 1)\n\nSonnerat database taxonomic coverage\n\nDuring the Renobota project, the organisation of the collections at P was modified to follow the linear family sequence based on the APG III classification11. However, the placement of some specimens could not be updated at that time, and for various reasons, some collections are still filed under the same family as prior to the renovation, which followed the index developed by Th\u00e9ophile Durand (1855\u20131912) based on Bentham & Hooker\u2019s classification22.\n\nThe P herbarium includes all vascular plant orders. A recent comparison (as of 19 October 2015) with The Plant List v.1.1 (http://www.theplantlist.org/) showed that 34% of the accepted species names are represented by one or more specimens, and an analysis of the non-matching data indicated that this was due to errors both in the P dataset and The Plant List. Once these issues have been resolved and remaining material at P is databased, coverage is estimated to be between 33 and 40% of all vascular plant species. As depicted in Fig. 4, the eudicots constitute the largest portion of the collection, with ca. 72%, followed by the monocots (ca. 17%) and the pteridophytes (ca. 9%).\n\nFigure 4: Taxonomic coverage of the P dataset in term of specimens. Following the APG IV classification for Angiosperms33 (entries through 24/03/2016). Full size image\n\nP dataset spatial coverage\n\nThe collections at P, which are global in scope, have been divided into 12 sectors based on place of collection to facilitate curation, access and regional studies (Fig. 5). The distribution of the accessions among these sectors is heterogeneous (Table 2). The FRA sector, corresponding to metropolitan France, is one of the largest, with ca. 970,000 specimens. The two continents with the largest number of specimens, Europe and Africa, have each been sub-divided into distinct sectors. For Europe, this dates back to the donation of de Candolle\u2019s collection8 and to the creation of the France herbarium, which has evolved into the FRA sector, separate from the EUR sector, which encompasses the rest of Europe. The European flora comprises the largest portion of the P herbarium, with 29% of the holdings, a situation shared with other natural history collections at the MNHN23. Somewhat later, Africa was also sub-divided based on biogeographic considerations into AFT (Tropical Africa), AFM (Madagascar and the Western Indian Ocean islands) and AFN (Northern Africa), which together represent ca. 25% of the collections at P. The taxonomic composition within each sector is indicated in Table 2.\n\nFigure 5 Breakdown by geographic sectors at P. Full size image\n\nTable 2 Number of specimens per continent and geographic sector, and taxonomic coverage for each continent. Full size table\n\nTo date, 16% of the specimens included in Sonnerat are fully databased, resulting from a wide range of efforts (see detailed projects above). The percentages of specimens from which data are fully captured differ from one geographic sector to another (Table 2). All of the remaining specimens processed during the Renobota project are databased at least for family, genus and species names (when available), along with main geographical sector, but not for information related to the individual specimen (collector name, collection number, date, locality, etc.).\n\nEurope, France and Northern Africa have a very low percentage of fully databased specimens. Similarly, the very low rate for cultivated material reflects the scientific focus of P botanists, which is primarily on wild plants. By the time the Reflora project is completed, data capture for specimens from Brazil should increase the rate for America significantly. Oceania is divided into two sub-sectors: CAL for New Caledonia and OCE for the rest of the region. The P herbarium contains at least 200,000 specimens from New Caledonia, but a technical issue makes it impossible to calculate the exact number, so the following numbers are provided for Oceania as a whole. The level of databasing for this sector is comparatively high since P botanists are working on the Polynesian24,25 and New Caledonian floras, which account for most of the material available. The collections from Madagascar are among the most studied and actively curated at P, and have been since the early 20th century. As a result they are the most extensively databased (full data have been captured for 35%). Special efforts have been made on the collections from the circum-austral islands, which are relatively small in number (85% have been fully databased). Finally, the stand-alone (historical) collections were not treated as part of the Renobota imaging process so the only records are those resulting from projects that fully captured the associated data. As a consequence, the very low proportion for which data entry is not complete (0.02%) corresponds to background error rates in databasing.\n\nBecause of the heterogeneity in the proportion of fully databased specimens among geographic sectors, the distribution by country shown in Fig. 6a, which takes into consideration only these records, very likely does not reflect the true situation for the entire collection at P. For example, European and Northern African countries are under-represented while Madagascar and Brazil are over-represented. This map nevertheless provides important information on the geographical provenance of the specimens in the P herbarium. To facilitate interpreting this figure, we have calculated a factor of representativeness for each sector by dividing the average rate of full data capture per sector by the overall average for the collection as a whole:\n\n- Within Europe, metropolitan France is under-represented, as indicated by a factor of 0.52, and the rest of Europe by a factor of 0.38. However, excluding metropolitan France, the Mediterranean flora is better covered at P than northern Europe.\n\n- Within Africa, Madagascar is over represented by a factor 2.22, tropical continental Africa is close to the overall average with a factor 1.03, and northern Africa is significantly under represented, with a factor 0.37. Specimens from the former French colonies are well represented, but it is notable that South Africa, Ethiopia and Tanzania are as well.\n\n- For the Americas, the factor is 1.12, indicating that this sector is over-represented among the records for which data have been fully captured. While there is no way to calculate the factor for Brazil, it will surely exceed the value for the sector as a whole given that several projects are focusing on its flora.\n\n- For Asia, the collections are slightly over-represented, with a factor of 1.09. The value for former Indochina is expected to be the highest, whereas those for India, Japan and Siberia (most of the databased specimens from Russian at P were collected in Siberia) as well as China are expected to be lower than the average for the sector. The expected over-representation for Indochina reflects the historical relationship with this region and the flora project coordinated at P.\n\n- For Oceania, the factor of 1.50 indicates an over-representation, most of which reflects the impacts of major flora projects for French Polynesia and New Caledonia, areas from which the collections at P are particularly rich. P is also noteworthy for its rich folding of material from Australia.\n\n- For the circum-autral territories, the collections are over represented, as indicated by a factor of 5.54, although the small sample size makes it difficult to interpret this figure.\n\nFigure 6: Geographical and chronological composition of P dataset. (a). Geographical origin of vascular plant specimen in P (based on the 759,568 specimens bearing a valid country code (ISO 3166)) (b).

Full size image\n\nThe P herbarium is very rich in type specimens from throughout the world, a large proportion of which were systematically databased during the three Global Plants Projects. The distribution of types by country of collection (Fig. 6b) largely confirms the general trend observed for the collection as a whole. However, given that no systematic searches were made to detect previously unrecognised types in the African sector during the API project (only types already placed in distinctive red folders were considered), a significant but unknown number of types remains to be found among the continental African collections. Because none of projects supported by the Mellon Foundation concerned the European flora, collections from this sector are underrepresented in this map. Additionally, even though the GPI team conducted a systematic search for type specimens from America, Asia and Oceania, the Reflora project has shown that a systematic review of the collections from a given country by specialists will surely reveal additional, previously unrecognised types.\n\nBy comparing the country of collection (as indicated by the country isocode in the fully databased portion of the herbarium) with the broad geographical sector assigned to the entire collection, an estimate can be made of the geographical error rate, including mismatches, invalid country codes, and unassigned sector codes (even though in principle each specimen must be assigned to a sector). However, because it is sometimes difficult to determine the country from which a specimen was collected, especially for older material, empty country codes were not considered as errors. We obtained a correct match for over 97% of the records.\n\nTemporal coverage (year 1558-present)\n\nThe oldest plants preserved at P are sheets made out of the flower garlands found on the mummy of Ramesses II, which were sent for study to the MNHN4. These few extremely old specimens are, however, exceptions, as are those held in Jehan Girault\u2019s collection, which dates from 1558. The number of specimens in the collection began to increase significantly during the late 17th century, but it is often impossible to determine the precise date of collection for this oldest material as this information was almost never mentioned by collectors on specimens made before the 19th century.\n\nThe number of specimens at P according to collection date (Fig. 6c) shows an increase starting in the 1820s. This is in large part related to the activities of French missionaries and later to the exploration that preceded colonisation and formation of botanical societies, which sent duplicates to the MNHN and those who held other collections that are now kept at P. The large number of specimens recorded for 1816 is an artefact of the fact that Auguste de Saint-Hilaire\u2019s specimens, which were collected between 1816 and 1821, were all entered as 1816 because no precise date is generally indicated.\n\nThree major wars impacted the growth of the collections at P during the last two centuries:\n\n- the Franco-Prussian War (1870), followed by the French Commune (1871)\n\n- the First World War (1914\u20131918)\n\n- the Second World War (1939\u20131945)\n\nWar is not particularly compatible with botany, although botanical activities never totally ceased during times of conflict26. The decrease in the number of collections added per year at P at the end of the 1960s parallels documented decreases at other historical natural history collections in Australia, Germany and France23,27,28. In Paris this can be linked to decolonisation, but also to a decrease of funding for activities that generate material deposited in herbaria and to a societal perception of such collections as unimportant or unnecessary23,27,28. The apparent renewal of interest since the 1990s, as suggested by the increase in growth at P, might be linked with the development of the database Sonnerat and the systematic databasing of new collections made by MNHN botanists, facilitating the production of specimen labels, which could this explain the apparent higher rate of collection during these years. The lower rate of databasing of specimens in the last decade is seen among many natural history collections database23 and might be linked to the fact that significant numbers of specimens still being studied have not yet been incorporated into herbaria.\n\nFigure 6d shows the same information specifically for type specimens up to the end of World War II, after which a drop in the proportion of types in the collection can be seen, even though the worldwide number of accepted taxa described per year has increased. As depicted in Fig. 6e, a high portion of the taxa described in the first century after Linnaeus\u2019 work are represented at P, and this proportion has declined ever since.. Moreover, over the last five to six decades, a growing number of species are filed in the Paris herbarium under a synonym rather than the currently accepted name, which in large part reflects the increasing amount of curatorial effort needed to ensure that the collection is regularly updated as taxonomic changes are made.\n\nDatabased samples collection and preservation methods\n\nVascular plants collection (P) of the Mus\u00e9um national d\u2019histoire naturelle (MNHN\u2014Paris), active databasing period: 1993\u20132015 (Data Citation 1).\n\nSpecimen preservation methods\n\nThe collection consists in dry specimens mounted on herbarium sheets, dry wood samples, dry fruits and seed, samples preserved in alcohol, tissues and pollen mounted on microscope slides, tissue samples preserved in silica-gel.\n\nIt is mostly composed of herbarium sheets, which are divided into a general systematic collection (5.7 million specimens, 95% databased), ordered according to the APG III classification for the Angiosperms, and into several stand-alone collections of historical importance (estimated at 150,000 specimens, 14% databased), which are curated separately. In addition to the herbarium, P also includes some complementary collections:\n\n- Histology (70,000 slides, not yet databased, 20,000 of which came from the collection of Philippe van Tieghem)\n\n- Palynology (45,000 slides, not yet databased, ca. 12,000 of which have vouchers in the P herbarium)\n\n- Specimens preserved in alcohol (estimated to comprise 15,000 specimens, 4% databased)\n\n- Wood collection (estimated at 14,000 specimens, 83% databased). An significative curation effort, including data management, is currently being made on this particular collection\n\n- Dry fruit and seed collection (estimated to include 28,000 specimens, 6% databased)\n\n- Samples preserved in silica-gel for molecular studies (ca. 7,300 samples, 100% databased)\n\nSampling protocol\n\nNo single sampling protocol can be distinguished, the acquisition of the collection tremendously varies depending on the institute from which the sample is derived or the collector. An ideal label for those specimens consists in: taxonomic information, collection information (who?; where?, when?) completed by GPS coordinates and projection system, descriptive or ecological data which cannot physically be preserved on the specimen, ethnobotanical information (vernacular names, uses). Moreover, for most of the older, historical specimens, no information is available on the sampling methodology used.\n\nUse of the dataset\n\nThe P dataset (Data Citation 1) is widely used for a great range of botanical or organisms interactions researches encompassing systematics, evolution, phylogenetic diversity, conservation biology, taxonomy as well as monographs and flora treatments18,19,24,25,29\u201332."}, {"url": "https://www.gbif.org/dataset/b5cdf794-8fa4-4a85-8b26-755d087bf531", "page_content": "The vascular plants collection (P) at the Herbarium of the Mus\u00e9um national d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN - Paris)\n\nCitation MNHN, Chagnoux S (2023).

Each specimen, as a voucher of a species found in nature, carries biological data (in its genes, tissues, traits, biochemistry) and metadata (on its label or attached field notes) providing contextual information on the location, date, habitat and ecology of that specimen. But from a set of specimens that make a collection, it is possible to do comparisons, grouping and separating them by their features, in what, ultimately, leads to the description or identification of a species. The possibility of making and analysing comparisons between specimens is fundamental to our developing the knowledge of what the species is, and therefore, our understanding of biodiversity. There is great value in having a collection. Because of this, we need to resist the fate predicted for collections in the previous quote from Saramago, that in the continuation of the text, says:\n\n\u2026 and for a short while they manage [to impose some order on the world], but only as long as they are there to defend their collection, because when the day comes when it must be dispersed, and that day always comes, either with their death or when the collector grows weary, everything goes back to its beginnings, everything returns to chaos.\n\nWe would lose too much in letting everything return to chaos, we cannot afford it.\n\nWithout a doubt, there is a cost in maintaining a collection. Several reports have been published about the termination of collections due to budget restrictions, either by closing doors, restricting or diverting staff to other tasks, or aggregating collections in large facilities (Gropp 2003; Deng 2015; Kemp 2015). For example, in Italy, by 2014, it was estimated that one-third of the biological specimens were lost through lack of preservation or bad practice (Nature Editorial 2014), and in the USA 100 herbaria have been closed since 1997 (Deng 2015). Discarding a collection brings with it the loss of investments in field expeditions, the costs of subsequent preservation of specimens across decades or centuries, and even the fact that many species may not be found anymore in the original collecting sites, due to the loss of habitats or restrictions in sampling because of conservation or ethical reasons. As an indicator, insurance companies in Norway value herbarium specimens at \u20ac21 each (Hannu Saarenmaa 2017, pers. com.). Here we will focus on the uses of collections and how they underpin scientific research, biodiversity conservation, food security, and other societal and economic benefits. Several reviews have discussed these uses, providing examples (Brooke 2000; Suarez and Tsutsui 2004; Tewksbury et al. 2014; Rocha et al. 2014). It is worth mentioning that, with the development of laboratory methods, technology and other tools still to be invented, there are potential applications of the collections in the future that we cannot foresee.\n\nPreserving and Documenting Biodiversity\n\nThe most fundamental use of museum and herbarium collections is to support taxonomy and systematics, serving as references for species description, identification, and naming of species. One of the most important roles of collections is to preserve the physical specimens that served as samples for the formal scientific description of a new species for science. These specimens, often more than one, are called types. One of these specimens is usually designated as the holotype by the author of the species \u2013 the one chosen to be most representative of the characteristics of the species \u2013 but duplicates can also be mentioned in the publication of the species, and distributed to other collections. This distribution is important for security reasons, to ensure that if the holotype is lost because of an unfortunate event, other specimens that were used the initial description of the species are preserved. In 2017, a package with specimens sent by the National Museum of Natural History in Paris to the Queensland Herbarium in Australia, including some type specimens, was incinerated by Australian customs officers (Stokstad 2017).\n\nTypes are, therefore, special specimens, so their management is undertaken with extreme care. Digitisation programmes normally prioritise these specimens, to provide digital preservation and alternative access to the specimens via the internet. In the case of plant type specimens, the Global Plants Initiative framed this task, with support of the Andrew W Mellon Foundation. The repository Global Plants (http://plants.jstor.org) aggregates and provides access to more than two million high resolution images of types, including 3461 images of type specimens collected in Angola. The total number of types from Angola, from all groups, reported through GBIF and Global Plants is 6983 (Table 19.2).\n\nTable 19.2 Number of type specimens from Angola in NHC collections worldwide Full size table\n\nMuseum and herbarium collections serve not only to preserve types and other specimens already identified, but also organisms yet to be identified. In fact, many specimens remain unidentified for several years, either because there is no capacity for their immediate processing after being collected, or its identification represents taxonomic challenges, sometimes at the level of the description of a new species for science. In plants, only 16% of newly collected species are described within the first 5 years after being collected, and approximately 25% of new species are described using specimens more than 50 years after their collection (Bebber et al. 2010), and in animals, the situation is likely to be similar (Kemp 2015).\n\nCollections are the main source for documenting diversity not only between species but also within species. The majority of specimens in collections are not types, but regular specimens sampled at a certain date and location, by one or more collectors, and representing a species. These specimens and their associated information represent what we call primary biodiversity data, supporting different types of studies and applications. The set of specimens of a species, from one or more collections, allow identifying the range of natural variation of the several traits that are analyzed in the process of defining the species. Often, labels attached to the specimens, or registry books associated with the collections include information on traits that are recorded at the time of collection or when the specimen is added to the collection (e.g. size, weight, length, maturity stage, colour of the flower in plants, the presence of fruits, etc.). Additionally, the habitat, interactions with other species (e.g. parasite of, epiphyte on), its use by local populations in traditional medicine, food, and construction (mainly plants) is recorded.\n\nMost taxonomic studies will require access to more than one collection, to allow a comprehensive analysis of the variability of the species of interest. Finding which collections have specimens important to the study might be demanding, but current digitisation projects underway in many collections do facilitate the task enormously. This is the case of some collections based in Angola at the Museum and Herbarium of Lubango, the entomological collections of Instituto de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o Agron\u00f3mica, in Huambo, and the Herbarium of the Centro de Bot\u00e2nica da Universidade Agostinho Neto, in Luanda. The first two initiatives are currently preparing the publication of their databases through GBIF, for global and open access to data, which is possible even though Angola is not yet a member of the organisation. Through GBIF, researchers can have access to recorded information including most of the details included in the specimen\u2019s label, and if available, an image of the specimen, a sound recording or a video attached to the specimen record. There are currently approximately 49,000 specimens from Angola with media attachments.\n\nOther mega-science digital platforms also support capacity development in taxonomic studies (Triebel et al. 2012). These include the Catalogue of Life, a global checklist for all groups, that integrates more than 168 international or group-specific checklists or taxonomic databases (Catalogue of Life 2018); the Biodiversity Heritage Library (2018) which provides digital access to legacy literature, including many publications with the original descriptions of the species, and automatic functions for searching scientific names; the Encyclopedia of Life (2018), also an integrative portal to information about species description, classification, multimedia, and distribution maps of; the Barcode of Life (Ratnasingham and Hebert 2007) which provides access to barcode sequence data; the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (2018), that promotes global and regional assessments of species conservation status; and the previously mentioned Global Plants Initiative. All these initiatives agree on common biodiversity informatics data standards, protocols and tools that ensure the inter-operability across platforms under a common framework (Hobern et al. 2012). This means that when researchers and institutions contribute to or use one of these initiatives, they are reaching a global and transversal set of resources covering several biodiversity dimensions which, although global, provide detailed data applicable at the local or regional level.\n\nThese combinations of data are instrumental to prepare, for example, a national checklist, like the national vascular plant list (Figueiredo and Smith 2008, Figueiredo et al. 2009a, b). This task requires not only the compilation of information about species and their distribution, but also synonyms, and sometimes helping to solve taxonomic problems, species distribution ranges, and dealing with the scarcity of information. Internet access to these and similar platforms is fundamental and an important factor to reducing total costs of biodiversity research (Smith and Figueiredo 2010).\n\nAn increase of the role of collections in preserving reference material on biodiversity is likely to occur with the addition of new methods for biodiversity identification. Barcoding is one of the methods that determines DNA sequences that are species-specific (Gross 2012), and it can speed up the identification of new species. These sequences are stored in gene bank repositories, while the related physical specimens, the source of the sequences, are stored as vouchers in collections. Sometimes, specimens already represented in collections are found by barcoding to belong to different species, therefore new arrangements are needed within collections. Museums are currently adopting new workflows with duplicate specimen processing for traditional and molecular taxonomy (Gross 2012), in an articulated new way of producing natural history knowledge (Strasser 2011).\n\nDetecting Changes in Species Distribution and in the Environment\n\nUnderstanding species distribution is usually a multidimensional problem that involves information about species occurrences, climatic information, species migrations and the availability of resources such as food and water. Primary biodiversity data from collections is often the only data resource to document the presence of species, either because of loss of habitats due to change of land use or because of the local extinction of the species. This primary data, when combined with environmental data, can be used to model the species distribution by numerical tools that identify the environmental factors that are most closely associated with occurrence of the species. This is, in turn, converted to a species distribution model (SDM), expressed as a spatial map of probability of occurrence. Although subject to problems associated with sample bias (Beck et al. 2014; Gomes et al. 2018), these models can be an improved approach to gap analysis (Peterson and Kluza 2003), or help to plan sampling effort to sites with a high potential of occurrence but that has not yet been surveyed.\n\nDistribution data from museums frequently supports assessments of the impact of climate change on species distribution. By comparing two models, one for the present distribution and another for a hypothesised future distribution, it is possible to identify changes, including the expansion or reduction of the area of distribution. The present distribution can be modeled from collection data, using a matching period for climate date. A projection for a future state can be performed, using the same distribution data, but with future climate scenarios data. Using this approach, Warren et al. (2013) found that half of the plant species and one-third of animal species can lose half of the suitable climate range by 2080. Another example with links to human health is provided by Capinha et al. (2014), using as target species the mosquito Aedes aegypti, the vector of dengue fever. These authors used collection data combined with other data sources to determine the macroclimatic conditions presently occupied by this mosquito, and the shifts in its distribution in the near future (2010\u20132039), based on models of possible climate scenarios.\n\nIn assessing biological invasions, the use of NHCs is also essential. The historical record of an alien species needs to be determined so that its native distribution is identified as well as its habitat and environmental requirements, life cycle, biotic and abiotic interactions. Frequently, data and information on these parameters are only available from museum or herbarium collections. These data will not only allow to assess the invasion risk of a species, but also to predict its spread to new regions, which can be done by projections of species distribution models, as for example, the Giant African Snail (Sarma et al. 2015) or a result of climate change in lantana (Taylor and Kumar 2014). Even if historical records were not available in collections to support a study, these are essential as repositories of new records of surveyed areas for future assessments (Rejm\u00e1nek et al. 2017). Collections are also important for the assessment of impacts in areas of invasion, in the determination of species affected by the alien species.\n\nBiodiversity Conservation\n\nThe IUCN Red List has become a standard with which to monitor a species\u2019 conservation status. Several of the criteria to determine the IUCN category of threat can be obtained from natural history collections, such as features of life history, biology, and geographical range. Williams and Crouch (2017) investigated whether herbarium records could suffice for accurate estimation of the plant geographical range in South Africa following IUCN Red List criteria. They concluded that results improve when information from national herbaria is complemented by local or regional herbarium datasets. For Cape Verde, herbarium data was also used in Red List assessments of the endemic flora (Romeiras et al. 2016). However, the role of collections in Red List assessments starts from the point of acertaining the correct identification of each specimen in a survey, and before the application of any criteria, based on a common taxonomy for the group of species under scrutiny (e.g. Grubb et al. 2003).\n\nAnother contribution of NHCs to biodiversity conservation is in reintroduction programmes. When a local population of one species is extinct or threatened, the reintroduction of new individuals can be done to increase population levels. However, the genetic profile of the local population should be determined, in order to ensure that new reintroduced individuals are the closest possible to the original population, and thus well adapted to the environmental conditions of the new location. If the local populations are extinct, museum or herbarium collections might be the only resource to determine the genetic profile of the original populations, if specimens are preserved in the NHCs from the original population. Collections are also instrumental in determining other aspects of translocation planning, including climate and habitat requirements (IUCN/SSC 2013).\n\nA service provided by NHCs is also related to the trade of wild animals and plants, within the scope of the CITES. Frequently, specimens of wild species are seized by customs officials and the species identification is needed to check against the species lists in the annexes of the convention. NHC taxonomists are frequently asked to assist customs officials in identifying the species and the most likely source of these organisms.\n\nMuseum and herbarium collections can also be used to verify if the network of protected areas is effective in ensuring the protection of threatened species. Romeiras et al. (2014) used collection data to make a biogeographic analysis of 18 high-value timber trees from Angola. The authors concluded that these species could be grouped within four regions, which had little correspondence to currently recognised WWF ecoregions. They suggested that conservation plans based on WWF ecoregions might provide the inappropriate basis for the conservation of these trees, in which eight species were found to require high conservation priority because of their very restricted distribution in Angola.\n\nSupporting Sustainable Food Production\n\nAs in the definition of biodiversity adopted by the Convention of Biological Diversity, the definition of agrobiodiversity by FAO highlights three levels of diversity: diversity of genetic resources (varieties, breeds); diversity of species used for food, fodder, fiber, fuel and pharmaceuticals; and the diversity of non-harvested species that support production and diversity in the wider environment that support agro-ecosystems (FAO 1999). Sustainable food production systems demand attention to all these dimensions, which reinforces the role of NHCs. For example, the conservation of crop wild relatives, which are wild species closely related to crops, is important to ensure sources of genetic diversity useful to develop more productive and resilient crops (Casta\u00f1eda-\u00c1lvarez et al. 2016). A priority in the conservation of such wild relatives is, therefore, the importance of correct identification, based on herbarium data among other sources Casta\u00f1eda-\u00c1lvarez et al. 2016).\n\nNatural history collections are also of importance in many other aspects of agrosystems. This is the case of weed identification and the control of pests caused by insects and fungi. Collections provide the resources for the identification of these problem organisms, data for their first detection in a certain area, and information about life history and distribution needed to determine the potential areas of occurrence using bioclimatic and other modelling approaches. High biodiversity in agrosystems can in some cases contribute to increasing productivity, by promoting ecosystem services, e.g. through biological regulation of soil fertility (Duru et al. 2015), for which NHCs are important to guide actions to increase biodiversity in such systems, providing information on the original or potential species native to the region.\n\nTwo further types of collections in support of food and forestry are also associated with herbarium collections. One of these is germplasm or seed bank collections. These seed collections are fundamental to the preservation of plant species, by maintaining live and viable seeds for future use. There are more than 1300 seed banks worldwide (Rajasekharan 2015), both for crop or wild species. These include the Global Seed Vault, in Svalbard, Norway, which holds crop seeds for more than 5000 plant species, and the Millenium Seed Bank, at Kew and Wakehurst Place, United Kingdom, which holds seeds for 10% of the world wild species. In Angola, the Universidade Agostinho Neto hosts the only seed bank in the country as part of the center for plant genetic resources. The other type of collection is the xylarium, composed of wood samples, sometimes several pieces with different anatomical sections of the wood of the same species. These samples are used, sometimes supplemented by molecular genetics technologies, in identifying the products of illegal activities in the timber trade (Yu et al. 2017).\n\nConnecting Biodiversity to Society Through Education\n\nBiodiversity is present, but rarely noticed, in the everyday life of humans. Natural History Museums are important in bringing evidence of this to the population. Through displays and exhibitions, it is possible to explain or demonstrate, in simple terms, the value of biodiversity. In attractive displays, the direct value of biodiversity can be shown in food, medicine, fuel, fiber, rubber, oils and building materials, but also the indirect values through climate regulation, nutrient recycling, water and air purification, pollination, and cultural, religious and aesthetic aspects. People need to be informed by appropriate NHC displays in order to relate these values of biodiversity to their daily life. These topics can also be explored more deeply to explain biological concepts to students.\n\nSpecimens from collections facilitate the explanation of complex topics to visitors. For example, concepts as life stages, evolution, adaptation to the environment, species interaction and many others, are better explained using specimens as support. But these can also be used to provide insights to the science behind the scenes. The causes of diversity, how genes express into forms and colors, the roles of microscopic organisms that can move or destroy bodies a thousand times bigger, the work of a taxonomist, a geneticists or a bioinformatician in understanding phylogenies, the role of organisms as bioindicators of environmental changes, are all examples of what might interest the visitor to a NHC. All these approaches can be complemented by digital formats, through web pages that provide deeper coverage of the topics displayed in the exhibitions. Via the Internet, it is also possible to use virtual means to place species in their habitats and environments, or inform the visitor of the species in one\u2019s own neighbourhood. Other engagements with the public are also possible, turning the visitor into a collaborator. For example, crowdsourcing activities were implemented by some museums to make the databasing of specimens\u2019 labels, which is a time-consuming task in collection digitisation (Les Herbonautes (2018); Notes from Nature (2018); DIGIVOL (2018).\n\nAnother example is citizen science participation, through which platforms citizens can submit records, supported by images and other information, of species occurrence, normally referring a date and a location (through GPS coordinates) attached. Many projects of this type have emerged in recent years, the most visible of the global scope being eBird (2018) for bird observations and iNaturalist.org (2018) for any type of organism. Although subject to errors, these initiatives have the enormous merit to expand the network of voluntary observers and are improving their internal quality control mechanisms (using image analysis algorithms, for example), to suggest or correct identifications. Records with attached images thus become openly accessible to researchers, permitting validation of the records.\n\nMuseums can be windows to connect biodiversity science to society. Not only can they contribute to educating people on concepts of biodiversity conservation and sustainability but also to attracting new students and practitioners to biodiversity-related topics. They can also be vibrant regional poles for research and natural history activities, interlinked with a global community of scientists and naturalists through digital platforms. In some cases, their importance has also been recognised at an economic level: the Natural History Museum in London has free entry to visitors, a benefit that was earned after the demonstration of the economic benefit from attracting foreign tourists to London."}, {"url": "https://plants.jstor.org/partner/P", "page_content": "Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle\n\nThe Mus\u00e9um national d\u2019Histoire naturelle ranks among the world\u2019s foremost natural history institutes and has one of the world\u2019s most extensive plant collections, known as the Paris Herbarium.

They are divided into 413 families whose organisation reflects recent progress made thanks to the work of the international group APG (Angiosperm Phylogenetic Group).\n\nThe herbarium boards are all digitised, making up a \u201cvirtual herbarium\u201d that can be consulted online, with the option to run automated searches by various criteria such as harvest locality or harvester name."}, {"url": "https://www.mnhn.fr/en/fungi-collection", "page_content": "Presentation\n\nThe Mus\u00e9um\u2019s fungarium is one of the world\u2019s largest collections of fungal organisms and is particularly interesting due to the large number of historical collections containing many type specimens. A large part of the reference specimens for metropolitan France are present in the mycology herbarium, as well as many specimens from the former French colonies, and current overseas territories.\n\nIn contrast to the consistent use of herbarium boards in phanerogamy, the conservation methods for the mycology collections vary greatly. Most of the dried specimens are preserved in cardboard boxes or matchboxes (especially for the myxomycetes), pill boxes, bound books or envelopes fixed to herbarium boards. Currently, newly collected specimens are mostly stored in zip-lock plastic bags of varying sizes. Dry specimens are often accompanied by drawings, watercolours or photos, and sometimes come with more or less detailed notes taken in the field. Some old collections of tropical fungi are still preserved in alcohol or formalin (stored away from the herbarium area: Alcooth\u00e8que), while some very specific groups of microscopic fungi (e.g. Laboulbeniomycetes and Trichomycetes) are stored on microscope slides.\n\nThe fungal collection is continuously expanded via numerous field missions (B. Buyck, B. Duhem, etc.) around the world, as well as through the Museum\u2019s inventory programmes (Mercantour, Mayotte, Madagascar, etc.), institutional exchanges, herbarium bequests and type deposits by a number of contemporary amateur and professional mycologists. To date, only a small fraction of the collections has been digitized and is accessible online. A large proportion of the activity surrounding the collections currently involves in-depth cataloguing work."}]}
