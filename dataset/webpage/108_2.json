{"Evan Rachel Wood's acting debut was in Digging to China (1997).": [{"url": "https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/film/091198digging-film-review.html", "page_content": "By STEPHEN HOLDEN\n\nome awfully familiar buttons are pushed in \"Digging to China,\" the story of a sweetly eccentric 10-year-old girl's friendship with a sweetly eccentric 30-year-old man who happens to be mentally disabled. Although there's nothing intrinsically false about the story of these two lonely misfits forming a deep emotional bond, which the outside world views with suspicion, the movie, directed by the actor Timothy Hutton (in his debut behind the camera) from a screenplay by Karen Janszen, is entirely predictable. The moment these two innocents share their first cuddly embrace you know somebody's going to get the wrong idea. You also know that sooner or later their idyll will be rudely shattered.\n\n\n\n\n\nBruce Heinsius/Moonstone Kevin Bacon, left, and Evan Rachel Wood in \"Digging to China.\"\n\nRicky is being driven to a home for the mentally disabled by his ailing mother, Leah (Marian Seldes), who has been found to have cancer, when their car breaks down somewhere in the rural East. Mother and son are forced to stay in a family-run motel, where Ricky meets Harriet Frankovitz (Evan Rachel Wood), the wildly imaginative girl who becomes his soul mate.\n\nHarriet's mother (Cathy Moriarty), a bitter, tough-talking alcoholic, runs the motel with the help of her sullen, slatternly 26-year-old daughter, Gwen (Mary Stuart Masterston). When Mrs. Frankovitz gets behind the wheel of a car she tends to weave down the center of the road. In the movie's only unpredictable moment, she dies in a car accident, leaving Harriet in the care of the older sister, who reveals herself, to the little girl's horror, to be Harriet's biological mother.\n\nThe movie, set in the late 1960s, strains hard to portray Harriet as an adorably precocious child whose wild imagination is a sign of a her superior intelligence and artistic potential. In the voice-over narration that opens the movie, Harriet confesses her lifelong desire to escape to another world via magic carpet or flying saucer. Once, she recalls, she started digging a hole in the ground hoping to tunnel through the center of the earth directly to China. In one scene, Harriet literally tries to fly away by attaching a bunch of helium balloons to a chair.\n\nHarriet and Ricky's bond has everything to do with their desire to escape from a hostile, indifferent world. Harriet's grandiose fantasies have made her a joke among her classmates, who taunt her every day on the bus ride to school. Ricky's future is grimmer. He knows that he is being dropped off at an institution and that he may soon lose the mother who has loved and protected him. In the most dramatic sequence, the two friends run away together and camp out in the woods in an abandoned caboose.\n\n\"Digging to China,\" to its credit, doesn't grab at the heartstrings and strum an aggressively mawkish ballad. In fact, it could do with a bit more heart. Part of the problem is Ms. Wood's Harriet. The young actress is radiantly photogenic, but her performance is muted and monochromatic. As she confides her fantasies, you never have the sense of the volatile emotional life out of which they are spun. No matter what she says, Ms. Wood's Harriet sounds sensible and self-contained to the point of blandness. Without an incandescent performance at its center, \"Digging to China\" follows the same path as Harriet's balloon escape. It gets stuck in the trees.\n\nPRODUCTION NOTES\n\nDIGGING TO CHINA\n\nRating: \"Digging to China\" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

In 2012, Reed confessed that she's realized she may have been a bit harsh with her depictions of her family, saying, \"I have tons of regrets with that. 'Thirteen' was really hard on my family. I wrote this movie about them and their flaws and imperfections and what it was like growing up ... You get older and it's like, how dare I portray my father as being a totally vacant careless schmuck?\" (via HuffPost).\n\nReed also used her mother as inspiration for Tracy's mother, Melanie \u2014 especially some elements of their rocky relationship. She expressed her regret to the New York Daily News, telling the publication, \"My mom can't defend herself to the world. She is such an amazing woman, with such an open heart. It's a real hard line, and I crossed it. I took everyone's life story and assumed it would be a great thing to put on screen. I was being selfish and I feel so horrible about it. I feel so guilty.\"\n\nThankfully, her parents were able to forgive her. \"Now I have a great relationship with both my parents,\" Reed told HuffPost in a separate interview. \"I guess that's part of when you sign up to be a parent \u2014 you also have a pot of forgiveness ready for your kid.\""}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328538/reviews", "page_content": "Tracy is a normal thirteen-year-old girl, dressed in bright pastels, bedroom full of soft toys and with giggly thoughts of boys. Starting school in the new term she finds everyone in awe of Evie Zamora and her friends \u0096 all of who have suddenly turned into sexy young ladies over the summer. With her goofy kid look, Evie blanks Tracy until she impresses her by stealing a purse to go shopping. As Evie gets in with Tracy's mum Mel, she also takes Evie into her own world of rebellion involving stealing, drink, disobedience, drugs and sex. Mel struggles to hold on to the small parts of her daughter that she still recognises.\n\n\n\nAt many points in our lives we all change and perhaps the first time it happens is the hardest to deal with. The stage where everyone seems to go from just being kids to suddenly being a peer group is a major one and this film, for all its extremes, does justice to the difficulties (for everyone) of the period in a story that is well written, cleverly directed and really well acted by the whole cast. The plot builds well on minor changes to Tracy and makes it totally clear where the pressure is coming from and how it affects her; in this regard the script is spot on and is totally convincing. When it goes to extremes it does show signs of stretching and almost breaking but it never does \u0096 while it is extreme it is still convincing and only two or three moments seem like they are going too far. Certainly I can't imagine many parents will be able to watch it without worrying about how they and theirs will handle the change when it comes.\n\n\n\nWhile the writing is great, there does come a point where it needs to end and, while unconvincing, the film does at least draw to an end on an ambiguous ending and only the final shot of a 'isn't life hard' scream from Tracy struck a duff note and was too clumsy. As co-writer, Reed shows a real awareness of the world around her and she deserves the praise she got for that role but also her performance as Evie is praise worthy, but perhaps not to the extent that Wood's is. Wood takes us from a child to womanhood and never hits a duff note in her portrayal of a girl just trying to fit in.\n\n\n\nShe is excellent and her dynamic with Hunter is a perfect fit and also convincing; in my mind she is better than Reed because Wood had a more complex character to develop \u0096 Wood had to change her character, Reed played a character who was already there. Hunter deals with some minor clutter in her character but generally she is as good as her teenage cos-stars. Minor support roles for people like Sisto, Unger and Clarke all add to the film but really the film belongs to the lead trio. Director Hardwicke directs with style and with an eye for the clever shot \u0096 at times using fast camera motions while in one key scene just letting the camera frame the front room like it was a stage. She also uses a clever touch in tainting the film stock a washed out colour when Tracy's bubble finally bursts \u0096 we immediately go from bright colours to washed out blue and, even with the conclusion we only return to dark browns and not the highs of the main story.\n\n\n\nOverall this is a very good film that is hard to watch if you have pre-teen kids. It has extremes in there and it won't apply to every teenager out there but to just call it unrealistic is to ignore the reality of peer pressure and the sexualisation of youth generally. The script is convincing, frightening and moving and is greatly helped by three great performances from Reed, Wood and Hunter.\n\nWas this review helpful?

This post may contain affiliate links. Please see our disclosure for more details.\n\nWhile Nikki Reed is now largely recognized for her role in the Twilight Saga and for contributions in a number of other films, her rise to Hollywood stardom is perhaps one of the most interesting we\u2019ve ever encountered.\n\nReed was born in Los Angeles, California in 1988. She had somewhat of a tumultuous childhood, mainly caused by her parent\u2019s divorce when she was two years old.\n\nThe American actress was raised by her mother and showed an interest in acting and theatre from a young age.\n\nEvan Rachel Wood as Tracy Freeland and Nikki Reed as Evie Zamora in the 2003 American teen drama film Thirteen (Credit: Fox Searchlight Pictures)\n\nThis interest in acting caught the attention of her mother\u2019s friend, an aspiring film director named Catherine Hardwicke.\n\nHardwicke had an established career as a production designer for famed Hollywood directors such as Richard Linklater and David O. Russell and sought to establish a directing career of her own.\n\nWith this in mind, Hardwicke and (the then thirteen-year-old) Reed collaborated on the screenplay of Thirteen and finished the first draft within six days.\n\nWhile the film was initially written as a teen comedy, Hardwicke and Reed drew inspiration from Reed\u2019s personal life within a group of popular girls that she befriended at her school.\n\nNikki Reed was 14 years old when Thirteen premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2003 (Credit: Featureflash Photo Agency / Shutterstock)\n\nReed\u2019s experiences as a teenager were much more exciting than Hardwicke\u2019s, and in an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Hardwicke commented that at thirteen, \u201cSuddenly drugs are a possibility, suddenly sex is a possibility, suddenly driving is a possibility\u201d and that \u201cthere\u2019s something powerful here, something electric.\u201d\n\nOf course, powerful these themes would be present within the film Thirteen, which was shot and released in 2003, when Nikki Reed was 14 years young.\n\nThe Release of Thirteen\n\nThirteen was produced on a tight budget of $2 million (which was mostly independently raised by Hardwicke) and a tight shooting schedule, with shooting being completed within 24 days.\n\nThe film was shot using 16mm film, which was a cost-efficient measure but added a unique aesthetic to the visual style of the film.\n\nKnowing that Reed would not bring enough star appeal to the production, Hardwicke cast a 14-year-old Evan Rachel Wood in the lead role of Tracy Freeland, while Reed would be cast as the supporting character Evie Zamora.\n\nCatherine Hardwicke and her husband Jamie Marshall attend the 72nd Annual Directors Guild of America Awards at The Ritz Carlton on January 25, 2020, in Los Angeles, California (Credit: Featureflash Photo Agency / Shutterstock)\n\nWhile it wasn\u2019t Wood\u2019s first leading role in a Hollywood production, it is often seen as her first breakthrough role, and following the release of the film, Vanity Fair would name Wood one of the It Girls of Hollywood in their July 2003 issue.\n\nWhen the film was released, it would prove to cause a shockwave within American society. Never before on Hollywood screens were young children shown committing such scandalous acts as smoking cigarettes, indulging in hard drugs (including inhaling computer dust-off spray), and attempting to seduce older men.\n\nFor her performance in Thirteen, Evan Rachel Wood was nominated for a Golden Globe Award as Best Actress \u2013 Drama and for a Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Award for Best Actress (Credit: Featureflash Photo Agency / Shutterstock)\n\nDespite the controversy that the film caused, Thirteen would prove to be a sleeper hit and ultimately grossed $10.1 million throughout its limited release to 243 theatres in the United States.\n\nJenicka Carey, Evan Rachel Wood, and Nikki Reed starred in a film about substance abuse, sex, and crime (Credit: Fox Searchlight Pictures)\n\nCritical reception was overwhelmingly positive, with The Hollywood Reporter calling the film \u201ca chilling look at a pair of contemporary Valley girls\u201413-year-olds who are way beyond their years but also are nearly beyond repair\u201d.\n\nThe popularity and controversy the film caused certainly put Nikki Reed on the map as somewhat of an unruly young star, as she would continue to be typecast as young rebellious teenagers in the roles she accepted following Thirteen, including her role as Kathy Alva in Lord of Dogtown (which was also directed by Catherine Hardwicke).\n\nVictor Rasuk as Tony Alva and Nikki Reed as Kathy Alva in the 2005 American biographical drama film Lords of Dogtown (Credit: Sony Pictures Releasing)\n\nInterestingly enough, the film would also prove to be the big-screen debut of Vanessa Hudgens (long before her Disney Channel fame), who plays the small role of Noel, a straight-edged friend of Tracy before she begins her rebellious ways.\n\nReed\u2019s Regrets With Thirteen\n\nDespite the success of the film (especially in the context of being an accomplished screenwriter at the ripe young age of thirteen), Nikki Reed has shared numerous regrets regarding the writing and production of Thirteen.\n\nOne regret that Reed has shared regarding Thirteen was the depiction of her father within the film. In the film, Tracy\u2019s (the protagonist, who is based on Nikki Reed herself) father is depicted as an absent figure, a man more concerned with his career goals than with his relationship with his daughter.\n\nIn an interview with the Huffington Post, Reed stated that her depiction of her father \u201c\u2026was from one kid\u2019s perspective and not a well-rounded one. You get older and it\u2019s like, how dare I portray my father as being a totally vacant careless schmuck?\u201d.\n\nNikki Reed regrets some parts of Thirteen and the depictions of her mom and dad in the movie (Credit: DFree / Shutterstock)\n\nAs children, our perspective of our parents can often be distorted and flawed, and the fourteen-year-old Reed was no exception to this fact.\n\nIn addition to her regrets of the depiction of her father in Thirteen, Reed also had regrets in the depiction of her mother in the film.\n\nNowadays, she has stated that she has a much better relationship with her mother, contrary to the depiction of their relationship in the film.\n\nIn the film, Tracy\u2019s relationship with her mother is combative and rocky. Reed attributes this maturation of their relationship to the film, claiming that the writing and making of Thirteen \u201c\u2026helped broaden my perspective.\u201d\n\nNikki Reed\u2019s Past and Present\n\nReed had a unique situation growing up, as her childhood (and its natural flaws) were all depicted through her perspective in the film Thirteen.\n\nDespite this, Reed would mature into a well-adjusted young actress, landing popular roles such as Rosalie Hale in the Twilight series of films, and recurring roles in multiple popular television series, such as The O.C. and Sleepy Hollow.\n\nIn recent years, Reed has also acted in multiple music videos for musicians like The Black Eyed Peas, and Lady Gaga. She even lent her hand in directing a music video for the American pop-folk duo The Sweeplings, in 2016. She has continued her passion for writing as well and is currently developing a script for a period piece set in 1960-1980 New Zealand.\n\nJeremy Sisto as Brady and Holly Hunter as Melanie Freeland in Thirteen (Credit: Fox Searchlight Pictures)\n\nShowing her versatility as a creative mind, she also owns her own sustainable jewelry line called Bayou with You and works with American computer company Dell to turn recycled electronics into sustainable jewelry.\n\nRecently, she was appointed the creative director and strategic advisor for a vegan sneaker line called Loci.\n\nNeedless to say, Nikki Reed has proven that he has an affinity for using her creativity in multiple aspects of entertainment and business, including directing, writing, and operating her own brands. She has certainly matured from the rambunctious thirteen-year-old she depicted in Thirteen.\n\nNikki Reed wears her hair half-up at the 2016 WE Day California event held April 7 at The Forum in Inglewood (Credit: WENN)\n\nIn April 2016, Nikki Reed and Nina Dobrev\u2019s ex Ian Somerhalder were getting ready to celebrate their first wedding anniversary, and the couple looked like they were still in the honeymoon period when they attended the 2016 WE Day California event.\n\nThe lovebirds posed for pictures on the blue carpet, with Ian\u2019s hands around his wife\u2019s waist.

I'm now 18 and this movie gives me those same nostalgic feelings I got when I watched those. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and really gives those 2003 feels. I truly enjoy the story and the exciting adventures the teens go on. It's such an interesting experience to go on with them and I suggest watching this movie.\n\n\n\nSpoiler time: Tracy's mother is my least favorite movie in mother history when it comes to not being able to recognize that her daughters a junkie even after having a junkie boyfriend. You're daughter screaming in your face and acting erratically does not translate to her hating your cooking. But ultimately I love all of the characters (except Tracy's mom) and I love the story. Some things do get confusing though as to why Evie up and ditched her old life to hang out with some random girl from school, why Evie has been flirtatious towards both Tracy and her mother, what the hell is going on mentally with Tracy's mother, why Tracy gets so jealous of the mother-daughter relationship forming between her mom and Evie, how Tracy's mom didn't notice her daughter changing so quickly I.e. Stealing, drinking, doing drugs, and many other things. I get confused as to why the writers tried to cram so many pointless plot lines and side stories into the movie that didn't even end up having a big payoff, but all of those minor complaints aside, I truly love this movie, flaws and all. It's gotta be one of my new guilty pleasures. I just love movies that have teens either destroying their lives or going on wild adventures that end up destroying their lives.
