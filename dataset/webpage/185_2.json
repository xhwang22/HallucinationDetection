{"Philip of France was known as 'the Fair' due to his handsome features.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Philip-IV-king-of-France", "page_content": "Early years\n\nBorn at Fontainebleau while his grandfather was still ruling, Philip, the second son of Philip III (the Bold) and grandson of St. Louis (Louis IX), was not yet three when his mother, Isabella of Aragon, died on her return from the Crusade on which Louis IX had perished. The motherless Philip and his three brothers saw little of their father, who, stricken by Isabella\u2019s death, threw himself into campaigning and administrative affairs. His troubled childhood and the series of blows he suffered explain in some measure the conflicting elements in his adult personality. In 1274 his father married Marie de Brabant, a beautiful and cultivated woman, and, with her arrival at court, intrigue began to flourish. In the same year, the two-year-old Joan, heiress of Champagne and Navarre, was welcomed as a refugee. Reared with the royal children, she would, when she was 12, become the bride of Philip the Fair.\n\nIn 1276 Philip\u2019s elder brother, Louis, died, and the shock of this event, which suddenly made Philip heir to the kingdom, was compounded by persistent rumours of poisoning and suspicions that Philip\u2019s stepmother intended to see Isabella\u2019s remaining sons destroyed. Vague allegations were circulated that Louis\u2019s death was linked with certain unspecified \u201cunnatural acts\u201d of his father. These rumours, never satisfactorily put to rest, together with the unexpected change in Philip\u2019s fortunes, apparently served to arouse in him feelings of insecurity and mistrust.\n\nConsequently, Philip turned elsewhere in search of a model for his own conduct. He found it in Louis IX, whose memory was increasingly venerated as the number of miracles attributed to him mounted. Reports of Louis\u2019s exacting standards of rulership and his saintly virtues were reinforced by the precepts of the religious advisers who surrounded the adolescent Philip. A more self-confident person might have been able to discriminate realistically among the sometimes artificially exaggerated stories and the utopian ideals. Philip, however, became convinced that it was his God-given duty to attain the lofty goals of his grandfather.\n\nBritannica Quiz Kings, Queens, and More Quiz\n\nWhen Philip was 16, he was knighted and married to Joan of Navarre. In 1285 he accompanied his father to the south on a campaign to install Philip\u2019s brother Charles on the throne of Aragon. He had no sympathy with the enterprise, however, which was backed by his stepmother and aimed against the king of Aragon, his late mother\u2019s brother. When his father died in October 1285, Philip immediately abandoned the venture."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/philip-iv-king-france", "page_content": "PHILIP IV, KING OF FRANCE\n\nReigned 1285 to 1314, called the Fair; b. Fontainebleau, 1268; d. Fontainebleau, Nov. 29, 1314. Philip brought the French monarchy to new heights of power, yet many of his contemporaries and some modern scholars assert that his ministers deserve all the credit (or blame) for his policies. It is true that his agents (Flotte, Nogaret, and Marigny) were forceful personages and that\n\nPhilip himself always let them speak for him on formal occasions. But general policy remained the same for 29 years while ministers changed, and the records show that behind the scenes Philip worked with unflagging industry. Those who have studied the period most carefully suspect that he was responsible for the events of his reign.\n\nThe Reign and Its Problems. Philip was a devoted husband, a loyal friend, and a pious Christian. But his piety, without flaw in his private life, showed two peculiarities in public. First, he had no great respect for the leadership of the Roman curia. His father's death in the disastrous Crusade against Aragon, a death that left Philip at the age of 17 to cope with a hopeless war and a heavy debt, may have engendered his doubts about papal policies. Second, Philip, the heir of crusaders, the grandson of a saint, the ruler of the largest Catholic country in Europe, believed that the French monarch was as necessary for human welfare as the Roman See. Philip's duty to God and to his people was to strengthen the Kingdom of France, and anyone who interefered with this task, baron or emperor, bishop or pope, was to be swept aside.\n\nHe and his advisers had a fairly clear concept of sovereignty. Everyone who was \"in and of the kingdom\" owed obedience to the king. But what was the kingdom? There were bishops in the south who were virtually independent; there were lands on the border of the Empire that had both French and German connections; worst of all, the two great and wealthy fiefs of Guienne (held by England) and Flanders had almost escaped royal control.\n\nSome of these problems were easily solved. Self-governing towns, many barons, even the great bishops of the Midi had to accept the oversight of royal officials. The French boundary was pushed east at the expense of the Holy Roman Empire; the city of Lyons was annexed. But England fought to retain Guienne, and Flanders fought to keep its autonomy. To gain English neutrality, Philip had to relinquish most of Guienne and marry his daughter to the Prince of Wales (thus creating the later English claim to the French throne). Even then, Philip could not win a complete victory over the Flemings; he acquired only the towns of Lille, Douai, and Bethune.\n\nThese wars, fought with paid soldiers, were very expensive. Philip was always short of money; his greatest innovations and his greatest mistakes were due to the fact that he was near bankruptcy during most of his reign. He imposed the first general taxes in French history; he inflated the currency; he expelled the Jews and confiscated their property; he abused judicial procedures to extort large fines from clergy, barons, and towns.\n\nRelations with Boniface VIII. Both financial need and the desire for sovereign independence led to his quarrel with Pope boniface viii. Philip wanted to tax the clergy without securing papal consent; Boniface forbade this in the bull clericis laicos (1296). Philip's ministers accused the clergy of disloyalty and harassed them so that they begged the pope to remove his prohibition. Boniface finally ruled that in an emergency for the defense of the realm the clergy could be taxed by the king.\n\nThe second stage of the quarrel came when Philip sought to condemn Bishop Bernard Saisset for treason. Boniface demanded the bishop's release; Philip's ministers charged that this was an attack on the authority of the king and the independence of France. A meeting of representatives of clergy, nobility, and bourgeosie was held at Paris in 1302, where Pierre Flotte denounced the pope. When the Flemings defeated the French and killed Flotte at Courtrai, there was a brief lull, but Guillaume de Nogaret was soon ordered to carry on the case. He accused the pope of simony, vice, and heresy, and persuaded most French communities, including cathedral chapters and monasteries, to appeal for a general council to depose Boniface. Nogaret went to Italy in 1303 to arrest the pope and succeeded in holding him prisoner at Anagni for a few days. A popular uprising freed the aged pontiff, but he died of the shock within a month.\n\nThe next pope, benedict xi, did not live long enough to settle the affair. After his death, mysterious intrigues, still imperfectly known, resulted in the election in 1305 of the archbishop of Bordeaux as clement v. Clement, throughout his pontificate, acted as if he were under obligation to Philip. To end the scandal caused by continued attacks on Boniface's memory, he praised the king's pious zeal and absolved Nogaret and his aides. When Philip accused the Knights templar of heresy, probably because he coveted the wealth that they had gained by operating as bankers, Clement suppressed the order even though its guilt was not proved. Worst of all, disorders in Italy gave Philip a chance to urge Clement to remain north of the Alps. The pope finally settled at avignon, just across the Rhone from France. Thus began the \"Babylonian Captivity\" (see avignon papacy).\n\nPhilip's determination to be a strong king in a united France made a lasting impression on the French government. All branches of the administration were professionalized, and the number of royal officials greatly increased. The high court of Parlement at Paris was strengthened and a much more efficient financial administration was created. France was already on the road to becoming a bureaucratic state, but Philip accelerated the process.\n\nNevertheless, whereas Philip's administrative structure survived, his unscrupulous methods tarnished the prestige of kingship. Revolts broke out after his death, and for the next century, the French monarchy rocked from crisis to crisis. Philip had very nearly exhausted the reservoir of goodwill that had been left by his grandfather. St. louis ix. It took another saint, joan of arc, to replenish it.\n\nBibliography: r. fawtier, ed., Camptes royaux, 1285\u20131314, 3 v.

The most significant of these last Capetian reigns was that of Philip the Fair. Worldly and ambitious yet pious and intelligent, he was less accommodating than his forebears and more devoted to his power than to his reputation. He brought the monarchy to a degree of coordinated strength it was not again to have in the Middle Ages. But, in so doing, he strained the resources and patience of his subjects. His sons had to give in to the demands of a country beginning to suffer from the natural disasters, such as the great famine and the Black Death, that would mark the 14th century. They did so, however, without abandoning their father\u2019s objectives. When Charles IV died without a male heir in 1328, as his brothers had done before him, the royal succession was claimed by a collateral Capetian family.\n\nThe reigns of the later Capetian kings were marked by further territorial consolidation. Marrying his son to the heiress of Champagne and Navarra in 1284, Philip III prepared the way for a reversion no less important than that of Toulouse (1271). Philip the Fair secured the heiress to the county of Burgundy for his son Philip in 1295 and annexed southern Flanders and Lyon in 1312. Smaller acquisitions, cumulatively of great importance, resulted from purchase: the counties of Gu\u00eenes (1281), Chartres (1286), and La Marche and Saintonge (1308); the viscounties of Lomagne and Auvillars (1302) and La Soule (1306); and a number of untitled lordships.\n\nThrough treaties, Philip the Fair extended his jurisdiction into the ecclesiastical principalities of Viviers, Cahors, Mende, and Le Puy. With his greatly expanded domain, the king could assert unprecedented authority everywhere in France. Yet it does not appear that territorial policy as such had changed. Appanages were still to be granted and to be recovered by the later Capetians. The monarchs continued to do without Brittany, Burgundy, and many lesser lordships, which did not prevent them from legislating for these lands along with the rest.\n\nGovernment became more engrossing, specialized, and efficient. Although the royal curia continued to exist as an aggregate of favourites, magnates, prelates, and advisers, its ministerial element\u2014comprising salaried officers serving at the king\u2019s pleasure\u2014functioned increasingly in departments. The small council acquired definition from an oath first mentioned in 1269. With its sessions lengthening under a growing burden of cases, Parlement was divided into chambers of pleas, requests, and investigations (1278), and its composition and jurisdiction were regulated. Older provincial tribunals, such as the Norman Exchequer and the Jours of Troyes, became commissions of Parlement. While the direction of finance was left with the council, the Chambre des Comptes (Chamber of Accounts), apart from the treasury, was organized to audit accounts. Council and chamber as well as Parlement developed appropriate jurisdiction, and all three bodies kept archives. The chancery, serving all departments, remained in the hands of lesser functionaries until 1315, when Louis X revived the title of honour.\n\nLocal administration was marked by the proliferation of officers subordinate to the bailiffs and seneschals. The chief judge (juge-mage) assumed the seneschal\u2019s judicial functions in the south; receivers of revenues, first appearing in Languedoc, were instituted in the bailiwicks at the end of the 13th century. Commissions of investigation continued to traverse the provinces under the later Capetians, but all too often they now functioned as fiscal agents rather than as reformers.\n\nMany of the officers who served Philip the Fair were laymen, and many were lawyers. Impressed with the power they wielded, they promoted loyalty to the crown and a conception of the royal authority approaching that of sovereignty. Without claiming absolute power for the king, they thought in terms of his \u201csuperiority\u201d over all men within national boundaries now (for the first time) strictly determined; and they did not hesitate to argue from Roman law that, when the \u201cstate of the kingdom\u201d was endangered, the monarch had an overriding right to the aid of all his subjects in its defense. While this doctrine, in a notorious case, was made a justification for imposing on the clergy, the later Capetians did not lose the religious mystique they had inherited from their predecessors\u2019 efforts in Christian causes. Even as political loyalties were being engrossed by the lay state, the \u201creligion of monarchy\u201d derived impetus from the fervent utterance of those who saw in Philip the Fair a type of Christ or the ruler of a chosen and favoured people.\n\nIt was in the requirements of war and finance that the claims of the monarchy found most concrete expression. In the 1270s, for his campaigns in the south, Philip III requested military aid from men theretofore exempt from such service. Philip the Fair, renewing these demands for his wars in Gascony and Flanders, went so far as to claim the military obligation of all freemen as the basis for taxing personal property. The most persistent and lucrative taxation after 1285 was that imposed on the clergy, generally in the form of tithes (taxes on income) and annates (taxes on property); sales taxes, customs, tallages on Jews and foreign businessmen, and forced loans likewise supplemented older revenues of the domain to support increased administrative expenses as well as costs of war. The most unpopular fiscal expedients were the revaluations of coinage after 1295, by which the king several times increased the profits of his mints to the confusion of merchants and bankers. The imbalance between ordinary resources and the needs of an expanding government became chronic at the end of the 13th century. Yet, in spite of the statist arguments of their lawyers, none of the later Capetians were moved to regard taxation as an established and justified requirement of a national government.\n\nSuch restraint is one reason why, with momentary lapses, the strongest of the later Capetians was not regarded as an arbitrary ruler. Philip the Fair revered St. Louis (Louis IX) as much as did his people; like Louis, he took counsel from a relatively few unrepresentative persons. But, when Philip\u2019s own policies broke with the past, he resorted to great councils and assemblies, not so much to commit the nation as to justify his course. Whether a tax was sanctioned by custom or not, even if approved by assembled magnates or townsmen, he had it negotiated\u2014re-explained and collected\u2014in the provinces and localities. Large central assemblies in 1302, 1303, 1308, and 1312 met to enable the king and his ministers to arouse political support for his measures against the pope or the Knights Templars.\n\nAmong these gatherings were the earliest national assemblies to include representatives of towns and villages, which has caused historians to see them as early versions of what became the Estates-General, meetings of deputies representing the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners of the entire kingdom that were convoked beginning in the 14th century. Under Philip the Fair and his sons, however, these convocations were not yet understood to be representative of the estates of society; only when Philip V began to summon northern and southern men separately to deliberate on fiscal matters were the estates (which made up the Estates-General) in any way anticipated. Almost simultaneously the provincial Estates were foreshadowed in the petitions of magnates and towns in several regions for relief from administrative violations of traditional privilege; but the resulting charters of 1314\u201315 were poorly coordinated. They did little to limit royal power, although the fiscal rights later claimed by the Estates of Normandy could be traced to the Norman Charter of 1315.\n\nIf the policies of Philip the Fair evoked the complaint of all classes of people, it was because he had favoured none in particular; in fact, except in war and finance, the later Capetians may be said to have maintained a traditional politics toward both the nobles and the towns. With the church, however, it was otherwise. Philip the Fair\u2019s insistence on taxing the clergy for defense led immediately to his conflict with Pope Boniface VIII. The latter, in the bull Clericis laicos (1296), forbade the payment of taxes by clergymen to lay rulers without papal consent. Boniface had some support in the south, but Philip outmaneuvered the pope by prohibiting the export of bullion from France. The following year the pope abandoned his position and conceded to kings the right to tax the clergy without papal approval in time of need.\n\nThe quarrel was renewed in 1301, when the king and the magnates accused the bishop of Pamiers of treason and heresy. Boniface not only revoked the concessions of 1297 but rebuked Philip for seizing clerical property and debasing the coinage, among other things, and he summoned French prelates to Rome to proceed with a reform of the kingdom. Once again the clergy were split; many bishops and abbots attended an assembly at Paris in 1302 where they joined men of the other estates in addressing a remonstrance to the pope. A year later the king adopted rougher tactics: in June 1303 many prelates acquiesced in a scheme to try the pope before a general council, and in September the king\u2019s envoy Guillaume de Nogaret and his accomplices seized Boniface at Anagni. Rescued by the Romans, the aged pope died a month later. Upon his death the papal monarchy that had been erected over the preceding two centuries collapsed entirely. The Gascon pope Clement V (reigned 1305\u201314) moved the Holy See to Avignon, and a mass of his compatriots were appointed cardinals.\n\nWith this pliant pontiff, the way was cleared for the strangest act of violence of the reign of Philip the Fair\u2014the destruction of the Knights Templars. Founded in the 12th century, the Templars were an important Crusading order whose privileges seemed poorly justified after the fall of the last Crusader outpost in the Holy Land. The Templars remained an influential order, however, whose great wealth and power attracted Philip\u2019s attention. In 1307 Philip ordered the arrest of every Templar in France and the seizure of their goods and property because of alleged heresy and immorality. Under torture, the Templars confessed to homosexual practices, spitting on the cross, idol worship, and other things. In 1310 many of the Templars recanted their confessions, but Philip proceeded in his quest against them and in 1312 persuaded the pope to formally suppress the order. Their last leaders were imprisoned for life, and the two highest-ranking authorities were burned at the stake."}, {"url": "https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofEngland/Scandal-of-the-Silk-Purses-the-Hundred-Years-War/", "page_content": "Did two silk purses cause the Hundred Years War between France and England?\n\nBy the year 1314 the King of France, Philip IV was secure on his throne. Known as Philip \u2018the Fair\u2019 for his striking good looks, he had broken the order of Knights Templar the previous year, gaining him the potential of their vast wealth. He had three sons, each grown to manhood and married, with the future of the Capetian dynasty and France seemingly secure.\n\nFrance in 1314 found itself at peace. Its historical enemy, England was tied to the French Crown with Philip\u2019s daughter Isabella married to King Edward II. She had arrived in England as a twelve-year-old bride in 1308; highly intelligent with an engaging manner, she grew to be a formidable Queen, nicknamed the \u2018She-Wolf of France\u2019. Her husband, however, was more drawn to his close courtier Piers Gaveston than to his new bride.\n\nIsabella\u2019s family in 1315\n\nl-r: Isabella\u2019s brothers, Charles IV of France and Philip V, Isabella herself, her father Philip IV, her brother Louis X and her uncle, Charles of Valois\n\nHer brother Louis was husband to Margaret, the daughter of the powerful Duke of Burgundy; her other brothers Philip and Charles had married daughters of another Burgundian nobleman; Joan and Blanche. Phillipe\u2019s marriage to Joan was a love match, but Louis and Margaret\u2019s was a relationship of argument. Charles was pious and \u2018straight-laced\u2019 and appeared to have little time for his young wife. Margaret became firm friends with the two sisters and enjoyed a love of music, laughter and dancing.\n\nIsabella (pictured right) gave each of her sisters-in-law gifts of highly-embroidered silk purses. Later that year at a royal tournament, Isabelle saw two of the purses being carried by two knights, Phillipe and Gauthier d\u2019Aunay. Uncertain as to how the two brothers had acquired them, she wrote to her father suggesting the two men may have been having affairs with her sisters-in-law.\n\nKing Philip had the two knights placed under surveillance and later arrested along with his three daughters-in-law. It was alleged that Margaret and Blanche had had adulterous affairs with the d\u2019Aunay brothers over a period of years at Le Tour de Nesle, on the left bank of the Seine, opposite the Louvre. Joan was suspected of being complicit in the liaisons and was later also accused of adultery.\n\nUnder torture, both brothers gave details of the affairs and implicated Joan. The princesses were \u2018interviewed\u2019 but not tortured; confronted with the d\u2019Aunay\u2019s confession, Margaret and Blanche confessed; Joan continued to express her innocence. They were brought before a tribunal and found guilty. Margaret and Blanche were stripped of their clothes, dressed in sackcloth and their heads shaved. It is uncertain if Joan suffered the same punishment; the tribunal did not find her guilty but neither did they acquit her.\n\nThe women were taken to Pontoise in the north of Paris. There they were made to witness the d\u2019Aunay brother\u2019s execution. Phillipe and Gauthier were castrated and their private parts thrown to the dogs, then flayed alive; molten lead was then poured onto their exposed skin, their bodies strapped to a wheel and their bones broken with iron bars; they were then finally decapitated. Margaret and Blanche were sent to the imposing castle of Chateau Gaillard. Margaret was imprisoned in a high tower, open to the elements, given neither clothing nor bedding and little food.\n\nLouis\u2019 wife, Margaret of Burgundy\n\nBy the end of the year King Philip was dead. Because his wife\u2019s affair called into question the legitimacy of their only child, Jeanne, Louis needed to marry again quickly to secure the succession. During her imprisonment Margaret had remained married to Louis, but she died in August 1315, just five days before her husband, now King Louis X married his second wife. At the time the whisper on the streets of Paris was that she had been strangled on orders from her husband.\n\nLouis\u2019s new wife Clementina of Hungary was eight months pregnant when in 1316 Louis himself died following a game of real tennis. If she gave birth to a son, he would be king. Were she to give birth to a daughter, then the succession was less clear. Because Margaret and Louis were still married when Margaret died, their daughter Jeanne would outrank the newly born princess in the succession.\n\nClementina did indeed have a son, but he lived only five days. The Royal Regent, the dead King\u2019s brother Phillipe moved to secure the crown for himself, bypassing the stronger claim of his niece Jeanne.\n\nHe succeeded by invoking an ancient, obsolete legal code of the fifth-century Salian-Frankish kingdom (the present-day Somme and Isle de France). The particular clause was one that differentiates male from female inheritance. Men inherited landed property, but women could only inherit personal property. QED a woman could not inherit the Crown. This determination became known as \u2018Salic\u2019 law and over the centuries was a cornerstone of the French legal system.\n\nPhillipe assumed the throne as King Philip V but was still married to Joan. She had fared better than her sister princesses. She had always maintained her innocence and her imprisonment at Chateau Dourdan was more humane. Philip apparently still loved her and argued for her release, and she was accepted back at court. Now Queen of France, she was reunited with their four daughters.\n\nIn 1322 King Philip fell ill and died. Because of his introduction of Salic law, having no sons, none of his daughters could inherit. Thus the French Crown passed to his younger brother who became King Charles IV.\n\nPope John XXII annulling the marriage of Charles IV and Blanche\n\nCharles was still married to Blanche, who was languishing underground in primitive conditions in Chateau Galliard. As King he needed an heir: he paid the Pope to annul their marriage, a condition of which was that Blanche would be released and allowed to join a convent. She entered a Cistercian order at Maubuisson, north-west of Paris and lived until 1332, having given birth to an illegitimate daughter by her jailer while in prison in Chateau Galliard.\n\nWhen King Charles IV too died in 1328 with no male heir, the French court was thrown into turmoil. Charles was the third of Phillip IV\u2019s sons to succeed to the throne, but he would be the last of the Capetian line of Kings. He died leaving a pregnant wife, Jeanne d\u2019\u00c9vreux who again it was hoped was carrying the saviour of France. with the country now ruled by a Regent, Charles\u2019 nephew, Philip of Valois. But in April, Jeanne gave birth to a daughter, Blanche.\n\nThe French Crown could now pass to one of two contenders; Philip of Valois, Charles\u2019 nephew or the grandson of old King Philip IV through his daughter Isabelle, the King of England, Edward III. Blood meant Edward had a far stronger and more direct claim, but the French lords were not keen on having the King of England as their overlord.\n\nTo deny Edward, the French lords needed a justification for giving the Crown to Philip of Valois, and once more they invoked Scalic Law. Philip IV\u2019s daughter Isabelle could not pass on a claim to the French crown when she was not entitled to it. Hence Phillip of Valois became King Philip VI.\n\nAlthough \u2018Salic\u2019 law became a cornerstone of the French legal system, the same Salian-Frankish law code said, \u201c\u2026if the sons are dead then a daughter may receive land just as the sons would have done had they lived.\u201d The French nobility used Salic law to justify Philip of Valois becoming King, even though they knew that Edward III of England would fight for his \u2018right\u2019 to the French crown.\n\nEdward III\n\nThe decision was pivotal in Anglo-French relations, triggering the long-lasting conflict between them known to history as the Hundred Years War. Edward invaded France in 1337, keen to press his claim to the French throne and recreate the Angevin Empire of his ancestor Henry II. The war would last, on-and-off, until 1453 and would decimate the French nobility and leave the country economically devastated.\n\nWhat is ironic is that Isabelle developed a reputation as an infamous adulteress herself, having a high-profile affair with Roger Mortimer, the Earl of March and possibly having her husband Edward II murdered. She set in motion \u2018L\u2019affaire de la Tour de Nesle\u2019 which shook the French monarchy and directly contributed to the succession crisis in France that culminated in the Hundred Years War.\n\nWritten by Michael Long.

He had pretty elevated views on centralization of the government and the power of the monarchy; this was largely influenced by Roman law. He was also a pretty demanding king. But what was the significance of King Philip IV of France?\n\nWell first of all Philip was demanding. He demanded that all of the French people had to be loyal to him; regardless of any feudal obligations they had(the Feudal system in France was still going strong at this point). Also because of Roman law being such an influence to him, he surrounded himself with lawyers who were educated on Roman law, and the authority of the king.\n\nBecause of all the military conflicts, Philip always needed money; so like a lot of kings he raised heavy taxes on imports and exports, and also made a special war tax. He debased the currency, and despoiled the Jews, the bankers, and the Templar\u2019s; basically meaning he confiscated the riches of these individuals. Because the French Barron\u2019s owed military duties to the monarchy, Philip let them pay their way out of those duties, which in turn made him more money.\n\nThanks to him France became the first kingdom with representative assemblies being established. He established the Estates General, which was like a weaker version of the English Parliament; this was intended to help a monarch during a time of crisis. Also he established the Parliament of Paris, which consisted of ninety four lawyers and clerices.\n\nPhilip believed that the state and church had to be separate from each other, and that the State was supreme over the Church. He also believed that the French church should be independent from the Pope. The reason why he believed this was because the Pope had been deposing and excommunicating State officials including Kings for many years.\n\nIn summary, King Philip IV of France accomplished and did many things, good and bad. But most importantly he established the Estates General and the Paris Parliament which further strengthened and gained the power of the state or government."}, {"url": "https://www.roman-catholic-saints.com/victory-of-the-king-of-france.html", "page_content": "Victory of the King of France\n\nAugust 17: Victory of the King of France (Philip the Fair), imploring the help of Our Lady of Chartres (1304)\n\nIt was on this day in the year 1304 that Philip the Fair gained a signal victory over the Flemish after recommending himself to Our Lady of Chartres.\n\nThe eldest son of King Philip and Isabella of Aragon, he was nicknamed Philip the Fair while yet a prince of his handsome features. He became king of France at only 17 years of age, and married Joan of Navarre in 1284, which enlarged his kingdom.\n\nIn the year 1302, Philip sent an inadequate army into Flanders to suppress the Flemish, who were making incursions into his realm at will. His army was soundly defeated at the Battle of the Golden Spurs. Philip responded by winning a naval victory over the Flemish at Zierichzee, and then met the Flemish army at the Battle of Mons-en-Pevele, also known as Mons-en-Puelle, on August 17, 1304.\n\nThe battle was furious, lasting all day in extreme heat. Eventually the majority of the French army fled the field, leaving Philip alone with only ten knights fighting desperately to save themselves and their king. Philip\u2019s horse collapsed, having been killed under him, and his life was in great danger of being lost. At that moment, while facing death and certain defeat in battle, Philip turned to the Queen of Heaven, Our Lady of Chartres, begging her assistance to save the day and his life.\n\nSuddenly the French knights who had been fleeing the field turned and saw the king\u2019s royal standard still stood, and that he himself fought like a knight of great renown amidst a sea of raging enemies. Racing to the scene with their swords and lances, they turned the Flemish and drove them from the field in what became a resounding victory of the king of France. The Battle of the Golden Spurs was well compensated.\n\n\n\nIn gratitude for this victory and favor of Our Lady of Chartres, King Philip went at once to do homage to the Virgin Mary at her cathedral. He took off his own armor that he had worn in battle and gave it over to the church at the altar. He also gave to it in perpetuity the land and lordship of Barrus, founded a daily Mass for ever, and left to this church all of the other accoutrements which he had worn on that day of victory. This feast is kept in the Church of Notre Dame, at Paris, on the following day, the 18th, and the office is double.

At his mother\u2019s death (1482) he succeeded to her Netherlands dominions, with Maximilian acting as regent for him during his minority. When Philip became of age, his interest in the Netherlands was soon subordinated to his hopes for the Spanish succession. In 1496 Philip was married to Joan the Mad, daughter of Ferdinand II the Catholic of Aragon and Isabella I the Catholic of Castile; Joan later inherited the crown of Castile. From January 1502 to March 1503 Philip and Joan lived in Spain and received homage as prospective heirs to the kingdoms of Aragon and Castile.

His royal domain expanded after this union, as Champagne and Brie, inherited by Joan I, were annexed to his kingdom. The addition of the prosperous Champagne saw a considerable increase in the French royal revenue and the withdrawal of the autonomy of a large semi-independent fief.\n\nFollowing his father\u2019s death on October 5, 1285, Philip became the king of France. His coronation ceremony was held on January 6, 1286, at the \u2018Reims Cathedral.\u2019 He maintained distance from the public. He executed certain policies for his ministers, including the ones considered unpopular, and trusted and depended on a professional bureaucracy of legalists. Philip aimed at strengthening and expanding his kingdom. His rule saw the transition of France into a more bureaucratic kingdom, considered by many as a step toward modernity.\n\nWith the Aragonese affair being settled during the initial stage of his reign, Philip focussed in reinforcing the efforts of his predecessors in reforming and rationalizing the administration. He gave instructions to look into the conduct of royal officials. His moves, however, were not taken well by the ecclesiastics, nobles, and townsmen of his kingdom, who had earlier made profits from the more lenient policies of his predecessors.\n\nOne of the most notable wars during Philip\u2019s reign was the Anglo\u2013French War that revolved around Gascony and occurred from 1294 to 1298 and from 1300 to 1303. King of England Edward I held the Duchy of Aquitaine as a fief and a vassal to Philip and paid homage to Philip. The relation between the two allies, however, strained after the Fall of Acre in 1291.\n\nThings started deteriorating after a naval dispute between the English and the Normans (an ethnic group that originated in Normandy) in 1293. Following this, Edward I attempted to use his family connections to avoid war. Edward I also got engaged to Philip's sister, Margaret. In view of their upcoming wedding, it was decided that Edward I would voluntarily relinquish his continental lands to Philip as a sign of submission in his capacity as the duke of Aquitaine. In return, Philip would forgive Edward and restore his land after a grace period. This agreement maintained peace until 1294.\n\nThe outbreak of hostilities with England in 1294 was the inevitable result of the competitive expansionist monarchies.\n\nAlthough the Gascony campaign of 1294 that lasted till 1303 witnessed French military victory, the war concluded after Philip and Edward I signed the \u2018Treaty of Paris\u2019 on May 20, 1303. The treaty restored the English possession of Aquitaine and Gascony, apart from confirming Philip's daughter Isabella\u2019s marriage with Edward I\u2019s son, Edward of Caernarvon (later King Edward II of England). The war, nevertheless, set the stage for future conflicts between France and England, paving way for the Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131453).\n\nAnother major conflict that occurred during his reign was the Franco\u2013Flemish War fought between the French kingdom and the County of Flanders between 1297 and 1305. The Flemish victory on July 11, 1302, during the Battle of the Golden Spurs, a conflict between royal French army and rebellious forces of the County of Flanders, in pursuit of suppressing an uprising in Flanders, caused a lot of embarrassment to Philip.\n\nHe wanted to avenge the defeat of the Battle of the Golden Spurs and led the French army in person in the Battle of Mons-en-P\u00e9v\u00e8le on August 18, 1304. The latter resulted in a decisive French victory and the signing of the \u2018Treaty of Athis-sur-Orge\u2019 on June 23, 1305. According to the somewhat harsh treaty that the Flemish were compelled to accept, Walloon Flanders, comprising the burgraviates of Lille, Douai, and Orchies, was added to the French kingdom, while the independence of the Flanders as a fief of the French kingdom was recognized.\n\nHe maintained diplomacy with the Mongols and had contacts with the mighty Mongols in the Middle East. Although Franco\u2013Mongol alliances against the Muslim Mamluks were planned several times, Philip never executed military plans related to this venture.\n\nWhen Philip ascended to the French throne, the kingdom was already under heavy debt incurred from his father\u2019s war with Aragon. Although he managed to pay off the debt, his subsequent wars with Aragon, England, and Flanders, along with the decline in silver production in Saxony, led his government into fiscal deficits.\n\nPhilip was in debt to both the Jews of France and the order of the \u2018Knights Templar\u2019 and considered them as a \"state within the state.\u201d On July 22, 1306, he ordered the expulsion of the Jews. He confiscated their property on August 23 that year. He also destroyed the order of the \u2018Knights Templar\u2019 the following year, thus erasing his debt against both.\n\nIn pursuit of bolstering his monarchy, Philip attempted to raise the tax of the French clergy. This was followed by a fierce conflict with Pope Boniface VIII, leading to the arrest and maltreatment of the Pope by Philip, the former\u2019s death in 1303, and the eventual transfer of the papal court to the enclave of Avignon in 1309.\n\nIn 1312, he won Lyon for France."}, {"url": "https://fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/objects-and-artworks/highlights/context/patrons-donors-collectors/philip-the-fair", "page_content": "Though it is not know precisely for whom Honor\u00e9\u2019s magnificent edition of La Somme le Roi was made, it might have belonged to Philip IV, \u2018the Fair\u2019, of France.

Disagreements with Pope Boniface VIII over the king\u2019s right to tax the clergy led to a threat of excommunication, which Philip countered by arresting the Pope at Anagni.\n\nAlthough he was soon released, Boniface died shortly after this incident and in 1305, after the short papacy of Benedict XI, Philip secured the election of a Frenchman as pope: Clement V, who installed himself in Avignon in 1309. For nearly seventy years, Avignon in southern France, rather the Vatican in Rome, was the seat of the papacy.\n\nWith a sympathetic pope on home soil, Philip embarked upon a series of persecutions aimed at increasing his wealth. He seized property belonging to the Jews, the Lombards \u2013 predominantly Italian bankers and moneylenders \u2013 and, most notoriously, the Knights Templar.\n\nThe Knights Templar were an order of warrior monks, founded in 1118 at the end of the First Crusade, to protect Christian pilgrims to the Holy Land.

The motherless Philip and his three brothers saw little of their father, who, stricken by Isabella\u2019s death, threw himself into campaigning and administrative affairs. His troubled childhood and the series of blows he suffered explain in some measure the conflicting elements in his adult personality. In 1274 his father married Marie de Brabant, a beautiful and cultivated woman, and, with her arrival at court, intrigue began to flourish. In the same year, the two-year-old Joan, heiress of Champagne and Navarre, was welcomed as a refugee. Reared with the royal children, she would, when she was 12, become the bride of Philip the Fair.\n\nIn 1276 Philip\u2019s elder brother, Louis, died, and the shock of this event, which suddenly made Philip heir to the kingdom, was compounded by persistent rumours of poisoning and suspicions that Philip\u2019s stepmother intended to see Isabella\u2019s remaining sons destroyed.

He was a major figure in the Third Crusade to the Holy Land in 1191.\n\nWhen the count of Flanders allied himself with the Champagne faction , there followed a serious revolt against the king. In the Peace of Boves, in July 1185 (confirmed by the Treaty of Gisors in May 1186), the king and the count of Flanders composed their differences (which had been chiefly over possession of Vermandois, in Picardy) so that the disputed territory was partitioned, Amiens and numerous other places passing to the king and the remainder, with the county of Vermandois proper, being left provisionally to Philip of Alsace. Thenceforward the king was free to run against Henry II of England.\n\nWhen Henry II of England arrived in Normandy, perhaps with the intention of responding to an appeal by the house of Champagne, Philip II entered into negotiations with him and, at Gisors on June 28, 1180, renewed an understanding that Louis VII had reached with him in 1177. As a result, the house of Champagne was politically isolated, and Philip II was making all decisions for himself and acting as he saw fit when his father died, on September 18, 1180, leaving him sole king in name as well as in fact.\n\nPhilip was the son of Louis VII of France and Adela of Champagne. In order to be associated as king with his father, who had fallen mortally ill, he was crowned at Reims on November 1, 1179. His uncles of the house of Champagne\u2014Henry I, count of Champagne; Guillaume, archbishop of Reims; and Thibaut V, count of Blois and Chartres\u2014hoped to use the youthful king to control France. To escape from their tutelage , Philip on April 28, 1180, married Isabella, the daughter of Baldwin V of Hainaut and the niece (through her mother) of Philip of Alsace, the count of Flanders, who promised to give the king the territory of Artois as her dowry.\n\nTerritorial expansion\n\nHenry\u2019s French possessions\u2014the so-called Angevin empire, consisting of Normandy, Maine, Anjou, and Touraine, with Aquitaine in the hands of his son, the future Richard I the Lion-Heart of England, and Brittany ruled by another son, Geoffrey (died 1186)\u2014all were a constant menace to the French royal domain. Furthermore, there were long-standing disputes over the Vexin (between Normandy and the \u00cele-de-France), Berry, and Auvergne.\n\nPhilip II launched an attack on Berry in the summer of 1187 but then in June made a truce with Henry, which left Issoudun in his hands and also granted him Fr\u00e9teval, in Vend\u00f4mois. Though the truce was for two years, Philip found grounds for resuming hostilities in the summer of 1188. He skillfully exploited the estrangement between Henry and Richard, and Richard did homage to him voluntarily at Bonmoulins in November 1188. Finally, by the Treaty of Azay-le-Rideau, or of Colombi\u00e8res (July 4, 1189), Henry was forced to renew his own homage, to confirm the cession of Issoudun, with Gra\u00e7ay also, to Philip, and to renounce his claim to suzerainty over Auvergne. Henry died two days later.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nRichard, who succeeded Henry as king of England, had already undertaken to go on Crusade against Saladin in the Holy Land (the Third Crusade), and Philip now did likewise. Before his departure, he made the so-called Testament of 1190 to provide for the government of his kingdom in his absence. On his way to Palestine, he met Richard in Sicily, where they promptly found themselves at variance, though they made a treaty at Messina in March 1191. Arriving in Palestine, they cooperated against the Muslims at Acre, until Philip fell ill and made his illness a pretext for returning to France, quite determined to settle the succession to Flanders (Philip of Alsace had just died on the Crusade) while Richard was still absent. Thus, by the end of 1191, Philip II was back in France.\n\nIn spite of promises he had made in the Holy Land, Philip at once prepared to attack the Plantagenet possessions in France. Informed of this, Richard also left the Crusade but was taken prisoner while on his way back by the duke of Austria, Leopold V of Babenberg. Philip did everything he could to prolong his rival\u2019s captivity, but Richard was at last set free (1194) and went to war against Philip. The French king suffered a number of defeats (from that at Fr\u00e9teval in July 1194 to that at Courcelles in September 1198) in a series of campaigns that were occasionally punctuated by negotiations. It was fortuitous for Philip, however, when Richard was killed in April 1199.\n\nRichard\u2019s brother John was by no means as formidable a fighter. Moreover, his right to Richard\u2019s succession could be contested by Arthur of Brittany, whose father had been senior to John. To secure the succession, therefore, John came to terms with Philip: by the Treaty of Le Goulet (May 22, 1200), in return for Philip\u2019s recognition of him as Richard\u2019s heir, he ceded \u00c9vreux and the Norman Vexin to Philip; agreed that Issoudun and Gra\u00e7ay should be the dowry of his niece Blanche of Castile, who was to marry the future Louis VIII (Philip\u2019s son by Isabella of Hainaut); and renounced any claim to suzerainty over Berry and Auvergne.\n\nShortly afterward, however, John entered into conflict with the Lusignan family of Poitou (in Aquitaine), who appealed to Philip as overlord. When he was summoned to appear before the royal court as a vassal of the French crown, John did not present himself, and Philip, in April 1202, pronounced John\u2019s French fiefs forfeit and undertook to carry out the sentence himself. He invaded Normandy, overran the northeast, and laid siege to Arques, while Arthur of Brittany, the son of Geoffrey, who died some years before, campaigned against John\u2019s supporters in Poitou; but John, marching south from Maine, captured Arthur at Mirebeau (August 1). In fury, Philip abandoned the siege of Arques and marched southwestward to Tours, ravaging John\u2019s territory on his way before returning to Paris. Guillaume des Roches, the powerful seneschal of Anjou, who had taken John\u2019s side, came to terms with Philip in March 1203.\n\nResuming operations against Normandy, Philip occupied the towns around the great fortress of Ch\u00e2teau-Gaillard, to which he laid siege in September 1203, having overruled Pope Innocent III\u2019s attempts to mediate. John, who is reported to have murdered Arthur of Brittany in April, retired to England in December, and Ch\u00e2teau-Gaillard fell to Philip in March 1204. Rouen, the Norman capital, surrendered in June, after 40 days\u2019 resistance.\n\nAfter his conquest of Normandy, Philip subdued Maine, Touraine, Anjou, and most of Poitou with less difficulty (1204\u201305), though the castles of Loches and Chinon held out for a year. He sought to secure his conquests by lavishing privileges on the towns and on the religious houses but otherwise left the local barons in power. Unrest, however, was endemic in Poitou, and in June 1206 John landed at La Rochelle. After a campaign in the south, he turned north toward the Loire. At Thouars in October 1206, he and Philip made a two-year truce, leaving John in possession of the reconquered Poitevin lands. In the following year, however, Philip invaded Poitou again; and, after a further campaign in 1208, only the south and part of the west of Poitou remained loyal to John (with Saintonge, Guyenne, and Gascony).\n\nPhilip next hoped to exploit the dispute between John and Pope Innocent III. While Innocent was threatening to declare John unfit to reign (1212), plans were being made for a French landing in England and for the accession of Philip\u2019s son Louis to the English throne. The plans had to be dropped when John made his submission to the pope (1213). Throwing himself into schemes for revenge, John formed a coalition against France: the Holy Roman emperor Otto IV, the count of Flanders (Ferrand, or Ferdinand, of Portugal), and the count of Boulogne (Raynald, or Renaud, of Dammartin) were to invade the Capetian territory from the northeast while John attacked from the west, with the help of his Poitevin barons.\n\nJohn landed at La Rochelle in February 1214 and advanced into Anjou but was put to flight by Louis at La Roche-aux-Moines on July 2; his confederates were completely defeated by Philip in the decisive Battle of Bouvines on July 27. The Anglo-Angevin power in France and the coalition had both been broken in one month. Thus Philip, who, in 1213, had transferred Brittany to his cousin Peter of Dreux, was left without any significant opposition to his rule in France.\n\nIt was not only at the Plantagenets\u2019 expense that Philip enlarged the royal domain. His claim to Artois through his first marriage and his gains by the settlement of 1185\u201386 have been mentioned above, and he subsequently proceeded, step by step, to acquire the rest of Vermandois and Valois. His insistence on his suzerainty over vacant fiefs and on his tutelage over minors and heiresses was particularly effective with regard to Flanders, where two successive Flemish counts, Philip of Alsace (died 1191) and Baldwin IX (died c. 1205) had left no male issue.\n\nThough he did not personally take part in the Crusade proclaimed by Pope Innocent III against a Cathari religious sect in Languedoc, Philip allowed his vassals and knights to carry it out. Simon de Montfort\u2019s capture of B\u00e9ziers and Carcassonne (1209) and his victory at Muret over Raymond VI of Toulouse and Peter II of Aragon (1213) prepared the way for the eventual annexation of eastern Languedoc to the royal domain six years after Philip\u2019s death and for the union of northern and southern France under Capetian rule."}, {"url": "https://www.factinate.com/people/facts-philip-ii-france/", "page_content": "For all the great things he did for France\u2014including building the beautiful Louvre\u2014we will likely remember Philip II for one thing. He was the French King who locked his wife in a tower. If it sounds like a fairy tale, think again. His wife spent 20 harrowing years in a tower, and there were no animated talking animals or long locks of hair to get her out. Philip was as tough as nails, but he had a reason for keeping away from his wives. It was a dark secret that he would take to his grave.\n\n1. He Came From God\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Philip was born, in Gonesse on August 21, 1165, his dad was already really old. Because Louis VII was 45 when Philip was born, they gave the baby a nickname: God-given. After having four children with two different wives, Philip was the first son. Philip\u2019s mother, Adela of Champagne, was the King\u2019s third wife and was 25 when she had Philip.\n\nPhilip was a literal gift from god, as far as his father was concerned. But that came with its own kind of fear.\n\n2. He Got Sick\n\nBecause of his age and ill health, Louis was in a hurry to get Philip declared his co-ruler. When Philip was just a teenager, Louis thought it was time. When father and son went on a hunting trip, however, the worst happened: young Philip became ill. Now, what they had on their hands was an aging and frail king and a sickly king-to-be. Things didn\u2019t look good for Louis, so he took matters into his own hands\u2014literally.\n\n3. He Prayed Passionately\n\nLouis\u2019 solution to the problem of his ill son was to go on a pilgrimage. There was a Shrine of Thomas Becket that Louis thought would be able to cure his son. Once he got there, Louis fell onto his knees, clasped his hands together, and began to passionately pray for his son\u2019s recovery. While still at the shrine, Louis got a message: Philip was in recovery. A very relieved Louis happily headed back home.\n\nUnfortunately, Louis should have also been praying for his own health.\n\n4. Neither Was Fit\n\nOn his way back from the Shrine of Thomas Becket, Louis suffered a terrible stroke. Wow, it seemed that neither Philip nor his father was healthy enough to be a lasting king. Too bad: There weren\u2019t any other options. They were the heads of the House of Capet. If neither of them was king, another house would take over\u2014and that would be an unthinkable tragedy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. They Made Him King\n\nLouis survived the stroke, but now he was even more desperate to make his son king. Philip was only 14 years old, but that didn\u2019t matter. He was old enough to rule France\u2026hopefully. On November 1, 1179, the Archbishop William of the White Hands anointed Philip the King of France in an elaborate ceremony. Once they\u2019d settled that, they realized they needed something else: a queen.\n\n6. They Were Just Kids\n\nLouis was quickly trying to tie up loose ends before the end of his life. So, he came up with someone that could marry his son. Her name was Isabella of Hainault, and on her wedding day she was 10 years old and her groom was 14. The two may have been in the \u201ceww yuck\u201d stage when it came to the opposite gender, but that didn\u2019t matter. This was a marriage of advantage\u2014and it was a big one.\n\n7. She Was Legit\n\nSo, who was this 10-year-old bride that Louis wanted his son to marry? Isabella\u2019s parents were a count and a countess\u2014so they were legitimately royal. Isabella also brought with her a dowry. Now, this wasn\u2019t a bunch of chickens and a bushel of grain. No, this dowry was a full county: the County of Artois. This large chunk of land would serve France well.\n\nBut even with that amazing dowry, not everybody was happy with this marriage.\n\n8. She Wasn\u2019t Wanted\n\nThe first, and most important person, who wasn\u2019t happy with Philip\u2019s marriage to Isabella was Philip\u2019s mother. Believe it or not, Isabella\u2014as young as she was\u2014had another man she was supposed to marry. When Isabella was just one year old, her father promised her to Henry, who was not only the Count of Champagne, but also Adela\u2019s nephew. Adela was not happy that her nephew lost his betrothed.\n\nBut, come to think of it, Adela wasn\u2019t happy about a lot of things.\n\n9. He Was Too Young\n\nAdela wasn\u2019t happy about her nephew losing his bride to Philip. She also wasn\u2019t happy about Philip being king at all. She and Philip\u2019s four uncles all thought that it wasn\u2019t a good idea for the ailing Louis to hand the throne over to Philip while he was still so young. Well, it turned out that Louis made the right decision. Less than a year after Philip became the king, Louis finally croaked.\n\nThey now had a 14-year-old king in charge of the country.

Making distraction rewarding since 2017.\n\n10. He Got Down To Business\n\nPhilip was now king and he had something he wanted to do. His father had been quite friendly with Jewish people and even protected them. Philip didn\u2019t have the same sympathy as his father. Soon after becoming king, Philip took away all of the Jews\u2019 property. He then made them convert to Christianity. But this was just the beginning. Two years later, he went even further.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n11. He Wasn\u2019t Done\n\nPhilip wasn\u2019t through with his persecution of the Jews yet. In 1182, he kicked all the Jews out of the royal demesne\u2014the land the royal family held. He also wanted to build a market in Paris called Les Halles. To build the marketplace he tore down houses; all of them owned by Jews. All terrible\u2014but not nearly the worst part of Philip\u2019s prosecution. That goes to the burning of nearly 100 Jews in Brie-Comte-Robert.\n\nMaybe you\u2019d think a young king would be more merciful. Not the case with Philip II.\n\n12. He Was Disappointed\n\nIn spite of Adela\u2019s complaints, Isabella became queen on May 28, 1180, just a month after getting married to Philip. Now remember, Isabella was still just ten years old when she became queen. By the time she was 14, Philip was less than thrilled with her\u2014for a very outrageous reason: she hadn\u2019t produced a son yet. I guess being 14 was a little different back then than it is now.\n\nThere was, however, another reason for Philip to be angry at his wife.\n\n13. He Was For The Other Team\n\nAround the time that Philip was hoping for a son from his teenage bride, he was also fighting a battle against Flanders. In the midst of the conflict, he saw something that turned his stomach. His father-in-law\u2014Isabella\u2019s father\u2014was supporting Flanders. How could he have a wife whose father was for the other team? That was it for Philip. In his eyes, his wife was a dud, and he had to get rid of her.\n\n14. She Did Something Drastic\n\nIsabella couldn\u2019t give Philip a son, and her father was with his enemies. No wonder he wanted a divorce. It wasn\u2019t, however, called divorce back then: They called it repudiation. Isabella found out that her husband wanted her out, and she realized that only something drastic would keep her married to Philip and\u2014more importantly\u2014the queen of France. So she came up with a plan.\n\n15. She Dressed Down\n\nTo remain the Queen of France, Isabella needed to act. She stripped off her shoes and put on the clothes of a penitent\u2014someone who was very sorry\u2014and walked into the church. What she was trying to do was get sympathy from the people. She thought they would see her in bare feet and rags for clothes and maybe let her keep her position as queen. But could this really work? Were the people so easily manipulated?\n\n16. They Yelled And Screamed\n\nThe answer is yes. The people saw poor Isabella and wanted to help her. A large group went to the palace and began to yell. They wanted to let the palace know that Philip could not just toss Isabella aside. They wanted her to continue to be their queen. Inside the palace was Philip\u2019s uncle Robert\u2014one of the ones against the marriage in the first place.\n\nHe heard the angry people, and he hatched a plan of his own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n17. He Had An Ulterior Motive\n\nRobert knew he couldn\u2019t win against a crowd so strong and passionate, so he decided to stop Philip from repudiating his bride. Robert, however, had an ulterior motive. He knew that losing Isabella also meant losing the county of Artois. Isabella was here to stay\u2014for now, at least. Her plan had worked, but if she wanted to stick around, she needed to get down to producing a male heir for her husband.\n\n18. She Came Through\n\nIn 1187, when she was 17 years old, Isabella finally gave birth to a son, and they called him Louis after his grandfather. This would finally cement her position as the Queen of France. But Philip and Isabella weren\u2019t happy with just one son. Sure, baby Louis would be an heir to the throne, but having a few backups would be a good idea. Soon, Isabella was pregnant again.\n\n19. It Was Doomed\n\nIn 1190 Isabella gave birth again. This time it was to twin boys\u2014talk about going overboard to make a husband happy. It did, however, end up being a tragic birth for nearly everyone involved. The first child, Robert, passed on the same day he was born. The heartbreak, however, wasn\u2019t over. The next day, Isabella died due to complications from the difficult pregnancy. Well, at least they still had her second son Philip. Sadly, he also passed\u2014two days after his mother.\n\nIt was time to give poor Philip the bad news.\n\n20. He Got The News\n\nWhile all this tragedy was taking place, where was Philip? He was off doing what kings do: He was in Normandy battling it out with Richard I of England. The news of his wife\u2019s\u2014and twin boys\u2019\u2014passing led him to do something strange: He signed a quick truce and sped back to Paris. Once there, Philip checked that they had buried Isabella properly, mourned for about a week, and then immediately went back to Normandy.\n\nI guess a king\u2019s work is never done.\n\n21. It Was A Big Day\n\nThree years after his wife\u2019s demise, Philip was in search of a second wife. Obviously, things were different back then. For example, nowadays some couples have two anniversaries: one for the day they met and one for the wedding day. For Philip and his next wife, the two days would be the same. You see they met and married on the same day. But how was this possible?\n\n22. He Gave It Another Shot\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly clear what Philip\u2019s motives were for getting married this time. His bride was Ingeborg, whose father was the King of Denmark. Maybe it was the dowry that she brought to the marriage: a very significant 10,000 marks. It was a good sum, but was it worth getting married for? Judging by his behavior at the wedding, it seemed that Philip wasn\u2019t sure why he got married either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n23. He Looked Unwell\n\nAt a dinner after the wedding, Philip was not looking well. Observers could tell something was wrong. Philip was visibly pale and sickly. It seemed like he couldn\u2019t wait for the ceremony to end. Once the formalities were over, he sprang into action. He sent his new bride to a convent and went straight to the Pope. What he asked the Pope for was nothing short of unbelievable.\n\n24. He Wanted Out\n\nWhat Philip wanted from the Pope was an end to his new marriage\u2014which was only a few hours old. Of course, Pope Celestine III was dumbstruck. How could Philip want the marriage annulled after such a short time? When he asked Philip why, the new groom said it was because he and his wife had not consummated the marriage.\n\nAnd when was that to have happened, Philip? Between the main course and the salad? Obviously, Philip wanted out\u2014but his reason made no sense.\n\n25. He Said, She Said\n\nWord got to Ingeborg that Philip was claiming that the two had never consummated the marriage. Her speedy answer was something like: \u201cum\u2026 we absolutely did.\u201d This was becoming a very early version of the \u201che said, she said\u201d game. Philip soon gave up on winning this, so he quickly locked on to another way to end his just-begun marriage.\n\n26. He Had A Plan B\n\nPhilip\u2019s next plan was to prove that he and Ingeborg couldn\u2019t be husband and wife because they shared family blood. While some royal families rely on cousin-to-cousin marriages, this one forbade them. Philip brought out a family tree that showed that he and his new wife came from the same family. A council inspected the tree, agreed with Philip, and voided the marriage.\n\nThere was only one problem: Philip\u2019s family tree was totally fake.\n\n27. She Wasn\u2019t About To Give Up\n\nThe council may have voided her marriage, but Ingeborg wasn\u2019t about to give up on being the Queen of France. To prove her husband wrong, she got someone to draw up a real family tree. Everyone who saw the tree could plainly see that there was no problem with Philip and Ingeborg being husband and wife. Now all she had to do was convince the Pope.\n\n28. They Besought Him\n\nA group of Danes set out to meet the Pope and talk to him for Ingeborg. They showed him the real family tree and the Pope agreed: They were okay to be husband and wife. Instead of punishing Philip, the Pope simply canceled the annulment and told Phillip that he couldn\u2019t marry anyone else because he already had a perfectly good wife. The Pope\u2019s decision was clear, but would Philip abide by the verdict?\n\n29. They Were Interrupted\n\nPhilip had already found a new bride\u201413-year-old Margaret\u2014and she was en route from Geneva. Her father, William I of Geneva had approved of the match and was taking his daughter to Paris himself. On the way to Paris, however, the entourage came under attack from Thomas, Count of Savoy. When Thomas took one look at young Margaret, he decided he wanted her for himself. He forcibly removed Margaret from her father, and off they went into the sunset.\n\n30. He Lost Another One\n\nPoor Margaret was pretty much Thomas\u2019s prisoner, but soon something happened to count: he fell in love with the girl he\u2019d taken by force. The only good thing to say about Thomas is that at least he was age appropriate. He was 15 years old to Margaret\u2019s 13. They eventually tied the knot, had 14 kids, and lived happily ever after\u2014or as happy as you can be when you consider the circumstances. Great for them, but Philip was still without a replacement for Ingeborg.\n\nAnd what about Ingeborg? Where was she during all this?\n\n31. He Locked Her Up\n\nPhilip had taken Ingeborg and put her in a prison. Well, the prison was a castle, so maybe it wasn\u2019t that bad. The reality was that she was not free to go as she pleased. While he had Ingeborg locked away, Philip was free to play. Three years after their bizarre marriage, Philip had found another bride\u2014I guess there was no shortage when you were the King of France. In June 1196, Philip married Agnes of Merania.\n\nOf course, according to the Pope, this meant that Philip had two wives, which was a big no-no.\n\n32. He Said It Wasn\u2019t A Marriage\n\nWhen the Pope got wind of Philip\u2019s marriage to Agnes, he wanted to put a stop to it. He said that the marriage between Philip and Agnes wasn\u2019t a marriage at all. Philip heard what the Pope had to say and did absolutely nothing. He continued to live with Agnes as husband and wife. Now remember there was no internet or phones, so it took a while for the Pope to find out. But when he did, he was more than a little angry.\n\n33. They Were Out\n\nWhen, in 1199, the Pope found out that Philip was ignoring him, he put all of France under an interdict. This meant that France was now outside of the world that the Pope had jurisdiction over. This was pretty serious business if your country is determined to be Catholic. This interdict lasted about a year until something tragic happened to change it. In the meantime, Ingeborg was still in limbo.\n\n34. She Begged For Help\n\nIngeborg was still in a castle prison, and it turned out that it was certainly no day at the spa. She sent letters to Philip saying that the conditions she lived under were harsh. Her captors in the castle were mistreating her, and she was considering ending her life. Instead of showing his wife compassion, he just changed her location\u2014and it wasn\u2019t to a place that was better. In fact, it was much worse.\n\n35. He Made It Worse\n\nWhen Philip received news that his wife was in despair, he didn\u2019t do anything to help her. In fact. He made her life even worse: He locked her in a tower. She was a prisoner in the tower, and to make matters even worse, her captors didn\u2019t give her enough food to eat. To add to her discomfort, Philip didn\u2019t allow her to have any visitors. Here she was, the Queen of France and living like a common criminal.\n\n36. He Got The Boot\n\nWith his bride safely locked away, Philip continued living with his other wife\u2014the one that the Pope had forbidden him to live with. Philip and Agnes had two children, and this made the Pope even angrier. After all, these children were illegitimate. The Pope then went a step further: He kicked Philip out of the church. You\u2019d think Philip wouldn\u2019t care about this. But he did care. He cared a lot. He promised that he would separate from Agnes.\n\n37. It Was Three Time Unlucky\n\nEven though Philip and Agnes were officially separated, she somehow became pregnant with his third child. Child number three was unlucky for Agnes, and she died during delivery. Philip wanted the Pope to declare the children he had with Agnes legitimate, and\u2014in 1201\u2014he begged the Pope to grant him this wish. The Pope, who should have known better, decided to agree because this\u2026well, it would help him politically.\n\nThe Pope seemed to now be on Philip\u2019s side\u2014which was going to make Philip\u2019s life much easier. But could Philip count on the Pope for everything he wanted?\n\n38. He Tried Again\n\nPhilip was now down to just one wife, but he still didn\u2019t really want her. He made another visit to the Pope and again asked for an annulment of his marriage to Ingeborg. Of course, the Pope wanted to know the reason. So far, Philip had tried a lack of consummation and a false family tree as reasons for annulment. What else could he try?\n\n39. He Went Out On A Limb\n\nIt was time for Philip to get really creative. This time he told the Pope that he needed an annulment because of witchcraft. He said that Ingeborg had used witchcraft, which made it impossible for the two to have marital relations. Even the Pope, who seemed to have Philip\u2019s back at this point, couldn\u2019t get on board with this idea. Philip was stuck with Ingeborg. A wife he had never seemed to want at all.\n\n40. He Had A Change of Heart\n\nPhilip seemed to still have no interest in having Ingeborg as his wife. He did, however, want to have a claim to the throne of the Kingdom of England. He realized that the way to this throne would be easier because of Ingeborg\u2019s ties to the Danish throne. Suddenly Philip wanted his wife back. But after all he\u2019d done to her, did she really want to be with him? What did she see in him anyway?\n\n41. He Was Handsome\n\nPhilip, in spite of treating women badly, was a bit of a catch. By this age, he already had no hair, but people described him as \u201ca handsome strapping fellow\u201d. He enjoyed living well, which included drinking and fooling around with women. Sounds to me like a young Bruce Willis. But what about his personality, what was that like?\n\n42. He Was Generous\n\nPhilip may have locked his wife in a tower, but to his friends he was generous. If he didn\u2019t like you, however, you didn\u2019t get much from him. He was quick to judge and was good at strategizing. When he came across a powerful man, he\u2019d be very tough. If he came across someone poor, he\u2019d likely feed them. Also, as we\u2019ll see next, he held a grudge: even against someone as important as the Pope.\n\n43. He Paid Him Back\n\nWhile the Pope had sometimes supported Philip\u2014and other times not\u2014it was now time for the Pope to need a favor from Philip. There was a group of people in Languedoc who were living a life that went against everything the Catholic Church preached. The Pope asked Philip to help him straighten them out\u2014with whatever force was necessary.\n\nPhilip seemed to only remember the times when the Pope didn\u2019t have his back, and so he gave him the same treatment.\n\n44. He Built A Lot of Stuff\n\nSo, what good, if anything, did Philip do for France? He actually did quite a bit. One of the biggest and most useful was to get workers to pave the streets of Paris. He also built the marketplace, Les Halles. While Notre Dame de Paris was already under construction when Philip became King, he did make sure that they completed it. He also oversaw the construction of the Louvre. Of course, back then it wasn\u2019t an art gallery but a fortress.\n\nAll this construction was a huge boon for Paris and remains a draw for tourists today.\n\n45. He Helped with Education and Drinks\n\nAnother area that Philip worked on was education. The University of Paris received a charter from Philip, and Paris became known as the \u201cfirst city of teachers\u201d. People were comparing it to Athens as far as being a great world civilization. He also helped the grape-crushing industry by creating The Battle of the Wines: a competition that helped make France a leader in all things red, white, and rose.\n\nProbably the biggest change Philip made, however, was how France looked on a map.\n\n46. He Stretched It\n\nBefore Philip, France was a third of the size it was after his reign. Through his sheer will and hard work, he got a hold of the land north of Loire that had long belonged to the English. This was a vital move as it got France to the sea in the north. He really did manage to bring France closer to how we see it on the map today. And what about that deep dark secret? It\u2019s coming up next.\n\n47. He May Have Played For the Other Team\n\nNo one ever figured out why Philip turned his back so strongly against some of his wives. In his 1966 stage play, The Lion in Winter, playwright James Goldman shed some light as to why. The play suggests that maybe Philip didn\u2019t like women at all. In the play, Philip and Richard the Lionhearted are in fact lovers. Shocker! But is there anything behind this theory at all?\n\n48. They Shared A Bed\n\nThere is something in the records that suggests that Philip and Richard were lovers. Apparently, the two kings spent at least one night together in the same bed. Let\u2019s remember, one night between two men in a bed hardly makes Philip gay. But wait a minute: this is the only night that we know about\u2014there may have been many more. On the other hand, some call the night more of a stunt in order to unify France and England and have even compared it to a \u201cphoto op\u201d.\n\nSadly, I guess we\u2019ll never know the truth.\n\n49. He Felt Ill\n\nIn September 1222, when he was 57 years old, Philip became ill. Thinking it was the end, he wrote out his will. His sickness continued through to the next year, and his fever just got worse in the summer\u2019s intense heat. When he started to feel a little better, he decided to take a trip to Paris. Halfway through his journey\u2014in Mantes-la-Jolie\u2014he passed. He was 58 years old.\n\n50. He Had A Last Word\n\nBefore he passed, Philip had a chance to speak to his son, and the future king, Louis VIII. He told his son to treat Ingeborg well. Because of this parting message, Ingeborg could at least enjoy her remaining years. She\u2019d been captive in castles and in a tower for 20 years, and she now lived as the legitimate Queen of France. Incidentally, she outlived Philip by a whopping 14 years.\n\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7"}, {"url": "https://www.discoverwalks.com/blog/history/10-of-the-most-handsome-kings/", "page_content": "Photo by Mitya Ivanov on Unsplash\n\n10 of the most Handsome Kings\n\nShare 1\n\nPin\n\n\n\nRoyals have always tended to be in the limelight for all good and bad. They have been scrutinized from their looks to their deeds being the public figures they are.\n\nIn fairy tales, kings and princes are always shown to be the best-looking in the kingdom. All females admire their handsomeness. They always manage to snatch up the most beautiful girl to marry.\n\nIn this time and age, it might seem shallow, or even wrong, to rank the most handsome kings. However, that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening here. We are going to be swooning over ridiculously good-looking kings both in history and in the present.\n\n1. King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, of Bhutan\n\nKing Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck is known as the \u2018Asian Elvis\u2019. The King of Bhutan and his slicked-back quiff also go by the name \u2018the Dragon King\u2019.\n\nHe drove Bhutan to the great height of success and is often credited as the \u201c king of Destiny \u201cwho ultimately changed the fate of Bhutan enhancing economic growth, prospering nation, peace, happiness, and others.\n\nHe is an alumnus of Magdalen College, Oxford. He has a swarm of female fans in Thailand, where he was nicknamed \u2018Prince Charming\u2019 by the press. They love him in India and Japan too. He\u2019s the perfect mix of ancient and modern.\n\n2. Alexander The Great\n\nKing Alexander was termed Alexander the Great because he conquered Persia, Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, Bactria, and Punjab by the time he was 32; He was extremely good in a fight; He was a real animal person \u2013 he named cities after his horse, Bucephalus, and his dog, Peritas; He was taught by Aristotle.\n\nHe liked to portray himself to people as being superhuman. He was described by Plutarch as having a melting glance and a very pleasant odor.\n\nHe was blond, brave, and well-built.\n\n3. King Felipe VI of Spain\n\nKing Felipe VI was sporty, glamorous, and enormously tall. He was six-foot-five-and-a-half.\n\nFelipe is relatively new to the king game, having ascended the throne in 2014 when his father stepped down.\n\nHe is forward-thinking and thoroughly modern. He is the youngest monarch in Europe.\n\nHis salt-and-pepper beard only accentuates his good looks.\n\n4. Richard The Lionheart\n\nKing Richard has a lot of negative traits. He was rumored to have killed his father. He spoke hardly any English. And, he spent most of his reign abroad.\n\nHe however did know how to dress! The red cape with the lions on it and the nice big sword set him out from other kings.\n\nThe name Lionheart added to his allure as it only suggested exciting things.\n\n5. King Henry VIII\n\nKing Henry VIII towards the end was fat and angry.\n\nHenry VIII was a handsome, clever, charismatic; good-at-tennis catch in his youth, renowned for his fine calves (a measure of Tudor attractiveness) and deftness with a joust. So he wasn\u2019t great with women, but you can\u2019t say he wasn\u2019t a trier \u2013 and that has to count for something.\n\n6. King Phillip IV\n\nPhilip the Handsome also called the Fair, was the ruler of the Burgundian Netherlands and titular Duke of Burgundy.\n\nPhilip the Handsome was so called because of his fair hair and attractive grey-blue eyes. He was tall, handsome, and fair, but his character remains mysterious.\n\nDespite his young age, Philip quickly proved himself an effective ruler beloved by his people in the Low Countries, pursuing policies that favored peace and economic development, while maintaining a steady course of government building.\n\nHis reign was one of the most momentous in medieval history. This was because he successfully challenged the traditional power of the papacy in France. It thereby strengthened the monarchy.\n\n7. King Absalom\n\nKing Absalom\u2019s story is recorded in the Bible in the book of 2 Samuel.\n\nIt states that no man in all of Israel was as handsome and highly praised as Absalom. From the sole of his foot to the top of his head, he did not have a single flaw.\n\nIn the manner in which the verse above depicts Absalom, we can identify that the character \u201cAbsalom\u201d, was a good-looking man. Describing a man as not having a single flaw perhaps speaks of his skin tone and texture and the absence of any form of defects. We are left to picture a tall man with great skin, and a handsome face.\n\n8. Saul\n\nKing Saul\u2019s story is documented in the Bible in the book of Samuel.\n\nThe Israelites chose him to be king because there was no one among the Israelis as handsome as he. He was a head taller than any of the other people. He is described as handsome and he passed the gene down to his son, Jonathan.\n\nSaul wasn\u2019t just handsome; he was a man with qualities that defined a strong man. He was fast, and \u201cmore valiant than lions\u201d.\n\nSaul and Jonathan were loved and handsome in life, and death and were not separated.\n\n9. King David\n\nKing David\u2019s story is documented in the Bible in the book of Psalms.\n\nIt states that he was the most handsome of men; grace flows from your lips.\n\nDavid is described to be handsome in the book of Psalms and the book of Samuel too. It\u2019s safe to say that David probably has more verses describing him to be handsome than any other biblical character.\n\nThe book of 1 Samuel says that the Lord sent Samuel to anoint him as he was the one. it goes ahead to say that he had beautiful eyes and a healthy, handsome appearance.\n\n10. Solomon\n\nKing Solomon is also a biblical king. His tales are found in the book of Solomon.\n\nMany verses in the book are messages to him from his lovers. They describe him as handsome and delightful.\n\nIt is one of many calling Solomon a handsome man. After all, his father, David is also depicted by the Bible to be very handsome.\n\nKing Solomon was popular with the ladies. He had 700 wives and 300 concubines! Only the most handsome man would pull this out! Considering Solomon\u2019s adventures with women, his status as a handsome man fits perfectly into the interpretation puzzle."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Philip-III-duke-of-Burgundy", "page_content": "Philip III, byname Philip the Good or French Philippe Le Bon, (born July 31, 1396, Dijon, Burgundy [now in France]\u2014died June 15, 1467, Bruges [now Brugge, Belgium]), the most important of the Valois dukes of Burgundy (reigned 1419\u201367) and the true founder of the Burgundian state that rivaled France in the 15th century.\n\nPhilip was the son of John the Fearless and Margaret of Bavaria. When he became duke of Burgundy at the age of 23, his first aim was to extricate himself as expeditiously as possible from the French affairs in which his father, Duke John, had been embroiled and that had led to his assassination in 1419. Holding the dauphin Charles (later Charles VII of France) answerable for his father\u2019s murder, Philip signed the Treaty of Troyes with King Henry V of England in 1420, a treaty in which the queen of France, Isabella of Bavaria, conferred succession to the French crown on Henry and partitioned France among England, Burgundy, and her disinherited son, the dauphin Charles.\n\nPhilip paid little attention to potential conquests in France and preferred to remain uncommitted there. He maintained his alliance with England\u2014apart from a break in 1435\u201339, when he tried but failed to conquer Calais\u2014but seldom gave England serious help against France. On the other hand, especially after 1435, when he acknowledged Charles as king of France and accepted his disavowal of the murder of John the Fearless, he did his best to be on reasonably good terms with the king of France. His real interests lay not in France but in the development of his own territories.\n\nBehind an impressive, if bizarre, facade of courtly splendour and chivalrous festivity, Duke Philip the Good was an aggressive opportunist who, especially in the first half of his ducal reign, concentrated on the task of attacking and swallowing up his smaller neighbours. Namur was purchased in 1421; Hainaut fell to Burgundian arms in 1427; the rich duchy of Brabant was taken over in 1430; and the combined counties of Holland and Zeeland were conquered in a long series of personally led and bitterly contested campaigns between 1424 and 1433. The crowning achievement of Philip\u2019s policy of territorial expansion was his conquest of the duchy of Luxembourg in 1443.\n\nIt was under Philip that the richness and extravagance of court life in the Middle Ages reached its apogee. Philip, whose personal tastes in clothes were relatively simple, loved to surround himself with all the pomp and pageantry that the age could command. In 1430 he founded a new order of chivalry, a Burgundian version of the British Order of the Garter, called the Toison d\u2019Or, or Golden Fleece, membership of which was limited to 24 noblemen of proven valour and wide renown. Court was held at Brussels or Bruges, in Brabant and Flanders, respectively; or at Hesdin or Lille, in northeastern France; or at some other centre.\n\nThe best artists of the day were employed by Philip to paint his banners and pennons, to decorate his palaces and carriages, and to illuminate what was probably the finest collection of picture books ever put together. The artist Jan van Eyck accompanied a ducal embassy to Portugal to paint the king\u2019s daughter Isabella, so that Philip could see her likeness before committing himself to marrying her. Sculptors worked on tombs at Philip\u2019s command, and exquisite tapestries were embroidered under his personal supervision. A host of musicians, jewelers, goldsmiths, and other craftsmen and artists were employed at his court. The bawdy stories exchanged by Philip and his courtiers after dinner were collected into Les Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles, or \u201cThe Hundred New Short Stories.\u201d\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Other entertainment was held from time to time in the form of tournaments or passages of arms, and Duke Philip\u2019s courtiers roamed about Europe issuing challenges and doing battle with their colleagues from other lands.\n\nDuke Philip was tall, handsome, and bony in figure; his face was long and lean, with a high forehead, prominent nose, and bushy eyebrows. Excellent in health, he enjoyed hunting, tennis, archery, and jousting in his youth, but he turned in his later years to making clogs, repairing broken glasses, and soldering broken knives. His many natural children caused the bishop of Tournai (himself born to unmarried parents) to criticize him for what the ecclesiastic called \u201cthe weakness of the flesh.\u201d Some were brought up at court; others went into the church. His mistresses were kept out of affairs of state, and it was mere geographic convenience and economy that caused him to maintain several at once in the different towns where he held court. Self-assured and flamboyant almost to the end, he died, possibly of pneumonia, at Bruges in 1467."}, {"url": "https://metaunfolded.com/philip-i-of-castile/", "page_content": "Philip I was the first King of Castile from the House of Habsburg. He was also known as Philip the Handsome. He was born to Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I and Mary, the Duchess of Burgundy, who was his first wife. The second one ruled over a lot of the Duchy of Burgundy and the Low Countries. After Mary died, Philip I took over her lands and put them under the care of his father. His father married him to Joanna of Castile, the second daughter of Ferdinand II, the ruler of Aragon, and Isabella I, the ruler of Castile. After Isabella died, Joanna took over as queen. But her mental incapacity and Ferdinand II\u2019s attempts to take over the regency of Castile led the nobles to call Philip I to Spain and make him King of Castile by right of inheritance in 1506. But he died after a few months, which made people wonder if Ferdinand had done something to kill him. As long as his father was still alive, he couldn\u2019t take over his father\u2019s power and become Holy Roman Emperor. Later, his son Charles ruled the land that used to be the Duchy of Burgundy, the Holy Roman Empire as Charles V, and Spain as Charles I. Philip I is still seen as the ancestor of all Spanish monarchs who came after him. He is also seen as a key figure in expanding the territories of the House of Habsburg.\n\nPhilip of Castile\u2019s Birth\n\nPhilip, I was born in Bruges, Flanders, Burgundian Netherlands, on July 22, 1478. His parents were the future Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I and his first wife, Mary, Duchess of Burgundy.\n\nWhen he was born, his grandfather, Frederick III, was running the empire. He was named after Philip the Good, who was the grandfather of his mother.\n\nBurgundian Inheritance\n\nMary, his mother, was the ruler of many parts of the Duchy of Burgundy and the Low Countries. She died when he was only four years old, on March 27, 1482. Because of this, he got all of her possessions and put them under the care of his father. After that, there was a rough time with a lot of fighting, mostly between those who supported Maximilian I and the big towns of Flanders.\n\nFrom 1482\u2013to 1492, the cities of Flanders rebelled twice against Maximilian I to support their claims for more power, which they had taken from Mary by signing the \u201cGreat Privilege\u201d document on February 11, 1477. During this time, Philip I was held prisoner in Bruges for a short time as part of the revolt.\n\nBut the revolts didn\u2019t work, and Flemish cities were forced to accept Maximilian I as regent. The \u201cTreaty of Senlis,\u201d which was about the Burgundian succession, was a deal between the two sides. It was signed by King Charles VIII of France and Emperor Maximilian I in May 1493 at Senlis, Oise. Philip, I will become a prince in the next year, it was decided.\n\nBy the Treaty of Senlis, Maximilian I gave up his role as regent in 1494, and Philip I, who was 16 at the time, took over the Burgundian lands. But in reality, the power was used by a council of important Burgundian people.\n\nHaving a deal with Spain\n\nThe policies of King Louis XI of France and the successful use of royal power against the \u201cLeague of the Public Weal,\u201d an alliance of feudal nobles formed in 1465 to challenge the King\u2019s centralized authority, helped France gain a lot of power.\n\nIn order to stop France from becoming more powerful, the Habsburgs and the Trast\u00e1mara joined together as families. So, on October 20, 1496, in Lier, Belgium, Philip I married Joanna because of Maximilian I. She was King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile\u2019s third child and second daughter.\n\nHis sister Margaret was also married off to John, Prince of Asturias, the only son of Ferdinand II and Isabella I. At the time, John was the most likely heir to the thrones of Aragon and Castile. His sisters Isabella, who was married to Manuel I of Portugal, and Joanna were second and third in line.\n\nCrown of Castile to Joanna\n\nJohn, the likely next king of Castile and Aragon, died on October 4, 1497. His wife Margaret gave birth to a stillborn girl on December 8 of that year. In 1498, when she was giving birth to Miguel da Paz, his older sister Isabella died.\n\nSo, Miguel da Paz inherited the kingdoms of Aragon, Castile, and Le\u00f3n from his mother. He also inherited the kingdom of Portugal from his father. But on July 19, 1500, the Portuguese royal baby died, and Joanna became the heir to the united crowns of Castile and Aragon.\n\nEven though the Cortes of Aragon did not recognize Joanna as the likely heir to the crown of Aragon, the Kingdom of Castile did. With the Spanish throne going to his wife, Philip I and his wife Joanna called themselves \u201cPrinces of Castile.\u201d King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella I thought this was disrespectful to their dead son.\n\nBut it eventually became a problem that Joanna was thought to be mentally unfit, which could have led to Philip I and his Burgundian group taking over power in Castile. In 1502, the couple and a group of people from Burgundy went to Spain to get fealty from the Cortes of Castile.\n\nPhilip I and most of his Burgundian group went back to the Low Countries the next year. He left Joanna, who was pregnant, in Madrid, where she had her fourth child, Ferdinand I, on March 10, 1503. Ferdinand, I later became Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia and Hungary.\n\nEven though Joanna loved her husband very much, the couple was thought to have had a bad marriage due to his infidelity and political instability.\n\nPhilip I had tried more than once to take Joanna\u2019s legal birthright of power. He even tried to force her and lock her up. Reports of Joanna acting depressed or neurotic during this time helped spread rumors that she was crazy. Before her mother died in 1504, the couple had already started living apart.\n\nMany historians today believe that Joanna was just clinically depressed, which most people thought made her crazy.\n\nAs the King of Castile\n\nOn November 26, 1504, Queen Isabella I died. When she did, Joanna took over as Queen of Castile. Even though Ferdinand II was no longer the king of Castile, Isabella I\u2019s will said that he could rule if Joanna wasn\u2019t around or if she didn\u2019t want to rule herself until her heir was 20 years old.\n\nFerdinand II wanted to stay in charge of Castile forever, but the nobles of Castile didn\u2019t like that idea. They forced him to step down and called Philip I to Spain to make him King.\n\nPhilip I and Joanna were on their way to Spain in January 1506 to claim the Castilian inheritance and answer the call of the Castilian nobility. On the way, they ran into a storm that forced them to stop on the shore near Melcombe Regis.\n\nThe couple had to stay as Henry VII of England\u2019s guests, but in reality, they were held as hostages until Philip I and Henry VII signed the Intercursus Malus treaty, which was meant to replace the Intercursus Magnus treaty of February 1496.\n\nThe English had too much luck with Intercursus Malus. It included a trade deal that let English merchants bring cloth into the Low Countries without paying duty. The treaty also had a clause that said rebels like Edmund de la Pole, who had been exiled and was living as Philip I\u2019s guest in the Low Countries, had to be sent back. After Philip I gave Edmund to them, he and his wife were free to go.\n\nPhilip I and Joanna, along with a group of German mercenaries, arrived in Corunna on April 28, 1506. Philip I and Ferdinand II tried to settle things at Remesal and Renedo with the help of Cardinal Cisneros. But this only led to bad fights in the family, with Ferdinand II promising to protect his daughter\u2019s interests and accusing Philip I of locking her up.\n\nThen, on June 27, 1506, Ferdinand II and Philip I signed the Treaty of Villaf\u00e1fila. Under this agreement, Ferdinand II gave all of his power to Philip I and moved to Aragon, while Philip I was named King of Castile by the Cortes of Valladolid.\n\nHis Sudden Death\n\nPhilip, I died of typhoid fever in Burgos on September 25, 1506. Many people thought that Ferdinand II killed him with poison because he died so quickly. Catherine, who would be their sixth child, was in Joanna\u2019s womb at the time.\n\nHe is buried at the Royal Chapel of Granada, which is also the final resting place of Joanna, Ferdinand II, and Isabella I.\n\nKids Who Are With Joanna\n\nHe had six children with Joanna. Their names were Eleanor (1498\u20131558), Charles V (1500\u20131558), who was Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain, Isabella (1501\u20131526), Ferdinand I (1503\u20131564), who was Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia and Hungary, Mary (1505\u20131558), and Catherine (1507\u20131578).\n\nEstimated Net worth\n\nUnknown."}, {"url": "https://olivialongueville.com/2020/07/29/king-philippe-i-of-the-franks-known-as-the-amorous/", "page_content": "King Philippe I of the Franks, born on the 23rd of May 1052, died on the 29th of July 1108. He was the eldest son of King Henry I and his second wife, Anne of Kiev. At the time, the name \u2018Philippe\u2019, which Anne gave him, was unusual for Europe, but it would quickly become popular for future monarchs and in France. Philippe ascended to the throne at the age of 7, and until he turned 14, his mother, Anne, acted as regent with Baldwin V of Flanders being her co-regent.\n\nPhilippe was crowned at Reims on the 23rd of May 1059, several months before his father\u2019s death, becoming a sole King of the Franks soon after this event. Back then, rulers of France didn\u2019t call themselves Kings of France \u2013 his descendant, Philippe II Augustus, would be the first monarch to style himself as King of France. His mother, Anne of Kiev, was a daughter of Yaroslav the Wise, Grand Prince of Kiev and Prince of Novgorod, and his second wife, Ingegerd of Sweden. The capable and intelligent Anne was the first female regent of France for her son.\n\nPhilippe\u2019s sole reign lasted for 48 years, which is extraordinarily long for the time. During his reign, he worked hard to strength the royal demesne (French: domaine royal), and the monarchy began its gradual recovery from the lows it reached during his father\u2019s tumultuous reign. Over the course of time, Philippe managed to add the Vexin and Bourges to the royal demesne, and he also increased the income of the royal treasury. He dedicated a significant part of his life, just as his father\u2019s had done, to dealing with and subduing his ambitious vassals. In 1077, Philippe made peace with William the Conqueror, who gave up attempting the conquest of Brittany.\n\nHe actively used a policy of devious alliances aimed at preventing the emergence of a new powerful rival in Normandy. Acting in this manner, Philippe at first supported Robert II Curthose, while before he had been allied with Robert\u2019s brother, King William II of England, who had been killed by his foes by an arrow through the lung in the New Forest, probably near Brockenhurst. Both Robert II Curthose and William II of England were sons of the illustrious William the Conqueror, who both lost their power in England to their younger cunning and intelligent brother \u2013 King Henry I of England, whom later Philippe began supporting as well.\n\nPhilippe gained the nickname \u2018Amorous\u2019 largely because of his marital problems. His first wife was Bertha of Holland, daughter of Floris I, Count of Holland, and Gertrude of Saxony. Their union took place in 1072 and produced several children, including the necessary heir \u2013 the future King Louis VI the Fat or the Fighter. However, Philippe fell in love with a wife of his vassal \u2013 Bertrade de Montfort, the wife of Count Fulk IV of Anjou. Reciprocating his feelings, in 1092 Bertrade abandoned her husband to live with Philippe, who married her quietly, despite the fact that their spouses were alive.\n\nBertha was repudiated because, as Philippe said, she was too fat, so perhaps he just didn\u2019t like her body after her several pregnancies, Humiliated by this repudiation, withdrew to the fortress of Montreuil-sur-Mer, which was part of her dower land. For his bigamist marriage to Bertrade, Philippe was excommunicated by Pope Urban II, but he promised to return to his first wife. Yet, Philippe continued living with Bertrade de Montfort, with whom he had three children \u2013 Philippe, Count of Mantes, Fleury, Seigneur of Nangis, and Cecile. Bertrade wanted one of her sons to succeed Philippe, and there were rumors that she tried to poison Prince Louis, son of Berthe, but it cannot be proved. Ironically, neither of her sons would not have a long life. Philippe\u2019s excommunication was later several times lifted, but given his continuous bigamy, it was reinstated, and only after Bertha had passed away in 1094, it was finally lifted.\n\nWhen knights began to gather for the First Crusade, Philippe didn\u2019t participate due to his conflict with the Vatican. His younger brother, Count Hugh de Vermandois, answered the call to arms and is now known primary for his role in the first Christian expedition to the Holy Land. The Crusade attracted a number of Philippe\u2019s vassals, in addition to his brother, and later it became beneficial for the French Crown because many of their vassals encountered financial troubles after their return home and desperately needed royal favor and monies.\n\nSelf-indulgent and lover of pleasures, Philippe I the Amorous gained a lot of weight in his fifties, although he had been handsome and fit in youth. Due to his obesity, he would probably have been unable to take part in any battle. Prince Louis, son of Bertha, practically took controlled of the kingdom in about 1100, but he was not crowned until his father\u2019s death in 1108. Much more energetic despite his corpulence, Louis enthusiastically engaged in state affairs and effectively dealt with robber barons, his purpose being to strength the power of the crown. Soon Bertrade de Montfort took the veil at Fontevraud Abbey, where she died in 1117 at the age of 46-47.\n\nAccording to Abbot Suger, Philippe I\u2019s life and mental state later in life could be described like this:\n\n\u201c\u2026 King Philippe daily grew feebler. For after he had abducted the Countess of Anjou, he could achieve nothing worthy of the royal dignity; consumed by desire for the lady he had seized, he gave himself up entirely to the satisfaction of his passion. So he lost interest in the affairs of state and, relaxing too much, took no care for his body, well-made and handsome though it was. The only thing that maintained the strength of the state was the fear and love felt for his son and successor. When he was almost sixty, he ceased to be king, breathing his last breath at the castle of Melun-sur-Seine, in the presence of the [future king] Louis\u2026 They carried the body in a great procession to the noble monastery of St-Beno\u00eet-sur-Loire, where King Philip wished to be buried; there are those who say they heard from his own mouth that he deliberately chose not to be buried among his royal ancestors in the church of St. Denis because he had not treated that church as well as they had, and because among those of so many noble kings, his own tomb would not have counted for much.\u201d\n\nPhilippe breathed his last at the castle of Melun-sur-Seine in the presence of Louis. His body was carried in a grand procession to the monastery of St-Beno\u00eet-sur-Loire, where the deceased man wished to be buried instead of being laid to eternal rest in the royal necropolis at the Basilica of Saint-Denis together with his ancestors. According to some contemporary sources, Philippe explained that there were so many nobles tombs in the basilica that his own tomb would have become meaningless among those of his noble forefathers. Philippe I is one of the few, if not the only one, French monarchs who was not buried at Saint-Denis.\n\nAll images are in the public domain.\n\nText \u00a9 2020 Olivia Longueville"}, {"url": "https://study.com/academy/lesson/henry-ii-of-england-and-phillip-augustus-of-france.html", "page_content": "Video Transcript\n\nEngland and France\n\nThroughout history, England and France have gone head to head in a fight for land and power. Ironically, these two countries have always been closely linked through blood, marriage, and some downright chaos. Today, we are going to explore some of these monarchs by studying the famous Angevin kings of England's Plantagenet dynasty and their dealings with France's King Philip Augustus.\n\nLet's start with England; however, by doing so, we'll also be starting with France. Don't worry, I'll explain. Your job is just to keep in mind that England and France have a very intertwined history.\n\nHenry II\n\nHenry II is the first Angevin king and also the first king of England's Plantagenet dynasty. We get the term Angevin from the fact that he came from a ruling family of Anjou, France. Yes, I did say France, not England. The term Plantagenet comes from the yellow flower his family held as its emblem.\n\nKnown to history as one of England's strongest kings, Henry II ruled from 1154 CE to 1189 CE. Not only did this powerhouse rule England, he married the ex-wife of the king of France. Her name was Eleanor of Aquitaine, and, when they married, Henry II neatly folded her French lands under his royal control. Not only did Henry II rule England, he also controlled Wales, Anjou, Normandy, and Gascony - basically a massive part of France. As I said, England and France have been seriously intertwined!\n\nIronically, Henry II ruled a huge amount of Europe's lands, but he couldn't keep his sons under control. They spent much of their time fighting over who got to govern what portion of their father's land, and even allying with the royal house of France to try to rob their father of his holdings. When Henry II finally died in 1189, his son Richard, known as the 'Lionheart,' became King Richard I.\n\nRichard I\n\nAlthough Richard's rule spanned over a decade, he spent very little time in England. Instead, he occupied himself with the Crusades, or Europe's attempt to free the Holy Lands from Moslem control. When not off crusading, or being held prisoner, he was often found in, yes, you guessed it, France. In fact, some sources even go as far as to say that he, the king of England, spoke very little English.\n\nKing John\n\nSince Richard died without an heir, his brother John took the throne in the year 1199. Most of us know John, without even knowing we know him. How? Well, he's the ruthless prince depicted in the famous tales of Robin Hood. Besides being Robin Hood's bad guy, John is most famous for the 1215 signing of the Magna Carta. In this \u00fcber famous document, which the nobles of England pretty much forced King John to sign, the first steps toward limiting the power of England's kings and protecting the rights of the nobility were taken.\n\nNot only did King John begin giving away some of the power of the English monarchy, his reign signaled the end of the reign of Angevin kings. Perhaps even more devastating to England's future monarchies, as king, he also lost most of England's French holdings - including all of Normandy - to the French King Philip II.\n\nPhilip Augustus\n\nThis is a great place to turn our attention fully to France and its King Philip II, the very guy who robbed the Plantagenets of much of their lands."}]}
