She started studying the Swazi culture and *ociating with the Swaziland's royal family after she was awarded with a grant by the International African Ins*ute of London. She studied and illustrated Swazi traditions embodied in the political vision of King Sobhuza II, who later became a close friend. King Sobhuza II personally awarded Kuper with Swazi citizenship in 1970.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn to Lithuanian Jewish and Austrian Jewish parents in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia, Kuper moved to South Africa after the death of her father. She studied at the University of the Wi*ersrand and, afterwards, at the London School of Economics under Malinowski.\n\nDoctoral fieldwork and anthropological career\n\nIn 1934, Kuper won a fellowship from the International African Ins*ute to study in Swaziland. In July of that year, while at an education conference in Johannesburg, she met Sobhuza II, paramount chief and later king of Swaziland. With *istance from Sobhuza and Malinowski, Kuper moved to the royal village of Lobamba and was introduced to Sobhuza's mother, the queen mother Lomawa. Here Kuper learned siSwati and pursued her fieldwork. This phase of Kuper's researches into Swazi culture culminated in the two-part dissertation, An African Aristocracy: Rank among the Swazi (1947) and The Uniform of Colour: a Study of White\u2013Black Relationships in Swaziland (1947).\n\nIn the early 1950s, Kuper moved to Durban. During that decade, she focused her studies on the Indian community in the Natal region, as summarised in Indian People in Natal (1960). In 1953, Kuper received a senior lectureship at the University of Natal in Durban. In addition to her academic work, together with her husband, Leo Kuper, she helped to found the Liberal Party in Natal\n\nIn 1961 the Kupers moved to Los Angeles, to escape the har*ment of liberals that was increasingly prevalent in apartheid South Africa, and to enable Leo to accept a professorship in sociology at UCLA. In 1963 Kuper published The Swazi: a South African Kingdom and was herself appointed professor of anthropology at UCLA. Kuper was a popular teacher, and In 1969 won a Guggenheim fellowship.\n\nIn 1978, Kuper published an extensive, official biography of Sobhuza II, King Sobhuza II, Ngwenyama and King of Swaziland.\n\nAwards\n\nPersonal life\n\nKuper married Leo Kuper in 1936.

Though the huge majority were African, whites owned much of the land. The king, \"The Lion\" and queen mother, \"The Lady Elephant\" ruled, but more in name than in fact. Hilda Kuper lived and studied there from 1934 to 1945, with a few more visits in the late 1950s. So, in short, this study published in 1964 is quite outdated. It is part of the vast Holt, Rinehart and Winston series of anthropological studies by (usually) well-known scholars. Kuper is no exception. This is a very short, succinct summary of many aspects of Swazi culture. It shows considerable thought and expertise though no voice is given to the Swazi themselves, as was usual in those days. It follows a format common to the whole series. It does include a fair bit of history, which was not always the case in the anthropology of those times. The study contains material on political structure, kinship and family, religion, work and economic relations, education, and the effects of Christianity and western culture in general. The Swazi did not suffer the hammerings of fortune which befell the Zulu, Xhosa, and others, managing to maintain a semblance of their freedom under their traditional rulers. Many Swazi men migrated to work in the mines and fields of South Africa, still the case. Today, the population numbers more like 1.38 million, but due to the ravages of AIDS, at the highest rate in the world (26% of population with HIV), the life expectancy of Swazilanders is one of the lowest in the world. They have experienced trouble balancing traditional ways and a monarchy with the winds of change that blow ever stronger. Problems of land tenure, evident from Kuper's book, still have not been solved. If you are curious about Swazi tradition and how it looked in an earlier time, you could give this book a shot. It could be useful for comparative studies in culture for first year anthropology students, but it is now social history rather than a contemporary work. That's why I have given it only three stars, though the work is good."}, {"url": "https://abbysgondek.com/portfolio/fatima-meer-and-hilda-kuper-jewish-muslim-collaborations-in-research-on-indian-south-africans/", "page_content": "Dr. Abby Gondek, Morgenthau Scholar-in-Residence, FDR Library, Hyde Park, NY\n\nPhD Global and Socio-cultural Studies, Florida International University\n\nMA African and African Diaspora Studies, FIU\n\nMA Women\u2019s Studies, SDSU\n\nFor the roundtable: The politics of knowledge in jewish women\u2019s activism @ NWSA 2019\n\nNovember 14, 2019 in San Francisco, CA\n\nHilda Kuper with Fatima Meer and Gisele Maquet, in front of Hilda\u2019s home on Warner Ave. in Los Angeles, 1984/5.

Gisele Maquet\u2019s husband, Jacques Maquet, was an anthropologist at UCLA (with Hilda).\n\nAbstract\n\nFatima Meer (1928-2010), a feminist sociologist of Indian Muslim (on her paternal side) and Jewish descent (on her maternal grandfather\u2019s side) in South Africa, collaborated with Hilda Kuper (1911-1992), a Jewish anthropologist (born in Rhodesia), producing \u201cThe Indian Elites in Natal, South Africa\u201d (1956). Meer conducted fieldwork and influenced Kuper\u2019s Indian People in Natal (1960) as well as Kuper\u2019s play The Decision (1957). One of the themes in Meer\u2019s work was black and Indian women\u2019s experiences of racism and sexism and the use of suicide as a mode of resistance within apartheid South Africa (1976). This presentation explores how Kuper and Meer influenced each other\u2019s writings and anti-apartheid activism.\n\nOrganization\n\nI begin with an explanation of Hilda Kuper & Fatima Meer and then move into their collaboration, focusing on the publications they wrote together or that were thematically connected. In part 3, I detail the timeline of their relationship. In the last section, I describe Hilda\u2019s play The Decision, influenced by her research with Fatima Meer and discuss their overlapping themes such as suicide and different types of elites within the Indian community in South Africa.\n\nPart 1: Intro to Hilda Kuper & Fatima Meer\n\nHilda Kuper was born in 1911 in Bulawayo, Rhodesia, grew up in Johannesburg, South Africa and received her anthropological training with Winifred Hoernl\u00e9 at the University of Witwatersrand and Bronislaw Malinowski at the London School of Economics. Kuper\u2019s first fieldwork involved studying the impact of liquor laws on black women in Johannesburg. Later her research sites expanded to Swaziland and Indian communities in Durban, Natal, South Africa, where she formed a life-long friendship and research partnership with sociologist, Fatima Meer, who was of South African, Indian, Muslim and Jewish descent. Their collaboration will be the focus of this presentation.\n\nHilda Kuper at her home in Los Angeles, 1974, at a party organized for her students, photograph by Dawn Chatty\n\nThrough Hilda\u2019s marriage to Leo Kuper she became involved in non-violent apartheid protests as one of the founders of the Liberal Party and was forced to leave South Africa; she eventually became a Professor of Anthropology at UCLA.\n\nHilda Kuper (center) with Leo Kuper, her husband (behind), and Max Gluckman, her old friend and anthropology colleague from the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, (at the right) at Watts Towers, Los Angeles. Hilda Kuper Papers, UCLA Special Collections, Box 45, Folder 20. For more information on the connection between Max Gluckman and Hilda Kuper see Andrew Bank, p. 193, n. 17\n\nIn her theorizing about black women, Hilda took a \u201cSwazi point of view,\u201d arguing that Westernization weakened women\u2019s position. She portrayed Swazi women and Indian South African women as the victims of colonization as well as patriarchal indigenous systems.\n\nHilda\u2019s initial interests in law, acting, languages and history, morphed into her career as a legal and political anthropologist, novelist and playwright. Durkheim and French sociology were also highly influential, as both Hilda and her research collaborator, Fatima Meer, wrote about suicide and women of color in Southern Africa.\n\nHilda\u2019s graduate student at UCLA, David Kuby, said the following of her Jewish identity:\n\n\u201cJewish, British and African are quite a combination of values not easily put into one neat box and there was a comfortable, very human dimension of Hilda that was humble and nonjudgmental that made one feel very accepted in our imperfections despite Hilda\u2019s high standards for scholarship and social justice work.\u201d -David Kuby, December 29, 2016, e-mail correspondence\n\nThe information in this section comes from a brief bio I wrote of Hilda, based on my dissertation. You can find the full bio I wrote here on my academia.edu page and the excerpt from it was published at Bustle.com.\n\nFatima Meer and Nelson Mandela at her home in 1995, image by Richard Shorey\n\n\u201cMeer\u2019s Gujrati grandfather, Ismail, had arrived in South Africa as a trader from Surat on the east coast of India in the 1880s. Her father, Moosa Meer, was the editor of Indian Views, a weekly in Urdu and English. Her mother, Ameena, was a white woman [whose father was Jewish] originally called Rachel. The Meer household was a mixture of Muslim Gujarati traditions and liberal political activism; Fatima combined the two.\u201d\n\nWajid, Arjumand. 2010. \u201cFatima Meer: Academic and Activist.\u201d The Hindu, March 30, 2010.\n\n\u201cAt a time when most Indian girls were helping their mothers in the kitchen making samosas, this young woman was leading protest marches and challenging the most oppressive system in the world.\u201d Winnie Mandela\n\nFrom the Wajid obituary of Fatima Meer, March 30, 2010.\n\nAn article about Fatima\u2019s artwork that was created while she was in the Women\u2019s Gaol in Johannesburg has just come out this October in the New Yorker magazine. I visited the Gaol in March 2017, while in Johannesburg for my dissertation research. You can also learn about Fatima\u2019s art work during her imprisonment here.\n\n\u201cMorning in the Prison Yard\u201d by Fatima Meer, a photograph I took of her painting, one of many displayed on this mesh-like canvas throughout the women\u2019s gaol. Photo by Abby Gondek, March 26, 2017\n\nPhotograph of myself taking a photo of the display for the wash-house courtyard. This was one of the most traumatic areas in the prison because I learned that female prisoners had to wash all of the clothing, including the male prisoners\u2019 pants, which were oftentimes stained with blood (likely from being raped or lashed). These are images from the Women\u2019s Gaol in downtown Johannesburg, where Fatima Meer was detained (in 1976) and painted scenes from her daily life in the prison. The painting on the left contains the following explanation written by Meer: \u201cThe two prisoners in the foreground are carrying our bath water from the kitchen. The other prisoner brings our flask of boiling water. The awaiting trial prisoners line up for breakfast on the left. The \u2018convicted\u2019 line up on the right. The three prisoners facing the wall are waiting for sanitary pads. They will get three each for the day.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026in 1976, [Fatima Meer] was held for six months, without trial, under the apartheid government\u2019s Terrorism Act. Her crime was an attempt to organize a mass rally with the activist Steve Biko, after police shot at and killed student protesters in the township of Soweto.\u201d Anakwa Dwamena, October 23, 2019, The New Yorker\n\nPart 2: Writing collaboration\n\nHilda collaborated with Fatima Meer on a project about Indian South Africans in Durban, Natal (Kuper and Meer 1956).\n\nThis network visualization developed using nodegoat, a project of Lab1100, displays the connections between the publications of Hilda Kuper and Fatima Meer.\n\nThis network visualization displays the publications written by Hilda Kuper and Fatima Meer. \u201cIndian Elites in Natal\u201d (1956), co-authored by Kuper and Meer, shared a thematic focus on Indian South Africans and protest with Hilda\u2019s book Indian People in Natal (1960), for which Fatima Meer acted as a research assistant. \u201cIndian Elites\u201d also shared an emphasis on Indian ethnic groups, such as Tamil and Hindustani, with Hilda\u2019s play The Decision (1957). All three of these works, contrasted the \u201cAfrican\u201d (meaning black) and Indian South African populations. Note the connection between Violaine Junod\u2019s \u201cReport on a Study of the Coloured \u2018Social Elite\u2019 in London\u201d (1952) and Hilda Kuper and Fatima Meer\u2019s \u201cIndian Elites in Natal\u201d (1956). Violaine Junod was close to both Hilda Kuper and Fatima Meer (Junod n.d.). Fatima Meer described the Kupers and Violaine Junod as her \u201cmost constant friends\u201d during the Treason Trials in 1956 (Meer 2017, 169).\n\nJunod, Violaine. n.d. \u201cViolaine Junod Letters to Hilda Kuper, Correspondence from 1970s-80s.\u201d Box 52.

Cape Town: Kwela Books.\n\nPart 3: Hilda and Fatima\u2019s relationship\n\nHilda met Fatima Meer in 1952 when Hilda moved to Durban, where her husband Leo Kuper, received a Sociology chair position at the University of Natal. It was Leo, the new head of the department, who allowed Fatima to rewrite her sociology honors exam (after she had been failed by a racist Afrikaner Nationalist lecturer); she passed with \u201cflying colours\u201d (Meer 2017, 150-151).\n\nFatima was Hilda\u2019s research assistant for Kuper\u2019s book Indian People in Natal (Kuper 1960, x). The Institute of Community and Family Health in the Newlands neighborhood in Durban funded this research (Meer 2017, 155). Fatima\u2019s fieldwork notebooks in the Hilda Kuper Papers, elaborate the effect of Indian immigration to South Africa upon caste affiliation, marriage traditions, legally required medical care, and labor strikes. Meer also tracked and summarized the ship logs by sex, age, caste, religion, village, and marriage status (Kuper et al. 1953). In her autobiography, Fatima refers to \u201cfilling in dozens of these reporter\u2019s notebooks\u201d but unfortunately, she was dismissed after only a year from this position at the Institute of Community and Family Health because of her anti-apartheid activism and radicalism; Hilda and Fatima were both shocked (2017, 158). Hilda clearly used Fatima\u2019s notes in Indian People in Natal in Chapter 1 regarding migration and Chapter 2 on changes in caste affiliation post-migration.\n\nKuper, Hilda, Fatima Meer, R. Singh. 1953. \u201cHilda Kuper Papers, Box 14 (Fatima Meer and R. Singh Fieldnotes).\u201d Los Angeles: UCLA Special Collections.\n\nHilda Kuper\u2019s transnational migrations & fieldwork, a geographical visualization, developed using nodegoat, a project of Lab1100\n\nHilda conducted fieldwork in Durban in three Indian suburbs from 1953-1957 with funding from the Council for Social and Industrial Research. She worked with Indian health educators who were trained by the Institute of Community and Family Health including four women Miss N. Perumal, Mrs. Padmini Govindoo, Sally Naidoo and Violet Padayachee. In addition to Fatima Meer, Mrs. Radhi Singh assisted Hilda (Bank 2016, 218-221; Kuper 1960, x).\n\nBank, Andrew. 2016. Pioneers of the Field: South Africa\u2019s Women Anthropologists. London, England: Cambridge University Press, International African Institute.\n\nThe Kuper home was a central site for anti-apartheid solidarity across racial lines. On November 9, 1952, Leo collaborated with the joint ANC-Indian Congress political rally at Red Square in Durban; he wrote about his experiences in Passive Resistance in South Africa (1955). Leo was arrested in 1956 with Alan Paton and four Indian Congress members for their participation in the \u201cassembly of the Native\u201d in the Gandhi Library Hall in Durban; this is where they launched a defense fund for the 156 Treason Trialists. Hilda was arrested earlier in 1956 with Fatima Meer at a women\u2019s march protesting new laws that extended the pass system to \u201cnon-European\u201d women (Bank 2016, 217\u201318). Also in 1956, the Kupers \u201csolicited a loan\u201d and \u201cstood guarantor\u201d for Fatima and her husband Ismail Meer, so that they could get the capital to build their house, since non-whites could not get loans at that time (Meer 2017, 163).\n\nHilda was \u201ccombative with non-progressive colleagues\u201d and was excluded from a departmental research trip to Swaziland, despite her expertise (Russell 1994, 146). By the late 1950s, the apartheid police increasingly harassed Leo and Hilda, spies attended their lectures, and Leo was threatened with a banning order; eventually Hilda instigated their departure from South Africa (Golomski 2011, 4; Moran 1988, 198).\n\nRussell, Margo. 1994. \u201cOBITUARY: Hilda Kuper, 1911-92.\u201d Africa 64 (1): 145\u201349.\n\nGolomski, Casey. 2011. \u201cHilda Kuper, Anthropology, History.\u201d In University of Swaziland, UNISWA, History Staff Seminar Series, 21.

Urbana: University of Illinois Press.\n\nIn 1970, Hilda wrote to Fatima from Los Angeles to express that she was \u201cso delighted\u201d with Fatima\u2019s book (Portrait of Indian South Africans, 1969) that she and Leo felt Fatima should submit it for a Ph.D.\n\n\u201cThe photographs are fascinating and the text is rich in perception.\u201d Kuper, Hilda. 1970. \u201cHilda Kuper to Fatima Meer and Ismail Meer, March 20, 1970.\u201d Los Angeles, CA: Hilda Kuper Papers, Box 41, Folder 9, UCLA Special Collections, Charles E. Young Research Library.\n\nIn closing, Hilda wrote, \u201cThere is so much to talk about that cannot be expressed in letters. We think of you very often and send you much, much love\u201d (Kuper 1970). In her autobiography, Fatima wrote that Hilda Kuper \u201cconsidered the manuscript so good that she canvassed the head of department to award me a doctorate for it\u201d (Meer 2017, 186).\n\nIn this letter from Hilda to Fatima, Hilda explains that she is about to visit her daughter Mary in Israel, before going to Swaziland (in 1970 Hilda became a Swazi citizen). Hilda complements Fatima on her new book and expresses how much both she and Leo think of Fatima and send much love. Hilda Kuper Papers, Box 41, Folder 9.\n\nPart 4: The Decision\n\nThe Decision (1957) is a tragic play written by Hilda Kuper in which the female lead character is punished through death, for the patriarchal and racist hierarchical structure of her society. In this play, Savitree, a girl from a high caste Hindi speaking family in Durban, in Natal province, South Africa, fell in love with a Tamil Christian boy, Siva, whose family was from Southern India.\n\nThe cover page for the program of Hilda\u2019s 1957 version of The Decision, performed in Durban by medical students at the University of Natal. Sondra Hale personal collection of Hilda Kuper\u2019s creative writing at UCLA, Anthropology Department.\n\nTheir different ethnicities and religions, as well as the fact that Siva was active in the Indian National Congress and the passive resistance movement, marked Siva as \u201cother\u201d and unmarriageable (61). One version of the story closed when Savitree set fire to herself and died because her family forbade her to be with Siva (Kuper 1993, 63).\n\nKuper, Hilda. 1993. A Witch in My Heart: Short Stories and Poems. Edited by Nancy Schmidt. Madison: African Studies Program, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. https://books.google.com/books?id=bh5aAAAAMAAJ&pgis=1.\n\nIn a different version of the play, Savitree sacrificed herself by marrying the man her family decided she should marry (Kuper 1957, 30\u201331).\n\nKuper, Hilda. 1957. \u201cThe Decision: A Contemporary South African Indian Play.\u201d Durban Medical Students Drama Group.

Siva\u2019s friend Rajid Naidoo argued:\n\n\u201cAfrican women are a major force in African politics, but few Indian women are active in political affairs.\u201d Hilda Kuper, 1993\n\nThis implied that the problem was within Indian culture, rather than South African culture as a whole. Siva\u2019s friend Chetty remarked that the women should \u201cfree themselves\u201d rather than waiting for men to do so, upon which Siva discovered that Savitree killed herself, causing the reader to wonder if this was Savitree\u2019s way of \u201cfreeing herself\u201d (Kuper 1993, 63).\n\nIn the 1957 version of the play, Siva\u2019s words close the play:\n\n\u201call I wanted is to be myself and let others be themselves.\u201d Hilda Kuper, 1957\n\nHe contended that Savitree should not have had to sacrifice herself for her family out of the \u201cstrength of her affection for others, for those who had brought her up.\u201d Siva emphasized that her loyalty should not lie with her family alone but with the \u201cfamily of the people of the world\u201d (31).\n\nPerhaps, this was Kuper\u2019s message for unity rather than separation between not only Indian South Africans, but also all South Africans.\n\nIntriguingly, Kuper revealed that she had never published the play because a few Indian couples confronted her after a performance of the play in Durban (by Indian medical students) to inform her they would sue her for writing about their families. Though she did not know these families Hilda\n\n\u201crealized that I had struck a very vulnerable center and Indians were already scapegoated for much of the antagonisms so sadly I put the manuscript aside\u201d but she was revising it for publication in the months before her death (Schmidt 1993, 1, n.5). Schmidt, Nancy J. 1993. \u201cIntroduction.\u201d In A Witch in My Heart: Short Stories and Poems, 1\u20133. Madison: African Studies Program, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.\n\nHilda had written about a case very similar to the one she depicted in her play, in her 1960 book, Indian People in Natal (for which Fatima was a research assistant).\n\n\u201cBy no means unusual is the case of the girl from an orthodox Hindi speaking family who fell in love with a Tamil boy; on discovering this, her parents married her to a man of their own choice. From the beginning the girl was most unhappy with her in-laws, and after one of her frequent visits home she threatened to commit suicide if forced to return to them.\u201d Hilda Kuper, Indian People in Natal, 1960, p. 136\n\nThe Decision echoes some of the findings from a paper about Indian elites in Natal, co-written by Fatima Meer and Hilda Kuper (1956). They described two primary elite groups: the protest and compromise elites.\n\n\u201cThe protest elites, led mainly by intellectuals, identify with Non-Europeans and \u2018oppressed people\u2019 in general; the compromise elites operate as a defensive and exclusive minority\u201d (Kuper and Meer 1956, 145). Kuper, Hilda, and Fatima Meer. 1956. \u201cIndian Elites in Natal, South Africa.\u201d In Social Science Conference, University of Natal, Institute for Social Research, 129\u201345. Durban, Natal, South Africa: University of Natal, Institute for Social Research.\n\nSiva was part of the protest elite, while Savitree\u2019s family represented the compromise elites. Meer and Kuper found that original caste differences between Indian immigrants were fading because of the\n\n\u201cupward mobility of the ex-indentured and the downward pressure from the Europeans, and it appears that the Indian elite of the future will relate more to the Non-Europeans in general than to specific sectional groups.\u201d Kuper and Meer, 1956, p. 145\n\nInterestingly, despite caste distinctions fading, ethnic differences were not, for example between Tamil, Telegu and Hindustani, which are clearly displayed in Hilda\u2019s play since Savitree\u2019s Hindustani family disapproved of Siva because he was Tamil (Kuper 1957; Kuper and Meer 1956, 130).\n\nThis article about Indian elites echoes (thought does not cite) Violaine Junod\u2019s findings from 1952 about protest and compromise leaders among the \u201ccoloured\u201d social elite in Britain. Compromise leaders were the intermediaries between white and black groups, serving as non-political token \u201ccoloured\u201d spokespeople \u201con show\u201d in a \u201czoo situation\u201d within white organizations, which were \u201csympathetic\u201d to \u201ccolonial\u201d issues. Compromise leaders had no direct ties to either colonial nationalist governments or to policy makers and were seen as \u201cacting white\u201d (Banton 1960:151-153). In contrast, protest leaders had close links with colonial nationalist movements, denounced white racism, and held defiant attitudes toward whites supposedly \u201csympathetic\u201d to the cause. Protest leaders were esteemed by \u201ccoloured\u201d community members but disliked by whites (Banton 1960:152).\n\nBanton, Michael. 1960. White and Coloured: The Behavior of British People towards Coloured Immigrants. 2nd ed. New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press.\n\nFatima and Hilda\u2019s findings related to Indians and suicide are interconnected.\n\n\u201cFrom the official figures of \u2018self inflicted deaths\u2019 published for Durban, the number of Indians who took their own lives is roughly the same as of Europeans, both being proportionately higher than the number of Africans and Coloureds; but when to these figures is added deaths in the category of \u2018accidental burning\u2019 \u2013 and burning is the traditional method of committing suicide among Hindus -the Indians outnumber all other racial groups.\u201d Hilda Kuper, 1960, p. 173\n\nThis is one of the tables from Fatima Meer\u2019s 1976 Race and Suicide in South Africa, p. 236. In the earlier period, 1940-60, Indian women had the highest mean suicide rate (16.2) among women and were only second to White males. In the later period, Indian women\u2019s suicide rate increased to 26.4 (yet all groups increased) but this rate was less than that of Coloured women, as well as four other race-gender groups.\n\n\n\nThis table (23b) from Fatima Meer\u2019s 1976 Race and Suicide, emphasizes that the huge majority of Indian women who committed suicide were housewives. This was also true of Coloured women, but the Indian women\u2019s percentage was much higher. Not pictured here is table 23a: of African women who committed suicide, 63.9% were housewives, while 53.7% of white women who committed suicide were housewives. See pages 249-250.\n\nConclusion\n\nFatima Meer and Hilda Kuper collaborated both political and theoretically, through their shared research interests. Hilda supported Fatima unconditionally (both financially and academically) while Fatima conducted foundational fieldwork which informed Hilda\u2019s writing, both academic and creative (through Hilda\u2019s play The Decision). Some of the key themes that they developed were the differences between Black women and Indian women in terms of involvement in South African politics. Fatima investigated the differences in suicide rates by race, gender, class and occupation in South Africa in the mid-20th century. Hilda explored a specific instance of suicide through her fictional play, which was based on the research she had conducted with Fatima. They also shared an interest in different types of elites, protest v. compromise elites, and they investigated how caste differences were becoming less important while ethnic differences were not, as evidenced in Hilda\u2019s play, The Decision.\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/kuper-hilda-b-1911-1992", "page_content": "Citation styles\n\nEncyclopedia.com gives you the ability to cite reference entries and articles according to common styles from the Modern Language Association (MLA), The Chicago Manual of Style, and the American Psychological Association (APA).\n\nWithin the \u201cCite this article\u201d tool, pick a style to see how all available information looks when formatted according to that style.

She started studying the Swazi culture and *ociating with the Swaziland's royal family after she was awarded with a grant by the International African Ins*ute of London. She studied and illustrated Swazi traditions embodied in the political vision of King Sobhuza II, who later became a close friend. King Sobhuza II personally awarded Kuper with Swazi citizenship in 1970.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn to Lithuanian Jewish and Austrian Jewish parents in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia, Kuper moved to South Africa after the death of her father. She studied at the University of the Wi*ersrand and, afterwards, at the London School of Economics under Malinowski.\n\nDoctoral fieldwork and anthropological career\n\nIn 1934, Kuper won a fellowship from the International African Ins*ute to study in Swaziland. In July of that year, while at an education conference in Johannesburg, she met Sobhuza II, paramount chief and later king of Swaziland. With *istance from Sobhuza and Malinowski, Kuper moved to the royal village of Lobamba and was introduced to Sobhuza's mother, the queen mother Lomawa. Here Kuper learned siSwati and pursued her fieldwork. This phase of Kuper's researches into Swazi culture culminated in the two-part dissertation, An African Aristocracy: Rank among the Swazi (1947) and The Uniform of Colour: a Study of White\u2013Black Relationships in Swaziland (1947).\n\nIn the early 1950s, Kuper moved to Durban. During that decade, she focused her studies on the Indian community in the Natal region, as summarised in Indian People in Natal (1960). In 1953, Kuper received a senior lectureship at the University of Natal in Durban. In addition to her academic work, together with her husband, Leo Kuper, she helped to found the Liberal Party in Natal\n\nIn 1961 the Kupers moved to Los Angeles, to escape the har*ment of liberals that was increasingly prevalent in apartheid South Africa, and to enable Leo to accept a professorship in sociology at UCLA. In 1963 Kuper published The Swazi: a South African Kingdom and was herself appointed professor of anthropology at UCLA.

Meer conducted fieldwork and influenced Kuper\u2019s Indian People in Natal (1960) as well as Kuper\u2019s play The Decision (1957). One of the themes in Meer\u2019s work was black and Indian women\u2019s experiences of racism and sexism and the use of suicide as a mode of resistance within apartheid South Africa (1976). This presentation explores how Kuper and Meer influenced each other\u2019s writings and anti-apartheid activism.\n\nOrganization\n\nI begin with an explanation of Hilda Kuper & Fatima Meer and then move into their collaboration, focusing on the publications they wrote together or that were thematically connected. In part 3, I detail the timeline of their relationship. In the last section, I describe Hilda\u2019s play The Decision, influenced by her research with Fatima Meer and discuss their overlapping themes such as suicide and different types of elites within the Indian community in South Africa.\n\nPart 1: Intro to Hilda Kuper & Fatima Meer\n\nHilda Kuper was born in 1911 in Bulawayo, Rhodesia, grew up in Johannesburg, South Africa and received her anthropological training with Winifred Hoernl\u00e9 at the University of Witwatersrand and Bronislaw Malinowski at the London School of Economics. Kuper\u2019s first fieldwork involved studying the impact of liquor laws on black women in Johannesburg. Later her research sites expanded to Swaziland and Indian communities in Durban, Natal, South Africa, where she formed a life-long friendship and research partnership with sociologist, Fatima Meer, who was of South African, Indian, Muslim and Jewish descent. Their collaboration will be the focus of this presentation.\n\nHilda Kuper at her home in Los Angeles, 1974, at a party organized for her students, photograph by Dawn Chatty\n\nThrough Hilda\u2019s marriage to Leo Kuper she became involved in non-violent apartheid protests as one of the founders of the Liberal Party and was forced to leave South Africa; she eventually became a Professor of Anthropology at UCLA.\n\nHilda Kuper (center) with Leo Kuper, her husband (behind), and Max Gluckman, her old friend and anthropology colleague from the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, (at the right) at Watts Towers, Los Angeles. Hilda Kuper Papers, UCLA Special Collections, Box 45, Folder 20. For more information on the connection between Max Gluckman and Hilda Kuper see Andrew Bank, p. 193, n. 17\n\nIn her theorizing about black women, Hilda took a \u201cSwazi point of view,\u201d arguing that Westernization weakened women\u2019s position. She portrayed Swazi women and Indian South African women as the victims of colonization as well as patriarchal indigenous systems.\n\nHilda\u2019s initial interests in law, acting, languages and history, morphed into her career as a legal and political anthropologist, novelist and playwright. Durkheim and French sociology were also highly influential, as both Hilda and her research collaborator, Fatima Meer, wrote about suicide and women of color in Southern Africa.\n\nHilda\u2019s graduate student at UCLA, David Kuby, said the following of her Jewish identity:\n\n\u201cJewish, British and African are quite a combination of values not easily put into one neat box and there was a comfortable, very human dimension of Hilda that was humble and nonjudgmental that made one feel very accepted in our imperfections despite Hilda\u2019s high standards for scholarship and social justice work.\u201d -David Kuby, December 29, 2016, e-mail correspondence\n\nThe information in this section comes from a brief bio I wrote of Hilda, based on my dissertation. You can find the full bio I wrote here on my academia.edu page and the excerpt from it was published at Bustle.com.\n\nFatima Meer and Nelson Mandela at her home in 1995, image by Richard Shorey\n\n\u201cMeer\u2019s Gujrati grandfather, Ismail, had arrived in South Africa as a trader from Surat on the east coast of India in the 1880s. Her father, Moosa Meer, was the editor of Indian Views, a weekly in Urdu and English. Her mother, Ameena, was a white woman [whose father was Jewish] originally called Rachel. The Meer household was a mixture of Muslim Gujarati traditions and liberal political activism; Fatima combined the two.\u201d\n\nWajid, Arjumand. 2010. \u201cFatima Meer: Academic and Activist.\u201d The Hindu, March 30, 2010.\n\n\u201cAt a time when most Indian girls were helping their mothers in the kitchen making samosas, this young woman was leading protest marches and challenging the most oppressive system in the world.\u201d Winnie Mandela\n\nFrom the Wajid obituary of Fatima Meer, March 30, 2010.\n\nAn article about Fatima\u2019s artwork that was created while she was in the Women\u2019s Gaol in Johannesburg has just come out this October in the New Yorker magazine. I visited the Gaol in March 2017, while in Johannesburg for my dissertation research. You can also learn about Fatima\u2019s art work during her imprisonment here.\n\n\u201cMorning in the Prison Yard\u201d by Fatima Meer, a photograph I took of her painting, one of many displayed on this mesh-like canvas throughout the women\u2019s gaol. Photo by Abby Gondek, March 26, 2017\n\nPhotograph of myself taking a photo of the display for the wash-house courtyard. This was one of the most traumatic areas in the prison because I learned that female prisoners had to wash all of the clothing, including the male prisoners\u2019 pants, which were oftentimes stained with blood (likely from being raped or lashed). These are images from the Women\u2019s Gaol in downtown Johannesburg, where Fatima Meer was detained (in 1976) and painted scenes from her daily life in the prison. The painting on the left contains the following explanation written by Meer: \u201cThe two prisoners in the foreground are carrying our bath water from the kitchen. The other prisoner brings our flask of boiling water. The awaiting trial prisoners line up for breakfast on the left. The \u2018convicted\u2019 line up on the right. The three prisoners facing the wall are waiting for sanitary pads. They will get three each for the day.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026in 1976, [Fatima Meer] was held for six months, without trial, under the apartheid government\u2019s Terrorism Act. Her crime was an attempt to organize a mass rally with the activist Steve Biko, after police shot at and killed student protesters in the township of Soweto.\u201d Anakwa Dwamena, October 23, 2019, The New Yorker\n\nPart 2: Writing collaboration\n\nHilda collaborated with Fatima Meer on a project about Indian South Africans in Durban, Natal (Kuper and Meer 1956).\n\nThis network visualization developed using nodegoat, a project of Lab1100, displays the connections between the publications of Hilda Kuper and Fatima Meer.\n\nThis network visualization displays the publications written by Hilda Kuper and Fatima Meer. \u201cIndian Elites in Natal\u201d (1956), co-authored by Kuper and Meer, shared a thematic focus on Indian South Africans and protest with Hilda\u2019s book Indian People in Natal (1960), for which Fatima Meer acted as a research assistant. \u201cIndian Elites\u201d also shared an emphasis on Indian ethnic groups, such as Tamil and Hindustani, with Hilda\u2019s play The Decision (1957). All three of these works, contrasted the \u201cAfrican\u201d (meaning black) and Indian South African populations. Note the connection between Violaine Junod\u2019s \u201cReport on a Study of the Coloured \u2018Social Elite\u2019 in London\u201d (1952) and Hilda Kuper and Fatima Meer\u2019s \u201cIndian Elites in Natal\u201d (1956). Violaine Junod was close to both Hilda Kuper and Fatima Meer (Junod n.d.). Fatima Meer described the Kupers and Violaine Junod as her \u201cmost constant friends\u201d during the Treason Trials in 1956 (Meer 2017, 169).\n\nJunod, Violaine. n.d. \u201cViolaine Junod Letters to Hilda Kuper, Correspondence from 1970s-80s.\u201d Box 52.

Cape Town: Kwela Books.\n\nPart 3: Hilda and Fatima\u2019s relationship\n\nHilda met Fatima Meer in 1952 when Hilda moved to Durban, where her husband Leo Kuper, received a Sociology chair position at the University of Natal. It was Leo, the new head of the department, who allowed Fatima to rewrite her sociology honors exam (after she had been failed by a racist Afrikaner Nationalist lecturer); she passed with \u201cflying colours\u201d (Meer 2017, 150-151).\n\nFatima was Hilda\u2019s research assistant for Kuper\u2019s book Indian People in Natal (Kuper 1960, x). The Institute of Community and Family Health in the Newlands neighborhood in Durban funded this research (Meer 2017, 155). Fatima\u2019s fieldwork notebooks in the Hilda Kuper Papers, elaborate the effect of Indian immigration to South Africa upon caste affiliation, marriage traditions, legally required medical care, and labor strikes. Meer also tracked and summarized the ship logs by sex, age, caste, religion, village, and marriage status (Kuper et al. 1953). In her autobiography, Fatima refers to \u201cfilling in dozens of these reporter\u2019s notebooks\u201d but unfortunately, she was dismissed after only a year from this position at the Institute of Community and Family Health because of her anti-apartheid activism and radicalism; Hilda and Fatima were both shocked (2017, 158). Hilda clearly used Fatima\u2019s notes in Indian People in Natal in Chapter 1 regarding migration and Chapter 2 on changes in caste affiliation post-migration.\n\nKuper, Hilda, Fatima Meer, R. Singh. 1953. \u201cHilda Kuper Papers, Box 14 (Fatima Meer and R.

She worked with Indian health educators who were trained by the Institute of Community and Family Health including four women Miss N. Perumal, Mrs. Padmini Govindoo, Sally Naidoo and Violet Padayachee. In addition to Fatima Meer, Mrs. Radhi Singh assisted Hilda (Bank 2016, 218-221; Kuper 1960, x).\n\nBank, Andrew. 2016. Pioneers of the Field: South Africa\u2019s Women Anthropologists. London, England: Cambridge University Press, International African Institute.\n\nThe Kuper home was a central site for anti-apartheid solidarity across racial lines. On November 9, 1952, Leo collaborated with the joint ANC-Indian Congress political rally at Red Square in Durban; he wrote about his experiences in Passive Resistance in South Africa (1955). Leo was arrested in 1956 with Alan Paton and four Indian Congress members for their participation in the \u201cassembly of the Native\u201d in the Gandhi Library Hall in Durban; this is where they launched a defense fund for the 156 Treason Trialists. Hilda was arrested earlier in 1956 with Fatima Meer at a women\u2019s march protesting new laws that extended the pass system to \u201cnon-European\u201d women (Bank 2016, 217\u201318). Also in 1956, the Kupers \u201csolicited a loan\u201d and \u201cstood guarantor\u201d for Fatima and her husband Ismail Meer, so that they could get the capital to build their house, since non-whites could not get loans at that time (Meer 2017, 163).\n\nHilda was \u201ccombative with non-progressive colleagues\u201d and was excluded from a departmental research trip to Swaziland, despite her expertise (Russell 1994, 146). By the late 1950s, the apartheid police increasingly harassed Leo and Hilda, spies attended their lectures, and Leo was threatened with a banning order; eventually Hilda instigated their departure from South Africa (Golomski 2011, 4; Moran 1988, 198).\n\nRussell, Margo. 1994. \u201cOBITUARY: Hilda Kuper, 1911-92.\u201d Africa 64 (1): 145\u201349.\n\nGolomski, Casey. 2011. \u201cHilda Kuper, Anthropology, History.\u201d In University of Swaziland, UNISWA, History Staff Seminar Series, 21.

Young Research Library.\n\nIn closing, Hilda wrote, \u201cThere is so much to talk about that cannot be expressed in letters. We think of you very often and send you much, much love\u201d (Kuper 1970). In her autobiography, Fatima wrote that Hilda Kuper \u201cconsidered the manuscript so good that she canvassed the head of department to award me a doctorate for it\u201d (Meer 2017, 186).\n\nIn this letter from Hilda to Fatima, Hilda explains that she is about to visit her daughter Mary in Israel, before going to Swaziland (in 1970 Hilda became a Swazi citizen). Hilda complements Fatima on her new book and expresses how much both she and Leo think of Fatima and send much love.

In this play, Savitree, a girl from a high caste Hindi speaking family in Durban, in Natal province, South Africa, fell in love with a Tamil Christian boy, Siva, whose family was from Southern India.\n\nThe cover page for the program of Hilda\u2019s 1957 version of The Decision, performed in Durban by medical students at the University of Natal. Sondra Hale personal collection of Hilda Kuper\u2019s creative writing at UCLA, Anthropology Department.\n\nTheir different ethnicities and religions, as well as the fact that Siva was active in the Indian National Congress and the passive resistance movement, marked Siva as \u201cother\u201d and unmarriageable (61). One version of the story closed when Savitree set fire to herself and died because her family forbade her to be with Siva (Kuper 1993, 63).\n\nKuper, Hilda. 1993. A Witch in My Heart: Short Stories and Poems. Edited by Nancy Schmidt. Madison: African Studies Program, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. https://books.google.com/books?id=bh5aAAAAMAAJ&pgis=1.\n\nIn a different version of the play, Savitree sacrificed herself by marrying the man her family decided she should marry (Kuper 1957, 30\u201331).\n\nKuper, Hilda. 1957. \u201cThe Decision: A Contemporary South African Indian Play.\u201d Durban Medical Students Drama Group. Los Angeles, CA: Sondra Hale Personal Collection, UCLA Anthropology Department, Haines Hall 391.\n\nDirectly before Siva heard the news of Savitree\u2019s suicide (in the 1993 version) he told his activist friends that Indian South African families imprison their daughters in domestic roles, preventing their freedom. Siva\u2019s friend Rajid Naidoo argued:\n\n\u201cAfrican women are a major force in African politics, but few Indian women are active in political affairs.\u201d Hilda Kuper, 1993\n\nThis implied that the problem was within Indian culture, rather than South African culture as a whole. Siva\u2019s friend Chetty remarked that the women should \u201cfree themselves\u201d rather than waiting for men to do so, upon which Siva discovered that Savitree killed herself, causing the reader to wonder if this was Savitree\u2019s way of \u201cfreeing herself\u201d (Kuper 1993, 63).\n\nIn the 1957 version of the play, Siva\u2019s words close the play:\n\n\u201call I wanted is to be myself and let others be themselves.\u201d Hilda Kuper, 1957\n\nHe contended that Savitree should not have had to sacrifice herself for her family out of the \u201cstrength of her affection for others, for those who had brought her up.\u201d Siva emphasized that her loyalty should not lie with her family alone but with the \u201cfamily of the people of the world\u201d (31).\n\nPerhaps, this was Kuper\u2019s message for unity rather than separation between not only Indian South Africans, but also all South Africans.\n\nIntriguingly, Kuper revealed that she had never published the play because a few Indian couples confronted her after a performance of the play in Durban (by Indian medical students) to inform her they would sue her for writing about their families. Though she did not know these families Hilda\n\n\u201crealized that I had struck a very vulnerable center and Indians were already scapegoated for much of the antagonisms so sadly I put the manuscript aside\u201d but she was revising it for publication in the months before her death (Schmidt 1993, 1, n.5). Schmidt, Nancy J. 1993. \u201cIntroduction.\u201d In A Witch in My Heart: Short Stories and Poems, 1\u20133. Madison: African Studies Program, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.\n\nHilda had written about a case very similar to the one she depicted in her play, in her 1960 book, Indian People in Natal (for which Fatima was a research assistant).\n\n\u201cBy no means unusual is the case of the girl from an orthodox Hindi speaking family who fell in love with a Tamil boy; on discovering this, her parents married her to a man of their own choice. From the beginning the girl was most unhappy with her in-laws, and after one of her frequent visits home she threatened to commit suicide if forced to return to them.\u201d Hilda Kuper, Indian People in Natal, 1960, p. 136\n\nThe Decision echoes some of the findings from a paper about Indian elites in Natal, co-written by Fatima Meer and Hilda Kuper (1956). They described two primary elite groups: the protest and compromise elites.\n\n\u201cThe protest elites, led mainly by intellectuals, identify with Non-Europeans and \u2018oppressed people\u2019 in general; the compromise elites operate as a defensive and exclusive minority\u201d (Kuper and Meer 1956, 145). Kuper, Hilda, and Fatima Meer. 1956. \u201cIndian Elites in Natal, South Africa.\u201d In Social Science Conference, University of Natal, Institute for Social Research, 129\u201345. Durban, Natal, South Africa: University of Natal, Institute for Social Research.\n\nSiva was part of the protest elite, while Savitree\u2019s family represented the compromise elites. Meer and Kuper found that original caste differences between Indian immigrants were fading because of the\n\n\u201cupward mobility of the ex-indentured and the downward pressure from the Europeans, and it appears that the Indian elite of the future will relate more to the Non-Europeans in general than to specific sectional groups.\u201d Kuper and Meer, 1956, p. 145\n\nInterestingly, despite caste distinctions fading, ethnic differences were not, for example between Tamil, Telegu and Hindustani, which are clearly displayed in Hilda\u2019s play since Savitree\u2019s Hindustani family disapproved of Siva because he was Tamil (Kuper 1957; Kuper and Meer 1956, 130).\n\nThis article about Indian elites echoes (thought does not cite) Violaine Junod\u2019s findings from 1952 about protest and compromise leaders among the \u201ccoloured\u201d social elite in Britain. Compromise leaders were the intermediaries between white and black groups, serving as non-political token \u201ccoloured\u201d spokespeople \u201con show\u201d in a \u201czoo situation\u201d within white organizations, which were \u201csympathetic\u201d to \u201ccolonial\u201d issues. Compromise leaders had no direct ties to either colonial nationalist governments or to policy makers and were seen as \u201cacting white\u201d (Banton 1960:151-153). In contrast, protest leaders had close links with colonial nationalist movements, denounced white racism, and held defiant attitudes toward whites supposedly \u201csympathetic\u201d to the cause. Protest leaders were esteemed by \u201ccoloured\u201d community members but disliked by whites (Banton 1960:152).\n\nBanton, Michael. 1960. White and Coloured: The Behavior of British People towards Coloured Immigrants. 2nd ed. New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press.\n\nFatima and Hilda\u2019s findings related to Indians and suicide are interconnected.\n\n\u201cFrom the official figures of \u2018self inflicted deaths\u2019 published for Durban, the number of Indians who took their own lives is roughly the same as of Europeans, both being proportionately higher than the number of Africans and Coloureds; but when to these figures is added deaths in the category of \u2018accidental burning\u2019 \u2013 and burning is the traditional method of committing suicide among Hindus -the Indians outnumber all other racial groups.\u201d Hilda Kuper, 1960, p. 173\n\nThis is one of the tables from Fatima Meer\u2019s 1976 Race and Suicide in South Africa, p. 236. In the earlier period, 1940-60, Indian women had the highest mean suicide rate (16.2) among women and were only second to White males. In the later period, Indian women\u2019s suicide rate increased to 26.4 (yet all groups increased) but this rate was less than that of Coloured women, as well as four other race-gender groups.\n\n\n\nThis table (23b) from Fatima Meer\u2019s 1976 Race and Suicide, emphasizes that the huge majority of Indian women who committed suicide were housewives. This was also true of Coloured women, but the Indian women\u2019s percentage was much higher. Not pictured here is table 23a: of African women who committed suicide, 63.9% were housewives, while 53.7% of white women who committed suicide were housewives. See pages 249-250.\n\nConclusion\n\nFatima Meer and Hilda Kuper collaborated both political and theoretically, through their shared research interests. Hilda supported Fatima unconditionally (both financially and academically) while Fatima conducted foundational fieldwork which informed Hilda\u2019s writing, both academic and creative (through Hilda\u2019s play The Decision). Some of the key themes that they developed were the differences between Black women and Indian women in terms of involvement in South African politics. Fatima investigated the differences in suicide rates by race, gender, class and occupation in South Africa in the mid-20th century. Hilda explored a specific instance of suicide through her fictional play, which was based on the research she had conducted with Fatima. They also shared an interest in different types of elites, protest v. compromise elites, and they investigated how caste differences were becoming less important while ethnic differences were not, as evidenced in Hilda\u2019s play, The Decision.\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License."}]}
