He joined the Imperial Navy in 1934 and completed pilot training in December 1936. His first combat occurred over China in early 1938. He emerged as one of the top aces of the Imperial Japan during WWII, credited with at least 94 aerial victories including 14 victories in China. Subsequently, he flew Zeros from the aircraft carrier Zuikaku from December 1941 to May 1942, including at the Battle of the Coral Sea. He was Nicknamed Zero Fighter Ace Kotetsu \u201cTiger Tetsu\u201d.\n\nImage Source: snappygoat.com\n\nIn late 1943, Iwamoto\u2019s air group was sent to Rabaul, New Britain, resulting in three months of air combat against Allied air raids. Subsequent assignments were Truk Atoll in the Carolines and the Philippines, being commissioned an ensign in October 1944. Following the evacuation of the Philippines, Iwamoto served in home defense and trained kamikaze pilots.\n\nBattle of Rabaul (1942). Map depicting eastern New Guinea and New Britain. Image Source: Wikipedia\n\nAs a result of the Japanese use of the British naval practices, the IJNAS scoring system was based on the system the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force (RAF) adopted from World War I until World War II. This system differed from the scoring system used by some other nations during World War II. Tetsuzo Iwamoto was one of the greatest air aces of the Imperial Japanese Navy. During his career, as per his personal records in his diary he is supposed to have achieved 242 air victories, 14 in China, 202 confirmed in the Pacific, 26 shared victories and 27 unconfirmed victories. He is supposed to have damaged two planes and destroyed two on the ground. Research by academics surnamed Izawa and Hata in 1971 estimated his score at about 87. Irrespective of the scoring system, Tetsuz\u014d Iwamoto was the Japan\u2019s top ace. Iwamoto was known as the Ch\u016btai leader (Flying Company, squadron of 8 to 16 fighters). Iwamoto was one of few survivors of the IJNAS through the war. He fought over the Indian and the Pacific Ocean from north to south, and trained young pilots even in the last months of the war. Like many Japanese veterans, Iwamoto was reported to have fallen into depression after the war. His diary was found after his death, claimed of 202 Allied aircraft destroyed.\n\nSecond From the Right. Image Source: ameblo.jp.\n\nYoung Days\n\nTetsuzo was the third son of the Iwamoto family, born on a border town, southern part of Karafuto (now Sakhalin, Russia) on 15 June 1916. His father was a chief police officer. Later he grew up in Sapporo, Hokkaid\u014d, Japan. He enjoyed skiing in his elementary school days. When he lived in Sapporo. When he was 13, his father retired and Tetsuzo moved with his family to his father\u2019s hometown, Masuda, Shimane Prefecture. He studied at the Prefectural Masuda Agricultural and Forestry High School. His favorite school subjects were mathematics and geometry; in these subjects, he always scored very high. Whilst he was a gifted student both academically and physically, his popularity with his teachers was poor due to his insubordinate, rebellious and sometimes outright rude nature. He was otherwise an active and nimble boy. He joined a school club brass band as a trumpeter. Another hobby was growing plants and flowers. He helped local fishermen in the fishing season, going out to the sandy beach early in the morning and driving fish into the nets. He was regarded as the most opinionated student in his school, and often talked down his teachers in discussions, which was considered impolite.\n\nShimane Prefecture Japan. Image Source: Wikipedia\n\nChooses a Military Career\n\nIwamoto started his military career in 1934 after he graduated the school at 18. Following the advice from his parents to study while young, Tetsuzo left for a large city where he was supposed to take a college entrance examination. He, however, secretly applied for and passed the examination for acceptance as an Imperial Japanese naval airman 4th class, and was promoted to 3rd class 5 months later. His parents were very disappointed, for they became reliant upon Tetsuzo rather than his eldest brother, who was already studying at some university in a large city and would not return to Masuda.\n\nTetsuzo iwamoto sunglass. Image Source: snappygoat.com\n\nGets Enrolled For Flight Training\n\nIn 1936, when he was a naval mechanic 2nd class and a crewman on the light aircraft carrier Ry\u016bj\u014d, he studied hard and passed the difficult IJNAS exam, taken by thousands of applicants. He was enrolled in the class 34th Sojyu-Renshusei flight trainee program for naval petty officers and sailors. He graduated as one of the select 26 young aviators of the class 34th in December of that year.\n\nIn April 1936, he was sent to Kasumigaura-Ku as a probationer. While his training going on November 1, 1936, he was promoted to naval mechanic 1st class. Finally on December 26, he graduated 34th class of Sojyu-Renshusei, was promoted to airman 1st class (old rank name of pre-war Japan, equivalent to senior airman). During flight training school at the Tomobe branch of Kasumigaura-Ku his fighter course instructor was the famous Chitoshi Isozaki.\n\nImperial Japanese Navy (IJN) Air Ace Chitoshi Isozaki, 12 Victories.

Iwamoto entered Saeki K\u014dk\u016btai Naval Air Group, which was based both at land and onboard a carrier, for 6 months of advanced training. After this he joined Omura K\u014dk\u016btai on July 16, 1937 for operational training. He had tough training there from senior pilots including Air Petty Officer 1st class Toshio Kuroiwa, who was the IJNAS legendary dogfight master pilot. Tetsuzo Iwamoto had to wait for operational debut till February 10, 1938.\n\nChina Front\n\nThe Second Sino_japanese war was already on. After combat training, on February 10, 1938, Tetsuz\u014d Iwamoto was led by his leader APO 1/C Toshio Kuroiwa, flying for two and a quarter hours over the China Sea from Omura Airbase at Ky\u016bsh\u016b Japan, ferrying to the airfield outside of Nanjing China. Tetsuzo\u2019s ability as a fighter pilot was recognized by all on his first air mission with his squadron, the 13th Flying Group on February 25, 1938, over Nanchang, China. This Flying Group was highly regarded and was famed as the Nango Fighter Squadron, named after its former squadron leader, Mochifumi Nango, who had showed considerable courage and conspicuous leadership.\n\nNanchang Dajiaochang Airport, China. 800 m Runway in 1938. Image Source: Wikipedia\n\nFirst Combat Mission \u2013 Four Victories\n\nOn February 25, 1938, his squadron\u2019s fighters escorted bombers Type 96 land-based attack aircraft. 16 Chinese fighters attacked the formation, and the squadron\u2019s leader Lieutenant Takuma was lost on this mission. Iwamoto described his first combat in his notes. During the escort mission, the squadron was intercepted by sixteen I-15s and I-16s at an altitude of 5000 meters. Iwamoto claimed 4 victories (1 probable) in the combat. He secured his first victory by firing when within 50m of the enemy fighter. He first saw white smoke, then the enemy burned up and crashed. He was then at an altitude of 4000 m. When he looked back, there was an enemy fighter just behind him. He instantly made a Split S maneuver and narrowly escaped.\n\nMitsubishi G3M Type 96 Bomber Aircraft. Image Source: alchetron.com\n\nHe got his second victory against an I-15. He saw it below him, turned and attacked from its 6 o\u2019clock high. When it was hit, it climbed sharply and went spinning downward out of control and crashed into the ground. He kept his altitude of 4,000 m. He got an I-16 at the top of its roll in his gunsight and fired a burst, its engine burning and out of control; Tetsuzo lost sight of it before it crashed, and he reported this as probable. Another I-15 came down to him from 12 o\u2019clock ahead. Both made a climb and were soon in a dogfight. The I-15 tried to break free of him and made a straight dive. That action made it easier for Tetsuzo to aim. He downed this I-15 on farmland near the airfield. He was flying at an altitude of 2000 m.\n\nPolikarpov I-15 Soviet biplane fighter aircraft. Image Source: Wikipedia\n\nAbove him, many enemy fighters were maneuvering. He found one of them coming down with landing gear down. He chased it to an altitude of 200 m and fired a burst. The I-16 was surprised and made a split S maneuver, but crashed at a corner of the airfield. This was his 4th victory.\n\nOne the left, Back Row. Image Source: snappygoat.com 2\n\nAnti-aircraft guns started firing heavily, and he found himself in an intense barrage of flak. Rushing to escape at full throttle with a number of enemy fighters behind him, he succeeded in returning safely from the battlefield. His section leader Kuroiwa with whom he had separated had already returned to the Wuhu airfield, Anhui China, waiting for his return. Kuroiwa scolded Tetsu severely for the rash attacks he made on the day.\n\nSoviet Polikarpov I-16 the world\u2019s first low-wing cantilever monoplane fighter with retractable landing gear. Image Source: Wikipedia\n\n13th and 12th Flying Groups Merge\n\nOn 22 Mar 1938, the 13th Flying Group Fighter Squadron was merged with the 12th Fighter Squadron on March 22, 1938, where Type 96 carrier fighters for 1st Chutai had landing gear painted in red and were called \u201cRed legs squadron\u201d while 2nd Chutai had gear painted in blue and were called \u201cBlue legs squadron\u201c. On 29 Apr 1938, he fought Chinese Air Force fighters and scored several victories, and was later awarded a citation by Commander Tsukahara for his extreme courage and conspicuous gallantry in action above and beyond the call of duty as a fighter pilot against intense Chinese air force.\n\nMITSUBISHI A5M4 Type 96 Carrier fighter (Allies called \u201cCLAUDE\u201d). Image Source: craymond.no-ip.info\n\nIwamoto Becomes Top IJNAS Ace in China\n\nBy Sep 1938, he had completed 82 missions, and had 14 kills on his records and had become the top Japanese IJNAS ace. His activities subsequently earned him \u201cOrder of the Golden Kite \u2013 5th class\u201d recommendation in 1940. In September 1938, 22-year-old Iwamoto was ordered back to Japan, where he became a member of the Saiki Air Group and appointed to a training staff.\n\nJapanese Order of the Golden Kite, 5th Class. Image Source: warthunder.com\n\nPacific War \u2013 Pearl Harbour & Carol Sea\n\nAfter a tour as an instructor, Petty Officer First Class Iwamoto returned to the front line onboard the carrier Zuikaku, now flying the legendary A6M \u2018Zero\u2019 fighter. Iwamoto was airborne for the day of infamy \u2013 the attack on Pearl Harbor \u2013 but flew air cover over the carrier group itself rather than escorting the actual raid. Iwamoto was heavily involved in the air war in the Pacific from the outset, regularly leading flights of A6Ms against their American, British and Australian counterparts. Iwamoto flew in the violent air engagements of the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942, during which Zuikaku\u2019s air group suffered significant losses. This necessitated a return to Japan for resupply and to train replacement aircrew which resulted in Iwamoto and his comrades missing the Battle of Midway. Small team in Japan who frantically tried to train new aircrew to stem the advancing allies.\n\nLegendary A6M \u2018Zero\u2019 fighter. Image Source: warthunder.com\n\nRabaul, New Britain\n\nAfter a year of instructional duties, Chief Petty Officer Iwamoto returned to the front line and joined the 253rd Air Group, flying A6Ms from Rabaul, New Britain, in November 1943. Involved in daily air combat, the experienced fighter leader led his cadre of increasingly junior and less experienced pilots against the might of the US Navy and USAAF. Whilst operating from Rabaul, Iwamoto filed claims for a staggering 142 enemy aircraft shot down.\n\nCaroline Islands. Image Source: Wikipedia\n\nCaroline & Philippine Islands\n\nAfter withdrawing from Rabaul, Iwamoto returned to Japan in June 1944 for a brief respite from the front line, before fighting in the skies over Formosa, then transferred to Truk Atoll in the Caroline Islands and then the Philippine Islands during autumn and the winter. In November 1944 Iwamoto\u2019s skill and leadership were further recognised when he was commissioned as an officer in the ranks of the Japanese Navy, holding the rank of Ensign. Iwamoto\u2019s last operational sorties were flown with the 203rd Air Group, defending Kyushu and Okinawa in the furthest Southwest reaches of Japan against the long ranged B-29 attacks and the might of the US Navy\u2019s carrier borne air power. The last few months of Iwamoto\u2019s war were spent training kamikaze pilots at Iwakuni airfield on Honshu island.\n\nChiran high school girls wave farewell with cherry blossom branches to departing kamikaze pilot. Image Source: Wikipedia\n\nTactics\n\nHe was best at one-vs-one dogfights. He often employed, quick roll tactic combining with skidding sideway for sudden deceleration within 1/2 quick roll to make the opponent on the tail to overshoot. Corkscrew loop (Hineri-Komi Senp\u014d) was a short-cut or twist-in loop tactic, also called the skidding loop. He had also mastered the High and Low Yo-yo manouvres (Suichoku-Senkai Kasoku Senp\u014d). His favourite formation tactics, was a two group linked formation attack, where one section plays offence, zooming and diving formation attack, another section plays defense, positioned on the higher altitude to cover and support the offence section. Keeping his groups underneath thick clouds to hide his formation and waiting until the small number of opponent aircraft group coming down, then diving and zooming attack with all in a formation.\n\nLow Yo-yo. Image Source: Wikipedia\n\nAttacking the opponent formations after their mission was over and they were on the way to the regroup point, to fly back across the distance range over the sea. This tactics was taken when his own group had much fewer aircraft. Aerial Bomb attack tactic, was a twelve o\u2019clock high vertical dive attack from the front top in inverted flight (Haimen Suichoku K\u014dka Senp\u014d). It was almost vertical diving (about 60 degree) attack because the 30 kg aerial bomb needed the releasing speed over 280 knots to work timer correctly for the explosion. Inverted flight at the starting point because Zero Fighter could not keep steep angle while diving due to its high flight stability.\n\n\n\nFlight leader Masao Sato with his pilots aboard Zuikaku, 6 Dec 1941, one day before Pearl Harbour Attack; Tetsuzo Iwamoto second row, right-most. Image Source: ww2db.com\n\nAnother tactic that Japanese often employed was called \u201cSend Wolf \u201c, which essentially meant first sending a strike against US targets, and then attacking those US aircraft that got airborne after the base had been attacked by surprise. He was very good at using the 30 kg No. 3 Aerial Bomb, which was difficult to handle, although it was used against aircraft, and caused great damage.\n\nJapanese Type 99 30kg High-explosive bomb. Image Source: commons.wikimedia.org\n\nAerial Victories Claimed in His Diary\n\nHis own diary claimed that he had downed 202 aircraft during the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War while sharing credit with others for another 26 kills; this translated to somewhere between 80 and 90 kills based on the scoring system used by American airmen during WW2. 94 victories is what has been assigned to him.\n\nVought F4U Corsair. Image Source: Wikipedia\n\nHe had claimed seven victories against Grumman F4F Wildcat (Coral Sea, 8 May 1942, and at Rabaul, late 1943; 19 February 1944 the escort fighters of Martin flying boat). His claimed four Lockheed P-38 Lightning P-38 victories, at \u2013 4 (Rabaul, late 1943 \u2013 1944). 48 victories against Vought F4U Corsair, plus one unconfirmed. These were at Rabaul, Mobara-airbase outskirts of Tokyo, during Operation Kikusui, Okinawa, March 10 \u2013 June 24, 1945). This was more than 1 in 4 of all F4U air-to-air losses during the Second World War. He claimed two Bell P-39 Airacobra at Rabaul in late 1943. He claimed one Curtiss P-40 Warhawk at Rabaul, late 1943. He also claimed 39 Grumman F6F Hellcat victories, that included 29 (at Rabaul late 1943 \u2013 Feb 1944; Truk 28\u201329 April 1944; Operation Kikusui, Okinawa, March 10 \u2013 June 15, 1945). He claimed one Republic P-47 Thunderbolt victory over Rabaul, late 1943 \u2013 1944. He claimed one North American Aviation P-51 Mustang over Rabaul, on 19 February 1944, the Allied 2nd air-raid of the day. He claimed to have shot four British Spitfire burned on the ground, two shot over Indian Ocean on 9 April 1942. He claimed 48 US Navy\u2019s Douglas SBD Dauntless with seven unconfirmed, (Coral Sea, 8 May 1942; Rabaul, late 1943 \u2013 February 1944; Truk 28, 29 April 1944; Battle off Formosa, 12 October 1944). He also reportedly shot down 30 Douglas SBD Dauntless using No.3 Aerial Bombs over Rabaul, in late 1943 \u2013 1944. He claimed five Grumman TBF Avenger, with 19 uncofirmed. These were at Rabaul, late 1943 to February 1944, the Allied 6th and the 3rd final air-raid of the day to Rabaul. He claimed five Curtiss SB2C Helldiver at Rabaul late 1943 to early 1944). He also claimed five North American B-25 Mitchell medium bombers at Rabaul, starting late 1943 to 19 February 1944, during the Allied 4th air-raid of the day. He claimed two Martin B-26 Marauder American twin-engined medium bomber at Rabaul. He claimed six Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers using No. 3 Aerial Bombs and damaged two at Truk, reportedly confirmed by ground crew. He claimed one Boeing B-29 Superfortress four-engine propeller-driven heavy bomber at Kagoshima, Kyushu, Japan, April 1945. He claimed a PBY5A flying boat over Indian Ocean on April 5, 1942. He reportedly shot a Martin Mariner flying boat victory at Rabaul, on 19 February 1944. This aircraft was escorted by 12 F4Fs. He strafed three Destroyers on the night of February 5, 1944. He strafed many Landing crafts at Kerama islands, Okinawa, on night March 26, 1945. He strafed airfields Lae, Eastern New Guinea, on January 23, 1942, and Torokina, Bougainville, Solomons, on night 1944.\n\nUS Navy\u2019s Douglas SBD Dauntless Dive Bomber. Image Source: blenderartists.org\n\nAir Kills Debate \u2013 Yet Greatest Japanese Fighter Ace of All Time.\n\nIwamoto\u2019s final number of kills remains open to debate. A combination of the Japanese practice of crediting victories to a squadron rather than an individual, lost records and discrepancies between the confirmation process in Japan and allied nations mean that the final tally will never be known. Most sources officially credit Iwamoto with 80 kills in WW II plus 14 in China, his war diary claims 202 individual victories, 26 shared and 22 unconfirmed. An outspoken, opinionated and brash man on the ground, Iwamoto was conversely a tactically minded and cool headed aviator who favoured hit and run tactics over dog-fighting. There is a very good chance that he was, and forever will be, the greatest Japanese fighter ace of all time.\n\nZero Fighting Tiger. Image Source: snappygoat.com\n\nThe \u201cZero Fighting Tiger\u201d\n\nTetsuzo had reportedly flown 8,000 hrs by March 1944. He was an operational leader, cleared for solo fighter reconnaissance and attack mission across night and over ocean. He was cleared for night carrier operations. It is believed that his aircraft in the Rabaul days was dyed in pink with more than 60 shot-down marks and was well known. The nickname is the strongest Zero Fighter pilot .

The Allied Occupation Forces searched for war criminals in the Japanese Officer Corps. Iwamoto was summoned twice for questioning to Douglas MacArthur\u2019s Allied GHQ office in Tokyo. Although he managed to avoid being declared a war criminal, he was nevertheless blacklisted from public sector employment. Managers of nongovernmental businesses and local factories in his hometown also did not dare to employ him, in order to comply with the wishes of the new Allied GHQ. In general, anyone who had been an officer in the IJA or IJN was disliked by the Allied Occupation Forces.\n\n253 Ku at Truk, 29 April 1944. Front row, extreme left, Tetsuzo Iwamoto. Image Source: http://www.tumblr.com\n\nHis wife knew him as a \u201cwartime ace pilot\u201d, and in fact was a fan who later married through matchmaking agency. He very methodically kept all records. Japanese journalists who had promoted Japanese militarism campaign during the war started a radio program of anti-militarism postwar called Shin-Jitsu wa K\u014d Da (\u201cThe Truth Is This\u201d). The program considered people such as Iwamoto the cat\u2019s-paws of militarism. Iwamoto struggled to survive until the San Francisco Peace Conference was held, after which, in the spring of 1952, the Allied Occupation Forces finally left Japan. In 1952, Iwamoto finally obtained employment at the Masuda spinning mill of Daiwa B\u014dseki (since renamed to \u201cDaiwab\u014d\u201d Co., Ltd).\n\nDeath Due Medical Complications\n\nIn the summer of 1953, Iwamoto developed a stomach ache. A surgeon examined him and diagnosed enteritis. It was found later to be appendicitis. After a series of operations, he complained of a backache. Doctors decided to operate on him again. For reasons which are not entirely clear, the surgical team decided to remove three or four ribs without anesthesia. This led to sepsis. Iwamoto died on 20 May 1955, at the age of just 38 years old. His wife recalled his final words: \u201cWhen I get well, I want to fly again.\u201d\n\nMitsubishi A6M Zero\n\nA light and nimble fighter, the Mitsubishi A6M Zero was the first carrier based fighter capable of besting its land based opponents, and was Japan\u2019s main fighter of WWII. The Zero\u2019s design sacrificed protection for speed, maneuverability, and long range, on the theory that superior speed and maneuverability were protections in their own right, with long range an added bonus. The A6M came as a shock to Allied pilots when first encountered, because it could outmaneuver every airplane it faced at the time. A better dogfighter than anything the Allies had at the start of the Pacific War, the Zero\u2019s superior performance, especially in the hands of Japan\u2019s elite naval aviators, exceeded anything the Allies had hitherto expected from the Japanese. In the war\u2019s early days, Japanese naval aviators flying Zeroes achieved a 12:1 kill ratio.\n\nMitsubishi A6M Zero. Image Source: aviation-history.com\n\nTo counter the Zero\u2019s advantages, American pilots adopted team work tactics such as the \u201cThach Weave\u201d which required pilot pairs to work in tandem, or the \u201cBoom and Zoom\u201d, in which American pilots engaged the Zero only in diving attacks, as the acceleration of their heavier planes in a dive allowed them to flee if the diving attack failed. While holding considerable advantages in maneuverability and speed, the Zero\u2019s lack of protection for either the pilot or the fuel tanks proved a steadily mounting disadvantage as the war progressed, since the heavier and more rugged American fighters could absorb considerable punishment from Zeroes, while a single machine gun burst from the American plane could disintegrate a Zero.\n\nGrumman F6F Hellcat. Image Source: warhistoryonline.com\n\nBy 1943, attrition had thinned the ranks of Japan\u2019s elite aviators, and the Japanese Navy\u2019s training pipeline could not produce enough replacements of similar caliber. As a result, there were fewer and fewer Japanese pilots capable of extracting the most out of the Zero\u2019s advantages while minimizing its disadvantages. Which was bad news for the Japanese, as the quality of American aviators was increasing, due to wartime experience as well as an extensive training program that produced capable aviators at a rate Japan could not match. That was exacerbated by the introduction of new American fighters, such as the F4U Corsair and the F6F Hellcat, that were a significant improvement over their predecessors, and proved more than a match for the Zero, with greater firepower, armor, speed, and similar maneuverability.\n\nImage Source: cs.finescale.com\n\nBy 1944 the Zero was rapidly becoming obsolete, but it remained in front line service because the Japanese faced production difficulties in fielding a replacement. From its heyday at war\u2019s beginning when it ruled the skies of the Pacific while flown by elite pilots, A6Ms were reduced by war\u2019s end to flying kamikaze missions under the controls of barely trained novices.\n\nList of Japanese Navy Air Force aces Mitsubishi A6M \u201cZero\u201d\n\nThis is a list of Imperial Navy Air aces flying the Mitsubishi Zero fighter during the Pacific War.\n\nTetsuzo Iwamoto: 94 (including 14 in China / personal diary accounts for a total of 202 kills)\n\nShoichi Sugita: 70 (some sources say 80)\n\nSabur\u014d Sakai: 64 (2 in China)\n\nTakeo Okumura: 54 (4 in China)\n\nHiroyoshi Nishizawa: 36 official (102 claimed)\n\nToshio Ohta: 34\n\nKazuo Sugino: 32\n\nJunichi Sasai: 27\n\nSito Origami: 10 (9 in China, 1 disputed)\n\nToshiyuki Sueda: 9\n\nSh\u014dichi Sugita.

This system differed from the scoring system used by the U.S. Navy Air Force and U.S. Marine Air Force during World War II. Dr. Izawa and Professor Hata estimated the figure at about 80 or more than 87 in their research work in January 1971. In December 1993 Izawa wrote that Iwamoto was virtually the top ace of the IJNAF, .[4]\n\nAs of mid-1944, there remained only two IJNAF fighter pilots who were credited with over 100 victories. Depending on various totals cited, Tetsuz\u014d Iwamoto or Hiroyoshi Nishizawa was Japan's best ace. Iwamoto was known as the Ch\u016btai leader (Flying Company, Squadron of 8 to 16 fighters). Iwamoto was one of few survivors of the IJNAF from the early part of the second world war. He fought over the Indian and the Pacific Ocean from north to south, and trained his young pilots even in the last months of the war.[5]\n\nEarly life\n\nTetsuzo was the third son of the Iwamoto family. He was born on a border town, southern part of Karafuto 15 June 1916, later grew up in Sapporo, Hokkaid\u014d, Japan. He enjoyed skiing in his elementary school days. When he lived in Sapporo, his father was a chief police officer.\n\nWhen he was 13, his father retired and Tetsuzo moved with his family to his father's hometown, Masuda, Shimane prefecture. He studied at the Prefectural Masuda Agricultural and Forestry High School. His favorite school subjects were mathematics and geometry; in these subjects, he always scored A's on his school report.\n\nHe was an active and nimble boy. He joined a school club brass band as a trumpeter. Another hobby was growing plants and flowers. He helped local fishermen in the fishing season, going out to the sandy beach early in the morning and driving fish into the nets. He talked down to his teachers sometimes in discussions, which was very impolite for a school student in pre-war Japan. He was regarded as the most opinionated student in his school.\n\nStarting military career\n\nIwamoto started his military career in 1934 after he graduated the school at 18. Following the advice from his parents to study while young, Tetsuzo left for a large city where he was supposed to take a college entrance examination. He, however, secretly applied for and passed the examination for acceptance as an Imperial Japanese naval airman 4th class, and was promoted to 3rd class 5 months later. His parents were very disappointed, for they became reliant upon Tetsuzo rather than his eldest brother, who was already studying at some university in a large city and would not return to Masuda.[6]\n\nIn 1936, when he was a naval mechanic 2nd class and a crewman on the light aircraft carrier Ry\u016bj\u014d, he studied hard and passed the difficult IJNAF exam, taken by thousands of applicants. He was enrolled in the class 34th Soju-Renshusei (Soren means flight trainee program) for naval petty officers and sailors. He graduated as one of the select 26 young aviators of the class 34th Soju-Renshusei (flight trainee program) in December of that year.\n\nOn April 4, 1936, he was sent to Kasumigaura-Ku (Kasumigaura FR(AG)) as a probationer in the class 34th Sojyu-Renshusei (flight trainee program), then on April 28, formally joined Kasumigaura-Ku. While his training going on November 1, 1936, he was promoted to naval mechanic 1st class. Finally on December 26, he graduated 34th class of Sojyu-Renshusei, was promoted to airman 1st class (old rank name of pre-war Japan, equivalent to senior airman). During flight training school at the Tomobe branch of Kasumigaura-Ku (Kasumigaura FR(AG)), his fighter course instructor was the well-known Chitoshi Isozaki.\n\nIn December 1936. Iwamoto entered Saeki K\u014dk\u016btai (a K\u014dk\u016btai was a Naval Air Group, whether being based at land or on board a carrier) for 6 months of advanced training (termed extended education), finished and next entered Omura K\u014dk\u016btai on July 16, 1937. He had hard training there every day from senior pilots including Air Petty Officer 1st class Toshio Kuroiwa (rank grade was at that time), who was the IJNAF legendary dogfight master pilot. Tetsuzo Iwamoto (called Tetsu in short from his senior pilots) had to wait for his debut until February 10, 1938.\n\nChina front\n\nTetsuzo's ability as a fighter pilot was recognized by all on his first air mission with the 13th Flying Group on February 25, 1938 over Nanchang, China.\n\nAfter combat training, on February 10, 1938, Tetsuzo Iwamoto was led by his leader APO 1/C Toshio Kuroiwa, flying for two and a quarter hours over the China Sea from Omura Airbase at Ky\u016bsh\u016b Japan to the airfield outside of Nanjing China.\n\nHis squadron on the Chinese frontline was the 13th Flying Group Fighter Squadron. This Flying Group was highly regarded and was famed as the Nango Fighter Squadron, named after its former squadron leader, Mochifumi Nango, who had showed considerable courage and conspicuous leadership.\n\nIwamoto's first combat came on February 25, 1938 over Nanchang. His squadron's fighters escorted bombers Type 96 land-based attack aircraft. Chinese's fighters attacked, and the squadron's leader Lieutenant Takuma was lost on this mission.\n\nIwamoto described his first combat in his notes. During the escort mission, his squadron was intercepted by sixteen I-15s and I-16s at an altitude of 5000 meters. Iwamoto claimed 4 victories (1 probable) in the combat. He secured his first victory by firing when within 50m of the enemy fighter. He first saw white smoke, then the enemy burned up and crashed. He was then at an altitude of 4000 m. When he looked back, there was an enemy fighter just behind him. He instantly made a Split S maneuver and narrowly escaped.\n\nHe got his second victory against an I-15. He saw it below him, turned and attacked from its 6 o'clock high. When it was hit, it climbed sharply and went spinning downward out of control and crashed into the ground. He kept his altitude of 4,000 m. He got an I-16 at the top of its roll in his gunsight and fired a burst, its engine burning and out of control; Tetsuzo lost sight of it before it crashed, and he reported this as probable. Another I-15 came down to him from 12 o'clock ahead. Both made a climb and were soon in a dogfight. The I-15 tried to break free of him and made a straight dive. That action made it easier for Tetsuzo to aim. He downed this I-15 on farmland near the airfield. He was flying at an altitude of 2000 m.\n\nAbove him, many enemy fighters were maneuvering. He found one of them coming down with landing gear down. He chased it to an altitude of 200 m and fired a burst. The I-16 was surprised and made a split S maneuver, but crashed at a corner of the airfield. This was his 4th victory.\n\nAnti-aircraft guns started firing heavily, and he found himself in an intense barrage of flak. Rushing to escape at full throttle with a number of enemy fighters behind him, he succeeded in returning safely from the battlefield. His leader Kuroiwa had already returned to the Wuhu airfield, Anhui China, waiting for his return. Kuroiwa scolded Tetsu severely for the rash attacks he made on the day.\n\nThe 13th Flying Group Fighter Squadron was merged with the 12th Fighter Squadron on March 22, 1938, where Type 96 carrier fighters for 1st Chutai had landing gear painted in red and were called Red legs squadron (2nd Chutai in had gear painted in blue amd were called Blue legs squadron.\n\nIwamoto was awarded the citation of flying group Cmdr Tsukahara for his extreme courage and conspicuous gallantry in action above and beyond the call of duty as a fighter pilot against intense Chinese air force on April 29, 1938. He made 82 sorties and 14 victories credited in the China front. Tetsuzo Iwamoto became the top IJNAF ace. His activities subsequently earned him Order of the Golden Kite - 5th class recommendation in 1940.\n\nIn September 1938, 22 years old Iwamoto was ordered back to Japan, where he became a member of the Saiki Air Group and appointed to a training staff.\n\nHis flight log\n\nFlying Technique: Class-A of IJNAF Flght hours: over 8,000hrs on March 1944 (net hours, not tripled as U.S.A. single-seated fighter pilot. It was very unusual among IJNAF,[7] IJAAF[8] fighter pilots, although it was usual over 10,000 flying hours among the multi-seated aircraft IJNAF, IJAAF veteran pilots.) Oceanic Transition: possible, navigating and leading his fighter chutai (without Radar) Instrument Flight: possible Night Flight: possible Single-seat Fighter renaissance and attack mission across night ocean: possible Night landing: possible with simple approach lighting system Night carrier landing: possible with approach path indicator lights\n\nOnly experienced fighter pilots in the IJNAF could execute instrument flight with their single-seat fighter aircraft on combat missions; few IJNAF officer pilots could fly on instruments.\n\nHis tactics\n\nSingle to single dogfight tactic - from losing to winning [9]\n\nQuick roll (Roll Sempoh) (up and down quick roll tactic, skidding sideway (sudden decelerate) within 1/2 quick roll to forward the opponent aircraft on one's tail and get tail shot position of it. Cmdr Takeo SHIBATA promoted, his men developed and taught him.[10]) Coke-screw loop (Hineri-Komi Sempoh) (short-cut or twist-in loop tactic, skidding loop. Lieutenant Isamu MOCHIZUKI's special, Section leader and Warrant Officer Toshio KUROIWA trained him.[11]) Yo-yo turn (Suichoku-Senkai Kasoku Sempoh) (Lt. JG Sadaaki AKAMATSU's special at China front.[12] )\n\nFormation tactics -\n\nTwo groups linked formation attack one section plays offence, zooming and diving formation attack, another section plays defense, positioned on the higher altitude to cover and support the offence section. Keeping his groups underneath thick clouds to hide his formation and waiting until the small number of opponent aircraft group coming down, then diving and zooming attack with all in formation. Attacking the opponent groups after their mission over and on the way to the waiting circle, in a group to fly back across the distance range over the sea. This tactics was taken when his group had much less number of aircraft.\n\nNo.3 Areal Bomb attack tactic[13] -\n\nTwelve o'clock high vertical dive attack from the front top in inverted flight (Haimen Suichoku Kohka Sempoh) Almost vertical diving (about 60 degree) attack because the 30kg No.3 Areal Bomb needs the releasing speed over 280knot/h to work timer correctly for 1st small explosion. Inverted flight at the starting point because Zero Fighter could not keep steep angle while diving due to its excellent flight stability.\n\nVictories\n\nChina Front, Feb.1938 - Sep.1938\n\n14 victories: I-15, I-16 (citation as the IJNAF top ace)\n\nWorld War II, Pacific Front and Indian Front, 8 December 1941 - 15 August 1945\n\n228 aerial victories: victories - 202 shared victories - 26\n\nunconfirmed - 27 damaged - 2 destroyed on the ground - 2\n\nAircraft types he confronted\n\n(World War II, 8 December 1941 - July 1942, April 1943 - 15 August 1945, Allied U.S. Army, Navy, Marine, Royal Navy, Australia, New Zealand)[14]\n\nF4F victories - 7 (Coral Sea, 8 May 1942; Rabaul, late 1943 - 10AM 19 Feb.1944 the escort fighters of Martin flying boat)\n\nP-38 victories - 4 (Rabaul, late 1943-1944)\n\nF4U victories - 48; unconfirmed 1 (Rabaul, late 1943 - Feb. 1944; Mobara-airbase outskirts of Tokyo, Japan, February 16, 1945; Operation Kikusui (Imperial Chrysanthemum on the Water - divine wind), Okinawa, March 10 - June 24, 1945).

He was summoned twice to Douglas MacArthur's Allied GHQ office in Tokyo. Though he avoided being declared a war criminal, he was blacklisted for public sector employment. Managers of nongovernmental businesses and local factories in his hometown also did not dare to employ him, in order to comply with the wishes of the new Allied GHQ. Those who had been officers in the IJA or IJN were disliked by the Allied Occupation Forces.\n\nJapanese journalists who had promoted Japanese militarism campaign during the war started a radio program of anti-militarism postwar called \"\"Shin-Jitsu wa Kou da (The Truth Is This)\"\". People like Iwamoto were considered the cat's-paws of militarism there.\n\nIwamoto struggled to survive until the San Francisco Peace Conference was held and the Allied Occupation Forces left Japan in the spring of 1952. In 1952, he finally obtained employment at the Masuda spinning mill of Daiwa Bouseki (now renamed as \"Daiwabo\" Co., Ltd, \u5927\u548c\u7d21\u7e3e ). However, in summer 1953, he developed a stomach ache. A surgeon examined him and diagnosed enteritis. It was found later to be appendicitis.\n\nAfter a series of operations, he complained of a backache. Doctors decided to operate on him again. With cause unknown, they removed three or four ribs without anesthesia. This led to sepsis (septicemia, blood poisoning).\n\nHis wife recalled his words, \"When I get well, I want to fly again.\" He died on 20 May 1955.[citation needed]\n\nNotes\n\n\u2191 Dr. Yasuho Izawa, 1993, Gekitsui Oh To Kuusen (Ace and Combat), Kohjin-sha \u2191 pp.127-136, Ryunosuke Kusaka,IJN Grand Fleet \u2191 BAA BAA BLACK SHEEP The general attack to smash Rabaul fortress with all Allied air units continued 17 Dec.1943-Mar.1944. ch.9, Gregory Boyington The general attack to smash Rabaul fortress with all Allied air units continued 17 Dec.1943-Mar.1944. \u2191 pp.171-268, Izawa, Hata, 1971, Nippon Kaigun SentouKi Tai, Kanto-sha; pp62 - 63, Izawa, 1993, Nippon Riku-Kaigun Ace Retsuden(IJAF and IJNAF Aces), Kojin-sha \u2191 p.470, Saburo Abe, Zero Fighter Pilots Association, 2004, \"My combat against Spitfires on VJ-day\", ZeroSen, Kaku Tatakaeri!, Bunshun-Nesco; pp.248-249, Toshio Hijikata, 2004, Kaigun Yobi-Gakusei Zero-Sen KuuSen-Ki (Air combat note of an IJNAF reserved student officer Zero fighter pilot), Kohjin-sha \u2191 Mrs. Iwamoto's postscript within Zerosen Gekitsui-Oh(Zero fighter ace) \u2191 IJNAF: Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force \u2191 IJAAF: Imperial Japanese Army Air Force \u2191 p.127, p.141, p.305 Tetsuzo Iwamoto, 1973.

He joined a school club brass band as a trumpeter. Another hobby was growing plants and flowers. He helped local fishermen in the fishing season, going out to the sandy beach early in the morning and driving fish into the nets. He talked down to his teachers sometimes in discussions, which was very impolite for a school student in pre-war Japan. He was regarded as the most opinionated student in his school.\n\nStarting military career\n\nIwamoto started his military career in 1934 after he graduated the school at 18. Following the advice from his parents to study while young, Tetsuzo left for a large city where he was supposed to take a college entrance examination. He, however, secretly applied for and passed the examination for acceptance as an Imperial Japanese naval airman 4th class, and was promoted to 3rd class 5 months later. His parents were very disappointed, for they became reliant upon Tetsuzo rather than his eldest brother, who was already studying at some university in a large city and would not return to Masuda.\n\nIn 1936, when he was a naval mechanic 2nd class and a crewman on the light aircraft carrier Ry\u016bj\u014d, he studied hard and passed the difficult IJNAS exam, taken by thousands of applicants. He was enrolled in the class 34th Soju-Renshusei (Soren means flight trainee program) for naval petty officers and sailors. He graduated as one of the select 26 young aviators of the class 34th Soju-Renshusei (flight trainee program) in December of that year.\n\nOn April 4, 1936, he was sent to Kasumigaura-Ku (Kasumigaura FR(AG)) as a probationer in the class 34th Sojyu-Renshusei (flight trainee program), then on April 28, formally joined Kasumigaura-Ku. While his training going on November 1, 1936, he was promoted to naval mechanic 1st class. Finally on December 26, he graduated 34th class of Sojyu-Renshusei, was promoted to airman 1st class (old rank name of pre-war Japan, equivalent to senior airman). During flight training school at the Tomobe branch of Kasumigaura-Ku (Kasumigaura FR(AG)), his fighter course instructor was the well-known Chitoshi Isozaki.\n\nIn December 1936. Iwamoto entered Saeki K\u014dk\u016btai (a K\u014dk\u016btai was a Naval Air Group, whether being based at land or on board a carrier) for 6 months of advanced training (termed extended education), finished and next entered Omura K\u014dk\u016btai on July 16, 1937. He had hard training there every day from senior pilots including Air Petty Officer 1st class Toshio Kuroiwa (rank grade was at that time), who was the IJNAS legendary dogfight master pilot. Tetsuzo Iwamoto (called Tetsu in short from his senior pilots) had to wait for his debut until February 10, 1938.\n\nChina front\n\nTetsuzo's ability as a fighter pilot was recognized by all on his first air mission with the 13th Flying Group on February 25, 1938, over Nanchang, China.\n\nAfter combat training, on February 10, 1938, Tetsuz\u014d Iwamoto was led by his leader APO 1/C Toshio Kuroiwa, flying for two and a quarter hours over the China Sea from Omura Airbase at Ky\u016bsh\u016b Japan to the airfield outside of Nanjing China.\n\nHis squadron on the Chinese frontline was the 13th Flying Group Fighter Squadron. This Flying Group was highly regarded and was famed as the Nango Fighter Squadron, named after its former squadron leader, Mochifumi Nango, who had showed considerable courage and conspicuous leadership.\n\nIwamoto's first combat came on February 25, 1938, over Nanchang. His squadron's fighters escorted bombers Type 96 land-based attack aircraft. Chinese fighters attacked, and the squadron's leader Lieutenant Takuma was lost on this mission.\n\nIwamoto described his first combat in his notes. During the escort mission, his squadron was intercepted by sixteen I-15s and I-16s at an altitude of 5000 meters. Iwamoto claimed 4 victories (1 probable) in the combat. He secured his first victory by firing when within 50m of the enemy fighter. He first saw white smoke, then the enemy burned up and crashed. He was then at an altitude of 4000 m. When he looked back, there was an enemy fighter just behind him. He instantly made a Split S maneuver and narrowly escaped.\n\nHe got his second victory against an I-15. He saw it below him, turned and attacked from its 6 o'clock high. When it was hit, it climbed sharply and went spinning downward out of control and crashed into the ground. He kept his altitude of 4,000 m. He got an I-16 at the top of its roll in his gunsight and fired a burst, its engine burning and out of control; Tetsuzo lost sight of it before it crashed, and he reported this as probable. Another I-15 came down to him from 12 o'clock ahead. Both made a climb and were soon in a dogfight. The I-15 tried to break free of him and made a straight dive. That action made it easier for Tetsuzo to aim. He downed this I-15 on farmland near the airfield. He was flying at an altitude of 2000 m.\n\nAbove him, many enemy fighters were maneuvering. He found one of them coming down with landing gear down. He chased it to an altitude of 200 m and fired a burst. The I-16 was surprised and made a split S maneuver, but crashed at a corner of the airfield. This was his 4th victory.\n\nAnti-aircraft guns started firing heavily, and he found himself in an intense barrage of flak. Rushing to escape at full throttle with a number of enemy fighters behind him, he succeeded in returning safely from the battlefield. His leader Kuroiwa had already returned to the Wuhu airfield, Anhui China, waiting for his return. Kuroiwa scolded Tetsu severely for the rash attacks he made on the day.\n\nThe 13th Flying Group Fighter Squadron was merged with the 12th Fighter Squadron on March 22, 1938, where Type 96 carrier fighters for 1st Chutai had landing gear painted in red and were called Red legs squadron while 2nd Chutai had gear painted in blue and were called Blue legs squadron.\n\nIwamoto was awarded the citation of flying group Cmdr Tsukahara for his extreme courage and conspicuous gallantry in action above and beyond the call of duty as a fighter pilot against intense Chinese air force on April 29, 1938. He made 82 sorties and 14 victories credited in the China front. Tetsuz\u014d Iwamoto became the top IJNAS ace. His activities subsequently earned him Order of the Golden Kite \u2013 5th class recommendation in 1940.\n\nIn September 1938, 22-year-old Iwamoto was ordered back to Japan, where he became a member of the Saiki Air Group and appointed to a training staff.\n\nHis flight log\n\nFlying Technique: Class-A of IJNAS Flight hours: over 8,000 hrs in March 1944 (net hours, not tripled as with a US single-seated fighter pilot. It was very unusual among IJNAS, IJAAS fighter pilots, although it was usual over 10,000 flying hours among the multi-seated aircraft IJNAS, IJAAS veteran pilots.) Oceanic Transition: possible, navigating and leading his fighter chutai (without Radar) Instrument Flight: possible Night Flight: possible Single-seat Fighter reconnaissance and attack mission across night ocean: possible Night landing: possible with simple approach lighting system Night carrier landing: possible with approach path indicator lights\n\nOnly experienced fighter pilots in the IJNAS could execute instrument flight with their single-seat fighter aircraft on combat missions; few IJNAS officer pilots could fly on instruments.\n\nTactics\n\nSingle to single dogfight tactic \u2013 from losing to winning\n\nQuick roll (Roll Senp\u014d) (up and down quick roll tactic, skidding sideway (sudden decelerate) within 1/2 quick roll to forward the opponent aircraft on one's tail and get tail shot position of it. Cmdr Takeo Shibata promoted, his men developed and taught him.) Corkscrew loop (Hineri-Komi Senp\u014d) (short-cut or twist-in loop tactic, skidding loop. Lieutenant Isamu Mochizuki's special, Section leader and Warrant Officer Toshio Kuroiwa trained him.) Yo-yo turn (Suichoku-Senkai Kasoku Senp\u014d) (Lt. JG Sadaaki Akamatsu's special at China front. )\n\nFormation tactics \u2013\n\nTwo groups linked formation attack one section plays offence, zooming and diving formation attack, another section plays defense, positioned on the higher altitude to cover and support the offence section. Keeping his groups underneath thick clouds to hide his formation and waiting until the small number of opponent aircraft group coming down, then diving and zooming attack with all in formation. Attacking the opponent groups after their mission over and on the way to the waiting circle, in a group to fly back across the distance range over the sea. This tactics was taken when his group had much fewer aircraft.\n\nNo.3 Aerial Bomb attack tactic \u2013\n\nTwelve o'clock high vertical dive attack from the front top in inverted flight (Haimen Suichoku K\u014dka Senp\u014d) Almost vertical diving (about 60 degree) attack because the 30 kg No. 3 Aerial Bomb needs the releasing speed over 280 knots to work timer correctly for 1st small explosion. Inverted flight at the starting point because Zero Fighter could not keep steep angle while diving due to its excellent flight stability.\n\nAerial victories claimed in his diary\n\n(World War II, 8 December 1941 \u2013 July 1942, April 1943 \u2013 15 August 1945, Allied U.S. Army, Navy, Marine, Royal Navy, Australia, New Zealand)\n\nF4F victories \u2013 7 (Coral Sea, 8 May 1942; Rabaul, late 1943 \u2013 10AM 19 February 1944 the escort fighters of Martin flying boat)\n\nP-38 victories \u2013 4 (Rabaul, late 1943 \u2013 1944)\n\nF4U victories \u2013 48; unconfirmed 1 (Rabaul, late 1943 \u2013 February 1944; Mobara-airbase outskirts of Tokyo, Japan, February 16, 1945; Operation Kikusui (Imperial Chrysanthemum on the Water \u2013 divine wind), Okinawa, March 10 \u2013 June 24, 1945).

Iwamoto was summoned twice for questioning to Douglas MacArthur's Allied GHQ office in Tokyo. Although he managed to avoid being declared a war criminal, he was nevertheless blacklisted from public sector employment. Managers of nongovernmental businesses and local factories in his hometown also did not dare to employ him, in order to comply with the wishes of the new Allied GHQ. In general, anyone who had been an officer in the IJA or IJN was disliked by the Allied Occupation Forces.\n\nJapanese journalists who had promoted Japanese militarism campaign during the war started a radio program of anti-militarism postwar called Shin-Jitsu wa K\u014d Da (\"The Truth Is This\"). The program considered people such as Iwamoto the cat's-paws of militarism.\n\nIwamoto struggled to survive until the San Francisco Peace Conference was held, after which, in the spring of 1952, the Allied Occupation Forces finally left Japan.\n\nIn 1952, Iwamoto finally obtained employment at the Masuda spinning mill of Daiwa B\u014dseki (since renamed to \"Daiwab\u014d\" Co., Ltd, \u5927\u548c\u7d21\u7e3e ).\n\nIn the summer of 1953, Iwamoto developed a stomach ache. A surgeon examined him and diagnosed enteritis. It was found later to be appendicitis. After a series of operations, he complained of a backache. Doctors decided to operate on him again. For reasons which are not entirely clear, the surgical team decided to remove three or four ribs without anesthesia. This led to sepsis.\n\nIwamoto died on 20 May 1955, at the age of just 38 years old. His wife recalled his final words: \"When I get well, I want to fly again.\"\n\nMovie"}, {"url": "https://www.inaf-go.org/iwamoto/", "page_content": "Year Age Events\n\n1902 0 On February 5, 1902, Kaoru Iwamoto was born in Takatsu, Masuda City, Shimane prefecture.\n\n1905 3 Moved to Busan, Korea with his parents.\n\n1911 9 Learned Go from his father.\n\n1913 11 Returned to Japan to become a disciple of Hirose Heijiro 6-dan of Houensha in Tokyo.\n\n1917 15 Achieved 1-dan.\n\n1918 16 Visited China with Hirose Heijiro.\n\n1919 17 Achieved 2-dan.\n\n1920 18 Achieved 3-dan.\n\n1922 20 Achieved 4-dan.\n\n1923 21 Visited Taipei.\n\n1924 22 Nihon Kiiin was established and he joined it.\n\n1925 23 Achieved 5-dan.\n\n1926 24 Achieved 6-dan and visited China.\n\n1927 25 Married Karasawa Kikue.\n\n1929 27 Retired as a professional Go player and emigrated to Brazil.\n\n1931 29 Came back to Japan and resumed his Go career and visited China.\n\n1935 33 Elected to the board of directors of Nihon Ki-in.

Peter Chen\n\nww2dbaseTetsuzo Iwamoto was born in Karafuto Prefecture, Japan (now southern Sakhalin Island). He grew up in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan after his father was appointed the chief of police of that city. In 1929, his father retired, and the whole family moved to his father's home town, Masuda, Shimane Prefecture, Japan, where he studied at the Masuda Agricultural and Forestry High School. In 1934, upon graduating high school, he was sent to a large city to take the college entrance exams, but instead he applied for and passed the exam for the air arm of the Japanese navy. In 1936, he served aboard carrier Ryujo with the rating of mechanic 2nd class. He began flight training on 28 Apr 1936. On 1 Nov 1936, he was promoted to the rating of mechanic 1st class. On 26 Dec, he graduated from the program and was promoted to airman 1st class. He was assigned to the Saeki Air Group for six months of advanced training, and then was transferred to the Omura Naval Air Group on 16 Jul 1937.\n\nww2dbaseOn 10 Feb 1938, Iwamoto was transferred to the front lines as he flew from Omura Airfield near Nagasaki, Japan to Nanjing, China, thus beginning his career in WW2. With the 13th Flying Group's fighter squadron in China, his first combat mission took place on 25 Feb over Nanchang, China as he escorted Type 96 attack aircraft. The flight was attacked by 16 Chinese fighters. During the dogfight, Iwamoto claimed 3 confirmed and 1 probable kills, but was scolded after he returned for his overly-aggressive actions. On 22 Mar 1938, the 13th Flying Group's fighter squadron was merged with the 12th Fighter Squadron. On 29 Apr 1938, he fought Chinese Air Force fighters and scored several victories, and was later awarded a citation by Commander Tsukahara. He was ordered back to Japan in Sep 1938; at this point, he had 14 kills on his records and was one of the aces among Japanese airmen in China.\n\nww2dbaseBack in Japan, Iwamoto served as a member of the Saiki Air Group as a trainer. In 1940, he was awarded the Order of the Golden Kite 5th Class. During the Pacific War, he was initially a pilot with the carrier Zuikaku from Dec 1941 to May 1942, during which time he participated in the Battle of the Coral Sea. In late 1943, he was sent to Rabaul, New Britain. In 1944, he was successively transferred to Truk Atoll in the Caroline Islands and then the Philippine Islands. In Oct 1944, he was promoted to the rank of ensign. During the Okinawa Campaign, he participated in Operation Kikusui. His own diary claimed that he had downed 202 aircraft during the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War while sharing credit with others for another 26 kills; this translated to somewhere between 80 and 90 kills based on the scoring system used by American airmen during WW2.\n\nww2dbaseAfter the war, Iwamoto was summoned for several interviews and interrogations by the Allied administration. Although he was eventually cleared and thus not declared a war criminal, he was still unable to get a job due to potential employers wishing to please the occupation administration. In 1952, the Allied occupation gave control of Japan back to the Japanese people, and he was finally able to get a job at a local spinning mill. In the summer of 1953, he underwent a series of surgeries for enteritis (mis-diagnosed) and appendicitis (actual cause of stomach pains). Shortly after, he complained of back pains and received another surgery. He passed away in his home town of Masuda after getting septicemia after the final surgery. According to his wife, his last words were \"[w]hen I get well, I want to fly again\".\n\nww2dbaseSource: Wikipedia.\n\nLast Major Revision: Jan 2010\n\nTetsuzo Iwamoto Timeline\n\nPhotographs"}, {"url": "https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/523455-first-ai-to-beat-a-9-dan-professional-go-player", "page_content": "Between 9\u201315 March 2016, a largely self-taught Go-playing AI called AlphaGo (developed by British AI developers DeepMind) defeated Lee Sedol (KOR) 4\u20131 in a five-game series. This is the first time a 9-dan professional (the highest rank in Go) has been defeated by a computer program of any kind.\n\nBefore AlphaGo, it was generally assumed that it would be a decade before computers could challenge skilled Go players, let alone beat 9 dan professionals. This is because Go is resistant to the sort of \"brute force\" analysis that had been employed by computers against games like tic-tac-toe and, most famously, chess.\n\nA brute-force game-playing program works by calculating every possible move in a given situation, then every possible response to it, then every possible response to that, and so on \u2013 often looking many moves ahead of the current state of play. It then applies a few relatively simple rules (considerations about the value of pieces or the importance of different sectors of the board, for example) to decide which of these possibilities to pick.\n\nThis is not a practical approach for Go because there are so many possibilities in any given situation \u2013 looking more than a move or two ahead would require the computer to calculate and assess an almost infinite number of potential outcomes.\n\nThe developers at DeepMind used a totally different approach called Deep Reinforcement Learning to create their Go-playing AI. AlphaGo was shown information about tens of thousands of past Go matches, which it then analysed using neural networks. One neural network decided where on the board to play based on moves used in winning games and the other evaluated how likely it would be to win based on that move. This meant that AlphaGo developed strategies it hadn\u2019t seen in human games, performing moves that went against centuries of established Go wisdom. AlphaGo\u2019s capacity for intuitive and creative play stunned many commentators. Speaking after his own defeat in May 2016, Ke Jie (the world's top ranked Go player at the time) remarked, \"After humanity spent thousands of years improving our tactics, computers tell us that humans are completely wrong... I would go as far as to say not a single human has touched the edge of the truth of Go.\""}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Tetsuz%C5%8D-Iwamoto", "page_content": "As of mid-1944, there remained only two IJNAF fighter pilots who were credited with over 100 victories. Depending on various totals cited, Tetsuz\u014d Iwamoto or Hiroyoshi Nishizawa was Japan's top ace. Iwamoto was known as the Ch\u016btai leader (Flying Company, squadron of 8 to 16 fighters). Iwamoto was one of few survivors of the IJNAF from the early part of the Second World War. He fought over the Indian and the Pacific Ocean from north to south, and trained young pilots even in the last months of the war. Like many Japanese veterans, Iwamoto was reported to have fallen into depression after the war. His diary was found after his death, with claims of 202 Allied aircraft destroyed.\n\nIwamoto was one of the highest-scoring Japanese aces. As a result of the Japanese use of the British naval practices, the IJNAF scoring system was based on the system the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force (RAF) adopted from World War I until World War II . This system differed from the scoring system used by some other nations during World War II. Research by academics surnamed Izawa and Hata in 1971 estimated his score at about 80 or more than 87. In December 1993 Izawa wrote that Iwamoto was virtually the top ace of the IJNAF.\n\nSubsequent assignments were Truk Atoll in the Carolines and the Philippines , being commissioned an ensign in October 1944. Following the evacuation of the Philippines, Iwamoto served in home defense and trained kamikaze pilots.\n\nIn late 1943, Iwamoto's air group was sent to Rabaul, New Britain, resulting in three months of air combat against Allied air raids.\n\nLieutenant Junior Grade Tetsuz\u014d Iwamoto (\u5ca9\u672c \u5fb9\u4e09, Iwamoto Tetsuz\u014d ) was one of the top scoring aces among Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force (IJNAF) fighter pilots. He entered the Imperial Navy in 1934 and completed pilot training in December 1936. His first combat occurred over China in early 1938. He emerged as the top ace of the Imperial Japan during WWII, credited with at least 87 aerial victories including 14 victories in China . Subsequently he flew Zeros from the aircraft carrier Zuikaku from December 1941 to May 1942, including at the Battle of the Coral Sea .\n\nEarly life\n\nTetsuzo was the third son of the Iwamoto family. He was born on a border town, southern part of Karafuto 15 June 1916, later grew up in Sapporo, Hokkaid\u014d, Japan. He enjoyed skiing in his elementary school days. When he lived in Sapporo, his father was a chief police officer.\n\nWhen he was 13, his father retired and Tetsuzo moved with his family to his father's hometown, Masuda, Shimane prefecture. He studied at the Prefectural Masuda Agricultural and Forestry High School. His favorite school subjects were mathematics and geometry; in these subjects, he always scored A's on his school report.\n\nHe was an active and nimble boy. He joined a school club brass band as a trumpeter. Another hobby was growing plants and flowers. He helped local fishermen in the fishing season, going out to the sandy beach early in the morning and driving fish into the nets. He talked down to his teachers sometimes in discussions, which was very impolite for a school student in pre-war Japan. He was regarded as the most opinionated student in his school.\n\nStarting military career\n\nIwamoto started his military career in 1934 after he graduated the school at 18. Following the advice from his parents to study while young, Tetsuzo left for a large city where he was supposed to take a college entrance examination. He, however, secretly applied for and passed the examination for acceptance as an Imperial Japanese naval airman 4th class, and was promoted to 3rd class 5 months later. His parents were very disappointed, for they became reliant upon Tetsuzo rather than his eldest brother, who was already studying at some university in a large city and would not return to Masuda.\n\nIn 1936, when he was a naval mechanic 2nd class and a crewman on the light aircraft carrier Ry\u016bj\u014d, he studied hard and passed the difficult IJNAF exam, taken by thousands of applicants. He was enrolled in the class 34th Soju-Renshusei (Soren means flight trainee program) for naval petty officers and sailors. He graduated as one of the select 26 young aviators of the class 34th Soju-Renshusei (flight trainee program) in December of that year.\n\nOn April 4, 1936, he was sent to Kasumigaura-Ku (Kasumigaura FR(AG)) as a probationer in the class 34th Sojyu-Renshusei (flight trainee program), then on April 28, formally joined Kasumigaura-Ku. While his training going on November 1, 1936, he was promoted to naval mechanic 1st class. Finally on December 26, he graduated 34th class of Sojyu-Renshusei, was promoted to airman 1st class (old rank name of pre-war Japan, equivalent to senior airman). During flight training school at the Tomobe branch of Kasumigaura-Ku (Kasumigaura FR(AG)), his fighter course instructor was the well-known Chitoshi Isozaki.\n\nIn December 1936. Iwamoto entered Saeki K\u014dk\u016btai (a K\u014dk\u016btai was a Naval Air Group, whether being based at land or on board a carrier) for 6 months of advanced training (termed extended education), finished and next entered Omura K\u014dk\u016btai on July 16, 1937. He had hard training there every day from senior pilots including Air Petty Officer 1st class Toshio Kuroiwa (rank grade was at that time), who was the IJNAF legendary dogfight master pilot. Tetsuzo Iwamoto (called Tetsu in short from his senior pilots) had to wait for his debut until February 10, 1938.\n\nChina front\n\nTetsuzo's ability as a fighter pilot was recognized by all on his first air mission with the 13th Flying Group on February 25, 1938 over Nanchang, China.\n\nAfter combat training, on February 10, 1938, Tetsuzo Iwamoto was led by his leader APO 1/C Toshio Kuroiwa, flying for two and a quarter hours over the China Sea from Omura Airbase at Ky\u016bsh\u016b Japan to the airfield outside of Nanjing China.\n\nHis squadron on the Chinese frontline was the 13th Flying Group Fighter Squadron. This Flying Group was highly regarded and was famed as the Nango Fighter Squadron, named after its former squadron leader, Mochifumi Nango, who had showed considerable courage and conspicuous leadership.\n\nIwamoto's first combat came on February 25, 1938 over Nanchang. His squadron's fighters escorted bombers Type 96 land-based attack aircraft. Chinese's fighters attacked, and the squadron's leader Lieutenant Takuma was lost on this mission.\n\nIwamoto described his first combat in his notes. During the escort mission, his squadron was intercepted by sixteen I-15s and I-16s at an altitude of 5000 meters. Iwamoto claimed 4 victories (1 probable) in the combat. He secured his first victory by firing when within 50m of the enemy fighter. He first saw white smoke, then the enemy burned up and crashed. He was then at an altitude of 4000 m. When he looked back, there was an enemy fighter just behind him. He instantly made a Split S maneuver and narrowly escaped.\n\nHe got his second victory against an I-15. He saw it below him, turned and attacked from its 6 o'clock high. When it was hit, it climbed sharply and went spinning downward out of control and crashed into the ground. He kept his altitude of 4,000 m. He got an I-16 at the top of its roll in his gunsight and fired a burst, its engine burning and out of control; Tetsuzo lost sight of it before it crashed, and he reported this as probable. Another I-15 came down to him from 12 o'clock ahead. Both made a climb and were soon in a dogfight. The I-15 tried to break free of him and made a straight dive. That action made it easier for Tetsuzo to aim. He downed this I-15 on farmland near the airfield. He was flying at an altitude of 2000 m.\n\nAbove him, many enemy fighters were maneuvering. He found one of them coming down with landing gear down. He chased it to an altitude of 200 m and fired a burst. The I-16 was surprised and made a split S maneuver, but crashed at a corner of the airfield. This was his 4th victory.\n\nAnti-aircraft guns started firing heavily, and he found himself in an intense barrage of flak. Rushing to escape at full throttle with a number of enemy fighters behind him, he succeeded in returning safely from the battlefield. His leader Kuroiwa had already returned to the Wuhu airfield, Anhui China, waiting for his return. Kuroiwa scolded Tetsu severely for the rash attacks he made on the day.\n\nThe 13th Flying Group Fighter Squadron was merged with the 12th Fighter Squadron on March 22, 1938, where Type 96 carrier fighters for 1st Chutai had landing gear painted in red and were called Red legs squadron while 2nd Chutai had gear painted in blue and were called Blue legs squadron.\n\nIwamoto was awarded the citation of flying group Cmdr Tsukahara for his extreme courage and conspicuous gallantry in action above and beyond the call of duty as a fighter pilot against intense Chinese air force on April 29, 1938. He made 82 sorties and 14 victories credited in the China front. Tetsuzo Iwamoto became the top IJNAF ace. His activities subsequently earned him Order of the Golden Kite - 5th class recommendation in 1940.\n\nIn September 1938, 22 years old Iwamoto was ordered back to Japan, where he became a member of the Saiki Air Group and appointed to a training staff.\n\nHis flight log\n\nFlying Technique: Class-A of IJNAFFlight hours: over 8,000hrs on March 1944Oceanic Transition: possible, navigating and leading his fighter chutai (without Radar)Instrument Flight: possibleNight Flight: possible\n\nOnly experienced fighter pilots in the IJNAF could execute instrument flight with their single-seat fighter aircraft on combat missions; few IJNAF officer pilots could fly on instruments.\n\nHis tactics\n\nSingle to single dogfight tactic - from losing to winning\n\nQuick roll (Roll Sempoh)Coke-screw loop (Hineri-Komi Sempoh)Yo-yo turn (Suichoku-Senkai Kasoku Sempoh)\n\nFormation tactics -\n\nTwo groups linked formation attackKeeping his groups underneath thick clouds to hide his formation and waiting until the small number of opponent aircraft group coming down, then diving and zooming attack with all in formation.Attacking the opponent groups after their mission over and on the way to the waiting circle, in a group to fly back across the distance range over the sea.

He was summoned twice to Douglas MacArthur's Allied GHQ office in Tokyo. Though he avoided being declared a war criminal, he was blacklisted for public sector employment. Managers of nongovernmental businesses and local factories in his hometown also did not dare to employ him, in order to comply with the wishes of the new Allied GHQ. Those who had been officers in the IJA or IJN were disliked by the Allied Occupation Forces.\n\nJapanese journalists who had promoted Japanese militarism campaign during the war started a radio program of anti-militarism postwar called \"\"Shin-Jitsu wa Kou da (The Truth Is This)\"\". People like Iwamoto were considered the cat's-paws of militarism there.\n\nIwamoto struggled to survive until the San Francisco Peace Conference was held and the Allied Occupation Forces left Japan in the spring of 1952. In 1952, he finally obtained employment at the Masuda spinning mill of Daiwa Bouseki (now renamed as \"Daiwabo\" Co., Ltd, \u5927\u548c\u7d21\u7e3e ). However, in summer 1953, he developed a stomach ache. A surgeon examined him and diagnosed enteritis. It was found later to be appendicitis.\n\nAfter a series of operations, he complained of a backache. Doctors decided to operate on him again. With cause unknown, they removed three or four ribs without anesthesia. This led to sepsis (septicemia, blood poisoning).\n\nHis wife recalled his words, \"When I get well, I want to fly again.\" He died on 20 May 1955.\n\nMovie\n\nNippon Eiga-sha, Feb.16, 1944, Nippon News No.194 Solomon no Gekisen Nankai-Kessenjo (means, Southern Ocean Battle Fields of Solomon)\n\nNippon Eiga-sha, Feb.2, 1944, Nippon News No.192 Rabaul (means, Fortress Rabaul)"}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Tetsuz%C5%8D-Iwamoto/6000000190527516822", "page_content": "About Tetsuz\u014d Iwamoto\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetsuz%C5%8D_Iwamoto\n\nLieutenant Junior Grade Tetsuz\u014d Iwamoto (\u5ca9\u672c \u5fb9\u4e09, Iwamoto Tetsuz\u014d, 15 June 1916 \u2013 20 May 1955) was one of the top scoring aces among Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS) fighter pilots.

During his childhood he spent several years in Busan, Korea (1905-1913), where he learned Go from his father.\n\nHe returned to Japan to study Go, moved to Tokyo, and became a disciple of Hirose Heijiro 6-dan of Hoensha in 1913. He achieved 1-dan in 1917, and swiftly rose through the ranks. In 1924, when Nihon Ki-in was established, Iwamoto joined it and achieved 6-dan.\n\nHe retired as a professional Go player and emigrated to Brazil as a coffee farmer in 1929. However, he came back to Japan and resumed his career of Go after the failure of this venture in 1931.\n\nHe won the Oteai, the most important tournament in Japan at that time) in 1935. He challenged the third Honinbo match against Hashimoto Utaro in 1945. The second game of this match, played in the outskirts of Hiroshima, is famous as the atomic bomb go game. The players owed their lives to the fact that the local police had ordered the game moved from the center of Hiroshima. The match was continued after the war but ended in a 3-3 draw. A three-game playoff was held in 1946, Iwamoto won two straight games to take the Honinbo title. He assumed the name Honinbo Kunwa.\n\nAfter the war\n\nIwamoto's home was a temporary site for the Nihon Ki-in which was burnt out by the B29 bombing in 1945 and he was instrumental in finding new headquarters for the Nihon Ki-in.\n\nIwamoto defended the Honinbo title against Kitani Minoru in 1947, and in 1948 achieved 8-dan, becoming president of the Nihon Ki-in. He later lost the Honinbo title to Hashimoto Utaro in 1950. He won the NHK Cup in 1955.\n\nIwamoto traveled extensively throughout the West with the aim of spreading Go to Western people. He spent 18 months in 1961-1962 in New York, teaching and promoting Go. He achieved 9-dan in 1967, and had many disciples, including James Kerwin, the first Westerner to achieve professional status at the Nihon Ki-in.\n\nRetirement and later life\n\nIwamoto retired in April, 1983. In his later years he was the main benefactor to several European and American Go centers in London, S\u00e3o Paulo, New York, Seattle and Amsterdam, largely through setting up the Iwamoto Foundation in 1986, with an initial contribution of 530 million yen.\n\nHe is the author of three books in English, \"Go for Beginners\", \"Keshi and Uchikomi\" and \"The 1971 Honinbo Tournament\".\n\nSensei's Library profile\n\nBirthplace & museum of Kaoru Iwamoto\n\nCOMMENTS"}], "Tetsuz\u014d Iwamoto was awarded the title of Honorary Meijin.": [{"url": "https://airpowerasia.com/2020/08/16/japanese-zero-fighter-air-ace-tetsuzo-iwamoto-tiger-tetsu-94-aerial-victories-greatest-japanese-fighter-ace-of-all-time/", "page_content": "Lieutenant Junior Grade Tetsuz\u014d Iwamoto was one of the top scoring aces among Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS) fighter pilots.

Image Source: Wikipedia\n\nAs a result of the Japanese use of the British naval practices, the IJNAS scoring system was based on the system the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force (RAF) adopted from World War I until World War II. This system differed from the scoring system used by some other nations during World War II. Tetsuzo Iwamoto was one of the greatest air aces of the Imperial Japanese Navy. During his career, as per his personal records in his diary he is supposed to have achieved 242 air victories, 14 in China, 202 confirmed in the Pacific, 26 shared victories and 27 unconfirmed victories. He is supposed to have damaged two planes and destroyed two on the ground. Research by academics surnamed Izawa and Hata in 1971 estimated his score at about 87. Irrespective of the scoring system, Tetsuz\u014d Iwamoto was the Japan\u2019s top ace. Iwamoto was known as the Ch\u016btai leader (Flying Company, squadron of 8 to 16 fighters). Iwamoto was one of few survivors of the IJNAS through the war. He fought over the Indian and the Pacific Ocean from north to south, and trained young pilots even in the last months of the war. Like many Japanese veterans, Iwamoto was reported to have fallen into depression after the war.

His activities subsequently earned him \u201cOrder of the Golden Kite \u2013 5th class\u201d recommendation in 1940. In September 1938, 22-year-old Iwamoto was ordered back to Japan, where he became a member of the Saiki Air Group and appointed to a training staff.\n\nJapanese Order of the Golden Kite, 5th Class. Image Source: warthunder.com\n\nPacific War \u2013 Pearl Harbour & Carol Sea\n\nAfter a tour as an instructor, Petty Officer First Class Iwamoto returned to the front line onboard the carrier Zuikaku, now flying the legendary A6M \u2018Zero\u2019 fighter. Iwamoto was airborne for the day of infamy \u2013 the attack on Pearl Harbor \u2013 but flew air cover over the carrier group itself rather than escorting the actual raid. Iwamoto was heavily involved in the air war in the Pacific from the outset, regularly leading flights of A6Ms against their American, British and Australian counterparts. Iwamoto flew in the violent air engagements of the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942, during which Zuikaku\u2019s air group suffered significant losses. This necessitated a return to Japan for resupply and to train replacement aircrew which resulted in Iwamoto and his comrades missing the Battle of Midway. Small team in Japan who frantically tried to train new aircrew to stem the advancing allies.\n\nLegendary A6M \u2018Zero\u2019 fighter. Image Source: warthunder.com\n\nRabaul, New Britain\n\nAfter a year of instructional duties, Chief Petty Officer Iwamoto returned to the front line and joined the 253rd Air Group, flying A6Ms from Rabaul, New Britain, in November 1943. Involved in daily air combat, the experienced fighter leader led his cadre of increasingly junior and less experienced pilots against the might of the US Navy and USAAF. Whilst operating from Rabaul, Iwamoto filed claims for a staggering 142 enemy aircraft shot down.\n\nCaroline Islands. Image Source: Wikipedia\n\nCaroline & Philippine Islands\n\nAfter withdrawing from Rabaul, Iwamoto returned to Japan in June 1944 for a brief respite from the front line, before fighting in the skies over Formosa, then transferred to Truk Atoll in the Caroline Islands and then the Philippine Islands during autumn and the winter. In November 1944 Iwamoto\u2019s skill and leadership were further recognised when he was commissioned as an officer in the ranks of the Japanese Navy, holding the rank of Ensign. Iwamoto\u2019s last operational sorties were flown with the 203rd Air Group, defending Kyushu and Okinawa in the furthest Southwest reaches of Japan against the long ranged B-29 attacks and the might of the US Navy\u2019s carrier borne air power. The last few months of Iwamoto\u2019s war were spent training kamikaze pilots at Iwakuni airfield on Honshu island.\n\nChiran high school girls wave farewell with cherry blossom branches to departing kamikaze pilot. Image Source: Wikipedia\n\nTactics\n\nHe was best at one-vs-one dogfights. He often employed, quick roll tactic combining with skidding sideway for sudden deceleration within 1/2 quick roll to make the opponent on the tail to overshoot. Corkscrew loop (Hineri-Komi Senp\u014d) was a short-cut or twist-in loop tactic, also called the skidding loop. He had also mastered the High and Low Yo-yo manouvres (Suichoku-Senkai Kasoku Senp\u014d). His favourite formation tactics, was a two group linked formation attack, where one section plays offence, zooming and diving formation attack, another section plays defense, positioned on the higher altitude to cover and support the offence section. Keeping his groups underneath thick clouds to hide his formation and waiting until the small number of opponent aircraft group coming down, then diving and zooming attack with all in a formation.\n\nLow Yo-yo. Image Source: Wikipedia\n\nAttacking the opponent formations after their mission was over and they were on the way to the regroup point, to fly back across the distance range over the sea. This tactics was taken when his own group had much fewer aircraft. Aerial Bomb attack tactic, was a twelve o\u2019clock high vertical dive attack from the front top in inverted flight (Haimen Suichoku K\u014dka Senp\u014d). It was almost vertical diving (about 60 degree) attack because the 30 kg aerial bomb needed the releasing speed over 280 knots to work timer correctly for the explosion. Inverted flight at the starting point because Zero Fighter could not keep steep angle while diving due to its high flight stability.\n\n\n\nFlight leader Masao Sato with his pilots aboard Zuikaku, 6 Dec 1941, one day before Pearl Harbour Attack; Tetsuzo Iwamoto second row, right-most. Image Source: ww2db.com\n\nAnother tactic that Japanese often employed was called \u201cSend Wolf \u201c, which essentially meant first sending a strike against US targets, and then attacking those US aircraft that got airborne after the base had been attacked by surprise. He was very good at using the 30 kg No. 3 Aerial Bomb, which was difficult to handle, although it was used against aircraft, and caused great damage.\n\nJapanese Type 99 30kg High-explosive bomb. Image Source: commons.wikimedia.org\n\nAerial Victories Claimed in His Diary\n\nHis own diary claimed that he had downed 202 aircraft during the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War while sharing credit with others for another 26 kills; this translated to somewhere between 80 and 90 kills based on the scoring system used by American airmen during WW2. 94 victories is what has been assigned to him.\n\nVought F4U Corsair. Image Source: Wikipedia\n\nHe had claimed seven victories against Grumman F4F Wildcat (Coral Sea, 8 May 1942, and at Rabaul, late 1943; 19 February 1944 the escort fighters of Martin flying boat). His claimed four Lockheed P-38 Lightning P-38 victories, at \u2013 4 (Rabaul, late 1943 \u2013 1944). 48 victories against Vought F4U Corsair, plus one unconfirmed. These were at Rabaul, Mobara-airbase outskirts of Tokyo, during Operation Kikusui, Okinawa, March 10 \u2013 June 24, 1945). This was more than 1 in 4 of all F4U air-to-air losses during the Second World War. He claimed two Bell P-39 Airacobra at Rabaul in late 1943. He claimed one Curtiss P-40 Warhawk at Rabaul, late 1943. He also claimed 39 Grumman F6F Hellcat victories, that included 29 (at Rabaul late 1943 \u2013 Feb 1944; Truk 28\u201329 April 1944; Operation Kikusui, Okinawa, March 10 \u2013 June 15, 1945). He claimed one Republic P-47 Thunderbolt victory over Rabaul, late 1943 \u2013 1944. He claimed one North American Aviation P-51 Mustang over Rabaul, on 19 February 1944, the Allied 2nd air-raid of the day. He claimed to have shot four British Spitfire burned on the ground, two shot over Indian Ocean on 9 April 1942. He claimed 48 US Navy\u2019s Douglas SBD Dauntless with seven unconfirmed, (Coral Sea, 8 May 1942; Rabaul, late 1943 \u2013 February 1944; Truk 28, 29 April 1944; Battle off Formosa, 12 October 1944). He also reportedly shot down 30 Douglas SBD Dauntless using No.3 Aerial Bombs over Rabaul, in late 1943 \u2013 1944. He claimed five Grumman TBF Avenger, with 19 uncofirmed. These were at Rabaul, late 1943 to February 1944, the Allied 6th and the 3rd final air-raid of the day to Rabaul. He claimed five Curtiss SB2C Helldiver at Rabaul late 1943 to early 1944). He also claimed five North American B-25 Mitchell medium bombers at Rabaul, starting late 1943 to 19 February 1944, during the Allied 4th air-raid of the day. He claimed two Martin B-26 Marauder American twin-engined medium bomber at Rabaul. He claimed six Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers using No. 3 Aerial Bombs and damaged two at Truk, reportedly confirmed by ground crew. He claimed one Boeing B-29 Superfortress four-engine propeller-driven heavy bomber at Kagoshima, Kyushu, Japan, April 1945. He claimed a PBY5A flying boat over Indian Ocean on April 5, 1942. He reportedly shot a Martin Mariner flying boat victory at Rabaul, on 19 February 1944. This aircraft was escorted by 12 F4Fs. He strafed three Destroyers on the night of February 5, 1944. He strafed many Landing crafts at Kerama islands, Okinawa, on night March 26, 1945. He strafed airfields Lae, Eastern New Guinea, on January 23, 1942, and Torokina, Bougainville, Solomons, on night 1944.\n\nUS Navy\u2019s Douglas SBD Dauntless Dive Bomber. Image Source: blenderartists.org\n\nAir Kills Debate \u2013 Yet Greatest Japanese Fighter Ace of All Time.\n\nIwamoto\u2019s final number of kills remains open to debate. A combination of the Japanese practice of crediting victories to a squadron rather than an individual, lost records and discrepancies between the confirmation process in Japan and allied nations mean that the final tally will never be known. Most sources officially credit Iwamoto with 80 kills in WW II plus 14 in China, his war diary claims 202 individual victories, 26 shared and 22 unconfirmed. An outspoken, opinionated and brash man on the ground, Iwamoto was conversely a tactically minded and cool headed aviator who favoured hit and run tactics over dog-fighting. There is a very good chance that he was, and forever will be, the greatest Japanese fighter ace of all time.\n\nZero Fighting Tiger. Image Source: snappygoat.com\n\nThe \u201cZero Fighting Tiger\u201d\n\nTetsuzo had reportedly flown 8,000 hrs by March 1944. He was an operational leader, cleared for solo fighter reconnaissance and attack mission across night and over ocean. He was cleared for night carrier operations.

The Allied Occupation Forces searched for war criminals in the Japanese Officer Corps. Iwamoto was summoned twice for questioning to Douglas MacArthur\u2019s Allied GHQ office in Tokyo. Although he managed to avoid being declared a war criminal, he was nevertheless blacklisted from public sector employment. Managers of nongovernmental businesses and local factories in his hometown also did not dare to employ him, in order to comply with the wishes of the new Allied GHQ. In general, anyone who had been an officer in the IJA or IJN was disliked by the Allied Occupation Forces.\n\n253 Ku at Truk, 29 April 1944. Front row, extreme left, Tetsuzo Iwamoto. Image Source: http://www.tumblr.com\n\nHis wife knew him as a \u201cwartime ace pilot\u201d, and in fact was a fan who later married through matchmaking agency. He very methodically kept all records. Japanese journalists who had promoted Japanese militarism campaign during the war started a radio program of anti-militarism postwar called Shin-Jitsu wa K\u014d Da (\u201cThe Truth Is This\u201d). The program considered people such as Iwamoto the cat\u2019s-paws of militarism. Iwamoto struggled to survive until the San Francisco Peace Conference was held, after which, in the spring of 1952, the Allied Occupation Forces finally left Japan. In 1952, Iwamoto finally obtained employment at the Masuda spinning mill of Daiwa B\u014dseki (since renamed to \u201cDaiwab\u014d\u201d Co., Ltd).\n\nDeath Due Medical Complications\n\nIn the summer of 1953, Iwamoto developed a stomach ache. A surgeon examined him and diagnosed enteritis. It was found later to be appendicitis. After a series of operations, he complained of a backache. Doctors decided to operate on him again. For reasons which are not entirely clear, the surgical team decided to remove three or four ribs without anesthesia. This led to sepsis. Iwamoto died on 20 May 1955, at the age of just 38 years old. His wife recalled his final words: \u201cWhen I get well, I want to fly again.\u201d\n\nMitsubishi A6M Zero\n\nA light and nimble fighter, the Mitsubishi A6M Zero was the first carrier based fighter capable of besting its land based opponents, and was Japan\u2019s main fighter of WWII. The Zero\u2019s design sacrificed protection for speed, maneuverability, and long range, on the theory that superior speed and maneuverability were protections in their own right, with long range an added bonus. The A6M came as a shock to Allied pilots when first encountered, because it could outmaneuver every airplane it faced at the time. A better dogfighter than anything the Allies had at the start of the Pacific War, the Zero\u2019s superior performance, especially in the hands of Japan\u2019s elite naval aviators, exceeded anything the Allies had hitherto expected from the Japanese. In the war\u2019s early days, Japanese naval aviators flying Zeroes achieved a 12:1 kill ratio.\n\nMitsubishi A6M Zero. Image Source: aviation-history.com\n\nTo counter the Zero\u2019s advantages, American pilots adopted team work tactics such as the \u201cThach Weave\u201d which required pilot pairs to work in tandem, or the \u201cBoom and Zoom\u201d, in which American pilots engaged the Zero only in diving attacks, as the acceleration of their heavier planes in a dive allowed them to flee if the diving attack failed. While holding considerable advantages in maneuverability and speed, the Zero\u2019s lack of protection for either the pilot or the fuel tanks proved a steadily mounting disadvantage as the war progressed, since the heavier and more rugged American fighters could absorb considerable punishment from Zeroes, while a single machine gun burst from the American plane could disintegrate a Zero.\n\nGrumman F6F Hellcat. Image Source: warhistoryonline.com\n\nBy 1943, attrition had thinned the ranks of Japan\u2019s elite aviators, and the Japanese Navy\u2019s training pipeline could not produce enough replacements of similar caliber. As a result, there were fewer and fewer Japanese pilots capable of extracting the most out of the Zero\u2019s advantages while minimizing its disadvantages. Which was bad news for the Japanese, as the quality of American aviators was increasing, due to wartime experience as well as an extensive training program that produced capable aviators at a rate Japan could not match. That was exacerbated by the introduction of new American fighters, such as the F4U Corsair and the F6F Hellcat, that were a significant improvement over their predecessors, and proved more than a match for the Zero, with greater firepower, armor, speed, and similar maneuverability.\n\nImage Source: cs.finescale.com\n\nBy 1944 the Zero was rapidly becoming obsolete, but it remained in front line service because the Japanese faced production difficulties in fielding a replacement. From its heyday at war\u2019s beginning when it ruled the skies of the Pacific while flown by elite pilots, A6Ms were reduced by war\u2019s end to flying kamikaze missions under the controls of barely trained novices.\n\nList of Japanese Navy Air Force aces Mitsubishi A6M \u201cZero\u201d\n\nThis is a list of Imperial Navy Air aces flying the Mitsubishi Zero fighter during the Pacific War.\n\nTetsuzo Iwamoto: 94 (including 14 in China / personal diary accounts for a total of 202 kills)\n\nShoichi Sugita: 70 (some sources say 80)\n\nSabur\u014d Sakai: 64 (2 in China)\n\nTakeo Okumura: 54 (4 in China)\n\nHiroyoshi Nishizawa: 36 official (102 claimed)\n\nToshio Ohta: 34\n\nKazuo Sugino: 32\n\nJunichi Sasai: 27\n\nSito Origami: 10 (9 in China, 1 disputed)\n\nToshiyuki Sueda: 9\n\nSh\u014dichi Sugita.

It was the most famous group. They operated from Rabaul, New Britain and acquired their legendary fame over Taihoku (The Philippines), the Dutch East Indies, Lae and Buna (New Guinea) and, in the last stages of war, in defense of mainland Japan. Sabur\u014d Sakai was another member in this unit after Dutch Indies operations, from the Denpasar base on Bali.\n\nFighter pilots of the Tainan Air Group pose at Lae in June 1942.

His first combat occurred over China in early 1938. He emerged as the top naval ace of the campaign, credited with 14 aerial victories. Subsequently he flew Zeros from the aircraft carrier Zuikaku from December 1941 to May 1942, including at the Battle of the Coral Sea.\n\nIn late 1943, Iwamoto's air group was sent to Rabaul, New Britain, resulting in three months of the hardest air combat ever undertaken by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force against air raids mounted by U.S. and Allied air units.[2][3]\n\nSubsequent assignments were Truk Atoll in the Carolines and the Philippines, being commissioned an ensign in October 1944. Following the evacuation of the Philippines, Iwamoto served in home defense and trained kamikaze pilots.\n\nLike many Japanese veterans, Iwamoto was reported to have fallen into depression after the war. His diary was found after his death, with claims of 202 Allied aircraft destroyed.\n\nAs a result of the Japanese use of the British naval practices, the IJNAF scoring system was based on the system the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force (RAF) adopted from World War I until World War II. This system differed from the scoring system used by the U.S. Navy Air Force and U.S. Marine Air Force during World War II. Dr. Izawa and Professor Hata estimated the figure at about 80 or more than 87 in their research work in January 1971. In December 1993 Izawa wrote that Iwamoto was virtually the top ace of the IJNAF, .[4]\n\nAs of mid-1944, there remained only two IJNAF fighter pilots who were credited with over 100 victories. Depending on various totals cited, Tetsuz\u014d Iwamoto or Hiroyoshi Nishizawa was Japan's best ace. Iwamoto was known as the Ch\u016btai leader (Flying Company, Squadron of 8 to 16 fighters). Iwamoto was one of few survivors of the IJNAF from the early part of the second world war. He fought over the Indian and the Pacific Ocean from north to south, and trained his young pilots even in the last months of the war.[5]\n\nEarly life\n\nTetsuzo was the third son of the Iwamoto family. He was born on a border town, southern part of Karafuto 15 June 1916, later grew up in Sapporo, Hokkaid\u014d, Japan. He enjoyed skiing in his elementary school days. When he lived in Sapporo, his father was a chief police officer.\n\nWhen he was 13, his father retired and Tetsuzo moved with his family to his father's hometown, Masuda, Shimane prefecture. He studied at the Prefectural Masuda Agricultural and Forestry High School. His favorite school subjects were mathematics and geometry; in these subjects, he always scored A's on his school report.\n\nHe was an active and nimble boy. He joined a school club brass band as a trumpeter. Another hobby was growing plants and flowers. He helped local fishermen in the fishing season, going out to the sandy beach early in the morning and driving fish into the nets. He talked down to his teachers sometimes in discussions, which was very impolite for a school student in pre-war Japan. He was regarded as the most opinionated student in his school.\n\nStarting military career\n\nIwamoto started his military career in 1934 after he graduated the school at 18. Following the advice from his parents to study while young, Tetsuzo left for a large city where he was supposed to take a college entrance examination. He, however, secretly applied for and passed the examination for acceptance as an Imperial Japanese naval airman 4th class, and was promoted to 3rd class 5 months later. His parents were very disappointed, for they became reliant upon Tetsuzo rather than his eldest brother, who was already studying at some university in a large city and would not return to Masuda.[6]\n\nIn 1936, when he was a naval mechanic 2nd class and a crewman on the light aircraft carrier Ry\u016bj\u014d, he studied hard and passed the difficult IJNAF exam, taken by thousands of applicants. He was enrolled in the class 34th Soju-Renshusei (Soren means flight trainee program) for naval petty officers and sailors. He graduated as one of the select 26 young aviators of the class 34th Soju-Renshusei (flight trainee program) in December of that year.\n\nOn April 4, 1936, he was sent to Kasumigaura-Ku (Kasumigaura FR(AG)) as a probationer in the class 34th Sojyu-Renshusei (flight trainee program), then on April 28, formally joined Kasumigaura-Ku. While his training going on November 1, 1936, he was promoted to naval mechanic 1st class. Finally on December 26, he graduated 34th class of Sojyu-Renshusei, was promoted to airman 1st class (old rank name of pre-war Japan, equivalent to senior airman). During flight training school at the Tomobe branch of Kasumigaura-Ku (Kasumigaura FR(AG)), his fighter course instructor was the well-known Chitoshi Isozaki.\n\nIn December 1936. Iwamoto entered Saeki K\u014dk\u016btai (a K\u014dk\u016btai was a Naval Air Group, whether being based at land or on board a carrier) for 6 months of advanced training (termed extended education), finished and next entered Omura K\u014dk\u016btai on July 16, 1937. He had hard training there every day from senior pilots including Air Petty Officer 1st class Toshio Kuroiwa (rank grade was at that time), who was the IJNAF legendary dogfight master pilot. Tetsuzo Iwamoto (called Tetsu in short from his senior pilots) had to wait for his debut until February 10, 1938.\n\nChina front\n\nTetsuzo's ability as a fighter pilot was recognized by all on his first air mission with the 13th Flying Group on February 25, 1938 over Nanchang, China.\n\nAfter combat training, on February 10, 1938, Tetsuzo Iwamoto was led by his leader APO 1/C Toshio Kuroiwa, flying for two and a quarter hours over the China Sea from Omura Airbase at Ky\u016bsh\u016b Japan to the airfield outside of Nanjing China.\n\nHis squadron on the Chinese frontline was the 13th Flying Group Fighter Squadron. This Flying Group was highly regarded and was famed as the Nango Fighter Squadron, named after its former squadron leader, Mochifumi Nango, who had showed considerable courage and conspicuous leadership.\n\nIwamoto's first combat came on February 25, 1938 over Nanchang. His squadron's fighters escorted bombers Type 96 land-based attack aircraft. Chinese's fighters attacked, and the squadron's leader Lieutenant Takuma was lost on this mission.\n\nIwamoto described his first combat in his notes. During the escort mission, his squadron was intercepted by sixteen I-15s and I-16s at an altitude of 5000 meters. Iwamoto claimed 4 victories (1 probable) in the combat. He secured his first victory by firing when within 50m of the enemy fighter. He first saw white smoke, then the enemy burned up and crashed. He was then at an altitude of 4000 m. When he looked back, there was an enemy fighter just behind him. He instantly made a Split S maneuver and narrowly escaped.\n\nHe got his second victory against an I-15. He saw it below him, turned and attacked from its 6 o'clock high. When it was hit, it climbed sharply and went spinning downward out of control and crashed into the ground. He kept his altitude of 4,000 m. He got an I-16 at the top of its roll in his gunsight and fired a burst, its engine burning and out of control; Tetsuzo lost sight of it before it crashed, and he reported this as probable. Another I-15 came down to him from 12 o'clock ahead. Both made a climb and were soon in a dogfight. The I-15 tried to break free of him and made a straight dive. That action made it easier for Tetsuzo to aim. He downed this I-15 on farmland near the airfield. He was flying at an altitude of 2000 m.\n\nAbove him, many enemy fighters were maneuvering. He found one of them coming down with landing gear down. He chased it to an altitude of 200 m and fired a burst. The I-16 was surprised and made a split S maneuver, but crashed at a corner of the airfield. This was his 4th victory.\n\nAnti-aircraft guns started firing heavily, and he found himself in an intense barrage of flak. Rushing to escape at full throttle with a number of enemy fighters behind him, he succeeded in returning safely from the battlefield. His leader Kuroiwa had already returned to the Wuhu airfield, Anhui China, waiting for his return.

It was very unusual among IJNAF,[7] IJAAF[8] fighter pilots, although it was usual over 10,000 flying hours among the multi-seated aircraft IJNAF, IJAAF veteran pilots.) Oceanic Transition: possible, navigating and leading his fighter chutai (without Radar) Instrument Flight: possible Night Flight: possible Single-seat Fighter renaissance and attack mission across night ocean: possible Night landing: possible with simple approach lighting system Night carrier landing: possible with approach path indicator lights\n\nOnly experienced fighter pilots in the IJNAF could execute instrument flight with their single-seat fighter aircraft on combat missions; few IJNAF officer pilots could fly on instruments.\n\nHis tactics\n\nSingle to single dogfight tactic - from losing to winning [9]\n\nQuick roll (Roll Sempoh) (up and down quick roll tactic, skidding sideway (sudden decelerate) within 1/2 quick roll to forward the opponent aircraft on one's tail and get tail shot position of it. Cmdr Takeo SHIBATA promoted, his men developed and taught him.[10]) Coke-screw loop (Hineri-Komi Sempoh) (short-cut or twist-in loop tactic, skidding loop. Lieutenant Isamu MOCHIZUKI's special, Section leader and Warrant Officer Toshio KUROIWA trained him.[11]) Yo-yo turn (Suichoku-Senkai Kasoku Sempoh) (Lt. JG Sadaaki AKAMATSU's special at China front.[12] )\n\nFormation tactics -\n\nTwo groups linked formation attack one section plays offence, zooming and diving formation attack, another section plays defense, positioned on the higher altitude to cover and support the offence section. Keeping his groups underneath thick clouds to hide his formation and waiting until the small number of opponent aircraft group coming down, then diving and zooming attack with all in formation. Attacking the opponent groups after their mission over and on the way to the waiting circle, in a group to fly back across the distance range over the sea. This tactics was taken when his group had much less number of aircraft.\n\nNo.3 Areal Bomb attack tactic[13] -\n\nTwelve o'clock high vertical dive attack from the front top in inverted flight (Haimen Suichoku Kohka Sempoh) Almost vertical diving (about 60 degree) attack because the 30kg No.3 Areal Bomb needs the releasing speed over 280knot/h to work timer correctly for 1st small explosion. Inverted flight at the starting point because Zero Fighter could not keep steep angle while diving due to its excellent flight stability.\n\nVictories\n\nChina Front, Feb.1938 - Sep.1938\n\n14 victories: I-15, I-16 (citation as the IJNAF top ace)\n\nWorld War II, Pacific Front and Indian Front, 8 December 1941 - 15 August 1945\n\n228 aerial victories: victories - 202 shared victories - 26\n\nunconfirmed - 27 damaged - 2 destroyed on the ground - 2\n\nAircraft types he confronted\n\n(World War II, 8 December 1941 - July 1942, April 1943 - 15 August 1945, Allied U.S. Army, Navy, Marine, Royal Navy, Australia, New Zealand)[14]\n\nF4F victories - 7 (Coral Sea, 8 May 1942; Rabaul, late 1943 - 10AM 19 Feb.1944 the escort fighters of Martin flying boat)\n\nP-38 victories - 4 (Rabaul, late 1943-1944)\n\nF4U victories - 48; unconfirmed 1 (Rabaul, late 1943 - Feb. 1944; Mobara-airbase outskirts of Tokyo, Japan, February 16, 1945; Operation Kikusui (Imperial Chrysanthemum on the Water - divine wind), Okinawa, March 10 - June 24, 1945).

He was summoned twice to Douglas MacArthur's Allied GHQ office in Tokyo. Though he avoided being declared a war criminal, he was blacklisted for public sector employment. Managers of nongovernmental businesses and local factories in his hometown also did not dare to employ him, in order to comply with the wishes of the new Allied GHQ. Those who had been officers in the IJA or IJN were disliked by the Allied Occupation Forces.\n\nJapanese journalists who had promoted Japanese militarism campaign during the war started a radio program of anti-militarism postwar called \"\"Shin-Jitsu wa Kou da (The Truth Is This)\"\". People like Iwamoto were considered the cat's-paws of militarism there.\n\nIwamoto struggled to survive until the San Francisco Peace Conference was held and the Allied Occupation Forces left Japan in the spring of 1952. In 1952, he finally obtained employment at the Masuda spinning mill of Daiwa Bouseki (now renamed as \"Daiwabo\" Co., Ltd, \u5927\u548c\u7d21\u7e3e ). However, in summer 1953, he developed a stomach ache. A surgeon examined him and diagnosed enteritis. It was found later to be appendicitis.\n\nAfter a series of operations, he complained of a backache. Doctors decided to operate on him again. With cause unknown, they removed three or four ribs without anesthesia. This led to sepsis (septicemia, blood poisoning).\n\nHis wife recalled his words, \"When I get well, I want to fly again.\" He died on 20 May 1955.[citation needed]\n\nNotes\n\n\u2191 Dr. Yasuho Izawa, 1993, Gekitsui Oh To Kuusen (Ace and Combat), Kohjin-sha \u2191 pp.127-136, Ryunosuke Kusaka,IJN Grand Fleet \u2191 BAA BAA BLACK SHEEP The general attack to smash Rabaul fortress with all Allied air units continued 17 Dec.1943-Mar.1944. ch.9, Gregory Boyington The general attack to smash Rabaul fortress with all Allied air units continued 17 Dec.1943-Mar.1944. \u2191 pp.171-268, Izawa, Hata, 1971, Nippon Kaigun SentouKi Tai, Kanto-sha; pp62 - 63, Izawa, 1993, Nippon Riku-Kaigun Ace Retsuden(IJAF and IJNAF Aces), Kojin-sha \u2191 p.470, Saburo Abe, Zero Fighter Pilots Association, 2004, \"My combat against Spitfires on VJ-day\", ZeroSen, Kaku Tatakaeri!, Bunshun-Nesco; pp.248-249, Toshio Hijikata, 2004, Kaigun Yobi-Gakusei Zero-Sen KuuSen-Ki (Air combat note of an IJNAF reserved student officer Zero fighter pilot), Kohjin-sha \u2191 Mrs. Iwamoto's postscript within Zerosen Gekitsui-Oh(Zero fighter ace) \u2191 IJNAF: Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force \u2191 IJAAF: Imperial Japanese Army Air Force \u2191 p.127, p.141, p.305 Tetsuzo Iwamoto, 1973.

Peter Chen\n\nww2dbaseTetsuzo Iwamoto was born in Karafuto Prefecture, Japan (now southern Sakhalin Island). He grew up in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan after his father was appointed the chief of police of that city. In 1929, his father retired, and the whole family moved to his father's home town, Masuda, Shimane Prefecture, Japan, where he studied at the Masuda Agricultural and Forestry High School. In 1934, upon graduating high school, he was sent to a large city to take the college entrance exams, but instead he applied for and passed the exam for the air arm of the Japanese navy. In 1936, he served aboard carrier Ryujo with the rating of mechanic 2nd class. He began flight training on 28 Apr 1936. On 1 Nov 1936, he was promoted to the rating of mechanic 1st class. On 26 Dec, he graduated from the program and was promoted to airman 1st class. He was assigned to the Saeki Air Group for six months of advanced training, and then was transferred to the Omura Naval Air Group on 16 Jul 1937.\n\nww2dbaseOn 10 Feb 1938, Iwamoto was transferred to the front lines as he flew from Omura Airfield near Nagasaki, Japan to Nanjing, China, thus beginning his career in WW2. With the 13th Flying Group's fighter squadron in China, his first combat mission took place on 25 Feb over Nanchang, China as he escorted Type 96 attack aircraft. The flight was attacked by 16 Chinese fighters. During the dogfight, Iwamoto claimed 3 confirmed and 1 probable kills, but was scolded after he returned for his overly-aggressive actions. On 22 Mar 1938, the 13th Flying Group's fighter squadron was merged with the 12th Fighter Squadron. On 29 Apr 1938, he fought Chinese Air Force fighters and scored several victories, and was later awarded a citation by Commander Tsukahara. He was ordered back to Japan in Sep 1938; at this point, he had 14 kills on his records and was one of the aces among Japanese airmen in China.\n\nww2dbaseBack in Japan, Iwamoto served as a member of the Saiki Air Group as a trainer. In 1940, he was awarded the Order of the Golden Kite 5th Class. During the Pacific War, he was initially a pilot with the carrier Zuikaku from Dec 1941 to May 1942, during which time he participated in the Battle of the Coral Sea. In late 1943, he was sent to Rabaul, New Britain. In 1944, he was successively transferred to Truk Atoll in the Caroline Islands and then the Philippine Islands. In Oct 1944, he was promoted to the rank of ensign. During the Okinawa Campaign, he participated in Operation Kikusui. His own diary claimed that he had downed 202 aircraft during the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War while sharing credit with others for another 26 kills; this translated to somewhere between 80 and 90 kills based on the scoring system used by American airmen during WW2.\n\nww2dbaseAfter the war, Iwamoto was summoned for several interviews and interrogations by the Allied administration. Although he was eventually cleared and thus not declared a war criminal, he was still unable to get a job due to potential employers wishing to please the occupation administration. In 1952, the Allied occupation gave control of Japan back to the Japanese people, and he was finally able to get a job at a local spinning mill. In the summer of 1953, he underwent a series of surgeries for enteritis (mis-diagnosed) and appendicitis (actual cause of stomach pains). Shortly after, he complained of back pains and received another surgery. He passed away in his home town of Masuda after getting septicemia after the final surgery. According to his wife, his last words were \"[w]hen I get well, I want to fly again\".\n\nww2dbaseSource: Wikipedia.\n\nLast Major Revision: Jan 2010\n\nTetsuzo Iwamoto Timeline\n\nPhotographs"}, {"url": "https://www.liquisearch.com/tetsuz%C5%8D_iwamoto/china_front", "page_content": "China Front\n\nTetsuzo's ability as a fighter pilot was recognized by all on his first air mission with the 13th Flying Group on February 25, 1938 over Nanchang, China.\n\nAfter combat training, on February 10, 1938, Tetsuzo Iwamoto was led by his leader APO 1/C Toshio Kuroiwa, flying for two and a quarter hours over the China Sea from Omura Airbase at Ky\u016bsh\u016b Japan to the airfield outside of Nanjing China.\n\nHis squadron on the Chinese frontline was the 13th Flying Group Fighter Squadron. This Flying Group was the considered the best and was famed as the Nango Fighter Squadron, named after its former squadron leader, Mochifumi Nango, who showed extreme courage and conspicuous leadership. Nango had a famous samurai sword named Kotetsu with him, which became the metaphor for old IJNAF pilots' yearned for Commander Nango.\n\nIwamoto's first combat came on February 25, 1938 over Nanchang. The squadron fighters escorted bombers Type 96 land-based attack aircraft. Then the Chinese's tenacious air force attacked, and his squadron leader Lieutenant Takuma was lost on this mission.\n\nIwamoto described his first combat in his notes. During the escort mission, his squadron was intercepted by sixteen I-15s and I-16s at an altitude of 5000 meters. Iwamoto claimed 4 victories (1 probable) in the combat. He got his first victory by firing when within 50m of the enemy fighter. He first saw white smoke, then the enemy burned up and crashed. He was then at an altitude of 4000 m. When he looked back, there was an enemy fighter just behind him. He instantly made a Split S maneuver and narrowly escaped.\n\nHe got his second victory against an I-15. He saw it below him, turned and attacked from its 6 o'clock high. When it was hit, it climbed sharply and went spinning downward out of control and crashed into the ground. He kept his altitude of 4,000 m. He got an I-16 at the top of its roll in his gunsight and fired a burst, its engine burning and out of control; Tetsuzo lost sight of it before it crashed, and he reported this as probable. Another I-15 came down to him from 12 o'clock ahead. Both made a climb and were soon in a dogfight. The I-15 tried to break free of him and made a straight dive. That action made it easier for Tetsuzo to aim. He downed this I-15 on farmland near the airfield. He was down to an altitude of 2000 m.\n\nAbove him, many enemy fighters kept maneuvering. He found one of them coming down with landing gears down. He chased it to an altitude of 200 m and fired a burst. The I-16 was surprised and made a split S maneuver, but crashed at a corner of the airfield. This was his 4th victory.\n\nAnti-aircraft guns started firing heavily, and he found himself in a terrible barrage of flak. Rushing to escape at full throttle with a number of enemy fighters behind him, he succeeded in returning safely from the battlefield. His leader Kuroiwa had already returned to the Wuhu airfield, Anhui China, waiting for his return. Kuroiwa scolded Tetsu severely for his rash attacks of the day.\n\nThe escort mission fighter members list, 13th Flying Group on Feb. 25 1938 Chutai and Shotai Leader Wingman Wingman 1st Chutai 1st Shotai Lt.

Some use classes (kyu), others use levels (dan); many modern martial arts use both. Some systems follow a numerical order, others use position (high, mid, low, for example); some use a hierarchy of titles specific to their specific subculture.\n\nIt is perfectly reasonable to suspect I might have missed some usage of a given title or term. But we need to keep in mind relevance: even if it came out that such-and-such terms were used by some obscure tradition, it would most likely be irrelevant unless we could trace back a connection to either Daito-ryu, the Kodokai, or Horikawa sensei himself.\n\nWith the above out of the way, let\u2019s get started.\n\nGo and Shogi\n\nThe first known usage of the term Meijin as a title or rank finds its origin in Go an Shogi (Japanese chess).\n\n\u6c5f\u6238\u6642\u4ee3\u3001\u56f2\u7881\u30fb\u5c06\u68cb\u3067\u4e5d\u6bb5\u306e\u6280\u91cf\u3092\u6301\u3064\u6700\u9ad8\u4f4d\u8005\u306b\u4e0e\u3048\u3089\u308c\u305f\u79f0\u3002\u73fe\u5728\u306f\u3001\u305d\u308c\u305e\u308c\u30bf\u30a4\u30c8\u30eb\u306e\u540d\u79f0\u3002\u540d\u4eba\u6226\u306e\u52dd\u8005\u304c\u30bf\u30a4\u30c8\u30eb\u3092\u624b\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3002 A title given to the most highly skilled players of Go and Shogi holding a rank of 9th dan during the Edo period.

Source: Wikipedia\n\nAs we can see, the title Eisei Meijin is an honorary one of a sort, as it is assumed by an individual once their career is completed, but one certainly needs exceptional skills to win the title five times in the first place.\n\nWhether this should be considered the highest honor is debatable. First, it\u2019s a title attached to a single tournament. While currently the oldest, there are seven other title tournaments, many of which also award an Eisei prefixed title to individuals having won the tournament a number of times. Second, because other titles of similar denominations are in existence, such as Meiyo Meijin (\u540d\u8a89\u540d\u4eba, or Honorary Meijin) and Zoumeijin (\u8d08\u540d\u4eba, a posthumous Meijin title) that could perhaps carry more prestige depending on circumstances.\n\nEisei Meijin was released by Konami for Sega Saturn in 1990. The last iteration of this game, Eisei Meijin VII, was released in 2003 for PlayStation 2 (Source: Wikipedia)\n\nAs an aside, the term Eisei Meijin was popularized to some degree through the launch of a series of Shogi video games for various gaming consoles during the 90s and early 2000s. Amusingly enough, this game series has been selected for preservation by the National Diet Library. When searching for the term Eisei Meijin in their online archives, a large portion of the search results point to various iterations and releases of this game.\n\nBudo ranking systems and Meijin titles\n\nThere seems to be a potential connection to the Budo world, here. Given that the dan and kyu system was reportedly adopted from Shogi by Kano Jigoro of the Kodokan, it stands to reason that Shogi might have been the inspiration for other ranks and titles as well.\n\nBut first, a bit of history on Budo ranking systems.\n\nWhile the dan and kyu ranking system wouldn\u2019t be popularized in Budo until much later, some koryu are known to have implemented dan systems as early as the beginning of the Edo period.\n\n\u5263\u8853\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u306f\u85a9\u6469\u85e9\u3067\u666e\u53ca\u3057\u305f\u793a\u73fe\u6d41\u304c\u6700\u521d\u3067\u3042\u308a,\u6d41\u7956\u306e\u6771\u90f7\u85e4\u5175\u885b\u91cd\u4f4d(1560\uff5e1643)\u304c\u6b8b\u3057\u305f\u300e\u793a\u73fe\u6d41\u5175\u6cd5\u66f8\u4e0a\u4e2d\u4e0b\u300f\u306b\u306f\u300c\u521d\u6bb5,\u4e8c\u6bb5,\u4e09\u6bb5,\u56db\u6bb5\u300d\u306e\u6bb5\u4f4d\u304c\u8a18\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002 Jigen-ryu, of the Satsuma domain, was the first [to use the dan ranking system]; the founder of the tradition, Togo Tobei Shigekata (1560\u20131643), lists the ranks of Shodan, nidan, sandan, and yondan in his book \u201cJigen-ryu Heihosho Jouchuuge\u201d.

In Tenjin Shinyo-ryu, as in Shinno Shinto-ryu, there are three levels: shodan, chudan, and jodan, and the details of the \u201ckata\u201d to be learned at each level are described in detail (see Table 1).

They were a way to break down the curriculum. This can be seen in the densho (or transmission documents) of the tradition (note: there are some variations depending on specific lineages).\n\n\u967d\u4e4b\u5dfb, or Yo-no-maki, serving as a license (\u514d\u8a31, or menkyo)\n\nserving as a license (\u514d\u8a31, or menkyo) \u9670\u4e4b\u5dfb, or In-no-maki, serving as a certificate of full transmission (\u7686\u4f1d, or kaiden)\n\nTenjin Shinyo-ryu is one of the two traditions that Kano sensei trained in, so it is possible that the dan system may have been a source of inspiration. However, it appears more likely that Shogi had a stronger influence on the formation of the dan and kyu system later used by the Kodokan from its establishment in 1882.\n\nA decade later, in 1895, the Dai Nippon Butokukai is created along with a title-based ranking system (\u79f0\u53f7, or shogo \u2014 you\u2019ll remember this word was on Horikawa sensei\u2019s certificate). Over time, titles would include seiren-sho (\u7cbe\u932c\u8a3c), renshi (\u932c\u58eb), kyoshi (\u6559\u58eb, renamed to tasshi or \u9054\u58eb in 1943), and hanshi (\u7bc4\u58eb). They also used a variety of other titles and decorations, but as far as I could tell, the Meijin title was never used by this organization.\n\n\u540d\u8a89\u4f1a\u54e1\u7ae0 (Meiyo Kai\u2019insho), or honorary membership badge of the Butokukai. One distinguishing aspect in comparison to a standard membership badge is the ribbon decorating the badge itself. (Source: Yahoo Auction)\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that the word meijin wasn\u2019t used in a Budo context. Meijin as a more colloquial qualifier wasn\u2019t uncommon to describe individuals having acquired some widely recognized level of fame and mastery (a definition we\u2019ll cover in more detail in the next article of this series) in a traditional practice.\n\n\u660e\u6cbb\u6642\u4ee3\u306b\u306f\u3001\u6d3b\u7248\u5370\u5237\u304c\u666e\u53ca\u3057\u591a\u304f\u306e\u5263\u9053\u66f8\u304c\u520a\u884c\u3055\u308c\u305f\u304c\u3001\u7ba1\u898b\u3059\u308b\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3001\u6d3b\u7248\u5263\u9053\u66f8\u520a\u884c\u306e\u5686\u77e2\u3053\u3046\u3057\u306f\u795e\u9053\u7121\u5ff5\u6d41\u306e\u6839\u5cb8\u4fe1\u4e94\u90ce\u8457\u300e\u6483\u5263\u6307\u5357\u300f\uff08\u660e\u6cbb17\u5e74\uff09\u3067\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001\u540c\u5e74\u306b\u5317\u8fb0\u4e00\u5200\u6d41\u95a2\u4fc2\u8005\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u300e\u5263\u8853\u72ec\u6848\u5185\u300f\uff08\u68ee \u666f\u93ae\uff09\u3001\u300e\u5343\u8449\u5468\u4f5c\u5148\u751f\u76f4\u4f1d \u5263\u8853\u540d\u4eba\u6cd5\u300f\uff08\u9ad8\u5742\u660c\u5b5d\u2015\u4ee5\u4e0b\u300e\u5263\u8853\u540d\u4eba\u6cd5\u300f\uff09\u3001\u300e\u5263\u6cd5\u79d8\u8a23\u300f\uff08\u5e83\u702c\u771e\u5e73\uff09\u306e\u4e09\u66f8\u304c\u76f8\u6b21\u3044\u3067\u520a\u884c\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002 In the Meiji period, letterpress printing became widespread, and many kendo books were published. The first kendo book to be published in letterpress was \u201cGekiken Shinan\u201d (1882), written by Negishi Shingoro of Shinto Munenryu. In the same year, representatives of Hokushin Itto-ryu published three books: Kenjutsu Dokuiuchi[?] (Mori Keizhen), Kenjutsu Meijinho (Chiba Shusaku Sensei Jikiden Kenjutsu Meijinho), and Kenpo Hiketsu (Hirose Shimpei). Source: Zen Nihon Kendo Renmei official website\n\nHere, for instance, Meijinho\u2019s literal translation would be Master\u2019s Method(s).\n\nKyu-based ranking system used by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police, circa 1885 (Source: A Cultural View of Budo license in Budo and in Buddhist esotericism, Murayama Terushi)\n\nThe only mention of Meijin as a title or rank was in early Metropolitan Police literature. Here, Meijin is listed as the highest of four old ranks. The reason for this inclusion, however, remains unclear. For instance, Tennen Risshin Ryu would be an example of a tradition including the first three titles mentioned in the second row of the above table (kirigami, mokuroku, and menkyo), but Meijin wasn\u2019t used as a title by any traditions or at least no major traditions that I could find. Which raises the question: why is it included here?\n\nWhat makes matters even more complex is the ambiguity of the table itself. It\u2019s unclear whether the old titles refer to titles used in some classical traditions, or by one of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police\u2019s prior iterations. The TMPD (as established under the Ministry of the Interior at the time) went through several phases of disbandment and reestablishment between its initial creation in 1874. So it is possible that the Meijin title \u2014 and all the other old titles listed here \u2014 were carried over from one of those iterations. The potential connection of the title to any other specific classical traditions, however, remains unclear.\n\nIn 1952, two new organizations of interest to the topic at hand are established: the Kokusai Budoin and the Zen Nihon Kendo Renmei (from which the associated Jodo and Iaido Renmei would be established a bit later in 1956).\n\nThere are some hints that the Kendo Renmei and its sub-associations used the term Meijin, but I couldn\u2019t find records confirming any official use as a title or rank. It is worth noting that all potential awardees of the Mejin rank that I could find were 9th or 10th dan, which would parallel how the title was traditionally used in Shogi prior to the 50s. Regardless, those two dan ranks seem to have effectively gone out of use during the 70s, and testing for them was abolished entirely in the early 2000s \u2014 and with them, any potential for a new Meijin rank to be awarded, most likely.\n\nYou\u2019ll remember that Ishida sensei was the chairman of the Kendo Renmei at one point. If the above ever were to be confirmed, then we can potentially draw some parallel between the Kendo Renmei title and the one awarded to Horikawa sensei.\n\nAs for the Budoin, there are records of titles including the term Meijin from early on. Otsuka sensei, as a founding member of the organization, probably had a say in the choice of formulation for the ranks and titles the organization put in place.\n\nIMAF [or \u56fd\u969b\u6b66\u9053\u9662] was officially founded in January, 1952 by Master Kyuzo Mifune, Master Kazuo Ito and Shizuya Sato of Judo; Master Hakudo Nakayama and Master Hiromasa Takano of Kendo; Master Hironori Otsuka of Karate-do, and Kiyotaka Wake and Sueo Kiyoura.

Source: Wado-ryu official website\n\nOtsuka sensei, along with his Meijin Juudan certificate. The certificate states it is awarded for his long years of dedication to the research and practice of Karatedo (Source: Budoin Genryoku)\n\nLooking back at the full list of signatories, we can now see how the use of Meijin as a rank or title may have made some sense to many of them. Out of the eight signatories, six were at some point associated or had reasons to be familiar with the Kendo Renmei, police agencies (Mr. Machimura and Mr. Honda), or the Kokusai Budoin (Otsuka sensei with Mr. Muroki knowing of the title through his past teacher).\n\nAnd yet, none of these Budo organizations ever used the title of Eisei Meijin, formally or otherwise. The only known use of Eisei Meijin still remains in Shogi and started in 1952 (the same year the Kendo Renmei and the Budoin were founded, coincidentally).\n\nWhile the term Meijin as a rank or title finds some precedence in Budo, the use of Eisei Meijin on the certificate at hand is more or less without Budo precedents. Which makes it a bit harder to draw parallels or equivalencies with other ranks or titles that were more broadly in use over the years. We, therefore, need to review the more colloquial usage of the word to see if we can perhaps get a better grasp on things.\n\nComing up next\n\nIn the next article in this series, we will look at the meaning of the term Meijin; what is the definition of the term, its etymology, some synonyms, and whether the meaning of the term varied over time.\n\nThoughts, comments, or corrections?

Its original meaning is \"master\" or \"expert\" or \"virtuoso\" of any field, not just Go. Historically, during the Edo period in Japan, there was only one Meijin, equivalent to a 9-dan rank. This person had to stand out from their peers as the undisputed strongest player in the country, so there was not always a Meijin when there was no consensus.\n\nThe first Meijin was Honinbo Sansa in 1612. Honinbo Shusai was the last traditional Meijin, though in fact the system had necessarily changed after the Meiji Restoration. The rank of 9 dan was then separated from the Meijin title, and promotion to 9 dan was awarded through the Oteai, the first being Fujisawa Kuranosuke. The ten players who held the historic Meijin title were:\n\n+ = Meijin Godokoro\n\nMeijin Godokoro\n\nDuring the Tokugawa Shogunate there was a government position known as godokoro, the go instructor to the shogun. There was a similar job for shogi. The Godokoro post was created by Tokugawa Ieyasu and appointed by the Commissioner of Temples and Shrines (jishabugyo). As only the strongest player in the country could hold the post, the Meijin title was a requirement to become Godokoro, however it did not guarantee the appointment, and the position was sometimes vacant for long periods of time.\n\nStrong and ambitious Go players sought the job, sometimes resorting to scandalous political maneuvers. The Meijin Godokoro had significant power, prestige, and perquisites. In addition to having a government stipend and some access to the Shogun, the Meijin Godokoro was the highest official in the Go world, approving rank promotions, scheduling castle games, and adjudicating disputes between the go houses. It was practically a lifetime appointment because the Godokoro was exempt from competing in the Castle Games, and indeed barred from serious contests, since he was theoretically supposed to devote his every effort to helping the Shogun be a better player. This made it hard for other players to demonstrate that they were stronger, and therefore the rightful Meijin.\n\nBecause of this and other governmental support for Go (i.e. the Four Houses) during the Tokugawa period, the quality of play grew faster in Japan than elsewhere. Honinbo Jowa was the final Meijin Godokoro, as the Godokoro post was abolished in 1868 after the Meiji Restoration.\n\nThere were four players of Meijin-class strength who couldn't get the official title for various reasons.\n\nModern Japanese Tournament\n\nThe modern Meijin title came about in 1962, as a successor to the former title of Saikyo (1956-1961). The title is the second most prestigious of the big titles in Japan, at least in terms of prize money, after the Kisei. The winner's prize is \u00a533,000,000 currently.[6]\n\nTime controls for the best of 7 challenge are 8 hours each, for the league it's 5 hours each.[6]\n\nThe Meijin title has been sponsored by the Asahi Shinbun newspaper since 1976. The games can be found on their website (Japanese). They took over sponsorship from the Yomiuri Shimbun, and the Meijin tournaments played before then are now commonly referred to as the Old Meijin titles since the numbering of the titles started over with the change in sponsor.\n\nDue to the importance of the Meijin as one of the \"big three\" titles in Japan (along with the Honinbo and Kisei), there are several paths of automatic rank advancement through it in the Nihon Ki-in new promotion system. Qualifying for the Meijin league warrants a promotion to 7-dan, winning the league to challenge for the title promotes to 8-dan, and finally winning the title itself gives an immediate 9-dan promotion.\n\nAs with each of the three Japanese big titles, the previous year's title holder is challenged by the winner of a league. Entry to the league is gained through a series of preliminary tournaments. The title is decided in a best of seven match, where each player is given eight hours of thinking time over a two day period. Since 1976, four players have won all of their league games, the most recent being Iyama Yuta in 2009. http://www.nihonkiin.or.jp/english/topics/09/topics2009_09.htm#090910\n\nThe title Honorary Meijin is given to those players who have previously won the Meijin title five years in a row. Currently, this includes Cho Chikun and Kobayashi Koichi.\n\nThe Chinese Mingren and Korean Myeongin are corresponding titles. The three titleholders meet in the China-Korea-Japan Meijin.\n\nTournament Winners\n\nThe Meijin tournament was established in 1962, sponsored by the Yomiuri newspaper, whose sponsorship lasted for 14 years. In 1976 the Asahi newspaper took over sponsorship and the numbering of the titles began again with one. The Yomiuri-sponsored tournaments are now referred to as the \"Old Meijin\" titles.\n\nOld Series (Yomiuri)\n\nNew Series (Asahi)\n\nThe title match usually starts in August.\n\nKawabata's Novel\n\nJapanese Nobel laureate writer Yasunari Kawabata wrote a novel about Shusai\u0092s final game with Kitani Minoru, titled Meijin. Its English title is The Master of Go. The game is also described in The Meijin\u0092s Retirement Game by John Fairbairn, which includes a discussion of Kawabata\u0092s novel. This game marked the transition from the traditional title to the tournament.\n\nNotes\n\n[1] Game four of the 5th Meijin tournament was ruled void (or no result) due to some confusion with a ko. Both players were in byo-yomi and Cho Chikun asked the scorekeeper (Hikosaka Naoto) if it was his turn to take the ko. He agreed that it was, and Cho made the illegal move retaking the ko. Cho was not required to forfeit the game because the referree had erred, so the game was declared void.\n\n[2] Game four of the 23rd Meijin tournament was void (or no result) due to a triple ko.\n\n[3] The games of the 29th Meijin tournament are both interesting and unusual - Yoda Meijin played an interesting move in game three and game four is even stranger.\n\n[4] See Meijin League\n\n[5] See Meijin 2011 Game 2\n\n[6] http://www.nihonkiin.or.jp/match/meijin/042.html\n\n[7] Otake Hideo appeared in the final 9 times in 10 years starting from his first win in 1975 (plus further 3 times). He got the nickname of 'The man of Meijin tournament' (\u540d\u4eba\u6226\u7537)."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Tetsuz%C5%8D-Iwamoto", "page_content": "As of mid-1944, there remained only two IJNAF fighter pilots who were credited with over 100 victories. Depending on various totals cited, Tetsuz\u014d Iwamoto or Hiroyoshi Nishizawa was Japan's top ace. Iwamoto was known as the Ch\u016btai leader (Flying Company, squadron of 8 to 16 fighters). Iwamoto was one of few survivors of the IJNAF from the early part of the Second World War. He fought over the Indian and the Pacific Ocean from north to south, and trained young pilots even in the last months of the war. Like many Japanese veterans, Iwamoto was reported to have fallen into depression after the war. His diary was found after his death, with claims of 202 Allied aircraft destroyed.\n\nIwamoto was one of the highest-scoring Japanese aces. As a result of the Japanese use of the British naval practices, the IJNAF scoring system was based on the system the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force (RAF) adopted from World War I until World War II . This system differed from the scoring system used by some other nations during World War II. Research by academics surnamed Izawa and Hata in 1971 estimated his score at about 80 or more than 87. In December 1993 Izawa wrote that Iwamoto was virtually the top ace of the IJNAF.\n\nSubsequent assignments were Truk Atoll in the Carolines and the Philippines , being commissioned an ensign in October 1944. Following the evacuation of the Philippines, Iwamoto served in home defense and trained kamikaze pilots.\n\nIn late 1943, Iwamoto's air group was sent to Rabaul, New Britain, resulting in three months of air combat against Allied air raids.\n\nLieutenant Junior Grade Tetsuz\u014d Iwamoto (\u5ca9\u672c \u5fb9\u4e09, Iwamoto Tetsuz\u014d ) was one of the top scoring aces among Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force (IJNAF) fighter pilots. He entered the Imperial Navy in 1934 and completed pilot training in December 1936. His first combat occurred over China in early 1938. He emerged as the top ace of the Imperial Japan during WWII, credited with at least 87 aerial victories including 14 victories in China . Subsequently he flew Zeros from the aircraft carrier Zuikaku from December 1941 to May 1942, including at the Battle of the Coral Sea .\n\nEarly life\n\nTetsuzo was the third son of the Iwamoto family. He was born on a border town, southern part of Karafuto 15 June 1916, later grew up in Sapporo, Hokkaid\u014d, Japan. He enjoyed skiing in his elementary school days. When he lived in Sapporo, his father was a chief police officer.\n\nWhen he was 13, his father retired and Tetsuzo moved with his family to his father's hometown, Masuda, Shimane prefecture. He studied at the Prefectural Masuda Agricultural and Forestry High School. His favorite school subjects were mathematics and geometry; in these subjects, he always scored A's on his school report.\n\nHe was an active and nimble boy. He joined a school club brass band as a trumpeter. Another hobby was growing plants and flowers. He helped local fishermen in the fishing season, going out to the sandy beach early in the morning and driving fish into the nets. He talked down to his teachers sometimes in discussions, which was very impolite for a school student in pre-war Japan. He was regarded as the most opinionated student in his school.\n\nStarting military career\n\nIwamoto started his military career in 1934 after he graduated the school at 18. Following the advice from his parents to study while young, Tetsuzo left for a large city where he was supposed to take a college entrance examination. He, however, secretly applied for and passed the examination for acceptance as an Imperial Japanese naval airman 4th class, and was promoted to 3rd class 5 months later. His parents were very disappointed, for they became reliant upon Tetsuzo rather than his eldest brother, who was already studying at some university in a large city and would not return to Masuda.\n\nIn 1936, when he was a naval mechanic 2nd class and a crewman on the light aircraft carrier Ry\u016bj\u014d, he studied hard and passed the difficult IJNAF exam, taken by thousands of applicants. He was enrolled in the class 34th Soju-Renshusei (Soren means flight trainee program) for naval petty officers and sailors. He graduated as one of the select 26 young aviators of the class 34th Soju-Renshusei (flight trainee program) in December of that year.\n\nOn April 4, 1936, he was sent to Kasumigaura-Ku (Kasumigaura FR(AG)) as a probationer in the class 34th Sojyu-Renshusei (flight trainee program), then on April 28, formally joined Kasumigaura-Ku. While his training going on November 1, 1936, he was promoted to naval mechanic 1st class. Finally on December 26, he graduated 34th class of Sojyu-Renshusei, was promoted to airman 1st class (old rank name of pre-war Japan, equivalent to senior airman). During flight training school at the Tomobe branch of Kasumigaura-Ku (Kasumigaura FR(AG)), his fighter course instructor was the well-known Chitoshi Isozaki.\n\nIn December 1936. Iwamoto entered Saeki K\u014dk\u016btai (a K\u014dk\u016btai was a Naval Air Group, whether being based at land or on board a carrier) for 6 months of advanced training (termed extended education), finished and next entered Omura K\u014dk\u016btai on July 16, 1937. He had hard training there every day from senior pilots including Air Petty Officer 1st class Toshio Kuroiwa (rank grade was at that time), who was the IJNAF legendary dogfight master pilot. Tetsuzo Iwamoto (called Tetsu in short from his senior pilots) had to wait for his debut until February 10, 1938.\n\nChina front\n\nTetsuzo's ability as a fighter pilot was recognized by all on his first air mission with the 13th Flying Group on February 25, 1938 over Nanchang, China.\n\nAfter combat training, on February 10, 1938, Tetsuzo Iwamoto was led by his leader APO 1/C Toshio Kuroiwa, flying for two and a quarter hours over the China Sea from Omura Airbase at Ky\u016bsh\u016b Japan to the airfield outside of Nanjing China.\n\nHis squadron on the Chinese frontline was the 13th Flying Group Fighter Squadron. This Flying Group was highly regarded and was famed as the Nango Fighter Squadron, named after its former squadron leader, Mochifumi Nango, who had showed considerable courage and conspicuous leadership.\n\nIwamoto's first combat came on February 25, 1938 over Nanchang. His squadron's fighters escorted bombers Type 96 land-based attack aircraft. Chinese's fighters attacked, and the squadron's leader Lieutenant Takuma was lost on this mission.\n\nIwamoto described his first combat in his notes. During the escort mission, his squadron was intercepted by sixteen I-15s and I-16s at an altitude of 5000 meters. Iwamoto claimed 4 victories (1 probable) in the combat. He secured his first victory by firing when within 50m of the enemy fighter. He first saw white smoke, then the enemy burned up and crashed. He was then at an altitude of 4000 m. When he looked back, there was an enemy fighter just behind him. He instantly made a Split S maneuver and narrowly escaped.\n\nHe got his second victory against an I-15. He saw it below him, turned and attacked from its 6 o'clock high. When it was hit, it climbed sharply and went spinning downward out of control and crashed into the ground. He kept his altitude of 4,000 m. He got an I-16 at the top of its roll in his gunsight and fired a burst, its engine burning and out of control; Tetsuzo lost sight of it before it crashed, and he reported this as probable. Another I-15 came down to him from 12 o'clock ahead. Both made a climb and were soon in a dogfight. The I-15 tried to break free of him and made a straight dive. That action made it easier for Tetsuzo to aim. He downed this I-15 on farmland near the airfield. He was flying at an altitude of 2000 m.\n\nAbove him, many enemy fighters were maneuvering. He found one of them coming down with landing gear down. He chased it to an altitude of 200 m and fired a burst. The I-16 was surprised and made a split S maneuver, but crashed at a corner of the airfield. This was his 4th victory.\n\nAnti-aircraft guns started firing heavily, and he found himself in an intense barrage of flak. Rushing to escape at full throttle with a number of enemy fighters behind him, he succeeded in returning safely from the battlefield. His leader Kuroiwa had already returned to the Wuhu airfield, Anhui China, waiting for his return. Kuroiwa scolded Tetsu severely for the rash attacks he made on the day.\n\nThe 13th Flying Group Fighter Squadron was merged with the 12th Fighter Squadron on March 22, 1938, where Type 96 carrier fighters for 1st Chutai had landing gear painted in red and were called Red legs squadron while 2nd Chutai had gear painted in blue and were called Blue legs squadron.\n\nIwamoto was awarded the citation of flying group Cmdr Tsukahara for his extreme courage and conspicuous gallantry in action above and beyond the call of duty as a fighter pilot against intense Chinese air force on April 29, 1938. He made 82 sorties and 14 victories credited in the China front. Tetsuzo Iwamoto became the top IJNAF ace. His activities subsequently earned him Order of the Golden Kite - 5th class recommendation in 1940.\n\nIn September 1938, 22 years old Iwamoto was ordered back to Japan, where he became a member of the Saiki Air Group and appointed to a training staff.\n\nHis flight log\n\nFlying Technique: Class-A of IJNAFFlight hours: over 8,000hrs on March 1944Oceanic Transition: possible, navigating and leading his fighter chutai (without Radar)Instrument Flight: possibleNight Flight: possible\n\nOnly experienced fighter pilots in the IJNAF could execute instrument flight with their single-seat fighter aircraft on combat missions; few IJNAF officer pilots could fly on instruments.\n\nHis tactics\n\nSingle to single dogfight tactic - from losing to winning\n\nQuick roll (Roll Sempoh)Coke-screw loop (Hineri-Komi Sempoh)Yo-yo turn (Suichoku-Senkai Kasoku Sempoh)\n\nFormation tactics -\n\nTwo groups linked formation attackKeeping his groups underneath thick clouds to hide his formation and waiting until the small number of opponent aircraft group coming down, then diving and zooming attack with all in formation.Attacking the opponent groups after their mission over and on the way to the waiting circle, in a group to fly back across the distance range over the sea.

He was summoned twice to Douglas MacArthur's Allied GHQ office in Tokyo. Though he avoided being declared a war criminal, he was blacklisted for public sector employment. Managers of nongovernmental businesses and local factories in his hometown also did not dare to employ him, in order to comply with the wishes of the new Allied GHQ. Those who had been officers in the IJA or IJN were disliked by the Allied Occupation Forces.\n\nJapanese journalists who had promoted Japanese militarism campaign during the war started a radio program of anti-militarism postwar called \"\"Shin-Jitsu wa Kou da (The Truth Is This)\"\". People like Iwamoto were considered the cat's-paws of militarism there.\n\nIwamoto struggled to survive until the San Francisco Peace Conference was held and the Allied Occupation Forces left Japan in the spring of 1952. In 1952, he finally obtained employment at the Masuda spinning mill of Daiwa Bouseki (now renamed as \"Daiwabo\" Co., Ltd, \u5927\u548c\u7d21\u7e3e ). However, in summer 1953, he developed a stomach ache. A surgeon examined him and diagnosed enteritis. It was found later to be appendicitis.\n\nAfter a series of operations, he complained of a backache. Doctors decided to operate on him again. With cause unknown, they removed three or four ribs without anesthesia. This led to sepsis (septicemia, blood poisoning).\n\nHis wife recalled his words, \"When I get well, I want to fly again.\" He died on 20 May 1955.\n\nMovie\n\nNippon Eiga-sha, Feb.16, 1944, Nippon News No.194 Solomon no Gekisen Nankai-Kessenjo (means, Southern Ocean Battle Fields of Solomon)\n\nNippon Eiga-sha, Feb.2, 1944, Nippon News No.192 Rabaul (means, Fortress Rabaul)"}]}
