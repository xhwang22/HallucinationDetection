{"Katie Ledecky is the most decorated female swimmer in World Championship history.": [{"url": "https://onherturf.nbcsports.com/2022/06/22/katie-ledecky-most-decorated-woman-swimming-world-championships/", "page_content": "Li Li Leung joined USA Gymnastics as president and CEO in March 2019, when the organization was reeling from the fallout of Larry Nassar\u2019s widespread sexual abuse and the subsequent revelations of larger cultural issues within the sport. Since then, Leung has seen USAG through an ongoing transformation, one that hinges on the work of the survivors and staff around her, whom she is quick to credit. That evolution, as she calls it, has included instituting new norms and standards at all levels of the sport, particularly in matters related to athlete safety.\n\nAmong the notable USAG initiatives that Leung has brought to fruition is the Athlete Bill of Rights, established in December 2020 as a tool \u201cto unite the full gymnastics community around a shared vision of behavioral expectations.\u201d At the same time, USAG instituted a protest policy for national team members aimed at supporting athletes who choose to use their voice on public platforms. Both initiatives were among the first of their kind in sport.\n\nPrior to joining USAG, Leung served as a vice president at the National Basketball Association (NBA), where she was responsible for building and managing key partner relationships around the world. She continues to use that experience in her roles as vice chair of the National Governing Bodies Council of the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee and a member of the International Gymnastics Federation\u2019s Executive Committee.\n\nLeung, who began competing in gymnastics at age 7, was a member of the U.S. junior national training team and represented the U.S. at the 1988 Junior Pan American Games. She was a four-year member of the four-time Big 10 champion University of Michigan gymnastics team and was an NCAA Championships participant.\n\nIn honor of Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month, On Her Turf sat down with Leung to talk about her journey with USAG, the challenges still to come and how being a member of the AAPI community has shaped the person she is today.\n\nALSO FROM ON HER TURF: Sloane Stephens gets candid about turning 30, favorite self-care practices and freezing her eggs ahead of 12th French Open\n\nThis Q+A has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.\n\nOn Her Turf: Let\u2019s start by talking about your journey since joining USA Gymnastics in 2019. What have the last four years been like for you?\n\nLi Li Leung: This was just an incredible opportunity to give back to the sport that has given so much to me. And I really mean that because I started in the sport when I was 7 years old and did it for 15 years. It\u2019s taught me all of these different skills that I apply to my daily life, both professional and personal. It feels a little bit like I\u2019ve come full circle, and honestly, never in a million years did I think I would find myself in this role. \u2026 I joined at a time when it was a tumultuous time for the organization. It\u2019s been just a little a little over four years now, and it has been an incredible journey \u2014 and believe it or not, I have enjoyed it. While it hasn\u2019t been easy, I actually have enjoyed it, because I\u2019ve been able to make it not just me. One thing that\u2019s important to note is that \u2014 I had even said on my first interview with the board \u2014 it will take a village to accomplish what we need to accomplish. This is not a one-person job. And I was lucky enough to be able to bring on a leadership team that has been incredible, and also retain the staff that we have retained, as well as hire other new staff members. And it\u2019s because of them and some really key volunteers that we\u2019ve been able to accomplish what we\u2019ve been able to do.\n\nOHT: Can you talk a little more about this cultural transformation that the organization has experienced and your approach to tackling this all-encompassing change?\n\nLeung: When I was interviewing for the position, I actually met every single board member. It was really critical to both sides that they felt that I matched the role and their needs and also I had to be confident in the board believing in the ultimate mission of the organization and what we wanted to achieve. So that the culture really does stem from the well \u2013 from the top down and everything in between as well. And when I was looking for leadership team, \u2026 one of the characteristics I was really looking for was they couldn\u2019t have an ego. The job couldn\u2019t be about themselves or about what they would personally get out of the role. It had to be about them believing in the bigger picture and believing in what we collectively wanted to achieve. I knew that we would only be able to accomplish what we need to accomplish if people were willing to roll up their sleeves and just do whatever needed to be done, so that was one of the key things in terms of having no ego.\n\nSince 2018, we\u2019ve turned over more than 70 percent of our staff. We\u2019ve been able to retain the really key members of our staff, who have been critical to our success, but also have been able to really bring in new thinking, new blood, new perspectives. Because the other thing I was looking for when I was hiring for the leadership team was diversity in perspectives. That was critical because I did not want to be surrounded by \u201cyes people.\u201d I wanted to be surrounded by people who would be willing to have really robust conversations and engage in difficult conversations, because ultimately, you end up in a better place because of that.\n\nIn 2020, we reset our mission to be about building a community and culture of health, safety and excellence, with athletes who thrive in sport and in life. So we were no longer about developing technically superior gymnasts who perform well in gym. We reset our focus to be about helping set our athletes up for success with the skill sets that you learn in gymnastics, and when we come to the office each day, that\u2019s what we\u2019re thinking about. \u2026\n\nThe other piece is we also know from a community standpoint that our national team coaches are the most visible representation (of USAG), and a lot of coaches model them. So we\u2019ve been working really hard in terms of working on educating our national team coaches. We work with Positive Coaching Alliance to do educational training with them as well. And we also have introduced training specifically for young coaches coming in, because we know when they come in and they\u2019re new, that they\u2019re eager to learn, and that\u2019s when you can start training and moving them in a way. So our thinking is with this top-down and bottom-up strategy, eventually the middle will meet.\n\nOHT: You noted how the coaches can be some of the most visible representatives of USAG. Regarding the addition of 2008 Olympic silver medalists Chellsie Memmel (USAG technical lead) and Alicia Sacramone Quinn (USAG strategic lead), how have those women impacted the program?\n\nLeung: The addition of Chellsie and Alicia has been fantastic. They have been phenomenal to work with, and the fact that they have firsthand experience of having gone through it themselves \u2013 that also gives them a very good idea of what they would change and what they wouldn\u2019t change, at the same time. It has been a phenomenal addition to be able to have this perspective of firsthand, high-level, high-performing athletes to be able to lead our high-performance team. And the athletes are saying it as well. They\u2019re saying, \u201cWe trust them; we feel confident in their decisions; we can relate to them\u201d \u2014 all of those things that historically haven\u2019t really happened before.\n\nThen in terms of the athletes who are going to college and coming back to compete with USA Gymnastics \u2013 there are so many aspects that I think are great about this. One: It\u2019s showing a lengthened career in a sport that historically has not been very long because it\u2019s so demanding on the body. So that means that our athletes are physically healthier, as well, that they can train and compete at a high level for a longer period of time. It also means that they\u2019re enjoying it more because they\u2019re staying in the sport. From an emotional standpoint, they\u2019re finding a lot more joy in the sport, and they\u2019re talking about it, too. And we love the fact that they\u2019re talking about it. We want them to talk about it, and we want them to have voices and feel open and free about sharing what they\u2019re thinking about. I have to say I\u2019ve been really enjoying seeing almost like \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if I can go as far as a new era in the sport maybe \u2014 but just this evolution of the sport and the athletes changing in front of my eyes.\n\nOHT: What do you consider now to still be the biggest challenge or obstacle for USAG?\n\nLeung: There are a couple of big initiatives on the list. One is we want to build a training and wellness center where all of our disciplines will train under one roof. This is a long-term project, obviously, but my vision around it is that it will be the heart and hub of gymnastics in America. And while this is where national team athletes will ultimately train to some extent, it is going to be a welcoming place for athletes of all different disciplines and all different levels. We want it to be a place where young athletes can come through and see their role models training. We want this to be a place of education for our community and judges. We want to be able to run clinics there for all different levels. We just want this to be a gathering place of gymnastics and to be able to celebrate the sport there at the same time.\n\nWe\u2019re also going to reset our foundation. There\u2019s been the National Gymnastics Foundation, but we are going to reset it and basically be much more proactive on fundraising and development to grow the sport and also to raise more money for athletes in their training.\n\nOHT: Turning to AAPI Heritage Month and being named to the 2023 Gold House A100 List (the A100 is named each May honoring 100 Asian Pacific leaders who made the greatest impact on culture and society over the past year). What did that honor mean to you?\n\nLeung: It was such an incredible honor to be recognized by them, and my fellow honorees \u2014 when I read the list, I thought to myself, \u201cI don\u2019t belong.\u201d There are some incredible names on that list. But again, I go back to what I said earlier: I owe this honor to a lot of the other people who work [at USAG]. I think the really important thing to recognize is that this was not done by just me. It was done by a lot of other people who are on staff and who aren\u2019t getting the accolades or the recognition. But it was an incredible experience to be, and I\u2019m very, very touched and honored to be on that list.\n\nOHT: How do you identify within the Asian American Pacific Islander community? Did you embrace your heritage growing up and how has that shaped who you are today?\n\nLeung: So I\u2019ll tell you a story that I\u2019ve mentioned to other people recently. I grew up in a town called Ridgewood in Bergen County, New Jersey, and most of my friends had blond hair and blue eyes. When I was growing up, I wanted the name \u201cNancy Smith,\u201d and I wanted blue eyes. I wanted to fit in. As a kid, you always want to fit in. Then when you get older and wizen up a little bit, you realize that it\u2019s okay and it\u2019s good to be different, that you can use that to your advantage. And so upon growing up, I realized that it\u2019s pretty special to be Asian American and there are benefits to being Asian American, and you should embrace the fact that you are different. In fact, I recently lectured to a women-in-sports-business class, and one of the questions they asked me was about impostor syndrome. I said the same thing that I\u2019m saying to you now, which is absolutely embrace who you are. Absolutely embrace your differences, because those ultimately are embedded advantages to who you are and make you stand out from the rest of the crowd. So that\u2019s my philosophy now.\n\nOHT: Do you or your family have any traditions that are especially important to you?\n\nLeung: I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say it\u2019s a tradition, but in the Chinese culture, food is really important. Food is what brings people together. It\u2019s a sign of respect, and that is the ultimate unifying language in a way. So when we do get together as a family, it\u2019s really important for us to get together around a meal, because that\u2019s when we share our stories. That\u2019s when we connect with one another.\n\nOHT: You might have just answered my next question, but I want to ask: What brings you joy about your heritage and culture?\n\nLeung: It\u2019s funny, I was actually at a conference last week and you were supposed to find someone you didn\u2019t know in the conference and share a secret talent that you have. I shared that I can eat a lot more than most people think. Food is a really important part of our culture and in my upbringing and family.\n\nOHT: Lastly, I wanted to ask, as we\u2019ve seen an increase in hate-filled actions toward the AAPI community, what does supporting the AAPI community look like for you?\n\nLeung: Well, I think kind of going back to my other answer, it\u2019s just about embracing who you are and embracing your differences. I think part of it is being unafraid of it at the same time, which I know is really difficult. But if you\u2019re going to truly embrace it, and then you can\u2019t be afraid about embracing it at the same time.\n\nMORE FROM ON HER TURF: Laureus award winner and three-time Olympic medalist Eileen Gu on Stanford, elevating women and changing the game"}, {"url": "https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2022/06/22/katie-ledecky-swimming-world-championships-medals/", "page_content": "Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\nClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n\nClick to share on Flipboard (Opens in new window)\n\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\nBUDAPEST \u2014 Katie Ledecky decided last fall to drop the individual 200m freestyle from her program, at least for one year. In a recent interview, she added one line to the end of her explanation about focusing on longer events in 2022.\n\n\u201cI still feel confident in my 200m free and my ability to step up on that relay,\u201d said Ledecky, who swam the 200m free from 2014 through 2021.\n\nAs usual, Ledecky backed that up in the pool.\n\nThe greatest distance swimmer in history posted the third-fastest 4x200m free relay split in history, and the fastest of her career, as the U.S. quartet took gold on Wednesday.\n\nClaire Weinstein, Leah Smith, Ledecky and Bella Sims clocked a championship record 7 minutes, 41.45 seconds to distance rival Australia by 2.41 seconds. The U.S. took silver in the event at the previous Olympics and worlds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to get up for these relays and just not think and go,\u201d Ledecky said. \u201cI had so much trust in these three. I think we\u2019re always counted out, and we always deliver.\u201d\n\nSWIMMING WORLDS: TV Schedule | Results | U.S. Roster\n\nLedecky earned her 21st career world swimming championships medal, breaking her tie with Natalie Coughlin for the most by a woman in worlds history. Two men have more medals: Michael Phelps (33) and Ryan Lochte (27).\n\nShe also tied Lochte for the second-most gold medals (18), trailing only Phelps (26). Ledecky has one more event this week, her trademark 800m free, and then two more world championships before the 2024 Paris Olympics to chase Phelps. She has said she may try to swim through the 2028 Los Angeles Games, which would put Phelps\u2019 records in real jeopardy.\n\nLedecky\u2019s split on Wednesday was 1:53.67, trailing only Federica Pellegrini\u2018s 1:53.45 from the 2009 World Championships, where records fell everywhere due to since-banned high-tech swimsuits. And Sarah Sjostrom\u2018s 1:53.64 from the 2014 European Championships.\n\nIn Tokyo, Ledecky was fifth in the individual 200m free on the same night she had the final in the 1500m free, which she won. Two days later, she had the fastest split of the 32 swimmers in the 4x200m free relay final, 1:53.76.\n\nLedecky said before worlds that re-adding the 200m free \u201cwould be more on the table\u201d if the to-be-announced 2024 Olympic swimming schedule, with one more day of swimming than in 2021, puts more time between the women\u2019s 200m and 1500m frees. The men\u2019s 200m and 1500m frees have traditionally been on different days.\n\nAlso Wednesday, 15-year-old Canadian Summer McIntosh became the youngest individual world championships gold medalist since 2011 (Ye Shiwen), taking the 200m butterfly in a world junior record 2:05.20. American Hali Flickinger earned silver, just as she did at the 2019 Worlds.\n\n(Weinstein, a younger 15 than McIntosh, became the youngest world champion since 2007 with her relay gold, according to Bill Mallon of Olympedia.org.)\n\nRomanian 17-year-old David Popovici became the first swimmer to sweep the 100m and 200m frees at a worlds since the very first edition in 1973. Popovici won the 100m in 47.58, edging Frenchman Maxime Grousset by six hundredths.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a bit prouder of the 200m win,\u201d said Popovici, the Chlorine Daddy who went faster in the 100m free semis with a world junior record 47.13. \u201cYou know, my neck is quite heavy because of the medals \u2013 so I need to strengthen that part for the next meets.\u201d\n\nThe race lacked reigning Olympic and world champion Caeleb Dressel, who withdrew from the meet a day after scratching the 100m free semis on unspecified medical grounds.\n\nFrench 20-year-old Leon Marchand completed a sweep of the individual medleys, taking the 200m by .49 over American Carson Foster, who also bagged silver in the 400m IM. Marchand competes at Arizona State under Bob Bowman, the longtime coach of Michael Phelps.\n\nAmerican Katharine Berkoff earned silver in the 50m backstroke, eight hundredths behind Canadian Kylie Masse.\n\nWorlds continue Thursday with finals in the men\u2019s 200m back (Ryan Murphy, Shaine Casas), 200m breaststroke (Nic Fink) and 4x200m free relay and the women\u2019s 100m free (Claire Curzan, Torri Huske) and 200m breast (Lilly King, Kate Douglass).\n\nOlympicTalk is on Apple News.

She won 10 Olympic medals, 7 of which were gold.\n\nLedecky made her first splash in international swimming after her freshman year at Stone Ridge School of the Sacred Heart in Bethesda, Maryland, when she set an Olympic-trials record in the 800-metre freestyle to qualify for the 2012 London Games as the youngest member of the U.S. Olympic swimming team. At the Games she set an American record en route to the gold medal in the 800 metres. The following year Ledecky set her first world records in the 800 metres (8 minutes 13.86 seconds) and 1,500 metres (15 minutes 36.53 seconds) at the 2013 F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Natation (FINA) world championships. In addition to the golds that she won in those two events, Ledecky earned a gold medal in the 400-metre freestyle and as a member of the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay team, and she won the FINA Trophy as the highest-scoring overall female swimmer at the world championships.\n\nBritannica Quiz Sports Quiz\n\nIn June 2014 Ledecky bettered her own records in the 800 metres (8 minutes 11 seconds) and the 1,500 metres (15 minutes 34.23 seconds), and at the U.S. national championships in early August she set a global standard in the 400-metre freestyle with a time of 3 minutes 58.86 seconds, thus becoming the first female swimmer since American Janet Evans to hold simultaneous world records for the 400-, 800-, and 1,500-metre distances. At the 2014 Pan Pacific Championships, Ledecky became the first woman to capture four individual golds in that competition by winning the 200-, 400-, 800-, and 1,500-metre freestyle events, and she claimed another gold in the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay. She also broke her own world marks in the 1,500 metres (15 minutes 28.36 seconds) and the 400 metres (3 minutes 58.37 seconds).\n\nThe 6-foot- (1.83-metre-) tall Ledecky continued her stellar performance at the 2015 FINA world championships. She captured gold medals in five events (the 200-, 400-, 800-, and 1,500-metre freestyle and the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay) and earned a place in history as the only person to have won four individual freestyle swimming distances in a single world championship or Olympic competition. She also set a world record three times\u2014in the 800-metre final (8 minutes 7.39 seconds) and twice in the 1,500 metres (15 minutes 27.71 seconds in the heats and then 15 minutes 25.48 seconds in the final).\n\nShe put on a dominant showing at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games, where she captured four gold medals (the 200-, 400-, and 800-metre freestyle and the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay) and one silver (4 \u00d7 100-metre freestyle relay). Moreover, she set world records in the 400- and 800-metre races (3 minutes 56.46 seconds and 8 minutes 4.79 seconds, respectively), and the 800-metre final saw Ledecky take almost two seconds off the record time as she finished more than 11 seconds faster than her nearest competitor.\n\nAt the 2017 world championships, Ledecky won five gold medals (the 400-, 800-, and 1,500-metre freestyle as well as the 4 \u00d7 100- and 4 \u00d7 200-metre freestyle). However, she suffered an unexpected loss in the 200 metres, having to settle for silver. At a meet in 2018, Ledecky bettered her previous world record in the 1,500 metres, finishing in 15 minutes 20.48 seconds. Later that year she competed at the Pan Pacific Championships, winning gold medals in the 400-, 800-, and 1,500-metre races. She also captured one silver (4 \u00d7 200-metre freestyle) and one bronze (200-metre freestyle). Illness limited her participation at the 2019 world championships, though she managed to win gold in the 800-metre freestyle and silver in both the 400 metres and the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay. She entered the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (which were actually held in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic) as one of the favourites, and she won the 800- and 1,500-metre freestyle; it was the first time that women had competed in the latter event at the Olympics. However, in the 400 metres she suffered her first loss in an individual race at the Games, finishing in second place. In addition, she won a silver in the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay.

Ledecky currently holds six Olympic individual gold medals, putting her at the top of the best female swimmers\u2019 list.\n\nKatie Ledecky popped into the limelight in 2012 when she won the gold medal at the London Olympics at just 15. The Washington, D.C. native, who made her debut at this Games, has steadily climbed her way up to become one of the most celebrated swimmers in the world.\n\nKatie\u2019s spectacular performances at the World Championships have also redefined women\u2019s swimming competitions.\n\nKatie Ledecky at the Olympics\n\nKatie Ledecky backs the argument for being the world\u2019s best swimmer with medals to prove it. The star athlete has ten Olympics medals, including seven gold and three silver.\n\nLedecky is the most decorated female swimmer, with 14 individual gold medals and 19 overall golds at the World Aquatics Championship. She won her first Olympic gold medal in the 800-meter freestyle event in 2012.\n\nFollowing this, she won four golds (200-meter freestyle, 400-meter freestyle, 800-meter freestyle, 4x200-meter freestyle) and a silver medal (4x100-meter freestyle) at the 2016 Rio Olympics.\n\nIn the most recent 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Ledecky bagged two golds (1,500-meter freestyle, 800-meter freestyle) and two silvers (400-meter freestyle, 4x200-meter freestyle relay).\n\nAn expert in short-distance events, the American also holds world records in long-distance events.

She was 15 when she arrived at her first Summer Games.\n\nThe then-teenager surprised many by beating former long course world champion Kate Ziegler to first place in the 800-meter freestyle at the Olympic trials. Ledecky finished two seconds ahead of Ziegler, who earned the second spot on the team. The young phenomenon left the swimming world stunned with the win.\n\nThe precocious swimmer didn\u2019t have the best of starts at the Olympic finals as she finished only third in the 800m free heats. However, Ledecky came from behind to win the gold medal. She finished with a time of 8:23.84, the fastest in the field by 4.13 seconds in a legendary debut.\n\nKatie Ledecky @katieledecky\n\n\n\nGreat job so far to all the \ud83c\udffc Smile and enjoy the journeyGreat job so far to all the @TeamUSA athletes at the #TokyoParalympics !

She wrapped up the Games as the most bemedaled female athlete, garnering four golds (200-meter, 400-meter, 800-meter, and 4x200-meter freestyle) and one silver (4x100-meter freestyle).\n\nShe broke two world records in the process, and also earned the distinction of being the most decorated US female athlete ever in a single-Olympic performance.\n\nSee also\n\nThis year, she will be defending her titles in the 200- and 400-meter events, and is going for a three-peat in the 800-meter freestyle.

Since then, Leung has seen USAG through an ongoing transformation, one that hinges on the work of the survivors and staff around her, whom she is quick to credit. That evolution, as she calls it, has included instituting new norms and standards at all levels of the sport, particularly in matters related to athlete safety.\n\nAmong the notable USAG initiatives that Leung has brought to fruition is the Athlete Bill of Rights, established in December 2020 as a tool \u201cto unite the full gymnastics community around a shared vision of behavioral expectations.\u201d At the same time, USAG instituted a protest policy for national team members aimed at supporting athletes who choose to use their voice on public platforms. Both initiatives were among the first of their kind in sport.\n\nPrior to joining USAG, Leung served as a vice president at the National Basketball Association (NBA), where she was responsible for building and managing key partner relationships around the world. She continues to use that experience in her roles as vice chair of the National Governing Bodies Council of the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee and a member of the International Gymnastics Federation\u2019s Executive Committee.\n\nLeung, who began competing in gymnastics at age 7, was a member of the U.S. junior national training team and represented the U.S. at the 1988 Junior Pan American Games. She was a four-year member of the four-time Big 10 champion University of Michigan gymnastics team and was an NCAA Championships participant.\n\nIn honor of Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month, On Her Turf sat down with Leung to talk about her journey with USAG, the challenges still to come and how being a member of the AAPI community has shaped the person she is today.\n\nALSO FROM ON HER TURF: Sloane Stephens gets candid about turning 30, favorite self-care practices and freezing her eggs ahead of 12th French Open\n\nThis Q+A has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.\n\nOn Her Turf: Let\u2019s start by talking about your journey since joining USA Gymnastics in 2019. What have the last four years been like for you?\n\nLi Li Leung: This was just an incredible opportunity to give back to the sport that has given so much to me. And I really mean that because I started in the sport when I was 7 years old and did it for 15 years. It\u2019s taught me all of these different skills that I apply to my daily life, both professional and personal. It feels a little bit like I\u2019ve come full circle, and honestly, never in a million years did I think I would find myself in this role. \u2026 I joined at a time when it was a tumultuous time for the organization. It\u2019s been just a little a little over four years now, and it has been an incredible journey \u2014 and believe it or not, I have enjoyed it. While it hasn\u2019t been easy, I actually have enjoyed it, because I\u2019ve been able to make it not just me. One thing that\u2019s important to note is that \u2014 I had even said on my first interview with the board \u2014 it will take a village to accomplish what we need to accomplish. This is not a one-person job. And I was lucky enough to be able to bring on a leadership team that has been incredible, and also retain the staff that we have retained, as well as hire other new staff members. And it\u2019s because of them and some really key volunteers that we\u2019ve been able to accomplish what we\u2019ve been able to do.\n\nOHT: Can you talk a little more about this cultural transformation that the organization has experienced and your approach to tackling this all-encompassing change?\n\nLeung: When I was interviewing for the position, I actually met every single board member. It was really critical to both sides that they felt that I matched the role and their needs and also I had to be confident in the board believing in the ultimate mission of the organization and what we wanted to achieve. So that the culture really does stem from the well \u2013 from the top down and everything in between as well. And when I was looking for leadership team, \u2026 one of the characteristics I was really looking for was they couldn\u2019t have an ego. The job couldn\u2019t be about themselves or about what they would personally get out of the role. It had to be about them believing in the bigger picture and believing in what we collectively wanted to achieve. I knew that we would only be able to accomplish what we need to accomplish if people were willing to roll up their sleeves and just do whatever needed to be done, so that was one of the key things in terms of having no ego.\n\nSince 2018, we\u2019ve turned over more than 70 percent of our staff. We\u2019ve been able to retain the really key members of our staff, who have been critical to our success, but also have been able to really bring in new thinking, new blood, new perspectives. Because the other thing I was looking for when I was hiring for the leadership team was diversity in perspectives. That was critical because I did not want to be surrounded by \u201cyes people.\u201d I wanted to be surrounded by people who would be willing to have really robust conversations and engage in difficult conversations, because ultimately, you end up in a better place because of that.\n\nIn 2020, we reset our mission to be about building a community and culture of health, safety and excellence, with athletes who thrive in sport and in life. So we were no longer about developing technically superior gymnasts who perform well in gym. We reset our focus to be about helping set our athletes up for success with the skill sets that you learn in gymnastics, and when we come to the office each day, that\u2019s what we\u2019re thinking about. \u2026\n\nThe other piece is we also know from a community standpoint that our national team coaches are the most visible representation (of USAG), and a lot of coaches model them. So we\u2019ve been working really hard in terms of working on educating our national team coaches. We work with Positive Coaching Alliance to do educational training with them as well. And we also have introduced training specifically for young coaches coming in, because we know when they come in and they\u2019re new, that they\u2019re eager to learn, and that\u2019s when you can start training and moving them in a way. So our thinking is with this top-down and bottom-up strategy, eventually the middle will meet.\n\nOHT: You noted how the coaches can be some of the most visible representatives of USAG. Regarding the addition of 2008 Olympic silver medalists Chellsie Memmel (USAG technical lead) and Alicia Sacramone Quinn (USAG strategic lead), how have those women impacted the program?\n\nLeung: The addition of Chellsie and Alicia has been fantastic. They have been phenomenal to work with, and the fact that they have firsthand experience of having gone through it themselves \u2013 that also gives them a very good idea of what they would change and what they wouldn\u2019t change, at the same time. It has been a phenomenal addition to be able to have this perspective of firsthand, high-level, high-performing athletes to be able to lead our high-performance team. And the athletes are saying it as well. They\u2019re saying, \u201cWe trust them; we feel confident in their decisions; we can relate to them\u201d \u2014 all of those things that historically haven\u2019t really happened before.\n\nThen in terms of the athletes who are going to college and coming back to compete with USA Gymnastics \u2013 there are so many aspects that I think are great about this. One: It\u2019s showing a lengthened career in a sport that historically has not been very long because it\u2019s so demanding on the body. So that means that our athletes are physically healthier, as well, that they can train and compete at a high level for a longer period of time. It also means that they\u2019re enjoying it more because they\u2019re staying in the sport. From an emotional standpoint, they\u2019re finding a lot more joy in the sport, and they\u2019re talking about it, too. And we love the fact that they\u2019re talking about it. We want them to talk about it, and we want them to have voices and feel open and free about sharing what they\u2019re thinking about. I have to say I\u2019ve been really enjoying seeing almost like \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if I can go as far as a new era in the sport maybe \u2014 but just this evolution of the sport and the athletes changing in front of my eyes.\n\nOHT: What do you consider now to still be the biggest challenge or obstacle for USAG?\n\nLeung: There are a couple of big initiatives on the list. One is we want to build a training and wellness center where all of our disciplines will train under one roof. This is a long-term project, obviously, but my vision around it is that it will be the heart and hub of gymnastics in America. And while this is where national team athletes will ultimately train to some extent, it is going to be a welcoming place for athletes of all different disciplines and all different levels. We want it to be a place where young athletes can come through and see their role models training. We want this to be a place of education for our community and judges. We want to be able to run clinics there for all different levels. We just want this to be a gathering place of gymnastics and to be able to celebrate the sport there at the same time.\n\nWe\u2019re also going to reset our foundation. There\u2019s been the National Gymnastics Foundation, but we are going to reset it and basically be much more proactive on fundraising and development to grow the sport and also to raise more money for athletes in their training.\n\nOHT: Turning to AAPI Heritage Month and being named to the 2023 Gold House A100 List (the A100 is named each May honoring 100 Asian Pacific leaders who made the greatest impact on culture and society over the past year). What did that honor mean to you?\n\nLeung: It was such an incredible honor to be recognized by them, and my fellow honorees \u2014 when I read the list, I thought to myself, \u201cI don\u2019t belong.\u201d There are some incredible names on that list. But again, I go back to what I said earlier: I owe this honor to a lot of the other people who work [at USAG]. I think the really important thing to recognize is that this was not done by just me. It was done by a lot of other people who are on staff and who aren\u2019t getting the accolades or the recognition. But it was an incredible experience to be, and I\u2019m very, very touched and honored to be on that list.\n\nOHT: How do you identify within the Asian American Pacific Islander community? Did you embrace your heritage growing up and how has that shaped who you are today?\n\nLeung: So I\u2019ll tell you a story that I\u2019ve mentioned to other people recently. I grew up in a town called Ridgewood in Bergen County, New Jersey, and most of my friends had blond hair and blue eyes. When I was growing up, I wanted the name \u201cNancy Smith,\u201d and I wanted blue eyes. I wanted to fit in. As a kid, you always want to fit in. Then when you get older and wizen up a little bit, you realize that it\u2019s okay and it\u2019s good to be different, that you can use that to your advantage. And so upon growing up, I realized that it\u2019s pretty special to be Asian American and there are benefits to being Asian American, and you should embrace the fact that you are different. In fact, I recently lectured to a women-in-sports-business class, and one of the questions they asked me was about impostor syndrome. I said the same thing that I\u2019m saying to you now, which is absolutely embrace who you are. Absolutely embrace your differences, because those ultimately are embedded advantages to who you are and make you stand out from the rest of the crowd. So that\u2019s my philosophy now.\n\nOHT: Do you or your family have any traditions that are especially important to you?\n\nLeung: I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say it\u2019s a tradition, but in the Chinese culture, food is really important. Food is what brings people together. It\u2019s a sign of respect, and that is the ultimate unifying language in a way. So when we do get together as a family, it\u2019s really important for us to get together around a meal, because that\u2019s when we share our stories. That\u2019s when we connect with one another.\n\nOHT: You might have just answered my next question, but I want to ask: What brings you joy about your heritage and culture?\n\nLeung: It\u2019s funny, I was actually at a conference last week and you were supposed to find someone you didn\u2019t know in the conference and share a secret talent that you have. I shared that I can eat a lot more than most people think. Food is a really important part of our culture and in my upbringing and family.\n\nOHT: Lastly, I wanted to ask, as we\u2019ve seen an increase in hate-filled actions toward the AAPI community, what does supporting the AAPI community look like for you?\n\nLeung: Well, I think kind of going back to my other answer, it\u2019s just about embracing who you are and embracing your differences. I think part of it is being unafraid of it at the same time, which I know is really difficult. But if you\u2019re going to truly embrace it, and then you can\u2019t be afraid about embracing it at the same time.\n\nMORE FROM ON HER TURF: Laureus award winner and three-time Olympic medalist Eileen Gu on Stanford, elevating women and changing the game"}, {"url": "https://stanforddaily.com/2022/06/26/katie-ledecky-becomes-most-decorated-woman-in-world-championships-history/", "page_content": "Katie Ledecky \u201920 earned her 21st World Championship medal in the 4\u00d7200 freestyle relay on Wednesday and became the most decorated female swimmer in World Championship history.

She won 10 Olympic medals, 7 of which were gold.\n\nLedecky made her first splash in international swimming after her freshman year at Stone Ridge School of the Sacred Heart in Bethesda, Maryland, when she set an Olympic-trials record in the 800-metre freestyle to qualify for the 2012 London Games as the youngest member of the U.S. Olympic swimming team. At the Games she set an American record en route to the gold medal in the 800 metres. The following year Ledecky set her first world records in the 800 metres (8 minutes 13.86 seconds) and 1,500 metres (15 minutes 36.53 seconds) at the 2013 F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Natation (FINA) world championships. In addition to the golds that she won in those two events, Ledecky earned a gold medal in the 400-metre freestyle and as a member of the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay team, and she won the FINA Trophy as the highest-scoring overall female swimmer at the world championships.\n\nBritannica Quiz Sports Quiz\n\nIn June 2014 Ledecky bettered her own records in the 800 metres (8 minutes 11 seconds) and the 1,500 metres (15 minutes 34.23 seconds), and at the U.S. national championships in early August she set a global standard in the 400-metre freestyle with a time of 3 minutes 58.86 seconds, thus becoming the first female swimmer since American Janet Evans to hold simultaneous world records for the 400-, 800-, and 1,500-metre distances. At the 2014 Pan Pacific Championships, Ledecky became the first woman to capture four individual golds in that competition by winning the 200-, 400-, 800-, and 1,500-metre freestyle events, and she claimed another gold in the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay. She also broke her own world marks in the 1,500 metres (15 minutes 28.36 seconds) and the 400 metres (3 minutes 58.37 seconds).\n\nThe 6-foot- (1.83-metre-) tall Ledecky continued her stellar performance at the 2015 FINA world championships. She captured gold medals in five events (the 200-, 400-, 800-, and 1,500-metre freestyle and the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay) and earned a place in history as the only person to have won four individual freestyle swimming distances in a single world championship or Olympic competition. She also set a world record three times\u2014in the 800-metre final (8 minutes 7.39 seconds) and twice in the 1,500 metres (15 minutes 27.71 seconds in the heats and then 15 minutes 25.48 seconds in the final).\n\nShe put on a dominant showing at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games, where she captured four gold medals (the 200-, 400-, and 800-metre freestyle and the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay) and one silver (4 \u00d7 100-metre freestyle relay). Moreover, she set world records in the 400- and 800-metre races (3 minutes 56.46 seconds and 8 minutes 4.79 seconds, respectively), and the 800-metre final saw Ledecky take almost two seconds off the record time as she finished more than 11 seconds faster than her nearest competitor.\n\nAt the 2017 world championships, Ledecky won five gold medals (the 400-, 800-, and 1,500-metre freestyle as well as the 4 \u00d7 100- and 4 \u00d7 200-metre freestyle). However, she suffered an unexpected loss in the 200 metres, having to settle for silver. At a meet in 2018, Ledecky bettered her previous world record in the 1,500 metres, finishing in 15 minutes 20.48 seconds. Later that year she competed at the Pan Pacific Championships, winning gold medals in the 400-, 800-, and 1,500-metre races. She also captured one silver (4 \u00d7 200-metre freestyle) and one bronze (200-metre freestyle). Illness limited her participation at the 2019 world championships, though she managed to win gold in the 800-metre freestyle and silver in both the 400 metres and the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay. She entered the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (which were actually held in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic) as one of the favourites, and she won the 800- and 1,500-metre freestyle; it was the first time that women had competed in the latter event at the Olympics. However, in the 400 metres she suffered her first loss in an individual race at the Games, finishing in second place. In addition, she won a silver in the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay.

Big names pulled out of competition. The host city reported its highest one-day total of coronavirus cases. A typhoon buffeted the region with rain and wind. Pre-event light shows swirled through arenas devoid of fans because of the pandemic.\n\nLeave it to Katie Ledecky to provide a few minutes of normalcy.\n\nThe 24-year-old completed a grueling double by cruising to victory in the 1,500-meter freestyle at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre on Wednesday, about an hour after swimming the 200 freestyle final.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople maybe feel bad that I\u2019m not winning everything, but I want people to be more concerned about other things in the world,\u201d Ledecky said. \u201cPeople are truly suffering. I\u2019m just proud to bring home a gold medal.\u201d\n\nNo other swimmer at the Games attempted a similar test of speed and endurance. The feat looked routine. She spent most of the race in a familiar position: all alone in the lead with the seven other competitors trailing far behind.\n\nLedecky finished in 15 minutes 37.34 seconds \u2014 the fifth individual Olympic gold of her decorated career \u2014 in a race she\u2019s dominated like no other woman.\n\nAfter touching the wall, she pumped her arm in celebration. Then she hugged teammate Erica Sullivan, who used a strong push in the final laps to win silver, in the adjacent lane.\n\nKatie Ledecky, right, and Erica Sullivan show off their gold and silver medals after their 1-2 finish in the 1,500-meter freestyle Wednesday.

That provided an opportunity for Ledecky to win gold in an event in which the outcome was as certain as, if not more certain than, any other competition.\n\nWhen Ledecky swims the 1,500, the real race is for second place. She first broke the world record in the event in 2013, her most recent record is from 2018 and, including Wednesday\u2019s race, she owns the top 13 times in history. No one else is close.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just the victory, impressive as it might have been, that stood out; it also was how Ledecky did it. The race capped an exhausting 48-hour span in which she swam 4,000 meters over six races.\n\nCompeting in the 1,500 is demanding enough. Adding a sprint like the 200 an hour beforehand doesn\u2019t happen unless your name is Ledecky.\n\nKatie Ledecky walks away from the pool at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre after finishing fifth in the 200-meter freestyle Wednesday.

Ledecky fell to seventh place after the first 50 meters and never challenged the leaders. The sight of the woman who has dominated freestyle swimming for more than a decade \u2014 and makes a habit of winning long-distance races by several body lengths \u2014 trailing by such a margin was jarring for the handful of athletes, officials and media in the building.\n\nAustralian sensation Ariarne Titmus, who recorded the second-best all-time mark in the event last month, won in 1:53.50. Ledecky improved her semifinal time by a tenth of a second, but still finished more than a second and a half behind in fifth place.\n\n\u201cBloody exhausted,\u201d said Titmus, who will race Ledecky later this week in the 800 freestyle. \u201cThat was a hell of a tough one.\u201d\n\nIt was the second time Titmus has gotten the better of Ledecky at the Games after edging her in the neck-and-neck 400 freestyle Monday. In that race, at least, Ledecky recorded her best time in three years and the second fastest of her career, and sounded satisfied with the accomplishment, even if it earned silver instead of gold.\n\nLedecky\u2019s first six Olympic finals \u2014 spanning London, Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo as she transformed from a little-known teenager to one of the faces of the sport \u2014 ended on the podium.\n\nThis was the first miss.\n\n\u201cI knew I had to turn the page very quickly and in the warm-down pool I was just thinking of my family,\u201d Ledecky said. \u201cEach stroke I was thinking of my grandparents. They\u2019re the toughest four people I know and that\u2019s what helped me get through that.\u201d\n\nThe sting didn\u2019t last long. The 1,500 beckoned. And so did another gold medal."}]}
