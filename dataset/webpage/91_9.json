In December 2007 Corinthians was relegated to the Brazilian Championship's second division.\n\nThe warrant for Joorabchian's arrest was suspended by the Brazilian authorities in August 2008.\n\nIn April 2014, The judge totally absolved the whole case saying there was never anything done wrong by anyone in the case at all. \"In this case, there is no proof of a single offense, nor is it pointed out that the alleged group ever have had any intention or interest in the committing any crimes,\" added the judge.\n\nMSI and West Ham\n\nIn 2005 MSI was involved in negotiations to take over the English club West Ham United. The plan was abandoned in November of that year when agreement on a valuation of the club could not be reached.\n\nOn August 31, 2006, the Corinthians players Javier Mascherano and Carlos Tevez moved to West Ham United. The following day the club announced the opening of \"exploratory discussions\" over a possible takeover, reportedly by a consortium fronted by Joorabchian and Paul Yeubrey. West Ham in the end accepted a rival bid from investors headed by Eggert Magn\u00fasson.\n\nThe transfers of Tevez and Mascherano proved highly controversial. In April 2007 West Ham were fined \u00a35.5 million for failing to reveal the full terms of the ownership of the players. In fact MSI retained a percentage of the economic rights to Tevez (through MSI Group Limited, a BVI company), shared with a second company, Just Sports Inc, while Mascherano was owned by Global Soccer Agencies and Mystere Services Ltd. All four companies were represented by Joorabchian who had officially stepped down as president of Media Sport Investment in June 2006. However, according to filing in the Companies House, Joorabchian was remained as the director of England incorporated MSI Ltd. all the time.\n\nClaim against West Ham United\n\nIn a compensation claim against West Ham, undertaken in March 2008, Joorabchian claimed that following the Premier League ruling in April 2007 he had brokered a deal between West Ham and Tevez's third-party owners. MSI and Just Sports Inc had initially been reluctant to terminate their ownership arrangement as requested by the Premier League. Joorabchian said that under the terms of the deal West Ham had agreed to pay \u00a34.7 million \u2014 later reduced to \u00a34.5 million \u2014 to cover costs, the player\u2019s salary, expenses and a loan fee \u2014thereby suggesting that Tevez was paid a salary and expenses beyond that being covered by the club.\n\nJoorabchian further stated that he paid West Ham \u00a32 million to release Tevez's registration so that he could join Manchester United in August 2007 on the understanding that West Ham would return the money with legal costs amounting to \u00a32.6 million. That transfer had itself been subject to a protracted dispute while Joorabchian claimed that MSI and Just Sports Inc retained the economic rights to the player and should therefore receive any fee for the transfer, rather than West Ham as the Premier League insisted. In the end, West Ham received \u00a32 million for the player's registration \u2014the money Joorabchain claimed to have paid West Ham on the understanding that it would be returned.\n\nJoorabchian's claim against West Ham was eventually settled out-of-court with Joorabchian engaged as a consultant by West Ham with fees of more than \u00a32 million.\n\nTevez\n\nIn August 2007, Tevez joined Manchester United on a two-year deal in which his player's registration was leased by the club while his economic rights were retained by his third-party owners. Only when he signed for Manchester City in September 2009 was Tevez removed from the third-party ownership of MSI and Just Sports Inc. That deal was reported as being worth \u00a347 million to the companies owning Tevez's economic rights, although that sum was disputed by Joorabchian.\n\nIn March 2009 West Ham agreed to pay Sheffield United \u00a320 million over five years in settlement of the case that they had brought against West Ham when the east London club stayed in the Premier League at the end of the 2006\u201307 season at Sheffield United's expense while playing Tevez, a player they argued should have been ineligible.\n\nJ\u00f4\n\nIn June 2008 the transfer of Brazilian player J\u00f4 from CSKA Moscow to Manchester City was initially blocked by the Premier League while they investigated his association with MSI and Joorabchian. J\u00f4 had played at Corinthians before moving to CSKA Moscow in 2006, signing for the Brazilian side while the club was under the control of MSI. Third-party ownership of players was banned by the Premier League in June 2008."}, {"url": "https://worldfootballsummit.com/5-investment-trends-in-football-for-2022/", "page_content": "Investment, just as we shared on our \u201cgrowth flywheel,\u201d is one of the key pillars that drive growth in football, or in any sports ecosystem, along with talent, revenues, and partnerships. We are currently going through a window of change in the sports industry and with it, the investment landscape adapts to the new market dynamics that arise.\n\nThe popularity of sports helps it overcome more challenging times. Laurie Pinto, Partner at Pinto Capital, shared on this episode of the \u201cAre you not entertained?\u201d podcast, his belief that the sports industry is quite resilient to economic downturns, and that it is usually more a matter of \u201cconfidence\u201d in the evolution of inflation and interest rates that impacts it rather than real economic issues. This is something that we covered in our deep dive into the SportsTech space in WFS Digest.\n\nFor this article, we have identified five trends that are shaping the future of football from the investment perspective and adding insights from some of the most recognized experts in the field.\n\nThe multi-club ownership model: When football clubs become multinationals\n\nThis form of governance is quickly gaining traction. City Group may be one of the most popular examples; 10 years after being founded, they already own 10 clubs that help the brand presence in every continent except Africa.\n\nOther groups worth mentioning include:\n\nOrlegi Sports and Grupo Pachuca, who have recently purchased Sporting Gijon and Real Oviedo respectively, have been able to diversify their businesses into European soil and will probably heat up the rivalry between these two historic Spanish clubs.\n\nNew City Capital Group owns 7 clubs, amongst which we can find Kaiserlautern or Barnsley.\n\nRedbird Capital Partners have an interesting model as they own football clubs like Liverpool and Toulouse but also other sports properties like the Boston Red Sox.\n\n777 partners, who own Genoa, and Standard Liege, have a small stake in Sevilla, and Vasco da Gama.\n\nJohn Textor is a unique case as in only 12 months he has been able to buy stakes in Crystal Palace, Botafogo, Olympique Lyonnais, and RWD Molenbeek.\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f \"Moving into the future, we\u2019re going to see more and more interest from foreign investment in European football.\" \u2013 @mrjordangardner \ud83e\udd1d#WFSEurope\ud83c\udf10 pic.twitter.com/anzo7lZuYo \u2014 World Football Summit (@WFSummit) September 22, 2021\n\nSome of the benefits of this model, as Jordan Gardner from FC Helsingor pointed out, include being able to gradually onboard players from foreign cultures and playing systems into a new philosophy and style. Other benefits that Brett Johnson, an investor who partnered with Gardner on the FC Helsingor deal, points out in an interview for The Athletic:\n\n\u201cThere are benefits in recruiting and retaining players and coaches if you can highlight a pathway to advance within your own eco-system. Additionally, there\u2019s some back-office synergy on the finance, legal, accounting, player contracts, sponsorship fronts to have a more experienced, centralised team handling a lot of the day-to-day minutiae.\u201d\n\nMulti-club ownership also allows for revenues and earning distribution among the different entities of the group. Kieran Maguire, on this episode of The Price of Football Podcast, shared the example of an Australian player that transferred from Melbourne City to Manchester City without a transfer fee and actually never played for the \u201ccitizens.\u201d He was then sold to another club for 10 million pounds, and it was Manchester City, not Melbourne who recorded a profit for that same amount, which is then taken into account for Financial Fair Play calculations.\n\nOverall, as Javier Sobrino pointed out in an exclusive conversation with WFS Digest, investing in a multi-club ownership model allows for synergies and transfers of skills and resources from one property to another.\n\nAmerican investors are betting on the future of European \u201csoccer\u201d\n\nThe recent acquisition of Chelsea FC by Todd Boehly for 4.25bn pounds is just the most recent example of an American Investor entering the European football scene.\n\nIn general terms, Americans perceive European clubs as being undervalued which is why they are entering the scene. It does seem though that they will look to invest in those clubs and renovate them in order to reset them again for a profit in the midterm. Moreover, with the current dynamic in which the dollar is strengthening and the euro is weakening, it is only fair to assume that more of these deals will take place in the near future.\n\nOther deals worth mentioning that have taken place this year are Real Zaragoza, where Jorge and Jose Mas purchased a 51% stake of the club, or Atalanta, where a group of investors led by Boston Celtics co-owner, Stephen Pagliuca, purchased 55% of the club.\n\nFinally, and although it is not necessarily an acquisition of a football club, one cannot forget how Sixth Street has made a big investment into acquiring around 25% of FC Barcelona\u2019s broadcasting rights and, together with Legends, a 30% of the business that will manage Real Madrid\u2019s Santiago Bernabeu stadium for the next 20 years.\n\nSPACS are losing momentum\n\nIt seems like just several months ago SPACS (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) were all over the place and with a particular focus on sports. Today though, momentum has halted as the reality seems that not many of those projects have materialized. According to a report by Forbes, \u201c21 of 33 SPACs tied to famous public figures posted negative returns for 2021 \u2014 and in 2022 alone, 30 SPAC mergers have been called off.\u201d\n\nAnd, as reported by Bloomberg, \u201cof the 375 firms that went public by merging with a SPAC in the last five years (e.g. DraftKings, Allied Esports, Vivid Seats), just 34, or less than 10%, have outperformed the S&P 500 Index over the past 12 months, according to data compiled and analyzed by Bloomberg.\u201d\n\nCompanies changing football through technology\n\nOne particular area that always draws interest from potential investors is that of technology. While given the current market conditions startup valuations may be down versus what could have been a few months ago, the reality seems to be that those companies that are willing to change the game of football through technology end up raising significant amounts of investment to fulfill their missions.\n\nIn this edition of WFS Digest we already covered how Gloria, OneFootball and Pixellot, drew significant investment rounds:\n\nAs the acceptance of web 3 technology by the mass market accelerates, and if the economic environment enables it, one can only assume that these investments are bound to get bigger and more frequent. On this note, Luis Vicente, Chairman at APEX capital and confirmed speaker for WFS Europe, had this to say on a LinkedIn post about the role of technology to enable better fan engagement initiaitives:\n\n\u201cI am also a big believer that Web3 capabilities and utility can be the missing link that will allow sports brands as such, to connect with its community on an efficient way as well as create a dual direction relationship with every member of that community\u201d\n\nWomen\u2019s Football: How the NWSL is leading the way in \u201csoccer\u201d team valuations\n\nAn article about investments in football would not be complete without talking about the huge opportunities behind Women\u2019s Football.\n\nVictoire Cogevina-Reynal already shared with WFS Digest how she believes football is a market of 3 billion untapped customers.\n\nThe pioneering market seems to be the United States, where valuations have skyrocketed over the past few months. As Yahoo Sports reports, the price to enter the NWSL was in the $2-$5 million range. This year though, the picture is quite different as the Washington Spirit was valued at $35 million in February, and Gotham FC at $40 million in July, with star athletes like Kevin Durant, Sue Bird, or Eli Manning among some of its investors.\n\nLeading the way in women\u2019s football investment though, is the American sports property, Angel City, currently valued at $100 million. With support from top-notch investors such as Alexis Ohanian, Natalie Portman, and many others the club is definitely disrupting the women\u2019s football industry with force. The way they have marketed the team is remarkable and this has led them to land major partnerships deals with DoorDash, Heineken or Gatorade and has booked more than $35 million in sponsorships and has been able to sell 16,000 season tickets ahead of its first season ever. The team\u2019s president and co-founder had this to say about the remarkable feat during a Sportico event:\n\n\u201cI would say that Angel City has more sponsorship revenue today than two hands worth of men\u2019s professional sports teams. We believe our kit is the highest grossing of any women\u2019s team in the U.S.\u201d\n\nThus far, Angel City is averaging more than 19,000 fans per game, outpacing 14 MLS franchises, and more than doubles that of other NWSL teams (with an average of 7000).\n\nAlexis Ohanian identified the opportunity very quickly after attending the quarter-finals match of the US Women\u2019s National Team at a World Cup:\n\n\u201cYou had both really die-hard fans and then also, let\u2019s say passionate haters,\u201d said Ohanian, an early-stage investor. \u201cAnd anytime you have something that\u2019s able to generate that much love and that much irrational hate, you\u2019re probably onto something really special.\u201d\n\nThe game of the future will be radically different\n\nWhile it is hard to predict exactly how these trends will materialise, they seem to suggest that the game of the future will be radically different.\n\nStep by step, clubs are becoming more similar to multinationals run by foreign investors. At the same time, new investment vehicles will emerge to try to back these new models and strategies of outside investors.\n\nTwo things seem certain: One of them is that football for women is no longer a \u201cpromise\u201d but an established reality with great business potential. The other is that technologies like AI will play a leading role in taking the football industry to greater heights.\n\nThis article features in the latest edition of WFS Digest, our insider\u2019s guide to the latest and most relevant thoughts and practises from within the football industry.

But if they are just vanity projects for sheikhs and oligarchs, why are shrewd investors such as Nick Train of fund manager Lindsell Train and bankers from JPMorgan getting involved in the business of football? The past 18 months have been a struggle for all football clubs, owing to the virus-induced absence of fans from grounds \u2013 Europe\u2019s top clubs have missed out on some \u20ac2bn of revenue over this period. Still, with a return to near-normality this season, that shortfall is likely to prove a relatively small blip in otherwise strong revenue growth over the past few years. If any proof were needed that football has become a huge business opportunity, then look no further than last spring\u2019s ill-fated European \u201cSuper League\u201d. While the notion was quickly squashed following a dramatic rebellion by fans and opportunistic politicians, it clearly signposts the direction of travel for the industry.\n\nForbes, the financial media company, produces an annual list of the world\u2019s most valuable sports teams, traditionally headed by the Dallas Cowboys NFL franchise. Forbes estimated that had the Super League proposals gone ahead, the two leading Spanish football teams \u2013 Barcelona and Real Madrid \u2013 would have taken over at the top of the table. Forbes\u2019 analysis clearly shows that the dozen top football teams are breaking away from the rest in terms of revenue and valuation. The 2021 analysis is summarised in the table below. Clubs are becoming brands These days a relatively small proportion of the revenue for the leading clubs comes from matchday receipts \u2013 typically around 15% of the total. Even the huge revenues from broadcasting of games throughout the world are being dwarfed by the commercial rights from sponsorship and merchandising. The club is becoming the brand. Stadium assets, too, are being worked harder. Long gone are the days of opening them up for 20 Saturdays a season. They are often open daily for tours, conferences, events and other sports matches. The new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, for example, was designed with NFL (American Football) matches in mind as much as soccer. The NFL games hosted there are sell-outs, with the supporters putting soccer fans to shame in terms of the merchandise they buy. The stadium can also host boxing matches and other sports. It is open for away matches so fans can watch the game and drink at the longest bar in Europe. The rapidly growing popularity of the women\u2019s game is also helping to fuel sales.\n\nThe leading fan of football clubs as an investment opportunity is Nick Train. Lindsell Train has major stakes in at least four clubs. It is the number-two shareholder in Manchester United after the Glazer family with a 26% holding, and number-two again in Juventus with an 11% stake. It also has stakes in Borussia Dortmund and Glasgow\u2019s Celtic. Train highlights the scarcity value of listed football teams. Many are owned by individuals or, in Spain and Germany, fan-controlled trusts. Putting a financial value on clubs is difficult, given that so many are in private hands. Revenue from trading players can dwarf underlying profits and result in volatile earnings from year to year. Accounting can also throw up anomalies. For instance, if a club buys a player for \u00a350m, that sum will show up in the balance sheet, whereas a home-grown player who has risen from the club\u2019s academy will not feature even if he has a similar valuation. Kieran Maguire, who teaches a football industries MBA at Liverpool Management School, has written a fascinating book, The Price of Football, on the topic. Both Forbes and the consultancy Deloitte publish annual analyses of the value of football clubs. They have tended to use revenue as the key metric on which to base their valuations, although Deloitte is also starting to record the number of social-media followers each club has, which is key to gauging the size of the fan base. The amount a club can achieve for sponsorship deals is ultimately a function of the number and passion of their fans. Keith Wilson, a director at Lindsell Train, points out that \u201csports franchises in particular have the power to draw the largest number of eyeballs, making them among the most valuable of intellectual properties\u201d. Europe has gone global European football is a worldwide industry. The major teams have fan clubs all over the world. In most countries you will see children playing in Manchester United or Barcelona shirts. Train believes that the widespread Italian and Scottish diaspora is valuable for Juventus and Celtic. If you go to an Italian suburb in any North American city, the locals will be passionate about the Ferrari Formula One team \u2013 and Juventus.\n\nThe major clubs are all looking for ways to grow their global popularity and brand recognition, especially in the lucrative Asian market. For example, Son Heung-min is arguably a more valuable player to Tottenham than Harry Kane. The South Korean is hugely popular in Asia and has helped to raise the club\u2019s profile there, greatly facilitating a shirt-sponsorship deal with Hong Kong-based life-insurer AIA. Ryan Hughes, head of fund selection at investment platform AJ Bell, agrees with Nick Train that if you are considering an investment in a football team you must think big: \u201cIn the world of sport, it is very much a case of the big get bigger, and the big get stronger because of the power of the global brand.\u201d With the growth in social media and streaming the spoils will increasingly go to the biggest brands. If you fancy taking on the billionaires and oligarchs, here are some ideas. Three potential winners Football clubs can be volatile, with share price movements tracking the performance on the pitch over the short term. But over the longer term, valuations have increased greatly. There are ten European football clubs listed on recognised stock exchanges. For the reasons outlined above I would ignore any club outside the top 12 in the Forbes list, as the revenues drop off very quickly. It is difficult to look past Manchester United (NYSE: MANU) as it is one of the ultimate global brands with widespread recognition even outside the game. It has 141 million followers on the main social-media platforms; only Barcelona and Real Madrid boast more. The stock is not cheap, with the highest price relative to turnover of the listed clubs, but it is 30% below its pre-Covid-19 peak and on a discount to the Forbes valuation."}, {"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/12/pros-cons-investing-sports.asp", "page_content": "Investors in these uncertain economic times are looking for stability and predictability. So consider this investing proposition: You have a chance to invest in businesses that have been around since the early 1900s, and sports franchises remain valuable properties today depending on their relative success and level of fandom. These companies have an intensely loyal consumer base. In some areas of the country, there is a waiting list of years to purchase products like season tickets to games. Most rational investors would argue this is a compelling value proposition.\n\nThe industry we are referring to is professional sports, particularly its franchises and ancillary businesses. This seems like a slam dunk of an investment theme; however, to quote ESPN football analyst Lee Corso: \"Not so fast, my friend!\" It is true that professional sports leagues and their derivative businesses, such as athletic apparel and media conglomerates, have become multibillion-dollar industries. But these businesses are not risk-free, and in many ways, they can be riskier than traditional businesses. Today, we will look at the pros and cons of investing in big-time sports.\n\nKey Takeaways Professional sports teams are valuable properties, worth billions of dollars.\n\nTicket sales, merchandise, broadcast rights, and marketing deals all contribute to the value of a franchise.\n\nPro teams also have something of a local monopoly, with only a small number of cities with teams and a limited number of teams per league.\n\nA prolonged period of team losses, injuries, excess player pay, or a scandal, however, can sink a team's value.\n\nThe Pros\n\nIn economics, demand (or \"final demand\") is defined as the ability and the desire to purchase goods and services. Professional and college sports programs strike a strong emotional chord with their audiences. There aren't a lot of companies that can claim a higher brand loyalty to their businesses than big-time athletics. Typically, this means their dollars will follow their hearts.\n\nThe National Football League (NFL) tends to market toward a more affluent or \"able\" customer base; an affluent family of four can easily spend over $1,000 while attending a single sporting event. If this family attends 10 events per year, well, you get the picture.\n\nLikewise, people spend serious money renovating entire rooms of their homes to show support for their favorite teams and players. Professional and collegiate sports have also successfully adapted to the ever-changing technological landscape that is part of our daily lives. Viewing of live sporting events on mobile devices is growing rapidly, as well as on satellite radio and pay-per-view showings. All of these distribution channels drive revenue for these businesses.\n\nThe NFL started its own television network where it can realize more of its advertising revenue instead of sharing with traditional networks (FOX, CBS, NBC, and ESPN, among others). The networks charge premium prices that their loyal customers and sponsors are willing and able to pay. How many people thought there would ever be a round-the-clock golf or tennis channel?\n\nAnother tremendous advantage these major sports leagues have is a lack of competition. It's simply a tough nut to crack, or as economists would claim, there are too many \"barriers to entry\" to compete with Major League Baseball, European soccer, or the National Football League. There have been some attempts to challenge these leagues, but most have failed. Some sports leagues are also protected by anti-competition legislation.\n\nThe NFL in the U.S. has a special antitrust exemption. How many businesses can make a similar claim? One would suspect that it is a concise list. Finally, these businesses enjoy repeat business. Most people don't just own one T-shirt of their favorite team. They own several. Many families pass down season tickets to their children, instilling further brand loyalties in future generations.\n\nThe Cons\n\nSports teams and leagues are not immune from economic shocks. Demand for sports entertainment depends on the overall economic climate. Prolonged weakness in the economy following the 2008 financial crisis hurt attendance at many sporting events for years. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic prevented many sports venues from hosting fans in person, and many games were postponed or canceled due to illness among team members and staff. But most average Americans view sports as good entertainment that can be enjoyed when there is extra income to spend.\n\nFrom an economist's perspective, demand for attending sporting events is elastic. In other words, a change in someone's income (downward) or a change in the costs of the products (ticket prices upward) will have a material impact on final demand (ticket, merchandise, and pay-per-view sales). These are the hard economic facts about why sports investments can be risky, but perhaps less apparent are the exogenous or human factors that investors should be attuned to that present at least equivalent business risk.\n\nIt seems that every day we hear about a sports scandal more sensational or unbelievable than the day before. These scandals can hurt a sports brand. Allegations of child sexual abuse at Penn State University, for instance, not only hurt the school's reputation, but apparel sales dropped significantly as a result. Other incidents, such as the one when NBA players jumped into the crowd and brawled with fans (i.e., \"customers\"), harmed the NBA brand's reputation.\n\nFurthermore, greed is everywhere in these businesses: Stars in these leagues make much more annually than the average consumer. The point here is that these businesses present risks to investors that are not traditionally part of the business. If a major corporation's employees went on strike, the company's stocks would most likely get hammered in the short term. If the CEO of a blue-chip company decided they weren't going to report to work for months, or hold out for more money, these companies would face serious repercussions from investors.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nInvesting in sporting franchises and the associated ancillary companies that benefit from the multibillion-dollar sports business can be an appealing and profitable proposition. High consumer demand, pricing power, and lack of competition are critical success and survival advantages that big-time sports leagues and teams command. It is also important to realize that these businesses carry unique risks. So, the next time you are at a sporting event, look at the ancillary businesses that support your favorite team and see if they make sense in your financial playbook.\n\nAlso, sports entertainment is generally considered a \"luxury\" and is subject to the economic laws of elasticity. The same human or emotional factors that attract us to spend our dollars on their product can quickly sour due to unforeseen events."}, {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/243f4030-aa2f-43c4-be32-723ba868d27a", "page_content": "What is included in my trial?\n\nDuring your trial you will have complete digital access to FT.com with everything in both of our Standard Digital and Premium Digital packages.\n\nStandard Digital includes access to a wealth of global news, analysis and expert opinion.

Share ownership can help bring fans closer to their team, and could also even bring in a bit of income. It can also be a way of protecting prized community institutions from cowboy owners who might bet the house in the pursuit of glory, only to withdraw support when the sums don\u2019t add up.\n\nThe vast majority of UK football clubs are, however, either privately owned or run by supporters\u2019 trusts. For many clubs, the costs and transparency linked to being listed on a stock exchange are deemed to outweigh the benefits of access to shareholder funds.\n\nThere are a handful of listed football clubs in the world. Manchester United (US:MANU) and Scotland\u2019s Celtic (CCP) are the UK\u2019s two major listed clubs, while German giant Borussia Dortmund (Ger:BVB) and Italy\u2019s Juventus (Ita:JUVE) are among foreign football titans whose shares are available to buy on exchanges. Many of their investors will have no interest at all in their on-pitch endeavours, supporting these institutions solely based on their investment potential.\n\nFootball clubs are not normal companies\n\nFootball clubs are businesses. They strive to make profits, some of which may be returned to shareholders through dividends. Manchester United has awarded a dividend of 18\u00a2 (14p) per share in each of its past four financial years, paying out \u00a323.3m to shareholders last year. The shares have averaged a dividend yield of 0.9 per cent over the past five years, according to FactSet.\n\nBut unlike most conventional companies, they were not established with the objective of making money, or in the case of listed clubs, creating shareholder value. Success on the pitch \u2013 be it winning trophies, league promotion, or even avoiding relegation \u2013 sit ahead of building wealth in a club\u2019s objectives.\n\nTo help achieve these goals, clubs generate income from matchdays, commercial activities and TV deals. As the game continues to grow globally, broadcast deals are playing an even bigger role in club finances. In the 2016-17 season, broadcast revenue growth overtook that of commercial and matchday income, according to Deloitte.\n\nHaving the financial firepower to compete is obviously important, given the critical role that player transfers have in a club\u2019s strategy. Manchester United has of late spent far more than it has recouped in fees. In 2019, it recorded \u00a3187.5m in trade payables, including fees and other costs, linked to the acquisition of players, compared with \u00a318.3m in net receivables for fees from other clubs.\n\nAccounting for transfers is another interesting nuance to football clubs as businesses. Funds raised from player sales do not show up in a club\u2019s accounts as part of its income, notes Kieran Maguire in his book The Price of Football, but are instead often broken out in its profit-and-loss account. This helps analysts distinguish between the core commercial activities of the club, such as ticket sales and merchandise, and the more erratic cash flows linked with transfers.\n\nDo they make good investments?\n\nThese businesses are operating in a lucrative industry that is courting growing interest and inflows from business people in developing markets, such as the Middle East and China. The top 20 highest-earning football clubs for the 2018-19 season grew their combined revenues by 11 per cent to \u20ac9.3bn (\u00a38.4bn), according to Deloitte, which was a new record.\n\nSome institutional investors see the merit in including football clubs in their portfolios. Fund manager Nick Train holds Manchester United and Celtic in his Lindsell Train UK Equity Fund (GB00B18B9X76). Football is an entertainment behemoth with strong underlying demand, which should ensure the survival of its top clubs beyond the coronavirus pandemic. Being listed on the open market could help clubs starved of normal income tap up investors, as businesses have done in all other sectors.\n\nBut listing a club invites additional scrutiny from investors and their advisers, many of whom will want a quick financial return instead of supporting years of sustainable development on and off the pitch. Being privately held may even help to unlock funds from other sources. Tottenham Hotspur delisted from Aim in 2012 to help secure funds for its new stadium. Sheffield United and Hearts are also among major clubs to have delisted their shares.\n\nA club\u2019s share price does have some connection to its performance on the pitch. But sometimes even repeatedly winning your league isn\u2019t enough, as Italian giant Juventus has demonstrated. \u2018The Old Lady\u2019 has won Serie A in every season since 2011-12, yet its share price languished for most of the past decade, before superstar Cristiano Ronaldo signed in 2018. Manchester United, meanwhile, has been on a rocky ride in the past decade, having frequently changed managers and spent extensively on transfers.\n\nFootball shares are also subject to some fairly unique drivers. Tesco (TSCO) shareholders don\u2019t erupt in applause every time a customer puts an item in their basket, but this is essentially the case with football. \u201cIt\u2019s a high-risk investment with relatively low returns,\u201d says Mr Maguire. \u201cYou\u2019ve got so many retail investors who are investing from an emotional, rather than a financial perspective.\u201d\n\nPerhaps there are more sensible ways for investors to gain exposure to the football industry, beyond backing its biggest clubs. New TV deal tenders are attracting the likes of Amazon (US:AMZN), which has leveraged football broadcasting as part of its Prime platform, tempting fans onto its online marketplace and converting them into Amazon customers. There will undoubtedly be more ways to invest in football in the future, via technology and broadcasting companies, which will allow investors to have skin in the game without risking injury.\n\nRead more:\n\nKnow the score: What sporting tactics can teach us about stockpicking"}]}
