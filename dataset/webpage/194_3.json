Energised by conductor Kirill Karabits, the symphony hurtled along at speeds that might have made a professional orchestra hang on to their music stands. Nothing daunted, the NYO responded with tremendous verve and an all-for-one unanimity that made for a gripping performance.

Karabits kept things moving, particularly in the slow movement. The Scherzo was notably fleet-of-foot and the Trio \u2013 with its aching oboe opening \u2013 never cloying. The transition to the Finale was effortlessly natural and the repeated scalic surges, for once, didn\u2019t outstay their welcome.
