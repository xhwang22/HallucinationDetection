{"He was an All-Star in 1983 and 1985, and won the NL ERA title in 1985 with a 2.87 ERA.": [{"url": "https://blogs.fangraphs.com/how-they-got-there-the-1980-1989-nl-mvps/", "page_content": "Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, the game of baseball was much different than the three-true-outcomes style of play that has become prominent in this era. Back in the 1980s, there were a lot of contact hitters, stolen bases, sacrifice bunts by non-pitchers, middle infielders who couldn\u2019t hit for average or power, complete games, astroturf, double-headers, This Week In Baseball, and the San Diego Chicken. There weren\u2019t a lot of hitters willing to sacrifice batting average for home runs, five relief pitchers in every team\u2019s bullpen who could throw 99 mph, or players changing teams much in free agency.\n\nWhile a lot has obviously changed, the game was just as glorious back then, with many memorable performances by players who each had their own unique journey to the major leagues. Here\u2019s a look back at how the NL MVPs of the 1980s were acquired.\n\n1980 NL MVP Rank Name Team Age How Acquired PA HR SB OPS wRC+ WAR MVP Mike Schmidt PHI 30 Drafted 2nd Rd (30) \u201971 652 48 12 1.004 172 9.0 2nd Gary Carter MON 26 Drafted 3rd Rd (53) \u201972 617 29 3 .818 125 6.0 3rd Jose Cruz HOU 32 Purchased (STL) Oct\u201974 680 11 36 .787 124 4.4\n\n1981 NL MVP Rank Name Team Age How Acquired PA HR SB OPS wRC+ WAR MVP Mike Schmidt PHI 31 Drafted 2nd Rd (30) \u201971 434 31 12 1.080 198 7.8 2nd Andre Dawson MON 26 Drafted 11th Rd \u201975 441 24 26 .918 154 6.7 3rd George Foster CIN 32 Trade (SFG) May\u201971 472 22 4 .890 152 3.8\n\nA pair of shortstops selected in the 1971 amateur draft with the 29th and 30th picks would each win an MVP award nine years later as third basemen. Both players, George Brett of the Kansas City Royals (class of \u201999) and Mike Schmidt of the Philadelphia Phillies (class of \u201995), would spend their entire careers with their respective teams and enter the Hall of Fame by the end of the century.\n\nHeading into the 1980 season, Schmidt was a four-time All-Star with 235 career homers. At 30 years of age, he wasn\u2019t anywhere close to slowing down. He led the league with a career-high 48 homers. Dale Murphy was second with 33, while no other National Leaguer reached 30. Schmidt would win the World Series MVP with eight hits against the Royals, including a pair of homers, to help lead the Phillies to their first championship in franchise history.\n\nIt was more of the same during the strike-shortened 1981 season as Schmidt would lead the league in homers and runs batted in while winning his second consecutive NL MVP. But there would be no World Series this time as the Phillies would lose to the Montreal Expos in the NL Division Series.\n\n1982 NL MVP Rank Name Team Age How Acquired PA HR SB OPS wRC+ WAR MVP Dale Murphy ATL 26 Drafted 1st Rd (5) \u201974 698 36 23 .885 144 6.0 2nd Lonnie Smith STL 26 Trade (PHI) Nov\u201981 672 8 68 .815 132 5.4 3rd-T Pedro Guerrero LAD 26 Trade (CLE) Apr\u201974 652 32 22 .914 156 6.2 3rd-T Al Oliver MON 35 Trade (TEX) Mar\u201982 687 22 5 .906 154 4.9\n\n1983 NL MVP Rank Name Team Age How Acquired PA HR SB OPS wRC+ WAR MVP Dale Murphy ATL 27 Drafted 1st Rd (5) \u201974 687 36 30 .933 151 7.0 2nd Andre Dawson MON 26 Drafted 11th Rd \u201975 698 32 25 .877 137 6.5 3rd Mike Schmidt PHI 33 Drafted 2nd Rd (30) \u201971 669 40 7 .923 152 6.9\n\nOne of the most important events in baseball history took place in 1974 when 40-year-old Hank Aaron, in his final season with the Atlanta Braves, hit his 715th career home run on April 8 to break the record previously held by Babe Ruth. Aaron wasn\u2019t the only interesting player on that Braves\u2019 roster. Staff ace Phil Niekro was in the 11th season of a 24-year career, while a trio of future big league managers, Dusty Baker, Davey Johnson, and Johnny Oates were lineup regulars. And the team\u2019s next superstar, a high school catcher named Dale Murphy, was taken with the fifth overall pick in the amateur draft.\n\nPassed over by the San Diego Padres, who took shortstop Bill Almon with the first pick, Murphy would become a thorn in their side for years. He had a higher OPS (.912) and more home runs (60) versus the Padres than any other team over his career. But in 1982 and 1983, Murphy was that guy against just about every team in the league.\n\nYears since being converted from catcher to the outfield, the 26-year-old would hit four homers during the team\u2019s unforgettable 13-game win streak to begin the 1982 season. They would go on to win the division for the first time since 1969. While they wouldn\u2019t return to the postseason until they became an NL powerhouse in the early 90s, Murphy and the Braves were a force to be reckoned with for a few years.\n\n1984 NL MVP Rank Name Team Age How Acquired PA HR SB OPS wRC+ WAR MVP Ryne Sandberg CHC 24 Trade (PHI) Jan\u201982 700 19 32 .887 142 8.0 2nd Keith Hernandez NYM 30 Trade (STL) Jun\u201983 657 15 2 .859 146 5.7 3rd Tony Gwynn SDP 24 Drafted 3rd Rd (58) \u201981 675 5 33 .853 144 6.3\n\nFollowing the 1981 season, the Phillies had a decision to make, as longtime shortstop Larry Bowa was nearing the end of his career. Would they hand over the reins to prospect Ryne Sandberg, a shortstop who appeared to be better-suited for second or third base? They obviously didn\u2019t need a third baseman with Schmidt there, and he was blocked at second base by All-Star and Gold Glove winner Manny Trillo. The decision was made to fill the opening via trade, and it was quite regrettable. The price to acquire Ivan De Jesus, the Cubs\u2019 shortstop for the previous five seasons, was Bowa and Sandberg.\n\nThe trade didn\u2019t pay immediate dividends for the Cubs as Sandberg struggled at the plate for two seasons. But after moving to third base in 1982, he found a home the following season when he was a Gold Glove second baseman. In 1984, it would all come together; the 24-year-old had 74 extra base hits for a Cubs team that reached the playoffs for the first time in 39 years.\n\n1985 NL MVP Rank Name Team Age How Acquired PA HR SB OPS wRC+ WAR MVP Willie McGee STL 26 Trade (NYY) Oct\u201981 652 10 56 .887 151 7.1 2nd Dave Parker CIN 34 Free Agent (PIT) Dec\u201983 694 34 5 .916 145 5.4 3rd Pedro Guerrero LAD 29 Trade (CLE) Apr\u201974 581 33 12 .999 181 7.8\n\nFor a short period of time, Whitey Herzog held the dual roles of manager and general manager for the St. Louis Cardinals. A few months prior to Joe McDonald taking over as general manager early in the 1982 season, Herzog the GM made three trades that would help Herzog the manager. In less than a two-month span, he acquired Willie McGee from the New York Yankees, Lonnie Smith from the Philadelphia Phillies, and future Hall of Famer Ozzie Smith from the San Diego Padres. All three starred during their debut season for the eventual World Series champions.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why the Yankees traded McGee for 26-year-old pitcher Bob Sykes, who had a 4.58 ERA for the Cardinals in 1981 and more walks than strikeouts. The left-hander had shown some promise as a starting pitcher earlier in his career and McGee was a minor leaguer on a team that typically had established veterans in their outfield.\n\nIn any case, it was one of the bigger blunders in Yankees\u2019 history. Sykes never pitched again due to injuries while McGee was an integral part of the Cardinals for several years. In 1985, arguably the best season of his 18-year career, the 26-year-old switch-hitter led the majors with a .353 batting average, 18 triples, and a career-high 56 stolen bases.\n\n1986 NL MVP Rank Name Team Age How Acquired PA HR SB OPS wRC+ WAR MVP Mike Schmidt PHI 36 Drafted 2nd Rd (30) \u201971 657 37 1 .937 148 5.8 2nd Glenn Davis HOU 25 Drafted 1st Rd (5) \u201981 654 31 3 .837 134 4.2 3rd Gary Carter NYM 32 Trade (MON) Dec\u201984 573 24 1 .776 115 3.8\n\nWhen Mike Schmidt made his major league debut in September 1972, his new teammate, Steve Carlton, was on his way to winning the NL Cy Young award and the Triple Crown (league leader in wins, ERA, and strikeouts) in his first season with the Phillies. Fourteen seasons later, the 41-year-old Carlton was released mid-season after posting a 6.18 ERA in 16 starts, ending his legendary run with the team. Schmidt\u2019s career was also close to the end, although he was still going strong in 1986.\n\nEven at age 36, Schmidt was one of the most feared hitters in the game. In addition to leading the league in both homers and runs batted in for the fourth time in his career, he had a career-high 25 intentional walks. After playing the majority of his games at first base the previous season, he moved back across the diamond and locked up his 10th and final Gold Glove in 1986.\n\n1987 NL MVP Rank Name Team Age How Acquired PA HR SB OPS wRC+ WAR MVP Andre Dawson CHC 32 Free Agent (MON) Mar\u201987 662 49 11 .896 124 3.5 2nd Ozzie Smith STL 32 Trade (SDP) Dec\u201981 706 0 43 .775 114 6.3 3rd Jack Clark STL 31 Trade (SFG) Feb\u201985 559 35 1 1.055 176 5.7\n\nWhen a player of Andre Dawson\u2019s status reaches free agency and receives no offers, other than a two-year, $2 million contract that he felt was insufficient to re-sign with the Montreal Expos, it\u2019s apparent that something weird is going on. But it wasn\u2019t a new weird thing going on. You\u2019ll probably find it hard to believe \u2014 no you won\u2019t \u2014 that baseball owners were found to have colluded against players in 1985, 1986, and 1987. In order to keep salaries from escalating, they wouldn\u2019t pursue free agents from other teams \u2014 only four free agents switched teams in each of the offseasons following the 1986 and 1987 seasons \u2014 leaving the player no choice but to re-sign with their previous club without any chance for a bidding war.\n\nBut Dawson wasn\u2019t haven\u2019t it. Instead of staying with Montreal, where he was a three-time All-Star, six-time Gold Glove winner, and NL Rookie of the Year, the 32-year-old decided to give the team of his choice, the Chicago Cubs, an opportunity to sign him to a \u201cblank contract\u201d that management felt was fair and appropriate. They signed him to a one-year, $500,000 contract with incentives in March. It was a low-ball offer, but \u201cThe Hawk\u201d kept his word and signed the deal. Then he went out and proved that he deserved much more. Following the season, he signed a new three-year contract worth more than $6 million to remain with the Cubs.\n\n1988 NL MVP Rank Name Team Age How Acquired PA HR SB OPS wRC+ WAR MVP Kirk Gibson LAD 31 Free Agent (DET) Jan\u201988 632 25 31 .860 150 6.2 2nd Darryl Strawberry NYM 26 Drafted 1st Rd (1) \u201980 640 39 29 .911 159 5.3 3rd Kevin McReynolds NYM 28 Trade (SDP) Dec\u201986 600 27 21 .832 144 4.0\n\nKirk Gibson signed a three-year, $4.5 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers shortly after an arbitrator ruled that he and six other players would become free agents because of the owner\u2019s aforementioned collusion. A month earlier, the Dodgers and Tigers had discussed a trade that would have sent Pedro Guerrero to Detroit for Gibson. Either way, the Dodgers were determined to bring Gibson aboard for the 1988 season.\n\nAfter a stellar regular season, in which he edged out Mets\u2019 star Darryl Strawberry for MVP honors, Gibson limped his way through the NLCS and was unavailable for the World Series. Well, aside from one pinch-hit appearance in Game One.\n\n1989 NL MVP Rank Name Team Age How Acquired PA HR SB OPS wRC+ WAR MVP Kevin Mitchell SFG 27 Trade (SDP) Jul\u201987 640 47 3 1.023 184 6.9 2nd Will Clark SFG 25 Drafted 1st Rd (2) \u201985 675 23 8 .953 174 8.1 3rd Pedro Guerrero STL 33 Trade (LAD) Aug\u201988 665 17 2 .868 147 3.1\n\nThe seven-player trade between the San Francisco Giants and San Diego Padres on July 5, 1987 wasn\u2019t a deal centered around soon-to-be superstar slugger Kevin Mitchell. At the time of the deal, the Padres were well out of playoff contention. The Giants were in third place, but only 5 1/2 games out in the division. If they were to make a run, they needed pitching help, which the Padres provided in veteran lefties Dave Dravecky and Craig Lefferts. Not convinced that Mitchell was their answer at the hot corner, the Padres also included him in the deal to acquire 26-year-old third baseman Chris Brown, an All-Star in 1986, along with pitchers Keith Comstock, Mark Davis (future Cy Young winner), and Mark Grant (future Padres\u2019 broadcasting legend).\n\nWhile Dravecky and Lefferts each pitched well, contributing to the Giants\u2019 first division title in 16 seasons, it was Mitchell who made the biggest splash with 15 homers and a .906 OPS as the team\u2019s starting third baseman. After a disappointing follow-up season in 1988, the Giants would move the defensively-challenged Mitchell to left field, a position he\u2019d have to learn to play under challenging circumstances at windy Candlestick Park. While he might be best known for his famous barehanded catch on April 26, the 27-year-old would have a monster season at the plate for the eventual National League champs."}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/10-best-rookie-all-stars-of-the-modern-era", "page_content": "Also read: 5 'NBA Rookie of the Year' since 2000 who went off-track\n\nBeing named to the NBA All-Star team is one of the highest individual honors a player can receive over the course of the regular season. It is a prestige to be named to the team and is something that every player would set out to accomplish at the start of the season. With the league being so competitive and new stars emerging year on year, it is tough to pick the best players from each conference without any controversy.\n\nMany players in past have questioned the process in which the All-Stars are picked. Last year we saw Damian Lillard, who was quite outspoken about how he felt about his exclusion from the game. This year it was rookie Ben Simmons who felt he deserved a place on either two star-studded lineups. Simmons may have a point. He's had a fantastic season and is most likely to win the Rookie of the Year award.\n\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now\n\nIf Simmons was picked as an All-Star, he would have been the forty-sixth rookie to play the most glamorous game of the regular season. The first was Bob Cousy back in 1951 and the most recent pick was Blake Griffin back in 2011.\n\nAlthough there have been forty-five rookies to play the All-Star game, there have only been sixteen since 1980. This is due to the vast improvement in talent in the NBA and the level of competitiveness that has increased throughout the league as the sport has matured and grown globally.\n\nDue to these factors, I have not included players that were named Rookie All-Stars before 1980. Here are some of the names that fall into that category. Remember that this takes absolutely nothing away from them and most of these players would almost certainly have achieved the same in any era, it is just tough to leave out other names due to the competitiveness of the league and the probability of becoming an All-Star being much lesser through the years of the game's evolution.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bob Cousy, Wilt Chamberlain, Bob Petit, Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, Rick Barry and Oscar Robertson were all named All-Stars in their Rookie season.\n\nNow let's take a look at the top ten Rookie All-Stars of the modern era. This list was made based on how good players were as rookies along with the impact they made on their team.\n\n#10 Blake Griffin - LA Clippers (2011)\n\nBlake Griffin in his rookie year\n\nRookie Stats:- 22.5 PPG, 12.1 RPG\n\nCareer Stats (so far):- 21.5 PPG, 9.3 RPG\n\nBack in 2011, the league was taken by storm. Blake Griffin was an athletic freak of nature and when he was finally fit to play, he instantly made the Clippers must-see TV. He led the rookies in both points and rebounds. He won the Rookie of the Year award and the Slam Dunk competition as well. But the most impressive statistic for Griffin that season was that he had twenty-seven consecutive double-doubles. This was the most a rookie had managed since Elvin Hayes back in 1968.\n\nAlthough the Clippers had a very mediocre season and only won thirty-two games, Griffin's individual performances made him the first rookie All-Star since Yao Ming in 2003.\n\nGriffin has made four All-Star appearances since his rookie season and made the All-NBA second team thrice. He along with Chris Paul and Deandre Jordan made the Clippers a formidable task to beat for the following years but unfortunately was not able to get beyond the second round of the playoffs.\n\nGriffin was traded to the Detroit Pistons in 2018.\n\n#9 Patrick Ewing - New York Knicks (1986)\n\nCharlotte Hornets v Miami Heat - Game Seven\n\nRookie Stats:- 20 PPG, 9.0 RPG, 2.1 BPG\n\nCareer Stats:- 21 PPG, 9.8 RPG, 1 SPG, 2.5 BPG\n\nWhen Patrick Ewing entered the draft in 1985, everyone was certain that he would be taken with the first pick. The New York Knicks who were struggling at the time landed him under controversial circumstances.\n\nControversies aside, Ewing was undoubtedly one of the best rookies to ever play the game. He soon became the face one of the biggest franchises in the NBA and was expected to bring a title back to New York after almost 12 years.\n\nEwing soon showed his quality by leading the rookies in rebounds. The earnt him the Rookie of the Year award and also his first call-up to the All-Star game. In his first six seasons, Ewing was named an All-Star five times and took his team to the Playoffs thrice. But it was the signing of Pat Riley as head coach that really made the Knicks a force to be reckoned with.\n\nUnder Riley, the Knicks were perennial contenders and made the NBA Finals in 1994. They would lose to Houston in Game Seven. Ewing would return to the finals again in 1999 but he was way past his prime and the Knicks lost to the San Antonio Spurs in five games.\n\nEwing was an eleven-time All-Star and was named once to the All-NBA first team.\n\n8 Isiah Thomas - Detroit Pistons (1982)\n\nIsiah Thomas at the NBA 75 ceremony during the 2022 NBA All-Star Game\n\nRookie Stats:- 17 PPG, 7.8 APG, 2.1 SPG\n\nCareer Stats:- 19.2 PPG, 9.3 APG, 1.9 SPG\n\nWhen the Pistons drafted Thomas out of Indiana in 1981, it started a revolution in basketball for the city of Detroit. Thomas had a stellar rookie season but did not win the Rookie of the Year award. This was quite controversial since Buck Williams who won the award was not named an All-Star starter while Thomas, on the other hand, started the All-Star game for the East.\n\nIsiah Thomas would go on to make eleven All-Star games in the next eleven years following his rookie season. He was also the league's leader in assists in 1985.\n\nThomas was also the leader of the Detroit Pistons in the 80s. They were known as the \"Bad Boys\" due to their hard-nosed and no-holds barred style of defensive play. Although they are fondly remembered today, that wasn't the case when teams came up against them and were faced with serious outrage from opposing players, fans and the media.\n\nIsiah along with Joe Dumars led the Pistons to back-to-back titles in 1989 and 1990. Thomas was named finals MVP in the second title run.\n\n#7 David Robinson - San Antonio Spurs (1990)\n\n2021 Basketball Hall of Fame Enshrinement Ceremony\n\nRookie Stats:- 24.3 PPG, 12 RPG, 3.9 BPGCareer Stats:- 21.1 PPG, 10.6 RPG, 3 BPG\n\nAfter the years of George Gervin, the Spurs struggled in the NBA. The 80s were a torrid time for them. In 1987 the Spurs drafted David Robinson who had committed to serving two years in the navy. He eventually signed with San Antonio in the 1989/90 season.\n\nThe previous year San Antonio slumped to a 21-61 record. That changed when Robinson arrived. They finished 56-26 in his first season and became playoff contenders every year from then on.\n\nRobinson during this time had a stellar individual career and led the league in rebounding (1991), blocks (1992) and scoring (1994) all by his fifth year in the league.\n\nRobinson had to wait much longer for a championship though. He eventually reached the promised land in 1999 after the team drafted Tim Duncan. Robinson won the title again in 2003 but played a much lesser role due to his age.\n\nHe ended up as a ten-time All-Star. Four-time first team All-NBA. League MVP in 1995 and Defensive Player of the Year in 1992. More importantly, the signing of David Robinson was the start of a new successful era for the San Antonio Spurs that is still to end (barring a season or two where he was injured).\n\n#6 Hakeem Olajuwon - Houston Rockets (1985)\n\nGolden State Warriors v Houston Rockets - Game Seven\n\nRookie Stats:- 20.6 PPG, 11.9 RPG, 1.2 SPG, 2.7 BPG\n\nCareer Stats:- 21.8 PPG, 11.1 RPG, 1.7 SPG, 3.3 BPG\n\nIn 1984, the Houston Rockets had finished at the bottom of the league for the second year in a row. This led to them holding the first pick in the draft for the second consecutive time as well. After drafting Ralf Sampson the previous season, Houston decided to draft another big man and chose Olajuwon ahead of a host of extremely talented players in the draft including Michael Jordan.\n\nIn Olajuwon's first season, his team saw immediate success by having a nineteen game turnaround and finished third in the West. Olajuwon finished behind Jordan in the Rookie of the Year voting.\n\nThe Rockets did make the NBA finals in his second season but struggled after to build a genuine title contending team around Hakeem. By 1993, he had already led the league in rebounding twice, blocks thrice and won the Defensive Player of the Year Award.\n\nThe following season was when both Olajuwon and the Rockets reached their pinnacle. He was named Defensive Player of the Year for the second consecutive time and also won his only league MVP award. His biggest achievement in this year was winning his first NBA title by beating the Knicks in a thrilling seven-game series. In 1995, the Rockets finished sixth in the West but amazingly were able to go on to win the title after sweeping the Orlando Magic in the finals.\n\n#5 Michael Jordan - Chicago Bulls (1985)\n\nMichael Jordan attending the NBA 75 ceremony during the 2022 NBA All-Star Game\n\nRookie Stats:- 28.2 PPG, 6.5 RPG, 5.9 APG, 2.4 SPG\n\nCareer Stats:- 30.1 PPG, 6.2 RPG, 5.3 APG, 2.3 SPG\n\nBy the time the Bulls drafted Jordan with the third pick in the 1984/85 season, they were in no man's land. They had just gone 27-55 and really didn't look like they were bound for any success. Luckily for them, their pick turned out to be the greatest player of all-time.\n\nIn Jordan's first season, he was named an All-Star starter and won Rookie of the Year. He also finished third in scoring and fourth in steals in his rookie season.\n\nAlthough his first few years were tough in terms of playoff runs, Jordan was incredible from the start and once Scottie Pippen developed into an All-Star in his own right, there was no stopping Chicago. They dominated the 90s by winning six titles. Jordan was named Finals MVP every time.\n\nJordan finished his career as a fourteen-time All-Star, ten-time scoring champion, three-time steals leader. He won the league MVP award an astonishing five times and was named Defensive Player of the Year in 1988.\n\n#4 Tim Duncan - San Antonio Spurs (1998)\n\n2021 Basketball Hall of Fame Enshrinement Ceremony\n\nRookie Stats:- 21.1 PPG, 11.9 RPG, 2.5 BPG\n\nCareer Stats:- 19.0 PPG, 10.8 RPG, 2.2 BPG\n\nAround a decade after they drafted David Robinson, the Spurs once again found themselves having an all-time low season. With David Robinson injured, the Spurs slumped to a 20-62 record in 1997. This led to them receiving the first pick in the 1998 draft that included Duncan.\n\nTheir decision to draft Duncan with that pick would be their turning point as a franchise. In his first year, Duncan won the Rookie of the Month award in every month of the season. He was also the first rookie since Larry Bird (1980) to be named to the All-NBA first team.\n\nDuncan was the leader of the Spurs for almost two full decades and finished as one of the most successful players to ever play in the league. He finished as fifteen-time All-Star and was named to the All-NBA first team ten times and to the defensive first time eight times. Duncan was named the regular season MVP in 2002 and 2003. He also finished with a total of five championships and won three finals MVP awards as well.\n\nTim Duncan eventually retired in 2016 after making the playoffs in every season he played.\n\n#3 Shaquille O'Neal - Orlando Magic (1993)\n\nShaquille O'Neal - 2022 NBA All-Star Game\n\nRookie Stats:- 23.4 PPG, 13.9 RPG, 3.5 BPG\n\nCareer Stats:- 23.7 PPG, 10.9 RPG, 2.3 BPG\n\nThe Orlando Magic played their first season in 1989/90. They were an exciting team but not consequential. By the end of the 1992 season, they finished with a 21-61 record and held the top draft pick. It was no doubt in anybody's mind that they would pick O'Neal, and they did. This pick along with their pick (Penny Hardaway) from the following draft started a storm that no one saw coming.\n\nIn O'Neal's first season he led the rookies in points, rebound and blocks and became the first rookie to start the All-Star game since Michael Jordan. The Magic narrowly missed the playoffs that season.\n\nIn 1995, O'Neal who was only in his third season took the Magic to the NBA finals but were swept by Houston.\n\nShaq eventually found most of his success after he left the Magic in 1996 and joined Kobe Bryant with the Los Angeles Lakers. He won three consecutive titles and finals MVP awards in L.A and won another title with Miami in 2006.\n\nO'Neal made fifteen All-Star appearances and was named All-NBA first team eight times. He was a two-time scoring champion and was named the league's MVP in 2000.\n\n#2 Larry Bird - Boston Celtics (1980)\n\n2019 NBA Draft Combine - Day 1\n\nRookie Stats:- 21.3 PPG, 10.4 RPG, 1.7 SPG\n\nCareer Stats:- 24.3 PPG, 6.3 APG, 10 RPG, 1.7 SPG\n\nAfter the John Havlicek era of the 70s, the Celtics were looking to rebuild once again. They had a tough 1978/79 season and went 29-53 with Bird playing his final year of college. The next season, Bird first, saw a much-improved performance. They finished first in the East after winning sixty-one games and made the Eastern Conference Finals before losing to the Philadelphia 76ers. Bird had a stellar year and was named Rookie of the Year ahead of Magic Johnson. He was also named to the All-NBA first team.\n\nThe following season saw the Celtics draft Kevin McHale and trade for Robert Parrish. The trio formed one of the most formidable and successful front-courts ever seen. They won three titles together and Bird won two finals MVP awards in the process.\n\nBird also won a host of individual honors. He was named an All-Star twelve times and received nine All-NBA first team honors. He also joined the 50-40-90 club on two occasions. The biggest of Bird's personal achievements was being the last person to date to win the league's MVP award three consecutive times when he did so from 1984-86.\n\n#1 Magic Johnson - Los Angeles Lakers (1980)\n\n2022 NBA All-Star Game\n\nRookie Stats:- 18 PPG, 7.7 RPG, 7.3 APG, 2.4 SPG\n\nCareer Stats:- 19.5 PPG, 7.2 RPG, 11.2 APG\n\nAfter Jerry West's career, the Lakers were in a bit of a slump. Although they had signed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1975, they weren't able to surround him with enough talent to make a title run. That was until 1979/80 when they drafted Earvin Magic Johnson.\n\nAt first, the Lakers found it tough to understand Johnson's flashy style and no-look passes. When they figured it out, they were scary. He along with Kareem led the Lakers to a 60-22 and reached the finals in his first season in the league. They faced Philadelphia in the finals and led 3-2. In game six, with Abdul-Jabbar injured, Earvin Johnson started the game at the center position. The Lakers won the match and the title with Magic finishing with 42 points, 15 rebounds, 7 assists and 3 steals to become the only rookie to ever win the finals MVP award.\n\nThis started a decade of dominance for Johnson and the Lakers. He finished his career with a total of twelve All-Star appearances and nine All-NBA first team honors. He led the league in assists four times and steals twice. Magic also won the NBA title on five occasions and won the finals MVP as well as the regular season MVP thrice in his stellar career.\n\nPoll : 0 votes"}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/5-all-80s-first-team", "page_content": "The 80s were known as the beginning of the \"Golden Era\" of basketball. This decade saw the first two global superstars being produced by the sport - Larry Bird and Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson. Bird played for the Boston Celtics while Magic played for the \"Showtime\" Los Angeles Lakers. The two teams led by their talismans dominated the decade.\n\nBetween the two, they won eight of the ten championships during the decade. The Lakers won five times while Boston won thrice. The other two teams that managed to sneak in a title run during the decade were the Philadelphia 76ers (1983) and the Detroit Pistons (1989).\n\nThis decade also saw the debuts of some of the greatest players to ever grace the floor such as Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley, Hakeem Olajuwon, Karl Malone and John Stockton.\n\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now\n\nThe 80's truly changed the way the game was played and watched as well. The NBA hit its record viewership during the decade and haven't looked back since. Bird and Magic were the first two basketball players to appear in a shoe commercial.\n\nWe were also introduced to the All-Star weekend and the salary cap as well. The 80s truly paved the way for our current stars to earn the millions of dollars that they do these days.\n\nSo let's take a look at the starting five of the decade:\n\nPoint Guard - Earvin Magic Johnson (Los Angeles Lakers)\n\nMagic Johnson\n\nWidely regarded as the best point guard to ever grace the floor, Earvin Johnson was the definition of flashy. His fast-paced run-and-gun style of basketball took the world by storm. It also helped that he was 6'9\", which made him an impossible matchup for pretty much any guard in the league.\n\nWhen he was drafted in 1979, the Lakers knew they had a star. They just didn't know how big a star he was going to be and in such short time. He took over the league overnight with the bounce pass being his trademark.\n\nMagic became the only rookie to win Finals MVP in 1980 and never looked back. He led the Lakers to an astonishing eight Finals in the decade. The combination of Magic along with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy was just too much for other teams to handle. He won the title on five occasions and won finals MVP three times.\n\nAdded to this he was named regular season MVP in 1987, 1989 and 1990. He was also named an All-Star nine out of ten times in the decade.\n\nShooting Guard - Michael Jordan (Chicago Bulls)\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nYes, I know he was drafted in 1984 and didn't play half the decade but that's what makes him even more special. Jordan was drafted to a well below par Chicago Bulls. He didn't lead his team to a championship, but really turned the Bulls' fortunes quickly. From being lottery picks when he came into the league, he turned them into contenders by the end of the decade. Only the Pistons and Celtics were able to get the better of him in the Playoffs.\n\nIndividually, Jordan was unstoppable. He was named an All-Star in every year he played during the decade. He was named MVP once (1988) and came second in the voting on two occasions. He also won three scoring titles. In 1987, he became only the second person to score over three-thousand points in a season. The following year he led the league in points and steals. He won his first MVP and Defensive Player of the Year award in the same season (1987-88).\n\nHe also broke a record that stands till date for most points in a playoff game when he scored sixty-three against the Celtics in 1986 even though he had just returned from a broken ankle which kept him out for sixty-four games.\n\nNot bad for a start in the NBA huh?\n\nSmall Forward - Larry Bird (Boston Celtics)\n\nLarry Bird\n\nHe was known as \"Larry Legend\" for a reason. Some of the things that Larry Bird managed to do on a basketball court were at times unfathomable. His shooting ability at the time was never seen before but what set Bird apart was his mind and toughness. He always seemed a step ahead of everyone else on the court and although he wasn't nearly as physically strong or quick, it always seemed like he was in the right place at the right time and when he wasn't, he managed to score anyways.\n\nOne of the most memorable performances he had was against the Atlanta Hawks in 1985/86 where he scored a franchise record sixty points.\n\nHe took Boston to five Finals in the decade and won thrice. He was named Finals MVP twice. He named an All-Star and All-NBA first-team nine times in the 80s and was also named second-team all-defense thrice. Added to this, he was named regular season MVP three times in a row between 1984 and 1986. No one has been able to accomplish that since.\n\nAn incredible career for an equally incredible player.\n\nPower Forward - Kevin McHale (Boston Celtics)\n\nKevin McHale\n\nKevin McHale was one of the most underrated players of all time. Although he did receive a host of honors during and after his playing career, he always seems to be overlooked by fans and so-called critics. The players that played with and against him though, would tell you how good he really was. He was a machine in the paint and called it \"The Torture Chamber\". He was an absolute sight for sore eyes while going to work inside and is widely regarded to have the most number of moves in the post. His defense was even more underrated. He was a genuine lockdown defender and was incredibly tough as well.\n\nHe was Bird's partner in crime en route to the five finals appearances. When the defense decided to double or sometimes even triple-team Bird, McHale was waiting inside the paint and had a ball when there wasn't more than one defender on him.\n\nHe won three titles in the 80s and was named to an All-Star five-times during the decade. He also named in the 1987 All-NBA first-team and was named to the All-Defensive first team on three occasions. Added to this he was also the sixth man of the year twice towards the starting of his career. He also held Boston's franchise record in points (56) for a brief period (nine days) before Larry Bird beat it.\n\nCentre - Moses Malone (Houston Rockets / Philadelphia 76ers / Washington Bullets / Atlanta Hawks)\n\nMoses Malone...\n\nAlso read: Top 10 Regular season scorers in NBA History\n\nThis might come as a surprise to some people as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was also in the league during this decade. Although Kareem had more success with the Lakers during this period, individually Moses was far superior. He won the MVP award in his last year with Houston and in his first season with Philadelphia hence becoming the only player to win consecutive MVPs with two different teams. He also broke the record for most number of rebounding titles in a row with five spanning from 1981 to 1985. He was voted an All-Star each and every year in the decade and was named first-team All-NBA thrice and was named to the second-team four times.\n\nHis biggest and probably proudest achievement though, came when he won the NBA title with the 76ers 1983 and also took home the finals MVP award the same season. While the Pistons also won a title during the decade, it came at the very end of the 80s when both Los Angeles and Boston had aging teams and quite a few injuries too. On the other hand, Moses along with Julius Erving managed to get themselves a title during a period that saw the peak of the Lakers and Celtics.\n\nPoll : 0 votes"}, {"url": "https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nba/news/the-1980s-all-decade-team/hsxyp0oubis51est67xoi12o1", "page_content": "This week on NBA.com, we're dedicating a different day to take a closer look at each decade in league history.\n\nToday, we're checking in on all things 80s!\n\nOne thing we're doing each day is an All-Decade Team made up of the two best guards, two best forwards and the best centre of the respective decade. For the 1980s, we're starting with the 1979-80 season and ending with the 1988-89 season.\n\nALL-DECADE TEAMS: 2010s | 2000s | 1990s\n\nWith all that in mind, here's how my All-Decade Team looks for the 1980s\n\nG: Magic Johnson\n\nOne of the two slam dunk selections, Johnson thoroughly dominated the decade with three MVP awards and five championships including three Finals MVPs.\n\nEven though he began the decade as a standout second option to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, even as a rookie he separated himself from the pack with an iconic NBA Finals performance in Game 6 of the 1980 Finals in which he started at centre for an injured Abdul-Jabbar and throttled the Philadelphia 76ers to the tune of 42 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists.\n\nThat performance set the stage for a decade-long run of dominance defined by his unparalleled unselfishness. When we think of Magic we think of dazzling dimes as the engine powering the run-and-gun Showtime Lakers even though a 20-year-old rookie made it clear from the jump he could take matters into his own hands at a moment's notice. Johnson's approach differed from that of every other star of not only his era but of the one before and after. The 6'9\" playmaker mastered the art of imposing his will by elevating those around him, routinely getting the most out of his teammates and dictating the terms of engagement like a five-star general seeing the landscape and skillfully maneuvering his pieces into position.\n\nMagic reimagined the point guard position in such a way that's never fully been recreated. LeBron James and Ben Simmons come to mind as towering decision makers in that vein yet neither dominates offensively in the same mould as Johnson who could draw five sets of eyes and fool everyone in the building with deceptive eyes and slight of hands. He truly operated more like a magician than basketball player with a larger than life personality to match his mystical game.\n\nG: Michael Jordan\n\nThe second guard spot came down to Jordan and Isiah Thomas.\n\nHonestly, I changed my mind about 25 times which coincidentally is the same number of points Thomas scored on a bum ankle in one quarter in the 1988 Finals, a stage that Jordan never reached in the 80s in part because he couldn't get by Thomas.\n\nMORE: The best players who didn't make the Dream Team\n\nFrom start to finish, Detroit's diminuitive point guard had the more complete decade as he entered the league in 1981 and immediately established himself as the Eastern Conference's premier floor general. Small in physical stature but titanic in competitive willpower, Thomas ruffled feathers as a feisty competitor who would lure you in with a baby-faced smile before cutting anyone down in a moment's notice. He won two titles and probably would have won a third if not for the badly sprained ankle he sustained in that aforementioned Game 6 of the 1988 Finals against the Lakers, a game in which he poured in a Finals-record 25 points in the third quarter en route to finishing with 43 in a one-point loss, hobbled and all.\n\nThomas won more than Jordan. Thomas played longer than Jordan. Thomas made more All-Star teams than Jordan.\n\nAnd yet if we're being totally honest, it's hard to say that Thomas was actually better than Jordan, even in the decade before MJ truly took off.\n\nThe first player in NBA history to win MVP and Defensive Player of the Year in the same season, Jordan's iconic 1987-88 season was sandwiched between two runner-up finishes to Johnson. Even though he came along halfway through the decade and missed the majority of his second season, Jordan still managed to win three scoring titles and earn three All-NBA First Team selections, the same number as Thomas despite playing three fewer seasons.\n\nIt boils down to the fact that Jordan was simply better and by a wide enough margin \u2014 not once did Thomas finish in the top-four in MVP voting \u2014 that he gets the nod.\n\nF: Larry Bird\n\nAlong with Magic Johnson, this is the other stone cold lock.\n\nThree straight MVPs. Three rings. All-NBA First Team each of his first nine seasons including his rookie year in 1979-80. In the conversation for smartest player ever AND best trash talker ever.\n\nThe tall tales about Bird's Paul Bunyan-esque game outnumber anyone else.\n\nThe time he played left-handed against Portland and still scored 47\n\nThe duel against Dominique Wilkins that left the Hawks bench visibly in awe\n\n\"Bird steals the ball\"\n\n\"Who's playing for second?\" in the 3-point contest\n\nThere's a reason his nickname is Larry Legend.\n\nAn underrated defender especially early in his career, Bird made three All-Defensive teams and was a 50-40-90 bucket before anyone even knew what that meant. Imagine a shooter and passer like Bird in today's game with more spacing and wider passing lines. The NBA's leader in Win Shares throughout the 1980s, there's a decent chance Bird would have been even better had he come along in an era that would have magnified his greatest strengths even more.\n\nUnlike Johnson who also had Jordan and Thomas as backcourt contemporaries, there simply is no forward who comes close to matching Bird. It's Larry Legend and then everyone else.\n\nF: Julius Erving\n\nThere's any number of ways to go here.\n\nAdrian Dantley, Alex English, Dominique Wilkins, Kevin McHale... say any of them, twist my arm and I'd probably be fine with it.\n\nIn my estimation, none have quite the case needed to knock out Erving who certainly transitioned into a second option for much of his time in the 80s. And while Dr. J is far more synonymous with the 1970s, he did manage to win an MVP in 1981 and made four straight All-NBA First Teams to open up the decade. Throw in the NBA title in 1983 and there's enough meat on the bone to warrant the other forward spot opposite Bird even if his name isn't one typically associated with the 1980s.\n\nPerusing the other candidates, there's just no one who can quite muster the resume to take this spot.\n\nDantley was a two-time scoring champ and finished ahead of all forwards not named Larry Bird in win shares. And yet he earned only two All-NBA nods, neither of which were First Team.\n\nEnglish finished as the NBA's top scorer for the decade and made eight straight All-Star teams, yet didn't have much postseason success in a West dominated by the Lakers.\n\nWilkins had a similar impact as English, an elite scorer with limited postseason success.\n\nAnd while McHale certainly enjoyed more postseason success than any of these others, he did so with the luxury of playing alongside Bird on loaded Boston teams while coming off the bench for half the decade.\n\nC: Moses Malone\n\nMoses or Kareem?\n\nUpon first glance, it might seem more controversial than it really is.\n\nThe 1980 MVP, 1985 Finals MVP and NBA's all-time leading scorer made the All-Star team every year of the decade and won five rings in the 80s. If we skipped positions and simply named the five best players of the decade, Abdul-Jabbar gets picked ahead of Malone.\n\nAnd yet it's still Malone who won MVP with the Rockets in 1982, switched teams and then won it again with the 76ers en route to winning an NBA title. Like Kareem, Moses made the All-Star team all 10 years and averaged at least 20 points and 10 rebounds in every one of those seasons, finishing the decade with tidy averages of 24.5 points and 13.2 rebounds per game.\n\nHe's the most slept on all-time great maybe ever, a centre that at times played volleyball with himself as opposing bigs simply had no way of keeping him off the offensive glass. Spanning the decade he ranked second in points, first in rebounds and third in Win Shares behind only Magic and Bird.\n\n2010s All-Decade Second Team\n\nG: Isiah Thomas \u2014 There's not much else to be said about Thomas other than he should probably get more love in the all-time point guard rankings than he does from most.\n\nG: Sidney Moncrief \u2014 The best perimeter defender of the decade, he won Defensive Player of the Year each of the first two years it was awarded in 1984 and 1985 and very nearly won it a third time, finishing second in 1986.\n\nF: Alex English \u2014 Here's something to think about when it comes to English's scoring ability. He scored almost the exact same number of points in the 1980s (21,018) as Kobe Bryant did in the 2000s (21,065).\n\nF: Kevin McHale \u2014 How good was McHale at his peak? In 1986-87, he finished fourth in MVP voting behind only MJ, Magic and Bird while also finishing fifth in Defensive Player of the Year voting.\n\nC: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar \u2014 He remains the oldest player to win Finals MVP as he torched the Celtics to the tune of 25.7 points per game on 60% shooting as a 37-year-old in 1985.\n\n2010s All-Decade Third Team\n\nG: Dennis Johnson \u2014 A certifiably clutch player who made All-Star teams in the 80s with the SuperSonics, Suns and Celtics. His eight All-D selections rank tied for the most in the 80s (Michael Cooper).\n\nG: George Gervin \u2014 Another player more widely known for his exploits in the decade prior, the Iceman still garnered three All-NBA First Team selections in the 1980s which trailed only Bird (9), Johnson (7), Abdul-Jabbar (4) and Erving (4).\n\nF: Dominique Wilkins \u2014 The Human Highlight Film engaged in two of the most iconic duels of the decade \u2014 the 1988 Slam Dunk Contest with Jordan and the 1988 Game 7 duel with Bird in which he finished with 47 in a loss.\n\nF: Adrian Dantley \u2014 A lightning quick first step, Dantley shredded helpless defenders as a top-shelf driving finisher inside. Dantley missed out on Detroit's titles as he was traded away to Dallas during the 1988-89 season, the first of the back-to-back Bad Boys championships.\n\nC: Hakeem Olajuwon \u2014 An All-Star from the moment he entered the league in 1984-85, Olajuwon authored one of the NBA's most dominant forgotten postseason performances when he averaged an astonishing 37.5 points, 16.8 rebounds, 2.8 blocks and 2.3 steals per game in Houston's first-round series loss to the Mavericks in 1988.\n\nApologies to: Charles Barkley, Robert Parish, James Worthy, Bernard King, Karl Malone, Terry Cummings, Clyde Drexler, Maurice Cheeks, Joe Dumars, Jack Sikma, Artis Gilmore, Ralph Sampson\n\nThe views on this page do not necessarily reflect the views of the NBA or its clubs."}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/top-10-players-never-made-nba-all-star-team", "page_content": "Not making an NBA All-star team is not always a case of a player's lack of pedigree or quality.

So one can see that an ASG selection is not always dependent on the quality of a player.\n\nOn that note, let's have a look at the top 10 players who were conspicuous by their absence in an All-Star roster.\n\n#10 Sam Perkins\n\nSam Perkins with the Seattle Supersonics\n\nThough Sam Perkins ventured deep into the NBA Playoffs on numerous occasions and was part of great teams, he was never selected to an NBA All-star team, which was really unfortunate.\n\nDuring his 17-year NBA career, Perkins excelled for the Dallas Mavericks and the LA Lakers but an All-Star selection remained elusive for the player.\n\nTune in at 11:00am/et on @NBA as Caron Butler (@realtuffjuice) sits down 1-on-1 with NBA Legend Sam Perkins to discuss the murder of George Floyd, Black Americans encounters with law enforcement & the need to educate our youth on America\u2019s history of racial oppression. #NBAVoices pic.twitter.com/4GI9AB7CGM \u2014 NBA (@NBA) August 6, 2020\n\nFrom 1985-86, the then 24-year-old averaged 15 points and eight rebounds on 47% from the field for eight seasons. These were solid numbers, but apparently not NBA All-star worthy.\n\nPerkins was usually the third or fifth-best option in his team. Of course, that was because he had the likes of Mark Aguirre, Rolando Blackman, Adrian Dantley, Derek Harper, Magic Johnson, James Worthy and Byron Scott as his teammates.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n#9 Marcus Camby\n\nSan Antonio Spurs vs New York Knicks\n\nMarcus Camby's defensive abilities were highly renowned in the NBA as he was selected four times to the All-defensive NBA teams during his career and also won one NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. However, like the others in this list, he never made an NBA All-Star team.\n\nNot making an NBA All-star game in 17 years did not mean that Camby's career was lackluster; it was perhaps a case of good but not good enough.\n\nIf his progression would have been a little better and he was able to build from the great rookie season he had (career-high 14.8 points), things could have been different for him. Camby never played in outstanding teams; he reached the NBA Finals in 1999, but his New York Knicks team were an eight-seed that got hot during the Playoffs.\n\nCamby's best season was in 2006-07 with the Denver Nuggets for whom he averaged a double-double and won the Defensive Player of the Year recognition.\n\n#8 Mike Bibby\n\nMike Bibby's last chance for a ring was with the Miami Heat.\n\nThough Mike Bibby was the main playmaker for a thrilling and dynamic Sacramento Kings team, he had no selections in an NBA All-star game during his career; like with many others in this list, it was probably a case of bad timing instead of repeated snubs.\n\nBibby was a solid player in the NBA, at least from the numbers' standpoint. From his rookie year in the 1998-99 season to the 2006-07 campaign, he averaged 16.8 points and six assists per game on 44% shooting and 37% from three.\n\nHis best NBA season was in 2005-06 when he made 21 points and five assists per game. But the Western Conference All-star team that season had the likes of Steve Nash, Tony Parker, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady and Ray Allen in the guard position, which meant that Bibby missed out.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n#7 Arvydas Sabonis\n\nArvydas Sabonis\n\nArvydas Sabonis' NBA career might have started at the wrong time as he was 31 and probably not at his physical peak at the start of the 1995-96 season.\n\nNevertheless, Sabonis was a solid basketball player in the NBA as was the case during his superstar career in Europe. The big Lithuanian man played seven NBA seasons and averaged 12 points and seven rebounds on 50% shooting. He had his best NBA season in 1997-98 when he averaged a double-double with 16 points and ten rebounds, numbers that were certainly worthy of being an NBA All-star player.\n\nHowever, the big-man cast in the Western Conference NBA All-Star in 1998 comprised of Shaquille O'Neal, David Robinson, Kevin Garnett, Karl Malone and Tim Duncan. The only player whom Sabonis could have beaten for a spot in that All-Star team was Seattle Supersonics' Vin Baker, but Baker had better numbers than Sabonis, and Seattle was a top-2 seed in the West.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n#6 Toni Kukoc\n\nToni Kukoc won three NBA titles with the Bulls from 1996 to 1998.\n\nThree-time NBA champion with the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls, Toni Kukoc, who was stellar when his team needed him, was a solid NBA talent but not quite an NBA All-star.\n\nThe best of Toni Kukoc with the @chicagobulls!Watch the final episodes of The Last Dance Sunday, May 17 at 9 PM ET on ESPN. pic.twitter.com/BBkg11x84A \u2014 NBA (@NBA) May 13, 2020\n\nKukoc's career numbers in the NBA were 11.6 points, four rebounds and four assists per game; he started 259 of his 846 games in the competition.\n\nHe won the 1995-96 NBA Sixth Man of the Year award when the Bulls won 72 games, but his personal best season was in 1998-99 when he averaged 18.8 points, seven rebounds and five assists per game.\n\nThere was no NBA All-star game during that shortened lockout season. Besides, the Bulls were an underwhelming team and were not in the spotlight anymore after Jordan retired for the second time. So Kukoc's chances of an All-Star selection were slim anyway.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n#5 Byron Scott\n\nBryan Scott won three championships with the LA Lakers.\n\nByron Scott was a solid player for the 1980s LA Lakers, but he could never find a spot in an NBA All-star game.\n\n\"I'm honored to call you a friend and honored to have coached you\" - @Lakers Coach Byron Scott on Kobe pic.twitter.com/qW78VQ6G9l \u2014 NBA (@NBA) April 14, 2016\n\nSince entering the league with Arizona State in 1983-84, Scott averaged 16 points, three rebounds and three assists per game, but an NBA All-star spot remained elusive for him.\n\nHis career-best came in the 1987-88 season when he averaged 21 points, four rebounds and four assists while playing 81 games on 52% shooting, numbers that could have merited an NBA All-star selection for most players.\n\nHowever, the eventual 1988 NBA champions LA Lakers already had three NBA All-star players in Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy, making it tough for Scott to get in. Still, Scott probably should have been in the NBA All-Star team in place of Alvin Robertson, but the San Antonio Spurs' guard got in despite having stats that were arguably inferior to Scott's.\n\n#4 Purvis Short\n\nPurvis Short was a solid scorer in the NBA.\n\nPurvis Short's presence in this list is not a case of the player having a better career than the likes of Toni Kukoc, Arvydas Sabonis or Byron Scott. However, his 1984-85 season with the Golden State Warriors, a struggling team back then, should have merited him an NBA All-star spot\n\nShort averaged 28 points per game with the Warriors, with five rebounds and three assists per game. While the Warriors only won 22 games that campaign, Short's season was stunning. However, the West's small forwards in the NBA All-star that season were Adrian Dantley and Alex English, two members of the Hall of Fame.\n\nShort career averages were not poor either; he averaged 17 points, four rebounds, and three assists on 47% shooting.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n#3 Ron Harper\n\nRon Harper with the Cavs\n\nThough Ron Harper is remembered for winning five NBA titles with the Chicago Bulls and the LA Lakers from 1996 to 2001, he was practically a 20-5-5 player in the first eight years of his career, though those years did not include team success.\n\nWith the Cleveland Cavaliers and the LA Clippers, Harper had averages of 19 points, five rebounds and five assists per game in 532 games, numbers that could have brought him an NBA All-star appearance.\n\nHis best season was in the 1989-90 campaign when he started with Cleveland and then was traded to the Clippers for Danny Ferry and Reggie Williams. During that campaign, he averaged 22.8 points, six rebounds and five assists per game.\n\nNevertheless, he did not appear in the NBA All-star game as the guards for the West comprised of the likes of Magic Johnson, Clyde Drexler, John Stockton, Chris Mullin, Kevin Johnson and even Fat Lever and Rolando Blackman.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n#2 Rod Strickland\n\nRod Strickland was a great finisher close to the basket.\n\nRod Strickland was known for his unique finishes around the basket and for being a highly talented dribbler. However, an NBA All-star appearance never happened for the talented point guard.\n\nStrickland's career averages - 13 points and seven assists per game - were impressive during his 16-year career, and he had tremendous seasons during his peak.\n\nHis best years were between 1990 and 1999 when he put up numbers of 16 points and nine assists per game. He even led the league in assists in the 1997-98 season with 18 points, 10 assists and five rebounds per game, but the Washington Wizards missed the NBA Playoffs by just one game.\n\nDuring the 1998 NBA ASG, the guards for the East were Michael Jordan, Penny Hardaway, Reggie Miller, Tim Hardaway and Steve Smith, which meant that despite his style of play and touch, Strickland missed out.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n#1 Cedric Maxwell\n\nLarry Bird and Cedric Maxwell\n\nFrom 1978 to 1982, Cedric Maxwell averaged 16.5 points per game in the small forward position on 58% shooting.\n\nDuring that stretch, Maxwell was the 1981 NBA Finals MVP with the Boston Celtics, averaging 18 points and ten rebounds per game while leading the team in both categories. However, there was no NBA All-star game for him despite conjuring such numbers for a big team.\n\nMaxwell had his best year in his second season in the NBA when he averaged 19 points and ten rebounds per game while leading the league in FG with 58% and in offensive rating with 121. Surely an NBA All-star appearance could have been in the cards but was not to be.\n\nDuring that year, he probably deserved NBA All-star recognition, but the timing was not right for him as the two leading small forwards in the East at the time were Julius Erving and George Gervin who played in the semi-finals that year and made the NBA All-star team as well.\n\nMost of the other small forwards during that year's NBA All-star game - Bob Dandridge or Campy Russell for example - had better numbers than Maxwell. The timing was just not right for him.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nPoll : 0 votes"}, {"url": "https://www.nhl.com/islanders/news/timeline-islanders-at-the-nhl-all-star-game/c-304142026", "page_content": "The Islanders have a history of success at the mid-season showcase, taking home MVPs, tying league records and winning skills competitions.

But even if he does so incredibly well, fate can sometimes have a way of intervening.\n\nJacob deGrom's 2018 campaign serves as another reminder that pitcher wins are far from a tell-all statistic when it comes to evaluating performance. After a scoreless 10-strikeout performance in the Mets' 3-0 win over the Braves on Wednesday, deGrom likely finishes the year with a 10-9 record despite his Major League-low 1.70 ERA.\n\nTen wins out of 32 starts is a mind-boggling low total for a pitcher who has been as dominant as deGrom. But how does it stack up to ERA champions throughout Major League history?\n\nBelow are the 10 league ERA leaders who collected the fewest wins in a season in baseball's modern era. This list includes regular starting pitchers only -- those who started at least 75 percent of the games they pitched in the relevant seasons -- and includes full seasons only (not, for example, the strike-shortened 1981 and '94 seasons). To qualify for the ERA title, a pitcher must average at least one inning pitched per team game for the season. Pitchers marked with an asterisk () led the Majors in ERA, not just their own league.\n\n1. Joe Magrane, Cardinals, 1988: Five wins\n\nSeason stats: 5-9, 2.18 ERA\n\nMagrane had finished third in NL Rookie of the Year Award voting in 1987 (Benito Santiago won) after going 9-7 with a 3.54 ERA in 27 games and helping St. Louis win the NL East. As a sophomore, he was even better\u2026 except in the win-loss column. Magrane led the Majors with a 2.18 ERA in 165 1/3 innings, but the left-hander was just 5-9 in his 24 starts for a Cardinals team that went from first in the East to fifth, finishing 76-86 a year after going 95-67. The next season, with a higher ERA (2.91) but a much better record (18-9), Magrane would tie for fourth in NL Cy Young Award voting.\n\n2 (tie). Nolan Ryan, Astros, 1987: Eight wins\n\nSeason stats: 8-16, 2.76 ERA\n\nRyan was 40 years old in 1987, but that didn't stop him from leading the NL in ERA and the Major Leagues in strikeouts (with 270). But the Astros scuffled to a 76-86 third-place finish in the NL West a year after winning the division and making it to the NL Championship Series, and Ryan's record suffered along with the team's. Seven of his 16 losses came in quality starts (at least six innings pitched with no more than three earned runs allowed). Ryan's winning percentage of .333 in '87 is the lowest ever for a league ERA champ. He still finished fifth in the NL Cy Young Award voting that year.\n\n2 (tie). Ed Siever, Tigers, 1902: Eight wins\n\nSeason stats: 8-11, 1.91 ERA\n\nBaseball was a much different game at the turn of the 20th century, of course, and the American League was only in its second year of existence when Siever led the Junior Circuit with a 1.91 ERA. But the left-hander was pitching for a Detroit team that finished seventh in the eight-team league at 52-83 while scoring the fewest runs of any AL club by a wide margin -- its 566 runs were 53 behind the St. Louis Browns. Siever took one especially famous loss in a pitchers' duel with Hall of Famer Rube Waddell (who is about to make an appearance on this list himself). Siever and Waddell both tossed 12 scoreless innings on Aug. 11, 1902, until Waddell himself tripled in the 13th and scored the game's only run.\n\n2 (tie). Rube Waddell*, Pirates, 1900: Eight wins\n\nSeason stats: 8-13, 2.37 ERA\n\nThis was Waddell's first year in the NL, which went from 12 to eight teams in 1900. Several stars -- including Hall of Famers Waddell, Honus Wagner and Fred Clarke -- went from the Louisville Colonels to the Pirates as part of the contraction. In his debut season in Pittsburgh, the 23-year-old Waddell led the Senior Circuit with a 2.37 ERA in 208 2/3 innings, but he finished with a record well below .500, even as the Bucs as a team went 79-60 and finished second to Brooklyn. Waddell would go on to flourish with the Philadelphia Athletics as one of the premier strikeout artists of the Dead Ball era.\n\n5 (tie). Kevin Millwood, Indians, 2005: Nine wins\n\nSeason stats: 9-11, 2.86 ERA\n\nMillwood was only in Cleveland for one season, but he spent that year winning the AL ERA crown. Even with a sub-3 ERA, Millwood's record stood at 9-11 at season's end. He didn't get much support from his offense -- the Indians averaged just 3.6 runs in the 30 games Millwood started, the lowest run support of his career to that point. They scored two runs or fewer 13 times. But the 30-year-old did manage to tie for sixth in the AL Cy Young Award voting.\n\n5 (tie). Craig Swan, Mets, 1978: Nine wins\n\nSeason stats: 9-6, 2.43 ERA\n\ndeGrom isn't the first Mets hurler to see his ERA not translate to the win column, as Swan pitched to an NL-best 2.43 ERA over 29 games without reaching double-digit wins. The main culprit was no-decisions: Swan had 14 of them, despite posting an ERA of 2.13 in those games. The Mets struggled as a team, finishing in last place in the NL East with a league-worst 66-96 record. Swan didn't even receive an NL Cy Young Award vote.\n\n7 (tie). Jacob deGrom, Mets, 2018: 10 wins\n\nSeason stats: 10-9, 1.70 ERA\n\ndeGrom's campaign becomes more incredible the further one digs in, from his record 29 straight games allowing three runs or fewer to his 11 games with double-digit strikeouts to the fact that his season-end ERA ranked more than a half-run better than the rest of his qualified competitors in the NL. The trouble was that the Mets hardly ever gave him run support; the starting pitchers who opposed deGrom in 2018 combined for a 2.45 ERA. Still, deGrom's contributions were enough to lead all Senior Circuit players in wins above replacement (WAR), per FanGraphs.\n\n7 (tie). Atlee Hammaker*, Giants, 1983: 10 wins\n\nSeason stats: 10-9, 2.25 ERA\n\nThis was the best season of Hammaker's career. The 25-year-old left-hander was a breakout All-Star, and he finished the season with a Major League-best 2.25 ERA in 172 1/3 inning over 23 starts. But he only won one more game than he lost. Hammaker's toughest losses that season came on May 22, when the only two runs he allowed in eight innings were unearned and the Giants lost to the Expos, 2-0; and on July 2, when he pitched into the 10th inning against the Padres only for the walk-off run to score on an error by San Francisco shortstop Johnnie LeMaster.\n\n7 (tie). Dick Donovan*, Senators, 1961: 10 wins\n\nSeason stats: 10-10, 2.40 ERA\n\nDonovan came to the Senators from the White Sox in 1961, and in his only season with Washington, he won his only career ERA title. But Donovan didn't finish with a winning record, although he did well to battle back from starting 0-5 despite a 3.29 ERA in that stretch. The Senators finished tied for last in the AL with a 61-100 record that year, but for his excellent pitching, Donovan got an All-Star nod and showed up on a few AL MVP Award ballots."}, {"url": "https://www.mlb.com/news/al-nl-reliever-of-the-year-2018-finalists-c297963156", "page_content": "The Mariano Rivera American League Reliever of the Year Award and the Trevor Hoffman National League Reliever of the Year Award, both presented by The Hartford, are scheduled to be presented Oct. 27 at Game 4 of the 114th World Series.\n\nFrom now until 11:59 p.m. ET on Oct. 26 -- the date for World Series Game 3 -- you can submit a pair of names at MLB.com to determine who the fans believe should be the winners.

This sparked many interesting debates about the merits of those that were on or those that were left off the list. While HSAC is not 75 years old (founded in 2006), this inspired us to examine the best basketball players of all-time. As the NBA media is about to reveal their First, Second, and Third Team selections for this season, we at HSAC will declare our own. But not for the past year \u2013 the past 40. We set out to create an NBA All-Decade team for each decade since the 1980s using a statistical approach and quantifiable metrics to back up our picks.\n\nMethodology\n\nWith the availability of many statistics, we tried to create a \u201ccatch-all\u201d metric showing how good each player was. Using z-scores, we compared where each player ranks in different widely available and \u201cimportant\u201d statistics separating by decade. Z-scores show how far a player\u2019s individual stat is from the average of the group and adjust for variation in the data. For example, consider two point guards, one who averaged 25 points per game in the 1980s and the other who averaged 30 points per game in the 2010s. Both were leading scorers in their time, so if you were to compare the 80s point guard with the modern one, his scoring would seem less impressive. This is a hypothetical situation, but the z-score allows us to compare across decades since it adjusts for certain eras being skewed towards certain statistics. As the NBA has changed over time (much higher scoring environment today), using z-scores allows us to compare within and across decades who were the best players. We implemented a similar approach looking at the best NFL quarterbacks, running backs, and wide receivers of all-time.\n\nWe selected our teams similar to All-NBA and All-Star team selections with two backcourt players (guards) and three frontcourt players (forwards and centers). For the backcourt, we computed a standardized z-score and then rescaled them from 0-100 for seven statistics (per game): 1) points, 2) assists, 3) rebounds, 4) steals, 5) win shares (an advanced metric that measures how much a player contributes to winning, 6) assist/turnover ratio, 7) true shooting percentage (shooting efficiency metric taking into account field goals, three-pointers, and free-throws). The previous stats are the same used for frontcourt players except substituting blocks for steals. From these seven standardized scores on a scale of 0-100, we computed a weighted average putting more stock in the \u201cprimary stats\u201d (points, assists, win shares, true shooting) than the secondary stats. We then ranked the players in each decade based on their weighted average scores to select a First, Second, and Third All-NBA team for each decade from 1980-2020.\n\nCaveats\n\nWhile we took a holistic approach to selecting our teams, there are other methods that would result in a different list. The seven statistics we chose are widely understood, recognized, and available metrics. Today, there are more advanced ones and some that rely on tracking data such as RAPM, DARKO, RAPTOR WAR, and more. Additionally, we did have a weighted criteria but one might choose different weights believing steals should be worth more. Facing a similar problem as modern day analytics, it is hard to quantify a player\u2019s defensive value and our statistical criteria focuses more on offensive than defensive production. Because we are using concrete statistical criteria, there will inevitably be players that rise higher on the list than expected due to putting up gaudy numbers in one area. This is not a \u201cbe-all and end-all\u201d list for the best basketball players of all-time but using a holistic and objective criteria to analyze and recognize the accomplishments of the best basketball players of all-time. We hope you enjoy reading through our teams and enjoy constructing your own based on our analysis.\n\n1st Team\n\nJohn Stockton (G) - 10x All-Star, 2x First Team\n\nRegarded as one of the NBA\u2019s greatest true point guards, John Stockton is known for his tenacity, elite passing ability, and leadership on the court. One thing that sets him apart from other legendary NBA point guards is his longevity. During his 19 seasons with the Utah Jazz, he only missed 22 games, and never lost his starting spot until he retired at 41 years old. Also, Stockton was the ultimate floor general, leading the league in assists for 9 consecutive seasons. In our analysis, he ranked 1st in assists and win shares, and 2nd in assist-to-turnover ratio (behind Muggsy Bogues). Today, he sits atop the NBA\u2019s All-Time lists for both assists and steals, making him the only player who currently holds two records among the five main statistical categories.\n\nMichael Jordan (G) - 5x MVP, 6x Champion, 6x Finals MVP, 14x All-Star, 10x First Team, Rookie of the Year, Defensive Player of The Year\n\nIn just the first five years of his career, Michael Jordan outperformed the field and earned his spot as one of the best backcourt players of the 80s. However, his official goat status was solidified in the 90s. By the numbers, it\u2019s no surprise Jordan owns a spot on two All-Decade teams. In our analysis, he ranked first in scoring, second in win shares, and third in rebounds among all 90s backcourt players. This stretch of his career included not one, but two three-peats from \u201891-\u201993 and \u201896-\u201998. Jordan took a brief pause from basketball to play Minor League Baseball for the Birmingham Barons, the affiliate of the Chicago White Sox. His stint in baseball did not work out as he had a batting average of .202 in 13 months and never made it to the majors. In his first year back, Jordan won his fourth MVP and led the Bulls to the title. Jordan then briefly retired again in 1999 for three years before coming back to join the Washington Wizards in 2001. He struggled in his return putting up his two lowest scoring numbers of his career before retiring in 2003. The six championships for the Bulls franchise have all come during Jordan\u2019s career as they have not even made it back to the Finals since his departure. Nevertheless, the Bulls are one of the most significant sports franchises of all-time thanks to Jordan as their dynasty and his legacy will live on forever.\n\nScottie Pippen (F) - 6x Champion, 7x All-Star, 3x First Team\n\nMost memorable as Micahel Jordan\u2019s right hand man, Pippen is still considered one of the best defenders and passers in NBA history and played a central role in the Bulls\u2019 six championships. Pippen\u2019s path to the NBA was an unlikely one: he stood at just 6\u20191\u2019\u2019 after high school and was not offered a college scholarship. Pippen walked on at the University of Central Arkansas where he grew to 6\u20198\u2019\u2019 and was then drafted 5th overall by the Seattle Supersonics. During his 599 games with the Bulls in the 90s, Pippen averaged 20.0 points, 6.0 assists, and 2.2 steals per game. In our analysis, he ranked first among frontcourt players in steals, second in assists and rebounds, and third in win shares. Despite his reputation as the best No. 2 of all-time, Pippen\u2019s No. 1 potential was demonstrated when Jordan missed nearly two full seasons (1993 and 1994) playing minor league baseball. The Jordan-less Bulls won 55 games with Pippen as he averaged career highs in points (22), rebounds (8.7), and steals (2.9). Pippen also won All-Star Game MVP that year. His second year with the absence of Jordan, 1994-95, Pippen led the league in defensive rating, steals, and ranked 3rd in Value Over Replacement in what was a historically dominant defensive season. This leaves basketball fans wondering if Pippen could have been even greater had he not played Robin to the best player of all-time. The Last Dance explores this most interesting basketball dynamic duo of all-time.\n\nKarl Malone (F) - 2x MVP, 14x All-Star, 11x First-Team\n\nA dominant 6\u20199\u2019\u2019, 250-pound power forward, Malone was nicknamed \u201cThe Mailman\u201d in reference to how consistent he was delivering on the court night after night. Malone\u2019s string of strong seasons in the 1990s landed him first in win shares and second in points in our analysis for frontcourt players during the decade. Despite never winning a championship, Malone\u2019s Jazz made two back-to-back championships (falling to Jordan\u2019s Bulls in six both times) and never missed the playoffs during his time there. Similar to the Bulls with Jordan and Pippen, our 1990\u2019s First Team features a Jazz guard and big man pairing in Malone and Stockton. Each duo ranks in the top two players of their franchise history by win shares. Throughout the 90s, Malone averaged an astounding 26.7 points and 10.6 rebounds per game through 785 contests. Speaking to his nickname, in his 19-year career, Malone only once missed more than two games in a season. Malone led the league in free throws made eight times in his career. Similar to fellow players on these 90\u2019s teams, Malone is one of the greatest to have never won a championship despite making the playoffs every year of his career. Malone was just passed by LeBron this year and now sits third all-time in points and is fourth in Value Over Replacement, behind only LeBron James, Michael Jordan, and John Stockton.\n\nGrant Hill (F) - 7x All-Star, 1x First Team, Co-Rookie of the Year\n\nHill demonstrated his versatility by logging many minutes as both a small forward and shooting guard throughout his career. This is evidenced by him ranking first in our assist score for frontcourt players averaging nearly 6 per game in the 90s. The third overall pick out of Duke, where he won two NCAA championships, took the NBA by storm, winning Co-Rookie of the Year (with Jason Kidd). Speaking to his versatility, Hill led the league in triple doubles in three consecutive seasons - 27 total. Considering the entire NBA only combined for 50 triple doubles per year at that time, Hill\u2019s TD3 production during those years constituted an outstanding 18% of all NBA triple doubles recorded. Today, Hill adds to his versatility as a co-owner and executive of the Atlanta Hawks.\n\n2nd Team\n\nGary Payton (G) - 1x Champion, 9x All-Star, 2x All-NBA First Team, Defensive Player Of The Year\n\nUp until this year, Gary \u201cThe Glove\u201d Payton was the only point guard to ever win Defensive Player of the Year in the 39 years since the award was first introduced (Marcus Smart now joins the club). He had a score of 85 in our steals metric and ranks fifth all-time. In terms of accolades, his lucky number must have been 9 because that\u2019s how many times that he received All-Defensive, All-NBA, and All-Star honors. Beyond his defensive prowess, Payton is known for his competitive spirit and constant trash talking, traits that made him even more of a pesky opponent. In his 13-year stretch with the Seattle Supersonics, he became the franchise\u2019s all-time leader in games, minutes, field goals, assists, and steals. After the franchise relocated to become the Oklahoma City Thunder, Payton still leads in win shares. By the end of his hall-of-fame career, Payton had only missed a total of 25 games over 17 years, topping it all off with a championship ring in 2006 with the Miami Heat. His son, Gary Payton II, takes after his father and is one of the Golden State Warriors best defenders.\n\nClyde Drexler (G) - 1x Champion, 10x All-Star, 1x First Team\n\nDrafted by the Portland Trailblazers in 1983, Clyde \u201cThe Glide\u201d Drexler is known as one the most elite shooting guards of his generation. Despite falling short in two Finals appearances with the Blazers, he set franchise records for scoring, steals, and triple doubles. Following the 1991-92 season, Drexler finished second in MVP votes behind Michael Jordan. As a Houston native and University of Houston star, it is only fitting that Drexler eventually became an NBA champion in a Houston Rockets jersey in 1995. Drexler is still the greatest player in Trail Blazers history by win shares but that could be at threat of falling to Damian Lillard depending on Dame\u2019s future with the franchise.\n\nCharles Barkley (F) - 1x MVP, 11x All-Star, 5x First Team\n\nAfter leading Auburn to their first March Madness tournament in program history, Barkley was selected 5th overall in 1984 by the Philadelphia 76ers. Standing at just 6\u20196\u201d as a power forward, Barkley was still able to carve out a role with his strength as a dominant frontcourt player. Barkley had a strong ability to get to the free throw line, holding the NBA playoff record for most free throws made in a half at 19. In our analysis, he posts high scores in points (75) and true shooting (89). Barkley was also an impressive rebounder, and his rebounding skills earned him the nickname \u201cThe Round Mound of Rebound.\u201d He holds NBA records for most offensive rebounds in a quarter (11) and a half (13) and was the shortest player to ever lead the league in rebounding. Similar to how his persona exceeded his actual size on the court, Barkley is now an NBA commentator known as the \u201csoul\u201d of Inside the NBA.\n\nDavid Robinson (C) - 1x MVP, 2x Champion, 10x All-Star, 4x First Team, 1x Defensive Player Of The Year, Rookie of the Year\n\nAfter being named the Naismith College Basketball Player of the Year during his senior year at Navy, Robinson was selected first overall in the 1987 draft by the Spurs. However, Robinson didn\u2019t debut until 1989, having to serve in the military for two years, but nevertheless won the Rookie of the Year Award. A 7-footer with a dominant mid-range and post game, \u201cThe Admiral\u201d was unstoppable on the offensive end, averaging 29.8 ppg in a season to earn a scoring title and recording a career high of 71 points. In our analysis, Robinson ranked 2nd in points and 4th in true shooting with scores of 83 and 89 respectively. The Admiral\u2019s dominance extended to the defensive end, where he was named to an All-Defensive team 8 times and won Defensive Player of the Year in 1992. He is also one of four players in NBA history to record a quadruple-double. In our analysis, he is tied for first in blocks, with a score of 89, and leads his peers in Win Shares, with a score of 91. Robinson\u2019s offensive and defensive prowess helped lead the Spurs to two NBA Championships with frontcourt partner Tim Duncan.\n\nDetlef Schrempf (F) - 3x All-Star, 2x Sixth Man of The Year\n\nOne of the most underrated players of the 90s, Detlef Schrempf was a talented offensive forward and played an important role on several successful Seattle Supersonics teams. Born in Germany, Schrempf played 3 seasons at the University of Washington, where he led the Huskies to the Sweet 16, before being selected 8th overall by the Dallas Mavericks in 1985. He began to emerge as a key contributor on the offensive end after being traded to the Indiana Pacers in 1989, where he won two Sixth Man of the Year Awards. As a 6-10 forward, Schrempf was a sharpshooter, shooting 39% from 3 and 81.3% from the free throw line in the 90s. Through the decade, he averaged 16.8 ppg and 7.4 rebounds per game. In our analysis, he stands out among his peers for his efficiency, recording a true shooting score of 93.\n\n3rd Team\n\nReggie Miller (G) - 5x All-Star\n\nIn his 18-year career with the Indiana Pacers, Reggie Miller established himself as a legendary shooter, retiring atop the NBA\u2019s all-time made 3-pointers list. Since then, he\u2019s only been surpassed by Ray Allen and Stephen Curry, leaving his sharp-shooting legacy in great company. It\u2019s no surprise his true shooting score of 99 tops the list. Miller is also known for his clutch gameplay down the stretch, which was dubbed \u201cMiller Time.\u201d Perhaps his most notable clutch performance was against the New York Knicks in Game 1 of the 1995 Eastern Conference semifinals. Miller famously went off, scoring 8 points in a span of 9 seconds to seal the comeback win earning him the reputation as one of the most feared and hated players to enter Madison Square Garden. Miller is one of the handful of players to join the 50-40-90 club (field goal, three point, free throw percentages) in his 1993 season.\n\nTim Hardaway (G) - 5x NBA All-Star, 1x First Team\n\nOne of the first things that comes to mind when thinking about Tim Hardaway\u2019s legacy is his killer crossover, which was dubbed the \u201cUTEP two-step\u201d in his college years. Hardaway took his crafty ball handling skills to the Golden State Warriors who selected him with the 14th pick in 1989. In Oakland, he reached 5,000 points and 2,500 assists faster than any other NBA player besides Oscar Robertson. A knee injury would send him to the Heat where he played out his prime years, finishing 4th in MVP votes in 1997. After short stints with the Mavericks, Nuggets, and Pacers, Hardaway retired and later served as an assistant coach for the Pistons from 2014 to 2018. His son, Tim Hardaway Jr. is currently an integral part of the Mavericks offense, making them the first father-son combo in Mavericks history.\n\nHakeem Olajuwon (C) - 1x MVP, 2x Champion, 2x Finals MVP, 12x All-Star, 6x First-Team, 2x Defensive Player Of The Year\n\nAfter two NCAA championship game losses at Houston, Olajuwon was selected first overall in 1984 draft by the Houston Rockets. On the offensive end, Hakeem utilized his signature \u201cDream Shake\u201d to freeze defenders and get easy shots at the rim. He averaged 21.8 ppg for his career, including 27.8 in the 1995 season, and ranks third in points among his peers in our analysis with a score of 81. Olajuwon was also a prolific shot-blocker on the other end of the court, and one of the greatest defenders of his era. As the only player with over 200 blocks and 200 steals in a season, Hakeem averaged 1.75 steals and 3 blocks per game during his career, including 4.6 blocks per game in the 1989-1990 season. Through his offensive and defensive skills, Olajuwon led the Rockets to back-to-back championships in 1994 and 1995 in the two years of Jordan\u2019s absence, winning Finals MVP both years.\n\nChris Webber (F/C) - 5x All-Star, 1x First Team, Rookie of The Year\n\nAlthough most known for his years with the Sacramento Kings in the early 2000s, Chris Webber established himself as a skilled offensive power forward in his first seasons in the league. A member of Michigan\u2019s famous \u201cFab Five,\u201d Webber played in two straight NCAA championship games before being drafted 1st overall in 1993 by the Warriors, where he won Rookie of the Year and forced himself out after only one season. In the 90s, Webber averaged a double-double, with 20 ppg on 50.8% shooting from the field along with 10 rebounds and 4.2 assists per game. In our analysis, Webber stands out for his contributions on the offensive end, recording a score of 71 in points and 66 in assists.\n\nShaquille O\u2019Neal (C) - 1x MVP, 4x Champion, 3x Finals MVP, 15x All-Star, 8x First Team, Rookie of The Year\n\nAn explosive 7-footer weighing over 300 pounds, Shaquille O\u2019Neal was perhaps the most powerful and electric center of all time. His two backboard-breaking dunks during the 1992-1993 season even led the NBA to increase the strength of the basket the following year. After winning college player of the year at LSU, Shaq was selected first overall by the Orlando Magic in 1992, where he won Rookie of the Year and spent four seasons before joining the Los Angeles Lakers. On the offensive end, Shaq averaged 27.1 ppg on 57.8% shooting from the field during the 1990s and won the scoring title during the 1994-1995 season, with 29.3 ppg. In our analysis, he ranks first in points among his peers with a score of 100 and ranks high in true shooting percentage with a score of 87. Shaq is one of the most larger-than-life (literally and figuratively) figures in NBA history and stars alongside fellow 90\u2019s team selection Charles Barkley on Inside the NBA.\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nKevin Johnson (G), Rod Strickland (G), Patrick Ewing (F), Chris Mullin (F), Horace Grant (F)\n\nCheck out our 1980s, 2000s, and 2010s teams\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nReddit\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading..."}, {"url": "https://mlb.nbcsports.com/2021/07/13/american-league-national-league-mlb-all-star-game-vladimir-guerrero-jr-shohei-ohtani/", "page_content": "Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\nClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n\nClick to share on Flipboard (Opens in new window)\n\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\nDENVER \u2014 A Sho-case for Shohei Ohtani became a grand stage for Vladimir Guerrero Jr., too.\n\nOhtani unleashed his 100 mph heat while pitching a perfect inning for the win in becoming baseball\u2019s first two-way All-Star, Guerrero rocked Coors Field with a 468-foot home run and the American League breezed 5-2 Tuesday night for its eighth straight victory.\n\nNear and far, the sport\u2019s entire focus was on Ohtani from the very start.\n\nPlayers on both sides climbed to the dugout rails to watch him, and the Japanese sensation went 0 for 2, grounding out twice as the AL\u2019s leadoff man and designated hitter.\n\nJared Walsh, Ohtani\u2019s teammate on the Los Angeles Angels, got a save \u2014 with his glove. He made a sliding catch in left field on Kris Bryant\u2018s tricky liner with the bases loaded to end the eighth inning.\n\nSo even with the teams decked out in new uniforms that social media deemed a strikeout instead of a home run, it was a familiar result. Mike Zunino also connected for the AL as it improved to 46-43-2 overall in the series.\n\nJ.T. Realmuto homered for the National League on a mile-high night at Coors, baseball\u2019s ultimate launching pad.\n\nA 27-year-old right-hander in his fourth big league season, Ohtani has dazzled. He leads the major leagues with 33 homers and is 4-1 in 13 starts as a pitcher, a two-way performance not seen since Babe Ruth in 1919 and \u201920, before the Bambino largely gave up the mound for slugging.\n\n\u201cThis has been the best experience, most memorable,\u201d he said through translator Ippei Mizuhara. \u201cObviously, I\u2019ve never played in the playoffs or World Series, so once I do that, that\u2019s probably going to surpass it. But this has been the most memorable.\u201d\n\nOhtani was a double triple-digit threat in Denver, hitting a 513-foot drive during Monday night\u2019s Home Run Derby and throwing a 100.2 mph pitch to Nolan Arenado.\n\n\u201cHe was as good as advertised,\u201d Arenado said.\n\nFollowing a full day, Ohtani slept until 10:30 a.m.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot more tiring compared to the regular season, but if everyone had fun I\u2019m good with it,\u201d he said.\n\nMajor League Baseball even made a special rules tweak for Ohtani, allowing him to be replaced as a pitcher and to remain in the game as the DH after he was done pitching. He grounded out twice \u2013 Pittsburgh second baseman Adam Frazier ranged to make a nice backhanded pickup that prevented a hit against Max Scherzer starting the night.\n\nOhtani combined with Lance Lynn, Kyle Gibson, Nathan Eovaldi, Gregory Soto, Chris Bassitt, Andrew Kittredge, Matt Barnes and Liam Hendriks on an eight-hitter.\n\nHendriks got the save, helped by a lucky bounce that turned what would\u2019ve been a wild pitch into an out at second.\n\nDespite another season of strikeouts that have alarmed baseball\u2019s leadership, NL batters whiffed 12 times while AL hitters had just three strikeouts.\n\nStill, the result had a familiar ring. The AL has won 20 of the last 23 All-Star Games with one tie thrown in.\n\nWhile everything is measured with precision these days, Guerrero\u2019s third-inning drive against Milwaukee\u2019s Corbin Burnes was jaw-dropping even before Statcast revealed it went 468 feet, the longest since All-Star Games were wired in 2015.\n\nAs the ball landed at the top of the left-field seats under the huge video board, NL shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr., another of \u201cjuniors\u201d among a record 42 first-time All-Stars, turned slowly and put both hands over his head.\n\nGuerrero\u2019s homer was the 200th in All-Star history and he followed in the bat path of his father, Vladimir Guerrero, who homered off Brad Penny in the 2006 game at Pittsburgh. They joined Bobby Bonds (1973) and Barry Bonds (1998 at Coors) and Ken Griffey Sr. (1980) and Ken Griffey Jr. (1992) as the only father-son duos with All-Star homers.\n\nGuerrero added an RBI grounder in the fifth against Miami\u2019s Trevor Rogers, and Boston\u2019s Xander Bogaerts followed with an RBI single for a 4-0 lead. Both runs were unearned after shortstop Brandon Crawford misplayed Teoscar Hernandez\u2018s grounder for an error.\n\nToronto\u2019s Marcus Semien had put the AL ahead with an RBI single in the second off Burnes, who took the loss.\n\nRealmuto homered in the fifth off Soto, a more pedestrian 430-foot drive that was the first by a Philadelphia All-Star since Mike Schmidt in 1981.\n\nZunino cracked a 433-foot shot in the sixth against Taijuan Walker and allowed a run-scoring passed ball in the bottom half.\n\nA crowd of 49,184 filled Coors Field, a stark contrast to the 2020 regular season played in empty ballparks because of the pandemic and many games with limited fans in the first half of this season while vaccinations became more prevalent.\n\nOhtani became the second straight Japanese pitcher to win the All-Star Game after the Yankees\u2019 Masahiro Tanaka two years ago. Last year\u2019s game was canceled when the season\u2019s start was delayed by the pandemic to late July.\n\nHe retired Tatis, Max Muncy and Arenado, a Colorado fan favorite, in order in the bottom half, throwing 10 of 14 pitches for strikes."}]}
