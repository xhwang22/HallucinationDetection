Kelly and Mary J. Blige, along with episodes of The Flash, 30 Rock, Ballers, Scandal, Black-ish, and several other TV shows. But she doesn\u2019t have a single body of work that\u2019s her favorite.\n\n\u201cI see fault in everything I direct,\u201d Shelton explains. \u201cWhen I don\u2019t, then I will retire.\u201d\n\nA few do stand out, including American Crime, The Flash, Black-ish, and Men of a Certain Age. One of the highlights of Shelton\u2019s career was being the first African-American woman to earn a Primetime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series with 2009\u2019s 30 Rock episode \u201cApollo, Apollo.\u201d The plot revolved around Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) turning 50 and featured the Muppets and Adam West.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still bummed that I didn\u2019t win! I honestly don\u2019t think about being one of the few African-American female directors while I\u2019m on-set. I think it would be too depressing. I focus on the job and the craft. I want to be the best director possible \u2014 period,\u201d Shelton says. \u201cIt was an honor to be nominated but very sobering to realize that I was the first one and it was 2009! One day, I plan to win that damn Emmy.\u201d\n\nShelton with Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson on the set of Ballers. Courtesy Millicent Shelton\n\n\u201cWhen I returned to Princeton, [Sitney] taught me almost everything I know to this day about film theory,\u201d Shelton says.\n\nHer first job in the film industry was as a wardrobe production assistant on 1989\u2019s Do the Right Thing, written and directed by Spike Lee, who was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nWorking on the film was a transformative experience. Shelton slept on the floor of her sister\u2019s Brooklyn brownstone and worked for nothing until earning a promotion to production assistant (\u201ca very small paycheck, but it at least put food in my mouth,\u201d she says). \u201cI had never been on a film set before or with \u2018real\u2019 actors. It was amazing to see Ossie Davis transform into Da Mayor as he walked down the street to the set,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI learned so much \u2014 and it was the hottest summer in New York City!\u201d\n\nAfterward, Shelton co-wrote a script with music producer Hurby Azor for hip-hop duo Kid \u2019n Play. Although it was never completed, the project led to her directing the videos for two Salt-n-Pepa songs, \u201cExpressions\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About Sex.\u201d She eventually founded her own production company and directed almost 100 music videos.\n\nShelton wrote and directed the 1998 comedy feature Ride. However, the script was changed in pre-production without her knowledge, souring her experience on the project and disillusioning her with the film industry. Actor Dean Cain \u201988, a friend and classmate, encouraged her to try directing television.\n\nSince then, she\u2019s directed more than 60 TV episodes, spanning drama, comedy, and action. \u201cI think the knowledge of all three has made me a better director,\u201d she says. \u201cI can bring heart to a comedy, momentary lightness to a drama, and both to an action show. It keeps everything fresh for me.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://millicentshelton.com/bio/", "page_content": "Millicent Shelton is an award-winning Director. In a very short time, she has established herself a noteworthy director in Television having directed an array of comedies and dramas, including, Empire, American Crime, The Flash, Black-ish, Ballers, Scandal, 30 Rock, Parenthood, and the pilot episode of Awkward. Originally the St. Louis native enrolled in Princeton University to become a lawyer. In her junior year, Shelton signed up for a \u201chands on summer film course at NYU, where she quickly discovered her passion for directing. While at NYU, Shelton received the Willard T.C. Johnson fellow award for her outstanding student work, which landed Shelton her first music video directing job for the Salt-N-Peps hit, \u201cExpressions.\u201d That groundbreaking video led to a decorated music video producing and directing career creating over 100 music videos.\n\nIn 2009, Shelton was the first African American woman to receive a primetime EMMY nomination for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series for the \u201cApollo Apollo\u201d episode of NBC\u2019s 30 Rock. She was also the first recipient of the NAACP Image Awards for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series for The Bernie Mac Show. In 2010, Ms. Shelton won a Peabody award and a second NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Directing in a Dramatic Series for an episode of Men Of A Certain Age.

She wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\n\nBy Margy Rochlin\n\n\n\nKEEPING HER COOL: Shelton tries to find comedy in the chaos and defuse tension with laughter.\n\nMillicent Shelton found herself walking onto the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank and wondering for a second, \u201cWhere am I again?\u201d For Shelton, this sort of momentary geographic disconnect means that business is booming. Over the past seven years, Shelton has directed a far-flung variety of episodic TV shows, from her Emmy-nominated installment of NBC\u2019s 30 Rock to TNT\u2019s now-defunct rumination on the male midlife crisis, Men of a Certain Age, to 90210, the CW\u2019s glossy update of the classic Aaron Spelling teen soap.\n\n\u201cI love being a guest director. I love it,\u201d Shelton says sitting in the dining room of her spacious townhouse seizing a quiet moment for dinner while her 4-year-old twins are asleep upstairs. \u201cI have director\u2019s [attention deficit disorder],\u201d says Shelton who possesses the perfect attributes for someone whose occupation involves only occasionally returning to the same set twice: an upbeat outlook, bottomless reserves of energy, a restless mind, and a love of prepping. \u201cI get bored if I have to do the same thing over and over again. I love jumping around to different shows and different styles of shooting.\u201d\n\nBut back in 2005, Shelton\u2014whose earliest credits include writing and directing music videos for chart-toppers such as Salt-N-Pepa, R. Kelly, and Aaliyah\u2014didn\u2019t immediately grasp the rich possibilities of what a helmer-for-hire could contribute to an established, long-running television series. \u201cIn music videos it was all about being original, it was all about me, my vision,\u201d says Shelton. \u201cWhen I started doing television I thought my job was to disappear. I thought it was about doing their show the way they\u2019d always done it. Then I learned that\u2019s not what they want. They want me to stay within the box of their show but to give it the Millicent twist.\u201d\n\nWhat Shelton quickly found was that by throwing herself into full-bore research mode\u2014meticulously watching as many previous episodes as she could and poring over old scripts\u2014when she hit the set she could easily discern when to shoot a scene in the pre- ordained style of the show and where she could insert a creative flourish. Whenever possible, Shelton worked with actors who might have gone on autopilot to help bring nuances to a performance. Often without anyone noticing, she\u2019d slip in what she considers her signature\u2014a cinematic wide shot such as the one featured in an episode of Californication. \u201cIt was sort of an homage to Beverly Hills Cop,\u201d says Shelton, referring to a fleeting bit of footage in an exchange at a firing range between David Duchovny\u2019s dissipated Hollywood screenwriter character and a bonkers rap magnate.\n\nIt was on her second episodic gig ever\u2014The Bernie Mac Show\u2014when it dawned on Shelton that she also had the right upbringing for someone who would often find herself face to face with the behavioral unpredictability of talent. From Day One until the Martini Shot, Mac, the sitcom\u2019s creator and star, found reasons to carp at Shelton. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh my God. He hates me.\u2019 But I got through it. On the last day, Bernie took me aside and said, \u2018You have thick skin. I like you.\u2019 It was a test,\u201d says Shelton. She passed, crediting both her internal grit and tendency to see humor in pandemonium, something she learned from being the youngest of four children in her St. Louis household. \u201cI got picked on a lot. I can deal with an actor who\u2019s having a bad day, missing their kids, being in a bad mood. It isn\u2019t personal. I try to defuse things with laughter. I find comedy in a lot of chaos. Things are going crazy and everybody else is freaking out, and I\u2019m like, \u2018This is kind of funny.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe way Shelton tells the story of how she ended up in show business definitely has its elements of slapstick. After getting her undergraduate degree in English from Princeton and at occupational loose ends, Shelton\u2019s older sister urged her to send a resume to her friend David Lee\u2019s brother, Spike. The next thing she knew, Shelton was the most overly educated production assistant in the wardrobe department of Lee\u2019s 1989 race relations drama, Do the Right Thing. When that wrapped, she landed a spot in wardrobe at The Cosby Show. In the hopes of using a short film she was making to get into film school, she solicited her blunt-speaking boss as a test audience of one. \u201c[Bill Cosby] gave me some really harsh criticism,\u201d says Shelton with a weak smile, \u201cwhich I needed to hear, but I recut it and submitted it to Tisch [School of the Arts at NYU] and I got in.\u201d\n\n\n\nShelton working with Virginia Madsen on the cable movie Hornet's Nest.\n\nNo one can say it has always been easy. After her 1998 hip-hop road trip feature debut, Ride, which she wrote and directed, performed weakly at the box office, Shelton found it a struggle to get work. But instead of complaining she went back to the drawing board and shadowed veteran director and Guild first vice president Paris Barclay (NYPD Blue, Sons of Anarchy) for three years. \u201cA lot of people\u2014black, white, and other, men and women\u2014don\u2019t succeed because they give up. I didn\u2019t give up,\u201d says Shelton, a member of the DGA\u2019s African American Steering Committee, which, in addition to tributes and educational events, actively explores ways to assist the Guild in improving employment opportunities for members of color. \u201cOpening your show up to different vantage points actually can be a really good thing,\u201d says Shelton, who when confronted by doubters uses herself as a case in point. \u201cI\u2019m an African-American female. You wouldn\u2019t think I\u2019d do so well on a show called Men of a Certain Age. You wouldn\u2019t think that would be a match. But it was a great match.\u201d\n\nOver the past several months, Shelton has directed the pilot episode from MTV\u2019s Awkward and a TV movie of best-selling crime novelist Patricia Cornwell\u2019s Hornet\u2019s Nest for TNT. In 12 hours or so, she\u2019ll be directing an episode of Harry\u2019s Law. But it\u2019s 8 p.m. now and she still has prep work to attend to.\n\nSuddenly, a loud thumping noise can be heard as Shelton\u2019s husband sprints up the stairs: one of her twins is out of bed and apparently practicing Gymboree moves. Meanwhile, Wookie, her fluffy white Shih Tzu, begins, for reasons unknown, excitedly racing around in circles. \u201cYou should see it here at breakfast,\u201d jokes Shelton, who makes mornings at the Sheltons\u2019 sound like a night at Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a juggling act. But I love my kids and I love what I do,\u201d says Shelton who\u2019d like to get 10 minutes or so with some other female directors with young kids and swap tips on time-management and motherhood. \u201cEveryone always asks me, \u2018How do you do it?\u2019\u201d she laughs. \u201cAnd I always say, \u2018I drink a lot of espresso and I don\u2019t sleep much.\u2019\u201d"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/authority-magazine/millicent-shelton-5-things-i-wish-someone-told-me-when-i-first-became-a-filmmaker-894dd50dc40a", "page_content": "Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series! Our readers would love to get to know you a bit better. Can you tell us a bit of the \u2018backstory\u2019 of how you grew up?\n\nI grew up in St. Louis way out in the suburbs. I went to college at Princeton university in new jersey and every weekend I\u2019d ride the train to New York City to hang out. It only made sense for me to move to new york after graduation and eventually earn my master's in film from NYU while directing music videos to pay the bills.\n\nCan you share a story with us about what brought you to this specific career path?\n\nI had to decide what I was going to major in at Princeton. I grew up believing that I wanted to be a lawyer but after interning for a summer at a law firm, I knew that was not the job for me. My mother told me to select a field that I loved but I had no clue what that was. It took me a while to do some soul searching. I remembered that I enjoyed creative writing. I took a summer course at NYU to explore what it was like to create a short film from a writer\u2019s perspective and ended up loving being a director. By the end of the summer, i knew that there was no other job but directing for me.\n\nCan you share the funniest or most interesting story that occurred to you in the course of your filmmaking career?\n\nOne of my craziest experiences on set came during the filming of \u201cend of the road.\u201d I had just called cut on a scene with beau bridges outside of our motel location and we started to set up for the next scene when suddenly the blue sky turned brown, and we were hit with high winds mixed with sand so thick that you couldn\u2019t see 3 feet in front of you. It\u2019s called a \u2018haboob\u2019 which is a crazy intense dust storm. It lasted for 45 minutes then suddenly stopped and the most breathtaking sunset appeared. We filmed the SUV driving up to the motel in that light.\n\nWho are some of the most interesting people you have interacted with? What was that like? Do you have any stories?\n\nI have worked with so many brilliantly talented people. It was a dream of a lifetime to work with Al Pacino on \u201cHunters\u2019. Every time I search for a visual film reference, one of his films appears! He\u2019s been in so many iconic movies, its mind-blowing. He was a truly lovely actor who was collaborative and giving. There was a moment the first day that we worked together that I thought maybe I shouldn\u2019t give Al Pacino a note, but that\u2019s my job as a director. I gave him notes but I made sure that they were smart notes that I could back up and notes that would further enhance the magic that he naturally creates. He gave me a big hug on his last day and said, \u201cI\u2019d like to work with you again, kid.\u201d I liked that he called me kid. It would be a blessing to work with Al again.\n\nNone of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?\n\nMy favorite professor at NYU was Nick Tanis. He taught me how to transform my daydreams into filmable images. Paris Barclay has been my mentor for years. I shadowed him off and on for 3 years trying to get my first break as a director in episodic television. On the first episode that I was hired on, Paris promised the producers that he would guide me through it and be there if I froze up then privately he told me that I could handle the job on my own which I did. Until covid, I was having an annual breakfast with David Nutter who is also a mentor to me. He was instrumental in helping me to move into action television and was a sounding board for me during my first pilot. There are countless other people that have helped me, but it would take up pages and pages! I am a driven person but have had lots of help along the way.\n\nCan you please give us your favorite \u201clife lesson quote\u201d? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?\n\n\u2018Never give up\u2019 is my favorite quote. I started directing during a time when women and especially women of color were not welcomed with open arms as Hollywood television directors. There were lots of doors that were not open. I wanted to give up a lot, but that quote would ring through my head. My testimony is that I am here today because I had blind faith and perseverance and did not give up on my dream.\n\nI am very interested in diversity in the entertainment industry. Can you share three reasons with our readers about why you think it\u2019s important to have diversity represented in film and television? How can that potentially affect our culture?\n\nI wholeheartedly believe in diversity. To me, diversity is a little bit of everyone, inclusive of all races, gender, and LGBTIQQ+. It\u2019s important because cinema should be reflective of real life and our world is diverse. The more we have diverse voices behind the screen, the more our stories will ring true and have realistic characters, dialogue, and actions. The more that we explore diverse stories, the more that we realize that despite our ethnic or socio-economic differences, we are all very much the same. Family is family. Fear is fear. Love is love.\n\nWhat are some of the most interesting or exciting projects you are working on now?\n\nBeing able to shepherd \u2018end of the road\u2019 has been a wonderful experience that I am very proud of. It was great to collaborate with queen Latifah again. We worked together to create a black family with a female matriarch who is a smart, strong, mama bear willing to do whatever is necessary to protect her family. After this, I am in development on a Josephine Baker limited series with Ruth Negga attached in the leading role. I am super excited about that. We\u2019re looking to delve deeper into Josephine than ever before. I can\u2019t wait to see what ruth does with this part. She\u2019s amazing!\n\nWhich aspect of your work makes you most proud? Can you explain or give a story?\n\nI am most proud of my ability to collaborate with actors. They are the conduit for the soul of the characters and I respect their position. I love hearing their point of view and then working to make sure that the feeling that they desire to convey is truly coming through. Both queen Latifah and Chris \u2018Ludacris\u2019 bridges were laser-focused on representing their characters in their truest light. They trusted me to give them feedback in order to make their performances stronger. Another actor that I\u2019ve worked with is Forest Whitaker. He is the king of nuanced performances. When I worked with him on \u2018empire\u2019, I noticed that he would subtly change his performance with each take. We\u2019d discuss it after each take and then land on the read that we both felt sold the story and character best.\n\nOk super. Here is the main question of our interview. What are your \u201c5 things I wish someone told me when I first started\u201d and why? Please share a story or example for each.\n\nGet sleep because production will seep into your dreams, and you will never have a sound sleep again. Trust your gut because you must stand up or fall down based on your own thoughts not because someone told you to do it. Be fearless. A healthy amount of fear is normal but don\u2019t be too scared that it limits your ability to dream outside of the box. Listen to everyone. This doesn\u2019t mean doing everything that everyone suggests but be smart enough and open enough to hear thoughts that may lead you to something great. Learn to say \u2018no.\u2019 it\u2019s actually a secret power.\n\nWhen you create a film, which stakeholders have the greatest impact on the artistic and cinematic choices you make? Is it the viewers, the critics, the financiers, or your own personal artistic vision? Can you share a story with us or give an example of what you mean?\n\nWhen I create, I can\u2019t think about what critics will say or it would make my mind spin. I read the material, daydream about it, and try to stay true to it. My goal is to take the 2-dimensional words off the page and breathe life into their 3-dimensional existence with the help of actors and amazing crew members. I like to say that as a director, \u2018i service script.\u2019\n\nYou are a person of great influence. If you could start a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-)\n\nMy movement would be for equality and parity for all. In particular, a woman\u2019s right to choose how she uses her body.\n\nWe are very blessed that some of the biggest names in business, vc funding, sports, and entertainment read this column. Is there a person in the world, or in the US whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might see this. :-)\n\nI would like to sit down and have a quiet lunch with president Barrack Obama. I can\u2019t imagine the stories he has to share but I know they are deep.\n\nHow can our readers further follow you online?\n\nThey can follow me on instagram at @shelton9mil. I try to keep it updated!\n\nThis was very meaningful, thank you so much! We wish you continued success!"}, {"url": "https://www.starz.com/us/en/browse/artist/millicent-shelton/57423", "page_content": "Watch Millicent Shelton TV shows on STARZ\n\nBrowse and watch Millicent Shelton's TV shows on STARZ, including Run The World\n\nClaim Special Offer"}, {"url": "https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/millicent_shelton", "page_content": "Highest Rated: 31% End of the Road (2022)\n\nLowest Rated: 31% End of the Road (2022)\n\nBirthday: Not Available\n\nBirthplace: St. Louis, Missouri, USA\n\nHaving already made her career as a prolific director of music videos, in the mid-2000s Millicent Shelton turned her attention to television directing.

Meanwhile, Beau Bridges and Ludacris play Hammers and Reggie respectively. Set in the New Mexico desert, we follow Brenda (Queen Latifah) and her family as they travel across country in search of a better life. Alone in the middle of nowhere with no cell service, their journey becomes an odyssey when they are forced to fight for their lives when they become targets for an unknown killer.\n\nThis high-octane action thriller takes us on a wild ride that never lets up, says director Millicent Shelton.\n\nThe Cast\n\nIn this high-octane action thriller, a cross-country road trip becomes a highway to hell for Brenda and her family. The film was directed by Millicent Shelton and stars Beau Bridges, Mychala Lee Kelly (as Mychala Faith Lee), and Ludacris Reggie (as Chris Bridges). Beau Bridges plays Sheriff John Kane with graying hair and glasses that give him an intellectual, elderly look. He is a true expert in his field and takes his job very seriously. Mychala Lee Kelly(as Mychala Faith Lee) is Brenda\u2019s daughter who wants nothing more than to live in peace after all she has been through, but when they are attacked once again while taking the long drive home from visiting their grandchild, she takes up arms with her father.\n\nHighway to Hell: End of the Road Director Millicent Shelton Takes Us on a Thrilling Ride\n\nHow can we keep our loved ones safe?\n\nIf you know Beau Bridges, Ludacris Reggie, and Mychala Lee Kelly from their roles in TV\u2019s Southland or movies like Bring It On, then buckle up for a wild ride. They star as an ordinary family on vacation who get caught up in an international spy game with deadly consequences.\n\nHow did you get into filmmaking?\n\nMillicent Shelton has been an integral part of Hollywood for many years and is considered by many as a true genius behind-the-scenes. She\u2019s made appearances in various television and film productions, including Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off, Too Fast Too Furious, and Collateral Beauty. Originally born in Brazil but raised in Detroit, she attended Wayne State University where she studied psychology and theater with minors in Spanish and German.\n\nWhat drew you to horror?\n\nBefore I got into horror, I used to watch quite a bit of cheesy movies. One day my friend lent me Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula and I was hooked! That led me down the rabbit hole so to speak and that was all it took for me to start following horror directors as closely as actors and actresses.\n\nNowadays, when I get bored or need something new, I search for new directors to check out.\n\nWhat was it like working with James Furlong?\n\nJames was such an amazing actor to work with, and I think that the film would not have been as successful without him. It is always so hard when filming your last day with someone you\u2019ve grown close to. After so many hours together, it feels like your own family has left you for a long time. I was also very fortunate because James had spent a lot of time in New Mexico before our movie started shooting there.\n\nHighway to Hell: End of the Road Director Millicent Shelton Takes Us on a Thrilling Ride\n\nWho was your inspiration growing up?\n\nI grew up in a very small town and my hero growing up was Ludacris Reggie. My mom introduced me to Ludacris when I was 9 years old, and I immediately loved his music. He was very talented, had natural talent as an actor and singer, and he seemed like an all-around cool guy. His lyrics were inspiring and uplifting. When I saw him do standup comedy, it made me want to pursue comedy myself.\n\nIs End of the Road on netflix?\n\nA cross-country road trip becomes a highway to hell for Brenda and her family.

Barry is stunned when he runs into Earth-2 Iris (Candice Patton) and Joe (Jesse L. Martin), but nothing prepares him for meeting Killer Frost (Danielle Panabaker) and Deathstorm (guest star Robbie Amell). Meanwhile, back on Earth-1, Jay (guest star Teddy Sears) has to take over the Flash\u2019s responsibilities when a meta-human nicknamed Geomancer (guest star Adam Stafford) attacks Central City. Millicent Shelton directed the episode written by Greg Berlanti & Andrew Kreisberg and Katherine Walczak (#213).\n\nYou can read more about what went into the Killer Frost design in original story from July 27th down below\u2026\n\nIf you aren\u2019t completely charmed by Danielle Panabaker as Caitlin Snow on The Flash, well, you probably just aren\u2019t a fan of that show in the first place. While it\u2019s easy to get caught up in her banter with the rest of the cast, her romance with Ronnie \u201cFirestorm\u201d Raymond, and even the occasional (well, OK\u2026once) bit of karaoke, since Caitlin\u2019s name was first announced, fans have had two words on the brain: Killer Frost. We sat down at an SDCC roundtable with Ms. Panabaker to discuss her transformation into Killer Frost.\n\nThe cold-wielding supervillain has been kicking around the DC Comics universe since 1978, and she\u2019s primarily been known as a Firestorm antagonist. Earlier incarnations bore names like \u201cCrystal Frost\u201d and \u201cLouise Lincoln\u201d before Caitlin Snow came around in 2013 as part of the DC New 52. But the connection to Firestorm has always been a strong one, so the decision of The Flash producers to pair Caitlin up with Ronnie Raymond helped tie things to the character\u2019s larger history.\n\nWe got the briefest glimpse of Danielle as Killer Frost in The Flash season one finale, and even though she admits \u201cthat was a little bit of a tease,\u201d it sounds like that is pretty close to Killer Frost\u2019s final look.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t seen it\u2026"}], "Millicent Shelton was nominated for NAACP Image Awards.": [{"url": "https://millicentshelton.com/bio/", "page_content": "Millicent Shelton is an award-winning Director.

Kelly and Mary J. Blige, along with episodes of The Flash, 30 Rock, Ballers, Scandal, Black-ish, and several other TV shows. But she doesn\u2019t have a single body of work that\u2019s her favorite.\n\n\u201cI see fault in everything I direct,\u201d Shelton explains. \u201cWhen I don\u2019t, then I will retire.\u201d\n\nA few do stand out, including American Crime, The Flash, Black-ish, and Men of a Certain Age. One of the highlights of Shelton\u2019s career was being the first African-American woman to earn a Primetime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series with 2009\u2019s 30 Rock episode \u201cApollo, Apollo.\u201d The plot revolved around Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) turning 50 and featured the Muppets and Adam West.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still bummed that I didn\u2019t win! I honestly don\u2019t think about being one of the few African-American female directors while I\u2019m on-set. I think it would be too depressing. I focus on the job and the craft. I want to be the best director possible \u2014 period,\u201d Shelton says. \u201cIt was an honor to be nominated but very sobering to realize that I was the first one and it was 2009! One day, I plan to win that damn Emmy.\u201d\n\nShelton with Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson on the set of Ballers. Courtesy Millicent Shelton\n\n\u201cWhen I returned to Princeton, [Sitney] taught me almost everything I know to this day about film theory,\u201d Shelton says.\n\nHer first job in the film industry was as a wardrobe production assistant on 1989\u2019s Do the Right Thing, written and directed by Spike Lee, who was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nWorking on the film was a transformative experience. Shelton slept on the floor of her sister\u2019s Brooklyn brownstone and worked for nothing until earning a promotion to production assistant (\u201ca very small paycheck, but it at least put food in my mouth,\u201d she says). \u201cI had never been on a film set before or with \u2018real\u2019 actors. It was amazing to see Ossie Davis transform into Da Mayor as he walked down the street to the set,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI learned so much \u2014 and it was the hottest summer in New York City!\u201d\n\nAfterward, Shelton co-wrote a script with music producer Hurby Azor for hip-hop duo Kid \u2019n Play. Although it was never completed, the project led to her directing the videos for two Salt-n-Pepa songs, \u201cExpressions\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About Sex.\u201d She eventually founded her own production company and directed almost 100 music videos.\n\nShelton wrote and directed the 1998 comedy feature Ride. However, the script was changed in pre-production without her knowledge, souring her experience on the project and disillusioning her with the film industry. Actor Dean Cain \u201988, a friend and classmate, encouraged her to try directing television.\n\nSince then, she\u2019s directed more than 60 TV episodes, spanning drama, comedy, and action. \u201cI think the knowledge of all three has made me a better director,\u201d she says. \u201cI can bring heart to a comedy, momentary lightness to a drama, and both to an action show. It keeps everything fresh for me.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.awardsdaily.com/2022/09/12/end-of-the-road-director-millicent-shelton-on-working-with-queen-latifah-and-the-importance-of-inclusion-in-storytelling/", "page_content": "Millicent Shelton started her career as a wardrobe production assistant on Spike Lee\u2019s 1989 classic Do the Right Thing. That opportunity served as a springboard to a directing career of her own across music videos, television, and film. Her direction of the 30 Rock episode \u201cApollo, Apollo\u201d would make her the first Black woman to receive an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series.\n\nWith Netflix\u2019s End of the Road (currently streaming), Shelton again works with star and producer Queen Latifah. In the film, Latifah plays Brenda, a recently widowed mother who loses her home in Los Angeles. After deciding to move home to Houston, Brenda travels across the Southwest with her brother (Ludacris) and two children (Mychala Lee, Shaun Dixon). On the journey, they run afoul of a major crime boss thanks to a bag of money that holds the potential to change their lives. The film asks viewers to experience the world through the eyes of this troubled Black family as they hold together in the face of traumatic danger.\n\nHere, in an interview with Awards Daily, Millicent Shelton talks about what drew her to the project and what it\u2019s like to work with Queen Latifah both in front of and behind the camera. She talks about the film\u2019s vivid color palate and the joyous luck in finding four actors who held so much natural chemistry together. Finally, she talks about the importance of inclusivity and the recent conversation around two major television series \u2014 HBO\u2019s House of the Dragon and Amazon Studio\u2019s The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power \u2014 who cast Black actors in major roles within the series.\n\nAwards Daily: I\u2019d like to start with recent controversies related to specific audiences rejecting inclusive efforts on such major projects as Rings of Power and House of the Dragon. How do you as a filmmaker react to that in a modern filmmaking environment? Does it make you even more determined to pursue inclusive projects?\n\nMillicent Shelton: It does. I tend to be a little bit of a rebel. I like to push against what people perceive as the norm. So the perception we have had in television and cinematically has been very Caucasian. Not only are white Americans used to that, but so are Black Americans or Asian Americans or Latino Americans. That\u2019s how a lot of body dysmorphia happens to Black girls and Latino girls and Asian girls. They don\u2019t see people like them represented as images of beauty. There\u2019s a movement now to change that.\n\nI honestly think that\u2019s what our country fought for \u2014 to have representation and freedom. If we\u2019re going to truly embrace what we say this country is about which is about embracing diversity and about the melting pot, then we should embrace that in front of and behind the camera as well. I honestly believe that we are stronger when we are like that. To me, diversity is not making an all Black film, not that I\u2019m against that. I think diversity is a mix of everybody, and it\u2019s not just different colors. It\u2019s also different religions. It\u2019s different sexual preferences. It\u2019s diversity of all, and that\u2019s what makes us as a country stronger because we get to experience a lot of different people\u2019s perspectives. I think that our creativity is better that way.\n\nIn this film, we had a mix of everyone in all key positions. We really functioned that way. I like to say that we were a crew that went through a lot of strenuous situations. We survived it as a team, and we survived it as a family. We were a very diverse family, but we survived it as a family.\n\nAD: So you have a Brazilian production designer and an Asian American cinematographer. The film has a very international visual flair. The roadside motel, in particular, doesn\u2019t look like any I\u2019ve ever seen. In fact, the entire color palate for the film is incredibly vibrant and bursting with deep, vivid colors.\n\nMS: [The motel room] is my Brazilian production designer. It\u2019s interesting because we kept looking for motel rooms, and we could not find them. They\u2019re all too little. So we decided to build it, but we had seen a reference for this one in a motel that doesn\u2019t exist anymore. It had cherubs on the wall, and that was it \u2014 Lucio\u2019s [Seixas, production designer] brain started to go. Our whole vision for this film was exaggerated reality. I wanted to push it outside of the realm of just playing on normal. So the idea of making these rooms a little over the top I embraced. We embraced the color too because we wanted extreme colors. That was kind of tough because we were shooting in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and a lot of the buildings there are beige. So, we found a gas station with a lot of color and a motel with a lot of color. Then, we added the neon tubes all around. Some people are freaked out by the color palette in this movie, but as an artist, I think sometimes we should push the boundaries of what people find to be regular.\n\nAD: The film offers this theme of the lack of connectivity, that lack of civilization, where the characters are left to their wits that have been dulled by modern technology. What was it about End of the Road that attracted you as a director?\n\nMS: What originally attracted me was the opportunity to work with Queen Latifah again. We\u2019ve sort of known each other from music videos in New York for a while, worked together on Star, and then the opportunity to work with her again\u2026 I just love working with her. Since this movie, we\u2019ve worked together on an episode of Equalizer. She\u2019s a wonderful talent. I read the script because she was attached to it. When I read it, I could relate to this woman who was reeling from the loss. The family was torn apart and found their way back to each other. From adversity, the family actually becomes stronger, and I could relate to that story. I wanted to tell that story, particularly about a Black family but it\u2019s not a story that\u2019s unique to a Black family. However, what they face going through these desolate areas with the racism that happens, both covert and overt, is something that Black people experience in the United States whether anybody wants to admit it or not. That\u2019s something that\u2019s our reality, and I wanted to be able to show that.\n\nAD: As you\u2019ve mentioned, you have worked with Queen Latifah multiple times. What was it like working with her as both an actress and as a producer on this film?\n\nMS: She functions primarily as an actress. She doesn\u2019t throw the weight of the producer title on you. She comes in with a pure heart, and she really is in the state of mind of an actress. When we got into post-production, then she went into producer mode and was really helpful in supporting me through getting this film done. So, it actually worked really well. But as an actress, she shows up prepared, and she\u2019s willing to get feedback. She\u2019s willing to give feedback, which I think is great. I love to get feedback from actors because I really admire what actors bring to the table as they bring a different sensibility than even the writers or the director brings because they live through the spirit of a character. When I hear what their thoughts are about the words and what\u2019s happening to that character, I really take that to heart. I find that it makes all the scenes better.\n\nAll the times in the movie where she makes reference to her dead husband, that\u2019s all Latifah. I lost my mother a month before we went into prep on this movie, and so I was reeling from that loss. She said, \u2018You know, when you lose somebody, you talk to them. They stay with you.\u2019 And so we talked about it. We picked moments in the film when Brenda would say something to her husband. That\u2019s how those moments came alive. That\u2019s all from the actor having a thought about the spirit of the character.\n\nAD: The film rises on those moments of that core family group. How did you work with those four actors to build that incredible chemistry that really comes across on screen?\n\nMS: The chemistry actually was there naturally. It\u2019s interesting. Queen Latifah actually recommended Ludacris for the role of Reggie. After the first time I talked to him, I was like he\u2019s Reggie. He\u2019s not really Reggie in real life, but when we were talking about it, he understood Reggie. The next person that we cast was Mikayla, who plays the daughter, and she just stood out amongst everybody. She\u2019s a wonderful actress. I just actually got to work with her again on a couple of episodes of Truth Be Told for Apple. We did a lot of chemistry test reads with her and the potentials for the brother, and Shawn read and it was just immediately chemistry. You just saw brother and sister. They went at it. They were ad libbing, and they just went at it. It was just like another brother and sister. Then, we had a cast dinner a few nights before the first day of shooting. It was just those four characters, and we had a really lovely long dinner. We just were all talking about our lives and our dreams and kind of where we came from. They started to bond as a family, and the rest was just magic. They really felt like a real family. They had nicknames for each other and everything.\n\nAD: Last question for you: let\u2019s say you have the keys to the kingdom. You\u2019ve worked in television, you\u2019ve worked in streaming, you\u2019ve worked in film, and you\u2019ve worked in music videos. You\u2019ve done a little bit of everything.

She wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\n\nBy Margy Rochlin\n\n\n\nKEEPING HER COOL: Shelton tries to find comedy in the chaos and defuse tension with laughter.\n\nMillicent Shelton found herself walking onto the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank and wondering for a second, \u201cWhere am I again?\u201d For Shelton, this sort of momentary geographic disconnect means that business is booming. Over the past seven years, Shelton has directed a far-flung variety of episodic TV shows, from her Emmy-nominated installment of NBC\u2019s 30 Rock to TNT\u2019s now-defunct rumination on the male midlife crisis, Men of a Certain Age, to 90210, the CW\u2019s glossy update of the classic Aaron Spelling teen soap.\n\n\u201cI love being a guest director. I love it,\u201d Shelton says sitting in the dining room of her spacious townhouse seizing a quiet moment for dinner while her 4-year-old twins are asleep upstairs. \u201cI have director\u2019s [attention deficit disorder],\u201d says Shelton who possesses the perfect attributes for someone whose occupation involves only occasionally returning to the same set twice: an upbeat outlook, bottomless reserves of energy, a restless mind, and a love of prepping. \u201cI get bored if I have to do the same thing over and over again. I love jumping around to different shows and different styles of shooting.\u201d\n\nBut back in 2005, Shelton\u2014whose earliest credits include writing and directing music videos for chart-toppers such as Salt-N-Pepa, R. Kelly, and Aaliyah\u2014didn\u2019t immediately grasp the rich possibilities of what a helmer-for-hire could contribute to an established, long-running television series. \u201cIn music videos it was all about being original, it was all about me, my vision,\u201d says Shelton. \u201cWhen I started doing television I thought my job was to disappear. I thought it was about doing their show the way they\u2019d always done it. Then I learned that\u2019s not what they want. They want me to stay within the box of their show but to give it the Millicent twist.\u201d\n\nWhat Shelton quickly found was that by throwing herself into full-bore research mode\u2014meticulously watching as many previous episodes as she could and poring over old scripts\u2014when she hit the set she could easily discern when to shoot a scene in the pre- ordained style of the show and where she could insert a creative flourish. Whenever possible, Shelton worked with actors who might have gone on autopilot to help bring nuances to a performance. Often without anyone noticing, she\u2019d slip in what she considers her signature\u2014a cinematic wide shot such as the one featured in an episode of Californication. \u201cIt was sort of an homage to Beverly Hills Cop,\u201d says Shelton, referring to a fleeting bit of footage in an exchange at a firing range between David Duchovny\u2019s dissipated Hollywood screenwriter character and a bonkers rap magnate.\n\nIt was on her second episodic gig ever\u2014The Bernie Mac Show\u2014when it dawned on Shelton that she also had the right upbringing for someone who would often find herself face to face with the behavioral unpredictability of talent. From Day One until the Martini Shot, Mac, the sitcom\u2019s creator and star, found reasons to carp at Shelton. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh my God. He hates me.\u2019 But I got through it. On the last day, Bernie took me aside and said, \u2018You have thick skin. I like you.\u2019 It was a test,\u201d says Shelton. She passed, crediting both her internal grit and tendency to see humor in pandemonium, something she learned from being the youngest of four children in her St. Louis household. \u201cI got picked on a lot. I can deal with an actor who\u2019s having a bad day, missing their kids, being in a bad mood. It isn\u2019t personal. I try to defuse things with laughter. I find comedy in a lot of chaos. Things are going crazy and everybody else is freaking out, and I\u2019m like, \u2018This is kind of funny.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe way Shelton tells the story of how she ended up in show business definitely has its elements of slapstick. After getting her undergraduate degree in English from Princeton and at occupational loose ends, Shelton\u2019s older sister urged her to send a resume to her friend David Lee\u2019s brother, Spike. The next thing she knew, Shelton was the most overly educated production assistant in the wardrobe department of Lee\u2019s 1989 race relations drama, Do the Right Thing. When that wrapped, she landed a spot in wardrobe at The Cosby Show. In the hopes of using a short film she was making to get into film school, she solicited her blunt-speaking boss as a test audience of one. \u201c[Bill Cosby] gave me some really harsh criticism,\u201d says Shelton with a weak smile, \u201cwhich I needed to hear, but I recut it and submitted it to Tisch [School of the Arts at NYU] and I got in.\u201d\n\n\n\nShelton working with Virginia Madsen on the cable movie Hornet's Nest.\n\nNo one can say it has always been easy. After her 1998 hip-hop road trip feature debut, Ride, which she wrote and directed, performed weakly at the box office, Shelton found it a struggle to get work. But instead of complaining she went back to the drawing board and shadowed veteran director and Guild first vice president Paris Barclay (NYPD Blue, Sons of Anarchy) for three years. \u201cA lot of people\u2014black, white, and other, men and women\u2014don\u2019t succeed because they give up. I didn\u2019t give up,\u201d says Shelton, a member of the DGA\u2019s African American Steering Committee, which, in addition to tributes and educational events, actively explores ways to assist the Guild in improving employment opportunities for members of color. \u201cOpening your show up to different vantage points actually can be a really good thing,\u201d says Shelton, who when confronted by doubters uses herself as a case in point. \u201cI\u2019m an African-American female. You wouldn\u2019t think I\u2019d do so well on a show called Men of a Certain Age. You wouldn\u2019t think that would be a match. But it was a great match.\u201d\n\nOver the past several months, Shelton has directed the pilot episode from MTV\u2019s Awkward and a TV movie of best-selling crime novelist Patricia Cornwell\u2019s Hornet\u2019s Nest for TNT. In 12 hours or so, she\u2019ll be directing an episode of Harry\u2019s Law. But it\u2019s 8 p.m. now and she still has prep work to attend to.\n\nSuddenly, a loud thumping noise can be heard as Shelton\u2019s husband sprints up the stairs: one of her twins is out of bed and apparently practicing Gymboree moves. Meanwhile, Wookie, her fluffy white Shih Tzu, begins, for reasons unknown, excitedly racing around in circles. \u201cYou should see it here at breakfast,\u201d jokes Shelton, who makes mornings at the Sheltons\u2019 sound like a night at Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a juggling act. But I love my kids and I love what I do,\u201d says Shelton who\u2019d like to get 10 minutes or so with some other female directors with young kids and swap tips on time-management and motherhood. \u201cEveryone always asks me, \u2018How do you do it?\u2019\u201d she laughs. \u201cAnd I always say, \u2018I drink a lot of espresso and I don\u2019t sleep much.\u2019\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/30-rock-director-millicen_n_303837", "page_content": "Director Millicent Shelton, 43, became an African-American first when she received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series for NBC's \"30 Rock.\" The award show may be over, but Shelton breaks down barriers and Hollywood's tough lessons.\n\nESSENCE.COM: Congratulations on your nomination.

I was told that pretty early on and I thought that can't be the truth, there has to be somebody else. I had a lot of people do some fact checking; the Director's Guild and the Academy checked then confirmed the news.

I think the reason why I've been able to do what I do is because I stick my head in the sand and move forward. I always believed my mother who said I could do whatever I wanted as long as I believed and worked hard enough. It's a naivet\u00e9 that works on my behalf. It didn't occur to me that it was difficult; if I thought about that all the time I went in to interview for a job people would smell that fear and nervousness and I probably wouldn't get hired.\n\nESSENCE.COM: What's the best advice you've ever received?\n\nSHELTON: Lavar Burton told me to \"just do you\" and that stuck.

Our readers would love to get to know you a bit better. Can you tell us a bit of the \u2018backstory\u2019 of how you grew up?\n\nI grew up in St. Louis way out in the suburbs. I went to college at Princeton university in new jersey and every weekend I\u2019d ride the train to New York City to hang out. It only made sense for me to move to new york after graduation and eventually earn my master's in film from NYU while directing music videos to pay the bills.\n\nCan you share a story with us about what brought you to this specific career path?\n\nI had to decide what I was going to major in at Princeton. I grew up believing that I wanted to be a lawyer but after interning for a summer at a law firm, I knew that was not the job for me. My mother told me to select a field that I loved but I had no clue what that was. It took me a while to do some soul searching. I remembered that I enjoyed creative writing. I took a summer course at NYU to explore what it was like to create a short film from a writer\u2019s perspective and ended up loving being a director. By the end of the summer, i knew that there was no other job but directing for me.\n\nCan you share the funniest or most interesting story that occurred to you in the course of your filmmaking career?\n\nOne of my craziest experiences on set came during the filming of \u201cend of the road.\u201d I had just called cut on a scene with beau bridges outside of our motel location and we started to set up for the next scene when suddenly the blue sky turned brown, and we were hit with high winds mixed with sand so thick that you couldn\u2019t see 3 feet in front of you. It\u2019s called a \u2018haboob\u2019 which is a crazy intense dust storm. It lasted for 45 minutes then suddenly stopped and the most breathtaking sunset appeared. We filmed the SUV driving up to the motel in that light.\n\nWho are some of the most interesting people you have interacted with? What was that like? Do you have any stories?\n\nI have worked with so many brilliantly talented people. It was a dream of a lifetime to work with Al Pacino on \u201cHunters\u2019. Every time I search for a visual film reference, one of his films appears! He\u2019s been in so many iconic movies, its mind-blowing. He was a truly lovely actor who was collaborative and giving. There was a moment the first day that we worked together that I thought maybe I shouldn\u2019t give Al Pacino a note, but that\u2019s my job as a director. I gave him notes but I made sure that they were smart notes that I could back up and notes that would further enhance the magic that he naturally creates. He gave me a big hug on his last day and said, \u201cI\u2019d like to work with you again, kid.\u201d I liked that he called me kid. It would be a blessing to work with Al again.\n\nNone of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?\n\nMy favorite professor at NYU was Nick Tanis. He taught me how to transform my daydreams into filmable images. Paris Barclay has been my mentor for years. I shadowed him off and on for 3 years trying to get my first break as a director in episodic television. On the first episode that I was hired on, Paris promised the producers that he would guide me through it and be there if I froze up then privately he told me that I could handle the job on my own which I did. Until covid, I was having an annual breakfast with David Nutter who is also a mentor to me. He was instrumental in helping me to move into action television and was a sounding board for me during my first pilot. There are countless other people that have helped me, but it would take up pages and pages! I am a driven person but have had lots of help along the way.\n\nCan you please give us your favorite \u201clife lesson quote\u201d? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?\n\n\u2018Never give up\u2019 is my favorite quote. I started directing during a time when women and especially women of color were not welcomed with open arms as Hollywood television directors. There were lots of doors that were not open. I wanted to give up a lot, but that quote would ring through my head. My testimony is that I am here today because I had blind faith and perseverance and did not give up on my dream.\n\nI am very interested in diversity in the entertainment industry. Can you share three reasons with our readers about why you think it\u2019s important to have diversity represented in film and television? How can that potentially affect our culture?\n\nI wholeheartedly believe in diversity. To me, diversity is a little bit of everyone, inclusive of all races, gender, and LGBTIQQ+. It\u2019s important because cinema should be reflective of real life and our world is diverse. The more we have diverse voices behind the screen, the more our stories will ring true and have realistic characters, dialogue, and actions. The more that we explore diverse stories, the more that we realize that despite our ethnic or socio-economic differences, we are all very much the same. Family is family. Fear is fear. Love is love.\n\nWhat are some of the most interesting or exciting projects you are working on now?\n\nBeing able to shepherd \u2018end of the road\u2019 has been a wonderful experience that I am very proud of. It was great to collaborate with queen Latifah again. We worked together to create a black family with a female matriarch who is a smart, strong, mama bear willing to do whatever is necessary to protect her family. After this, I am in development on a Josephine Baker limited series with Ruth Negga attached in the leading role. I am super excited about that. We\u2019re looking to delve deeper into Josephine than ever before. I can\u2019t wait to see what ruth does with this part. She\u2019s amazing!\n\nWhich aspect of your work makes you most proud? Can you explain or give a story?\n\nI am most proud of my ability to collaborate with actors. They are the conduit for the soul of the characters and I respect their position. I love hearing their point of view and then working to make sure that the feeling that they desire to convey is truly coming through. Both queen Latifah and Chris \u2018Ludacris\u2019 bridges were laser-focused on representing their characters in their truest light. They trusted me to give them feedback in order to make their performances stronger. Another actor that I\u2019ve worked with is Forest Whitaker. He is the king of nuanced performances. When I worked with him on \u2018empire\u2019, I noticed that he would subtly change his performance with each take. We\u2019d discuss it after each take and then land on the read that we both felt sold the story and character best.\n\nOk super. Here is the main question of our interview. What are your \u201c5 things I wish someone told me when I first started\u201d and why? Please share a story or example for each.\n\nGet sleep because production will seep into your dreams, and you will never have a sound sleep again. Trust your gut because you must stand up or fall down based on your own thoughts not because someone told you to do it. Be fearless. A healthy amount of fear is normal but don\u2019t be too scared that it limits your ability to dream outside of the box. Listen to everyone. This doesn\u2019t mean doing everything that everyone suggests but be smart enough and open enough to hear thoughts that may lead you to something great. Learn to say \u2018no.\u2019 it\u2019s actually a secret power.\n\nWhen you create a film, which stakeholders have the greatest impact on the artistic and cinematic choices you make? Is it the viewers, the critics, the financiers, or your own personal artistic vision? Can you share a story with us or give an example of what you mean?\n\nWhen I create, I can\u2019t think about what critics will say or it would make my mind spin. I read the material, daydream about it, and try to stay true to it. My goal is to take the 2-dimensional words off the page and breathe life into their 3-dimensional existence with the help of actors and amazing crew members. I like to say that as a director, \u2018i service script.\u2019\n\nYou are a person of great influence. If you could start a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-)\n\nMy movement would be for equality and parity for all. In particular, a woman\u2019s right to choose how she uses her body.\n\nWe are very blessed that some of the biggest names in business, vc funding, sports, and entertainment read this column. Is there a person in the world, or in the US whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might see this. :-)\n\nI would like to sit down and have a quiet lunch with president Barrack Obama. I can\u2019t imagine the stories he has to share but I know they are deep.\n\nHow can our readers further follow you online?\n\nThey can follow me on instagram at @shelton9mil. I try to keep it updated!\n\nThis was very meaningful, thank you so much! We wish you continued success!"}, {"url": "https://deadline.com/2021/02/ruth-negga-star-josephine-baker-limited-series-abc-signature-from-dee-harris-lawrence-lebron-james-springhill-1234693005/", "page_content": "EXCLUSIVE: The remarkable story of Josephine Baker, one of the most influential female entertainers of the 20th century, will be the subject of Josephine, a limited drama series in development at ABC Signature, with Ruth Negga attached to star as the legendary Jazz Age performer and civil rights activist.\n\nPrimetime-Panic Your Complete Guide to Pilots and Straight-to-Series orders See All\n\nNegga also executive produces the project, which hails from David Makes Man showrunner Dee Harris-Lawrence, Emmy-nominated director Millicent Shelton (30 Rock), LeBron James and Maverick Carter\u2019s The Springhill Company and ABC Signature.

At 19, she moved to France, which would become her adopted home country.\n\nCourtesy photo\n\nThere, she almost immediately found success as one of Europe\u2019s most popular and highest-paid performers. Early on, she was renowned as a dancer, and was among the most celebrated performers to headline the revues of the Folies Berg\u00e8re in Paris. She won admiration of cultural figures such as Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway and E.E. Cummings, earning herself nicknames like \u201cBlack Venus\u201d and \u201cBlack Pearl.\u201d Baker sang professionally for the first time in 1930, and several years later landed film roles as a singer in Zou-Zou and Princesse Tam-Tam.\n\nBaker worked for the French Resistance during World War II, and during the 1950s and \u201960s devoted herself to fighting segregation and racism in the United States. Baker refused to perform for segregated audiences in the U.S. and had an active role in the civil rights movement. She was a speaker at the 1963 March on Washington, and in 1968, she was offered unofficial leadership in the movement in the U.S. by Coretta Scott King, following Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s assassination, but declined the offer out of concern for the welfare of her children. Just two years after making a comeback to the stage, Baker died of a cerebral hemorrhage on April 12, 1975, and was buried with military honors.\n\nDecades later, Baker\u2019s life and work continues to influence top entertainment figures such as Beyonc\u00e9, who has portrayed her on various occasions. Baker also was portrayed by Diana Ross on Broadway and television in An Evening with Diana Ross, by Karine Plantadit in the biopic Frida and by Cush Jumbo in her debut play Josephine and I. In HBO\u2019s 1991 biopic, The Josephine Baker Story, Baker was played by Lynn Whitfield, who won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Special, becoming the first Black actress to win the category.\n\nBaker was recently discovered by a new generation through HBO\u2019s very influential 2020 series Lovecraft Country, which featured the American-born French entertainer, played by Carra Patterson. Also last year, Studiocanal, CPB Films and Leyland Films announced that they are developing an English-language drama series about Baker.\n\nNegga, best known for her starring roles in the film Loving and the AMC series Preacher, is repped by ICM Partners, Principal Entertainment and Markham Froggat and Irwin.\n\nFor Harris-Lawrence, Josephine falls outside of the big overall deal she recently signed with Warner Bros. TV, where she serves an exec producer/co-showrunner on All Rise and exec producer/showrunner on David Makes Man. Prior to that, she was co-executive producer on Unsolved: The Murders of Tupac and the Notorious B.I.G., Shots Fired and Star as well as Zoo, the ABC Signature-produced Detroit 1-8-7 and Saving Grace. She is repped by Rain Management Group and Gordon M. Bobb at Del Shaw Moonves.\n\nShelton, who has played a key role in putting Josephine together, landed an Emmy nomination for 30 Rock, becoming the first African-American woman to be nominated in the directing for a comedy series category. The prolific music video and TV helmer has been one of ABC Signature\u2019s go-to directors for Black-ish.

That opportunity served as a springboard to a directing career of her own across music videos, television, and film. Her direction of the 30 Rock episode \u201cApollo, Apollo\u201d would make her the first Black woman to receive an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series.\n\nWith Netflix\u2019s End of the Road (currently streaming), Shelton again works with star and producer Queen Latifah. In the film, Latifah plays Brenda, a recently widowed mother who loses her home in Los Angeles. After deciding to move home to Houston, Brenda travels across the Southwest with her brother (Ludacris) and two children (Mychala Lee, Shaun Dixon). On the journey, they run afoul of a major crime boss thanks to a bag of money that holds the potential to change their lives. The film asks viewers to experience the world through the eyes of this troubled Black family as they hold together in the face of traumatic danger.\n\nHere, in an interview with Awards Daily, Millicent Shelton talks about what drew her to the project and what it\u2019s like to work with Queen Latifah both in front of and behind the camera. She talks about the film\u2019s vivid color palate and the joyous luck in finding four actors who held so much natural chemistry together. Finally, she talks about the importance of inclusivity and the recent conversation around two major television series \u2014 HBO\u2019s House of the Dragon and Amazon Studio\u2019s The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power \u2014 who cast Black actors in major roles within the series.\n\nAwards Daily: I\u2019d like to start with recent controversies related to specific audiences rejecting inclusive efforts on such major projects as Rings of Power and House of the Dragon. How do you as a filmmaker react to that in a modern filmmaking environment? Does it make you even more determined to pursue inclusive projects?\n\nMillicent Shelton: It does. I tend to be a little bit of a rebel. I like to push against what people perceive as the norm. So the perception we have had in television and cinematically has been very Caucasian. Not only are white Americans used to that, but so are Black Americans or Asian Americans or Latino Americans. That\u2019s how a lot of body dysmorphia happens to Black girls and Latino girls and Asian girls. They don\u2019t see people like them represented as images of beauty. There\u2019s a movement now to change that.\n\nI honestly think that\u2019s what our country fought for \u2014 to have representation and freedom. If we\u2019re going to truly embrace what we say this country is about which is about embracing diversity and about the melting pot, then we should embrace that in front of and behind the camera as well. I honestly believe that we are stronger when we are like that. To me, diversity is not making an all Black film, not that I\u2019m against that. I think diversity is a mix of everybody, and it\u2019s not just different colors. It\u2019s also different religions. It\u2019s different sexual preferences. It\u2019s diversity of all, and that\u2019s what makes us as a country stronger because we get to experience a lot of different people\u2019s perspectives. I think that our creativity is better that way.\n\nIn this film, we had a mix of everyone in all key positions. We really functioned that way. I like to say that we were a crew that went through a lot of strenuous situations. We survived it as a team, and we survived it as a family. We were a very diverse family, but we survived it as a family.\n\nAD: So you have a Brazilian production designer and an Asian American cinematographer. The film has a very international visual flair. The roadside motel, in particular, doesn\u2019t look like any I\u2019ve ever seen. In fact, the entire color palate for the film is incredibly vibrant and bursting with deep, vivid colors.\n\nMS: [The motel room] is my Brazilian production designer. It\u2019s interesting because we kept looking for motel rooms, and we could not find them. They\u2019re all too little. So we decided to build it, but we had seen a reference for this one in a motel that doesn\u2019t exist anymore. It had cherubs on the wall, and that was it \u2014 Lucio\u2019s [Seixas, production designer] brain started to go. Our whole vision for this film was exaggerated reality. I wanted to push it outside of the realm of just playing on normal. So the idea of making these rooms a little over the top I embraced. We embraced the color too because we wanted extreme colors. That was kind of tough because we were shooting in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and a lot of the buildings there are beige. So, we found a gas station with a lot of color and a motel with a lot of color. Then, we added the neon tubes all around. Some people are freaked out by the color palette in this movie, but as an artist, I think sometimes we should push the boundaries of what people find to be regular.\n\nAD: The film offers this theme of the lack of connectivity, that lack of civilization, where the characters are left to their wits that have been dulled by modern technology. What was it about End of the Road that attracted you as a director?\n\nMS: What originally attracted me was the opportunity to work with Queen Latifah again. We\u2019ve sort of known each other from music videos in New York for a while, worked together on Star, and then the opportunity to work with her again\u2026 I just love working with her. Since this movie, we\u2019ve worked together on an episode of Equalizer. She\u2019s a wonderful talent. I read the script because she was attached to it. When I read it, I could relate to this woman who was reeling from the loss. The family was torn apart and found their way back to each other. From adversity, the family actually becomes stronger, and I could relate to that story. I wanted to tell that story, particularly about a Black family but it\u2019s not a story that\u2019s unique to a Black family. However, what they face going through these desolate areas with the racism that happens, both covert and overt, is something that Black people experience in the United States whether anybody wants to admit it or not. That\u2019s something that\u2019s our reality, and I wanted to be able to show that.\n\nAD: As you\u2019ve mentioned, you have worked with Queen Latifah multiple times. What was it like working with her as both an actress and as a producer on this film?\n\nMS: She functions primarily as an actress. She doesn\u2019t throw the weight of the producer title on you. She comes in with a pure heart, and she really is in the state of mind of an actress. When we got into post-production, then she went into producer mode and was really helpful in supporting me through getting this film done. So, it actually worked really well. But as an actress, she shows up prepared, and she\u2019s willing to get feedback. She\u2019s willing to give feedback, which I think is great. I love to get feedback from actors because I really admire what actors bring to the table as they bring a different sensibility than even the writers or the director brings because they live through the spirit of a character. When I hear what their thoughts are about the words and what\u2019s happening to that character, I really take that to heart. I find that it makes all the scenes better.\n\nAll the times in the movie where she makes reference to her dead husband, that\u2019s all Latifah. I lost my mother a month before we went into prep on this movie, and so I was reeling from that loss. She said, \u2018You know, when you lose somebody, you talk to them. They stay with you.\u2019 And so we talked about it. We picked moments in the film when Brenda would say something to her husband. That\u2019s how those moments came alive. That\u2019s all from the actor having a thought about the spirit of the character.\n\nAD: The film rises on those moments of that core family group. How did you work with those four actors to build that incredible chemistry that really comes across on screen?\n\nMS: The chemistry actually was there naturally. It\u2019s interesting. Queen Latifah actually recommended Ludacris for the role of Reggie. After the first time I talked to him, I was like he\u2019s Reggie. He\u2019s not really Reggie in real life, but when we were talking about it, he understood Reggie. The next person that we cast was Mikayla, who plays the daughter, and she just stood out amongst everybody. She\u2019s a wonderful actress. I just actually got to work with her again on a couple of episodes of Truth Be Told for Apple. We did a lot of chemistry test reads with her and the potentials for the brother, and Shawn read and it was just immediately chemistry. You just saw brother and sister. They went at it. They were ad libbing, and they just went at it. It was just like another brother and sister. Then, we had a cast dinner a few nights before the first day of shooting. It was just those four characters, and we had a really lovely long dinner. We just were all talking about our lives and our dreams and kind of where we came from. They started to bond as a family, and the rest was just magic. They really felt like a real family. They had nicknames for each other and everything.\n\nAD: Last question for you: let\u2019s say you have the keys to the kingdom. You\u2019ve worked in television, you\u2019ve worked in streaming, you\u2019ve worked in film, and you\u2019ve worked in music videos. You\u2019ve done a little bit of everything. If there were no barriers and budget wasn\u2019t a concern, then what would be your dream project?\n\nMS: I have a dream project right now I want to do. I want to do a limited series about Josephine Baker starring Ruth Negga. That\u2019s what I want to do.\n\nEnd of the Road is now streaming exclusively on Netflix."}, {"url": "https://paw.princeton.edu/article/millicent-shelton-88-excels-directors-chair", "page_content": "Courtesy Millicent Shelton\n\nEmmy-nominated writer and director Millicent Shelton \u201988 has directed music videos for the likes of R.

Courtesy Millicent Shelton\n\n\u201cWhen I returned to Princeton, [Sitney] taught me almost everything I know to this day about film theory,\u201d Shelton says.\n\nHer first job in the film industry was as a wardrobe production assistant on 1989\u2019s Do the Right Thing, written and directed by Spike Lee, who was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nWorking on the film was a transformative experience. Shelton slept on the floor of her sister\u2019s Brooklyn brownstone and worked for nothing until earning a promotion to production assistant (\u201ca very small paycheck, but it at least put food in my mouth,\u201d she says). \u201cI had never been on a film set before or with \u2018real\u2019 actors. It was amazing to see Ossie Davis transform into Da Mayor as he walked down the street to the set,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI learned so much \u2014 and it was the hottest summer in New York City!\u201d\n\nAfterward, Shelton co-wrote a script with music producer Hurby Azor for hip-hop duo Kid \u2019n Play. Although it was never completed, the project led to her directing the videos for two Salt-n-Pepa songs, \u201cExpressions\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About Sex.\u201d She eventually founded her own production company and directed almost 100 music videos.\n\nShelton wrote and directed the 1998 comedy feature Ride. However, the script was changed in pre-production without her knowledge, souring her experience on the project and disillusioning her with the film industry. Actor Dean Cain \u201988, a friend and classmate, encouraged her to try directing television.\n\nSince then, she\u2019s directed more than 60 TV episodes, spanning drama, comedy, and action. \u201cI think the knowledge of all three has made me a better director,\u201d she says. \u201cI can bring heart to a comedy, momentary lightness to a drama, and both to an action show.

I was completely surprised to learn that you're the first Black woman to get a nod in this category.\n\nMILLICENT SHELTON: I was surprised too! I was told that pretty early on and I thought that can't be the truth, there has to be somebody else. I had a lot of people do some fact checking; the Director's Guild and the Academy checked then confirmed the news.

I think the reason why I've been able to do what I do is because I stick my head in the sand and move forward.

She wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\n\nBy Margy Rochlin\n\n\n\nKEEPING HER COOL: Shelton tries to find comedy in the chaos and defuse tension with laughter.\n\nMillicent Shelton found herself walking onto the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank and wondering for a second, \u201cWhere am I again?\u201d For Shelton, this sort of momentary geographic disconnect means that business is booming. Over the past seven years, Shelton has directed a far-flung variety of episodic TV shows, from her Emmy-nominated installment of NBC\u2019s 30 Rock to TNT\u2019s now-defunct rumination on the male midlife crisis, Men of a Certain Age, to 90210, the CW\u2019s glossy update of the classic Aaron Spelling teen soap.\n\n\u201cI love being a guest director. I love it,\u201d Shelton says sitting in the dining room of her spacious townhouse seizing a quiet moment for dinner while her 4-year-old twins are asleep upstairs. \u201cI have director\u2019s [attention deficit disorder],\u201d says Shelton who possesses the perfect attributes for someone whose occupation involves only occasionally returning to the same set twice: an upbeat outlook, bottomless reserves of energy, a restless mind, and a love of prepping. \u201cI get bored if I have to do the same thing over and over again. I love jumping around to different shows and different styles of shooting.\u201d\n\nBut back in 2005, Shelton\u2014whose earliest credits include writing and directing music videos for chart-toppers such as Salt-N-Pepa, R. Kelly, and Aaliyah\u2014didn\u2019t immediately grasp the rich possibilities of what a helmer-for-hire could contribute to an established, long-running television series. \u201cIn music videos it was all about being original, it was all about me, my vision,\u201d says Shelton. \u201cWhen I started doing television I thought my job was to disappear. I thought it was about doing their show the way they\u2019d always done it. Then I learned that\u2019s not what they want. They want me to stay within the box of their show but to give it the Millicent twist.\u201d\n\nWhat Shelton quickly found was that by throwing herself into full-bore research mode\u2014meticulously watching as many previous episodes as she could and poring over old scripts\u2014when she hit the set she could easily discern when to shoot a scene in the pre- ordained style of the show and where she could insert a creative flourish. Whenever possible, Shelton worked with actors who might have gone on autopilot to help bring nuances to a performance. Often without anyone noticing, she\u2019d slip in what she considers her signature\u2014a cinematic wide shot such as the one featured in an episode of Californication. \u201cIt was sort of an homage to Beverly Hills Cop,\u201d says Shelton, referring to a fleeting bit of footage in an exchange at a firing range between David Duchovny\u2019s dissipated Hollywood screenwriter character and a bonkers rap magnate.\n\nIt was on her second episodic gig ever\u2014The Bernie Mac Show\u2014when it dawned on Shelton that she also had the right upbringing for someone who would often find herself face to face with the behavioral unpredictability of talent. From Day One until the Martini Shot, Mac, the sitcom\u2019s creator and star, found reasons to carp at Shelton. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh my God. He hates me.\u2019 But I got through it. On the last day, Bernie took me aside and said, \u2018You have thick skin. I like you.\u2019 It was a test,\u201d says Shelton. She passed, crediting both her internal grit and tendency to see humor in pandemonium, something she learned from being the youngest of four children in her St. Louis household. \u201cI got picked on a lot. I can deal with an actor who\u2019s having a bad day, missing their kids, being in a bad mood. It isn\u2019t personal. I try to defuse things with laughter. I find comedy in a lot of chaos. Things are going crazy and everybody else is freaking out, and I\u2019m like, \u2018This is kind of funny.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe way Shelton tells the story of how she ended up in show business definitely has its elements of slapstick. After getting her undergraduate degree in English from Princeton and at occupational loose ends, Shelton\u2019s older sister urged her to send a resume to her friend David Lee\u2019s brother, Spike. The next thing she knew, Shelton was the most overly educated production assistant in the wardrobe department of Lee\u2019s 1989 race relations drama, Do the Right Thing. When that wrapped, she landed a spot in wardrobe at The Cosby Show. In the hopes of using a short film she was making to get into film school, she solicited her blunt-speaking boss as a test audience of one. \u201c[Bill Cosby] gave me some really harsh criticism,\u201d says Shelton with a weak smile, \u201cwhich I needed to hear, but I recut it and submitted it to Tisch [School of the Arts at NYU] and I got in.\u201d\n\n\n\nShelton working with Virginia Madsen on the cable movie Hornet's Nest.\n\nNo one can say it has always been easy. After her 1998 hip-hop road trip feature debut, Ride, which she wrote and directed, performed weakly at the box office, Shelton found it a struggle to get work. But instead of complaining she went back to the drawing board and shadowed veteran director and Guild first vice president Paris Barclay (NYPD Blue, Sons of Anarchy) for three years. \u201cA lot of people\u2014black, white, and other, men and women\u2014don\u2019t succeed because they give up. I didn\u2019t give up,\u201d says Shelton, a member of the DGA\u2019s African American Steering Committee, which, in addition to tributes and educational events, actively explores ways to assist the Guild in improving employment opportunities for members of color. \u201cOpening your show up to different vantage points actually can be a really good thing,\u201d says Shelton, who when confronted by doubters uses herself as a case in point. \u201cI\u2019m an African-American female. You wouldn\u2019t think I\u2019d do so well on a show called Men of a Certain Age. You wouldn\u2019t think that would be a match. But it was a great match.\u201d\n\nOver the past several months, Shelton has directed the pilot episode from MTV\u2019s Awkward and a TV movie of best-selling crime novelist Patricia Cornwell\u2019s Hornet\u2019s Nest for TNT.

Chun / Los Angeles Times)\n\nMelissa Rosenberg had a modest goal: For the second season of her Netflix series \u201cMarvel\u2019s Jessica Jones,\u201d which premiered Thursday, at least 50% of the directors would be female.\n\nBut in conversations with Allie Goss, vice president of original series at Netflix, they established a new mandate: All 13 directors would be women.\n\n\u201cI've been on 25 years of shows, and nine times out of 10, those directing staffs are all white men,\u201d said the showrunner, whose long list of credits dates back to \u201cParty of Five.\u201d \u201cSo why not all women?\u201d\n\nHad she simply turned to the usual industry gatekeepers \u2014 typically agents with a tried-and-true Rolodex of names \u2014 the task might have seemed daunting: \u201cYou're always handed a list with all the white guys,\u201d Rosenberg said.\n\nInstead, she reached out to fellow showrunners, did a lot of Googling and quickly discovered that \u201cit was really not at all difficult to find 13 terrific female directors.\u201d\n\nRELATED: 'Jessica Jones' regroups for Season 2 \u00bb\n\n(L.A. Times Graphics)\n\nThe Netflix drama, which puts a feminist spin on the typically male-dominated superhero genre, is the latest television series to make the hiring of female directors a priority. For two seasons now, Ava DuVernay's \"Queen Sugar\" (OWN) has been directed entirely by women, while on shows as disparate as \"The Deuce\u201c (HBO), \u201cFeud\u201d (FX), \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d (CW), \u201cTransparent\u201d (Amazon) and \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d (Hulu), at least half of all episodes have been directed by women.\n\nWhile a recent study by the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative found that women directed only 7.3% of the top 100 movies in 2017, 21% of all episodes in the 2016-17 television season were directed by women, according to the Directors Guild of America, up from 17% the year before. TV may still be far from achieving gender parity, but it is trending that way; women also accounted for 32% of first-time episodic directors in 2016-17, an 8% increase from the year before.\n\nThese gains coincide with a rising awareness of systemic discrimination and abuse within the business, and a growing willingness to speak out against Hollywood\u2019s power imbalance. (See Frances McDormand\u2019s push for an inclusion rider onstage at last week\u2019s Oscars.)\n\nMORE: From big screen to small and back again, these ladies have made the journey \u00bb\n\nBut they are also the result of changes within television specifically. Individual A-list producers like Rosenberg, DuVernay, Shonda Rhimes, Jill Soloway and Ryan Murphy, increasingly recruit women and people of color. Meanwhile, in response to media scrutiny, guild pressure and, perhaps more important, the success of the folks listed above, networks and studios are realizing the value of inclusive storytelling and investing in initiatives and mentorship programs.\n\nIt took a while but we\u2019re seeing this normalization that it\u2019s not only OK to hire a female, it\u2019s necessary.\u201d \u2014 Gail Mancuso, director\n\nAnd of course, the sheer number of shows being produced in the age of \u201cPeak TV\u201d has led to greater demand for talent.\n\n\u201cI feel like the times are definitely changing,\u201d said Gail Mancuso, a two-time Emmy winner for her work on \u201cModern Family.\u201d \u201cIt took a while but we\u2019re seeing this normalization that it\u2019s not only OK to hire a female, it\u2019s necessary.\"\n\nGail Mancuso on the set for \u201cModern Family\u201d in 2012. (Peter \u201cHopper\u201d Stone / ABC)\n\nTV in the lead\n\nIf awards are any indication, TV has long had the edge on film. Twenty-five years before Kathryn Bigelow became the first \u2014 and so far, only \u2014 woman to win a directing Oscar, Karen Arthur picked up an Emmy for directing \u201cCagney & Lacey.\u201d Numerous women have since repeated the feat, including Reed Morano for her work last year on \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d\n\nBut for many years, women who wanted to direct were dependent on powerful producers and stars willing to buck tradition and give them a shot.\n\nMancuso came up through the ranks as a script supervisor, eventually becoming an assistant director on \u201cRoseanne\u201d learning the ropes from male mentors: \u201cI say male because they were all male at the time,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen a directing slot became available during the fourth season, however, Mancuso approached the show\u2019s star, Roseanne Barr.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Hey, look, he\u2019s leaving and I\u2019d like to direct that spot.\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, go ahead.\u2019 After I directed that episode, she whispered in my ear at curtain call: \u2018I\u2019m going to give you the whole next season.\u2019\u201d\n\nJamie Babbit had similar support from a big female star; she was hired as a director in the fifth season of \u201cAlias\u201d after star Jennifer Garner voiced frustration that only six out of 105 episodes were directed by women.\n\n\u201cThe producer I met with was like, \u2018Hey, I decided to meet with you because Jennifer Garner keeps complaining that we\u2019re not hiring any women,\u2019\u201d Babbit recalled. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018Good for her. Good for her for \u2018complaining.\u2019 Her being persistent is the reason I got hired.\u201d\n\nMORE: Tips from directors for the next generation of women looking to break in \u00bb\n\nFollowing escalating complaints about Hollywood\u2019s diversity problem and bolstered by reports detailing the consistently grim statistics, more recent progress has come thanks in part to the concerted efforts of influential showrunners like Rosenberg, an Emmy-nominated producer who wrote all five blockbuster \u201cTwilight\u201d movies. Two years ago, Ryan Murphy launched the Half Initiative with the goal of providing more opportunities for women and people of color behind the camera. DuVernay, an Oscar nominee and forceful advocate for industry change, has turned \u201cQueen Sugar\u201d into a launching pad for untapped talent.\n\nDeMane Davis had made two independent features before DuVernay hired her as a director on the second season of the family drama. The success of shows like \u201cQueen Sugar,\u201d she said, has not only altered the course of her career, it\u2019s also forced the industry to break out of old habits.\n\n\u201cIf you usually get a salad for lunch, the people around you are going to assume you want a salad for lunch,\u201d said Davis. \u201cYou have to say, \u2018I want quinoa.\u2019 Suddenly the whole world has opened up and the person next to you is like, \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 Now everyone\u2019s eating quinoa.\u201d\n\nGetting star showrunners and executive producers on board is one thing. But in a fast-paced business with short turnover time and millions of dollars at stake, network and studio executives also have approval power. And they can often turn a string of \u201cyeses\u201d \u2014 particularly for newcomers \u2014 into a dead end.\n\nNow they really are responsive. They're saying, \u2018Give us lists of directors that you know.\u2019\u201d \u2014 Bethany Rooney, TV director\n\nBethany Rooney is a veteran TV director (\u201cNCIS\u201d) who got her first break on \u201cSt. Elsewhere\u201d from producer Bruce Paltrow. As co-chair of the Directors Guild of America\u2019s Diversity Task Force, she\u2019s spent years meeting with studios and networks to encourage them to do better.\n\nWhile Rooney said they once \u201chad a big chip on their shoulder,\u201d she has witnessed \u201ca huge attitudinal shift.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow they really are responsive. They're saying, \u2018Give us lists of directors that you know. Give us lists of people who've been through the program and we will hire them,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nIn 2014, the guild secured an industry first: an agreement that all the major TV studios would establish or maintain training programs for diverse directors. (Despite DGA efforts, the studios have not agreed to implement inclusion efforts on the film side.)\n\nNBC, for example, recently launched Female Forward to increase the pool of female directors in episodic television. Spearheaded by the network\u2019s then-President Jennifer Salke and Emmy-nominated director Lesli Linka Glatter (\u201cMad Men,\u201d \u201cHomeland\u201d), the initiative allows 10 female directors to shadow a director on an NBC series and then direct at least one episode on her own.\n\nMore than 1,000 women applied for its inaugural class.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to put men out of work, we\u2019re just trying to make an extreme statement to turbocharge change,\u201d said Salke, who recently became head of Amazon Studios.\n\nMORE: Kerry Washington takes the director's chair on 'Scandal' \u00bb\n\nTwo years ago, a Variety report spotlighting the lack of diversity among TV directors found that only 5% of episodes at FX were directed by women, making FX dead last among top-tier cable, streaming and broadcast networks.\n\nSobered by the statistics, Chief Executive John Landgraf wrote a letter to all the network\u2019s showrunners asking for help. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if this is like the law of gravity and cannot be controlled,\u201d he said in an interview with The Times. \u201cThis must clearly be a matter of will.\u201d By the end of 2017, women directed 37% of episodes.\n\n(L.A. Times Graphics)\n\n\u201cWe have built a better meritocracy by doing this, and any of our competitors who want to compete with us better get their butts in gear,\u201d said Landgraf. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find, promote, hire and enjoy the benefits of a deeper, broader and better talent pool.\u201d\n\nThe sheer volume of television programming\u2014 4,500 episodes were produced in the 2016-17 season, according to the DGA \u2014 has certainly created an unprecedented opportunity, and women directed 955 of those episodes, 253 more than in the previous season. Whereas the total number of episodes increased by 10% from the previous season, the total number of them directed by women increased by 36%, indicating that women are benefiting substantially more from Peak TV.\n\nThe statistics also show \u201chow many qualified women there are who are ready and willing to step into that leadership position,\u201d said Karyn Kusama, who began directing TV after frustrating experiences on studio films. \u201cIt\u2019s the question of giving them the chair to sit in and the set to command, and television just has more opportunities for that.\u201d\n\nThe rise of female-driven narratives is also a factor, she said, citing her experience on the AMC tech drama, \u201cHalt and Catch Fire,\u201d which focused on two pioneering women in the \u201980s personal computing boom.\n\n\u201cMy sense of closeness to them was part of why I kept going back and getting asked back,\u201d she said.\n\nFor cast and crew, having women in a leadership position on set can also feel revelatory.\n\nThe title role in \u201cJessica Jones\u201d includes filming a lot of technical sex scenes and star Krysten Ritter says she feels \u201cmore comfortable being very raw and vulnerable with a female director.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s just a shorthand with another woman when you\u2019re talking about where you\u2019re going to put your leg so they can see this much of your butt,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cJessica Jones\u201d directors from left: Neasa Hardiman, Jennifer Getzinger, Jennifer Lynch and Uta Briesewitz. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)\n\nReview: 'Jessica Jones' is back with second season \u00bb\n\nObstacles to progress\n\nStill, it\u2019s hard to shatter a glass ceiling when the industry operates on a Must Have Experience loop. The biggest hurdle female filmmakers face is a reluctance to provide the so-called \u201cfirst\u201d credit in an episodic directing career.\n\nAs simple and obvious as it may seem, part of the solution lies in eliminating what \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d creator and showrunner Jennie Snyder Urman described as the \u201cCan a woman do this?\u201d filter.\n\n\u201cI have the opposite filter,\u201d she said. \u201cI apply the one that says: \u2018Of course women can \u2014 women do everything.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor Lisa Demaine, a longtime first assistant director whose credits include \u201cSeabiscuit\u201d and \u201cWestworld,\u201d it\u2019s taken nearly three decades to land a directorial debut. She\u2019ll make her bow with an episode in the third season of Fox\u2019s \u201cLucifer,\u201d which begins filming later this month.\n\nOver the course of four years, Demaine logged more than 100 meetings with studio and network executives, showrunners and executive producers. Despite positive feedback and early greenlights, none of the meetings resulted in an actual gig.\n\n\u201cThey all say, \u2018yes!,\u2019 they all say, \u2018we love you\u2019 and \u2018you\u2019re amazing,\u2019\u201d said Demaine.\u201d \u201cBut at the end of the day, they don\u2019t want to be your first. That Catch-22 is really, really big. If no one gives you the break, how do you get in the door?\u201d\n\nWomen also still face a stereotypical view about the types of projects they are considered capable of directing.\n\n\u201cPeople decide \u2018you\u2019re going to do the softer material, you\u2019re going to do the romance,\u201d said Julie-Anne Robinson, whose credits include \u201cThe Good Place\u201d and \u201cScandal.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not going to [get] something like \u2018Vikings.\u2019 I love shooting action. I just did an episode of \u2018Castle Rock,\u2019 which is horror. But it\u2019s a constant fight.\u201d\n\nOthers spoke of the way women are lumped together, hearing things like, \u201cOh, we had a woman, she wasn\u2019t so good.\u201d\n\nALSO: Ava DuVernay doubles down on women directors for \u2018Queen Sugar\u2019: Meet the new crew \u00bb\n\n\u201cIf a guy comes and directs a bad episode of television,\u201d said Beth McCarthy-Miller whose credits include \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cVeep,\u201d they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, God, that guy kind of stinks.\u2019 But he\u2019ll keep getting hired. If a woman comes and directs a bad episode of television, they\u2019re like, \u2018See, women can\u2019t direct.\u2019 All of us. It\u2019s absurd.\u201d\n\nTelevision is currently in the throes of pilot season \u2014 a time when experience and familiarity tend to win out. Even as their numbers increase, it\u2019s only a small group of female directors who swim in the pilot season pool.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same group of six or seven experienced women directors who have opportunities to direct on 450 things,\u201d Salke said.\n\nThere is a wealth of directors out there and a lot of the great ones are women.\u201d \u2014 Jennifer Lynch, \"Jessica Jones\" director\n\nThis year moved the needle. Last pilot season, four women were hired to direct 10 of the 70 broadcast pilots in 2017. This season, 18 women directed 23 of 75 broadcast pilots \u2014 several are first-time pilot directors.\n\nAs television has gained prestige, so too has the role of director, once viewed as a hired gun in a writer\u2019s world. TV\u2019s creative renaissance has led to a rise in cinematic storytelling and inventive visuals and increasingly entire seasons of a series helmed by a single filmmaker.\n\nThe trend began with men like Cary Fukunaga on \u201cTrue Detective\u201d and Steven Soderbergh on \u201cThe Knick.\u201d But lately, women such as Mary Harron (\u201cAlias Grace\u201d), Pamela Adlon (\u201cBetter Things\u201d) and Andrea Arnold (Season 2 of \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d) are also being viewed as auteurs.\n\nStill, for every \u201cQueen Sugar\u201d or \u201cJessica Jones\u201d there are far more examples of shows like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d or \u201cKevin Can Wait\u201d where the women directors are scarce or non-existent.\n\nMartha Lauzen, a professor at San Diego State University who has been monitoring women in Hollywood for more than 20 years, said what we\u2019re seeing today is a \u201cpiecemeal approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have pockets of progress due to the individual efforts from people like Ava DuVernay or Ryan Murphy or whomever,\u201d Lauzen said. \u201cThat\u2019s great. But again, it\u2019s a handful of individuals. We would need to see an industry-wide commitment to move the numbers significantly.\u201d\n\nIn the end, said many of the women who spoke to The Times, the goal is for gender to be immaterial.\n\n\u201cThere is a wealth of directors out there and a lot of the great ones are women,\u201d said \u201cJessica Jones\u201d director Jennifer Lynch. \u201cBut you don't walk up to Spielberg and say \u2018You are a great male film director.\u2019\u201d\n\nmeredith.blake@latimes.com\n\nFollow me @MeredithBlake\n\nyvonne.villarreal@latimes.com\n\nFollow me @Villarrealy"}]}
