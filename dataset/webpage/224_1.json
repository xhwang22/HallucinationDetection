{"The members of NoFX are Fat Mike as the vocalist/bassist, Eric Melvin as the lead guitarist, El Hefe as the rhythm guitarist, and Erik Sandin as the drummer.": [{"url": "https://www.allmusic.com/artist/nofx-mn0000317545/biography", "page_content": "An influential and long-running Southern California punk band with hook-filled tunes and a snarky sense of humor, NOFX formed in 1983 around a core lineup consisting of vocalist/bassist Fat Mike, guitarist Eric Melvin, and drummer Erik Sandin. Since debuting in 1988 with Liberal Animation, they have steered clear of major labels and commercial exposure over their decades-long career, recording an impressive number of full-length albums, including the gold-selling Punk in Drublic (1994) and So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes (1996), plus an assortment of EPs and singles. In 2021, the group issued their 14th studio long-player, Single Album, their ninth consecutive Billboard 200-charting studio release. Double Album arrived in 2022.\n\nThe band started out as a trio comprising vocalist/bassist Fat Mike (Mike Burkett), guitarist Eric Melvin, and drummer Erik Sandin (aka Erik Ghint/Erik Shun). Sandin quit in 1985, and his place was taken by Scott Sellers; that same year, NOFX also recorded two 7\" EPs for the Mystic label, No F-X and So What If We're on Mystic? Sellers quit shortly thereafter and was replaced by Scott Aldahl for only two weeks, at which point Sandin rejoined the band; vocalist Dave Allen also joined in 1986, but his tenure was tragically cut short by a fatal car accident. Dave Casillas joined as a second guitarist later in the year, by which point NOFX's touring schedule had become far-ranging and rigorous. The EP The P.M.R.C. Can Suck on This was released on Fat Mike's own Fat Wreck Chords label in 1987. Casillas departed the group in 1989 and was replaced by Steve Kidwiller for NOFX's first full-length album, S&M Airlines, which was released on the legendary punk label Epitaph; the band has remained there ever since, despite the release of several albums -- including 1995's I Heard They Suck Live -- and EPs on Fat Wreck Chords, which gradually grew into a premier stable of punk revival artists.\n\nHaving appeared on 1990's Ribbed and 1991's Liberal Animation (which was actually recorded in 1988), Kidwiller left the band in 1991, and Aaron Abeyta became the permanent second guitarist (as well as trumpeter), adopting the nickname El Hefe. Dragged into the mainstream spotlight by the mid-'90s success of labelmates Bad Religion and the Offspring, NOFX compensated with albums like 1992's White Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean, that were even closer to the anti-commercial extreme exemplified by White Trash's accompanying single \"Please Play This Song on the Radio,\" which lured un-alert radio programmers with a tight melody, but ends with a stream of obscenities. The El Hefe-anchored lineup continued to blossom with 1994's Punk in Drublic; often regarded as the band's best, the album was eventually certified gold. Releases on Fat Wreck Chords continued throughout the '90s, as did the full-length Epitaph albums, like 1996's grungier, less uptempo Heavy Petting Zoo, 1997's punkier So Long & Thanks for All the Shoes, and 2000's Pump Up the Valuum and Bottles to the Ground; the latter album followed an experimental Fat Wreck Chords EP titled The Decline, which consisted entirely of the 18-minute title track. Next up was the Surfer EP, which showcased select sloppy cuts in spring 2001, with the first 500 copies on colored vinyl.\n\nIn 2002, NOFX sifted through countless tapes and recording sessions, eventually collecting 47 songs for 45 or 46 Songs That Weren't Good Enough to Go on Our Other Records. \"Pimps and Hookers,\" which was the only new song on the album, was recorded in one day. Later that year, BYO Records got the band to release the NOFX/Rancid split album BYO Split Series, Vol. 3. This particular record had Rancid covering six NOFX tracks while NOFX returned the favor by switching up six Rancid songs. The four-song EP Regaining Unconsciousness came out in March 2003 and served as a teaser for May's The War on Errorism, released on Fat Wreck and littered with political criticisms. Given the band's outspoken and leftist nature, it was not surprising when they launched Punk Voter, a movement of punk bands that sought to politically empower disenfranchised youth and vote George W. Bush out of office. The organization remained in action even after Bush's 2004 reelection.\n\nBack on the music front, NOFX next released the EP Never Trust a Hippy in March 2006, the full-length Wolf in Wolves' Clothing one month later, and the live album They've Actually Gotten Worse Live! the following year. The band's 11th studio album, Coaster, arrived in 2009, paired with a documentary of the band's international 2008 tour in the form of the Fuse network's series Backstage Passport. In 2012, NOFX offered up a more self-aware set of songs on their 12th studio album, Self Entitled. A number of singles followed, and were collected on 2013's Stoke Extinguisher, which featured a new track as well as the B-sides from the previous year's 7\" releases. Fat Mike spent much of 2014 writing songs for a punk rock musical entitled Home Street Home. Along with the rest of NOFX, he collaborated with members of Alkaline Trio, Dance Hall Crashers, the Living End, and even Tony Award-winning vocalist Lena Hall on the soundtrack, which arrived in early 2015 as the final touches were put on the theatrical production.\n\nNOFX released the warts-and-all autobiography The Hepatitis Bathtub and Other Stories in 2016, while also announcing the release of their 13th studio album, First Ditch Effort. Arriving in October, the record was preceded by the harder-edged single \"Six Years on Dope,\" which documented Fat Mike's troubles with substance abuse and his subsequent cleanup. In 2018, after courting controversy for comments made about the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting, NOFX were pulled from festival slots and they canceled their U.S. tour. Their third live album, Ribbed: Live in a Dive, arrived that August.\n\nIn March 2020, while in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic, the group began sharing a series of songs from a forthcoming album they planned on releasing in the fall. These tracks included topical songs like \"Just the Flu,\" \"I Love You More Than I Hate Me,\" and, true to the band's irreverent character, \"Thatcher Fucked the Kids.\" The resulting Single Album was released in January 2021, hitting number 26 on Billboard's Independent Albums chart. That September, NOFX revealed their plans to call it quits in 2023, around the time of their 40th anniversary. A year later, they released the track \"Darby Crashing,\" a revamped version of a song initially included on the band's 7-inch of the Month Club series, which served as the lead single off their 2022 full-length Double Album."}, {"url": "https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/music/i-came-out-of-the-closet-nofxs-fat-mike-says-about-latest-album", "page_content": "Mike Burkett, better known as Fat Mike of the punk band NOFX, loves his leather sheets. At the mere mention of them during a recent video interview with The Chronicle, he jumped out of his chair to grab one and show it off.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a duvet, and it\u2019s lambskin. It\u2019s awesome. I won\u2019t go anywhere without it,\u201d said the NOFX singer and president of Fat Wreck Chords as he draped the blanket over himself from his home in Los Angeles, where he splits his time between living in San Francisco. \u201cI have leather pillowcases too, but I\u2019m like a true fetishist. A couple people have told me that \u2018you\u2019re the biggest fetishist I\u2019ve ever met.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNOFX doesn\u2019t have a live show booked until the Punk Rock Bowling festival in Las Vegas in September, but the band has spent the past month promoting its new record, \u201cSingle Album,\u201d out Friday, Feb. 26. And there\u2019s plenty to talk about.\n\nNOFX\u2019s 14th studio album features songs about Burkett\u2019s drug addiction (\u201cBirmingham,\u201d \u201cDoor and Fours\u201d), mass shootings (\u201cFish in a Gun Barrel\u201d) and the failures of America\u2019s health care system (\u201cMy Bro Cancervive Cancer\u201d), among other hot topics. But Burkett, at times wrapped in his leather blanket, spent a lot of time discussing the track \u201cF\u2014 Euphemism,\u201d which reveals a lot about his love of BDSM and how he identifies as queer.\n\n\u201cI came out of the closet with that song,\u201d Burkett said. \u201cI\u2019m queer, but I\u2019m not gay. I just do whatever I want to.\u201d\n\nBurkett said it\u2019s the \u201cmost important song on the album,\u201d and he loves how it has sparked \u201clittle controversy\u201d since NOFX released a lyric video for it this month, pointing to how much progress society has made when it comes to openly talking about sexuality. While coming out as queer is an aspect of Burkett\u2019s song, it focuses on his long-stated belief that kink should be included in the LGBTQ initialism.\n\nI love that LBGTQ will never include K\n\n\u2018Cause they say that unlike cis queers kinksters make a choice\n\nThey\u2019re wrong, but yes, we choose which gag to take away our voice\n\nThe song is inspired by his kink proclivities and is but another step for him in becoming more open with his sexual identity with his fans. Early in NOFX\u2019s career, Burkett hinted at his interest in BDSM with songs like \u201cS&M Airlines,\u201d and in 2016 he went into graphic detail about his sexual history in the group memoir \u201cNOFX: The Hepatitis Bathtub and Other Stories.\u201d He even recently tried to start a company that designs panties for men, which he had to shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But it wasn\u2019t until this latest album that Burkett sang about not seeing himself as cisgender because of his ingrained love of BDSM.\n\n\u201cI remember the first time I got rolled up in a Twister mat when I was 5. I remember the feeling of that, of being swaddled in plastic,\u201d Burkett said. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand photos just of naked people. My sexuality, which I really started to understand at 11 or 12, was kink.\u201d\n\nNOFX guitarist Eric Melvin, who co-founded NOFX in L.A. with Burkett in 1983, said that while Burkett\u2019s sexual experimentation increased over time, the punk singer has always used sex to relate to people and the band has always embraced it.\n\n\u201cAs far as back as I can remember, Mike always freely shared his sex life and preferences, and I noticed those things evolved over time. He would talk about the kinds of things that people didn\u2019t usually discuss in the open \u2014 at least they weren\u2019t discussed openly around the people I knew,\u201d Melvin said. \u201cI think this is Mikey\u2019s way of connecting to people and giving them a chance to share the things that people don\u2019t usually discuss openly.\u201d\n\nBurkett, who spent much of his life in L.A., moved to the Bay Area in 1985 to attend San Francisco State University, where he majored in social science and minored in human sexuality. That\u2019s when Burkett said he dived deep into San Francisco\u2019s BDSM culture, a scene so prevalent in the city that it crossed over into music in such ways as the infamous Stinky\u2019s Peep Show at the Covered Wagon Saloon, which combined live punk bands with \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 a peep show.\n\n\u201cIt was a dollar to see the peep show, and it was worth every penny,\u201d Burkett recalled. \u201cI was with Rivers Cuomo from Weezer and Lars Frederiksen from Rancid \u2026 and in the peep show there were these two German barmaids beating up Hitler with bratwurst and force-feeding him beer.\u201d\n\nAfter being a staple at punk shows throughout the Bay Area for more than two decades, Burkett moved back to L.A. in 2009, where he helped build a \u201cdungeon\u201d for then-wife Soma Snakeoil in their house. His time in both cities gave him an interesting perspective on their vastly different BDSM scenes.\n\n\u201cL.A. is about doms being really shiny and beautiful in their latex,\u201d he said, while \u201cplay parties I\u2019ve gone to in San Francisco, some people will wear sweats and a leather vest.\u201d\n\nNow Burkett has his eyes set on Las Vegas, where he\u2019s excited to check out the kink scene but more importantly plans to start a museum dedicated to \u201cfive decades of punk rock.\u201d He\u2019s also in talks with producers to turn \u201cHome Street Home,\u201d the musical about teenage prostitutes he co-wrote with Snakeoil, into a television show. The production premiered at San Francisco\u2019s Z Space in 2015 and has been looking for a home since the pandemic cut off its three-month run in L.A. before it was set to begin. On top of that, NOFX is already working on its next album, which the band hopes to release in November.\n\nIn the meantime, the band is ready to return to the stage, gearing up to be one of three headliners for this year\u2019s Punk Rock Bowling. It will be the first time the band has played there since 2018, when Burkett made controversial comments following the fatal shooting in Las Vegas at the Route 91 Harvest Festival the year before.\n\nDon\u2019t expect the same jokes twice, but don\u2019t be surprised to see Burkett wearing a dress onstage.\n\n\u201cBeing in the BDSM world, it\u2019s very akin to being in the punk rock world. We\u2019re not accepted by society,\u201d Burkett said. \u201cWe dressed a certain way, and we did our hair a certain way where we could get beat up any day, especially in the \u201980s. Why do we do that? Because we don\u2019t like our society and we don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re a part of it, and we want to show the world that there\u2019s another way.\u201d\n\n\u201cSingle Album\u201d is available to stream and purchase starting Friday, Feb. 26."}, {"url": "https://www.musicradar.com/news/fat-mike-interview-ill-throw-in-a-cool-bassline-every-now-and-again-but-i-want-to-be-known-for-songwriting-and-how-authentic-we-are", "page_content": "Fat Mike is damn good conversation. He talks a little like he writes music. You don\u2019t know where he is going to go with it but there is sure to be a few surprises en route, a few verbal hand grenades.\n\nThis particular conversation opens with his memories of spending New Year\u2019s with Oasis \u2013 \u201cOasis played Oasis songs for, like, four hours; they really do believe they are that good.\u201d\n\nIt then takes a hand-brake turn into the delicate logistics of sexualised cocaine consumption, and his impulse to share such vignettes in verse (as on Fuck Euphemism).\n\nAfter which, it proceeds right on through to the business of offending the easily offended before terminating at his joy at landing a C#min chord just as he sings the lyrics \u201cWe set sail into the dark and sharpest sea.\u201c A detail, he assures us, no one will notice but it delights him nonetheless.\n\nTaking place just as Fat Mike [Mike Burkett to the authorities] is settling into a newfound sense of equilibrium, it is also a conversation that reflects that distinctly NOFX temperament that sees the Californian punk stalwarts ping-pong between unfiltered humour and the super serious. Lately, Fat Mike has been doing a lot of thinking.\n\n\u201cYou know, I went to rehab a few months ago,\u201d he says. \u201cI learned a lot. It was fun. Being sober, and going through Covid, I have 40 new songs. Over the past few months, every day I spend writing. I just love writing right now, and being clear-headed with nothing else to do? It\u2019s pretty cool. We are already working on a new record.\u201d\n\nBeing sober, and going through Covid, I have 40 new songs... Every day I spend writing. I just love writing right now, and being clear-headed with nothing else to do? It\u2019s pretty cool\n\nAs for surprises, who here took the NOFX bassist/vocalist and punk rock impresario as a perfectionist? Not us. Maybe it is the chaos of the live show \u2013 the chaotic whirl of controversies past, present and future and the shock blue hair that can give you the impression that NOFX are a throw-and-go outfit, happy to let the chips fall where they may.\n\nBut that\u2019s all after the fact. In the studio, Fat Mike obsesses sweats the small stuff 24/7. NOFX\u2019s punk sound is kinetic and iconoclastic, gallows humour abutting wry polemics, yet it is built of tiny details and fine margins.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, I spend so many painstaking hours,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, I am in the studio for every single fucking note that\u2019s played. I will not let anything go, any drum part, any roll, I make sure it is perfect. It drives me crazy.\u201d\n\nNOFX, 2021 [L-R]: Smelly, El Hefe, Eric Melvin and Fat Mike (Image credit: Jonathan Weiner)\n\nThis sensibility is why Single Album is now just that \u2013 a single album, as opposed to the perfect double album that the Californian punk stalwarts had lined up. Songs were ready, but they had to go. \u201cIt\u2019s not competitiveness,\u201d explains Fat Mike. \u201cIt\u2019s just I want NOFX to stay a relevant band, lyrically and musically.\u201d\n\nHe pauses a second at the thought of a it: \u201cPink Floyd were the only band who made a perfect double album.\u201c\n\nI am in the studio for every single fucking note that\u2019s played. I will not let anything go, any drum part, any roll, I make sure it is perfect. It drives me crazy\n\nSingle Album was always going to be called just that \u2013 at least none of the T-shirts had to be reprinted. The songs that were cast aside will be revisited at some point. Those that made the cut find NOFX turning their acerbic observations inwards once more, like when they play around with their most famous song, Linoleum, reworking it as Linewleum with Avenged Sevenfold guesting.\n\nHowever painstakingly it was conceived, Single Album offers another freewheeling trip through Fat Mike\u2019s antic wit and invites you to confront the bleakness head on with tracks such as I Love You More Than I Hate Me and Birmingham, and the perpetual motion of The Big Drag \u2013 a song that walks NOFX\u2019s sound off the cliff. Maybe there is the best place to pick up the conversation\u2026\n\nIt is nice to hear you so enthusiastic about writing, that sobriety is treating you well, because The Big Drag, that kind of sounds like a swan song\u2026\n\n\u201cIt is ominous, and it is a coda song. It should be the last song on an album, but I put it first because it sets the tone. That is one of my favourite songs I have ever written because it is different, and, actually, every measure of the song is a different length, and the drums don\u2019t make sense.\n\n\u201cThe bass never lands on the note \u2013 it\u2019s always roaming. Listening to that song, it makes you just feel insecure about yourself. It keeps you in an awkward position. But it does ground at certain points.\u201d\n\nWhen did you write these songs?\n\n\u201cThis record was written and recorded a year-and-a-half ago. Way before Covid. I was in a depression. I had never been depressed before. But I was very lonely and depressed, going through a divorce. I was drinking a lot, doing a lot of drugs, and all these songs were written during that process, usually at three or four in the morning.\u201d\n\nI was very lonely and depressed, going through a divorce. I was drinking a lot, doing a lot of drugs, and all these songs were written during that process, usually at three or four in the morning\n\nHow difficult is The Big Drag to play?\n\n\u201cOh, yeah\u2026 [Laughs] I used to say we would never play [The] Decline, and then we ended up playing it. But we will never play The Big Drag. No, it\u2019s much too difficult. I was trying to air-drum to it, y\u2019know \u2013 and I have heard it a hundred times \u2013 and I couldn\u2019t do it!\n\n\u201cEverything about it is weird, and having no measure the same time, you have to concentrate so hard. We couldn\u2019t record it all at once! You can\u2019t do it. We\u2019d lay down the guitars, then the vocals, and then we did drums at the end. We had to go as we went.\u201d\n\n(Image credit: Thomas Niedermueller/Redferns)\n\nSo that was a little more studio magic, gaming it out and planning every part?\n\n\u201cYeah, we did a demo of it, which was not a lot different but different, and we just wanted the drums to feel perfect and you couldn\u2019t get it in one take.\u201d\n\nAgain, it had to be perfect\u2026 It is a change of pace, keeps the audience guessing.\n\n\u201cWhen we play shows, people don\u2019t ask for the old songs anymore. They want to hear new albums. We are not a nostalgia act, but that takes a lot of work. Our new album opens up with a six-minute song that I don\u2019t think sounds like any other song that I have heard.\u201d\n\nThe closer we look at your compositions, the more complex they are. Yet, when we just listen to them, they are fun. Enjoying them is easy.\n\n\u201cI write complicated chord progressions because I let the melody dictate where it is going to go. \u2018Oh, I think I\u2019ll try this chord. Does that one work? No. Does this? No\u2026\u2019 And that is how I end up with eight/sixteen chord patterns.\n\n\u201cIt is very much like the Beatles. Not that I have studied the Beatles \u2013 I think I know how to play three songs \u2013 but the Beatles played that song All My Loving, and that sounds like a simple pop song, but it is a sixteen-measure pattern.\n\nWe are not a nostalgia act, but that takes a lot of work. Our new album opens up with a six-minute song that I don\u2019t think sounds like any other song that I have heard\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think that when you hear it. It\u2019s just catchy. So, that\u2019s the paradigm I use, especially the new songs I have been writing. They are getting so weird. I mean, I think they are really catchy but I can\u2019t keep track. I write it, and I have to record it all, and then have to go back and figure it out. I won\u2019t write a melody to a chord progression \u2013 they get written at the same time.\u201d\n\nIt is like you are following a train of thought, chasing the melody to its logical conclusion, and then that\u2019s how you end up with so many different changes\u2026\n\n\u201cRight! Changing chords, putting in a surprising chord is what makes your ear really happy. That\u2019s why the Beatles have stood the test of time, and the Rolling Stones, while their songs might make you feel good, they are not interesting chord progressions. In fact, I made a greatest hits CD mixtape of the Rolling Stones, and there is only five songs on it. But, y\u2019know, that\u2019s me.\u201d\n\nThere is something subversive about having ear-worm melodies and major keys in punk songs about serious subjects, maybe more so than straight-up monochrome anger.\n\n\u201cYeah, and some people say, \u2018What about your song Bob? That\u2019s only two chords.\u2019 We have one song that does that!\u201d\n\nAnd you have a lot of songs. Going back to melodies, that was an aesthetic choice. You could have gone more aggressive. Do you remember when you made that decision?\n\n\u201cI actually know the exact time. \u2018Cos NOFX from \u201983 to \u201988 were just California hardcore. That\u2019s what we listened to. Those were the bands that we knew. Then Bad Religion put out Suffer. We had just played a show with Fugazi at a squat in Amsterdam.\n\nWhen I saw Op Ivy and they could not get through a song, or Social D in \u201982, when they were so drunk they couldn\u2019t stand up, those are the shows you remember\n\n\u201cI was thinking about quitting the band, because the tour was really hard and not successful, a lot of people didn\u2019t like us, and then I heard Suffer. I listened to it four times in a row and it just changed my life. \u2018All right, punk rock is great!\u2019\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking of playing punk rock like the Dickies, Bad Religion and Social Distortion, but melody? We were going to be a melodic hardcore band. I couldn\u2019t sing just yet. It took a few albums of off-key vocals, but that was the moment.\u201d\n\nPunk rock is a forgiving medium. As long as you land the vocal on the right note you\u2019re fine.\n\n\u201cIn punk rock, yeah\u2026 Or Radiohead. That guy can\u2019t sing for shit. But playing live that is where I am not a perfectionist. I really don\u2019t give a shite because it is about how much fun we can have. When I have fun, the crowd has fun.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to have fun if you are trying to be perfect.\n\n\u201cI used to see the Descendants and All. All would play perfectly for an hour-and-a-half, hardly any breaks, every note was perfect. And it was boring. I don\u2019t want to see that. I could listen to the album.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw Op Ivy and they could not get through a song, or Social D in \u201982, when they were so drunk they couldn\u2019t stand up, those are the shows you remember. Those are the experiences, and those are the experiences that only punk rock can provide because you can\u2019t get away with that in other styles of music.\u201d\n\nIs it harder being a punk these days? On one hand, you\u2019ve got a culture that doesn\u2019t like to be offended. Furthermore, it\u2019s a difficult time for grassroots venues.\n\n\u201cWell that is kind of hard for me to say because I like doing outdoor festivals \u2013 because I have one! But also, I have a hard time playing clubs because I inevitably get hit with a fucking glass of beer or something, and I have a little PTSD from being onstage.\n\nSteve Soto would make you want to be a better person. He was an original punk rocker and, really, the nicest guy in punk rock. And he was an influence on me as a bass player. His riffs on that first Adolescents album were great\n\n\u201cBecause I say some things that offend some people and cross-dress \u2013 whatever the reason is \u2013 I am a target. When I am playing, I cannot look at the bass. I have to be looking at the crowd to see what is coming at me. And it doesn\u2019t happen a lot, but you never know, and when you get hit in the face with a bottle it sucks.\u201d\n\nIt is harder to have fun when there\u2019s a missile coming towards you.\n\n\u201cPicture walking down the street every day to your work, and three times in a year you get hit in the face with something! [Laughs] It is PTSD. Yeah, that\u2019s kind of weird about punk rock.\u201d\n\nYou have a tribute to Steve Soto on the record. I wonder if you could speak a little about his influence, and how important he was to you, and to punk.\n\n\u201cWell, Steve Soto is an influence of being such a good guy. He would make you want to be a better person. He was a person who, if you we were in San Francisco, he\u2019d call me and we\u2019d go to dinner. He was such a cool guy, smart, funny, and yeah, he was playing with the Germs.\n\n\u201cHe was in so many bands. He was an original punk rocker and, really, the nicest guy in punk rock. And he was an influence on me as a bass player. Some of his riffs on that first Adolescents album were great.\u201d\n\nYou tell sad stories in comic settings and put it to punk rock. That is not a lot different to stand-up comedy.\n\n\u201cYeah, well, I finally started doing stand-up comedy before Covid, and it is very difficult. But I don\u2019t know if you have listened to Doug Stanhope before, but we are pretty good friends \u2013 I have done his podcast \u2013 and he does a bit in one of his routines where the punchline is, \u2018I played chicken in my sleep. I play chicken in my sleep. I play chicken in my sleep. I play chicken in my sleep\u2026\n\nClassical music didn\u2019t have a fucking chorus! Choruses are marketing\n\n\u201cAnd he says, \u2018This is why I hate rock bands, because they can sing the stupidest line over and over and over again and people listen to it. In comedy, we can\u2019t say the same line four times in a row. It sounds ridiculous. But some asshole rock star will sing Sally parked her Mustang out back four times. Words that mean nothing!\u2019 When I heard that I thought, \u2018Yes!\u2018 That\u2019s why I don\u2019t sing choruses. Because it is fucking lazy and boring.\u201d\n\nRiot Fest 2016: Fat Mike and El Hefe [left] perform in Denver, Colorado. (Image credit: Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images)\n\nBut repetition can be a powerful tool?\n\n\u201cNo! It\u2019s a powerful tool for the fucking label That\u2019s what it is. You put a song on the radio and people hear it once but it sounds like you\u2019ve heard it eight times, so it gets stuck in your head, and that\u2019s marketing, dude. That\u2019s not great songwriting. It is lazy songwriting.\u201d\n\nLinoleum! Our biggest song. Nothing rhymes. It\u2019s just a little sad story about a little sad man\n\nSo you would always resist that urge to repeat a measure?\n\n\u201cClassical music didn\u2019t have a fucking chorus! Choruses are marketing.\u201d\n\nOr jazz?\n\n\u201cYeah, but jazz, they don\u2019t give a shite. The jazz I like, Louis Armstrong, he will do a cool melody but then he will change it a bit, and all those songs were stories. They didn\u2019t stick on a chorus; they told a cool story.\u201d\n\nAnd a cool story always has an element of surprise, and if you have a chorus, that element of surprise is gone.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely! I just can\u2019t do it. Linoleum. Linoleum! Our biggest song. Nothing rhymes. It\u2019s just a little sad story about a little sad man.\u201d\n\nWhat more do you need?\n\n\u201cYeah! And why is it our most popular? If it had a chorus and everything rhymed, I don\u2019t think it would be. If there are three choruses you get sick of the song three times faster. That\u2019s why Linoleum and Bob, some of our biggest songs, have no chorus, and the lyrics don\u2019t rhyme either. It makes you want to hear it more.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something in that. Choruses are a little like your birthday \u2013 you look forward to them but they only disappoints you.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely. And Linewleum? I love doing something that no one has done before, that no one has thought of before \u2013 not just writing a song about retiring your biggest song!\n\n\u201cIt sounds exactly like Linoleum at one point but then the words, the chords and the melody changes at some point and it just fucks with your brain. Everyone who knows Linoleum hears Linewleum and goes, \u2018What the fuck was that!?\u2019 That makes me happy.\u201d\n\nYour fans want that. You\u2019ve trained them, in a sense. You\u2019ve trained their expectations.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an interesting way to put it. I always said, \u2018I am not playing what my fans want. I tell them what they want to hear.\u2019 They want truth. They want truth and they want surprise. They want their brain to go somewhere where it has never gone before.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t music make people think differently about the world? It can! The way to do it is to be specific and not vague. Poetry is great, and sometimes I am poetic, but these days I am just right to the fucking point. Fuck euphemism.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve talked around different aspects of punk rock but authenticity is the designing principle, right?\n\n\u201cThat is what it is all about. When you start to write for other people or write to sell units, then it all goes out the window.\u201d\n\nWe should ask you about the bass guitar. What are you playing these days, the Danelectro?\n\n\u201cYeah, live, I always use that bass. Even though the neck has been broken three times, it is still the same shit. I like playing it. It\u2019s light. If you go to the Danelectro site, I am the only person on there, which is funny.\n\nBob Rock saw us play once and he was like, \u2018What the fuck did you do to that bass?\n\n\u201cBob Rock saw us play once and he was like, \u2018What the fuck did you do to that bass? It sounds amazing.\u2019 \u2018Nothing!\u2019 I bought for $300 used and I didn\u2019t change anything. You can\u2019t even intonate it; it\u2019s just a wooden block at the back. I just play very softly.\u201d\n\nFat Mike and Eric Melvin at the Punk in Drublic Festival 2019. (Image credit: Mariano Regidor/Redferns)\n\nSoftly?\n\n\u201cVery softly. In fact, I use a .60 pick, which bass players should use. A thick pick for bass players just makes you go sharp, and anyone who records bass players knows that. This is really cool, but I don\u2019t know if you know what Jim Dunlop picks are, but I met him at this convention and I said, \u2018You know I play this pick but you can\u2019t silkscreen on it because it is a nylon .60.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah?\u2019 I said, \u2018Can you make me my own pick? Can you make me a mould?\u2019 He was like, \u2018Kid, we have had the same mould since the 1960s! We can\u2019t change it.\u2019 I said, \u2018Why not? I think it would be cool.\u2019 And he was wasted on tequila, and he said \u2018Okay!\u2019 And now I have my own Jim Dunlop picks that say \u2018Fat Mike\u2019 on them.\u201d\n\nWhat about amps?\n\n\u201cWhatever\u2019s not broken. I think I used an Ampeg. I used to use Mesa/Boogie for most of my career but they stopped making the amp that I use.\u201d\n\nBecause you play softly, do you turn it up loud like Steve Harris?\n\n\u201cNo. I know what a bass player should do and most bass players don\u2019t know what they are supposed to do. We are supposed to play light and have a round, even tone because it makes the guitars sound good. I play so light that I don\u2019t go sharp when I record. But both our guitar players play light, because\u2026 Well that\u2019s what they do.\u201d\n\nThey are very underrated players. The tone is always on point.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be known for what kind of shredding leads we can do. I\u2019ll throw in a cool bassline every now and again but I want to be known for songwriting, and how authentic we are, onstage and in our music.\u201d\n\nHow much music theory do you know?\n\n\u201cI never took theory. I learned it all from writing. My mind is pretty weird. I don\u2019t remember lyrics. I don\u2019t know anyone else\u2019s lyrics \u2013 even my favourite bands. I can\u2019t figure out songs. I have a very hard time figuring out other people\u2019s songs. I just write on acoustic guitar to the Voice Memo on my phone and I arrange everything in my head. I\u2019ll wake up in the morning and I arrange songs in my head.\n\n\u201cI learn as I go and I make mistakes. When I was writing Home Street Home, my musical, I wrote this one song, Missing Child, and it was a 40-minute write, and I went to this chord that I had never used before.\n\n\u201cWhen I should it to the orchestra they were like, \u2018What the fuck is that!?\u2019 I didn\u2019t know. It was just a major C moved up a half-step, and it turns into some weird chord that works. The guy who was scoring the musical said, \u2018I have never seen that chord.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what you want. If no one has seen it, no one has played it.\n\n\u201cYeah, and if I had taken music theory, I would never have come up with it.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.last.fm/music/NOFX/+wiki", "page_content": "NOFX is a punk rock band from Los Angeles, California, United States, formed in 1983 and will officially permanently disband in 2023. The original lineup included singer/bassist Fat Mike, drummer Erik Sandin, and guitarist Eric Melvin. Since 1991, the lineup has remained the same, with El Hefe playing guitar and trumpet. They have released 14 full-length studio albums, 15 EPs, 2 live albums, and many 7\" singles. The group has sold over 6 million records worldwide, making them one of the most successful independent acts of all time.\n\nThe band's sound is diverse, utilizing elements of skate punk, hardcore punk, reggae, and other music genres. Their lyrics generally satirize issues such as politics, society, various subcultures, racism, the music industry, and religion, often using a large amount of comedy.\n\nNOFX's first recording was a demo from 1983, produced by The Germs drummer Don Bolles, which did not sell any copies. They released their self-titled debut EP on Mystic Records in 1985, which was later re-released in 1992 as part of the Maximum RocknRoll CD. For a year, Erik Sandin left the band and was replaced by Scott Sellers, then Scott Aldahl. Dave Allen was in the band for about four months, until he died in a car accident. In 1986, the band released So What if We're on Mystic!. Dave Casillas joined the band on second guitar in 1987 and was featured on the EP The P.M.R.C. Can Suck on This!, attacking the PMRC's call for censorship of music. The original cover was an edited S&M photo, but the re-released version was changed to a photo of Eric Melvin.\n\nEric Sandin returned and they recorded Liberal Animation in 1988 (before Dave was replaced by Steve) with Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion. Although the title and some lyrics mocked vegetarianism and animal rights, Fat Mike says that he became a vegetarian after he wrote Liberal Animation. 'If a big enough animal had a chance it would eat you up!' The album was re-released in 1991 on Gurewitz's label Epitaph. Dave then left the band and was replaced by Steve Kidwiller. NOFX had signed to Epitaph by 1989, releasing their second album, titled S&M Airlines. 1990 saw the release of Ribbed. By 1991, Aaron Abeyta (aka El Hefe), joined to round out the group. White Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean was released in 1992, which originally had the title White Trash, Two Kikes, and a Spic. The original title was changed because Eric Melvin's grandmother was upset about the racial epithets.\n\nIt was not until the 1994 release of Punk in Drublic that the band had a commercial breakthrough, with the album going gold. In the same year, pop punk entered the mainstream with the success of The Offspring's Smash and Green Day's Dookie.\n\nIn 1996 they released Heavy Petting Zoo, which wasn't very popular among its fans because it showed a different sound in some tracks. Their 1997 record So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes was faster, with more ska and reggae, and was well received by the public, although its title shocked everybody because it seemed as it was going to be their last album. They soon stated it wasn't true.\n\nIn 1999, the band released The Decline, a fiery and pessimistic social commentary. Having a duration of 18 minutes and 23 seconds, it is nearly the longest punk song to date, second only to \"Yes Sir, I Will\" by Crass, which spans more than 22 minutes.\n\nThe coming of a new century marked the end of NOFX in Epitaph Records. In 2000 they released Pump Up the Valuum, which in many people's opinion is a good record but still is missing something.\n\nIn 2003, NOFX released War on Errorism, and launched their anti-George W. Bush campaign. Fat Mike organized the website Punkvoter.com, compiled two chart-topping Rock Against Bush compilations, and kicked off a Rock Against Bush United States tour. The band has released many EPs (i.e. Fuck the Kids, The Longest Line) on Fat Mike's own label Fat Wreck Chords. In February 2005, they launched the NOFX 7\" of the Month Club, a subscription-based service which saw the release of one new EP almost monthly, from February 2005 to March 2006 (a total of 12 releases). The cover art for these EPs were chosen from fan-submitted entries. The first 3000 subscribers to the club received all of their records on colored vinyl. Fat Wreck Chords later released full sets of the EPs.\n\nOn March 14, 2006, an EP entitled Never Trust a Hippy was released. The EP was followed on April 18 by the album Wolves in Wolves' Clothing. On September 12, 2006, the video game EA Sports NHL07 was released, featuring the title track of the latter album on its soundtrack.\n\nThe band recorded three nights of shows in San Francisco, California for the live album, They've Actually Gotten Worse Live! that was released on November 20, 2007.\n\nNOFX aired in 2008 a reality show on Fuse TV called NOFX: Backstage Passport, chronicling their recent worldwide tour full of mishaps and fun stuff.\n\nNOFX released their eleventh full length, Coaster, on April 28, 2009.\n\nNOFX released their twelfth full length, Self/Entitled, on September 11th, 2012.\n\nOfficial site: http://nofxofficialwebsite.com"}, {"url": "https://music.douban.com/musician/102632/", "page_content": "\u7b80\u4ecb \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7

Over their 33-year career, NOFX has released 12 studio albums and 21 EPs, as well as five live albums and four compilations. The band has sold over 7 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling independent artists of all time. Fat Mike: The Bassist and Lead Vocalist for NOFX\n\nFat Mike: The Bassist and Lead Vocalist for NOFX\n\nEarly life\n\nMichael John Burkett, also known as Fat Mike, is an American musician, punk rock producer, and lead vocalist. He grew up in El Cerrito with his friends Eric Melvin and Erik Sandin. They all attended John F. Kennedy Middle School together. In 1980 they discovered skateboarding while living in a suburb of San Francisco called El Cerrito. In 1981 at the age of 14, he was hit by a car while skateboarding on the school lawn during lunchtime and shattered his right arm. This injury led him to start playing bass guitar in place of taking drum lessons which he couldn\u2019t afford on his own due to his parents\u2019 divorce which made it hard to come up with money for himself or things he wanted outside of basic needs. Fat Mike: The Bassist and Lead Vocalist for NOFX\n\nCareer\n\nGrowing up in the 1960s in the suburban town of Agoura Hills, California, Michael John Burkett (aka Fat Mike) was exposed to a vast number of influences. His father brought home albums from artists such as Bob Dylan, Talking Heads, Woody Guthrie, Black Sabbath, Aerosmith and Kiss. As a result, these all made an impact on him. This is evident throughout his career as he has often mentioned them as bands that have influenced him. He joined the punk rock band NOFX in 1983 at age sixteen. They recorded their first demo together Paranoid later that year, followed by their debut EP S&M Airlines which was released on January 1st 1985.\n\nIn 1994 they released Punk In Drublic which became their first album to chart on Billboard Top 200 where it peaked at #67.\n\nPersonal life\n\nMichael John Burkett, better known as Fat Mike, is an American musician and producer. He is the bassist and lead vocalist for the punk rock band NOFX, but Fat Mike had originally not been in a band until high school when he joined together with Eric Melvin and El Hefe to form Too Much Noise. They eventually changed their name to No Use For A Name as they found out there was another Too Much Noise. Together they released three albums before Eric left the band and got replaced by Pete Parada. Some time later Jon Totleben decided to leave the band as well, but this time he was replaced by Dave Nassie who joined them on their 1999 album Good Night, Thank You.\n\nAwards\n\nIn late 1982, Burkett met Eric Melvin at a Patti Smith concert in San Francisco. He decided to start a punk rock band with Melvin. After attempts at naming the band the Ugly Sacks and the Mr. T Experience, they settled on calling themselves NOFX. Their first record was an EP entitled S&M Airlines which was released on Mystic Records in 1990. In 1994, the release of Punk in Drublic followed two years later, and after its success, NOFX signed to Epitaph Records who gave them more creative control over their work. All of their subsequent albums were released by Epitaph.\n\nFat Mike: The Bassist and Lead Vocalist for NOFX\n\nReferences\n\nMichael John Burkett, known professionally as Fat Mike, is an American musician and producer.

Check out the new track below.\n\nSPIN: The inspiration behind \u201cFuck Euphemism\u201d is obviously very clear, but what do you want people to take away from this song about you being a crossdressing kinkster?\n\nFat Mike: I think it\u2019s a very important song for the conversation with the trans community and the LBGT community. I consider myself queer and a part of it, so I can sing a song like this. I live a BDSM lifestyle and I\u2019m a crossdresser, so it did bother me when people were calling me a cis male. I like the whole thing of defining yourself using your own terms, because I\u2019m a punk rocker first, and then a submissive crossdressing male. The transgender community and the gay community are taking a stance on how we want to be known, and I\u2019m going to be known as a certain way.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut I think the most important thing in this song is that it doesn\u2019t need to be that way, because really you\u2019re just a person. In part of the song, I say \u201cCall me \u2018per\u2019 for the night,\u201d where \u201cper\u201d is short for person. I think that is really the term that people should be embracing, like \u201cI was with per last night\u201d or \u201cI love per\u201d because it doesn\u2019t give away anything. It\u2019s singular, and isn\u2019t that what people want to be known as, \u2014 as a person? They don\u2019t want to be labeled. It\u2019s a term that Doris Lessing came up within a book called The Good Terrorist, which I read in college in the \u201880s. Doris Lessing is a feminist writer, and she had it where, in the future, society called everyone \u201cper\u201d for person. It just makes sense to me.\n\nThere\u2019s also a line in the song about how I did a line off of Scarlett\u2019s $100,000 cunt, and I think I came out of the closet even more with that because I was too scared to wear women\u2019s clothes until I was 45 \u2014 9 years ago. I was still a closeted crossdresser, and I managed to come out a little more. That line for me is really huge because this domme I was seeing, Scarlett Sin, I didn\u2019t know she was trans when I was seeing her. With a domme, there\u2019s no sex going on, so you don\u2019t really see what\u2019s what she\u2019s got under the hood. After a few sessions with her, I asked if she was trans and she said \u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d I said \u201cNo, I actually didn\u2019t. I never thought about it before. You still got a wiener?\u201d She said, \u201cNo, I took the whole journey, and I got a really good one.\u201d\n\nShe was a marine, so the Armed Forces paid for her operation because she got shot in the back in Bosnia. I\u2019d never seen one before, so I asked if I could check it out, and I ended up doing a line off of it. But where you normally would do a line \u2014 which is right above the clitoral hood, because it\u2019s a little bump stop and it won\u2019t fall down \u2014 she doesn\u2019t have one. Her vag is smooth like a Porsche hood or a Volkswagen hood, so if you put the line down there, it just slides right down. But I still wanted to because that\u2019s what you do. Some people would think it\u2019s TMI to put that out in a song. But for me, I just can\u2019t stop singing about my life. Truth is stranger than fiction, right?\n\nAbsolutely. The new album coming out seems a lot darker and a lot more serious than some of the more lighthearted material the band has done in the past. What inspired that change?\n\nWell ever since we started, we\u2019ve written pretty serious songs and sociopolitical songs. It\u2019s just that we\u2019re funny on stage, so everyone kind of pigeonholes us as a fun joke band. But our lyrics are fucking serious. Like \u201cLiza and Louise\u201d is a song about lesbians that a domme I used to see once told me was the song that let her come out as a lesbian when she heard it when she was 16. It gave her the confidence to come out as gay, and I was so fucking stoked about that. That\u2019s how I always felt my songs were. They are sociopolitical songs that tell stories that make people feel like they\u2019re not alone in this world.\n\nThis album is darker because it\u2019s the first album I\u2019ve ever written and recorded it while I was in depression. I never had depression until a couple of years ago, and this is what happens when you write lyrics at four in the morning when you\u2019re on vodka and coke. You face your demons and you sing about personal things. What\u2019s cool about this record is that I wasn\u2019t sure about it when I finished it. All I knew was that I loved a few of the songs, but I didn\u2019t know how people would respond to the album. So far, people are treating it very well, which just makes me so happy because I wasn\u2019t sure since I wrote and recorded it while using drugs and booze the entire time.\n\nI\u2019m sure part of the nervousness must come from going to rehab and getting sober pretty much right after, right? What was that like?\n\nI used to always say that rehab wasn\u2019t for me. I went to detox once, but that was only for six days. This time, the band wanted me to go to rehab, which really pissed me off because at the time I was riding my bike five days a week, I was in good shape, and I wasn\u2019t using very much except for like two or three days a week \u2014 which I felt pretty good about. They wanted me to go to rehab because they thought I was being unreasonable, so that pissed me off so much that I said \u201cFuck you guys\u201d and ended up going on a weeklong bender. That ended with me throwing up two liters of blood and shitting blood at Avenged Sevenfold\u2019s house, which is when my ex-wife said I needed to go to rehab.\n\nStrangely enough, once I got out of the hospital and went to rehab, the doctor and the therapist told me I didn\u2019t throw up blood from drinking or drugs, but actually a bacteria that I have, that is a serious stomach disorder. It\u2019s actually chlamydia of the stomach. Don\u2019t ask me how I got it. So it turned out that what caused me to puke blood and made me think I was dying actually wasn\u2019t because of vodka and blow. The doctor at rehab said my liver and heart were good, but the problem was that I didn\u2019t know how to deal with issues like loneliness or divorce \u2014 or when my musical was finally supposed to open in July in L.A. and then got shut down like everything else. That\u2019s when I\u2019d start drinking and doing drugs more than I normally do, so going to rehab was awesome because I learned how to deal with issues and change my perspective on certain things instead of just going right to the bottle.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve been sober for like three months, and I\u2019m super happy. I\u2019ve written almost 40 songs in three months. I\u2019m just going in all kinds of different directions because well, shit, when you wake up at 8 am every day and go to sleep at 11, there\u2019s a lot of time when you\u2019re not trying to fucking do drugs or something. I spend an hour or two writing every day, and it\u2019s just awesome. Stephen King said he writes every day, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing since I went to sober camp.\n\nNOFX\n\nCredit: Jonathan Weiner\n\nNow that The Hepatitis Bathtub and Other Stories has been out for almost five years, how\u2019s it feel for all of these stories you guys had been holding on to for so long to be out in the open?\n\nIt\u2019s great. It was amazing seeing 800 five-star reviews on Amazon and having the writer of The Dirt email us to say how much he loved our book. It\u2019s great when a plan works out, because I told the band that if we\u2019re going to do this book, we have to be absolutely honest about everything. I love that it\u2019s really Smelly\u2019s \u2014 our drummer\u2019s \u2014 book. I love when other people in my band get the shine. Because they\u2019re all great people and they\u2019re all talented and have big hearts, but I do most of the press because I write the songs. I love how Smelly got so much spotlight for the book, and I love that people look at NOFX differently after reading that book. They don\u2019t think of us like a mid-90s pop-punk band. I actually hate when people call us pop-punk. We are a melodic hardcore band.\n\nYou said you\u2019ve already written 40 songs in the last few months, so should people expect another NOFX album this year after Single Album?\n\nWe already started recording, so yeah, I want to put out two records this year. We\u2019re planning festivals in September and October in both Europe and the US, and then Australia in December. The dates keep getting pushed back, but things are looking up and I think things in Europe are going to happen by September.\n\nBut honestly, I\u2019ve really enjoyed this break. Based on what I learned in sober camp, my perspective is that I\u2019m taking this time to write and record, and I\u2019m not bummed out. I just spent a week with my daughter, and it\u2019s just a good time to reset your life with everything slowed down. I\u2019m kind of cherishing all the stuff I\u2019m getting done in my life right now.\n\nTo see our running list of the top 100 greatest guitarists of all time, click here."}, {"url": "https://www.grunge.com/287567/the-untold-truth-of-nofx/", "page_content": "NOFX formed in 1983, and five years later they had an incredible opportunity when Brett Gurewitz, lead songwriter and guitarist for legendary punk band Bad Religion (and founder of music label Epitaph Records), offered to produce an album for them. As noted in their book, NOFX: The Hepatitis Bathtub and Other Stories, the band scraped up $675 to record the album, and Gurewitz offered to release it on Epitaph. But the band wanted to launch their own label.\n\nPlus, NOFX themselves admit the album is awful. Lead singer Fat Mike considers the band's second album, 1989's S&M Airlines, to be their real first album and notes that NOFX was \"sounding, performing and behaving like sh*t\" prior to that. In fact, he says that the band had to rebuild their reputation from scratch with their second album because they had such a reputation for being terrible.\n\nIt's not just self-deprecation, either. Ron DePasquale at Allmusic.com says of the album, \"the sound is very raw and loose; the lyrics are slightly humorous at best and sophomoric at worst\" and speculates that the band just wasn't ready for the opportunity. After trying to sell the album on their own and failing miserably, NOFX sold the album to Epitaph after all, but it remains an album for dedicated fans only."}]}
