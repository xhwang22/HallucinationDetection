{"John Russell died on 28 October 1857.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Russell-1st-Earl-Russell", "page_content": "John Russell, 1st Earl Russell, also called (until 1861) Lord John Russell, (born Aug. 18, 1792, London, Eng.\u2014died May 28, 1878, Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park, Surrey), prime minister of Great Britain (1846\u201352, 1865\u201366), an aristocratic liberal and leader of the fight for passage of the Reform Bill of 1832.\n\nRussell was the third son of John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford. (As the younger son of a peer, he was known for most of his life as Lord John Russell; he himself was created earl in 1861.) He thus came of a family that had long demonstrated its public spirit. The depth of his liberalism probably owed much to an untypical education. Poor health forbade the rigours of an English public school, and later, his father, who was critical of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, sent him to the University of Edinburgh, where he drank deeply of Scottish philosophy.\n\nIn 1813 he became a member of Parliament and four years later made his first important speech\u2014characteristically, an attack on the government\u2019s suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. In December 1819 Russell took up the cause of parliamentary reform, making it in the early 1820s not only his own cause but also that of the Whig Party. When the Whigs came to power in 1830, he joined the small ministerial committee that was to draft a reform bill, and on March 31, 1831, he presented it to the House of Commons. Overnight, he had won a national reputation.\n\nIn the 1830s and \u201940s, Russell remained the chief promoter of liberal reform in the Whig Party\u2014although never again, perhaps, was this role so glorious as in the protracted but successful conflict over the passing of the first Reform Bill. As paymaster general under Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, during roughly the first half of the 1830s, Russell championed the cause of religious freedom for both English Dissenters and Irish Roman Catholics. Indeed, he pursued these aims so zealously that, in seeking to divert some of the wealth of the established Church of Ireland (which was Protestant) to the Roman Catholics (who formed the bulk of the population), he frightened such leading Whigs as Lord Stanley (later Earl of Derby) out of the party. In the second half of the 1830s, as home secretary under Lord Melbourne, Russell, among other things, democratized the government of large towns (with the exception of London). He also reduced the number of criminal offenses liable to capital punishment and began the system of state inspection and support of public education.\n\nEven out of office from 1841 to 1846, when he stood in opposition to Sir Robert Peel, Russell left his mark. In 1845, in advance of his party, he came out in favour of total free trade, a crucial step in forcing Peel to follow him. As a result Peel split his party, the Whigs came to power, and Russell became prime minister.\n\nThis administration (1846\u201352) demonstrated that, although Russell\u2019s penchant for advanced ideas was as strong as ever, his ability to implement them was now seriously reduced. He was able to establish the 10-hour day in factory labour (1847) and to found a national board of public health (1848). But, largely because of party disunity and weak leadership, he was unable to end the civil disabilities of the Jews, extend the franchise to the workers in the cities, or guarantee security of tenure to the Irish farmers.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Party disunity continued and brought down his second administration (1865\u201366) when he made his last attempt to extend the franchise. But more significant, in the 1850s the national temper had changed. An age of reform had given way to a mood of self-complacency, even of belligerence. This was already evident in the Ecclesiastical Titles Act of 1851, which Russell\u2019s government had passed and which in effect was England\u2019s defiance of the papacy.\n\nThis mood deepened, transformed, on the one hand, into an appetite for foreign conquest and, on the other, into boredom with social and political reform. In such an atmosphere Russell was inevitably overshadowed by the forceful and popular Lord Palmerston, who seized the forefront of the national stage in the Crimean War (1854\u201356). Indeed, for four years, from 1855 to 1859, Russell retired from public life and devoted more and more of his time to literature. Private life had always beckoned to him, as had the life of a litterateur. Among the English prime ministers, few wrote so copiously\u2014biography, history, poetry\u2014as Russell. He accepted an earldom in 1861, and he died at Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park, in 1878."}, {"url": "https://www.wikitree.com/genealogy/RUSSELL", "page_content": "RUSSELL Genealogy\n\nWikiTree is a community of genealogists growing an increasingly-accurate collaborative family tree that's 100% free for everyone forever.

He was born on 8 August 1792, the third son of the sixth Duke of Bedford. He was educated at Westminster School and the University of Edinburgh.\n\nWhen he was fully grown, Russell stood only 5' 4\u00be\" tall and weighed about 8 stones (112 lbs; 50 kg): his diminutive size was a constant source of surprise to others. In the 1830s, the witty Sydney Smith claimed tongue-in-cheek, \u201cBefore this Reform agitation commenced Lord John was over six feet high. But, engaged in looking after your interests, fighting the peers, the landlords, and the rest of your natural enemies, he has been so constantly kept in hot water that he is boiled down to the proportions in which you now behold him.\u201d\n\nRussell, who entered Parliament in 1813 as the MP for Tavistock, during the 1820s persistently advocated both extending the franchise and granting political equality to Roman Catholics. His support of parliamentary reform won the Whigs a great deal of support in the 1830 General Election although the Duke of Wellington formed the ministry which lasted only until November 1830.\n\nThree editorial cartoons caricaturing Russell\u2019s small stature from Punch. Click on images for captions and commentary.\n\nRussell served as Paymaster General in Earl Grey's Whig ministry of 1830-1834 and was one of the four members of the government responsible for drafting the Reform Bill (1832), which doubled the British electorate. Russell proposed the legislation to parliament, and he was responsible for steering it through the House of Commons. On the third attempt to push the legislation through parliament, Russell was the only man who knew of the Bill's contents: he was still trying to dry the ink on the proposals when he entered the House of Commons. In November 1834 he resigned along with the Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne, and sat on the Opposition Front Bench during Peel's first ministry.\n\nWoburn Abbey, country seat of the Dukes of Bedford.\n\nFollowing Peel's downfall, thanks to the Lichfield House Compact, Russell rejoined Melbourne's government and served as Home Secretary from 1835 to 1839 and then as Secretary for War and the Colonies from 1839 to 1841. He was also Leader of the House of Commons during this time. In the General Election of 1841, which the Conservatives won, Russell was returned as MP for the City of London, which he represented until he was elevated to the House of Lords in 1861.\n\nThree editorial cartoons caricaturing Russell\u2019s small stature from Fun.

During this first premiership (1846-1852), he helped pass legislation limiting working hours in factories in the 1847 Factory Act and was responsible for passing the Public Health Act of 1848. This ministry also ended restrictions on colonial trade by repealing the Navigation Acts in 1849.\n\nHis government's efforts to prevent widespread starvation as a result of the Irish famine of 1846-1847 were ineffective. Russell's alternate support for and dissent from Aberdeen's government policies during the Crimean War (1854-46) caused him to lose the leadership of the Liberal party to Viscount Palmerston.\n\nAs foreign secretary (1859-1865) under Palmerston, he supported Italian Unification and antagonised the United States during the American Civil War by actions that seemed to favour the Confederacy. He retired from political office after briefly heading a second ministry in 1865-1866 but continued to sit in the House of Lords where he spoke on a variety of issues until he died on 28 May 1878.\n\nRelated Material & Political cartoons featuring Russell\n\nRecommended reading\n\nPrest, J.

The case was known as Dred Scott v. Sandford. It further divided the country and added to the forces that created the Civil War. It wasn't overturned until the 14th Amendment became law in 1868.\n\nIn 1873, at the age of 16 years old, John was alive when on February 12th, The Coinage Act of 1873 was signed by President Ulysses S. Grant. It went into effect on April 1st and ended the use of gold and silver in the U.S. for currency - placing the country on the gold standard. The Act wasn't popular with everyone.\n\nIn 1909, by the time he was 52 years old, the U.S. penny was changed to the Abraham Lincoln design. The Lincoln penny was so popular that it soon had to be rationed and it sold on the secondary market for a quarter. Abraham Lincoln was the first historical figure to be on a U.S. coin - which was released to commemorate his 100th birthday. This penny was also the first U.S. cent to include the words \"In God We Trust.\".\n\nIn 1910, by the time he was 53 years old, the Boy Scouts of America was incorporated. U.S. publisher W.D. Boyce was visiting England when he became lost in the London fog. An unknown Boy Scout helped him find his way out, declining a tip (he said that he was a Boy Scout and was doing his good deed for the day). Boyce was so impressed that he incorporated the Boy Scouts of America when he returned home. Its purpose was \"to teach boys patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kindred values.\"\n\nIn 1931, in the year of John Morrison Russell's passing, in March, \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner\u201d officially became the national anthem by congressional resolution. Other songs had previously been used - among them, \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\", \"God Bless America\", and \"America the Beautiful\". There was fierce debate about making \"The Star Spangled Banner\" the national anthem - Southerners and veterans organizations supported it, pacifists and educators opposed it."}, {"url": "https://www.loc.gov/item/n83202815/john-russell-young-1840-1899/", "page_content": "7th Librarian of Congress 1897-1899\n\nJournalist John Russell Young, the seventh Librarian of Congress, did not serve long in the office: from his confirmation by the Senate on July 1, 1897 until his death on January 17, 1899. In this short period, he conscientiously undertook the formidable tasks of overseeing the move of the Library from the U.S. Capitol Building into its own building and of expanding and reorganizing the institution as it took on new responsibilities and faced new expectations.\n\nYoung was born on Nov. 20, 1840, in County Tyrone, Ireland, the son of George and Eliza Rankin Young. Brought to the United States when he was less than a year old, he began his formal schooling in Philadelphia, then became a ward of an uncle in New Orleans, where he continued his public schooling. He returned to Philadelphia at age 15, apprenticed himself to another relative who was a printer, and it was then, as his biographer John C. Broderick relates, that his \"real education\" began. In August 1857, he secured a position as copyboy on the Philadelphia Press, beginning a long and fruitful association with its editor John W. Forney, who founded the Washington Chronicle in 1861. Through Forney, who also served as Clerk of the House of Representatives at various periods between 1851 and 1868, Young learned about politics and developed his strong pro-Union and antislavery sentiments.\n\nFollowing the Civil War, at the age of 25, Young became the managing editor of Horace Greeley\u2019s New York Tribune. Young resigned from the Tribune in 1869, in part because he differed with Greeley about the 1868 Republican nominee: Young favored U.S. Grant, Greeley promoted Salmon P. Chase.\n\nThroughout much of the 1870s, Young served as the New York Herald\u2019s European representative. After Grant left office, he urged Young to accompany him on a well-publicized trip around the world. Young agreed, and the result was the two-volume compilation, Around the World with General Grant (1879), an expansion of Young\u2019s dispatches to the Herald. Grant became Young\u2019s advocate, and recommended to President James Garfield in 1881 that Young become American\u2019s minister to Japan. Instead, it was President Chester A. Arthur who made Young an ambassador, appointing him as minister to China in 1882, a post in which Young served with distinction until 1885.\n\nYoung decided to return to his career in journalism and business in Philadelphia. There he was active in the Union League, which he had helped found in 1862, edited the city\u2019s Memorial History, and continued to take part in Republican party politics. He was president of the Union League for two years in the 1890s, during which time he arranged for a meeting of Confederate and Union military heroes at Gettysburg in April 1893.\n\nYoung\u2019s strong Republican connections, buttressed by his administrative capabilities, soon brought him the job of Librarian of Congress. He and president-elect William McKinley became close after McKinley\u2019s election in 1896, and while others felt that Young\u2019s appointment to another diplomatic post might be best, it was the job of Librarian of Congress that loomed. The Joint Committee on the Library\u2019s late 1896 hearings about the \"condition\" of the Library on the eve of its move into its new building made it clear that a new Librarian of Congress was needed to replace the 71-year old Ainsworth Rand Spofford. McKinley nominated Young on June 30, and he was confirmed by the Senate on the same day. The Washington Evening Star reported \"a thorough and amicable understanding\" between Young and Spofford, who indeed became Chief Assistant Librarian.\n\nYoung\u2019s business and political skills served him well during his brief term as Librarian of Congress. So did his broader intellectual interests and experience as a diplomat. He used his diplomatic ties, for example, to enlarge the Library\u2019s collections. In February 1898, he sent a letter to U.S. diplomatic and consular representatives throughout the world, asking them to send \"to the national library\" newspapers, journals, pamphlets, manuscripts, broadsides, \"documents illustrative of the history of those various nationalities now coming to our shores to blend into our national life,\" and other categories of research materials, broadly summarized as \"whatever, in a word, would add to the sum of human knowledge.\" By the end of 1898, books and other materials had been obtained from eleven legations and seven consulates.\n\nThe new Librarian skillfully guided the institution\u2019s administrative reorganization and expansion. He made many important professional appointments. While himself a political appointee, Young was nonpartisan in his selections and successfully distanced the Library from world of partisan politics. His appointees included Thorvald Solberg, the first register of copyrights, and catalogers J.C.M. Hanson and Charles Martel, who began reclassifying the collections after nearly a century of reliance on the classification scheme Thomas Jefferson provided to the Library along with his books.\n\nMany of Young\u2019s administrative innovations were apt and farsighted. Thorough a program of daily readings in a special \"pavilion for the blind,\" in November of 1897, Young inaugurated what today is one of the Library\u2019s best known national activities: library service for the blind and physically handicapped. He contemplated but did not establish a separate children\u2019s department. In his 1897 Annual Report he advocated the transfer of historical manuscripts from the Department of State to the Library and decried the use of cheap, nondurable paper by publishers, warning that many of the works coming into the Library \"threaten in a few years to crumble into a waste heap, with no value as record.\"\n\nYoung also was sensitive to Spofford\u2019s struggles on behalf of the national library prior to the Library of Congress\u2019s occupancy of its own separate building. Moreover, he shared Spofford\u2019s vision of the Library\u2019s future, commenting in his diary on June 12, 1898: \"I am trying to build the library far into the future, to make it a true library of research.\"\n\nLibrarian Young\u2019s Annual Report for 1898 demonstrates the broad range of his interests and his vision for the Library of Congress. Its appendices include reports on special collections, e.g. the newly acquired Gardiner Greene Hubbard collection of engravings and art books, the \"Jefferson Library,\" and the \"Chinese collection;\" an historical report on the \"close relations\" between the Library and the Smithsonian Institution; a list of the books received through the diplomatic and consular service; and his report on \"the durability of paper.\" It ends with what became Young\u2019s valedictory statement about the institution which he did so much to shape during his brief librarianship: \"With the considerate care of Congress and a due appreciation of what has been done and what may so readily be done by the American people, there is no reason why the Library of Congress should not rival those noble establishments of the Old World, whose treasures are a people\u2019s pride and whose growth is the highest achievement of modern civilization.\"\n\nJohn Russell Young suffered a severe fall on Christmas Eve, 1898, and never fully recovered. He died on January 17, 1899, after only nineteen months in office.\n\nYoung was married three times. His first two marriages were marked by sadness. He married Rose Fitzpatrick in 1864, but she was frequently ill until her death in 1881 and all three children of the marriage died in childhood. He remarried in 1882, but second wife Julia died in Paris in October 1883, two months after giving birth to their son, who was placed in the care of his mother\u2019s family, since Young was in Peking as minister to China. Young and his third wife Mary, whom he married in 1890, were the parents of Gordon Russell Young, who was born in 1891 and became a prominent military engineer and a commissioner of the District of Columbia.

But in early life he turned his attention to politics. He was a parliamentary reformer and a member of the Society of Friends of the People, to which Sheridan and Erskine, Rogers and Whitbread, Mackintosh and Grey belonged. Under the name of Lord John Russell he in 1788 entered the House of Commons as one of the members for Tavistock, in succession to Richard Rigby [q. v.] He sat for this constituency till 2 March 1802, when, on the death of his elder brother, Francis Russell, fifth duke [q. v.], he succeeded \u200bto the dukedom. On 12 Feb. 1806 he was created a privy councillor, and took office as lord-lieutenant of Ireland in the administration of \u2018all the talents.\u2019 He resigned with his colleagues on 19 April 1807. Thenceforth he took little part in political life, chiefly residing at Woburn, and devoting himself to the improvement of his property in Bedfordshire, Devonshire, and London. In 1830 he rebuilt Covent Garden market at a cost of 40,000l. Like his brother, he interested himself in agriculture, and continued for some years the famous sheep-shearings at Woburn. In 1811 G. Garrard, A.R.A., painted a well-known picture of the ceremony, with portraits of the duke and the chief agriculturists of the day; an engraving of the picture was very popular. He was long president of the Smithfield Club, and became in 1838 a governor of the newly founded Agricultural Society, and one of the first vice-presidents. From 1813 to 1815 he was in Italy, and formed a notable collection of statuary, paintings, and other works of art, which found a home at Woburn, and are described in the \u2018Woburn Abbey Marbles\u2019 (1822, fol.). He helped to effect the drainage operations of the \u2018Bedford Level\u2019\u2014works which were directed by Telford and the Rennies. The duke was also an enthusiastic naturalist. He made valuable experiments upon the nutritive qualities of grasses, and under his direction George Sinclair (1786\u20131834) [q. v.] published in 1816 his \u2018Hortus Gramineus Woburnensis.\u2019 Subsequently the duke turned his attention to the cultivation at Woburn of heaths, willows, pines, and shrubs, and catalogues of specimens planted at Woburn were published under his direction as \u2018Hortus Eric\u00e6us Woburnensis\u2019 (1825), \u2018Salictum Woburnense\u2019 (1829), \u2018Pinetum Woburnense\u2019 (1839), and \u2018Hortus Woburnensis,\u2019 describing six thousand ornamental plants and shrubs (see Ernest Clarke's Agriculture and the House of Russell). He was created K.G. on 25 Nov. 1830. He died at the Doune of Rothie-Murchus, Perthshire, on 20 Oct. 1839, and was buried at Chenies on 14 Nov. His portrait was painted by Sir Thomas Lawrence and by Sir George Hayter. He was twice married: first, on 25 March 1786, to Georgiana Elizabeth, second daughter of George Byng, fourth viscount Torrington; she died on 11 Oct. 1801, leaving three sons\u2014Francis, seventh duke; George William [q. v.]; and Lord John, the statesman. He married, secondly, on 23 June 1803, Georgiana (d. 1853), fifth daughter of Alexander Gordon, fourth duke of Gordon; by her he had seven sons and three daughters.\n\nLord John\u2014a seven months' child\u2014inherited his mother's delicacy of constitution. He was her favourite child, and always cherished the love for her which absorbed him in youth (SPENCER WALPOLE, i. 4). He was first sent to what he termed \u2018a very bad private school,\u2019 kept at Sunbury by Dr. Moore. On his birthday in 1803 he began to write a diary. In September 1803 he was sent to Westminster School, and was fag to Lord Tavistock, his eldest brother, who reproached himself in after life for having been a hard taskmaster, and thought this \u2018the greatest sin he had to answer for.\u2019 Being a delicate boy and unable to endure the rough fare and treatment, Lord John was taken from school in 1804. His education was continued under a tutor, Dr. Cartwright, at Woburn Abbey. He was diligent at his lessons, and he amused himself by writing verses and a farce called \u2018Perseverance, or All in All.\u2019 He performed in amateur theatricals; he wrote prologues to plays and spoke them, and often visited the theatres. Between 1805 and 1808 he was the pupil of Mr. Smith, vicar of Woodnesborough, near Sandwich. His health was not robust. Among the many visits which he never forgot was one to Fox and his wife in June 1806, when Fox was secretary for foreign affairs. He was barely fourteen when he wrote in his \u2018Diary\u2019: \u2018What a pity that he who steals a penny loaf should be hung, whilst he who steals thousands of the public money should be acquitted!\u2019 (Life, i. 22). In the same year Lord John went to Ireland to stay at Dublin Castle with his father, who was lord-lieutenant. The following year his father took him on a trip through Scotland, and there he made the acquaintance of Walter Scott, whom he terms in his \u2018Diary\u2019 \u2018the minstrel of the nineteenth century,\u2019 and who acted as his guide to the ruined abbey at Melrose. A quarter of a century afterwards Scott halted in London on his return from Italy to Abbotsford; his hours were numbered; it was erroneously supposed that pecuniary distress had aggravated his illness, and Lord John Russell, who was then in the government, sent a message delicately offering an advance from the treasury of any sum that might be required for Scott's relief.\n\nLord and Lady Holland took Lord John with them when they journeyed to Portugal in 1808. In their company he visited Lisbon, Seville, and Cadiz, and returned home in the summer of 1809. Thereupon Russell was sent by his father to the university of Edinburgh. He would have preferred Cambridge. He studied at Edinburgh from the autumn of 1809 till the summer of 1812, being lodged in the house of Professor John Playfair [q. v.], \u200bto whose counsel he expressed deep indebtedness. In addition to attending lectures in the university, he was an active member of the Speculative Society, reading essays before it and taking part in discussions, thereby training himself for a political career. He revisited the Peninsula in 1810, when he was the guest of his brother, Lord George William, at Isla de Leon. He also acquired experience as captain in the Bedfordshire militia, to which he was appointed in 1813, and his military training proved as serviceable to him as it was to Gibbon. At the same time he developed a marked taste for literature. George Ticknor, who met him in 1819, wrote: \u2018Lord John is a young man of a good deal of literary knowledge and taste, from whose acquaintance I have had much pleasure\u2019 (Life, Letters, and Journals, i. 270).\n\nIn 1812 Russell again visited the continent; he saw Wellington at Burgos and Cadiz, and in 1813 at his headquarters in the Pyrenees. Being at Florence in 1814, he found an opportunity of crossing to Elba, where he had an interview with Bonaparte, and inferred that he did not despair of returning to power (see Introduction to Speeches, i. 7\u201312).\n\nWhile abroad in July 1813, being still a month under age, he was elected by his father's directions member of parliament for the family borough of Tavistock. In accordance with the traditions of his family, he was returned in the whig interest. His maiden speech was delivered on 12 May 1814 in support of an address to the prince regent against forcing Norway to unite with Sweden, and he voted in the small minority which favoured the Norwegians. His remarks were not reported. He spoke for the second time on 14 July, when he opposed the Alien Act Repeal Bill. On 26 Feb. 1817 Lord John made his first notable speech in parliament in opposing the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. Shortly afterwards, owing to weak health, he applied for the Chiltern Hundreds, his place being filled by Lord Robert Spencer, who was elected on 12 March. He was re-elected for Tavistock on 18 June 1818, and on 14 Dec. 1819 he delivered the first of his many speeches on parliamentary reform. Yet, in his earliest as in his latest years, literature had as many attractions for him as politics. He prepared at this period, among other works, biographies of members of his family; a tale, entitled \u2018The Nun of Arrouca\u2019 (1822); \u2018Don Carlos\u2019 (1822), a tragedy; \u2018Memoirs of the Affairs of Europe\u2019 (1824); and a translation of the Fifth Book of the Odyssey (1827). His writings first made his name familiar to the public, and the readers of his books became curious to read his speeches.\n\nAt the general election of 1820 Russell was returned for Huntingdonshire. Thenceforth for twelve years he mainly devoted himself to pressing parliamentary reform on the attention of the house. He made the subject his own, and treated it in a spirit that he thought would have won the approval of Fox. As far as electoral reform was concerned, he soon became the recognised leader of the whigs, excluding Lord Grenville's adherents. The disfranchisement of Grampound in 1821 was as much due to his efforts as to its own corruption. He moved in the House of Commons, on 25 April 1822, \u2018that the present state of representation of the people in parliament requires the most serious consideration of the House,\u2019 and, though the majority against his motion was 105, his speech was admitted to be an admirable presentation of facts and arguments. Moore was present, and noted in his \u2018Diary\u2019 (iii. 346) that Lord John's speech was excellent, \u2018full of good sense and talent, and, though occupying nearly three hours in the delivery, listened to throughout with the profoundest attention.\u2019 His next legislative effort was a bill for the discovery and suppression of bribery at elections, which was read a first and second time without a division in 1826, but was abandoned owing to the government declaring that they would oppose it. At the general election of that year he was defeated in Huntingdonshire, but in December he was returned for the Irish borough of Bandon on the nomination of the Duke of Devonshire. On 26 Feb. 1828 he moved for the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, a motion which, as he said, had not been made since Fox made it in 1790. Brougham powerfully supported and Sir Robert Peel, Huskisson, and Palmerston opposed him, yet he carried his motion by the unexpected and decisive majority of forty-four. After a bill giving effect to it had passed the commons, Lord Holland took charge of it in the House of Lords, from which it emerged with little mutilation, and became law on 28 April. This measure was succeeded by the Catholic Relief Bill, which Lord John cordially supported, and which was added to the statute-book on 13 April 1829.\n\nThe death of George IV, on 26 June 1830, was followed by a general election, at which Lord John was a candidate for Bedford; yet, despite his father's influence, he lost the election by one vote. His defeat was due to the Wesleyans, who had taken offence at some remarks of his on prayer. The \u200badministration presided over by the Duke of Wellington resigned on 16 Nov., and the whigs succeeded to power for the first time since 1806, with Earl Grey as premier. Though not in parliament, the office of paymaster-general of the forces was offered to Lord John (without a seat in the cabinet) and accepted; a vacancy being made at Tavistock, the electors returned him as one of their representatives on 27 Nov. Shortly afterwards Lord Durham and he, in concert with Sir James Graham and Lord Duncannon, were constituted a committee on behalf of the government to draft a measure of parliamentary reform. He was entrusted, although not a member of the cabinet, with the task of explaining the Government Reform Bill to the House of Commons, and of moving its first reading, which he did on 31 March 1831. His speech on this occasion formed an epoch in his career. His popularity throughout the country dates from its delivery.\n\nAfter seven days' debate the bill was read a first time; on 22 March the second reading was carried by a majority of one; on 18 April the ministry were in a minority of eight on the debate in committee; after a second adverse vote they resigned; but, as their resignation was not accepted by the king, they appealed to the country. Lord John was the hero of the hour. When he went to Devonshire for re-election crowds flocked to see him, and Sydney Smith, in his humorous way, informed Lady Holland that \u2018the people along the road were very much disappointed by his smallness. I told them he was much larger before the bill was thrown out, but was reduced by excessive anxiety about the people. This brought tears into their eyes\u2019 (Memoir of Sydney Smith, ii. 321). The general election gave the reformers an increased majority. Lord John was re-elected for Tavistock (30 April), and he was also elected for the southern division of Devon (10 May), for which he decided to sit. Early in June he was admitted to the cabinet, still retaining the office of paymaster of the forces. On the 24th he introduced the Reform Bill for the second time; it passed through the commons on 22 Sept. On 7 Oct. it was rejected by the lords. On 12 Dec. he introduced it into the lower house for the third time. An adverse vote on 7 May 1832 in the House of Lords caused the resignation of himself and his colleagues; but as Sir Robert Peel could not form a ministry they were reinstated, and the Reform Bill was read a third time in the House of Lords on the 4th and received the royal assent on 7 June. Lord John's popularity was at its zenith. Even the radicals, who hated the whigs, were disposed to make an exception in his favour. Replying to Thomas Attwood, who had sent him an address from Birmingham, in which he was thanked and the opposition of the peers was denounced, he said: \u2018It is impossible that the whisper of a faction should prevail against the voice of a nation.\u2019 These words were repeated again and again, and they materially helped to weaken the resistance to the Reform Bill.\n\nThe first reformed parliament met on 29 Jan. 1833, when the government majority was 315. The ministry set to work to pass many important measures. On 25 Feb. 1834 Russell introduced into the House of Commons the Dissenters' Marriage Bill to enable dissenting ministers to celebrate marriages in places of worship licensed for that purpose, while retaining the publication of banns in church. But it failed to satisfy the dissenters, and was for the time laid aside (Erskine May, Const. Hist. iii. 190). But Ireland was, as usual, the chief difficulty, and on this subject there were serious dissensions in the cabinet. Russell had visited that country in the autumn of 1833, and came back opposed to the coercive measures of Stanley, then chief secretary. These differences became acute on the introduction of the Irish Tithe Bill in 1834, which failed to satisfy either O'Connell or the radicals. On the second reading of the bill Russell declared that the revenues of the Irish church were larger than was necessary for the religious and moral instruction of its members or for the stability of the church itself (Hansard, xxi. 620). This declaration made a great impression; it was quite at variance with the views of Stanley and the less advanced section of the cabinet. In Stanley's words, \u2018Johnny had upset the coach!\u2019 and Stanley, together with the Duke of Richmond, Lord Ripon, and Sir James Graham, resigned office. A few days later Russell stated that Irish church reform was the principle on which the existence of the government depended; and the vigour with which he defended this principle greatly strengthened his influence with the radicals. In July Lord Grey resigned, and was succeeded by Lord Melbourne; and in November Lord Althorp, the leader of the House of Commons, succeeded to the peerage on the death of his father. The vacant leadership was offered to Lord John Russell; the king, however, strongly objected, and took the occasion summarily to dismiss his ministry (15 Nov.)\n\nPeel succeeded in forming an administration, parliament was dissolved, and the conservatives returned with largely increased numbers (273 to 380 liberals). Russell was now the recognised leader of the whigs \u200bin the House of Commons, but it was no easy task to bring into line the majority behind him, consisting as it did of \u2018old\u2019 whigs, radicals, and Irish members. At a meeting held at Lord Lichfield's house in February 1835 an agreement, called the \u2018Lichfield House compact,\u2019 was arrived at between O'Connell and the whigs without Russell's knowledge (Walpole, i. 219\u201323); and in the same month Russell gained the first victory over the government by carrying the election of James Abercromby [q. v.] to the speakership over Manners-Sutton, the ministerial candidate. Peel's government thenceforward suffered frequent defeats, and, in the contest with Peel, Russell developed qualities of which he had before given no evidence. \u2018He possesses,\u2019 wrote Charles Gore, \u2018all the temper and tact of Lord Althorp, with ten thousand times his eloquence and power.\u2019 On 30 March he proposed a motion that the house should resolve itself into a committee to consider the revenues of the Irish church; on 3 April it was carried by a majority of thirty-three, and on the 8th Peel resigned.\n\nMelbourne now took office, with Russell as home secretary and leader of the House of Commons. On offering himself for re-election for South Devon he was defeated by 627 votes, but a seat was at once found for him at Stroud. The position of the government was difficult; the king abhorred all his ministers, but hated Lord John worst of all, and was delighted at his defeat in South Devon (Greville, iii. 265). A majority in the House of Lords led by Lord Lyndhurst was no less hostile; in the commons Sir Robert Peel headed a powerful opposition; and the support of the radicals and O'Connell, whom Russell desired to see in office, was not to be depended on. The first measure of the government was the Municipal Corporations Bill, the conduct of which devolved almost entirely on Russell. It was carried without material alteration by large majorities in the commons, but underwent radical changes in the House of Lords. In the conflict which ensued between the two houses, the lords, on the advice of Peel and Wellington, yielded the more important matters in dispute, and the bill became law on 7 Sept. Its effect was to place municipal government once more on a popular basis in all the large towns, London excepted (Erskine May, iii. 278\u201386). Other reforms of which Russell was the principal author in the session of 1836 were the commutation of tithes into a rent charge upon land, the establishment of a civil registration of births, marriages, and deaths, and the legalisation of the marriage of dissenters in their own chapels. In the same session Russell introduced three measures dealing with the church: one equalising the bishops' incomes, combining some old sees and constituting some new ones; another applying the surplus income of capitular establishments to the general purposes of the church; and a third discouraging pluralities. The first of these measures passed in 1836; the two others became law in 1838 and 1839. In 1837 Lord John diminished the number of offences to which capital punishment was applicable, and he introduced a bill for the reform of the poor law, and an Irish municipal bill; but the progress of this legislation was stopped by the death of William IV and the consequent dissolution of parliament.\n\nThe general election resulted in further conservative gains. Russell's supporters numbered 340, the opposition numbered 313, and five were doubtful. Russell tried to persuade Melbourne to admit some of the more advanced members of the party into the cabinet, and to make the ballot an open question, instead of requiring all ministers to vote against it. Melbourne refused and Russell acquiesced in his decision. In his speech on the address (November 1837) he declared that it was impossible for him to take part in further measures of electoral reform. This declaration earned for him the hostility of the radicals and the nickname of \u2018Finality Jack.\u2019 Later on he denied having used the word \u2018finality\u2019 in the sense attributed to him. The outbreak of the Canadian rebellion compelled Russell to propose the suspension of the constitution of Lower Canada in 1838; and he subsequently carried a bill of indemnity to cover the acts of Lord Durham's government [see Lambton, John George]. In spite of this interruption to domestic legislation, Russell introduced a bill establishing reformatories for juvenile offenders, an Irish poor-law bill, and tithes bill without the appropriation clause, on which he had previously insisted; these bills became law during 1838.\n\nMeanwhile Glenelg's administration of the colonial office [see Grant, Charles] was giving serious dissatisfaction, and on 2 Feb. 1839 Russell threatened to resign unless some change were made. Normanby became colonial secretary, but in April the government had a majority of only five on the question of suspending the constitution of Jamaica, and the cabinet resigned. Peel was summoned, but declined to form an administration on hearing that the queen wished to retain the services of her whig ladies-in-waiting. The Melbourne ministry \u200bwas recalled, but Russell now became colonial secretary while Normanby took the home office. In his new capacity Russell introduced the Jamaica bill, which became law after it had been seriously modified by the lords. The bills for which Russell was more particularly responsible in the following session were the creation of a committee of the privy council to deal with education, the grant of 30,000l. for educational purposes, and the inauguration of the government inspection of schools. These measures as carried fell far short of Russell's original proposals, which were mutilated in the House of Lords, but they initiated government supervision and aid in education, and thus proved of supreme importance. His tenure of the colonial office was distinguished by the conversion of New Zealand into a British colony, and the formal claim to the whole of Australia.\n\nIn 1840 the danger of war between England and France with regard to Mehemet Ali and Turkey, and the difference of opinion between Russell, who wished to come to terms with France, and Palmerston, who took an opposite line, nearly led to Russell's resignation. Finally war was averted, and both Russell and Palmerston remained in office. Meanwhile the China war, coupled with stagnation in trade, caused recurring deficits in the budget. Early in 1841 the cabinet determined to reduce the duties on foreign timber, sugar, and other articles, and to substitute a fixed duty of 8s. on corn for the sliding scale established in 1828. Russell himself had declared, two years before, in favour of a moderate fixed duty. The proposed change was welcomed by the free-traders, but it won no adherents from the conservative side, and alienated many whigs. The government was defeated by thirty-six votes on 18 May. Nevertheless they determined to persevere; but on 4 June Peel's motion of no confidence in the government was carried by one vote. On the 23rd parliament was dissolved. The general election resulted in a great conservative victory. Russell accepted an invitation to contest the city of London, but was only returned as last of the four successful candidates. On the address in August the government were defeated by ninety-one votes, and gave way to Sir Robert Peel.\n\nDuring Peel's administration Russell led the opposition, but he supported the government on the question of the Maynooth grant, and in his famous \u2018Edinburgh Letter,\u2019 dated 22 Nov. 1845, declared for the total repeal of the corn laws, ignorant of the fact that Peel had already proposed this measure to his cabinet. Unable to carry his cabinet with him, Peel resigned, and on 8 Dec. Russell was summoned to form a ministry. But Lord Howick (Earl Grey since his father's death in July 1845) refused to serve if Palmerston were reappointed secretary for foreign affairs, and Russell's attempt failed. Peel returned to office, repealed the corn laws with Russell's support, and then introduced a new coercion bill for Ireland. This Russell opposed, and on 26 June 1846, the night on which the corn bill passed the lords, the coercion bill was defeated in the commons.\n\nIn July Russell succeeded in forming an administration for the first time, taking office as first lord of the treasury and premier; Palmerston went to the foreign office, Sir George Grey to the home office, Charles Wood to the exchequer, and Earl Grey became secretary for war and the colonies. The first difficulty that faced the new administration was the potato famine in Ireland, for the relief of which the government granted ten millions to be spent on public works. Parliament, which was prorogued on 28 Aug., met again in January 1847. After passing other remedial measures for Ireland, it enacted the Ten Hours Bill, introduced by John Fielden [q. v.], and vigorously supported by Russell, and also a bill establishing the poor-law board, subsequently merged in the local government board. Parliament was dissolved on 24 July. The new House of Commons comprised 325 liberals, 105 conservative free-traders, and 226 protectionists. Russell was returned at the head of the poll for the city of London. Parliament met in November; Ireland still blocked the way, and Russell, who remained prime minister, was compelled to introduce a coercion bill similar to that on which Peel had been defeated. It passed by large majorities, in spite of much opposition from the radicals. It was accompanied by two remedial measures, the Encumbered Estates Act and another measure giving the tenant compensation for improvements. The latter was, however, stubbornly resisted, and then referred to a select committee; its principle was not adopted by the legislature till twenty years later. In the autumn of 1847 Russell evoked a violent outcry among the high-church party by the appointment of Dr. Hampden to the bishopric of Hereford [see Hampden, Renn Dickson]. Abroad, his anxieties were greatly increased by the danger of rupture with France, and by the revolutionary movements in France, Italy, Spain, Poland, and Hungary; while further difficulty was created by Palmerston's disposition to act in foreign affairs independently \u200bof, and often in opposition to, his colleagues and the prime minister [for the foreign policy of Russell's government, see art. Temple, Henry John, third Viscount Palmerston].\n\nMeanwhile the revolutionary agitation in Europe found faint echoes in England and Ireland. The chartist movement died away after the fiasco of the meeting in London on 10 April 1848. In Ireland the Treason Felony Act of the same month and suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act (July) were followed by the easy suppression of Smith O'Brien's rebellion. Russell attempted to alleviate the situation in that country by a further amendment of the poor law, by endowing the Roman catholic priesthood, and creating a fourth secretary of state for Ireland in place of the lord-lieutenant; but the two latter measures proved abortive. Other measures which Russell endeavoured to pass in 1848 were bills for promoting the health of towns, for removing Jewish disabilities, and repealing the navigation acts. The first was successful, and the second was rejected by the House of Lords [see Rothschild, Lionel Nathan de]. The third measure, after being abandoned by the government in 1848, passed both houses next year (1849). In October Russell brought before the cabinet a new reform bill, but he was outvoted, and the measure went no further. His great measure of 1850 was the Australian Colonies Act (13 and 14 Vict. cap. 59), whereby Port Phillip district was erected into a separate colony under the name Victoria, and New South Wales was given responsible representative government. In November Russell's letter to the bishop of Durham, which was called forth by the \u2018papal aggression\u2019 (i.e. the bull creating Roman catholic bishops in England), and contained references to high churchmen as \u2018unworthy sons of the church\u2019 and to Roman practices as \u2018the mummeries of superstition,\u2019 was received with unbounded enthusiasm by protestants, and with equal disgust by high churchmen and Roman catholics. In February 1851 a bill was passed rendering illegal the assumption in England of ecclesiastical titles by Roman catholic priests, but was suffered to fall into desuetude. In the same month the government was defeated by one hundred to fifty-two votes on Locke King's motion for assimilating the county to the borough franchise. Russell at once resigned, but Stanley (afterwards Earl of Derby) was unable to form a ministry, and in March Russell returned to office.\n\nIn December Russell's disagreement with Palmerston came to a head. The latter, without consulting his colleagues, recognised the government formed by Napoleon after his coup d'\u00e9tat of 2 Dec., and, on the ground that Palmerston had exceeded his authority, Russell demanded his resignation. On 26 Dec. Granville succeeded him as foreign minister. Palmerston soon had his revenge. In February he moved an amendment extending the Militia Bill which the government had introduced in apprehension of invasion from France, and carried it by eleven votes. Russell resigned, after having acted as premier for four and three-quarter years. The Earl of Derby became head of a conservative administration, with Disraeli as chancellor of the exchequer. But Lord Derby's government had a brief existence. Parliament was dissolved in July 1852, and the conservatives were in a minority in the new House of Commons. Disraeli's budget was defeated in November, and Derby gave way next month to a coalition ministry of whigs and Peelites under Lord Aberdeen as prime minister. Palmerston became home secretary, Mr. Gladstone chancellor of the exchequer, and Russell foreign secretary. It was a coalition, but not a union, and neither party was satisfied with the amount of influence it possessed. Russell led the House of Commons, but on 21 Feb. 1853 he resigned the foreign secretaryship, being succeeded by Lord Clarendon; he remained in the cabinet without office, and continued to lead the house. During the session he introduced a bill enabling municipalities to rate themselves for the support of voluntary schools, but it did not pass. In October Aberdeen proposed to retire from the premiership in Russell's favour, but the cabinet would not sanction the change. In December Russell brought before the cabinet a new reform bill. Palmerston objected to it, and resigned; he was induced to withdraw his resignation, but it became evident in April 1854 that if Russell persisted with his bill the government would break up; he therefore postponed the measure. In May he suggested and carried into effect the separation of the war and colonial departments. In June he accepted the presidency of the council.\n\nMeanwhile England had drifted into war with Russia [see Canning, Stratford]. During the negotiations that preceded it Russell threatened to resign, because he was not fully consulted before decisions were taken, and because he was not prepared to support the porte against its Christian subjects; at the same time he was more hostile to Russia than Lord Aberdeen. The differences in the cabinet had an evil effect on the conduct of the war. Russell grew dissatisfied, and, being ill prepared to resist Roebuck's motion for \u200binquiry into the management of the war in January 1855, he retired from the administration. He then supported Roebuck's motion, which was carried by a large majority, and Aberdeen resigned. The queen sent first for Derby and then for Russell, but neither was able to form a government, and the task was entrusted to Palmerston. He became premier, retaining for the most part Lord Aberdeen's cabinet. Russell declined Palmerston's invitation to join the ministry, but accepted the post of plenipotentiary to the congress which was now assembling at Vienna in the hope of peace. While on the way at Paris he learnt that the Peelites (including Mr. Gladstone, Sir James Graham, and Sidney Herbert) had withdrawn from Palmerston's newly formed administration (23 Feb.). Russell now reluctantly accepted the colonial office, without, however, giving up his mission to Vienna. He arrived there in March, after visiting Berlin. Russia held out against the terms proposed, and Russell's view that a defensive alliance between England, France, and Austria afforded sufficient guarantee for the security of Turkey was not accepted by the ministry. The congress effected nothing, and Russell once more threatened to resign. Nevertheless he was persuaded to remain in office, and to defend the government's policy in parliament, a course which involved him in a charge of inconsistency, and raised a great outcry when his own proceedings at Vienna were revealed by Count Buol. Unable by reasons of state to account in full detail for his course of action, Russell resigned on 13 July.\n\nFor nearly four years he remained out of office devoting his leisure to literary work. He supported Palmerston's government during the Indian mutiny, but protested against the arbitrary seizure of the Arrow in Chinese waters, and against the Conspiracy Bill, introduced, at Napoleon's instigation, after the Orsini plot of 1858. This bill was defeated by nineteen votes, and the conservatives, under Derby, came into office in place of Palmerston and his friends. Russell supported the new India Bill, which transferred the government of that country to the crown, but led the attack on Disraeli's Reform Bill in 1859. In the general election which followed its defeat the liberals had a majority of forty-eight, Russell being again returned for the city of London. He now took office as foreign secretary under Palmerston. On 1 March 1860 he introduced a reform bill into the House of Commons, reducing the qualification for the franchise to 10l. in the counties and 6l. in towns, and effecting a redistribution of seats; but the measure fell a victim to Palmerston's antipathy and the popular apathy. The question that mostly occupied him was the war of Italian liberation. He was an ardent advocate of \u2018Italy for the Italians,\u2019 and his efforts had a considerable share in bringing about Italian unity. Less successful was his opposition to the annexation of Savoy by France. During the autumn of 1860 Russell accompanied the queen on her visit to Germany. In July 1861 he was raised to the peerage as Earl Russell of Kingston Russell and Viscount Amberley of Amberley and Ardsalla.\n\nDuring the American civil war Russell maintained a strict neutrality between the belligerents. In September 1862 he wished to offer mediation between the north and south; but he failed to stop the sailing of the Alabama, whose depredations subsequently cost the government over 3,000,000l. Other important episodes during his tenure of the foreign office were the Polish insurrection and the seizure of Schleswig-Holstein. Russell sympathised warmly with the Poles, but was emphatic on the impossibility of England rendering any material assistance, and in the same way he saw the futility of England alone attempting to resist the Prussian and Austrian occupation of Schleswig-Holstein. On 22 Jan. 1862 he was created a knight of the Garter. There was little domestic legislation during this period, and in a speech delivered at the end of September 1864 Russell described the attitude of the country as one of \u2018rest and be thankful.\u2019\n\nThe general election of July 1865 confirmed the ministry in power, but on 18 Oct. Palmerston died. Russell became prime minister for the second time, with Mr. Gladstone as leader of the House of Commons. In March the government introduced a reform bill containing some of the provisions of Russell's abortive measure of 1860, with the addition of lodger enfranchisement. It met with lukewarm support in parliament, and the formation of the \u2018Cave of Adullam\u2019 led to the defeat of the government on 18 June 1866 [see Horsman, Edward; Lowe, Robert]. The consequent resignation of the cabinet and the formation of Derby's government brought Russell's official career to a close. He refused Mr. Gladstone's offer on 3 Dec. 1868 of a seat in the cabinet \u2018without other responsibility.\u2019\n\nDuring the later years of his life he was occupied with political speculations and literary work. In the House of Lords he frequently took part in debate, and he was foremost in supporting the policy of conciliation in Ireland, which he had adopted and pressed \u200bupon parliament in earlier years. In 1869 he introduced a bill in the House of Lords empowering the crown to create a limited number of life-peerages; it was rejected on the third reading. He was naturally a warm supporter of the Irish Land and Education bills of 1870, but voted against the Ballot Bill in 1871. A letter from him approving in the name of civil and religious liberty the anti-clerical policy of the German emperor was read at a public meeting held in St. James's Hall, London, on 27 Jan. 1874, to express approval of the German government's action in expelling various religious orders. His sympathy evoked the thanks of the German emperor and of Prince Bismarck, who styled him \u2018the Nestor of European statesmen.\u2019\n\nDomestic sorrow darkened his closing days. In the spring of 1874 his daughter-in-law, Lady Amberley, and her child died. Early in 1876 he lost his eldest son (Lord Amberley), and he was himself seized with an illness shortly afterwards from which he never entirely rallied. He died on 28 May 1878 at Pembroke Lodge in Richmond Park, where he spent the last thirty years of his life. The residence belonged to the queen, and she had granted Russell the use of it since 1847. Lord Beaconsfield proposed, with the approval of the queen, that he should have a public funeral and a tomb in Westminster Abbey; but his remains were laid, in accordance with his own wish, in the family vault at Chenies.\n\nRussell married, first, on 11 April 1835, Adelaide (d. 1838), daughter of Thomas Lister of Armitage Park, and widow of Thomas, second lord Ribblesdale, and by her had two daughters, Georgiana Adelaide, who married Archibald, third son of Jonathan Peel [q. v.], and Victoria, who married Henry Montagu Villiers [q. v.], bishop of Durham. He married, secondly, on 20 July 1841, Lady Frances Anna Maria Elliot, daughter of Gilbert, second earl of Minto, who died on 18 Jan. 1898. By her he had three sons and one daughter. The eldest son, John, viscount Amberley [q. v.], is separately noticed.\n\nThe excellence of Russell's literary achievement was not proportioned to its quantity. His historical work, entitled \u2018Memoirs of the Affairs of Europe\u2019 (1824), is but a fragment, and no more than a creditable compilation. Mr. Gladstone has, however, affirmed that \u2018Burke never wrote anything better\u2019 than some passages, especially that running, \u2018When I am asked if such or such a nation is fit to be free, I ask in return, is any man fit to be a despot?\u2019 Russell's \u2018Essay on the English Constitution\u2019 (1821) is the best work from his pen, while that containing the \u2018Letters of the Fourth Duke of Bedford\u2019 (3 vols., 1842\u20133\u20136), with an historical introduction, is the most useful and interesting. He also edited the \u2018Memorials and Letters of Fox\u2019 (4 vols., 1853\u20134\u20137) and the \u2018Diary of Moore,\u2019 but he barely realised the duties of an editor; his \u2018Life and Times of Fox\u2019 (3 vols., 1859\u201367) contains more politics than biography. His other works include the \u2018Life of Lord William Russell\u2019 (1819), \u2018Essays and Sketches\u2019 (1820), and \u2018Causes of the French Revolution\u2019 (1832).\n\nHis literary skill is most marked in his epistolary writing [cf. art. Merewether, John], and his speeches and writings abound in happy and telling phrases. No cleverer retort was ever made, according to Mr. Gladstone, than Lord John's to Sir Francis Burdett: \u2018The honourable member talks of the cant of patriotism; but there is something worse than the cant of patriotism, and that is the re-cant of patriotism.\u2019 It would not be easy to match the readiness of his reply to the queen and the prince consort, for which his nephew, Mr. George W. E. Russell, is the authority (Contemporary Review, lvi. 814). The queen said, \u2018Is it true, Lord John, that you hold that a subject is justified, in certain circumstances, in disobeying his sovereign?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 he replied, \u2018speaking to a sovereign of the House of Hanover, I can only say that I suppose it is.\u2019 Sir James Mackintosh was struck with his definition of a proverb, \u2018One man's wit and all men's wisdom.\u2019 Lord John added a proverb to the nation's stock: \u2018A spur in the head is worth two in the heel.\u2019\n\nHis training led him to excel as a politician, and he was at home in Downing Street and in parliament. The store of constitutional knowledge which he had laboriously acquired was always at his command, and this gave him weight in the House of Commons. He was not an orator of the first rank; still, he had the gift of impressing an assembly. He had not the faculty of moving an audience by perfervid rhetoric; but, despite certain mannerisms of speech which grated on the ear, he possessed the art of convincing intelligent hearers. It was only on rare occasions, as Bulwer Lytton wrote in the \u2018New Timon,\u2019 \u2018languid Johnny glowed to glorious John,\u2019 and he roused his audience to genuine enthusiasm. The impression which he made on Charles Sumner, an exacting critic, is noteworthy. \u2018Lord John Russell\u2019 (Sumner wrote in 1838 of a night spent in the House of Commons) \u2018rose in my mind the more I listened to him. In person diminutive and rickety, he reminded me of a \u200bpettifogging attorney who lives near Lechmere Point. He wriggled round, played with his hat, and seemed unable to dispose of his hands or his feet; his voice was small and thin, but notwithstanding all this, a house of five hundred members was hushed to catch his smallest accents. You listened, and you felt that you heard a man of mind, of thought, and of moral elevation\u2019 (Life and Letters of Sumner, i. 316).\n\nIn one of his earlier speeches in the house he affirmed that too much was talked about the wisdom of our ancestors, and that he wished their courage to be imitated. He possessed their courage in overflowing measure, a courage which was akin to rashness, and a self-confidence which resembled obstinacy. He was, indeed, what the Duke of Wellington said of him to Rogers, \u2018a host in himself.\u2019 His invincible self-reliance was regarded by Sydney Smith as his worst fault: \u2018I believe Lord John Russell would perform the operation for the stone, build St. Peter's, or assume\u2014with or without ten minutes' notice\u2014the command of the Channel fleet; and no one would discover by his manner that the patient had died, the church tumbled down, and the Channel fleet been knocked to atoms\u2019 (Sydney Smith, Works, iii. 233).\n\nLike Fox, he was short in stature, but he was devoid of Fox's geniality. The freezing manner on which Bulwer Lytton insisted in his description of Lord John was very manifest in his early years. His father wrote to him at the end of the session of 1837\u20138: \u2018There are circumstances in which you give great offence to your followers (or tail) in the House of Commons by not being courteous to them, by treating them superciliously, and de haut en bas, by not listening with sufficient patience to their solicitations or remonstrances\u2019 (Spencer Walpole, Life, i. 304). In private life he was a genial companion, and what Greville said of him when at Woburn Abbey in 1841 (Memoirs, ii. 140) applies to his whole life: \u2018John Russell is always agreeable, both from what he contributes himself, and his hearty enjoyment of the contributions of others.\u2019 Motley, the American historian, wrote of him that, \u2018in his own home, I never saw a more agreeable manner.\u2019 He was never happier than when surrounded by his children and his books. Field sports did not attract him, though he practised shooting at birds when a boy, and killed a boar when attending Queen Victoria in Germany in 1860.\n\nAs a statesman he was a sincere but not a demonstrative patriot; he wrote of England as \u2018the country whose freedom I have worshipped.\u2019 Proud of his country and jealous of its honour, he nobly upheld the whig motto of civil and religious liberty throughout the world. Every movement for freedom had his hearty support. He championed every measure that he believed would increase the happiness of the people. National education was as dear to him as parliamentary reform. He was reproached with showing undue favour to members of his own party and family, yet he was never convicted of exercising his patronage to the detriment of the public welfare, and, while remembering his relatives, he did not neglect his friends. His own literary tastes made him a discriminating patron of letters and learning. He was responsible for the appointment of Tennyson as poet-laureate, and of Sir John Herschel as master of the mint. In 1846, when Wordsworth was candidate for the lord-rectorship of Glasgow University, Russell declined to stand against him. He gave the Royal Society 1,000l. of public money to be spent on scientific research. In 1872 he served as president of the Royal Historical Society. While an earnest and enlightened churchman, he was the friend of many nonconformists.\n\nHis personal characteristics were set forth by himself with modesty and truth in 1869, in the introduction to his speeches: \u2018My capacity, I always felt, was very inferior to that of the men who have attained in past times the foremost place in our parliament and in the councils of our sovereign. I have committed many errors, some of them very gross blunders. But the generous people of England are always forbearing and forgiving to those statesmen who have the good of their country at heart.\u2019 Nine years later, when his life was ebbing away, he said to his wife, \u2018I have made mistakes, but in all I did my object was the public good.\u2019\n\nRussell was an original member of the Reform Club, where his portrait is conspicuous in the hall. In the National Portrait Gallery is a painting of Russell, presented by the painter, G. F. Watts, R.A., and he was also painted by Sir Francis Grant, P.R.A. There is also a marble bust, sculptured in 1832 by John Francis.\n\n[Walpole's Life of Lord John Russell; Reid's Lord John Russell; Speeches and Despatches, and Recollections and Suggestions by Earl Russell; Hansard's Parliamentary Debates; Greville's Diaries; Torrens's Memoirs of Lord Melbourne; Moore's Diary; Sir Theodore Martin's Life of the Prince Consort; Ashley's Life of Palmerston; Life and Times of Sir Robert Peel, by W.

Jeffrey Weaver summarizes the military service of Riley Russell as follows:\n\n\"RUSSELL, RILEY F.: 20, 1860 GCC HH#1340, Co. I, 51st Va. Inf. Enlisted on 7/27/61 at Camp Jackson. Deserted on 8/3/61. Age 30, 1870 GCC.\"\n\nHere, the middle intial of Riley Russell is given as \"F\", however, other sources indicate that it was \"O\". Indeed, there was a Riley F. Russell, son of Samuel and Rebecca Hash Russell. However, at the outbreak of the Civil War, he was living in Owsley County, Kentucky. Moreover, the stated dates indicate that Riley was enlisted for no more than a few days. Concomitantly, it is known from other reliable sources that Riley was mentally handicapped, therefore, this is not surprising.

Celia Russell was reportedly born November 1, 1831, in Smyth County, Virginia; however, the county was not formed until February of 1832 from portions of Wythe and Washington Counties. In addition, Celia indicated in the population schedule of 1900 that she had been born in March of 1835. Even so, earlier population schedules suggest that a birth year of 1835 is too late; hence, March of 1833 would seem more likely correct. She and James N. Stuart were married in Grayson County, Virginia, but after their marriage evidently settled in Smyth County near her family. This is affirmed by both civil and census records. Even so, the population schedule of the 1860 US Census for Hawkins County, Tennessee, reveals that the family moved to the vicinity of Mooresburg about 1855 and, evidently, remained there for the rest of their lives. In addition, in the census of 1900 Celia further indicated that she had been the mother of five children, only one of which was still living. Of these five, only three can be definitely identified; hence, the remaining two are unknown to history. Concomitantly, her widowed son-in-law, William Young, was living nearby with six children, which suggests that only Celia's daughter, Elizabeth, remained alive at the turn of the century. Geographically, Hawkins County is located in northeastern Tennessee, and adjoins Scott County, Virginia, to the north. Concomitantly, it is about one hundred miles west southwest of Grayson County. Although this distance might not seem large, the landscape is broken by mountain ridges and valleys, which no doubt rendered travel difficult in the nineteenth century.\n\n1-1. Mary A. Elizabeth Stuart, born 1849 in VA, married on 25 Sep 1870 in Hawkins Co., TN, John Omy. They hd James, Joseph, Robert L., and William D. Omy.\n\n1-2. Martha J. Stuart, born 1851/1852 in VA. Evidently died before 1870.\n\n1-3. Melvina C. Stuart, born ~1856 in TN, died ~1897; married on 4 Mar 1877 in Hawkins Co., TN, William D. Young, born Jun 1850 in TN. They had Dartholia, Adda, George, Maude, Ella, Martha, Celia, and Robert Young.\n\nb. The household of James and Celia Stuart is affirmed by census records for Smyth and Hawkins Counties. (1850 US Census Population Schedule for Smyth County, Virginia, National Archives, Washington DC: pg. 226B, (microfilm roll - M432_976; img. 451); 1860 US Census Population Schedule for Hawkins County, Tennessee, National Archives, Washington DC: pg. 140B, (microfilm roll - M653_1255; img. 286); 1870 US Census Population Schedule for Hawkins County, Tennessee, National Archives, Washington DC: pg. 157B, (microfilm roll - M593_1535; img. 299); 1880 US Census Population Schedule for Hawkins County, Tennessee, National Archives, Washington DC: pg. 343A, (microfilm: roll T9_1261; img. 258); & 1900 US Census Population Schedule for Hawkins County, Tennessee, National Archives, Washington DC: pg. 185B, (microfilm roll - T623_1577; img. 375).)\n\n2. Rebecca Russell was reportedly born in Grayson County, Virginia, although she may instead have been born in Smyth County. She and James Preston Ross were married in Grayson County, probably about 1854; however, they had moved to Letcher County, Kentucky, by the time their second surviving child was born. Letcher County adjoins Wise County, Virginia, and is about ninety miles northwest of Grayson County. Census records imply that they remained in Kentucky until 1869 or 1870, but then returned to Grayson County where James Ross died. Indeed, Rebecca Ross and her two youngest children appear twice in the population schedule of the 1870 US Census for Grayson County, viz., in the household of James P. Ross and in the household of John Russell. These kinds of errors are not unusual in nineteenth century census records; however, this may also be an indication of some sort of family difficulty, but this is merely speculation. Even so, it seems likely that James Ross died, perhaps, later in the census year. Subsequently, Rebecca Russell Ross married James Warner and moved to Ashe County, North Carolina.\n\n2-1. Sarah Elizabeth Ross, born 2 Feb 1856 in Grayson Co., VA, died 6 Nov 1927, buried Round Hill Cem., Smyth Co., VA; married 1 Jan 1881 in Grayson Co., VA, William Winston Kegley, born Jul 1862 in Grayson Co., VA.

They had Celia Malvina, Isaac Edgar, and Ova Louvina Testerman.\n\n2-5. William M. Ross, born ~1865 in KY.\n\n2-6.

Rufus Rupert Russell apparently did not follow the usual social conventions prevailing in the nineteenth century. Even so, he and Elza Ellen Farmer were evidently married about 1855, probably in Carroll County, Virginia. She was the daughter of Isaiah and Gilly Smith Farmer, who were living in Carroll County with ten children (including \"Elsey P.\", age fourteen) in 1850. Indeed, her name is rendered inconsistently in census records as \"Elsey\", \"Elsy\", \"Ailsey\", \"Alcy\", \"Alsie\", or \"Alcie\"; however, her tombstone affirms \"Elza\" as the correct form. Moreover, Rufus appears to have left the family by 1860, since his wife was evidently resident with two young sons in the household of her father.\n\n3-1.

Census records of 1860 indicate that Elza Ellen Russell and her two sons, William and Joseph, were resident in Carroll County, Virginia, in the household of her father, Isaiah Farmer. (Clearly, this implies that Joseph was probably born in 1859 instead of 1861 as reported by other researchers.) She seems to have lived in carroll County with relatives for the remainder of her life.

Arnell, a Special Examiner of the Bureau of Pensions, personally appeared Josephine Russell, who, being by me first duly sworn to answer truly all interrogatories propounded to her during this special examination of aforesaid claim for pension, deposes and says: I am 72 years old, have no occupation, my post office is Mooresburg, Tennessee. I am the widow of John H. Russell who served as a soldier in the Union army during the civil war but I do not know what company and regiment he served in, neither do I know the dates of his enlistment or discharge. He had only one enlistment. I had my husbands papers when I applied for pension and secured his service from them. I had no near relative in the World War and did not draw money on account of the service of any one in that war.\n\nI was born about two miles from here and always lived in this neighborhood until I married John H. Russell. My maiden name was Josephine Locke. My father was Aquilla Locke. I married Mr. Russell November 11, 1881. I get that from a record that I have. I do not remember the date myself but I was about twenty eight or twenty nine years old when I married him. We were married by Dr. Johnson a Justice of the Peace. We were married in the public road in sight of this place. It was a runaway affair. The only ones present to witness the marriage were John Vaughn's wife and Kate Pease. I suppose both are dead. I know Kate Pease is and John. Vaughn has been gone from here for a long time. I had never been previously married. Mr. Russell and I lived together from the time of our marriage until his death. There was never a separation or divorce between us. We lived in this neighborhood most of the time. We lived a short time at Concord, at Johnson City, at Morristown, and at Russellville, but we did not live at any of those places more than a year in succession. Mr. Russell died going on two years ago, but I do not remember the date of his death. We were living together at the time of his death. I have not remarried since he died.\n\nI was acquainted with John H. Russell three or four years before we were married. He was married and living with his wife when I made his acquaintance. his wife was Rose Russell, one of old Aaron Russells daughters. Rose Rusell is dead and buried across here in the Rogers Graveyard. I did not see her after her death but I have been to her grave. Soldier and Rose had five children. A right smart little bit after the death of Rose, about a year thereabouts I should think, Mr. Russell married my sister Mary Locke. He lived with Mary until she died. I do not remember the date of her death but it was on the 18th of June of the same year we were married. We were married during the winter following the death of my sister. I was not present when my sister died but I saw her after her death. She died right here on this place. Those are the only two marriages that I know anything about his having contracted. Both of his wives are laying right over yonder in the graveyard. Mr. Russell came from Elk Creek, Virginia. I don't know where that is. He told me he married Sarah Jane Serginor up yonder in Va, on Elk Creek. I do not know anything about her people. My husband told me he married her before he went into the army and that when he came back from the army she was married to some other man and had two children. I do not know who she married. No sir, she had not secured a divorce from the soldier that I ever heard of he told me she afterwards died, but I do not know when she died or where. He told me that both before we were married and after. He had only one child by that wife, a girl, but I have no idea what became of her. She got married but I do not know who she married. my husband has two living brothers, William, called Dock, and Marion Russell. He also has a sister named Darthula up in Virginia. She is married but I do not know the name of her husband. I sent Henry Brooks up to Elk Creek but he said he couldn't find out anything about that wife. John H. Russell - had five children by his second wife. their names are Lewis, Lou, Doll and Lillie. There was one other but I do not know her name. Lewis is the only one living. He doesn't know anything about soldier's first wife. Mary Elizabeth is his daughter. I don't know anything about her. I never heard of James H., Lou Bell, Louis M. Tolbert and Lillie were children by Rose. He had two children by Mary. Quill and Mary. We had four children, Bettie, Cebe, Mamie and Lide. All are living but Cebe. I never saw any one who knew my husband before he came to Tennessee except his brothers Marion and Dock, and his sister Celie. None of them said anything to me about his first wife. Celie is dead. My husband told me that his first wife was dead but he never told me where she was when she died. He was living apart from her when she died. He had no personal knowledge of her death, said some one told him that she was dead. I don't know who told him. I don't know what my husband meant in saying that his first wife died in 1890 for he told me. That she died before he married me. I can't furnish any evidence whatever as to the death of his first wife and I never heard anything about either one of them securing a divorce.\n\nI have no attorney. We paid Brooks twelve dollars to go to Virginia and look up the first wife. That was for his expenses. he was to charge me twenty four dollars more if I secure a pension. I have no other contract as to fee. I have no complaint to make as to the manner, conduct, or fairness in the examination of my claim. I do not care to be present at the further examination of the claim.\n\nI have understood and my answers are correctly recorded. /s/Josephine Russell deponant (her mark) Witness: G. T.

I am acquainted with the claimant Josephine Russell, have known her since my boyhood, and I knew the soldier John Russell during his life time. I made the acquaintance of John H. Russell about forty eight years ago and knew him well from that time until he died. The claimant was not married when I made her acquaintance and was never married until she married John H. Russell. I was not present at their marriage but remember the fact of their marriage. They were married here in Hawkins County not over a mile and a half from here. From the time of their marriage until Russell died they lived together as man and wife, were never separated or divorced. Claimant's maiden name was Josephine Locke. Russell said he came from Virginia and claimed to be an unmarried man when I first knew him. He worked around here for a time and then married Rose Russell a daughter of Arron Russell. I was not present at the marriage to that wife. They lived together for some years, had about four children, and then Mrs. Russell died. I was not present at her death and did not attend the funeral but I know when she died and that she was buried at Rogers graveyard about a mile from here. I have seen her grave. I cannot give the exact date of her death. After the death of that wife Russell remained single for quite a little time and then married Mary Locke sister of the claimant. They lived together something over two years I should say and then said wife died. I was at her funeral. She was also buried at the Rogers graveyard.\n\nShe died June 18, 1881, and Russell married the claimant in the following November. I heard that Russell was married before he came to this section but I know absolutely nothing about that marriage. Claimant has tried to trace her down but has been unable to do so. Russell died during November 1919.\n\nThe affadavit on B.J.22-23 is mine. The affadavits are correct only the wife Mary died in 1881 as 8 have herein stated.\n\nI am not related or interested.

Russell. I know very little of my said brother as I was very small when he went into the army. What I know of him I got from my father and mother. They would frequently talk about him. He married only a short time before he went into the army. His first wife was a Serginer, I think, but I have no remembrance of ever seeing her. I do not know her given name and never knew any of her people. It was something like a year after the close of the war before my brother returned to his home. His wife had heard that he was dead and she had remarried. It seems to me that she married a man named Black but I do not know his given name and I have no idea where he came from and do not know what became of him. When my brother came back he hunted his wife up. She wanted to turn the man loose that she married and go and live with my brother again, but he told her to stay with him and that he would go off and find another woman. She remained with that husband and my brother went off. I do not know where he went but he lived in Tn, but I was never over there but once and know nothing about his marriages. There were six boys and six girls in our family, four boys and four girls still living. The boys beside me are Rufe, Noah, and William. Rufe was somewhere in Indiana and last I knew of him, but I have no idea what his post office was or the county in which he lived. Noah lives at Red River Furnace, Ky. Staunton is the county seat. William lives somewhere in W Va but I don't know where. Mrs. Linnie Adkins of Monrat, Va might be able to tell you his address. My sisters are Celia Steward (dead), Sarah Loveless widow of Elbert Loveless, who lives a little off the Rock road at Adwolf about half way between Seven Mile Ford and Marion, Nan Warner who lives at Martinsville, Va and Linnie Adkins. Nan and Linnie would not know anything more about John and his wife than I do as they are too young.\n\nThe affadavit on B. J. 11 is mine.

(Michelle Gentry Hagan (tr), home.hawaii.rr.com/gentryfamily/RussellPenDec.htm, July 9, 2001.))\n\nm. Details of the military service of John H. Russell remain vexing; however, both his his brother William D. Russell and his widow, Josephine Locke Russell, affirm that he served in the Union Army. In addition, his widow claims to have had his \"papers\" (presumably an honorable discharge) in her possession, but perplexingly, she did not seem to know any further details except that he had enlisted only once. Indeed, although census records reveal that Josephine could neither read nor write, since she would have expected to receive significant financial benefit from a pension, it seems inexplicable that she would not have remembered at least some details of her husband's service. In any case, although William Russell was ten or twelve years younger than his brother, he appears to have accompnied John when he settled in Hawkins County, Tennessee, after the Civil War. Therefore, it may be supposed that William was personally informed regarding his brother's service by the soldier himself and, consequently, that his testimony that John served with the Union is accurate, but, again, no further details are included in his sworn deposition. Concomitantly, some researchers assert that John H. Russell enlisted in the First Connecticut Heavy Artillery; however, published regimental histories do not support this and clearly indicate that the \"John H. Russell\" appearing on the roster of Company K was from Windham, Connecticut, and, therefore, should not be identified with John Harvey Russell from Virginia. Within this context, in the special schedule for veterans and widows of the US Census of 1890 there is an entry for an individual living in Hawkins County, viz., \"John C. Russell\" or \"John U. Russell\", that could be plausibly associated with John H. Russell (although the original document is quite difficult to read). However, this veteran is clearly identified as a \"Confederate\", which does not accord with sworn testimany. Furthermore, the associated post office address is \"Slide, Tenn\", which would indicate a location ten to twenty miles distant from the village of Mooresburg and, considering the difficulty of travel in the nineteenth century, it is improbable that this entry corresponds to John Harvey Russell. Even so, it is, perhaps, surprising that John served with the Union, all the more so because several of his close relatives from Grayson County, Virginia, are known to have served with the Confederacy. (Indeed, this illustrates the division of loyalties in families that was common in the Upper South during the Civil War.) Furthermore, although there were evidently a number of Union soldiers identified in regimental records as \"John\" or \"Harvey\" Russell, as yet none have been identified definitively with John Harvery Russell, son of John F. and Naomi Russell.

William Daily (Dock) Russell## was described in later oral traditon by a grandson as a \"travelling medicine man\" (which undoubtedly accounts for his nickname \"Dock\"), who had a flamboyant personality and \"wore his long coal black hair down to his shoulders like Wild Bill Hickcock\". He evidently also moved to Hawkins County, Tennessee, in the 1860's, perhaps, with his older brother, John Harvey, since civil records affirm that he and Eliza Northern were married in this locality in early 1867. (The marriage register indicates that the license was issued January 7, but according to family tradition, they were not married until January 10.) Although Wiiliam and Eliza do not appear in any population schedule of 1870, it seems that they settled in Hawkins County and remained there until after 1880. However, they subsequently moved to Whitley County, Kentucky, where family tradition affirms that he bought a rock quarry. It would appear that Eliza Northern Russell died before 1910; moreover, the population schedule of that year indicates that William had remarried to a much younger woman, Amamda J. *****, and that the couple was living in neighboring Knox County, Kentucky. Nothing further is known concerning this marriage and in 1920, William had evidently remarried again to Dollie *****. They were living in the city of Knoxville, Tennessee, with two daughters, Lizzie and Reba, ages sixteen and fourteen years, respectively. Within this context, it seems more likely that these two adolescents were step-daughters rather than William's daughters. Concomitantly, in city directories for Knoxville published between 1921 and 1926, William D. Russell is identified as a \"herb doctor\".\n\n8-1.

Therefore, it is almost certian that this was the household of William Porter Russell, son of William Dailey and Eliza Northern Russell.

Rose by his mother Alice Russell Rose. Her father, William D. Russell was a traveling medicine man. He was a flamboyant man who wore his long coal black hair down to his shoulders like Wild Bill Hickcock. Tom recalls seeing a picture of him once. He traveled much of the year and would come home every few months with money for the family. Alice recalled that her father had a medicine for just about anything that ailed you. He even claimed to have a formula that could make hair grow on a door knob. As a young man Thomas J. Rose, Sr., went on the road with his father-in-law, William D. Russell for about a year. He didn't care for life on the road and returned to his young family. Tom and Alice Rose's daughter, Madge married into the Ramsey family of Cedar Grove, West Virginia. One of the Ramsey's owned a barber shop and when William D. Russell told them that he had a formula for hair growth, they figured it would be good for business. They reportedly paid $500.00 for the formula. William D. Russell was not one to give away his secret formula, so he gave the Ramsey's a alternate formula and quickly got out of town. William D. Russell later bought a rock quarry in Whitley County, Kentucky. His sons worked for him. Stones from the quarry stones were cut to pave streets.\"\n\n\"Rosa 'Rosie' lived in Fort Worth, Texas.\"\n\n\"Maggie's husband Sam Freeman joined the Army with her brother Frank Russell. Maggie and Sam settled in Acton, Massachusetts after the war.\"\n\n\"Frank Russell joined the Army with his sister Maggie's husband, Sam Freeman. Frank Russell worked in construction. He was killed when he fell from scaffolding in Georgia.\"\n\n\"Alice Russell Rose told her son, Thomas J. Rose, Jr. that as a girl she shot a bear. It seems that she was walking through the woods to a neighbors home when she came upon a bear and shot it with a shot gun. He described his mother as having nerves of steel.\n\nAs a young man in Williamsburg, Kentucky Tom Rose got into a few scrapes with the law. One of his uncles was a judge who helped him out. Tobias Rose offered his son, Thomas J. Rose, about thirty acres of land to farm when he married. Tom did not want to farm and instead worked for the railroad for several years. He ran into a labor agent who told him that he could make lots of money in the coal mines. Conditions were not as good as he had been told but he stayed on until he met another labor agent who offered him and his family free travel to Ward, West Virginia. They were also offered a new company house, a month's supply of groceries and the care of a company doctor. The plaster on the walls in his new house were still wet when he arrived in Ward. Initially the coal company took good care of its employees as skilled miners were in demand. As times got worse the coal company cut back on its benefits.\n\nIn the early 1950's Tom and Alice Rose retired to Falls Mills, Tazewell Co., Virginia. They lived comfortably on a small 8 acre farm on his social security benefit and miner's pension just down the road from their daughter Garnett. After Alice Rose died in 1959, Tom spent a year living with his daughter, Arlene Rose Truman in Toledo, Ohio. He enjoyed staying with Arlene because his granddaughter, Lynny (Thomas Jr's daughter) was there. Tom and Alice had taken Lynny in (at about age 4) when they lived in Ward, West Virginia. She lived with them until she was about 12 years old. Lynny was raised by Arlene and Bob Truman when they married in 1950. Tom returned to Falls Mills, Virginia where he met Leecy (surname unknown) who owned a small restaurant and bar in Falls Mills. Thomas Rose, Jr. says that Leecy was the granddaughter of the Clan chief of the Hatfields (of the Hatfields and McCoys Fued).

Nancy Jane Elizabeth Russell and Fielden Warner were married in Grayson County, Virginia, and evidently settled in this locality after their marriage. It seems likely that Fielden Warner died before 1900; however, no date or burial place is known. Concomitantly, in 1910 Nancy Warner, a widow, age fifty-seven years, was living in Grayson County with four younger unmarried individuals, viz., three sisters, Flora, Virginia, and Rosa Cox, and their brother, James Cox. In the population schedule, Nancy is indicated as \"servant\". It is not clear if the Cox siblings were Nancy's relatives or it this was simply a business arrangement. In any case, Nancy Warner indicated that she was the mother of eight children, five of whom were still living. Of these, only four can be identified from census and civil records. Subsequnetly, Nancy Warner appears to have moved to several different locations in southern Virginia. Accordingly, in 1920 it appears that she was resident in Appomattox County, but, nevertheless, in 1921 Marion Russell attested that she lived at Martinsville in Henry County, Virginia, and in 1930 she ws living with the family of her son, John, in Pittsylvania County, Virginia. It is likely that Nancy Russell Warner died in Pittsylvania County in the 1930's, but nothing definite is known.\n\n10-1. Noah W.

He served twice as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in the mid-19th century.\n\nRussell was known as \"Lord John Russell\", which is called a courtesy title. As the third son of the then Duke of Bedford, he was entitled to use one of the family's lower titles. Before becoming Prime Minister, he served in other important posts, such as Home Secretary, Colonial Secretary and Foreign Secretary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/bland-william-1793/russell-john-2619", "page_content": "by John M. Ward\n\nJohn Russell (1792-1878), statesman, was born on 18 August 1792 in Mayfair, London, the third son of John, sixth Duke of Bedford, and his first wife, Georgiana Elizabeth, second daughter of the fourth Viscount Torrington. Educated at Westminster School (1803-04) and Edinburgh University (1809-12), he began in 1813 that Whig political career for which his family connexions prepared him. He sat in the Commons almost without a break until 1861, when he was created first Earl Russell of Kingston Russell, Dorsetshire.\n\nRussell was more important as a British than an imperial statesman. He was in the forefront of the movement for the Reform Act of 1832. In Lord Melbourne's government (1835-41), he was the most powerful minister; and he was himself twice prime minister. He presided over the Colonial Office in 1839-41 and from February to July 1855.\n\nThe problems of Canada took up much of Russell's energies during his first term at the Colonial Office. The most important part of his Australian policy was the issue of an Order in Council, 1 May 1840, to stop convict transportation to New South Wales on 1 August that year. Russell had sat in the select committee on transportation (1837-38) and thought that New South Wales, with its large free population, should cease to be a penal station. His Order in Council was issued precipitately and caused resentment in the colony among those who wished for convict labour, and concern in England to those troubled by the difficulties of providing for the convicts elsewhere. Believing that there was no longer any need to fear the emancipists as a separate political force in New South Wales, Russell tried to liberalize its Constitution. In July 1840 he introduced a New South Wales bill designed to increase self-government by establishing a part-elective Legislative Council; the bill had no stipulations against emancipists, but it did provide for the separation of new colonies out of New South Wales. Russell abandoned it almost immediately because of his own doubts and the opposition that it raised.\n\nRussell intended also new measures of settlement. In December 1839 he dismissed the incompetent South Australian Commission. A month later he approved the appointment of a new board, the Colonial Land and Emigration Commission, to exercise wider functions throughout the empire as a whole, particularly in Australia. When he consulted them about land sales policy they advised him that all crown lands in New South Wales outside the Nineteen Counties and the towns already established should be sold at a uniform fixed price. In a dispatch of 31 May 1840 Russell proposed to divide New South Wales into three districts: the Northern including Moreton Bay, the Middle, and the Southern including the Port Phillip area. Land in the Middle District was to be sold by auction at a minimum upset price, and in the Southern District at a uniform fixed price of \u00a31 an acre, except in new towns. No immediate arrangements were made for the Northern District.\n\nAll Russell's measures for New South Wales aroused strong opposition. Governor Sir George Gipps thought the Constitution too liberal and preferred sales by auction to sales at a uniform fixed price. Powerful interests wished to retain convict labour. The Middle District did not wish the colony to be dismembered. In addition, South Australia was still in confusion; Van Diemen's Land was running down economically and, partly because transportation to New South Wales had ceased, was suffering from too many convicts. Russell resolved on retreat. In August 1841 he cancelled his instructions for the division of New South Wales and the alienation of crown lands. In addition to ending transportation to New South Wales and appointing the land and emigration commission Russell made a significant contribution in two other matters: he was responsible for the appointment of Captain George Grey as governor of South Australia, and in 1840 he had disallowed an Act of the Legislative Council of Western Australia that permitted the evidence of Aboriginals to be accepted without oath in criminal cases and provided that summary corporal punishment might be inflicted on people of this race.\n\nDuring Russell's first prime ministership (1846-52) imperial policy underwent great changes which he did little to promote and less to initiate. The third Earl Grey, who held the Colonial Office during those years, settled the government's policy on all important matters of empire, including the Australian Constitutions, land and immigration policy, and convict transportation. Russell objected privately to Grey's obstinate attempts to force convicts on the colonies, was lukewarm about his Federation proposals and thought Grey too active in policy-making. In none of these matters was his influence decisive.\n\nIn 1855 Russell was at the Colonial Office when some of the Australian Constitution bills were sent home. He decided to return the South Australian bill, which had been pushed through the Legislative Council of that colony to the annoyance of public opinion. By amending the New South Wales Constitution he defeated the attempts of that colony's conservatives to entrench their political position and persuaded parliament to pass an Act authorizing the Queen to assent to the New South Wales bill as amended. Because the Tasmanian bill was unexceptionable Russell at once obtained an Order in Council to put it into force, as allowed by the Australian Colonies Government Act of 1850. To complete the bargains made with the Australian colonies by Sir John Pakington and the Duke of Newcastle, while they were secretaries of state for war and the colonies, parliament in 1855 passed 18 & 19 Vic. c. 56, which gave the colonies control of their own land policies.\n\nRussell declined in 1855 to act on suggestions from New South Wales, Victoria and the General Association for the Australian Colonies, a private body in London, that the new Constitutions should be crowned with a federal assembly. Britain, he declared, would not federate the Australian colonies except at their official request.\n\nRussell died at Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park, Surrey, on 28 May 1878. He often doubted whether self-governing colonies would remain in the empire, but, so far as Australia was concerned, he nearly always supported the liberal side.\n\nThe National Gallery, London, has portraits by G. F. Watts and Sir Francis Grant, and a marble bust by John Francis."}], "John Russell died of his wounds on 28 October 1857.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Russell-1st-Earl-Russell", "page_content": "John Russell, 1st Earl Russell, also called (until 1861) Lord John Russell, (born Aug. 18, 1792, London, Eng.\u2014died May 28, 1878, Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park, Surrey), prime minister of Great Britain (1846\u201352, 1865\u201366), an aristocratic liberal and leader of the fight for passage of the Reform Bill of 1832.\n\nRussell was the third son of John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford. (As the younger son of a peer, he was known for most of his life as Lord John Russell; he himself was created earl in 1861.) He thus came of a family that had long demonstrated its public spirit. The depth of his liberalism probably owed much to an untypical education. Poor health forbade the rigours of an English public school, and later, his father, who was critical of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, sent him to the University of Edinburgh, where he drank deeply of Scottish philosophy.\n\nIn 1813 he became a member of Parliament and four years later made his first important speech\u2014characteristically, an attack on the government\u2019s suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. In December 1819 Russell took up the cause of parliamentary reform, making it in the early 1820s not only his own cause but also that of the Whig Party. When the Whigs came to power in 1830, he joined the small ministerial committee that was to draft a reform bill, and on March 31, 1831, he presented it to the House of Commons. Overnight, he had won a national reputation.\n\nIn the 1830s and \u201940s, Russell remained the chief promoter of liberal reform in the Whig Party\u2014although never again, perhaps, was this role so glorious as in the protracted but successful conflict over the passing of the first Reform Bill. As paymaster general under Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, during roughly the first half of the 1830s, Russell championed the cause of religious freedom for both English Dissenters and Irish Roman Catholics. Indeed, he pursued these aims so zealously that, in seeking to divert some of the wealth of the established Church of Ireland (which was Protestant) to the Roman Catholics (who formed the bulk of the population), he frightened such leading Whigs as Lord Stanley (later Earl of Derby) out of the party. In the second half of the 1830s, as home secretary under Lord Melbourne, Russell, among other things, democratized the government of large towns (with the exception of London). He also reduced the number of criminal offenses liable to capital punishment and began the system of state inspection and support of public education.\n\nEven out of office from 1841 to 1846, when he stood in opposition to Sir Robert Peel, Russell left his mark. In 1845, in advance of his party, he came out in favour of total free trade, a crucial step in forcing Peel to follow him. As a result Peel split his party, the Whigs came to power, and Russell became prime minister.\n\nThis administration (1846\u201352) demonstrated that, although Russell\u2019s penchant for advanced ideas was as strong as ever, his ability to implement them was now seriously reduced. He was able to establish the 10-hour day in factory labour (1847) and to found a national board of public health (1848). But, largely because of party disunity and weak leadership, he was unable to end the civil disabilities of the Jews, extend the franchise to the workers in the cities, or guarantee security of tenure to the Irish farmers.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nIn the remaining years of his public career, Russell\u2019s difficulties increased. Party disunity continued and brought down his second administration (1865\u201366) when he made his last attempt to extend the franchise. But more significant, in the 1850s the national temper had changed. An age of reform had given way to a mood of self-complacency, even of belligerence. This was already evident in the Ecclesiastical Titles Act of 1851, which Russell\u2019s government had passed and which in effect was England\u2019s defiance of the papacy.\n\nThis mood deepened, transformed, on the one hand, into an appetite for foreign conquest and, on the other, into boredom with social and political reform. In such an atmosphere Russell was inevitably overshadowed by the forceful and popular Lord Palmerston, who seized the forefront of the national stage in the Crimean War (1854\u201356). Indeed, for four years, from 1855 to 1859, Russell retired from public life and devoted more and more of his time to literature. Private life had always beckoned to him, as had the life of a litterateur. Among the English prime ministers, few wrote so copiously\u2014biography, history, poetry\u2014as Russell. He accepted an earldom in 1861, and he died at Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park, in 1878."}, {"url": "https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Russell_Scott/", "page_content": "(1785\n\n1868)\n\n(1787\n\n1861)\n\n28\n\n1812\n\n1825\n\n17\n\n1825\n\n1832\n\n33\n\n23\n\n1838\n\n1836\n\n1809\n\n9\n\n1888\n\n1830\n\n1831\n\n1837\n\n(1844)\n\n1843\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(1871)\n\n(1876)\n\n(1895)\n\n1965\n\n1844\n\n1851\n\n1860\n\n1865\n\n(1885)\n\nRussell's great love was applied science, and it was perverse fate which channelled him into complicating it with the economic cares of a large and uncertain business...

He was not embittered by the shabby treatment he received from fate, from his fellows or from his country.\n\n's father was the Rev David Russellwas a parish school teacher and a graduate of Glasgow University. His mother was Agnes Clarke Scott. He was her only child. Agnes, who married David Russell in Dublin, Ireland, died when John Scott Russell was very young. When John was three years old, his father became minister of Colinsburgh Relief Church, near Kirkcaldy, a congregation which had seceded from the Church of Scotland; but he soon moved on to a larger congregation in Hawick, and married Anne TittertononAprilin Kilconquhar, Fife and had more children. Later, he moved again, to Errol, near Perth.John Scott Russell was primarily an engineer and naval architect, rather than a mathematician; but his name is well-known to applied mathematicians today through his experimental discovery of the 'solitary wave'. This is now recognised as a fundamental ingredient in the theory of 'solitons', applicable to a wide class of nonlinear partial differential equations.John spent just one year at St Andrews University, before transferring to Glasgow University; there, he first added his mother's name, Scott, to his own. He graduated in, aged. In, he moved to Edinburgh, where he taught mathematics at a 'South Academy', perhaps founded by himself and a friend. Later, he also taught at the Leith Mechanics Institute, and gave courses on mathematics and natural philosophy to medical students, under the auspices of the Royal College of Surgeons. During, following the death of John Leslie , he substituted for the professor of natural philosophy at Edinburgh University; but he did not apply for the vacant post, which he was sure would go to David Brewster. In fact, the successful candidate was theyear-old James D Forbes, who had strong political and academic supporters. In, Russell was an unsuccessful applicant for the chair of Mathematics, which Philip Kelland secured.John Scott Russell married Henrietta Osbourne in. Henrietta was born in Ireland aboutand died in Ventnor, Isle of Wight onOctober. They had children Norman, Louisa, Mary and Alice.In thes Russell developed a prototype passenger-carrying steam carriage, but it met with opposition from the road trustees, and the venture failed. He had more success with the Union Canal Company, investigating the feasability of steam-powered canal transport and studying the connection between resistance to motion and wave-generation. He spoke of his work at early meetings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science , founded in; and the Association appointed him and Sir John Robison of Edinburgh to a 'Committee on Waves' to conduct observations and experiments. A substantial report by Robison and Russell appeared inand Russell alone wrote his major Report on Wavesfollowing Robison's death in. These reports, in fact all Russell's own work, contain a remarkable series of observations, at sea, in rivers and canals, and in Russell's own wave tank constructed for the purpose. There, Russell's \"Great Wave of Translation\" is described in detail.Russell's experimental work helped to stimulate a revival in theoretical hydrodynamics in Britain. George Green Philip Kelland and Samuel Earnshaw all attempted theoretical descriptions of the solitary wave, but these were not successful. Airy objected to the emphasis placed by Russell on his \"Great Primary Wave\", wrongly arguing that it was neither great nor primary, but just one consequence of the linear shallow water theory which hehad given. G G Stokes was more cautious, but he also doubted that the solitary wave could propagate without change in form. A correct approximate theory was at last given by Boussinesq and Rayleigh ; but the issue was not really settled until the appearance of the important paper by Korteweg and de Vries . The full significance of the solitary wave and its generalisation was finally uncovered in: seeandAfter working for a shipbuilder in Greenock, Russell moved to London in, with his wife and two young children. He first worked on a railway magazine, and he became secretary of the Society of Arts, a post which led to major involvement in planning the Great Exhibition of. Thereafter, he became increasingly involved in the design of yachts, boats, barges and ships, and he became a director of a ship-building company. He collaborated with Isambard Kingdom Brunel on the construction of the pioneering iron vessels Great Britain and Great Eastern; and was alone responsible for the successful iron warship Warrior.In thes, Russell's reputation suffered a number of setbacks from which it never recovered. He became embroiled in a lengthy financial dispute about an armaments contract; the Great Eastern suffered a serious breakdown; and he was controversially expelled from the Institute of Civil Engineers. His major published work, The Modern System of Naval Architecture, appeared in. Much later, he revisited his work on solitary waves, published posthumously as The Wave of Translation in the Oceans of Water, Air and EtherEmmerson's biography of Russelldeals authoritatively with his contributions of naval architecture, concluding that"}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/167720689/john-e-russell", "page_content": "Your suggestions have been submitted and will be reviewed by the memorial manager.\n\nYour edit did not contain any changes from the original.\n\nThank you!

In this short period, he conscientiously undertook the formidable tasks of overseeing the move of the Library from the U.S. Capitol Building into its own building and of expanding and reorganizing the institution as it took on new responsibilities and faced new expectations.\n\nYoung was born on Nov. 20, 1840, in County Tyrone, Ireland, the son of George and Eliza Rankin Young. Brought to the United States when he was less than a year old, he began his formal schooling in Philadelphia, then became a ward of an uncle in New Orleans, where he continued his public schooling. He returned to Philadelphia at age 15, apprenticed himself to another relative who was a printer, and it was then, as his biographer John C. Broderick relates, that his \"real education\" began. In August 1857, he secured a position as copyboy on the Philadelphia Press, beginning a long and fruitful association with its editor John W. Forney, who founded the Washington Chronicle in 1861. Through Forney, who also served as Clerk of the House of Representatives at various periods between 1851 and 1868, Young learned about politics and developed his strong pro-Union and antislavery sentiments.\n\nFollowing the Civil War, at the age of 25, Young became the managing editor of Horace Greeley\u2019s New York Tribune. Young resigned from the Tribune in 1869, in part because he differed with Greeley about the 1868 Republican nominee: Young favored U.S. Grant, Greeley promoted Salmon P. Chase.\n\nThroughout much of the 1870s, Young served as the New York Herald\u2019s European representative. After Grant left office, he urged Young to accompany him on a well-publicized trip around the world. Young agreed, and the result was the two-volume compilation, Around the World with General Grant (1879), an expansion of Young\u2019s dispatches to the Herald. Grant became Young\u2019s advocate, and recommended to President James Garfield in 1881 that Young become American\u2019s minister to Japan. Instead, it was President Chester A. Arthur who made Young an ambassador, appointing him as minister to China in 1882, a post in which Young served with distinction until 1885.\n\nYoung decided to return to his career in journalism and business in Philadelphia. There he was active in the Union League, which he had helped found in 1862, edited the city\u2019s Memorial History, and continued to take part in Republican party politics. He was president of the Union League for two years in the 1890s, during which time he arranged for a meeting of Confederate and Union military heroes at Gettysburg in April 1893.\n\nYoung\u2019s strong Republican connections, buttressed by his administrative capabilities, soon brought him the job of Librarian of Congress. He and president-elect William McKinley became close after McKinley\u2019s election in 1896, and while others felt that Young\u2019s appointment to another diplomatic post might be best, it was the job of Librarian of Congress that loomed. The Joint Committee on the Library\u2019s late 1896 hearings about the \"condition\" of the Library on the eve of its move into its new building made it clear that a new Librarian of Congress was needed to replace the 71-year old Ainsworth Rand Spofford. McKinley nominated Young on June 30, and he was confirmed by the Senate on the same day. The Washington Evening Star reported \"a thorough and amicable understanding\" between Young and Spofford, who indeed became Chief Assistant Librarian.\n\nYoung\u2019s business and political skills served him well during his brief term as Librarian of Congress. So did his broader intellectual interests and experience as a diplomat. He used his diplomatic ties, for example, to enlarge the Library\u2019s collections. In February 1898, he sent a letter to U.S. diplomatic and consular representatives throughout the world, asking them to send \"to the national library\" newspapers, journals, pamphlets, manuscripts, broadsides, \"documents illustrative of the history of those various nationalities now coming to our shores to blend into our national life,\" and other categories of research materials, broadly summarized as \"whatever, in a word, would add to the sum of human knowledge.\" By the end of 1898, books and other materials had been obtained from eleven legations and seven consulates.\n\nThe new Librarian skillfully guided the institution\u2019s administrative reorganization and expansion. He made many important professional appointments. While himself a political appointee, Young was nonpartisan in his selections and successfully distanced the Library from world of partisan politics. His appointees included Thorvald Solberg, the first register of copyrights, and catalogers J.C.M. Hanson and Charles Martel, who began reclassifying the collections after nearly a century of reliance on the classification scheme Thomas Jefferson provided to the Library along with his books.\n\nMany of Young\u2019s administrative innovations were apt and farsighted. Thorough a program of daily readings in a special \"pavilion for the blind,\" in November of 1897, Young inaugurated what today is one of the Library\u2019s best known national activities: library service for the blind and physically handicapped. He contemplated but did not establish a separate children\u2019s department. In his 1897 Annual Report he advocated the transfer of historical manuscripts from the Department of State to the Library and decried the use of cheap, nondurable paper by publishers, warning that many of the works coming into the Library \"threaten in a few years to crumble into a waste heap, with no value as record.\"\n\nYoung also was sensitive to Spofford\u2019s struggles on behalf of the national library prior to the Library of Congress\u2019s occupancy of its own separate building. Moreover, he shared Spofford\u2019s vision of the Library\u2019s future, commenting in his diary on June 12, 1898: \"I am trying to build the library far into the future, to make it a true library of research.\"\n\nLibrarian Young\u2019s Annual Report for 1898 demonstrates the broad range of his interests and his vision for the Library of Congress. Its appendices include reports on special collections, e.g. the newly acquired Gardiner Greene Hubbard collection of engravings and art books, the \"Jefferson Library,\" and the \"Chinese collection;\" an historical report on the \"close relations\" between the Library and the Smithsonian Institution; a list of the books received through the diplomatic and consular service; and his report on \"the durability of paper.\" It ends with what became Young\u2019s valedictory statement about the institution which he did so much to shape during his brief librarianship: \"With the considerate care of Congress and a due appreciation of what has been done and what may so readily be done by the American people, there is no reason why the Library of Congress should not rival those noble establishments of the Old World, whose treasures are a people\u2019s pride and whose growth is the highest achievement of modern civilization.\"\n\nJohn Russell Young suffered a severe fall on Christmas Eve, 1898, and never fully recovered. He died on January 17, 1899, after only nineteen months in office.\n\nYoung was married three times. His first two marriages were marked by sadness. He married Rose Fitzpatrick in 1864, but she was frequently ill until her death in 1881 and all three children of the marriage died in childhood. He remarried in 1882, but second wife Julia died in Paris in October 1883, two months after giving birth to their son, who was placed in the care of his mother\u2019s family, since Young was in Peking as minister to China. Young and his third wife Mary, whom he married in 1890, were the parents of Gordon Russell Young, who was born in 1891 and became a prominent military engineer and a commissioner of the District of Columbia.

There are columns and many shields of arms (including those of Russell, De la Tour, Meschems, Herring, Froxmere, Wise, Sapcote, Semark and Cook). Two female bedeswomen support the achievement of arms. The monument was redecorated by order of the Earl of Bedford in the 19th century and the most recent re-painting was done in the 1960s. At his feet is a small effigy of his infant son Francis, who was also buried in this chapel in 1581.\n\nThe inscriptions were composed by his wife Elizabeth, one of the most accomplished women of her day, except for one written by John's son in law. They are in English, Latin and Greek. The central English inscription reads:\n\nRighte noble twyse [twice] by virtue and by birthe, of Heaven lov'd, and honour'd on the earthe, his countris hope, his kindreds chiefe delighte, my husbande deare more than this worldes lighte, deathe hath me refte: but I from deathe will take his memorie, to whom this tombe I make.

Now weep, my girls, now make your pious moan, alas! the glory of your house is gone: death, hasty death, hath seized the stock that grew, and flourished with a stem of beauteous hue. Your sire, esteemed by all, by all desired, for learning, and for piety admired. Then you, his heirs, be what he was before, who shone by birth, but shone by virtue more\n\nThe second, translated from the Greek:\n\nThe once bright glory of his house, the pride of all his country, dusty ruins hide: mourn, hapless orphans, mourn, once happy wife, for when he died, died all the joys of life. Pious and just, amidst a large estate, he got at once the name of good and great. He made no flattering parasites his guest, but asked the good companions to his feast\n\nThe third Latin panel can be translated:\n\nOne of the same lady on the same subject in Latin. How was I startled at the cruel feast, by death's rude hands, in horrid manner dressed; such grief as sure no hapless woman knew, when thy pale image lay before my view. Thy father's heir in beauteous form arrayed, like flowers in spring, and fair, like them, to fade; leaving behind unhappy wretched me, and all thy orphan progeny: alike the beauteous face, the comely air, the tongue persuasive, and the actions fair, decay; so learning too in time shall waste; but faith, chaste lovely faith, shall ever last\n\nThe fourth panel:\n\nA poem of the afflicted Lady Elizabeth Russell, on the death of her son.\n\nBehold! the grandsire's joy, his sire's delight! my very soul, dire fate hath closed in night!

Death in sleep hath closed thine eyes; but thy free soul, far hence above the skies, expatiates; thoughtful now of death no more; whose virtuous life hath taken care before for such an end: And having yielded breath, still lives a glorious conqueror over death.

Accept this verse I offer at thy stone; you was my sire in love, and I your son.\n\nJohn was the son of Francis, 2nd Earl of Bedford, but died before his father on 24 July 1584. His wife Elizabeth, born 1528, was the daughter of Sir Anthony Cook and widow of Sir Thomas Hoby of Bisham Abbey. She was a sister to Lady Burghley and died in 1609 and lies buried, with a monument, in Bisham church, Berkshire. By Sir Thomas she had two sons, Edward and Thomas (who married Margaret Hoby) and two daughters. She married John on 23 December 1574 and had two daughters, as well as son Francis.\n\nElizabeth Russell\n\nShe was a daughter of John and Elizabeth and was born in the precincts of Westminster Abbey in her father's house and baptised in the Abbey. Elizabeth I and the Countess of Sussex were her godmothers and Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester her godfather. She was a maid of honour to the queen but died young of consumption in 1601.\n\nElizabeth Russell\n\nHer free-standing monument, once within a railing around the monument to her father, consists of an alabaster and marble pedestal, on which is her statue, seated in an osier, or wicker, chair with her right foot resting on a skull. Her head reclines on her right elbow and her left arm points to the skull. This led to the odd idea that she died by pricking her finger. But the skull is merely a symbol of mortality.

A happy accident is said to have brought him to court. The archduke Philip, son of the emperor Maximilian, was driven by heavy weather into Weymouth, whence Sir Thomas Trenchard had him escorted to the king at Windsor. According to tradition, John Russell, Trenchard's young kinsman, was lately home from his travels with a knowledge of foreign tongues, those travels being probably made in the mercantile interests of his family. As travelling companion, or as a spy upon the strange guests, young Russell was sent with the archduke, who is said to have commended him to King Henry. Certain it is that on the accession of Henry VIII. John Russell advanced rapidly, serving the crown as soldier and as diplomatic agent. He fought well at Therouanne, saw the Field of Cloth of Gold and the French disaster at Pavia, lost an eye by an arrow at Morlaix. In 1523 he was knight-marshal of the king's household. In 1526 he married a rich widow, Anne, daughter and co-heir of Sir Guy Sapcotes by the co-heir of Sir Guy Wolston, a match which brought to the Russells the Buckinghamshire estate of Chenies, in whose chapel many generations of them lie buried. His peerage as Lord Russell of Chenies dated from 1539, and in the same year he had the Garter. Having held many high offices - lord high admiral, lord president of Devon, Cornwall, Dorset and Somerset, and lord privy seal - he was named by Henry VIII. as one of his executors. At the crowning of Edward VI. he was lord high steward, and after his defeat of the western rebels was raised, in 1550, to the earldom of Bedford. Queen Mary, like her brother, made him lord privy seal, although he is said to have favoured that Reformation which enriched him. He died in London in 1555, leaving to his son a vast estate of church lands and lands forfeited by less successful navigators of the troubled sea of Tudor politics. In the west he had the abbey lands of Tavistock, which give a marquess's title to his descendants. In Cambridgeshire he had the abbatial estate of Thorney, in Bedfordshire the Cistercian house of Woburn, now the chief seat of the Russells.

Born into a family of British nobility, his mother, father, and a surviving twin sister died within eighteen months. An epidemic of diphtheria took his mother and sister, and although his father survived diphtheria, he died within eighteen months of bronchitis with respiratory failure. According to his father's will, his father did not want his remaining children to be raised as Christians.

Oliver Russell married Elizabeth Simmons in 1768 and John always referred to her as his mother. At a young age, in March 1777, he enlisted as a private in the 2nd Va. State Regiment in the Revolution for a term of three years. He served first under Capt. John Lewis and later under Capt. Machen Boswell. The regiment was commanded first by Col. Gregory Smith and later by Col. William Brent. This unit served for some time in the neighborhood of John Russell's home, which explains how he came to serve in a Virginia organization.\n\n\n\nJohn's service record notes that he was \"sick at Valley Forge\" in July 1778, \"sick at New Winsor\" in October of the same year, \"on General Muhlenberg's guard\" in March of 1779, and stationed at various camps throughout 1779, including Camp Smith's Clove, Camp Ramipan, Camp Ramapo, Camp Haverstraw, and finally Philadelphia, in December 1779, which would have been shortly before his term of enlistment was up.\n\n\n\nSometime in the late 1780's or early 1790's he married Elizabeth (Pfaff) Dixon, probably in or near Philadelphia. She was the daughter of George Pfaff, a printer in Philadelphia (see separate Pfaff article), and had a young son, Leonard Dixon. Elizabeth was born in Maryland on December 12, 1769 and died in Wellsburg on April 6, 1853, aged 83 yr., 3 mo., 25 days. Both she and John are buried in Brooke Cemetery, their graves having been moved from an earlier cemetery in 1879.\n\n\n\nIn 1799 John and his wife and two small children, his brother Oliver Jr. and his wife, and his youngest brother James went \"over the mountains\" to Wellsburg, then known as Charlestown, in western Virginia. Why they chose this area is not known. He bought land in the downtown area from Charles Prather from 1800 through 1811. He is mentioned in a Brooke Co. history as a town trustee in 1810 and on Robert Moore's 1809 storekeeper ledger as \"John Russell, Captain.\" He was appointed ensign in the 1st Battalion of the 103rd Regiment in the 10th Brigade and 3rd Division of the Virginia militia by Governor James Monroe on July 6, 1801. He was promoted to Captain on June 24, 1804, as shown in the Brooke County court order book.\n\n\n\nJohn Russell's primary occupation was as a cooper, and he is credited with a United States patent for saw teeth in 1815.

Oliver Russell married Elizabeth Simmons in 1768 and John always referred to her as his mother. At a young age, in March 1777, he enlisted as a private in the 2nd Va. State Regiment in the Revolution for a term of three years. He served first under Capt. John Lewis and later under Capt. Machen Boswell. The regiment was commanded first by Col. Gregory Smith and later by Col. William Brent. This unit served for some time in the neighborhood of John Russell's home, which explains how he came to serve in a Virginia organization.\n\n\n\nJohn's service record notes that he was \"sick at Valley Forge\" in July 1778, \"sick at New Winsor\" in October of the same year, \"on General Muhlenberg's guard\" in March of 1779, and stationed at various camps throughout 1779, including Camp Smith's Clove, Camp Ramipan, Camp Ramapo, Camp Haverstraw, and finally Philadelphia, in December 1779, which would have been shortly before his term of enlistment was up.\n\n\n\nSometime in the late 1780's or early 1790's he married Elizabeth (Pfaff) Dixon, probably in or near Philadelphia. She was the daughter of George Pfaff, a printer in Philadelphia (see separate Pfaff article), and had a young son, Leonard Dixon. Elizabeth was born in Maryland on December 12, 1769 and died in Wellsburg on April 6, 1853, aged 83 yr., 3 mo., 25 days. Both she and John are buried in Brooke Cemetery, their graves having been moved from an earlier cemetery in 1879.\n\n\n\nIn 1799 John and his wife and two small children, his brother Oliver Jr. and his wife, and his youngest brother James went \"over the mountains\" to Wellsburg, then known as Charlestown, in western Virginia. Why they chose this area is not known. He bought land in the downtown area from Charles Prather from 1800 through 1811. He is mentioned in a Brooke Co. history as a town trustee in 1810 and on Robert Moore's 1809 storekeeper ledger as \"John Russell, Captain.\" He was appointed ensign in the 1st Battalion of the 103rd Regiment in the 10th Brigade and 3rd Division of the Virginia militia by Governor James Monroe on July 6, 1801. He was promoted to Captain on June 24, 1804, as shown in the Brooke County court order book.\n\n\n\nJohn Russell's primary occupation was as a cooper, and he is credited with a United States patent for saw teeth in 1815. One of the lawyers who advised the patent office at that time was Francis Scott Key, and there is a letter from him commenting on John's invention. John also maintained a brewhouse for porter beer, planted orchards, and invested in local real estate.

(As the younger son of a peer, he was known for most of his life as Lord John Russell; he himself was created earl in 1861.) He thus came of a family that had long demonstrated its public spirit. The depth of his liberalism probably owed much to an untypical education. Poor health forbade the rigours of an English public school, and later, his father, who was critical of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, sent him to the University of Edinburgh, where he drank deeply of Scottish philosophy.\n\nIn 1813 he became a member of Parliament and four years later made his first important speech\u2014characteristically, an attack on the government\u2019s suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. In December 1819 Russell took up the cause of parliamentary reform, making it in the early 1820s not only his own cause but also that of the Whig Party. When the Whigs came to power in 1830, he joined the small ministerial committee that was to draft a reform bill, and on March 31, 1831, he presented it to the House of Commons. Overnight, he had won a national reputation.\n\nIn the 1830s and \u201940s, Russell remained the chief promoter of liberal reform in the Whig Party\u2014although never again, perhaps, was this role so glorious as in the protracted but successful conflict over the passing of the first Reform Bill. As paymaster general under Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, during roughly the first half of the 1830s, Russell championed the cause of religious freedom for both English Dissenters and Irish Roman Catholics. Indeed, he pursued these aims so zealously that, in seeking to divert some of the wealth of the established Church of Ireland (which was Protestant) to the Roman Catholics (who formed the bulk of the population), he frightened such leading Whigs as Lord Stanley (later Earl of Derby) out of the party. In the second half of the 1830s, as home secretary under Lord Melbourne, Russell, among other things, democratized the government of large towns (with the exception of London). He also reduced the number of criminal offenses liable to capital punishment and began the system of state inspection and support of public education.\n\nEven out of office from 1841 to 1846, when he stood in opposition to Sir Robert Peel, Russell left his mark. In 1845, in advance of his party, he came out in favour of total free trade, a crucial step in forcing Peel to follow him. As a result Peel split his party, the Whigs came to power, and Russell became prime minister.\n\nThis administration (1846\u201352) demonstrated that, although Russell\u2019s penchant for advanced ideas was as strong as ever, his ability to implement them was now seriously reduced. He was able to establish the 10-hour day in factory labour (1847) and to found a national board of public health (1848). But, largely because of party disunity and weak leadership, he was unable to end the civil disabilities of the Jews, extend the franchise to the workers in the cities, or guarantee security of tenure to the Irish farmers.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Party disunity continued and brought down his second administration (1865\u201366) when he made his last attempt to extend the franchise. But more significant, in the 1850s the national temper had changed. An age of reform had given way to a mood of self-complacency, even of belligerence. This was already evident in the Ecclesiastical Titles Act of 1851, which Russell\u2019s government had passed and which in effect was England\u2019s defiance of the papacy.\n\nThis mood deepened, transformed, on the one hand, into an appetite for foreign conquest and, on the other, into boredom with social and political reform. In such an atmosphere Russell was inevitably overshadowed by the forceful and popular Lord Palmerston, who seized the forefront of the national stage in the Crimean War (1854\u201356). Indeed, for four years, from 1855 to 1859, Russell retired from public life and devoted more and more of his time to literature. Private life had always beckoned to him, as had the life of a litterateur. Among the English prime ministers, few wrote so copiously\u2014biography, history, poetry\u2014as Russell. He accepted an earldom in 1861, and he died at Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park, in 1878."}]}
