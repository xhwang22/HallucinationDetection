{"Zhuang of Chu was forced to cede territory to Jin.": [{"url": "http://chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/personschuzhuangwang.html", "page_content": "Dec 2, 2010 \u00a9 Ulrich Theobald\n\nChu Zhuangwang \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 613-591) was a ruler of the state of Chu \u695a during the Spring and Autumn period \u6625\u79cb (770-5th cent. BCE) and was one of the so-called five hegemons (wuba \u4e94\u9738). His personal name was Mi Xiongl\u00fc \u8288\u718a\u4fb6 (also written \u718a\u5442 or \u718a\u65c5). The state of Chu is sometimes called Jing \u834a, and Xiongl\u00fc's posthumous title is also King Yan \u56b4\u738b.\n\nHe succeeded to the throne as son of King Mu \u695a\u7a46\u738b (r. 625-614). King Zhuang started his reign in a style of laissez-faire politics without much caring for the government. His advisors Wu Ju \u4f0d\u8209 and Su Cong \u8607\u5f9e opened him his eyes, so that he started restructuring the administration and strengthening the royal power with the support of Sunshu Ao \u5b6b\u53d4\u6556. The state took over the care for hydraulic works, dykes and dams, he built up a strong army and quelled the internal rebellion of a certain Ruo Ao \u82e5\u6556 (not King Ruo Ao, r. 791-764). His armies marched to the north, defeated the state of Song \u5b8b and the Rong \u620e barbarians of Luhun \u9678\u6e3e, and lined up before the domain of the king of Zhou \u5468.\n\nWith the awareness of his power King Zhuang of Chu menaced the King of Zhou and threatened him that Chu would be able to replace the house of Zhou. The armies of Chu then conquered a handfull of smaller states like Yong \u5eb8, Shu \u8212 and Chen \u9673, and in 602, King Zhuang was able to destroy the army of Jin \u6649 at Bi \u90b2 (modern Xingyang \u6ece\u967d, Henan). Chu thus came to replace Jin as the hegemonial power of the Central States.\n\nSource:\n\nCang Xiuliang \u5009\u4fee\u826f, ed. (1991).

The fortified city of the feudal lord was often the only area that he controlled directly; the state and the city were therefore identical, both being guo, a combination of city wall and weapons. Satellite cities were established at convenient distances from the main city in order to expand the territory under control. Each feudal state consisted of an alliance of the Zhou, the Shang, and the local population. A Chinese nation was formed on the foundation of Zhou feudalism.\n\nThe scattered feudal states gradually acquired something like territorial solidity as the neighbouring populations established closer ties with them, either by marriage or by accepting vassal status; the gaps between the fortified cities were thus filled by political control and cultural assimilation. This created a dilemma for the Zhou central court: the evolution of the feudal network buttressed the structure of the Zhou order, but the strong local ties and parochial interests of the feudal lords tended to pull them away from the centre. Each of these opposing forces became at one time or another strong enough to affect the history of the Zhou order.\n\nFor about two centuries Zhou China enjoyed stability and peace. There were wars against the non-Zhou peoples of the interior and against the nomads along the northern frontier, but there was little dispute among the Chinese states themselves. The southern expansion was successful, and the northern expansion worked to keep the nomads away from the Chinese areas. The changing strength of the feudal order can be seen from two occurrences at the Zhou court. In 841 bce the nobles jointly expelled Liwang, a tyrant, and replaced him with a collective leadership headed by the two most influential nobles until the crown prince was enthroned. In 771 bce the Zhou royal line was again broken when Youwang was killed by invading barbarians. The nobles apparently were split at that time, because the break gave rise to two courts, headed by two princes, each of whom had the support of part of the nobility. One of the pretenders, Pingwang, survived the other (thus inaugurating the Dong [Eastern] Zhou period), but the royal order had lost prestige and influence. The cohesion of the feudal system had weakened. Thereafter, it entered the phase traditionally known as Chunqiu (Spring and Autumn).\n\nThe familial relationship among the nobles gradually was diluted during the Chunqiu period. A characteristic of the Zhou feudal system was that the extended family and the political structure were identical. The line of lordship was regarded as the line of elder brothers, who therefore enjoyed not only political superiority but also seniority in the family line. The head of the family not only was the political chief but also had the unique privilege of offering sacrifice to and worshipping the ancestors, who would bestow their blessings and guarantee the continuity of the mandate of heaven. After the weakening of the position of the Zhou king in the feudal structure, he was not able to maintain the position of being the head of a large family in any more than a normal sense. The feudal structure and familial ties fell apart, continuing in several of the Chunqiu states for various lengths of time, with various degrees of modification. Over the next two centuries the feudal-familial system gradually declined and disappeared.\n\nIn the first half of the Chunqiu period, the feudal system was a stratified society, divided into ranks as follows: the ruler of a state; the feudal lords who served at the ruler\u2019s court as ministers; the shi (roughly translated as \u201cgentlemen\u201d) who served at the households of the feudal lords as stewards, sheriffs, or simply warriors; and, finally, the commoners and slaves. The state ruler and the ministers were clearly a superior class, and the commoners and slaves were an inferior class; the class of shi was an intermediate one in which the younger sons of the ministers, the sons of shi, and selected commoners all mingled to serve as functionaries and officials. The state rulers were, in theory, divided into five grades; in reality, the importance of a ruler was determined by the strength of his state. The ministerial feudal lords, however, often had two or three grades among themselves, as determined by the lord-vassal relationship. In general, each state was ruled by a group of hereditary feudal lords who might or might not be of the same surname as the state ruler. The system was not stable in the Chunqiu period, and everywhere there were changes.\n\nThe first important change occurred with the advent of interstate leadership. For several decades after 722 bce, the records chiefly show battles and diplomatic maneuvers among the states on the central plain and in the middle and lower reaches of the Huang He valley. These states, however, were too small to hold the leadership and too constricted in the already crowded plain to have potentiality for further development. The leadership was soon taken over by states on the peripheral areas.\n\nThe first to achieve this leadership was Huangong (reigned 685\u2013643 bce), the ruler of the state of Qi on the Shandong Peninsula. He successfully rallied around him many other Chinese states to resist the pressure of non-Chinese powers in the north and south. While formally respecting the suzerainty of the Zhou monarchy, Huangong adopted a new title of \u201coverlord\u201d (ba). He convened interstate meetings, settled disputes among states, and led campaigns to protect his followers from the intimidation of non-Chinese powers.\n\nAfter his death the state of Qi failed to maintain its leading status. The leadership, after a number of years, passed to Wengong of Jin (reigned 636\u2013628 bce), the ruler of the mountainous state north of the Huang He. Under Wengong and his capable successors, the overlordship was institutionalized until it took the place of the Zhou monarchy. Interstate meetings were held at first during emergencies caused by challenges from the rising southern state of Chu. States answering the call of the overlord were expected to contribute and maintain a certain number of war chariots. Gradually the meetings became regular, and the voluntary contribution was transformed into a compulsory tribute to the court of the overlord. The new system of states under the leadership of an overlord developed not only in northern China under Jin but also in the south under Chu. Two other states, Qin and Qi, though not commanding the strength of the formidable Jin and Chu, each absorbed weaker neighbours into a system of satellite states. A balance of power thus emerged among the four states of Qi, Qin, Jin, and Chu. The balance was occasionally tipped when two of them went to war, but it was subsequently restored by the transference of some small states from one camp to another.\n\nA further change began in the 5th century bce, when the states of Wu and Yue far to the south suddenly challenged Chu for hegemony over the southern part of China, at a time when the strong state of Jin was much weakened by an internecine struggle among powerful magnates. Wu got so far as to claim overlordship over northern China in an interstate meeting held in 482 bce after defeating Chu. But Wu\u2019s hegemony was short-lived; it collapsed after being attacked by Yue. Yue held the nominal overlordship for only a brief period; Jin, Qin, and Qi were weakened by internal disturbances (Jin split into three contending powers) and declined; and a series of defeats paralyzed Chu. Thus, the balance-of-power system was rendered unworkable.\n\nA half century of disorder followed. Small states fell prey to big ones, while in the big states usurpers replaced the old rulers. When the chaos ended, there were seven major powers and half a dozen minor ones. Among the seven major powers, Zhao, Han, and Wei had formerly been parts of Jin; the Qi ruling house had changed hands; and Qin was undergoing succession problems. The only \u201cold\u201d state was Chu. Even Chu, a southern state, had become almost completely assimilated to the northern culture (except in art, literature, and folklore). The minor powers had also changed: some had retained only small portions of their old territories, some had new ruling houses, and some were new states that had emerged from non-Chinese tribes. The long interval of power struggle that followed (475\u2013221 bce) is known as the Zhanguo (Warring States) period."}, {"url": "http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/rulers-jin.html", "page_content": "Nov 1, 2018 \u00a9 Ulrich Theobald\n\nDon't confound this regional state of the Zhou period with the Jin dynasty \u6649 (265-420).\n\nJin \u6649 was one of the large regional states of the Zhou period \u5468 (11th cent.-221 BCE). It was located in modern Shanxi. During the Spring and Autumn period \u6625\u79cb (770-5th cent.), Duke Wen \u6649\u6587\u516c (r. 636-628) acheived supremacy over the other regional states and was elected hegemonial lord (ba \u9738).\n\nThree sidebranches of the house of Jin, Han \u97d3, Wei \u9b4f,and Zhao \u8d99, became more powerful and finally divided the territory of Jin among themselves. The official appointment of the lords of these three countries as as marquesses (hou \u4faf) by the king of Zhou in 403 is seen as the beginning of the Warring States period \u6230\u570b (5th cent.-221 BCE), or alternatively their destruction of the noble houses of Fan \u8303, Zhonghang \u4e2d\u884c and Zhi \u77e5 in 454 BCE.\n\nMap 1. The regional state of Jin \u6649 (11th cent. - 376 BCE) Map according to Tan Qixiang \u8c2d\u5176\u9aa7 (1987), Zhongguo lishi ditu ji \u4e2d\u56fd\u5386\u53f2\u5730\u56fe\u96c6. Jin was located in the southern parts of today's Shanxi province. It was one of the strongest state of the Spring and Autumn period, but was then divided among the lords of Han, Wei and Zhao. Click to enlarge.\n\nThe ruling dynasty of Jin was founded by Kang Shu Yu \u5510\u53d4\u865e, a son of King Wu \u5468\u6b66\u738b, founder of the Zhou dynasty, and a brother of King Cheng \u5468\u6210\u738b (r. 1116-1079 BCE). His state of Tang \u5510 had originally been ruled by descendants of the mythological emperor Yao \u582f, yet these rebelled under King Cheng and were executed. The young king thereupon bestowed the territory upon his younger brother Yu \u865e to whom he had promised a state when playing with him. This was the statelet of Yu \u865e.\n\nYu's son Xie Fu \u71ee\u7236 moved the seat of this state southwards to the banks of the River Jin \u6649 (Fen River \u6c7e\u6cb3). Xie Fu was therefore the first to be called \"Marquis of Jin\" \u6649\u4faf. The exact reign dates of the marquesses of Jin are known from the rule of Marquis Jing \u6649\u9756\u4faf (r. 859-841) on.\n\nThe Competition Between Jin and Quwo\n\nMarquis Mu \u6649\u7a46\u4faf (r. 812-785) had two sons, the older of which was called Chou \u4ec7 (literally: revenge), while the younger prince had the name Chengshi \u6210\u5e2b (literally: accomplished army). This was seen as a bad omen for the future of the dynasty. When Marquis Mu died, his younger brother \"Uncle\" Shangshu \u6ba4\u53d4 (r. 785-781) usurped the throne. Shangshu was expelled by the righteous heir, Prince Chou, four years later. Chou is known as Marquis Wen \u6649\u6587\u4faf (r. 781-746). When the Zhou court fled to the east in 700, Marquis Wen escorted King Ping \u5468\u5e73\u738b (r. 770-720 BCE) to Luoyang \u6d1b\u967d (modern Luoyang, Henan) and so ensured the foundation of the Eastern Zhou dynasty \u6771\u5468 (770-221 BCE).\n\nHis successor, Marquis Zhao \u6649\u662d\u4faf (r. 745-740), made his uncle Prince Chengshi governor of the territory of Quwo \u66f2\u6c83 (modern Wenxi \u805e\u559c, Shanxi) that possessed a town greater and richer than the capital seat of the marquis of Jin, which was called Yi \u7ffc. The posthumous title of Prince Chengshi is \"Uncle\" Huan Shu \u6853\u53d4 (r. 745-732). Chengshi's chief advisor was Luan Bin \u6b12\u8cd3, a descendant of Marquis Jing. The Prince of Quwo was very popular, and it was well known at that time that one day his family might challenge the rulers of Jin. In 740 Pan Fu \u6f58\u7236 assassinated Marquis Zhao and invited the Prince of Quwo to mount the throne, yet the retainers of the house of Jin defended the capital against the usurper and enthroned the son of the late marquis, Prince Ping \u5e73, who is posthumously known as Marquis Xiao \u6649\u5b5d\u4faf (r. 740-724).\n\nPrince Chengshi was succeeded by his son Shan \u9c53, who is known as Earl Zhuang of Quwo \u66f2\u6c83\u838a\u4f2f (r. 732-717). Earl Zhuang attempted a second time to usurp the throne of Jin and killed Marquis Xiao, but he had to return to Quwo without success. Marquis Xiao was succeeded by his son Prince Xi \u90c4, who is known as Marquis E \u6649\u9102\u4faf (r. 724-718). His early death instigated Earl Zhuang to a new attempt to occupy the throne of Jin. This time King Ping of Zhou \u5468\u5e73\u738b (r. 770-720 BCE) ordered the duke of Guo \u8662 to defend the institutional order in the state of Jin, and again, Earl Zhuang was forced to withdraw to Quwo. Marquis E was succeeded by his son Prince Guang \u5149, who is known as Marquis Ai \u6649\u54c0\u4faf (r. 718-710). The Earl of Quwo also died and was succeeded by his son Cheng \u7a31, who is posthumously known as Duke Wu of Quwo \u66f2\u6c83\u6b66\u516c (r. 717-677).\n\nIn 710, Earl Wu (the later Duke Wu) attacked Marquis Ai at Fenbang \u6c7e\u65c1 and arrested the ruler of Jin. His son Xiaozi \u5c0f\u5b50 (r. 710-706, this is not actually a personal name, but a term to express that he mounted the throne before his father was dead) was thereupon proclaimed marquis of Jin. Yet shortly later, Earl Wu ordered his uncle Han Wan \u97d3\u842c to kill the captive marquis. Not long thereafter, the powerful earl even went a step further, \"summoned\" Marquis Xiaozi to Quwo and killed him. King Huan of Zhou \u5468\u6853\u738b (r. 720-697) thereupon ordered the duke of Guo once more to punish Earl Wu. The duke's campaign at least forced Earl Wu to enthrone the younger brother of Marquis Ai, Prince Min \u6e63, as ruler of Jin (r. 706-678). He was not granted a posthumous title because he was the last of this family branch and had no heir. In 678, Earl Wu killed him, looted his capital seat and presented the treasury of the marquesses of Jin to King Xi of Zhou \u5468\u91d0\u738b (r. 681-677). The King thereupon granted to Earl Wu the title of duke (gong \u516c) of Jin. Earl (Duke) Wu of Quwo is therefore also known as Duke Wu of Jin \u6649\u6b66\u516c.\n\nThe Way to Hegemony\n\nDuke Wu, the first ruler of the Quwo line in Jin, was succeeded by his son Guizhu \u8a6d\u8af8, who was posthumously called Duke Xian \u6649\u737b\u516c (r. 677-651). In 672, Duke Xian attacked the \"barbarian\" Rong tribes of Li \u9a6a\u620e and captured two Rong princesses that became his favourites. A nobleman of Jin, Shi Wei \u58eb\u848d, warned him that the many princes of Jin might one day threaten his dynasty. Duke Xian thereupon executed all princes of the lateral branches and founded a new capital called Jiang \u7d73 (modern Jicheng \u5180\u57ce, Shanxi). The surviving princes fled to Guo, a smaller state that had already several times challenged the power of Jin.\n\nShi Wei warned the duke that it was still not time to attack Guo. One of the Rong princesses gave birth to a son, Prince Xiqi \u595a\u9f4a, whom Duke Xian wanted to make heir apparent. The other princes were thereupon sent to border towns to take residence there as defenders against the state of Qin \u79e6 in the west. Prince Shensheng \u7533\u751f was sent to Quwo, Prince Chong'er \u91cd\u8033 to Pu \u84b2, and Prince Yiwu \u5937\u543e to Qu \u5c48. Yet matters were more complex than the Duke had hoped. The mother of the former heir apparent, Prince Shensheng, Qi Jiang \u9f4a\u59dc, was a daughter of Duke Huan of Qi \u9f4a\u6853\u516c (r. 685-643), and his sister was a secondary wife of Duke Mu of Qin \u79e6\u7a46\u516c (r. 660-621). The mothers of the princes Chong'er and Yiwu were sister princesses from the Hu \u72d0 family of the wild Di tribes \u7fdf.\n\nIn 661 Duke Xian conquered the states of Huo \u970d, Wei \u9b4f, and Geng \u803f that had belonged to side branches of the ruling dynasty of Jin. He confirmed Prince Shengcheng as lord of Quwo and granted the territory of Geng to Zhao Su \u8d99\u5919 and the territory of Wei to Bi Wan \u7562\u842c. Both Shi Wei and Bu Yan \u535c\u5043 warned the duke to bestow such honours upon them because these positions might enable them to challenge the rule of the lords of Jin one day. Duke Xian also entrusted his heir apparent with the supreme command of the campaign against the Red Di tribes \u8d64\u72c4 of Dongshan \u6771\u5c71, which was not appropriate according to traditional customs, as Li Ke \u91cc\u514b explained to the duke. Shortly later, the duke for the first time attacked the state of Guo. In 655, the army of Jin conquered Guo, and then the small state of Yu \u865e.\n\nWhen Duke Xian planned to nominate Prince Xiqi heir apparent, his mother secretly intrigued against the actual heir apparent, Prince Shensheng, and machinated that he offered poisoned meat to his father, the Duke. The Duke knew of these machinations and offered his son to flee to another country, but Prince Shensheng refused and committed suicide. Prince Chong'er and Prince Wuyi thereupon fled to their territories and fortified them. Prince Chong'er was not able to defend his town because his retainers were not loyal, and fled to the Di tribes, where his mother came from. Shortly after, Qu fell and Prince Wuyi also escaped to the Di tribes, yet he was urged to flee to Liang \u6881, a town in the vicinity of the state of Qin that Duke Xian of Jin would surely not dare to attack. When Jin attacked the Di tribes, they successfully defended themselves in the battle of Niesang \u9f67\u6851.\n\nPrince Xiqi was now the heir apparent. He had a younger brother called Daozi \u60bc\u5b50. Both were still young, and so Duke Xian entrusted them to his counsellor Xun Xi \u8340\u606f. When the Duke died, Li Ke and Pei Zheng \u90b3\u912d suggested inviting Prince Chong'er to mount the throne, but Xun Xi refused because he had made a promise to the late duke to enthrone Prince Xiqi. Li Ke thereupon killed Prince Xiqi. Xun Xi enthroned Prince Daozi in order to correctly perform the burial of Duke Xian. When the funeral was over, Li Ke also killed Daozi and sent for Prince Chong'er, but Chong'er refused because the burial of his father had not been performed in a regular way.\n\nHis brother Prince Wuyi was willing to become the next duke, but he was advised by L\u00fc Sheng \u5442\u7701 and Xi Rui \u90e4\u82ae to seek the protection of Duke Mu of Qin and to offer him the territory of Hexi \u6cb3\u897f. At the same time, the hegemonial lord Duke Huan of Qi arrived in Jin to restore order. Prince Wuyi is known as Duke Hui of Jin \u6649\u60e0\u516c (r. 651-637). Once on the throne, Duke Hui refused to cede the territory of Hexi, refused to appoint Li Ke governor of Fenyang \u6c7e\u967d, as promised, and finally ordered him to commit suicide, fearing that Li Ke might support his older brother Prince Chong'er who still was in exile. Pei Zheng, who had ben sent to Qin, conspired with Duke Mu of Qin and explained to him that the nobles L\u00fc Sheng, Xi Cheng \u90e4\u7a31 and Xi Rui would support Prince Chong'er.\n\nWhen Jin was affected by a draught, the duke of Qin willingly sent grain, yet a year later, when Qin needed grain, Duke Hui of Jin refused to send relief. Qin therefore attacked Jin and defeated it at Hanyuan \u97d3\u539f. Duke Hui was captured but soon released because his sister was a wife of Duke Mu of Qin. Back in Jin, Duke Hui suspected his ministers of conspiring with Prince Chong'er, and ordered to kill him, yet his brother heard of the plot, left the Di tribes an escaped to Qi in the far east. The son of Duke Hui, Prince Yu \u5709, was sent to Qin as a hostage. When his father fell ill, the Prince left Qin and returned to Jin, where he was enthroned as Duke Huai \u6649\u61f7\u516c (r. 637).\n\nThe Duke of Qin was very discontented with this succession and supported an internal rebellion by the lords of Luan \u6b12 and Xi \u90e4 who killed Duke Huai and invited Prince Chong'er to return to Jin. He was enthroned and is known as Duke Wen of Jin \u6649\u6587\u516c (r. 637-628). Prince Chong'er had lived for almost twenty years in exile, first among the Di tribes, where his mother came from, and then in Qin. He was married to a princess of the Red Di tribes of Jiuru \u548e\u5982 and had two sons, Prince Boshu \u4f2f\u9bc8 and prince Shuliu \u53d4\u5289. Chong'er had many competent retainers, the \"five worthies\", wuxian \u4e94\u8ce2, namely Zhao Shuai \u8d99\u8870 (Zhao Chengzi \u8d99\u6210\u5b50), Hu Yan \u72d0\u5043, Jia Tuo \u8cc8\u4f57, Xian Zhen \u5148\u8eeb and Wei Chou \u9b4f\u72a8 (Viscount Wu of Wei \u9b4f\u6b66\u5b50).\n\nPrince Chong'er haid paid visit to virtually all of the larger regional states of the time and therefore knew their problems and strengths. At the beginning of his reign, Duke Wen was in need of a protective force of 3,000 guards from Qin, before the could master the situation and stabilize his throne. He rewarded all those that had supported him in the past. When King Xiang of Zhou \u5468\u8944\u738b (r. 652-619) was forced into exile by his usurpatorious brother Prince Dai \u5e36, Duke Wen of Jin was able to bring the king back to the royal capital Luoyang.\n\nWhen several regional states besieged the state of Song \u5b8b, this small state asked Jin for support. Duke Wen assembled three divisions that attacked the states of Wei \u885b and Cao \u66f9, so that the king of Chu \u695a, their mighty protector, withdrew his forces from the siege of Song. Duke Wen was also able to establish alliances (meng \u76df) with Qi and Zheng \u912d and in 632 defeated in the battle of Chengpu \u57ce\u6fee the army of Chu which were commanded by general Ziyu \u5b50\u7389. The king of Zhou also bestowed the title of hegemonial lord (bo \u4f2f, i.e. ba) upon Duke Wen, and all regional rulers (zhuhou \u8af8\u4faf) swore allegiance to him. He assembled the regional rulers at Wen \u6eab, and later at Jiantu \u8e10\u571f, to pay homage to King Xiang of Zhou. In 630, Jin and Qin attacked Zheng for its support of the state of Chu.\n\nWhen Duke Wen died he was succeeded by his son Prince Guan \u8b99, known as Duke Xiang \u6649\u8944\u516c (r. 628-621). Under his rule the relation to Qin worsened, and Jin defeated Qin in the battle of Yao \u6bbd. Three generals of Qin were captured. Three years later, Qin attacked Jin to take revenge, and in 623 Jin attacked Qin again. When Duke Xiang died, a succession crisis erupted because the heir apparent Prince Yigao \u5937\u768b was still a child. It was deliberated whether Duke Xiang's brother Prince Yong \u96cd or Prince Le \u6a02, another brother, should be enthroned, yet in the end Prince Yigao remained the legitmate ruler, known as Duke Ling \u6649\u9748\u516c (r. 621-607). He was defended by general Zhao Dun \u8d99\u76fe (Zhao Xuanzi \u8d99\u5ba3\u5b50) who resisted the army of Qin that had been called to support the enthronement of Prince Yong.\n\nZhao Dun defeated Qin at Linghu \u4ee4\u72d0. He was also sent to the royal capital where after the death of King Qing \u5468\u9803\u738b (r. 619-611) the royal princes contended for power. He enforced the enthronement of King Kuang \u5468\u5321\u738b (r. 613-607). When Duke Ling was grown up he proved to be a choleric ruler who killed his counsellor, and, when they remonstrated against the murder, ordered to kill Zhao Dun and Sui Hui \u96a8\u6703. Zhao Dun planned to flee but his brother Zhao Chuan \u8d99\u7a7f killed Duke Ling. The brothers managed the enthronement of Prince Heitun \u9ed1\u81c0, a younger brother of Duke Xiang. He is known as Duke Cheng \u6649\u6210\u516c (r. 607-600).\n\nThe Takeover by the Six Ministers-Commander (Han, Wei, Zhao, Zhi, Fan, Zhonghang)\n\nIn 600, Jin sent out Viscount Huan of Zhonghang \u4e2d\u884c\u6853\u5b50 (Xun Linfu \u8340\u6797\u7236) in order to punish the state of Chen \u9673 that had, in fear for the mighty state of Chu in the south, refused to meet with the regional rulers at Hu \u6248. Duke Cheng was succeeded by his son Prince Ju \u64da (or Nou \u7373), who is known as Duke Jing \u6649\u666f\u516c (r. 600-581). In 597, Chu attacked the state of Zheng. The army of Jin, under the command of Xu Linfu, challenged Chu and was heavily defeated. Xu Linfu offered to the duke his life as a punishment for his failure, yet Sui Hui argued that the execution of a general would only profit the king of Chu, and not the state of Jin. Duke Jing also considered attacking the state of Qi because his diplomat Xi Ke \u90e4\u514b had been insulted by the Duchess Dowager of Qi.\n\nA nobleman of Chu, Wu Chen \u5deb\u81e3, fled to Jin, and was appointed grand master (dafu \u5927\u592b) of Xing \u90a2. In 588, Duke Jing founded the six military divisions that were commanded by six ministers-commander (qing \u537f, the liu qing \u516d\u537f), who were Han Jue \u97d3\u53a5 (Han Xianzi \u97d3\u737b\u5b50), Gong Shuo \u978f\u6714, Zhao Chuan \u8d99\u7a7f, Xun Jia (Zhui) \u8340\u9a05, Zhao Kuo \u8d99\u62ec and Zhao Dan \u8d99\u65c3. Five years later, Zhao Tong \u8d99\u540c and Zhao Kuo were executed. Han Jue lamented that the duke had forgotten the service that Zhao Shuai and Zhao Zhi had delivered to the dynasty and urged Duke Jing to appoint Viscount Wu of Zhao \u8d99\u5b50\u6b66 as head of the house of Zhao.\n\nTwo years later, Duke Jing died. He was succeeded by his son Prince Shouman \u58fd\u66fc, who is known as Duke Li \u6649\u53b2\u516c (r. 581-573). During his rule the regional rulers unfied in an alliance and attacked and defeated Qin. The \"Three lords of Xi\" (San Xi \u4e09\u90e4: Xi Qi \u90e4\u9321, Xi Chou \u90e4\u72a8 and Xi Zhi \u90e4\u81f3) killed Bo Zong \u4f2f\u5b97, a loyal and straightforwardly speaking minister of the duke. Duke Li personally commanded the expedition against the state of Zheng that sided with Chu. The army of Chu was defeated at Yanling \u9122\u9675, and King Gong of Chu \u695a\u5171\u738b (r. 591-560) suffered a wound. Duke Li at that moment seemed to have revived the former hegemony of Jin over the other regional states.\n\nDuke Li wanted to get rid of the house of Xi and sent out Luan Shu \u6b12\u66f8 and Xun Yan \u8340\u5043 to have the lords of Xi executed, but Luan Shu intrigued against the Duke and his minion Xu Tong \u80e5\u7ae5, arrested the Duke and killed Xu Tong. The Duke died a few days later. Prince Zhou \u5468 (or Jiu \u7cfe), a son of Duke Xiang, was enthroned. He is known as Duke Dao \u6649\u60bc\u516c (r. 573-558).\n\nDuke Dao assembled the regional rulers at Jize \u96de\u6fa4. He made use of a handful of competent advisors that supported him to retain the ancient power of the state of Jin. Among these supporters was Wei Jiang \u9b4f\u7d73. The chronicles also say that Shi Kuang \u5e2b\u66e0 suggested to him to exert a rule of benevolence and righteousness. It is not known if this is the same person to whom authorship of a book on birds (the Qinjing \u79bd\u7d93) is attributed. The six ministers-commander led the joint armies of the regional rulers to attack the state of Qin and defeated it.\n\nDuke Dao was succeeded by his son Prince Biao \u5f6a, who is known as Duke Ping \u6649\u5e73\u516c (r. 558-532). Duke Ping attacked Qi, defeated its troops and was even able to besiege the capital of Qi, Linzi \u81e8\u83d1. Qi took revenge a few years later, and Luan Cheng \u6b12\u901e, instigated by Qi, attacked Quwo. Viscount Xian of Fan \u8303\u737b\u5b50 pursued the Duke not to commit suicide, as he planned. The Viscount was right, because Luan Cheng was defeated soon, and the Duke could extinguish the noble house of Luan.\n\nA few years later, Duke Zhuang of Qi \u9f4a\u838a\u516c (r. 554-548) was killed. Duke Ping used this chance to crush the troops of Qi at Gaotang \u9ad8\u5510. The state of Qi was so threatened that even nine years later Yan Ying \u664f\u5b30 was sent out to confirm the state of peace with Jin. He was convinced that the house of Jin would remain a hegemonial power for longer, yet another visitor to Jin, Yanling Jizi \u5ef6\u9675\u5b63\u5b50 of the state of Wu \u5433 already perceived that the power in Jin would once be transferred to the lords of Zhao, Wei and Han.\n\nDuke Ping was succeeded by his son Prince Yi \u5937, who is known as Duke Zhao \u6649\u662d\u516c (r. 532-526), the latter by Prince Qubing \u53bb\u75c5, known as Duke Qing \u6649\u9803\u516c (r. 526-512). The six ministers-commander had meanwhile become so strong that they took over the duties of a hegemonial lord and pacified the disturbances in the royal house of Zhou after the death of King Jing \u5468\u666f\u738b (r. 545-521) by bringing King Jing \u5468\u656c\u738b (r. 520-476) to the throne. Viscount Xian of Fan was also asked to regulate political matters in the state of Lu \u9b6f, where Viscount Ping of Ji \u5b63\u5e73\u5b50 was ruling for Duke Zhao \u9b6f\u662d\u516c (r. 542-510). The six ministers-commander also eliminated the house of Qi Xi \u7941\u5092 whose members had served several dukes as chief counsellors.\n\nDuke Qing was succeeded by his son Prince Wu \u5348, who is known as Duke Ding \u6649\u5b9a\u516c (r. 512-475). During the long reign of Duke Ding, the houses of the six ministers-commander continued contending for power. Zhao Yang \u8d99\u9785, also called Viscount Jian of Zhao \u8d99\u7c21\u5b50, fought with Xun Yin \u8340\u5bc5 (a grandson of Xu Yan \u8340\u5043) and Fan Jiyi (sic) \u8303\u5409\u5c04 (Fan Zhaozi \u8303\u662d\u5b50), who had the Duke on their side, but Zhao Yang was supported by Xun Li \u8340\u6adf (Zhi Wenzi \u667a\u6587\u5b50), Han Buxin \u97d3\u4e0d\u4fe1 (Han Jianzi \u97d3\u7c21\u5b50) and Wei Chi \u9b4f\u4f88 (Wei Xiangzi \u9b4f\u8944\u5b50). The Duke was finally convinced by the latter that the lords of Zhonghang and Fan planned a rebellion, so that the Duke ordered to fight them. The two lords escaped to the state of Qi, and their territory was divided among the victorious viscounts of Zhao, Wei, Han and Zhi \u667a (or \u77e5). Duke Ding was still so powerful that he dared to contend for hegemony with King Fucha \u592b\u5dee of Wu at the meeting of Huangchi \u9ec3\u6c60, yet King Fucha prevailed.\n\nThe Three Ministers Commander (Han, Wei, Zhao) Destroy the House of Jin\n\nDuke Ding was succeeded by his son Prince Zao \u947f, who is known as Duke Chu \u6649\u51fa\u516c (r. 475-457). Under his reign the lords of Zhi \u77e5, Han \u97d3, Wei \u9b4f and Zhao \u8d99 attacked the lords of Fan \u8303 and Zhonghang \u4e2d\u884c. In order to put down the internal rebellion Duke Chu appealed to the duke of Qi for help, yet the four lords on their side advanced their troops against Duke Chu. The duke escaped and died on his way to Qi. Zhi Bo \u77e5\u4f2f (Xun Yao \u8340\u7464) enthroned Prince Jiao \u9a55, a great-grandson of Duke Zhao. He is known as Duke Ai \u6649\u54c0\u516c (r. 457-438). His counsellor-in-chief was the Lord of Zhi. As the most powerful person in the dukedom, he was assassinated by the viscounts Xiang of Zhao \u8d99\u8944\u5b50, Kang of Han \u97d3\u5eb7\u5b50, and Huan of Wei \u9b4f\u6853\u5b50, and these three families remained the from then on the most powerful families in Jin. This happened in 453, a date that can be seen as the beginning of the Warring States period \u6230\u570b (5th cent.-221 BCE).\n\nDuke Ai was succeeded by his son Prince Liu \u67f3, who is known as Duke You \u6649\u5e7d\u516c (r. 438-420). Duke You summoned the nobles of Jin to his court, but only the lords of Jiang \u7d73 and Quwo \u66f2\u6c83 paid hommage to him, while the others swore loyalty to the Wei, Han or Zhao. Duke You is said to have been killed by bandits when he was seeking amorous adventures outside the capital. Marquis Wen of Wei \u9b4f\u6587\u4faf put down the disturbances and enthroned the duke's son (or brother) Prince Zhi \u6b62, who is known as Duke Lie \u6649\u70c8\u516c (r. 420-393). In 403, the King Weilie of Zhou \u5468\u5a01\u70c8\u738b (r. 426-402) bestowed upon the lords of Wei, Han and Zhao the title of marquis (hou \u4faf). Duke Lie was succeeded by his son Prince Qi \u980e (or Qing \u50be), who is known as Duke Xiao \u6649\u5b5d\u516c (r. 393-378). Duke Xiao's son Prince Jujiu \u4ff1\u9152 is known as Duke Jing \u6649\u975c\u516c (r. 378-376). In 376, the marquesses Wu of Wei \u9b4f\u6b66\u4faf (r. 387-371), Ai of Han \u97d3\u54c0\u4faf (r. 377-371), and Jing of Zhao \u8d99\u656c\u4faf (r. 387-375) extinguished the last princes of the house of Jin and divided the territory of Jin into three parts. They are therefore also known as the \"Three lords of Jin\" (San Jin \u4e09\u6649). The Duke himself was demoted to the status of commoner.\n\nThe name of the state of Jin served as the name of numerous princedoms and was used by the Jin Dynasty \u6649 (265-420) and the Later Jin \u5f8c\u6649 (936-946) of the Five Dynasties \u4e94\u4ee3 (907-960).\n\nTable 1.

of the Zhou period \u5468 (11th cent.-221 BCE). It belonged to the larger polities that were able to survive until the end of the Warring States period \u6230\u570b (5th cent.-221 BCE). Chu is known for its culture that was significantly different from that of the states of the Central Plain. Chu was not among the states that were distributed as a regional states at the beginning of the Western Zhou period \u897f\u5468 (11th cent.-770 BCE). Its ruling dynasty was of a different origin than most of the regional dynasties of the Zhou empire. Another name of Chu is Jing \u834a. Chu was first located in the valley of the River Han \u6f22 and then moved southeast into the Yangtze Valley. During the Spring and Autumn period \u6625\u79cb (770 - 5th cent. BCE) it gradually expanded towards the north and east.\n\nMap 1.

It played the role of temporary ally for the states of Qi and Qin, before the latter dominated over all regional states and founded the empire of Qin.

Zhuan Xu's great-grandson Zhong Li \u91cd\u9ece was the minister for fire (huo zheng \u706b\u6b63) of the mythical Emperor Di Ku \u5e1d\u56b3. For his merits earned in office, Zhong Li was bestowed the name of Zhu Rong \u795d\u878d. He was sent out to punish the rebellious lord of the waters, Gong Gong \u5171\u5de5, but Zhu Rong/Zhong Li was unable to kill Gong Gong. Enraged about this failure, Emperor Di Ku executed Zhong Li and had his brother Wu Hui \u5433\u56de take over the duties as minister of fire. Wu Hui had six grandsons that were called Kun Wu \u6606\u543e, Shen Hu \u53c3\u80e1, Peng Zu \u5f6d\u7956, Hui Ren \u6703\u4eba, Ji Lian \u5b63\u9023 and an unnamed son that was given the family name of Cao \u66f9. Five branches of the family fell into oblivion, except the descendants of Ji Lian who adopted the family name of Xiong \u718a or Mi \u7f8b (originally written \u5b2d).\n\nExcavated objects from the late Warring States period prove that the reigning dynasty of Chu also bore the family name Yan \u9153. Mi Xiong allegedly took part in King Wu's \u5468\u6b66\u738b conquest of the Shang empire \u5546 (17th-11th cent. BCE).\n\nIn the early decades of the Zhou period, King Cheng of Zhou \u5468\u6210\u738b (r. 1116-1079 BCE) made the family Mi regional rulers over the country of Chu in the middle Yangtze valley. From that time on they adopted the family name Mi, yet the rulers retained the surname Xiong. Xiong might also be a prefix of the personal name worn by all members of the family. In the late 11th century King Zhao of Zhou \u5468\u662d\u738b undertook several military campaigns against Chu during one of which he died, while his own army drowned in the River Han. The rulers of Chu called themselves \"king\" (wang \u738b) and therefore demonstrated that they were actually not part of the system of regional states of the Zhou empire.\n\nYu Xiong's great-grandson Xiong Yi \u718a\u7e79 settled near Mt. Jingshan \u834a\u5c71 (modern Nanzhang \u5357\u6f33, Hubei) and, after being appointed regional ruler (zhuhou \u8af8\u4faf) by King Cheng of Zhou, moved to Danyang \u4e39\u967d (modern Zigui \u79ed\u6b78, Hubei).\n\nViscount (zi \u5b50) Xiong Qu \u718a\u6e20 became aware that the house of Zhou was weakening and expanded his rule along the middle Yangtze valley up into the valley of River Han. He conquered the statelets of Yong \u5eb8 and Yangyue \u63da\u7cb5. He made his oldest song Wukang \u6bcb\u5eb7 king of Goutan \u53e5\u4eb6, his second son Zhihong \u646f\u7d05 king of E \u9102, and his youngest son Zhici \u57f7\u75b5 king of Yuezhang \u8d8a\u7ae0. Later on he feared that the king of Zhou would attack him because of the usurpation of the title of king and stripped his sons off their ranks as kings.\n\nAfter the death of Viscount Xiong Shuang \u718a\u971c his three sons indeed contended for the throne of Chu. The youngest son, Jixun \u5b63\u5f87 (Xiong Xun \u718a\u5f87), was finally able to occupy the throne. When Fen Mao \u86a1\u5192 (r. 758-741), also called Xiong Xun \u718a\u7734, died, his younger brother Xiong Tong \u718a\u901a assassinated the heir apparent and usurped the throne. He is posthumously called King Wu of Chu \u695a\u6b66\u738b (r. 741-690) because he carried out numerous military campaigns, like that against the statelet of Sui \u96a8, whose marquis, hoping to escape defeat, offered to Xiong Tong to travel to the court of the King of Zhou to reconfirm Xiong Tong in his royal position, but the King of Zhou declined. Enraged about the King of Zhou's refusal, Xiong Tong decided to adopt the title of king without the permission by the Son of Heaven, concluded an alliance with the marquis of Sui and occupied the territory of the hundred Pu tribes \u767e\u6fee south of the Yangtze River. Xiong Tong later suspected the marquis of Sui of treason and planned to occupy his territory, but he died en route to the battlefield.\n\nHis son Xiong Zi \u718a\u8cb2 mounted the throne. Zi is posthumously known as King Wen \u695a\u6587\u738b (r. 690-677). He was the first ruler of Chu who took residence in Ying \u90e2 (near modern Shashi \u6c99\u5e02, Hubei) instead of Danyang. Xiong Zi conquered several small states, like Xi \u606f (modern Xixian \u606f\u7e23\uff0c Henan), Shen \u7533 (modern Nanyang \u5357\u967d, Henan) and Deng \u9127 (modern Xiangfan \u8944\u6a0a, Hubei). His son Zhuang'ao \u838a\u6556 (ao was a kind of temple name, like the Chinese zong \u5b97), known as Xiong Jian \u718a\u56cf (also written \u718a\u8271), planned to kill his brother Xiong Yun \u718a\u60f2 (also written \u718a\u9835), but the latter escaped to Sui and gained sufficient support to usurp the throne of his brother. Xiong Yun is posthumously known as King Cheng \u695a\u6210\u738b (r. 672-626). Unlike his predecessors, King Cheng was a peaceful ruler who sent appropriate tributes to the court of the king of Zhou, so that he was ordered to appease the barbarian tribes of the south instead of harassing the states in the Yellow River plain.\n\nIn 656 the hegemonial lord (ba \u9738) Duke Huan of Qi \u9f4a\u6853\u516c (r. 685-643) attacked Chu, but King Cheng was able to urge his troops to stop and concluded a peace alliance (meng \u76df) in the conference of Zhaoling \u53ec\u9675 (modern Yancheng \u90fe\u57ce, Henan). In his later years King Cheng waged war against the statelets of Xu \u8a31, Xian \u5f26 (near modern Xixian, Henan), Huang \u9ec3 (modern Huanchuan \u6f62\u5ddd, Henan) and Ying \u82f1. Duke Xiang of Song \u5b8b\u8944\u516c (r. 650-637), the new hegemonial lord, dispatched an envoy to Chu to offer a peaceful alliance, but the king refused and soon attacked Song \u5b8b and defeated the duke in the battle of Hong \u6cd3 (modern Zhecheng \u67d8\u57ce, Henan) and also the state of Zheng \u912d. Duke Xiang died from a wound received during the battle.\n\nIn 634 Duke Xi of Lu \u9b6f\u50d6\u516c (r. 659-627) arrived at the court of Chu and requested an army to punish the Duke of Qi \u9f4a. King Cheng sent out the Marquis of Shen \u7533 who conquered the territory of Gu \u7a40, where Duke Huan's son Yong \u96cd was instated as the local governor. The other sons of the Duke of Qi fled to Chu and were all made nobles in Chu. The statelet of Kui \u5914 was conquered, and then King Cheng attacked the state of Song. The Duke of Song requested support by the army of Jin \u6649. King Cheng thereupon withdrew because Duke Wen of Jin \u6649\u6587\u516c (r. 636-628), had been his exiled guest for a long time, and sent only out Ziyu \u5b50\u7389 with a small contingent that was defeated.\n\nAgainst the advice of Prime Minister (lingyin \u4ee4\u5c39) Zishang \u5b50\u4e0a, King Chen nominated his beloved son Shangchen \u5546\u81e3 heir apparent. Later on he deposed Shangchen in favour to Zhi \u8077. Shangchen thereupon arrested King Cheng and forced him to commit suicide. He mounted the throne, posthumously called King Mu \u695a\u7a46\u738b (r. 626-614). His chief counsellor was Pan Chong \u6f58\u5d07. King Mu conquered the statelets of Jiang \u6c5f (modern Xixian, Henan) and Lu \u516d (a special reading, modern Lu'an \u516d\u5b89, Anhui) and attacked the state of Chen \u9673.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son L\u00fc \u4fb6, who is posthumously known as King Zhuang \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 614-591). King Zhuang did not attend the court, indulged in pleasures and even ordered to execute those who dared remonstrating against him. Wu Ju \u4f0d\u8209 thereupon used a riddle to admonish him, but without success. Only Su Cong \u8607\u5f9e was able to open the king's eyes so that he started caring for political matters again. During his campaign against the Rong barbarians \u620e of Luhun \u9678\u6e3e, King Zhuang visited the capital of the kings of Zhou in Luoyang \u6d1b\u967d (modern Luoyang, Henan) and was received by royal grandson Man \u738b\u5b6b\u6eff. The latter convinced him that the Heavenly Mandate (tianming \u5929\u547d) of the Zhou dynasty had not yet ended, in spite of the obvious weakness of the royal house.\n\nIn 597 Chu defeated the army of Jin near Bi \u90b2 (near modern Zhengzhou \u912d\u5dde, Henan). In 594 Chu besieged the capital of Song for five months and conquered the statelet of Yong \u5eb8 (near modern Zhushan \u7af9\u5c71, Hubei), later Shu-Liao \u8212\u84fc (modern Shucheng \u8212\u57ce, Anhui) and Xiao \u856d (near modern Xuzhou \u5f90\u5dde, Jiangsu).\n\nAfter the conquest of Chen, King Zhuang wanted to transform it into a district of Chu, but Shen Shu \u7533\u53d4 of Qi criticized the king, so that he reinstated the house of Chen. Yet his next step was to conquer the state of Zheng. After the lord of Zheng had begged for mercy, King Zhuang released him and created an alliance of peace. In 575 the army of Chu defeated the relieve army from Jin in the battle of Yanling \u9122\u9675 (modern Yanling, Henan). The rule of King Zhuang is seen as the apogee of the power of the state of Chu among the regional states of the Zhou period. He was accepted as hegemonial lord (ba \u9738).\n\nKing Zhuang was succeeded by his son Shen \u5be9, posthumously known as King Gong \u695a\u5171\u738b (r. 591-560). During his reign the army of Chu was defeated by Jin. The next ruler was King Gong's son Zhao \u62db, posthumously known as King Kang \u695a\u5eb7\u738b (r. 560-545). The latter was succeeded by his son Yuan \u54e1, who is also known as Jia'ao \u90df\u6556 (r. 545-541). King Kang had four younger brothers called Wei \u570d, Zibi \u5b50\u6bd4, Zixi \u5b50\u6673 and Qiji \u5f03\u75be. Wei was made Prime Minister and commander of the army. When Jia'ao fell ill, Wei entered the palace, strangulated the king and killed his sons Mo \u83ab and Pingxia \u5e73\u590f. Zibi fled to Jin, while Wei mounted the throne. He is posthumously known as King Ling \u695a\u9748\u738b (r. 541-529).\n\nChu as a major power of the Warring States\n\nKing Ling was able to assemble the regional rulers and to take over the lead as a factual hegemon of the regional states. Minister Wu Ju warned the king to become over-confident in his superior role, yet King Ling commanded the regional states in a campaign against the state of Wu \u5433. Qing Feng \u6176\u5c01, the commander of the troops of Wu, was kept prisoner, but dared criticizing King Ling for the way his fathers had come to the throne of Chu, and was therefore immediately executed by the king. He had the Zhanghua Terrace \u7ae0\u83ef\u81fa built where he received noble refugees from other states. Prince Qiji was ordered to attack the state of Chen, and King Ling invited the marquis of Cai \u8521 in order to poison him. Prince Qiji conquered the headless state of Cai and usurped the throne of the small marquisate.\n\nIn 530 BCE, King Ling attacked the small state of Xu \u5f90, located northwest of the state of Wu, and Lai \u8cf4 (modern Suizhou \u96a8\u5dde, Hubei). Chen was heavily deafeated and its dynasty brought to an end. At that moment, King Ling deliberated with his nobles whether he was strong enough to claim the same rights as the other regional rulers. Grand master (dafu \u5927\u592b) Xi Fu \u6790\u7236 answered that in old times, the state of Chu had been a very remote and less developed country, but now the King of Zhou would not refuse to bestow to the King of Chu bronze tripods as a symbol of royal power, and none of the other states would refuse to exchange gifts with the state of Chu.\n\nWhen King Ling was on campaign against Wu in the camp of Ganxi \u4e7e\u6eaa, the king of Wu was advised by Guan Cong \u89c0\u5f9e, a son of a noble of Cai whom King Ling had killed. The King of Wu joined a secret alliance with the state of Yue \u8d8a, whose nobleman Chang Shouguo \u5e38\u58fd\u904e had also been insulted by the king of Chu. Wu and Yue attacked Cai and won over Qiji, who was able to kill the heir apparent of Chu, Prince Lu \u797f. Zibi was enthroned as king of Chu, Zixi was made Prime Minister, and Qiji Minister of War (sima \u53f8\u99ac). Guan Cong thereupon travelled to the camp of King Ling and presented him with the facts of the rebellion at home. The army of Chu dispersed and left the king alone. King Ling wandered around in the wilderness and finally died of hunger because the new ruler had forbidden giving him anything to eat.\n\nThe new king, Zibi, was for a long time in an unclear state about the whereabouts of King Ling, and finally committed suicide, together with Zixi. Qiji renamed himself Xiong Ju \u718a\u5c45 and proclaimed himself king of Chu. He is posthumously known as King Ping \u695a\u5e73\u738b (r. 527-516).\n\nIn fear of revenge, King Ping demonstrated a benevolent government towards the common people and restored the territories of the states of Chen and Cai, enthroning members of the former ruling houses. The eastern parts of Chu were plundered by the armies of Wu during this interlude of internal war in Chu.\n\nKing Ping decided to marry his son, Crown Prince Jian \u5efa, with a princess from Qin \u79e6. Yet the girl was so beautiful that the king decided to take her for himself, and she gave birth to Prince Zhen \u8eeb. Grand Tutor (taifu \u592a\u5085) Wu She \u4f0d\u5962 and Junior Tutor (shaofu \u5c11\u5085) Fei Wuji \u8cbb\u7121\u5fcc intrigued against each other and instigated in the king the fear that the crown prince might prematurely usurp the throne. Prince Jian thereupon fled to the court of Song. Wu She's son Wu Zixu \u4f0d\u5b50\u80e5, who was an excellent strategist, was able to escape to the state of Wu, the arch-enemy of Chu.\n\nThe mother of Prince Jian was captured by the army of Wu when Prince Guang \u5149 of Wu was campaigning against Chen and Cai. A small border clash in Beiliang \u5351\u6881 lead to an armed conflict between Chu and Wu, in which Wu conquered the territories of Zhongli \u9418\u96e2 and Juchao \u5c45\u5de2. King Ping was so threatened that he began fortifying the capital city Ying. When King Ping died, the nobles wanted to enthrone his younger brother Prince Zixi \u5b50\u897f, but he refused, so that the under-age prince Zhen was enthroned as ruler of Chu. He is posthumously known as King Zhao \u695a\u662d\u738b (r. 516-489).\n\nAt the beginning of his reign, Prime Minister Zichang \u5b50\u5e38 took revenge for Prince Jian and Wu She and killed the intriguer Fei Wuji. The reason for this was that a many nobles had fled to Wu, where they supported the troops of Chu against the own dynasty in Chu. Yet there were also some princes of Wu escaping trouble in the own country at the court of Chu.\n\nIn 509 BCE the army of Chu, commanded by Prince Zichang, was heavily defeated by Wu in the battle of Baiju \u67cf\u8209 (modern Macheng \u9ebb\u57ce, Hubei). Wu Zixu as one of the competent military leaders of Wu even managed to conquer the capital of Chu in 506. As a revenge for the execution of his father, Wu Zixu had the tomb of King Ping desecrated. Commander Prince Zichang fled to the state of Zheng. King Zhao himself escaped to Yunmeng \u96f2\u5922 and then on to the former state of Sui, where he was hidden by his loyal courtiers and the population from the army of Wu.\n\nIn the meantime, minister Shen Baoxu \u7533\u9b91\u80e5 was sent to the state of Qin to ask for relief troops, which were indeed able to defeat the troops of Wu that had advanced far into the country of the enemy until they reached Ji \u7a37 (modern Tongbai \u6850\u67cf, Henan). Prince Fugai \u592b\u6982, brother of the king of Wu, usurped the throne on this occasion but was driven out by the righteous king and fled to the court of Chu.\n\nStill on his way back to the capital, King Zhao of Chu swallowed the state of Tang \u5510 (near modern Suizhou, Hubei), then Dun \u9813 (modern Shangshui \u5546\u6c34, Henan) and Hu \u80e1 (modern Fuyang \u961c\u967d, Anhui). There was another occasion in 504 when the army of Wu again invaded the state of Chu. Only with the death of King Hel\u00fc \u95d4\u95ad of Wu (r. 514-496) the attention of Wu was directed against the state of Yue, and the danger from the east was gone.\n\nOn his sickbed, King Zhao wanted to cede the throne to his younger brother, yet all nobles refused, before Prince Zil\u00fc \u5b50\u95ad conceded to become the successor of his brother. Yet when the King died on a campaign, the brothers decided to enthrone the king's son, Prince Zhang \u7ae0. He is posthumously known as King Hui \u695a\u60e0\u738b (r. 489-432). In 488 Prince Zixi invited the former Prince Jian's son Prince Sheng \u52dd to come back to Chu. He was granted the title of Duke Bai \u767d\u516c. Duke Bai planned to revenge his father's death, who had been killed in exile in Zheng.\n\nIn 481 BCE, the army of Jin attacked Zheng, and Zheng asked Chu for help. Instead of annihilating Zheng, commander Zixi left Zheng untouched. Duke Bai thereupon killed Zixi, Prince Ziqi \u5b50\u7da6 and Prime Minister Sima Ziqi \u53f8\u99ac\u5b50\u671f at the court and tried to kidnap King Hui. Yet the king was protected by his retainers and took refuge in the palace of the Queen Dowager of King Zhao.\n\nDuke Bai thereupon proclaimed himself king, but was assassinated by Prince Zigao \u5b50\u9ad8, called Duke Ye \u8449\u516c. In this year, Chu finally destroyed the state of Chen, in 447 the state of Cai, and in 445 the state of Qi \u675e.\n\nIn 473, the armies of Yue had finally destroyed the state of Wu. In the northern parts of Wu, along the plain of the River Huai \u6dee, Chu began to expand its territory. King Hui was succeeded by his son Prince Zhong \u4e2d, who is posthumously known was King Jian \u695a\u7c21\u738b (r. 432-408). Under his reign, Chu conquered the statelet of Ju \u8392 (modern Juxian \u8392\u7e23, Shandong) that had belonged to the territory of Qi. King Jian employed the famous military advisor Wu Qi \u5433\u8d77, who reformed the army, so that Chu was able to conquer the southern regions inhabited by the non-Chinese peoples of the Yangyue \u63da\u7cb5, namely the Dongting \u6d1e\u5ead (Hunan) and Cangwu \u84bc\u68a7 (Guizhou) regions.\n\nKing Jian was succeeded by his son Prince Dang \u7576, posthumously known as King Sheng \u695a\u8072\u738b (r. 408-402). King Sheng was killed by \"robbers\" (presumably nobles or family members) and was succeeded by his son Prince Yi \u7591, posthumously known as King Dao \u695a\u60bc\u738b (r. 402-381). Under his reign, Chu contended with the troops of the new states of Han \u97d3, Zhao \u8d99 and Wei \u9b4f, the successor states of Jin. King Dao was succeeded by his son Prince Zang \u81e7, posthumously known as King Su \u695a\u8085\u738b (r. 381-370). Because King Su had no sons, he left the throne to his younger brother Prince Liangfu \u826f\u592b, who is posthumously known as King Xuan \u695a\u5ba3\u738b (r. 370-340). At the end of the latter's reign, the armies of Qin attacked Chu. At that time, Qin was governed by counsellor Shang Yang \u5546\u9785.\n\nKing Xuan's son Prince Shang \u5546 succeeded to the throne in Chu, posthumously known as King Wei \u695a\u5a01\u738b (r. 340-329). He was able to defeat the armies of the state of Qi, which was at that time disturbed by inner quarrels. King Wei also defeated the armies of the kingdom of Yue and occupied a large part of its territory, so that Chu was now the sole state in the southern parts of China. In 306, Yue was destroyed by Chu.\n\nChu as a large but weak state between Qin and Qi\n\nWhen King Wei died, the state of Wei used this opportunity and conquered part of its northern territory. King Wei's successor was his son Prince Guai \u69d0, posthumously known as King Huai \u695a\u61f7\u738b (r. 329-299). In 323 BCE he took revenge and attacked the territory of Wei, seizing eight counties. The next military target was the state of Qi, yet at that time the military adviser Chen Zhen \u9673\u8eeb dwelled at the court of Qi and was dispatched to the camp of counsellor Zhao Yang \u662d\u967d, highest commander of the army of Chu. Chen Zhen persuaded Zhao Yang with the parable of drawing feet to a snake that he would have no advantage in defeating the army of Qi, so that Zhao Yang withdrew. At least, Chu was able to conclude an alliance with the states of Qin, Wei and Qi that was initiated by the famous diplomatist Zhang Yi \u5f35\u5100.\n\nThis alliance became important in 318 BCE, when an alliance, concluded with the help of Su Qin \u8607\u79e6, attacked the state of Qin. King Huai took over the lead of the allies and penetrated into the Hangu Pass \u51fd\u8c37\u95dc, yet the allies withdrew without forcing Qin to battle.\n\nIn 313, things had changed and Chu was in alliance with Qi. The king of Qin decided to send Zhang Yi to Chu in order to persuade King Huai to change side again and, in the end, to isolate Chu. Chen Zhen was well aware of this and warned King Huai, but he refused to accept the warning. In the end, the enraged king of Qi concluded an alliance with Qin. King Huai, on his side, made ready the troops for a campaign against Qin. Again, Chen Zhen warned the king and suggested offering Qin a city to restore the former alliance. King Huai ignored the warning, and so the army of Qin destroyed that of Chu at Danyang \u4e39\u967d in 312, captured a huge humber of troops and officers, and occupied the region of Hanzhong \u6f22\u4e2d. At Lantian \u85cd\u7530, the armies battled a second time, and the fresh defeat of Chu instigated Han and Wei to seize some more territory from Chu.\n\nA year later, Qin suggested concluding peace and sent Zhang Yi to the court of Chu. King Huai immediately arrested Zhang Yi and planned to kill him, but Zhang established contact with Jin Shang \u9773\u5c1a, who explained to King Huai that Qin would attack Chu again. He also spoke with the King's favourite, Lady Zheng Xiu \u912d\u8896, and threatened her that the king of Qin would try to purchase peace by sending beautiful girls to King Huai. The Lady then managed the release of Zhang Yi, and peace was made with Qin. Shortly after, the Chu embassador to Qi returned, Qu Yuan \u5c48\u539f, and reproached the king for not having executed Zhang Yi.\n\nIn 310 BCE, the King Min of Qi \u9f4a\u6e63\u738b (r. 324-284) sent an envoy to the court of Chu and explained that, after the death of King Hui in Qin, the situation had changed thoroughly, and suggested to conclude a common alliance with Han, Wei, Zhao and Yan \u71d5 against Qin. Zhao Ju \u662d\u96ce convinced King Huai that it was better to be part of the alliance around Qi and to win back the territory once lost to Qin. Yet in 307, King Huai decided that he could also win territory by concluding a peaceful alliance with Qin. Two years later Qin, Han and Wei attacked Chu for its betrayal of the alliance. King Huai sent his crown prince as a hostage to Qin and requested military support against the three states.\n\nIn 304, the crown prince of Chu had a private quarrel with some nobles of Qin. When he accidentally killed one of them, he fled and returned to Chu. In order to take revenge for the murder, Qin attacked Chu, supported by troops of Qi, Han and Wei, and defeated Chu at Chuisha \u5782\u6c99. A year later, Qin undertook a second campaign against Chu and heavily defeated the army of Chu. King Huai thereupon sent his crown prince as a hostage to Qi, an ally of Qin, and requested peace.\n\nOnly after a further campaign and after King Zhao of Qin had sent an urgent letter, King Huai of Chu consented to a meeting with the king of Qin at the Wuguan Pass \u6b66\u95dc. Yet King Huai did not trust Qin and feared that he might be caught in a trap. Zhao Ju suggested not to meet the king of Qin, but the King's younger son urged him to go. In the end, King Huai was escorted to Xianyang \u54b8\u967d, the capital of Qin, and was threatened to cease territory before concluding an alliance. He refused and was arrested and detained.\n\nAt home, the situation was precarious. Both the king and the crown prince were held hostages in Qin, and Zhao Ju argued that it was against etiquette to enthrone a younger son as long as the ruler was living. This meant that there was no head of government as long as King Huai was in Qin. The court brooded over the issue and finally invited Prince Heng \u6a6b to come to the capital Ying. He was enthroned as king of Ch, posthumously known as King Qingxiang \u695a\u9803\u8944\u738b (r. 299-263).\n\nThe king of Qin thereupon continued his campaigning against Chu, defeated its army, and seized territory in the north. A year later, King Huai managed to escape, but because the roads to Chu were blocked by Qin, he fled to the state of Zhao, but fearing the anger of Qin, King Huiwen of Zhao \u8d99\u60e0\u6587\u738b (r. 299-266) refused to offer protection. King Huai was finally captured by the bloodhounds of Qin and brought back to Xianyang, where he died a year later. At least, his corpse was allowed to be transferred back to his native state, where he was buried with greatest honours.\n\nIn 293 BCE, general Bai Qi \u767d\u8d77 massacred the army of Han. Threatened by this cruel way of warfare, King Qingxiang agreed to conclude a marriage of peace with Qin. This new alliance led to a campaign in 284, carried out by Qin, Chu, Han, Wei, Zhao and Yan and targeted against the state of Qi in the east. Chu so regained the region of Huaibei \u6dee\u5317. In 281, King Qingxiang was persuaded to resume war against Qin, in order to gain more territory. He first concluded an alliance with Qin and Han and planned to use this opportunity to conquer some territory of the patriarchal kings of Zhou around Luoyang. King Nan of Zhou \u5468\u738b\u8d67 (r. 315-256) thereupon sent his relative, Duke Wu \u6b66\u516c, to Zhaozi \u662d\u5b50, the counsellor of Chu. Duke Wu explained to Zhaozi that the destruction of the house of Zhou meant a thorough dissolution of the world order and would bring only chaos to the state of Chu. King Qingxiang thereupon abandoned this plan.\n\nThe campaigns against Qin continued, but in 278 BCE, general Bai Qi advanced to the capital of Chu and defiled the tombs of the kings of Chu. The capital of Chu was moved to the ancient site of Chen (modern Huaiyang \u6dee\u967d, Henan) It was only in 276 that the army of Chu was able to recover some of its core territory. Chu was even able to supporte Han, Zhao and Wei in a campaign against Yan. This was only possible because of an armistice bargained with Qin, covered by the crown prince as a hostage dwelling in Qin.\n\nWhen King Qingxiang fell ill, his son Prince Xiong Yuan \u718a\u5143 (or Wan \u5b8c) managed to escape from Qin and was enthroned as the new king of Chu. He is posthumously known as King Kaolie \u695a\u8003\u70c8\u738b (r. 263-238). The new king immediately appointed his trusted Counsellor-to-the-Left (zuoxi \u5de6\u5f92), Lord Chunshen \u6625\u7533\u541b, as Prime Minister. Under the Lord's administration, the state of Chu was able to recover for a while. The capital was first shifted to Juyang \u5de8\u967d (modern Taihe \u592a\u548c, Anhui), later to to Shouchun \u58fd\u6625 (modern Shouxian \u58fd\u7e23, Anhui) further to the east. Lord Chunshen met with Lord Xinling \u4fe1\u9675\u541b of Wei and forged an alliance that was able to defeat Qin in 257. A year later, Chu conquered the state of Lu.\n\nKing Kaolie was succeeded by his son Prince Dao \u608d (or Yu \u715c), who is posthumously known as King You \u695a\u5e7d\u738b (r. 238-228). Li Yuan \u674e\u5712, a powerful noble, used this personal change to assassinate Lord Chunshen. King You was succeeded by his younger half-brother You \u7336 (or Hao \u90dd), who is posthumously known as King Ai \u695a\u54c0\u738b (r. 228). He only ruled for two months before he was overthrown and killed by his older half-brother Fuchu \u8ca0\u82bb (r. 228-223).\n\nThe rule of the last kings of Chu was overshadowed by a growing military success of the state of Qin that succeedingly conquered the states of Han, Zhao and Wei. In 224, the Qin general Wang Jian \u738b\u7fe6 defeated the army of Chu and killed general Xiang Yan \u9805\u71d5, a great uncle of Xiang Yu \u9805\u7fbd, the eventual hegemonial king (bawang \u9738\u738b) of West Chu \u897f\u695a. A year later, Wang Jian and Meng Wu \u8499\u6b66 seized the capital of Chu, captured King Fuchu and transformed the state of Chu into a commandery of the state of Qin.\n\nThe name of Chu was often used as a name for imperial princedoms, and was one of the Ten States (Shiguo \u5341\u570b) in the 10th century.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

China is adjacent to 14 countries on land: Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Mongolia, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, India, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, and Afghanistan (Fig. 1.4). With a total land border length of more than 22,000 kilometers, China is the country with the longest land borderline, most neighboring countries, and most complex border situations in the world (Table 2.3).\n\nTable 2.3 China\u2019s neighboring states on land Full size table\n\nUpon the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, there were 12 disputes over border issues between China and land-based neighboring countries. Over the following 50 years, China has, under the guidance of its Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the foreign policy of good neighborliness and friendship, steadfastly, stepwise, and steadily solved the border issues left over by history with most neighboring countries through unremitting efforts. By the end of 2004, China had concluded border treaties or agreements with 12 neighboring countries, and the delineated borders covered about 90% of the total length of China\u2019s land boundary lines.\n\nThe resolution of China\u2019s border issues mainly occurred during two periods: (1) In the 1960s, China concluded border treaties or agreements with Myanmar, Nepal, Mongolia, Pakistan, and Afghanistan in succession; (2) since the 1990s, China has resolved border issues with Russia, Laos, and Vietnam, as well as the newly independent Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, etc. At present, China has border disputes only with Bhutan and India.\n\nThe Chinese government treats the issues left over by history with a rational and practical mindset and settles the boundary disputes with the goal of upholding the interests of the nation, but also is widely praised by the relevant partner governments, peoples, and international media. After China\u2019s reform and opening up, Deng Xiaoping proposed a 12-Chinese-character principle for handling issues of territories and borders, namely, \u201cAs sovereignty belongs to China, we will shelve disputes and develop together,\u201d which opens up new ideas for the peaceful settlement of problems such as those of the Diaoyu Island and Nansha Islands.\n\n2.3.1.2 Sino-Indian Border Issue\n\nThe total length of the Sino-Indian border is about 1700 kilometers, consisting of three sections: the west, the middle, and the east, with lengths of 600, 450, and 650 kilometers, respectively. The total disputed area is about 125,000 square kilometers. In 1962, a border war broke out between the two countries because of the dispute. Although the governments of the two sides have been seeking ways and means for a fair and reasonable solution to the border dispute for decades, no breakthrough has been made so far.\n\nThe controversy is concentrated in the east and west sections, with the largest disputed area, at 90,000 square kilometers, in the eastern section. The problem stems from the period of British rule over India: In 1913, the British Indian authorities held a meeting in Shimla in northern India during which Henry McMahon, the representative of the British government participating in the meeting, secretly concocted a so-called McMahon line with representatives of the local Tibetan authorities on the Sino-Indian border issue, and assigned to India 90,000 square kilometers of territory along the east section of the China\u2013India border, which has always belonged to China. The inhabitants of this region are all Tibetans or ethnic groups closely related to Tibetans; they are inseparable from the Tibetan society in terms of race, culture, religion, and living customs. The Chinese people call this area South Tibet. No previous Chinese government has ever acknowledged the McMahon line.\n\nThe disputed area in the west section is 30,000 square kilometers. China actually controls the Aksai Chin area in eastern Kashmir (belonging to Hetian County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region), while India controls some 450 square kilometers in parts of Parigas. According to the Agreement between China and Pakistan on the Boundary between Xinjiang and Areas in Actual Pakistan Control of Their Defense concluded in 1963 by the Governments of the People\u2019s Republic of China and Pakistan, the Pakistani side acknowledges that the areas under the jurisdiction of Xinjiang, and part of the areas assigned to the northern Pakistan region (Karakorum Corridor) belongs to China. At present, India claims sovereignty over these two areas controlled by China, but the Chinese government claims no territorial dispute over the western section.\n\nFrom the above, we can see that the focus of the Sino-Indian border dispute is the ownership of a large part of China\u2019s territory. This can be considered a \u201cbattle of three lines\u201d: first, to address the gap between the traditional Chinese\u2013Indian line of customary practice advocated by the Chinese government and the illegitimate \u201cMcMahon line\u201d that India upholds, to determine to whom the 90,000 square kilometers of disputed territory should belong; and second, the dispute over the line of actual control, which has a direct bearing on the status quo and stability of the border between China and India, who have held 18 rounds of border negotiations over the years. In March 2015, China and India agreed to maintain peace and stability on the Himalayan border. However, the border issues remain unresolved and the differences between the countries remain large.\n\n2.3.1.3 China-Bhutan Border Dispute\n\nThe border between China and Bhutan is about 600 kilometers long and has never been officially delineated. There are altogether 6 border areas in dispute. From 1950, maps published in China drew certain parts of western and northern Bhutan into the territory of China, and hence, the dispute arose. Since 1984, the two countries have held border talks in Beijing and Thimphu in turn. In 1998, during the 12th talks, the two countries signed an Agreement between the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Bhutan to Maintain Peace and Tranquility in the Border Areas of China and Bhutan. To date, however, the demarcation of the China\u2013Bhutan borders remains largely incomplete. In 2004, the Treaty Series on Border Affairs of the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2014China-Bhutan Volume, edited by the Department of Treaty and Law of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, pointed out that while there is no formal border, there is a traditional customary line between the two countries, and the border areas are basically stable.\n\nChina disputes six areas under Bhutanese control: Lulin (Ronglin), Donglang, Chamapu, Jiwu, Baiyu, and Merag-Sagteng. According to the King of Bhutan, the kingdom disputes the following areas under Chinese control: from Doklam in the west, stretching along Gamochen to Batangla and the Sinchela watershed, and then down to the Amo Chhu River.\n\nAs of the end of 2016, there have been 24 rounds of border talks between the two sides. At present, the China\u2013Bhutan relationship maintains sound momentum. The two sides have continuously expanded exchange in tourism, sports, and culture. Courtesy of the joint efforts of both sides, important progress has also been made in the China-Bhutan border negotiations in recent years; the two sides have successfully completed the joint investigation of the border disputed areas. Both parties hope that in the future, through friendly consultations, they will find a solution to the border issue that both parties can accept.\n\n2.3.1.4 Kashmir\n\nKashmir is a region in the northwest of the South Asian subcontinent, to the west of the Tibetan Plateau, a former state of British India with an area of 222,478 square kilometers. Presently, the region is subject to tripartite control by three countries: Pakistan controls the northwestern part (Azad Kashmir and northern Kashmir), India controls the central and southern regions (Jammu and Kashmir), and China controls the northeast (Aksai Chin and the Karakorum Corridor). The Siachen Glacier is controlled by both India and Pakistan, with India controlling most of them and Pakistan controlling the lower peaks.\n\nPakistan claims that all Kashmir, except for the parts controlled by China, is Pakistani territory, while India has never formally recognized Chinese or Pakistani control of the area. China generally believes that the \u201cKashmir\u201d region only includes the actual control zone in India and the actual control zone in Pakistan. Kashmir has long been regarded as one of the most dangerous territorial disputes in the world, and three wars have been fought between India and Pakistan over it: the First Indo-Pakistan War in 1947, the Second Indo-Pakistan War in 1965, and the Third Indo-Pakistan War in 1971, along with the Kargil border conflict (also known as the Fourth Kashmir War) that broke out in the Kargil district of India-controlled Kashmir in 1999. To avoid ambiguity, China refers to the Kashmir regions controlled by China, Pakistan, and India as \u201cChina-controlled Kashmir,\u201d \u201cPakistan-controlled Kashmir,\u201d and \u201cIndia-controlled Kashmir,\u201d respectively.\n\nIndia-Controlled Kashmir\n\nIndia controls about 45.5% of Kashmir (101,387 square kilometers) and has established the state of Jammu and Kashmir in the area under its control, which consists mainly of four parts: the Kashmir Valley, Jammu, Ladakh, and the Siachen Glacier.\n\nPakistani-Controlled Kashmir\n\nThe Pakistani section, an autonomous region, can be divided into two parts: One is Azad Kashmir (about 13,350 square kilometers; and the other is northern Kashmir (about 72,496 square kilometers), covering a total area of about 85,846 square kilometers.\n\nChina-Controlled Kashmir\n\nincludes the following areas, which do not belong to the Kashmir region as deemed by China: Aksai Chin, about 37,555 square kilometers, and part of the Karakorum Corridor in northern Kashmir. In 1963, Pakistan delineated these areas to China.\n\n2.3.1.5 Sino-Russian Border\n\nThe border between China and Russia is more than 4300 kilometers long and is divided into two sections, east (4280 kilometers) and west (54 kilometers). For historical reasons, the two sides have different understanding of the alignment of the boundary lines for some areas, which has led to many disputed areas large and small.\n\nThe border issues between China and Russia have a long history. Since the Treaty of Nerchinsk between the Qing government and Russia in 1689, Sino-Russian border conflict has never stopped. By 1949, there were already three \u201cborder lines\u201d between China and the Soviet Union (Russia):\n\n1. Treaty lines. After the Treaty of Nerchinsk came into force, a boundary line relying on many unequal treaties formed between China and the Soviet Union (Russia). 2. USSR map-line. As the name suggests, this was a border line marked by the Soviet Union, which deviated from the treaty line in many places, and in breach of treaties, assigned to the USSR an array of China\u2019s territories, for instance, shifting midriver boundary lines in the Heilongjiang River and Wusuli River (Ussuri River) to the Chinese shore and thus appropriating all islands on the Chinese half of the river. Since the founding of the Republic of China, all Chinese governments have refused to recognize the USSR map-line. 3. The actual control line. The actual line of control on the USSR side not only greatly exceeded the treaty lines in many locations but also crossed the USSR map-line, making it equivalent to the seizure of Chinese territory.\n\nSince the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, China and the USSR\u2014and then four former USSR states since the disintegration of the USSR in December 1991, namely Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan have held three border negotiations. The first was in 1964, the second was from 1969 to 1978, and the third ran from 1987 to 2004.\n\nIn October 2004, the foreign ministers of China and Russia signed the Supplementary Agreement to the East Section of China-Russia Boundary; in June 2005, the agreement entered into force, ratifying the more than 4300-km border line between China and Russia and delineating the whole 7600-km border(s) with the former Soviet Union.\n\n2.3.2 Maritime Neighboring Countries and Marine Space Division\n\n2.3.2.1 Marine Space Division\n\nChina has a mainland coastline of more than 18,000 kilometers and an island coastline of over 14,200 kilometers; it has 6961 islands of more than 500 square meters, covering an area of over 80,000 square kilometers, and tens of thousands of rock islands below 500 square meters. Of all the islands, 433 are inhabited. Historically, the rise of the Chinese nation and its fall and shame are all closely related to the oceans.\n\nThe territorial sea of the People\u2019s Republic of China refers to the marine belt adjacent to the territorial land and internal waters of the PRC. The water area from the baseline of the territorial sea to the land is the internal waters of the PRC. The width of the territorial sea is 12 nautical miles. The outer limit of the territorial sea is a line whose distance at any given point to the nearest point at the baseline of the territorial sea is equal to 12 nautical miles. The contiguous zone is adjacent to the territorial sea and also has a width of 12 nautical miles. Foreign non-military vessels enjoy the right of innocent (inoffensive) passage through the territorial waters of the PRC according to law. The entry of foreign military vessels into the territorial sea of the PRC, however, is subject to the approval of the national government. The structure of China\u2019s territorial waters is as follows (Fig. 2.24):\n\nFig. 2.24 Schematic Diagram of the Structure of Chinese Territorial Waters Full size image\n\nInternal waters. Legal status is equal to the national inland waterways and lakes, with absolute sovereign rights.\n\nTerritorial sea. China has sovereignty over the living and nonliving resources of the territorial sea; ships of all countries have the right to harmless access to the territorial sea.\n\nContiguous zone. China here has the right to prevent and punish violations of laws and regulations on safety, customs, finance, sanitation, or immigration controls on its terrestrial territories, internal waters, or territorial waters.\n\nExclusive economic zone. The territorial state has the right to explore, develop, maintain, and utilize all the natural resources within the zone; other countries enjoy the freedom to fly, sail, and lay submarine cables and pipelines.\n\n2.3.2.2 Maritime Neighboring Countries\n\nThe eight maritime neighbors of the People\u2019s Republic of China are, in clockwise order, from northeast to southwest: North Korea, South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, and Vietnam, all with some territorial disputes with China (Fig. 1.4). Among them, only Vietnam has no sea dispute.\n\nThe main disputes can be divided into two types, the first one being sovereignty disputes over some islands and reefs, such as the Nansha Islands (Spratly Islands). Such problems are mainly caused by the unlawful occupation or control by the countries concerned of the territories and surrounding waters belonging to China. The second type is the maritime delimitation controversy, which goes back primarily to 1982\u2019s United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), as it stipulates that coastal States may claim a 200-nautical-wide exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf. This law results in the emergence of multiple overlapping maritime claims by many maritime neighbors, and thereby the issue of maritime delimitation arises. The interaction and intertwining of these two types of disputes are greatly increasing the complexity of the issues. In these disputes, the Chinese government has consistently advocated negotiation and settlement through friendly discussions with the relevant countries on the basis of respecting historical facts and international law.\n\n2.3.2.2.1 Disputes Over the Exclusive Economic Zone\n\nThe exclusive economic zone, as a new system established in the 1982 UNCLOS, is the third type of sea in law, between territorial sea and the high seas (international waters). It is outside and directly adjacent to the territorial sea, with a width of not more than 200 nautical miles from the territorial sea baseline. In an exclusive economic zone, the coastal state enjoys sovereign rights of exploration, development, conservation, and management of natural resources; jurisdiction over the construction and use of artificial islands, facilities, and structures; marine scientific research; and protection and preservation of the marine environment. Other countries have the freedom to navigate, fly over, or lay submarine cables and pipelines.\n\nChina\u2019s exclusive economic zone system was formally established by the Third Session of the Ninth National People\u2019s Congress Standing Committee Conference in 1998 through the enactment of the \u201cLaw of the People\u2019s Republic of China on the Exclusive Economic Zone and the Continental Shelf.\u201d It extends beyond the territorial waters of China to the adjacent sea area and extends to 200 nautical miles from a baseline measuring the breadth of the territorial sea.\n\nChina is on the verge of the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea; these are enclosed and semienclosed seas, densely dotted with coastal islands and sea islands, and this makes it impossible to reach 400 nautical miles measuring from any cape (headland) or island to another headland or island, thus resulting in the overlapping of China\u2019s exclusive economic zones with those of the neighboring countries.\n\nYellow Sea (Huanghai Sea)\n\nThe Yellow Sea area is 470 nautical miles long from north to south and 360 nautical miles wide east-west, thus covering an area of about 380,000 square kilometers. The Shandong Peninsula dips into the Yellow Sea, and the line between its Chengshan Cape and the Changshan Archipelago of the Korean Peninsula roughly forms the maritime borderline between China and the Koreas. In the Yellow Sea, China is facing demarcation issues with both North and South Korea. As the width of the Yellow Sea is less than 400 nautical miles, there is bound to be overlap of the three nations\u2019 exclusive economic zones, meaning that the principle of fairness, the length of the coastline, resource factors, historic fishing rights, and relevant current status must all be relied on to delineate the exclusive economic zones with fair results.\n\nEast China Sea\n\nThe East China Sea has a length of 630 nautical miles from north to south, an east-west width of 150\u2013360 nautical miles (NM), and an area of about 770,000 square kilometers. Due to the inevitable overlapping of EEZs for China and Japan in the East China Sea, both parties should, in accordance with the principle of fairness, take into account factors such as the shape of the coast, geomorphic features, the length ratio of the coastline, and historical rights in order to draw up the boundaries of exclusive economic zones through consultation.\n\nSouth China Sea\n\nThe South China Sea has a length of about 1800 NM north and south, an east-west width of 650 NM, and an area of about 3.5 million square kilometers. The South China Sea Islands are the Nansha Islands (Spratly Islands), Xisha Islands (Paracel Islands), Dongsha Islands (Pratas Islands), Zhongsha Islands (Macclesfield Islands), and others. China has promulgated a \u201cnine-dashed line\u201d or dotted line to encompass what it asserts to be its traditional maritime territories in the South China Sea and protect its historic rights within the circumscribed borderlines, asserting indisputable sovereignty over the South China Sea islands, which have been China\u2019s territory since ancient times. In the spirit of resolving differences, full account should be given to China\u2019s historic rights in the areas circumscribed by the nine-dashed line. The South China Sea issue is elaborated in the next section.\n\n2.3.2.2.2 Disputes Over Continental Shelf\n\nArticle 76 of UNCLOS states that \u201cThe continental shelf of a coastal State comprises the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to that distance.\u201d This definition of the continental shelf, as adopted by UNCLOS, is intended to reduce disputes and ambiguities, but it has also become a new source of controversy per se. The demarcation of the continental shelf is a major issue that concerns the sovereign rights and vital interests of the countries concerned; like the exclusive economic zone, it requires the countries concerned to work hard to adopt a fair and reasonable solution through friendly consultations.\n\nYellow Sea (Huanghai Sea)\n\nThe Yellow Sea is a neritic shelf sea with an average depth of 55 meters, and no deeper than 125 meters. Analysis of seabed sediment shows that one-third of the eastern Yellow Sea seabed is derived from the mountains of North Korea, while the remaining two-thirds, the western Yellow Sea, is from the mud brought by the Chinese rivers. South Korea proposes to divide the continental shelf with China by a middle-line approach; China, on the other hand, advocates an equiratio line based on the coastline to divide the continental shelf between China-North Korea and China\u2013South Korea.\n\nEast China Sea\n\nThe East China Sea is an area with a broad continental shelf, the average depth of which is 72 meters, while the maximum depth is well above 2000 meters (the Okinawa Trough). The submarine topography of the East China Sea is consistent with that of the Chinese mainland: It gradually tilts from northwest to southeast until the Okinawa Trough, which is a special geographic unit in the East China Sea that separates the continental shelf from the Ryukyu Islands. The Chinese government believes that the Okinawa Trough proves that the continental shelf between China and Japan is disconnected and the trough serves as the dividing line between them. Japan, on the other hand, advocates the use of a middle line (that claims the area between the east of the East China Sea middle-line and the center line of the Okinawa Trough, which is an overlapping area of shelves between China, Japan, and South Korea, covering an area of about 300,000 square kilometers.)\n\nDivision of the Continental Shelf\n\nIn the Yellow Sea, South Korea advocates the adoption of the middle-line principle; while in the East China Sea, South Korea adopts the principle of natural extension of terrestrial territory.\n\nSouth China Sea\n\nThe South China Sea lies between mainland China, the Philippines, Kalimantan Island (Borneo), Sumatra Island, and the Indochinese Peninsula. It is a typical marginal sea basin, surrounded by China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines, Thailand, and other countries. The surrounding continental shelves (or insular shelves) extend to the basin center. The middle part is an ocean-crust type of deep ocean floor. The countries around the South China Sea require their continental shelves to overlap with China\u2019s, circumscribed by the nine-dashed line. It has been suggested that there may be a part of this outer continental shelf that goes beyond 200 nautical miles in the northern part of China\u2019s South China Sea. There may also be some areas of the continental shelves in Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and the Philippines around the South China Sea that go beyond 200 nautical miles from the territorial sea baseline and go deep into China\u2019s continental shelf, circumscribed by the nine-dashed line. In resolving these differences, due consideration shall be given to China\u2019s historic rights enjoyed within the continental shelf circumscribed by the nine-dashed line.\n\n2.3.2.3 Diaoyu Islands\n\nSubsidiary islands of Taiwan, the Diaoyu Island, and its affiliated Islands are located in the northeast of Taiwan Island of China in the sea area between 123\u00b0 20\u2032\u2013124\u00b0 40\u2032 east longitude and 25\u00b0 40\u2032\u201326\u00b0 00\u2032 north latitude. They comprise Diaoyu Island, Huangwei Island, Chiwei Island, Nansiao Island, Beisiao Island, Nanyu Island, Beiyu Island, Feiyu Island, and other islands and reefs, with a total area of about 5.69 square kilometers. The Diaoyu Islands present an issue of territorial sovereignty dispute between China and Japan.\n\nThe Chinese government believes that these islands are an integral and indisputable part of China\u2019s territory, terms of history, geography, or jurisprudence, whichever. The rationales include the following: China first discovered, named, and exploited the Diaoyu Islands; China has imposed long-term jurisdiction over the Diaoyu Islands; the Diaoyu Islands are marked by Chinese and foreign maps as belonging to China; after the Second World War, according to international legal documents such as the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, the Diaoyu Islands were returned to China. The Japanese government considers the Diaoyu Islands to be Japanese territory and argues that they were discovered by Tatsushiro Koga in 1884 and are not included in the territories that Japan had to give up under the San Francisco Peace Treaty.\n\nWith respect to the sovereignty of the Diaoyu Islands, from an international law point of view, China\u2019s demands are justified, the grounds are sufficient, and the evidence is obviously stronger than that of Japan. First, the Diaoyu Islands are not terra nullius; China has met the requirement of \u201cobtaining sovereignty through discovery.\u201d Undoubtedly, China discovered the islands hundreds of years earlier than Japan and demonstrated official behavior by using the islands as a navigation marker. Second, Japan\u2019s annexation of the Diaoyu Islands is closely linked with its victory in the Sino-Japanese War and the forced signing of the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Thus, the merger has no legal effect on sovereignty. Third, although islands such as the Diaoyu Islands are included in the \u201cOkinawa Return Agreement\u201d signed by Japan and the United States in 1971, this cannot serve as the basis for Japan\u2019s sovereignty over these islands.\n\n2.3.3 South China Sea\n\nThe most complicated and thorny territorial issue China faces, the South China Sea dispute involves China, Taiwan of China, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, and Vietnam.\n\nThe South China Sea Islands include the Dongsha Islands (Pratas Islands), Xisha Islands (Paracel Islands), Zhongsha Islands (Macclesfield Islands), and Nansha Islands (Spratly Islands). China first discovered, named and exploited the South China Sea islands and related sea areas. With the earliest, and continued, peaceful, and effective, exercise of sovereignty and jurisdiction over these islands and areas, China has established territorial sovereignty and related rights and interests in the corresponding areas.\n\nAccording to Chinese domestic law and international laws including UNCLOS, China\u2019s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea encompass sovereignty over all South China Sea Islands, their internal waters, territorial waters, contiguous areas, exclusive economic zones, and continental shelf; and, last but not least, the historic right in the South China Sea.\n\nChina has always firmly opposed the illegal encroachment by certain countries over some islands and reefs in the Nansha Islands (Spratly Islands) of China as well as infringement on the seas under the jurisdiction of China. China is willing to continue to work with the parties directly concerned on settling disputes in the South China Sea peacefully through negotiations and consultations on the basis of respecting historical facts and in accordance with international law.\n\n2.3.3.1 Nine-Dashed Line (Nine-Dotted Line)\n\nOn maps of the world, Asia, or China published in China, one can see a U-shaped dotted line in the South China Sea region, commonly known as the \u201cU-Shaped Line\u201d or \u201cNine-Dashed Line\u201d (Jiuduan Line). Since ancient times, China has had jurisdiction over the South China Sea islands. However, entering the modern era, the Western powers not only repeatedly invaded China itself but also coveted the Chinese islands in the border areas. To safeguard its sovereignty over them, the Republic of China set up a Land and Water Map Review Committee to examine the Chinese and English names of the islands and reefs of the South China Sea, and published a Map of the South China Sea Islands. The southern boundary of China has been identified at 4 degrees north latitude, where Zengmu Reef (James Shoal) is marked within the territory line. This marks the first appearance of the South China Sea territory line on a Chinese map, that is, the prototype of the U-shaped line of today.\n\nChina\u2019s Propositions\n\nWhen China marked the U-shaped dotted line on the map of the South China Sea in 1947, the international community did not raise any objection, and the surrounding Southeast Asian countries never proposed any diplomatic protest. However, in the 1970s, the dispute over the South China Sea began to escalate. The Chinese government\u2019s legal claim for the Nine-Dashed Line is actually based on a combination of the island ownership line and the historic rights line. In this sense, it is an established, objective reality existing for more than half a century and recognized by many countries around the world.\n\n2.3.3.2 South China Sea Issue\n\nSince the signing of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea between China and the ASEAN countries in November 2002, the dispute over the waters under the South China Sea has been relatively calm and mild. However, the dispute has always existed, and its intricacy remains. It can be boiled down to two points: the dispute over the territorial sovereignty of the Nansha Islands (Spratly Islands) and the dispute over the demarcation of exclusive economic zones and the continental shelf in the South China Sea, as well as disagreements on the territorial sea baselines and the islands\u2019 sovereignty with respect to the demarcation.\n\nAt present, Vietnam has occupied 31 islands and reefs in the Nansha Island; the Philippines has occupied 9; and Malaysia 5. China, despite its strong claim, is only stationed in 6 islands and reefs.\n\nSome ASEAN countries hold that the South China Sea will become a \u201chot spot\u201d in Southeast Asia. Therefore, ASEAN actively interfered with the dispute over the Nansha Islands and the demarcation of the South China Sea. These countries coordinated the ASEAN countries\u2019 position with the intention of wielding the collective power of ASEAN to deal with China. They also sought to \u201cinternationalize\u201d the Nansha dispute and hoped to urge major outsiders such as the United States and Japan into the dispute so as to ultimately achieve the purpose of restraining China and carving up the Nansha Islands and the South China Sea.\n\nSo far, more than 200 oil companies have engaged in oil and gas development activities in the South China Sea, from the United States, the Netherlands, Britain, Japan, France, Canada, Australia, Russia, India, Norway, South Korea, and so on. These oil companies have made substantial financial and technological investments in the South China Sea and have undoubtedly increased the complexity of the above-described dispute.\n\nNansha Islands Dispute\n\nThe Nansha islands dispute involves five countries and six parties, namely China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei. The Nansha Islands are located in the southern half of the South China Sea, with reefs scattered from east to west for about 400 nautical miles and for about 500 nautical miles from south to north; the seas encompassed by the islands\u2019 reefs amount to 800,000 square kilometers, accounting for 38% of the South China Sea waters; except for the Pyramid Rocks (Gaujian Shr), the reefs are all composed of coral. The Nansha Islands have an important strategic position abreast of major maritime traffic in the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. At the same time, they also have significant economic value: their seabeds abound in oil resources and natural gas; minerals like iron, manganese, copper, aluminum, and others; and many aquatic resources.\n\nVietnam\u2019s invasion of the Nansha Islands began with the former South Vietnamese government in Saigon, which claimed ownership of all the waters of Nansha. The Philippine government tried to \u201cconfirm\u201d its sovereignty interests in the South China Sea through domestic legislation and the aid of ASEAN forces to contain China. They also unilaterally announced maritime legislation that provided for a 200-nautical-mile economic zone and assigned 410,000 square kilometers of sea area east of Nansha into its territorial sea. Through various channels, Malaysia has fortified its proposition of \u201cfactual possession and actual control\u201d in the international community, declaring that it has \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over part of the Nansha Islands. Brunei occupied an island reef, announced a 200 NM exclusive economic zone, and issued a new map indicating its jurisdiction over the sea, claiming sovereignty over Nantong Reef (Louisa Reef), and carving out 3000 square kilometers from the Nansha sea areas.\n\nChina advocates that all parties concerned adopt a restrained, calm, and constructive attitude toward the issue of Nansha. China always persists in using diplomatic channels to engage in discussion with relevant countries in a peaceful manner to resolve the relevant issues. This reflects China\u2019s sincerity in safeguarding regional stability and bilateral friendly relations.\n\nHuangyan Island (Scarborough Shoal) Dispute\n\nHuangyan Island (Scarborough Shoal) is one of 33 islands and reefs in the Zhongsha Islands (Macclesfield Islands). Coral Beach Reef, one of the Zhongsha Archipelago, is the only island reef above water in the Zhongsha Islands. Huangyan Island (Scarborough Shoal), 215 kilometers from the Philippines\u2019 Luzon Island, is an inherent territory of China: China first discovered it, named it, and incorporated it into Chinese territory, and implemented sovereign jurisdiction thereupon. China has thus been developing and utilizing Huangyan Island for a long time. To the east of Huangyan Island is Manila Trench, which serves as the natural geographical boundary between China\u2019s Zhongsha Islands (Macclesfield Islands) and the Philippine Islands.\n\nBefore 1997, the Philippines never raised any objection to the Chinese government\u2019s exercise of sovereignty over Huangyan Island or to its development and exploitation thereof. However, since 2000, the Philippines have continually provoked incidents on Huangyan Island and coveted sovereignty over it. In April 2012, a Chinese fishing vessel was harassed by a Philippine warship during its normal operations in a lagoon on Huangyan Island. The warship attempted to arrest the fishermen but was stopped by two Chinese maritime surveillance ships that arrived in a timely fashion. Subsequently, the Chinese government sent fishery administration vessels to the relevant areas for protection of rights and lodged solemn representations to the Philippines.\n\nChina has always maintained self-restraint on the Huangyan Island Dispute and does not encourage the involvement of armed forces. The dispatch of maritime surveillance vessels and fishery administration vessels from various countries shows that China\u2019s handling of Huangyan Island affairs as its own internal affairs has conveyed its uncompromising attitude toward territorial sovereignty and fully demonstrated its goodwill to resolve the problem without resorting to armed force.\n\nQuiz"}, {"url": "https://www.howold.co/person/duke-jing-of-jin/biography", "page_content": "Duke Jing Of Jin Biography\n\nRuler, state of Jin, China, c.6th BCNot to be confused with Duke Jing of Jin (Jiao)nor Duke Jing of Jin (Jujiu).FatherDuke Cheng of Jin\n\nDuke Jing of Jin (simplified Chinese: \u664b\u666f\u516c; traditional Chinese: \u6649\u666f\u516c; pinyin: J\u00ecn J\u01d0ng G\u014dng, died 581 BC) was the ruler of the State of Jin, a major power during the Spring and Autumn period of ancient China, from 599 to 581 BC. His ancestral name was Ji, given name Ju and Duke Jing was his posthumous *le. He succeeded his father Duke Cheng of Jin, who died in 600 BC.\n\nBattle of Bi\n\nMain article: Battle of Bi\n\nIn 597 BC, the third year of Duke Jing's rule, King Zhuang of Chu attacked the State of Zheng, then a Jin ally. Duke Jing dispatched an army led by Xun Linfu (\u8340\u6797\u7236), Sui Hui (\u96a8\u6703), and Zhao Shuo (\u8d99\u6714) to help Zheng. However, by the time the Jin army arrived Zheng had already surrendered to Chu. Xun Linfu wanted to return to Jin, but general Xian Hu (\u5148\u7e20) persuaded him to attack Chu. The Jin army was then decisively defeated at the Battle of Bi by the Chu and Zheng forces. After the battle King Zhuang of Chu was recognized as the Hegemon of China. Although Jin was weakened by the defeat, it was still one of the strongest states of China. Just two years later Jin attacked Zheng in retaliation for helping Chu in the Battle of Bi.\n\nConquest of the Red Di\n\nXian Hu, who was partly responsible for Jin's defeat at the Battle of Bi, escaped to the Red Di tribes for fear of punishment. In 596 BC, the Red Di people took advantage of Jin's recent defeat and attacked Jin with Xian Hu's help. Jin killed Xian Hu and his entire clan.\n\nDuke Jing's elder sister Bo Ji was the wife of Ying'er (\u5b30\u5152), the ruler of Lushi (\u6f5e\u6c0f), a major Red Di state. In 594 BC Bo Ji was killed by the Lushi minister Feng Shu. In retaliation, general Xun Linfu attacked Lushi, conquering the state and capturing its ruler Ying'er. Feng Shu fled to the State of Wey but was returned to Jin and killed. The following year, Jin conquered several more Red Di states or tribes.\n\nBattle of An\n\nMain article: Battle of An\n\nIn 589 BC the State of Qi, another major power, attacked the states of Lu and Wey, two Jin allies, and annexed the Lu city of Long. In response, Duke Jing dispatched the Jin army led by generals Xi Ke, Shi Xie, Luan Shu, and Han Jue to help his allies. The Jin and Qi forces fought at An (near present-day Jinan), and Jin decisively defeated Qi. The Qi ruler Duke Qing narrowly escaped capture by exchanging clothes and position with officer Pang Choufu (\u9022\u4e11\u7236), who was taken prisoner by Han Jue mistaking him as Duke Qing. After the battle Duke Qing was forced to plead for peace and cede territory to the state of Lu. Winning the Battle of An enabled Jin to regain much of its prestige lost at the Battle of Bi, and expand its armed forces from three armies to six.\n\nAbdication and death\n\nIn summer 581 BC, the 19th year of his reign, Duke Jing fell ill. He abdicated in favor of his son Duke Li of Jin, and died a month later.\n\nThe events surrounding his death are detailed in the Chinese cl*ic text Zuo Zhuan. According to the Zuo Zhuan, the duke first dreamt of a malevolent spirit. After waking, he consulted a wu (a shaman), who told him that he would not live to eat the new harvest's wheat. The duke's illness worsened and he had a new dream in which two urchins, apparently personifying his disease, taunted him, saying that medicine cannot reach them. A physician from the state of Qin was consulted. He told the duke that the disease had reached the gaohuang (\u818f\u8093), the fatty region between the heart and diaphragm, and was therefore incurable. The duke praised the physician for his skill, rewarded him lavishly and sent him away.\n\nOn day bingwu of the sixth month (August-September), the duke asked for and was presented with the new harvest wheat. Believing the shaman to have made a wrong prediction, he summoned him, showed him the new wheat, and had him executed. Just as he was about to eat, the duke felt bloated, went to the toilet, fell in and died. At noon, a slave carried the duke's body out of the toilet. Earlier that morning, the slave had a dream that he was carrying his lord to the heavens. Consequently, the slave was buried with the duke to serve him in the afterlife. This vivid account has given rise to a chengyu (four-character cl*ical idiom), \u75c5\u5165\u818f\u8093 ('the disease has entered the gaohuang'), used to describe an incurable illness, or more broadly, a situation beyond remediation.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nDuke Wu\n\nDuke Xian\n\nXiqi\n\nZhuozi\n\nDuke Hui\n\nDuke Huai\n\nDuke Wen\n\nDuke Xiang\n\nDuke Ling\n\nDuke Cheng\n\nDuke Jing\n\nDuke Li\n\nDuke Dao\n\nDuke Ping\n\nDuke Zhao\n\nDuke Qing\n\nDuke Ding\n\nDuke Chu\n\nDuke Jing\n\nDuke You\n\nDuke Lie\n\nDuke Huan\n\nReunited periodAfter Par*ion"}, {"url": "http://www.china.org.cn/learning_chinese/idioms/2010-08/18/content_20737200.htm", "page_content": "During the Warring States Period (475-221 BC), the State of Chu became less powerful during the reign of King Xiang. The king and his important court officials were dissolute and incompetent and indulged themselves in luxury and excessive pleasure. Zhuang Xin, one of the ministers, foresaw that the country would soon be in danger. One day, he remonstrated with the king: \"Your Majesty, wherever you go, you're always surrounded by people who flatter you. They do everything to make you happy so that you forget to tend to state affairs. If you go on like this, sooner or later, the country will perish.\"\n\nThe King of Chu flew into a rage. \"How dare you! You even use such vicious words to curse my country and mean to arouse resentment among the people!\" Zhuang Xin explained, \"I dare not curse the State of Chu. But I really have a premonition that Chu is facing great danger.\" Seeing that the king was especially fond of those corrupt officials and trusted them in everything, the minister thought Chu was bound for extinction. So he asked the king to let him leave Chu. He wanted to go to the State of Zhao and stay there for a while.\n\nThe king gave him the leave. Five months later, the King of Qin sent his troops to invade Chu and occupied a large tract of its territory. The King of Chu himself went into exile. Now, the king remembered Zhuang Xin's words. He sent his men to fetch him. Seeing Zhuang Xin again, the king asked him, \"What can I do now?\"\n\nZhuang Xin replied, \"It's not too late if you mend the sheepfold when finding a sheep is missing.\" He then made some good suggestions to rehabilitate the state and recover the lost land. The king was very pleased.\n\nThe idiom \"Mend the fold after a sheep is lost\" comes from Zhuang Xin's answer to the king. We still use this metaphor to advise someone that even when he has made a mistake and suffered losses, he can still remedy it by drawing lessons from the mistake.\n\nw\u00e1ng y\u00e1ng b\u01d4 l\u00e1o\n\n\u4ea1\u7f8a\u8865\u7262\n\n\u6218\u56fd\u65f6\u671f\uff0c\u695a\u8944\u738b\u7edf\u6cbb\u695a\u56fd\u65f6\uff0c\u56fd\u52bf\u4e0d\u632f\u3002\u695a\u738b\u548c\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5927\u81e3\u90fd\u8352\u6deb\u65e0\u80fd\uff0c\u4e00\u76f4\u6c89\u6eba\u4e8e\u5962\u4f88\u4eab\u4e50\u4e4b\u4e2d\u3002\u5927\u81e3\u5e84\u8f9b\u9884\u89c1\u5230\u695a\u56fd\u4f1a\u53d1\u751f\u5371\u9669\u3002\u4e00\u5929\uff0c\u4ed6\u529d\u8c0f\u695a\u738b\u8bf4\uff1a\u201c\u965b\u4e0b\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u60a8\u8d70\u5230\u54ea\u513f\uff0c\u8eab\u65c1\u603b\u662f\u90a3\u4e9b\u5949\u627f\u60a8\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u60f3\u5c3d\u529e\u6cd5\u8ba9\u60a8\u9ad8\u5174\uff0c\u60a8\u5c31\u5fd8\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u56fd\u4e8b\u3002\u957f\u6b64\u4ee5\u5f80\uff0c\u56fd\u5bb6\u8fdf\u65e9\u4f1a\u706d\u4ea1\u7684\u3002\u201d\n\n\u695a\u738b\u5927\u6012\uff1a\u201c\u5927\u80c6\uff01\u4f60\u5c45\u7136\u7528\u8fd9\u6837\u6076\u6bd2\u7684\u8bdd\u6765\u8bc5\u5492\u6211\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\uff0c\u84c4\u610f\u6311\u8d77\u4eba\u6c11\u7684\u4e0d\u6ee1\uff01\u201d \u5e84\u8f9b\u89e3\u91ca\u8bf4\uff1a\u201c\u6211\u4e0d\u6562\u8bc5\u5492\u695a\u56fd\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u9884\u8a00\u695a\u56fd\u6b63\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u5371\u9669\u3002\u201d \u5e84\u8f9b\u89c1\u695a\u738b\u5982\u6b64\u5ba0\u4fe1\u90a3\u4e9b\u8150\u8d25\u7684\u5927\u81e3\uff0c\u76f8\u4fe1\u695a\u56fd\u5fc5\u5b9a\u8981\u4ea1\u56fd\u3002\u4e8e\u662f\u4ed6\u8bf7\u6c42\u695a\u738b\u8ba9\u4ed6\u79bb\u5f00\u695a\u56fd\uff0c\u5230\u8d75\u56fd\u5c45\u4f4f\u4e00\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\n\n\u695a\u738b\u540c\u610f\u4e86\uff0c\u4ed6\u4fbf\u53bb\u4e86\u8d75\u56fd\u3002\u4e94\u4e2a\u6708\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u79e6\u541b\u679c\u7136\u6d3e\u519b\u5165\u4fb5\u695a\u56fd\uff0c\u5360\u9886\u4e86\u5927\u7247\u571f\u5730\u3002\u695a\u738b\u88ab\u8feb\u6d41\u4ea1\u3002\u8fd9\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u60f3\u8d77\u4e86\u5e84\u8f9b\u7684\u529d\u8c0f\uff0c\u4e8e\u662f\u6d3e\u4eba\u63a5\u5e84\u8f9b\u56de\u6765\u3002\u695a\u738b\u89c1\u4e86\u5e84\u8f9b\uff0c\u4fbf\u95ee\uff1a\u201c\u73b0\u5728\u6211\u8be5\u600e\u4e48\u529e\u5462\uff1f\u201d\n\n\u5e84\u8f9b\u56de\u7b54\u8bf4\uff1a\u201c\u4e22\u4e86\u7f8a\uff0c\u5c31\u628a\u7f8a\u5708\u4fee\u597d\uff0c\u4e0d\u7b97\u8fdf\u3002\u201d\u7136\u540e\u4ed6\u63d0\u51fa\u8bb8\u591a\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u632f\u56fd\u5bb6\u3001\u6536\u590d\u5931\u5730\u7684\u597d\u8c0b\u7565\u3002\u695a\u738b\u975e\u5e38\u9ad8\u5174\u3002"}, {"url": "http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/zhou-event-chunqiu.html", "page_content": "Oct 3, 2018 \u00a9 Ulrich Theobald\n\nThe Spring and Autumn period (Chunqiu \u6625\u79cb, 770-5th cent. BCE) is the first part of the so-called Eastern Zhou period (Dongzhou \u6771\u5468, 770-221 BCE). It is characterized by a significant decrease of political power of the kings of Zhou which had to flee to the eastern capital Chengzhou \u6210\u5468 (or Luoyi \u96d2\u9091, modern Luoyang \u6d1b\u967d, Henan) after their western and main capital Zongzhou \u5b97\u5468 (of Feng \u8c50, near modern Xi'an \u897f\u5b89, Shaanxi) had been attacked by the nomad tribes of the Quanrong \u72ac\u620e.\n\nPeriodization\n\nThe name of the historical period is derived from the chronicle of the regional state of Lu \u9b6f called Chunqiu \u6625\u79cb \"Spring and Autumn Annals\" because the seasons are always mentioned in the entries. The Annals cover the time from 722 to 481 BCE, yet the historical period is traditionally counted from the reign of King Ping of Zhou \u5468\u5e73\u738b (r. 770-720 BCE), who restored the Zhou dynasty in Luoyang, down to the division of the state of Jin \u6649 by the regional rulers (zhuhou \u8af8\u4faf) of Han \u97d3, Wei \u9b4f and Zhao \u8d99 in 376. Alternatively, the end of the Spring and Autumn period can be seen as 453, when the three viscounts (zi \u5b50) of Han, Wei and Zhao extinguished all other lateral lines to the house of Jin, or 403, when King Weilie of Zhou \u5468\u5a01\u70c8\u738b (r. 426-402) bestowed upon the viscounts of Han, Wei and Zhao the title of marquis (hou \u4faf).\n\nThe second great historiographical writing of the Spring and Autumn period is the collection Guoyu \u570b\u8a9e \"Discourses of the states\" that includes anecdotes of the states of Zhou \u5468, Lu \u9b6f, Qi \u9f4a, Jin \u6649, Zheng \u912d, Chu \u695a, Wu \u5433 and Yue \u8d8a. Said to be a composition of Zuo Qiuming \u5de6\u4e18\u660e, its oldest parts must have been compiled at the end of the 5th century BCE.\n\nConfucius\n\nThe most important intellectual person of this historical period was the philosopher Confucius (Kongzi \u5b54\u5b50; ca. 551-479) who tried to revive the ideal of the human and righteous rulers of old. Although his ideas seemed lost in a time of political realism his thoughts about state and society (\"Confucianism\") were to become the fundamental doctrine of imperial China.\n\nThe Early Decades of the Eastern Zhou and the Duke of Zheng\n\nThe eastern capital Chengzhou (Luoyang) did not provide the kings of Zhou with sufficient power. They were therefore dependent on the powerful regional rulers, especially those of Qin \u79e6, Jin, Qi and Chu. These are called the \"local rulers\" (fang bo \u65b9\u4f2f) because they practically ruled independently from the king of Zhou, and not any more as his vassals. It became common that the regional states acted on their own behalf regarding territory and military feuds, without asking the king of Zhou for formal permission. Duke Zhuang of Zheng \u912d\u838a\u516c (r. 743-701) even dared attacking King Huan \u5468\u6853\u738b (r. 720-697 BCE) who had not treated him properly according to the ritual regulations. Heijian \u9ed1\u80a9, the Duke of Zhou \u5468\u516c, even planned to kill King Huan's successor, King Zhuang \u5468\u838a\u738b (r. 697-682), and to replace him with Prince Ke \u514b. Yet Xin Bo \u8f9b\u4f2f warned the king and saved his life.\n\nDuke Zhuang of Zheng defeated intruding Rong \u620e tribes and swallowed the neighbouring state of Xu \u8a31. In 707 King Huan of Zhou \u5468\u6853\u738b (r. 719-697) started a punitive expedition against the Duke, but the king was defeated. From then on, the kings of Zhou never again tried to intervene into the politics of their own regional rulers. They stayed in their small royal domain around Luoyang and had to be content with the tributes of the regional rulers that were presented less and less regularly. Besides Zheng, the states of Song \u5b8b and Lu \u9b6f demonstrated their military and political power in the Central Plain.\n\nThe Rise of Duke Huan of Qi\n\nKing Li \u5468\u91d0\u738b (r. 682-677) was so helpless against the new threats endangering the empire that he allowed Duke Huan of Qi \u9f4a\u6853\u516c (r. 685-643) to adopt the title of hegemonial lord (ba \u9738, or bo \u4f2f). In this function the Duke defended the regional states against raids of barbarian tribes and cared for law and order among the states of the Middle Kingdom, with the motto \"support the king and ward off the barbarians\" (zun wang rang yi \u5c0a\u738b\u6518\u5937).\n\nIn the east, the state of Qi had rich natural ressources and became one of the mightiest regional states of the Eastern Zhou period.\n\nDuke Huan of Qi employed the legalist statesman Guan Zhong \u7ba1\u4ef2 as his adviser who reorganized administration and the military and financial systems. Through these reforms Qi was able to subdue Song and Lu and even the hegemonial state of Zheng. At that time, the non-Chinese nomad tribes of the Rong and Di \u72c4 undertook raids on the soil of Chinese states and devastated the states of Xing \u90a2 and Wei \u885b (modern Shanxi and Hebei). Duke Huan of Qi rescued the dynastic houses of these states and settled them down more to the south. The system of the hegemon thus developed to a kind of lord protector of a strong state over weaker ones, and Qi promised to protect the states in the Central Plain against further intrusions of the northern nomad warriors.\n\nThe Semi-Barbarian Kingdom of Chu\n\nIn the south, the state of Chu on the middle Yangtze River had become politically stronger than before. King Cheng of Chu \u695a\u6210\u738b (r. 671-626) started to challenge the hegemony of Qi and swallowed smaller states in his neighbourhood. Nonetheless, subservient states like Jiang \u6c5f and Huang \u9ec3 changed side and declared their alliance with Qi. Chu thereupon attacked Zheng. Duke Huan assembled the regional rulers and created an alliance with Lu, Song, Chen and Wei to punish Chu in 656 by devastating the state of Cai \u8521, an ally of Chu. Chu gave in, and the ambassadors of the two mighty states met at Shaoling \u53ec\u9675 (modern Yancheng \u90fe\u57ce, Henan) to conclude a peaceful alliance (meng \u76df).\n\nThe System of Hegemonial Lordship\n\nIn 651 Qi organized a meeting at Kuiqiu \u8475\u4e18 (modern Lankao \u862d\u8003, Henan) whith the representatives of Lu, Song, Zheng and Wei, and in presence of a royal diplomat from Zhou. The members of the meeting decided that states creating a friendly alliance should never attack each other, and that they had to assist each other in case that one partner was attacked. The Duke of Qi thus became the overlord over the weaker states of Zhou China and replaced the king of Zhou as the highest judicial person.\n\nSuccession Crises at the Zhou Court\n\nWhen King Li died a succession crisis endangered the house of Zhou. His righteous heir was Prince Kan \u95ac, who is known as King Hui \u5468\u60e0\u738b (r. 677-652), but his late grandfather, King Zhuang, had had a favourite son called Prince Tui \u7a68. King Hui was not a very intelligent ruler. He offended many of his highest ministers and caused a rebellion that forced him to flee to Wen \u6eab (modern Wenxian \u6eab\u7e23, Henan) and then to Li \u6adf, a town in the state of Zheng. His uncle Prince Tui was made King of Zhou, but he did not prove a better ruler. He was therefore attacked and killed by the lords of Zheng and Guo \u8662. King Hui returned to the throne.\n\nWhen King Hui died he was succeeded by his son Prince Zheng \u912d, who is known as King Xiang \u5468\u8944\u738b (r. 652-619). King Xiang had a half-brother called Shudai \u53d4\u5e36 (or Dai \u5e36), who had been the favourite son of King Hui. Prince Shudai planned to usurp the throne and joined forces with the Rong and Di \u7fdf tribes. The plot failed and Prince Shudai fled to Qi. It was a high minister of Qi, the reformer Guan Zhong, who mediated the peace treaty between the house of Zhou and the Rong tribes. A decade later the king of Zhou even allowed Prince Shudai to return.\n\nWhen the state of Zheng attacked in 639 the statelet of Hua \u6ed1, whose lords were relatives to the house of Zhou, King Xiang sent You Sun \u6e38\u5b6b and Bo Fu \u4f2f\u670d as diplomats to negotiate peace. Yet the Duke of Zheng arrested the diplomats. The King thereupon ordered the Di tribes to attack Zheng, inspite of the remonstances of minister Fu Chen \u5bcc\u8fb0. Fu Chen was also not content with the King's will to marry a Di princess in order to reward the Di chieftain for his support. His critics were justified because only a few years later King Xiang discarded the \"barbarian\" queen, which caused an attack of the Di on the royal capital, during which the Earl of Tan \u8b5a (or the earls of Yuan \u539f and Mao \u6bdb) was/were killed. Fu Chen thereupon threw himself into battle against the intruders and died. King Xiang fled to Zheng and was received by the duke of Zheng, in spite of all former discrepancies.\n\nIn the meantime Prince Dai was enthroned as King of Zhou, yet he took residence in Wen, not in Luoyang. He invited the Di queen to return to the royal domain. Two years later King Xiang asked the duke of Jin for help, who willingly attacked the usurper and executed him. King Xiang, returning to the throne, rewarded Duke Wen of Jin \u6649\u6587\u516c (r. 636-628) with the title of hegemonial lord and presented him with some territory. Duke Wen was thereafter the most powerful political leader of the Middle Kingdom and assembled the regional rulers, including his formal superior, the King of Zhou, at Heyang \u6cb3\u967d and Jiantu \u8e10\u571f. The kings of Zhou were now wholly dependent from support by other political actors. Histories nevertheless concealed this shameful situation with terms like \"royal hunt at Heyang\".\n\nThe Rise of the Regional State of Jin\n\nAfter the death of Duke Huan of Qi several regional rulers strove for overlordship. Duke Xiang of Song \u5b8b\u8944\u516c (r. 650-637) was defeated by Chu, and the state of Song lost its last chance to rise to political and military significance. Instead, the state of Jin rose to supremacy in old China: Duke Xian of Jin \u6649\u737b\u516c (r. 676-651) had already extended the power of his state by swallowing the statelets of Geng \u803f, Huo \u970d, Wei \u9b4f (a state that was later one of the three destructors of Jin), Guo \u8662 and Yu \u865e. After a decade of inner struggles, the state of Qin supported Duke Wen of Jin in his ascension to the throne of Jin.\n\nJust as Duke Huan of Qi, Duke Wen of Jin employed political advisors, Zhao Shuai \u8d99\u8870 (Zhao Chengzi \u8d99\u6210\u5b50) and Hu Yan \u72d0\u5043, who strengthened the \"national\" economy and so the military power of the state. In 635 the King Xiang of Zhou escaped from inner disturbances to the state of Zheng. Duke Wen of Jin saw his chance, rescued the king and accompanied him back to the royal domain, for which support he was highly rewarded by the King.\n\nThe next step for the Duke was to challenge the power of the southern, semi-Chinese state of Chu that had dominated the Central Plain since the death of Duke Huan of Qi. In 632 the two states clashed at the battle of Chengpu \u57ce\u6fee (modern Zhencheng \u7504\u57ce, Shandong), and Chu was defeated. Duke Wen of Jin established a new friendly alliance during the meeting at Jiantu \u8e10\u571f (modern Yingze \u6ece\u6fa4, Henan) with the seven most important states. In the same year, at Wen, the King of Zhou sanctified the hegemony by Jin. Duke Wen's successor Duke Xiang \u6649\u8944\u516c (r. 627-621) was able to prolong the hegemonial prevalence of the state of Jin.\n\nConflict Between Qin and Jin\n\nDuring the reign of Duke Xiang of Jin, Duke Mu of Qin \u79e6\u7a46\u516c (r. 659-621) opened a long period of military confrontation between Jin and Qin, but Qin seldomly won any battle. The powerful state of Jin blocked the gate to the Central Plain, and Qin could not but expand its territory to the west into the territory of the Western Rong tribes \u897f\u620e and establish good relations with Chu in the south. Chu meanwhile further expanded its territory by conquering the statelets of Jiang \u6c5f, Lu \u516d (a special reading!), and Liao \u84fc. After the death of Duke Xiang of Jin, the noble Zhao Dun \u8d99\u76fe (Zhao Xuanzi \u8d99\u5ba3\u5b50) dominated the throne succession of Jin, murdered Duke Ling \u6649\u9748\u516c (r. 620-607) and enthroned Duke Cheng \u6649\u6210\u516c (r. 606-600). During this period Jin lost its initiative in \"foreign\" politics. The political advisor Fan Shan \u8303\u5c71 proposed to King Mu of Chu \u695a\u7a46\u738b (r. 625-614) to take the chance and to advance against the north.\n\nThe Rise of the State of Chu\n\nKing Zhuang of Chu \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 613-591) had to resolve internal quarrels and uprisings of aboriginal tribes before he was able to reform economic and military administration and to resume this expansion politics. In 606 the southern king sent out an envoy to the court of King Ding of Zhou \u5468\u5b9a\u738b (r. 606-586) to express his will to swallow the royal domain of Zhou. In 598 King Zhuang of Chu crushed the small state of Chen \u9673, one year later the state of Zheng. At the battle of Bi \u90b2 (near modern Zhengzhou \u912d\u5dde, Henan) the army of the hegemonial state of Jin was defeated.\n\nA few years later, Chu defeated the state of Song and finally obtained the overlordship over the Central Plain. The protecting task of the overlord had gradually lost its original intention and became a system of hegemony of one major state over weak satellites of Chinese and \"barbarian\" origin. The attitude to help small states during internal quarrels and against \"barbarian\" invaders changed to a regular intervention into political affairs to the advantage of the great states.\n\nInternal Quarrels in Jin\n\nThe state of Qi observed the growing power of Chu, declared a friendly relationship with the southern king of Chu, who was the only regional ruler who called himself king, except, of course, the King of Zhou. Qi repeatedly attacked the smaller states of Lu and Wei which therefore asked for support the former hegemonial state of Jin. In 589, the army of Jin fought with Qi in the battle of An \u978d (modern Jinan \u6fdf\u5357, Shandong) and once again demonstrated its superior military power. Chu instantly declared war to Jin, but neither Chu nor Jin dared to initiate a concrete campaign.\n\nAfter long years of hesitation and negotiations (under the stipulation of Jin's political advisor Song Huayuan \u5b8b\u83ef\u5143) Chu attacked Zheng and Wei in 576. One year later the armies of the two hegemonial states fought in the famous battle of Yanling \u9122\u9675 (modern Yanling, Henan) in which Jin prevailed by a narrow margin. Duke Li of Jin \u6649\u53b2\u516c (r. 580-573) saw his chance to resume hegemony, murdered his mightiest noblemen Xi Zhi \u90e4\u81f3, Xi Qi \u90e4\u9321 and Xi Chou \u90e4\u72a8 (the \"Three Xi\" \u4e09\u90e4). Yet instead of having strengthened his own position, Duke Li faced serious opposition by the Jin aristocracy like Luan Shu \u6b12\u66f8 and Xun Yan \u8340\u5043 who eventually killed their lord.\n\nUnder the next ruler, Duke Dao \u6649\u60bc\u516c (r. 572-558), the internal situation calmed down, and the duke was able to strengthen the position of the state of Jin. His political advisor Wei Jiang \u9b4f\u7d73 proposed to appease the nomad warriors of the Rong with financial tributes instead of fighting them. In 571 Jin erected a fortification wall at Hulao \u864e\u7262 (modern Fanshui \u6c3e\u6c34, Henan) against the state of Zheng that was backed by Chu.\n\nAfter more than two decades of relative peace the political advisor Song Xiangxu \u5b8b\u5411\u620c proposed to organize a peace conference to end military conflict. It was held in the capital of Jin in 546 and the participating fourteeen states decided to accept the overlordship of the two states of Jin and Chu. Their adherents had to declare their subjection under the respective overlordship and to present tributes to the two hegemons. Among the participating states, there would be ten years of peace, and for more than fourty years, Jin and Chu would not meet at the battle field again.\n\nOnly two of the larger states did not participate in the general peace: Qi, and Qin.\n\nThe old kingdom of Zhou had totally lost its political role. The tributes once paid to the kings of Zhou were now offered to the dukes of Jin and the kings of Chu. If a small state did not pay tribute it had to expect military sanctions. Especially precarious was the role of the state of Lu that had to maintain good relationships to the three states of Jin, Chu and Qi, if it did not want to be swallowed by one of them. Very similar was the role of Zheng that was directly in the line of fire between Jin and Chu. But states like Lu also imitated the overlordship of their own masters and demanded tributes from yet smaller states like Teng \u6ed5, Qi \u675e or Zeng \u912b.\n\nThe Rise of the Semi-Barbarian States of Wu and Yue\n\nDuring the relatively peaceful sixth century, the two southern non-Chinese coastal states of Wu \u5433 and Yue \u8d8a emerged as new powers. Jin saw its chance to open a second flank against Chu, and in 583 Duke Wuchen of Shen \u7533\u516c\u5deb\u81e3 was sent to Wu in order to seek a military alliance. The semi-barbarian state of Wu was equipped with military tools and Wu soldiers were trained to attack Chu. But it was only more than half a century later that Wu became a serious threat to Chu after swallowing the statelet of Xu \u5f90.\n\nUnder King Hel\u00fc \u95d4\u95ad (r. 514-496) the political advisor Wu Yuan \u4f0d\u54e1 proposed to raise three armies that clockwise were to skirmish at the borders of Chu to weaken this state. In 506 the whole army of Wu finally attacked Chu and defeated this state at Baiju or Boju \u67cf\u8209 (modern Macheng \u9ebb\u57ce, Hubei). In pursuit of the escaping enemy, the army of Wu advanced to the capital of Chu, Yingdu \u90e2\u90fd (modern Jiangling \u6c5f\u9675, Hebei). King Zhao of Chu \u695a\u662d\u738b (r. 516-489) had to take his flight and sought for help in Qin. This western state sent out chariots that expelled the invaders from Wu.\n\nWu's neighbour Yue took the advantage of the prolonged campaigns against Chu to invade Wu. In 496, Wu set its troops into march to carry out a punitive expedition against Yue, but King Hel\u00fc died in the battle of Zuili \u6a87\u674e (modern Jiaxing \u5609\u8208, Zhejiang). Two years later, King Fucha \u592b\u5dee of Wu (r. 495-473) defeated Yue during the revenge battle of Fujiao \u592b\u6912 (modern Suzhou \u8607\u5dde, Jiangsu). Goujian \u53e5\u8e10, king of Yue (r. 496-465), fled to Mount Guiji \u6703\u7a3d\u5c71 (south of modern Shaoxing \u7d39\u8208, Zhejiang).\n\nAlthough Fucha's advisor Wu Yuan proposed to destroy the state of Yue, the king of Wu was content with his success in battle and the destruction of the capital of Yue. After the defeat of Chu and Yue, King Fucha turned his attention to the north. He had a fortification wall built at Han \u9097 (near modern Yangzhou \u63da\u5dde, Jiangsu) and dug out canals (see Grand Canal) that connected the Yangtze River with the Huai River \u6dee\u6c34 valley, creating a traffic line to the north and the possibility to move troops faster. The small states of Lu and Zhu \u90be declared themselves subjects to Wu. In the years 485 and 484 Wu attacked several times the state of Qi by land and by river and finally defeated Qi in the battle of Ailing \u827e\u9675 (modern Laiwu \u840a\u856a, Shandong). Wu assembled the states of the Central Plain to a meeting at Huangchi \u9ec3\u6c60 (modern Fengqiu \u5c01\u4e18, Henan), with the intention to declare its hegemony. Jin, weakened by internal struggles, did not dare to challenge the new powerful state of Wu, and King Fucha became the new hegemon.\n\nJust during the conference of Huangchi, King Goujian of Yue took the chance and invaded the capital of Wu. The overstretched military power of the state of Wu was unable to withstand the southern opponent who had rebuilt its strength after the defeat of Guiji. In 473, Yue destroyed the state of Wu and replaced it as the dominating power of the southeast. King Goujian of Yue was the last of the so-called Five Hegemons (Wuba \u4e94\u9738).\n\nThe Five Hegemons are also called the \"Five Earls\" (Wubo \u4e94\u4f2f). Different literary sources and commentaries identify them with different persons. The traditional definition by Zhao Qi \u8d99\u5c90 defines them as Duke Huan of Qi, Duke Wen of Jin, Duke Mu of Qin, Duke Xiang of Song, and King Zhuang of Chu. The book Xunzi \u8340\u5b50 identifies them with Duke Huan of Qi, Duke Wen of Jin, King Zhuang of Chu, King Hel\u00fc of Wu and King Goujian of Yue.\n\nThe Disintegration of the Old Order of Regional States\n\nIn the mid-5th century BCE there were four states that dominated old China: Chu in the south, Yue in the southwest, Jin in the north, and Qi in the east. Yet things were to change soon: Inner conflicts toppled two of the reigning houses (Jin and Qi), new powers emerged (Wei \u9b4f, Zhao \u8d99 and Han \u97d3), and reforms in the administration of several states created a new type of \"modernized\" regional state: the centralized state with a strengthened \"national\" economy and a professional army. The administration of the state by nobles related to the ruling house was replaced by a bureaucratic officialdom.\n\nThe state Lu was the first that felt the power of noble families which challenged the ducal house, in this case the Three Huan (Sanhuan \u4e09\u6853, descendants of Duke Huan \u9b6f\u6853\u516c) the Jisun \u5b63\u5b6b, Mengsun \u5b5f\u5b6b (Zhongsun \u4ef2\u5b6b) and Shusun \u53d4\u5b6b. From the time of Duke Xi \u9b6f\u50d6\u516c (r. 659-627) on these three noble families dominated the state of Lu. Duke Zhao \u9b6f\u662d\u516c (r. 541-510) even had to escape from their intrigues and died abroad. At the beginning of the fifth century minor nobles like Nan Kuai \u5357\u84af, Yang Hu \u967d\u864e and Hou Fan \u4faf\u72af rebelled against the mighty families and took over the rule of Lu.\n\nDescendants of the dukes of Song fought for the domination within the small state: the families Hua \u83ef, Yue \u6a02, Lao \u8001, Huang \u7687 (descendants of Duke Dai \u5b8b\u6234\u516c, r. 799-766), Yu \u9b5a, Dang \u8569, Lin \u9c57 and Xiang \u5411 (descendants of Duke Huan \u5b8b\u6853\u516c, r. 681-651). In the permanent power struggles only the families Yue and Huang survived the Spring and Autumn period.\n\nThe seven descendant lineages of Duke Mu of Zheng \u912d\u7a46\u516c (r. 627-606) also gradually lost their power in the course of the Spring and Autum period.\n\nIn the state of Qi, the government was led by the lineages of Guo \u570b, Gao \u9ad8, Cui \u5d14 and Qing \u6176. In this state it was a family not related to the ducal house that took over power in Qi: the family Tian \u7530, descendants of a prince from Chen, Tian Jingzhong \u7530\u656c\u4ef2, who had come to Qi in 672 while escaping internal disturbances in Chen. Under Duke Jing \u9f4a\u666f\u516c (r. 547-490), Jingzhong's descendant Tian Qi \u7530\u4e5e was ennobled and from this position collected wealth and power enough to annihilate the families Guo and Gao. His son Tian Chang \u7530\u5e38 was already wealthier than the Duke himself and sent his ambassadors to the neighbouring states. His descendants would eventually replace the reigning house in Qi.\n\nThe most tremendous power challenge from within took place in the state of Jin where descendants of the ducal line were not invested as regional governors (dafu \u5927\u592b). But this measure did not prevent other noble families from trying to dominate the court of Jin: Hu \u72d0, Zhao \u8d99, Xian \u5148, Xi \u90e4 and Xu \u80e5 were the dominating noble clans of the middle Spring and Autumn period, and were later replaced by the families Han \u97d3, Wei \u9b4f, Luan \u6b12, Fan \u8303 and Xun \u8340. At the beginning of the 5th century the noble families of Zhao, Wei, Han, Fan, Zhonghang \u4e2d\u884c and Zhi \u667a survived the internal struggle. The three first could destroy the last three and dissolved the dukedom of Jin, dividing its territory among themselves.\n\nDuring the reign of King Ding of Zhou \u5468\u5b9a\u738b (r. 607-586), the southern ruler King Zhuang of Chu \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 613-591) advanced his armies as far as the valley of River Luo in the pursuit of the Rong tribes of Luhun \u9678\u6e3e. The king of Chu used this situation pay the king of Zhou a visit, but King Ding only sent Prince Man \u6eff (\"Royal Grandson Man\" \u738b\u5b6b\u6eff) to confer with the semi-barbarian king of Chu. They talked about the so-called \"nine tripods\" (jiuding \u4e5d\u9f0e) erected in the capital that symbolized the nine regions of the kingdom of Zhou.\n\nAfter the death of King Ling of Zhou \u5468\u9748\u738b (r. 572-545) and during the reign of King Jing \u5468\u666f\u738b (r. 545-521) a succession crisis beset the house of Zhou. The heir apparent, Prince Sheng \u8056, had died prematurely. King Jing preferred his oldest son Prince Chao \u671d, yet when the king died, Prince Gai \u4e10 was supported by a strong party among the courtiers. The highest ministers enthroned Prince Meng \u731b, who was immediately attacked and killed by the adherents of Prince Chao. Prince Meng is posthumously known as King Dao \u5468\u60bc\u738b (r. 521-520). Prince Chao proclaimed himself king of Zhou, yet Prince Gai on his side asked for support by the duke of Jin and finally made it to the throne. He is known as King Jing \u5468\u656c\u738b (r. 520-476). Prince Chao, who had reigned for four years, fled to Chu. In 504, when he had assembled a sufficient number of supporters, he attacked King Jing and forced him to flee to Jin. A year later Duke Ding of Jin \u6649\u5b9a\u516c (r. 512-475) helped King Jing back on the throne."}, {"url": "http://chinese-history.net/the-early-eastern-zhou-spring-and-autumn-and-warring-states-periodstransition-from-slavery-to-feudalism/", "page_content": "The Early Eastern Zhou and the Spring and Autumn Period:Contentino for Supremacy Among the Major States\n\nIn 770B.C., King Ping moved the centre of political power eastward to Luoyi(presentday Luoyang), and the Eastern Zhou Dynasty came into being. In 256 B.C. the Eastern Zhou came to an end after 514 years of existence under 25 successive kings. The period from 722B.C., 49 years after the Zhou capital was moved east, to 481 B.C. is known to historians as the Spring and Autumn Period and the subsequent period, to 221B.C., is know as the Warring States Period.\n\nThe eastward move by the Zhou was an important political event. This was followed by annexation among the vassal states. During the Spring and Autumn Period, big states conquered 30 or more small states, some as many as 40 or 50 small states. It is said that there were 1,800 states under the Western Zhou, but the number dwindled to 100 by the Spring and Autumn Period as the result of conquest and annexation. Of the 100 only about a dozen were politically significant. During the Warring States Period, only 7 states, plus a few smaller ones, remained before they were finally absorbed by the Qin. The early years of the Eastern Zhou, the Spring and Autumn Period, and the Warring States Period were all marked by great upheaval.\n\nAfter moving his capital to the east, King Ping reestablished the power of the dynasty with the help of such states as Jin, Zheng, Wei and Qin. He relied particularly on Jin and Zheng for support. The capital of Zheng was located at modern Huaxian , Shaanxi Province; it was then moved to modern Xinzheng , Henan Province, at the time when the Eastern Zhou moved its capital. Duke Zhuang of Zheng was active politically during the first two decades of the Spring and Autumn Period. Jin, located in the southern section of modern Shaanxi Province , was a state of fertile land where Han communities were interspersed with Rong and Di tribes. It gained considerable strength during the first few years of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty. Qin, a new- comer among the states, grew in power amidst struggles against the Rong; it extended its jurisdiction to the eastern section of modern Gansu Province and the central section of modern Shaanxi Province . Among the strong powers of this time were Jin, Qin, Qi (in today\u2019s Shandong Province ) and Chu (in the Changjiang and Huanghe river basins and the southern section of modern Henan Province ). Because of its continuing expansion to the north, Chu became a formidable threat to the northern states and an object of their defence. In 679 B.C., Duke Huan of Qi stopped the civil war in Song; then he called a meeting that was attended by the various states and thus established the supremacy of his state. The state was set for the contention of power, of which the previous 90 years had been only a preparatory stage.\n\nDuke Huan designated a statesman named Guan Zhong to carry out reforms, the purpose of which was to build up a rich state with strong armed forces. He succeeded in uniting some of the vassal lords by invoking the slogan of \u201cloyalty to the King of Zhou\u201d and by put-ting up strong resistance against Chu , Rong, and Di that had been a menace to the allied states. As the Bei Rong ( Northern Rong ) was harassing the state of Yan and as the Di was attacking the state of Xing after having conquered the state of Wei, Qi supported Yan in defeating the Bei Rong and helped Wei to reestablish itself, besides moving Xing to a safer region. In 656 B.C., Duke Huan led an alliance of Qi, Lu, Song, Zheng, Chen, Wei, Xu, and Cao to attack Cai and Chu . The allied army fought its way to Zhaoling (modem Yancheng , Henan Province) and forced Chu to pay tribute to the king of Zhou. Qi\u2019s su-premacy had now reached its apex. It is said that the great alliance headed by the duke met on nine occasions. At the wellknown confer- ence held at Kuiqiu (to the east of modem Lankao , Henan Province) in 651 B.C., a treaty to be observed by all the participants was signed. In 643 B.C., Duke Huan died, and his death was followed by intense contention for succession. Before long, hegemony passed to the state of Jin.\n\nDuke Wen of Jin was the second overlord of this period. He became the sovereign of his state when he was over 60, after nineteen years of exile during which he learned to understand contemporary society better than any other sovereign of his time. Hu Yan, Zhao Cui and others who had accompanied him during the exile were all out- standing political figures. Duke Wen ascended the throne in 636 B.C. and, the very next year, raised the slogan of \u201cloyalty to the King of Zhou\u201d. He brought back to the capital King Xiang of Zhou who had left the capital because of fratricidal fighting within the court itself. He also succeeded in putting down rebellions. In 632 B.C., the state of Chu led an alliance with Chen, Cai, Zheng and Xu in an attack against Song on account of the latter\u2019s pro-Jin policies. In response, Jin led the forces of Song, Qi and Qin and met the invaders at Chengpu (today\u2019s Linpu township to the southwest of Juancheng County , Shandong Province ) and decisively defeated them. For the first time, Chu suffered a serious setback in its expansion towards the north. The suc-cessful encounter enabled Duke Wen to enjoy a fame more widespread than that of Duke Huan of Qi. For next 80 years and more, the contention between Jin and Chu for supremacy was the dominant feature of Chinese history and each side had victories and losses. In597 B.C. Chu defeated Jin\u2019s forces at Bi (near modem Zhengzhou , Henan Province), and the victory made Duke Zhuang of Chu an overlord of the states.\n\nDuke Mu of Qin, aided by able statesmen, was also ambitiot He assisted two princes of Jin to return to their homeland as rule1 and Duke Wen of Jin was one of the two. In 627 BC., Duke Mu took the advantage of Duke Wen\u2019s death to launch a surprise attack on Zheng. He was defeated by Jin, and all his three generals were cap-tured. From then on as Qin could not expand much to the east, it concentrated its efforts on the west. As a result, Duke Mu became famous as an overlord in the western regions.\n\nWars among big states in the Huanghe River valley broug nothing but disasters to the small states which, as the bones of conte-tion, could not cope with the situation. In the meantime, the intermitent wars intensified the fighting within the ruling classes in each star, and the resulting rise and fall of different political forces left it powerless to cope with a big state\u2019s aggression. Not surprisingly, mar states were longing for a change. In 579 B.C. and again in 546 B.C.,the state of Song, which had suffered enormously from the warfae among the big states, called a peace conference. It succeeded in at taining its goal during the second conference. It was agreed that the eight small states of Song, Lu, Zheng, Wei, Cao, Xu, Chen and Cai would pay tribute to both Jin and Chu , and that the two big states of Qi and Qin would enter into an alliance relationship with Jin and Chu respectively. Thus Jin and Chu had an equal share of the supremacy. The agreement temporarily put an end to the contention for hegemony among the states in the Huanghe River valley.\n\nAfter the peace conference, China entered the late Spring and Autumn Period, which was marked by two important events: the In-tensification of struggle between the leading noble families and the houses of the sovereigns within each state and expansion to the Huanghe River area by two new states, Wu and Yue, that rose to prominence in the lower reaches of the Changjiang River.\n\nLike the overlords among rulers of the states, the leading noble families held real power within each state. After the death of Duke Wen, some nobles in Jin gradually attained prominence during wars against foreign states. By the late Spring and Autumn Period, political power in each state had passed from the sovereign to the nobles. Having no control over generals and soldiers, the sovereign led a life of luxury and self-indulgence and paid little attention to the lot of the common people. The nobles, on the other hand, were stronger than the ruler because they were supported by able advisers and armed forces. They also attached some importance to the winning of the masses. As a result, contradictions continued to sharpen between the sovereign and the nobles and among the nobles themselves. In the state of Jin, six noble families, Zhi, Zhao, Wei, Han, Fan and Zhonghang emerged and ruled the state among them. Later the Fan and Zhonghang families collapsed as a political force, and only four families remained active. In 453 B.C., Zhao, Wei and Han divided Zhi among them. The ground was then set for the three remaining families to divide the state of Jin whenever they liked.\n\nLike Jin, the noble families in Qi grew in power after the death of Duke Huan. Among them were Guo, Gao, Luan, B ao, Cui, Qing, Yan and Tian, the last one eventually overwhelming all the others by in-trigues and brutal force. In 489 B.C., the Tians went as far as killing the sovereign of Qi. They did the same thing again in 481 B.C. They held the political power in Qi beginning in 480 B.C. From then on, they could replace the sovereign of Qi anytime they wished.\n\nSmaller states had their noble families, too. In Lu, for example, there were the families of Jisun, Mengsun, and Shusun, all of whom had originally belonged to the ruling house. In 562 B.C., they divided the land and labourers of the ruling duke, virtually partitioning Lu into three separate states. The duke could only live on the tributes paid by the noble families.\n\nThe capital of Wu was located in today\u2019s Suzhou , Jiangsu Province. The ruling family of Wu had the same surname as the king of Zhou\u2019s, but the state later became a dependency of Chu . In 584 B.C., having learned archery and the use of war horses and chariots from the people of Jin, Wu strengthened its armed forces and began to commu-nicate with the northern states. The relationship between Wu and Chu also underwent a change. The prince of Wu, He Lia, appointed Wu Zixu to be his military adviser and Sun Wu commander of the army. In506 B.C., Wu launched five separate attacks against Chu and won them all. It captured Chu \u2018s capital Yingdu (now Jiangling County , Hubei Province). King Zhao of Chu fled, and the whole state was on the verge of being exterminated. Qin then sent troops to help Chu ; meanwhile, infighting broke out among the Wu aristocrats. Yue took advantage of the situation to attack Wu, and the latter was compelled, to withdraw from Chu .\n\nYue, whose capital was located at modern Shaoxing Counnty , Zhejiang Province, grew quickly in power with the help of Chu . Led by Prince Gou Jian, it defeated Wu in a decisive battle, in which Prince He Lu suffered an injury which led to his death. He was succeeded by his son Fu Chai, who sought revenge. In 494 B.C., Wu defeated Yue and reduced the latter to a dependency. Debasing himself as a Wu subject, Prince Gou Jian prepared to restore his state. In 482 B.C., when Prince Fu Chai was in the north to confer with other princes, Yue attacked and captured Wu\u2019s capital. In 473 B.C., it ended Wu\u2019s existence altogether.\n\nAfter victory over Yue, Prince Fu Chai of Wu had met with other princes at Huangchi (modern Fengqiu County , Henan Province) in his attempt to seize hegemony from the prince of Jin. After Yue defeated Wu, Prince Gou Jian also went to the north to confer with other prrinces for the same purpose. Both journeys indicated that the relationship between the north and the south had been greatly strengthened by then. The attempt of Wu and Yue to seize hegemony nevertheless marked the last days of the Spring and Autumn Period when the struggle for supremacy was no longer as significant as before.\n\nThe Seven Powers of the Warring States Period\n\nIn 403 B.C., Jin was divided into three independent states, Han,Zhao and Wei. In 386 B.C., the Tian family openly seized state power in Qi. These four states plus Qin, Chu and Yan are referred to by histo-rians as the seven powers of the Warring States Period. Geographi-cally Chu was located in the south, Zhao in the north, Yan in the northeast, Qin in the west, Qi in the east, and Han and Wei in the cen-tre. By this time, none of the states used the slogan of \u201cloyalty to the King of Zhou\u201d any more as Zhou had become a much smaller state. Instead of confrontation between Chu and the northern states of pring and Autumn Period, the seven powers of the Warring States Period contended with one another. Fierce fighting went on among the seven as each tried to annex its neighbours until Qin succeeded in conquering all the rival powers.\n\nGreater social changes took place during the Warring States Period than in the preceding period. Farsighted statesmen perceived these changes and took the initiative to expedite them politically. This brought up the issue of political reforms. During the earlier stage of this period there were men like Li Kui in Wei, Wu Qi in Chu , and later Shang Yang in Qin, whose reforms had a great impact on history.\n\nIn the early Warring States Period, Wei was a powerful and pros-perous state. Marquis Wen of Wei, as a monarch of high aspirations, searched for talented men and found Li Kui whom he put in charge of reforms. Li Kui, in his turn, appointed people according to their abil-ities instead of their social status, and gave high positions to those who had rendered meritorious services to the state. Having studied the budget of farmers, he realized their financial difficulties and proposed measures to raise production. He introduced a system of stabilizing grain prices whereby the government bought grain at a reasonable price during a good harvest and sold it at a reasonable price during a bad harvest. In this way, grain prices would not rise or fall drastically, and both producer and consumer would benefit and lead a more secure life. Measures of this kind played a significant role in maintaining social stability, strengthening the government, and building a rich and powerful Wei.\n\nWu Qi, a famous statesman and strategist, had won victories on the battlefield for both Lu and Wei. He had also distinguished himself as an administrator in Wei. Yet the aristocrats in both states rejected and persecuted him, and he had to leave Wei for Chu in 382 B.C. In Chu King Dao made him his chief minister. As chief minister, Wu Qi introduced new laws, invalidated sinecure, and abolished the privileges of the king\u2019s distant relatives. Money thus saved was used for the strengthening of the armed forces. He also stipulated that the enfeoffed land of the nobles must be returned to the state after three generations. These reform measures certainly benefited the state, but they aroused the resentment of the nobles. As soon as King Dao died in 381 B.C., the nobles sought him out and wanted to kill him. He died taking refuge behind the king\u2019s corpse, and some of the arrows aimed at him pierced the king\u2019s body as well. When the crown prince as-cended the throne and became King Su of Chu, he ordered the execu-tion of all the nobles who desecrated the late king\u2019s body while killing Wu Qi, and more than seventy families were eliminated as a result. The execution dealt a heavy blow to the conservative forces of Chu and provided new impetus to the development of the state.\u2019\n\nIn 359 B.C., Shang Yang launched his reform in Qin, a reform that historians regard as the most significant event in the Warring States Period. The reform also indicated that the middle stage of the Warring States Period had arrived.\n\nShang Yang was a native of Wei, and his surname was Gongsun. Shang was the title of his fief, and Yang his personal name. Having won the confidence of Duke Xiao of Qin, he began to introduce reforms. He made clear what the laws were, rewarding those who had distinguished themselves in farming or on the battlefield. The purpose was to strengthen monarchal rule. He abolished the landowning system of the past, promoted production by individual peasants, and car-ried out a policy of \u201celevating agriculture and downgrading com-merce\u201d. Land now could be sold or bought. Measures were adopted for a full utilization of labour power for agricultural development. For isntance, families with two or more male adults living in the same house were required to pay twice the amount of taxes compared to families with only one male adult. Those who harvested more grain or produced more silk would be exempted from corv6e, while merchants and those too lazy to work would be condemned to slavery together with their wives and children. Shang Yang abolished the traditional privileges of the nobles and introduced a new system in which there were 20 ranks of honour, which were granted to those who deserved them. Social hierarchy was clearily defined, and a person with rank would be entitled to an appropriate amount of land, houses, retainers, concubines, and clothing. A member of nobility who had not distin-guished himself on the battlefield would see his name deleted from the royal roster. On the other hand, he who had distinguished himself on the battlefield would be rewarded with honour, which was denied to those without military credit, no matter how wealthy they were. To establish a political system of autocratic monarchy, Shang Yang grouped all villages and towns of the state into 30 to 40 counties gov-erned by magistrates and their deputies, who were appointed and re-moved by the sovereign himself. He also divided households into groups of five or ten, responsible for one another\u2019s behaviour. Those who failed to report a criminal act would be cut in two at the waist; those who reported would be rewarded as if they had killed an enemy; those who harboured a criminal would be severely punished as if they had surrended to an enemy. Shang Yang also standardized and made uniform weights and measures.\n\nThese reforms were opposed by many people. When the crown prince Si broke the law, Shang Yang said that since the resistance to law enforcement came from above, the crown prince must be punished. However, since the culprit was the heir apparent and could not be punished, he punished the prince\u2019s two tutors instead. Those who opposed his reform were also punished. From then on, his reform became very effective. However, like Wu Qi, he aroused resentment as well. After the death of Duke Xiao, those who had opposed the reform wrongly accused him of having started a rebellion. Subsequently he and his whole family were put to death.\n\nThe reform of Shang Yang lasted more than twenty years and greatly strengthened Qin. Qin became a power held in awe by all other states. The reform also paved the way for the Qin rulers to realize their imperial ambition.\n\nIn the third year of Shang Yang\u2019s reform, Prince Wei ascended the throne in Qi. He rewarded the officials who had reclaimed wasteland and made people wealthy; he punished those who had failed to promote production, driven people to poverty, accepted bribes, or lied to the sovereign. He appointed Zou Ji to be the prime minister and put the strategist Sun Bin in charge of military reform. The purpose was to strengthen the state of Qi both politically and militarily.\n\nAs Qin and Qi became powerful, Wei, which had held a superior position during the early Warring States Period, now became a victim of attacks by both Qin and Qi and grew weak daily. However, Wei launched an attack on Zhao in the year 354 B.C. The next year Qi sent out troops to rescue Zhao at the latter\u2019s request. Qi\u2019s army, adopting Sun Bin\u2019s strategy, launched a sudden attack on Daliang (modem Kaifeng CitY, Henan Province), Wei\u2019s capital. The Wei forces were compelled to withdraw so as to defend their capital. The Qi army intercepted and routed Wei forces at Kuiling (to the west of modem Changyuan County, Henan Province). The strategy has come to be known in Chinese military history as \u201cbesieging Wei in order to rescue Zhao\u201d, or rescuing the besieged by attacking the base of the besiegers. In 342 B.C. Wei attacked Han; once again, Qi dispatched troops to help the victim. This time, Sun Bin lured the enemy to as far as Ma- ling (to the southwest of modem Daming County, Hebei Province) where the Qi army dealt him a severe blow. Wei\u2019s crown prince, Shen, was captured; Wei\u2019s general, Pang Juan, committed suicide. During the time when Shang Yang was carrying out his reforms, Qin made repeated attacks on Wei. In 352 B.C., Qin captured Anyi (modern Xiaxian County, Shanxi Province) of Wei. In 340 B.C., the Qin army, led by Shang Yang himself, attacked again and this time captured Wei\u2019s top commander, Prince Qiong. From then on, the Qin army repeatedly marched eastward, and Wei was forced to cede Yinjin (modem Huayin Couhty, Shaanxi Province) to Qin. The occupation of Yinjin provided the Qin army with a strategic passageway for ad-vancing eastward. Wei was forced to cede its land west of the Huanghe, enabling Qin to use the river as natural barrier.\n\nThe war between Wei on one side and Qi and Qin on the other weakened Wei considerably and gave Qin footholds in its march east-ward. Qin also defeated YiqurongI to its west and exterminated Shu2 in the south, and grew more powerful as a result. The six other states, threatened by Qin, were susceptible to the idea that they should form an alliance for defence. As the allies had contradictions among them- selves, the alliance was anything but solid. Qin took advantage of this situation and tried to separate them from one another. It persuaded each of them to form an alliance with it instead. Qi and Chu had a treaty of alliance between them, but Qin succeeded in making the treaty ineffective and repeatedly attacked Chu, which lost both men and territory in the process. In 299 B.C., Prince Huai of Chu went to Qin with which he was hoping to form an alliance, but he was held as a captive at Qin\u2019s capital Xianyang, where he later died. From then on, Chu became weaker and weaker.\n\nAs Qin and Chu fought against each other, changes also took place in Zhao, Qi and Yan. In 307 B.C., Prince Wuling of Zhao carried out military reforms by organizing a powerful cavalry and clothing the cavalry men in the style of nomadic peoples, making it easier for them to ride and to shoot their arrows. Qi, taking advantage of the internal turmoil of Yan, attacked and captured its capital in 314 B.C. The in-vader killed Prince Kuai and stationed troops on Yan\u2019s soil. In 284 B.C., Prince Zhao of Yan dispatched general Yue Yi to attack Qi and, in five years, took more than seventy cities, leaving only two cities still in Qi\u2019s control. Prince Zhao died in 279 B.C., and his successor, being suspicious of Yue Yi, replaced him with Qi Jie as commander. Qi\u2019s general Tian Dan took advantage of Yue Yi\u2019s absence by launching an offensive and succeeded in routing Yan\u2019s army. He killed Qi Jie and recovered the lost territories. The war between Qi and Yan, lasting 35 years, exhausted the strength of both, weakening the eastern states in their confrontation with Qin in the west. As the war between Qi and Yan lingered on, Qin launched an all-out offensive against Chu and succeeded in taking over half of the latter\u2019s territory. Finally, in278 B.C., Qin\u2019s army marched into Chu \u2018s capital, Ying. By then the later stage of the Warring States Period had arrived, a stage in which Qin tried to unify the country by its own strength.\n\nDuring the late stage of the Warring States Period, Qin first con-centrated on attacking Han, Zhao and Wei. In 260 B.C., Qin and Zhao fought at Changping (modern Gaoping County, Shanxi Province). Before the battle, Qin succeeded in sowing discord in the enemy\u2019s ranks, making Zhao replace the experienced general Lian Po with the armchair strategist Zhao Kuo. Then General Bao Qi of Qin lured the Zhao forces into a trap where they were surrounded on all sides and their route of retreat cut off. When the battle was over, Zhao lost more than 400,000 men, including Zhao Kuo who was killed in action.\n\nApart from military offensives, Qin also adopted a policy of be- friending distant states while attacking those nearby. It bought support in the enemy\u2019s ranks with cash and resorted to assassination as well. In 246 B.C., Prince Ying Zheng ascended the throne, and the new ruler was later known as the First Emperor of the Qin Dynasty. In 230 B.C., Qin conquered Han and, in nine years, conquered Zhao, Wei, Chu, Yan and Qi as well. Since the nobles in Qi had taken more gold from Qin than those in any other state, Qi surrendered to Qin without a fight in 221 B.C.\n\nThe Transition from Slavery to Feudalism\n\nThe reform of Shang Yang lasted more than twenty years and greatly strengthened Qin. Qin became aGreat changes had taken place in productive forces dunng the early period of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty and the Spring and Autumn Period. When consequent changes took place in production relations, the time had arrived for the slave society to be transformed into a feu-dal society.\n\nThe development of social productive forces in the period that covered the early Eastern Zhou, Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods was marked by the increasing popularity of iron tools. Iron had been discovered and used as early as the Shang Dynasty. By the late period of the Western Zhou Dynasty, iron tools were in com- mon use. In the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, people knew quite a bit about exploring and mining iron. It was recorded then that wherever reddishbrown objects were seen in the mountains, there might be iron deposits underneath. The record also said that there were 3,609 mountains yielding iron. The iron-smelting site in Linzi County , Shandong Province, covered an area of over 100,000 square metres. At the iron mining site of Tonglu Mountains , in Daye County , Hubei Province, the mine tunnel supports since discovered were quite advanced and complete. Facilities and installations for transportation, ventilation, and water drainage have also been found. Normally, the ore first went through a selection process in the pit before it was brought up by winches. As part of the iron-smelting equipment, the bellows were made of leather, connected to the furnace by a tube at one end and a handle made of porcelain at the other end. The turning of the handle forced air into the furnace, causing the char- coal to burn and the heat of the furnace to go up. In the late Spring and Autumn Period, craftsmen in the state of Wu already knew how to cast iron into sharp swords. In 513 B.C., with iron collected as tax, the state of Jin made a tripod on which the entire criminal code was cast. All this demonstrated that iron instruments had become quite popular among the common people after a considerable period of development.\n\nIron weapons dating back to the Warring States Period include armours, sticks, swords, broad swords, awls, halberds and daggers. A study of the steel swords and halberds unearthed at the secondary capital of Yan, located in modern Yixian County, Hebei Province shows that the final product came about through carbonization and repeated heating and hammering, followed by a sudden immersion in water. The steel thus obtained was martensitic, noted for its hardness and strength.\n\nAt this time, people also discovered that a magnet at-tracted iron and that a magnetic needle always ran in a northsouth direction. They invented the early form of a compass, known as Sinan. In the middle Spring and Autumn Period, farm tools made of iron were in use in Qi. The iron farm tools in common use during the War- ring Slates Period included plough, pick, hoe, spade and sickle and the common iron-made tools for handicraft work were axe, chopper, saw, awl, chisel and hammer. For women, the iron-made tools were needle, knife, awl, etc. People in Yan used iron moulds to mass-produce farming tools, handicraft tools, and spare parts for wagons.\n\nThe use of iron tools made it possible to employ draught animals for agricultural production. Oxen ploughing the fields became a com-mon sight in the Spring and Autumn Period. Horses were also em-ployed for ploughing during the Warring States Period. All this helped intensive farming and did much to increase agricultural productivity.\n\nClosely related to the development of agricultural productivity in the Warring States Period was the construction of water conservancy projects. In 486 B.C., King Fu Chai of Wu, in an attempt to seek supremacy in the north, constructed the Han Canal from Jiangdu to Huai\u2019an, both in modern Jiangsu Province , so that the Huaihe Rive1 was linked with the Changjiang River . Later, he constructed a deepel canal connecting the Yishui River in the north with the Jishui River in the west, joining the drainage of the Huaihe and the Huanghe. This was a gigantic project constructed primarily for water transportation Ximen Bao of Wei in the Warring States Period irrigated farmland in Ye (modern Linzhang County, Hebei Province) with water from the Zhanghe River, turning large tracts of salinealkaline soil into fertile fields, demonstrating the important role that water conservancy pro-jects could play in improving agriculture. Li Bing of Qin built in mod-em Guanxian County , Sichuan Province, the Dujiang Weir, cutting Minjiang River into an inner and an outer tributary. The project pre- vented flood and facilitated water transportation, and provided irriga-tion which turned the Chengdu Plain into a vast expanse of rich farm-land. The state of Qin also employed Zheng Guo, an expert in water conservancy from the state of Han, to build a 150-kilometre-long ca-nal connecting the Jingshui with the Beiluoshui rivers. The use of silt- laden water from these two rivers for irrigation transformed over40,000 hectares of saline land into fertile fields. At this time, well sweeps were in use to bring water from low to high areas.\n\nFarmers in the Warring States Period could already tell the differences among various types of soil and knew how to transform one type of soil into another. They classified soil into 9 categories and selected the suitable crops. They used a variety of manure, ranging from animal droppings to wood ashes and green manure. They mixed crop seeds with animal bones and called the mixture \u201cfertilized seeds\u201d. In crop management, they paid attention to the right distance between plants, straight rows, selection of healthy young plants and root pro- tection. They knew the importance of weeding and the elimination of locusts and snout moths. Books on agriculture were in existence. The ancient book Lu\u2019s Almanac and ters on agriculture. some other works all contained chapters on agriculture.\n\nDuring the Warring States Period, progress was made in salt making, lacquerware manufacturing and the casting of bronzes. Sea salt in Qi and Yan, lake salt in Anyi of Wei, and well salt in Ba and Shu were well-known. Beginning with the middle of the Warring States Period, musical instruments, weapons, outer coffins, and many utensils for daily houshold use were coated with lacquer. In the casting of bronzes, such new techniques as etching, inalying of gold and silver, enchasing and gilding were all used.\n\nThe increase of social productivity in agriculture during the early Eastern Zhou, the Spring and Autumn, and the Warring States periods gradually changed the nature of the productive forces. Apart from the newly invented farming tools, slaves who had been engaged in collective farming were now replaced as labourers by peasants each working on his own, Independent peasants also replaced those who formerly worked in communal villages.\n\nThe inadequate manpower resulting from slowdown or the escape of slaves worried the slave-owners during the late stage of slave society. A poem from Qi in the middle of the Spring and Autmn Period says:\u201d Stop ploughing the fields, for wild grass is shooting up.\u201d Touring the state of Chen, and envoy from the Eastern Zhou complained that the crops there had all been covered up by weeds. Clearly, land lay waste in some areas owing to the shortage of manpower. Under these circumstances, slave-owners were complelled to give up the practice of using slave labour, as they realized that it was more advantageous to exploit individual peasants.\n\nThe old practice of distributing land according to its fertility gradually lost its appeal. Now peasants could make their own arrangement regarding land roation, since it was no longer necessary to rotate land on a community basis. A special relationship was thus established between a peasant and the land he tilled permanently. This in turn gave birth to the concept of the family as a producative unit. We now know that Jin was the first sate to use administrative power to promote such a practice in 645 B.C.\n\nThe individual peasant had two distinct features. First, he was tied to land, unlike the relationship between slaves and land or between a village commune and land. Secondly, and individual family, where the husband tilled and the wife wove became known as a \u201chousehold\u201d, or a productive unit. All this further increased the peasants\u2019 dependence on land.\n\nThe change in social productive forces inevitably led to changes in prroduction relations. The production relations of the slave system could no longer suit the new productive forces and had to be replaced by the production relations of the feudal system. The representative of the new productive forces must be one who had a certain degree of freedom and was engaged in private economy, not simply a tool that could speak. When exploiters took individual peasants as their main target of exploitation, they could no longer own the producer as completely as they did the slave. Now the ownership was only partial. Under these conditions, the exploiters became landlords. The beginning of confronation between peasants and landlords marked the appearance of the feudal relations of production.\n\nBeginning with the middle of the Spring and Autumn Period and particularly during the Warring Sates Period, some princes and dukes changed from slave-owners to landlords. Most of the landlords acquired land through grants as a reward for their military deeds. Some of the indivdual peasants might also grow into landlorda. In places where land could be traded, merchants might also become landlords.\n\nFeudal landownership was system where land was owned by landlords. Different landlords occupied different political and social positions. Such ranks were merely a refection of different grades of landownership. After its inception in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. feudal landownership in China always represented a hierachy.\n\nIn all of the reforms carried out by Shang Yang in the State of Qin, including the encouragement of maried sons to live in separate households, the rewarding of those who had done well in farming and weaving, the registation and organization of households, and the suppression of commerce, the tried to transform a household into a production unit where men tilled and women wove, thus tying the labour force to the land. His other measures of reform, such as the granting of the twenty ranks of honour according to military deeds, the distribution of land and houses according to merit, and the downgrading of nobles who had failed to distinguish themselves in war, were all aimed at the replacement of the slave-owning class by the new landlord class. The reform, enforced through administrative power, accelerated the development of the new producative forces and the corresponding feudal landownership based on a system of ranks.\n\nThe change in production relationship was no easy matter and was bound to be accompanied by complicated struggle. Class struggle, including the struggle among the exploiting classes, was inevitable. The reforms of Wu Qi and Shang Yang posed, from the very beginning, a confrontation with the nobility of the old order. The fact that they were killed for their reforms indicated the harshness of the strug- gle. The running away of slaves, the roaming about of \u201cthieves and robbers\u201d and the \u201cfleeing of citizens\u201d in general were actually differ-ent forms of class struggle that went on all the time. History recorded the \u201cfleeing of male and female slaves\u201d and the \u201cfleeing of masses\u201d; all this indicated that ordinary citizens or slaves ran away because they could no longer bear the heavy burden of military and labour services imposed upon them by the ruling classes.\n\nIn 641 B.C., rulers of Liang (to the south of modern Hancheng County , Shaanxi Province) forced people to build they city walls. When they ordered the weary labourers to dig a moat, they caused a\u201dmass fleeing of citizens\u201d. Qin seized the occasion to attack Liang and succeeded in conquering it. A hundred and twenty-two years later, when Chu built its capital at Yingcheng in 519 B.C., the above incident was still regarded as a lesson to be avoided, indicating its farreaching impact. \u201cThieves and robbers\u201d were a serious threat to the laaling classes of various states. They could be found on the highways of Chu, or in the capital city of Jin . According to legends, there was a leader of a mass uprising named Zhi, referred to by rulers of various states as Thief Zhi. He had a strong force of several thousand people under his command and dealt telling blows to the ruling classes. Struggles of this kind might be small in scale and did not have many slaves as participators, but whoever participated fought bravely against the slaveowning class, weakened the rule of the slave system, and paved the way for the rise of feudalism.\n\nIndustry and commerce during the early Eastern Zhou, the Spring and Autumn, and the Warring States periods, unlike agriculture, did not play a dominant role in the social economy as a whole. As far as the record goes, the traders and the industrialists all had considerable influence. Two stories about merchants during the Spring and Autumn Period deserve special mention. In 627 B.C., while journeying to Zhou on a business trip, Xuan Gao, a merchant of Zheng, encountered Qin\u2019s army on its way to attack Zheng by surprise. He gave four pieces of tanned leather and twelve oxen to the Qin army in the name of the sovereign of Zheng. The Qin army mistakenly thought that news of their projected attack must have leaked out, and it decided to withdraw During the battle at Bi between Jin and Chu in 597 B.C., an official of Jin, Xun Ying, was captured. Merchants of Zheng planned to smuggle him out of Chu in a cart loaded with merchandise. Before the plan was, carried out, Chu released him. The Zheng merchants in these two sto-ries might not be ordinary businessmen but people with political status Zi Gong, a disciple of Confucius, was not a professional merchant, and all his commercial activities were closely related to politics. Lu Buwei was not only a successful merchant of the late Warring States Period, but also a political manipulator. He masterminded and fi-nanced the return to Qin of Prince Yi Ren, who had been held in Zhao as a hostage. After Zi Chu ascended the throne as Prince Zhuangxiang, Lti Buwei became his prime minister.\n\nAgricultural and side-line products were the main trade items during the Warring States Period. They included grain, silk, bast fibre, textile, kohemp cloth, special local products of various regions, and luxuries used by the ruling class. Bai Gui, a merchant of Wei, amassed a huge fortune by purchasing grain and selling silk and lacquerware in years of good harvest and by selling grain and buying textile and cot-ton goods in years of bad harvest. Iron-smelting and salt-making were both profitable trades. Guo Zong and the Zhuo family of Zhao, Cheng Zheng of Qi, the Kong family of Liang, and the Bing family of Cao all made fortunes bysmelting iron. Yi Dun of Lu and Diao Jian of Qi became rich by making salt or trading in fish. All of them employed slaves for production. Slavery persisted for a long time in the ironsmelting and salt-manufacturing industries.\n\nConfucius, Mo Zi, Other Thinkers and the Elegies of Chu\n\nDuring the early Eastern Zhou, the Spring and Autumn, and the Warring states periods, persistent social upheavals gradually broke up the monopoly of culture and literature by members of the nobility, a monopoly that began as early as the Western Zhou. Private schools became a trendy development. During the late Spring and Autumn Period, Confucius started the trend by providing private teaching. Then, in the Warring States Period, many schools of thought came into existence and began to contend with one another. Ci, a new form of literature reflecting the trend of the time, appeared in the middle of the Warring States Period.\n\nConfucius, whose personal name was Qiu and courtesy name Zhongni, was born in 551 B.C., in Zhou Yi, modern Qufu County , Shandong Province, then a part of the state of Lu. He died in 479 B.C. His ancestors used to be slave-owners in Song, but his great grand- father fled to Lu due to failure in his political career. By his father\u2019s time, the noble family had declined financially. During his youth, Confucius was for a time a lowranking official managing warehouses; then he tended sheep and oxen. For the most part of his life, however, he was a private teacher. It is said that he had more than 3,000 stu-dents, 70 of whom were considered to be excellent. He often took some of his students with him while touring the various states. The rulers of these states all received him courteously and consulted him. Nevertheless, Confucius never had the opportunity to put his theory of government into practice. Not until his fifties did he become an offi-cial in charge of criminal punishment and the maintenance of social order in the state of Lu. He was then able to participate in state ad- ministration, but held the post for only three months. He devoted his later years to the collation and editing of literary works. He was said to have edited the Book of History and the Book of Odes. He added explanatory notes to the Book of Changes, a work on divination. He compiled the Spring and Autumn Annals. The Book of Rites and the Book of Music were examined and revised by him, too. Except for the Book of Music which has been lost, the other five books, in later years, became known as the Confucian classics which followers of Confu-cianism must read and abide by. The spring and Autumn Annals was the earliest and more or less complete chronicle, which had great im-pact on later historical works. After Confucius\u2019 death, his disciples compiled his statements to form a book entitled The Analects.\n\nHis lectures and tours indicated clearly that, like many others who did not enjoy the political status of the nobles, Confucius intend-ed to take part in politics. These people were a rising force in a time of turmoil. Most of them were commoners, but some may have been nobles in origin who had lost their status. Confucius said that those who did well in studies could become officials. Thus the purpose of his teaching was to help his students acquire the necessary skill to get into politics. He often praised his students by saying that this one would do well in politics and that one could become a prime minister.\n\nThe content of Confucius\u2019 private teaching was antagonistic to that taught by the official schools of the nobles. He held that men were alike in nature, a teaching that was contrary to the basic concept of a slave society where social status was preordained. Speaking about politics, Confucius proposed that good and capable people should be appointed to official posts, a proposal that was contrary to the practice of heredi-tary rule. All this reflects the progressive aspect of his thinking.\n\nAs for the rites that supposedly governed the behaviour of the nobles beginning with the Western Zhou Dynasty, Confucius believed that they should not be merely a formality but should instead be combined with benevolence. Rites without benevolence would be totally meaningless.\n\nConfucius, nevertheless, was only a reformist. He did not carry his ideas to their logical conclusion. Though he initiated private teaching, what he taught was nevertheless the same as the nobles used to learn. He did not believe that the noble status was preordained, but he defended the hierarchy of the nobility. He advocated the elevation of good and capable people, but he never raised objection to the offi- cial hereditary system, even advising good and capable men to be satisfied with their poverty and lowly position. He emphasized the importance of benevolence and regarded it as the highest ideal of mo-rality. Yet, according to him, benevolence meant different grades of love more love for those who were close and less for those who were distant, more for the highly placed and less for the lowly. Only the socially elevated could be loving, he said, while those below were merely objects of love. On the one hand, he stressed that rites should be combined with benevolence. On the other, he held that benevolence should be practised within the strict boundary of rites. Attempting to solve problems involving rites and benevolence, Confucius failed to use the new ideas to replace the old formality; instead, he adhered to the old formality as a means of reshaping old ideas. While his activiti-es coutaiued, some progressive elements, such as his aspiration to be a statesman, basically, he defended the interests of the slave-owning nobles without being able to break through the shackles of the old order. Confucius viewed the upheavals of the Spring and Autumn Period as an abnormal situation in which society was not guided by right principles; he longed for the return of the Western Zhou times when society was guided by such principles. Rationally he knew that the Western Zhou times would never return; emotionally, however, he could not bring himself to face the fact. Many described him as a man who \u201cdoes what he knows is impossible\u201d.\n\nAs the first private teacher who brought education to a large number of people, Confucius was properly regarded as having made great contributions in the cultural history of China . We must be re-minded, however, that being politically conservative, he worked against the tide of history.\n\nThe school of thought founded by Confucius was known as Confucianism. A later school of thought which had equal influence was the school of Mohism founded by Mo Zi.\n\nMo Zi, whose personal name was Di, was a native of either Lu or Song. He was active during the period of 468-376 B.C. More in line with the interest of the common people, some of his important theories were in direct conflict with those of Confucius. His ideas could be found in a book entitled Mo Zi.\n\nMo Zi advocated universal love, the love for all without discrimination. One must treat another person, his family and his country in the same way as one treated oneself, one\u2019s own family, and one\u2019s own country. Thus Mo Zi\u2019s love was totally different from the concept of benevolence taught by Confucius. Mo Zi had no use for rites and music; his teaching of frugality on funerals and other occasions was in sharp contrast with the kind of life the nobles had and the kind of ad-vice Confucius gave.\n\nIn politics, Mo Zi believed that people with ability should be elevated; he was opposed to inherited wealth or nobility. He said that a man with ability should become a government official even though he might be a lowly peasant or an ordinary worker. This idea of his was different from that of Confucius who did not clearly oppose the he- reditary system in the officialdom.\n\nAccording to Mo Zi, heaven and the demons rewarded the good and punished the evil. King Jie of Xia, King Zhou of Shang, and King You and King Li of Zhou, being tyrannical rulers, were punished for their opposition to the will of heaven, while Great Yu of Xia, King Tang of Shang, and King Wen and King Wu of Zhou, being saintly leaders, were rewarded for their compliance with the wishes of heaven. He believed that reward and punishment were meted out by heaven and the demons in accordance with the way people behaved. Poverty and wealth and people\u2019s status were neither preordained nor immutable. He invoked the will of heaven to persuade rulers to display kindness, so that \u201cthe starving may have food, those suffering from cold may have clothes, and the toilers may have some rest\u201d. Though all this was merely a wish, his opposition to fatalism was nevertheless pro- gressive.\n\nIdeologically speaking, both Confucius and Mo Zi were idealists. But there are noteworthy elements of materialism in Mo Zi\u2019s theory of knowledge. Some of his criteria of authentic knowledge had to do with proof by facts and objective result. Mohists of later days inherited this fine tradition and developed the materialistic view of the theo-ry of knowledge. They made their contributions in the realm of natural sciences.\n\nMohism was an organized school of philosophers. After the death of Mo Zi, Ju Zi emerged as the leader of the school, which not only enforced its own discipline but also put its beliefs into practice.\n\nDuring the Warring States Period, apart from Confucianism and Mohism, there were also Taoism and Legalism. In addition, there was the school of Logicians that studied the distinction between name and reality\u2013a school that emphasized the importance of logic and debate. The yinyang school, on the other hand, tried to explain natural and social phenomena by an analysis of yin and yang\u2013the negative and the positive forces in the universe. The author of the book Lao Zi and Zhuang Zi of the Taoist school, Mencius and Xun Zi of the Confucian school, and Han Fei of the Legalist school were the best known schol-ars.\n\nLao Zi, whose surname was Li and personal name Er, was also known as Lao Dan. Roughly a contemporary of Confucius, he hailed from the state of Chu . The book Lao Zi, which has been attributed to him, was actually a work of the Warring States Period. It may not fully express his ideas.\n\nThe book repudiated the theory of a god, a heaven, or a supreme authority that had been popular since the Shang Dynasty. It replaced the theory with the Way, an absolute, overriding spirit transcending time and space and encompassing the whole universe. They Way had existed long before the physical universe came into being; it was in fact the source of everything in the universe. This represented the standpoint of objective idealism.\n\nIn the area of political thought, the book Lao Zi refuted the Con-fucian theory of benevolence and the Mohist concept of elevating good, virtuous people. It was in favour of letting nature take its own course and of non-interference in people\u2019s life. People would be better off without knowledge or desire. An ideal society was one small in population and territory, where there were no advanced implements and tools, no boats or vehicles, and no wars. People recorded events by making knots with ropes, and they never visited people of a neigh-bour state for the duration of their lives even though \u201cthey could hear the crowing of cocks and the barking of dogs on the other side of the border\u201d. The idea expressed above reflected the pessimism among rulers of the village communes in decline.\n\nThe book Lao Zi contained some naive ideas of dialectics. It unveiled the unity of opposites in the objective world such as disaster and fortune, soft and hard, strong and weak, more and less, above and below, early and late, true and false, honour and shame, clever and stupid, etc. Lao Zi realized the contradictions in things and the trans-formation of the opposites. In his view, however, the changes in things did not develop in a forward fashion; instead, it went on in an endless cycle. Besides, the transformation of the opposites was absolute and unconditional. He attempted to resolve contradictions in a subjective way, and this attempt gave birth to the idea of \u201cacting without striving\u201d in politics.\n\nZhuang Zi (c. 369 B.C.-286 B.C.), whose personal name was Zhou, hailed from the state of Song. Among the over 30 chapters in the book Zhuang Zi, some were his own writing.\n\nLike the author of Lao Zi, Zhuang Zi regarded the Way as the substance of the universe. By claiming that he had identified himself with the Way, he changed the objective idealism in Lao Zi into a subjective idealism.\n\nFrom Zhuang Zi\u2019s point of view, only the Way was absolute, while everything else was relative. He equated the subject with the object, life with death, longevity with short life, right with wrong, and disaster with fortune. He dismissed all difference between opposites and advanced a theory of relativism or nihilism. He denied the validity of the concepts of right and wrong debated between Confucians and Mohists, and regarded all cultural progress as meaningless. He once said that there would be peace and order if the learned men gave up their knowledge, and all fighting would stop with the abolition of weights and measures. His ideal society was one in which people lived in harmony with animals and birds.\n\nZhuang Zi\u2019s denial of the differences between right and wrong, life and death, oneself and others, illusion and reality, his antagonism to progress and his longing for a return to the prehistoric times, re-flected a deep sense of pessimism, similar to that expressed in Lao Zi. The pessimistic view of both struck a sympathetic chord among the classes in decline throughout Chinese history. By refusing to recog-nize reality, however, the author of Lao Zi and Zhuang Zi also took a negative view of the \u201cearly kings\u201d, including Great Yu, King Tang of Shang, and King Wen and King Wu of Zhou, revered and extolled by Confucians and Mohists. In so doing they helped people, albeit unconsciously, to emancipate their minds.\n\nMencius, active during 372-289 B.C., was a native of Zou (modern Zouxian County in Shandong Province ). His personal name was Ke and courtesy name Ziyu. His life experience was similar to that of Confucius. He too was a private teacher and took his students with him while touring the various states. While travelling, he was at one time accompanied by several hundred disciples and scores of chariots. He was also received with courtesy by rulers of various states, but none accepted his political ideas. His teachings were contained in a book entitled Mencius.\n\nMencius condemned tyranny, describing it as a system that \u201cdi-rects beasts to eat people\u201d. He was concerned with the sharpening of social contradictions, especially the fleeing of labour from productive pursuits. He inherited the Confucian concept of benevolence and de-veloped it further by emphasizing its importance as a governmental policy. He believed that every person should have his own immovable property. A family of eight should have 100 mu of land in order to grow enough food to eat. It should raise domestic animals for meat, and plant mulberry trees and cultivate silk worms for clothing. In addition, there should be schools to teach people to be dutiful towards their parents and respectful towards all elders. If all this was done, people would be \u201cfriendly towards one another, helping one another in difficulties or in poor health.\u201d In that case, they would have no desire to move to other places all their lives. All this, in Mencius\u2019 opinion, would be beneficial to the building of a strong state. The purpose of having immovable property for everyone, as proposed by Mencius, was to combine tilling with weaving to create a small-scale agricul-tural economy where labour would be permanently tied to land. This meant the feudalization of the socio-economy that had apparently taken place during the time of Mencius. He wanted to promote it by administrative method.\n\nThe basis for Mencius\u2019 theory of a government by benevolence was that man was born with goodness. Man possessed the inherent quality of benevolence, righteousness, propriety and wisdom, which some people were able to preserve, while others could not. In Mencius\u2019 view, every sovereign was able to rule by a policy of benevo-lence, and every citizen was able to accept it. Both the rulers and the ruled were able to be good. In other words, the moral standards for two different classes were preordained. He made this point even clear-er when he said that \u201cthose who labour with their minds govern others; those who labour with their hands are governed by others.\u201d\n\nThe constant wars of annexation were strongly opposed by Mencius. He maintained that those who loved to wage wars should be severely punished. As he realized that the trend during the period of the Warring States was towards unification, he stated, \u201conly those who hate killing will be able to unify the country\u201d. He meant that one could unify the country only through benevolence, not by violence.\n\nMencius advocated the democratic principle that the people were more important than kings. A king enjoying popular support deserved to be called a king; a king who had lost popular support would be a lonely tyrant, who deserved to be put to death by anyone. A king who had done harm to the state should be replaced.\n\nRepresenting the landlord class, Mencius was an idealist in thought, and the measures he preached were those of reconciliation. Nevertheless, he was progressive in the sense that he hated despotic rule and attached great importance to people\u2019s economic life and their importance to the govemment.\n\nXun Zi, also known as Xun Kuang or Xun Qing, hailed from the state of Zhao. He was active during 298-238 B.C. He travelled to the state of Qi twice as a visiting teacher and served on two occasions in Chu as magistrate of Lanling (located to the southwest of Zaozhuang City , modem Shandong Province ). While touring Qin, he met with King Zhao whose political system he admired. In his old age, he re-tired to Chu , where he concentrated on writing. He extant Xun Zi contains his works.\n\nHan Fei, a student of Xun Zi, was a native of the state of Han. He died in 233 B.C., but the year of birth is not known. Seeing the decline of his native state, he repeatedly presented ideas of reform to the king of Han. But none was accepted. When his written works were brought to Qin, the king of Qin admired it greatly. Han Fei went to Qin, only to be murdered by Li Si and other Qin officials. His written works were preserved in a book entitled Han Fei Zi.\n\nXun Zi and Han Fei lived in the late Warring States Period, shortly before the state of Qin unified China . By this time, the feudal landlord class had already established its position of supremacy, and the political trend was clearly the development of an autocratic mon-archy and the unification of China . This trend showed itself in aca-demic and political thought in the predominance of the school of Legalism and in comprehensive criticism of previous schools. Both Xun Zi and I-lan Fei had evaluated and criticized the various schools of thought before their time. \u201cCriticism of the Twelve Schools\u201d in Xun Zi, and \u201d Prominent Schools of Learning\u201d and \u201cFive Evils\u201d in Han Fei Zi are well-written examples of this kind.\n\nXun Zi\u2019s concept of nature was a step forward compared to the naive materialism or atheism initiated during the Spring and Autumn Period. He viewed the stars, days and months, the four seasons, wind and rain, cold and heat, yin and yang as phenomena of change in na-ture. They were governed by their own rules, without will or aim. Nature could not dispense with winter no matter how much human beings were afraid of cold, and land would not shrink no matter how much people wanted to hurry from one place to another. The laws that governed the motion of nature did not come about because of the ex-istence of a wise king named Yao ; they would not disappear because of the rise of a tyrant named Jie. Xun Zi noted that people were afraid of the falling of meteors or the strange sound caused by wind blowing against trees, but these phenomena indicated nothing but some rare changes in the yin-yang equilibrium that governed the normal function of the universe. They were not something to be afraid of. He believed that if people would work harder in agriculture and practise frugality, nature could not make them poor; if people would wear enough clothes, eat properly, and do physical exercise, nature could not make them ill. On the other hand, if people gave up agricultural production and were given to extravagance nature could in no way bring them prosperity. If they did not have enough food or clothes and did not do much physical exercise, nature could not do much about their health. Man, in his view, had the capacity of adapting himself to his environ-ment and of making good use of natural laws so as to make everything in the universe serve his own ends. The idea of Xun Zi represented the upward movement of a feudal society dominated by landlords; it was different from that of Confucius, Mencius, Zhuang Zi , Mo Zi and the author of Lao Zi.\n\nXun Zi also spoke of benevolence, but he emphasized the importance of rites. He believed that learning should begin with the study of the Book of Odes, the Book of History, and other classics; it should end with a study of rites, which marked the apex of the learn-ing process. He carried forward Confucius; view on rites, though with some reservation. On the one hand, he realized that the purpose of emphasizing the importance of rites was to maintain the class difference between the rich and the poor, the noble and the humble. On the other hand, he often mentioned law and rites in the same breath and considered them almost synonymous. In particular, he emphasized the importance of law, saying that no country could be governed without it. He explained the origin of rites with the supposition that man was born with evil. Beginning with his birth, man desired material things and sought among themselves for the satisfaction of such a desire, and the fight, in turn, caused social disorder. The need to maintain social order gave rise to rites. Xun Zi\u2019s view on rites showed his preference, sometimes, for Legalist ideas. His disciple Han Fei carried the argument further and became an important Legalist.\n\nAccording to Xun Zi\u2019s theory of innate evil, the good qualities man had were acquired through learning after birth. He held that studying hard would enable one to change from being foolish to being wise and that those who studied most diligently might even become\u201dsages\u201d. Though Xun Zi\u2019s theory was in direct conflict with that of Mencius who maintained that people were born with goodness, both philosophers talked about man\u2019s nature in the abstract without taking into consideration the factor of class influence. Both were idealists. Nevertheless, Xun Zi explained his theory from the viewpoint of ma- terial desire, emphasized learning after one\u2019s birth, and paid particular attention to the influence of environment on man. As a philosopher, he tended towards materialism. He was a progressive in his time. According to him, a major reason for the chaos during the Warring States Period was \u201ctoo many schools of thought expressing too many differ-ent ideologies\u201d. To ensure social stability, there should be no more than one school of thought, from which even sages should not differ. By this point of view, he was in favour of thought control under an autocratic feudal government.\n\nHan Fei held that history was evolutionary, each era being more progressive than the preceding one. He classified history into three stages, the early ancient times, the ancient times. and the late ancient times In the early ancient middle ancient times, , wild animals outnumbered human beings. To protect humans from attack by wild animals, one sage invented a tree house that was very much like a bird\u2019s nest, so humans had a place to live in. To prevent diseases caused by food, another sage invented fire by drilling wood, so they could cook their food and eat better. In the middle ancient times, there was a big flood, which Gun and Yu succeeded in controlling, eventually. In the late ancient times, King Jie of Xia and King Zhou of Shang imposed such despotic rule upon humans that King Tang of Shang and King Wu of Zhou led uprisings to depose them. If, at the time of the Xia Dynasty, someone still lived in trees and made fire by drilling wood, he would be laughed at by Gun and Yu. If, at the time of the Shang Dynasty, someone still regarded flood control as the most pressing priority, he would be laughed at by King Tang of Shang and King Wu of Zhou. If, at the present time, someone still eulogized Yao , Shun, Gun, Yu, Tang, and Wu as perfect sages, he would and should be laughed at by all of today\u2019s sages. Han Fei concluded that today\u2019s sages should neither long for the past nor copy obsolete rules. They should, instead, take a long, hard look at today\u2019s social conditions and adopt appropriate measures.\n\nHaving studied political history and learned its lessons, Han Fei made a political proposal for the purpose of strengthening feudal rule, a proposal that combined the use of law, tactics, and power. \u201cLaw\u201d, enacted by the monarch, consisted of written regulations whereby the people were subjected to his rule. \u201cTactics\u201d were the means by which the monarch governed his citizens. Han Fei maintained that law and tactics were equally important. Ruling with laws minus tactics could not prevent officials from building up their own power at the expense of the monarch\u2019s authority. On the other hand, ruling with tactics mi-nus law would weaken the stability of the government. In addition to law and tactics, power was necessary. By power was meant the mon-arch\u2019s supreme authority, which alone could make law and tactics effective. All the three law, tactics, and power were the indispen-sable tools for the monarchy. Han Fei proposed that all power be concentrated in the hands of the monarch who would then use a combina-tion of the three to govern the people effectively.\n\nHan Fei\u2019s opposition to conservatism was clear-cut and his advocacy of reform positive. Representing the interests of the feudal land-lord class, he was laying the ideological foundation for the advent of feudal autocracy.\n\nNew successes in art and literature were achieved during the later part of the middle Warring States Period. A typical example was the Elegies of Chu, a collection of poetic verses and songs written in the local dialect and tone of Chu . It possessed strong regional characteristics and a unique style. Qu Yuan, whose personal name was Ping , became famous as the author of these works. A native of Chu , he was born around 340 B.C. and died in 278 B.C. In his works, he told im-pressive stories of Chu \u2018s mountains and rivers, products, local cus-toms, and songs and dances. He narrated many fairy tales and popular legends. More significantly, his works portrayed vividly the actual situation in Chu during the drastic changes in the late Warring States Period. They reflected his sincere love for his country and people.\n\nChu was still powerful and prosperous when Qu Yuan was young. With an aristocratic family background, he intended to pursue a politi-cal career. He won the trust of the Prince of Chu and was appointed the Left Minister. As an senior official, he was able to participate in the making of decisions involving the state\u2019s internal and foreign af-fairs. He advocated the choosing of virtuous and capable men as offi- cials and the enactment of good laws to strengthen the state. In foreign affairs, he was in favour of a military alliance with the state of Qi against the state of Qin. However, the prince soon distrusted him and banished him from the capital. Meanwhile, corruption and incompe-tence, combined with repeated defeat by Qin, gradually weakened Chu . Refusing to be as corrupt as other members of Chu \u2018s nobility, he was hoping that he could regain the prince\u2019s trust and receive an ap-pointment again. But he hoped in vain. He was so worried that he wanted to give up everything. Yet there was the suffering of the people a patriot must face. Where should Chu stand, now that the unification of China had become a distinctive trend? Torn by all these contradic-tions, he could not help feeling irritated and frustrated. When he poured out his sorrows and anger in the form of poems, the splendid works of the Elegies of Chu were born. When Chu \u2018 s capital Ying was captured by Qin and when his state was on the verge of extinction, he committed suicide by drowning himself in a river.\n\nUnlike poets before his time who were anonymous, Qu Yuan was the first poet to leave his name in the history of Chinese literature. His works exerted tremendous influence on the development of Chinese literature."}, {"url": "http://chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/rulers-zhao.html", "page_content": "Nov 1, 2018 \u00a9 Ulrich Theobald\n\nZhao \u8d99 was a regional state of the Zhou period \u5468 (11th cent.-221 BCE). It emerged as a separate state when several noble families of Jin \u6649 extinguished the ducal house and divided its territory into three, namely Wei \u9b4f, Han \u97d3, and Zhao \u8d99. Zhao played an important role during the Warring States period \u6230\u570b (5th cent.-221 BCE) as one of the large regional states fighting against the state of Qin \u79e6. The territory of Zhao was located in the modern province of Shanxi.\n\nMap 1. The regional state of Zhao \u8d99 (403 - 222 BCE) Map according to Tan Qixiang \u8c2d\u5176\u9aa7 (1987), Zhongguo lishi ditu ji \u4e2d\u56fd\u5386\u53f2\u5730\u56fe\u96c6. Zhao was located in the northern parts of what is today the province of Shanxi, in mountaineous area, and therefore relatively safe against attacks from Yan, Wei or Qin. In the north, Zhao built defensive walls against raids of native tribes. Those belong to the presurcors of the Great Wall built during the Qin and Han periods. Click to enlarge.\n\nThe ruling house of Zhao was related to the house of Qin. The ancestor of Qin was Wu Lai \u60e1\u4f86, who served the last ruler of the Shang dynasty \u5546 (17th-11th cent. BCE) and was killed, when King Wu \u5468\u6b66\u738b founded the Zhou dynasty. His brother Ji Sheng \u5b63\u52dd is the ancestor of the house of Zhao. Strangely enough, both the annals of the state of Qin and those of Zhao mention Zao Fu \u9020\u7236 as ancestor of their houses. In the annals of Zhao it is said that Zao Fu was the chief charioteer (yu \u5fa1) of King Mu of Zhou \u5468\u7a46\u738b (10th cent. BCE) when the latter paid visit to the mythological Queen Mother of the West \u897f\u738b\u6bcd. Zao Fu was for his participation in the campaign against the Xu tribes \u5f90 in the southeast rewarded with the territory of Zhao \u8d99 (near modern Hongdong \u6d2a\u6d1e, Shanxi), from which the dynastic name is derived.\n\nZao Fu's descendant Yan Fu \u5944\u7236 rescued King Xuan of Zhou \u5468\u5ba3\u738b (r. 827-782 BCE) during his battle with the Rong tribes \u620e at Qianmu \u5343\u755d. His son Shu Dai \u53d4\u5e36 left Qin and became a noble under Marquis Wen of Jin \u6649\u6587\u4faf (r. 781-746).\n\nHis descendant Zhao Su \u8d99\u5919 participated in the campaign against the statelets of Huo \u970d, Wei \u9b4f, and Geng \u803f under Duke Xian of Jin \u6649\u737b\u516c (r. 677-651). The duke of Huo was reinstated into his position when \"evil spirits\" on Mt. Huotai \u970d\u592a\u5c71 caused a draught. Zhao Su was rewarded with the territory of Geng (near modern Hejin \u6cb3\u6d25, Shanxi).\n\nZhao Su's grandson or younger brother was Zhao Shuai \u8d99\u8870 (posthumous title Viscount Cheng \u8d99\u6210\u5b50). Zhao Shuai made an oracle that predicted that it was better to serve Prince Chong'er \u91cd\u8033 than the other pretenders to the throne. He therefore accompanied the Prince when he had to flee to the Di tribes \u7fdf. In the land of the Di, Prince Chong'er and Zhao Shuai became brothers-in-law by marrying sister princesses of the Qiangjiuru \u5ee7\u548e\u5982 tribe. Yet Zhao Shuai had three sons of a former spouse that were called Zhao Tong \u8d99\u540c, Zhao Kuo \u8d99\u62ec, and Zhao Yingqi \u8d99\u5b30\u9f4a. The son of the Di princess was called Zhao Dun \u8d99\u76fe (posthumous title Viscount Xuan \u8d99\u5ba3\u5b50). After nineteen years in exile Prince Chong'er returned to Jin and was made duke of Jin (Duke Jin \u6649\u6587\u516c, r. 637-628). Zhao Shuai was appointed grand master (dafu \u5927\u592b) of Yuan \u539f (near modern Jiyuan \u6fdf\u6e90, Henan). He continued advising the duke and so helped him to become hegemonial lord (ba \u9738).\n\nWhen Duke Xiang \u6649\u8944\u516c (r. 628-621) died, Zhao Dun was involved in the succession struggle. The Heir Apparent Prince Yigao \u5937\u768b was still very young, and Zhao Dun preferred Prince Yong \u96cd, a brother of late Duke Xiang, but the duchess dowager persuaded him to enthrone Prince Yigao, who is known as Duke Ling of Jin \u6649\u9748\u516c (r. 621-607). Zhao Dun was an important advisor of the Duke and had great influence on his political decisions. Duke Ling was arrogant and cruel and Zhao Dun feared for his life after the Duke had killed his cook, and planned to flee. Zhao Chuan \u8d99\u7a7f killed Duke Ling and enthroned late Duke Xiang's brother Prince Heitun \u9ed1\u81c0 (Duke Cheng \u6649\u6210\u516c, r. 607-600). The other nobles criticized Zhao Dun for planning to flee, and some chronicles therefore recorded that Zhao Dun had killed the Duke.\n\nZhao Dun's son Zhao Shuo \u8d99\u6714 (posthumous title Viscount Zhuang \u8d99\u838a\u5b50) commanded military campaigns against the states of Zheng \u912d and Chu \u695a. He was married to a sister of Duke Cheng of Jin. Grand Master and Minister of Justice (sikou \u53f8\u5bc7) Tu'an Gu \u5c60\u5cb8\u8cc8, a minion of late Duke Ling, planned taking revenge for the murder of the Duke and prepared the extinction of the house of Zhao. Han Jue \u97d3\u53a5 (Han Xianzi \u97d3\u737b\u5b50) informed Zhao Shuo about the coming massacre, yet Zhao Shuo, as a loyal subject, refused to flee. He was killed, along with his relatives Zhao Tong, Zhao Kuo and Zhao Yingqi. Fortunately enough the wife of Zhao Shuo was pregnant and gave birth to a son. Ducal Grandson Gongsun Chujiu \u516c\u5b6b\u6775\u81fc and Cheng Ying \u7a0b\u5b30 rescued the baby.\n\nWhile Prince Chujiu sacrifed his life, Cheng Ying raised the baby in a mountain village. The child was later hidden in the palace by Duke Jing himself, and Han Jue. The Duke won over the generals who had been ordered by Tu'an Gu to extinguish all members of the family Zhao, and in return executed the murderer. The rescued boy, called Zhao Wu \u8d99\u6b66 (posthumous title Viscount Wen \u8d99\u6587\u5b50), was reinstalled in the old honours the family Zhao had enjoyed. Having fulfilled his mission, Cheng Ying killed himself to report to the soul of Prince Chujiu the success of their fight for the orphan of Zhao.\n\nUnder Duke Ping of Jin \u6649\u5e73\u516c (r. 558-532), Zhao Wu was appointed minister-commander (qing \u537f). In 545, Prince Jizi \u5b63\u5b50 of Yanling \u5ef6\u9675 from the state of Wu \u5433 visited Jin. He predicted that Zhao, Han, and Wei would extinguish the Jin dynasty. When Zhao Wu died he was granted the posthumous title Zhao Wenzi \u8d99\u6587\u5b50 \"Viscount Wen of Zhao\". His son was Zhao Jingshu \u8d99\u666f\u53d4 \"Uncle Jing\". During his life Yan Ying \u664f\u5b30, a famous advisor of Duke Jing \u9f4a\u666f\u516c (r. 547-490) of Qi \u9f4a, visited Jin. While Yan Ying admitted that the rule of Qi would one day fell into the hands of the family Tian \u7530, Shu Xiang \u53d4\u5411 (Yangshe Xi \u7f8a\u820c\u80b8) was well aware that the six ministers-commander had ever greater influence on the government of Jin.\n\nJingshu's son was Zhao Yang \u8d99\u9785 (Zhao Jianzi \u8d99\u7c21\u5b50), who was given the posthumous title of Viscount Jian \u8d99\u7c21\u5b50 (r. 517-458). Viscount Jian compelled the regional lords to protect King Jing of Zhou \u5468\u656c\u738b (r. 520-476) against his usurpatorious brother and escorted him back to the royal capital Luoyang \u6d1b\u967d (modern Luoyang, Henan).\n\nIn 514, the six ministers-commander extinguished the noble houses of Qi \u7941, and Yangshe \u7f8a\u820c and occupied their lands. Viscount Jian also received Yang Hu \u967d\u864e in his residence who had been expelled after usurping the power in the state of Lu \u9b6f.\n\nViscount Jian fell ill and lost conscience for a couple of days. He was examined by the famous physician Bian Que \u6241\u9d72, who said that once Duke Miu of Qin \u79e6\u7e46\u516c (i.e. Duke Mu \u79e6\u7a46\u516c, r. 659-621) had been affected by a similar disease and during his coma dreamt of future events. The same happened to Viscount Jian, and he had a vision of the destitute future of Jin and the system of regional states of the Zhou dynasty.\n\nThe diviner Gubu Ziqing \u59d1\u5e03\u5b50\u537f announced that of all the Viscount's sons, only Wuxu \u6bcb\u5379 would become a worthy, albeit he was only the son of a slave girl of the Di tribes. The Viscount thereupon hid a seal (baofu \u5bf6\u7b26) on Mt. Changshan \u5e38\u5c71 (Hengshan \u6046\u5c71), and of all his sons only Wuxu was able to find it. Moreover, he had inspected the country of Dai \u4ee3 from the heights of Mt. Changshan and taxed it as a region worth being occupied. Viscount Jian named Wuxu thereupon his Heir Apparent.\n\nIn 498, the lords of Fan \u8303 and Zhonghang \u4e2d\u884c rebelled against the duke of Jin. Viscount Jian of Zhao played a very ambiguous role in this rebellion and was only pardoned because the lords of Han and Wei interceded in favour to him. Viscount Wen of Zhi \u77e5\u6587\u5b50 (Zhi Bo \u77e5\u4f2f; Zhi \u77e5 is also written \u667a) urged Viscount Jian to betray Dong Anyu \u8463\u5b89\u4e8e, who had also participated in the rebellion. Dong Anyu was honest enough to offer his own life for the survival of the house of Zhao. The residence of the viscounts of Zhao was at that time Jinyang \u6649\u967d (near modern Taiyuan \u592a\u539f, Shanxi).\n\nIn 494, Viscount Jian besieged the lords of Fan and Zhonghang at Chaoge \u671d\u6b4c and forced Viscount Wen of Zhonghang \u4e2d\u884c\u6587\u5b50 (Xun Yin \u8340\u5bc5) to flee to Handan \u90af\u9132 (modern Handan, Hebei). He also tried interferring into the succession struggles in the state of Wei \u885b. Viscount Wen of Zhonghang and Viscount Zhao of Fan \u8303\u662d\u5b50 (Fan Jiyi [sic] \u8303\u5409\u5c04) fled to Qi, and their territories were confiscated by the duke of Jin. As a loyal subject Viscount Jian accompanied the Duke of Jin to Huangchi \u9ec3\u6c60, where Duke Wen successfully obtained the title of hegemonial ruler over the regional rulers (zhuhou \u8af8\u4faf), while his opponent King Fucha \u592b\u5dee of Wu returned without success and even faced the destruction of his kingdom.\n\nDuring a campaign against Zheng, Zhi Bo \u77e5\u4f2f was drunk and smutched the clothes of Wuxu. Wuxu abstained from killing him immediately but began to hate him as his future enemy. Six years later, when his father died, Wuyi became Viscount of Zhao, with the eventual posthumous title of Viscount Xiang \u8d99\u8944\u5b50 (r. 458-425).\n\nAs soon as he had become viscount he invited the king of Dai (probably of the people of the Di), killed him and occupied his country. The sister of Viscount Xiang who was married to the king of Dai, killed herself. Viscount Xiang made nephew Zhou \u5468 ruler of the land of Dai. With the conquest of the land of Dai the territory owned by the viscount of Zhao had considereably expanded.\n\nIn 454, the lords of Zhao, Zhi, Han, and Wei occupied the former territory of the lords of Fan and Zhonghang and divided it among themselves. The duke of Jin was enraged about this insolence and asked the states of Qi and Lu for help. The four ministers-commander thereupon attacked their own lord and forced him to fleed to Qi, yet the duke of Jin died on the road to exile (he is therefore called Duke Chu \u6649\u51fa\u516c \"who died abroad\", r. 475-457).\n\nZhi Bo was at that time the strongest and most arrogant of the four ministers-commander. When asked to cede territory, Viscount Xiang of Zhao refused. Zhi Bo attacked, and Viscount Xiang fortified Jinyang \u6649\u967d to defend himself against Zhi, Han, and Wei. The chronicles report that the viscount of Zhao was protected by supernatural forces, yet the decisive action was made when he secretly plotted with Han and Wei. The two lords consented, attacked Zhi, destroyed its house, and the territory of Zhi was divided among Zhao, Han, and Wei. Zhao so became the largest and strongest of the three states.\n\nViscount Xiang decided not to make his own sons heirs to the throne, but Prince Wan \u6d63, a grandson of his older brother Bo Lu \u4f2f\u9b6f. Prince Wan is posthumously known as Viscount Xian \u8d99\u737b\u5b50 or Marquis Xian \u8d99\u737b\u4faf (r. 424-409, the title of marquis was bestowed posthumously). He was dethroned by late Viscount Xiang's younger brother (or son) Viscount Huan \u8d99\u6853\u5b50, but he died after one year of reign, and Marquis Xian could return. Marquis Xian moved the capital to Zhongmou \u4e2d\u725f (near modern Hongbi \u9d3b\u58c1, Henan). He was succeeded by his son Prince Ji \u7c4d, who is known posthumously as Marquis Lie \u8d99\u70c8\u4faf (r. 409-400).\n\nIn 403, the rulers of Zhao, Wei and Han mutually recognized as full regional lords and adopted the title of marquis (hou \u4faf) instead of viscount (zi \u5b50). The advisors of Marquis Lie were his counsellor Gongzhong Lian \u516c\u4ef2\u9023, as well as the preceptor Niu Chu \u725b\u755c, central commandant (zhongwei \u4e2d\u5c09) Xun Xin \u8340\u6b23, and chief secretary (neishi \u5167\u53f2) Xu Yue \u5f90\u8d8a.\n\nAfter the death of Marquis Lie his younger brother Duke Wu \u8d99\u6b66\u516c (r. 400-387) ruled for thirteen years. He was succeeded by the son of Marquis Lie, Prince Zhang \u7ae0, who is known as Marquis Jing \u8d99\u656c\u4faf (r. 387-375). He chose Handan as capital of Zhao and so moved the centre of the state of Zhao to the east, into a more secure position.\n\nIn 376, the marquesses of Zhao, Wei, and Han decided to divide the territory of Jin among themselves. This alliance (meng \u76df) would continue during the early Warring States period, even after Zhao, Wei, and Han had become independant states. Marquis Jing of Zhao, who had waged numerous wars with the states of Wei \u9b4f, Wei \u885b, and Qi, was succeeded by his son Prince Zhong \u7a2e, who is known as Marquis Cheng \u8d99\u6210\u4faf (r. 375-350).\n\nIn 369, the king of Zhongshan \u4e2d\u5c71 erected a fortification wall to protect his territory against intrusions by Zhao. There were annually military campaigns between the states of the region, in ever-changing constellations. Zhao waged war with Qi and Wei and found support in the southern state of Chu. It also fought in the battles of Fangzi \u623f\u5b50 and Zhongren \u4e2d\u4eba with the state of Zhongshan that had reemerged after a first conquest by Wei. Most important is perhaps the siege of the capital Handan by Wei in 354, after which both states concluded a peace treaty and fixed their borders anew. This was possible because Zhao was supported by Qi in the battle of Guiling \u6842\u9675.\n\nDuring his succession to the throne, Marquis Cheng was challenged by another pretender, Prince Gongzi Sheng \u516c\u5b50\u52dd. Marquis Cheng's own son Prince Yu \u8a9e was likewise challenged, in his part by Prince Gongzi Xie \u516c\u5b50\u7de4. The family relation of these princes and the main line is not clear. Prince Yu is known as Marquis Su \u8d99\u8085\u4faf (r. 350-326). He erected a fortified wall in the north of his territory, towards the land of the nomad tribes. Prince Yong \u96cd succeeded his father, Marquis Su. He is posthumously known as King Wuling \u8d99\u6b66\u9748\u738b (r. 326-299).\n\nKing Wuling's Counsellor-in-chief was Zhao Bao \u8d99\u8c79, who was granted the title of Lord Yangwen \u967d\u6587\u541b. In 317, Zhao allied with Wei and Han against Qin, but Qin prevailed and massacred 80,000 troops of the three allies. It was not only the large regional states that encroached on the territory of Zhao, but also the tribes of the Eastern Hu \u6771\u80e1, the Forest Hu \u6797\u80e1, and the Loufan \u6a13\u7169, all roaming in the lands north of Zhao. The King of Zhao therefore planned to transform part of his army into archer batallions (ji she \u9a0e\u5c04) to encounter their cavalry attacks more successful. The commanders of these armies had to wear \"barbarian clothes\" (hufu \u80e1\u670d), presumably short tunics and trousers better suited to cavalry warfare. In 305, 303 and 300, King Wuling attacked the kingdom of Zhongshan and each time forced the king of Zhongshan to cede more territory.\n\nIn 299, King Wuling decided to retire and to hand over the throne to his son Prince He \u4f55, yet without fully leaving the political stage. The new ruler is posthumously known as King Huiwen \u8d99\u60e0\u6587\u738b (r. 299-266). His Counsellor-in-chief was Fei Yi \u80a5\u7fa9. The \"father of the sovereign\" (zhufu \u4e3b\u7236), King Wuling, himself took over the task to supervise the northwestern border towards the land of the wild tribes. He also undertook an adventurous reconnaissance tour into the territory of Qin.\n\nIn 296, the King Father annihilated the state of Zhongshan and so consiberably enlarged the territory of Zhao. Prince Gongzi Zhang \u516c\u5b50\u7ae0 was given the title of Lord of Anyang \u5b89\u967d\u541b. He was advised by Tian Buli \u7530\u4e0d\u79ae, who also had to see it that the prince did not rebell against his brother, King Huiwen. While Counsellor Fei Yi secretly planned to eventually eliminate the threat posed by Prince Zhang, the latter observed an adequate conduct as subject of his younger brother, the king. The king father therefore considered dividing the territory of Zhao and making Prince Zhang king of Dai.\n\nYet Prince Zhang soon took action and killed Counsellor Fei Yi. The king was defended by Prince Gongzi Cheng \u516c\u5b50\u6210 and Li Dui \u674e\u514c who killed the rebel Prince Zhang and his advisor Tian Buli. Prince Cheng was rewarded with the title of Lord of Anping \u5b89\u5e73\u541b and was made Counsellor, while Li Dui was appointed Minister of Justice.\n\nA political problem had erupted because Prince Cheng had besieged the palace of the King Father in Shaqiu \u6c99\u4e18, where the rebellious Prince Zhang had fled to. In order to avoid being executed for insulting the king's father, they continued the siege, so that in the end King Wuling starved to death. Because King Huiwen was still young, Prince Cheng and Li Dui took over all governmental affairs as regents for the king. Supported by the famous coalition advisor Su Qin \u8607\u79e6, Li Dui decided to found an alliance with Qi, Chu, Wei and Han to attack the state of Qin in the west.\n\nIn 284, the troops of Zhao participated in the alliance against the state of Qi, in which Yan occupied almost the whole territory of Qi. In the next years general Lian Po \u5ec9\u9817 had the highest command of the army of Zhao and successfully waged war against Qi and Wei. Zhao and Wei were defeated by Qin in the battle of Huayang \u83ef\u967d after which 150,000 troops were massacred by Qin. Yet four years later Zhao was able to defeat Qin at Eyu \u95bc\u8207.\n\nIn 266, Prince Dan \u4e39 succeeded to the throne. His is known as King Xiaocheng \u8d99\u5b5d\u6210\u738b (r. 266-245). Because he was still young the Queen Dowager reigned for him. When Qin attacked the heartland of the state of Han around Shangdang \u4e0a\u9ee8, its ruler offered the territory to the king of Zhao in the hope that King Xiaocheng would better be able to defend it. In 260, Qin besieged the town of Changping \u9577\u5e73 that was already being defended by general Lian Po for several years. It was decided to replace him with Zhao Kuo \u8d99\u62ec, but the latter was not able to defend himself. He surrendered, and the general of Qin, Bai Qi \u767d\u8d77, allegedly buried alive all 400,000 surrendering troops. In the aftermath Qin was able to advance and besieged the capital of Zhao, Handan. The siege was lifted when a joint army of troops from Wei and Chu forced the army of Qin to withdraw. This coalition had been initiated by Lord Xinling \u4fe1\u9675\u541b from Wei and Lord Chunshen \u6625\u7533\u541b from Chu.\n\nIn 251, the king of Yan considered attacking Zhao because the army had been decimated in the battle of Changping. While Counsellor Li Fu \u6817\u8179, who had inspected the situation in Zhao, advocated a war against Zhao, Yue Xian \u6a02\u9592 (Yue Cheng \u6a02\u4e58) argued that Zhao was experienced with fighing and could not easily be brought down. The king of Yan nevertheless decided to wage war against Zhao, and his army, commanded by Li Fu and Qing Qin \u537f\u79e6, was heavily defeated by Lian Po. In the following year Zhao was even able to besiege the capital of Yan.\n\nPrince Yan \u5043 succeeded to the throne. He is known as King Daoxiang \u8d99\u60bc\u8944\u738b (r. 245-236). General Pang Nuan \u9f90\u7156 continued harrassing the state of Yan, but in 241 he functioned as highest commander of an allied army of troops from Zhao, Chu, Wei, Yan and Han in a campaign against Qin. King Daoxiang was succeeded by his son, Prince Qian \u9077, who is known as posthumously as King Youmiu \u8d99\u5e7d\u7e46\u738b (r. 236-228). When Zhao attacked Yan in the northeast, the troops of Qin under general Wang Jian \u738b\u7fe6 used this chance and resumed their attacks. They seized the towns of Eyu, Liaoyang \u6a51\u967d, Ye \u9134, and Anyang \u5b89\u967d, and then, instigated by these successes, launched a large campaign against Zhao. Two times the troops of Zhao were able to ward off the intruders, but Zhao was utterly exhausted by the long decades of war, and the generals Li Mu \u674e\u7267 and Sima Shang \u53f8\u99ac\u5c1a were not further able to defend the territory of Zhao. All the more, a terrible earthquake shook the region of Dai in 231.\n\nIn 228, the troops of Wang Jian and Xin Sheng \u8f9b\u52dd finally conquered Handan, the capital of Zhao, and captured King Youmiu. Prince Gongzi Jia \u516c\u5b50\u5609 fled to the region of Da,i where he proclaimed himself king of Dai. In 222, general Wang Ben \u738b\u8cc1 of Qin conquered this last stronghold of the house of Zhao.\n\n\n\nThe name of the old state of Zhao was only rarely used as name for a dynasty (two of the Sixteen Barbarian Kingdoms Shiliuguo \u5341\u516d\u570b), buy quite often for imperial princedoms. The same is true for the name Dai, which was used by the early Tuoba state of Dai \u4ee3 (315-376), and for princedoms.\n\nTable 1.

BCE) and was one of the so-called five hegemons (wuba \u4e94\u9738). His personal name was Mi Xiongl\u00fc \u8288\u718a\u4fb6 (also written \u718a\u5442 or \u718a\u65c5). The state of Chu is sometimes called Jing \u834a, and Xiongl\u00fc's posthumous title is also King Yan \u56b4\u738b.\n\nHe succeeded to the throne as son of King Mu \u695a\u7a46\u738b (r. 625-614). King Zhuang started his reign in a style of laissez-faire politics without much caring for the government. His advisors Wu Ju \u4f0d\u8209 and Su Cong \u8607\u5f9e opened him his eyes, so that he started restructuring the administration and strengthening the royal power with the support of Sunshu Ao \u5b6b\u53d4\u6556. The state took over the care for hydraulic works, dykes and dams, he built up a strong army and quelled the internal rebellion of a certain Ruo Ao \u82e5\u6556 (not King Ruo Ao, r. 791-764). His armies marched to the north, defeated the state of Song \u5b8b and the Rong \u620e barbarians of Luhun \u9678\u6e3e, and lined up before the domain of the king of Zhou \u5468.\n\nWith the awareness of his power King Zhuang of Chu menaced the King of Zhou and threatened him that Chu would be able to replace the house of Zhou. The armies of Chu then conquered a handfull of smaller states like Yong \u5eb8, Shu \u8212 and Chen \u9673, and in 602, King Zhuang was able to destroy the army of Jin \u6649 at Bi \u90b2 (modern Xingyang \u6ece\u967d, Henan).

The inscription inside the Ding documents that Prince Wu worshipped his ancestors and prayed for his offspring.

His personal name was Xiong L\u00fc (Chinese: \u718a\u65c5; pinyin: Xi\u00f3ng L\u01da), his ancestral name was Mi (Chinese: \u8288; pinyin: M\u01d0), and his posthumous title was King Zhuang. He was one of the five rulers dubbed the Five Hegemons by Xunzi and attempted to wrest control of China from King Ding of Zhou.[1]\n\nThe son of King Mu of Chu, Zhuang ascended the throne in 613 BC. According to a legend in the Records of the Grand Historian, for the first three years of his reign Zhuang wasted time in pleasure seeking, but, when challenged by two courtiers, reformed his ways.[2]\n\nThe king made Sunshu Ao his chancellor. Sunshu Ao began a series of major dam-works and an enormous planned reservoir in modern-day northern Anhui province.\n\nAfter some military successes, King Zhuang attempted to usurp King Ding of Zhou. According to a well-known story, probably an invention of the Warring States period, he asked a messenger from Zhou about the weight of the legendary Nine Tripod Cauldrons which Zhou possessed, a euphemism for seeking ultimate power in China, but was rebuffed. This incident gave rise to the chengyu \"to enquire about ding in the central plains\", i.e. to have great ambitions (simplified Chinese: \u95ee\u9f0e\u4e2d\u539f; traditional Chinese: \u554f\u9f0e\u4e2d\u539f; pinyin: w\u00e8n d\u01d0ng zh\u014dngyu\u00e1n).[2]\n\nIn the Battle of Bi, his army defeated the State of Jin.

BCE) is the first part of the so-called Eastern Zhou period (Dongzhou \u6771\u5468, 770-221 BCE). It is characterized by a significant decrease of political power of the kings of Zhou which had to flee to the eastern capital Chengzhou \u6210\u5468 (or Luoyi \u96d2\u9091, modern Luoyang \u6d1b\u967d, Henan) after their western and main capital Zongzhou \u5b97\u5468 (of Feng \u8c50, near modern Xi'an \u897f\u5b89, Shaanxi) had been attacked by the nomad tribes of the Quanrong \u72ac\u620e.\n\nPeriodization\n\nThe name of the historical period is derived from the chronicle of the regional state of Lu \u9b6f called Chunqiu \u6625\u79cb \"Spring and Autumn Annals\" because the seasons are always mentioned in the entries. The Annals cover the time from 722 to 481 BCE, yet the historical period is traditionally counted from the reign of King Ping of Zhou \u5468\u5e73\u738b (r. 770-720 BCE), who restored the Zhou dynasty in Luoyang, down to the division of the state of Jin \u6649 by the regional rulers (zhuhou \u8af8\u4faf) of Han \u97d3, Wei \u9b4f and Zhao \u8d99 in 376. Alternatively, the end of the Spring and Autumn period can be seen as 453, when the three viscounts (zi \u5b50) of Han, Wei and Zhao extinguished all other lateral lines to the house of Jin, or 403, when King Weilie of Zhou \u5468\u5a01\u70c8\u738b (r. 426-402) bestowed upon the viscounts of Han, Wei and Zhao the title of marquis (hou \u4faf).\n\nThe second great historiographical writing of the Spring and Autumn period is the collection Guoyu \u570b\u8a9e \"Discourses of the states\" that includes anecdotes of the states of Zhou \u5468, Lu \u9b6f, Qi \u9f4a, Jin \u6649, Zheng \u912d, Chu \u695a, Wu \u5433 and Yue \u8d8a. Said to be a composition of Zuo Qiuming \u5de6\u4e18\u660e, its oldest parts must have been compiled at the end of the 5th century BCE.\n\nConfucius\n\nThe most important intellectual person of this historical period was the philosopher Confucius (Kongzi \u5b54\u5b50; ca. 551-479) who tried to revive the ideal of the human and righteous rulers of old. Although his ideas seemed lost in a time of political realism his thoughts about state and society (\"Confucianism\") were to become the fundamental doctrine of imperial China.\n\nThe Early Decades of the Eastern Zhou and the Duke of Zheng\n\nThe eastern capital Chengzhou (Luoyang) did not provide the kings of Zhou with sufficient power. They were therefore dependent on the powerful regional rulers, especially those of Qin \u79e6, Jin, Qi and Chu. These are called the \"local rulers\" (fang bo \u65b9\u4f2f) because they practically ruled independently from the king of Zhou, and not any more as his vassals. It became common that the regional states acted on their own behalf regarding territory and military feuds, without asking the king of Zhou for formal permission. Duke Zhuang of Zheng \u912d\u838a\u516c (r. 743-701) even dared attacking King Huan \u5468\u6853\u738b (r. 720-697 BCE) who had not treated him properly according to the ritual regulations. Heijian \u9ed1\u80a9, the Duke of Zhou \u5468\u516c, even planned to kill King Huan's successor, King Zhuang \u5468\u838a\u738b (r. 697-682), and to replace him with Prince Ke \u514b. Yet Xin Bo \u8f9b\u4f2f warned the king and saved his life.\n\nDuke Zhuang of Zheng defeated intruding Rong \u620e tribes and swallowed the neighbouring state of Xu \u8a31. In 707 King Huan of Zhou \u5468\u6853\u738b (r. 719-697) started a punitive expedition against the Duke, but the king was defeated. From then on, the kings of Zhou never again tried to intervene into the politics of their own regional rulers. They stayed in their small royal domain around Luoyang and had to be content with the tributes of the regional rulers that were presented less and less regularly. Besides Zheng, the states of Song \u5b8b and Lu \u9b6f demonstrated their military and political power in the Central Plain.\n\nThe Rise of Duke Huan of Qi\n\nKing Li \u5468\u91d0\u738b (r. 682-677) was so helpless against the new threats endangering the empire that he allowed Duke Huan of Qi \u9f4a\u6853\u516c (r. 685-643) to adopt the title of hegemonial lord (ba \u9738, or bo \u4f2f). In this function the Duke defended the regional states against raids of barbarian tribes and cared for law and order among the states of the Middle Kingdom, with the motto \"support the king and ward off the barbarians\" (zun wang rang yi \u5c0a\u738b\u6518\u5937).\n\nIn the east, the state of Qi had rich natural ressources and became one of the mightiest regional states of the Eastern Zhou period.\n\nDuke Huan of Qi employed the legalist statesman Guan Zhong \u7ba1\u4ef2 as his adviser who reorganized administration and the military and financial systems. Through these reforms Qi was able to subdue Song and Lu and even the hegemonial state of Zheng. At that time, the non-Chinese nomad tribes of the Rong and Di \u72c4 undertook raids on the soil of Chinese states and devastated the states of Xing \u90a2 and Wei \u885b (modern Shanxi and Hebei). Duke Huan of Qi rescued the dynastic houses of these states and settled them down more to the south. The system of the hegemon thus developed to a kind of lord protector of a strong state over weaker ones, and Qi promised to protect the states in the Central Plain against further intrusions of the northern nomad warriors.\n\nThe Semi-Barbarian Kingdom of Chu\n\nIn the south, the state of Chu on the middle Yangtze River had become politically stronger than before. King Cheng of Chu \u695a\u6210\u738b (r. 671-626) started to challenge the hegemony of Qi and swallowed smaller states in his neighbourhood. Nonetheless, subservient states like Jiang \u6c5f and Huang \u9ec3 changed side and declared their alliance with Qi. Chu thereupon attacked Zheng. Duke Huan assembled the regional rulers and created an alliance with Lu, Song, Chen and Wei to punish Chu in 656 by devastating the state of Cai \u8521, an ally of Chu. Chu gave in, and the ambassadors of the two mighty states met at Shaoling \u53ec\u9675 (modern Yancheng \u90fe\u57ce, Henan) to conclude a peaceful alliance (meng \u76df).\n\nThe System of Hegemonial Lordship\n\nIn 651 Qi organized a meeting at Kuiqiu \u8475\u4e18 (modern Lankao \u862d\u8003, Henan) whith the representatives of Lu, Song, Zheng and Wei, and in presence of a royal diplomat from Zhou. The members of the meeting decided that states creating a friendly alliance should never attack each other, and that they had to assist each other in case that one partner was attacked. The Duke of Qi thus became the overlord over the weaker states of Zhou China and replaced the king of Zhou as the highest judicial person.\n\nSuccession Crises at the Zhou Court\n\nWhen King Li died a succession crisis endangered the house of Zhou. His righteous heir was Prince Kan \u95ac, who is known as King Hui \u5468\u60e0\u738b (r. 677-652), but his late grandfather, King Zhuang, had had a favourite son called Prince Tui \u7a68. King Hui was not a very intelligent ruler. He offended many of his highest ministers and caused a rebellion that forced him to flee to Wen \u6eab (modern Wenxian \u6eab\u7e23, Henan) and then to Li \u6adf, a town in the state of Zheng. His uncle Prince Tui was made King of Zhou, but he did not prove a better ruler. He was therefore attacked and killed by the lords of Zheng and Guo \u8662. King Hui returned to the throne.\n\nWhen King Hui died he was succeeded by his son Prince Zheng \u912d, who is known as King Xiang \u5468\u8944\u738b (r. 652-619). King Xiang had a half-brother called Shudai \u53d4\u5e36 (or Dai \u5e36), who had been the favourite son of King Hui. Prince Shudai planned to usurp the throne and joined forces with the Rong and Di \u7fdf tribes. The plot failed and Prince Shudai fled to Qi. It was a high minister of Qi, the reformer Guan Zhong, who mediated the peace treaty between the house of Zhou and the Rong tribes. A decade later the king of Zhou even allowed Prince Shudai to return.\n\nWhen the state of Zheng attacked in 639 the statelet of Hua \u6ed1, whose lords were relatives to the house of Zhou, King Xiang sent You Sun \u6e38\u5b6b and Bo Fu \u4f2f\u670d as diplomats to negotiate peace. Yet the Duke of Zheng arrested the diplomats. The King thereupon ordered the Di tribes to attack Zheng, inspite of the remonstances of minister Fu Chen \u5bcc\u8fb0. Fu Chen was also not content with the King's will to marry a Di princess in order to reward the Di chieftain for his support. His critics were justified because only a few years later King Xiang discarded the \"barbarian\" queen, which caused an attack of the Di on the royal capital, during which the Earl of Tan \u8b5a (or the earls of Yuan \u539f and Mao \u6bdb) was/were killed. Fu Chen thereupon threw himself into battle against the intruders and died. King Xiang fled to Zheng and was received by the duke of Zheng, in spite of all former discrepancies.\n\nIn the meantime Prince Dai was enthroned as King of Zhou, yet he took residence in Wen, not in Luoyang. He invited the Di queen to return to the royal domain. Two years later King Xiang asked the duke of Jin for help, who willingly attacked the usurper and executed him. King Xiang, returning to the throne, rewarded Duke Wen of Jin \u6649\u6587\u516c (r. 636-628) with the title of hegemonial lord and presented him with some territory. Duke Wen was thereafter the most powerful political leader of the Middle Kingdom and assembled the regional rulers, including his formal superior, the King of Zhou, at Heyang \u6cb3\u967d and Jiantu \u8e10\u571f. The kings of Zhou were now wholly dependent from support by other political actors. Histories nevertheless concealed this shameful situation with terms like \"royal hunt at Heyang\".\n\nThe Rise of the Regional State of Jin\n\nAfter the death of Duke Huan of Qi several regional rulers strove for overlordship. Duke Xiang of Song \u5b8b\u8944\u516c (r. 650-637) was defeated by Chu, and the state of Song lost its last chance to rise to political and military significance. Instead, the state of Jin rose to supremacy in old China: Duke Xian of Jin \u6649\u737b\u516c (r. 676-651) had already extended the power of his state by swallowing the statelets of Geng \u803f, Huo \u970d, Wei \u9b4f (a state that was later one of the three destructors of Jin), Guo \u8662 and Yu \u865e. After a decade of inner struggles, the state of Qin supported Duke Wen of Jin in his ascension to the throne of Jin.\n\nJust as Duke Huan of Qi, Duke Wen of Jin employed political advisors, Zhao Shuai \u8d99\u8870 (Zhao Chengzi \u8d99\u6210\u5b50) and Hu Yan \u72d0\u5043, who strengthened the \"national\" economy and so the military power of the state. In 635 the King Xiang of Zhou escaped from inner disturbances to the state of Zheng. Duke Wen of Jin saw his chance, rescued the king and accompanied him back to the royal domain, for which support he was highly rewarded by the King.\n\nThe next step for the Duke was to challenge the power of the southern, semi-Chinese state of Chu that had dominated the Central Plain since the death of Duke Huan of Qi. In 632 the two states clashed at the battle of Chengpu \u57ce\u6fee (modern Zhencheng \u7504\u57ce, Shandong), and Chu was defeated. Duke Wen of Jin established a new friendly alliance during the meeting at Jiantu \u8e10\u571f (modern Yingze \u6ece\u6fa4, Henan) with the seven most important states. In the same year, at Wen, the King of Zhou sanctified the hegemony by Jin. Duke Wen's successor Duke Xiang \u6649\u8944\u516c (r. 627-621) was able to prolong the hegemonial prevalence of the state of Jin.\n\nConflict Between Qin and Jin\n\nDuring the reign of Duke Xiang of Jin, Duke Mu of Qin \u79e6\u7a46\u516c (r. 659-621) opened a long period of military confrontation between Jin and Qin, but Qin seldomly won any battle. The powerful state of Jin blocked the gate to the Central Plain, and Qin could not but expand its territory to the west into the territory of the Western Rong tribes \u897f\u620e and establish good relations with Chu in the south. Chu meanwhile further expanded its territory by conquering the statelets of Jiang \u6c5f, Lu \u516d (a special reading!), and Liao \u84fc. After the death of Duke Xiang of Jin, the noble Zhao Dun \u8d99\u76fe (Zhao Xuanzi \u8d99\u5ba3\u5b50) dominated the throne succession of Jin, murdered Duke Ling \u6649\u9748\u516c (r. 620-607) and enthroned Duke Cheng \u6649\u6210\u516c (r. 606-600). During this period Jin lost its initiative in \"foreign\" politics. The political advisor Fan Shan \u8303\u5c71 proposed to King Mu of Chu \u695a\u7a46\u738b (r. 625-614) to take the chance and to advance against the north.\n\nThe Rise of the State of Chu\n\nKing Zhuang of Chu \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 613-591) had to resolve internal quarrels and uprisings of aboriginal tribes before he was able to reform economic and military administration and to resume this expansion politics. In 606 the southern king sent out an envoy to the court of King Ding of Zhou \u5468\u5b9a\u738b (r. 606-586) to express his will to swallow the royal domain of Zhou. In 598 King Zhuang of Chu crushed the small state of Chen \u9673, one year later the state of Zheng. At the battle of Bi \u90b2 (near modern Zhengzhou \u912d\u5dde, Henan) the army of the hegemonial state of Jin was defeated.\n\nA few years later, Chu defeated the state of Song and finally obtained the overlordship over the Central Plain. The protecting task of the overlord had gradually lost its original intention and became a system of hegemony of one major state over weak satellites of Chinese and \"barbarian\" origin. The attitude to help small states during internal quarrels and against \"barbarian\" invaders changed to a regular intervention into political affairs to the advantage of the great states.\n\nInternal Quarrels in Jin\n\nThe state of Qi observed the growing power of Chu, declared a friendly relationship with the southern king of Chu, who was the only regional ruler who called himself king, except, of course, the King of Zhou. Qi repeatedly attacked the smaller states of Lu and Wei which therefore asked for support the former hegemonial state of Jin. In 589, the army of Jin fought with Qi in the battle of An \u978d (modern Jinan \u6fdf\u5357, Shandong) and once again demonstrated its superior military power. Chu instantly declared war to Jin, but neither Chu nor Jin dared to initiate a concrete campaign.\n\nAfter long years of hesitation and negotiations (under the stipulation of Jin's political advisor Song Huayuan \u5b8b\u83ef\u5143) Chu attacked Zheng and Wei in 576. One year later the armies of the two hegemonial states fought in the famous battle of Yanling \u9122\u9675 (modern Yanling, Henan) in which Jin prevailed by a narrow margin. Duke Li of Jin \u6649\u53b2\u516c (r. 580-573) saw his chance to resume hegemony, murdered his mightiest noblemen Xi Zhi \u90e4\u81f3, Xi Qi \u90e4\u9321 and Xi Chou \u90e4\u72a8 (the \"Three Xi\" \u4e09\u90e4). Yet instead of having strengthened his own position, Duke Li faced serious opposition by the Jin aristocracy like Luan Shu \u6b12\u66f8 and Xun Yan \u8340\u5043 who eventually killed their lord.\n\nUnder the next ruler, Duke Dao \u6649\u60bc\u516c (r. 572-558), the internal situation calmed down, and the duke was able to strengthen the position of the state of Jin. His political advisor Wei Jiang \u9b4f\u7d73 proposed to appease the nomad warriors of the Rong with financial tributes instead of fighting them. In 571 Jin erected a fortification wall at Hulao \u864e\u7262 (modern Fanshui \u6c3e\u6c34, Henan) against the state of Zheng that was backed by Chu.\n\nAfter more than two decades of relative peace the political advisor Song Xiangxu \u5b8b\u5411\u620c proposed to organize a peace conference to end military conflict. It was held in the capital of Jin in 546 and the participating fourteeen states decided to accept the overlordship of the two states of Jin and Chu. Their adherents had to declare their subjection under the respective overlordship and to present tributes to the two hegemons. Among the participating states, there would be ten years of peace, and for more than fourty years, Jin and Chu would not meet at the battle field again.\n\nOnly two of the larger states did not participate in the general peace: Qi, and Qin.\n\nThe old kingdom of Zhou had totally lost its political role. The tributes once paid to the kings of Zhou were now offered to the dukes of Jin and the kings of Chu. If a small state did not pay tribute it had to expect military sanctions. Especially precarious was the role of the state of Lu that had to maintain good relationships to the three states of Jin, Chu and Qi, if it did not want to be swallowed by one of them. Very similar was the role of Zheng that was directly in the line of fire between Jin and Chu. But states like Lu also imitated the overlordship of their own masters and demanded tributes from yet smaller states like Teng \u6ed5, Qi \u675e or Zeng \u912b.\n\nThe Rise of the Semi-Barbarian States of Wu and Yue\n\nDuring the relatively peaceful sixth century, the two southern non-Chinese coastal states of Wu \u5433 and Yue \u8d8a emerged as new powers. Jin saw its chance to open a second flank against Chu, and in 583 Duke Wuchen of Shen \u7533\u516c\u5deb\u81e3 was sent to Wu in order to seek a military alliance. The semi-barbarian state of Wu was equipped with military tools and Wu soldiers were trained to attack Chu. But it was only more than half a century later that Wu became a serious threat to Chu after swallowing the statelet of Xu \u5f90.\n\nUnder King Hel\u00fc \u95d4\u95ad (r. 514-496) the political advisor Wu Yuan \u4f0d\u54e1 proposed to raise three armies that clockwise were to skirmish at the borders of Chu to weaken this state. In 506 the whole army of Wu finally attacked Chu and defeated this state at Baiju or Boju \u67cf\u8209 (modern Macheng \u9ebb\u57ce, Hubei). In pursuit of the escaping enemy, the army of Wu advanced to the capital of Chu, Yingdu \u90e2\u90fd (modern Jiangling \u6c5f\u9675, Hebei). King Zhao of Chu \u695a\u662d\u738b (r. 516-489) had to take his flight and sought for help in Qin. This western state sent out chariots that expelled the invaders from Wu.\n\nWu's neighbour Yue took the advantage of the prolonged campaigns against Chu to invade Wu. In 496, Wu set its troops into march to carry out a punitive expedition against Yue, but King Hel\u00fc died in the battle of Zuili \u6a87\u674e (modern Jiaxing \u5609\u8208, Zhejiang). Two years later, King Fucha \u592b\u5dee of Wu (r. 495-473) defeated Yue during the revenge battle of Fujiao \u592b\u6912 (modern Suzhou \u8607\u5dde, Jiangsu). Goujian \u53e5\u8e10, king of Yue (r. 496-465), fled to Mount Guiji \u6703\u7a3d\u5c71 (south of modern Shaoxing \u7d39\u8208, Zhejiang).\n\nAlthough Fucha's advisor Wu Yuan proposed to destroy the state of Yue, the king of Wu was content with his success in battle and the destruction of the capital of Yue. After the defeat of Chu and Yue, King Fucha turned his attention to the north. He had a fortification wall built at Han \u9097 (near modern Yangzhou \u63da\u5dde, Jiangsu) and dug out canals (see Grand Canal) that connected the Yangtze River with the Huai River \u6dee\u6c34 valley, creating a traffic line to the north and the possibility to move troops faster. The small states of Lu and Zhu \u90be declared themselves subjects to Wu. In the years 485 and 484 Wu attacked several times the state of Qi by land and by river and finally defeated Qi in the battle of Ailing \u827e\u9675 (modern Laiwu \u840a\u856a, Shandong). Wu assembled the states of the Central Plain to a meeting at Huangchi \u9ec3\u6c60 (modern Fengqiu \u5c01\u4e18, Henan), with the intention to declare its hegemony. Jin, weakened by internal struggles, did not dare to challenge the new powerful state of Wu, and King Fucha became the new hegemon.\n\nJust during the conference of Huangchi, King Goujian of Yue took the chance and invaded the capital of Wu. The overstretched military power of the state of Wu was unable to withstand the southern opponent who had rebuilt its strength after the defeat of Guiji. In 473, Yue destroyed the state of Wu and replaced it as the dominating power of the southeast. King Goujian of Yue was the last of the so-called Five Hegemons (Wuba \u4e94\u9738).\n\nThe Five Hegemons are also called the \"Five Earls\" (Wubo \u4e94\u4f2f). Different literary sources and commentaries identify them with different persons. The traditional definition by Zhao Qi \u8d99\u5c90 defines them as Duke Huan of Qi, Duke Wen of Jin, Duke Mu of Qin, Duke Xiang of Song, and King Zhuang of Chu. The book Xunzi \u8340\u5b50 identifies them with Duke Huan of Qi, Duke Wen of Jin, King Zhuang of Chu, King Hel\u00fc of Wu and King Goujian of Yue.\n\nThe Disintegration of the Old Order of Regional States\n\nIn the mid-5th century BCE there were four states that dominated old China: Chu in the south, Yue in the southwest, Jin in the north, and Qi in the east. Yet things were to change soon: Inner conflicts toppled two of the reigning houses (Jin and Qi), new powers emerged (Wei \u9b4f, Zhao \u8d99 and Han \u97d3), and reforms in the administration of several states created a new type of \"modernized\" regional state: the centralized state with a strengthened \"national\" economy and a professional army. The administration of the state by nobles related to the ruling house was replaced by a bureaucratic officialdom.\n\nThe state Lu was the first that felt the power of noble families which challenged the ducal house, in this case the Three Huan (Sanhuan \u4e09\u6853, descendants of Duke Huan \u9b6f\u6853\u516c) the Jisun \u5b63\u5b6b, Mengsun \u5b5f\u5b6b (Zhongsun \u4ef2\u5b6b) and Shusun \u53d4\u5b6b. From the time of Duke Xi \u9b6f\u50d6\u516c (r. 659-627) on these three noble families dominated the state of Lu. Duke Zhao \u9b6f\u662d\u516c (r. 541-510) even had to escape from their intrigues and died abroad. At the beginning of the fifth century minor nobles like Nan Kuai \u5357\u84af, Yang Hu \u967d\u864e and Hou Fan \u4faf\u72af rebelled against the mighty families and took over the rule of Lu.\n\nDescendants of the dukes of Song fought for the domination within the small state: the families Hua \u83ef, Yue \u6a02, Lao \u8001, Huang \u7687 (descendants of Duke Dai \u5b8b\u6234\u516c, r. 799-766), Yu \u9b5a, Dang \u8569, Lin \u9c57 and Xiang \u5411 (descendants of Duke Huan \u5b8b\u6853\u516c, r. 681-651). In the permanent power struggles only the families Yue and Huang survived the Spring and Autumn period.\n\nThe seven descendant lineages of Duke Mu of Zheng \u912d\u7a46\u516c (r. 627-606) also gradually lost their power in the course of the Spring and Autum period.\n\nIn the state of Qi, the government was led by the lineages of Guo \u570b, Gao \u9ad8, Cui \u5d14 and Qing \u6176. In this state it was a family not related to the ducal house that took over power in Qi: the family Tian \u7530, descendants of a prince from Chen, Tian Jingzhong \u7530\u656c\u4ef2, who had come to Qi in 672 while escaping internal disturbances in Chen. Under Duke Jing \u9f4a\u666f\u516c (r. 547-490), Jingzhong's descendant Tian Qi \u7530\u4e5e was ennobled and from this position collected wealth and power enough to annihilate the families Guo and Gao. His son Tian Chang \u7530\u5e38 was already wealthier than the Duke himself and sent his ambassadors to the neighbouring states. His descendants would eventually replace the reigning house in Qi.\n\nThe most tremendous power challenge from within took place in the state of Jin where descendants of the ducal line were not invested as regional governors (dafu \u5927\u592b). But this measure did not prevent other noble families from trying to dominate the court of Jin: Hu \u72d0, Zhao \u8d99, Xian \u5148, Xi \u90e4 and Xu \u80e5 were the dominating noble clans of the middle Spring and Autumn period, and were later replaced by the families Han \u97d3, Wei \u9b4f, Luan \u6b12, Fan \u8303 and Xun \u8340. At the beginning of the 5th century the noble families of Zhao, Wei, Han, Fan, Zhonghang \u4e2d\u884c and Zhi \u667a survived the internal struggle. The three first could destroy the last three and dissolved the dukedom of Jin, dividing its territory among themselves.\n\nDuring the reign of King Ding of Zhou \u5468\u5b9a\u738b (r. 607-586), the southern ruler King Zhuang of Chu \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 613-591) advanced his armies as far as the valley of River Luo in the pursuit of the Rong tribes of Luhun \u9678\u6e3e. The king of Chu used this situation pay the king of Zhou a visit, but King Ding only sent Prince Man \u6eff (\"Royal Grandson Man\" \u738b\u5b6b\u6eff) to confer with the semi-barbarian king of Chu. They talked about the so-called \"nine tripods\" (jiuding \u4e5d\u9f0e) erected in the capital that symbolized the nine regions of the kingdom of Zhou.\n\nAfter the death of King Ling of Zhou \u5468\u9748\u738b (r. 572-545) and during the reign of King Jing \u5468\u666f\u738b (r. 545-521) a succession crisis beset the house of Zhou. The heir apparent, Prince Sheng \u8056, had died prematurely. King Jing preferred his oldest son Prince Chao \u671d, yet when the king died, Prince Gai \u4e10 was supported by a strong party among the courtiers. The highest ministers enthroned Prince Meng \u731b, who was immediately attacked and killed by the adherents of Prince Chao. Prince Meng is posthumously known as King Dao \u5468\u60bc\u738b (r. 521-520). Prince Chao proclaimed himself king of Zhou, yet Prince Gai on his side asked for support by the duke of Jin and finally made it to the throne. He is known as King Jing \u5468\u656c\u738b (r. 520-476). Prince Chao, who had reigned for four years, fled to Chu. In 504, when he had assembled a sufficient number of supporters, he attacked King Jing and forced him to flee to Jin. A year later Duke Ding of Jin \u6649\u5b9a\u516c (r. 512-475) helped King Jing back on the throne."}, {"url": "http://chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/rulers-chu.html", "page_content": "Nov 1, 2018 \u00a9 Ulrich Theobald\n\nDon't confound his regional state of the Zhou period with the empire of Chu \u695a (926-951), one of the Ten Kingdoms \u5341\u570b (902-979) of the Five Dynasties period \u4e94\u4ee3 (907-960).\n\nThe state of Chu \u695a was a regional state of the Zhou period \u5468 (11th cent.-221 BCE). It belonged to the larger polities that were able to survive until the end of the Warring States period \u6230\u570b (5th cent.-221 BCE). Chu is known for its culture that was significantly different from that of the states of the Central Plain. Chu was not among the states that were distributed as a regional states at the beginning of the Western Zhou period \u897f\u5468 (11th cent.-770 BCE). Its ruling dynasty was of a different origin than most of the regional dynasties of the Zhou empire. Another name of Chu is Jing \u834a. Chu was first located in the valley of the River Han \u6f22 and then moved southeast into the Yangtze Valley. During the Spring and Autumn period \u6625\u79cb (770 - 5th cent. BCE) it gradually expanded towards the north and east.\n\nMap 1. The regional state of Chu \u695a (11th cent. - 223 BCE) Map according to Tan Qixiang \u8c2d\u5176\u9aa7 (1987), Zhongguo lishi ditu ji \u4e2d\u56fd\u5386\u53f2\u5730\u56fe\u96c6. Chu was located in the middle course of the Yangtze River and gradually expanded to the east and northeast. It played the role of temporary ally for the states of Qi and Qin, before the latter dominated over all regional states and founded the empire of Qin. Click to enlarge.\n\nThe semi-barbarian state of Chu becomes part of the middle kingdom\n\nThe ruling house of Chu derived its descendancy from the mythical Emperor Zhuan Xu \u9853\u980a, himself being a grandson of the Yellow Emperor \u9ec3\u5e1d. Zhuan Xu's great-grandson Zhong Li \u91cd\u9ece was the minister for fire (huo zheng \u706b\u6b63) of the mythical Emperor Di Ku \u5e1d\u56b3. For his merits earned in office, Zhong Li was bestowed the name of Zhu Rong \u795d\u878d. He was sent out to punish the rebellious lord of the waters, Gong Gong \u5171\u5de5, but Zhu Rong/Zhong Li was unable to kill Gong Gong. Enraged about this failure, Emperor Di Ku executed Zhong Li and had his brother Wu Hui \u5433\u56de take over the duties as minister of fire. Wu Hui had six grandsons that were called Kun Wu \u6606\u543e, Shen Hu \u53c3\u80e1, Peng Zu \u5f6d\u7956, Hui Ren \u6703\u4eba, Ji Lian \u5b63\u9023 and an unnamed son that was given the family name of Cao \u66f9. Five branches of the family fell into oblivion, except the descendants of Ji Lian who adopted the family name of Xiong \u718a or Mi \u7f8b (originally written \u5b2d).\n\nExcavated objects from the late Warring States period prove that the reigning dynasty of Chu also bore the family name Yan \u9153. Mi Xiong allegedly took part in King Wu's \u5468\u6b66\u738b conquest of the Shang empire \u5546 (17th-11th cent. BCE).\n\nIn the early decades of the Zhou period, King Cheng of Zhou \u5468\u6210\u738b (r. 1116-1079 BCE) made the family Mi regional rulers over the country of Chu in the middle Yangtze valley. From that time on they adopted the family name Mi, yet the rulers retained the surname Xiong. Xiong might also be a prefix of the personal name worn by all members of the family. In the late 11th century King Zhao of Zhou \u5468\u662d\u738b undertook several military campaigns against Chu during one of which he died, while his own army drowned in the River Han. The rulers of Chu called themselves \"king\" (wang \u738b) and therefore demonstrated that they were actually not part of the system of regional states of the Zhou empire.\n\nYu Xiong's great-grandson Xiong Yi \u718a\u7e79 settled near Mt. Jingshan \u834a\u5c71 (modern Nanzhang \u5357\u6f33, Hubei) and, after being appointed regional ruler (zhuhou \u8af8\u4faf) by King Cheng of Zhou, moved to Danyang \u4e39\u967d (modern Zigui \u79ed\u6b78, Hubei).\n\nViscount (zi \u5b50) Xiong Qu \u718a\u6e20 became aware that the house of Zhou was weakening and expanded his rule along the middle Yangtze valley up into the valley of River Han. He conquered the statelets of Yong \u5eb8 and Yangyue \u63da\u7cb5. He made his oldest song Wukang \u6bcb\u5eb7 king of Goutan \u53e5\u4eb6, his second son Zhihong \u646f\u7d05 king of E \u9102, and his youngest son Zhici \u57f7\u75b5 king of Yuezhang \u8d8a\u7ae0. Later on he feared that the king of Zhou would attack him because of the usurpation of the title of king and stripped his sons off their ranks as kings.\n\nAfter the death of Viscount Xiong Shuang \u718a\u971c his three sons indeed contended for the throne of Chu. The youngest son, Jixun \u5b63\u5f87 (Xiong Xun \u718a\u5f87), was finally able to occupy the throne. When Fen Mao \u86a1\u5192 (r. 758-741), also called Xiong Xun \u718a\u7734, died, his younger brother Xiong Tong \u718a\u901a assassinated the heir apparent and usurped the throne. He is posthumously called King Wu of Chu \u695a\u6b66\u738b (r. 741-690) because he carried out numerous military campaigns, like that against the statelet of Sui \u96a8, whose marquis, hoping to escape defeat, offered to Xiong Tong to travel to the court of the King of Zhou to reconfirm Xiong Tong in his royal position, but the King of Zhou declined. Enraged about the King of Zhou's refusal, Xiong Tong decided to adopt the title of king without the permission by the Son of Heaven, concluded an alliance with the marquis of Sui and occupied the territory of the hundred Pu tribes \u767e\u6fee south of the Yangtze River. Xiong Tong later suspected the marquis of Sui of treason and planned to occupy his territory, but he died en route to the battlefield.\n\nHis son Xiong Zi \u718a\u8cb2 mounted the throne. Zi is posthumously known as King Wen \u695a\u6587\u738b (r. 690-677). He was the first ruler of Chu who took residence in Ying \u90e2 (near modern Shashi \u6c99\u5e02, Hubei) instead of Danyang. Xiong Zi conquered several small states, like Xi \u606f (modern Xixian \u606f\u7e23\uff0c Henan), Shen \u7533 (modern Nanyang \u5357\u967d, Henan) and Deng \u9127 (modern Xiangfan \u8944\u6a0a, Hubei). His son Zhuang'ao \u838a\u6556 (ao was a kind of temple name, like the Chinese zong \u5b97), known as Xiong Jian \u718a\u56cf (also written \u718a\u8271), planned to kill his brother Xiong Yun \u718a\u60f2 (also written \u718a\u9835), but the latter escaped to Sui and gained sufficient support to usurp the throne of his brother. Xiong Yun is posthumously known as King Cheng \u695a\u6210\u738b (r. 672-626). Unlike his predecessors, King Cheng was a peaceful ruler who sent appropriate tributes to the court of the king of Zhou, so that he was ordered to appease the barbarian tribes of the south instead of harassing the states in the Yellow River plain.\n\nIn 656 the hegemonial lord (ba \u9738) Duke Huan of Qi \u9f4a\u6853\u516c (r. 685-643) attacked Chu, but King Cheng was able to urge his troops to stop and concluded a peace alliance (meng \u76df) in the conference of Zhaoling \u53ec\u9675 (modern Yancheng \u90fe\u57ce, Henan). In his later years King Cheng waged war against the statelets of Xu \u8a31, Xian \u5f26 (near modern Xixian, Henan), Huang \u9ec3 (modern Huanchuan \u6f62\u5ddd, Henan) and Ying \u82f1. Duke Xiang of Song \u5b8b\u8944\u516c (r. 650-637), the new hegemonial lord, dispatched an envoy to Chu to offer a peaceful alliance, but the king refused and soon attacked Song \u5b8b and defeated the duke in the battle of Hong \u6cd3 (modern Zhecheng \u67d8\u57ce, Henan) and also the state of Zheng \u912d. Duke Xiang died from a wound received during the battle.\n\nIn 634 Duke Xi of Lu \u9b6f\u50d6\u516c (r. 659-627) arrived at the court of Chu and requested an army to punish the Duke of Qi \u9f4a. King Cheng sent out the Marquis of Shen \u7533 who conquered the territory of Gu \u7a40, where Duke Huan's son Yong \u96cd was instated as the local governor. The other sons of the Duke of Qi fled to Chu and were all made nobles in Chu. The statelet of Kui \u5914 was conquered, and then King Cheng attacked the state of Song. The Duke of Song requested support by the army of Jin \u6649. King Cheng thereupon withdrew because Duke Wen of Jin \u6649\u6587\u516c (r. 636-628), had been his exiled guest for a long time, and sent only out Ziyu \u5b50\u7389 with a small contingent that was defeated.\n\nAgainst the advice of Prime Minister (lingyin \u4ee4\u5c39) Zishang \u5b50\u4e0a, King Chen nominated his beloved son Shangchen \u5546\u81e3 heir apparent. Later on he deposed Shangchen in favour to Zhi \u8077. Shangchen thereupon arrested King Cheng and forced him to commit suicide. He mounted the throne, posthumously called King Mu \u695a\u7a46\u738b (r. 626-614). His chief counsellor was Pan Chong \u6f58\u5d07. King Mu conquered the statelets of Jiang \u6c5f (modern Xixian, Henan) and Lu \u516d (a special reading, modern Lu'an \u516d\u5b89, Anhui) and attacked the state of Chen \u9673.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son L\u00fc \u4fb6, who is posthumously known as King Zhuang \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 614-591). King Zhuang did not attend the court, indulged in pleasures and even ordered to execute those who dared remonstrating against him. Wu Ju \u4f0d\u8209 thereupon used a riddle to admonish him, but without success. Only Su Cong \u8607\u5f9e was able to open the king's eyes so that he started caring for political matters again. During his campaign against the Rong barbarians \u620e of Luhun \u9678\u6e3e, King Zhuang visited the capital of the kings of Zhou in Luoyang \u6d1b\u967d (modern Luoyang, Henan) and was received by royal grandson Man \u738b\u5b6b\u6eff. The latter convinced him that the Heavenly Mandate (tianming \u5929\u547d) of the Zhou dynasty had not yet ended, in spite of the obvious weakness of the royal house.\n\nIn 597 Chu defeated the army of Jin near Bi \u90b2 (near modern Zhengzhou \u912d\u5dde, Henan). In 594 Chu besieged the capital of Song for five months and conquered the statelet of Yong \u5eb8 (near modern Zhushan \u7af9\u5c71, Hubei), later Shu-Liao \u8212\u84fc (modern Shucheng \u8212\u57ce, Anhui) and Xiao \u856d (near modern Xuzhou \u5f90\u5dde, Jiangsu).\n\nAfter the conquest of Chen, King Zhuang wanted to transform it into a district of Chu, but Shen Shu \u7533\u53d4 of Qi criticized the king, so that he reinstated the house of Chen. Yet his next step was to conquer the state of Zheng. After the lord of Zheng had begged for mercy, King Zhuang released him and created an alliance of peace. In 575 the army of Chu defeated the relieve army from Jin in the battle of Yanling \u9122\u9675 (modern Yanling, Henan). The rule of King Zhuang is seen as the apogee of the power of the state of Chu among the regional states of the Zhou period. He was accepted as hegemonial lord (ba \u9738).\n\nKing Zhuang was succeeded by his son Shen \u5be9, posthumously known as King Gong \u695a\u5171\u738b (r. 591-560). During his reign the army of Chu was defeated by Jin. The next ruler was King Gong's son Zhao \u62db, posthumously known as King Kang \u695a\u5eb7\u738b (r. 560-545). The latter was succeeded by his son Yuan \u54e1, who is also known as Jia'ao \u90df\u6556 (r. 545-541). King Kang had four younger brothers called Wei \u570d, Zibi \u5b50\u6bd4, Zixi \u5b50\u6673 and Qiji \u5f03\u75be. Wei was made Prime Minister and commander of the army. When Jia'ao fell ill, Wei entered the palace, strangulated the king and killed his sons Mo \u83ab and Pingxia \u5e73\u590f. Zibi fled to Jin, while Wei mounted the throne. He is posthumously known as King Ling \u695a\u9748\u738b (r. 541-529).\n\nChu as a major power of the Warring States\n\nKing Ling was able to assemble the regional rulers and to take over the lead as a factual hegemon of the regional states. Minister Wu Ju warned the king to become over-confident in his superior role, yet King Ling commanded the regional states in a campaign against the state of Wu \u5433. Qing Feng \u6176\u5c01, the commander of the troops of Wu, was kept prisoner, but dared criticizing King Ling for the way his fathers had come to the throne of Chu, and was therefore immediately executed by the king. He had the Zhanghua Terrace \u7ae0\u83ef\u81fa built where he received noble refugees from other states. Prince Qiji was ordered to attack the state of Chen, and King Ling invited the marquis of Cai \u8521 in order to poison him. Prince Qiji conquered the headless state of Cai and usurped the throne of the small marquisate.\n\nIn 530 BCE, King Ling attacked the small state of Xu \u5f90, located northwest of the state of Wu, and Lai \u8cf4 (modern Suizhou \u96a8\u5dde, Hubei). Chen was heavily deafeated and its dynasty brought to an end. At that moment, King Ling deliberated with his nobles whether he was strong enough to claim the same rights as the other regional rulers. Grand master (dafu \u5927\u592b) Xi Fu \u6790\u7236 answered that in old times, the state of Chu had been a very remote and less developed country, but now the King of Zhou would not refuse to bestow to the King of Chu bronze tripods as a symbol of royal power, and none of the other states would refuse to exchange gifts with the state of Chu.\n\nWhen King Ling was on campaign against Wu in the camp of Ganxi \u4e7e\u6eaa, the king of Wu was advised by Guan Cong \u89c0\u5f9e, a son of a noble of Cai whom King Ling had killed. The King of Wu joined a secret alliance with the state of Yue \u8d8a, whose nobleman Chang Shouguo \u5e38\u58fd\u904e had also been insulted by the king of Chu. Wu and Yue attacked Cai and won over Qiji, who was able to kill the heir apparent of Chu, Prince Lu \u797f. Zibi was enthroned as king of Chu, Zixi was made Prime Minister, and Qiji Minister of War (sima \u53f8\u99ac). Guan Cong thereupon travelled to the camp of King Ling and presented him with the facts of the rebellion at home. The army of Chu dispersed and left the king alone. King Ling wandered around in the wilderness and finally died of hunger because the new ruler had forbidden giving him anything to eat.\n\nThe new king, Zibi, was for a long time in an unclear state about the whereabouts of King Ling, and finally committed suicide, together with Zixi. Qiji renamed himself Xiong Ju \u718a\u5c45 and proclaimed himself king of Chu. He is posthumously known as King Ping \u695a\u5e73\u738b (r. 527-516).\n\nIn fear of revenge, King Ping demonstrated a benevolent government towards the common people and restored the territories of the states of Chen and Cai, enthroning members of the former ruling houses. The eastern parts of Chu were plundered by the armies of Wu during this interlude of internal war in Chu.\n\nKing Ping decided to marry his son, Crown Prince Jian \u5efa, with a princess from Qin \u79e6. Yet the girl was so beautiful that the king decided to take her for himself, and she gave birth to Prince Zhen \u8eeb. Grand Tutor (taifu \u592a\u5085) Wu She \u4f0d\u5962 and Junior Tutor (shaofu \u5c11\u5085) Fei Wuji \u8cbb\u7121\u5fcc intrigued against each other and instigated in the king the fear that the crown prince might prematurely usurp the throne. Prince Jian thereupon fled to the court of Song. Wu She's son Wu Zixu \u4f0d\u5b50\u80e5, who was an excellent strategist, was able to escape to the state of Wu, the arch-enemy of Chu.\n\nThe mother of Prince Jian was captured by the army of Wu when Prince Guang \u5149 of Wu was campaigning against Chen and Cai. A small border clash in Beiliang \u5351\u6881 lead to an armed conflict between Chu and Wu, in which Wu conquered the territories of Zhongli \u9418\u96e2 and Juchao \u5c45\u5de2. King Ping was so threatened that he began fortifying the capital city Ying. When King Ping died, the nobles wanted to enthrone his younger brother Prince Zixi \u5b50\u897f, but he refused, so that the under-age prince Zhen was enthroned as ruler of Chu. He is posthumously known as King Zhao \u695a\u662d\u738b (r. 516-489).\n\nAt the beginning of his reign, Prime Minister Zichang \u5b50\u5e38 took revenge for Prince Jian and Wu She and killed the intriguer Fei Wuji. The reason for this was that a many nobles had fled to Wu, where they supported the troops of Chu against the own dynasty in Chu. Yet there were also some princes of Wu escaping trouble in the own country at the court of Chu.\n\nIn 509 BCE the army of Chu, commanded by Prince Zichang, was heavily defeated by Wu in the battle of Baiju \u67cf\u8209 (modern Macheng \u9ebb\u57ce, Hubei). Wu Zixu as one of the competent military leaders of Wu even managed to conquer the capital of Chu in 506. As a revenge for the execution of his father, Wu Zixu had the tomb of King Ping desecrated. Commander Prince Zichang fled to the state of Zheng. King Zhao himself escaped to Yunmeng \u96f2\u5922 and then on to the former state of Sui, where he was hidden by his loyal courtiers and the population from the army of Wu.\n\nIn the meantime, minister Shen Baoxu \u7533\u9b91\u80e5 was sent to the state of Qin to ask for relief troops, which were indeed able to defeat the troops of Wu that had advanced far into the country of the enemy until they reached Ji \u7a37 (modern Tongbai \u6850\u67cf, Henan). Prince Fugai \u592b\u6982, brother of the king of Wu, usurped the throne on this occasion but was driven out by the righteous king and fled to the court of Chu.\n\nStill on his way back to the capital, King Zhao of Chu swallowed the state of Tang \u5510 (near modern Suizhou, Hubei), then Dun \u9813 (modern Shangshui \u5546\u6c34, Henan) and Hu \u80e1 (modern Fuyang \u961c\u967d, Anhui). There was another occasion in 504 when the army of Wu again invaded the state of Chu. Only with the death of King Hel\u00fc \u95d4\u95ad of Wu (r. 514-496) the attention of Wu was directed against the state of Yue, and the danger from the east was gone.\n\nOn his sickbed, King Zhao wanted to cede the throne to his younger brother, yet all nobles refused, before Prince Zil\u00fc \u5b50\u95ad conceded to become the successor of his brother. Yet when the King died on a campaign, the brothers decided to enthrone the king's son, Prince Zhang \u7ae0. He is posthumously known as King Hui \u695a\u60e0\u738b (r. 489-432). In 488 Prince Zixi invited the former Prince Jian's son Prince Sheng \u52dd to come back to Chu. He was granted the title of Duke Bai \u767d\u516c. Duke Bai planned to revenge his father's death, who had been killed in exile in Zheng.\n\nIn 481 BCE, the army of Jin attacked Zheng, and Zheng asked Chu for help. Instead of annihilating Zheng, commander Zixi left Zheng untouched. Duke Bai thereupon killed Zixi, Prince Ziqi \u5b50\u7da6 and Prime Minister Sima Ziqi \u53f8\u99ac\u5b50\u671f at the court and tried to kidnap King Hui. Yet the king was protected by his retainers and took refuge in the palace of the Queen Dowager of King Zhao.\n\nDuke Bai thereupon proclaimed himself king, but was assassinated by Prince Zigao \u5b50\u9ad8, called Duke Ye \u8449\u516c. In this year, Chu finally destroyed the state of Chen, in 447 the state of Cai, and in 445 the state of Qi \u675e.\n\nIn 473, the armies of Yue had finally destroyed the state of Wu. In the northern parts of Wu, along the plain of the River Huai \u6dee, Chu began to expand its territory. King Hui was succeeded by his son Prince Zhong \u4e2d, who is posthumously known was King Jian \u695a\u7c21\u738b (r. 432-408). Under his reign, Chu conquered the statelet of Ju \u8392 (modern Juxian \u8392\u7e23, Shandong) that had belonged to the territory of Qi. King Jian employed the famous military advisor Wu Qi \u5433\u8d77, who reformed the army, so that Chu was able to conquer the southern regions inhabited by the non-Chinese peoples of the Yangyue \u63da\u7cb5, namely the Dongting \u6d1e\u5ead (Hunan) and Cangwu \u84bc\u68a7 (Guizhou) regions.\n\nKing Jian was succeeded by his son Prince Dang \u7576, posthumously known as King Sheng \u695a\u8072\u738b (r. 408-402). King Sheng was killed by \"robbers\" (presumably nobles or family members) and was succeeded by his son Prince Yi \u7591, posthumously known as King Dao \u695a\u60bc\u738b (r. 402-381). Under his reign, Chu contended with the troops of the new states of Han \u97d3, Zhao \u8d99 and Wei \u9b4f, the successor states of Jin. King Dao was succeeded by his son Prince Zang \u81e7, posthumously known as King Su \u695a\u8085\u738b (r. 381-370). Because King Su had no sons, he left the throne to his younger brother Prince Liangfu \u826f\u592b, who is posthumously known as King Xuan \u695a\u5ba3\u738b (r. 370-340). At the end of the latter's reign, the armies of Qin attacked Chu. At that time, Qin was governed by counsellor Shang Yang \u5546\u9785.\n\nKing Xuan's son Prince Shang \u5546 succeeded to the throne in Chu, posthumously known as King Wei \u695a\u5a01\u738b (r. 340-329). He was able to defeat the armies of the state of Qi, which was at that time disturbed by inner quarrels. King Wei also defeated the armies of the kingdom of Yue and occupied a large part of its territory, so that Chu was now the sole state in the southern parts of China. In 306, Yue was destroyed by Chu.\n\nChu as a large but weak state between Qin and Qi\n\nWhen King Wei died, the state of Wei used this opportunity and conquered part of its northern territory. King Wei's successor was his son Prince Guai \u69d0, posthumously known as King Huai \u695a\u61f7\u738b (r. 329-299). In 323 BCE he took revenge and attacked the territory of Wei, seizing eight counties. The next military target was the state of Qi, yet at that time the military adviser Chen Zhen \u9673\u8eeb dwelled at the court of Qi and was dispatched to the camp of counsellor Zhao Yang \u662d\u967d, highest commander of the army of Chu. Chen Zhen persuaded Zhao Yang with the parable of drawing feet to a snake that he would have no advantage in defeating the army of Qi, so that Zhao Yang withdrew. At least, Chu was able to conclude an alliance with the states of Qin, Wei and Qi that was initiated by the famous diplomatist Zhang Yi \u5f35\u5100.\n\nThis alliance became important in 318 BCE, when an alliance, concluded with the help of Su Qin \u8607\u79e6, attacked the state of Qin. King Huai took over the lead of the allies and penetrated into the Hangu Pass \u51fd\u8c37\u95dc, yet the allies withdrew without forcing Qin to battle.\n\nIn 313, things had changed and Chu was in alliance with Qi. The king of Qin decided to send Zhang Yi to Chu in order to persuade King Huai to change side again and, in the end, to isolate Chu. Chen Zhen was well aware of this and warned King Huai, but he refused to accept the warning. In the end, the enraged king of Qi concluded an alliance with Qin. King Huai, on his side, made ready the troops for a campaign against Qin. Again, Chen Zhen warned the king and suggested offering Qin a city to restore the former alliance. King Huai ignored the warning, and so the army of Qin destroyed that of Chu at Danyang \u4e39\u967d in 312, captured a huge humber of troops and officers, and occupied the region of Hanzhong \u6f22\u4e2d. At Lantian \u85cd\u7530, the armies battled a second time, and the fresh defeat of Chu instigated Han and Wei to seize some more territory from Chu.\n\nA year later, Qin suggested concluding peace and sent Zhang Yi to the court of Chu. King Huai immediately arrested Zhang Yi and planned to kill him, but Zhang established contact with Jin Shang \u9773\u5c1a, who explained to King Huai that Qin would attack Chu again. He also spoke with the King's favourite, Lady Zheng Xiu \u912d\u8896, and threatened her that the king of Qin would try to purchase peace by sending beautiful girls to King Huai. The Lady then managed the release of Zhang Yi, and peace was made with Qin. Shortly after, the Chu embassador to Qi returned, Qu Yuan \u5c48\u539f, and reproached the king for not having executed Zhang Yi.\n\nIn 310 BCE, the King Min of Qi \u9f4a\u6e63\u738b (r. 324-284) sent an envoy to the court of Chu and explained that, after the death of King Hui in Qin, the situation had changed thoroughly, and suggested to conclude a common alliance with Han, Wei, Zhao and Yan \u71d5 against Qin. Zhao Ju \u662d\u96ce convinced King Huai that it was better to be part of the alliance around Qi and to win back the territory once lost to Qin. Yet in 307, King Huai decided that he could also win territory by concluding a peaceful alliance with Qin. Two years later Qin, Han and Wei attacked Chu for its betrayal of the alliance. King Huai sent his crown prince as a hostage to Qin and requested military support against the three states.\n\nIn 304, the crown prince of Chu had a private quarrel with some nobles of Qin. When he accidentally killed one of them, he fled and returned to Chu. In order to take revenge for the murder, Qin attacked Chu, supported by troops of Qi, Han and Wei, and defeated Chu at Chuisha \u5782\u6c99. A year later, Qin undertook a second campaign against Chu and heavily defeated the army of Chu. King Huai thereupon sent his crown prince as a hostage to Qi, an ally of Qin, and requested peace.\n\nOnly after a further campaign and after King Zhao of Qin had sent an urgent letter, King Huai of Chu consented to a meeting with the king of Qin at the Wuguan Pass \u6b66\u95dc. Yet King Huai did not trust Qin and feared that he might be caught in a trap. Zhao Ju suggested not to meet the king of Qin, but the King's younger son urged him to go. In the end, King Huai was escorted to Xianyang \u54b8\u967d, the capital of Qin, and was threatened to cease territory before concluding an alliance. He refused and was arrested and detained.\n\nAt home, the situation was precarious. Both the king and the crown prince were held hostages in Qin, and Zhao Ju argued that it was against etiquette to enthrone a younger son as long as the ruler was living. This meant that there was no head of government as long as King Huai was in Qin. The court brooded over the issue and finally invited Prince Heng \u6a6b to come to the capital Ying. He was enthroned as king of Ch, posthumously known as King Qingxiang \u695a\u9803\u8944\u738b (r. 299-263).\n\nThe king of Qin thereupon continued his campaigning against Chu, defeated its army, and seized territory in the north. A year later, King Huai managed to escape, but because the roads to Chu were blocked by Qin, he fled to the state of Zhao, but fearing the anger of Qin, King Huiwen of Zhao \u8d99\u60e0\u6587\u738b (r. 299-266) refused to offer protection. King Huai was finally captured by the bloodhounds of Qin and brought back to Xianyang, where he died a year later. At least, his corpse was allowed to be transferred back to his native state, where he was buried with greatest honours.\n\nIn 293 BCE, general Bai Qi \u767d\u8d77 massacred the army of Han. Threatened by this cruel way of warfare, King Qingxiang agreed to conclude a marriage of peace with Qin. This new alliance led to a campaign in 284, carried out by Qin, Chu, Han, Wei, Zhao and Yan and targeted against the state of Qi in the east. Chu so regained the region of Huaibei \u6dee\u5317. In 281, King Qingxiang was persuaded to resume war against Qin, in order to gain more territory. He first concluded an alliance with Qin and Han and planned to use this opportunity to conquer some territory of the patriarchal kings of Zhou around Luoyang. King Nan of Zhou \u5468\u738b\u8d67 (r. 315-256) thereupon sent his relative, Duke Wu \u6b66\u516c, to Zhaozi \u662d\u5b50, the counsellor of Chu. Duke Wu explained to Zhaozi that the destruction of the house of Zhou meant a thorough dissolution of the world order and would bring only chaos to the state of Chu. King Qingxiang thereupon abandoned this plan.\n\nThe campaigns against Qin continued, but in 278 BCE, general Bai Qi advanced to the capital of Chu and defiled the tombs of the kings of Chu. The capital of Chu was moved to the ancient site of Chen (modern Huaiyang \u6dee\u967d, Henan) It was only in 276 that the army of Chu was able to recover some of its core territory. Chu was even able to supporte Han, Zhao and Wei in a campaign against Yan. This was only possible because of an armistice bargained with Qin, covered by the crown prince as a hostage dwelling in Qin.\n\nWhen King Qingxiang fell ill, his son Prince Xiong Yuan \u718a\u5143 (or Wan \u5b8c) managed to escape from Qin and was enthroned as the new king of Chu. He is posthumously known as King Kaolie \u695a\u8003\u70c8\u738b (r. 263-238). The new king immediately appointed his trusted Counsellor-to-the-Left (zuoxi \u5de6\u5f92), Lord Chunshen \u6625\u7533\u541b, as Prime Minister. Under the Lord's administration, the state of Chu was able to recover for a while. The capital was first shifted to Juyang \u5de8\u967d (modern Taihe \u592a\u548c, Anhui), later to to Shouchun \u58fd\u6625 (modern Shouxian \u58fd\u7e23, Anhui) further to the east. Lord Chunshen met with Lord Xinling \u4fe1\u9675\u541b of Wei and forged an alliance that was able to defeat Qin in 257. A year later, Chu conquered the state of Lu.\n\nKing Kaolie was succeeded by his son Prince Dao \u608d (or Yu \u715c), who is posthumously known as King You \u695a\u5e7d\u738b (r. 238-228). Li Yuan \u674e\u5712, a powerful noble, used this personal change to assassinate Lord Chunshen. King You was succeeded by his younger half-brother You \u7336 (or Hao \u90dd), who is posthumously known as King Ai \u695a\u54c0\u738b (r. 228). He only ruled for two months before he was overthrown and killed by his older half-brother Fuchu \u8ca0\u82bb (r. 228-223).\n\nThe rule of the last kings of Chu was overshadowed by a growing military success of the state of Qin that succeedingly conquered the states of Han, Zhao and Wei. In 224, the Qin general Wang Jian \u738b\u7fe6 defeated the army of Chu and killed general Xiang Yan \u9805\u71d5, a great uncle of Xiang Yu \u9805\u7fbd, the eventual hegemonial king (bawang \u9738\u738b) of West Chu \u897f\u695a. A year later, Wang Jian and Meng Wu \u8499\u6b66 seized the capital of Chu, captured King Fuchu and transformed the state of Chu into a commandery of the state of Qin.\n\nThe name of Chu was often used as a name for imperial princedoms, and was one of the Ten States (Shiguo \u5341\u570b) in the 10th century.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

His personal name was Xiong Huai \u718a\u69d0 and he was the son of King Wei \u695a\u5a01\u738b (r. 340-329).\n\nIn 318, the counsellor of the state of Wei \u9b4f, Gongsun Yan \u516c\u5b6b\u884d, suggested to create an alliance (meng \u76df) of five states (Han \u97d3, Wei, Zhao \u8d99, Chu and Yan \u71d5) against the state of Qin \u79e6, which by its continuing military campaigns threatened the state system of the Zhou dynasty \u5468 (11th. cent.-221 BC).\n\nThe alliance was concluded, and King Huai of Chu chosen as its leader, yet the allies were defeated by Qin. In 313 Qin wanted to disrupt a newly created alliance with the state of Qi \u9f4a and therefore sent out Zhang Yi \u5f35\u5100, who offered some territory to Chu. King Huai was so much pleased by this vain offer that he broke with the state of Qi. In the end, Qin refused to cede territory, and King Huai was therefore so enraged that he attacked Qin. He was defeated in the battle of Danyang \u4e39\u967d (located on the north banks of River Dan \u4e39\u6c34 in Henan) and retreated with 80,000 remaining troops.\n\nThe whole region of Hanzhong \u6f22\u4e2d (between today's Sichuan and Shaanxi) was lost and the generals Qu Xiong \u5c48\u5308 (Qu Gai \u5c48\u5304) and Feng Hou Chu \u9022\u4faf\u4e11 were captured by Qin. Moreover, the states of Han, Wei and Qi attacked Chu for its perfidy to break the alliance and defeated Chu in the battle of Chuisha \u5782\u6c99 (modern Biyang \u6ccc\u967d, Henan).\n\nIn 311, Qin offered King Huai of Chu to give him back half of the territory of Hanzhong, but instead of demanding back his territory, King Huai planned to take revenge on Zhang Yi. This clever diplomatist and counsellor of Qin bribed King Huai's officials Jin Shang \u9773\u5c1a and the king's favourite concubine Zheng Xiu \u912d\u8896, so that he was finally released.\n\nIn 299, King Zhaoxiang of Qin \u79e6\u662d\u8944\u738b (r. 307-251) lured King Huai into a trap masked as an official state meeting in Wuguan \u6b66\u95dc (near modern Danfeng \u4e39\u9cf3, Shaanxi) and arrested the ruler of Chu. The country of Chu was now without a head, and therefore Prince Heng \u6a6b was enthroned as the new king (King Qingxiang \u695a\u9803\u8944\u738b, r. 299-263), although King Huai was still living. King Huai tried to escape to Zhao, but the king of Zhao refused to provide him asylum. King Huai died in Qin. His posthumous title Huai means \"the missed king\".\n\n\n\nA grandson of King Huai, Prince Xiong Xin \u718a\u5fc3, was the last ruler of Chu before it was conquered by Qin. When rebellions broke out against the Qin dynasty, the rebel leader, general Xiang Liang \u9805\u6881, a former general of Chu, enthroned Xiong Xin as ruler of Chu. His posthumous title is likewise King Huai of Chu \u695a\u61f7\u738b (r. 209-205 BCE). He was killed by the warlord Ying Bu \u82f1\u5e03.\n\nSources:\n\nChen Quanli \u9673\u5168\u529b, Hou Xinyi \u4faf\u6b23\u4e00, ed. (1988).

It contains some 8,000 life-sized terra-cotta soldiers and horse figures that formed an army to defend Shihuangdi\u2019s tomb.\n\nShihuangdi was emperor of the Qin dynasty (221\u2013210 BCE) and the creator of the first unified Chinese empire. He is also known for his interest in immortality, his huge funerary compound that contains some 8,000 life-sized terra-cotta soldiers, and for his contribution to the Great Wall of China .\n\nQin Shi Huang , also called Shihuangdi , Wade-Giles romanization Shih-huang-ti , personal name (xingming) Zhao Zheng or Ying Zheng , (born c. 259 bce, Qin state, northwestern China\u2014died 210 bce, Hebei), emperor (reigned 221\u2013210 bce) of the Qin dynasty (221\u2013207 bce) and creator of the first unified Chinese empire (which collapsed, however, less than four years after his death).\n\nUntil Zheng was officially declared of age in 238, his government was headed by L\u00fc Buwei. Zheng\u2019s first act as king was to execute his mother\u2019s lover, who had joined the opposition, and to exile L\u00fc, who had been involved in the affair. A decree ordering the expulsion of all aliens, which would have deprived the king of his most competent advisers, was annulled at the urging of Li Si , later grand councillor. By 221, with the help of espionage, extensive bribery, and the ruthlessly effective leadership of gifted generals, Zheng had eliminated one by one the remaining six rival states that constituted China at that time, and the annexation of the last enemy state, Qi , in 221 marked his final triumph: for the first time China was united, under the supreme rule of the Qin.\n\nWhen Zheng, at age 13, formally ascended the throne in 246 bce, Qin already was the most powerful state and was likely to unite the rest of China under its rule. The central states had considered Qin to be a barbarous country , but by that time its strong position on the mountainous western periphery (with its centre in the modern province of Shaanxi) enabled Qin to develop a strong bureaucratic government and military organization as the basis of the totalitarian state philosophy known as legalism .\n\nZhao Zheng was born the son of Zhuangxiang (who later became king of the state of Qin in northwestern China) while his father was held hostage in the state of Zhao. His mother was a former concubine of a rich merchant, L\u00fc Buwei , who, guided by financial interests, managed to install Zhuangxiang on the throne, even though he had not originally been designated as successor. The tradition, once widely accepted, that Zheng was actually L\u00fc Buwei\u2019s natural son is probably a slanderous invention.\n\nEmperor of China\n\nTo herald his achievement, Zheng assumed the sacred titles of legendary rulers and proclaimed himself Qin Shi Huang (\u201cFirst Sovereign Emperor\u201d). With unbounded confidence, he claimed that his dynasty would last \u201c10,000 generations.\u201d\n\nAs emperor he initiated a series of reforms aimed at establishing a fully centralized administration, thus avoiding the rise of independent satrapies. Following the example of Qin and at the suggestion of Li Si, he abolished territorial feudal power in the empire, forced the wealthy aristocratic families to live in the capital, Xianyang, and divided the country into 36 military districts, each with its own military and civil administrator. He also issued orders for almost universal standardization\u2014from weights, measures, and the axle lengths of carts to the written language and the laws. Construction of a network of roads and canals was begun, and fortresses erected for defense against barbarian invasions from the north were linked to form the Great Wall.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

While supervising the consolidation and organization of the empire, he did not neglect to perform sacrifices in various sacred places, announcing to the gods that he had finally united the empire, and he erected stone tablets with ritual inscriptions to extol his achievements.\n\nAnother motive for Qin Shi Huang\u2019s travels was his interest in magic and alchemy and his search for masters in these arts who could provide him with the elixir of immortality. After the failure of such an expedition to the islands in the Eastern Sea\u2014possibly Japan\u2014in 219, the emperor repeatedly summoned magicians to his court. Confucian scholars strongly condemned the step as charlatanry, and it is said that 460 of them were executed for their opposition. The continuous controversy between the emperor and Confucian scholars who advocated a return to the old feudal order culminated in the famous burning of the books of 213, when, at Li Si\u2019s suggestion, all books not dealing with agriculture, medicine, or prognostication were burned, except historical records of Qin and books in the imperial library.\n\nThe last years of Qin Shi Huang\u2019s life were dominated by an ever-growing distrust of his entourage\u2014at least three assassination attempts nearly succeeded\u2014and his increasing isolation from the common people. Almost inaccessible in his huge palaces, the emperor led the life of a semidivine being. In 210 Qin Shi Huang died during an inspection tour. He was buried in a gigantic funerary compound hewn out of a mountain and shaped in conformity with the symbolic patterns of the cosmos. (Excavation of this enormous complex of some 20 square miles [50 square km]\u2014now known as the Qin tomb\u2014began in 1974, and the complex was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987. Among the findings at the site were some 8,000 life-sized terra-cotta soldier and horse figures forming an \u201carmy\u201d for the dead king.) The disappearance of Qin Shi Huang\u2019s forceful personality immediately led to the outbreak of fighting among supporters of the old feudal factions that ended in the collapse of the Qin dynasty and the extermination of the entire imperial clan by 206.\n\nMost of the information about Qin Shi Huang\u2019s life derives from the successor Han dynasty, which prized Confucian scholarship and thus had an interest in disparaging the Qin period. The report that Qin Shi Huang was an illegitimate son of L\u00fc Buwei is possibly an invention of that epoch. Further, stories describing his excessive cruelty and the general defamation of his character must be viewed in the light of the distaste felt by the ultimately victorious Confucians for legalist philosophy in general.\n\nQin Shi Huang certainly had an imposing personality and showed an unbending will in pursuing his aim of uniting and strengthening the empire. His despotic rule and the draconian punishments he meted out were dictated largely by his belief in legalist ideas. With few exceptions, the traditional historiography of imperial China has regarded him as the villain par excellence, inhuman, uncultivated, and superstitious. Modern historians, however, generally stress the endurance of the bureaucratic and administrative structure institutionalized by Qin Shi Huang, which, despite its official denial, remained the basis of all subsequent dynasties in China."}, {"url": "http://www.china.org.cn/learning_chinese/idioms/2010-08/18/content_20737200.htm", "page_content": "During the Warring States Period (475-221 BC), the State of Chu became less powerful during the reign of King Xiang. The king and his important court officials were dissolute and incompetent and indulged themselves in luxury and excessive pleasure. Zhuang Xin, one of the ministers, foresaw that the country would soon be in danger. One day, he remonstrated with the king: \"Your Majesty, wherever you go, you're always surrounded by people who flatter you. They do everything to make you happy so that you forget to tend to state affairs. If you go on like this, sooner or later, the country will perish.\"\n\nThe King of Chu flew into a rage. \"How dare you! You even use such vicious words to curse my country and mean to arouse resentment among the people!\" Zhuang Xin explained, \"I dare not curse the State of Chu. But I really have a premonition that Chu is facing great danger.\" Seeing that the king was especially fond of those corrupt officials and trusted them in everything, the minister thought Chu was bound for extinction. So he asked the king to let him leave Chu. He wanted to go to the State of Zhao and stay there for a while.\n\nThe king gave him the leave. Five months later, the King of Qin sent his troops to invade Chu and occupied a large tract of its territory. The King of Chu himself went into exile. Now, the king remembered Zhuang Xin's words. He sent his men to fetch him. Seeing Zhuang Xin again, the king asked him, \"What can I do now?\"\n\nZhuang Xin replied, \"It's not too late if you mend the sheepfold when finding a sheep is missing.\" He then made some good suggestions to rehabilitate the state and recover the lost land. The king was very pleased.\n\nThe idiom \"Mend the fold after a sheep is lost\" comes from Zhuang Xin's answer to the king. We still use this metaphor to advise someone that even when he has made a mistake and suffered losses, he can still remedy it by drawing lessons from the mistake.\n\nw\u00e1ng y\u00e1ng b\u01d4 l\u00e1o\n\n\u4ea1\u7f8a\u8865\u7262\n\n\u6218\u56fd\u65f6\u671f\uff0c\u695a\u8944\u738b\u7edf\u6cbb\u695a\u56fd\u65f6\uff0c\u56fd\u52bf\u4e0d\u632f\u3002\u695a\u738b\u548c\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5927\u81e3\u90fd\u8352\u6deb\u65e0\u80fd\uff0c\u4e00\u76f4\u6c89\u6eba\u4e8e\u5962\u4f88\u4eab\u4e50\u4e4b\u4e2d\u3002\u5927\u81e3\u5e84\u8f9b\u9884\u89c1\u5230\u695a\u56fd\u4f1a\u53d1\u751f\u5371\u9669\u3002\u4e00\u5929\uff0c\u4ed6\u529d\u8c0f\u695a\u738b\u8bf4\uff1a\u201c\u965b\u4e0b\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u60a8\u8d70\u5230\u54ea\u513f\uff0c\u8eab\u65c1\u603b\u662f\u90a3\u4e9b\u5949\u627f\u60a8\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u60f3\u5c3d\u529e\u6cd5\u8ba9\u60a8\u9ad8\u5174\uff0c\u60a8\u5c31\u5fd8\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u56fd\u4e8b\u3002\u957f\u6b64\u4ee5\u5f80\uff0c\u56fd\u5bb6\u8fdf\u65e9\u4f1a\u706d\u4ea1\u7684\u3002\u201d\n\n\u695a\u738b\u5927\u6012\uff1a\u201c\u5927\u80c6\uff01\u4f60\u5c45\u7136\u7528\u8fd9\u6837\u6076\u6bd2\u7684\u8bdd\u6765\u8bc5\u5492\u6211\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\uff0c\u84c4\u610f\u6311\u8d77\u4eba\u6c11\u7684\u4e0d\u6ee1\uff01\u201d \u5e84\u8f9b\u89e3\u91ca\u8bf4\uff1a\u201c\u6211\u4e0d\u6562\u8bc5\u5492\u695a\u56fd\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u9884\u8a00\u695a\u56fd\u6b63\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u5371\u9669\u3002\u201d \u5e84\u8f9b\u89c1\u695a\u738b\u5982\u6b64\u5ba0\u4fe1\u90a3\u4e9b\u8150\u8d25\u7684\u5927\u81e3\uff0c\u76f8\u4fe1\u695a\u56fd\u5fc5\u5b9a\u8981\u4ea1\u56fd\u3002\u4e8e\u662f\u4ed6\u8bf7\u6c42\u695a\u738b\u8ba9\u4ed6\u79bb\u5f00\u695a\u56fd\uff0c\u5230\u8d75\u56fd\u5c45\u4f4f\u4e00\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\n\n\u695a\u738b\u540c\u610f\u4e86\uff0c\u4ed6\u4fbf\u53bb\u4e86\u8d75\u56fd\u3002\u4e94\u4e2a\u6708\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u79e6\u541b\u679c\u7136\u6d3e\u519b\u5165\u4fb5\u695a\u56fd\uff0c\u5360\u9886\u4e86\u5927\u7247\u571f\u5730\u3002\u695a\u738b\u88ab\u8feb\u6d41\u4ea1\u3002\u8fd9\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u60f3\u8d77\u4e86\u5e84\u8f9b\u7684\u529d\u8c0f\uff0c\u4e8e\u662f\u6d3e\u4eba\u63a5\u5e84\u8f9b\u56de\u6765\u3002\u695a\u738b\u89c1\u4e86\u5e84\u8f9b\uff0c\u4fbf\u95ee\uff1a\u201c\u73b0\u5728\u6211\u8be5\u600e\u4e48\u529e\u5462\uff1f\u201d\n\n\u5e84\u8f9b\u56de\u7b54\u8bf4\uff1a\u201c\u4e22\u4e86\u7f8a\uff0c\u5c31\u628a\u7f8a\u5708\u4fee\u597d\uff0c\u4e0d\u7b97\u8fdf\u3002\u201d\u7136\u540e\u4ed6\u63d0\u51fa\u8bb8\u591a\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u632f\u56fd\u5bb6\u3001\u6536\u590d\u5931\u5730\u7684\u597d\u8c0b\u7565\u3002\u695a\u738b\u975e\u5e38\u9ad8\u5174\u3002"}, {"url": "https://infogalactic.com/info/Chu_(state)", "page_content": "From Infogalactic: the planetary knowledge core\n\nThis article is about the state of Chu during the Zhou dynasty. For other states of the same name, see Chu\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found. Chu (Chinese: \u695a, Old Chinese: *s-r\u0325a\u0294 ) was a hegemonic, Zhou dynasty era state. Following the trend of the time, the rulers of Chu declared themselves kings on an equal footing with the Zhou rulers from the time of King Wu in the early 8th century BC. Though initially inconsequential, removed to the south of the Zhou heartland and practising differing customs, Chu began a series of administrative reforms, becoming a successful expansionist state during the Spring and Autumn period. It was ultimately incorporated into the prestigious Zhou court and interstate relations as a viscounty, a title bestowed in order to pacify it.[3] With its continued expansion Chu became a great if corrupt Warring States power, and its culture a major influence on the Han dynasty.\n\nAlso known as Jing (\u8346) and Jingchu (\u8346\u695a), Chu included most of the present-day provinces of Hubei and Hunan, along with parts of Chongqing, Guizhou, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. For more than 400 years, the Chu capital Danyang was located at the junction of the Dan and Xi Rivers[4][5] near present-day Xichuan County, Henan, but later moved to Ying. The ruling house of Chu originally bore the ancestral name Nai (\u5b2d) and clan name Yan (\u9153), but they are later written as Mi (\u8288) and Xiong (\u718a), respectively.[6]\n\nHistory\n\nFounding\n\nAccording to legends recounted in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian, the royal family of Chu descended from the Yellow Emperor and his grandson and successor Zhuanxu. Zhuanxu's great-grandson Wuhui (\u5433\u56de) was put in charge of fire by Emperor Ku and given the title Zhurong. Wuhui's son Luzhong (\u9678\u7d42) had six sons, all born by Caesarian section. The youngest, Jilian, adopted the ancestral surname Mi.[7] Jilian\u2019s descendant Yuxiong was the teacher of King Wen of Zhou (r. 1099\u20131050 BC). After the Zhou overthrew the Shang dynasty, King Cheng (r. 1042\u20131021 BC) awarded Yuxiong's great-grandson Xiong Yi with the fiefdom of Chu and the hereditary title of \u5b50 (z\u01d0, \"viscount\"). Xiong Yi built the first capital of Chu at Danyang (present-day Xichuan in Henan).[7]\n\nWestern Zhou\n\nIn 977 BC, during his campaign against Chu, King Zhao of Zhou's boat sank and he drowned in the Han River. After this death, Zhou ceased to expand to the south, allowing the southern tribes and Chu to cement their own autonomy much earlier than the states to the north. The Chu viscount Xiong Qu overthrew E[8] in 863 BC but subsequently made its capital Ezhou one of his capitals. In either 703[9] or 706,[10] the ruler Xiong Tong proclaimed himself king, establishing Chu's full independence from the Zhou monarchs.\n\nSpring and Autumn Period\n\nIn its early years, Chu was a successful expansionist and militaristic state that developed a reputation for coercing and absorbing its allies. Chu grew from a small state into a large kingdom. King Zhuang was even considered one of the five Hegemons of the era. After a number of battles with neighboring states, sometime between 695 and 689 BC, the Chu capital moved southeast from Danyang to Ying. Chu first consolidated its power by absorbing lesser states in its original area (modern Hubei), then it expanded into the north towards the North China Plain. The threat from Chu resulted in multiple northern alliances under the leadership of Jin. These alliances kept Chu in check, with the first major victory won at the Chengpu in 632 BC.\n\nAt the beginning of the sixth century BC, Jin strengthened the state of Wu near the Yangtze delta to act as a counterweight against Chu. Wu defeated Qi and then invaded Chu in 506 BC. Following the Battle of Boju, it occupied Chu's capital at Ying, forcing King Zhao to flee to his allies in Yun and \"Sui\". (The historian Shi Quan links this state to Zeng.[11]) King Zhao eventually returned to Ying but, after another attack from Wu in 504 BC, he temporarily moved the capital into the territory of the former state of Ruo. Chu began to strengthen Yue in modern Zhejiang to serve as allies against Wu. Yue was initially subjugated by King Fuchai of Wu until he released their king Guojian, who took revenge for his former captivity by crushing and completely annexing Wu.\n\nWarring States Period\n\nFreed from its difficulties with Wu, Chu annexed Chen in 479 BC and overran Cai to the north in 447 BC. This policy of expansion continued until the last generation before the fall to Qin (Lu was conquered by King Kaolie in 249 BC). However, by the end of the 5th century BC, the Chu government had become very corrupt and inefficient, with much of the state's treasury used primarily to pay for the royal entourage. Many officials had no meaningful task except taking money and Chu's army, while large, was of low quality.\n\nIn the late 390s BC, King Dao of Chu made Wu Qi his chancellor. Wu's reforms began to transform Chu into an efficient and powerful state in 389 BC, as he lowered the salaries of officials and removed useless ones. He also enacted building codes to make the capital Ying seem less barbaric. Despite Wu Qi's unpopularity among Chu's ruling class, his reforms strengthened the king and left the state very powerful until the late 4th century BC, when Zhao and Qin were ascendant. Chu's powerful army once again became successful, defeating the states of Wei and Yue. Yue was partitioned between Chu and Qi in either 334 or 333 BC.[12] However, the officials of Chu wasted no time in their revenge and Wu Qi was assassinated at King Dao's funeral in 381 BC. Prior to Wu's service in the state of Chu, Wu lived in the state of Wei, where his military analysis of the six opposing states was recorded in his magnum opus, The Book of Master Wu. Of Chu, he said:\n\nBronze from the Tomb of Chu in Xichuan\n\n<templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" />\n\nThe Chu people are not strong. Their lands stretch far and wide, and the government cannot effectively administer the expanse. Their troops are weary and although their formations are well-ordered, they do not have the resources to maintain their positions for long. To defeat them, we must strike swiftly, unexpectedly and retreat quickly before they can counter attack. This will create chaos in their formations and reduce their fighting spirit. If we strike repeatedly, it will wear them out. Thus, with persistence, their army can be defeated. Wuzi, Master Wu Chen Song translation\n\nDuring the late Warring States Period, Chu was increasingly pressured by Qin to its west, especially after Qin enacted and preserved the Legalistic reforms of Shang Yang. In 241 BC, five of the seven major warring states - Chu, Zhao, Wei, Yan and Han - formed an alliance to fight the rising power of Qin. King Kaolie of Chu was named the leader of the alliance and Lord Chunshen the military commander. According to historian Yang Kuan, the Zhao general Pang Nuan (\u5e9e\u7156) was the actual commander in the battle. The allies attacked Qin at the strategic Hangu Pass but were defeated. King Kaolie blamed Lord Chunshen for the loss and began to mistrust him. Afterwards, Chu moved its capital east to Shouchun, farther away from the threat of Qin.\n\nChu's size and power made it the key state in alliances against Qin. As Qin expanded into Chu territory, Chu was forced to expand southwards and eastwards, absorbing local cultural influences along the way. By the late 4th century BC, however, Chu's prominent status had fallen into decay. As a result of several invasions headed by Zhao and Qin, Chu was eventually subjugated by Qin.\n\nDefeat\n\nAccording to the Records of the Warring States, a debate between the Diplomat strategist Zhang Yi and the Qin general Sima Cuo led to two conclusions concerning the unification of China. Zhang Yi argued in favor of conquering Han and seizing the Mandate of Heaven from the powerless Zhou king would be wise. Sima Cuo, however, considered that the primary difficulty was not legitimacy but the strength of Qin's opponents; he argued that \"conquering Shu is conquering Chu\" and, \"once Chu is eliminated, the country will be united\".\n\nThe importance of Shu in the Sichuan Basin was its great agricultural output and its control over the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, leading directly into the Chu heartland. King Huiwen of Qin opted to support Sima Cuo. In 316 BC, Qin invaded and conquered Shu and nearby Ba, expanding downriver in the following decades. In 278 BC, the Qin general Bai Qi finally conquered Chu's capital at Ying. Following the fall of Ying, the Chu government moved to various locations in the east until settling in Shouchun in 241 BC. After a massive two-year struggle, Bai Qi lured the main Zhao force of 400,000 men onto the field, surrounding them and forcing their surrender at Changping in 260 BC. The Qin army massacred their prisoners, removing the last major obstacle to Qin dominance over the Chinese states.\n\nBy 225 BC, only four kingdoms remained: Qin, Chu, Yan, and Qi. Chu had recovered significantly enough to mount serious resistance. Despite its size, resources, and manpower, though, Chu's corrupt government worked against it. In 224 BC, Ying Zheng called for a meeting with his subjects to discuss his plans for the invasion of Chu. Wang Jian said that the invasion force needed to be at least 600,000 strong, while Li Xin thought that less than 200,000 men would be sufficient. Ying Zheng sided with Li and ordered him and Meng Wu to lead the army against Chu; Wang Jian was forced to retire from state affairs upon a pretense of illness.[citation needed]\n\nThe Qin armies scored initial victories as Li Xin's force conquered Pingyu (\u5e73\u8f3f, north of present-day Pingyu in Henan) and Meng Wu's captured Qinqiu (\u5be2\u4e18, present-day Linquan in Anhui). After conquering Yan (\u9122, present-day Yanling in Henan), Li Xin led his army west to rendezvous with Meng at Chengfu (\u57ce\u7236, east of present-day Baofeng in Henan). The Chu army, led by Xiang Yan, had avoided using its main force and waited for an opportunity to launch a counterattack. They secretly followed Li Xin's army for three days and three nights, before launching a surprise offensive and defeating the Qin army.[citation needed]\n\nUpon learning of Li's defeat, Ying Zheng visited the exiled Wang Jian in person and invited him back, putting Wang in command of the 600,000-strong army he had requested earlier and placing Meng Wu beneath him as a deputy. Worried that the Qin tyrant might fear the power he now possessed and order him executed upon some pretense, Wang Jian constantly sent messengers back to the king in order to remain in contact and reduce the king's suspicion.\n\nWang Jian's army passed through southern Chen (\u9673; present-day Huaiyang in Henan) and made camp at Pingyu. The Chu armies under Xiang Yan used their full strength against the camp but failed. Wang Jian ordered his troops to defend their positions firmly but avoid advancing further into Chu territory. After failing to lure the Qin army into an attack, Xiang Yan ordered a retreat; Wang Jian seized this opportunity to launch a swift assault. The Qin forces pursued the retreating Chu forces to Qinan (\u8572\u5357; northwest of present-day Qichun in Hubei) and Xiang Yan was either killed in the action or committed suicide following his defeat.[citation needed]\n\nThe next year, in 223 BC, Qin launched another campaign and captured the Chu capital Shouchun. King Fuchu was captured and his state annexed.[13] The following year, Wang Jian and Meng Wu led the Qin army against Wuyue around the mouth of the Yangtze, capturing the descendants of the royal family of Yue.[13] These conquered territories became the Kuaiji Prefecture of the Qin Empire.\n\nAt their peak, Chu and Qin together fielded over 1,000,000 troops, more than the massive Battle of Changping between Qin and Zhao 35 years before. The excavated personal letters of two regular Qin soldiers, Hei Fu (\u9ed1\u592b) and Jing (\u60ca), tell of a protracted campaign in Huaiyang under Wang Jian. Both soldiers wrote letters requesting supplies of clothing and money from home to sustain the long waiting campaign.[14]\n\nQin and Han Dynasties\n\nThe Chu realm at its most powerful was vast with many ethnicities and various customs. Though diverse, the Chu people were united by a common respect for nature, the supernatural, and their heritage and loyalty to their ruling house and nobility, epitomized by the famed Chu statesman-poet Qu Yuan and the Songs of Chu. The Chu populace in areas conquered by Qin openly ignored the stringent Qin laws and governance, as recorded in the excavated bamboo slips of a Qin administrator in Hubei. Chu was one of the last states to fall and its people aspired to overthrowing the painful yoke of Qin rule and reestablishing a separate state. The attitude was immortalized in a Chinese expression about implacable hostility: \"Though Chu have but three clans,[15] it must kill Qin\" (\u695a\u96d6\u4e09\u6236, \u4ea1\u79e6\u5fc5\u695a).[16]\n\nAfter Ying Zheng declared himself the First Emperor (Shi Huangdi) and served his short reign, the people of Chu and its former ruling house organized the first violent insurrections against the new Qin administration. They were especially resentful of the Qin corvee; folk poems record the mournful sadness of Chu families whose men worked in the frigid north to construct the Great Wall of China.\n\nThe Dazexiang Uprising occurred in 209 BC under the leadership of a Chu peasant, Chen Sheng, who proclaimed himself \"King of Rising Chu\" (Zhangchu). This uprising was crushed by the Qin army but it inspired a new wave of other rebellions. One of the leaders, Jing Ju of Chu, proclaimed himself the new king of Chu. Jing Ju was defeated by another rebel force under Xiang Liang. Xiang installed Xiong Xin, a scion of Chu's traditional royal family, on the throne of Chu under the regnal name King Huai II. In 206 BC, after the fall of the Qin Empire, Xiang Yu, Xiang Liang's nephew, proclaimed himself the \"Hegemon-King of Western Chu\" and promoted King Huai II to \"Emperor Yi\". He subsequently had Yi assassinated. Xiang Yu then engaged with Liu Bang, another prominent Chu rebel, in a long struggle for supremacy over the lands of the former Qin Empire, which became known as the Chu-Han Contention. The conflict ended in victory for Liu Bang: he proclaimed the Han Dynasty and was later honored with the temple name Gaozu, while Xiang Yu committed suicide in defeat.\n\nThe Chu people and customs were major influences on the new era of the Han. Liu Bang immediately enacted a more traditional and less intrusive administration than the Qin before him, made peace with the Xiongnu through heqin intermarriages, rewarded his allies with large fiefdoms, and allowed the population to rest from centuries of warfare. By the time of Emperor Wu of Han, Chu folk culture and aesthetics were amalgamated with the Han-sponsored Confucian tradition and Qin-influenced central governance to create a distinct \"Chinese\" culture.\n\nCulture\n\nTomb guardian.\n\nBased on the archaeological finds, Chu's culture was initially quite similar to that of the other Zhou states of the Yellow River basin. Subsequently, however, Chu absorbed indigenous elements from the Baiyue lands the state conquered to its south and east, developing a distinct culture from the states of the northern plains.\n\nEarly Chu burial offerings consisted primarily of bronze vessels in the Zhou style. Later Chu burials, especially during the Warring States, featured distinct burial objects, such as colorful lacquerware, iron, and silk, accompanied by a reduction in bronze vessel offerings.\n\nA common Chu motif was the vivid depiction of wildlife, mystical animals, and natural imagery, such as snakes, dragons, phoenixes, tigers, and free-flowing clouds and serpent-like beings. Some archaeologists speculate that Chu may have had cultural connections to the vanished Shang dynasty, since many motifs used by Chu appeared earlier at Shang sites such as serpent-tailed gods.\n\nLater Chu culture was known for its affinity for shamans. The Chu culture and government strongly supported Taoism and native shamanism supplemented with some Confucian glosses on Zhou ritual. The naturalistic and flowing art, the Songs of Chu, historical records, excavated bamboo documents such as the Guodian slips, and other artifacts reveal heavy Taoist and native folk influence in Chu culture. The disposition to a spiritual, often pleasurable and decadent lifestyle, and the confidence in the size of the Chu realm led to the inefficiency and eventual destruction of the Chu state by the ruthless Legalist state of Qin. Even though the Qin realm lacked the vast natural resources and waterways of Chu, the Qin government maximized its output under the efficient minister Shang Yang, installing a meritocracy focused solely on agricultural and military might.\n\nChu was known for its distinct music. Archaeological evidence shows that Chu music was annotated differently from Zhou. Chu music also showed an inclination for using different performance ensembles, as well as unique instruments. In Chu, the se was preferred over the zither, while both instruments were equally preferred in the northern Zhou states.\n\nChu came into frequent contact with other peoples in the south, most notably the Ba, Yue, and the Baiyue. Numerous burials and burial objects in the Ba and Yue styles have been discovered throughout the territory of Chu, co-existing with Chu-style burials and burial objects.\n\nThe early rulers of the Han Dynasty romanticized the culture of Chu, sparking a renewed interest in Chu cultural elements such as the Songs of Chu. Evidence of heavy Chu cultural influence appears at Mawangdui. After the Han dynasty, some Confucian scholars considered Chu culture with distaste, criticizing the \"lewd\" music and shamanistic rituals associated with Chu culture.\n\nChu artisanship shows a mastery of form and color, especially the lacquer woodworks. Red and black pigmented lacquer were most used. Silk-weaving also attained a high level of craftsmanship, creating lightweight robes with flowing designs. These examples (as at Mawangdui) were preserved in waterlogged tombs where the lacquer did not peel off over time and in tombs sealed with coal or white clay.\n\nChu used the complex calligraphic script called \"Birds and Worms\" style, which was borrowed by the Wu and Yue states. It has an intricate design that embellishes the characters with motifs of animals, snakes, birds, and insects. This is another representation of the Chu reverence of the natural world and its liveliness. Chu produced broad bronze swords that were similar to Wuyue swords but not as intricate.\n\nChu was in the region of many rivers, so it created an efficient riverine transport system of boats augmented by wagons. These are detailed in bronze tallies with gold inlay regarding trade along the river systems connecting with those of the Chu capital at Ying.\n\nList of states annexed by Chu\n\n863 BC E\n\n704 BC Quan\n\n688-680 BC Shen\n\n684-680 BC Xi\n\n678 BC Deng\n\nafter 643 BC Dao\n\n623 BC Jiang\n\n622 BC Liao\n\nafter 622 BC Ruo\n\n611 BC Yong\n\nafter 506 BC Sui\n\n512 BC Xu\n\n479 BC Chen\n\n445 BC Qi\n\n447 BC Cai\n\n431 BC Ju\n\nafter 418 BC Pi\n\nAbout 348 BC Zuo\n\n334 BC Yue\n\n249 BC Lu\n\nRulers\n\nViscounts\n\nKings\n\nPretenders\n\nChen Sheng (\u9673\u52dd) as King Yin of Chu (\u695a\u96a0\u738b) ruled 210\u2013209 BC\n\nJing Ju (\u666f\u99d2) as King Jia of Chu \u695a\u5047\u738b (Jia for fake) ruled 209\u2013208 BC\n\nXiong Xin (\u718a\u5fc3) as Emperor Yi of Chu (\u695a\u7fa9\u5e1d) (originally King Huai II \u695a\u5f8c\u61f7\u738b) ruled 208\u2013206 BC: grandson or great-grandson of King Huai\n\nXiang Yu (\u9879\u7fbd) as Hegemon-King of Western Chu (\u897f\u695a\u9738\u738b) ruled 206\u2013202 BC\n\nFamous people\n\nChu in astronomy\n\nIn traditional Chinese astronomy, Chu is represented by a star in the \"Twelve States\" asterism, part of the \"Girl\" lunar mansion in the \"Black Turtle\" symbol.
