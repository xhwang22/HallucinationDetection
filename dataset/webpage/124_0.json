In 1913 he became commander of the artillery of the Fourth Division (Woolwich), and led this unit in France in August 1914 during the battles of Le Cateau, the Marne, and the Aisne. When Sir John French transferred the British Expeditionary Force to Flanders in October, Milne was promoted brigadier general; the next year promotion to major general on the General Staff of the Second Army followed. Milne's career shifted radically when he was given command of the Twenty-seventh Division and ordered to Salonika: he was chosen for this post primarily because it was believed that he was sufficiently strong of character to resist the blandishments of the French General Maurice Sarrail, the overall Allied field commander in Greece. In January 1916, Milne was entrusted with command of the XVI Corps, and later that year with all British forces at Salonika under General Sarrail, and then those under General Franchet d'Esperey. The story of the British at Salonika is one of frustration: Milne possessed insufficient troops, his units suffered from disease, and they labored under the difficulty of the terrain. The chief of the Imperial General Staff, Sir William Robertson, opted for a cautious stance in Greece against the Bulgars. It was not until April 24, 1917, that Milne was finally ordered to go on the attack near Lake Dorain, and he was repulsed with heavy losses. French and Serbian forces were finally able to advance against Bulgaria in 1918 and, after the collapse of the Sofia government, Milne advanced to the Turkish frontier, eventually occupying Constantinople after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. Milne remained at the Porte until November 1920, being promoted general that same year. Two years later he was given the Eastern Command at home, and in 1926 was appointed chief of the Imperial General Staff. He was promoted field marshal in 1928 and five years later retired as Baron Milne, of Salonika and Rubislaw, county of Aberdeen. Milne spent the Second World War enrolled in the Home Guard, and died in London on March 23, 1948. He was known for his keen wit, immense energy, and penetrating intellect."}, {"url": "https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/george-milne-24-cfrcpn", "page_content": "This database contains family trees submitted to Ancestry by users who have indicated that their tree can be viewed by all Ancestry subscribers.These trees can change over time as users edit, remove, or otherwise modify the data in their trees.

His parents were James and Zipporah (n\u00e9e Green) Milne. He attended Scotch from 1908 to 1910.\n\nGeorge was an accountant when he enlisted on 27 March 1915 in Melbourne, Victoria. He served in the 24th Battalion and 46th Battalion with the rank of Captain. His Regimental Number was 795.\n\nGeorge died on 5 April 1918 at Albert, France. He was 25 years of age.\n\nService record\n\nGeorge Milne was just 5 feet 4 \u00be inches (164 cm) tall on enlistment. He weighed 8 stone 10 pounds (55 kg). He was allotted to the 24th Battalion at Broadmeadows in April 1915. By May he was a Sergeant, and he was made Company Sergeant Major in August. On 30 August he went with his battalion to Gallipoli.\n\nA letter that he wrote home from Lone Pine on 18 December 1915 was reproduced in The Scotch Collegian in 1916. He wrote that he hoped to be leaving Gallipoli with a small group the following night. \u2018When I think of the graves which line the beach,\u2019 he wrote, \u2018it is very hard to have to leave them.\u2019 'There may be history, marvellous history,\u2019 he enthused, 'created between this minute and to-morrow night that I cannot foretell- but war is a peculiar thing. Just fancy \u2013 we are attempting to walk off the Peninsula, and not let our friends, the enemy, know anything about it.\u2019 The following night, while still there, he wrote: \u201915 Minutes to Midnight. \u2013 Another party has just got away. Only 15 men, a Sergeant-Major and 2 officers are holding No. 1 section of the Lone Pine. Quietness, intense quietness, prevails, except for the snapping of rifles and the distant booming of our warships firing on Cape Helles.\u2019\n\nAs usual among Australians, some found humour in tension: \u2018We had great jokes this afternoon. Each man, as he walked the trench, had his identification disc in his eye to act as an eyeglass, at the same time pulling on imaginary gloves. Childish, isn\u2019t it?- but what else would you do after fifteen weeks in these God-forsaken lines of communication?\u2019 Then the darker side of war: \u2018It is getting close on to my time for slipping away, and past the dark tunnel where my little pal (my assistant) lies [this was probably Private Henry Robery]. What can I tell his people if I return?\u2019 He talked about throwing a few grenades and then going. Later in the war, he recalled of that night: \u2019I was wearing strips of blanket round my boots to prevent a noise while walking along the tunnelled front line. How quiet everything was, and what strange thoughts I had! What a relief when I found that we were safely on a barge, moving towards the transport dimly outlined in the dawning light.\u2019\n\nHe made it out safely, and was back in Egypt in January 1916. In March George was taken on strength of the 46th Battalion, where he was to be a 2nd Lieutenant. He joined the 12th Brigade Headquarters with that rank on 17 March and sailed to Marseille, France, in June 1916. In another of his letters published in the Collegian he mentioned catching \u2018our first glimpse of the beautiful sunny south of France.\u2019 \u2018The glorious green brightness of this country amazes us\u2019, he continued. He expressed pride at entering France, \u2018proud to be able to help these industrious and friendly people. Each station we stop at [on the train journey from Marseille], girls and kiddies rush the platform, throwing flowers and kisses, and wishing us \u201cbon voyage.\u201d All these people, mostly dressed in crepe [denoting mourning], know and understand what war means.\u2019 When they passed through Calais, on the north coast, George reflected that \u2018we were only 20 miles from dear old England.\u2019\n\nHe was with the 12th Light Trench Mortar Battery from July until December 1916. On 3 August he wrote home from near Albert, where, \u2018being tight on top of a hill, we can overlook the fighting going on. You will never know what a bombardment is like. The row is something awful, and last night the sky was livid with the flashes of guns and the explosions of the shells. Shells were raining from both sides, simply pouring in like the biggest thunderstorm, only hundreds of times heavier.\u2019 He mused that \u2018A man simply cannot go into this without getting a crack of some sort or other.\u2019 He said he would have liked to have said how many big guns were firing from behind him, but the number was too great, running into four figures. All the previous night they had been firing. \u2018Thousand and thousands of shells, large and small, ripping, tearing, shrieking on their way to destruction. This is War. What are the nations coming to?\u2019 he asked. He reflected \u2018I feel as though I am not a man, but something below the rank of the lowest beast; but for all the awfulness of the thing, one revels in it.\u2019 The reason: \u2018The more shells we pitch over, the more Germans are killed, and this is what we are after, is it not?\u2019\n\nOn 21 August 1916 he became a full Lieutenant. He was admitted to hospital with a sprained shoulder in early December 1916. He also suffered from other ailments (see below). He rejoined the 46th Battalion in June 1917. In October 1917 he became a Temporary Captain and on Boxing Day 1917 was promoted to full Captain. That winter was very cold: \u2018The nights are simply one long freeze\u2019, he wrote, \u2018and the wind is well in keeping.\u2019\n\nHe was angry at the unwillingness of eligible Australian men to enlist. He said it made the soldiers \u2018ashamed of our native land, and it is only our wonderful fighting name which makes us and keeps us proud of Australia.\u2019 As 1918 dawned he wrote: \u2018I hope 1918 will prove a more peaceful year than the 3 hitherto. This is my third Xmas away from home; the first I spent at Lemnos, the second in Etaples in hospital, the third in the forward area in France. The next I\u2019m looking forward to spending at Portsea, or some other quiet seaport spot in Victoria.\u2019\n\nIt was not to be. In January 1918 he had 18 days\u2019 leave in the United Kingdom. He received a gunshot wound to the head, which proved mortal on 5 April 1918. His Red Cross Wounded and Missing file contains conflicting accounts of George\u2019s death, but a sergeant who was with him when he was wounded gives a plausible account of him being mortally wounded by a shell (see below). In the course of this action George earned a Military Cross. The citation said the award was \u2018for conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty\u2019, and explained that \u2018When a heavy barrage fell on the sector held by this officer\u2019s company, anticipating an attack, he visited each part of the line, seeing that all were prepared. On the attack taking place, calling on his men to follow him, he led them straight for the enemy, whom he successfully repulsed.\u2019 (see below).\n\nHis service file contains a letter from George\u2019s father expressing thanks for news of his son\u2019s Military Cross, even though the medal \u2018arrived too late for the boy to wear.\u2019 (see below). Strangely, a Roll of Honour circular was not completed for George, and no inscription seems to have been ordered for his headstone. George\u2019s obituary in The Scotch Collegian contained a message sent from General Birdwood, commander of the I Anzac Corps, congratulating him on his MC and saying \u2018Thank you so much for your fine conduct, and with good wishes.\u2019 Unfortunately, George had not lived to read the message.\n\nThe same obituary quoted Major Couchman, second-in-command of the 46th Battalion, who said \u2018George was a real pal; he was a platoon commander under me\u2026and later in complete command of \u2018C\u2019 Company. There was not a more popular officer among all ranks than George Milne.\u2019 He described the \u2018coolness\u2019 with which George behaved in winning his Military Cross. \u2018When the Hun attacked,\u2019 Couchman continued, \u2018George, with a towel round his neck and no puttees (leg coverings) on, led his company at the Germans, completely repulsed the attack, inflicted severe casualties, and captured prisoners.\u2019 He told of another incident, at Albert, where Milne \u2018jumped up on the railway embankment, and led his men at the Germans. The N.C.O\u2019s of his company sent in a written statement, signed by all, requesting that their O.C. [officer commanding], Capt. Milne, be recommended for some decoration for the brave and able manner in which he led them.\u2019 Lieutenant Colonel Ford, Commanding Officer of the 46th, wrote that George \u2018was a general favourite with all ranks, and showed much promise as an officer\u2019. Several good officers of the 46th died on 5 April, Ford remarked, \u2018but none better than Capt. G.E. Milne\u2019.\n\nGeorge Milne is buried in the Gesaincourt Communal Cemetery Extension (Plot II, Row J, Grave No. 20), France.\n\nPhotographs and Documents:\n\nMedical case sheet\n\nGeorge Milne is third from the left in the front row in this March 1918 photograph of 46th Battalion officers in Meteren, France (AWM E01794)\n\nFrom George Milne\u2019s Honours and Awards file\n\nReport of death.\n\nLetter about award of Military Cross\n\nSources:"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/george.milne/2303421", "page_content": "George Milne\n\npolitician\n\nApril 19, 1850 (age 82) British Columbia\n\nHe represented Victoria City in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 1890 to 1898.

Before you begin to search, it is helpful to have the name of the person for whom you are searching, the approximate date of death, and where in the UK that person died. Once you have that information, there are several ways for you to track the death record.\n\nAdvertising Disclosure\n\nIf you are searching for a death that occurred in England or Wales before July 1837, no central record was kept. Your best bet is to start with the local parish records of where the deceased is buried if you know. After 1837, information began to be collected on a national basis. As such, your search may prove a great deal easier.\n\nTwo sets of Death Certificate indexes exist in the UK. The original is held by the local register office where the death occurred. If you know exactly where the death you are researching took place, it may be much easier to start with the local office as they will have far fewer certificates to search through.\n\nThe second set of death certificates, for England and Wales, are kept at the General Register Office (GRO). Each certificate is assigned an Index Reference Number (IRN). Keeping in mind that the GRO has tens of millions of death certificates, knowing the IRN will make your search considerably easier and faster. If you need to find the IRN, many of the deaths between 1837 and the early 1960s have been transcribed and are available online. You can also find full sets of the IRN on microfiche at the larger libraries.\n\nSearching for a death certificate in Scotland or Northern Ireland is slightly different. While it is still helpful to have the name and approximate date of death, rather than the location of the death you should try to discover the person\u2019s religious denomination. The GRO for Northern Ireland only has death certificates since 1864; the GRO for Scotland since 1855. Again, it may prove easier to search the local parish records if you have a sense of where the death occurred.\n\nOrdering a death certificate can be sped up by applying in person. In Northern Ireland, the address is Oxford House, 49 \u2013 55 Chichester Street, Belfast. In Scotland, head over to New Register House, 3 West Register Street, Edinburgh.\n\nEngland Death Records\n\nEngland\u2019s death records contain various beneficial information. This includes the decedent\u2019s date and place of death. Also, you can find the person\u2019s full name, sex, age, cause of death, and occupation. Interestingly, if the decedent is a child, then you can find the name of the child\u2019s parent, but, for adults, the parent\u2019s name is not listed. You can uncover details about the informant of the death as well. These consist of the informant\u2019s name, residence, and relationship to the deceased. Supposing that the informant was a family member, then the records may help guide you in outlining a family tree. Lastly, you can find the date of registration of the death and the registrar\u2019s name.\n\nAn online search of the General Register Office (GRO) on the other hand, can help you find death records between 1837 to 1957 and 1984 to 2019 for free. It gives you the name of the person registered, age at death, and the year of their registration. However, the name of the spouse or parent is not indicated.\n\nScotland Death Records\n\nScotland enforced mandatory civil registration in 1855. Hence for records after 1855, you may obtain a list of valuable data about the deceased. This includes the person\u2019s full name, sex, marital status, and age in addition to the time, place, and cause of death. In case you are trying to trace your family, then Scotland\u2019s death records may be helpful. This is because you find the name of the deceased\u2019s spouse and much more about the parents. Regarding the deceased\u2019s father, you can find the full name and occupation. For the mother, the death record provides you with her name and maiden surname. However, if the parents are deceased, then it would be listed as such. To add up, an informant\u2019s name, address, and relation to the deceased are mentioned. The location and time of the death registration are also stated next to the registrar\u2019s signature. Only on 1855 death records, you find the deceased\u2019s birthplace along with the names and ages of his/her children.\n\nThis can be vital for your genealogy searches.\n\nThe Scotlands People Centre has records dating between 1855 and 2016 . It is an online platform that offers only basic information for free such as the deceased\u2019s name, year, and registration district.\n\nWales Death Records\n\nIn Wales, you can find plenty of information on a deceased. The death records show the deceased\u2019s name, age, and cause of death in addition to the date and place of death. The occupation is also indicated, but, for children, it is replaced with a parent\u2019s name. It is possible to discover a spouse\u2019s name from the death record. Both of these findings can help in genealogy searches about your family or somebody else\u2019s. Regarding the informant of the death, you can find his/her signature, residence, and relationship to the deceased. The mere chance of encountering a familial connection between the deceased and the informant can help you immensely in drawing the family tree.\n\nSearching the online platform at the General Register Office (GRO) of Wales allows you access to death records between 1837 to 1957 and 1984 to 2019 for free (https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/birth-marriage-death-england-and-wales/). Other online platforms provide information related to the deceased\u2019s full name, date, and place of death, but with no details about parents or spouses.\n\nNorthern Ireland Death Records\n\nIn searching the death records of Northern Ireland, you may unravel a lot about a deceased person. The records indicate the name, age, marital status, and period of sickness. Also, the date, location, and cause of death are stated in addition to the informant\u2019s signature, qualification, and dwelling. In case you are looking for a family member, the records can be of assistance by sometimes indicating the name of a married or widowed woman\u2019s husband. On the other hand, if the woman is single, then the father\u2019s name can be identified. Moreover, the occupation is substituted with a parent\u2019s name except the deceased being a child. Since 1973, the death records in Northern Ireland have included the deceased\u2019s date and place of birth.\n\nThe General Register Office in Northern Ireland (GRONI) offers an online search directory to look up death records. However, the online directory only covers death records that are more than 50 years old. To obtain the records that are not listed, you need to register an appointment at the GRONI\u2019s public search room in Belfast.\n\nHow To Find If Someone Died\n\nTo find out if someone died in the UK, you\u2019ll first want to know what time frame to look at. It\u2019s important to note that most all public records in the UK are sealed for 100 years. This means that if you\u2019re looking up the death record of a relative from over 100 years ago then you may be able to find this through the UK National Archives, genealogy websites or parish records, depending on how far back you are searching. For those that are looking for people that died today in the UK, ranging from a pandemic to natural causes, this information may be limited. Typically only immediate family can access recent UK death records.\n\nAdvertising Disclosure: This post may contain promotional links. publicrecordsearch.co.uk may be compensated if you use these links."}, {"url": "https://www.cwgc.org/find-records/find-war-dead/casualty-details/2773638/david%20george%20milne/", "page_content": "Learn more about the work of the CWGC\n\nCareers Want to work for the CWGC?

If so he'll have likely been involved in the D-Day landings given the date.

Lieut. James Milne Robb, Royal Air Force [D.F.C. and later D.S.O.], was crossing the Channel to England on a British biplane, when, some miles from Folkestone, his engine stopped. Fortunately he was at a good height and by executing a long volpane he brought his machine down near the Victoria Pier. On reaching the water it immediately commenced to sink. Mr. Robert Clark, a boatman, put off in a boat, accompanied by Mr. Flood, a lift attendant, and Lieut. Robb, who had climbed on to the tail of his aeroplane was taken off unhurt. Subsequently, at ow tide, the biplane was pulled out of the sea, and on Sunday was dismantled and removed in parts to the Hawkinge aerodrome.[/I] The Gloucester Journal, amongst others, identifies the aircraft as [I]'a \"Bristol\" aeroplane (1688).'[/I] So, can anyone tell me what this mystery 'Bristol' aeroplane was?

Its purpose was to make it a felony to engage in interstate or foreign commerce transport of \"any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose\". But the language was so broad that it was also applied to consensual sex between adults when wished.\n\nIn 1927, he was 17 years old when 10 years after the United States bought the U.S. Virgin Islands from the Danish government, the inhabitants were granted U.S. citizenship. While they can vote in congressional elections and presidential primaries, they cannot vote for President.\n\nIn 1932, by the time he was 22 years old, on February 27th, actress Elizabeth Taylor was born in London. Her parents were Americans living in London and when she was 7, the family moved to Los Angeles. Her first small part in a movie was in There's One Born Every Minute in 1942 but her first starring role was in National Velvet in 1944. She became as famous for her 8 marriages (to 7 people) as she was for her beauty and films.\n\nIn 1962, he was 52 years old when lasting from October 16th - 28th, the Cuban Missile Crisis was the closest that the United States and the Soviet Union came to nuclear war. The Soviet Union had been installing a nuclear missile base in Cuba. The United States established a blockade to stop the base from being completed. Through secret negotiations, war was averted: the Soviet Union agreed to dismantle their weapons in Cuba and the United States agreed to never invade Cuba and to dismantle weapons in Turkey and Italy.\n\nIn 1985, in the year of George Milne's passing, on March 15th, the first internet domain name was registered - Symbolics.com.

In 1913 he became commander of the artillery of the Fourth Division (Woolwich), and led this unit in France in August 1914 during the battles of Le Cateau, the Marne, and the Aisne. When Sir John French transferred the British Expeditionary Force to Flanders in October, Milne was promoted brigadier general; the next year promotion to major general on the General Staff of the Second Army followed. Milne's career shifted radically when he was given command of the Twenty-seventh Division and ordered to Salonika: he was chosen for this post primarily because it was believed that he was sufficiently strong of character to resist the blandishments of the French General Maurice Sarrail, the overall Allied field commander in Greece. In January 1916, Milne was entrusted with command of the XVI Corps, and later that year with all British forces at Salonika under General Sarrail, and then those under General Franchet d'Esperey. The story of the British at Salonika is one of frustration: Milne possessed insufficient troops, his units suffered from disease, and they labored under the difficulty of the terrain. The chief of the Imperial General Staff, Sir William Robertson, opted for a cautious stance in Greece against the Bulgars. It was not until April 24, 1917, that Milne was finally ordered to go on the attack near Lake Dorain, and he was repulsed with heavy losses. French and Serbian forces were finally able to advance against Bulgaria in 1918 and, after the collapse of the Sofia government, Milne advanced to the Turkish frontier, eventually occupying Constantinople after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. Milne remained at the Porte until November 1920, being promoted general that same year. Two years later he was given the Eastern Command at home, and in 1926 was appointed chief of the Imperial General Staff. He was promoted field marshal in 1928 and five years later retired as Baron Milne, of Salonika and Rubislaw, county of Aberdeen. Milne spent the Second World War enrolled in the Home Guard, and died in London on March 23, 1948.

He had a fine First-Class debut as an 18-year-old when he took 4/52 against Canterbury.\n\n\n\nOn the back of his Champions League performances, he was selected to play for the Kiwis against Pakistan in December 2010 and has so far played only a couple of T20Is. He was also named in the 30-man initial probables list for the 2011 World Cup, but didn't make the final cut.\n\n\n\nMilne was frequently hit with injuries during 2011-12, which interrupted his First-Class career to a great deal. However, he hit the headlines again when he was included in New Zealand's squad for the 2012 T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka.\n\n\n\nMilne, made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka in 2012. After being out of the international circuit for over a year, Milne then, received a surprise recall to the ODI side for the series against Sri Lanka in November 2013. He featured in two ODIs, but his performances were nothing to note about. He played an ODI each against West Indies and India at home, before playing four matches of the ODI series against Pakistan in the UAE in December 2014, where he grabbed eyeballs with his ability to consistently bowl at 145-150kph. Impressed by his show, the selectors named him in the squad for the 2015 World Cup.\n\n\n\nAlthough age is on Milne's side, he will have to constantly adapt his style to the changing pitch and conditions, if he needs to survive at the highest level. He needs to work towards maintaining high fitness levels, if he has to retain his place in the national side.\n\n\n\nFive years after making his debut, Milne has played only a handful of ODIs and T20Is because of constant injury. The fast bowler suffered a year of hamstring, side and elbow injuries before returning to franchise cricket with Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2017. After having a decent season in the IPL, Milne was named in the Champions Trophy squad.\n\n\n\nBy Srivathsa"}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Robert_Milne_(cricketer,_born_1852)", "page_content": "This is a list in alphabetical order of cricketers who have played for Lancashire County Cricket Club in top-class matches since the club was founded in 1864. Lancashire have held first-class status since their inaugural match in 1865. The details are the player's usual name followed by the seasons in which he was active as a Lancashire player. Names of those players who have represented England in Test cricket are preceded by the \u00a7 symbol. Names of overseas players (i.e., not England-qualified) are preceded by their national team's flag icon (e.g., ). The list excludes Second XI and other players who did not play for the club's first team; and players whose first team appearances were in minor matches only.\n\nMany players represented other top-class teams besides Lancashire and some played for the old Manchester Cricket Club before 1864. Eight of those represented a Manchester team styled Lancashire in 1864 before going on to play in first-class matches for the new club from 1865. Players who represented the county before 1865 are included if they also played for the county club but excluded if not. All players known to have represented the county before the formation of the county club are included in List of Manchester Cricket Club players. The list has been updated to the end of the 2021 cricket season using the data published in Playfair Cricket Annual, 2022 edition.[1]\n\n\n\n"}]}
