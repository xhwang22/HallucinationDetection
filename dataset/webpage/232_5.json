{"Micky Moody played on Snafu's first three albums.": [{"url": "https://blues.gr/profiles/blogs/an-interview-with-legendary-micky-moody-of-juicy-lucy-snafu", "page_content": "\"If possible, always play the kind of music that stimulates your emotions, and try to keep an open mind.\" Micky Moody: Mr. Rock n' Roll Guitar\n\nMicky Moody is best known for his role in the definitive Whitesnake line-up, though his vast and varied career was spawned out of a sixties school band which also included another future star, Free and Bad Company singer Paul Rodgers. Micky quickly graduated to the recording studios via the R&B combo Tramline before touring Britain and Europe with some of the countrys top soul musicians.\n\nJoining the highly acclaimed Juicy Lucy was a large step towards rock stardom, and major tours of Britain, Europe and the USA accompanied a regular output of recorded works. After Juicy Lucy split, Micky co-founded Snafu, combining his rock-style guitar with down-home stateside grooves, and became a major contributor on the song-writing front. Snafu recorded three albums and toured extensively before the individual members headed off to pursue their different ventures. Micky then became engrossed in session work as his reputation as a versatile performer spread. Soon a phone call from David Coverdale assured Micky of a vital place in his future plans, starting with the guitar slot and co-writing position on his forthcoming solo albums, Whitesnake and Northwinds.\n\n\n\nAs a sideman, Micky has featured alongside such classic British singers as Graham Bonnet, Frankie Miller, Chris Farlowe, Sheena Easton, Roger Chapman, Elkie Brookes and Eric Burdon. Visitors from the states such as Meat Loaf, Matt guitar Murphy, Ben E. King and Walter Trout have all employed his talents to enhance their performances.\n\nMicky's session work has included many T.V. commercials and some film scores. As a writer or co-writer his credits are numerous and include many of the classic Whitesnake favourites. With the Moody Marsden band, he and his guitar sparring partner Bernie Marsden toured extensively and released four albums before continuing their Whitesnake legacy with the Snakes and the Company of Snakes.\n\nIn 2000 Micky finally released his first solo album I Eat Them For Breakfast on Armadillo records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview by Michael Limnios\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat was the first gig you ever went to & what were the first songs you learned?\n\nAs a child I was taken by my parents to a Christmas pantomime where the special guests were Cliff Richard and the Shadows. I was aware of their music and, like a lot of youngsters who took up the guitar in the early 1960's, I was especially drawn to the playing of Hank Marvin. I went to private guitar lessons from the age of twelve, so the first tunes I learned to play where from guitar tutor books.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich was the best moment of your career and which was the worst?\n\nGetting my first gold album (Ready an'Willing - Whitesnake) was a great moment. Playing onstage with Eric Clapton was also special.\n\nThe worst was performing with Snafu at the huge Roosevelt Stadium in New Jersey supporting Emerson Lake & Palmer. It was the ugliest drink and drug-sodden atmosphere I have ever experienced. We should never have supported ELP, this was not our audience and our management were to blame. We had to leave the stage because of the abuse, and also to avoid the missiles that were thrown at us from a truly dystopian gathering.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you learn about yourself from music? What experiences in your life make you a GOOD musician?\n\nI believe the special 'something' that differentiates a good musician from a not-so-good musician is natural ability; you either have it or you don't. Practice, dedication, experience and inventiveness helps too!\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom whom have you have learned the most secrets about blues rock music & in which songs can someone hear the best of your work?\n\nI loved the Jeff Beck Group with Rod Stewart on vocals. They could take blues and soul songs and heavy them up, and some of their originals songs sounded very inspired. Beck played like nobody else, and still does. I'm also a fan of American guitarist Harvey Mandel, especially the stuff he did in the late 6o's-early 70's and, of course, Eric Clapton in Cream. Blues rock slide? Early Johnny Winter; Duane Allman; Lowell George; Ry Cooder; Zoot Horn Rollo; Sonny Landreth, and Glenn Ross Campbell's steel playing.\n\nI think I improved with age! Some of my best playing is on my solo albums 'I Eat Them For Breakfast' and 'Don't Blame Me'. I was more in control of my own destiny on those albums.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat characterizes your \u201cphilosophy\u201d about the music?\n\nI've always been fascinated by the number of different styles of music that you can coax from the guitar. I'm known primarily as an electric guitarist but I have always loved the natural sound of acoustic music. I've discovered a lot of open tunings throughout the years, and different types of right-hand picking techniques from pick and fingers, thumpick and fingers and flesh (no picks at all). In the last few years I have written and produced two instrumental albums: 'Acoustic Journeyman' and 'Electric Journeyman'. Although I've been involved in a lot of song writing over the years, playing the guitar is still my main passion. People sometimes ask me what is my favourite kind of music, and my answer is always \"Good music!\" If possible, always play the kind of music that stimulates your emotions, and try to keep an open mind.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy did you think that Micky Moody, continues to generate such a devoted following?\n\nI don't know if I have a devoted following! Maybe people appreciate that I've never been afraid to attempt different styles and that I try to express a range of emotions when I play.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the \u201cthing\u201d you miss most from the Tramline? Which memory from the Wildflowers makes you smile?\n\nTramline: I was only seventeen at the time, in great health with my whole life ahead of me. Yes, I miss that feeling! The Wildflowers: Traveling to London with the other three guys in an old van fitted-out with bunk beds; we were so dedicated!\n\n\n\n\n\nTell me about the beginning of Juicy Lucy. How did you get together and where did it start?\n\nJuicy Lucy's Singer Paul Williams had seen me perform in Tramline, Lucas and the Mike Cotton Sound and Zoot Money's band. He must have been impressed because when Neil Hubbard left Juicy Lucy to join the Grease Band he suggested me to the other guys. They were rehearsing at a house in the countryside so I went and rehearsed with them and got the job.\n\n\"I believe the special 'something' that differentiates a good musician from a not-so-good musician is natural ability; you either have it or you don't. Practice, dedication, experience and inventiveness helps too!\"\n\nWhat are some of the most memorable stories you've had from Juice Lucy?\n\nSoon after I joined Juicy Lucy we flew to the United States for a tour which lasted for nearly a month. It was my first time in America and suddenly I was looking at things and visiting places I'd only seen on television. New York: we played at the legendary Fillmore East supporting Cactus and Lee Michaels; visited Atlantic's famous recording studio where Roberts Flack was recording with some of the greatest session musicians in the US (including the great Bernard 'Pretty' Purdie on drums). The Fillmore West, San Francisco where we supported Elton John and The Kinks, and looking out on a warm November day at Alcatraz Prison and the San Francisco Bay. Los Angeles: two or three nights at the Whiskey A Go- Go, staying at the Tropicana Hotel - Californian groupies! Boston: two nights at the Boston Tea Party supporting Leon Russell and Elvin Bishop - both had great bands. Went to Chicago and Madison WN too.\n\nLots of touring, especially in Germany, and taking over as lead guitarist when members from the original line-up quit. It was all great experience!\n\n\n\n\n\nAny comments about your experiences with Chris Farlowe, Roger Chapman & Bernie Marsden? Would you like to tell your best memory about them?\n\nI was aware of Chris and Roger from my teens back in the north of England. Chris Farlowe and the Thunderbirds featured Albert Lee on guitar which was a real bonus for us guitar players. Tramline supported Family on a club date so I got see them live; Roger singing in that unusual fashion over very original-sounding songs. So it's been a thrill to actually work with them. Other great singers I've worked on stage with include Frankie Miller, Graham Bonnet, Gary Brooker, , Paul Rodgers in the Roadrunners/Wildflowers and David Coverdale in Whitesnake. Bernie and I developed a special understanding as dual guitarists, firstly with Whitesnake, then with the Moody Marsden Band. It had very little to do with Wishbone Ash or Thin Lizzie, and was influenced by the 60's British Blues players and American Southern Rockers like the Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd.\n\nWould you mind telling me your most vivid memory from Snafu?\n\nSee above! On a more positive note, recording the first album at the Manor Studios. We had a nice, tight funky thing going on in the early days.\n\n\"People sometimes ask me what is my favourite kind of music, and my answer is always \"Good music!\" If possible, always play the kind of music that stimulates your emotions, and try to keep an open mind.\"\n\nDo you remember anything interesting stories from Whitesnake?\n\nI have an incredible amount of interesting stories from my days with Whitesnake. How many weeks do you have to listen to them?!! It's impossible to pick out a few as there were so many. I had some of the best times of my life - it was the 70s, totally politically-incorrect, sexy and indulgent. That's all I'm saying!\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did you first meet John Mayall, do you remember anything interesting from touring with him?\n\nI was still in London after the breakup of the Wildflowers (1967) and Bruce Thomas, the bass player, discovered where John Mayall lived. Although I'd already decided that I would move back to my home town and spend some time studying the classical guitar, Bruce wanted to progress in the blues scene. We took the tube train to Paddington Station and walked a few blocks to Mayall's flat, which was at the top of a house close to the station. He had no idea who we were but was kind enough to invite us up to his flat, where his new guitarist Mick Taylor sat listening to blues albums. Bruce gave him his number for future reference and we had a nice cup of tea!\n\nI met him again the following year when Tramline supported his 'Crusade' band at the Marquee Club in London. In the spring of 1970, when I was playing with Zoot Money, we supported him and his drummer-less band on a number of shows on his British tour. His line-up was very odd: Jon Mark on nylon-strung guitar; Johnny Almond on Saxophones and Alex Dmochowski on bass. He seemed like quite a private, laid-back person.\n\n\"Being in a position to enjoy playing the guitar professionally, working with hundreds of talented people, writing songs and instrumentals pieces, and being able to afford good instruments.\"\n\nHow has the music business changed over the years since you first started in music?\n\nI was very lucky to have started my career in the Sixties and to have developed it in the Seventies. There was very little in the way of entertainment for the masses apart from music, TV (very limited those days) and film, and most people went to gigs and bought records. The opportunities were immense, unlike today were the public have so much choice, most of it available through the internet or multimedia. Recorded works and live performances were treated with respect and giving things for free, or worse, having them pirated, was rarely an option. I also think that, in some regards, technology has made the art of creating and performing music too accessible and instantaneous. If utilized correctly technology can be put to good use, but practice and dedication to one's instrument will always produce the better musician.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do you think that the blues doesn\u2019t quite get the recognition and respect that other genres seem to get? Give one wish for the BLUES\n\nI'm not sure I agree with your opinion! I think that after pop and rock, blues is one of the most accepted forms of music to be embraced by a wide audience. Long may the Blues continue!\n\n\"I would give more thought to the business side of things; there are a lot of smiling assassins out there who have no second thoughts about taking things that do not belong to them - usually money.\"\n\nWith such an illustrious career, what has given you the most satisfaction musically?\n\nBeing in a position to enjoy playing the guitar professionally, working with hundreds of talented people, writing songs and instrumentals pieces, and being able to afford good instruments.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference and similarity between the LIVE/GIG and the STUDIO feeling? And between your session projects, solo albums and the band\u2019s recording?\n\nThere's obviously a big difference between playing live and playing in a recording studio; some people excel in one and struggle with the other. I think that for most people, playing live is their raison d'etre, whilst the recording studio is a workshop within which you can create. I've been lucky enough to have had a lot of experience in both, some experiences turning out better than others. Playing live, there is (hopefully) an atmosphere created by both performers and audience, whereas you have to create an atmosphere in a studio - and concentrate - you have to live with the results!\n\nI'm in control of my own projects so I'm responsible for the outcome. On sessions you have to try and make the artist/producer comfortable and pleased with your efforts. I'm involved in a new band called Snakecharmer and we're all very experienced - watch out for us!\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there any memories from the US tour \u201cBest of British Blues\u201d, which you\u2019d like to share with us?\n\nUnfortunately the 'Best of British Blues' tour of 1996 was memorable for the wrong reasons. The line-up consisted of featured artists Eric Burdon and Alvin Lee, and the band was Aynsley Dunbar, Boz Burrell, Tim Hinkley and myself. I don't like to talk ill of the dead, but Boz created problems right from the first gig; he was unhappy with the promoter and seemed uncomfortable with the personnel. Halfway through the tour he went to pieces and couldn't continue, so Aynsley suggested Tony Franklin who'd played with bass with The Firm (Paul Rodgers/Jimmy Page). The band then seemed to split into two camps: Burdon, Dunbar and Franklin, and Lee, Hinkley and Moody. Eric Burdon thought that his guitarist should come to the House of Blues in L.A. and perform on stage with us just to show me how it should be done! What a fucking insult! Alvin sensed the vibes and a couple of gigs later he booked a plane home. We didn't even finish the tour. There were some good moments, but overall, definitely one to forget!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you go back to the past what things you would do better and what things you would avoid to do again?\n\nI would give more thought to the business side of things; there are a lot of smiling assassins out there who have no second thoughts about taking things that do not belong to them - usually money.\n\n\n\nMicky Moody - Official website\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.seaoftranquility.org/reviews.php?op=showcontent&id=20204", "page_content": "\n\n\n\n\n\nSNAFU: Live Nottingham 1976\n\nFresh from a solo album featuring the likes of Tony Iommi, Ian Paice and Herby Flowers, ex-Freedom singer Bobby Harrison formed the band SNAFU, bringing with him Juicy Lucy guitarist Micky Moody, who had also performed on the frontman's solo outing, Funkist. The pair bonded on and off stage and alongside one-time Procol Harum man Pete Solley (keys), Colin Gibson (bass) and drummer Terry Popple, recorded a self titled debut in 1973 and the Situation Normal follow up just one year later. The band's third album, 1975's All Funked Up, would see Brian Chatton handle keyboards in place of Solley, while Tim Hinkley added some piano. However by 1976 Hinkley was the band's full time keyboard player as SNAFU headed to Trent Polytechnic in Nottingham, where along with others, John Moon would record the show for Radio Trent. As he did many an act over the years, such as Thin Lizzy, Gerry Rafferty and Rory Gallagher. Fast forward to 1992 and Moon would sadly be made redundant from the radio station, when he, rather unusually, had the Radio Trent archive assigned over to him, saving 120 recorded concerts from being simply discarded in the process. That SNAFU show from 1976 was one of the many saved and now the six song set is presented here by Angel Air Records. With Harrison contributing to the interesting Jeff Perkins penned liner notes, it makes an involving bookend for a band who were over long before they really should have been. Moody tempted off to join David Coverdale's Whitesnake, the young guitarist making the understandable decision to throw his axe skills in with the ex-Deep Purple man as he forged ahead with his new group. SNAFU recruited Colloseum six stringer Clem Clempson, but with Harrison struggling to see a future for his band without Moody, things never worked out and SNAFU folded. Here three band originals, \"Long Gone\", \"Unsettled Dust\" and \"Highway\" compete keenly for attention with three covers, the band's deep, funky, bluesy style arguably ahead of its time. Harrison proves to have the perfect voice to nail the groove expertly into place, while it will come as no shock that Moody's fretwork possesses a real warmth and fluidity, even if this, understandably, is hardly a hi-tech recording. Once the band ended, Harrison turned his attention towards forming a new outfit, Niagra. Short lived, they would only record four tracks together for Tommy Vance's radio show, which are added here as bonuses. With the only source available being an old cassette recording, there's no denying this is scratchy stuff, and yet with a more commercially aware hard rock sound, \"Crossfire\" and \"Cold Eyes\" still suggest Niagra shouldn't have fallen as readily as their name suggested. However, they did, Harrison eventually moving to Iceland to take a break from the music business. If you're Bobby Harrison, Micky Moody or SNAFU completist, then Live In Nottingham 1976 will prove a vital addition to your collection. For anyone else there's undoubtedly a great hard blues rock act here to be discovered, although I'd suggest catching up with their studio output first.

Along with Juicy Lucy guitarist Micky Moody, he formed Snafu, a band that combined rock, funk, soul, and jazz for a sound that would later appear to be quite ahead of the times by many. They proceeded to record three albums from 1973-1975, but then broke up a few years after when the band failed to really catch on, and Moody was snatched up by David Coverdale for his new group Whitesnake. Live in Nottingham 1976 is a live recording from late in the bands career, and features Harrison & Moody alongside Tim Hinkley (keyboards), Colin Gibson (bass), and Terry Popple (drums). The album features a selection of band originals and some cover tunes, and while the recording isn't the greatest, it's still a fun document of an underrated band doing their thing live on stage. Snafu's mix of rock, funk and jazz is actually quite charming, Moody firing off some bluesy guitar licks over tight grooves and airy keyboards on \"Big Legged Woman\" and \"Long Gone\", while the bluesy \"Every Little Bit Hurts\" contains a fiery guitar solo and emotional vocal from Harrison. The uptempo \"Unsettled Dust\" has a strong Allman Brothers/Little Feat feel to it, and the band even cover the Allman's staple \"Don't Keep Me Wondering\", doing a fine job in the process. Moody gets his showcase on \"Highway\", a rousing blues rocker with no shortage of fiery guitar work that displays just why he was high on Coverdale's wish list for his then new band Whitesnake.\n\n\n\nThis Angel Air release also contains four bonus live radio tracks from 1977, when Harrison morphed Snafu into Niagra. Though the recordings are of even lesser quality than the Nottingham songs, you can hear Harrison's vision continue on, and the compositions are actually quite good, especially \"Cold Eyes\" and the atmospheric \"Don't Be a Fool\". Overall, this is an intriguing live document from the folks at Angel Air, and well worth a listen for all you Bobby Harrison and Micky Moody fans out there.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/micky-moody/", "page_content": "Michael Joseph \"Micky\" Moody (born 30 August 1950) is an English guitarist, and a former member of the rock bands Juicy Lucy and Whitesnake. He was also a founder-member of Snafu. Together with his former Whitesnake colleague Bernie Marsden he founded the Moody Marsden Band, and later, The Snakes, having previously collaborated with unofficial 5th Status Quo member Bob Young in Young & Moody. Along with Marsden and ex-Whitesnake bassist, Neil Murray, he formed Company of Snakes and M3 Classic Whitesnake with which they mainly performed early Whitesnake songs. More recently, he has toured and recorded with Snakecharmer.\n\nBesides this, Moody has also toured with Roger Chapman, Frankie Miller and Chris Farlowe. He has also performed live alongside the likes of Eric Clapton, Alvin Lee, Mick Taylor, Bruce Dickinson, Sam Brown, Gary Brooker, Suggs, Dennis Locorriere, Paul Jones, P. P. Arnold, James Hunter, Rick Wakeman, Jon Lord, Newton Faulkner, Uriah Heep, Alice Cooper, Mark King, Alfie Boe, Sandi Thom, Brian Auger, Paul Weller, Eric Bibb, Meat Loaf, Boy George, Elkie Brooks, Nona Hendryx, Mud Morganfield and one of his early guitar heroes, Duane Eddy. Since 2000 he has released several solo albums: I Eat Them For Breakfast (2000), Don't Blame Me (2006), Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009). A versatile guitarist, Moody has been an active session musician and his own website lists over 100 albums to which he has contributed musically. 2006 saw the release of the autobiographical Playing With Trumpets \u2013 A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship, a memoir about his early days on the music scene. His library music has been featured on such TV programmes as Waking the Dead, Bo' Selecta!, America's Next Top Model, How to Look Good Naked, Top Gear, Horizon, Jersey Shore, Mad Men, Wife Swap and Paul Hollywood's Bread.\n\nBiography\n\n1960s\n\nWhile still at school in Middlesbrough and attending private guitar lessons, Moody formed The Roadrunners with several others from the smae area including Paul Rodgers (later of Free and Bad Company). They were joined some time later by bass player Bruce Thomas, who moved onto play with Elvis Costello and the Attractions. The band performed a range of covers in local halls and clubs. By 1967 they had developed and outgrown the local music scene and turned professional, changing their name to The Wildflowers and subsequently moving to London. They had some success and undertook some touring, but relationships within the band frayed and they eventually split without making any recordings. Moody returned home to Middlesbrough where for a while he widened his musical horizons by taking classical guitar lessons. He also became increasingly interested in slide guitar techniques (a style he would later be closely associated with). While living in Middlesbrough he was asked by local singer and entrepreneur John McCoy, to form a group which became Tramline. A deal for two albums was signed with Island Records, but by the time the second album was released the band had broken up. Moody joined Lucas and the professional Soul band Mike Cotton Sound who became Gene Pitney's backing band for UK tours as well as others such as Paul Jones.\n\n1970s\n\nIn 1970 he joined the recently re-patriated keybopard player Zoot Money as guitarist. He then replaced Neil Hubbard in Juicy Lucy with whom he recorded three albums and toured extensively before the group disbanded. After the band split, Moody co-founded Snafu which combined his funk-rock guitar style with U.S down-home stateside grooves. The band recorded three albums SNAFU, Situation Normal and All Funked Up. They also appeared on a John Peel The Old Grey Whistle Test session and the T.V series Supersonic. Extensive touring followed before the band broke up. At this time Moody undertook occasional work as a session player most notably for Graham Bonnet. He also contributed to one track on Gerry Rafferty's City to City. He performed with the former Status Quo drummer John Coghlan's Diesel Band, then recorded an album with the band's tour manager and lyricist Bob Young which became Young & Moody. He then toured with Frankie Miller and stood in as a guste with with Hinkley's Heroes before joining his friend David Coverdale. Moody had known Coverdale from the local music scene in the Middlesbrough area in the late sixties, upto this time Coverdale had been fronting Deep Purple and was looking to undertake a solo venture. Coverdale invited Moody to work with him and the album White Snake was released in 1977. Moody shared writing credits on four songs including the title track. A second album Northwinds followed in 1978, on which Moody contributed to three songs. Following the demise of Deep Purple MkIV, Coverdale and Moody joined forces with Bernie Marsden, Neil Murray, Dave 'Duck' Dowle and keyboardist Brian Johnston to form a band that took its name Whitesnake from the title of Coverdale's first solo album. In 1978 they recorded the E.P Snakebite followed by two Studio albums, Trouble (1978) and Lovehunter (1979) which were recorded by a modified line up with Jon Lord on keyboards. Moody is credited with co-writing four of the ten tracks on Trouble and was sole writer of Belgian Tom's Hat Trick', an instrumental. While working with Whitesnake he also played slide guitar on Roger Chapman's debut solo album Chappo.\n\n1980s\n\nMoody contributed slide guitar to three tracks on former Lindisfarne member Ray Jackson's solo debut In the Night, which was released in 1980. By this point Whitesnake now featured Ian Paice from Deep Purple on drums, who had been brought into the group to replace Dowle. In 1980 this line up released the album Ready an' Willing, from which two UK singles were taken, Fool for Your Loving and the album title track, both co-written by Moody. The band also released the double album Live...in the Heart of the City in the same year. At his time he recorded two singles with Bob Young, with all tracks written by Moody.\n\nIn 1981 Graham Bonnet released his album Line-Up which featured Moody playing guitar on all tracks and also featured three songs written by Moody in partnership with Bob Young. Moody continued to maintain a busy schedule with Whitesnake and the band released the album Come an' Get Itin the same year. Relationships within the band were beginning to sour and Moody's guitar partner Bernie Marsden left prior to the final completion of the next album Saints and Sinners. Moody himself followed soon after. Whitesnake took time out for much of 1982 and Moody undertook some session work, with Sheena Easton and others. By late 1982 Whitesnake was reformed with Mel Galley replacing Marsden and Moody joining Galley on the album's backing vocal sessions. In 1983 Coverdale replaced Ian Paice and Neil Murray with Cozy Powell and Colin Hodgkinson. Moody was not happy with the direction the new band was taking and felt increasingly sidelined by Coverdale. However, despite the deteriorating situation within Whitesnake, Moody recorded Slide It In with them. A process he described as an 'unhappy experience' and after which he left the band in 1983.\n\nMoody returned to session work with Mike Oldfield, Gary Glitter, Mike d'Abo and Roger Chapman, as well as selected T.V music library work. He toured with Chris Farlowe and also worked with former Meal Ticket singer Willy Finlayson and his band the Hurters. Taking a wry, yet witty view on some of the people and experiences they'd encountered over the years, he got together with Bob Young to write a book on musician's humour, the acclaimed Language of Rock and Roll. He also put together the first version of the Micky Moody Band featuring former Taste bassist Charlie McCracken and drummer Chris Hunt. Towards the end of the decade he and Bernie Marsden played selected venues with their own Moody Marsden Band.\n\n1990s\n\nDuring the early part of the 1990s, Moody toured extensively with Roger Chapman before re-uniting on a more permanent basis with Whitesnake guitarist Bernie Marsden, to tour and record with the Moody Marsden Band in U.K and Europe. The Moody Marsden Band recorded two live albums, Never Turn Our Back on the Blues and Live in Hell and a studio set, Real Faith. In 1996, Moody toured the USA as part of the Best of British Blues tour which also featured Eric Burdon, Alvin Lee, Aynsley Dunbar, Boz Burrell and Tim Hinkley. The following year, Moody and Marsden teamed up with Norwegian rockers Jorn Lande, Willy Bendickson and Sid Ringsby to form The Snakes, a band that specialised in re-producing the sounds of the original Whitesnake. Don Airey would often be brought in to augment them on keyboards. The band recorded two albums, Once Bitten and Live in Europe before making way for The Company of Snakes, which featured in its line up former Bad Company vocalist Robert Hart, original Whitesnake bass player Neil Murray and ex-Manfred Mann's Earth Band drummer John Lingwood. Hart was eventually replaced by ex-Snakes in Paradise frontman Steffan Berggren, and the band released two albums, Burst the Bubble and a live set Here They Go Again.\n\n2000s\n\nIn 2000, Micky wrote and produced library music prior to the release of his first official solo album, I Eat Them For Breakfast. Whilst continuing to perform with Company of Snakes and take on occasional session work, Moody joined his former Juicy Lucy bandmate Paul Williams to arrange and record a selection of acoustic classic Chicago blues tracks for the album Smokestacks, Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men. He also started to play occasional duo gigs with bluesman Papa George. 'Snake' metamorphosed into M3 Classic Whitesnake and also released released a live CD featuring Martin and a live DVD featuring Berggren with a guest appearance from former Ritchie Blackmore and Yngwie Malmsteen frontman Doogie White. Also featured in this line-up were Go West and Tears for Fears drummer Jimmy Copley and keyboard player Mark Stanway from Magnum.\n\nAround this time Moody played on the album Nah Aufnahme by German musician Westernhagen, which eventually appeared in thethe national charts. 2006 saw the release of Moody's self-produced solo album Don't Blame Me which was released at the same time as publication of his autobiographical memoirsPlaying with Trumpets \u2013 A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship. M3 broke up later that year, after which Moody performed more shows with Roger Chapman plus selected dates with a line-up of the Micky Moody Band that featured his eldest son Micky Moody Jr. on drums. In 2008 he toured Japan as special guest of Jimmy Copley and Japanese guitar legend Char. Also featured was ex-Herbie Hancock bassist Paul Jackson and keyboard wizard Yoshinobu Kojima.

Among the many first-class musicians featured on this album was Micky Moody, then lead guitarist with Juicy Lucy. The collaboration between the two was so successful that they decided to form a completely new group and play American-inspired funk and R&B-flavoured rock.\n\nThis was the birth of Snafu, one of the finest and most soulful British acts of the mid-seventies. Bobby Harrison had a background of playing with Procol Harum, which he had joined as the last moment in the Spring of 1967, just before entering the studio to participate in the recording of their all-time classic, \"A Whiter Shade Of Pale\". The single, of course, became an overnight success, but soon after Harrison, along with the group's guitarist, was told to leave the band due to 'internal differences'.\n\n\n\nIt was a great shame that this unfortunate episode should become Bobby Harrison's biggest 'claim to fame', as he is certainly a most capable singer/songwriter/musician with an intriguing pedigree. Already a seasoned musician long before joining Procol Harum, he had been with legendary Southend group The Rockefellas since the late fifties, following which he became a member of several other outfits including Golden Apples Of The Sun (who released a single, 'Monkey Time ', for the Immediate label in 1965) and Powerpack (who did two singles for CBS in 1966 and 1967). He even sat in with the pre-Procol band, the Paramounts, on a few occasions and there are also rumours of a solo single, \"Sunny\", recorded for CBS in 1965 or 1966.\n\n\n\nAfter Procol Harum, Bobby Harrison formed Freedom, whose first line-up recorded a couple of singles and a soundtrack for an Italian film. However, as musical fashions started to change from psychedelia to heavy blues-rock, Bobby sacked the other group members and instead hired guitarist Roger Saunders and bass player Walter Monagham. This line-up recorded several albums as they soldiered on into the early seventies. Their newly found style, which they mastered to a tee, naturally won them a faithful live following, as did their impressive three-part harmony vocal work. However, commercial success on a larger scale sadly eluded them, and, disillusioned and disappointed, Freedom finally threw in the towel in 1972.\n\nFor a while Bobby's career seemed to go in the solo direction. In the meantime, he would occasionally gig with the aforementioned Juicy Lucy, after their original lead singer Paul Williams had left the group. In fact, this was where Bobby first became friends with guitarist Micky Moody.\n\n\n\nBorn in 1950 into a Northern working-class family, Micky Moody from an early age became infatuated with the sound of the electric guitar. His family had no particular musical background, but spotting his son's interests, Micky's father bought him a cheap guitar and provided him with tuition. Later - when Micky had formed his first band at school - his father even managed to get him his first gigs at the local Working Men's club. This band, incidentally, was called The Roadrunners and featured on bass and vocals one of Micky's classmates from school, a certain Paul Rodgers who would later become the lead singer of the much-acclaimed Free.\n\n\n\nAs the band started to get good - as one can easily imagine they would - they decided to go down to London and try their luck. Paul Rodgers wanted to concentrate more on his singing, so another bass player from the Middlesbrough area was drafted, Bruce Thomas (later of Quiver and Elvis Costello's Attractions). The year was 1967, the 'Summer of Love', and the group appropriately changed their name to The Wildflowers.\n\n\n\n\"We only did one recording,\" Micky Moody remembers. \"We put four of our own songs down on a 1/4-inch reel-to-reel. The guy who recorded it for us was Paul Kossoff, who of course later became the lead guitarist in Free. I dug out the tape some time ago to give it a listen, but unfortunately it had completely disintegrated.\"\n\n\n\nAfter starving in London for three months, The Wildflowers decided to call it a day. The group disbanded, and Micky went back to Middlesbrough to study classical guitar. Fortunately, he soon joined a local band called Tramline, who released two albums on Island Records. Then he once again decided to try his luck in London, this time as a member of The Mike Cotton Sound. The group backed singers such as Lucas, Gene Pitney, and Zoot Money. In July 1970, Moody was invited to join Juicy Lucy, with whom he stayed for three albums until Snafu was formed in October/November 1972.\n\n\n\nWhen Freedom split, Bobby Harrison had decided to give up playing drums and instead put all his creative energy into being a lead singer, songwriter and frontman. He and Micky Moody started writing together and auditioning new band members. They found former Tramline drummer Terry Popple (later previously with Van Morrison), bass player Colin Gibson (a former member of Ginger Baker's Airforce) and keyboard wizard/fiddle player Pete Solley (ex-Paladin, later in Whitesnake). Gibson suggested the name Snafu, a term he lifted from a Captain Beefheart LP. In fact, it is an unofficial military abbreviation for the ironic phrase, 'Situation Normal All Fucked Up'. The line-up proved to be a minor musical miracle and was from the beginning destined to become a musician's and a critic's band. The musical influences were mainly American and came from bands like The Allman Brothers and in particular Little Feat, whom Bobby Harrison still describes as \"one of my all-time favourite bands'. However, it would be a big mistake to write off the group as just carbon-copiers of early seventies US rock. Perhaps that was what they set out to be, but as it is often the case, something very special happened when this bunch of Englishmen mixed their own musical genes with influences from the other side of the Atlantic.\n\n\n\nIt's a story as old as The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, this strange bastard mixture, like a musical fish burger, which has managed to conquer the world over the last thirty-five years and change not only the face of popular music but also the lives of most people in the entire Western hemisphere. By the early 1970's, however, British rock seemed to have forgotten the recipe except for a few enthusiasts on the underground scene. These were the 'Bewilderment Years' dominated by overblown symphonic rock, pubescent glam rock, and weedy middle-aged popsters whose wildest escapades amounted to tying yellow ribbons around oak trees as old as themselves.\n\n\n\nThere were exceptions. Some small-time entrepreneur by the name of Richard Branson had built a studio called The Manor and started recording a long composition by an unknown guitarist, Mike Oldfield. Apparently, Branson was also impressed with the efforts of Snafu, who arrived at The Manor to record their first LP. In fact, Mike Oldfield was working on 'Tubular Bells' while Snafu were there (Pete Solley actually played briefly on the recording).\n\nFrom the band's first, eponymously titled, LP, the Moody/Harrison composition, 'Long Gone', was released as a single. Both the album and the 7' single received good reviews but were less successful commercially. It didn't seem to bother Micky much: \"I was very much against being commercial in any way at the time,\" he recalls. \"I was happy with Snafu being a bit of an underground act with a cult following.\" Harrison, however, had ambitions on a different level. Perhaps his past as a member of Procol Harum made him more eager to reach for the sky. \"I really wanted us to sell a lot of records,\" he states. \"I wanted us to have that big hit single. It never happened, and to me that was one of the main reasons why the band had to throw in the towel at the end.\"\n\n\n\nHowever, at the time when 'Snafu' was released, everything looked rosy. The group started out on a tour to promote the album. They toured Europe with The Doobie Brothers, and the U.S. with The Eagles.\n\n\n\nOn the second LP, \"Situation Normal\", Pete Solley had taken over much of the control of the band. There is a strong country-rock influence on this album, which makes you either hate or love it. Personally, I can't get enough of it and Pete's keyboard/fiddle playing on the LP is equally wonderful. At the same time, Micky Moody was exploring music by the likes of Ry Cooder and getting more and more into playing slide guitar. Harrison's vocal work is sublime and the rhythm section is both tight and soulful. This is an album that should have made most fellow British rock acts at the time blush with embarrassment. Surprisingly, it was not as well reviewed as its predecessor and, in retrospect, it is easy to see that Snafu had already embarked on a steady downhill journey.\n\n\n\n\"Once again we toured America to promote,\" Micky recalls. \"But they had put us on as a support act for Emerson Lake & Palmer, which was a total mistake. We had a completely different audience to them.\" The band also toured Europe with War and did a lot of TV and radio appearances.\n\nSnafu's third LP, \"All Funked up\", has long been seen as their 'great lost album'. Highly elusive in its original vinyl format, it is now presented by Angel Air for the first time on compact disc. By the time the group came around to recording the LP, Pete Solley had left to join Procol Harum. He was replaced first by Brian Chatton (previously with John Miles) and later by Tim Hinkley, who was a much-used session player at the time. They both play an the album, which again was recorded at The Manor.\n\n\n\nShortly after, the general feeling of disillusionment and loss of direction which dominated the established British rock scene in the mid-seventies finally caught up with Snafu as well. During a tour of Germany, Moody was invited to join David Coverdale. He accepted. Moody played guitar on Coverdale's two solo LPs and then took part in the formation of Whitesnake. Playing on all of Whitesnake's records throughout the late seventies and early eighties, he also wrote or co-wrote hits such as \"Slow An' Easy\" and \"Fool For Your Lovin'\". He furthermore played on Graham Bonnet's hit, \"Night Games\".\n\n\n\nMoody's immense talent and versatility also made him a much-in-demand session player around this time. The post-Whitesnake eighties turned out to be his least favourite time musically, but he is currently active again, touring and recording with The Snakes, featuring fellow Whitesnake guitarist Bernie Marsden (with whom he also tours and records occasionally as The Moody-Marsden Band).\n\n\n\nBobby tried to keep Snafu together for a while with Clem Clempson (Colosseum, Humble Pie, Champion) on guitar, but it didn't work. \"I then started hanging out with people like Reg Isadore, the drummer who had been with Robin Trower and Joe Jammer. We had a band together and lived in Chicago for a couple of years. Unfortunately, our manager died and the whole thing just ended in disaster. But then I met this Icelandic girl whom I made pregnant, moved to Reykjavik with her and began a whole new chapter of my life.\"\n\nHere he teamed up with local supergroup Mezzoforte with whom he recorded the wonderful \"Solid Silver\" album in 1987, a strong collection of R&B classics displaying his immense abilities as a singer. Today, Bobby Harrison finds himself back in Southend again. \"At the end, I discovered I had this yearning for my roots, and I'd done everything I could do in Iceland anyway. So I'm involving myself with a number of different projects here at the moment. I'm preparing for a new album, writing with Gus Isadore, and playing in a duo with a young guitarist from around these parts, Andy Rowlons. I tried to reform Snafu with a group of local musicians but found it was impossible, at least for me. The original band was a unique combination, which can never be recreated.\n\n\n\nLuckily, it seems as if we haven't heard the last from Bobby Harrison.\n\n\n\nClaes Johansen\n\n(Taken from the CD reissue of \" All Funked Up \", Angel Air, SJPCD032, January 2000)"}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Micky_Moody", "page_content": "What we do.

He was also a founder-member of Snafu. Together with his former Whitesnake colleague Bernie Marsden he founded the Moody Marsden Band, and later, The Snakes, having previously collaborated with unofficial 5th Status Quo member Bob Young in Young & Moody. Along with Marsden and ex-Whitesnake bassist, Neil Murray, he formed The Company of Snakes and M3 Classic Whitesnake with which they mainly performed early Whitesnake songs. From 2011 to 2015, Moody toured and recorded with Snakecharmer, a band he co-formed.\n\nBesides this, Moody has also toured with Roger Chapman, Frankie Miller and Chris Farlowe. He has also performed live alongside the likes of Eric Clapton, Alvin Lee, Mick Taylor, Bruce Dickinson, Sam Brown, Gary Brooker, Suggs, Dennis Locorriere, Paul Jones, P. P.

They were subsequently joined by bass player Bruce Thomas, later to play with Elvis Costello and the Attractions. The band performed covers in local halls and clubs. By 1967 they had developed and outgrown the local music scene and turned professional, changing their name to The Wildflowers and subsequently moving to London. They had some success and undertook some touring, but relationships within the band frayed and they eventually split without making any recordings. Moody returned home to Middlesbrough where for a while he widened his musical horizons by taking classical guitar lessons. He also became increasingly interested in slide guitar techniques (a style he would later be closely associated with). While living in Middlesbrough he was asked by local singer and entrepreneur John McCoy, to form a group which became Tramline. A deal for two albums was signed with Island Records, but by the time the second album was released the band had broken up. Moody joined Lucas and the professional Soul band Mike Cotton Sound who became Gene Pitney's backing band for UK tours as well as others such as Paul Jones.[3][4]\n\n1970s\n\nIn 1970 he joined recently re-patriated keyboard player Zoot Money as guitarist. He then replaced Neil Hubbard in Juicy Lucy with whom he recorded three albums and toured extensively before the group disbanded. After the band split, Moody co-founded Snafu which combined his funk-rock guitar style with U.S down-home stateside grooves. The band recorded three albums SNAFU, Situation Normal and All Funked Up. They also appeared on a John Peel The Old Grey Whistle Test session and the T.V series Supersonic. Extensive touring followed before the band broke up. At this time Moody undertook occasional work as a session player most notably for Graham Bonnet. He also contributed to one track on Gerry Rafferty's City to City. He performed with the former Status Quo drummer John Coghlan's Diesel Band, then recorded an album with the band's tour manager and lyricist Bob Young which became Young & Moody. He then toured with Frankie Miller and stood in as a guest with Hinkley's Heroes before joining his friend David Coverdale. Moody knew Coverdale \u2013 who had fronted Deep Purple and was looking to undertake a solo venture \u2013 from the Middlesbrough music scene in the late sixties. Coverdale invited Moody to work with him and the album White Snake was released in 1977. Moody shared writing credits on four songs including the title track. A second album Northwinds followed in 1978, on which Moody contributed to three songs. Following the demise of Deep Purple MkIV, Coverdale and Moody joined forces with Bernie Marsden, Neil Murray, Dave 'Duck' Dowle and keyboardist Brian Johnston to form a band that took its name Whitesnake from the title of Coverdale's first solo album. In 1978 they recorded the E.P Snakebite followed by two studio albums, Trouble (1978) and Lovehunter (1979), recorded by a modified lineup with Jon Lord on keyboards. Moody is credited with cowriting four of the tracks on Trouble and was sole writer of 'Belgian Tom's Hat Trick', an instrumental. While working with Whitesnake he also played slide guitar on Roger Chapman's debut solo album Chappo.[citation needed]\n\n1980s\n\nMoody contributed slide guitar to three tracks on former Lindisfarne member Ray Jackson's solo debut In the Night, which was released in 1980. By this point Whitesnake now featured Ian Paice from Deep Purple on drums, who had been brought into the group to replace Dowle. In 1980 this line up released the album Ready an' Willing, from which two UK singles were taken, Fool for Your Loving and the album title track, both co-written by Moody. The band also released the double album Live...in the Heart of the City in the same year. At his time he recorded two singles with Bob Young, with all tracks written by Moody.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1981, Graham Bonnet's Line-Up featured Moody playing guitar on all tracks and three songs written by Moody with Bob Young. Moody maintained a busy schedule with Whitesnake and the band released the album Come an' Get Itin the same year. Relationships within the band were beginning to sour and Moody's guitar partner Bernie Marsden left prior to the final completion of the next album Saints and Sinners. Moody himself followed soon after. Whitesnake took time out for much of 1982 and Moody undertook some session work, with Sheena Easton and others.[citation needed] By late 1982 Whitesnake was reformed with Mel Galley replacing Marsden and Moody joining Galley on the album's backing vocal sessions. In 1983 Coverdale replaced Ian Paice and Neil Murray with Cozy Powell and Colin Hodgkinson. Moody was unhappy with the direction the new band was taking and felt increasingly sidelined by Coverdale.[5] Despite this deteriorating situation, he recorded Slide It In \u2013 a process he described as an 'unhappy experience' \u2013 but then left the band in 1983.[1]\n\nMoody returned to session work with Mike Oldfield, Gary Glitter, Mike d'Abo and Roger Chapman, as well as selected TV music library work. He toured with Chris Farlowe and worked with former Meal Ticket singer Willy Finlayson and his band the Hurters. Taking a wry, witty view of some of the people and experiences they'd encountered over the years, he and Bob Young wrote a book on musicians' humour, the acclaimed Language of Rock and Roll. He also put together the first version of the Micky Moody Band, featuring former Taste bassist Charlie McCracken and drummer Chris Hunt. Towards the end of the decade, he and Bernie Marsden played selected venues with their own Moody Marsden Band.[citation needed]\n\n1990s\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Moody toured extensively with Roger Chapman. \"What a bloke,\" marvelled the singer. \"Every hotel we stayed in, he used to get his black bin-liners out and start taping them to the windows \u2013 can't sleep if there's any light in the room. They used to think he was mad. Lovely fella though. A great guitarist. And intelligent too. Too intelligent for Coverdale.\"[6]\n\nMoody reunited on a more permanent basis with Whitesnake guitarist Bernie Marsden, to tour and record as the Moody Marsden Band in U.K and Europe. They issued two live albums, Never Turn Our Back on the Blues and Live in Hell and a studio set, Real Faith. In 1996, Moody toured the US as part of the Best of British Blues tour, also featuring Eric Burdon, Alvin Lee, Aynsley Dunbar, Boz Burrell and Tim Hinkley. The following year, Moody and Marsden teamed up with Norwegian rockers J\u00f8rn Lande, Willy Bendickson and Sid Ringsby to form The Snakes, a band that specialised in reproducing the sounds of the original Whitesnake. Don Airey would often be brought in to augment them on keyboards. The band recorded two albums, Once Bitten and Live in Europe before making way for The Company of Snakes, which featured former Bad Company vocalist Robert Hart, original Whitesnake bass player Neil Murray and ex-Manfred Mann's Earth Band drummer John Lingwood. Hart was eventually replaced by ex-Snakes in Paradise frontman Stefan Berggren, and the band released two albums, Burst the Bubble and a live set Here They Go Again.[citation needed]\n\n2000s\n\nIn 2000, Micky wrote and produced library music prior to the release of his first official solo album, I Eat Them For Breakfast. Continuing to perform with Company of Snakes and take on occasional session work, Moody joined his former Juicy Lucy bandmate Paul Williams[7] to arrange and record a selection of acoustic classic Chicago blues tracks for the album Smokestacks, Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men. He also played occasional duo gigs with bluesman Papa George.[citation needed] 'Snake' metamorphosed into M3 Classic Whitesnake and also released a live CD (featuring former Black Sabbath singer Tony Martin) and a live DVD with the former The Company Of Snakes singer Stefan Berggren back, and with the special guest appearance from former Ritchie Blackmore and Yngwie Malmsteen frontman Doogie White. The DVD also featured sessionman Jimmy Copley (who worked with bands such as Go West and Tears for Fears) on drums and Mark Stanway from Magnum on the keyboards.\n\nAround this time Moody played on Nah Aufnahme by German musician Westernhagen, which eventually appeared in the national charts. 2006 saw the release of Moody's self-produced solo album Don't Blame Me, released at the same time as his memoirs Playing with Trumpets \u2013 A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship. M3 broke up later that year, after which Moody performed more shows with Roger Chapman plus selected dates with a line-up of the Micky Moody Band that featured his eldest son Micky Moody Jr. on drums. In 2008 he toured Japan as special guest of Jimmy Copley and Japanese guitar legend Char. Also featured was ex-Herbie Hancock bassist Paul Jackson and keyboard wizard Yoshinobu Kojima. The shows were recorded and released on DVD as Jimmy Copley & Char: Special Session. To celebrate his love of instrumental music, Micky wrote and produced the albums Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009).\n\n2010s\n\nIn 2011, Moody co-wrote library music for both Warner/Chapell and Universal before co-forming Snakecharmer, a line up which also includes former Whitesnake colleague Neil Murray, former Wishbone Ash guitarist Laurie Wisefield, singer Chris Ousey (Heartland), drummer Gary James (Thunder, Magnum) and Ozzy's keyboardist Adam Wakeman. In 2015, Moody left \"Snakecharmer\" to pursue his solo career.

Before the recording, original keyboard player Pete Solley had left to be replaced by Brian Chatton (previously with John Miles) and Tim Hinckley who was a much-in-demand session player at this time.\n\nOriginal members Bobby Harrison (ex-Procol Harum, Freedom) and Micky Moody (ex-Juicy Lucy) had worked together on Harrison\u2019s solo LP \u201cFunkist\u201d after the demise of Freedom in 1972. Harrison decided to take the role of singer and frontman and he and Moody started to audition new band members. They found former Tramline drummer Terry Popple (later with Van Morrison) and bassist Colin Gibson (a former member of Ginger Baker\u2019s Airforce).\n\nSnafu were something of a musician\u2019s band and drew their influences from American Southern Rock, notably the Allman Brothers and Little Feat. After three albums and several European tours the band split, Micky Moody going on to Whitesnake. Bobby Harrison spent some time in Iceland where he teamed up with Mezzoforte for the \u201cSolid Silver\u201d album (Angel Air SJPCD011).\n\nReviews"}, {"url": "https://www.discogs.com/master/320764-Snafu-Snafu", "page_content": "BadCatRecord Mar 3, 2023 Report\n\nSnafu evolved out of 1973 recording sessions for what was planned to be former Procol Harum and Freedom singer/drummer Bobby Harrison's debut album. One of the musicians playing on the recording sessions was Juicy Lucy guitarist Mickey Moody. Harrison and Moody clicked and the planned solo album was dropped in favor of a full collaboration under the Snafu moniker. Backing the pair were former Ginger Baker's Airforce bassist Colin Gibson, ex-Paladin keyboardist Pete Solley, and former Tramline drummer Terry Popple.\n\n\n\nSigned by Vertigo (Capital acquiring US distribution rights), the band's self-titled debut was recorded in Oxford's Manor Studios with the band and Vic Smith co-producing. With Harrison and Moody responsible for collaborating on the majority of the eight songs, the album wasn't particularly focused. Harrison was clearly enamored with American country, funk, and soul and the album found the band bouncing across all of those idioms. With the spotlight on Harrison's vocals, he exhibited a nice, rustic voice, but few of the songs really stood out. The performances were never less than professional, but country-flavored tracks like 'Monday Morning' and 'Funky Friend' were totally wasted on my ears. In contrast Harrison and company were at their best on the more conventional rock numbers like the opener 'Long Gone' and the Gospel-tinged 'That's the Song.' Perhaps because it was so strange, their cover of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff's 'Drowning In the Sea of Love' was the album's most entertaining performance. Anyone family with Joe Simon's cover is going to be surprised by their rocked-up cover. Their re-arrangement really shouldn't have worked, but somehow it did. Still, it wasn't enough to salvage what was a pretty forgettable debut.\n\n\n\nIn support of the album the band undertook a European tour opening for The Doobie Brothers. That was followed by an American tour opening for The Eagles. Neither did much to help sales.\n\n\n\n\"Snafu\" track listing:\n\n(side 1)\n\n1.) Long Gone (Bobby Harrison - Mickey Moody) - 5:15 rating: **** stars\n\n'Long Gone' was originally written and recorded for Harrison's \"Funkist\" solo LP. Rerecorded for Snafu, imagine Bad Company with a Southern rock edge and you'll get a feel for the tune. Yes, powered by Bobby Harrison's gritty voice this was blues-rock, but with an enjoyable funky edge. And the secret sauce to that funky edge came in the form of Colin Gibson's awesome bass line. Would have made a dandy FM single.\n\n2.) Said He the Judge (Bobby Harrison - Mickey Moody - Pete Solley) - 4:31 rating: *** stars\n\nThe country-blues 'Said He the the Judge' showcased some crisp Mickey Moody slide guitar, but otherwise didn;t have a great deal to offer up.\n\n3.) Monday Morning (Bobby Harrison - Mickey Moody) - 3:16 rating: ** stars\n\nStarting as a straight ahead country hoedown showcasing Moody on mandolin, 'Monday Morning' added in some traditional folk elements. Still, it left me wondering what I'd stumbled into. The performance was fine, but I would have bought a country album if I wanted to hear the genre.\n\n4. Drowning In the Sea of Love (Kenny Gamble - Leon Huff) - 5:49 rating: **** stars\n\nAnd just when you were wondering what else they could throw into the mix, along came their cover of of the soul classic 'Drowning In the Sea of Love.' Of course they didn't play it straight, rather gave it a twist that sounded like a cross between something Norman Whitfield would have produced for The Temptations and classic Robin Trower. I love the Joe Simon version, so it took a couple of spins for this rocking version to catch my attention. It made for an interesting choice of singles:\n\n- 1973's 'Drowning In a Sea of Love' b/w 'Monday Morning' (Capitol catalog number 3903)\n\n\n\n(side 2)\n\n1.) Country Nest (Bobby Harrison - Pete Solley) - 5:19 rating: ** stars\n\n'Country Nest' was a bland land hippy country-rock tune ... I guess the lyrics were funny, to the extent these guys could identify with American country-rockers. The melody was pretty enough and the harmony vocals were sweet, but you couldn't help thinking you'd heard it all before.\n\n2.) Funky Friend (Bobby Harrison - Mickey Moody) - 4:05 rating: ** stars\n\nAny song that starts out with a Pete Solley fiddle solo is facing an uphill battle with my ears. Pass.\n\n3.) Goodbye U.S.A. (Bobby Harrison - Mickey Moody) - 4:22 rating: *** stars\n\nThankfully the autobiographical 'Goodbye U.S.A' opened up with some nice Moody lead guitar. Also showcasing Solley's cheesy '70s synthesizers, the result was a smooth, adult contemporary rock tune boasting a sweet melody and nice harmonies. Perfect for shopping at your local supermarket. For some reason the track was tapped as a Dutch single:\n\n- 1973's 'Goodbye U.S.A.' b/w 'Dixie Queen' (Vertigo catalog number 6165 011)\n\n4.) That's the Song (Bobby Harrison - J. Marcellinio) - 6:03 rating: *** stars\n\nOn the Gospel-rock tinged 'That's the Song' Harrison's performance has always reminded me of something Bonnie and Delaney might have recorded. Certainly not for everyone, but it was a good showcase for Harrison's voice and Moody's chops.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/7803426", "page_content": "Infobox musical artist |\n\nName = Snafu\n\nBackground = group_or_band\n\nOrigin = UK flagicon|UK\n\nGenre = Rhythm and Blues , rock\n\nYears_active = 1972 \u2013 1975\n\nLabel = WWA .

Featured on this album was Micky Moody , then lead guitarist with Juicy Lucy. The collaboration between the two was so successful that they decided to form a completely new group and play American-inspired funk and R&B-flavoured rock.\n\nBobby Harrison had a background of playing with Procol Harum , and participated in the recording of their all-time classic, \" A Whiter Shade of Pale \". Soon after, however, Harrison was told to leave the band due to 'internal differences'. After Procol Harum, Bobby Harrison formed Freedom, whose first line-up recorded a couple of singles and a soundtrack for an Italian film. Commercial sadly eluded them and Freedom disbanded in 1972. After that, Bobby would occasionally gig with Juicy Lucy where he became friends with guitarist Micky Moody .\n\nBorn in 1950 into a Northern working-class family, Micky Moody from an early age became infatuated with the sound of the electric guitar. Later - when Micky had formed his first band at school - his father managed to get him his first gigs at the local Working Men's club. This band, called The Roadrunners, featured on bass and vocals one of Micky's classmates from school, a certain Paul Rodgers who would later become the lead singer of the much-acclaimed Free.\n\nAs the band started to get good another bass player from the Middlesbrough area was drafted, Bruce Thomas (later of Quiver and Elvis Costello 's Attractions) and the group changed their name to The Wildflowers. After three months the group disbanded, and Micky went back to Middlesbrough to study classical guitar. Fortunately, he soon joined a local band called Tramline and was then was a member of The Mike Cotton Sound. In July 1970, Moody was invited to join Juicy Lucy, with whom he stayed for three albums until Snafu was formed in October/November 1972 .\n\nBobby Harrison and Micky Moody started writing together and auditioning new band members. They found former Tramline drummer Terry Popple (previously with Van Morrison ), bass player Colin Gibson (formerly of Ginger Baker 's Airforce) and keyboard /fiddle player Pete Solley (later in Whitesnake ). Gibson suggested the name Snafu , a term he lifted from a Captain Beefheart LP. The line-up proved to be a musician's and critic's band. The musical influences were mainly American and came from bands such as The Allman Brothers and in particular Little Feat , one of Bobby Harrison\u2019s favourite bands'.\n\nRichard Branson , who had recently built The Manor Studio , had started recording a long composition by an unknown guitarist, Mike Oldfield , was also impressed with the efforts of Snafu, who arrived at The Manor Studio to record their first LP. In fact, Oldfield was working on ' Tubular Bells ' while Snafu were there and Pete Solley actually played briefly on the recording.\n\nThe band's first, eponymously titled, LP and single received good reviews but were less successful commercially. However, at the time when 'Snafu' was released the group successfully toured Europe with The Doobie Brothers and then the U.S. with The Eagles .\n\nOn the second LP, \" Situation Normal \", Pete Solley had taken over much of the control of the band and there is a strong country-rock influence on this album. It was not as well reviewed as its predecessor. The band toured America as a support act for Emerson Lake and Palmer , but participation in the tour was seen by many as a mistake.\n\nThe band recorded up to eight songs in session for the BBC around this time.\n\nSnafu's third LP, \" All Funked Up \", has long been seen as their 'great lost album' and is highly elusive in its original vinyl format. Pete Solley had left to join Procol Harum . He was replaced first by Brian Chatton (previously with John Miles ) and later by Tim Hinkley , who was a much-used session player at the time. They both play on the album, which again was recorded at The Manor.\n\nDuring a tour of Germany, Moody was invited to join David Coverdale and he accepted. Harrison tried to keep Snafu together for a while with Clem Clempson ( Colosseum (band) , Humble Pie , Champion) on guitar, but it didn't work.\n\nSnafu are notable for their combining of the British rhythm and blues tradition with U.S inspired elements of funk and country music . Micky Moody 's distinctive guitar playing, often with slide, provided the band with a distnctive hard-edged R&B sound, particularly on such numbers as \"Lock and Key\" and \"Hard To Handle\".\n\n[This chronology adapted from original material by Alex Gitlin [ [ http://www.alexgitlin.com/npp/snafu.htm | Alex Gitlin's History of SNAFU ] ] ]\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/4039868", "page_content": "Michael Joseph \"Micky\" Moody (born 30 August 1950) is an English guitarist, and a former member of the rock bands Juicy Lucy and Whitesnake. He was also a founder-member of Snafu. Together with his former Whitesnake colleague Bernie Marsden he founded the Moody Marsden Band, and later, The Snakes. Along with Marsden and ex-Whitesnake bassist, Neil Murray, he formed Company of Snakes and M3 Classic Whitesnake with which they mainly performed early Whitesnake songs. From 2010 he has been working with Murray, guitarist Laurie Wisefield, drummer Harry James, singer Chris Ousey and keyboard player Michael Bramwell in Monsters of British Rock which has morphed into Snakecharmer with Adam Wakeman on keyboards.\n\nBesides this, Moody has also toured with Roger Chapman, Frankie Miller and Chris Farlowe. He has also worked alongside the likes of Eric Clapton, Alvin Lee, Mick Taylor, Bruce Dickinson, Sam Brown, Gary Brooker, Suggs, Dennis Locorriere, Paul Jones, PP Arnold, James Hunter, Rick Wakeman, Jon Lord, Newton Faulkner and Uriah Heep. For TV he has also accompanied such stars as Meat Loaf, Boy George, Elkie Brooks, Nona Hendryx, Ben E. King and one of his early guitar heroes, Duane Eddy. Since 2000 he has released several solo albums: I Eat Them For Breakfast (2000), Don't Blame Me (2006), Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009).[1] A versatile guitarist, Moody has been an active session musician and his own website lists over 100 albums to which he has contributed musically. 2006 saw the release of the autobiographical Playing With Trumpets - A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship, a memoir about his early days on the music scene.[2] His media music has been featured on such TV programmes as Waking the Dead, Bo Selecta, America's Next Top Model, How To Look Good Naked, Top Gear, Mad Men and Wife Swap USA.\n\nBiography\n\n1960s\n\nWhile still at school in Middlesbrough and regularly attending private guitar lessons, Moody formed a band named The RoadRunners with several other local boys including Paul Rodgers (later to form Free and Bad Company), and later, Bruce Thomas, who would eventually play bass with Elvis Costello and the Attractions. The band were kept busy performing a range of covers in local halls and clubs. By 1967 they had developed and outgrown the local music scene so they took the decision to turn professional, change their name to the Wildflowers, and move to London. They had some success and undertook some touring, but relationships within the band frayed and they eventually split without ever releasing any recordings. Moody returned home to Middlesbrough where for a while he widened his musical horizons by taking classical guitar lessons. He also became increasingly interested in slide guitar techniques (a style he would later be closely associated with). While living in Middlesbrough he was asked by local singer and entrepreneur, John McCoy, to form a group which became Tramline. A deal for two albums was signed with Island Records, but by the time the second album was released the band had already split and gone their separate ways. At this point Moody joined Lucas and the Mike Cotton Sound who, as well as proving to be a highly-polished Soul band, also acted as Gene Pitney's backing band for his UK tours as well as backing others, such as Paul Jones.[3][4]\n\n1970s\n\nIn 1970 he joined the recently re-patriated Zoot Money before replacing Neil Hubbard in Juicy Lucy. As a member of Juicy Lucy, he recorded three albums and toured extensively before the group disbanded. After the band split, Micky co-founded Snafu which combined his funk-rock guitar style with some down-home stateside grooves. The band recorded three albums - SNAFU, Situation Normal, and All Funked Up. They also appeared on a John Peel session, the Old Grey Whistle Test and Supersonic and toured extensively before the individual members headed off to pursue different ventures. Moody undertook occasional work as a session player before, during and after Snafu, most notably for Graham Bonnett. He also contributed to one track on City to City by Gerry Rafferty. Moody performed as an original member of Status Quo drummer John Coghlan's Diesel Band, then recorded an album with the band's tour manager and lyricist, Bob Young. The result was Young & Moody. He then toured with Frankie Miller and guested with Hinkley's Heroes before hooking up with another friend from the North East, David Coverdale. Micky had known Coverdale from the local music scene in the Middlesbrough area in the late sixties, but by this point Coverdale had been fronting Deep Purple and was looking to undertake a solo venture. He invited Moody to assist and the result was the album White Snake released in 1977 which was followed by a second album Northwinds in 1978. Moody shared writing credits on four of the nine songs on Whitesnake (including the title track) and three of the eight songs featured on Northwinds. With the demise of Deep Purple MkIV, Coverdale and Moody joined forces with Bernie Marsden, Neil Murray, Dave 'Duck' Dowle and keyboardist Brian Johnston (replaced after a few months by Pete Solley) to form a band that took its name Whitesnake from the title of Coverdale's first solo album. In 1978 they recorded the EP Snakebite followed by two Studio albums: Trouble (also in 1978) and Lovehunter (1979) which were recorded by a modified line up with Jon Lord on keyboards. Moody is credited with co-writing four of the ten tracks on Trouble, and was sole author of a fifth (the lively instrumental, Belgian Tom's Hat Trick). He contributed to three of the ten songs on Lovehunter, most notably the title track. While working with Whitesnake he found time to play slide guitar on several tracks on Roger Chapman's debut solo album, Chappo.\n\n1980s\n\n\n\nCourtesy: Andrew King Bernie Marsden (left) and Micky Moody; at Hammersmith Odeon, in 1981Courtesy: Andrew King\n\nMoody contributed slide guitar to three tracks on Ex-Lindisfarne Ray Jackson's solo debut In the Night released in 1980. By this point Whitesnake now featured Ian Paice from Deep Purple on drums, who had been brought into the group to replace Dowle. In 1980 this line up released the album Ready an' Willing, which spawned two UK single hits in the form of Fool for your Loving and the album title track; Moody co-wrote both tracks. The band also released the double album Live...in the Heart of the City in that year. He also found time to write and record two singles with Bob Young. In 1981 Graham Bonnet released his album Line-Up which featured Moody playing guitar on all tracks and also featured three songs written by Moody in partnership with Bob Young. Micky maintained a busy schedule with Whitesnake and the band released the album Come an' Get It that year. Relationships within the band were beginning to sour and Moody's guitar partner Bernie Marsden left prior to the final completion of the next album Saints and Sinners. Moody himself followed soon after. The band was put on hold for much of 1982 and Moody undertook some session work, for the likes of Sheena Easton. By late 1982 Whitesnake were back, (with Mel Galley replacing Marsden), and a re-juvinated Moody joining Galley on the album's backing vocal sessions. Going into 1983, Coverdale replaced Ian Paice and Neil Murray with Cozy Powell and Colin Hodgkinson. However Micky was not particularly happy with the direction the new band was taking and felt increasingly sidelined by Coverdale.[5] Despite the deteriorating situation within Whitesnake, Moody persevered with recording the Slide It In album (which he describes as an 'unhappy experience' ) before quitting the band in 1983 at the end of a tour.[1] Moody went back to session work with a series of artists including Mike Oldfield, Gary Glitter, Mike d'Abo, and Roger Chapman as well as selected TV work. He toured with Chris Farlowe and also worked with ex-Meal Ticket singer Willy Finlayson and his band the Hurters. Taking a wry, yet witty view on some of the people and experiences they'd encountered over the years, he got together with Bob Young to write a book on musician's humour, the acclaimed Language Of Rock And Roll. He also put together the first version of the Micky Moody Band featuring ex-Taste bassist Charlie McCracken and drummer Chris Hunt. Towards the end of the decade he and Bernie Marsden played selected venues with the their own Moody Marsden Band.\n\n1990s\n\nDuring the early part of the 1990s, Moody toured extensively with Roger Chapman before re-uniting on a more permanent basis with his erstwhile Whitesnake guitarist-in-crime, Bernie Marsden, to tour and record with the Moody Marsden Band, concentrating mostly on the British and western European markets. Featured in various line-ups were drummers Zak Starkey, Terry Williams, John Trotter, Henry Spinetti and Dave Dowle; bass players Jaz Lochrie, Pete Stroud, Steve Price, Neil Murray and David Levy, and keyboard players Don Ariey and Josh Phillips. Guests in the studio included harmonica player Mark Feltham, keyboard player Volker 'Wolfman' Kunschner, brass players Nick Pentelow, Frank Mead and Martin Drover, and backing singers Monica Reed-Price and Mick Lister. The Moody Marsden Band recorded two live albums, Never Turn Our Back On the Blues and Live In Hell and a studio set, Real Faith. In 1996, Moody toured the USA as part of the Best of British Blues tour which also featured Alvin Lee, Eric Burdon, Aynsley Dunbar, Boz Burrell and Tim Hinkley. The following year, Moody and Marsden teamed up with Norwegian rockers Jorn Lande, Willy Bendickson and Sid Ringsby to form The Snakes, a band that specialised in re-producing the sounds of the original Whitesnake. Don Airey would often be brought in to augment them on keyboards. The band recorded two albums, Once Bitten and Live in Europe before making way for The Company of Snakes, which featured in its line up former Bad Company vocalist Robert Hart, original Whitesnake bass player Neil Murray and ex-Manfred Mann's Earth Band drummer John Lingwood. Hart was eventually replaced by ex-Snakes in Paradise frontman Steffan Berggren, and the band released two albums, Burst the Bubble and a live set, Here They Go Again.\n\n2000s\n\nIn 2000, Micky wrote and produced media music prior to the release of his first official solo album, I Eat Them For Breakfast. Whilst continuing to perform with Company Of Snakes and take on occasional session work, Moody joined his former Juicy Lucy bandmate Paul Williams[6] to arrange and record a selection of classic Chicago blues tracks in a mostly 'unplugged' fashion; the result was Smokestacks, Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men. He also started to play occasional gigs in a duo format with bluesman Papa George, and continues to do so. The next 'Snake' metamorphosis was into M3 Classic Whitesnake, and although ex-Black Sabbath singer Tony Martin was in the starting line-up, Stefan Berggren was soon back in the frontman's spot. M3 released a live CD featuring Martin, and a live DVD featuring Berggren with a guest appearance from former Richie Blackmore and Yngwie Malmsteen frontman Doogie White. Also featured in this line-up were ex-Paul Rodgers Band, Go West and Tears for Fears drummer Jimmy Copley and keyboard player Mark Stanway from Magnum.\n\nAround this time, Moody played on the album Nah Aufnahme by German superstar Westernhagen, which eventually topped the national charts. 2006 saw the release of Moody's self-produced solo album Don't Blame Me in tandem with the autobiographical Playing with Trumpets - A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship, the latter recounting his early days in the music business, mostly in the company of Paul Rodgers. M3 broke up later that year, after which Moody performed more shows with Roger Chapman plus selected dates with a line-up of the Micky Moody Band that featured his eldest son Micky Moody Jr. on drums.

He was also a founder-member of Snafu. Together with his former Whitesnake colleague Bernie Marsden he founded the Moody Marsden Band, and later, The Snakes, having previously collaborated with unofficial 5th Status Quo member Bob Young in Young & Moody. Along with Marsden and ex-Whitesnake bassist, Neil Murray, he formed [the Company of Snakes and M3 Classic Whitesnake with which they mainly performed early Whitesnake songs. More recently, he has toured and recorded with Snakecharmer.\n\nBesides this, Moody has also toured with Roger Chapman, Frankie Miller and Chris Farlowe. He has also performed live alongside the likes of Eric Clapton, Alvin Lee, Mick Taylor, Bruce Dickinson, Sam Brown, Gary Brooker, Suggs, Dennis Locorriere, Paul Jones, P. P. Arnold, James Hunter, Rick Wakeman, Jon Lord, Newton Faulkner, Uriah Heep, Alice Cooper, Mark King, Alfie Boe, Sandi Thom, Brian Auger, Paul Weller, Eric Bibb, Meat Loaf, Boy George, Elkie Brooks, Nona Hendryx, Mud Morganfield and one of his early guitar heroes, Duane Eddy. Since 2000 he has released several solo albums: I Eat Them For Breakfast (2000), Don't Blame Me (2006), Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009). A versatile guitarist, Moody has been an active session musician and his own website lists over 100 albums to which he has contributed musically. 2006 saw the release of the autobiographical Playing With Trumpets \u2013 A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship, a memoir about his early days on the music scene. Another book of memoirs Snakes And Ladders was released in 2016. His library music has been featured on such TV programmes as Waking the Dead, Bo' Selecta!, America's Next Top Model, How to Look Good Naked, Top Gear, Horizon, Jersey Shore, Mad Men, Wife Swap and Paul Hollywood's Bread.\n\n1960s\n\nWhile still at school in Middlesbrough and attending private guitar lessons, Moody formed The Roadrunners with several others from the area including Paul Rodgers (later of Free and Bad Company). They were joined some time later by bass player Bruce Thomas, who moved onto play with Elvis Costello and the Attractions. The band performed a range of covers in local halls and clubs. By 1967 they had developed and outgrown the local music scene and turned professional, changing their name to The Wildflowers and subsequently moving to London. They had some success and undertook some touring, but relationships within the band frayed and they eventually split without making any recordings. Moody returned home to Middlesbrough where for a while he widened his musical horizons by taking classical guitar lessons. He also became increasingly interested in slide guitar techniques (a style he would later be closely associated with). While living in Middlesbrough he was asked by local singer and entrepreneur John McCoy, to form a group which became Tramline. A deal for two albums was signed with Island Records, but by the time the second album was released the band had broken up. Moody joined Lucas and the professional Soul band Mike Cotton Sound who became Gene Pitney's backing band for UK tours as well as others such as Paul Jones.\n\n1970s\n\nIn 1970 he joined the recently re-patriated keyboard player Zoot Money as guitarist. He then replaced Neil Hubbard in Juicy Lucy with whom he recorded three albums and toured extensively before the group disbanded. After the band split, Moody co-founded Snafu which combined his funk-rock guitar style with U.S down-home stateside grooves. The band recorded three albums SNAFU, Situation Normal and All Funked Up. They also appeared on a John Peel The Old Grey Whistle Test session and the T.V series Supersonic. Extensive touring followed before the band broke up. At this time Moody undertook occasional work as a session player most notably for Graham Bonnet. He also contributed to one track on Gerry Rafferty's City to City. He performed with the former Status Quo drummer John Coghlan's Diesel Band, then recorded an album with the band's tour manager and lyricist Bob Young which became Young & Moody. He then toured with Frankie Miller and stood in as a guest with Hinkley's Heroes before joining his friend David Coverdale. Moody had known Coverdale from the local music scene in the Middlesbrough area in the late sixties, upto this time Coverdale had been fronting Deep Purple and was looking to undertake a solo venture. Coverdale invited Moody to work with him and the album White Snake was released in 1977. Moody shared writing credits on four songs including the title track. A second album Northwinds followed in 1978, on which Moody contributed to three songs. Following the demise of Deep Purple MkIV, Coverdale and Moody joined forces with Bernie Marsden, Neil Murray, Dave 'Duck' Dowle and keyboardist Brian Johnston to form a band that took its name Whitesnake from the title of Coverdale's first solo album. In 1978 they recorded the E.P Snakebite followed by two Studio albums, Trouble (1978) and Lovehunter (1979) which were recorded by a modified line up with Jon Lord on keyboards. Moody is credited with co-writing four of the ten tracks on Trouble and was sole writer of Belgian Tom's Hat Trick', an instrumental. While working with Whitesnake he also played slide guitar on Roger Chapman's debut solo album Chappo.\n\n1980s\n\nMoody contributed slide guitar to three tracks on former Lindisfarne member Ray Jackson's solo debut In the Night, which was released in 1980. By this point Whitesnake now featured Ian Paice from Deep Purple on drums, who had been brought into the group to replace Dowle. In 1980 this line up released the album Ready an' Willing, from which two UK singles were taken, Fool for Your Loving and the album title track, both co-written by Moody. The band also released the double album Live...in the Heart of the City in the same year. At his time he recorded two singles with Bob Young, with all tracks written by Moody.\n\nIn 1981 Graham Bonnet released his album Line-Up which featured Moody playing guitar on all tracks and also featured three songs written by Moody in partnership with Bob Young. Moody continued to maintain a busy schedule with Whitesnake and the band released the album Come an' Get Itin the same year. Relationships within the band were beginning to sour and Moody's guitar partner Bernie Marsden left prior to the final completion of the next album Saints and Sinners. Moody himself followed soon after. Whitesnake took time out for much of 1982 and Moody undertook some session work, with Sheena Easton and others. By late 1982 Whitesnake was reformed with Mel Galley replacing Marsden and Moody joining Galley on the album's backing vocal sessions. In 1983 Coverdale replaced Ian Paice and Neil Murray with Cozy Powell and Colin Hodgkinson. Moody was not happy with the direction the new band was taking and felt increasingly sidelined by Coverdale. However, despite the deteriorating situation within Whitesnake, Moody recorded Slide It In with them. A process he described as an 'unhappy experience' and after which he left the band in 1983.\n\nMoody returned to session work with Mike Oldfield, Gary Glitter, Mike d'Abo and Roger Chapman, as well as selected T.V music library work. He toured with Chris Farlowe and also worked with former Meal Ticket singer Willy Finlayson and his band the Hurters. Taking a wry, yet witty view on some of the people and experiences they'd encountered over the years, he got together with Bob Young to write a book on musician's humour, the acclaimed Language of Rock and Roll. He also put together the first version of the Micky Moody Band featuring former Taste bassist Charlie McCracken and drummer Chris Hunt. Towards the end of the decade he and Bernie Marsden played selected venues with their own Moody Marsden Band.\n\n1990s\n\nDuring the early part of the 1990s, Moody toured extensively with Roger Chapman before re-uniting on a more permanent basis with Whitesnake guitarist Bernie Marsden, to tour and record with the Moody Marsden Band in U.K and Europe. The Moody Marsden Band recorded two live albums, Never Turn Our Back on the Blues and Live in Hell and a studio set, Real Faith. In 1996, Moody toured the USA as part of the Best of British Blues tour which also featured Eric Burdon, Alvin Lee, Aynsley Dunbar, Boz Burrell and Tim Hinkley. The following year, Moody and Marsden teamed up with Norwegian rockers Jorn Lande, Willy Bendickson and Sid Ringsby to form The Snakes, a band that specialised in re-producing the sounds of the original Whitesnake. Don Airey would often be brought in to augment them on keyboards. The band recorded two albums, Once Bitten and Live in Europe before making way for The Company of Snakes, which featured in its line up former Bad Company vocalist Robert Hart, original Whitesnake bass player Neil Murray and ex-Manfred Mann's Earth Band drummer John Lingwood. Hart was eventually replaced by ex-Snakes in Paradise frontman Steffan Berggren, and the band released two albums, Burst the Bubble and a live set Here They Go Again.\n\n2000s\n\nIn 2000, Micky wrote and produced library music prior to the release of his first official solo album, I Eat Them For Breakfast. Whilst continuing to perform with Company of Snakes and take on occasional session work, Moody joined his former Juicy Lucy bandmate Paul Williams to arrange and record a selection of acoustic classic Chicago blues tracks for the album Smokestacks, Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men. He also started to play occasional duo gigs with bluesman Papa George. 'Snake' metamorphosed into M3 Classic Whitesnake and also released released a live CD featuring Martin and a live DVD featuring Berggren with a guest appearance from former Ritchie Blackmore and Yngwie Malmsteen frontman Doogie White. Also featured in this line-up were Go West and Tears for Fears drummer Jimmy Copley and keyboard player Mark Stanway from Magnum.\n\nAround this time Moody played on the album Nah Aufnahme by German musician Westernhagen, which eventually appeared in thethe national charts. 2006 saw the release of Moody's self-produced solo album Don't Blame Me which was released at the same time as publication of his autobiographical memoirsPlaying with Trumpets \u2013 A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship. M3 broke up later that year, after which Moody performed more shows with Roger Chapman plus selected dates with a line-up of the Micky Moody Band that featured his eldest son Micky Moody Jr. on drums. In 2008 he toured Japan as special guest of Jimmy Copley and Japanese guitar legend Char. Also featured was ex-Herbie Hancock bassist Paul Jackson and keyboard wizard Yoshinobu Kojima. The shows were recorded and released on DVD as Jimmy Copley & Char: Special Session. To celebrate his love of instrumental music, Micky wrote and produced the albums Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009).\n\n2010s\n\nIn 2011, Moody co-wrote library music for both Warner/Chapell and Universal before co-forming Snakecharmer, a line up which also includes former Whitesnake colleague Neil Murray and Adam Wakeman. He also made regular appearances alongside blues guitarist Papa George and has been an active member of the Sunflower Jam house band and the Bad Apples.\n\nWith Tramline\n\n1968 Somewhere Down The Line\n\n1969 Moves of Vegetable Centuries\n\nWith Juicy Lucy\n\n1970 Lie Back and Enjoy It\n\n1971 Get a Whiff a This\n\n1972 Pieces\n\nWith Snafu\n\n1973 Snafu\n\n1974 Situation Normal\n\n1975 All Funked Up\n\nWith The Moody Marsden Band\n\n1992 Never Turn Our Back on the Blues\n\n1994 live in Hell\n\n1994 The Time Is Right For Live\n\n1994 Real Faith\n\n2000 The Night the Guitars Came to Play\n\n2001 Ozone Friendly\n\nWith Bob Young\n\n1977 Young and Moody\n\n1995 The Nearest Hits Album\n\n2010 Back for the Last Time Again\n\nWith David Coverdale\n\n1977 White Snake\n\n1978 Northwinds\n\n2003 The Early Years\n\nWith Whitesnake\n\n1978 Snakebite\n\n1978 Trouble\n\n1978 Live at Hammersmith\n\n1979 Lovehunter\n\n1980 Ready an' Willing\n\n1980 Live...in the Heart of the City\n\n1982 Saints & Sinners\n\n1984 Slide It In (UK version)\n\n1994 Greatest Hits\n\n2003 Best of Whitesnake\n\n2003 The Silver Anniversary Collection\n\n2004 The Early Years\n\n2008 30th Anniversary Collection\n\n2011 Box of Snakes\n\nWith The Snakes, Company of Snakes & M3\n\n1998 Once Bitten (Japan)\n\n1998 Live in Europe\n\n2001 Here They Go Again\n\n2002 Burst the Bubble\n\n2005 Classic Snake Live\n\n2005 Rough An' Ready (live album, CD)\n\n2007 Rough An' Ready (live album, DVD)\n\nWith Snakecharmer\n\n2013 Snakecharmer\n\n2017 Second Skin\n\nWith The Bad Apples\n\n2014 Played\n\nWith Ali Maas\n\n2016 Black & Chrome\n\nSolo\n\n2000 I Eat Them for Breakfast\n\n2002 Smokestacks Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men (with Paul Williams)\n\n2006 Don't Blame Me\n\n2007 Acoustic Journeyman\n\n2008 Live and Rocking! \u2013 Live at the Hell Blues Festival 2000 (Micky Moody & Friends)\n\n2009 Electric Journeyman\n\n2016 Black & Chrome (with Ali Maas)\n\nGuest appearances\n\n1969 You Can All Join In (VA)\n\n1970 Zoot Money (Zoot Money)\n\n1973 In Memory of Robert Johnson (Paul Williams)\n\n1973 I Never Got (Tony Kelly)\n\n1973 Manor Live (VA)\n\n1973 Me and My Friend (Patrick Campbell Lyons)\n\n1974 Funkist (Bobby Harrison)\n\n1975 Squire (Alan Hull)\n\n1975 Legend (Mickey Jupp)\n\n1977 Graham Bonnet (Graham Bonnet)\n\n1977 Fancy That (Joanna Carlin)\n\n1977 City to City (Gerry Rafferty)\n\n1979 Chappo (Roger Chapman)\n\n1981 Line Up (Graham Bonnet)\n\n1982 Riff Burglars (Roger Chapman)\n\n1982 Madness, Money & Music (Sheena Easton)\n\n1986 In Quo Country (Bob Young)\n\n1987 Islands (Mike Oldfield)\n\n1987 Party Album (Gary Glitter)\n\n1987 Reaching Out (Paul Millns)\n\n1987 Indestructible (Mike D'Abo)\n\n1987 No Angel (Sanne Salomonsen)\n\n1988 New Day (Jane Harrison)\n\n1989 Walking The Cat (Roger Chapman)\n\n1990 Hybrid and Lowdown (Roger Chapman)\n\n1991 Blue-Eyed Slide (Brian Knight)\n\n1992 Parlour Games (John Spencer)\n\n1992 Blues Brittania (VA)\n\n1992 Waiting in the Wings (Chris Farlowe)\n\n1992 Very Much Alive (Willy Finlayson and The Hurters)\n\n1993 Midnight Postcards (Adam Faith)\n\n1994 Tellin' Stories (Walter Trout)\n\n1994 Line Up (Borderline)\n\n1995 Together (Peter Smith)\n\n1995 Green and Blues (Bernie Marsden)\n\n1996 Kiss My Soul (Roger Chapman)\n\n1996 Blue Thunder (Blue Thunder)\n\n1998 Pinboard Wizards (Jackie Lynton)\n\n2000 Here After (Jamie Marshall)\n\n2000 Gimme All Your Topp (VA)\n\n2000 Snakebites (VA)\n\n2000 Glory Bound (Chris Farlowe)\n\n2001 Another Hair of the Dog (VA)\n\n2001 Tam de ti ye...

Recorded live at The Paris Theatre in London by BBC Radio 1 for the In Concert series on April 3, 1974.\n\nIn 1972, vocalist and drummer Bobby Harrison had just left blues-rock outfit Freedom and started to record his first solo LP, \u2018Funkist\u2019. Featured on this album was Micky Moody, then lead guitarist with the ailing Juicy Lucy. The collaboration between the two was so successful, that after the demise of Juicy Lucy they decided to form a completely new group and play American-inspired funk and R&B-flavored rock.\n\nBobby Harrison had a background of playing with Procol Harum, and participated in the recording of their all-time classic, \u201cA Whiter Shade of Pale\u201d. Soon after, however, Harrison was told to leave the band due to \u2018internal differences\u2019. After Procol Harum, Bobby Harrison formed Freedom, whose first line-up recorded a couple of singles and a soundtrack for an Italian film. Commercial success sadly eluded them and Freedom disbanded in 1972. After that, Bobby would occasionally gig with Juicy Lucy where he became friends with guitarist Micky Moody.\n\nBobby Harrison and Micky Moody started writing together and auditioning new band members. They found former Tramline drummer Terry Popple (previously with Van Morrison), bass player Colin Gibson (formerly of Ginger Baker\u2019s Airforce) and keyboard /fiddle player Pete Solley (later in Whitesnake). Gibson suggested the name Snafu, a term he lifted from a Captain Beefheart song \u201cBig Eyed Beans From Venus\u201d on their 1972 album, Clear Spot. The musical influences were mainly American, and came from bands such as The Allman Brothers Band and in particular Little Feat, one of Bobby Harrison\u2019s favorite bands.\n\nSnafu are notable for combining the British rhythm and blues tradition with U.S inspired elements of funk and country music. Moody\u2019s distinctive guitar playing, often with slide, provided the band with a distinctive hard-edged R&B sound, particularly on such numbers as \u201cLock and Key\u201d and \u201cHard To Handle\u201d.\n\nIf you missed them the first time around, here\u2019s a chance to get caught up via their concert appearance from 1974.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiked it?

Micky quickly graduated to the recording studios via the R&B combo Tramline before touring Britain and Europe with some of the countrys top soul musicians.\n\nJoining the highly acclaimed Juicy Lucy was a large step towards rock stardom, and major tours of Britain, Europe and the USA accompanied a regular output of recorded works. After Juicy Lucy split, Micky co-founded Snafu, combining his rock-style guitar with down-home stateside grooves, and became a major contributor on the song-writing front. Snafu recorded three albums and toured extensively before the individual members headed off to pursue their different ventures. Micky then became engrossed in session work as his reputation as a versatile performer spread. Soon a phone call from David Coverdale assured Micky of a vital place in his future plans, starting with the guitar slot and co-writing position on his forthcoming solo albums, Whitesnake and Northwinds.\n\n\n\nAs a sideman, Micky has featured alongside such classic British singers as Graham Bonnet, Frankie Miller, Chris Farlowe, Sheena Easton, Roger Chapman, Elkie Brookes and Eric Burdon. Visitors from the states such as Meat Loaf, Matt guitar Murphy, Ben E. King and Walter Trout have all employed his talents to enhance their performances.\n\nMicky's session work has included many T.V. commercials and some film scores. As a writer or co-writer his credits are numerous and include many of the classic Whitesnake favourites. With the Moody Marsden band, he and his guitar sparring partner Bernie Marsden toured extensively and released four albums before continuing their Whitesnake legacy with the Snakes and the Company of Snakes.\n\nIn 2000 Micky finally released his first solo album I Eat Them For Breakfast on Armadillo records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview by Michael Limnios\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat was the first gig you ever went to & what were the first songs you learned?\n\nAs a child I was taken by my parents to a Christmas pantomime where the special guests were Cliff Richard and the Shadows. I was aware of their music and, like a lot of youngsters who took up the guitar in the early 1960's, I was especially drawn to the playing of Hank Marvin. I went to private guitar lessons from the age of twelve, so the first tunes I learned to play where from guitar tutor books.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich was the best moment of your career and which was the worst?\n\nGetting my first gold album (Ready an'Willing - Whitesnake) was a great moment. Playing onstage with Eric Clapton was also special.\n\nThe worst was performing with Snafu at the huge Roosevelt Stadium in New Jersey supporting Emerson Lake & Palmer. It was the ugliest drink and drug-sodden atmosphere I have ever experienced. We should never have supported ELP, this was not our audience and our management were to blame. We had to leave the stage because of the abuse, and also to avoid the missiles that were thrown at us from a truly dystopian gathering.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you learn about yourself from music? What experiences in your life make you a GOOD musician?\n\nI believe the special 'something' that differentiates a good musician from a not-so-good musician is natural ability; you either have it or you don't. Practice, dedication, experience and inventiveness helps too!\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom whom have you have learned the most secrets about blues rock music & in which songs can someone hear the best of your work?\n\nI loved the Jeff Beck Group with Rod Stewart on vocals. They could take blues and soul songs and heavy them up, and some of their originals songs sounded very inspired. Beck played like nobody else, and still does. I'm also a fan of American guitarist Harvey Mandel, especially the stuff he did in the late 6o's-early 70's and, of course, Eric Clapton in Cream. Blues rock slide? Early Johnny Winter; Duane Allman; Lowell George; Ry Cooder; Zoot Horn Rollo; Sonny Landreth, and Glenn Ross Campbell's steel playing.\n\nI think I improved with age! Some of my best playing is on my solo albums 'I Eat Them For Breakfast' and 'Don't Blame Me'. I was more in control of my own destiny on those albums.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat characterizes your \u201cphilosophy\u201d about the music?\n\nI've always been fascinated by the number of different styles of music that you can coax from the guitar. I'm known primarily as an electric guitarist but I have always loved the natural sound of acoustic music. I've discovered a lot of open tunings throughout the years, and different types of right-hand picking techniques from pick and fingers, thumpick and fingers and flesh (no picks at all). In the last few years I have written and produced two instrumental albums: 'Acoustic Journeyman' and 'Electric Journeyman'. Although I've been involved in a lot of song writing over the years, playing the guitar is still my main passion. People sometimes ask me what is my favourite kind of music, and my answer is always \"Good music!\" If possible, always play the kind of music that stimulates your emotions, and try to keep an open mind.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy did you think that Micky Moody, continues to generate such a devoted following?\n\nI don't know if I have a devoted following! Maybe people appreciate that I've never been afraid to attempt different styles and that I try to express a range of emotions when I play.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the \u201cthing\u201d you miss most from the Tramline? Which memory from the Wildflowers makes you smile?\n\nTramline: I was only seventeen at the time, in great health with my whole life ahead of me. Yes, I miss that feeling! The Wildflowers: Traveling to London with the other three guys in an old van fitted-out with bunk beds; we were so dedicated!\n\n\n\n\n\nTell me about the beginning of Juicy Lucy. How did you get together and where did it start?\n\nJuicy Lucy's Singer Paul Williams had seen me perform in Tramline, Lucas and the Mike Cotton Sound and Zoot Money's band. He must have been impressed because when Neil Hubbard left Juicy Lucy to join the Grease Band he suggested me to the other guys. They were rehearsing at a house in the countryside so I went and rehearsed with them and got the job.\n\n\"I believe the special 'something' that differentiates a good musician from a not-so-good musician is natural ability; you either have it or you don't. Practice, dedication, experience and inventiveness helps too!\"\n\nWhat are some of the most memorable stories you've had from Juice Lucy?\n\nSoon after I joined Juicy Lucy we flew to the United States for a tour which lasted for nearly a month. It was my first time in America and suddenly I was looking at things and visiting places I'd only seen on television. New York: we played at the legendary Fillmore East supporting Cactus and Lee Michaels; visited Atlantic's famous recording studio where Roberts Flack was recording with some of the greatest session musicians in the US (including the great Bernard 'Pretty' Purdie on drums). The Fillmore West, San Francisco where we supported Elton John and The Kinks, and looking out on a warm November day at Alcatraz Prison and the San Francisco Bay. Los Angeles: two or three nights at the Whiskey A Go- Go, staying at the Tropicana Hotel - Californian groupies! Boston: two nights at the Boston Tea Party supporting Leon Russell and Elvin Bishop - both had great bands. Went to Chicago and Madison WN too.\n\nLots of touring, especially in Germany, and taking over as lead guitarist when members from the original line-up quit. It was all great experience!\n\n\n\n\n\nAny comments about your experiences with Chris Farlowe, Roger Chapman & Bernie Marsden? Would you like to tell your best memory about them?\n\nI was aware of Chris and Roger from my teens back in the north of England. Chris Farlowe and the Thunderbirds featured Albert Lee on guitar which was a real bonus for us guitar players. Tramline supported Family on a club date so I got see them live; Roger singing in that unusual fashion over very original-sounding songs. So it's been a thrill to actually work with them. Other great singers I've worked on stage with include Frankie Miller, Graham Bonnet, Gary Brooker, , Paul Rodgers in the Roadrunners/Wildflowers and David Coverdale in Whitesnake. Bernie and I developed a special understanding as dual guitarists, firstly with Whitesnake, then with the Moody Marsden Band. It had very little to do with Wishbone Ash or Thin Lizzie, and was influenced by the 60's British Blues players and American Southern Rockers like the Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd.\n\nWould you mind telling me your most vivid memory from Snafu?\n\nSee above! On a more positive note, recording the first album at the Manor Studios. We had a nice, tight funky thing going on in the early days.\n\n\"People sometimes ask me what is my favourite kind of music, and my answer is always \"Good music!\" If possible, always play the kind of music that stimulates your emotions, and try to keep an open mind.\"\n\nDo you remember anything interesting stories from Whitesnake?\n\nI have an incredible amount of interesting stories from my days with Whitesnake. How many weeks do you have to listen to them?!! It's impossible to pick out a few as there were so many. I had some of the best times of my life - it was the 70s, totally politically-incorrect, sexy and indulgent. That's all I'm saying!\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did you first meet John Mayall, do you remember anything interesting from touring with him?\n\nI was still in London after the breakup of the Wildflowers (1967) and Bruce Thomas, the bass player, discovered where John Mayall lived. Although I'd already decided that I would move back to my home town and spend some time studying the classical guitar, Bruce wanted to progress in the blues scene. We took the tube train to Paddington Station and walked a few blocks to Mayall's flat, which was at the top of a house close to the station. He had no idea who we were but was kind enough to invite us up to his flat, where his new guitarist Mick Taylor sat listening to blues albums. Bruce gave him his number for future reference and we had a nice cup of tea!\n\nI met him again the following year when Tramline supported his 'Crusade' band at the Marquee Club in London. In the spring of 1970, when I was playing with Zoot Money, we supported him and his drummer-less band on a number of shows on his British tour. His line-up was very odd: Jon Mark on nylon-strung guitar; Johnny Almond on Saxophones and Alex Dmochowski on bass. He seemed like quite a private, laid-back person.\n\n\"Being in a position to enjoy playing the guitar professionally, working with hundreds of talented people, writing songs and instrumentals pieces, and being able to afford good instruments.\"\n\nHow has the music business changed over the years since you first started in music?\n\nI was very lucky to have started my career in the Sixties and to have developed it in the Seventies. There was very little in the way of entertainment for the masses apart from music, TV (very limited those days) and film, and most people went to gigs and bought records. The opportunities were immense, unlike today were the public have so much choice, most of it available through the internet or multimedia. Recorded works and live performances were treated with respect and giving things for free, or worse, having them pirated, was rarely an option. I also think that, in some regards, technology has made the art of creating and performing music too accessible and instantaneous. If utilized correctly technology can be put to good use, but practice and dedication to one's instrument will always produce the better musician.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do you think that the blues doesn\u2019t quite get the recognition and respect that other genres seem to get? Give one wish for the BLUES\n\nI'm not sure I agree with your opinion! I think that after pop and rock, blues is one of the most accepted forms of music to be embraced by a wide audience. Long may the Blues continue!\n\n\"I would give more thought to the business side of things; there are a lot of smiling assassins out there who have no second thoughts about taking things that do not belong to them - usually money.\"\n\nWith such an illustrious career, what has given you the most satisfaction musically?\n\nBeing in a position to enjoy playing the guitar professionally, working with hundreds of talented people, writing songs and instrumentals pieces, and being able to afford good instruments.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference and similarity between the LIVE/GIG and the STUDIO feeling? And between your session projects, solo albums and the band\u2019s recording?\n\nThere's obviously a big difference between playing live and playing in a recording studio; some people excel in one and struggle with the other. I think that for most people, playing live is their raison d'etre, whilst the recording studio is a workshop within which you can create. I've been lucky enough to have had a lot of experience in both, some experiences turning out better than others. Playing live, there is (hopefully) an atmosphere created by both performers and audience, whereas you have to create an atmosphere in a studio - and concentrate - you have to live with the results!\n\nI'm in control of my own projects so I'm responsible for the outcome. On sessions you have to try and make the artist/producer comfortable and pleased with your efforts. I'm involved in a new band called Snakecharmer and we're all very experienced - watch out for us!\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there any memories from the US tour \u201cBest of British Blues\u201d, which you\u2019d like to share with us?\n\nUnfortunately the 'Best of British Blues' tour of 1996 was memorable for the wrong reasons. The line-up consisted of featured artists Eric Burdon and Alvin Lee, and the band was Aynsley Dunbar, Boz Burrell, Tim Hinkley and myself. I don't like to talk ill of the dead, but Boz created problems right from the first gig; he was unhappy with the promoter and seemed uncomfortable with the personnel. Halfway through the tour he went to pieces and couldn't continue, so Aynsley suggested Tony Franklin who'd played with bass with The Firm (Paul Rodgers/Jimmy Page). The band then seemed to split into two camps: Burdon, Dunbar and Franklin, and Lee, Hinkley and Moody. Eric Burdon thought that his guitarist should come to the House of Blues in L.A. and perform on stage with us just to show me how it should be done! What a fucking insult! Alvin sensed the vibes and a couple of gigs later he booked a plane home. We didn't even finish the tour. There were some good moments, but overall, definitely one to forget!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you go back to the past what things you would do better and what things you would avoid to do again?\n\nI would give more thought to the business side of things; there are a lot of smiling assassins out there who have no second thoughts about taking things that do not belong to them - usually money.\n\n\n\nMicky Moody - Official website\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.seaoftranquility.org/reviews.php?op=showcontent&id=20204", "page_content": "\n\n\n\n\n\nSNAFU: Live Nottingham 1976\n\nFresh from a solo album featuring the likes of Tony Iommi, Ian Paice and Herby Flowers, ex-Freedom singer Bobby Harrison formed the band SNAFU, bringing with him Juicy Lucy guitarist Micky Moody, who had also performed on the frontman's solo outing, Funkist. The pair bonded on and off stage and alongside one-time Procol Harum man Pete Solley (keys), Colin Gibson (bass) and drummer Terry Popple, recorded a self titled debut in 1973 and the Situation Normal follow up just one year later. The band's third album, 1975's All Funked Up, would see Brian Chatton handle keyboards in place of Solley, while Tim Hinkley added some piano. However by 1976 Hinkley was the band's full time keyboard player as SNAFU headed to Trent Polytechnic in Nottingham, where along with others, John Moon would record the show for Radio Trent. As he did many an act over the years, such as Thin Lizzy, Gerry Rafferty and Rory Gallagher. Fast forward to 1992 and Moon would sadly be made redundant from the radio station, when he, rather unusually, had the Radio Trent archive assigned over to him, saving 120 recorded concerts from being simply discarded in the process. That SNAFU show from 1976 was one of the many saved and now the six song set is presented here by Angel Air Records. With Harrison contributing to the interesting Jeff Perkins penned liner notes, it makes an involving bookend for a band who were over long before they really should have been. Moody tempted off to join David Coverdale's Whitesnake, the young guitarist making the understandable decision to throw his axe skills in with the ex-Deep Purple man as he forged ahead with his new group. SNAFU recruited Colloseum six stringer Clem Clempson, but with Harrison struggling to see a future for his band without Moody, things never worked out and SNAFU folded. Here three band originals, \"Long Gone\", \"Unsettled Dust\" and \"Highway\" compete keenly for attention with three covers, the band's deep, funky, bluesy style arguably ahead of its time. Harrison proves to have the perfect voice to nail the groove expertly into place, while it will come as no shock that Moody's fretwork possesses a real warmth and fluidity, even if this, understandably, is hardly a hi-tech recording. Once the band ended, Harrison turned his attention towards forming a new outfit, Niagra. Short lived, they would only record four tracks together for Tommy Vance's radio show, which are added here as bonuses. With the only source available being an old cassette recording, there's no denying this is scratchy stuff, and yet with a more commercially aware hard rock sound, \"Crossfire\" and \"Cold Eyes\" still suggest Niagra shouldn't have fallen as readily as their name suggested. However, they did, Harrison eventually moving to Iceland to take a break from the music business. If you're Bobby Harrison, Micky Moody or SNAFU completist, then Live In Nottingham 1976 will prove a vital addition to your collection. For anyone else there's undoubtedly a great hard blues rock act here to be discovered, although I'd suggest catching up with their studio output first.

Along with Juicy Lucy guitarist Micky Moody, he formed Snafu, a band that combined rock, funk, soul, and jazz for a sound that would later appear to be quite ahead of the times by many. They proceeded to record three albums from 1973-1975, but then broke up a few years after when the band failed to really catch on, and Moody was snatched up by David Coverdale for his new group Whitesnake. Live in Nottingham 1976 is a live recording from late in the bands career, and features Harrison & Moody alongside Tim Hinkley (keyboards), Colin Gibson (bass), and Terry Popple (drums). The album features a selection of band originals and some cover tunes, and while the recording isn't the greatest, it's still a fun document of an underrated band doing their thing live on stage. Snafu's mix of rock, funk and jazz is actually quite charming, Moody firing off some bluesy guitar licks over tight grooves and airy keyboards on \"Big Legged Woman\" and \"Long Gone\", while the bluesy \"Every Little Bit Hurts\" contains a fiery guitar solo and emotional vocal from Harrison. The uptempo \"Unsettled Dust\" has a strong Allman Brothers/Little Feat feel to it, and the band even cover the Allman's staple \"Don't Keep Me Wondering\", doing a fine job in the process. Moody gets his showcase on \"Highway\", a rousing blues rocker with no shortage of fiery guitar work that displays just why he was high on Coverdale's wish list for his then new band Whitesnake.\n\n\n\nThis Angel Air release also contains four bonus live radio tracks from 1977, when Harrison morphed Snafu into Niagra. Though the recordings are of even lesser quality than the Nottingham songs, you can hear Harrison's vision continue on, and the compositions are actually quite good, especially \"Cold Eyes\" and the atmospheric \"Don't Be a Fool\". Overall, this is an intriguing live document from the folks at Angel Air, and well worth a listen for all you Bobby Harrison and Micky Moody fans out there.\n\n"}, {"url": "http://alexgitlin.com/npp/snafu.htm", "page_content": "Week of March 12, 2000\n\nSnafu\n\nIn 1972, vocalist/drummer Bobby Harrison had just left blues-rock outfit Freedom and started to record his first solo LP, 'Funkist'. Among the many first-class musicians featured on this album was Micky Moody, then lead guitarist with Juicy Lucy. The collaboration between the two was so successful that they decided to form a completely new group and play American-inspired funk and R&B-flavoured rock.\n\nThis was the birth of Snafu, one of the finest and most soulful British acts of the mid-seventies. Bobby Harrison had a background of playing with Procol Harum, which he had joined as the last moment in the Spring of 1967, just before entering the studio to participate in the recording of their all-time classic, \"A Whiter Shade Of Pale\". The single, of course, became an overnight success, but soon after Harrison, along with the group's guitarist, was told to leave the band due to 'internal differences'.\n\n\n\nIt was a great shame that this unfortunate episode should become Bobby Harrison's biggest 'claim to fame', as he is certainly a most capable singer/songwriter/musician with an intriguing pedigree. Already a seasoned musician long before joining Procol Harum, he had been with legendary Southend group The Rockefellas since the late fifties, following which he became a member of several other outfits including Golden Apples Of The Sun (who released a single, 'Monkey Time ', for the Immediate label in 1965) and Powerpack (who did two singles for CBS in 1966 and 1967). He even sat in with the pre-Procol band, the Paramounts, on a few occasions and there are also rumours of a solo single, \"Sunny\", recorded for CBS in 1965 or 1966.\n\n\n\nAfter Procol Harum, Bobby Harrison formed Freedom, whose first line-up recorded a couple of singles and a soundtrack for an Italian film. However, as musical fashions started to change from psychedelia to heavy blues-rock, Bobby sacked the other group members and instead hired guitarist Roger Saunders and bass player Walter Monagham. This line-up recorded several albums as they soldiered on into the early seventies. Their newly found style, which they mastered to a tee, naturally won them a faithful live following, as did their impressive three-part harmony vocal work. However, commercial success on a larger scale sadly eluded them, and, disillusioned and disappointed, Freedom finally threw in the towel in 1972.\n\nFor a while Bobby's career seemed to go in the solo direction. In the meantime, he would occasionally gig with the aforementioned Juicy Lucy, after their original lead singer Paul Williams had left the group. In fact, this was where Bobby first became friends with guitarist Micky Moody.\n\n\n\nBorn in 1950 into a Northern working-class family, Micky Moody from an early age became infatuated with the sound of the electric guitar. His family had no particular musical background, but spotting his son's interests, Micky's father bought him a cheap guitar and provided him with tuition. Later - when Micky had formed his first band at school - his father even managed to get him his first gigs at the local Working Men's club. This band, incidentally, was called The Roadrunners and featured on bass and vocals one of Micky's classmates from school, a certain Paul Rodgers who would later become the lead singer of the much-acclaimed Free.\n\n\n\nAs the band started to get good - as one can easily imagine they would - they decided to go down to London and try their luck. Paul Rodgers wanted to concentrate more on his singing, so another bass player from the Middlesbrough area was drafted, Bruce Thomas (later of Quiver and Elvis Costello's Attractions). The year was 1967, the 'Summer of Love', and the group appropriately changed their name to The Wildflowers.\n\n\n\n\"We only did one recording,\" Micky Moody remembers. \"We put four of our own songs down on a 1/4-inch reel-to-reel. The guy who recorded it for us was Paul Kossoff, who of course later became the lead guitarist in Free. I dug out the tape some time ago to give it a listen, but unfortunately it had completely disintegrated.\"\n\n\n\nAfter starving in London for three months, The Wildflowers decided to call it a day. The group disbanded, and Micky went back to Middlesbrough to study classical guitar. Fortunately, he soon joined a local band called Tramline, who released two albums on Island Records. Then he once again decided to try his luck in London, this time as a member of The Mike Cotton Sound. The group backed singers such as Lucas, Gene Pitney, and Zoot Money. In July 1970, Moody was invited to join Juicy Lucy, with whom he stayed for three albums until Snafu was formed in October/November 1972.\n\n\n\nWhen Freedom split, Bobby Harrison had decided to give up playing drums and instead put all his creative energy into being a lead singer, songwriter and frontman. He and Micky Moody started writing together and auditioning new band members. They found former Tramline drummer Terry Popple (later previously with Van Morrison), bass player Colin Gibson (a former member of Ginger Baker's Airforce) and keyboard wizard/fiddle player Pete Solley (ex-Paladin, later in Whitesnake). Gibson suggested the name Snafu, a term he lifted from a Captain Beefheart LP. In fact, it is an unofficial military abbreviation for the ironic phrase, 'Situation Normal All Fucked Up'. The line-up proved to be a minor musical miracle and was from the beginning destined to become a musician's and a critic's band. The musical influences were mainly American and came from bands like The Allman Brothers and in particular Little Feat, whom Bobby Harrison still describes as \"one of my all-time favourite bands'. However, it would be a big mistake to write off the group as just carbon-copiers of early seventies US rock. Perhaps that was what they set out to be, but as it is often the case, something very special happened when this bunch of Englishmen mixed their own musical genes with influences from the other side of the Atlantic.\n\n\n\nIt's a story as old as The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, this strange bastard mixture, like a musical fish burger, which has managed to conquer the world over the last thirty-five years and change not only the face of popular music but also the lives of most people in the entire Western hemisphere. By the early 1970's, however, British rock seemed to have forgotten the recipe except for a few enthusiasts on the underground scene. These were the 'Bewilderment Years' dominated by overblown symphonic rock, pubescent glam rock, and weedy middle-aged popsters whose wildest escapades amounted to tying yellow ribbons around oak trees as old as themselves.\n\n\n\nThere were exceptions. Some small-time entrepreneur by the name of Richard Branson had built a studio called The Manor and started recording a long composition by an unknown guitarist, Mike Oldfield. Apparently, Branson was also impressed with the efforts of Snafu, who arrived at The Manor to record their first LP. In fact, Mike Oldfield was working on 'Tubular Bells' while Snafu were there (Pete Solley actually played briefly on the recording).\n\nFrom the band's first, eponymously titled, LP, the Moody/Harrison composition, 'Long Gone', was released as a single. Both the album and the 7' single received good reviews but were less successful commercially. It didn't seem to bother Micky much: \"I was very much against being commercial in any way at the time,\" he recalls. \"I was happy with Snafu being a bit of an underground act with a cult following.\" Harrison, however, had ambitions on a different level. Perhaps his past as a member of Procol Harum made him more eager to reach for the sky. \"I really wanted us to sell a lot of records,\" he states. \"I wanted us to have that big hit single. It never happened, and to me that was one of the main reasons why the band had to throw in the towel at the end.\"\n\n\n\nHowever, at the time when 'Snafu' was released, everything looked rosy. The group started out on a tour to promote the album. They toured Europe with The Doobie Brothers, and the U.S. with The Eagles.\n\n\n\nOn the second LP, \"Situation Normal\", Pete Solley had taken over much of the control of the band. There is a strong country-rock influence on this album, which makes you either hate or love it. Personally, I can't get enough of it and Pete's keyboard/fiddle playing on the LP is equally wonderful. At the same time, Micky Moody was exploring music by the likes of Ry Cooder and getting more and more into playing slide guitar. Harrison's vocal work is sublime and the rhythm section is both tight and soulful. This is an album that should have made most fellow British rock acts at the time blush with embarrassment. Surprisingly, it was not as well reviewed as its predecessor and, in retrospect, it is easy to see that Snafu had already embarked on a steady downhill journey.\n\n\n\n\"Once again we toured America to promote,\" Micky recalls. \"But they had put us on as a support act for Emerson Lake & Palmer, which was a total mistake. We had a completely different audience to them.\" The band also toured Europe with War and did a lot of TV and radio appearances.\n\nSnafu's third LP, \"All Funked up\", has long been seen as their 'great lost album'. Highly elusive in its original vinyl format, it is now presented by Angel Air for the first time on compact disc. By the time the group came around to recording the LP, Pete Solley had left to join Procol Harum. He was replaced first by Brian Chatton (previously with John Miles) and later by Tim Hinkley, who was a much-used session player at the time. They both play an the album, which again was recorded at The Manor.\n\n\n\nShortly after, the general feeling of disillusionment and loss of direction which dominated the established British rock scene in the mid-seventies finally caught up with Snafu as well. During a tour of Germany, Moody was invited to join David Coverdale. He accepted. Moody played guitar on Coverdale's two solo LPs and then took part in the formation of Whitesnake. Playing on all of Whitesnake's records throughout the late seventies and early eighties, he also wrote or co-wrote hits such as \"Slow An' Easy\" and \"Fool For Your Lovin'\". He furthermore played on Graham Bonnet's hit, \"Night Games\".\n\n\n\nMoody's immense talent and versatility also made him a much-in-demand session player around this time. The post-Whitesnake eighties turned out to be his least favourite time musically, but he is currently active again, touring and recording with The Snakes, featuring fellow Whitesnake guitarist Bernie Marsden (with whom he also tours and records occasionally as The Moody-Marsden Band).\n\n\n\nBobby tried to keep Snafu together for a while with Clem Clempson (Colosseum, Humble Pie, Champion) on guitar, but it didn't work. \"I then started hanging out with people like Reg Isadore, the drummer who had been with Robin Trower and Joe Jammer. We had a band together and lived in Chicago for a couple of years. Unfortunately, our manager died and the whole thing just ended in disaster. But then I met this Icelandic girl whom I made pregnant, moved to Reykjavik with her and began a whole new chapter of my life.\"\n\nHere he teamed up with local supergroup Mezzoforte with whom he recorded the wonderful \"Solid Silver\" album in 1987, a strong collection of R&B classics displaying his immense abilities as a singer. Today, Bobby Harrison finds himself back in Southend again. \"At the end, I discovered I had this yearning for my roots, and I'd done everything I could do in Iceland anyway. So I'm involving myself with a number of different projects here at the moment. I'm preparing for a new album, writing with Gus Isadore, and playing in a duo with a young guitarist from around these parts, Andy Rowlons. I tried to reform Snafu with a group of local musicians but found it was impossible, at least for me.

Recorded live at The Paris Theatre in London by BBC Radio 1 for the In Concert series on April 3, 1974.\n\n\n\nIn 1972, vocalist and drummer Bobby Harrison had just left blues-rock outfit Freedom and started to record his first solo LP, \u2018Funkist\u2019. Featured on this album was Micky Moody, then lead guitarist with the ailing Juicy Lucy. The collaboration between the two was so successful, that after the demise of Juicy Lucy they decided to form a completely new group and play American-inspired funk and R&B-flavored rock.\n\n\n\nBobby Harrison had a background of playing with Procol Harum, and participated in the recording of their all-time classic, \u201cA Whiter Shade of Pale\u201d. Soon after, however, Harrison was told to leave the band due to \u2018internal differences\u2019. After Procol Harum, Bobby Harrison formed Freedom, whose first line-up recorded a couple of singles and a soundtrack for an Italian film. Commercial success sadly eluded them and Freedom disbanded in 1972. After that, Bobby would occasionally gig with Juicy Lucy where he became friends with guitarist Micky Moody.\n\n\n\nBobby Harrison and Micky Moody started writing together and auditioning new band members. They found former Tramline drummer Terry Popple (previously with Van Morrison), bass player Colin Gibson (formerly of Ginger Baker\u2019s Airforce) and keyboard /fiddle player Pete Solley (later in Whitesnake). Gibson suggested the name Snafu, a term he lifted from a Captain Beefheart song \u201cBig Eyed Beans From Venus\u201d on their 1972 album, Clear Spot. The musical influences were mainly American, and came from bands such as The Allman Brothers Band and in particular Little Feat, one of Bobby Harrison\u2019s favorite bands.\n\n\n\nSnafu are notable for combining the British rhythm and blues tradition with U.S inspired elements of funk and country music. Moody\u2019s distinctive guitar playing, often with slide, provided the band with a distinctive hard-edged R&B sound, particularly on such numbers as \u201cLock and Key\u201d and \u201cHard To Handle\u201d.\n\n\n\nIf you missed them the first time around, here\u2019s a chance to get caught up via their concert appearance from 1974."}, {"url": "https://www.allmusic.com/artist/snafu-mn0000034469/songs", "page_content": "Song Highlights Snafu Follow Artist +\n\nSnafu was formed in 1973 by former Procol Harum and Freedom vocalist Bobby Harrison along with Mick Moody, formerly of Tramline, the Mike Cotton Sound and Juicy Lucy.
