A few years later, her family moved to the northeast of England and she attended school (which she hated) there. She left her drama school (which she also loathed) early, having been discovered by the BBC and cast in a lead role in the convention-breaking drama All Quiet on the Preston Front (1994). Since then she has worked steadily in television and on such films as Trois Anglaises en campagne (1998) and Trinity (2003), a British/Canadian co-production, and the horror/comedy hit Shaun of the Dead (2004).\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/lucy_akhurst", "page_content": "Highest Rated: 61% The Land Girls (1998)\n\nLowest Rated: 9% Circus (2000)\n\nBirthday: Nov 18, 1975\n\nBirthplace: London, England, UK\n\nActress Lucy Akhurst was widely known for her presence on the silver screen.

However, with the election of Rebecca Salter as the first female President of the Royal Academy at the end of 2019, it seems that this ancient institution is certainly moving in the right direction.\n\nDesign 1778\u20131780 Angelica Kauffmann (1741\u20131807) Royal Academy of Arts Royal Academy of Arts\n\nAlthough it took so long for female artists to be taken seriously as Academicians, women have been instrumental in the development of the Academy across the centuries. Here we take a walk through the history of the RA, focusing on the women who made it the institution it is today.\n\nAngelica Kauffmann and Mary Moser, the founder members\n\nIt may come as a surprise that when the Royal Academy was founded in 1768, there were two women among the 34 original Members \u2013 fairly progressive by eighteenth-century standards. Angelica Kauffmann (1741\u20131807) and Mary Moser (1744\u20131819) were both painters, Moser specialising in floral paintings and Kauffmann focusing on historical and allegorical subjects.\n\nEuphrosyne Complaining to Venus of the Wound Caused by Cupid\u2019s Dart 1793 Angelica Kauffmann (1741\u20131807) National Trust, Attingham Park National Trust, Attingham Park\n\nBoth were from artistic families and received their artistic training from their fathers, as there were few European artistic academies that accepted female students.\n\nBy the time the Royal Academy was founded, Kauffmann and Moser were already established on the London \u2013 and European \u2013 art scene, which doubtless increased their prestige, making them irresistible candidates to become Members of the Academy. For women to succeed as artists, it was crucial to move in the right circles, and both Kauffmann and Moser had contacts aplenty.\n\nThis is not to detract from these women's accomplishments as artists. In 1778 Kauffmann was commissioned by the Royal Academy to produce a set of four paintings showing the 'Elements of Art' for public display, and these works \u2013 Invention, Composition, Design and Colour \u2013 can still be seen in the RA's entrance hall.\n\nColour 1778\u20131780 Angelica Kauffmann (1741\u20131807) Royal Academy of Arts Royal Academy of Arts\n\nKauffmann had considerable influence in decisions made by the RA including vetoing Summer Exhibition paintings of which she did not approve.\n\nMoser was a similarly respected artist, most notably receiving a royal commission in the 1790s to decorate part of Queen Charlotte's new residence at Frogmore, near Windsor. Moser was also active in RA affairs, particularly in her later years, as ill-health prevented her from painting. As a woman, she was barred from attending Academy dinners, but she regularly attended and voted at General Assembly meetings. Her two floral paintings that decorated the Academy's premises at Somerset House are today gems of the RA collection.\n\nSummer c.1780 Mary Moser (1744\u20131819) Royal Academy of Arts Royal Academy of Arts\n\nDespite both women's artistic eminence, they were excluded from many of the key aspects of the Academy simply due to their gender. They were not permitted into the Life Room to study and draw nude models, for example \u2013 key to practising the human form. And after Moser's death in 1819, it was over a century before a female Academician was elected.\n\nAnnie Swynnerton, the first female Associate\n\nAlthough no female Academicians were elected in the nineteenth century, this does not mean that women were not active in the RA during this time. The annual Summer Exhibition always included works by female artists and in 1860 Laura Herford became the first woman to be accepted into the Royal Academy School, when she signed her application drawing with only her initials. The drawing was accepted before the professors realised Herford was a woman \u2013 but she was admitted nonetheless, her artistic merit shaking up the status quo.\n\nThe Letter 1900\u20131920 Annie Louisa Swynnerton (1844\u20131933) Royal Academy of Arts Royal Academy of Arts\n\nIt was not until 1922 that Annie Swynnerton (1844\u20131933) became the first woman to be elected to the RA (Moser and Kauffmann were technically invited to become Members, rather than elected in the normal way). Swynnerton was a symbolist and portrait painter. She was an active supporter of women's suffrage, counting the Pankhursts among her close friends.\n\nDame Millicent Fawcett, GBE, LLD exhibited 1930 Annie Louisa Swynnerton (1844\u20131933) Tate Tate\n\nHer election to the RA impacted little upon the role of women more generally in the Academy, however; she was only made an Associate (not a full Academician) and was almost in her 80s, making active participation in the governance of the RA unrealistic.\n\nLaura Knight, the first full Academician\n\nSwynnerton's election was the first pinhole in the floodgates for female Academicians. Just a decade later, the painter Laura Knight (1877\u20131970) was the first woman to be elected a full Academician. She paid tribute to her predecessor, describing how skilled women artists had been denied any public prominence until 'Mrs Swynnerton came and broke down the barriers of prejudice'.\n\nDawn 1933 Laura Knight (1877\u20131970) Royal Academy of Arts Royal Academy of Arts\n\nKnight paved the way for further female Academicians and was a prominent public figure in the Academy's affairs. She was determined to establish her position on an equal footing with the men in the Academy, and befriended key figures within the RA.\n\nRuby Loftus Screwing a Breech Ring 1943 Laura Knight (1877\u20131970) IWM (Imperial War Museums) IWM (Imperial War Museums)\n\nIn 1965, she was the first female artist to have a solo retrospective at the RA. But despite her popularity among the male Academicians, Knight had to wait until 1967 \u2013 having already been an Academician for 30 years \u2013 until she was allowed to attend a dinner at the RA, finally smashing through the boys' club mentality and dismantling the nearly 200-year-old tradition of male-only dining.\n\nGertrude Hermes, breaking down barriers\n\nKnight had Gertrude Hermes (1901\u20131983) to thank for the dinner invitation. Hermes became an Associate Academician in 1963 and became the first female engraver to become a full Academician in 1971.\n\nWaterfall 1967 Gertrude Hermes (1901\u20131983) Royal Academy of Arts Royal Academy of Arts\n\nAfter a General Assembly meeting in 1966, Hermes was appalled to discover that while the male Academicians proceeded to the decadent dinner that they could smell wafting into the meeting room, women members were excluded.\n\nStoneHenge 1963 Gertrude Hermes (1901\u20131983) Royal Academy of Arts Royal Academy of Arts\n\nShe campaigned to overturn this archaic misogynistic dining mentality, and the following year four female Academicians \u2013 Hermes and Knight included \u2013 joined the men at a historic dinner. The Times newspaper reported that Hermes even enjoyed 'a thoroughly masculine cigar.' Touch\u00e9.\n\nElisabeth Frink, the first female sculptor\n\nIn 1977, Elisabeth Frink (1930\u20131993) was the first female sculptor to become an Academician, over 40 years after Laura Knight became the first painter Academician.\n\nWarrior Elisabeth Frink (1930\u20131993) Nuffield College, University of Oxford Nuffield College, University of Oxford\n\nSculpture was perceived as a traditionally masculine art, due to its physically demanding nature. But Frink demolished this misconception, becoming one of the most prominent British sculptors of the twentieth century.\n\nDog 1992 Elisabeth Frink (1930\u20131993) Dorset Natural History and Archaeological Society Dorset Natural History and Archaeological Society\n\nAs a teacher, she was also admired by a generation of student artists and was active on many arts advisory committees. Such was her status in the British art scene that she was proposed as the first female President of the Academy, but she declined to stand.\n\nFemale Academicians in the RA Schools\n\nNotable firsts continued into the twenty-first century.\n\nTo Steal a Wedding Ring Eileen Cooper (b.1953) Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust\n\nThe year 2011 saw the election of Eileen Cooper (b.1953) as the first female Keeper of the Royal Academy Schools, having primary responsibility for the Schools and students.\n\nUntitled (six on brown) 1989 Fiona Rae (b.1963) Royal Academy of Arts Royal Academy of Arts\n\nThe same year also saw the first female Professors, Fiona Rae (b.1963) (Painting) and Tracey Emin (b.1963) (Drawing).\n\nTrying to Find You 1 2007 Tracey Emin (b.1963) Royal Academy of Arts Royal Academy of Arts\n\nThese historic appointments elevated the prominence of female art teachers, an influence which can now percolate through the next generation of artists in the RA Schools.\n\nShellburst Anthracite 1997 Cathie Pilkington (b.1968) Manchester Art Gallery Manchester Art Gallery\n\nUnder Cooper's tenure as Keeper, Cathie Pilkington (b.1968) in 2015 and Farshid Moussavi (b.1965) in 2017 became the first female Professors of Sculpture and of Architecture respectively.\n\nCooper set a precedent for female Keepers, with Rebecca Salter succeeding her in 2017 and Cathie Pilkington elected to the position in May 2020.\n\nRebecca Salter, the first female President\n\nDecember 2019 was a historic moment for the Royal Academy: 251 years after its foundation, the Royal Academy finally elected its first female President \u2013 the printmaker Rebecca Salter (b.1955).\n\nK37 1996 Rebecca Salter (b.1955) Yale Center for British Art Yale Center for British Art\n\nDuring her two years as Keeper, Salter had been intimately involved in the work of the Academy and its students. Her election as President was celebrated in all corners of the RA and beyond, as a momentous waymarker in the journey to gender equality within the Academy \u2013 and perhaps in the art world more widely.\n\nYet Salter has faced the most challenging first months of any President in the history of the Academy. The impact of Covid-19 and subsequent temporary closure of museums and galleries is proving catastrophic for the arts sector. All of the RA's exhibitions planned for 2020 and beyond have been rescheduled or cancelled altogether. This is a particular setback for female representation, as Marina Abramovi\u0107 (b.1946) was to have become the first female to have a dedicated solo show in the RA Main Galleries later in 2020, now pushed back to autumn 2021. Her time will come.\n\nIn a time of confusion and angst, one thing is for certain: when the RA reopens, it will resume its campaign for equality and representation, more determined than ever to bring art and opportunities to all. With Salter at the helm, steering the Academy through tempestuous seas, we can only look forward to the time when we can once again set foot in its historic galleries.\n\nLife School at the Royal Academy c.1979 Helen Clapcott (b.1952) Royal Academy of Arts Royal Academy of Arts\n\nOver the past decade, an almost equal number of female and male Academicians have been elected, pushing ever closer to gender parity between Academicians. But the fight for equality and diversity does not stop there. It took over 250 years for women to reach any form of equal representation within the Academy. The fight for greater diversity cannot afford to wait any longer.\n\nHelen Record, Curatorial Assistant at the Royal Academy of Arts"}, {"url": "https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/the-queen-70-years-of-patronage", "page_content": "The first official engagement Her Majesty The Queen attended in her Coronation year was a visit to the Royal Academy.

They wanted to establish a professional resident company on campus and at the same time open an Academy of Dramatic Art (ADA). Like the Meadow Brook School of Music, which relied on artists from the Meadow Brook Music Festival to offer quality instruction to students, the ADA would give students a unique opportunity to learn from profession. Fernald accepted OU\u2019s offer and in July 1966, the professional theater company -- Meadow Brook Theatre -- was officially launched, with the first season starting in January 1967. John Fernald\n\nat Meadow Brook Theatre\n\nThe Academy of Dramatic Art opened in the fall of the same year under the direction of Fernald. While plans for a new performing arts building - the future Varner Hall - started, the ADA found temporary quarters in the lower level of the Sports and Recreation building. In fall 1967 the Academy enrolled 13 students. 10 more were enrolled in the winter semester, and 9 more in the spring. The ADA greatly benefited from Fernald\u2019s worldwide reputation. He used his extensive network to reach out to actors, directors and other theatre professionals.\n\nIn this letter Fernald invites his friend Rosemary Harris, a well-known English actress, asking her to be a judge for the auditions recruiting students. Harris had just won a Tony Award for her performance as Eleanor of Aquitaine in A Lion in Winter on Broadway in 1966. She and her husband had created their own producing company, Association of Producing Artist .\n\nFrom 1967 to 1977, when the program was discontinued, the Academy of Dramatic Art graduated 116 students and produced 52 plays. Curriculum Students who passed the rigorous auditions were in for a demanding 2 years\u2019 training. The curriculum for the Diploma in Dramatic Art was \u201cmodeled after that of an English acting conservatory\u201d, with classes running 8 hours per day, 5 days a week, with instruction in voice, movement and acting techniques. In the second year, students had opportunities to polish these skills in public performances through the Studio Company. The initial calendar included 3 11-week terms per academic year. In 1970 they switched to 2 semesters. All courses were prescribed. Attrition was high because the program was very selective. But the Academy boasted small class sizes and one-on-one attention, and students praised the quality of the training.\n\nDirk Benedict, a successful actor on Broadway and in Hollywood, later said that the foundational training he got at the ADA was \u201cinvaluable\u201d and \u201cfantastic\u201d, giving him the confidence he needed as a performer. The program was not part of OU\u2019s academic offerings, and ADA credits were not transferable to OU credits. However in 1971-1972 the ADA started offering credit courses in the theater, open to OU students: UC045 Introduction to the Theatre, and UC009C Theatre in America Today. Both had enrollment in the hundreds. In collaboration with the School of Education they also offered a course Play Production for Secondary School Teachers.\n\nADA Students Students were recruited nationally through auditions. The Charter Class were selected at auditions in New York, and Chicago as well as on the OU campus, but later on auditions were also held on the West Coast. In the first few years, 70% of students came from out of state - a percentage that declined to less than a quarter by 1975-1976. The vast majority were mature students: they already had some college experience, and ages ranged from 20 to 23.\n\nThese students came to OU because they wanted more than the theatre programs at other colleges, which had less emphasis on professional training, and they were not deterred by the challenging job prospects in the acting profession. The presence of the Meadow Brook Theatre was a huge draw, and some graduates went on to work there.\n\nFaculty The original staff and faculty all came from the United Kingdom, as all but one had previously been employed by Fernald. John Broome, for example, had been a choreographer of the Old Vic Theatre in England before joining the ADA as lecturer in movement. Other instructors were later hired, such as Terence E. Kilburn who came to the ADA in October 1969 as a teacher and actor and director in residence. Kilburn had an early career as a child actor playing Tiny Tim in the original Christmas Carol movie, and had been in many other movies and plays before coming to OU. Upon Fernald\u2019s departure in 1970 he would become Artistic Director of the ADA and Meadow Brook Theatre.\n\nOver the years, numerous professionals were invited to speak and teach at the Academy. Among them were renowned guest artists: Catherine Fleming, voice coach for the National Theatre of England and for Laurence Olivier\n\nactor playwright and director Charles Nolte (a visiting lecturer in fall 1973)\n\nStuart Vaughan, an internationally known director, playwright and author, came to the ADA to direct the production of Richard III in 1973-1974. Several members of the neighboring Stratford Festival Theatre Company of Canada also visited the Academy.\n\nFrom 1967 to 1977, the ADA employed 62 teachers in acting, voice, and speech, dance, movement and mime, commedia, text and interpretation, period technique, singing, fencing and stage combat, and makeup. Studio Company Between 1968 and 1976, the Studio Company produced 52 plays and toured some of them to 60 different secondary schools. The first productions were presented during the summer of 1968 in the F.A. Bower Theater in Flint. The first productions on campus were in the lower level of the Sports and Recreation building, but during the 1969-70 season, the Studio Company was able to present plays in the Meadow Brook Theatre while its resident company performed at the Detroit Institute of Art.\n\nThis newspaper clipping from the Pontiac Press announces rehearsals for the Studio Company's first production at Meadow Brook Theatre - Dylan Thomas' Under Milk Wood. Below, students are rehearsing for the production.\n\nIn fall 1970 the Studio Company was finally able to occupy dedicated space in Varner Hall and began producing plays in the Studio Theatre. Many guest artists directed Studio Company productions, like Stuart Vaughan for Richard III. This helped students operate in a near-professional setting. End of the ADA The ADA thrived in in the first few years, especially after finding a home in Varner Hall and the Studio Theatre. After Fernald left in 1970 Jerry L. Dahlmann became Administrative Director and Kilburn became Acting Artistic Director for both the Meadow Brook Theatre and the Academy. In 1972 he took the position of Associate Dean of the School of Performing Arts, and soon after that Alfred Ruscio became artistic director of the ADA. However the ADA faced serious challenges. In the final years, lack of fund for invited faculty and AAUP contract guidelines led to reliance on full time faculty rather professionals on temporary basis. The Meadow Brook Theatre no longer had a resident company, which also limited the availability of professionals who could be part-time instructors. To properly train actors requires a number of professionals working with small groups of students, and even one-on-one. Such high quality training was very expensive. The program also struggled to recruit new talented students, in part because it did not offer sufficient financial aid but also because the ADA diploma became less attractive compared to theatre degree programs. After a thorough review in 1976 the decision was made to discontinue the program. Alumni In the decade of its existence the ADA produced a number of successful alumni. About 20% of graduates earned their living in the professional theater in 1976, and maybe half were still actively pursuing professional careers. This was quite an achievement, considering the limited employment prospects for actors. The most successful were probably the early graduates.\n\nDirk Benedict (Niewoehner) A June 1969 graduate, by 1972 Benedict was already playing leading roles on Broadway productions, such as Abelard and Heloise and Butterflies Are Free. He was also starring in a feature film, Georgia, Georgia.\n\nCurtis Armstrong A 1974 graduate, Armstrong is a successful actor who appeared in Risky Business and starred in the Revenge of the Nerds as well as numerous TV series like Moonlighting. He came back to OU to appear in Meadow Brook Theatre\u2019s Present Laughter in 1986. He is shown here in the Studio Company's production of The Tempest.\n\nRobert Englund Best known for his role as Freddy Krueger in the Nightmare on Elm Street series, Englund has appeared in dozens of films and TV series. In 1973 he returned to the Academy of Dramatic Art to teach a stunts and stage fight class and also appearing at the Meadow Brook Theatre.\n\nJayne Houdyshell A 1974 graduate and award-winning actress, she continued to appear in Meadow Brook Theatre plays in the 1980s and early 1990s. She won multiple Tony Award nominations starting in 2006, and won the 2016 Tony Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Featured Role in a Play for her role in The Humans.\n\nDefoy Glenn The first ADA African American graduate (1971), he directed \"The sty of the BIind Pig,\" a play by former Pontiac writer PhiIlip Hayes Dean at the Ujamaa Theatre of Pontiac in 1974. The play, in which Dean had explored his own experience as a black man and the sociology of black communities, was later quite successful Off Broadway. Glenn would go on to a successful acting and directing career."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lucy_Akhurst", "page_content": "Lucy Akhurst (born 18 November 1970) is an English actress, writer and director who has been working mainly in television since the 1990s.

However, with the election of Rebecca Salter as the first female President of the Royal Academy at the end of 2019, it seems that this ancient institution is certainly moving in the right direction.\n\nDesign 1778\u20131780 Angelica Kauffmann (1741\u20131807) Royal Academy of Arts Royal Academy of Arts\n\nAlthough it took so long for female artists to be taken seriously as Academicians, women have been instrumental in the development of the Academy across the centuries. Here we take a walk through the history of the RA, focusing on the women who made it the institution it is today.\n\nAngelica Kauffmann and Mary Moser, the founder members\n\nIt may come as a surprise that when the Royal Academy was founded in 1768, there were two women among the 34 original Members \u2013 fairly progressive by eighteenth-century standards. Angelica Kauffmann (1741\u20131807) and Mary Moser (1744\u20131819) were both painters, Moser specialising in floral paintings and Kauffmann focusing on historical and allegorical subjects.\n\nEuphrosyne Complaining to Venus of the Wound Caused by Cupid\u2019s Dart 1793 Angelica Kauffmann (1741\u20131807) National Trust, Attingham Park National Trust, Attingham Park\n\nBoth were from artistic families and received their artistic training from their fathers, as there were few European artistic academies that accepted female students.\n\nBy the time the Royal Academy was founded, Kauffmann and Moser were already established on the London \u2013 and European \u2013 art scene, which doubtless increased their prestige, making them irresistible candidates to become Members of the Academy. For women to succeed as artists, it was crucial to move in the right circles, and both Kauffmann and Moser had contacts aplenty.\n\nThis is not to detract from these women's accomplishments as artists. In 1778 Kauffmann was commissioned by the Royal Academy to produce a set of four paintings showing the 'Elements of Art' for public display, and these works \u2013 Invention, Composition, Design and Colour \u2013 can still be seen in the RA's entrance hall.\n\nColour 1778\u20131780 Angelica Kauffmann (1741\u20131807) Royal Academy of Arts Royal Academy of Arts\n\nKauffmann had considerable influence in decisions made by the RA including vetoing Summer Exhibition paintings of which she did not approve.\n\nMoser was a similarly respected artist, most notably receiving a royal commission in the 1790s to decorate part of Queen Charlotte's new residence at Frogmore, near Windsor. Moser was also active in RA affairs, particularly in her later years, as ill-health prevented her from painting. As a woman, she was barred from attending Academy dinners, but she regularly attended and voted at General Assembly meetings. Her two floral paintings that decorated the Academy's premises at Somerset House are today gems of the RA collection.\n\nSummer c.1780 Mary Moser (1744\u20131819) Royal Academy of Arts Royal Academy of Arts\n\nDespite both women's artistic eminence, they were excluded from many of the key aspects of the Academy simply due to their gender. They were not permitted into the Life Room to study and draw nude models, for example \u2013 key to practising the human form. And after Moser's death in 1819, it was over a century before a female Academician was elected.\n\nAnnie Swynnerton, the first female Associate\n\nAlthough no female Academicians were elected in the nineteenth century, this does not mean that women were not active in the RA during this time. The annual Summer Exhibition always included works by female artists and in 1860 Laura Herford became the first woman to be accepted into the Royal Academy School, when she signed her application drawing with only her initials. The drawing was accepted before the professors realised Herford was a woman \u2013 but she was admitted nonetheless, her artistic merit shaking up the status quo.\n\nThe Letter 1900\u20131920 Annie Louisa Swynnerton (1844\u20131933) Royal Academy of Arts Royal Academy of Arts\n\nIt was not until 1922 that Annie Swynnerton (1844\u20131933) became the first woman to be elected to the RA (Moser and Kauffmann were technically invited to become Members, rather than elected in the normal way). Swynnerton was a symbolist and portrait painter. She was an active supporter of women's suffrage, counting the Pankhursts among her close friends.\n\nDame Millicent Fawcett, GBE, LLD exhibited 1930 Annie Louisa Swynnerton (1844\u20131933) Tate Tate\n\nHer election to the RA impacted little upon the role of women more generally in the Academy, however; she was only made an Associate (not a full Academician) and was almost in her 80s, making active participation in the governance of the RA unrealistic.\n\nLaura Knight, the first full Academician\n\nSwynnerton's election was the first pinhole in the floodgates for female Academicians. Just a decade later, the painter Laura Knight (1877\u20131970) was the first woman to be elected a full Academician. She paid tribute to her predecessor, describing how skilled women artists had been denied any public prominence until 'Mrs Swynnerton came and broke down the barriers of prejudice'.\n\nDawn 1933 Laura Knight (1877\u20131970) Royal Academy of Arts Royal Academy of Arts\n\nKnight paved the way for further female Academicians and was a prominent public figure in the Academy's affairs. She was determined to establish her position on an equal footing with the men in the Academy, and befriended key figures within the RA.\n\nRuby Loftus Screwing a Breech Ring 1943 Laura Knight (1877\u20131970) IWM (Imperial War Museums) IWM (Imperial War Museums)\n\nIn 1965, she was the first female artist to have a solo retrospective at the RA. But despite her popularity among the male Academicians, Knight had to wait until 1967 \u2013 having already been an Academician for 30 years \u2013 until she was allowed to attend a dinner at the RA, finally smashing through the boys' club mentality and dismantling the nearly 200-year-old tradition of male-only dining.\n\nGertrude Hermes, breaking down barriers\n\nKnight had Gertrude Hermes (1901\u20131983) to thank for the dinner invitation. Hermes became an Associate Academician in 1963 and became the first female engraver to become a full Academician in 1971.\n\nWaterfall 1967 Gertrude Hermes (1901\u20131983) Royal Academy of Arts Royal Academy of Arts\n\nAfter a General Assembly meeting in 1966, Hermes was appalled to discover that while the male Academicians proceeded to the decadent dinner that they could smell wafting into the meeting room, women members were excluded.\n\nStoneHenge 1963 Gertrude Hermes (1901\u20131983) Royal Academy of Arts Royal Academy of Arts\n\nShe campaigned to overturn this archaic misogynistic dining mentality, and the following year four female Academicians \u2013 Hermes and Knight included \u2013 joined the men at a historic dinner. The Times newspaper reported that Hermes even enjoyed 'a thoroughly masculine cigar.' Touch\u00e9.\n\nElisabeth Frink, the first female sculptor\n\nIn 1977, Elisabeth Frink (1930\u20131993) was the first female sculptor to become an Academician, over 40 years after Laura Knight became the first painter Academician.\n\nWarrior Elisabeth Frink (1930\u20131993) Nuffield College, University of Oxford Nuffield College, University of Oxford\n\nSculpture was perceived as a traditionally masculine art, due to its physically demanding nature. But Frink demolished this misconception, becoming one of the most prominent British sculptors of the twentieth century.\n\nDog 1992 Elisabeth Frink (1930\u20131993) Dorset Natural History and Archaeological Society Dorset Natural History and Archaeological Society\n\nAs a teacher, she was also admired by a generation of student artists and was active on many arts advisory committees. Such was her status in the British art scene that she was proposed as the first female President of the Academy, but she declined to stand.\n\nFemale Academicians in the RA Schools\n\nNotable firsts continued into the twenty-first century.\n\nTo Steal a Wedding Ring Eileen Cooper (b.1953) Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust\n\nThe year 2011 saw the election of Eileen Cooper (b.1953) as the first female Keeper of the Royal Academy Schools, having primary responsibility for the Schools and students.\n\nUntitled (six on brown) 1989 Fiona Rae (b.1963) Royal Academy of Arts Royal Academy of Arts\n\nThe same year also saw the first female Professors, Fiona Rae (b.1963) (Painting) and Tracey Emin (b.1963) (Drawing).\n\nTrying to Find You 1 2007 Tracey Emin (b.1963) Royal Academy of Arts Royal Academy of Arts\n\nThese historic appointments elevated the prominence of female art teachers, an influence which can now percolate through the next generation of artists in the RA Schools.\n\nShellburst Anthracite 1997 Cathie Pilkington (b.1968) Manchester Art Gallery Manchester Art Gallery\n\nUnder Cooper's tenure as Keeper, Cathie Pilkington (b.1968) in 2015 and Farshid Moussavi (b.1965) in 2017 became the first female Professors of Sculpture and of Architecture respectively.\n\nCooper set a precedent for female Keepers, with Rebecca Salter succeeding her in 2017 and Cathie Pilkington elected to the position in May 2020.\n\nRebecca Salter, the first female President\n\nDecember 2019 was a historic moment for the Royal Academy: 251 years after its foundation, the Royal Academy finally elected its first female President \u2013 the printmaker Rebecca Salter (b.1955).\n\nK37 1996 Rebecca Salter (b.1955) Yale Center for British Art Yale Center for British Art\n\nDuring her two years as Keeper, Salter had been intimately involved in the work of the Academy and its students. Her election as President was celebrated in all corners of the RA and beyond, as a momentous waymarker in the journey to gender equality within the Academy \u2013 and perhaps in the art world more widely.\n\nYet Salter has faced the most challenging first months of any President in the history of the Academy. The impact of Covid-19 and subsequent temporary closure of museums and galleries is proving catastrophic for the arts sector. All of the RA's exhibitions planned for 2020 and beyond have been rescheduled or cancelled altogether. This is a particular setback for female representation, as Marina Abramovi\u0107 (b.1946) was to have become the first female to have a dedicated solo show in the RA Main Galleries later in 2020, now pushed back to autumn 2021. Her time will come.\n\nIn a time of confusion and angst, one thing is for certain: when the RA reopens, it will resume its campaign for equality and representation, more determined than ever to bring art and opportunities to all. With Salter at the helm, steering the Academy through tempestuous seas, we can only look forward to the time when we can once again set foot in its historic galleries.\n\nLife School at the Royal Academy c.1979 Helen Clapcott (b.1952) Royal Academy of Arts Royal Academy of Arts\n\nOver the past decade, an almost equal number of female and male Academicians have been elected, pushing ever closer to gender parity between Academicians. But the fight for equality and diversity does not stop there. It took over 250 years for women to reach any form of equal representation within the Academy. The fight for greater diversity cannot afford to wait any longer.\n\nHelen Record, Curatorial Assistant at the Royal Academy of Arts"}]}
