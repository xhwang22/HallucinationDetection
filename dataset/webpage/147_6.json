They are Mme Arkadina, a middle-aged actress; her lover, Trigorin, a successful writer; her son Konstantin, a writer; and Nina, a young aspiring actress whom Konstantin loves. Mme Arkadina, jealous of Nina\u2019s youth and promising career, acts cruelly and hatefully toward Konstantin, belittling his new play and withholding the approval he desperately seeks from her. Nina, impressed by Trigorin\u2019s fame, ignores Konstantin, who kills a seagull and shows it to her, perhaps symbolically referring to his broken dreams. All four go their separate ways, but two years later they are reunited at the same estate. When Nina again rejects Konstantin, he destroys his writings and shoots himself while his mother, unaware, plays cards in another room.\n\nAcclaimed actress Uta Hagen, winner of three Tony Awards, made her Broadway debut as Nina in 1938, a production that also starred Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne."}, {"url": "https://www.calendarz.com/on-this-day/november/18/lucy-akhurst", "page_content": "Birth\n\nNov, 18\n\nLucy Akhurst\n\nLucy Akhurst, English actress and producer\n\nLucy Akhurst (born 18 November 1970) is an English actress, writer and director who has been working mainly in television since the 1990s.

While everyone is caught up in passionately loving someone who loves somebody else, a tragicomedy unfolds about art, fame, human folly, and the eternal desire to live a purposeful life.\n\nThe estate is owned by Sorin (Brian Dennehy), a retired government employee, and his sister Irina (Annette Bening), a legendary actress of the Moscow stage. Irina is imperious, narcissistic and selfish, and anxious about holding on to her star status and the affections of her younger lover, Boris Trigorin (Corey Stoll), a successful writer of short stories. Irina constantly belittles her aspiring writer son Konstantin (Billy Howle), perhaps because his existence as a grown man reminds her that age is catching up with her. While he adores his mother despite her cruelty, Konstantin acts out his insecurity and anger by rejecting both her style of theatre and Boris's writing, declaring them old-fashioned and banal. A dreamer, Konstantin declares he will create bold and superior new forms of theatre and literature.\n\nKonstantin, who grew up on the estate, is head over heels in love with Nina (Saoirse Ronan), a beautiful and nai\u0308ve local girl who dreams of being an actress. Nina is flattered when Konstantin gives her the starring role in his newly written play, but soon after encountering Boris, she rejects Konstantin, and pursues the handsome and famous writer instead.\n\nMasha (Elisabeth Moss), the forlorn, black-clad, self-medicating daughter of Sorin's estate manager Shamrayev (Glenn Fleshler) and his wife Polina (Mare Winningham), suffers an unrequited love for Konstantin, who insensitively spurns her. She scorns the insipid schoolteacher Medvedenko (Michael Zegen), who refuses to be discouraged by her rejection and accepts any crumbs of attention she drops him. Polina aches for the charismatic country doctor Dorn (Jon Tenney), who, pays her some attention, but still relishes the connection with Irina with whom he had an affair years ago. The elderly Sorin, long past any hope of romance, lives in a languid state of regret over roads not taken.\n\nAdapted by Tony-winning playwright Stephen Karam (\"The Humans\") from Anton Chekhov's classic play and directed by Tony-winner Michael Mayer (\"Spring Awakening\"), THE SEAGULL explores, with comedy and melancholy, the obsessive nature of love, the tangled relationships between parents and children, and the transcendent value and psychic toll of art."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lucy_Akhurst", "page_content": "Lucy Akhurst (born 18 November 1970) is an English actress, writer and director who has been working mainly in television since the 1990s.
