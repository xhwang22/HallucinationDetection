The former Silver Fern is one of Steel's key signings for next year's trans-Tasman netball competition.\n\nSouthern Steel recruit Leana de Bruin has experienced the highs of winning a Commonwealth Games gold medal and a netball world championship, but they both pale in comparison to the recent birth of her first child.\n\nde Bruin and husband Quinton became the proud parents of son Caleb three weeks ago, and the former Silver Fern said it put everything in perspective.\n\n\"It's definitely a life-changing thing,\" de Bruin told The Southland Times.\n\n\"You've still got your own life, but it's different because you can't just go anywhere you want ... it's pretty rewarding.\"\n\nAt 1.9m, de Bruin is one of the tallest players out on the netball court and it appears little Caleb has the genes to one day follow in his mother's sporting footsteps, the newborn being about 55cm tall and weighing 4kg.\n\nde Bruin said Caleb had been fairly well behaved so far.\n\n\"He's pretty good. He gets a bit tired in the evenings. He sleeps really well ... it's a bit challenging at times.\"\n\nEarly next year, de Bruin will head down to the deep south to link up with her new Southern Steel team-mates, but it will be far from an unfamiliar surrounding.\n\nWhen de Bruin emigrated to New Zealand from South Africa in 2001, the first team she played for was Southern Sting in the then Coca-Cola Cup competition. She said she found the move to a new country pretty daunting initially.\n\n\"It was quite tough for me. My English wasn't very good. I was playing with (Silver Ferns) Donna (Wilkins), Adine (Wilson) and Bernice Mene and it was quite overwhelming.\n\n\"I've done the hard work and got my confidence back. I'm a much- stronger person than I was in 2001.\"\n\nde Bruin is on track to become the first player to play for all five New Zealand ANZ Championship franchises. Southern Steel will be her third franchise after stints with the Northern Mystics in the inaugural year of the competition, and Waikato-Bay of Plenty Magic this season. Earlier this year, she hit the headlines with Magic as she broke new ground by continuing to play in the world's elite netball competition until she was five and a half months pregnant.\n\nThe signing of the towering de Bruin \u2013 who is proficient at either goal keep or goal defence \u2013 was a real coup for Steel after the Southern franchise lost key defenders Megan Hutton (retired) and Katrina Grant (Pulse) during the off season. Her addition gives coach Robyn Broughton great options in the defensive circle, with Silver Fern Sheryl Scanlan, Te Huinga Reo Selby-Rickit, Emma Moynihan and Erika Burgess all vying for starting spots.\n\nde Bruin will follow a strict fitness regime during the coming months before joining up with her Steel team-mates in Invercargill in early March.\n\nShe said the biggest thing that appealed to her about Steel was the chance to link up with old team-mates and the strong family culture within the franchise.\n\nSome people have written Steel off for next season's title, with the side lacking a marquee signing, but de Bruin was confident they had the players to be a force in the competition.\n\n\"We're the type of team who don't have the big names, but we've got lots of up-and-coming stars .. if we click and gel, we'll be very good.\"\n\nShe expected next year's ANZ Championship to be the most even in the competition's history, with virtually every side getting stronger during the off season.\n\nde Bruin's transition to Invercargill will be eased by her mother also coming down for the ANZ Championship to help look after Caleb. Her husband Quinton will remain in the couple's home town of Hamilton \u2013 where he works as a business analyst for ASB \u2013 but plans to fly down every second weekend.\n\nThis year, Steel encountered problems with first-time mother Donna Wilkins, who felt the franchise did not offer her adequate support as a new mum.\n\nde Bruin has had lengthy talks with Steel about the challenges of combining top-level netball and being a new mother, and was happy with their arrangements for next season.\n\n\"We sat down and I asked a lot of questions ... I'm pretty lucky, with Caleb being healthy. He'll be able to stay with my mum.\"\n\nThe 32-year-old de Bruin will not be the only new mum in Steel's ranks next season, with shooter Daneka Wipiiti expecting her first child early next month.\n\nde Bruin was one of the premier defenders in New Zealand's old domestic netball competition, and said she had noticed instantly a considerable lift in the intensity of the game since the advent of the semi-professional ANZ Championship two years ago.\n\n\"It's pretty full on. There's a lot more games. Every game is important. There's no easy games.\"\n\nMarking some of the best shooters in the world like Romelda Aiken, Sharelle McMahon and Catherine Cox was also a big step up for New Zealand defenders, she said.\n\n\"You definitely have to have your jumping boots on,\" de Bruin laughed.\n\n\"Luckily, I'm not one of the shortest people going around.\"\n\nde Bruin has racked up 33 caps for the Silver Ferns since switching allegiances from South Africa to New Zealand in 2002. She said she still had a burning desire to wear the black dress again.\n\n\"That would be awesome. I'd love to go to the Commonwealth Games (next year) and the World Champs. One of my dreams is to play in the final of the World Champs ...\n\n\"We'll see how things go.\""}, {"url": "https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/netball/5866566/Mother-of-all-dilemmas-for-Leana-de-Bruin", "page_content": "MUMMY'S BOY: Leana de Bruin with son Caleb as she arrived home from winning gold in the Commonwealth Games last year.\n\nLeana de Bruin's little boy turned two on Wednesday.\n\nBut instead of being in Cambridge to help wee Caleb blow out his candles, the Silver Ferns defender was twiddling her thumbs in an Adelaide hotel, ahead of that night's match against Australia.\n\n\"It was probably the toughest thing [about coming on this three-test tour],\" de Bruin said.\n\n\"As mums, you do feel a lot more guilty [about being away]. But I've organised everything for him so hopefully he's not too mad at me. When I get back we'll have another party so he'll actually have more than one birthday.\"\n\nAfter eight up and down years in the black dress, the 34-year-old has finally established herself as New Zealand's top goal keep. And the world's, for that matter.\n\nBut as satisfying as that is, de Bruin does fear the impact netball is beginning to have on her real life.\n\nIt's for those reasons that she'll play for Waikato-Bay of Plenty Magic in next year's trans-Tasman netball league, after two successful seasons commuting to the Southern Steel.\n\n\"He [Caleb] is at an age now that he understands that I leave, but he doesn't quite understand days and how long I'm away for,\" she said.\n\n\"That makes it really hard, especially for the people that have to look after him.\n\n\"Because he's a real mummy's boy at the moment I actually feel more sorry for them.\n\n\"You obviously miss out on a lot when you go away as often as I used to, so I'm definitely looking forward to that not happening as much and only having to drive 10 minutes to training.\"\n\nDe Bruin would like more children, but acknowledges that would probably mean the end of her international netball career.\n\nDespite being five years her senior, Irene van Dyk has indicated she'll have to be dragged out of the black dress kicking and screaming. De Bruin doesn't know how much time she has left as a Silver Fern and gets more uncertain by the day.\n\nTake the 2015 world champs, for example.\n\n\"Um,\" she began. \"It would have been a definite `no' if you'd asked me a month ago. But when I saw the plan for the next four years I got a bit excited again.\n\n\"I still definitely have that fire burning inside of me to win another world champs, so never say never.\"\n\nIn that respect, the Silver Ferns are an admirable lot. There's little money or fame to be derived from playing international netball.\n\nInstead, they do it for the honour of representing their country and because not much in the rest of their lives comes close to the intensity of a match against Australia.\n\nASIDE from saying \"I just love, love that feeling\", de Bruin initially found it hard to describe what a clash with the Diamonds is like.\n\n\"What about this? Have you ever bungy jumped or anything like that? Try that and then come back to me,\" she said.\n\n\"It's pretty much that feeling of `oh shit, here we go'.\"\n\nAway from netball, though, de Bruin prefers a life without high adrenalin. So as much as South Africa, for whom she previously played 34 tests, will always be home, de Bruin doubts she'll ever return for good.\n\n\"That's another one of those questions that's hard to answer. I'm loving New Zealand and the lifestyle suits us very well as a family.\n\n\"It's really nice to visit and to see my family, but to live would be a different story. My brother got hijacked about a month ago and that made me think it was a definite `no' to going back, especially with younger kids.\"\n\nAssuming she ever gets time to expand the family.\n\nAT A GLANCE\n\nName: Leana de Bruin\n\nBorn: Bethlehem, Free State, South Africa\n\nAge: 34\n\nHeight: 1.90m\n\nPosition: Goal keep, goal defence\n\nTest caps: 90 (56 for New Zealand and 34 for South Africa)\n\nHonours: Gold medals at 2003 world championships and 2006 and 2010 Commonwealth Games.

Alex Marshall is now the country's most successful Commonwealth competitor after a fifth gold. Para-cyclist Neil Fachie and pilot Matt Rotherham won double gold at the velodrome.\n\nDisappointments: Lynsey Sharp failed to qualify from the 800m heats despite winning silver four years ago in Glasgow.\n\nWhat they said\n\nScotland chef de mission Jon Doig\n\n\"When you look at these Games, the fact we've had medals across so many sports and medals coming in every day has been absolutely fantastic.\n\n\"It's our best ever overseas games, we're very, very happy.

The only way I did it was through the support of the fans,\" said Orie.\n\n\"I had two rounds to prove myself and I'd never heard a roar like that.

It's her third time, she stuck at it and the reward shows. My gold doesn't mean half as much as what it means for her,\" he added.\n\nBroadhurst's victory against England's Gemma Richardson in the lightweight final was Northern Ireland's fifth gold medal in Birmingham and the moment where the nation broke their record at a single Games.\n\nEarlier, featherweight Gallagher was awarded gold after his final opponent Joseph Commey of Ghana was deemed medically unfit to compete.\n\nCarly McNaul comes away from Birmingham with consecutive silver medal wins at Games after she missed out on gold to India's Nikhat Zareen.\n\nTreble triumph for Scotland\n\nHickey triumphed in the middleweight title bout for Scotland as he was pushed all the way by 19-year-old Australian Callum Peters, while Lazzerini edged Wales' Bevan in the light-heavyweight division.\n\nLynch picked up Scotland's third boxing gold of the day after a closely-fought win over Louis Richarno Colin from Mauritius.\n\nEccles & Croft claim Wales victories\n\nAs Bevan settled for silver against Scotland's Lazzerini, Eccles was the sole Welsh representative on top of the podium on Sunday as she beat Australia's Kaye Scott in the light-middleweight category.\n\nShe becomes only the second Welsh female to win Commonwealth boxing gold after Lauren Price in 2018.\n\nCroft, 20, boxed smartly to win welterweight gold against Zambia's Stephen Zimba.\n\nAfter his twin brother Garan won bronze after losing in the light-middleweight semi-finals on Saturday, Croft ensured the pair will also be taking a gold medal back to their home village of Crymych, which has a population of 800.\n\n\"It is a dream come true,\" said Ioan Croft. \"Garan was unlucky, but one of us has got gold and we will be taking that home together.

From Olivia Breen's golden smile to 75-year-old-Gordon Llewellyn becoming the nation's oldest Commonwealth medallist.\n\nSome sports like cycling and boxing excelled. Others were left wondering, what if?\n\nBut it seems Wales has unearthed a handful of young talents who look on course to push on to the next Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2024.\n\nBBC Sport Wales looks back at Team Wales' time in Birmingham.\n\nThe moments of magic\n\nOn the first night of the track and field events, Olivia Breen had the race of her life. The 26-year-old out-sprinted double Paralympic champion and long-time rival Sophie Hahn to gold in the women's T37/38 100m final.\n\nHer smile lit up Birmingham's revamped Alexander Stadium as she crossed the line for what arguably became the defining image of Wales' Commonwealths.\n\nFormer world champion triathlete Non Stanford said before the Games that winning a medal for Wales was her 'ultimate dream'.\n\nHer first chance came and went in the women's individual race, as she finished sixth. But then Wales' mixed relay team of Stanford, Dominic Coy, Olivia Mathias and Iestyn Harrett pulled out something special.\n\nThe relatively inexperienced team at international level were leaving Olympians behind them as they set up Stanford for an emotional sprint finish to silver, which she confirmed afterwards would be her last major race.\n\nSome of Team Wales' best results at the Birmingham Games actually came 140 miles away in London.\n\nThe track cycling was held at the Lee Valley Velopark, the home of so many memorable moments at the London Olympics.\n\nWales left with six medals, including gold for para tandem cyclist James Ball and two brilliant bronzes for sprint sensation Emma Finucane.\n\nAt the age of 75, Gordon Llewellyn won silver in the lawn bowls, alongside Julie Thomas in the para mixed pairs, to become Wales' oldest Commonwealth medallist. Three days later Anna Hursey, 59 years his junior, won bronze in the table tennis.\n\nAnd then there were the boxers. The class of 2022 put on a show, winning two golds, one silver and three bronze medals to surpass the sport's previous best Games in 1958.\n\nThe two champions, Ioan Croft and Rosie Eccles, will be ones to watch ahead of the next Olympics, but all six medallists impressed throughout the week.\n\nPara glory\n\nArguably Team Wales' biggest success story of the Birmingham Games was the strength of its para athletes.\n\nNineteen were selected, a record number, and they came back with eight medals, including half the team's overall golds of four.\n\nAs well as Olivia Breen, Aled Sion Davies also won gold in the para athletics. James Ball took track cycling gold and silver, while Joshua Stacey became Wales' first Commonwealth champion in table tennis.\n\nHarrison Walsh could not hide his emotion at winning F42-44/F61-64 discus bronze behind Davies, while 18-year-old Lily Rice, who made her name backflipping wheelchairs, took bronze in the pool just nine months after taking up the sport again.\n\nThen there was that remarkable silver for Llewellyn and Julie Thomas in the para lawn bowls.\n\nWhat if?\n\nA sliding doors moment came long before the sport even began, when shooting was excluded from the 2022 Games programme.\n\nWales had won five medals in the sport four years ago, including two golds. Ultimately they were medals Wales failed to make up for elsewhere here.\n\nThere were unanswered questions throughout the Games. Swimmer Dan Jervis was a huge gold medal hope in the men's 1500m freestyle, but he was forced to withdraw from the Games due to the ongoing effects of Covid.\n\nGeraint Thomas' crash in the men's time trial cost him silver at the very least and he may well have won gold had he stayed on his bike. There were a bucket load of narrow fourths too, from the pool to the velodrome.\n\nRoom for improvement\n\nWhile cycling and boxing excelled with seven and six medals respectively, other sports had a more frustrating time in Birmingham.\n\nFor the first time since Cardiff hosted the Games back in 1958, Wales failed to win a weightlifting medal.\n\nHall 1 at the NEC never came close to the scenes of Gareth Evans dancing around in celebration after winning Wales' first gold of the Games four years ago in Australia.\n\nSwimming and athletics had a mixed time. Teenagers Medi Harris and Lily Rice were rightfully proud of their bronze medals in the pool, but it was only the second time in five Games the sport had not produced a Commonwealth champion.\n\nAthletics did not win any medals outside of its exceptional para sport programme - but the fifth places for 100m sprinter Jeremiah Azu and 1,500m runner Jake Heyward were impressive results in high class fields.\n\nReasons to be cheerful\n\nThe future looks bright for Team Wales as a whole host of young stars look like being on course to make names for themselves in the very near future.\n\nUK men's 100m champion Azu became the first Welshman to reach a men's 100m final since it was counted in metres, not yards.\n\nHeyward broke the Commonwealth Games record in the men's 1500m final but unfortunately so did four others ahead of him, such is the strength of that event these days.\n\nIn the pool, teenagers Harris, Rice and Olympic champion Matt Richards could shine in Paris, while cycling sprinters Finucane, Rhian Edmunds and Lowri Thomas looked right at home alongside countless Olympians in the velodrome.\n\nIoan Croft was cheered on to boxing gold by his twin brother Garan, who had won bronze.\n\nBoth are establishing themselves on the Great Britain Olympic programme and the 20-year-olds will only go from strength to strength from here.\n\nAnd you cannot talk about Wales' young stars without mentioning Anna Hursey, the table tennis player who made global headlines four years ago when she was selected for Gold Coast aged just 11.\n\nNow, in 2022, she will be remembered for her achievements not her age as the teenager won bronze alongside Charlotte Carey in the women's doubles.\n\nTime to say goodbye\n\nNo great champion can go on forever and 2022 saw the final appearances in the red of Wales for a number of top stars.\n\nGeraint Thomas won his fourth Commonwealth medal, 16 years after his first, before confirming this would be his last Games for Wales.\n\nStanford also went out on a high with her triathlon relay silver.\n\nAnd no Welsh woman has ever been to more Commonwealth Games than Anwen Butten.\n\nThe 49-year-old lawn bowler was the team's captain at her sixth Games. Afterwards she announced she would be stepping aside in the sport.\n\nSo that was Wales' tale of 2022. Victoria, Australia beckons, where in just under four years they get to do it all again."}, {"url": "https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/commonwealth-games/netball/10333768/De-Bruin-ready-for-team-mate-in-Games-semi", "page_content": "PREPARED: Silver Ferns defender Leana de Bruin, pictured in action in a pool match against Jamaica, is looking forward to facing Magic team mate and shooter Jo Harten when NZ face England in the Commonwealth Games semifinals.\n\nSilver Ferns defender Leana de Bruin is looking forward to taking on franchise team mate Jo Harten for a place in the Commonwealth Games gold medal final.\n\nEngland goal shoot Harten was a key member of the Waikato/Bay of Plenty Magic team along with de Bruin this year, but the pair will go head to head tomorrow night at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre (9pm NZ time).\n\nHaving edged past Jamaica on Wednesday night with a flattering 50-42 win, the Silver Ferns know they will face another difficult game against an English side which was unlucky not to despatch Australia in the group stage.\n\n''We've got to focus on one thing and I've got to really focus on Jo and what I can do against her, or whoever is taking her on,'' de Bruin said.\n\n''Everyone is tough and I think the ANZ definitely helps. Those girls know us pretty well, especially Jo, that we are going to come up against.''\n\nDe Bruin and captain Casey Kopua were superb against Jamaica, New Zealand's defence making up for a poor shooting return in the absence of the injured Maria Tutaia and Cathrine Latu which saw Jodi Brown and Ellen Halpenny shoot a combined 73 per cent.\n\nNew Zealand's experienced circle defence kept Jhaniele Fowler-Reid to just 35 goals, a performance Silver Ferns coach Wai Taumaunu rated as the best defensive effort against the world class finisher at these Commonwealth Games.\n\n''I think it's great that we had such a tough battle before we had the finals series because we've showed what we can do,'' de Bruin said.\n\nThe injuries which had affected the team were not a scenario the Silver Ferns had prepared for, although they do spend a lot of time training to cope with adversity.\n\n''There's nothing you can do about it. You've just got to refocus and I thought Ellen and Jodi did particularly well,'' de Bruin said.\n\n''They just got on with the job. That's the opportunity and they've just got to shine when it matters.'\n\nTaumaunu said Halpenny had not disgraced herself in the biggest game of her fledgling international career.\n\n''I don't think it was our best shooting accuracy performance but I think they worked the circle pretty well. We had a youngster out there who had to come into the big time very fast and under some real public glare and she coped - and that's as good as we could have asked.\n\n''It was up to us to create the number of opportunities she needed and keep that circle composed.'\n\nUnbeaten Australia will take on Jamaica in the second semifinal from 11.15pm (NZ time).\n\nHaving worked over Fowler-Reid, de Bruin said the Silver Ferns would take some confidence forward against another tall shooter in Australia's Caitlin Bassett if they can get past England.\n\n''Aussie plays a similar style with Bassett, so it's good preparation for that but we've just got to take it one game at a time and refocus for England now.''"}, {"url": "https://www.itv.com/news/wales/2022-08-03/olivia-breen-wins-wales-third-commonwealth-gold-in-personal-best-time", "page_content": "Play Brightcove video\n\nOlivia Breen's joyous reaction to winning gold at Commonwealth Games 2022\n\nWales has secured two more gold medals on day five of the Commonwealth Games as Olivia Breen followed Jarred Breen and Daniel Salmon to reach top of the podium on Tuesday (2 August).\n\nThe track and field athlete beat rival, Team England's Sophie Hahn, in the Women's T37/38 100m - recording a personal best time of 12.83 seconds.\n\nIt made an impressive day for Team Wales who had already taken another gold that morning in the lawn bowls and then a bronze with Jasmine Hacker-Jones in the judo.\n\nWith just five more days left of the Birmingham games, Team Wales' medal total reached 13 - three gold, two silver and eight bronze.

The former Silver Fern is one of Steel's key signings for next year's trans-Tasman netball competition.\n\nSouthern Steel recruit Leana de Bruin has experienced the highs of winning a Commonwealth Games gold medal and a netball world championship, but they both pale in comparison to the recent birth of her first child.\n\nde Bruin and husband Quinton became the proud parents of son Caleb three weeks ago, and the former Silver Fern said it put everything in perspective.\n\n\"It's definitely a life-changing thing,\" de Bruin told The Southland Times.\n\n\"You've still got your own life, but it's different because you can't just go anywhere you want ... it's pretty rewarding.\"\n\nAt 1.9m, de Bruin is one of the tallest players out on the netball court and it appears little Caleb has the genes to one day follow in his mother's sporting footsteps, the newborn being about 55cm tall and weighing 4kg.\n\nde Bruin said Caleb had been fairly well behaved so far.\n\n\"He's pretty good. He gets a bit tired in the evenings. He sleeps really well ... it's a bit challenging at times.\"\n\nEarly next year, de Bruin will head down to the deep south to link up with her new Southern Steel team-mates, but it will be far from an unfamiliar surrounding.\n\nWhen de Bruin emigrated to New Zealand from South Africa in 2001, the first team she played for was Southern Sting in the then Coca-Cola Cup competition. She said she found the move to a new country pretty daunting initially.\n\n\"It was quite tough for me. My English wasn't very good. I was playing with (Silver Ferns) Donna (Wilkins), Adine (Wilson) and Bernice Mene and it was quite overwhelming.\n\n\"I've done the hard work and got my confidence back. I'm a much- stronger person than I was in 2001.\"\n\nde Bruin is on track to become the first player to play for all five New Zealand ANZ Championship franchises. Southern Steel will be her third franchise after stints with the Northern Mystics in the inaugural year of the competition, and Waikato-Bay of Plenty Magic this season. Earlier this year, she hit the headlines with Magic as she broke new ground by continuing to play in the world's elite netball competition until she was five and a half months pregnant.\n\nThe signing of the towering de Bruin \u2013 who is proficient at either goal keep or goal defence \u2013 was a real coup for Steel after the Southern franchise lost key defenders Megan Hutton (retired) and Katrina Grant (Pulse) during the off season. Her addition gives coach Robyn Broughton great options in the defensive circle, with Silver Fern Sheryl Scanlan, Te Huinga Reo Selby-Rickit, Emma Moynihan and Erika Burgess all vying for starting spots.\n\nde Bruin will follow a strict fitness regime during the coming months before joining up with her Steel team-mates in Invercargill in early March.\n\nShe said the biggest thing that appealed to her about Steel was the chance to link up with old team-mates and the strong family culture within the franchise.\n\nSome people have written Steel off for next season's title, with the side lacking a marquee signing, but de Bruin was confident they had the players to be a force in the competition.\n\n\"We're the type of team who don't have the big names, but we've got lots of up-and-coming stars .. if we click and gel, we'll be very good.\"\n\nShe expected next year's ANZ Championship to be the most even in the competition's history, with virtually every side getting stronger during the off season.\n\nde Bruin's transition to Invercargill will be eased by her mother also coming down for the ANZ Championship to help look after Caleb. Her husband Quinton will remain in the couple's home town of Hamilton \u2013 where he works as a business analyst for ASB \u2013 but plans to fly down every second weekend.\n\nThis year, Steel encountered problems with first-time mother Donna Wilkins, who felt the franchise did not offer her adequate support as a new mum.\n\nde Bruin has had lengthy talks with Steel about the challenges of combining top-level netball and being a new mother, and was happy with their arrangements for next season.\n\n\"We sat down and I asked a lot of questions ... I'm pretty lucky, with Caleb being healthy. He'll be able to stay with my mum.\"\n\nThe 32-year-old de Bruin will not be the only new mum in Steel's ranks next season, with shooter Daneka Wipiiti expecting her first child early next month.\n\nde Bruin was one of the premier defenders in New Zealand's old domestic netball competition, and said she had noticed instantly a considerable lift in the intensity of the game since the advent of the semi-professional ANZ Championship two years ago.\n\n\"It's pretty full on. There's a lot more games. Every game is important. There's no easy games.\"\n\nMarking some of the best shooters in the world like Romelda Aiken, Sharelle McMahon and Catherine Cox was also a big step up for New Zealand defenders, she said.\n\n\"You definitely have to have your jumping boots on,\" de Bruin laughed.\n\n\"Luckily, I'm not one of the shortest people going around.\"\n\nde Bruin has racked up 33 caps for the Silver Ferns since switching allegiances from South Africa to New Zealand in 2002. She said she still had a burning desire to wear the black dress again.\n\n\"That would be awesome. I'd love to go to the Commonwealth Games (next year) and the World Champs.

But I've organised everything for him so hopefully he's not too mad at me. When I get back we'll have another party so he'll actually have more than one birthday.\"\n\nAfter eight up and down years in the black dress, the 34-year-old has finally established herself as New Zealand's top goal keep. And the world's, for that matter.\n\nBut as satisfying as that is, de Bruin does fear the impact netball is beginning to have on her real life.\n\nIt's for those reasons that she'll play for Waikato-Bay of Plenty Magic in next year's trans-Tasman netball league, after two successful seasons commuting to the Southern Steel.\n\n\"He [Caleb] is at an age now that he understands that I leave, but he doesn't quite understand days and how long I'm away for,\" she said.\n\n\"That makes it really hard, especially for the people that have to look after him.\n\n\"Because he's a real mummy's boy at the moment I actually feel more sorry for them.\n\n\"You obviously miss out on a lot when you go away as often as I used to, so I'm definitely looking forward to that not happening as much and only having to drive 10 minutes to training.\"\n\nDe Bruin would like more children, but acknowledges that would probably mean the end of her international netball career.\n\nDespite being five years her senior, Irene van Dyk has indicated she'll have to be dragged out of the black dress kicking and screaming. De Bruin doesn't know how much time she has left as a Silver Fern and gets more uncertain by the day.\n\nTake the 2015 world champs, for example.\n\n\"Um,\" she began. \"It would have been a definite `no' if you'd asked me a month ago. But when I saw the plan for the next four years I got a bit excited again.\n\n\"I still definitely have that fire burning inside of me to win another world champs, so never say never.\"\n\nIn that respect, the Silver Ferns are an admirable lot. There's little money or fame to be derived from playing international netball.\n\nInstead, they do it for the honour of representing their country and because not much in the rest of their lives comes close to the intensity of a match against Australia.\n\nASIDE from saying \"I just love, love that feeling\", de Bruin initially found it hard to describe what a clash with the Diamonds is like.\n\n\"What about this? Have you ever bungy jumped or anything like that? Try that and then come back to me,\" she said.\n\n\"It's pretty much that feeling of `oh shit, here we go'.\"\n\nAway from netball, though, de Bruin prefers a life without high adrenalin. So as much as South Africa, for whom she previously played 34 tests, will always be home, de Bruin doubts she'll ever return for good.\n\n\"That's another one of those questions that's hard to answer. I'm loving New Zealand and the lifestyle suits us very well as a family.\n\n\"It's really nice to visit and to see my family, but to live would be a different story. My brother got hijacked about a month ago and that made me think it was a definite `no' to going back, especially with younger kids.\"\n\nAssuming she ever gets time to expand the family.\n\nAT A GLANCE\n\nName: Leana de Bruin\n\nBorn: Bethlehem, Free State, South Africa\n\nAge: 34\n\nHeight: 1.90m\n\nPosition: Goal keep, goal defence\n\nTest caps: 90 (56 for New Zealand and 34 for South Africa)\n\nHonours: Gold medals at 2003 world championships and 2006 and 2010 Commonwealth Games.

I said, 'I'm really sorry, thank you for the opportunity, but I think it's time for me to go'.\"\n\nTelling her team-mates she was stepping away from the international game was \"one of the toughest things\" she's had to do.\n\nDe Bruin debuted for the Silver Ferns in 2003, having only intended to stay one season with the Invercargill-based Southern Sting in 2001.\n\nWhen she landed in New Zealand, she predominantly spoke Afrikaan and hadn't contemplated switching allegiances.\n\n\"I didn't ever think I would be good enough to play for the Silver Ferns, let alone run out in my black dress 100 times for them.\n\n\"I've had a lot of ups and downs, but I wouldn't change anything for the world.\"\n\nCapturing a world championship with the Silver Ferns in 2003 in Jamaica, the last time they won the title, rated as one of her career highlights.\n\n\"There's not a lot of New Zealanders that can say they've done that.\"\n\nWinning back-to-back Commonwealth Games gold medals in 2006 and 2010, and thumping Australia by 25 goals [61-36] in Auckland in 2005, were also magical moments.\n\nDe Bruin was undecided whether she was done with elite netball completely.\n\nShe wanted to take time out before making a call on playing for the Magic in next year's elite domestic league.\n\n\"I've kind of got my head around not playing in a black dress, but to get my head around not playing netball again is probably a bit more of a tougher decision to make.\"\n\nWith netball dominating her life for the past 20-plus years, de Bruin was excited about being able to unwind.\n\nShe was looking forward to spending more time with son Caleb, who turns seven in October, and watching him play rugby on Saturday mornings in winter.\n\nSouthby saluted de Bruin's contribution to the Silver Ferns and her international netball longevity.\n\n\"We lose a lot in the experience she brought to the team. She's been an amazing servant of the game not only here, but in South Africa and has left a huge legacy behind.\"\n\nDebutant Storm Purvis and fellow youngster Phoenix Karaka, who has 10 caps, were named in the Silver Ferns' defensive end, alongside new skipper Katrina Grant and the experienced Anna Harrison.\n\nDe Bruin spoke positively about Purvis and Karaka's ability and said it was important for New Zealand to build combinations and provide players with opportunities early in the World Cup cycle.\n\n\"They have got amazing talent. They've got a bit to learn, but I think they're very eager to learn. They pick things up very fast.\n\n\"Hopefully, in three years' time [at the World Cup], they can get the gold for us again.\"\n\nDe Bruin had been inundated with messages of support from a multitude of past and present team-mates and opponents.\n\nShe had been blown away by their goodwill.\n\n\"I don't see myself as one of the superstars, but they definitely make you feel like one.\""}, {"url": "https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/netball/5023485/Leana-De-Bruin-delighted-by-netball-MVP-win", "page_content": "RELAXED: Southern Steel defender and joint MVP Leana de Bruin and her 19-month-old son Caleb at home in Waikato.\n\nSouthern Steel defender Leana de Bruin is putting her sensational season down to finding the right balance between the rigours of top-level netball and family life.\n\nThe 44-cap Silver Fern has been jointly named the trans-Tasman netball league's most valuable player with Queensland Firebirds' shooter Natalie Medhurst.\n\nShe was struggling to comprehend the news yesterday.\n\n\"It was a bit of a surprise,\"de Bruin said.\n\n\"I was like `are you for real'? It feels a little bit surreal still, but it's definitely a nice feeling.\"\n\nDe Bruin's achievement is remarkable considering that Steel only won four of their 13 games this season.\n\nShe was a more than worthy recipient of the award, however, with the South African native in brilliant touch for an underperforming Steel side. She led the ANZ Championship in deflections and was second for both intercepts and rebounds.\n\nDe Bruin was also named in the inaugural ANZ Championship All Star Seven team this year, pipping Firebirds' standout Laura Geitz for the starting goal keep berth.\n\nThe 33-year-old de Bruin has played some of the best netball of her career since switching to Steel two years ago. This year, she has commuted between her Hamilton home and Invercargill, which allowed her to spend time with her 19-month-old son Caleb and train individually before joining her Steel team-mates later in the week.\n\nDe Bruin said she often felt guilty being away from her team-mates, which forced her to train harder than she normally would, and credited having the best of both worlds for her remarkable play this year.\n\n\"I had a good balance. When I worked (in Hamilton), I worked really hard. I felt bad being away from the girls. I had to do my bit at home and did a little bit extra because I knew the girls would have been working hard as well.\"\n\nWith so many talented players in the ANZ Championship, de Bruin said it was a real honour to claim the prestigious trophy with Medhurst.\n\n\"There's so many awesome players in this league and they just seem to get better and better. Getting older does help. The older I get, the wiser I get. It's a great privilege really.\"\n\nIn the closest MVP race in the competition's history, de Bruin and Medhurst each scored 18 votes with Queensland's Romelda Aiken, West Coast's Caitlin Bassett and Adelaide midcourter Natalie von Bertouch all gaining 16 votes.\n\nVotes are awarded by national selectors from Australia and New Zealand, who nominate the three most outstanding players on court at every game on a 3-2-1 basis.\n\nIt is the second year in a row a Steel player has taken out the ANZ Championship's MVP gong with midcourter Liana Leota winning the award last season.\n\nWith strong competition for places in the Silver Ferns' defensive circle in world championship year, de Bruin set her sights on a strong campaign with Steel. She rated 2011 as one of her finest seasons on the netball court and was now turning her attentions towards backing up last year's Commonwealth Games gold with a world championship title in Singapore in July.\n\n\"I want to be one of those players that makes history in winning a world championship after Commonwealth Games gold.\n\n\" I'm on a mission to make that happen,\" de Bruin said.\n\n\"It's awesome to have so many different styles of play (in our defensive end). We want to win, whatever it takes. We're lucky to have so many options.\"\n\nWith Robyn Broughton not returning as Steel coach next year, de Bruin said she would have to talk to the franchise's new coach and weigh up her options, before committing herself for a third season in the powder blue dress.\n\n\"I haven't thought about it too much. There's still lots to be decided,\" she said.\n\n\"It depends who the coach is and whether they will allow me to commute. There's a lot of unknowns at the moment.

Kimberlee Green, with her lower right leg again strapped, went to wing attack and Kim Ravaillion started at centre. Renae Hallinan was at wing defence.\n\nIt went goal-for-goal early on, until a Geitz tip two minutes in swung the momentum Australia\u2019s way. Another intercept from Australia\u2019s inspirational captain provided the next break and the goalers rewarded their skipper, putting on three unanswered goals to make the score 5-3.\n\nMore Geitz brilliance translated on the scoreboard, thanks to 100% shooting from both Bassett, with 13, and Medhurst, with three, and the quarter finished 16-7.\n\n\u201cOur attackers tonight were sensational,\u201d said Geitz. \u201cThey capitalised on every little tip and touch that we got. That first quarter set us up nicely.\u201d\n\nThe Silver Ferns out-scored Australia by one in the second, with 15 goals, 11 courtesy of Tutaia, who came to life from her favoured long range. At the other end, Bassett continued on her consistent merry way, shooting 14 from 16, while Medhurst didn\u2019t put a shot up.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe supply to the circle was amazing,\u201d Bassett said. \u201cThe girls were bringing the ball down really quick and Nat [Medhurst] was doing a great job of keeping the goal defence busy, which put me in a one-on-one situation, which is perfect.\u201d\n\nWith Australia leading 30-22 at the half, Kiwi coach Waimarama Taumaunu brought Leana de Bruin to goal defence, but it didn\u2019t slow Medhurst, who delivered another four goal assists and six feeds, as well as three goals for the third quarter. Meanwhile, Bassett went back to shooting 100%, knocking down 10 for 37/39 for the game.\n\nThe Kiwis outscored Australia again in the third, getting to within four, but the Diamonds settled and finished the quarter 43-37 up to set up an epic final stanza.\n\nSteady heads and a three-goal run nine minutes in put the score to 52-44 \u2013 and the result out of doubt.\n\nBassett scored 10 in the last quarter and 47 at 94% for the match. Medhurst added five in the last, to finish with 11, at 79% accuracy. Corletto and Geitz\u2019s combined numbers though \u2013 two intercepts and 10 deflections and a swag of rebounds - told a story of complete defensive dominance."}, {"url": "https://canadiansportscene.com/christine-de-bruin-wins-two-world-cup-bobsled-medals-in-latvia/", "page_content": "Christine De Bruin of Edmonton, Alberta won two medals for Canada in bobsled events in Sigulda, Latvia this past weekend.

But I've organised everything for him so hopefully he's not too mad at me. When I get back we'll have another party so he'll actually have more than one birthday.\"\n\nAfter eight up and down years in the black dress, the 34-year-old has finally established herself as New Zealand's top goal keep. And the world's, for that matter.\n\nBut as satisfying as that is, de Bruin does fear the impact netball is beginning to have on her real life.\n\nIt's for those reasons that she'll play for Waikato-Bay of Plenty Magic in next year's trans-Tasman netball league, after two successful seasons commuting to the Southern Steel.\n\n\"He [Caleb] is at an age now that he understands that I leave, but he doesn't quite understand days and how long I'm away for,\" she said.\n\n\"That makes it really hard, especially for the people that have to look after him.\n\n\"Because he's a real mummy's boy at the moment I actually feel more sorry for them.\n\n\"You obviously miss out on a lot when you go away as often as I used to, so I'm definitely looking forward to that not happening as much and only having to drive 10 minutes to training.\"\n\nDe Bruin would like more children, but acknowledges that would probably mean the end of her international netball career.\n\nDespite being five years her senior, Irene van Dyk has indicated she'll have to be dragged out of the black dress kicking and screaming. De Bruin doesn't know how much time she has left as a Silver Fern and gets more uncertain by the day.\n\nTake the 2015 world champs, for example.\n\n\"Um,\" she began. \"It would have been a definite `no' if you'd asked me a month ago. But when I saw the plan for the next four years I got a bit excited again.\n\n\"I still definitely have that fire burning inside of me to win another world champs, so never say never.\"\n\nIn that respect, the Silver Ferns are an admirable lot. There's little money or fame to be derived from playing international netball.\n\nInstead, they do it for the honour of representing their country and because not much in the rest of their lives comes close to the intensity of a match against Australia.\n\nASIDE from saying \"I just love, love that feeling\", de Bruin initially found it hard to describe what a clash with the Diamonds is like.\n\n\"What about this? Have you ever bungy jumped or anything like that? Try that and then come back to me,\" she said.\n\n\"It's pretty much that feeling of `oh shit, here we go'.\"\n\nAway from netball, though, de Bruin prefers a life without high adrenalin. So as much as South Africa, for whom she previously played 34 tests, will always be home, de Bruin doubts she'll ever return for good.\n\n\"That's another one of those questions that's hard to answer. I'm loving New Zealand and the lifestyle suits us very well as a family.\n\n\"It's really nice to visit and to see my family, but to live would be a different story. My brother got hijacked about a month ago and that made me think it was a definite `no' to going back, especially with younger kids.\"\n\nAssuming she ever gets time to expand the family.\n\nAT A GLANCE\n\nName: Leana de Bruin\n\nBorn: Bethlehem, Free State, South Africa\n\nAge: 34\n\nHeight: 1.90m\n\nPosition: Goal keep, goal defence\n\nTest caps: 90 (56 for New Zealand and 34 for South Africa)\n\nHonours: Gold medals at 2003 world championships and 2006 and 2010 Commonwealth Games.
