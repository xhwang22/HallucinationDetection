{"Frederick Thomas Brentnall was a keen advocate of the use of reinforced concrete and natural materials such as brick and stone.": [{"url": "https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/brentnall-frederick-thomas-3050", "page_content": "by Ronald Lawson\n\nFrederick Thomas Brentnall (1834-1925), Wesleyan minister, journalist, company director and politician, was born on 17 June 1834 at Riddings, Derbyshire, England, eldest of the twelve children of George Brentnall, builder, and his wife Mary, n\u00e9e Clarke. He was educated at an endowed school in Alfreton, near Derby. He entered business in Ripley, Derbyshire, but in 1863 was sent to join the Wesleyan Conference of New South Wales and Queensland. After serving on several circuits in New South Wales, in April 1873 he joined the Brisbane circuit, where he quickly made an impact as a forceful and eloquent preacher. He became chairman of the Queensland district, where he was prominent in the formation of a strong loan fund which was to prove important in extending Wesleyan Methodist work in Queensland. He served also in the circuits of Fortitude Valley and Ipswich, and at the Ann Street Church in Brisbane, before a throat infection forced him to retire from the ministry in 1883.\n\nIn 1875, towards the climax of the education controversy in Queensland, Brentnall was instrumental with three other clergymen in establishing the Queensland Evangelical Standard, a journal dedicated to a system of secular education, and thus anti-Catholic in tone. Viewing the 'squatting party' as allies of the Catholics, the Standard adopted a clear political posture, championed the cause of (Sir) Samuel Griffith, a Liberal and son of a Congregational cleric, and poured invective on 'Land Rings and Railway Kings'. Brentnall used his pen with telling effect against the McIlwraith ministry in its handling of the steel rails contract of 1881 and soon afterwards of the land-grant railway proposal.\n\nBrentnall's activity in the business world seems to have been recognized as early as 1881. The Daily Observer, 28 February, openly attacked him in an advertisement: 'Wanted for the Christian Ministry \u2026 Special advantages are now offered to worldly-minded men to join the ranks \u2026 Men of business turn of mind specially eligible for this ministry, and always come to the front. \u201cFervency of spirit\u201d not at all necessary. Shareholders in gold mines, tin mines, newspaper companies, land speculating, and such like heavenly pastures, will always be accepted as specially qualified'. The Standard, smarting under the sarcasm, responded so sharply that its reply led to a libel case. On his retirement from the church Brentnall joined the Telegraph, in which he was a minor shareholder, as a journalist. In 1885 he greatly increased his holdings in the company and became chairman of directors, a position he retained until May 1893, after which he continued to hold a large financial interest. He became increasingly active in business affairs, his directorships included the Queensland Deposit Bank and Building Society, and the Queensland Trustees (later becoming chairman of directors of both companies), Queensland General Insurance, Finney Isles, Coolgarra Tin Mining, Queensland Exploration and Queensland Copper Freeholds. He speculated widely, sometimes successfully, sometimes disastrously, in Queensland mining ventures. He was one of the earliest settlers and landholders at Coorparoo and sold some of his blocks in the boom year of 1888 as it began to emerge as a prestige suburb. He was a member of the Bulimba Divisional Board and for two years first chairman of the Coorparoo Shire Council, where he acted also as shire clerk in 1888-92. In 1886 he had been nominated to the Legislative Council, where he remained active until it was abolished in 1922; in 1893-1902 he was chairman of committees. His political views had gradually become more conservative since the Standard days, especially after the rise of the Labor Party, of which he was an uncompromising enemy. He vigorously opposed 'advanced' legislation and abolition of the Legislative Council. He became a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia (Queensland). He maintained his interest in church life, served on church committees, made settlements on various Methodist institutions, giving them an annual income, and in his will left substantial sums to the Methodist Church.\n\nIn 1867 he married Elizabeth Watson, daughter of a store-keeper in Mansfield, Nottingham. She had left her position as headmistress of a large Wesleyan day school for girls at Bacup, Lancashire, and followed Brentnall to Sydney to marry him. She was the first president of the Queensland Women's Christian Temperance Union, holding office in 1885-99, and then honorary president until her death in 1909. Brentnall died in Brisbane on 11 January 1925, survived by two daughters: Flora, who in 1893 married Edgar Bridal Harris, a shipping agent, and Charlotte Amelia. He left substantial holdings in the Telegraph Newspaper Co. to his family, and his grandson later became chairman of directors."}, {"url": "https://peopleaustralia.anu.edu.au/biography/_-3050", "page_content": "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be aware that this website contains names, images, and voices of deceased persons.\n\nIn addition, some articles contain terms or views that were acceptable within mainstream Australian culture in the period in which they were written, but may no longer be considered appropriate.\n\nThese articles do not necessarily reflect the views of The Australian National University.\n\nOlder articles are being reviewed with a view to bringing them into line with contemporary values but the original text will remain available for historical context."}, {"url": "https://www.womenaustralia.info/leaders/bib/WLP003010.htm", "page_content": "Work on The Encyclopedia of Women and Leadership in Twentieth-Century Australia was undertaken as part of the Australian Research Council's Linkage Projects funding scheme (project number LP100200304).\n\nThe Encyclopedia uses the Online Heritage Resource Manager, a tool developed by the eScholarship Research Centre, part of the University Library at the University of Melbourne.\n\nLicensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n\nWhat do we mean by this?"}, {"url": "https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2010/07/familys-fourth-generation-uq", "page_content": "WHEN Joshua Keyes-Liley received his Bachelor of Arts this week, he was the fourth generation of his family to receive a degree from The University of Queensland.\n\nJoshua's UQ connections actually go back six generations, as his great-great-great-grandfather Frederick Thomas Brentnall was a member of the Queensland Legislative Council in 1910 when the University was established, and often spoke on education issues in the House.\n\nJoshua's great-great-grandmother Flora Harris - FT Brentnall's daughter - was a patron and founder of The Women's College.\n\nJosh's parents, grandmothers and one set of great-grandparents all gained UQ degrees.\n\nHis father, Bill Liley, a doctor at Cairns Base Hospital, has three UQ awards: a Bachelor of Physiotherapy (1983), a Diploma of Education Studies - Counselling (2004) and a Bachelor of Medicine/ Bachelor of Surgery (2008).\n\nDr Liley's mother Margaret Liley (n\u00e9e Price) received her UQ Bachelor of Science in 1957, a Diploma of Education in 1978 and a Bachelor of Education Studies in 1985.\n\nJosh's mother Mary Keyes, a Professor of Law at Griffith University, has two UQ degrees: Arts (1988) and Law (1993).\n\nProfessor Keyes' mother Lynette Keyes (n\u00e9e Denmead) gained her BA from UQ in 1959, and then went on to gain a Diploma of Education in 1960 and a Bachelor of Education in 1963.\n\nMrs Keyes' parents - Josh's great-grandparents - Noela Denmead (n\u00e9e Brentnall) and Alan Knox Denmead both had UQ Science degrees, specialising in Geology.\n\nJosh Keyes-Liley, 20, said there had been no family pressure for him to attend UQ, but it was a good choice.\n\n\"It wasn't a given - I just chose UQ,\" he said.\n\n\"It's been enjoyable and stimulating.

One \u201cstream\u201d was from Germany and Eastern Europe, with two contractors as key actors, Conrad Freytag and Gustav-Adolf Wayss, along with the architect and engineer Matthias Koenen, a university professor who had a special interest in the use of mathematics in construction. Another \u201cstream\u201d was from France and Belgium, with Fran\u00e7ois Hennebique, a contractor who eventually became a designer-developer of this new technology. Parallel to those, the first developments in the USA ought to be mentioned.\n\n3.1 Developments in and from Germany\n\nConrad Freytag (1846\u20131921) Businessman:\n\nConrad Freytag was a German-born businessman, whom along with his brother-in-law, Carl Heidschuch, founded the partnership \u2018Freytag and Heidschuch,\u2019 in 1875, in Neustadt a. d. Haardt (today a. d. Weinstra\u00dfe). The company specialized in \u00ab cement-works \u00bb , namely floor coverings and building-pressed concrete parts (Wayss-und-Freytag-AG 1975). In the beginning, his company had a relatively small range of operation in the Palatinate area, and the areas of Alsace-Lorraine, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, and Hesse in Germany. He first came in contact with Monier patent in 1884, by chance, as he observed a construction site in Trier where iron bars and iron mesh were used within the cement matrix (Ramm 2007). Shortly after, Freytag along with Josseaux, a business associate, travelled to Paris, and they acquired Monier\u2019s patent rights in Germany (Danielewski et al. 1998). Freytag acquired the rights in Southern Germany, as well as the first right of refusal in Northern Germany. Josseaux acquired the rights for the city of Offenbach, and the surrounding 30 kilometres. Ramm (2007) wisely assessed this situation: \u201c\u2026it came to pass that the German rights to a new building method with epoch-defining potential lay in the hands of a small company in Neustadt, one of limited regional influence. This arrangement could have spelled the end of that line of development, had not been for a handful of unexpected events\u201d. Such events led to a close collaboration among Freytag, Wayss, and Koenen. According to Ramm (2007), in 1885, Ways \u201cmet Freytag and his brother-in-law Heidschuch in the hotel \u2018Pf\u00e4lzer Hof\u2019 in Ludwigshafen,\u201d for the purpose of acquiring Monier\u2019s patent right (Danielewski et al. 1998). Freytag and Heidschuch transferred the Monier\u2019s patent right in Germany to Wayss, without any financial compensation. Wayss was at the time a young engineer and the owner of a small construction company in Frankfurt.\n\nFor the purpose of exploiting the newly acquired Monier\u2019s patent, Wayss had envisioned using the iron-reinforced concrete walls for the Reichstag. At the time, Matthias Koenen was in charge of building the basic structure (Ramm 2007), and he had not been previously involved with the new technology proposed by Wayss. From 1886 to 1887, Freytag supported an extensive testing program of concrete slabs, which was organized by Wayss, and was carried out by Koenen. In 1887, Wayss published Koenen\u2019s test results in the well-known Monier-brochure (Wayss 1887). Wayss and Koenen constantly interacted as partners of various companies. Looking back at history, it is clear that Koenen\u2019s early interest in concrete could be traced back directly to Wayss\u2019 entrepreneur spirit. In 1901, Emil M\u00f6rsch joined the company as director of the technical office, resulting in further developments of iron reinforced concrete.\n\nMatthias Koenen (1849\u20131924), Engineer:\n\nKoenen, a German engineer, born in Bedburg near Cologne, is credited with having calculated for the first time the capacity of an iron reinforced concrete element. The method was found to be quite accurate, as additional testing later corroborated it. Koenen published his method in the paper \u2018Centralblatt der Bauverwaltung\u2019 (Koenen 1886). According to Ramm (2007), \u201cthe short notice, published under the title \u201cBerechnung der St\u00e4rke der Monierschen Cementplatten\u201d (\u201cMeasuring the strength of Monier\u2019s Concrete slabs\u201d), was only half a column long, and contained the first numerical calculation of a reinforced slab, or of any iron-reinforced concrete component for that matter, ever made\u201d.\n\nKoenen assumed a linear distribution of stresses, with the central axis located in the middle of the cross-section. He used a lever-arm equal to three-quarters of the slab\u2019s thickness, and he recognized earlier on that the tensile force in tension zone could be neglected (Ramm 2007).\n\n3.2 Developments in and from France and Belgium\n\nFran\u00e7ois Hennebique (1842\u20131921) Inventor and International Entrepreneur:\n\nFran\u00e7ois Hennebique was born in Neuville Saint Vaast, in the north of France, in 1842. He was trained as a \u201cma\u00e7on\u201d (masonry craftsman) and funded his own business in Brussels in 1867 when he was 25. He later moved to Paris, in 1887. During the 1870s, he started to be interested in the methods developed by Monier and used reinforced concrete for the first time in 1879 with the construction of a concrete slab. According to his records, he had the first intuition of his \u00ab system \u00bb when he started the design and construction of the Mendock Castle, near Selzaete in Belgium, which had been commissioned by Mr. Van Overloop. This process is described in details in (Delhumeau 1999), in a chapter entitled \u201cMyth and Reality.\u201d It is on this occasion, in 1879, that he decided to replace I-beams embedded in concrete (to create a fireproof roof) by a combination of tension and compression bars connected by spacers made of perforated steel plates. Later on, in 1880, at the same site, when building the Castel gardener house, he went one step further and replaced the perforated steel plates spacers by stirrups, which were to become the distinctive element of his system. He kept developing his system during the 1880s and successively took out three patents:\n\nA first patent, taken in 1886 in Brussels, describes hollow concrete beams, reinforced with longitudinal bars connected by spacers. These beams, 50 cm wide, pre-fabricated and assembled side by side, were meant to compete against steel floors. They looked like what we call today hollow core beams. Each 50 cm wide element had three voids and four webs.\n\nA second patent, taken in 1892, also in Brussels, on the 8th of February, described a significantly different floor system: it comprised trapezoidal beams supporting a thin slab, cast into a folded thin steel plate, and reinforced with bars, which might be welded to the steel plates.\n\nA third patent, taken in Paris on the 8th of August 1892, described a system similar to that presented in the second patent, which allowed the standardization of the system by introducing some insight into the way this composite material worked.\n\nHennebique\u2019s contribution to reinforced concrete went far beyond the content of his patents. After combining masonry and reinforced concrete earlier on, he developed and applied the concept of monolithic and continuous reinforced concrete structures, similar to that used in steel structures. This idea of a monolithic structure had been in the minds of architects and builders as early as the 17th Century. Claude Perrault had written in Les dix livres d\u2019architecture de Vitruve, edited in 1673: \u201cIt is also a great beauty to a building to appear to be made of only one stone.\u201d Fran\u00e7ois Coignet stated, in 1861, in B\u00e9tons agglom\u00e9r\u00e9s appliqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art de construire: \u201cA house, a monument, a quay, a dike (\u2026) constructed by this process, would, in reality, constitute in their entire mass a single block, a monolith\u201d.\n\nHennebique was not only a creative designer and builder but also an entrepreneur. He developed a large international business organization, in a very modern way, with a network of agents and licensed contractors located on all continents. He had also a strong communication approach, with the publication of numerous brochures that presented in a very detailed way his system. He created in 1898 a technical magazine, \u201cle b\u00e9ton arm\u00e9\u201d, presenting and promoting his systems and the works of licensed contractors. From the 1st of June 1898 to the 1st of August 1939, 378 issues were published, having 3000 to 10000 of them distributed all over the world. These documents are part of the Hennebique\u2019s archives that are conserved at the Institut National d\u2019Architecture in Paris, and they constitute the largest documentation available on the development of reinforced concrete during this period.\n\nCreated in 1892, Hennebique\u2019s organization operated from Brussels and Paris. It provided not only design and consultancy services to his network of agents and licensees, but also technical assistance, through the production of detailed procedures, and by deploying highly qualified personnel that were able to train the staff of his clients into these new technologies.\n\nIn some instances, his agents became leaders of the reinforced concrete technology in their respective countries: Louis-Gustave Mouchel in England, Samuel de Mollins in Switzerland, Eduard Zublin and Max Pommer in Germany, Porchedeu in Italy.\n\n3.3 Developments in the United States of America\n\nErnest Leslie Ransome (1852\u20131917):\n\nE L Ransome was an English-born engineer and architect, who played a key role in the establishment and development of reinforced concrete in the USA. He was the son of Frederick Ransome, who had patented a process for producing artificial stone in 1844. By the 1870s, he had moved to the USA and was the superintendent of the Pacific Stone Company in San Francisco. In 1884, after experimenting with reinforced concrete sidewalks, he patented a system of ferro-concrete with the iron rods twisted to improve the bond, which led to the patented Ransome system for practical reinforced concrete construction. In 1886 Ransome built two small underpass bridges at the Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, which are the first reinforced concrete bridges in North America, and among the first three or four in the world. Both bridges are still in service. After a long string of accomplishments, Ransome continued to meet with scepticism and resistance. But his techniques were vindicated in 1902, when his 1897 Pacific Coast Borax Refinery in Bayonne, NJ, went through a massive building fire hot enough to melt brass. The concrete frame was only slightly damaged, and thereby his concrete framed industrial architecture approach was shown to have a key superiority over competing steel and iron-framed structures.\n\nLikewise, Ransome\u2019s two experimental buildings at Stanford survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake essentially without damage while the university\u2019s newer conventional brick structures crumbled around them. The published analysis of these two buildings by fellow engineer John B. Leonard did much to advance the safety of buildings in post-1906 San Francisco and nationwide.\n\nIn his later career, Ransome focused on mixing equipment, formwork, and integrated building systems. In 1912 Ransome and Alexis Saurbrey co-authored Reinforced Concrete Buildings."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/frederick.brentnall/2450076", "page_content": "Frederick Brentnall\n\npolitician\n\nJune 17, 1834 (age 90)\n\nHonorary Brentnall was sent by the British Wesleyan Conference to New South Wales in 1863 to join the ranks of the Wesleyan ministry in that colony.

He was 89.\n\nHis son, Alan Buergenthal, confirmed the death but no cause was given.\n\nOver more than four decades, Dr. Buergenthal had a major role in establishing the framework of international jurisprudence, building off U.N. declarations since the 1960s often called the \u201cInternational Bill of Human Rights.\u201d In 1992, the United States ratified the core document, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nBut Dr. Buergenthal, who emigrated to the United States in 1951, also confronted the paradox that his adopted country \u2014 along with some others \u2014 refused to recognize the full legal authority of many of the panels he served, including the International Court of Justice, or ICJ, based at The Hague. The United States has long asserted that international tribunals could place Americans, including U.S. troops, in legal peril and put U.S. sovereignty in question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr. Buergenthal countered that the United States betrayed its own principles with an \u201calmost messianic and fanatical opposition\u201d to U.N.-backed institutions such as the International Criminal Court. \u201cWhat is objectionable,\u201d he said at American University\u2019s commencement in 2002, \u201cis that we are pursuing these policies without giving serious thought to their consequences in undermining the international rule of law.\u201d\n\nA telephone chat in early 1979 changed the course of Dr. Buergenthal\u2019s career. He was teaching at the University of Texas Law School in Austin. His lectures included analyses of the newly created Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which was supported by most nations in Latin America but not the United States, Canada and some other countries in the hemisphere.\n\nOne afternoon, a call came from the Costa Rican ambassador to the United States, offering a spot on the court. At first Dr. Buergenthal thought it was a prank by one of his students. He called the Costa Rica Embassy, expecting to be laughed at. \u201cA few months later,\u201d he said, \u201cI was elected to the court.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the first cases before the court involved allegations of rights abuses by U.S.-allied governments in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras against leftist guerrillas and their supporters. Dr. Buergenthal called the cases \u201clandmark events\u201d in helping establish legal precedents in international justice.\n\nOne inquest \u2014 the disappearance of suspected government opponents in Honduras \u2014 led to completely new interpretations of the burden of proof. Dr. Buergenthal and the other judges on the court recognized the difficulty of finding specific evidence to incriminate state-backed death squads.\n\n\u201cWhich is precisely why some governments engage in the practice,\u201d said Dr. Buergenthal, who served on roles in the court from 1979 to 1991.\n\nThe court decided that it could consider the overall pattern of disappearances, setting what Dr. Buergenthal called a \u201crebuttable presumption\u201d of government involvement.

Although the United States doesn\u2019t recognize the full jurisdiction of the ICJ, the court at times seeks to use its opinions to potentially influence U.S. policy or legal proceedings.\n\nOne case during Dr. Buergenthal\u2019s tenure on the court, from 2000 to 2010, made its way the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2003, the ICJ concluded that the United States had violated the Vienna Convention by failing to tell more than 50 Mexicans charged with capital crimes that they had a right to meet with Mexican diplomats. One of the suspects, Jos\u00e9 Ernesto Medell\u00edn, filed a suit in Texas arguing that his prosecution should be thrown out. The Supreme Court in 2005, on a 5-4 decision, kicked the case back to Texas courts. Medell\u00edn, who was convicted of two murders, was executed in 2008 after a second appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court.\n\nOn one issue, Dr. Buergenthal broke with the rest of the 15-judge panel.

The court said that Israel violated international law with the parts of the barrier that crossed into Palestinian territory.\n\nDr. Buergenthal wrote that he agreed with much of the ICJ\u2019s decision, noting that the wall raised \u201cserious questions as a matter of international law.\u201d He believed, however, that the court did not have enough facts to issue a judgment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Zurich, he was vice chairman of the Claims Resolution Tribunal, which examined requests made by the families of Holocaust victims seeking assets deposited in Swiss banks until 1945.

They were rounded up and eventually shipped to the Birkenau concentration camp, next to Auschwitz, in August 1944.\n\nThe young Dr. Buergenthal was picked as an errand boy for a camp commander, a decision that likely saved his life. Some of his jobs included gathering the empty canisters used in the camp\u2019s gas chambers. His father was later sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp, where he perished.\n\nAs the Soviet army pushed toward Germany in early 1945, Dr. Buergenthal and thousands of other prisoners were put on a forced march to another camp, Sachsenhausen, more than 350 miles away.

He was educated at an endowed school in Alfreton, near Derby. He entered business in Ripley, Derbyshire, but in 1863 was sent to join the Wesleyan Conference of New South Wales and Queensland. After serving on several circuits in New South Wales, in April 1873 he joined the Brisbane circuit, where he quickly made an impact as a forceful and eloquent preacher. He became chairman of the Queensland district, where he was prominent in the formation of a strong loan fund which was to prove important in extending Wesleyan Methodist work in Queensland. He served also in the circuits of Fortitude Valley and Ipswich, and at the Ann Street Church in Brisbane, before a throat infection forced him to retire from the ministry in 1883.\n\nIn 1875, towards the climax of the education controversy in Queensland, Brentnall was instrumental with three other clergymen in establishing the Queensland Evangelical Standard, a journal dedicated to a system of secular education, and thus anti-Catholic in tone. Viewing the 'squatting party' as allies of the Catholics, the Standard adopted a clear political posture, championed the cause of (Sir) Samuel Griffith, a Liberal and son of a Congregational cleric, and poured invective on 'Land Rings and Railway Kings'. Brentnall used his pen with telling effect against the McIlwraith ministry in its handling of the steel rails contract of 1881 and soon afterwards of the land-grant railway proposal.\n\nBrentnall's activity in the business world seems to have been recognized as early as 1881. The Daily Observer, 28 February, openly attacked him in an advertisement: 'Wanted for the Christian Ministry \u2026 Special advantages are now offered to worldly-minded men to join the ranks \u2026 Men of business turn of mind specially eligible for this ministry, and always come to the front. \u201cFervency of spirit\u201d not at all necessary. Shareholders in gold mines, tin mines, newspaper companies, land speculating, and such like heavenly pastures, will always be accepted as specially qualified'. The Standard, smarting under the sarcasm, responded so sharply that its reply led to a libel case. On his retirement from the church Brentnall joined the Telegraph, in which he was a minor shareholder, as a journalist. In 1885 he greatly increased his holdings in the company and became chairman of directors, a position he retained until May 1893, after which he continued to hold a large financial interest. He became increasingly active in business affairs, his directorships included the Queensland Deposit Bank and Building Society, and the Queensland Trustees (later becoming chairman of directors of both companies), Queensland General Insurance, Finney Isles, Coolgarra Tin Mining, Queensland Exploration and Queensland Copper Freeholds. He speculated widely, sometimes successfully, sometimes disastrously, in Queensland mining ventures. He was one of the earliest settlers and landholders at Coorparoo and sold some of his blocks in the boom year of 1888 as it began to emerge as a prestige suburb. He was a member of the Bulimba Divisional Board and for two years first chairman of the Coorparoo Shire Council, where he acted also as shire clerk in 1888-92. In 1886 he had been nominated to the Legislative Council, where he remained active until it was abolished in 1922; in 1893-1902 he was chairman of committees. His political views had gradually become more conservative since the Standard days, especially after the rise of the Labor Party, of which he was an uncompromising enemy. He vigorously opposed 'advanced' legislation and abolition of the Legislative Council. He became a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia (Queensland). He maintained his interest in church life, served on church committees, made settlements on various Methodist institutions, giving them an annual income, and in his will left substantial sums to the Methodist Church.\n\nIn 1867 he married Elizabeth Watson, daughter of a store-keeper in Mansfield, Nottingham. She had left her position as headmistress of a large Wesleyan day school for girls at Bacup, Lancashire, and followed Brentnall to Sydney to marry him. She was the first president of the Queensland Women's Christian Temperance Union, holding office in 1885-99, and then honorary president until her death in 1909. Brentnall died in Brisbane on 11 January 1925, survived by two daughters: Flora, who in 1893 married Edgar Bridal Harris, a shipping agent, and Charlotte Amelia. He left substantial holdings in the Telegraph Newspaper Co. to his family, and his grandson later became chairman of directors."}, {"url": "https://peopleaustralia.anu.edu.au/biography/brentnall-frederick-thomas-3050", "page_content": "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be aware that this website contains names, images, and voices of deceased persons.\n\nIn addition, some articles contain terms or views that were acceptable within mainstream Australian culture in the period in which they were written, but may no longer be considered appropriate.\n\nThese articles do not necessarily reflect the views of The Australian National University.\n\nOlder articles are being reviewed with a view to bringing them into line with contemporary values but the original text will remain available for historical context."}, {"url": "https://adb.anu.edu.au/lifesummary/brentnall-frederick-thomas-3050", "page_content": "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be aware that this website contains names, images, and voices of deceased persons.\n\nIn addition, some articles contain terms or views that were acceptable within mainstream Australian culture in the period in which they were written, but may no longer be considered appropriate.\n\nThese articles do not necessarily reflect the views of The Australian National University.\n\nOlder articles are being reviewed with a view to bringing them into line with contemporary values but the original text will remain available for historical context."}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-59471-2_316", "page_content": "In Europe, there appear to be two main \u201cstreams\u201d in these developments. One \u201cstream\u201d was from Germany and Eastern Europe, with two contractors as key actors, Conrad Freytag and Gustav-Adolf Wayss, along with the architect and engineer Matthias Koenen, a university professor who had a special interest in the use of mathematics in construction. Another \u201cstream\u201d was from France and Belgium, with Fran\u00e7ois Hennebique, a contractor who eventually became a designer-developer of this new technology. Parallel to those, the first developments in the USA ought to be mentioned.\n\n3.1 Developments in and from Germany\n\nConrad Freytag (1846\u20131921) Businessman:\n\nConrad Freytag was a German-born businessman, whom along with his brother-in-law, Carl Heidschuch, founded the partnership \u2018Freytag and Heidschuch,\u2019 in 1875, in Neustadt a. d. Haardt (today a. d. Weinstra\u00dfe). The company specialized in \u00ab cement-works \u00bb , namely floor coverings and building-pressed concrete parts (Wayss-und-Freytag-AG 1975). In the beginning, his company had a relatively small range of operation in the Palatinate area, and the areas of Alsace-Lorraine, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, and Hesse in Germany. He first came in contact with Monier patent in 1884, by chance, as he observed a construction site in Trier where iron bars and iron mesh were used within the cement matrix (Ramm 2007). Shortly after, Freytag along with Josseaux, a business associate, travelled to Paris, and they acquired Monier\u2019s patent rights in Germany (Danielewski et al. 1998). Freytag acquired the rights in Southern Germany, as well as the first right of refusal in Northern Germany. Josseaux acquired the rights for the city of Offenbach, and the surrounding 30 kilometres. Ramm (2007) wisely assessed this situation: \u201c\u2026it came to pass that the German rights to a new building method with epoch-defining potential lay in the hands of a small company in Neustadt, one of limited regional influence. This arrangement could have spelled the end of that line of development, had not been for a handful of unexpected events\u201d. Such events led to a close collaboration among Freytag, Wayss, and Koenen. According to Ramm (2007), in 1885, Ways \u201cmet Freytag and his brother-in-law Heidschuch in the hotel \u2018Pf\u00e4lzer Hof\u2019 in Ludwigshafen,\u201d for the purpose of acquiring Monier\u2019s patent right (Danielewski et al. 1998). Freytag and Heidschuch transferred the Monier\u2019s patent right in Germany to Wayss, without any financial compensation. Wayss was at the time a young engineer and the owner of a small construction company in Frankfurt.\n\nFor the purpose of exploiting the newly acquired Monier\u2019s patent, Wayss had envisioned using the iron-reinforced concrete walls for the Reichstag. At the time, Matthias Koenen was in charge of building the basic structure (Ramm 2007), and he had not been previously involved with the new technology proposed by Wayss. From 1886 to 1887, Freytag supported an extensive testing program of concrete slabs, which was organized by Wayss, and was carried out by Koenen. In 1887, Wayss published Koenen\u2019s test results in the well-known Monier-brochure (Wayss 1887). Wayss and Koenen constantly interacted as partners of various companies. Looking back at history, it is clear that Koenen\u2019s early interest in concrete could be traced back directly to Wayss\u2019 entrepreneur spirit. In 1901, Emil M\u00f6rsch joined the company as director of the technical office, resulting in further developments of iron reinforced concrete.\n\nMatthias Koenen (1849\u20131924), Engineer:\n\nKoenen, a German engineer, born in Bedburg near Cologne, is credited with having calculated for the first time the capacity of an iron reinforced concrete element. The method was found to be quite accurate, as additional testing later corroborated it. Koenen published his method in the paper \u2018Centralblatt der Bauverwaltung\u2019 (Koenen 1886). According to Ramm (2007), \u201cthe short notice, published under the title \u201cBerechnung der St\u00e4rke der Monierschen Cementplatten\u201d (\u201cMeasuring the strength of Monier\u2019s Concrete slabs\u201d), was only half a column long, and contained the first numerical calculation of a reinforced slab, or of any iron-reinforced concrete component for that matter, ever made\u201d.\n\nKoenen assumed a linear distribution of stresses, with the central axis located in the middle of the cross-section. He used a lever-arm equal to three-quarters of the slab\u2019s thickness, and he recognized earlier on that the tensile force in tension zone could be neglected (Ramm 2007).\n\n3.2 Developments in and from France and Belgium\n\nFran\u00e7ois Hennebique (1842\u20131921) Inventor and International Entrepreneur:\n\nFran\u00e7ois Hennebique was born in Neuville Saint Vaast, in the north of France, in 1842. He was trained as a \u201cma\u00e7on\u201d (masonry craftsman) and funded his own business in Brussels in 1867 when he was 25. He later moved to Paris, in 1887. During the 1870s, he started to be interested in the methods developed by Monier and used reinforced concrete for the first time in 1879 with the construction of a concrete slab. According to his records, he had the first intuition of his \u00ab system \u00bb when he started the design and construction of the Mendock Castle, near Selzaete in Belgium, which had been commissioned by Mr. Van Overloop. This process is described in details in (Delhumeau 1999), in a chapter entitled \u201cMyth and Reality.\u201d It is on this occasion, in 1879, that he decided to replace I-beams embedded in concrete (to create a fireproof roof) by a combination of tension and compression bars connected by spacers made of perforated steel plates. Later on, in 1880, at the same site, when building the Castel gardener house, he went one step further and replaced the perforated steel plates spacers by stirrups, which were to become the distinctive element of his system. He kept developing his system during the 1880s and successively took out three patents:\n\nA first patent, taken in 1886 in Brussels, describes hollow concrete beams, reinforced with longitudinal bars connected by spacers. These beams, 50 cm wide, pre-fabricated and assembled side by side, were meant to compete against steel floors. They looked like what we call today hollow core beams. Each 50 cm wide element had three voids and four webs.\n\nA second patent, taken in 1892, also in Brussels, on the 8th of February, described a significantly different floor system: it comprised trapezoidal beams supporting a thin slab, cast into a folded thin steel plate, and reinforced with bars, which might be welded to the steel plates.\n\nA third patent, taken in Paris on the 8th of August 1892, described a system similar to that presented in the second patent, which allowed the standardization of the system by introducing some insight into the way this composite material worked.\n\nHennebique\u2019s contribution to reinforced concrete went far beyond the content of his patents. After combining masonry and reinforced concrete earlier on, he developed and applied the concept of monolithic and continuous reinforced concrete structures, similar to that used in steel structures. This idea of a monolithic structure had been in the minds of architects and builders as early as the 17th Century. Claude Perrault had written in Les dix livres d\u2019architecture de Vitruve, edited in 1673: \u201cIt is also a great beauty to a building to appear to be made of only one stone.\u201d Fran\u00e7ois Coignet stated, in 1861, in B\u00e9tons agglom\u00e9r\u00e9s appliqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art de construire: \u201cA house, a monument, a quay, a dike (\u2026) constructed by this process, would, in reality, constitute in their entire mass a single block, a monolith\u201d.\n\nHennebique was not only a creative designer and builder but also an entrepreneur. He developed a large international business organization, in a very modern way, with a network of agents and licensed contractors located on all continents. He had also a strong communication approach, with the publication of numerous brochures that presented in a very detailed way his system. He created in 1898 a technical magazine, \u201cle b\u00e9ton arm\u00e9\u201d, presenting and promoting his systems and the works of licensed contractors. From the 1st of June 1898 to the 1st of August 1939, 378 issues were published, having 3000 to 10000 of them distributed all over the world. These documents are part of the Hennebique\u2019s archives that are conserved at the Institut National d\u2019Architecture in Paris, and they constitute the largest documentation available on the development of reinforced concrete during this period.\n\nCreated in 1892, Hennebique\u2019s organization operated from Brussels and Paris. It provided not only design and consultancy services to his network of agents and licensees, but also technical assistance, through the production of detailed procedures, and by deploying highly qualified personnel that were able to train the staff of his clients into these new technologies.\n\nIn some instances, his agents became leaders of the reinforced concrete technology in their respective countries: Louis-Gustave Mouchel in England, Samuel de Mollins in Switzerland, Eduard Zublin and Max Pommer in Germany, Porchedeu in Italy.\n\n3.3 Developments in the United States of America\n\nErnest Leslie Ransome (1852\u20131917):\n\nE L Ransome was an English-born engineer and architect, who played a key role in the establishment and development of reinforced concrete in the USA. He was the son of Frederick Ransome, who had patented a process for producing artificial stone in 1844. By the 1870s, he had moved to the USA and was the superintendent of the Pacific Stone Company in San Francisco. In 1884, after experimenting with reinforced concrete sidewalks, he patented a system of ferro-concrete with the iron rods twisted to improve the bond, which led to the patented Ransome system for practical reinforced concrete construction. In 1886 Ransome built two small underpass bridges at the Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, which are the first reinforced concrete bridges in North America, and among the first three or four in the world. Both bridges are still in service. After a long string of accomplishments, Ransome continued to meet with scepticism and resistance. But his techniques were vindicated in 1902, when his 1897 Pacific Coast Borax Refinery in Bayonne, NJ, went through a massive building fire hot enough to melt brass. The concrete frame was only slightly damaged, and thereby his concrete framed industrial architecture approach was shown to have a key superiority over competing steel and iron-framed structures.\n\nLikewise, Ransome\u2019s two experimental buildings at Stanford survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake essentially without damage while the university\u2019s newer conventional brick structures crumbled around them. The published analysis of these two buildings by fellow engineer John B. Leonard did much to advance the safety of buildings in post-1906 San Francisco and nationwide.\n\nIn his later career, Ransome focused on mixing equipment, formwork, and integrated building systems. In 1912 Ransome and Alexis Saurbrey co-authored Reinforced Concrete Buildings."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/frederick.brentnall/2450076", "page_content": "Frederick Brentnall\n\npolitician\n\nJune 17, 1834 (age 90)\n\nHonorary Brentnall was sent by the British Wesleyan Conference to New South Wales in 1863 to join the ranks of the Wesleyan ministry in that colony.

By offering a profoundly different building technique to architects and engineers, it has significantly altered the way in which buildings are designed and constructed in the modern age. To adequately appreciate concrete and its significance in modern architecture, it is worth noting several important uses of concrete in modern construction, as well as addressing the criticisms and duologies which concrete presents.\n\nConcrete, and in particular reinforced concrete, has permitted architects and architecture to explore new realms of design and construction. Prior to the advent of reinforced concrete \u2013 concrete surrounding an inner, reinforcing frame \u2013 structures were restricted by the weight the materials could hold, and as such were unable to rise as tall or assume the unique forms which were to come later. Concrete contributed to the creation of skyscrapers, stronger bridges, and several other new and modern forms. Several architects, including Le Corbusier, Louis Kahn, and Frank Lloyd Wright adopted the use of concrete in their designs and proliferated its use. Le Corbusier constructed such buildings as the Unit\u00e9 d\u2019Habitation, which used b\u00e9ton brut as its primary material, and the Chapel of Notre-Dame-du-Haut, which featured a dynamic and sweeping use of concrete, as well as pioneered the International Style, which emphasized inner concrete structure such as piloti and open plans. Louis Kahn was significant for his monumental style and use of concrete in buildings such as the Salk Institute and Yale University Art Gallery. Frank Lloyd Wright was a pioneer of the cantilever in his buildings, which required the use of reinforced concrete. Figure 1 illustrates the b\u00e9ton brut of the Unit\u00e9 d\u2019Habitation and Figure 2 shows an example of Wright\u2019s cantilever in practice. These examples illustrate how concrete was used in the twentieth century, and how important it was to modern construction in general.\n\nConcrete\u2019s importance and ubiquity leads to several criticisms and questions regarding its use in the modern age. Specifically, the use of concrete raises questions of modern versus un-modern, natural versus unnatural, and international versus local. The first duology, modern versus un-modern, concerns how concrete is used in construction. Because of how ubiquitous and flexible it is as a material, concrete can be used in many ways; in its most eccentric uses it assumes the modern forms such as those described above from Le Corbusier, Kahn, and Wright, but in its most basic uses it can be merely an un-modern, common building material like any other \u2013 like brick, stone, or marble, for example. Because concrete is used in such dynamic ways and in so many places, this criticism is often raised.\n\nNext, it is unclear whether or not concrete is a natural or unnatural material. It is clear why concrete would be unnatural: it is a constructed material from many aggregated sources and is often used to cover nature, as it is often employed in many urban landscapes. However, as Adrian Forty argues, there are many aspects of concrete which are highly natural. Concrete is essentially formless, and as such can be manipulated into varied forms, including ones which imitate nature and other materials such as wood, brick, or metal. Le Corbusier\u2019s own satisfaction with the naturalness of Unit\u00e9 d\u2019Habitiation\u2019s b\u00e9ton brut demonstrates how concrete can be natural. Figure 3 provides a clear example of how concrete can assume natural forms, in this case those of wood. The dynamic and formless properties of concrete allow one to examine how concrete is used, and draw conclusions about its use and affect.\n\nFinally, concrete has a problem with its international versus local scope. Concrete features heavily in the International Style and in construction of buildings with conventionally modern and international typologies, lending to a classification as a global material, widely capable of usage anywhere in the world. However, this usage comes at the cost of indigenous materials and vernacular styles, as concrete replaces local materials out of its inexpensive cost and ease of use. This conflict between universal versus local causes one to think critically about how concrete can and should be used in construction.\n\nConcrete is doubtless on of the most important building materials of the twentieth century. It is completely ubiquitous and raises questions and issues which shed light on its use as a material.\n\n-JH\n\nNotes:\n\nFigure 1: Vincent Desjardins, l\u2019Unit\u00e9 d\u2019Habitation de Grandeur Conforme.

The reinforcement is usually, though not necessarily, steel reinforcing bars (rebar) and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before the concrete sets. Reinforcing schemes are generally designed to resist tensile stresses in particular regions of the concrete that might cause unacceptable cracking and/or structural failure. Modern reinforced concrete can contain varied reinforcing materials made of steel, polymers or alternate composite material in conjunction with rebar or not. Reinforced concrete may also be permanently stressed (in compression), so as to improve the behaviour of the final structure under working loads. In the United States, the most common methods of doing this are known as pre-tensioning and post-tensioning.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a strong, ductile and durable construction the reinforcement needs to have the following properties at least:\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh relative strength\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh toleration of tensile strain\n\n\n\n\n\nGood bond to the concrete, irrespective of pH, moisture, and similar factors\n\n\n\n\n\nThermal compatibility, not causing unacceptable stresses in response to changing temperatures.\n\n\n\n\n\nDurability in the concrete environment, irrespective of corrosion or sustained stress for example.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\n\n\nFran\u00e7ois Coignet was a French industrialist of the nineteenth century, a pioneer in the development of structural, prefabricated and reinforced concrete.Coignet was the first to use iron-reinforced concrete as a technique for constructing building structures.In 1853 Coignet built the first iron reinforced concrete structure, a four story house at 72 rue Charles Michels in the suburbs of Paris.Coignet's descriptions of reinforcing concrete suggests that he did not do it for means of adding strength to the concrete but for keeping walls in monolithic construction from overturning.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseph Monier, a French gardener and known to be one of the principal inventors of reinforced concrete, was granted a patent for reinforced flowerpots by means of mixing a wire mesh to a mortar shell. In 1877, Monier was granted another patent for a more advanced technique of reinforcing concrete columns and girders with iron rods placed in a grid pattern. Though Monier undoubtedly knew reinforcing concrete would improve its inner cohesion, it is less known if he even knew how much reinforcing actually improved concrete's tensile strength.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore 1877 the use of concrete construction, though dating back to the Roman Empire and reintroduced in the mid to late 1800s, was not yet a proven scientific technology. American New Yorker Thaddeus Hyatt published a report titled An Account of Some Experiments with Portland-Cement-Concrete Combined with Iron as a Building Material, with Reference to Economy of Metal in Construction and for Security against Fire in the Making of Roofs, Floors, and Walking Surfaces where he stated his experiments on the behavior of reinforced concrete. His work played a major role in the evolution of concrete construction as a proven and studied science. Without Hyatt's work, more dangerous trial and error methods would have largely been depended on for the advancement in the technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nG. A. Wayss, was a German civil engineer and a pioneer of the iron and steel concrete construction. In 1879 Wayss bought the German rights to Monier's patents and in 1884 started the first commercial use for reinforced concrete in his firm Wayss & Freytag. Up until the 1890s Wayss and his firm greatly contributed to the advancement of Monier's system of reinforcing and established it as a well-developed scientific technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nErnest L. Ransome, was an English-born engineer and early innovator of the reinforced concrete techniques in the end of the 19th century. With the knowledge of reinforced concrete developed during the previous 50 years, Ransome innovated nearly all styles and techniques of the previous known inventors of reinforced concrete. Ransome's key innovation was to twist the reinforcing steel bar improving bonding with the concrete.\n\n\n\n\n\nGaining increasing fame from his concrete constructed buildings Ransome was able to build two of the first reinforced concrete bridges in North America.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse in construction\n\n\n\n\n\nMany different types of structures and components of structures can be built using reinforced concrete including slabs, walls, beams, columns, foundations, frames and more.\n\n\n\n\n\nReinforced concrete can be classified as precast or cast-in-place concrete.\n\n\n\n\n\nDesigning and implementing the most efficient floor system is key to creating optimal building structures. Small changes in the design of a floor system can have significant impact on material costs, construction schedule, ultimate strength, operating costs, occupancy levels and end use of a building.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout reinforcement, constructing modern structures with concrete material would not be possible.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/PR00177b.htm", "page_content": "Forceful, eminently capable and with fine organisational ability, Elizabeth Brentnall had been mistress of a large girl's school before her marriage.
