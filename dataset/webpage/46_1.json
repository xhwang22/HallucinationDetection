{"Lionel Aldridge played defensive end for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL) from 1963 to 1971.": [{"url": "https://www.packers.com/history/hof/lionel-aldridge", "page_content": "Lionel Aldridge\n\nInducted: 1988\n\nDefensive End: 1963-71\n\nHeight: 6'3\"; Weight: 254\n\nCollege: Utah State, 1960-62\n\nHONORS:\n\nPackers All-Modern Era Team: 1976\n\nWhile Vince Lombardi believed in aggressively overturning his roster each year to instill a mix of youth and keep his veterans on edge, he was wary of playing rookies. During Lombardi's nine years as coach of the Packers, Lionel Aldridge was the only rookie to start a season opener.\n\nAlthough Aldridge might have been more steady than spectacular over the course of his career, Lombardi's early faith in him was a tribute in itself. In fact, Aldridge started the first 45 games of his career under Lombardi before missing the fourth game of the 1966 season with an ankle injury.\n\nAfter the Packers won a second consecutive NFL championship in 1962, Lombardi traded veteran Bill Quinlan and created an opening at right defensive end with no obvious heir apparent. Veteran free agent Urban Henry, who wasn't re-signed by the Los Angeles Rams after missing the 1962 season with a neck injury, and No. 1 draft pick Dave Robinson were considered the frontrunners heading into camp. However, the Packers decided to play Robinson at linebacker when he reported late following the College All-Star Game and Aldridge beat out Henry.\n\nAldridge came into his own when the Packers won an unprecedented three straight NFL championships under the league's playoff format from 1965 to 1967. He started all eight postseason games during that stretch and then continued to hold forth at right end until midway through the 1971 season.\n\nOver his eight-and-a-half years as an established starter, Aldridge missed only three games, a notable achievement when you consider he broke his leg once and had some ankle issues. The worst of his injuries occurred in a mid-August preseason game in 1967 when Aldridge broke a bone in his lower left leg. He missed only the first two regular-season games, didn't start but appeared in the third, and then played roughly three-quarters of the game in a hard-fought victory over Detroit in Week 4. Lombardi, who had little compassion for injured players and rarely saluted them when they played hurt, heaped praise on Aldridge after the game. \"Aldridge deserves a lot of credit for the way he came back so fast from his injury,\" Lombardi said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/14/sports/lionel-aldridge-56-stalwart-on-defense-for-packer-teams.html", "page_content": "Lionel Aldridge, a defensive star on the great Green Bay Packers teams of the 1960's whose post-playing years were marked by mental illness, was found dead by a daughter in his suburban Milwaukee apartment Thursday night.

But a battle with mental illness led him to disappear for years, until he recovered sufficiently to come back to prominence here in the 1990s.\n\nBut there is a lot to the story of the late Lionel Aldridge that is not well-known. And to understand it, you also need to learn another story \u2013 that of his former wife, Vicky. Milwaukee Magazine senior editor Howie Magner writes about both of them in a remarkable article in the January issue, and he joined Lake Effect's Mitch Teich in the studio to give a preview.\n\n\"I don't think they set out to be pioneers when they ended up being basically the first interracial marriage in the NFL. But they were two people who fell in love and if they were going to be together, and Lionel was going to play the sport that he loved at the highest level, then they basically had to be pioneers,\" Magner said."}, {"url": "https://thesporting.blog/blog/the-end-of-the-line-the-rise-and-fall-and-rise-again-of-lionel-aldridge", "page_content": "And then Lionel Aldridge did something that made him realize he had more of a problem than just giving up the game of football.\n\nOn August 31, 1977, the Milwaukee Journal published the following report: \u201cLionel Aldridge, 36, was taken to County General Hospitals\u2019 psychiatric emergency ward Tuesday night after he injured the couple\u2019s poodle outside the home of his estranged wife, Vicki, 33.\n\nAbout 11:15 p.m., a neighbor reported to police that Aldridge was mistreating the dog. At least once, he picked it up and slammed it against the sidewalk. The dog was injured but not killed. Aldridge had missed his 5:15 and 6:15 radio shows.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I did that,\u201d Aldridge recalled, \u201cit was something I thought I needed to do, because I was listening to voices.\u201d\n\nAldridge knew he was in trouble, but he left the hospital after a week and returned to work. Things went badly. He took many leaves from WTMJ and had many relapses.\n\nAs a player, he never drank or used drugs of any kind, but now he was hearing voices unheard by others, and the best way to drown them out was to drug them into silence.\n\nOn a fall weekend in 1978 the Packers were in San Diego for a game against the Chargers.\n\nThe night before the game, well past midnight, Milwaukee Journal writer Dave Begel was startled by a thunderous banging on his door. \u201cI opened it,\u201d said Begel, \u201cand there was Lionel, holding a bottle of Scotch and a handful of pills.\n\nHe walked through the room, out to the balcony, and sat there drinking and taking pills.\n\n\u201cWhen he said anything, it was just gibberish, like some foreign language. He wasn\u2019t talking to me. Then he came in and sat on the bed and watched TV. I sat there and waited and waited.\n\n\u201cThe sun was coming up when he got up and said, \u2018I\u2019m going now,\u2019 and left. I saw him an hour before game time and he was okay and did his job. But he was obviously very disturbed.\u201d\n\nAldridge hung on to his job for a while, but by 1981 he was down and out, having plummeted from the heights of the Super Bowl to the depths of the gutter.\n\nOne night on a nondescript city street, he carefully removed his three-diamond Super Bowl ring, put it in his pocket and went to sleep. The ring was the most valuable possession he owned. In the morning it was gone.\n\nHe checked himself in and out of hospitals. A suicide attempt failed. He hitch-hiked across the country, looking for work and sometimes finding it.\n\nThere was a counseling job at a Utah prison; he couldn\u2019t handle it. Arriving after the football season started at his Alma Mater Utah State, he was given a job as an assistant coach.\n\nIt lasted only until the season ended. He continued to drift, doing odd jobs when they came his way.\n\nHis wife had divorced him and taken the children to California. That was all right with him. He wanted some distance between them and him as long as he was in this condition. He did not know how long that would be."}, {"url": "https://www.milwaukeemag.com/the-long-walk-home-lionel-vicky-aldridge/", "page_content": "The interracial marriage of Lionel and Vicky Aldridge made Green Bay Packers and NFL history. Then mental illness and violence tore them apart. But their criss-crossing paths were far from over.\n\nUpstairs in her two-story house in Milwaukee\u2019s pleasant Story Hill neighborhood, Vicky Aldridge is sitting on her bed, and she is looking at an 1876 centennial collector\u2019s rifle.\n\nIt\u2019s pointed at her forehead, and she knows it\u2019s loaded, because she just watched the man holding it shove in the bullets.\n\nHe cocks it.\n\nAnd now, he has something to tell her.\n\nShe knows the baritone voice well. It belongs to Lionel Aldridge, her husband, and yet at this moment, not her husband at all. The Lionel she married was a funny charmer and brave protector, a man she so loved that she risked losing her family for him. He had played football for the Green Bay Packers, adjusting so well to Vince Lombardi\u2019s discipline that he started as a rookie. Lombardi had never started rookies.\n\nAldridge helped Green Bay win the first Super Bowl, then three days later, on Jan. 18, 1967, he married Vicky. And by saying yes, she undid the tightest of ties to her small-town Utah family, who couldn\u2019t comprehend their white daughter and sister being with a black man.\n\nBut Aldridge\u2019s talents went beyond football. During Packers downtime, he was a sports anchor on WTMJ, a man with such presence and promise that NBC put him on national broadcasts soon after his playing career ended. The charm that attracted Vicky also won viewers over. But TV screens revealed only so much, offering no clue Aldridge was tiptoeing on the edge of sanity, or that he was beating his wife.\n\nMinutes before Lionel levels that rifle at her head, Vicky is in the final stages of putting an end to those beatings. The plan is simple, if sketchy. She\u2019ll pack up some bags, then go pick up her two young daughters from school, and they\u2019ll head for the bus station. She\u2019ll select a route, and they\u2019ll go wherever her small amount of cash can get them. Not back home to her family in Utah. With the biracial children, she still can\u2019t go there. But somewhere.\n\nThe bags are on her bed and packed. All she needs to do is leave. But before she can, he arrives home. He sees what she\u2019s doing. He retrieves the rifle and loads it. He smashes its butt into the luggage and throws the crushed bags downstairs. He puts the rifle between her eyes and tells her, point-blank, \u201cIf you ever try to leave me, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that stopped me,\u201d Vicky says, now some 40 years removed from the peril. She gives a nervous chuckle. \u201cYeah, he could get very scary. And I\u2019m sure that was his mental illness coming more and more.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t know he\u2019d someday be diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Or that he\u2019d inadvertently solve her domestic violence problems by embarking on his own brain-addled cross-country sojourn, or that he was destined to join the ranks of the homeless. She didn\u2019t know of the comeback that awaited him, that his destructive illness would someday serve constructive purposes, that she and so many others would never stop loving a man born on Valentine\u2019s Day. She, who knew him so well, still didn\u2019t know so much about Lionel.\n\nNobody did.\n\nThe handsome black Utah State University football player, with the short hair and sparkling eyes, broad smile and broader shoulders, has been asking Vicky Wankier for a date. He often sees her while working his side job of cleaning a gym, because that\u2019s where Vicky practices with her Aggiettes dance squad. After a few rounds of hard-to-get, the lithe and lively girl with the long chestnut hair finally says yes.\n\nShe tells him to just come to her dormitory lobby, where they\u2019ll sit and have a good talk. He laughs into the phone. \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d She protests, wondering why not. \u201cJust trust me,\u201d he says.Yes, Lionel Aldridge, a wisened junior in the spring of 1962, knows straightaway what they are getting into. You could count the number of black men at Utah State on two hands, and they don\u2019t get to stay by making eyes at white women in their dorm lobbies. Vicky, just a freshman and still naive to racial realities, would get wise soon enough.\n\nBarely integrated though it was, Utah State was still the most multiracial experience Vicky had ever known. She was born in August 1943, and she grew up in Levan, the tiniest of central Utah towns. And of course, she was raised Mormon, just like everyone else in her hometown.\n\nHer family bonds \u2013 with father Farrell Wankier and mother Thela, older brother Farrell Jr. and older sister Norine \u2013 were country strong. And nine years the youngest child, she was every bit daddy\u2019s little girl, even into her teens. He had one glass eye and terrible peripheral vision, so when she drove him around town, Vicky had a job. She\u2019d name the person they were driving past and tell him which direction to wave. So in this way, the successful sheep farmer, shopkeeper and future Levan mayor could call out a personalized hello.\n\nWhen Vicky went to Utah State for a teaching degree, the Wankiers knew she\u2019d be in good hands. Farrell Sr. was old friends with Daryl Chase, the school\u2019s president. She\u2019d practically have family there.\n\nFor Aldridge, the closest thing to family in Utah was the Aggies\u2019 football team, because his actual family was scattered far and wide. Born in 1941 in Evergreen, La., he grew up fully immersed in the era\u2019s southern brand of racism. He was a grandson of sharecroppers and son of a father he never really knew. His mother also left when he was young, called to Detroit to care for family, leaving Lionel with his grandparents. She could never afford to return, and poor though they were, the grandparents gave him as good a life as they could. He helped in the fields, but wanted no part of such grueling work for a lifetime, so he poured himself into school, hell-bent on getting to college.\n\nWhich didn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t some rebel in him. His path to the school for black children took him past an all-white school, and black kids had to walk on the other side of the road. One afternoon on his way home, young Lionel sprinted across the street and slapped one of the white school\u2019s buses. He kept on sprinting, spurred on by an incensed mob of white children. But none were in sight when he arrived home, a hint of his budding athleticism.\n\nAnd yet, he never played organized sports in Louisiana. That didn\u2019t come until he was 15, when his grandfather\u2019s death prompted Lionel\u2019s move to live with an uncle and aunt in Pittsburg, Calif. It was a different world in the San Francisco suburb, and at Pittsburg High School, Lionel excelled at track, basketball and football. Then Pittsburg\u2019s football coach took a job at Utah State and convinced Lionel to follow.\n\nAldridge turned into a standout for the Aggies, but it still wasn\u2019t easy for a black man in Logan. The racial slurs he\u2019d grown up with in Louisiana and been distanced from in California became common again. And as his relationship with Vicky grew into an open secret, he got even more unwelcome attention.\n\nOne day, Chase called Vicky into his office, then called her father\u2019s phone number by memory. \u201cI think your daughter has something to tell you,\u201d the school president told Farrell, and handed the receiver to Vicky. \u201cHi Dad,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m dating Lionel Aldridge. He\u2019s black.\u201d\n\nFarrell\u2019s reply was succinct. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right there.\u201d Lionel was soon summoned, and the kids were told just how bad this relationship was for both of them. They agreed to end it, never truly intending to do so.\n\nChase tasked a dean with watching her closely, but she was too far down the path with Lionel to be swayed by protests from her family or anyone else. She didn\u2019t see what the big deal was with race, and couldn\u2019t understand why others didn\u2019t understand.\n\nVicky and Lionel were careful to do things under the radar and off campus. Lionel would borrow a friend\u2019s car, and they\u2019d drive to nearby Logan Canyon. In time, their love grew serious. For her devotion, she was called nigger-lover, and no sorority would have her. For his temerity, once his four years of football eligibility were up, so was his welcome at Utah State. School officials said it was grades. Vicky remains convinced it was their relationship, an example of how Lionel risked his career while she risked her family.\n\nSo he didn\u2019t graduate, and Vicky recalls that when Aldridge was invited to prestigious college all-star games like the East-West Shrine Game, Utah State wouldn\u2019t give him a helmet. He had to borrow one from his high school.\n\nNone of that dissuaded a certain bespectacled NFL coach from spending a fourth-round draft pick on him in 1963.\n\nLionel Aldridge is in Vince Lombardi\u2019s office, a place you generally don\u2019t want to be, an invitation impossible to decline. And although the 1966 season has been another good one for the 6-foot-4, 245-pound defensive end, he\u2019s not in here for a pat on the back.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers coach has heard through the grapevine that Aldridge is, with regularity, bringing a white woman into town. He wants an explanation. So Lionel begins to tell him about Vicky.\n\nThey\u2019d secretly gotten engaged back in 1963. At the end of Aldridge\u2019s rookie season, he flew Vicky to San Francisco for Green Bay\u2019s finale against the 49ers. He and teammate Dave Robinson had some people in their hotel room before the game, and Lionel pulled her into the bathroom. He produced a one-carat diamond ring. She\u2019d kept it hidden away for her last two years at Utah State. Not long after her graduation in 1965, they decided she should move to Milwaukee.\n\nVicky knew that, as far as her family was concerned, crossing the Mississippi River meant crossing the Rubicon. While she\u2019d held out hope her family would come around on Lionel, they were equally hopeful she\u2019d come to her senses and ditch him. But moving to Milwaukee ended her family\u2019s hopes and, for the most part, her close relationship with them. Years later, she\u2019d find out just how deep an impact this had back in Levan.\n\nSo, Aldridge explains to Lombardi, he\u2019s not just bringing some floozy up to Green Bay. This is the woman he\u2019s wanted to marry for years, only now, he\u2019s afraid to do so. Not because of what her family will think. Not even because of what his teammates will think. After all, Aldridge was the rookie who\u2019d heard a fellow Packer utter the word nigger, then threw him up against a wall and declared an end to that word in the locker room.\n\nNo, Aldridge is reluctant to marry Vicky because he knows what happened to Cookie Gilchrist. A black running back who drew comparisons to Jim Brown, Gilchrist was blackballed from the NFL because he married a white woman and relegated to the Canadian Football League. Aldridge doesn\u2019t want the same thing happening to him.\n\nLombardi\u2019s response, as related by Robinson, showcases the coach\u2019s famed combination of gruff compassion and equanimity. \u201cVince told him, \u2018Listen, I want you to marry her and make an honest woman out of her,\u2019\u201d Robinson recalls. \u201c\u2018You do what\u2019s right and let me worry about the rest of it.\u2019 Lionel said he couldn\u2019t wait to go home and tell Vicky.\u201d\n\nThat wasn\u2019t quite the end of it. At some point, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle came to town and told Lombardi the marriage would be bad for the league. Lombardi pretty much told Rozelle where to go. \u201cHe said, \u2018This is my team,\u2019\u201d Vicky recalls. \u201c\u2018You can\u2019t tell me how to run it.\u2019\u201d Were Aldridge on any other team, she believes, he couldn\u2019t have married her and stayed in the league. Only Lombardi could stand up to Rozelle.\n\nThey had the wedding at a little chapel in Las Vegas, not wanting to run afoul of any interracial marriage laws elsewhere. They stayed at the Tropicana and caught Bill Cosby\u2019s stand-up act. Three days earlier, Green Bay had won the inaugural Super Bowl, and Lionel\u2019s champion status earned him a measure of fame \u2013 and some primo seats.\n\nAt the table next to them were teammates from a different Pack \u2013 Rat Pack stars Peter Lawford and Sammy Davis Jr. Lionel whispered to Vicky, wondering if he should ask for autographs. Seconds later, Lawford leaned over. \u201cCould I get your autograph?\u201d he asked Lionel.\n\nAldridge didn\u2019t hesitate to oblige, then whispered something else to Vicky. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m gonna ask for one now.\u201d\n\nDave Robinson and Lionel are about to fight. The Packers roomies are best of friends, with linebacker Robinson the perfect easy-going complement to Aldridge\u2019s moodiness. But the battle is imminent.\n\nLionel has arrived upset because Vicky\u2019s been slighted by another player\u2019s spouse. Although Vicky has a foot in with the black wives because of Lionel and another foot in with the white wives, she hasn\u2019t been fully accepted by either camp. Her latest issue has so angered Lionel that he\u2019s poised to confront the offending wife\u2019s husband. Robinson tries curtailing Aldridge\u2019s vendetta. Lionel tells him to mind his own business. Robinson presses further into it.\n\n\u201cYou are my business,\u201d Robinson says. He tells Aldridge the team can\u2019t risk losing him over some brouhaha that stems from their wives\u2019 spats. So, he\u2019s going to stop Lionel. \u201cIf we have to fight, we\u2019ll fight.\u201d Lionel takes a long look at Robinson. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d Aldridge says. They have a good laugh, and Aldridge admits Robinson\u2019s right.\n\nIf Lombardi\u2019s blessing unlocked the NFL\u2019s interracial marriage barrier, it wasn\u2019t a panacea for the Aldridges. The ramifications were felt not so much in the locker room, but up in the stands or during social gatherings, where Vicky often felt excluded from the cliques.\n\nThe wives had a tradition of rotating watch parties at their homes when the Packers were on the road. The first time Vicky\u2019s turn came, she laid out a fanciful spread, but when game time arrived, none of her guests did. She called around and heard various excuses \u2013 illness, busy, what have you \u2013 but the message was clear.\n\nAnother time, at a home game, Vicky went to her seat among some black wives, including Willie Davis\u2019 wife, Ann, and Elijah Pitts\u2019 wife, Ruth. Vicky found they\u2019d given it away. \u201cGo find a seat someplace else,\u201d Ann said. Some white wives, including Jim Grabowski\u2019s spouse, Kathy, overheard, and Kathy invited Vicky to sit with them. At this, Ann told Vicky they\u2019d make room for her. Vicky told her to F-off and sat next to Kathy, who would become a cherished friend and remembers Vicky being \u201cfriends with everybody she could be.\u201d\n\nIn time, Pitts would also grow close to Vicky. During the season, they lived in the same Green Bay apartment complex, one of the few local places that rented to blacks. She saw all that Vicky endured, and during a team party, the two were in the ladies\u2019 restroom.\n\n\u201cVicky,\u201d Pitts recalls saying, \u201cI am really sorry if us black girls have done anything to make you uncomfortable. I apologize for everybody.\u201d Tensions eased, and Vicky embraced her dearest friends because she had no family support. She kept calling Utah every Sunday, especially to speak with her father, but conversations were perfunctory.\n\nStill, Vicky could enjoy some perks that life as a Packers wife provided. There were the parties, meeting celebrities and sharing the love showered upon the players. This was, after all, a golden era in Green Bay. From 1965-67, the Packers were nothing but kings, winning the last NFL championship and the first two Super Bowls.\n\nMeanwhile, the Aldridge family was growing into their Story Hill home. On Dec. 28, 1967, daughter Angela was born in Milwaukee. Lionel drove down from Green Bay to see mother and baby, but he couldn\u2019t stay long. On Dec. 31, he had to play in the Ice Bowl.\n\nTwo weeks later, with Vicky and Angela still in Milwaukee, the Packers won Super Bowl II in Miami. Lionel called home saying some guys wanted to celebrate in the Bahamas, and he wondered if she\u2019d mind. She was breastfeeding when the call came, and stopped long enough for Lionel to hear Angela crying. \u201cDoes it sound like you can go to the Bahamas for a week?\u201d she asked.\n\nHe came home.\n\nAs the 1960s come to an end and the birth of their second daughter approaches, Vicky notices subtle changes in Lionel. The longer he\u2019s played football, the angrier he\u2019s become.\n\nLooking back on it today, she wonders whether all those football hits took too big a toll. She\u2019s heard from Lionel\u2019s teammates how he\u2019d get \u201cdinged\u201d in the head and return to the huddle, not knowing where he was. And she knows modern scientists are edging toward a direct relationship between concussions, mood changes, domestic violence and mental health issues.\n\nBut on a day in the fall of 1969, all Vicky knows is that Lionel is somehow different, and she\u2019s about to learn the extent. She returns to their Green Bay apartment one afternoon, running behind schedule, and Lionel accuses her of being late because she\u2019s having an affair. Lionel\u2019s teammates had always treaded lightly around Vicky at parties, knowing that if they looked at her too long, his jealousy and temper might flare. But before Vicky can get over her surprise at this accusation, Lionel slaps her.\n\nThere is no affair, she says, but the violence puts her beyond discussing it. She collects Angela and drives to their Milwaukee home, wondering what just happened. They\u2019d been through so much together, made so many sacrifices for each other, all for the sake of love. Now this? \u201cIt was something I never expected from him,\u201d she says.\n\nHe calls Vicky and apologizes, promising to never do it again. She acquiesces, neither expecting nor believing the violence will continue. Instead, it worsens.\n\nMichelle is born in February of 1970, but the presence of a second beloved child cannot stem the mounting malaise inside the Aldridge home. Visits from friends become scarce. Lionel keeps hitting Vicky, and sometimes, the only way she can get him to stop is calling Angela into the room. When the little girl enters, he relents. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have involved her,\u201d Vicky says today, \u201cbut I just didn\u2019t know what to do. I had tried everything.\u201d She\u2019d call the police, but to no avail. \u201cBecause of who he was,\u201d Vicky says, \u201cthey would just pat his head and tell him to not do that anymore.\u201d\n\nWhen Vicky\u2019s mother dies in September 1971, it\u2019s the impetus for a true reconciliation with her father. Despite the thaw, however, she knows biracial children won\u2019t be welcome back in Utah, so returning there isn\u2019t an option.\n\nAfter the \u201971 season, slumping Green Bay trades an aging Aldridge to San Diego, where he\u2019ll play two more years. His paranoia progresses, and he often accuses Vicky of trying to poison him. A Chargers teammate suggests he try transcendental meditation, and he does, sometimes for 20 minutes, sometimes for hours on end. The 1973 season concludes, and so does Aldridge\u2019s NFL career. But he\u2019s had a plan for life after football, and now, it\u2019s ready to blossom.\n\nBack in Milwaukee, a full-time broadcasting job with WTMJ awaits. Since the mid-1960s, he\u2019s done offseason work for the TV and radio stations, steadily honing his natural talent. Robinson remembers a diligent Lionel working to drop his southern accent, reading books in their room and repeating phrases like \u201chow now brown cow.\u201d The newly retired Aldridge continues doing sports anchor work on local newscasts. But now that he can work during football season, TMJ puts him on Packers radio broadcasts, pairing him with the singular play-by-play talents of Jim Irwin. It\u2019s not long before NBC tabs him as an analyst for national TV games.\n\n\u201cHe had a future at the network level,\u201d says Hank Stoddard, then TMJ\u2019s sports director. Stoddard compares Aldridge\u2019s analytical acumen, and his ability to communicate it, to the modern-day skills of Cris Collinsworth and Troy Aikman. \u201cHe was destined to become that type.\u201d\n\n\n\nAldridge\u2019s slide from sanity comes at an ever-quickening pace.\n\nStoddard is 80 years old now and living near the Pacific Ocean in San Juan Capistrano, Calif. Over a morning cup of coffee, he reminisces on Lionel while gazing out a window. He notes how the fog hides his view of the water, and he laments the fog that so enveloped Lionel.\n\nHe\u2019d started seeing troubling signs at work. The friendly cameraman who complained about Lionel\u2019s attitude. Aldridge asking why he had to go to Green Bay when the baseball reporter needed only drive to County Stadium. But one day, the problems crystallize.\n\nAldridge is supposed to do the 5 p.m. broadcast, but as the time approaches, he\u2019s at his desk just staring at the wall. Stoddard looks at the script in his typewriter: \u201cMy name is Lionel Aldridge, and I can do anything.\u201d That\u2019s it. Stoddard tells the news director Aldridge can\u2019t go on and ad-libs the 5 p.m. broadcast himself. Aldridge is driven home.\n\nThe slide from sanity comes at an ever-quickening pace. It includes blanking out while broadcasting a game, leaving Irwin hanging without an analyst. It includes a rifle pointed at his wife\u2019s head. It leads to a nervous breakdown in February 1975, a misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder, and a monthlong stay at Milwaukee Psychiatric Hospital. It leads him to the care of Dr. Alan Reed, then something of a celebrity psychologist in Milwaukee, but who Vicky and friends say only made things worse. Indeed, years later, Reed would lose his state license amid allegations that he had sex with a patient.\n\nReed isolates Lionel for weeks, refusing to let Vicky or anyone else see him, even Aldridge\u2019s mother, who\u2019s traveled from Detroit. Reed later tells Lionel he should divorce Vicky, and for years, she\u2019d have done anything to get away from him. But when finally given this exit route, she doesn\u2019t want it, feeling she shouldn\u2019t abandon Lionel in his current state. Aldridge moves out anyway, still far from stable. The clearest indication comes in August 1977.\n\nDespite the separation, Lionel visits his old house often, so when he shows up one evening, it\u2019s not surprising. But what he does next is surreal.\n\nAs he\u2019s leaving, Lionel picks up Charlie, the family\u2019s little white mutt, and walks outside. Vicky follows, asking where he\u2019s taking the dog. Lionel doesn\u2019t answer. Instead, he walks into the driveway, raises Charlie over his head, and hurls the dog to the ground. Horrified, Vicky screams at Lionel and tries pushing him away, but to no avail. He kicks the dog, then walks to the corner and sits on the curb, waiting for the police to arrive. The dog will soon die.\n\n\u201cI think it was his way of just crying out, saying somebody has got to find out what\u2019s wrong with me,\u201d Vicky says now. \u201cThe kids, luckily, were in bed, and luckily, it wasn\u2019t me he picked up and smashed.\u201d He spends another month hospitalized, this time at the Milwaukee County Mental Health Complex. Vicky warns Reed to stay away. She knows he\u2019s been unfaithful to his wife and threatens to tell her. It works. Lionel is diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. For the first time, he\u2019s medicated with Haldol.\n\nIt stops the voices but leaves him feeling like a zombie, so he doesn\u2019t always take it.\n\nAldridge struggles to continue his broadcasting career, and his TMJ co-workers support him, allowing time off when necessary. But it\u2019s too great a battle. One night, unable to go on the air, he sobs in his boss\u2019 office. Despite the protests of his colleagues, in 1979, he resigns. He still won\u2019t take his medication regularly.\n\nHe is at a loss, and now, he\u2019ll become lost. The voices tell him to start driving, so he starts wandering aimlessly about the country, the gasoline bills always sent home to Vicky. At first, she pays them, but soon cancels the credit card. She has to make ends meet for the kids, and her job as a radio station ad sales rep only pays so much. As it turns out, former Packer Willie Davis owns the station, WLUM, but she won\u2019t learn this until running into him at the office Christmas party.\n\nShe files for divorce in 1980, but it\u2019s delayed and delayed because Lionel can\u2019t be found. Finally, in 1982, the divorce goes through without his presence. Vicky and the kids leave for California to start a new life.\n\nFarrell Wankier Sr., who has remarried after Thela\u2019s death, is heading to Las Vegas with his second wife, and their path takes them through a southwestern Utah town called Beaver. They stop at a diner for a bite to eat, and in the midst of their repast, a man takes a seat next to them.\n\n\u201cHello, Farrell,\u201d the newcomer says. It is, through an astronomical coincidence, Lionel, who is hitchhiking through the area. Farrell barely recognizes him, but offers to buy his meal, and he accepts. Farrell also offers him a ride, and Lionel declines. They go their separate ways, and Farrell relays the amazing encounter to Vicky.\n\nThroughout the early 1980s, Lionel\u2019s cross-country wanderlust has taken him everywhere and nowhere, from Florida to Oregon, and seemingly all points in between. He\u2019s gone to the places he once lived \u2013 Louisiana, Utah, California \u2013 and to places he\u2019d never known. Many of those places, he\u2019s reached on foot, after selling his car for $100 in Florida. He\u2019s gotten work, and then left it behind. He\u2019s slept in a field near Salt Lake City, and left a Super Bowl ring behind.\n\nWith its loss, the lone tangible connection to his Packers past is a battered old Bible he\u2019d kept from his playing days.\n\nHis path eventually winds toward Milwaukee, but he gets stranded in Sidney, Neb. A charitable agency buys his bus ticket for the rest of the trip, and he settles in at the Milwaukee Rescue Mission. Back in the city that had been home for so long, he makes the medical breakthrough that\u2019s eluded him for so long. Dr. Melvin Soo Hoo finds a minimal medication level that works for Lionel, and he starts taking it with far more regularity. In January 1985, the 18th anniversary of that first Super Bowl, Aldridge learns his former teammates are chipping in to replace his lost championship ring. Lionel also lands work with the post office, then returns to broadcasting part time, and he gets an East Side apartment.\n\nBy 1986, Vicky and the kids are back in Milwaukee, too. The California plans haven\u2019t worked out, and Davis offers Vicky her old job back. She accepts, and comes home not just with daughters Angela and Michelle, but a granddaughter, too. Angela had gotten pregnant at age 17 and gave birth to Monica in 1985.\n\nVicky remarries in 1987 to a gentleman named Joe Nelson, who also happens to be black, and their wedding is at Milwaukee\u2019s All Saints Cathedral. She loves his quiet confidence and steady nature, and he bonds well with her daughters. He also supports Vicky\u2019s encouragement that Angela and Michelle forge a relationship with Lionel. She warns that if they don\u2019t, they\u2019ll someday regret it, knowing how much it meant to rebuild things with Farrell before his death in 1994.\n\n\u201cShe never spoke a bad word about [Lionel], and she could\u2019ve,\u201d Michelle says. \u201cShe never made us feel like he didn\u2019t love us. She just said that he was sick and not able to have a relationship.\u201d\n\nMichelle, now 44 and living with her husband in Kentucky, tears up remembering the first time she saw the new Lionel. \u201cHe just looked completely different. He looked good, but didn\u2019t look the same as I remembered him. A little awkward. But it was good.\u201d\n\nBy then, Lionel had stabilized enough to become a spokesman for mental health issues. He gives a speech at Michelle\u2019s high school, telling his own story so that others might learn from it. And in addition to his local mental health advocacy, he gives speeches nationwide on behalf of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill. To this day, NAMI bestows the annual Lionel Aldridge Award at its national convention to a person living with mental illness, recognizing their \u201ccourage, leadership and service.\u201d\n\nTime, and time spent together, slowly bridges the gap between father and daughters. He brings them Christmas gifts. They share meals, either at his favorite George Webb or at his apartment, where he serves up broiled chicken and white rice. They check on him often to make sure he\u2019s OK, and to make sure he\u2019s on his medication. \u201cYou could always tell when he\u2019d not taken it because he would begin to swear more,\u201d Michelle says.\n\nWhen he\u2019s too far off his meds, the girls must persuade him to go to the hospital, molding their tactics to whatever personality he exhibits. Sometimes, he\u2019s like a little boy, and they tempt him with promises of ice cream. Sometimes, he\u2019s a mean man, and they must meet him with firm and forceful language. But he never gets violent with them.\n\nVicky also reconnects with Lionel, and she says Joe never questions nor feels threatened by it. And Lionel is re-embraced by his football roots. He\u2019s inducted into the Packers Hall of Fame in 1988. He\u2019s named to Utah State\u2019s All-Century Team in 1993.\n\nA few years later, Aldridge has a car accident that requires a tracheotomy, and Vicky makes regular hospital visits, reading to him and making sure he\u2019s well-cared for. He weighs some 400 pounds, and the doctor tells him if he doesn\u2019t lose 50 pounds, he\u2019ll be dead in a year.\n\nVicky takes the opportunity to tell Lionel something, too. He can\u2019t speak, so it\u2019s her chance to share just how much trouble and angst he\u2019d caused, and she doesn\u2019t have to worry about him talking back. He gives a muffled laugh, and she follows through on the promise, unloading all those years of pent-up pain and frustration. He absorbs it all without flinching.\n\n\u201cWhen I left him,\u201d Vicky remembers, \u201che mouthed, \u2018I love you.\u2019\u201d\n\nDuring the late afternoon of Feb. 12, 1998, Michelle arrives at Lionel\u2019s apartment near Estabrook Park, where they\u2019d so often shared broiled chicken with rice. But this is not a dinner date, just another check-in.\n\nWhen she knocks on the door, Lionel doesn\u2019t answer. It\u2019s locked, but through a window, she can see him sitting at a desk. She knocks on the glass to get his attention, and though she thinks she can see him breathing, he doesn\u2019t respond. She pounds harder. Still nothing.\n\nNow she is getting frantic. She runs to another apartment and knocks on the door for help. A woman answers and is on the phone, and even though Michelle is panicked and screaming, the woman will not get off the phone. She goes to another door and a man answers. She tells him her father is dying or dead.\n\nThe man lets her in, and by now, Michelle\u2019s mind is racing so much she can\u2019t remember the number for 911. The man calls it for her, and rescuers are dispatched. Vicky is also notified, and she arrives, as does the boyfriend who\u2019d later become Michelle\u2019s husband. Police get through the window and into Lionel\u2019s apartment. They won\u2019t let Michelle in. They tell her he\u2019s dead.\n\nIt is two days before Lionel\u2019s 57th birthday. The medical examiner\u2019s report, according to a New York Times story, lists him at 408 1/2 pounds. His heart, so strong for so long, finally failed, the doctor\u2019s ominous prophecy come true.\n\nJoe Nelson plans the Feb. 16 funeral at All Saints Cathedral, and it is massive. Hundreds fill the church to capacity. \u201cIt seemed,\u201d Michelle says, \u201clike thousands.\u201d\n\nThe audience reflects the full spectrum of Lionel\u2019s journey. Vicky and Joe, other family and friends from Milwaukee and afar, city officials and mental health professionals, people in the media and people who were homeless. And, of course, a slew of Green Bay Packers, Willie Davis, Jerry Kramer, Bob Long and Dave Robinson among them. Michelle and Angela give eulogies, as does Monica, Lionel\u2019s 12-year-old granddaughter.\n\n\u201cLionel affected a lot of people in his life, whether he knew it or not,\u201d Vicky says. \u201cIt was quite a tribute.\u201d And because he had no insurance to handle the bill, those who shared in so much of his life give his family one more gift. His Packers\u2019 teammates pick up the tab.\n\nLooking back, it was never a question. \u201cHe was one of ours. He was a Green Bay Packer,\u201d Robinson declares. \u201cHis troubles were our troubles.\u201d\n\nNot long after Lionel\u2019s death, Vicky and Monica are in Utah visiting Norine, Vicky\u2019s sister. It\u2019s a sign of how far their once-cold relationship has come. Norine produces some letters that she and their mother, Thela, exchanged shortly after Vicky left Utah. Vicky and Monica sit on their bed, reading through them in chronological order. Tears stream down Vicky\u2019s face.\n\nYour dad is lying here on the couch in the dark. He hasn\u2019t eaten in a couple of days. We\u2019re not talking to anybody. How could she do this to us?\n\nThe content of the letters haunts Vicky, and the next morning, Norine admits to wondering whether she should\u2019ve let Vicky see them. Vicky gives Norine a long hug and apologizes for leaving with Lionel. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t to cause any pain or hurt,\u201d she says. \u201cI just fell in love.\u201d\n\nThe ladies go out to get their nails done, and Vicky tries to pay, but Norine won\u2019t have it. She won\u2019t let her pay for anything else, either. When it\u2019s time to go, she thanks Norine for all the hospitality. \u201cI was so mean to you for so many years,\u201d Norine says. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of making up to do.\u201d It cements their renewal.\n\nVicky remembers back to the night she was reading those letters with Monica, and what Monica had told her while taking her hand: \u201cOh Grandma, your mom and dad loved you,\u201d Monica said. \u201cYou were just ahead of your time.\u201d\n\nRuth Pitts doesn\u2019t know why she selects this particular prayer shawl. She goes through 10 or 20 of them, finally settling on a crocheted piece with warm brown tones and the merest hint of gold and green. Yes, she decides, this is it. The ladies at her United Methodist Church in Palm Springs, Calif., make the shawls, which are blessed and mailed out monthly to people needing prayer and comfort. In November of 2011, Pitts knows Vicky Aldridge Nelson needs both.\n\nDaughter Angela has died at age 43, unable to overcome years of her own drug and alcohol addiction. Like Lionel\u2019s memorial service, her funeral is at All Saints Cathedral. In the weeks and months afterward, Vicky comes to cherish the shawl, wearing it every day.\n\nIn the autumn of 2014, Vicky clutches the shawl even tighter. After living a life full of years both good and bad, she\u2019s in the midst of a particularly rough stretch. Stoddard, still friends with Vicky, had long ago nicknamed her the Unsinkable Molly Brown. Lately, she\u2019s had to be.\n\nIn September, her 81-year-old brother, Farrell Jr., dies in Salt Lake City. When Vicky was a child and he\u2019d come home on leave from the Army, she\u2019d leap into his arms, and he\u2019d produce a teddy bear. Then came the estrangement, which later gave way to their gradual knitting of the breach. Once, during Lionel\u2019s lost years of wanderlust, Farrell Jr. gave him money when he showed up unannounced. And when Vicky married Joe, it was Farrell Jr. who walked her down the aisle.\n\nThen in October, Vicky\u2019s mourning load doubles. Granddaughter Monica dies at age 28, and like her mother, addiction plays a role. Vicky deplores the continued stigma of addiction, how most don\u2019t think of it as a disease, mirroring the public\u2019s still-stigmatized perception of mental illness. All Saints hosts yet another Aldridge funeral.\n\nOn top of it all, Joe is starting to have health issues. His arteries need stents. He\u2019s in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Vicky\u2019s shawl is ever-present. And now, her Utah family wants to be, too.\n\nNorine and Farrell Jr.\u2019s widow, Deanna, beg Vicky to move to Utah with Joe, beg her to let them help lighten the load. When Vicky and Joe were at Farrell\u2019s funeral, they visited Salt Lake City\u2019s picturesque Liberty Park. Joe struck up a conversation with a passing black man, asking where he gets his hair cut. The man told him about a nearby barbershop, and how much he enjoyed living in the city.\n\nAnd so, in November, a once-cozy Milwaukee home is full of boxes. Vicky Aldridge Nelson is shipping them to Utah, where she was once ostracized for marrying a black man. Now, she will return there with husband Joe, and accept the warm and abiding embrace of family.\n\nHowie Magner is a senior editor at Milwaukee Magazine.

During Lombardi's nine years as coach of the Packers, Lionel Aldridge was the only rookie to start a season opener.\n\nAlthough Aldridge might have been more steady than spectacular over the course of his career, Lombardi's early faith in him was a tribute in itself. In fact, Aldridge started the first 45 games of his career under Lombardi before missing the fourth game of the 1966 season with an ankle injury.\n\nAfter the Packers won a second consecutive NFL championship in 1962, Lombardi traded veteran Bill Quinlan and created an opening at right defensive end with no obvious heir apparent. Veteran free agent Urban Henry, who wasn't re-signed by the Los Angeles Rams after missing the 1962 season with a neck injury, and No. 1 draft pick Dave Robinson were considered the frontrunners heading into camp. However, the Packers decided to play Robinson at linebacker when he reported late following the College All-Star Game and Aldridge beat out Henry.\n\nAldridge came into his own when the Packers won an unprecedented three straight NFL championships under the league's playoff format from 1965 to 1967. He started all eight postseason games during that stretch and then continued to hold forth at right end until midway through the 1971 season.\n\nOver his eight-and-a-half years as an established starter, Aldridge missed only three games, a notable achievement when you consider he broke his leg once and had some ankle issues. The worst of his injuries occurred in a mid-August preseason game in 1967 when Aldridge broke a bone in his lower left leg. He missed only the first two regular-season games, didn't start but appeared in the third, and then played roughly three-quarters of the game in a hard-fought victory over Detroit in Week 4. Lombardi, who had little compassion for injured players and rarely saluted them when they played hurt, heaped praise on Aldridge after the game. \"Aldridge deserves a lot of credit for the way he came back so fast from his injury,\" Lombardi said.\n\nWhile Aldridge played before sacks were officially recorded, his best assets were his quickness and lateral movement, strengths commonly found in good pass rushers more so than defensive ends known for their play against the run. However, Aldridge didn't necessarily fit the stereotype. He was considered to be comparably efficient against the run and pass, whereas his predecessor, Quinlan, was more of a one-dimensional run-stuffer.\n\nOne reality that Aldridge faced throughout his career was lack of attention. Whether it was a blessing, a burden or both, he was overshadowed by fellow defensive end and future Pro Football Hall of Famer Willie Davis and had little chance of earning any postseason honors. The one exception was in 1964 when the Sporting News named him to the NFL's all-Western Conference team.\n\n\"Lionel was a little bit quicker than Willie (Davis), but Lionel was almost all quickness,\" said Pro Football Hall of Fame linebacker Dave Robinson. \"He didn't bull rush as much as Willie. Very smart. Real quick. His weakness was he could have used more weight. He was (really) 238, 239, 240. The linebacker, Lee Roy Caffey, was 250.\"\n\nThe Packers selected Aldridge in the fourth round of the 1962 NFL Draft. Overlooked in the American Football League draft, he signed with the Packers on Dec. 22, 1962, less than three weeks after they had picked him.\n\nAldridge played college football during the one-platoon era and doubled as a tight end and defensive lineman. However, his play appeared to suffer his senior year when he was moved from defensive end to defensive tackle. While that might have hurt his draft standing, scouts were still intrigued by his athletic ability and versatility. In fact, John Ralston, his college coach and later coach of the Denver Broncos, thought Aldridge's best position in the pros would be offensive guard.\n\nWith the Packers, Aldridge played in 123 games and started 115 before being traded on April 18, 1972, along with a third-round draft choice, to San Diego for safety Jim Hill. At the time, Phil Bengtson, Aldridge's former defensive coach and head coach with the Packers, was in charge of San Diego's personnel department. Aldridge spent two seasons with the Chargers and retired. In Green Bay, Aldridge had lost his starting job to Alden Roche in the seventh game of the 1971 season, Dan Devine's first as head coach.\n\nAldridge played two years in San Diego before announcing his retirement on April 3, 1974. By then, he was well into a second career, having joined WTMJ of Milwaukee as an offseason broadcaster in 1966. Once his NFL career ended, Aldridge became a full-time announcer. His assignments included serving as an analyst for Packers radio broadcasts from 1975 to 1978 and as a television commentator for NBC from 1975 to 1977. Although the positions overlapped, Aldridge was able to do both because he worked games for NBC only part-time. Thus, when there was a conflict, a sub filled in for him on radio."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/lionel.aldridge/2162636", "page_content": "Lionel Aldridge\n\ngridiron football player\n\nFebruary 14, 1941 (age 56)\n\nHe earned an athletic scholarship and played college football at Utah State University in Logan, and was a co-captain of the team and an All-Skyline Conference tackle.

An articulate and well-spoken man. A loving husband, father and family man.\n\nAn athletic 6-foot-4, 250-pound end, Aldridge used his size and strength to do something no other player had in the Vince Lombardi dynasty of the 1960s: earn a permanent starting position as a rookie.\n\nAldridge, a fourth-round draft choice from Utah State in 1963, remained a Green Bay starter through the 1971 season, playing in 123 regular-season games. He was part of three NFL championship and two Super Bowl-winning teams.\n\nIn the worst of times, Aldridge, suffering from severe depression and mental illness, lost his family and his job as a television color analyst. In 1977, his wife sued him for divorce and a month later he beat the family's dog after a domestic incident at his suburban Milwaukee home.\n\nAldridge was admitted to the psychiatric emergency ward at Milwaukee County General Hospital and tried medication and therapy to regain his mental health. By 1980, divorced and broke, he drifted for several years throughout the United States, working odd jobs to survive. He worked construction, maintenance, and even a brief stint as an assistant coach at Utah State.\n\nAt times he slept in the streets, and one morning woke up to find his Super Bowl II ring had been stolen off his finger. He showed up at Willie Davis' office in Los Angeles one day and asked for financial and medical help. Davis and other teammates were quick to offer assistance, but Aldridge never stayed long.\n\nHis daughter, Michelle Golding of Shorewood, Wis., has her father's Super Bowl I ring in a safety deposit box.\n\nFather's Day, as it always is, was a difficult day for Golding, who visited Aldridge's grave site at Wisconsin Memorial Park Cemetery in Brookfield, Wis.\n\n\"It's still tough,\" said Golding, 39, in an interview Monday afternoon. \"I found him (dead) in his apartment.\"\n\nGrowing up, Golding said she really never realized her father was famous.\n\n\"I was born in 1970, so I really didn't know how big the Packer football part of his life really was,\" she said. \"It wasn't until he was in broadcasting and people would stop us in the street and ask for his autograph that I understood it.\"\n\nGolding has her father's helmet, a 1966 oil painting of Aldridge in uniform and a photo of him reading a book to her as a child displayed in her living room.\n\n\"The funny thing is, I never thought to have my dad autograph the helmet,\" she said with a laugh. Her husband, Al, is a Chicago Bears' fan, a fact that never sat well with Lionel Aldridge. \"It makes the Packers-Bears games even more exciting around here. But my dad was never particularly fond of him - like anyone who would date his daughter. No one was ever good enough, especially a Bears fan.\"\n\nGolding said dealing with her dad's mental illness three decades ago was challenging enough, but magnified for someone in the public eye.\n\n\"Back at that time, mental illness was an embarrassing subject to talk about, to admit that someone in your family had it,\" Golding said. \"It was very tough for my mom and us because, like many people, at times my dad didn't think he needed to take his medication for his disease.\n\n\"We'd worry about him, and sometimes have to go find him and pick him up and bring him back home. And being an ex-Packer and broadcaster, everything he did was printed in the newspaper, so it was very difficult.\"\n\nGolding is most proud of the fact that her father helped bring awareness to mental illness and depression.\n\n\"I feel like he became a great spokesman and brought attention to it that helped other people and families dealing with mental illness,\" she said. \"At his funeral, people of all walks of life showed up. I heard so many stories about how he helped them.\"\n\nAldridge was over 400 pounds when he died of heart failure on Feb. 12, 1998, at age 56. More than 300 attended his funeral, including many of his former Packer teammates.\n\nJerry Kramer was one of them.\n\n\"Lionel was from Utah and I was from Idaho, so we're neighbors,\" Kramer said in an interview Sunday. \"I made it a point his rookie season to pump him up, to tell him he could do it. He became a starter, and I wanted him to succeed. We had won championships in 1961 and '62. So I tried to help him, encourage him and pump him up before games.\n\n\"His second season, I stopped being his cheerleader. I didn't think he needed me. . . . I thought with his size, strength and ability he was well on his way.\"\n\nKramer was unknowingly wrong. After both their playing careers were over, when Aldridge was in the broadcast booth, he asked Kramer a startling question.\n\n\"He said, 'How come you dumped me after my rookie year?' \" Kramer related.\n\n\"I said, 'What?' \"\n\n\"He said, 'You got me going, but then you stopped after that first season.' \"\n\n\"I said, 'I didn't think that you needed me anymore. You had it.' I didn't know if I had an impact and didn't want to be a pain in the (expletive) because he was doing fine.\"\n\nKramer visited Aldridge in 1985 when he found out from former defensive tackle Ron Kostelnik that Aldridge was back in Milwaukee after a long absence. Aldridge was working at the post office, sorting mail on the second shift.\n\n\"There was a lot of pain there for me, seeing him sorting mail,\" Kramer said. \"I know he was on the clock, but we sat down and talked. He told me stories about when he was in the streets, and one about paranoid schizophrenia.\n\n\"He had two friends that wanted him to go to the hospital. As a means of getting rid of them, he thought they were the ones who were sick. He went to the hospital but slipped out. He got a couple of blocks away before the cops got him. Then he began to realize, 'Maybe it is me.' \"\n\nKramer said Aldridge looked good and spoke lucidly, and said the two former teammates had a great conversation. \"It was like we were back in the locker room, giggling and laughing,\" Kramer said. \"I was just glad to see him, and that he was doing well.\n\n\"When I went to leave, he walked me to the elevator. As the doors were closing, he said, 'Love you.' \"\n\nAldridge had physical attributes - size, speed and strength - to be successful in the NFL. He had intelligence, a sense of humor and skill with the spoken word. He can thank his grandmother for the latter. As a boy, schoolmates teased him about his speech.\n\n\"Lionel came home crying one day and his grandmother began working with him on his vocabulary and grammar,\" Kramer said. \"He focused on that at a young age. He was a very polished man with a beautiful voice and a great command of words. Perfect for broadcasting.\"\n\nAldridge became interested in sports broadcasting in 1966, after he was approached by WTMJ-AM radio officials to audition for a job.\n\nHe also was coming into his prime as a key player for the talent-rich Packer defense. Aldridge played before the NFL kept official statistics on sacks and tackles, but he always had a nose for the ball and led the Packers in fumble recoveries with a career high of five in 1964 and two in 1966 (tied with five other players).\n\nThe postseason accolades and honors for the Green Bay defensive line were rightfully bestowed upon the left-side tandem of Davis and Henry Jordan, but Aldridge, a right end, warranted consideration for All-Pro and Pro Bowl recognition.\n\nHe would never receive any postseason honors. Aldridge was simply a very good player on some superb teams.\n\nAldridge remained a starter after the retirement of Lombardi, through Phil Bengtson from 1968-'70 and Dan Devine in 1971. He was traded to San Diego and played two seasons with the Chargers before retiring from the game in 1973.\n\nHe rose quickly in sports broadcasting from radio to television, and announced several Packer games in 1975 before signing with NBC as an commentator in 1976. Then his mental illness began to erode his family and career in the ensuing years. After working at the post office for several years, Aldridge supported himself with speaking engagements and as a spokesman for mental health.\n\nHis former wife, Vicky Nelson, said one of Aldridge's proudest moments was his induction into the Packers Hall of Fame in 1988. She said her former husband of 18 years and college sweetheart also has an award named in his honor by the National Organization for Mental Health in Milwaukee.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Lionel didn't get the help for his disease that is available now. No one knew much about mental illness in the 1960s and '70s,\" Nelson said. \"With many diseases, the person stays the same. Not with mental illness. It was very hard for Lionel. It was a process to figure out what was wrong with him and get him help. I'm proud that he helped so many other people. They saw that even a pro athlete can be mentally ill and that it's a disease.\"\n\nThe Lionel Aldridge file\n\nCollege: Utah State.\n\nPacker years: 1963-'71.\n\nPacker highlights: The only player to become a starter his rookie season under Vince Lombardi.
