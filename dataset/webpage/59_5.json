It is uniquely set up: its lawyers receive the highest quality generalist training but develop specialisation over time, granting them the pliability to deal with any issue, along with enhanced problem-solving and creative thinking skills and deep substantive knowledge of the relevant issues. Among them are several eminent trial lawyers, including Keith Hummel , Evan Chesler , David Marriott and Sharonmoyee Goswami : Hummel is ingenious, resourceful, resolute and unflagging \u2013 there is nothing he cannot do when it comes to complex legal conflict. So, too, Chesler, who is referred to in reverent tones as \u201cgodlike in litigation\u201d. He continues to work closely with Marriott \u2013 they valiantly battled Apple on Qualcomm\u2019s behalf \u2013 and is currently representing short-form streaming start-up Quibi and consumer technology holding company WndrCo alongside him in consolidated patent infringement and trade secret litigation against Israeli technology company JBF Interlude. Marriott has proven his mettle in many high-profile IP, antitrust and securities cases. Goswami is the rising star of the practice and comes in for special praise: \u201cSharon is extremely strategic and detail-oriented and knows how to position cases to maximise chances of success. She has a sense of self and purpose about her and is highly collaborative, with a unique ability to work seamlessly across multiple teams.\u201d One of the top IP experts, not just at Cravath but in the world, corporate partner David Kappos anchors a leading transactions practice. He gets the biggest deals done before tea time but also devotes mental energy to crystal-ball gazing; he has an uncannily accurate sense of where things are heading \u2013 what the policy issues will be and where commercial opportunities will arise \u2013 making his behind-the-scenes strategic counsel utterly priceless.\n\nMr Kappos received a BS summa cum laude in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California, Davis in 1983 and a JD from the University of California, Berkeley in 1990.\n\nMr Kappos has received numerous accolades for his contributions to the field of intellectual property, including being named one of the Top 25 Icons of IP by Law360, one of the 50 Most Influential People in IP by Managing Intellectual Property, one of the Top 50 IP Trailblazers and Pioneers and one of the 100 Most Influential Lawyers in America by The National Law Journal and being inducted into the IP Hall of Fame by IAM in 2012.\n\nPrior to leading the USPTO, Mr Kappos served as IBM\u2019s chief IP lawyer from 2003 to 2009.

He is widely recognised as one of the world\u2019s foremost leaders in the field of intellectual property, including IP management and strategy, the development of global IP norms, laws and practices, as well as commercialisation and enforcement of innovation-based assets.\n\nFirm Profile\n\nCravath has been known as one of the premier US law firms for over two centuries. Each of its practices is highly regarded and its lawyers are recognised around the world for their commitment to the representation of their clients\u2019 interests.\n\nIntellectual property is one of Cravath\u2019s core practice areas and a cornerstone of Cravath\u2019s reputation as the firm of choice for clients with respect to their most challenging legal issues, most significant business transactions and most critical disputes. In the 19th century, the firm handled the telegraph patent litigation for Samuel Morse and mechanical reaper patent matters for Cyrus McCormick. Today, the firm\u2019s expertise covers the entire innovation marketplace, spanning the consumer products, energy, healthcare, media and entertainment, pharmaceuticals, retail, technology and telecommunications industries, among others. Cravath also advises on matters in connection with emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, blockchain and fintech, as well as data security and privacy issues.\n\nCravath\u2019s strength in intellectual property stems in part from the firm\u2019s unique culture. Cravath\u2019s lawyers are trained as generalists and, over time, as partners, many focus on and deepen their expertise in specific areas. As a result, Cravath has a dedicated team of IP practitioners with an extensive understanding of patent and other issues, as well as experience in a broad range of trial and transactional work, which enables them to devise creative and commercially practicable solutions to complex problems. Cravath\u2019s governance as a true partnership ensures that all clients receive the benefit of the firm\u2019s overall knowledge, expertise and experience.\n\nCorporate IP practice\n\nCravath has a broad-based corporate IP practice representing clients ranging from early-stage start-ups to global companies in contexts across the full spectrum of IP disciplines, technologies and jurisdictions. Its lawyers work hand in glove with the firm\u2019s premier M&A and financing teams to handle the many IP issues that arise in complex transactions, including issues relating to patents, trademarks, copyright, data, trade secrets, privacy and information security. In addition, Cravath provides strategic counselling, review and analysis in developing and managing IP portfolios, commercialising innovation-based assets and optimising IP rights to ensure its clients are maximising value from their intellectual property in the United States and in non-US markets.\n\nLitigation IP practice\n\nRepresenting both plaintiffs and defendants at the trial level, on appeal, in investigations or in an advisory capacity, Cravath\u2019s litigators are adept at handling a wide variety of matters involving patents, trade secrets, copyright and trademarks, as well as the commercial litigation that frequently arises from IP matters, such as antitrust and breach of licence claims. Whatever the subject matter at issue, the firm\u2019s litigators bring to each case a trial lawyer\u2019s courtroom perspective and deep trial expertise in a variety of matters. As a result, clients turn to Cravath to protect them from infringement of their most important intellectual property or to defend valuable products against claims of infringement. Cravath has supervised and coordinated IP disputes that span the entire globe. The firm regularly advises on national and worldwide IP strategy and the identification of patents and other assets that can be used effectively for offensive or defensive purposes. Its practice also includes participation in inter partes review matters.\n\nInternational clients\n\nCravath regularly advises clients based outside the United States on a wide range of transactions, including cross-border mergers and acquisitions, international capital markets and bank financings, general corporate and Securities and Exchange Commission compliance matters. Its lawyers also handle US litigation, international arbitrations and investigations for non-US clients, and plan, coordinate and supervise multinational proceedings. The firm works closely with a network of leading law firms in major international markets, each of which has demonstrated a commitment to achieving the same high standards that clients expect from Cravath.\n\nCravath and its lawyers have been recognised as leaders in intellectual property by numerous industry publications, including Chambers USA, Chambers Global, The Legal 500 US, Benchmark Litigation, The Best Lawyers in America, Law360, Managing Intellectual Property, U.S. News-Best Lawyers\u2019 Best Law Firms and IAM."}, {"url": "https://www.uspto.gov/about-us/david-j-kappos", "page_content": "2009-2013\n\nDavid J. Kappos was born in 1961 in Palos Verdes, California. He was educated at the University of California, Davis, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in electrical and computer engineering, and the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a Doctorate of Jurisprudence.\n\nKappos spent more than 25 years at IBM. As counsel in the area of global intellectual property (IP) protection, he oversaw the protection of the firm\u2019s IP in the Asia-Pacific region. Then, in 2003, he became IBM\u2019s chief IP lawyer. Attaining the rank of Vice President and Assistant General Counsel, Intellectual Property Law, he managed IBM\u2019s patent and trademark portfolios.\n\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Kappos for the position of Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the USPTO. The Senate confirmed Kappos\u2019s appointment on August 13, 2009. As Director, Kappos prioritized the strategic navigation of a severe recession, the implementation of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), and the reduction of pendency intervals (the amount of time between an applicant's submitting an application and receiving a decision).\n\nIn response to financial pressures resulting from the recession (2007-2009) and a decline in business activity for the agency, the USPTO froze hiring and scaled back programs where possible. The outlook brightened in 2011 when Congress passed the AIA, which Director Kappos helped to shape. He then set to work implementing the Act\u2019s provisions, including the establishment of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, and restarting expansions and initiatives that had been interrupted by the recession.\n\nMeanwhile, Director Kappos and the USPTO succeeded in reducing pendency by several months. The number of unexamined utility patent applications shrank, too, as the backlog fell from about 750,000 in 2009 to about 609,000 in 2013. In the same period, the Trademark organization exceeded its targets for action and final pendency. In pursuit of greater efficiency, Director Kappos pushed for the replacement of antiquated information technology, reengineering many of the systems and processes that kept patent and trademark applications moving.\n\nUnder Director Kappos\u2019s leadership, new offices and institutions arrived that proved to be lasting. The USPTO gained a Chief Economist and its first permanent satellite location, the Elijah J. McCoy Midwest Regional Office in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nOther major milestones under Director Kappos\u2019s leadership include the issuance of patent 8 million and the attainment of fifth place for employee satisfaction among the 300-plus federal agency and agency subcomponents surveyed by the Partnership for Public Service in 2012. The USPTO had risen steadily in these rankings from 172nd place in 2009, just before Kappos assumed office, to first place, shortly after his departure.\n\nFurther reading\n\nDavid J. Kappos.

Among the objectives: extinguishing 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 and bringing back software patents. Last year we showed that an IBM lobbyist (paid millions by IBM) \u201cUsed COVID-19 Lies to Push for Software Patents From the Back Door, Undermining What Courts Have Determined\u201d (even the highest court); not even the EPO had gone that far in promotion of software patents.\n\nissues\n\n\u21ba USPTO\n\nshowed\n\n\u21ba IBM\n\n\u21ba highest court\n\n\u21ba EPO\n\n\u21ba software patents\n\n\u201cWe have many readers who use GNU/Linux, but we\u2019re not sure how many of them interact with patent offices.\u201dEarlier this year we mentioned how those same people misused the USPTO to reinforce Microsoft\u2019s monopoly. One of our readers has had enough and is taking action [PDF]. Bar complaint against Kappos was submitted the other day. \u201cI filed a bar complaint against Kappos in California,\u201d a reader told us, where he\u2019s a member of the bar. I\u2019ll file complaints in New York and Washington, DC, too \u2013 where he is also a member \u2013 but it seems to be a little more difficult than in California.\u201d\n\n\u21ba taking action\n\n\u21ba Kappos\n\n\u201cI will be very surprised if anything is done about my complaint. But, if they go so far as to contact Kappos about the complaint, it will have been worth it.\n\n\u201cThe issue I attacked him on is the \u201cElectronic Filing Incentive.\u201d You can read about it in the attached pdf.\n\n\u201cI live in rural West Virginia, so I have only been on the internet for 7-8 years, and, before that, I filed my applications through the post. No problem, until Kappos came along, and tried to force everybody to buy Microsoft and Lenovo.\n\n\u201cAt first, I used Windows \u2013 like everybody \u2013 but I bought Windows 8, which was junk, and I discovered Linux, which I\u2019ve been using for probably about 7 years.\n\n\u201cMost of the people at the USPTO are lawyers, it seems, and they are creating \u201cbarriers\u201d \u2013 as described in my pdf \u2013 against Linux users.\n\n\u201cMaybe somebody could file bar complaints against lawyers in the USPTO because of the barrier against Linux, using the complaint in my pdf as a guide. It would require some research to identify the lawyers, and then find out where their bar membership is: which state(s), and maybe Washington, DC.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do it. I use Linux, but don\u2019t really have the technical knowledge to make a strong complaint. Maybe you know somebody who could do it.\u201d\n\nWe have many readers who use GNU/Linux, but we\u2019re not sure how many of them interact with patent offices. Nevertheless, any action against behaviour such as this can only potentially improve things. We need to make ourselves noticeable/heard. Otherwise, systematic discrimination will carry on, reinforced by people whose top clients are proprietary software giants that pursue loads of software patents. \u2588\n\nsuch as this\n\nShare in other sites/networks: These icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages.\n\nPermalink > Image: Mail\n\nSend this to a friend\n\nPermalink\n\n\u21ba Send this to a friend\n\n----------\n\nTechrights\n\n\u27ae Sharing is caring.
