He arrived at CSU in September 1973, greatly relieved to have been hired at one of only two schools nationwide with a tenure possibility. He has enjoyed CSU ever since.\n\nHis book The Flying Circus of Physics was first published 41 years ago and was translated into at least 10 languages. The second edition was published in 2006 and is still being translated into other languages. For 16 years he toured his Flying Circus talk throughout the U.S. and Canada, introducing such physics stunts as the bed-of-nails demonstration and the walking-on-hot-coals demonstration to countless physics teachers, who then proceeded to hurt themselves when they repeated the stunts in their own classrooms. These talks led to his PBS television series Kinetic Karnival that was rerun nationally for years and which landed him a local Emmy, now proudly displayed in his first-floor bathroom. Since then he was on the Canadian radio Quirks and Quarks weekly for 11 years and, later, on the Discovery Channel Canada show Daily Planet numerous times.\n\nDuring his 13 years with Scientific American magazine, he wrote 152 articles for The Amateur Scientist section, which were translated into at least 9 languages world wide and had over 2 million readers each month. His topics ranged from the physics of judo to the physics of b\u00e9arnaise sauce and lemon meringue pies.\n\nIn 1990, he took over the textbook Fundamentals of Physics from David Halliday and Robert Resnick, the textbook he used in his first year at MIT. Since then he has published nine editions of the book, with 18 translations and selling over one million copies in North America and perhaps three or four million copies world wide (it is the number one book world wide in its market). He has lost count of the number of times he has been on television and radio and interviewed for newspapers and magazines. However, he clearly remembers the 20 minutes he spent performing on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, where he stuck his fingers into molten lead without losing any of them, to the great relief of his mother who was at home watching the show."}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/484295.Fundamentals_of_Physics", "page_content": "This was my first real physics textbook ever, so I've refrained from reviewing it, fearing that my nostalgia will could my objective thinking. But the time has come for me to share my thoughts.\n\n\n\nI gave Fundamentals of physics 5 stars a long time ago, in the spur of the moment. However, I won't change my mark now, for my feelings haven't changed. It's a great book for a beginner in real physics, for kids who have enrolled in an undergrad physics program and found out the not so pleasant truth: that all that they have learned in high school about physics was just a nice story, a set of approximations given to them just to inform them there exists something like physics. So in that sense, this book is excellent for bridging that gap between high school physics, and the real deal. There are questions that open each chapter, with the purpose to make the student think in terms of physics. The text of each chapter is done well - it's very easy to follow, and coupled with pictures and illustrations, it makes a very sweet read. The solved examples are a great help to students just starting out and trying to catch all the mathematical intricacies, and a myriad of exercises that accompany each chapter will certainly make a diligent student proficient in solving them. I also loved the fact that some of the exercises had solutions available on the Wiley site, either in the SSM or the ILW.\n\n\n\nAll in all, it's great for people just getting the hang of it. Those who are already well acquainted with physics won't see what the big deal is, but I'm sure that they will also find some didactic value in Halliday-Resnick-Walker's textbook.\n\n\n\nThere is one small downside; or rather a complaint of mine. While the parts concerning Mechanics, Electro(statics&dynamics) and Waves&optics were thorough and detailed, I felt there was too little of Thermodynamics in there. But that's not necessarily bad; that's, incidentally, the last of the General physics courses, so the student is, at that stage, able to find another textbook. But that doesn't detract nothing from my grade; it's going to stay a solid five stars."}, {"url": "https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Flying+Circus+of+Physics%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9780471762737", "page_content": "Hurry!
