stellar career as a Florida Gator gymnast, UF elementary education master\u2019s student Mackenzie Caquatto has remained centered as an athlete, big sister, teaching intern and role model.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, my parents always made sure that school came first,\u201c said Caquatto, a five-time collegiate All-American. \u201cBut being a college athlete has also taught me good time-management skills. I\u2019ve done a lot of homework on airplanes, and I\u2019ve had a lot of late-night study sessions \u2014 but I always get my work done.\u201d\n\nLast semester was particularly challenging for the aspiring special education teacher who helped lead the 2014 Gator gymnasts to their second straight national championship. While \u201cMacko,\u201d as her teammates called her, spent most of the fall semester teaching a fifth-grade class at Alachua Elementary School near Gainesville, she also attended four ProTeach classes and served as a student coach on the gymnastics team.\n\nShe also was a volunteer tutor for children with reading disabilities at a four-week summer camp last year, further demonstrating her resolve.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to be a teacher since I was 5 years old, so I\u2019ve been willing to do whatever it takes to get there,\u201d Caquatto said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t really feel like I\u2019m sacrificing anything because I love what I do.\u201d\n\nThe 5-foot-1 superstar from Naperville, Ill., expects to graduate with her M.Ed. degree in December and is thinking about ways to balance her considerable athletic talent with a teaching career.\n\n\u201cBeing a student coach has led me to think about coaching at the college level,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I also think about coaching younger athletes. I love working with kids of all ages, whether it\u2019s 6-year-olds or 20-year-olds.\u201d\n\nCaquatto said she recently experienced the vicarious thrills that come with coaching when she witnessed her younger sister, Bridgette, a junior All-American gymnast for the Gators, score a 9.95 to share the uneven bars title during a season opening win against Ball State. Bridgette also won the floor exercise title for the first time in her career with a 9.925.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been supportive of each other all our lives, and sometimes it\u2019s tough to watch each other compete,\u201d Mackenzie said. \u201cSometimes we just have to look the other way or hide behind someone, but I managed to watch \u2018Bridgey\u2019 nail two of her routines against Ball State. I couldn\u2019t have been any happier for her.\u201d\n\nCall it balanced reciprocity, but the bar on the uneven bars already had been set for Bridgette, who witnessed Mackenzie score a perfect 10 in that event last season \u2013 something only six others Gators have done.\n\nMackenzie said her sister was in tears after seeing the scoreboard.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll do the same thing when she gets a 10,\u201d big sister said.\n\nThe mutual support spills over into academics.\n\n\u201cI was always better at English and social studies, and Bridgey excelled in math and science,\u201d Mackenzie said. \u201cShe\u2019s always been very disciplined when it comes to studying and academics, so she makes a great study buddy during midterms and finals.\u201d\n\nMackenzie also says that being in the ProTeach program has prepared her for the \u201creal life\u201d experiences she expects to encounter in her teaching career.\n\n\u201cI remember the first time I presented lessons in front of 20 children,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was nerve-wracking, but not because it was difficult or I was scared of the kids. I just wondered if they\u2019d understand.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of a lesson is for all the students to understand the concept you\u2019re presenting, and you have to keep in mind the way each student learns and have a back-up plan if they don\u2019t understand. It feels like winning a competition when it works, but if it doesn\u2019t, well then it\u2019s kind of like going back to practice and fixing whatever went wrong and making it better.\n\n\u201cBut now that I\u2019ve got more experience creating lesson plans and using different teaching methods, I feel ready to handle my own classroom,\u201d Caquatto said with typical confidence. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m better prepared for becoming a winner in the classroom.\u201d\n\nChances are she\u2019ll score a perfect 10 there, too.\n\nContacts\n\nWriter: Stephen Kindland, College of Education Office of News and Communications; skindland@coe.ufl.edu; phone 352-273-3449."}, {"url": "https://region5gyminsider.com/region-5-rewind-region-5-elites-who-chased-olympic-glory-mackenzie-caquatto/", "page_content": "Mackenzie Caquatto started gymnastics in 1994 at the age of 3, her mom Lin took her to a Mommy & Me class and like many she was hooked instantly. Mackenzie who was born in Naperville, Illinois started her gymnastics career at Aerial Gymnastics Club. When Mackenzie, who also has a younger sister who was an Elite Gymnast, once told her mom during the 1996 Olympic Games that she one day would be an Elite with dreams of the Olympics, Mackenzie worked towards those goals everyday after that moment.\n\nWhile at Aerial Mackenzie was the 2007 JO National AA Champion, in 2007 Mackenzie would also compete in her first Elite competition the U.S. Classic held in Battle Creek, Michigan. Mackenzie then competed in the junior division at the 2007 Visa Championships finishing 16th in the AA. In 2008 the Olympic Year Mackenzie would become a Senior International Elite, which would now give her the opportunity to chase her Olympic Dream.\n\nIn the Olympic Year, Mackenzie competed at the U.S Classic finishing 1st on the Vault, 3rd on the Bars and 4th AA. This solid meet qualified her to the Visa Championships placing 10th in the AA securing her a spot on her first US National Team and a place at the U.S Olympic Team Trials. However, Mackenzie only competed in day 1 of the trials placing 12th in the AA on that specific day.\n\nIn 2009, Mackenzie began training along with her sister Bridgette at Naperville Gymnastics under two Chinese Olympians (Jiani Wu & Yuejiu Li). Mackenzie had a breakout year in 2009 having successful competitions at the U.S Classic and the U.S Nationals placing 3rd on the Uneven Bars and 5th in the AA then 2nd\n\non the Vault, Uneven Bars, 8th on the Floor and 3rd in the AA respectively despite suffering a pretty serious knee injury in June of 2009. After a successful showing at the US Championships Mackenzie was named to the World Championship Selection camp. She would be named as an alternate to the 2009 World Team. Mackenzie was them selected to represent Team USA at a few international competitions. The Toyota International Competition in Japan (2nd on bars), the USA-Germany Friendly Exchange (1st team, 2nd uneven bars, 3rd AA & vault ), the USA-France Exchange (1st team, 2nd AA & Vault) and then the USA-Japan Friendship Meet (1st team, vault & 2nd AA).\n\nIn 2010 Mackenzie found herself at a new gym, her coaches Jiani Wu & Yuejiu Li opened their own training facility in Naperville called Legacy Elite. Mackenzie started off her season representing Team USA at the City of Jesolo Trophy meet in Italy, where she placed 1st with the Team & 7th AA. Macko also competed at the CoverGirl Classic placing 2nd on Vault, Bars and 3rd in the AA, thus qualifying herself to the 2010 Visa Championships. At Championships she was 4th on Bars, 7th on Beam and 5th AA. Her placing at Championships would qualify her again to the USA National Team and onto the World Championship Selection Camp. Having been an alternate last year to the World Championships, in 2010 Mackenzie would selected at a Worlds Team member, at the final selection camp she won the AA. Mackenzie traveled to Rotterdam, Netherlands as part of Team USA. In Rotterdam, Mackenzie competed in the AA placing 9th in the qualifications, unfortunately she did not advance to the finals because of the two per country ruling. However, she did compete in the team finals on Bars and Vault contributing scores for both to the team. The USA Team ended up finishing 2nd behind the Russians.\n\nAfter the World Championships Mackenzie, who had previously committed to the University of Florida on a full ride scholarship started her season with the Gators. In her freshman season Mackenzie faced some injuries, but still competed in the AA for her team at the NCAA Championships, however once the NCAA season was over Mackenzie decided to wanted to make an elite comeback, so she returned to Legacy Elite at competed two events at the 2011 CoverGirl Classic finishing 4th on the Uneven Bars. At the 2011 Visa Championships she\u2019s competed in the AA finishing 4th, she also placed 2nd on the Uneven Bars. Mackenzie earned herself a spot on her 4th US National Team and a spot at the Worlds Selection Camp. Unfortunately, while doing a dismount off the beam she injured both her ankles and had to withdraw from the selection process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMackenzie returned to the University of Florida for her sophomore season, however she would only compete the Uneven Bars and eventually the balance beam. In 2012 the Gators placed 2nd as a Team at the NCAA Championships and Caquatto placed 6th on the Uneven Bars. In 2013, Mackenzie helped the Gators win their first NCAA National Championship in the schools history, she also placed 4th on the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam. In her final year as a Florida Gator Mackenzie once again helped lead her to their second NCAA Championship Team Title and placed 4th on the Uneven Bars.\n\nMackenzie had fought through injuries and adversity to find great success in her gymnastics career as an Elite & a Collegiate Student-Athlete. As a Florida Gator Mackenzie received many honors, as a Freshman she received SEC Freshman of the week honors, multiple event titles. As a sophomore she earned All-America first-team honors at the NCAA Championships for the Uneven Bars, All SEC Second Team member and she was a member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll. In 2011 as a Junior Caquatto, earned All-America first-team honors at the NCAA Championships for the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam, first-team All-American for the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam in the first National Association of Collegiate Gymnastics Coaches (NACGC) All-America regular-season awards, she was also the fifth Gator Gymnast to score a perfect 10 on the Uneven Bars and first since 2009, she was named the SEC Specialist of the Week, she also shared team\u2019s Heart & Soul award and was again a member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll and named to NACGC Scholastic All-America team.\n\nIn her final season she earned again first-team All-American honors for the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam at the NCAA Championships and the NACGC All-America regular-season awards. She also earned All-Southeastern Conference honors, she won 7 event titles throughout the season, she also was selected as a SEC Community Service team member, a recipient of $5,000 scholarship as a nominee for SEC Brad Davis Community Service award, was named co-Gator Heart & Soul Award recipient and received the \u201cCommunigator\u201d award at her team banquet. She was also a member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll for the 4th year in a row.\n\nMackenzie graduated in 2014 with a bachelors degree in elementary education, she has wanted to become a teacher since she was very young. After graduation she would go onto her graduate degree from the University of Florida, in 2015 she graduated with her Masters in Elementary and Special education. Currently she is in the second year of of Florida\u2019s three-year ProTeach program. Mackenzie can be seen in the stands at Gator Gymnastics Meets cheering on her former team, but most importantly her younger sister who is also a Florida Gymnast.\n\nLike many Region 5 Athletes before her Mackenzie chased her Olympic Dream, she however was plagued by injuries, but she did work hard, persevere and did something super hard and special, competing in both NCAA & Elite at the same time, not many have achieved this feat. Mackenzie found success at the University of Florida, and on the world stage. Thank you Mackenzie for inspiring not only the Elite & Olympic Hopefuls of Region 5, but all gymnasts in general. I hope through your teaching that you continue to inspire and education young people for generations to come.\n\nHere are Mackenzie\u2019s routines from the 2008 Olympic Trials and 2010 World Championships:\n\n2010 Worlds Beam, 2010 Worlds Floor, 2010 Worlds Bars,\n\n2008 Olympic Trials Vault\n\n***Pictures provided by Google Search, Info & Bio provided by USA Gymnastics, Wikipedia, Gator Gymnastics and Videos from Youtube Gymcat67 & Gymnweb Account***"}, {"url": "https://floridagators.com/news/2014/3/6/27550", "page_content": "By Rachel Whetstone \u2013 UF Communications\n\nShe's an All-American and a national champion. She scored a perfect 10 last year on the uneven bars, and her name will be immortalized on the wall of the Gators' gymnastics facility forever. Mackenzie, \u201cMacko,\u201d Caquatto is also a U.S. World Championship silver-medalist and a member of the Southeastern Conference Academic Honor Roll. She's an elementary and special education major, and she spends her days working in a fourth-grade classroom.\n\nHundreds of 8-to 12-year-olds scream when they hear the name of the senior from Naperville, Ill., announced in the Stephen C. O'Connell Center. They watch in awe as she flies through the air on the uneven bars and cheer when she sticks her landings after her near-perfect balance beam routines.\n\nHowever, not everyone is a fan.\n\nOne day, a little boy in her class informed her that he had come to the gymnastics meet that past weekend, but he made it clear that it was only because his sister wanted to go.\n\n\u201cSo I asked him, 'Did you have fun?'\u201d Caquatto said, laughing. \u201cHe said, 'No!,'\u201d\n\nShe's not too worried about it. She thinks he'll come around. It helps that she has supporters in her class too.\n\n\u201cRight before the Link-to-Pink meet, a little girl came running up to me with her planner,\u201d Caquatto said. \u201cShe said, 'Look I'm coming to your meet on Friday!' She was so excited.\u201d\n\nIt's hard for Caquatto to think about her collegiate career coming to an end.\n\n\u201cThis season has flown by incredibly fast,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery year, it gets faster and faster.\u201d\n\nHer last meet at home, Senior Night is going to be hard. She's sure there will be tears, but she said it has been a fantastic season so far with an amazingly talented group of gymnasts that she feels blessed to be teammates with.\n\n\u201cEven though it is Senior Night, our season isn't over yet, and there's more goals to accomplish after that,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are goals that we are going to reach, and that will really cap off the end of my year.\u201d\n\nCaquatto said her mother's entire family from New York will be in the stands on Senior Night. She hopes that the evening is fun for them, and she's grateful that they're coming.\n\n\u201cThat's really special,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of them haven't gotten the chance to see me compete in college before.\u201d\n\nIt also means the world to her that her sister, Bridgette, is on the team.\n\n\u201cI'll be able to share that special night with her,\u201d she said.\n\nCaquatto hopes to perform in the all-around for her last home meet so she can do her floor exercise with the Gator Chomp one last time with the O'Dome crowd. When deciding where to put the chomp in her routine, she wanted it to be very dramatic and noticeable.\n\n\u201cFor my senior year, I wanted to put it somewhere where everyone knew,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember competing in the second meet at home, and everyone in the stands got it, and I think you could hear a pin drop.\n\n\u201cI'm standing in the corner just thinking, 'Wow, that was awesome!\u201d Caquatto said. \u201cThen I'm like, 'Oh shoot, I gotta tumble! Focus now. Stop thinking about how great that Gator Chomp was!'\u201d\n\nAfterwards, Head Coach Rhonda Faehn hugged her and told her that it was the best Gator Chomp ever, Caquatto said.\n\nHer favorite memory of the last four years was the 2013 NCAA Championship.\n\n\u201cI've competed a lot in my life, and I have to say that was probably the highlight of my gymnastics career,\u201d she said. \u201cJust experiencing it with the team and with the emotions we went through, it was just a really special moment to have.\u201d\n\nCaquatto said that winning the Southeastern Conference Championship in 2012 and 2013 is also an experience that will always stick with her because of the strength of gymnastics talent in the conference.\n\n\u201cThere's a lot of hype around SECs so I love that as well,\u201d she said.\n\nShe can also never forget competing at home in Gainesville.\n\n\u201cThe fans, the crowd, just being a part of Gator Nation has just been incredible,\u201d Caquatto said. \u201cThere's nothing like it.\u201d\n\nOutside of the gym, her most cherished memories will be of the friendships she's made.\n\n\u201cThis team is just very special, and they do little, goofy things on the road that I'll always remember,\u201d she said.\n\nShe loves going to football games and baseball games and will miss her student tickets. She will also miss her favorite spots for sweets in Gainesville,\n\n\u201cI'm a dessert girl,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough she will no longer be competing after this season, Caquatto will not be leaving Gainesville for another two years. She graduates this summer with her bachelor's degree and will receive her master's in December of 2015. She also plans to stay here until Bridgette graduates.\n\n\u201cI will definitely be cheering on the team whether it's from the stands or on the floor,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said she hopes to be involved with the team in some regard, possibly as a student coach, if her schedule permits. Evident by the way she consistently cheers on and encourages her teammates, leadership is a quality Caquatto possesses and takes seriously.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, I liked having that role in the gym. I was always the oldest one of my group,\u201d she said. \u201cHere as and as a senior, I feel like it's important to be encouraging and to tell the girls, 'We believe in this, you can do this.'\u201d\n\nCaquatto has been doing gymnastics since she was 2, and she is sad for her college career to come to an end. However, she's had another dream growing up as well. She's always wanted to be a teacher.\n\n\u201cI found something else that I love that's challenging, and that's exciting for me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt'll be a nice transition for me because I know where I'm going and what I want to do.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/mackenzie-caquatto/", "page_content": "Mackenzie Caquatto (born March 26, 1992) is an American artistic gymnast. She was formerly on the US National Team. Her younger sister, Bridgette Caquatto, was also an elite gymnast on the senior US National Team. She first qualified as an elite gymnast in 2007 and competed at the 2007 US National Championships, where she finished 17th.\n\nMackenzie competed as a senior for the first time at the 2008 US National Championships and placed 10th overall. She was selected to be a member of her first national team and qualified to the 2008 US Olympic Team Trials, but competed only on the first day of competition, placing 12th in the all-around on that day.\n\nIn 2009, Caquatto competed at her first international meets as a member of the national team. Caquatto suffered a knee injury shortly after but managed to place 5th at the 2009 US National Championships. She was then invited to the world championships selection camp. She was named as the first alternate for the team. In addition to her status as an alternate, she was sent to the Toyota International in Toyota City, Japan. At this competition, she competed on the uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise; winning the silver medal on the uneven bars with a score of 14.675, only behind world silver medalist on the event, Koko Tsurumi of Japan.\n\nCaquatto started her 2010 season by competing at the City of Jesolo Trophy, where she had the highest beam score but made mistakes on the floor which kept her from medaling in the all-around. Caquatto competed at the 2010 CoverGirl Classic and placed 3rd in the all-around, scoring the second highest on vault and the uneven bars but falling from the balance beam. She had qualified to compete at the 2010 US National Championships. At the 2010 US National Championships, Mackenzie placed 5th in the all-around. She fell on a simple change grip skill on the uneven bars, her best event, placing 4th.\n\nAfter the US Nationals, Mackenzie was selected to attend a selection camp for the 2010 World Championships. From there, she advanced to the second camp where she won the all-around competition. She was eventually selected to compete.\n\nAt the World Championships, Mackenzie competed in the all-around in the qualifying round. After hitting all her routines without major error, she placed 9th individually and 3rd with the team. Although the top 24 qualifiers advance to the individual all-around final, she was left out because fellow American athletes Aly Raisman and Rebecca Bross had qualified ahead of her and only two athletes from each country can qualify to a final.\n\nAfter the qualifying round, Mackenzie was selected to compete on the uneven bars and the vault during the team finals. She contributed a 14.666 on the bars and a 15.000 on the vault to help the team win the silver medal behind Russia and ahead of China.\n\nShe competed as a Florida gator at the NCAA level for the 2010\u20132011 season where she became injured but still competed the all-around for her team at the NCAA Championships. After finishing the NCAA season, Mackenzie decided to train for a comeback to elite gymnastics for the 2011 season.\n\nMackenzie began her 2011 elite season by competing at the CoverGirl Classic. At the classic, she competed a slightly watered down balance beam routine and a solid uneven bars routine; scoring 14.100 and 14.750, respectively.\n\nAt the 2011 US Visa National Championships, Mackenzie surprised many by competing in the all-around. On day 1 of the competition, Mackenzie was in second place after the two rotations; after scoring a 14.700 and 15.000 on vault and uneven bars, respectively. Unfortunately, she counted her first fall on the balance beam. After having a solid floor exercise, she finished her night in sixth place with an all-around score of 56.000. On the final day of competition, Mackenzie competed solidly on all her events. Taking advantage of injuries to defending national champion Rebecca Bross and Chellsie Memmel, Mackenzie went on to finish the championships in fourth place behind Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, and champion Jordyn Wieber. She also took second place on the uneven bars just behind Wieber by 0.050.\n\nMackenzie was given a spot on her fourth national team and has been invited to compete at the first world team selection camp. She was considered to be a likely pick for the world team, but injured her ankles when dismounting the beam at the selection camp and therefore lost her chance of going to Tokyo. After sitting out the beginning of the NCAA season, she competed on the uneven bars in early 2012 and is expected to reintroduce her beam routine soon.\n\nCompetition skills\n\nMackenzie performed the following skills on bars, beam, floor, and vault as of 2010.\n\nApparatus Skills D Score Top Score in World Championship/World Cup/Olympic Competition Vault Double-Twisting Yurchenko 5.8 15.000 Uneven Bars Jump to high bar mount, Kip cast to reverse grip handstand, Jaeger (D), Kip cast to handstand, toe on piked Tkatchev (E) to Pak Salto (D), Kip cast to handstand, Maloney (D) to Bail (D) to toe-on full pirouette (D) to toe-on shoot to high bar, Kip cast to handstand, Tkatchev (D), Kip cast to handstand, giant, full twisting double tuck dismount (D) 6.2 14.666 Balance Beam Leap on to beam mount, side sommie (D), front aerial (D) to flip flop (B) to layout step-out (C), full turn with leg at horizontal (C), split jump to sissone, switch split leap 1/2 (D) to back tuck (C)*, front pike take off from one foot (C), switch split leap (C) to back tuck (or pike) (C), roundoff to double pike dismount (E) 5.7 (5.8*) 14.266 Floor Exercise Roundoff back handspring to full-in double pike (E) (triple twisting back layout (E)*), roundoff back handspring to a triple twisting back layout (E) (roundoff to 1 1\u2044 2 back layout (C) to full twisting front layout (C)*), double turn with leg at horizontal (D), tour jete 1/2 (C), switch split ring leap (C) to switch split leap 1/2 (C), roundoff to 1 1\u2044 2 twisting back layout (C) to full twisting front layout (C) (front handspring to double twisting front layout (D)*), roundoff back handspring double pike dismount (D) 5.6 (5.5*) 13.533 (With slightly watered down exercise)\n\n*Variation competed for 2011.\n\nCompetitive history\n\nSenior career history\n\nYear Competition Description Location Apparatus Rank-Final Score-Final Rank-Qualifying Score-Qualifying 2011 CoverGirl Classic Chicago, IL Uneven Bars 4 14.750 Balance Beam 12 14.100 U.S. Championships Saint Paul, MN All-Around 4 112.500 6 56.000 Uneven bars 2 29.750 2 15.000 Balance Beam 12T 26.700 18 12.650 Floor Exercise 10 27.200 6T 13.650\n\nYear Competition Description Location Apparatus Rank-Final Score-Final Rank-Qualifying Score-Qualifying 2010 CoverGirl Classic Chicago, IL All Around 3 56.450 Vault 2 14.850 Uneven Bars 2 15.050 Balance Beam 20 12.950 Floor Exercise 8 13.600 U.S. Championships Hartford, CT All-Around 5T 113.350 5T 56.800 Uneven bars 2 28.900 4 15.000 Balance Beam 7T 27.550 9 13.500 Floor Exercise 8 27.700 10T 13.700 World Gymnastics Championships Rotterdam, The Netherlands Team All-Around 2 175.196 3 233.643 All-Around 9 57.198 Vault 15.000 (team finals) 6 14.933 (no average) Uneven Bars 14.666 (team finals) 12 14.466 Balance Beam 21 14.266 Floor Exercise 39 13.533\n\nYear Competition Description Location Apparatus Rank-Final Score-Final Rank-Qualifying Score-Qualifying 2009 CoverGirl Classic Des Moines, IA Uneven Bars 9 13.350 U.S. Championships Dallas, TX All-Around 5 111.950 5 56.000 Uneven bars 3 29.000 4 14.450 Balance Beam 17 26.000 15 13.000 Floor Exercise 10 27.350 9 13.850 Toyota International Toyota City, Japan Uneven bars 2 14.675 Balance Beam 12 12.275 Floor Exercise 11 12.100"}, {"url": "https://floridagators.com/news/2013/2/7/24899.aspx", "page_content": "By Sarah Gibson, UF Communications\n\nJust a few weeks ago at the Missouri meet, junior All-American Mackenzie Caquatto accomplished something very few achieve in their gymnastics careers \u2013 a perfect.10.0.\n\n\u201cIt's every gymnast's goal, and what you work for is to be perfect,\u201d Caquatto said.\n\nAfter battling through injuries last year and only getting to compete in one event, Caquatto took the year to further develop her skills on bars and learned that even contributing on one event for the team still mattered.\n\n\u201cLast year was a learning experience for me not being able to compete all four events,\u201d Caquatto said. \u201cI realized if you do your one event well and you do your best you know the team is going to be happy for you. It doesn't matter if you do four events or one event; you still do it for the team.\u201d\n\nCaquatto attributes her perfect 10 on the uneven bars not only to the work she has put into it this season but the work she did on the event which earned her a spot in the NCAA event finals last season.\n\n\u201cLast year helped work toward that 10 because I practiced bars every day since that was the only thing I could do for the team,\u201d she said. \u201cI really tried to perfect everything when I did it. I never got a 10 last year, but I think working so hard last year has led me to it this year.\u201d\n\nThe celebration with her teammates after her perfect score, which has only happened six other times on bars in Gator Gymnastics history, was one of the best feelings she has had in college.\n\n\u201cKnowing that the team was there for me and that they supported me was a cool feeling,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was really nice to share that moment with those girls because they are my best friends too and my family here.\u201d\n\nCaquatto has enjoyed the addition of her younger sister, freshman Bridgette Caquatto, to the roster.\n\n\u201cI love having my sister here,\u201d Caquatto said. \u201cShe knows me better than anyone. She can read me and will tell me that one encouraging thing that will get me going if I am having a hard day.\u201d\n\nHaving Bridgette there to witness her first perfect score was really special.\n\n\u201cShe was crying, she was so excited,\u201d Caquatto said. \u201cI know she looks up to me so it was good to set something for her to work toward and she knows it's possible.\u201d\n\nThe Caquatto sisters get so nervous before each other's performances that they won't even watch each other's bars or beam routines.\n\n\u201cDuring bars or beam we will hide behind someone else or turn around,\u201d she said. \u201cI probably get just as nervous as she does for me when we are up on the equipment because we want each other to do well.\u201d\n\nOutside of the gymnastics world, Caquatto's focus is on her future in elementary school teaching, something she has aspired to do since taking an \u201cIntro to Teaching\u201d class in high school. In three years she will graduate with her master's degree in elementary education and special education. In between taking classes and practicing gymnastics, Caquatto tutors a six-year-old kindergarten girl in reading on Mondays and Wednesdays. For her one-on-one tutoring sessions she prepares a lesson plan, reads with the young girl and plays games with her.\n\n\u201cWe teach them the things they need to accomplish by the end of their kindergarten year,\u201d Caquatto said. \u201cWe help them improve on those skills by giving them fun ways to remember things.\u201d\n\nThe nerves she felt before her first tutoring session were somewhat comparable to the nerves she experiences prior to gymnastics competitions. And Caquatto, a four-time member of the U.S. Senior National team, has competed at the sports' highest level as she was part of the U.S.'s silver medal 2010 World Championships team.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of that same feeling I had at big competitions where I don't know what to expect and I don't know how well it is going to go or if I am going to be good at it,\u201d she said.\n\nSimilar to how she prepares for meets, she also practices in her classes so she will be prepared when different situations arise while teaching, which gives her more confidence as a teacher.\n\nLooking past gymnastics, it is a comfort for Caquatto to know exactly what she wants to do with her life and where she will be in just three years."}, {"url": "https://www.northwestern.edu/magazine/summer2013/feature/fifty-wildcat-greats/index.html", "page_content": "Fifty Wildcat Greats\n\nWe highlighted 50 of our favorite Northwestern athletes, and, with help from our readers, we picked our \"Top Cats\" \u2014 our all-time top 10 plus two fan favorites.\n\nSeveral fans weighed in on our 50 greatest Wildcats.

As a former elite who joined the Gators with a long list of accomplishments, she was part of two national and two SEC team titles in her time at Florida. Caquatto scored a perfect 10 on bars in her time at Florida and saw action consistently on all four events.FloGymnastics recently caught up with Caquatto to talk about her life after gymnastics:Caquatto: I graduated in 2014 with my bachelor's in elementary education. I then graduated in 2015 with my master's in elementary and special education. I got hired after graduation to teach fourth-grade math and science in Gainesville.I LOVE teaching and working with kids every day. I like to create my own atmosphere in the classroom and make it like a family. I like to do lots of hands-on activities and make their learning relatable. Each day is a new challenge, but I love that I can make an impact on their lives every day.Definitely winning two national championships and two SEC titles as a team! College was the best time of my life. I had amazing coaches who always wanted to best for you in all parts of your life. I made friends for life and loved being with my teammates who understood what I was going through and always had my back.Representing the University of Florida and being able to wear the \"F\" on my chest. I am still proud to wear my Florida gear and be a part of the Gator community.I miss the camaraderie with my teammates and having someone to support me all the time. I also miss competing and the feeling of adrenaline with my teammates.I was so happy when my sister came to Florida. We trained our whole lives together, so when I came to Florida first, it felt like part of me was missing. She knows me better than anyone and was able to be there for me and push me and encourage me.I think the year after I graduated I was living vicariously through her. It was really hard to be up in the stands. I wanted to be down on the floor cheering her on. It was great to see her win another national championship and have her time to shine. I was also so nervous watching her.Being a part of a national championship team. As a junior, I was a member of the first-ever gymnastics team to win a national championship at Florida, so that was pretty special.Rhonda was a very calm and encouraging coach, which was very contagious. Every time we went to compete she told us we could do and you could feel that she believed in you and knew you could do it. That has stuck with me as I am now a teacher and I encourage my students and believe in them. Rhonda also knew our limits and knew how to get us where we needed to be. She cared about each of us as a person and was more than a coach to us.I plan to stay dedicated to teaching, as that is another passion of mine. I want to find a way to stay connected to the sport of gymnastics. I may want to try college coaching or judging to stay involved with the sport I love. I am currently coaching summer camps, and I love doing that.My time at Florida really was the best experience ever as I was surrounded by awesome girls and coaches. College gymnastics was the cherry on top for me.

His 1,870 victories equate to an amazing .935 winning percentage. Ending with comeback attempts to make the 2012 U.S. Olympic team and 2014 U.S. World team, his storied career spanned an incredible five decades.\n\n\n\nFollowing a stellar high school career that included a state championship, Metzger wrestled in the 1979 World Championships in San Diego. He won the bronze medal and became the youngest American to medal in the World Championships at the age of 19 \u2013 a record that stood for 36 years.\n\n\n\nCombining freestyle, Greco-Roman and judo styles, Metzger changed the sport of wrestling and made it more exciting to watch. He is one of the few wrestlers to have a takedown move named after him -- The Metzger.\n\n\n\nAt the University of Oklahoma from 1979 to 1982, Metzger was a four-time All-American and two-time NCAA champion at 142 pounds, after he placed fifth and second his first two years. In 1980, he made a serious bid for a spot on the U.S. Olympic Team. Leading in a late-round match against 1977 NCAA champion Steve Barrett of Oklahoma State in the Olympic Trials, Metzger suffered an ankle fracture that ended his Olympic hopes. His quest for an Olympic Team spot four years later ended when he got a severe case of shellfish poisoning and couldn\u2019t compete in the final trials.\n\n\n\nIn national competition, Metzger won three freestyle and three Greco-Roman AAU Junior championships, as well as five AAU Senior freestyle championships with three runner-up finishes. Internationally, he earned two silver medals, three bronze and a fourth-place finish in the World Championships. He also captured two first-place titles in the Pan American Games and finished second in the 1986 Goodwill Games in Moscow.\n\n\n\nFor his prolific career, dedication and contributions to the sport of wrestling, Andre Metzger is honored as a Distinguished Member of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame."}], "Mackenzie Caquatto won the NCAA uneven bars title in 2016.": [{"url":

When Mackenzie, who also has a younger sister who was an Elite Gymnast, once told her mom during the 1996 Olympic Games that she one day would be an Elite with dreams of the Olympics, Mackenzie worked towards those goals everyday after that moment.\n\nWhile at Aerial Mackenzie was the 2007 JO National AA Champion, in 2007 Mackenzie would also compete in her first Elite competition the U.S. Classic held in Battle Creek, Michigan. Mackenzie then competed in the junior division at the 2007 Visa Championships finishing 16th in the AA. In 2008 the Olympic Year Mackenzie would become a Senior International Elite, which would now give her the opportunity to chase her Olympic Dream.\n\nIn the Olympic Year, Mackenzie competed at the U.S Classic finishing 1st on the Vault, 3rd on the Bars and 4th AA. This solid meet qualified her to the Visa Championships placing 10th in the AA securing her a spot on her first US National Team and a place at the U.S Olympic Team Trials. However, Mackenzie only competed in day 1 of the trials placing 12th in the AA on that specific day.\n\nIn 2009, Mackenzie began training along with her sister Bridgette at Naperville Gymnastics under two Chinese Olympians (Jiani Wu & Yuejiu Li). Mackenzie had a breakout year in 2009 having successful competitions at the U.S Classic and the U.S Nationals placing 3rd on the Uneven Bars and 5th in the AA then 2nd\n\non the Vault, Uneven Bars, 8th on the Floor and 3rd in the AA respectively despite suffering a pretty serious knee injury in June of 2009. After a successful showing at the US Championships Mackenzie was named to the World Championship Selection camp. She would be named as an alternate to the 2009 World Team. Mackenzie was them selected to represent Team USA at a few international competitions. The Toyota International Competition in Japan (2nd on bars), the USA-Germany Friendly Exchange (1st team, 2nd uneven bars, 3rd AA & vault ), the USA-France Exchange (1st team, 2nd AA & Vault) and then the USA-Japan Friendship Meet (1st team, vault & 2nd AA).\n\nIn 2010 Mackenzie found herself at a new gym, her coaches Jiani Wu & Yuejiu Li opened their own training facility in Naperville called Legacy Elite. Mackenzie started off her season representing Team USA at the City of Jesolo Trophy meet in Italy, where she placed 1st with the Team & 7th AA. Macko also competed at the CoverGirl Classic placing 2nd on Vault, Bars and 3rd in the AA, thus qualifying herself to the 2010 Visa Championships. At Championships she was 4th on Bars, 7th on Beam and 5th AA. Her placing at Championships would qualify her again to the USA National Team and onto the World Championship Selection Camp. Having been an alternate last year to the World Championships, in 2010 Mackenzie would selected at a Worlds Team member, at the final selection camp she won the AA. Mackenzie traveled to Rotterdam, Netherlands as part of Team USA. In Rotterdam, Mackenzie competed in the AA placing 9th in the qualifications, unfortunately she did not advance to the finals because of the two per country ruling. However, she did compete in the team finals on Bars and Vault contributing scores for both to the team. The USA Team ended up finishing 2nd behind the Russians.\n\nAfter the World Championships Mackenzie, who had previously committed to the University of Florida on a full ride scholarship started her season with the Gators. In her freshman season Mackenzie faced some injuries, but still competed in the AA for her team at the NCAA Championships, however once the NCAA season was over Mackenzie decided to wanted to make an elite comeback, so she returned to Legacy Elite at competed two events at the 2011 CoverGirl Classic finishing 4th on the Uneven Bars. At the 2011 Visa Championships she\u2019s competed in the AA finishing 4th, she also placed 2nd on the Uneven Bars. Mackenzie earned herself a spot on her 4th US National Team and a spot at the Worlds Selection Camp. Unfortunately, while doing a dismount off the beam she injured both her ankles and had to withdraw from the selection process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMackenzie returned to the University of Florida for her sophomore season, however she would only compete the Uneven Bars and eventually the balance beam. In 2012 the Gators placed 2nd as a Team at the NCAA Championships and Caquatto placed 6th on the Uneven Bars. In 2013, Mackenzie helped the Gators win their first NCAA National Championship in the schools history, she also placed 4th on the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam. In her final year as a Florida Gator Mackenzie once again helped lead her to their second NCAA Championship Team Title and placed 4th on the Uneven Bars.\n\nMackenzie had fought through injuries and adversity to find great success in her gymnastics career as an Elite & a Collegiate Student-Athlete. As a Florida Gator Mackenzie received many honors, as a Freshman she received SEC Freshman of the week honors, multiple event titles. As a sophomore she earned All-America first-team honors at the NCAA Championships for the Uneven Bars, All SEC Second Team member and she was a member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll. In 2011 as a Junior Caquatto, earned All-America first-team honors at the NCAA Championships for the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam, first-team All-American for the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam in the first National Association of Collegiate Gymnastics Coaches (NACGC) All-America regular-season awards, she was also the fifth Gator Gymnast to score a perfect 10 on the Uneven Bars and first since 2009, she was named the SEC Specialist of the Week, she also shared team\u2019s Heart & Soul award and was again a member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll and named to NACGC Scholastic All-America team.\n\nIn her final season she earned again first-team All-American honors for the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam at the NCAA Championships and the NACGC All-America regular-season awards. She also earned All-Southeastern Conference honors, she won 7 event titles throughout the season, she also was selected as a SEC Community Service team member, a recipient of $5,000 scholarship as a nominee for SEC Brad Davis Community Service award, was named co-Gator Heart & Soul Award recipient and received the \u201cCommunigator\u201d award at her team banquet. She was also a member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll for the 4th year in a row.\n\nMackenzie graduated in 2014 with a bachelors degree in elementary education, she has wanted to become a teacher since she was very young. After graduation she would go onto her graduate degree from the University of Florida, in 2015 she graduated with her Masters in Elementary and Special education. Currently she is in the second year of of Florida\u2019s three-year ProTeach program. Mackenzie can be seen in the stands at Gator Gymnastics Meets cheering on her former team, but most importantly her younger sister who is also a Florida Gymnast.\n\nLike many Region 5 Athletes before her Mackenzie chased her Olympic Dream, she however was plagued by injuries, but she did work hard, persevere and did something super hard and special, competing in both NCAA & Elite at the same time, not many have achieved this feat. Mackenzie found success at the University of Florida, and on the world stage. Thank you Mackenzie for inspiring not only the Elite & Olympic Hopefuls of Region 5, but all gymnasts in general. I hope through your teaching that you continue to inspire and education young people for generations to come.\n\nHere are Mackenzie\u2019s routines from the 2008 Olympic Trials and 2010 World Championships:\n\n2010 Worlds Beam, 2010 Worlds Floor, 2010 Worlds Bars,\n\n2008 Olympic Trials Vault\n\n***Pictures provided by Google Search, Info & Bio provided by USA Gymnastics, Wikipedia, Gator Gymnastics and Videos from Youtube Gymcat67 & Gymnweb Account***"}, {"url": "https://education.ufl.edu/news/2015/02/04/lifes-a-balancing-act-for-coe-student-and-all-america-gymnast/", "page_content": "Just as she maintained perfect equipoise on the balance beam during a stellar career as a Florida Gator gymnast, UF elementary education master\u2019s student Mackenzie Caquatto has remained centered as an athlete, big sister, teaching intern and role model.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, my parents always made sure that school came first,\u201c said Caquatto, a five-time collegiate All-American. \u201cBut being a college athlete has also taught me good time-management skills. I\u2019ve done a lot of homework on airplanes, and I\u2019ve had a lot of late-night study sessions \u2014 but I always get my work done.\u201d\n\nLast semester was particularly challenging for the aspiring special education teacher who helped lead the 2014 Gator gymnasts to their second straight national championship. While \u201cMacko,\u201d as her teammates called her, spent most of the fall semester teaching a fifth-grade class at Alachua Elementary School near Gainesville, she also attended four ProTeach classes and served as a student coach on the gymnastics team.\n\nShe also was a volunteer tutor for children with reading disabilities at a four-week summer camp last year, further demonstrating her resolve.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to be a teacher since I was 5 years old, so I\u2019ve been willing to do whatever it takes to get there,\u201d Caquatto said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t really feel like I\u2019m sacrificing anything because I love what I do.\u201d\n\nThe 5-foot-1 superstar from Naperville, Ill., expects to graduate with her M.Ed. degree in December and is thinking about ways to balance her considerable athletic talent with a teaching career.\n\n\u201cBeing a student coach has led me to think about coaching at the college level,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I also think about coaching younger athletes. I love working with kids of all ages, whether it\u2019s 6-year-olds or 20-year-olds.\u201d\n\nCaquatto said she recently experienced the vicarious thrills that come with coaching when she witnessed her younger sister, Bridgette, a junior All-American gymnast for the Gators, score a 9.95 to share the uneven bars title during a season opening win against Ball State. Bridgette also won the floor exercise title for the first time in her career with a 9.925.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been supportive of each other all our lives, and sometimes it\u2019s tough to watch each other compete,\u201d Mackenzie said. \u201cSometimes we just have to look the other way or hide behind someone, but I managed to watch \u2018Bridgey\u2019 nail two of her routines against Ball State. I couldn\u2019t have been any happier for her.\u201d\n\nCall it balanced reciprocity, but the bar on the uneven bars already had been set for Bridgette, who witnessed Mackenzie score a perfect 10 in that event last season \u2013 something only six others Gators have done.\n\nMackenzie said her sister was in tears after seeing the scoreboard.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll do the same thing when she gets a 10,\u201d big sister said.\n\nThe mutual support spills over into academics.\n\n\u201cI was always better at English and social studies, and Bridgey excelled in math and science,\u201d Mackenzie said. \u201cShe\u2019s always been very disciplined when it comes to studying and academics, so she makes a great study buddy during midterms and finals.\u201d\n\nMackenzie also says that being in the ProTeach program has prepared her for the \u201creal life\u201d experiences she expects to encounter in her teaching career.\n\n\u201cI remember the first time I presented lessons in front of 20 children,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was nerve-wracking, but not because it was difficult or I was scared of the kids. I just wondered if they\u2019d understand.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of a lesson is for all the students to understand the concept you\u2019re presenting, and you have to keep in mind the way each student learns and have a back-up plan if they don\u2019t understand. It feels like winning a competition when it works, but if it doesn\u2019t, well then it\u2019s kind of like going back to practice and fixing whatever went wrong and making it better.\n\n\u201cBut now that I\u2019ve got more experience creating lesson plans and using different teaching methods, I feel ready to handle my own classroom,\u201d Caquatto said with typical confidence. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m better prepared for becoming a winner in the classroom.\u201d\n\nChances are she\u2019ll score a perfect 10 there, too.\n\nContacts\n\nWriter: Stephen Kindland, College of Education Office of News and Communications; skindland@coe.ufl.edu; phone 352-273-3449."}, {"url": "https://gymcastic.com/a-gym-nerds-guide-to-ncaa-bars/", "page_content": "When Mackenzie Caquatto performed that bar routine in 2013, people flipped out.\n\n\u201cLike, how can she score a perfect 10 without a same-bar release? That\u2019s not a real bar routine!\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll admit that I was one of those people, but if I set aside my personal preference for a second, it\u2019s true; Caquatto the Elder performed a real bar routine that met all the college requirements. You see, in NCAA, gymnasts don\u2019t need to do a same-bar release like a Jaeger or a Tkatchev or a Gienger. They simply need two \u201cflight elements.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what the #$%^ is a \u201cflight element\u201d if it isn\u2019t a same-bar release?\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at what the #$%^ a flight element is, as well as the other requirements for college uneven bar routines\u2026\n\nTo recap: Did Caquatto the Elder\u2019s bar routine fulfill all the requirements?\n\nLet\u2019s look at the special requirements:\n\n\u2713 Two bar changes (Pak, Maloney, Shootover, Toe-Shoot) \u2713 Two flight elements (Maloney, Shootover, Toe-shoot) \u2713 Longitudinal turn, excluding the dismount (Shootover) \u2713 Minimum of a C dismount\n\nAnd now for the \u201ccompetitive level\u201d requirements:\n\n\u2713 D + D release combination (Maloney + Shootover to handstand) \u2713 D release (Maloney, Shootover) \u2713 D dismount (Full-in \u2013 E dismount)\n\nSo, brava, Caquatto the Elder! You found a way to score a 10 on one of the shortest bar routines ever!\n\nWhat\u2019s a \u201cCal Hop\u201d?\n\nIf you\u2019re an elite gym nerd, you have no clue what the Fuchs we\u2019re talking about. \u2018Cause no one does a \u201cCal Hop\u201d in elite gymnastics. No one. In college gymnastics, however, it\u2019s an easy way to receive credit for a \u201cflight\u201d element. Basically, you hop your hands from regular grip to reverse grip like this:\n\nFYI: It\u2019s a C in college gymnastics.\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with the following statement?\n\n\u201cUgh, if you\u2019re going to do a giant full into a double tuck, you better upgrade to a double pike.\u201d\n\nSimply put: You\u2019re thinking like an elite gymnastics fan.\n\nIn the FIG Code of Points, a double tuck is a B, and a double pike is a C. So, according to elite standards, a double pike would be an upgrade from a double tuck.\n\nHowever, college gymnastics uses the Junior Olympic Code of Points, and in that code, both a double tuck and a double pike are C elements. So, doing a double pike (a la Danusia Francis) is not an upgrade. It\u2019s just different.\n\nSpeaking of which\u2026 Why do we see so many \u201cgiant full to double tuck\u201d combinations?\n\nIf 2014 will be your first NCAA season, prepare yourself. You are going to see a metric buttload of \u201cgiant full to double tuck\u201d combinations \u2019cause quite frankly, it\u2019s one of the easiest ways to fulfill the dismount requirements.\n\nIn order to meet the special requirements, gymnasts have to do a C dismount, and a double tuck is a C dismount.\n\nIn order for a routine to be \u201cup to competitive level,\u201d the C dismount needs to be performed with connection bonus. A giant full (D) connected to a double tuck (C) receives 0.1 in bonus.\n\nSo, voil\u00e0, all the dismount requirements are fulfilled!\n\nAnd voil\u00e0, now you know a thing or two about NCAA bars. In case you missed it, we also wrote a Gym Nerd\u2019s Guide for NCAA Floor and a Gym Nerd\u2019s Guide for NCAA Beam.\n\nLeave a comment below if you have any questions!"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/mackenzie-caquatto/", "page_content": "Mackenzie Caquatto (born March 26, 1992) is an American artistic gymnast. She was formerly on the US National Team. Her younger sister, Bridgette Caquatto, was also an elite gymnast on the senior US National Team. She first qualified as an elite gymnast in 2007 and competed at the 2007 US National Championships, where she finished 17th.\n\nMackenzie competed as a senior for the first time at the 2008 US National Championships and placed 10th overall. She was selected to be a member of her first national team and qualified to the 2008 US Olympic Team Trials, but competed only on the first day of competition, placing 12th in the all-around on that day.\n\nIn 2009, Caquatto competed at her first international meets as a member of the national team. Caquatto suffered a knee injury shortly after but managed to place 5th at the 2009 US National Championships. She was then invited to the world championships selection camp. She was named as the first alternate for the team. In addition to her status as an alternate, she was sent to the Toyota International in Toyota City, Japan. At this competition, she competed on the uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise; winning the silver medal on the uneven bars with a score of 14.675, only behind world silver medalist on the event, Koko Tsurumi of Japan.\n\nCaquatto started her 2010 season by competing at the City of Jesolo Trophy, where she had the highest beam score but made mistakes on the floor which kept her from medaling in the all-around. Caquatto competed at the 2010 CoverGirl Classic and placed 3rd in the all-around, scoring the second highest on vault and the uneven bars but falling from the balance beam. She had qualified to compete at the 2010 US National Championships. At the 2010 US National Championships, Mackenzie placed 5th in the all-around. She fell on a simple change grip skill on the uneven bars, her best event, placing 4th.\n\nAfter the US Nationals, Mackenzie was selected to attend a selection camp for the 2010 World Championships. From there, she advanced to the second camp where she won the all-around competition. She was eventually selected to compete.\n\nAt the World Championships, Mackenzie competed in the all-around in the qualifying round. After hitting all her routines without major error, she placed 9th individually and 3rd with the team. Although the top 24 qualifiers advance to the individual all-around final, she was left out because fellow American athletes Aly Raisman and Rebecca Bross had qualified ahead of her and only two athletes from each country can qualify to a final.\n\nAfter the qualifying round, Mackenzie was selected to compete on the uneven bars and the vault during the team finals. She contributed a 14.666 on the bars and a 15.000 on the vault to help the team win the silver medal behind Russia and ahead of China.\n\nShe competed as a Florida gator at the NCAA level for the 2010\u20132011 season where she became injured but still competed the all-around for her team at the NCAA Championships. After finishing the NCAA season, Mackenzie decided to train for a comeback to elite gymnastics for the 2011 season.\n\nMackenzie began her 2011 elite season by competing at the CoverGirl Classic. At the classic, she competed a slightly watered down balance beam routine and a solid uneven bars routine; scoring 14.100 and 14.750, respectively.\n\nAt the 2011 US Visa National Championships, Mackenzie surprised many by competing in the all-around. On day 1 of the competition, Mackenzie was in second place after the two rotations; after scoring a 14.700 and 15.000 on vault and uneven bars, respectively. Unfortunately, she counted her first fall on the balance beam. After having a solid floor exercise, she finished her night in sixth place with an all-around score of 56.000. On the final day of competition, Mackenzie competed solidly on all her events. Taking advantage of injuries to defending national champion Rebecca Bross and Chellsie Memmel, Mackenzie went on to finish the championships in fourth place behind Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, and champion Jordyn Wieber. She also took second place on the uneven bars just behind Wieber by 0.050.\n\nMackenzie was given a spot on her fourth national team and has been invited to compete at the first world team selection camp. She was considered to be a likely pick for the world team, but injured her ankles when dismounting the beam at the selection camp and therefore lost her chance of going to Tokyo. After sitting out the beginning of the NCAA season, she competed on the uneven bars in early 2012 and is expected to reintroduce her beam routine soon.\n\nCompetition skills\n\nMackenzie performed the following skills on bars, beam, floor, and vault as of 2010.\n\nApparatus Skills D Score Top Score in World Championship/World Cup/Olympic Competition Vault Double-Twisting Yurchenko 5.8 15.000 Uneven Bars Jump to high bar mount, Kip cast to reverse grip handstand, Jaeger (D), Kip cast to handstand, toe on piked Tkatchev (E) to Pak Salto (D), Kip cast to handstand, Maloney (D) to Bail (D) to toe-on full pirouette (D) to toe-on shoot to high bar, Kip cast to handstand, Tkatchev (D), Kip cast to handstand, giant, full twisting double tuck dismount (D) 6.2 14.666 Balance Beam Leap on to beam mount, side sommie (D), front aerial (D) to flip flop (B) to layout step-out (C), full turn with leg at horizontal (C), split jump to sissone, switch split leap 1/2 (D) to back tuck (C)*, front pike take off from one foot (C), switch split leap (C) to back tuck (or pike) (C), roundoff to double pike dismount (E) 5.7 (5.8*) 14.266 Floor Exercise Roundoff back handspring to full-in double pike (E) (triple twisting back layout (E)*), roundoff back handspring to a triple twisting back layout (E) (roundoff to 1 1\u2044 2 back layout (C) to full twisting front layout (C)*), double turn with leg at horizontal (D), tour jete 1/2 (C), switch split ring leap (C) to switch split leap 1/2 (C), roundoff to 1 1\u2044 2 twisting back layout (C) to full twisting front layout (C) (front handspring to double twisting front layout (D)*), roundoff back handspring double pike dismount (D) 5.6 (5.5*) 13.533 (With slightly watered down exercise)\n\n*Variation competed for 2011.\n\nCompetitive history\n\nSenior career history\n\nYear Competition Description Location Apparatus Rank-Final Score-Final Rank-Qualifying Score-Qualifying 2011 CoverGirl Classic Chicago, IL Uneven Bars 4 14.750 Balance Beam 12 14.100 U.S. Championships Saint Paul, MN All-Around 4 112.500 6 56.000 Uneven bars 2 29.750 2 15.000 Balance Beam 12T 26.700 18 12.650 Floor Exercise 10 27.200 6T 13.650\n\nYear Competition Description Location Apparatus Rank-Final Score-Final Rank-Qualifying Score-Qualifying 2010 CoverGirl Classic Chicago, IL All Around 3 56.450 Vault 2 14.850 Uneven Bars 2 15.050 Balance Beam 20 12.950 Floor Exercise 8 13.600 U.S. Championships Hartford, CT All-Around 5T 113.350 5T 56.800 Uneven bars 2 28.900 4 15.000 Balance Beam 7T 27.550 9 13.500 Floor Exercise 8 27.700 10T 13.700 World Gymnastics Championships Rotterdam, The Netherlands Team All-Around 2 175.196 3 233.643 All-Around 9 57.198 Vault 15.000 (team finals) 6 14.933 (no average) Uneven Bars 14.666 (team finals) 12 14.466 Balance Beam 21 14.266 Floor Exercise 39 13.533\n\nYear Competition Description Location Apparatus Rank-Final Score-Final Rank-Qualifying Score-Qualifying 2009 CoverGirl Classic Des Moines, IA Uneven Bars 9 13.350 U.S. Championships Dallas, TX All-Around 5 111.950 5 56.000 Uneven bars 3 29.000 4 14.450 Balance Beam 17 26.000 15 13.000 Floor Exercise 10 27.350 9 13.850 Toyota International Toyota City, Japan Uneven bars 2 14.675 Balance Beam 12 12.275 Floor Exercise 11 12.100"}, {"url": "https://www.flogymnastics.com/articles/5038027-preview-ncaa-uneven-bar-final", "page_content": "\n\n\n\nThe race in the uneven bar final at this year's National Championships will be incredibly tight with so many talented athletes capable of winning the title.

They watch in awe as she flies through the air on the uneven bars and cheer when she sticks her landings after her near-perfect balance beam routines.\n\nHowever, not everyone is a fan.\n\nOne day, a little boy in her class informed her that he had come to the gymnastics meet that past weekend, but he made it clear that it was only because his sister wanted to go.\n\n\u201cSo I asked him, 'Did you have fun?'\u201d Caquatto said, laughing. \u201cHe said, 'No!,'\u201d\n\nShe's not too worried about it. She thinks he'll come around. It helps that she has supporters in her class too.\n\n\u201cRight before the Link-to-Pink meet, a little girl came running up to me with her planner,\u201d Caquatto said. \u201cShe said, 'Look I'm coming to your meet on Friday!' She was so excited.\u201d\n\nIt's hard for Caquatto to think about her collegiate career coming to an end.\n\n\u201cThis season has flown by incredibly fast,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery year, it gets faster and faster.\u201d\n\nHer last meet at home, Senior Night is going to be hard. She's sure there will be tears, but she said it has been a fantastic season so far with an amazingly talented group of gymnasts that she feels blessed to be teammates with.\n\n\u201cEven though it is Senior Night, our season isn't over yet, and there's more goals to accomplish after that,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are goals that we are going to reach, and that will really cap off the end of my year.\u201d\n\nCaquatto said her mother's entire family from New York will be in the stands on Senior Night. She hopes that the evening is fun for them, and she's grateful that they're coming.\n\n\u201cThat's really special,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of them haven't gotten the chance to see me compete in college before.\u201d\n\nIt also means the world to her that her sister, Bridgette, is on the team.\n\n\u201cI'll be able to share that special night with her,\u201d she said.\n\nCaquatto hopes to perform in the all-around for her last home meet so she can do her floor exercise with the Gator Chomp one last time with the O'Dome crowd. When deciding where to put the chomp in her routine, she wanted it to be very dramatic and noticeable.\n\n\u201cFor my senior year, I wanted to put it somewhere where everyone knew,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember competing in the second meet at home, and everyone in the stands got it, and I think you could hear a pin drop.\n\n\u201cI'm standing in the corner just thinking, 'Wow, that was awesome!\u201d Caquatto said. \u201cThen I'm like, 'Oh shoot, I gotta tumble! Focus now. Stop thinking about how great that Gator Chomp was!'\u201d\n\nAfterwards, Head Coach Rhonda Faehn hugged her and told her that it was the best Gator Chomp ever, Caquatto said.\n\nHer favorite memory of the last four years was the 2013 NCAA Championship.\n\n\u201cI've competed a lot in my life, and I have to say that was probably the highlight of my gymnastics career,\u201d she said. \u201cJust experiencing it with the team and with the emotions we went through, it was just a really special moment to have.\u201d\n\nCaquatto said that winning the Southeastern Conference Championship in 2012 and 2013 is also an experience that will always stick with her because of the strength of gymnastics talent in the conference.\n\n\u201cThere's a lot of hype around SECs so I love that as well,\u201d she said.\n\nShe can also never forget competing at home in Gainesville.\n\n\u201cThe fans, the crowd, just being a part of Gator Nation has just been incredible,\u201d Caquatto said. \u201cThere's nothing like it.\u201d\n\nOutside of the gym, her most cherished memories will be of the friendships she's made.\n\n\u201cThis team is just very special, and they do little, goofy things on the road that I'll always remember,\u201d she said.\n\nShe loves going to football games and baseball games and will miss her student tickets. She will also miss her favorite spots for sweets in Gainesville,\n\n\u201cI'm a dessert girl,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough she will no longer be competing after this season, Caquatto will not be leaving Gainesville for another two years. She graduates this summer with her bachelor's degree and will receive her master's in December of 2015. She also plans to stay here until Bridgette graduates.\n\n\u201cI will definitely be cheering on the team whether it's from the stands or on the floor,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said she hopes to be involved with the team in some regard, possibly as a student coach, if her schedule permits. Evident by the way she consistently cheers on and encourages her teammates, leadership is a quality Caquatto possesses and takes seriously.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, I liked having that role in the gym. I was always the oldest one of my group,\u201d she said. \u201cHere as and as a senior, I feel like it's important to be encouraging and to tell the girls, 'We believe in this, you can do this.'\u201d\n\nCaquatto has been doing gymnastics since she was 2, and she is sad for her college career to come to an end. However, she's had another dream growing up as well. She's always wanted to be a teacher.\n\n\u201cI found something else that I love that's challenging, and that's exciting for me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt'll be a nice transition for me because I know where I'm going and what I want to do.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/olympics/gymnastics/story/_/id/7000366/mackenzie-caquatto-sprains-ankle-us-gymnastics-selection-camp", "page_content": "INDIANAPOLIS -- Mackenzie Caquatto has sprained her ankle at the final selection camp for the world championships team, an injury that could have big implications for the U.S. squad.\n\nUSA Gymnastics says Caquatto is responding to treatment after the injury, which occurred Monday when she landed low on a beam dismount. It's not certain whether the injury will take her out of the running for the world team, expected to be announced later Wednesday.\n\nCaquatto is one of the best Americans on uneven bars, finishing second at last month's national championships. If she's unable to compete at worlds, it would be another setback on what is already the Americans' weakest event. Rebecca Bross, a two-time world medalist on bars, is out until next year after dislocating her kneecap at nationals."}]}
