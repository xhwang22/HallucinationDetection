The image is a still taken from a sequence of footage in the 1916 documentary film, The Battle of the Somme. The film was originally watched by millions of cinema-goers in 1916 and sequences from the film are now widely seen on television, in print and online. This iconic sequence lasts for around six seconds and shows a soldier carrying a wounded comrade on his back as he walks along a trench towards the camera.\n\nThe footage is believed to have been shot on 1 July 1916 by Lieutenant Geoffrey Malins, one of two 'War Office Official Kinematographers' (the other was Lieutenant John B McDowell) who filmed The Battle of the Somme. IWM has received over one hundred different names for the soldier carrying his dying comrade. We feel the question of the soldier's identity has still not been definitively proven. However, by examining the film frame by frame we have been able to learn a great deal about the rescue and its context.\n\nThis article reveals what we've discovered so far."}, {"url": "https://northeastlore.com/2020/04/20/north-east-victoria-cross-winners/", "page_content": "This is a list of 25 soldiers and sailors from the north east who have received the highest award for bravery.

During the night a strong attack was beaten off, but about 11 a.m. the enemy again launched a violent attack and pushed forward a bridging party into the sunken bottom of the river. Second Lieutenant Annand attacked this party, but when ammunition ran out he went forward himself over open ground, with total disregard for enemy mortar and machine-gun fire. Reaching the top of the bridge, he drove out the party below, inflicting over twenty casualties with hand grenades. Having been wounded he rejoined his platoon, had his wound dressed, and then carried on in command.\n\nRichard Annand\u2019s platoon sergeant said later \u201cMr Annand came to me at platoon headquarters and asked for a box of grenades as they could hear Jerry trying to repair the bridge. Off he went and he sure must have given them a lovely time because it wasn\u2019t a great while before he was back for more.\n\nDuring the evening another attack was launched and again Second Lieutenant Annand went forward with hand grenades and inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy.

This Officer was in command of the Naval Storming Parties embarked in Iris II. When Iris II proceeded alongside the Mole great difficulty was experienced in placing the parapet anchors owing to the motion of the ship. An attempt was made to land by the scaling ladders before the ship was secured. Lieutenant Claude E. K. Hawkings (late Erin) managed to get one ladder in position and actually reached the parapet, the ladder being crushed to pieces just as he stepped off it. This very gallant young officer was last seen defending himself with his revolver. He was killed on the parapet. Though securing the ship was not part of his duties, Lieut.-Commander Bradford climbed up the derrick, which carried a large parapet anchor and was rigged out over the port side; during this climb the ship was surging up and down and the derrick crashing on the Mole. Waiting his opportunity he jumped with the parapet anchor on to the Mole and placed it in position. Immediately after hooking on the parapet anchor Lieut.-Commander Bradford was riddled with bullets from machine guns and fell into the sea between the Mole and the ship. Attempts to recover his body failed. Lieut.-Commander Bradford\u2019s action was one of absolute self-sacrifice; without a moment\u2019s hesitation he went to certain death, recognising that in such action lay the only possible chance of securing Iris II and enabling her storming parties to land.\n\nFind Out More\n\nhttp://www.vconline.org.uk/george-n-bradford-vc/4585990490\n\nHugh Cairns (1896 \u2013 1918)\n\nPlace of birth: Ashington, Northumberland\n\nUnit: 46th Battalion, CEF\n\nRank (at time of VC action): Sergeant\n\nConflict: World War 1\n\nCitation\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery before Valenciennes on 1st November, 1918, when a machine gun opened on his platoon.

Shortly afterwards, the enemy attacked this position under cover of an artillery concentration and in great strength, comprising, as it later transpired, a battalion of the 15 Panzer Grenadiers supported by six self-propelled guns. All the tanks, including Guardsman Charlton\u2019s, were hit; the infantry were hard pressed and in danger of being over-run.\n\nWhereupon, entirely on his own initiative, Guardsman Charlton decided to counterattack the enemy. Quickly recovering the Browning from his damaged tank, he advanced up the road in full view of the enemy, firing the Browning from his hip. Such was the boldness of his attack and the intensity of his fire that he halted the leading enemy company, inflicting heavy casualties on them. This effort at the same time brought much needed relief to our own infantry.\n\nFor ten minutes Guardsman Charlton fired in this manner, until wounded in the left arm. Immediately, despite intense enemy fire, \u2018he mounted his machine gun on a nearby fence, which he used to support his wounded left arm. He stood firing thus for a further ten minutes until he was again hit in the left arm which fell away shattered and useless.\n\nAlthough twice wounded and suffering from Boss of blood, Guardsman Charlton again lifted his machine gun on to the fence, now having only one arm with which to fire and reload. Nevertheless, he still continued to inflict casualties on the enemy, until finally;\u201d he was hit for the third time and collapsed. He died later of his wounds in enemy hands. The heroism and determination of this Guardsman in his self-imposed task were beyond all praise. Even his German captors were amazed at his valour.\n\nGuardsman Charlton\u2019s courageous and self-sacrificing action not only inflicted extremely heavy casualties on the enemy and retrieved his comrades from a desperate situation, but also enabled the position to be speedily recaptured.\n\nFind Out More\n\nhttp://www.vconline.org.uk/edward-c-charlton-vc/4586173202\n\nGeorge Bell Chicken (1833 \u2013 1860)\n\nPlace of birth: Wallsend, Tyne and Wear\n\nUnit: Indian Naval Brigade\n\nRank (at time of VC action): Master (Civilian Volunteer)\n\nConflict: Indian Mutiny\n\nCitation\n\nIndian Naval Brigade.

After firing his revolver into the enemy, he seized a Mills grenade and threw it into the hostile team, putting the gun out of action, killing four of the team and wounding two others.

Fusilier Donnini\u2019s platoon was ordered to attack a small village.\n\nAs they left their trenches the platoon came under concentrated machine gun and rifle fire from the houses and Fusilier Donnini was hit by a bullet in the head.

Under heavy fire at seventy yards range Fusilier Donnini and two companions crossed an open space and reached the cover of a wooden barn, thirty yards from the enemy trenches.\n\nFusilier Donnini, still bleeding profusely from his wound, went into the open under intense close range fire and carried one of his companions, who had been wounded, into the barn. Taking a Bren gun he again went into the open, firing as he went.\n\nHe was wounded a second time but recovered and went on firing until a third bullet hit a grenade which he was carrying and killed him.\n\nThe superb gallantry and self-sacrifice of Fusilier Donnini drew the enemy fire away from his companions on to himself. As the result of this, the platoon were able to capture the position, accounting for thirty Germans and two machine guns.\n\nThroughout this action, fought from beginning to end at point blank range, the dash, determination and magnificent courage of Fusilier Donnini enabled his comrades to overcome an enemy more than twice their own number.\n\nFind Out More\n\nhttp://www.vconline.org.uk/dennis-donnini-vc/4586533050\n\nBasil John Douglas Guy (1882 \u2013 1956)\n\nPlace of birth: Bishop Auckland\n\nUnit: Royal Navy\n\nRank (at time of VC action): Midshipman (on board HMS Barfleur)\n\nConflict: Boxer Rebellion\n\nCitation\n\nOn 13th July 1900, during the attack on Tientsin City, a very heavy cross-fire was brought to bear on the Naval Brigade, and there were several casualties.

When enemy bombing attacks had set on fire many tons of hand grenades on Namsos wharf, with no shore water supply available, Lieutenant Stannard ran Arab\u2019s bows against the wharf and held her there. Sending all but two of his crew aft, he then endeavoured for two hours to extinguish the fire with hoses from the forecastle. He persisted in this work till he had to give up the attempt as hopeless.\n\nAfter helping other ships against air attacks, he placed his own damaged vessel under shelter of a cliff, landed his crew and those of two other trawlers, and established an armed camp. Here those off duty could rest while he attacked enemy aircraft which approached by day, and kept anti-submarine watch during the night.\n\nWhen another trawler near-by was hit and set on fire by a bomb, he, with two others, boarded Arab and moved her 100 yards before the other vessel blew up. Finally, when leaving the fjord, he was attacked by a German bomber which ordered him to steer East or be sunk. He held on his course, reserved his fire till the enemy was within 800 yards, and then brought the aircraft down.\n\nThroughout a period of five days Arab was subjected to 31 bombing attacks and the camp and Lewis gun positions ashore were repeatedly machine-gunned and bombed; yet the defensive position was so well planned that only one man was wounded.\n\nLieutenant Stannard ultimately brought his damaged ship back to an English port. His continuous gallantry in the presence of the enemy was magnificent, and his enterprise and resource not only caused losses to the Germans but saved his ship and many lives.\n\nFind Out More\n\nhttp://www.vconline.org.uk/richard-b-stannard-vc/4588279339\n\nAdam Herbert Wakenshaw (1914 \u2013 1942)\n\nPlace of birth: Newcastle upon Tyne\n\nUnit: Durham Light Infantry\n\nRank (at time of VC action): Private\n\nConflict: World War 2\n\nCitation\n\nOn the 27th June, 1942, south of Mersa Matruh, Private Wakenshaw was a member of the crew of a 2-pounder anti-tank gun. An enemy tracked vehicle towing a light gun came within short range. The gun crew opened fire and succeeded in immobilising the enemy vehicle. Another mobile gun came into action, killed or seriously wounded the crew manning the 2-pounder, including Private Wakenshaw, and silenced the 2-pounder. Under intense fire, Private Wakenshaw crawled back to his gun. Although his left arm was blown off, he loaded the gun with one arm and fired five more rounds, setting the tractor on fire and damaging the light gun. A direct hit on the ammunition finally killed him and destroyed the gun. This act of conspicuous gallantry prevented the enemy from using their light gun on the infantry Company which was only 200 yards away. It was through the self sacrifice and courageous devotion to duty of this infantry anti-tank gunner that the Company was enabled to withdraw and to embus in safety.\n\nFind Out More\n\nhttp://www.vconline.org.uk/adam-h-wakenshaw-vc/4588398535\n\nThomas Young (1895 \u2013 1966)\n\nPlace of birth: Boldon, Tyne and Wear\n\nUnit: Durham Light Infantry\n\nRank (at time of VC action): Private\n\nConflict: World War 1\n\nCitation\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery in face of the enemy when acting as a stretcher-bearer.

Suddenly taken under fire by 2 enemy machine guns not more than 15 yards away while clearing out hostile positions holding up the advance of his platoon through a narrow gully, Pfc. Mason, alone and entirely on his own initiative, climbed out of the gully and moved parallel to it toward the rear of the enemy position. Although fired upon immediately by hostile riflemen from a higher position and wounded repeatedly in the arm and shoulder, Pfc. Mason grimly pressed forward and had just reached his objective when hit again by a burst of enemy machine gun fire, causing a critical wound to which he later succumbed. With valiant disregard for his own peril, he persevered, clearing out the hostile position, killing 5 Japanese, wounding another and then rejoining his platoon to report the results of his action before consenting to be evacuated.

When his rifle platoon was halted by heavy surprise fire from well-camouflaged enemy positions, Pfc. Witek daringly remained standing to fire a full magazine from his automatic at point-blank range into a depression housing Japanese troops, killing 8 of the enemy and enabling the greater part of his platoon to take cover. During his platoon's withdrawal for consolidation of lines, he remained to safeguard a severely wounded comrade, courageously returning the enemy's fire until the arrival of stretcher bearers, and then covering the evacuation by sustained fire as he moved backward toward his own lines. With his platoon again pinned down by a hostile machine gun, Pfc. Witek, on his own initiative, moved forward boldly to the reinforcing tanks and infantry, alternately throwing hand grenades and firing as he advanced to within 5 to 10 yards of the enemy position, and destroying the hostile machine gun emplacement and an additional 8 Japanese before he himself was struck down by an enemy rifleman. His valiant and inspiring action effectively reduced the enemy's firepower, thereby enabling his platoon to attain its objective, and reflects the highest credit upon Pfc.

When the section leader became a casualty under a heavy mortar barrage shortly after landing, Pfc. Skaggs promptly assumed command and led the section through intense fire for a distance of 200 yards to a position from which to deliver effective coverage of the assault on a strategic cliff. Valiantly defending this vital position against strong enemy counterattacks during the night, Pfc. Skaggs was critically wounded when a Japanese grenade lodged in his foxhole and exploded, shattering the lower part of one leg. Quick to act, he applied an improvised tourniquet and, while propped up in his foxhole, gallantly returned the enemy's fire with his rifle and hand grenades for a period of 8 hours, later crawling unassisted to the rear to continue the fight until the Japanese had been annihilated.

Ordered to take that portion of the hill within his zone of action, Capt. Wilson initiated his attack in mid afternoon, pushed up the rugged, open terrain against terrific machine gun and rifle fire for 300 yards and successfully captured the objective. Promptly assuming command of other disorganized units and motorized equipment in addition to his own company and 1 reinforcing platoon, he organized his night defenses in the face of continuous hostile fire and although wounded 3 times during this 5 hour period, completed his disposition of men and guns before retiring to the company command post for medical attention. Shortly thereafter, when the enemy launched the first of a series of savage counterattacks lasting all night, he voluntarily rejoined his besieged units and repeatedly exposed himself to the merciless hail of shrapnel and bullets, dashing 50 yards into the open on one occasion to rescue a wounded Marine lying helpless beyond the front lines. Fighting fiercely in hand-to-hand encounters, he led his men in furiously waged battle for approximately 10 hours, tenaciously holding his line and repelling the fanatically renewed counter thrusts until he succeeded in crushing the last efforts of the hard-pressed Japanese early the following morning. Then organizing a 17 man patrol, he immediately advanced upon a strategic slope essential to the security of his position and, boldly defying intense mortar, machine gun, and rifle fire which struck down 13 of his men, drove relentlessly forward with the remnants of his patrol to seize the vital ground. By his indomitable leadership, daring combat tactics, and valor in the face of overwhelming odds, Capt. Wilson succeeded in capturing and holding the strategic high ground in his regimental sector, thereby contributing essentially to the success of his regimental mission and to the annihilation of 350 Japanese troops.

But as terrible as the Axis leaders were, the individual footman in every army was just a human being\u2014frightened, thrown into war, and doing his best to survive. For all the horror, a few men stepped across military lines and saved the lives of enemy soldiers in need.\n\n10 A Nazi Squadron Fought To Protect China Against The Japanese\n\nBefore the war began, China hired German soldiers to train their men. When Japan invaded in 1937, some of those German instructors were stuck inside China.\n\nWithout orders from Hitler, the men agreed that \u201cthere could be no question of leaving our Chinese friends to their fate.\u201d The German-trained 88th Division mobilized to protect China. They went out to the front lines at every opportunity and fought fiercely against Japanese troops.\n\nWhen the Japanese reached Nanjing, the Chinese government ordered the Germans to go home, believing they had no chance of defending it. Even so, some in the 88th Division stayed on, doing their best to save their Chinese friends.\n\nMost of the Germans who fought in Nanjing died in the battle. According to some stories, though, some Germans survived, escaped into the wilderness, and spent the rest of the war fighting alongside Chinese guerillas.\n\n9 A German Officer Died Trying To Rescue A Wounded American\n\nLieutenant Friedrich Lengfeld was a German officer leading a group of riflemen against invading US troops. He was holding his position at the edge of a minefield, daring the Americans to fight, when he heard someone calling for help.\n\nLying wounded in the minefield, a US soldier repeatedly cried out, \u201cHelp me!\u201d Taking pity on him, Lengfeld ordered his men not to shoot when the Americans came to rescue him.\n\nHours went by, though, and no US soldier was brave enough to rush for his friend. Finally, Lengfeld organized a rescue squad and went into the minefield to save the soldier.\n\nTragically, Lengfeld stepped on a covered land mine and died. There\u2019s also no indication that the American survived. Still, Lengfeld died doing something few were brave enough to do\u2014and earned a plaque honoring him from the US army.\n\n\n\n\n\n8 A Romanian Princess Saved 1,000 Allies Who Were Bombing Her Country\n\nDuring World War II, Romania allied itself with the Nazis. Princess Catherine Caradja, though, wasn\u2019t happy about it. She had spent her childhood in England and didn\u2019t trust Hitler\u2019s ideas.\n\nWhen planes started bombing oilfields in her country, Caradja took custody of every surviving Allied crewman shot down over Romanian skies. She had them sent to her own hospitals, where they were treated like guests and given the best medical treatment.\n\nOnce the men recovered, Caradja helped them escape to Italy, which had already been liberated. By the end of the war, she had saved the lives of more than 1,000 men.\n\n7 A Japanese Officer Gave A Football Star His Ring Back\n\nBefore he joined the army, Mario \u201cMotts\u201d Tonelli was in the NFL. He had also played fullback for Notre Dame. After he enlisted, though, he was captured by Japanese soldiers and forced to march 100 kilometers (60 mi) toward a prison camp with 70,000 other prisoners.\n\nThe Japanese guards confiscated every item in the prisoners\u2019 possession, but Motts didn\u2019t want to give up his golden graduation ring. A guard threatened Motts with a bayonet before he handed it over.\n\nThen something unexpected happened. A Japanese officer returned with Motts\u2019s ring in his hand. The officer had studied in America and seen Motts play. \u201cYou were a hell of a player,\u201d he said, handing the ring back to his prisoner. \u201cGood luck.\u201d\n\nMotts still went to a prison camp and suffered horribly from malaria, dysentery, and scurvy.\n\nBut he had his ring.\n\n\n\n\n\n6 A German Pilot Escorted An American Plane To Safety\n\nLieutenant Franz Stigler, one of Germany\u2019s best pilots, was ordered to shoot down a B-17 bomber, the last kill he needed to earn Germany\u2019s highest medal of valor. But he didn\u2019t do it.\n\nAs he approached the plane, he noticed that it was flying unusually close to the ground. The rear was riddled with bullet holes, and he could see that the men inside were injured and panicked. Gunning them down now, Stigler decided, wouldn\u2019t be a military operation. It would be murder.\n\nFlying alongside the bomber\u2019s wings, Stigler signaled to the pilot and flew them all the way across the North Sea, where they could fly to safety. By making sure that German gunners didn\u2019t shoot down the American plane, Stigler saved the men\u2019s lives.\n\n5 Germans Fought With Allies To Defend An Austrian Castle\n\nCastle Itter, a medieval castle in Austria, was used to hold French VIPs as prisoners. Toward the end of the war, though, it was becoming harder to hold and the frightened German officers inside fled. When the Germans found out, they tried to take the castle back. But the French prisoners weren\u2019t going to give up that easily.\n\nThey made friends with Kurt-Siegfried Schrader, an SS officer in the camp. With his help, they took the weapons left behind, sent out a scout to call for help, and prepared for battle. Soon, a small troop of 15 American soldiers and three members of the Austrian Resistance joined them.\n\nIn time, word of their fight reached a US battalion that rushed in and saved the day.\n\n\n\n\n\n4 British Pilots Saved The German Men They\u2019d Shot Down\n\nA trio of British planes ran an attack on a German aircraft and sent it crashing into the Norwegian mountainside, miles from civilization. On the way back, one of the British planes\u2019 engines failed. Captain Partridge and his radio operator, Lieutenant Bostock, had to make an emergency landing.\n\nPartridge and Bostock made their way through heavy snow and hid out in a hunter\u2019s cabin, only to find the survivors of the German plane in the snow. Using broken German, they pretended that they weren\u2019t the men who had shot down the plane and invited the Germans to use the hut.\n\nAfterward sharing breakfast in the hut, Partridge and a German named Strunk went to find help. Unfortunately, a Norwegian man in town shot Strunk on the spot. But the rest of his crew survived.\n\n3 A German General Refused To Kill Jewish Prisoners Of War\n\nErwin Rommel, one of Hitler\u2019s most successful generals, spent most of the war fighting in Africa. There, he led his men from the front flank, risking his own life in a way that was uncommon at that time. When he captured soldiers, though, he ignored orders from the head office to execute every Jewish prisoner of war.\n\nBy the time he returned to Europe, he was concerned about Hitler\u2019s movements and met with conspirators to remove Hitler from power. Rommel\u2019s plot never played out. He was caught by the Reich, who came to his home and gave him a cyanide capsule and a choice: Kill yourself with honor, or be hanged for treason.\n\nRommel held his family close for the last time, bade them farewell, and swallowed the capsule. Then he stepped into an army car and let them drive him away, waiting for the poison to do its work.\n\n\n\n\n\n2 A Nazi Officer Helped A Jewish Musician Survive The War\n\nWilhelm Hosenfeld, a Nazi officer stationed in Warsaw, watched the Holocaust unfold before his eyes. The experience deeply unsettled him, and he spent his time scribbling in diaries about the horrific abuse he saw inflicted upon Jews and Poles.\n\nWhen the war was coming to a close, he started to do something about it. First, he helped a Jewish escapee named Leon Warm by giving him a false identity and a job. Then he helped a musician named Wladyslaw Szpilman, giving him food and supplies to help him survive.\n\nWhen the war ended, Hosenfeld was taken prisoner by the Soviets for war crimes. The men he saved tried to petition for his release, but they were ignored. Hosenfeld died in a Russian prison camp, suffering a series of strokes.\n\n1 A Japanese Boy Saved A Prisoner Of War\n\nCaptured by Japanese soldiers, Carl Ruse was thrown into forced labor at the Yokkaichi-Ishihara Sangyo prison camp. He suffered and starved while he slaved and soon withered to a mere 36 kilograms (80 lb).\n\nFumio Nishiwaki, a 14-year-old boy working in the factory, saw Ruse and took pity. Whenever Nishiwaki had the chance, he took spare scraps of food and fed them to Carl, giving him the sustenance to stay alive until the end of the war.\n\nCarl kept a picture of the boy when he left the prison camp and held on to it until the day he died. According to his family, the boy and the picture reminded him that there was some good in the world. Nishiwaki\u2019s act of kindness was the one thing that kept Carl sane after the horrors of war.\n\nfact checked by Jamie Frater"}, {"url": "https://www.historyhit.com/victoria-cross-winners-of-world-war-one/", "page_content": "The Victoria Cross is the highest award for bravery which can be given to British and Commonwealth soldiers.

During his final 26 battles he destroyed 11 hostile aeroplanes, often flying alone against five or six German planes.\n\nFinally, on 7 May 1917, Ball led an attack on the squadron commanded by Lother von Richthofen, the Red Baron\u2019s younger brother, near Annoeullin in northern France. Ball was shot down and died during the struggle, and was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.\n\nLieutenant Albert Ball, VC (Image Credit: photograph Q 69593 from the Imperial War Museums / Public Domain).\n\n2. Boy Seaman Jack Cornwell\n\nBoy Seaman First Class Jack Cornwell was the youngest man to be awarded the Victoria Cross in the First World War. On 31 May 1916, during the Battle of Jutland, Cornwell was serving as a sight-setter on a gun aboard the HMS Chester.\n\nThe ship came under intense fire, and all of his gun crew were killed or mortally injured. Despite suffering severe wounds, including metal shards through his chest, Cornwell stayed at his post for the duration of the battle. He died from his wounds three days later, aged just 16 years old.\n\nBoy Seaman Jack Cornwell, VC\n\n3. Naik Shahamad Khan\n\nOn 12 April 1916, Naik Shahamad Khan of the 89th Punjabis was serving in Mesopotamia when he earned the Victoria Cross for his valour. Khan was in charge of a machine gun in an exposed position, covering a gap in the British lines.\n\nHe beat off three enemy attacks and worked the gun single-handedly when most of his men became casualties. After his gun was knocked out, he and two men held off the enemy with their rifles. When his section finally withdrew, he brought back a severely wounded man, then returned to remove the section\u2019s arms and ammunition.\n\nNaik Shahamad Khan, VC\n\n4. Lieutenant Arthur Martin-Leake\n\nLieutenant Arthur Martin-Leake, Royal Army Medical Corps, is one of three men to be a double recipient of the Victoria Cross. Martin-Leake first earned a VC in 1902 during the Second Boer War, for helping wounded men despite being shot three times.\n\nHe was awarded his second VC after his actions from 29 October to 8 November 1914 near Zonnebeke in Belgium. Despite being exposed to constant enemy fire, Martin-Leake rescued a large number of wounded men who were lying close to the enemy\u2019s trenches.\n\nDan interviews the brilliant historian Nick Lloyd, author of The Western Front who tells a much more nuanced account of the Western Front. Listen Now\n\n5. Lieutenant William Sanders\n\nLieutenant William Sanders, commander of the HMS Prize, was awarded the Victoria Cross for his valour on 30 April 1917. Near the Isles of Scilly, HMS Prize was attacked and badly hit by a German U-Boat.\n\nSanders sent off some of his wounded men in a small boat, and remained hidden with the rest of the crew on the ship. Thinking the HMS Prize to be abandoned, the U-Boat approached.\n\nWhen it drew near, Sanders ordered the ensign to be hoisted and the Prize opened fire. The U-Boat was seriously damage and fled, with its captain and two others abandoned in the water. Sanders rescued the three German prisoners and made for the Irish coast.\n\nHMS Prize engages the German U-Boat. (Image Credit: Charles Edward Dixon, National Maritime Museum / Public Domain).\n\n6. Private Albert Halton\n\nOn the opening day of the Battle of Passchendaele, Private Albert Halton of the King\u2019s Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster) displayed exceptional bravery. Seeing the men around him pinned down from heavy enemy machine gun and rifle fire, Halton ran forwards 300 yards through a hail of bullets.\n\nHalton captured a German machine gun nest and its crew single-handedly. He then went out into the field again and brought in 12 further prisoners. He survived the rest of the war and went on to live to 78.\n\nJournalist Donald Macintyre recalls the anti-Vietnam protests in London in 1968 and reflects on how they compare to protests today.

Previously, Bishop had won the Distinguished Service Order for shooting down two aircraft while being attacked by four others, and had even survived an engagement with the Red Baron.\n\nOn this solo mission, Bishop shot down three aircraft as they were taking off to attack him and destroyed several more on the ground. For this deed, he was awarded the Victoria Cross. For a time in 1917, Bishop was the RFC\u2019s top ace pilot, and later served as Director of the Royal Canadian Air Force during the Second World War.\n\nCaptain William Bishop, VC (Image Credit: CC \u2013 Flickr).\n\n8. Private John Caffrey\n\nOn 16 November 1915 Private John Caffrey spotted a badly-wounded soldier lying in no man\u2019s land, in full view of the enemy trenches.\n\nAided by a Medical Corporal, Caffrey tried to rescue him. Their first attempt failed when they were driven back by shrapnel fire, but they tried again and successfully reached the wounded soldier. As they lifted the wounded man, the Medical Corporal was shot.\n\nCaffrey bandaged up the Corporal and carried him back to the British lines. He then returned and brought the first wounded soldier to safety.\n\nPrivate John Caffrey in later life.\n\n9. Lieutenant Colonel William Barker\n\nOn 27 October 1918 Canadian fighter ace William Barker took on an armada of German biplanes in perhaps the most one-sided dogfight of World War One. Both Barker and his Sopwith Snipe were riddled with bullets, but Barker remained conscious and downed four aircraft, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.\n\nBarker became the most decorated Canadian in World War One. In addition to his VC he won the Distinguished Service Order and Bar, the Military Cross and two Bars, two Italian Silver Medals for Military Valour and the French Croix de Guerre. He died in 1930 and was granted a state funeral in Canada.\n\nWilliam Barker beside a Sopwith Camel.\n\n10. Lance Corporal William Coltman\n\nOn 3 October 1918 Lance Corporal William Coltman of the North Staffordshire Regiment earned a Victoria Cross for his \u2018bravery, initiative and devotion to duty\u2019.\n\nColtman heard that wounded men had been left behind during a retreat at Mannequin Hill. He went alone in the face of fierce enemy fire, and on three separate occasions carried casualties on his back to safety. He tended to the wounded unceasingly for 48 hours.\n\nColtman was also awarded both the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Military Medal twice, all for saving wounded men."}, {"url": "https://www.theroyalscots.co.uk/gallantry-awards-ww1-2/", "page_content": "GALLANTRY AWARDS WON BY ROYAL SCOTS IN WW1\n\nDuring the war six members of the Regiment were awarded the Victoria Cross, and one to Lance Corporal William Angus 8th Battalion The Highland Light Infantry, whilst attached to 8RS, all of them for actions in France. Their details, and the actions for which they were awarded the VC, are given below.\n\nIn addition to those awarded the VC, 32 Royal Scots were awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) of which three were awarded bars (a \u2018bar\u2019 is a second or further award of the same medal, but for different actions) and one, Lieutenant Colonel J A Fraser of the 5/6th Battalion, two bars; 217 the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM), including five with a bar; 158 the Military Cross (MC) including 13 with a bar and one, Captain J A Edwards of the 10th Battalion, two bars; and 337 the Military Medal of which 11, including Pte McIver VC, won bars.\n\n\n\nPrivate H.H. Robson, 2nd Battalion The Royal Scots\n\nPrivate Henry Robson, a native of South Shields, County Durham, was a Regular soldier who joined the 2nd Battalion in 1912 and moved with them to France on the outbreak of war. His citation records the detail of his action as:\n\n\u201cFor most conspicuous bravery near Kemmel on the 14 December 1914, during an attack on the German position, when he left his trench under a very heavy fire and rescued a wounded non-commissioned officer, and subsequently for making an attempt to bring another wounded man into cover, whilst exposed to severe fire. In this attempt he was at once wounded, but persevered in his efforts, until being rendered helpless by being shot for a second time.\u201d\n\nAfter recovering from his wounds Robson returned to the Battalion. He was again severely wounded, still with the 2nd Battalion, at Serres-en-Ancre on 13 November 1916. He recovered again but never returned to the Front and later served in the Labour Corps. After the war he went back to the Merchant Navy, in which he had served before enlisting. In 1923, after being signed off, he sold his Victoria Cross for \u00a380 to pay for his passage to Canada where he became a tram (streetcar) conductor. In 1934 he entered the civil service, working in the Parliament Buildings in Ontario. He rose to Sergeant at Arms of the Ontario Legislature and then information clerk showing visitors around the Parliament buildings. He died in Toronto, Canada in 1964, aged 69 and is buried in the Military Section of York Cemetery in Toronto.\n\nLance Corporal William Angus, 8th Battalion The Highland Light Infantry attached 8th Battalion The Royal Scots\n\nLance Corporal Angus\u2019s Citation reads:\n\n\u201cFor most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty at Givenchy on 12 June 1915, in voluntarily leaving his trench under heavy bomb and rifle fire, and rescuing a wounded officer who was lying within a few yards of the enemy\u2019s position.\u201d\n\nLance Corporal Angus, although born in Armadale, West Lothian, came from Carluke in Lanarkshire, and was a pre-war Territorial serving with 8th Battalion The Highland Light Infantry. An officer in the same Company, and also from Carluke, was Lieutenant Martin. The 8th Battalion, Highland Light Infantry was broken up in December 1914 and its Companies attached to other Lowland Territorial Battalions to bring them up to strength for overseas service. One company went to the 7th Battalion The Royal Scots and a second, Angus and Martin\u2019s, to the 8th Battalion.\n\nLieutenant Martin had been wounded in a night trench raid on 11-12 June and, despite searches, could not be found. As dawn broke he was seen lying, half buried under loose earth, immediately below the German parapet some 70 yards away. The whole company volunteered to rush the German trench at dusk to rescue the officer but it was realised that, lying without water under the boiling sun, the officer would probably be dead by then. The Commanding Officer agreed at midday that one man could attempt a rescue and Lance Corporal Angus was chosen from a number of volunteers. At 2pm he left his trench, under heavy covering fire, and reached Lieutenant Martin unobserved and got him out of the loose earth. Angus, it was reported, then propped Lieutenant Martin up against the German parapet and proceeded to give him a swig of brandy from a flask that he had carried with him! The Germans realised what was going on and let fly with \u201cbombs\u201d (hand grenades). Angus, supporting Martin, then dashed back to the Battalion\u2019s trenches but was wounded no less than 40 times en route. Amazingly he made it, with Lieutenant Martin, to safety. Lance Corporal Angus, who had been warned when he volunteered to carry out the rescue that \u201cits certain death, lad\u201d was awarded the Victoria Cross, the first Scottish Territorial to win the award. Both Lance Corporal Angus and Lieutenant Martin survived the War with the former dying in Carluke, where a road is named after him, in June 1959, aged 71\n\nPrivate R Dunsire 13th Battalion The Royal Scots\n\nPrivate Robert Dunsire was born at Buckhaven, Fife in 1891. The family moved to Kirkcaldy where he became a miner. He enlisted in January 1915 and, after training, was posted to the 13th Battalion.\n\nHe was awarded his Victoria Cross\n\n\u201cFor most conspicuous bravery on Hill 70 on 26th September 1915. Private Dunsire went out under very heavy fire and rescued a wounded man from between the firing-lines. Later, when another man considerably nearer the German lines was heard shouting for help, he crawled out again with utter disregard to the enemy\u2019s fire, and carried him in also. Shortly afterwards the Germans attacked over this ground.\u201d\n\nPrivate Dunsire emerged unscathed from both these rescues but, by then a Corporal, was mortally wounded in a trench mortar attack whilst in the trenches at Hulluch in the Loos sector on 31 January 1916. He is buried at Mazingarbe Communal Cemetery in France.\n\nCaptain H Reynolds, MC, 12th Battalion The Royal Scots\n\nCaptain Henry Reynolds was born in Northamptonshire. There is some confusion over the actual year, and dates vary from 1879 to 1882. He was, however, already approaching his mid-thirties, and married when he joined the Northamptonshire Yeomanry in October 1914. Commissioned into the 14th (Reserve) Battalion The Royal Scots in July 1915, he was posted to France in August 1916. Promoted Lieutenant in May 1917, and to Captain in July, he was awarded the Military Cross \u201cfor a series of actions on 12 April 1917, which meant being under artillery, machine gun and rifle fire for a considerable time\u201d. His award of the Victoria Cross was gazetted on 8 November 1917 and read:\n\n\u201cHenry Reynolds MC, Temporary Captain, 12th Battn Royal Scots. For most conspicuous bravery when his company, in attack and approaching their final objective, suffered heavy casualties from enemy machine guns and from an enemy \u2018pill-box\u2019 which had been passed by the first wave. Capt Reynolds reorganised his men who were scattered, and then proceeded alone by rushes from shell-hole to shell-hole, all the time being under heavy machine-gun fire. When near the \u2018pill-box\u2019 he threw a grenade, intending that it should go inside but they enemy had blocked the entrance. He then crawled to the entrance and forced a phosphorous grenade inside. This set the place on fire and caused the death of three of the enemy, while the remainder, seven or eight, surrendered with two machine guns. Afterwards, though wounded, he continued to lead his company against another objective, and captured it, taking seventy prisoners and two more machine guns. During the whole attack the company was under heavy machine-gun fire from the flanks, but, despite this, Capt Reynolds kept complete control of his men.\u201d\n\nCaptain Reynolds was later recommended for a Regular Commission by his Commanding Officer as follows:\n\n\u201cCapt H Reynolds served under my command in France during the greater part of 1917.\n\nHe is one of the most capable and conscientious officers that I have ever had under my command; he is attentive to every detail in connection with his company; has a sound knowledge of training and interior economy, and his company was always clean, smart, well turned-out, thoroughly trained and efficient, and always willing and ready to take part in any action.\n\nCapt Reynolds is a physically powerful man, capable of standing any amount of strain, and his unusual sense of duty was so pronounced that in action he was invaluable.\n\nHe was awarded the Victoria Cross for a series of actions on 20 Sept 1917, at Zonnenbeke, every one of which meant facing a terrible fire for a considerable period, and the Military Cross for a similar series on 12 April 1917.\n\nI can confidently recommend him for a commission in the Regular Army, and suggest that a special preference be given to him, so that his commission may be dated back as early as possible.\n\n(Signed) \u201cJ A S Ritson\n\nLieut-Colonel\n\n12th Battn The Royal Scots\n\n7 March 1919\u201d\n\nHe transferred to the 2nd Bn The Loyal Regiment in 1920 and retired from the Army in 1927. In 1930, he became Superintendant and Steward at the Sir Frederick Milner Home, Beckenham, Kent. He remained there until his death at Carshalton, Surrey in March 1948 And is buried at St Giles\u2019s Churchyard, Ashtead, Surrey. His son Lieutenant Thomas Reynolds, also served in the Regiment but was killed in a traffic accident at Quetta, in India, in 1931 while with the 2nd Battalion.\n\nPrivate H McIver, MM and Bar, 2nd Battalion The Royal Scots\n\nPrivate Hugh McIver was born at Linwood in Renfrewshire on 21 June 1890. He worked as a miner before joining the Army on 18 August 1914. He was posted to the 2nd Battalion in France on 11 May 1915. He won the Military Medal on the Somme for actions on 14 July 1916 and a bar to it, for daring and initiative during daylight patrols in enemy lines, on 1 July 1918. The citation for his Victoria Cross recorded:\n\n\u201cHugh McIver, No 12311, Private, late 2nd Battn The Royal Scots. For most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty when employed as a company-runner east of Courcelles-le-Comte on 23 August 1918. In spite of heavy artillery and machine-gun fire, he carried messages regardless of his own safety. Single-handed, he pursued an enemy scout into a machine-gun post, and having killed six of the garrison, captured twenty prisoners with two machine guns. This gallant action enabled the company to advance unchecked. Later, he succeeded at great personal risk in stopping the fire of a British tank which was directed in error against our own troops at close range. By this very gallant action Private McIver undoubtedly saved many lives.\u201d\n\nMcIver was killed in action 10 days later on 2 September. His Company Commander wrote to his mother a few days later:\n\n\u201c2nd Battn The Royal Scots,\n\n8 Sep 1918\n\nMy Dear Mrs McIver\n\nI am writing these few lines to you to try and express, both on my own behalf and also for the men of my company, our greatest sympathy for you in the loss of your son Hugh in the recent fighting.\n\nIt came as a great blow to me, as he was my personal orderly, and he was quite close to me when he was killed. We were going up a hill, attacking some machine guns, when he was killed by a bullet, and it may soften your blow a little to know he never felt it.\n\nIt is only about ten days since I recommended him for the Victoria Cross, and it is quite likely that it will be awarded to you, and if ever a man deserved the VC, Hugh did, as he was one of the best and bravest boys in the battalion; in fact, the bravest I have ever known.\n\nI am sending on to you his Military Medal and rose, which I cut off his breast for you. His other personal effects will follow later.\n\nI can only say, Mrs McIver, that your son died a hero\u2019s death, and he has left a record in the battalion second to none. Again expressing my deepest sympathy to you and yours,\n\nI am\n\nYours very sincerely\n\n(Signed) ALICK GORDON, Capt\n\nOfficer Commanding, C Company\n\n2nd Battn The Royal Scots\u201d\n\nHis parents received his Victoria Cross from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 13 February 1919. McIver is buried at Vraucourt Copse British Military Cemetery, North East of Bapaume.\n\nCorporal R E Elcock, MM, 11th Battalion The Royal Scots\n\nCorporal Roland Elcock was born at Wolverhampton on 5 June 1899. He enlisted underage in the South Staffordshire Regiment and was posted to France on 28 June 1915 just after his sixteenth birthday. When it was discovered that he was underage he was sent home and discharged. He was employed with Wolverhampton Corporation Electricity Works and re-enlisted, into The Royal Scots, on his eighteenth birthday in June 1917. Before he was 19 he had won the Military Medal and been promoted to Corporal. The citation for the action in which he won the Victoria Cross read as follows:\n\n\u201cFor most conspicuous bravery and initiative, south-east of Cappelle St Catherine on 15th October 1918, when in charge of a Lewis gun team. Entirely on his own initiative, Corporal Elcock rushed his gun up to within ten yards of enemy guns, which were causing heavy casualties and holding up the advance. He put both guns out of action, captured five prisoners and undoubtedly saved the whole attack from being held up. Later, near the River Lys, this NCO again attacked an enemy machine-gun and captured the crew. His behaviour throughout the day was absolutely fearless.\u201d\n\nHis Victoria Cross was presented, along with Pte McIver\u2019s, at Buckingham Palace on 13 February 1919. After the war he was re-employed by Wolverhampton Corporation Electricity Department. He later went to India in the Posts and Telegraph Service working in Upper Burma as divisional engineer and then, on promotion, to be Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs on the North-West Frontier. He joined the Indian Army on the outbreak of the Second World War in the rank of Major but, as he was about to be posted overseas, he became ill. He never recovered and died at Dehra Dun, where he is buried, on 6 October 1944. His grandson, Private Christopher Owens, served with the 1st Battalion in the Gulf War in 1991.\n\nLieutenant D S McGregor, 6th Battalion The Royal Scots, attached Machine Gun Corps\n\nLieutenant David McGregor was born in Edinburgh on 16 October 1895. Educated at George Watson\u2019s and George Heriot\u2019s he was an apprentice of the Commercial Bank of Scotland and had joined the Midlothian Royal Field Artillery (Territorial Force) in 1913. When war broke out he volunteered for overseas service and was commissioned into the 6th Battalion in 1915. He was posted to Egypt in May 1916 from where he was immediately transferred to France with the Battalion. He served on the Somme during the summer of 1916 before volunteering for machine-gun work. After training he was posted to the 29th Battalion of the Machine Gun Corps with whom he was serving when he won his posthumous Victoria Cross. His citation records:\n\n\u201cDavid Stuart McGregor, Lieut, late 6th Battn Royal Scots (Territorial Force) and 29th Battn Machine Gun Corps. For the most conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty near Hoogmolen on 22 Oct 1918, when in command of a section of machine guns attached to the right flank platoon of the assaulting battalion. In the assembly position he concealed his guns on a limber under the bank of a sunken road. Immediately the troops advanced at zero they were subjected to intense enfilade machine-gun fire from Hill 66 on the right flank. Lieut McGregor fearlessly went forward into the open to locate the enemy guns, and having done so, realised that it was impossible to get his guns carried forward either by pack or by hand without great delay, as the ground was absolutely bare and swept by a hail of bullets. Ordering the team to follow by a more covered route, he went to the limber, got on to it, and, lying flat, told the driver to leave cover and gallop forward. This the driver did, galloping down about six hundred yards of absolutely open road under the heaviest machine-gun fire into cover beyond. The driver, horses and limber were all hit, but Lieut McGregor succeeded in getting the guns into action, effectively engaging the enemy, subduing their fire and enabling the advance to be resumed. With the utmost gallantry he continued to expose himself in order to direct and control the fire of his guns, until, about an hour later, this very gallant officer was killed whilst observing fire effect for the Trench Mortar Battery. His great gallantry and supreme devotion to duty were the admiration of all ranks, and especially the officers and men of the 1st Border Regt, who witnessed this extraordinary action.\u201d\n\nLieutenant McGregor is buried in Staceghem Communal Cemetery, Harlebeke, Belgium. His parents received his Victoria Cross from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 15 February 1919."}, {"url": "https://www.warmuseum.ca/media/famous-trio-of-victoria-cross-medals-unveiled-at-the-canadian-war-museum/", "page_content": "Famous trio of Victoria Cross medals unveiled at the Canadian War Museum\n\nOttawa, Ontario, November 5, 2012\u2014 An extraordinary collection of all three Victoria Cross Medals awarded during the First World War to residents of Winnipeg\u2019s Pine Street, later renamed Valour Road, was unveiled today at the Canadian War Museum.\n\nThis collection was completed with the recent acquisition of the medal awarded in 1915 to Company Sergeant Major Frederick William Hall. The War Museum acquired the Valour Road Victoria Crosses of Lieutenant Robert Shankland and Corporal Lionel B. Clarke in 2009 and 2010 respectively.\n\nOnly 96 Victoria Crosses were awarded to Canadians in the medal\u2019s 156-year history, making this coincidence truly exceptional. With the acquisition of the Hall Victoria Cross, the Canadian War Museum now has 33 Victoria Crosses in its collection, including one from the nineteenth century, 28 from the First World War and four from the Second World War.\n\n\u201cValour Road is remarkable for its association with three recipients of this renowned award for bravery. The three men were honoured for their heroic acts in different battles and in different years, but all were from a single block of the same residential street,\u201d said Mark O\u2019Neill, President and CEO of the Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation, which operates the Canadian War Museum. \u201cThese medals belong together and so they shall remain in perpetuity, held in the name of all Canadians.\u201d\n\nThe trio of medals will remain on permanent display in the Royal Canadian Legion Hall of Honour. In 2014, this famous trio of Victoria Cross Medals will be loaned to the Manitoba Museum in Winnipeg for a special exhibition commemorating the role of the Winnipeg Rifles and Queen\u2019s Own Cameron Highlanders regiments during the First World War.\n\n\u201cOur Government is very proud to see this extraordinary story displayed in the War Museum\u2019s collection and shared with other museums and institutions across the country,\u201d said Minister Moore. \u201cOn the road to Canada\u2019s 150th birthday in 2017, let us continue to celebrate all of the things that make Canada the united, prosperous, and free country we are today.\u201d\n\nThe Victoria Cross was introduced during the reign of Queen Victoria and remains the highest award for military valour in Britain and much of the Commonwealth including Canada, which created its own version of the Victoria Cross in 1993. The Victoria Cross is awarded \u201cfor the most conspicuous bravery, a daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice or extreme devotion to duty, in the presence of the enemy.\u201d\n\nCompany Sergeant Major Frederick William Hall received the medal for his actions during the 2nd Battle of Ypres, infamous as the site of the first German gas attack on the western front. Hall was shot in the forehead and killed during a prolonged and valiant attempt to rescue a wounded comrade. The posthumous award was presented to his mother. Corporal Clarke received his medal for valour in the face of the enemy at the Somme Front on September 9, 1916, while Lieutenant Shankland received his Victoria Cross for actions during the Battle of Passchendaele in October 1917.\n\nThe Canadian War Museum is Canada\u2019s national museum of military history. Its mission is to promote public understanding of Canada\u2019s military history in its personal, national, and international dimensions.\n\n-30-\n\nBACKGROUNDER:\n\nThe Victoria Cross and the Heroes of Valour Road\n\nThe Victoria Cross was instituted on February 5, 1856 with the first awards given to heroes of the Crimean War (1854\u20131856). It is the British Commonwealth\u2019s highest award for military bravery.\n\nSince its inception, the Victoria Cross has been awarded to 96 Canadians (Canadian born or serving in the Canadian Army). Ten of the awards were for actions during the late nineteenth century and the South African War (1899\u20131902), 70 for actions during the First World War (1914\u20131918) and 16 for actions during the Second World War (1939\u20131945). No Victoria Crosses have been awarded to Canadians in the post-war era.\n\nThe issue of the Victoria Cross to Canadians was discontinued when Canada instituted its own awards for bravery and gallantry during the late 1960s and early 1970s. However, a uniquely Canadian version of the Victoria Cross was introduced in 1993, again becoming Canada\u2019s highest award for bravery in the face of the enemy. It is identical to the earlier British award except the words For Valour are replaced by the Latin Pro Valore. The Canadian Victoria Cross has yet to be awarded.\n\nThe Heroes of Valour Road\n\nOf the 70 Victoria Crosses awarded to Canadians during the First World War, three went to residents of a single block of one residential street: the 700 block of Pine Street in Winnipeg. In recognition of their gallantry, the city changed the name of the street to Valour Road in 1925.\n\nThe men were different ages, served in different military units, and were recognized for heroism in different battles. The nature of their pre-war connections\u2014if any\u2014are unknown. But the coincidence of having so many Victoria Crosses associated with a single street is unique in the world.\n\nFrederick William Hall\n\nHall was born in Kilkenny, Ireland, in 1885. A veteran of the British Army, he immigrated to Canada with other members of his family a few years before the outbreak of the First World War. He worked as a shipping clerk in Winnipeg and then enlisted in the 8th Canadian Infantry Battalion in September 1914.\n\nSeven months later, the Battalion was at the western front helping to defend the Ypres Salient, a bulge pushing into the German lines around the city of Ypres, Belgium. The Salient guarded an important communication crossroads and access to the channel ports of Calais and Dunkirk.\n\nOn April 22, 1915, the Battalion was among the Allied defenders enveloped by the first use of poison gas on the western front. The Germans attacked again the next night with artillery and another release of chlorine gas. Hall\u2019s company was ordered to leave its trench and move to another, exposing the men to enemy fire as they crossed a raised bank. After arriving at the new location, Company Sergeant Major Hall determined that two of the men under his command were missing. He left the trench, found both wounded men in the darkness, and brought them back to safety.\n\nThe next morning, on April 24, he heard the groans and cries of another wounded man and organized a rescue party with two volunteers from his company. Both volunteers were wounded in the attempt, and Hall pulled them back to safety. He then decided to try again on his own. With bullets hitting the ground around him, he made his way to the wounded soldier. As he was attempting to lift the man, Hall was hit in the forehead by an enemy bullet and killed. The soldier he was attempting to save was also shot to death.\n\nFor his heroic deeds, Hall was recommended for the Victoria Cross. The medal was presented to his mother, Mrs. Mary Ann Hall, who was then living in Winnipeg with Fredrick\u2019s two sisters.\n\nLionel B. (\u201cLeo\u201d) Clarke\n\nClarke was born in Waterdown, Ontario, in 1892, but his family eventually settled in Winnipeg. He was a railroad surveyor in Saskatchewan when the First World War began, and he returned to Winnipeg to enlist in the 27th Battalion. He later transferred to the 2nd Battalion, 1st Canadian Division to be with his brother Charles.\n\nLeo Clarke volunteered for a bombing platoon, whose members were trained in the use and tactics of hand-grenades. Working with bayonet men, their task was to clear enemy trenches in close quarter combat. On September 9, 1916, Corporal Clarke and his platoon were at the Somme Front. Their objective was to clear a section of enemy trench, then build an earth and sandbag barrier to prevent a counterattack. Clarke led a small group of men down a section of the trenchline while the other Canadians began building the barrier. The fighting was so fierce for Clarke\u2019s group that all of his comrades were soon dead or injured. About 20 German soldiers, led by two officers, began a counterattack. Clarke built and defended his own hasty barrier. When the fighting stopped, Clarke had been bayoneted in the leg, but had killed or captured all of his attackers.\n\nFor that valour in the face of the enemy, Clarke earned the Victoria Cross. Sadly, he did not live to receive the decoration. Almost two months after his remarkable display of heroism, he was killed by enemy shellfire. The medal was presented posthumously to his father during a ceremony in Winnipeg.\n\nRobert Shankland\n\nBorn in Ayr, Scotland, in 1887, Robert Shankland moved to Canada in 1910 and found work as a cashier at a Winnipeg creamery. He enlisted in the 43rd Canadian Infantry Battalion (Cameron Highlanders of Canada) in December 1914.\n\nShankland received the Victoria Cross for his actions during the Battle of Passchendaele in October 1917. At the time, he was a Lieutenant in the 43rd Battalion. On the morning of October 26, the opening day of the battle, Shankland led his platoon of men from D Company to the crest of a hill overlooking the enemy trenches at Bellevue Spur. To his right were elements of the 58th Battalion and to his left were troops from the 8th Brigade.\n\nWhen the Canadians moved forward, B Company of the 43rd Battalion captured Bellevue Spur, but heavy enemy fire caused the 58th to retire, leaving Shankland and his platoon from D Company exposed on the right flank. Eventually, the left flank retired, further exposing Shankland\u2019s troops. They were subjected to enemy fire and a counter-attack, suffering heavy casualties for four hours. Recognizing the desperate need for reinforcements, Shankland made the perilous journey back to Battalion headquarters where he provided a detailed report of the situation and a plan to counter-attack. He then returned to his men, who were soon successfully reinforced by soldiers from the 52nd and 58th battalions. For his actions that day Robert Shankland was awarded the Victoria Cross for his leadership and courage.\n\nShankland was the only one of the three Valour Road Victoria Cross recipients to survive the war.\n\n[ end ]\n\nInformation (media):"}, {"url": "https://homeofheroes.com/heroes-stories/vietnam-war/william-pitsenbarger/", "page_content": "During the Vietnam War, the United States Air Force awarded its second-highest award, the Air Force Cross, to nineteen enlisted airmen. Of those nineteen awards, ten were awarded to Pararescuemen.... better known as PJs.\n\nThe Pentagon is a mighty big place, an American institution filled with legends, lore, and high-ranking military men and women. For Mr. and Mrs. William Pitsenbarger, the September 22, 1966 visit to the home of America's military men and women had all the elements of culture shock. It was like walking into a whole new world, a world separated from their small hometown of Piqua, Ohio by more than miles. Calming their uneasiness and fighting to overcome the emotions that struggled for release, the brave couple found themselves being introduced to the US Air Force Chief of Staff, General John P. McConnell. Standing to the side to witness the events that were about to unfold was Ohio Senator Frank Lausche. Later that same afternoon the Senator would write in the Congressional Record,\n\n\"They (Mr. and Mrs. Pitsenbarger) stood there heroically, in my opinion reflecting the courageous and stalwart character of their son.\"\n\nTheir son...that's what this was all about. As the couple waited for the ceremony to begin, perhaps they could not avoid remembering young William Pitsenbarger's zest for life...a zeal that had always driven him to experience every adventure and push the envelope to the limits. Irene Pitsenbarger may have thought briefly about the many times her young son had given her reason for fright. Even as a lad he had flirted with danger, taking his childhood games like \"follow the leader\" to the ledges of the highest buildings or the limbs of the tallest trees. In his junior year of high school in his small town of 20,000, young William Pitsenbarger had tried to enlist in the Army's Special Forces to wear the coveted Green Beret. Adamantly Irene and her husband had refused to give their 17-year old permission to join the Army, requiring him to remain in school one more year to graduate.\n\nIn the Spring of 1962, William Pitsenbarger graduated from high school. He continued to work as a stock boy at the local Kroger supermarket, all the while thirsting for more adventure. While there, it was the Air Force recruiter who captured the young man's attention. On the last afternoon of the year, New Year's Eve 1962, William Pitsenbarger broke the news to his parents. He had enlisted in the Air Force and would soon be boarding a train for San Antonio to begin his training. How soon? He was leaving that very night.\n\nIn the quiet dignity of the halls of the Pentagon, the senior Pitsenbarger remembered how proud he had been of his son. Not only had he chosen to serve his country in uniform, but he had also chosen to serve among some of the most elite. After Air Force basic training, the young airman had continued to push the envelope and expand his thirst for adventure.\n\nHe trained with members of the Army at Fort Benning, Georgia to earn his jump wings. He attended the Navy's underwater swimmers\u2019 school. He successfully completed the rescue and survival medical course. At Stead AFB, Nevada, he completed the combat survival course, at Elgin AFB in Florida he attended the Tropical Survival School, and at Albrook AFB, C.Z. he attended the fire-fighters course for the HH-43 helicopter. Through it all, he emerged as one of the Air Force's elite Pararescuemen, more commonly known as PJs.\n\nPJs were born out of the efforts of Lieutenant Colonel Don Fleckinger and two medical corpsmen who parachuted into remote jungles near the China-Burma border in August 1943 to rescue survivors from a disabled C-46. For nearly a month the officer and his two medics had treated the injured while leading them to rescue. Among those restored to safety was Eric Severeid, who would go on to become a well-known news commentator. He described the forerunners of the Pararescue program as \"Gallant\".\n\nGallant, they were true. They were also dedicated to saving lives, not only during times of war but also in peace. The PJ motto is \"That Others May Live\", and the unspoken preface to their motto was that the men of this highly trained rescue force would do anything...including risking their lives to the highest degree...\n\n\"These things we do, so that others may live\"\n\nYes, the elder Pitsenbarger was justly proud of his son. Young William had come home after his extensive training a grown man, confident that he could accomplish any task and fulfill any demands his job might require. His role had taken him to Perth, Australia as a Pararescue-medic in the earliest days of the space program, working on the Gemini and Mercury space probe recoveries.\n\nThen had come the looming threats of conflict in Vietnam. When Airman Pitsenbarger got orders for service in the war zone in August 1965 he had only a little more than a year remaining in his 4-year Air Force enlistment. For the first time, the senior Pitsenbarger began to worry about the risks inherent in his son's military specialty. Father and son agreed not to tell Irene the full story. It would be best if she did not know that her only son would be performing some of the most dangerous missions faced by any young man in a combat zone.\n\nVietnam\n\nAirman Pitsenbarger arrived in Vietnam on August 8th and was assigned to Detachment 6, 38th Air Rescue and Recovery Squadron at Bien Hoa Air Base. His unit was responsible for many different kinds of rescue missions, from recovering downed pilots to evacuating wounded airmen or soldiers for both the US military units as well as South Vietnamese units. Detachment 6 consisted of five aircrews that flew three HH-43F Kaman Huskie helicopters. The Air Force rescue craft with their twin rotors was not as trim in appearance as the \"Dustoffs\" used by the Army for evacuating their own wounded. But the Huskies had a unique advantage. The \"Dustoffs\" could only retrieve wounded soldiers by landing on the ground...a limitation all too common in the Southeast Asian war zone famous for dense, triple-canopy jungles. The Air Force Huskies could hover over the last layers of the jungle foliage and winch a wire-mesh Stokes Litter to those on the ground. When a wounded man had been properly strapped inside the litter, he could then be winched up into the Huskie where Pararescue medics like William Pitsenbarger waited to administer lifesaving first aid during the flight to a field hospital.\n\nOver the months that followed William Pitsenbarger did his best to downplay the dangers of his job in his letters home. In fact, the letters and pictures he sent back seemed to indicate that Airman Pitsenbarger was actually having a good time at the Air Base a short distance from the South Vietnamese capital city of Saigon. Pits, as the Airman from Piqua, Ohio came to be called, was a happy and likable young man. The other men in his Detachment enjoyed being around Pits. He never complained and had a great sense of humor and tendency to clown around when things were quiet.\n\nAt the same time, when things were not quiet, Pits was great to have around, especially if you were a downed airman alone in enemy-controlled jungle or a wounded soldier in the field. \"All of us PJs had a strong desire to save lives,\" said Chief Master Sergeant Dave Milsten, the ranking Pararescueman in Detachment 6, \"that's what we lived for. But Bill (Pitsenbarger) had a triple dose of that.\"\n\nIn the 275 days from August 8, 1965 to April 11, 1966, Airman First Class William Pitsenbarger flew more than 300 rescue missions over the jungles of Vietnam. Time and again he has faced enemy fire, stared death in the face and calmly set himself to the tasks of a Pararescue medic. Hundreds of men owed their lives to a young medic called Pits...and not only for his lifesaving first aid in the airborne trip from the jungle to a field hospital. Time and again, as was not uncommon among any of the dedicated PJs, Pits had made the ascent from the relative shelter of his hovering Huskie to the jungle floor to render immediate first aid to wounded and then strap them into the lowered Stokes Litter.\n\nOn March 7th Pits' aircrew flew on a mission to rescue a wounded South Vietnamese soldier who had walked into an old minefield while fighting a fire. The man had lost his foot when he stepped on a mine and was trapped inside a maze of old and unstable explosive devices. As Pits' Huskie began the approach, a plan for extracting the wounded man without detonating other mines in the field had to be devised. Pits' solution? \"Lower me down on the penetrator (a rudimentary seat lowered by cable from a hovering helicopter) and I'll straddle the guy. Pick him up, and then you can lift me up.\" Heedless of the potential for disaster should the heavy prop wash of the Huskie's twin-blades detonate other mines in the field, Airman Pitsenbarger made the ascent, snatched the wounded soldier, and restored him to safety.\n\nFor that selfless act of heroism, Pits was awarded the highly regarded Airman's Medal by the United States Air Force. The government of South Vietnam awarded him Vietnam's Medal of Military Merit and the Gallantry Cross with Bronze Palm. Time and again these brave medics had been inserted to save lives. But the choice to \"go in\" was always a voluntary call, made the PJs themselves. When the mission called for such acts of personal courage, there was never a shortage of volunteers.\n\nThe Air Force Cross\n\nIrene Pitsenbarger did her best to push the memories momentarily aside and stand stoically next to her husband. The elder Pitsenbarger struggled with his own emotions, unable any longer to restrain the tears. In addition to the Airman's Medal and the Vietnamese awards, their son had received the Purple Heart and six Air Medals with four more pending. And now, here at the Pentagon, Mr. and Mrs. Pitsenbarger would receive one more award on behalf of their son. Slowly, the citation was read:\n\n\"A1c William H. Pitsenbarger distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an opposing armed force near Cam My, the Republic of Vietnam on 11 April 1966. On that date, Airman Pitsenbarger was a rescue and survival specialist aboard a helicopter engaged in the evacuating of American casualties in a dense jungle. With complete disregard for his personal safety, Airman Pitsenbarger voluntarily rode a rescue hoist more than one-hundred feet to the ground and organized and coordinated rescue efforts at the scene. During the rescue operation, he cared for and prepared the casualties for evacuation, and insured that the recovery operation continued in a smooth and orderly fashion. Following the recovery of the ninth casualty, the rescue aircraft hovering overhead was damaged and disabled by automatic weapon fire. The helicopter was forced to abandon recovery efforts to make an emergency landing at a nearby airstrip. Airman Pitsenbarger volunteered to remain on the ground and administer medical treatment to the wounded. Shortly after rescue efforts were interrupted, the area came under heavy sniper and mortar fire. Airman Pitsenbarger repeatedly exposed himself to intensive automatic fire while gathering rifles and ammunition from fallen comrades which he passed among the defenders. His bravery and determination int he faces of overwhelming odds are in keeping with the highest standards of performance and traditions of the American fighting man under attack.\"\n\nWilliam and Irene Pitsenbarger looked with reverence at the medal presented to them by General McConnell on behalf of their son. It was the Air Force Cross, our Nation's second-highest award for military valor by a member of the United States Air Force. Their only son, Pararescue-medic William Pits Pitsenbarger had just made history...becoming the first enlisted Airman in history to receive the Air Force Cross...posthumously.\n\n\"The mother was brave. The father shed tears. But both were proud.\" Wrote Senator Lausche in his Congressional Record account of that day. \"At the conclusion of the award, I felt that I was spiritually cleansed and fortified for a better rendition of service in the responsibility which I have for my government.\"\n\nIn the years that followed the 1966 presentation of the Air Force Cross to Mr. and Mrs. Pitsenbarger just five months after the death of their son, the name William Pits Pitsenbarger became synonymous with the proud traditions of sacrifice and service of the Air Force Pararescuemen. Air Force buildings were named for him, and the Air Force Sergeants Association introduced an annual award for valor in honor of the heroic actions reflected in his award citation. In time, Pits became an Air Force legend... not so much for what his citation said about his actions that day in April 1966, but for the details, it did not include!\n\nOperation \"Abilene\" and the PJ's (April 10-12, 1966)\n\nBINH GIA, Vietnam (AP)\n\n\"It was horrible,\" said Pfc Ronald Haley, as he stood in the tiny clearing blasted from the jungle so that the dead and wounded could be evacuated. \"I've never heard such screaming in my life. Many of the wounded were yelling for their mothers. Some of the kids were calling for God.\" said Haley, one of the few survivors.\n\nHaley, of Ukiah, Calif., was dirty and unkept after his unit had been in the jungles 30 miles east of Saigon for two weeks searching for the Viet Cong. The U.S. 1st Division Infantrymen found them Monday afternoon and in the bitter fight perhaps a third or more of their company were killed or wounded.\n\nThe company commander, Capt. William Nolen of Florence, S.C. described how the battle involving his \"Big Red One\" troops developed. He was wounded twice.\n\nThe company, part of the 2nd Battalion, 16th Regiment was moving through the jungle\u2019s northeast of Binh Gia on a routine-patrol. At noon sniper fire began. \"After a while,\" Nolen said, \"heavy fire started coming in. We moved into a perimeter. In this first part of the fight that lasted from 45 minutes to an hour, we took quite a few casualties. The Viet Cong withdrew and we called in artillery fire. An Air Force rescue helicopter came over and lowered a ladder. They hauled out about a dozen of our wounded. Suddenly we started receiving fire from all around. There were mortars coming in, heavy machinegun fire. We were completely surrounded.\"\n\nThe Viet Cong were everywhere. An estimated battalion of the enemy from the main force regiment was involved. First Lt. Kenneth Anderson, of Nashville, Tenn. said snipers kept firing from the trees. \"One of my boys picked up a grenade and charged one of the trees. He was killed. I saw another lieutenant running from tree to tree looking for Viet Cong positions. He was hit seven times before he was finally killed,\" he said.\n\nAt times, the Americans fought the enemy hand to hand.\n\none moves westward towards Saigon. Here the jungle grows in layers, often triple-canopy (3-layers) of heavy vegetation. So thick is the top layer, often rising over 150 feet upwards, that sunlight never reaches the vegetation at ground level. During the brightest day, soldiers moving across the jungle floor can almost feel that they are moving about at night.\n\nOperation Abilene began on April 10, 1966...Easter Sunday. Soldiers of the 1st Infantry Division, better known as \"The Big Red One\", began to move into the jungle between Saigon and Vung Tau in search of the enemy. Alpha, Bravo and Charlie Companies of the First Infantry's 2nd Battalion, 16th Infantry (2/16th) were seeking elements of a 400-man Viet Cong battalion. On Monday, the second day of the sweep, the rugged terrain forced Charlie Company to move outward instead of parallel to Alpha and Bravo Companies. Sporadic sniper fire picked at the men of Charlie, 2/16th throughout the day, but no one could have predicted how intense the enemy fire would become as morning gave way to afternoon.\n\nStaff Sergeant James Robinson, a former Marine, had volunteered for Vietnam duty...had, in fact, engaged in a determined year-long letter-writing campaign from his duty station in Panama in efforts to be assigned as an advisor to soldiers of the Vietnamese Army. Sergeant Robinson believed strongly in the U.S. role in Vietnam, telling his father in one letter: \"There's a world on fire and we should do something about it.\" Now, as he led his fire-team through the dense jungles of Phuoc Tuy province, he recalled what he had written home in his most recent letter...\"The price we pay for freedom is never cheap.\" Little did he know how expensive that price was about to become.\n\nThe first explosion came from American artillery fired in support of Operation Abilene. One round fell short, detonating in the top of the jungle canopy and raining deadly shrapnel on Sergeant Robinson's platoon. Two men were killed, twelve wounded, and the tall sergeant from Cicero, Illinois set his men to the task of clearing a landing zone for medevac choppers to extract the casualties. As the survivors hacked through the jungle vegetation, they did not realize they were only yards from their primary objective...the command post of the Viet Cong Battalion Operation Abilene sought to find and destroy.\n\nAs the infantrymen fought to reclaim enough jungle landscape for the medevacs to land, the enemy attacked with mortars and machinegun fire. Pandemonium erupted among the American soldiers as they clamored for any semblance of shelter. In the midst of sudden death and unrestrained terror, Sergeant Robinson began moving among the men to organize defensive fire and inspire confidence. Locating one highly effective enemy sniper, Robinson used a grenade launcher to end the threat. In the distance, he could see an Army medic kneeling to bandage the wounds of a wounded American infantryman. The enemy fire reached out to tear flesh and the medic fell to the ground. Realizing the two wounded men were dangerously exposed to continued enemy fire, Robinson ignored the whine of deadly missiles around him to rush into the open and drag the two wounded men to safety.\n\nAs the fighting continued to escalate, more wounded fell. Sergeant Robinson noticed another American fall ahead of his position. Rushing forward to rescue the wounded man, enemy rounds slammed into Robinson's shoulder and leg. Ignoring the pain, he dragged the wounded man to shelter, administered lifesaving first aid, and then treated his own serious wounds. While patching up his broken body he noticed the location of an enemy machinegun that had been inflicting heavy casualties on his unit. His rifle empty, Sergeant Robinson again ignored his wounds to attack.\n\nAnother Viet Cong bullet hit the intrepid soldier in the leg. The round was a tracer, igniting the trousers of his jungle fatigues. Sergeant Robinson ripped the burning uniform from his body and continued forward. At six feet, three inches tall he was an inspiring sight for the beleaguered men of his platoon. He was also a very large target. The full force of the aggressors turned their firepower on the advancing American.\n\nTwo more rounds struck flesh, ripping into Sergeant Robinson's chest and draining what little strength remained in his broken body. Somehow, through sheer force of determination, he continued forward...falling only after reaching an effective range and throwing the two grenades to destroy the enemy position. The price Sergeant Robinson paid for freedom wasn't cheap...he purchased it with his own life.\n\nAbilene and the Pits\n\nThe worst was yet to come for Charlie Company. Normally the unit consisted of 291 men but, going into Operation Abilene, company strength was down to 134 soldiers. These men were now cut off from Able and Bravo companies and were surrounded by 400 or more enemy soldiers. Hidden by the dense jungle, the enemy was able to hide and still place effective sniper fire on the Americans. Quickly the attack escalated to intense mortar and machinegun fire throughout the entire area. Dead and wounded American boys littered the undergrowth in what was quickly becoming a massacre. Because of the thick, triple-canopy jungle, Army medevacs could not come in to retrieve the wounded...there was simply no place to land. The nearest clearing was 4 miles away. The only hope of getting the wounded out and headed for emergency field hospitals lay with the Air Force Huskies that were capable of hovering above the canopy to lower an empty stokes litter, then winch it back up with the body of a wounded strapped inside.\n\nAt 3 o'clock on the afternoon of April 11th, the call for help arrived at the headquarters of the 38th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron at Bien Hoa. Two Air Force Huskies were quickly airborne and moving east to find and extract the wounded soldiers of Charlie Company. Captain Ronald Bachman piloted the primary HH-43, call sign \"Pedro 97\". Captain Harold Salem piloted the back-up aircraft, \"Pedro 73\". Behind the pilot and co-pilot in Pedro 73, was Airman William Pitsenbarger. His only remark when the call for help arrived had been, \"I have a bad feeling about this mission.\" It was the first time the pararescueman had ever voiced any misgivings about any mission.\n\nBy 3:30 the two Air Force choppers were hovering over the tops of the jungle canopy while death and devastation raged below. Pedro 97 went in first, lowering the stokes litter to retrieve one of the wounded. Then Captain Bachman pulled back a short distance to transfer the patient to a folding litter while Pedro 73 went in to pick up a second wounded soldier. That done, Captain Bachman returned to use the stokes to pull one more wounded soldier from the field of battle. The two Huskies then turned towards the field aid station 7 miles away near the village of Binh Ba. While the three initial recovered casualties were unloaded, Pits and Pedro 97's PJ Sergeant David Milsten discussed \"going in\" on the choppers' return.\n\nThe choppers could only carry two stokes litter patients on each in-and-out, and only one if there was no PJ aboard. Ambulatory casualties could be hoisted to the waiting choppers on \"jungle penetrators\". This cable contained 3 spring-loaded seats that could be dropped through the heavy canopy to pull up men capable of riding the hoist up. Usually when a PJ \"went in\", he rode the penetrator down to either load a casualty in the stokes litter or aid two casualties in riding the penetrator. With the three-seat penetrator, a PJ could send up three wounded, then ride back up to his Huskie with two more wounded on a second lift. This allowed the rescue team to recover 4-5 wounded men with each in and out trip of the helicopters.\n\nOn the ground, things had gone from bad to worse. Army Sergeant Fred Navarro of Hutchins, Kansas was a squad leader in Charlie 2/16th. Seven of his 10-man squad had already been killed in action. Navarro himself was wounded. Nearby Lieutenant Johnny Libs was doing his best to bring some semblance of order to what remained of his platoon. Dead and dying were everywhere and panic was pushing his young soldiers beyond reason. Then, over the cries of the wounded, he heard the sound of a returning rescue helicopter. Moments later a stokes litter was being lowered to the ground. Still taking fire, the infantrymen were struggling between survival and attempts to load a wounded man in the litter.\n\nFrom above, Airman Pitsenbarger watched them struggle with the apparatus. He turned to Captain Salem at the controls and said, \"I'm going in.\" The captain consented and slowly the choppers crew chief Airman First Class Gerald Hammond lowered his friend on the jungle penetrator. Totally exposed at the end of the cable, enemy rounds sang past the gallant PJ as he voluntarily rode the penetrator into a nightmare beyond human comprehension.\n\nLieutenant Libs strained his eyes against the unexpected sight. He turned to his machine gunner and said, \"That guy coming out of the helicopter from above, in an Air Force uniform, must be out of his mind to leave his not-so-safe helicopter for the inferno on the ground.\" Days later in retrospect, he added, \"We were in the fight of our lives, and I just couldn't understand why anybody would put himself in this grave danger if he didn't have to.\"\n\nWhen the young PJs feet touched the ground, he went into immediate action. His experience expedited the process of getting the wounded soldier into the stokes litter and a fourth casualty was being hauled skyward. Once the man was airborne the crew of Pedro 73 expected their pararescueman to ride the penetrator back up to his waiting chopper. Instead, Airman Pitsenbarger waved them off, electing to remain with the soldiers on the ground. Without their PJ aboard, the chopper could only carry out one stokes patient, so Pedro 73 headed back to Binh Ba.\n\nAs Captain Salem headed towards the aid station, Pedro 97 moved in to hover over the battlefield. Under the guidance of the brave PJ, the infantrymen were able to quickly send two more stokes patients to safety. The rescue effort took on new efficiency with an experienced man on the ground. In little more than an hour, the two birds had each made two in-and-out trips to recover six wounded soldiers.\n\nAfter unloading at Binh Ba, Pedro 73 diverted to refuel while Captain Bachman and Pedro 97 returned for the fifth pick-up of the day. This time, working in tandem with Sergeant Milsten on Pedro 97, Pitsenbarger was able to load one litter case and two more wounded on the penetrator. Nine men out and Captain Salem was returning for more as Pedro 97 headed for Binh Ba with their heaviest load of the day.\n\nAs Captain Salem hovered, the Airman Hammond began lowering the stokes from Pedro 73. On the ground, Pits signaled for the penetrator. Since the litter was already outside the helicopter, Hammond placed the penetrator inside the stokes and began lowering both. The package was about 10 feet off the ground and Pits was reaching upwards to receive it when a flurry of enemy .30 caliber rounds from two separate positions, raked the hovering rescue helicopter. At least nine rounds hit the aircraft, one of them tearing through the wiring and causing the throttle control to jam at full throttle. The power and rpm shot over the red lines and the helicopter lurched forward and up...out of control. The stokes litter dragged through the trees as Captain Salem fought for control. Among other problems, he had also lost partial rudder control.\n\nThe dragging litter threatened to snag in the foliage and bring Pedro 73 crashing to the ground. Quickly the pilot threw the switches to arm the cable cutter, releasing the litter and freeing his aircraft. As Salem fought to save his Huskie, his departure left the valiant PJ stranded on the ground with Sergeant Navarro, Lieutenant Libs, and the few survivors of Charlie Company.\n\nWilliam Pitsenbarger loved his job. An adventurer since boyhood, his greatest thrill had always been the opportunity to save lives. His medical training had served him well, so well in fact, that he had applied to Arizona State University to study to become a medical technician or male nurse upon completion of his Air Force tour of duty a couple of months hence. Now, stranded on the ground with the few survivors of Charlie Company, he took little time to ponder the predicament into which he had voluntarily placed himself.\n\nEven as the enemy fire continued to scorch the area, he moved among the casualties to tend the wounded and administer life-saving medical attention. When he found the bodies of American boys that could not be saved, he gathered weapons and ammunition to distribute among those who could still fight. Finding one wounded infantryman, injured beyond the ability to fire a rifle, Pits gave the soldier his own pistol to enable him to continue to resist. He was one of the few calm visions of hope that moved among the damned.\n\nHow bad was it on the ground? One of the few survivors, Army Lieutenant Martin Kroah later said, \"At times, the small; arms fire would be so intense that it was deafening, and all a person could do was get as close to the ground as possible and pray. It was on those occasions I saw Airman Pitsenbarger moving around and pulling wounded men out of the line of fire and then bandaging their wounds. My own platoon medic, who was later killed, was totally ineffective. He was frozen with fear, unable to move. The firing was so intense that a fire team leader in my platoon curled up in a fetal position and sobbed uncontrollably. He had been in combat in both World War II and Korea.\"\n\nOne cannot judge the young men who reacted to the horrible events of April 11th with fear and panic. Ranging in age from 19-21, most had never witnessed such horror firsthand. One must imagine William Pitsenbarger must have felt fear himself. No sane man could live through such a nightmare without such emotion. But what made the young pararescueman from Piqua, Ohio stand out was how he dealt with fear. His decisions were deliberate, calculated, and carried out with the highest degree of professionalism.\n\nPits expected the Air Force Huskies, or at least Pedro 97, to return for more wounded. He noticed the stokes litter caught high in the jungle canopy. Despite the continuing enemy fire, he climbed the trees to salvage the litter and make it ready for the choppers' return. Indeed, after escorting the badly damaged Pedro 73 to an emergency landing, Captain Bachman and his team returned. By this time, the Viet Cong were lobbing mortars into the area, and American forces responded by dropping artillery rounds in and around the small perimeter the survivors of Charlie Company were trying to create. Pedro 97 hovered in the area as darkness fell, then returned to Bien Hoa to wait out the night.\n\nIn the hour and a half Pits was on the ground, he was everywhere. When the company was ordered to move a short distance, the intrepid Airman began cutting branches to improvise litters to transport the wounded. As darkness began to fall, he disappeared for about 10 minutes, returning to the area receiving the heaviest enemy fire with 20 or more magazines of ammunition he had scrounged from among the dead. Next to him, the wounded Sergeant Navarro was struggling to stay alive and to resist. Quickly the total darkness of the jungle night was falling across the area as the two men lay in their position returning fire on the enemy. It was nearing 7:30 in the evening as the enemy fire was beginning to taper off. Sporadic rounds continued to whistle through the air around Sergeant Navarro, but with the encroaching darkness, there was coming an eerie quiet as well. Next to him, all was quiet. No longer could he hear the sounds of William Pitsenbarger's M-16. Even without looking the young infantry sergeant knew what had happened. William Pitsenbarger was dead.\n\nOf the 291 men, fewer than 20 men survived the night of April 11-12, 1966. As the enemy pulled back from the surrounded remainder of Charlie Company, in the total darkness of the jungle, civilian women and children under Viet Cong control slipped through the underbrush to recover the VC dead and wounded.\n\nThe only real defense the American survivors had in the dark rain forest came from American artillery. Every fifteen seconds from 8:30 Monday evening until 7:00 A.M. Tuesday morning, five or six rounds of artillery fell within 25 meters of the small perimeter to keep the enemy at bay.\n\nMeanwhile, Alpha and Bravo Companies poised themselves for a rescue attempt at daylight. In the darkness of the early morning, Army Engineers slipped into the jungle to clear a landing place for the helicopters that would come with the dawn to extract the survivors and the bodies of the dead.\n\nArriving with the Army's CH47 helicopters on Tuesday morning was the only operable Huskie from Detachment 6. The PJ on board was one of the Pits' closest friends, Harry O'Berne. The Huskie was the first chopper to land and O'Berne moved among the dead to find and load three wounded infantrymen. Then, as the Huskie lifted off, O'Berne remained on the ground to treat wounded and load them on the Army Chinook. As he moved among the bodies that littered the jungle floor, an Army captain approached and asked if he was a medic. O'Berne replied that he was. \"I'm sorry but one of your buddies was killed last night,\" he informed the PJ, then pointed towards a poncho covered bundle in the distance.\n\nSlowly, O'Berne approached to gently lift the poncho. Beneath was the body of his friend, Pararescue medic William Pitsenbarger...shot four times. In one lifeless hand Pits still held his M-16 rifle. In the other, he still clutched his medical kit.\n\nWithin days of that horrible night, Sergeant Fred Navarro provided the Air Force with a taped statement detailing the heroism of Airman First Class William Pitsenbarger in support of a recommendation for the Medal of Honor. Few witnesses remained of the young PJs service and sacrifice. Of the 134 soldiers in Charlie Company at the beginning of Operation Abilene, there were 106 casualties. Only two members of Sergeant Navarro's 10-man squad had survived.\n\nArmy Staff Sergeant James Robinson was submitted for the Medal of Honor for his heroic sacrifice during Operation Abilene. His posthumous award was presented to his father at the Pentagon in ceremonies on July 16, 1967. The recommendation for William Pitsenbarger's Medal of Honor was downgraded to the Air Force Cross. When Mr. and Mrs. Pitsenbarger accepted that award on behalf of their heroic son on September 22, 1966, William Pits Pitsenbarger became the first enlisted airman in history to receive the Air Force's second-highest award for military heroism, posthumously.\n\nTwelve members of the United States Air Force received Medals of Honor for heroic actions in Vietnam. Just one month prior to the Easter Sunday beginning of Operation Abilene, Major Bernard Francis Fisher became the first person to earn the newly designed Air Force Medal of Honor. (During the Korean War, four Air Force pilots were posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor but all received the Army design for the award.)\n\nFour years after William Pitsenbarger's death, Airman First Class John Lee Levitow became the first and only enlisted airman to receive our Nation's highest military award.\n\nWilliam Pitsenbarger's story survived for more than three decades, making the young airman something of an Air Force legend. In the 1990s, a campaign was initiated by numerous private citizens as well as federal officials, to revisit the story of the boy from Piqua, Ohio. The subsequent review determined that the level of voluntary heroism displayed by the 21-year old PJ in the jungles of Vietnam was more in keeping with the levels of valor reflected by the Medal of Honor.\n\nOn December 8, 2000, an impressive ceremony was held at Wright-Patterson AFB in Pits' home state of Ohio. The guest list included combat veterans, hundreds of pararescue airmen, a Congressional representative, and the Air Force Chief of Staff. Also attending was an elderly gentleman, now well into his 80s...William F. Pitsenbarger. Amid a flood of memories, an invocation by the Chief of the Air Force Chaplain Service, and remarks by the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, Secretary of the Air Force the Honorable F. Whitten Peters stepped to the podium. Then, with the dignity unprecedented valor demands, the story of William Pitsenbarger was read in greater detail than his Air Force Cross citation had set forth. At long last, after 34 years, the young PJ would indeed receive the Medal of Honor. The elder Pitsenbarger gratefully accepted the award on behalf of his only son."}, {"url": "https://blog.togetherweserved.com/2021/08/06/joe-ronnie-hooper/", "page_content": "Joe Ronnie Hooper had his share non-judicial punishments (authorized by Article 15 of UCMJ), racked up 115 confirmed kills and was awarded the Medal of Honor. He was also one of the most decorated soldiers in American international combat.\n\nBrief Navy Service\n\nBorn in the summer of 1938 in South Carolina, Joe Ronnie Hooper was relocated as a child to Moses Lake, Washington where he attended Moses Lake High School.\n\nOriginally a Navy man, Hooper first enlisted in December of 1956. After graduation from boot camp at San Diego, California he served as an Airman aboard USS Wasp (CV-18) and USS Hancock (CV-19). He was honorably discharged in July 1959, shortly after being advanced to Petty Officer Third Class.\n\nUS Army Enlistment\n\nThe next year, Hooper enlisted in the US Army as a Private First Class. After graduating Basic Training, he volunteered for Airborne School. From there he did tours of duty in Fort Bragg, Korea, and Fort Hood, eventually making his way to Fort Campbell\u2019s 101st Airborne Division.\n\nNow a Staff Sergeant, Hooper requested a tour in Vietnam but was sent to Panama instead as a Platoon Sergeant. Unable to stay out of trouble while he was there, he was the subject of several Article 15 hearings and was eventually demoted to Corporal. However, he eventually got his Sergeant stripes back and deployed with the 101st to Vietnam in December of 1967, taking on the role of a Squad Leader. During his tour of duty with Delta Company (Delta Raiders), 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 501st Airborne Infantry, 101st Airborne Division, he was recommended for the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions on February 21, 1968, outside of the city of Hue.\n\nOn February 21st, 1968, Hooper and his company were beginning an assault on an enemy position when they came under fire by everything from machine guns to rockets.\n\nAccording to his Medal of Honor citation, Hooper\u2019s unit \u201cwas assaulting a heavily defended enemy position along a riverbank when it encountered a withering hail of fire from rockets, machine guns, and automatic weapons. Staff Sergeant Hooper rallied several men and stormed across the river, overrunning several bunkers on the opposite shore.\n\nThus inspired, the rest of the company moved to the attack. With utter disregard for his own safety, he moved out under the intense fire again and pulled back the wounded, moving them to safety. During this act, Hooper was seriously wounded, but he refused medical aid and returned to his men. With the relentless enemy fire disrupting the attack, he single-handedly stormed 3 enemy bunkers, destroying them with a hand grenade and rifle fire, and shot 2 enemy soldiers who had attacked and wounded the Chaplain.\n\nLeading his men forward in a sweep of the area, Hooper destroyed three buildings housing enemy riflemen. At this point, he was attacked by a North Vietnamese officer whom he fatally wounded with his bayonet. Finding his men under heavy fire from a house to the front, he proceeded alone to the building, killing its occupants with rifle fire and grenades. By now, his initial body wound had been compounded by grenade fragments, yet despite the multiple wounds and loss of blood, he continued to lead his men against the intense enemy fire.\n\nAs his squad reached the final line of enemy resistance, it received devastating fire from four bunkers in line on its left flank. Hooper gathered several hand grenades and raced down a small trench which ran the length of the bunker line, tossing grenades into each bunker as he passed by, killing all but two of the occupants.\n\nWith these positions destroyed, he concentrated on the last bunkers facing his men, destroying the first with an incendiary grenade and neutralizing two more by rifle fire. He then raced across an open field, still under enemy fire, to rescue a wounded man who was trapped in a trench. Upon reaching the man, he was faced by an armed enemy soldier whom he killed with a pistol. Moving his comrade to safety and returning to his men, he neutralized the final pocket of enemy resistance by fatally wounding three North Vietnamese officers with rifle fire. Hooper then established a final line and reorganized his men, not accepting (medical) treatment until this was accomplished and not consenting to evacuation until the following morning.\u201d\n\nPresident Nixon awarded Joe Ronnie Hooper the Medal of Honor\n\nWhile he was discharged from the Infantry upon his return from Vietnam in 1968, he managed to re-enlist and serve as a Public Affairs specialist until President Richard Nixon awarded him the Medal of Honor in 1969.\n\nHooper eventually managed to finagle his way back into the Infantry, serving a second tour in Vietnam as a pathfinder with the 101st Airborne. By 1970, he had been commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant, though he was discharged from an active commission shortly after due to inadequate educational requirements.\n\nDischarged and a little sour about it, Hooper managed to retain his commission in the Army Reserve\u2019s 12th Special Forces Group before being transferred to a training unit. Though he was eventually promoted to Captain, he was discharged a final time in 1978 after a spotty drill record.\n\nMuch like the war he fought in, Hooper is not as well-known as other Medal of Honor recipients of his stature. According to accounts, he was a likable guy who partied hard, drank a lot and related to veterans. However, he was allegedly rather troubled by America\u2019s treatment of soldiers and attitudes towards the war in general.\n\nHe is credited with 115 enemy killed in ground combat, 22 of which occurred on February 21, 1968. He became one of the most decorated soldiers in the Vietnam War and was one of three soldiers who were wounded in action eight times in the war.\n\nMedals and Awards\n\nIn addition to the Medal of Honor, Hooper was also awarded two Silver Stars, 6 Bronze Stars with \u201cV\u201d Devices, an Air Medal, the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm and 8 Purple Hearts.\n\nJoe Hooper was found dead in a hotel room in Louisville, Kentucky on May 5, 1979, having suffered a cerebral hemorrhage in his sleep at the age of 40.\n\nHe is buried at Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington County, Virginia.\n\nA book written by Peter Maslowsk is available on Amazon.com.

Second Army was requested to support it by mounting diversionary operations. The attack on Spanbroekmolen was one of them.\n\nWar diary, General Staff at Second Army Headquarters, 12 March 1915:\n\nIn order to hold the enemy to his ground and prevent him from despatching reinforcements south, II Corps carried out an infantry attack at Spanbroekmolen. Owing to fog operations did not commence until 2.30pm. At 4.30pm the infantry (3rd Division) attacked but owing to heavy fire from concealed MGs [machine guns], the attack did not succeed. The troops were withdrawn without difficulty after dark.\n\nPersonal diary of Captain Gerald Achilles Burgoyne, 2nd Royal Irish Rifles (from book \u201cThe Burgoyne Diaries: the first winter at Ypres with the Royal Irish Rifles), Pen & Sword 2015)\n\n13th March 1915. And the story, as far as I can now reconstruct it, is one of failure; a failure due entirely due to our artillery; who is to blame for this, I do not know, and it is to us at present, immaterial. .. In justice to them [the artillery] I must add that I now hear they were very averse to firing yesterday at all, owing to the state of the atmosphere being to bad for observation.\n\nThe attack cost 155 British dead.\n\nOn 9 March 1915 the artillery of 3rd and 5th Divisions opened fire on a pre-arranged programme, the bulk of it being aimed at Spanbroek Molen. They repeated it next day (10 March, the day on which British First Army began the Battle of Neuve Chapelle). German rifle fire was believed to indicate that they were apprehensive of an imminent British attack. Orders were given to the battalions in the front line that every endeavour was to be made to make the Germans think that an attack was to be made against Hollandsche Schuur. Gaps were opened in the British barbed wire defences, indicative of an imminent infantry advance. Orders were shouted out, drawing enemy fire.\n\n11 March 1915\n\nThe headquarters of 3rd Division issued detailed orders for the attack.\n\nWar diary, 7th Infantry Brigade (tasked with carrying out the attack):\n\nBrigade in billets at Locre, 1 battalion at Westouter.\n\nWar diary, staff at headquarters of 8th Infantry Brigade (next to and north of the 7th, tasked with diversion):\n\nThe night was abnormally quiet. The morning was foggy. Arrangements had been made for a heavy bombardment of Hollandsche Schuur from 11.30am to 3.30pm, preceded by some rounds from all guns fired for verification of ranges during the morning. The morning was misty and the programme had to be postponed for about one hour [as the fall of shot could not be observed]. The bombardment therefore took place from 2.30pm to 4.30pm. Considerable fire was brought to bear on Spanbroek Molen and neighbourhood but the bulk was on Hollandsche Schuur in the hopes of making the enemy think that an attack on this point was imminent. The bombardment against the trenches was effective and did much damage, but a section of 40th Field Artillery Brigade specially detailed for wire-cutting in front of Hollandsche Schuur failed to obtain any decisive results. At 2pm GOC [Brigadier-General W. H. Bowes] visited GOC 3rd Division [Major-General J. A. L. Haldane] at Scherpenberg. [The latter] explained to him the operations planned for the following day. Consequently on this the Brigade-Major was sent to visit the COs of the firing-line battalions to arrange with them to take steps again to make the enemy expect an attack on the Hollandsche Schuur front. It was arranged with OC 2nd Suffolk Regiment [in] K2 and L trenches should close the gaps he had made in his wire as these were considered unnecessary and they involved a slight risk, that he should patrol to the front, and should continue his sapping. OC 4th Middlesex was instructed to leave the gaps in his wire open, to patrol his front well, and continue his work on communication trenches. \u2026 The night was fine and passed quietly.\n\nPreliminary arrangements. Assembly trenches were dug for 2 battalions in rear of E and F Sectors. These trenches were 2\u20196\u2033 wide and 3\u20196\u2033 deep with a step and berm in front so that the troops could get out easily. \u2026 Bridges for crossing our own and disused trenches ones were made 16\u2032 long and 2\u20196\u2033 wide, strong enough to carry 4 men at once. 500 yards of portable knife rest pattern barbed wire entanglements were made and s supply of sandbags, etc collected. The 57th Field Company with an infantry battalion as a carrying party were in charge of the preliminary arrangements. The 56th Field Company was detailed to the assault \u2026\n\n12 March 1915: the assault force moves into position\n\nWar diary, 1st Wiltshire Regiment\n\nLeft billets at Locre at 2.45am and marched via Kemmel to the section of the trenches known as F in front of Spanbroekmolen. The battalion arrived in position at dawn about 5.30am and occupied four lines of trenches on the reverse of the hill, the Worcestershire Regiment being in trenches on our right. Battalion headquarters were in the trench known as F2, about 50 yards in front of the front trench in which the battalion was situated. These trenches were about 25 yards apart. [The East Surrey Regiment held F2 during the operation]\n\nWar diary, 3rd Worcestershire Regiment\n\nLeft billets at Locre at 2.30am and occupied \u201cassembly trenches\u201d west of Spanbroekmolen preparatory to an assault on the German trenches at Spanbroekmolen. The orders for the assault were that it was to be carried out by two companies Worcestershire Regiment on right and two companies Wiltshire Regiment on left, the remaining two companies of each battalion being detailed one (each) to dig communication trench to captured German trench and one (each) to consolidate and place in a state of defence the German trench when captured. The assault to be preceded by an artillery bombardment at 7am. The assault at 8.40am. \u2026 During the night the [barbed] wire had been moved and some plank bridges made across the trenches.\n\nWar diary, 56th Field Company, Royal Engineers:\n\nCompany marched [from billets at Mont Noir] at 0.30am, picking up Number 3 Section at La Clytte, and arriving at Kemmel crossroads at 3.05am. Numbers 3 and 4 Sections attached themselves to the Wiltshires and guided them to the assembly trenches. Numbers 1 and 2 Sections similarly acted as guides to the Worcesters from Lindenhoek. The assembly trenches were fully occupied by 5.45am. Number 2 Section (Lieut. C. G. Martin) was allotted the task of accompanying the assaulting party and rushing and blocking the communication trenches on the right. Number 3 Section (2/Lieut. B. C. Denning) a similar task on the left. Number 1 Section (under Capt. G. E. Sopwith \u2026) were allotted the opening of communication trenches from the German trenches to E1 and E2, while Number 4 Section (2/Lieut A. R. R. Woods) had to open a communication trench to F4. These trenches were not to be opened until the assaulting column had taken the front trenches and pushed out a covering party. With Number 2 and 3 Sections were parties of one officers and 12 men each, and with numbers 1 and 4 Sections were a company each.\n\nWar diary, 2nd South Lancashire Regiment\n\nThe battalion was ordered to occupy assembly trenches which had been previously prepared. The battalion marched from billets at Locre at 3am, moving via Kemmel and Lindenhoek. Thee march was delayed in consequence of the road being blocked by the 1/4th South Lancashire Regiment which was returning from carrying stores to Kemmel and by working parties of 85th Brigade. It was nearly broad daylight when the battalion moved into position. Cover was taken behind a small wood and folds in the ground, the assembly trenches being fully occupied by the Worcesters and Wilts.\n\nThe 2nd Royal Irish Rifles, also of 7th Infantry Brigade, remained in reserve at Lindenhoek.\n\n12 March 1915: postponement\n\nWar diary, 7th Infantry Brigade:\n\nUnits reported that they were in position in the assembly trenches at 6.10am. A thick mist hung over the country and shortly before 7am orders were received from 3rd Division that the attack would be postponed.\n\n12 March 1915: the attack finally goes in\n\nWar diary, 7th Infantry Brigade:\n\nThe mist began to clear away at about 1pm and at 2.08pm a message was received from 3rd Division ordering the artillery to commence registering at 2.30pm. [Registration was a process of firing observed shots and making adjustments so that future shots would fall accurately on target. It was a certain way of giving up surprise]. The artillery fire seemed to be good (except in the case of shorts) and the effect was thought satisfactory. [\u201cShorts\u201d were shells that fell short of their target \u2013 and with the opposing front lines being close together this represented serious danger to the assault force].\n\nWar diary, 1st Wiltshire Regiment\n\nAt 1pm the mist began to clear and by 2.30pm it was clear and the artillery bombardment began and continued with a slight pause till 4.10pm. It consisted of field guns firing shrapnel to cut the hostile [barbed] wire and large quantity of heavy high explosive to beat down the enemy\u2019s parapets and blow in his trenches [and] this appeared to be fairly successful, but it was afterwards observed that the enemy\u2019s front line trenches were almost intact. At 4.10pm the infantry assault was launched by two companies of 1st Wiltshires and two companies of the Worcestershire Regiment, accompanied by a party of RE [Royal Engineers], the remaining two companies being detailed as working parties. The front company (A, Capt. P. J. V. Viner-Johnson) rushed forward, crossing the trench known as F by means of flying bridges which had been placed in position early in the morning and passing through our barbed [wire] by means of gaps which had been made opposite the bridges. As soon as A Company were clear of the bridges, B (Capt. R. H. Broome) followed them. As soon as A Company had got across the bridges, the enemy opened a very heavy rifle and machine gun fire on them, and only a few small isolated parties succeeded in getting up to the enemy\u2019s wire, a distance of about 200 yards. B Company also came under a very heavy fire and were unable, with the remainder of A Company, to get more than 50 yards from F2. At the same time, most of the Worcestershire Regiment on the right appeared to be also unable to get on. B Company endeavoured to crawl forward but were unable to get very far and gradually starting about 5pm began to fall back into F2, suffering considerably in doing so. Most of the survivors of A Company \u2026 got back under power of darkness.\n\nWar diary, 7th Infantry Brigade:\n\nThe German front line was strongly occupied and machine guns posted in a redoubt near Peckham on the north inflicted severe loss on the left of the attack [that is, on the Wiltshires].\n\nWar diary, 3rd Worcestershire Regiment\n\nThe battalion lay in the assembly trenches all day. They were very wet. \u2026 The distribution of the battalion was: 1st Company (assaulting), C Company under Capt. Goff; 2nd Company (assaulting), A Company under Capt. Hewett; 3rd Company (for digging communication trench), D Company under Capt. Traill; 4th Company (for consolidating position), B Company under Capt Maitland. Punctually at 4.10pm the leading company left their assembly trench followed by the second company. They came after passing our trenches a heavy rifle and machine gun fire. The latter principally from the front and right front. Heavy casualties occurred but a party of about 40 NCOs and men with 2/Lieut Holland and Lieut Martin RE succeeded in occupying a part of the front German trench. 2/Lieut Clarke was hit just going into the trench and [was] carried in, dying shortly afterwards. A party had been collected \u2026 [illegible] \u2026 and were just about to make a dash for the German trench to support when our own artillery unfortunately dropped a high explosive shell killing and wounding a number and scattering the remainder. The party that had gained the trench proceeded at once to block each end and succeeded in holding on for over three hours until ordered to withdraw under cover of darkness. They succeeded in bringing away all the wounded from the German trench.\n\nWar diary, 56th Field Company, Royal Engineers:\n\nThe attack failed, although Lieut. Martin and 2nd Cpl. Skinner gained a footing in a German trench with their infantry party, and held it till 6.30pm when they were ordered to retire. Numbers 1 and 4 Sections did not therefore come into action. During the assault, Major Barnardiston, who accompanied the left of the Worcesters assault, was wounded, also Lieut. Martin and 2/Lieut. Denning. In addition 18 rank and file were killed or wounded.\n\nWar diary, 2nd South Lancashire Regiment\n\nThe battalion [remained] in support. After [the attack] had failed, the battalion was heavily shelled for about 1.5 hours. A great many shells went just over the battalion but the men were absolutely steady and owing to the good dispositions made by company commanders, those that burst near did not do much damage.\n\nWar diary, 1/1st Honourable Artillery Company (7th Infantry Brigade but attached to 85th at the time)\n\nIn F Sector trenches. The attack [by the Worcesters and Wiltshires] failed through the machine gun emplacements of the enemy not having been destroyed by our artillery. Three of the emplacements had been pointed out to higher authorities on several occasions previous to the attack. We lost three killed in F4 [and had 5 wounded].\n\nWar diary, 3rd Division Commander Royal Artillery:\n\nNo success, due to insufficient weight of howitzer metal, it is thought. Aeroplanes could not work with us due to low cloud.\n\nCasualties\n\nWar diary, 1st Wiltshire Regiment\n\nKilled: Capt. P. J. V. Viner-Johnson, Lieut. O. J. Calley, 2/Lieut. S. F. Hooper, 2/Lieut. D.

Chuter, Sappers McCloskey and Jordan, and Pioneer Hurley..\n\nMiscellaneous press clippings\n\nMy view\n\nIt is easy to say in retrospect, but in my view this operation that should never have been authorised. Its potential effects as a diversion to the attack at Neuve Chapelle were questionable; the resources available for the attack too few; the selected objective as difficult as it could be. Tactically, the attack repeated the mistakes of December 1914 as being on too narrow a front. Warnings of protected enemy machine gun positions appear to have been ignored and confidence on what in retrospect was a very weak artillery bombardment was unjustifiably high. Once the planned attack had to be postponed it really should have been abandoned. The bravery and spirit of the assault units is not called into question. Spanbroekmolen would not fall until June 1917, and only then by being obliterated by an enormous underground mine.\n\nSources\n\nWar diary 3rd Division Commander Royal Artillery.
