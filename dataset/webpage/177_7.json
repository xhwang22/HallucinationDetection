He was 88.\n\nIn 1942, while an assistant professor of physical chemistry at Brown University, Howe was recruited to study nuclear energy under physicist and Nobel laureate Arthur Compton at the University of Chicago. Under the code name \"Metallurgical Laboratory,\" the project created the world's first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction.\n\nA resident of La Jolla for the past three decades, Howe was a sportsman and outdoors enthusiast who played tennis until suffering a head injury at age 85. The cause of death was complications from a fall, his family said.\n\nHowe came to Cornell in 1961 from the Atomics International Division of North American Aviation. At Cornell he was Ford Professor of Engineering in the Department of Engineering Physics, later becoming director of the materials science department. His fields of teaching and research were engineering physics, nuclear science and engineering, and nuclear materials.\n\nAfter leaving Cornell, Howe spent a year at the Institute for Defense, Washington, D.C., then, in 1968, joined General Atomic of La Jolla, retiring in 1975 as technical director of advanced energy systems. He then served as an adjunct professor of applied mechanics and engineering science at the University of California, San Diego.\n\nBorn June 24, 1910, on a farm in Groton, N.Y., the son of Mather Crain Howe and Bell Gertrude Smith, Howe graduated from Groton High School, Hobart College (B.S., summa cum laude, 1933) in Geneva, N.Y., and Brown University (Ph.D. 1936). He was an instructor at Ohio State University (1936-1938), and assistant professor at Brown (1938-1942).\n\nIn 1942 he became associate director of general research and development on reactors for the Metallurgical Laboratory, Manhattan District, at the University of Chicago. In 1944, he was\n\nsent to Hanford, Wash., to act as the laboratory's liaison for reactors designed to produce plutonium for the Manhattan Project, the highly secret government program to produce the atomic bomb.\n\nAfter the war, in 1945, he became manager of the metallurgy section of General Electric's (GE) Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory in Schenectady, N.Y. From 1952 to 1953, he conducted research in energy conversion and storage for the GE Research Laboratory.\n\nHowe served in 1955 as an adviser to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) at the First International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in Geneva, Switzerland. He also served on numerous committees of the AEC, the General Advisory Group of the Air Force Office of Aerospace Research. A member of numerous professional organizations, he was a fellow of the American Nuclear Society and the American Physical Society. He co-edited Progress in Nuclear Energy, Series V, Vols. 1, 2, and 3; Metallurgy and Fuels; and the Journal of Nuclear Materials.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 57 years, Marilyn; three children; and four grandchildren.\n\n-30-"}, {"url": "https://heritagepost.org/revolutionary-war/john-howe-1754-1835/", "page_content": "Early Life\n\nHowe was born in 1754, the same year that the French and Indian War or Seven Years\u2019 War (1754\u20131763) began. It was the consequences of this conflict that motivated the British to demand greater taxes from, and assert greater control over, their American colonies and it was the consequences of this conflict that raised and disappointed the English-American colonists\u2019 expectations about their opportunities for expansion, all of which contributed to the colonists\u2019 determination to revolt against an increasingly costly, authoritarian, and obstructive British rule. Howe was eight years old at the end of this war on September 7, 1763, so he grew to maturity influenced by the events that followed, such as colonial resistance to the Stamp Act (1765-66), when he was 11, and the violence of the Boston Massacre (1770), in which British troops opened fire on a mob of Bostonians who were brawling with the troops, when he was 16.\n\nHowe\u2019s family were converts to a religious sect called the Sandemanians, whose best-known member was Michael Faraday, the famous scientist. The sect began when the Rev. John Glas (1695\u20131773), who had been the Presbyterian minister at Tealing, Perthshire, Scotland, sought a return to a \u201cNew Testament Christianity\u201d that included Agapes, pacifism, good works, charity, communal property, as well as a strong opposition to state control over the church. These views led to his suspension from the Church of Scotland in 1728. With the help of his son-in-law, Robert Sandeman, the sect grew to several churches in Scotland and England. Sandeman first moved to London in 1760 and then, in 1764, to New England. He arrived in Boston, where he helped his nephew get established as a bookseller, and then moved to Danbury, Connecticut, where he lived until his death in April, 1771. Sandeman\u2019s teachings to live a more purely Christian life appealed to New England\u2019s Puritan descendants and, with the rising tensions between the colonists and royal rule, Sandeman\u2019s command to \u201cFear God and honour the King\u201d and \u201cif it be possible\u2026 live peacefully with all men\u201d found a receptive audience amongst the loyalists. A Joseph Howe is listed as a member of the Boston Sandemanians; this was probably John\u2019s father, but it might have been John\u2019s elder brother. John Howe\u2019s Sandemanian beliefs likely contributed to his loyalist stance, and definitely contributed to his lifelong pacifism.\n\nJohn Howe probably began his apprenticeship as a printer to Richard Draper in either 1766 or 1767. Richard Draper was the King\u2019s printer in Massachusetts and the publisher of the Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly News Letter, the oldest English newspaper in the Americas. As Richard Draper was known to be a frail and sickly man, and as he was Draper\u2019s apprentice, John Howe probably witnessed and wrote the article about the Boston Tea Party that appeared in the December 23, 1773, issue. Less than six months after the report on the Boston Tea Party, Richard Draper, owner of the Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly News Letter, died on June 5 or 6, 1774, leaving the paper in the hands of his widow, Margaret Draper. Richard Draper may have anticipated his demise, as he formed a partnership with John Boyle in May, the month before his death. However, Margaret Draper soon ended this partnership (between August 4 and 11, 1774) as Boyle did not share her loyalist sympathies. Margaret Draper published the paper by herself from August 11, 1774.\n\nA Loyalist printer in the American Revolution\n\nOn April 19, 1775, the opening battle of the American Revolution occurred when the British forces raided inland from Boston to Concord \u201cto destroy a Magazine of Military Stores deposited there.\u201d When the raid broke into a firefight, the \u201cTroops had above Fifty killed, and many more wounded\u201d. In the April 20, 1775, issue of the Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly News Letter a short article appeared that briefly described the battle, and\u2014a day or more later\u2014a broadside was published that reported on the Battle of Lexington and Concord at greater length. Both were quite likely written and printed by John Howe, who would have been just a few months short of his 21st birthday. After the Battle of Lexington and Concord, news of the event quickly spread to the other colonies and American patriots came in great numbers to lay siege to Boston. On June 17, 1775, the American forces seized a hill across the Charles river to the north of Boston in Charlestown and began building fortifications upon it from which they would be able to fire upon the town and harbour. In the morning light, a British ship in the harbour, seeing the fortifications being constructed on the hill, began firing on the hill. Soon, British troops were ferried from Boston to Charlestown, where they charged up and took the hill, although at an enormous cost in lives. John Howe witnessed, wrote, and printed the broadside describing the Battle of Bunker Hill. In later years, he described his experiences at the battle to his youngest son, Joseph, in which he watched as General Sir William Howe led the final bayonet charge up the hill \u201cwith the bullets flying through the tails of his coat.\u201d After the battle, John told of aiding \u201ca young officer whose leg had been amputated and who he cured of a raging fever by letting him drink a bucket of cold water.\u201d Shortly after the battle, John Howe proposed to Martha Minns, who accepted and became his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nBattle of Lexington and Concord & Siege of Boston mapMargaret Draper continued to print the Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly News Letter until September 7, 1775, when she appears to have had some trouble as no issues were published (or at least no issues have been found) from September 14 to October 6, 1775. John Howe, although he was just completing his apprenticeship, became Margaret Draper\u2019s new partner, and he was listed as the publisher from October 13, 1775 (the day before his 21st birthday, the time at which apprenticeships were completed in the practice of the time) to the paper\u2019s final issue on February 22, 1776.\n\nOn March 5, 1776, American forces seized control of Dorchester Heights, a hill to the south of Boston, with a commanding view of Boston harbour. Meanwhile, Henry Knox brought the cannon seized from Fort Ticonderoga to Boston. Realizing that taking the hill would be too costly, and that the Americans would soon have cannon in place, the British decided to evacuate the town of all of their forces and the loyalists. The two sides agreed upon an informal cease-fire proposed and negotiated by those in Boston who were staying: the Americans agreed because they feared the British would set fire to Boston as they left, the British agreed because they didn\u2019t want to suffer the costs of evacuating Boston under fire. On March 17, 1776, the last troops and loyalists boarded ships in Boston harbour and set sail for Halifax, Nova Scotia. Margaret Draper, John\u2019s partner in the Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly News Letter, is listed as being amongst the loyalists evacuated from Boston to Halifax, and she was accompanied by John Howe. Margaret Draper then moved to England, where she lived on a pension from the British government.\n\nIn mid-1776, the British assembled troops on Staten Island. On August 22, they crossed over to Long Island, and on August 27, they engaged and defeated the Americans at the Battle of Long Island. A series of battles continued the New York Campaign, which was concluded with the British victory of Fort Washington on November 16, 1776. On November 26, General Clinton and 6,000 troops were sent to take Newport, RI, which they succeeded in doing on December 1. After this victory, the British offered John Howe the position of Printer for the Provincial Forces. John Howe moved to Newport, RI, along with his fianc\u00e9e, Martha Minns, and her brother, William Minns. He printed the first issue of the Newport Gazette on January 16, 1777, and he continued printing that newspaper until the final issue of October 6, 1779. During their stay in Newport, John Howe married Martha Minns on June 7, 1778. John Howe was named in the Banishment Act of the State of Massachusetts, 1778, possibly as a result of his work as printer for the British forces in Newport, Rhode Island. During this period, John Howe took on John Ryan, a native of Newport, as his apprentice, who later became the printer of the first newspaper in New Brunswick and then the King\u2019s Printer in Newfoundland.\n\nOn October 26, 1779, the British evacuated their troops and the loyalists from Newport, RI, to New York. On Christmas Day, 1779, John and Martha Howe\u2019s first child, Martha Howe, was born in New York. Sometime during 1780, John Howe and his young family, along with his brother-in-law William Minns, quit New York for Halifax, Nova Scotia. John Ryan remained in New York until 1783, becoming a partner with William Lewis in the New-York Mercury and General Advertiser.\n\nBuilding a life in Halifax\n\nOn his return to Halifax, John Howe, published the first issue of the Halifax Journal on December 28, 1780. The paper remained in the Howe family until about 1819 and continued to be printed until about 1870. About half of the Halifax Journal was dedicated to foreign news and essays reprinted from European publications, there was a short Halifax section that covered shipping news and local events, and it reported on issues debated in the Assembly as well as laws and proclamations that were not covered in the Nova Scotia Royal Gazette. John Howe\u2019s printing was notable for its quality. The type was carefully composed, the illustrations were well done, and the layout of stories and advertisements changed with each issue rather than filling the same preset layout. This set a superior standard for newspapers in the maritime colonies. In addition to the Halifax Journal, John Howe also did general printing such as pamphlets and sermons, and he printed an annual Almanack. In 1789, he began printing the monthly Nova Scotia Magazine and Comprehensive Review of Literature, Politics and News. John Howe began to serve as the magazine\u2019s editor in July 1790. In 1792, the Nova Scotia Magazine failed due to low subscriptions.\n\nDuring this period, John Howe\u2019s and Martha (Minns) Howe\u2019s family grew and suffered losses. On September 2, 1782, their second child, Sarah Howe, was born, but she died at the age of 10 months on June 23, 1783. On September 8, 1784, John Howe, Jr., their third child, was born; in 1786 their fourth child, William Howe, was born; and in 1788, Jane Howe, their fifth child was born. On November 10, 1790, David Howe, John and Martha\u2019s sixth child was born, but Martha (Minns) Howe died of complications from the birth on November 25, 1790. On December 25, 1797, John and Martha (Minns) Howe\u2019s first child, Martha Howe, married Edward Sentell.\n\nOn October 25, 1798, John Howe married his second wife, Mary (Ede) Austen, the widow of Henry Austen. Only a few months later, on January 19, 1799, Martha (Howe) Sentell, the first child of John and Martha (Minns) Howe died in childbirth. But happier events followed with the birth of Sarah Foster Howe in 1800, John Howe\u2019s seventh child and his first with Mary (Ede Austen) Howe. On December 4, 1804, his last and best-known child, Joseph Howe, was born.\n\nMeanwhile, John was appointed King\u2019s Printer in 1801, responsible for printing the Nova Scotia Royal Gazette and the Debates of the House of Assembly. In the same year, he was also appointed Postmaster of Halifax and \u201cagent manager and director of His Majesty\u2019s Packet boats in Halifax,\u201d a position that was extended to Deputy Postmaster-General of Nova Scotia, Cape Breton, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and the Bermudas in 1803. The postmaster positions included expanding and improving delivery routes and establishing way stations as required.\n\nJohn Howe\u2019s career as a spy\n\nIn 1803, as part of the British blockade of trade with the continent, which was part of the struggle against Napoleon\u2019s bid to conquer all of Europe, Britain ignored and violated American sovereignty by searching American ships trading with continental Europe (and therefore Napoleon\u2019s regime) and forcefully pressing American sailors into British service. In June, 1807, the HMS Leopard fired several shots on the USS Chesapeake when the American ship resisted a search and impressment attempt. Fearing that these events presaged war, Sir George Prevost, the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, arranged for a spy to tour the New England states and \u201cobserve whatever may be agitating.\u201d The man he chose for his spy was John Howe.\n\nHowe traveled through the American seaboard states, arriving in Boston on April 22, 1808, under the guise of visiting family and friends. He travelled from Boston to Washington, Norfolk, and New York. He reported on the political situation, predicted that Madison would be the next President, stated that there were French emissaries throughout the country, commented on the anti-British sentiment of the Irish in New York, and assessed the state of military preparedness. John Howe made a second trip to the United States from November 10, 1808 to January 5, 1809, but this visit was under the more official guise of \u201cbearer of Dispatches to the British Minister\u201d, that minister being David Montagu, Baron Erskine of Restormel Castle, the British Envoy at Washington from 1806 to 1810. This mission included accompanying Baron Erskine to interviews with President Thomas Jefferson and President-elect James Madison. John Howe concluded that war with the United States could be avoided if the British blockade and tariff on ships entering French ports (which was having a devastating effect on the American economy) were rescinded, but if they were not, war was probably unavoidable and attacks on the British North American colonies were likely. When Madison declared war on Britain, beginning the War of 1812, he cited the British Orders in Council which established the blockade and tariff, just as John Howe had predicted, and attacks on the British North American colonies (later Canada) did occur.\n\nJohn Howe\u2019s later years\n\nAfter his brief career as a spy, John returned to his usual work as printer and postmaster in Halifax. On October 16, 1808, John Howe\u2019s eldest son, John Howe, Jr., married Henrietta Hians. In 1810, John Howe was appointed Justice of the Peace and Justice of the Inferior Court of Common Pleas. On October 9, 1813, his sixth and youngest child from his first marriage, David Howe, married Elizabeth M. Gethens. In 1815, John Howe was given a special commission as Justice \u201cfor the better and more effective administration of the office of Justice of the Peace and for the establishment of an active, vigorous and effectual Police.\u201d John Howe played a role in the establishment of a \u201cHouse of Correction\u201d and improving the police in Halifax by having \u201cthe daily attendance of one Magistrate in some Public Office in Halifax, for managing the Police of the Town.\u201d With his growing duties as a Magistrate and possibly due to a minor stroke, John Howe retired from his offices as King\u2019s Printer and Postmaster in 1818, appointments that were then awarded to his son, John Howe, Jr.\n\nAs mentioned, John Howe was a religious man and a convert to the Sandemanian church. In Halifax, John served as an elder of the Sandemanian church, he served as a lay preacher to the community of 2000 blacks that fled the United States during the War of 1812 and settled in Halifax, and he made regular Sunday visits to the prison to preach to the inmates. He was a practicing pacifist, yet on at least one occasion he knocked together the heads of two young men who were fighting on the Sabbath.\n\nAfter his retirement from his offices of King\u2019s Printer and Postmaster, John Howe continued to be active, serving as a magistrate. In 1822, Sarah Foster Howe, John\u2019s seventh child, married Daniel Langshaw, but in 1824, Sarah Foster (Howe) Langshaw died aboard ship on her way from Liverpool, England, to Lima, Peru, where she was planning to move with her husband. In 1826, John Howe\u2019s sixth child, David Howe, also died. But a happier family event followed on February 2, 1828, when Joseph Howe, John Howe\u2019s youngest child, married Catherine Susan Ann McNab. After this marriage, John Howe helped to produce his son\u2019s, Joseph Howe\u2019s, newspaper together with Joseph\u2019s wife, particularly when Joseph traveled.\n\nHowe was a serving magistrate when his youngest son, Joseph Howe, was charged with criminal libel for printing an anonymous letter that charged that the police and magistrates had embezzled \u00a330,000 from the people of Halifax. Joseph Howe made it clear that his father was not one of the corrupt magistrates when he argued his own defense. Joseph won an acquittal in the case on March 3, 1835, in a victory that was popularly seen as a triumph of freedom of the press and a blow to the corrupt governance of some of the magistrates. Just over eight months after Joseph won his case, but before Joseph had begun his political career, John Howe died in his sleep on December 27, 1835, at 81 years of age. He is buried in the Old Burying Ground."}, {"url": "https://www.sams.ac.uk/people/researchers/howe-professor-john/", "page_content": "SIFIDS .

Howe was a career U.S. Air Force officer who helped establish vital supply and maintenance operations during World War II and the Korean War, ending his career as commander of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.\n\nJohn David Howe was born on July 24, 1906, in Pine Bluff (Jefferson County), the son of Charles D. Howe and Lucy Rowland Howe. The family moved to Hot Springs (Garland County) by 1910 and to Conway (Faulkner County) by 1920, where John studied at Arkansas State Teachers College, now the University of Central Arkansas. Howe enlisted in the 153rd Infantry Regiment of the Arkansas National Guard when he was seventeen, leaving two years later to pursue aviation. By 1929, he was chief pilot for the fledgling Delta Airlines in Monroe, Louisiana, and with nearly 5,000 hours of commercial flying under his belt he joined the Arkansas 154th Observation Squadron, Air Corps, Arkansas National Guard. He was commissioned a second lieutenant on January 11, 1930, and called to active service on August 1, maintaining that status for the next thirty years.\n\nHowe was a captain by 1939, and Army Air Force chief General Hap Arnold selected Howe to form the Fourth Air Depot Group in 1941 at Wright and Patterson Fields in Ohio and Wellson Air Field in Georgia. Howe led the command to Australia in January 1942 and was promoted to major in February as he developed the air depot operation that would supply the Southwest Pacific Theater during World War II. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in late 1942 and transferred to the headquarters of the Air Service Command at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, to establish a training program for maintenance and supply groups that would serve U.S. operations around the world. Promoted to colonel in August 1942, Howe remained in Ohio into 1947, ending his duties at what became Wright-Patterson Air Force Base as assistant chief for field operations and earning the Legion of Merit for his service.\n\nHowe attended the Industrial College of the Armed Services in late 1947 and within a year was serving with the Fifth Air Force in Japan. As the Korean War broke out in June 1950, he was deployed as vice commander of the Air Force\u2019s advance headquarters in Korea, rapidly creating a base of operations for air service operations on the peninsula before setting up a control system to aid coordination between air and ground forces. He was recognized with an Oak Leaf Cluster for his Legion of Merit and a Bronze Star for his efforts in the Korean War, in addition to the Republic of Korea Presidential Citation and the Republic of Korea Ulchi with Gold Star.\n\nHowe became director of maintenance engineering at Headquarters U.S. Air Force in 1951 and received a brigadier general\u2019s star on June 23, 1953. His logistical talents were rewarded with the post of deputy commander of the Sacramento Air Material Area in July 1954, where he oversaw supply distribution in the western United States and the Pacific. On July 1, 1958, he was made commander of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, where he had started his career as a captain back in 1939.\n\nHowe was married twice, first to Kathryn Bradford of Little Rock (Pulaski County), with whom he had a son and a daughter. She died on November 11, 1954, and he married Thelma O\u2019Rear Ritchie in March 1956.\n\nHowe retired from the Air Force in 1960 and moved to Lake Hamilton in Hot Springs, dying there on January 21, 1977. He is buried near his first wife in Old Rosemont Cemetery in Benton (Saline County). He was inducted into the Arkansas Aviation Historical Society Hall of Fame in 1984.\n\nFor additional information:\n\nArkansas Aviation Hall of Fame. https://www.arkavhs.com/arkansas-aviation-hall-of-fame/ (accessed January 16, 2019).\n\n\u201cBrigadier General John D.

Howe was particularly close with his father, who he is reported to have described as \u201cmy only instructor, my play-fellow, almost my daily companion.\u201d Howe was largely self-taught and a voracious reader, though he grew up in relatively poor circumstances and therefore could not afford many books. He was described as a keen observer of the world around him, from which he gleaned part of his knowledge. By age 13, he was assisting his father as postmaster general and King\u2019s printer, though because he was not the eldest son, these responsibilities would not be transferred to him as an adult.\n\nHowe\u2019s father was said to have been the only Loyalist in his family. His love of Britain and the British Empire was conveyed to his son at a very young age and was further enforced and strengthened throughout his life. Despite Howe\u2019s efforts to secure responsible government (i.e., elected legislative government responsible to the local electorate), he was nonetheless a committed champion of the British Empire. (See Imperialism.)\n\nPublishing Career\n\nHowe began his career in publishing in early 1827, when he and a partner purchased a newspaper called the Weekly Chronicle, which they then rechristened as the Acadian. Within the year, Howe took over the publication and became the editor of the Novascotian, which rapidly became the dominant newspaper in the province.\n\nJoseph Howe married Catherine Susan Ann McNab in 1828 and they had ten children together, five of whom survived into adulthood. During his editorship of the Novascotian, Howe regularly reported on the proceedings of the legislature, described his travels throughout the province and discussed what he had learned from the newspapers, journals, pamphlets, correspondence and other periodicals that arrived on his desk. He also published original Nova Scotian literature and regularly included his own poetry.\n\nLibel Trial\n\nOn 1 January 1835, an anonymous letter was published in the Novascotian that alleged local magistrates and police had pocketed \u00a330,000 over three decades from local citizens (essentially through various forms of extortion). Though Howe had not written the letter (and it was signed by \u201cThe People\u201d), he had embarked on a campaign to draw attention to local corruption throughout the previous year, which had annoyed the local political elites. As the publisher and editor of the newspaper, he was charged with seditious libel, a very serious charge at the time. Moreover, Howe couldn\u2019t defend himself by simply arguing what had been reported was the truth, as this was not considered an adequate defence at the time. When no lawyer offered to defend Howe, he chose to defend himself, believing that he could persuade a jury to acquit him.\n\nIt was during his defence that Howe demonstrated the oratorical skills that would make him famous, and eventually lead him into the political arena. Despite the judge instructing the jury to find Howe guilty, Howe had convinced the jury instead to acquit him, a decision they arrived at in no more than 10 minutes. Upon his acquittal, he proclaimed \u201cthe press of Nova Scotia is Free.\u201d Throughout his defence, Howe listed examples of fraud, incompetence and corruption on the part of local politicians, magistrates, police and other officials. Some of those he named resigned in the wake of his monumental acquittal. He would be elected for the first time the following year.\n\nResponsible Government\n\nJoseph Howe was first elected to represent Halifax in the Nova Scotia legislature (House of Assembly) in 1836. He joined the executive council in 1840 and remained in that position until 1843, the year he resigned. During this time, he campaigned for responsible government. The development of responsible government in Canada in the first half of the 19th century paved the way for Confederation in 1867. Thanks to Howe\u2019s efforts, the assemblies elected in 1836 and 1840 had a majority of Reform (pro-responsible government) candidates. This irritated the established political elites, and Howe was challenged to a duel in 1840 by John Halliburton, son of Chief Justice Brenton Halliburton who presided over Howe\u2019s libel trial. Halliburton missed his shot and Howe fired his gun into the air.\n\nHowe took up the role of speaker of the Assembly in 1841, and in the same year, sold the Novascotian, having decided to focus his efforts entirely on politics. He returned to editing both the Novascotian and the Weekly Chronicle from 1844\u201346. Howe was highly critical of Nova Scotia\u2019s lieutenant-governor, Lord Falkland, and this ultimately led to Falkland\u2019s resignation in 1846, which, in turn, allowed for responsible government to take hold in the colony. Though Howe was a major proponent of responsible government, he was not rewarded for the accomplishment, owing at least in part to his very public and antagonistic criticism of those who stood in the way of political reform. As responsible government took hold, Howe worked as provincial secretary to integrate the province\u2019s institutions into the new form of government.\n\nRailways\n\nIn the early 1850s, Joseph Howe was preoccupied with plans to develop new railways, both in Nova Scotia and to connect Halifax with major nearby ports, including Quebec City and Portland, Maine. It took several attempts to secure funding for his railway plan, and in 1854, he resigned his position as provincial secretary to lead a bipartisan railway board. Though his dream was a Quebec City to Halifax line, under his leadership, lines were built only from Halifax to Windsor and Truro, Nova Scotia. Howe viewed railway development as part of a larger master plan for the development of the British Empire, a scheme which involved developing railways to open British North America for the settlement of Britain\u2019s poorest citizens.\n\nIn 1855, he took up the cause of recruiting for the British Army and Royal Navy, then embroiled in the Crimean War. This mission brought him into the United States in search of volunteers and further drew him into conflict with Nova Scotia\u2019s resident Irish population, who opposed the war. Howe\u2019s effort ultimately caused a rift with Catholic voters that toppled the Reform government in 1857.\n\nPremier of Nova Scotia\n\nHowe served as premier of Nova Scotia from 1861\u201363, though his administration was hampered by an insecure majority and the constant attack by his long-time Conservative political rival (and future prime minister), Sir Charles Tupper. Howe accepted the role of leader of the Liberal Party when elected premier William Young was appointed a judge. Howe accepted the invitation to become the Imperial Fisheries Commissioner in 1863, a role he kept until 1866. He contested the 1863 election, but the Liberal Party was soundly defeated, therefore ending his role as premier.\n\nOpposition to Confederation\n\nFrom 1866\u201369, Howe was the leader of anti-Confederation forces in Nova Scotia, and was a prominent voice opposed to Confederation. Howe opposed Confederation in part because he believed the process lacked the involvement of the population at large, and also because it conflicted with his ideal vision for the future of the British Empire (namely that colonial populations would have rights on an equal level with the resident populations of Great Britain). Additionally, Howe was concerned that Confederation would lead to economic ruin for Nova Scotia and a loss of its independence, both of which would appear to come true in the years immediately following 1867.\n\nHowe led a delegation to England in 1866 and 1867 to oppose Confederation. Though he participated in the first dominion parliament, Howe spent February through July of 1868 in England, leading a delegation advocating for the repeal of Confederation. Howe ultimately succeeded in getting a single concession \u2014 a review of fishing, trade and taxation policies and their effects on Nova Scotia \u2014 but British disinterest in North American affairs left Howe severely disillusioned with the empire he once held in highest esteem.\n\nPost-Confederation Politics and Death\n\nHowe abandoned his efforts to repeal Confederation, and rededicated himself to the government of the new dominion. In early 1869, he and a fellow MP reached an agreement with the federal finance minister to secure an improved economic position for the province. By the end of January, he ascended to a Cabinet position as president of the Privy Council. He fought and won a by-election that winter, though it left him in chronic ill health afterwards. In November of 1869, he became secretary of state for the provinces and played a role in welcoming Manitoba into Confederation. (See Manitoba and Confederation.) He was also appointed Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs in December. In May 1873, he became Nova Scotia\u2019s lieutenant-governor, though died in office just three weeks later."}, {"url": "https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/john-h-howe-architect", "page_content": "In 1932 nineteen-year-old John H.

About 1826 he became interested in India rubber, and utilizing his knowledge of chemistry, conducted numerous experiments in an endeavor to produce a practical rubber compound. He was granted a patent on January 31, 1829; gave up his practice, and moved with his family to North Salem, N. Y. There, using all his savings, he erected factory buildings and installed machinery made after his own design, intending to manufacture rubber goods. Within a short time, however, he abandoned the whole project. Concerning this venture, he said, years later, \"So far as I know, I was the first person who attempted to utilize rubber by combining other substances with it, but I did not happen to stumble upon the right substance\" (Bishop, post, II, 563). While in attendance at the Alms House, Howe had become acquainted with the slow and tedious process of making pins by hand, the occupation of many of the inmates, and he was aware that a machine to make pins had been invented in England in 1824. During the winter of 1830-31, in his abandoned rubber factory, he undertook his first serious experiments looking toward the designing of a pin machine and made his first rough model. Having little mechanical experience, he turned for aid in 1832 to Robert Hoe, who was then manufacturing printing presses of his own design. In the course of this year he built in the Hoe establishment a working model of a machine that would make pins \u2013 though in an imperfect way \u2013 and patented the device. The machine was exhibited that year at the American Institute Fair in New York, where Howe received a silver medal \"for a machine for making pins at one operation. \" Financed by his brothers-in-law, Jarvis Brush and Edward Cook of New York, he built a second and better machine in the winter of 1832-33 and then went abroad to obtain foreign patents, which he secured in France, England, Scotland, and Ireland in 1833. After spending another year in England demonstrating his machine and unsuccessfully trying to sell patent rights, he returned to the United States early in 1835, considerably in debt. By the close of the year, however, he had brought about in New York the organization of the Howe Manufacturing Company. He himself was made general agent in charge of manufacture. Within eighteen months five pin machines making \"spun head\" pins were made and put into production. In 1838 the company moved to Birmingham, in the town of Derby, Connecticut, where cheaper water power was available, and a few months later Howe perfected the rotary pin machine on which he had started work while in New York. This machine, patented in 1841, made solid-head pins, and with minor improvements continued in use for over thirty years. One of this type is now in the National Museum, Washington. The designing of a machine to stick pins into paper, next in importance to the perfecting of a pin-making machine, resulted from the joint work of Samuel Slocum, DeGrasse Fowler, and Howe, the latter inventing in 1842 a device to crimp the paper into ridges through which the pins were stuck. With one of his employees, Truman Piper, Howe was joint patentee, June 10, 1856, of a process of japanning pins. After rounding out thirty years of active management of his company, he retired and lived the rest of his life in Birmingham, Connecticut, where he died."}, {"url": "https://www.aere.iastate.edu/alumni/hall-of-distinguished-alumni/", "page_content": "The ultimate measure of any educational institution is reflected in the accomplishments of our graduates.
