{"Riccardo Tisci was born in 1974.": [{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/14/interview-burberry-designer-riccardo-tisci", "page_content": "On the evening I interview Burberry\u2019s chief creative officer Riccardo Tisci, London has an atmosphere close to boiling point. A stone\u2019s throw away from the brand\u2019s HQ, Boris Johnson has just entered 10 Downing Street for the first time, to jeers from protesters. Anti-Brexit demonstrators roam Parliament Square. Commuters on their way home try to manage the late July heatwave, some with ice lollies, others with pints. Some have given up entirely and are just sitting on the pavement, totally frazzled.\n\nFrazzled is not a word that gets much use at the top of Burberry Towers. The rooftop is all members\u2019 club discretion \u2013 bleached wood furniture, bowls of gigantic roses and perfectly chilled, iced sparkling water. The designer has specified this location, where some might have suggested their office, maybe, or a carefully chosen buzzy restaurant. If Burberry is a brand based on a very British weather system of cloudy with a chance of rain, Tisci is different. Born near Lake Como in Italy, he\u2019s accustomed to sunshine.\n\nThis becomes clear when he sits down and launches into his summer plans. \u201cI am going to Como to celebrate my birthday,\u201d he says. \u201cThen Mykonos\u2026 Me and all best friends who live in different countries, we meet there in August. A nice villa in the middle of nowhere\u2026 I love it. If you want to go and eat fish, you go and eat fish; if you want to sleep, you sleep; or if you want to get drunk all together \u2013 it\u2019s nice. The sea, the food, the fish, the tomatoes, everything.\u201d These words tumble out of Tisci\u2019s mouth, and he finishes with a grin, and a sip of the iced coffee he arrived with. Anyone after more of this scenario would do well to join 2.5m others and follow Tisci on Instagram. This year\u2019s destinations include a boat in Ibiza (he is pictured topless, wetsuit pulled down to his waist) and New York for Pride (surrounded by friends, all in hotpants). Or look up his 40th birthday in Ibiza \u2013 a decadent affair with Kate Moss, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Naomi Campbell attending.\n\n\u2018When you do well for yourself in France you get the Chanel bag, in England you get the Burberry trench\u2019. Photograph: Shaniqwa Jarvis/The Guardian\n\nToday, like most days, the gym-honed 45-year-old \u2013 \u201cI am Leo with a moon ascending Gemini\u201d \u2013 wears a black T-shirt of his own design with TB (Thomas Burberry) logo, black basketball shorts and well-worn, even slightly bobbly, black Nike socks with swoosh. He carries a Burberry bumbag with a packet of American Spirit peeking out. If you didn\u2019t know he was a designer, you might think he worked in the music industry.\n\nThis look signals that Tisci is a departure for Burberry. Google Image Christopher Bailey, the previous chief creative officer for 17 years, and you\u2019ll see what I mean. Bailey is much more a crisp shirt and occasional blazer kind of man, the uniform of the discreetly wealthy. Bailey\u2019s collections reflected this taste, too. They often came with a blue-chip British bookish reference \u2013 the Bloomsbury group, say, or David Hockney \u2013 and a BBC Radio 6 Music-approved sound: Paloma Faith, Keane, Jake Bugg. Samantha Cameron and Kate Middleton wore the clothes.\n\nAnd Bailey\u2019s Burberry was successful. Thanks to him, the brand is now Proper Fashion, with the London fashion week show a hot ticket every season. But Bailey\u2019s Burberry was not really cool. Tisci, by contrast, is one of fashion\u2019s current arbiters of that intangible quality. Previously the creative director of Givenchy for 12 years, he designed the wedding outfits for his good friends Kanye and Kim, and has a long-running collaboration with Nike. Madonna, Frank Ocean and Marina Abramovi\u0107 are part of his friendship group (he bought a house with the artist). Since Tisci joined Burberry last year, the brand has worked with MIA (even persuading the edgy musician to appear in the slightly cheesy format of a Christmas advert) and dressed Gen Z favourites Ariana Grande, Rihanna and Gigi Hadid. Such is Tisci\u2019s influence that model Freja Beha Erichsen \u2013 who is Kind of a Big Deal in fashion, with 24 Vogue covers to her name and a starring role in Burberry\u2019s autumn ad campaign \u2013 rejigged her schedule to be part of this shoot.\n\nRiccardo Tisci with his good friends Kanye West and Madonna. Photograph: Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nAt Givenchy, Tisci turned a couture relic most associated with Audrey Hepburn\u2019s LBDs into the height of millennial cool \u2013 specifically appealing to the hypebeast demographic who might also wear streetwear labels Supreme and Palace. Originally known for his gothic aesthetic, streetwear started appearing on the catwalk around 2011. Hypebeasts swiftly signed up \u2013 they loved the T-shirts with a snarling rottweiler print, the basketball vests, the plaid shirt with studs. And at around \u00a3360 for one of those T-shirts, they were within reach \u2013 more affordable than a four-figure gown, anyway. This was part of the strategy \u2013 that, and his duties as a good uncle. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go home for Christmas and have my sisters\u2019 kids say, \u2018It\u2019s beautiful, what you do, but I can\u2019t afford it,\u2019\u201d Tisci explains. \u201cThat killed me. I wanted them to come to me and say, \u2018I have been saving money to buy the Bambi T-shirt.\u2019\n\n\u201c[At first], nobody was caring about it. Slowly but slowly, it was selling, selling, getting bigger,\u201d Tisci continues. \u201c[Then] everybody wants a piece and everybody starts doing it. I don\u2019t mind it because whenever the younger generation talk about that, they always mention my name.\u201d Tisci\u2019s success meant high street brands started producing their own take. You might not know his name but he is the reason you have a statement sweatshirt, the reason the phrase \u201cposh tracksuit trousers\u201d is not an oxymoron.\n\nReworking the check. Tisci\u2019s Burberry designs bring the classic to the radar of a new generation.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that Tisci is intrigued by a part of Burberry\u2019s history that was, until now, a touchy subject: its association with \u201cchav\u201d culture. In 2002, actor Danniella Westbrook was snapped in a Burberry check skirt with matching handbag. Her daughter wore a matching kilt, and sat in a Burberry check pushchair. The label was also spotted on football terraces. By being associated with the working-classes, the luxury brand was seen as losing its way. While check had already been reintroduced by Bailey, with a 2018 collaboration with streetwear designer Gosha Rubchinskiy, Tisci has reassessed the idea of \u201cchav\u201d. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t say it, but last season it was a little bit the inspiration,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it is great because I come from the streets.\u201d The AW collection, entitled Tempest, included streetwear, sophisticated classics and that oh-so-familiar check, reworked with a darker khaki and the punchy graphics that Tisci fans flock to.\n\nDesigners from humble backgrounds are nothing new \u2013 Alexander McQueen, Vivienne Westwood, Bailey himself - but Tisci has a genuine rags to riches story. Born in 1974, he grew up the youngest child \u2013 and only boy \u2013 of nine children. He wore his sisters\u2019 pink hand-me-downs to school. His father died when Tisci was four and the siblings had to work to keep the family afloat. He has spoken before about one meal a day being the norm, how he was helping his uncle with plastering from the age of 11. It\u2019s all a long way from rooftops with a view of the Houses of Parliament.\n\nTisci\u2019s unlikely success is, he says, down to \u201cangels I have crossed in my life\u201d. The first arrived when he stopped attending primary school. \u201cThe teachers came to my house, Miss Besio and Mr Borriero. They said to my mum, \u2018Your son needs to study because he has something different to all the other children.\u2019\u201d Tisci stayed in school. This continued in London \u2013 on an internship, fellow designer Antonio Berardi saw his illustrations and sent Tisci to renowned fashion college Central Saint Martins. While there, tutor Willie Walters ensured he received a grant so he was able to study. Tisci was made creative director of Givenchy in 2005, aged 29. \u201cI am a self-made person,\u201d he says now, with a drag of an American Spirit. \u201cMy mum gave me love but that is the only thing she gave me.\u201d (Tisci is prone to these telenovela-ish soundbites, which is understandable when you find out he has a story worthy of a box set.)\n\nRihanna wears a Burberry trench on stage at a Fenty Beauty event. Photograph: Mark Ganzon/Getty\n\nTisci sees a kindred spirit in Thomas Burberry, who started the eponymous brand in 1856, at the age of 21, in the far from fashionable environs of Basingstoke. He invented gabardine, the waterproof fabric that went on to be used for the trenchcoat, in 1879. Adopted by explorers and intrepid types including Ernest Shackleton and Betty Kirby-Green, Burberry trenches were worn in the trenches in the first world war. By 1965, it\u2019s said that one in every five coats exported from the UK was made by Burberry. These days, the brand employs around 10,000 people and is the only luxury fashion brand in the FTSE 100. It also looms large in British style. In the time I have been working on this interview, I have seen Tisci-designed Burberry tote bags on the tube, the check on a woman\u2019s scarf in the supermarket, a trench, with rolled-up check sleeves, in a cocktail bar.\n\nTisci says Thomas is central to his reworking of Burberry, so much so that he changed the Burberry logo \u2013 with the help of Peter Saville \u2013 to feature the founder\u2019s initials. \u201cThe company should still be an institution but at the same time we need to have the perception of human,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a business company.\u201d That may seem a bit soppy to any board members reading this, but his nose for hits is well-known \u2013 Burberry\u2019s share price went up 5% when his appointment was announced. There\u2019s still work to do, though: even after a 4% rise in sales, analysts at the Bernstein Group downgraded Burberry to \u201cunderperform\u201d in August.\n\nTisci\u2019s track record for courting millennials suggests this is just a blip. He\u2019s started Burberry\u2019s B Series which plays into the \u201cdrop\u201d culture of streetwear \u2013 a new product is released on the 17th of each month (August\u2019s was a dog hoodie, personalisable with the lucky pooch\u2019s name), and reliably sells out in minutes. Another addition is T-shirts, scarves and bags covered in unicorns. If that sounds like a cynical ploy to appeal to fans of emojis and pool inflatables, the story has the authenticity this cohort highly prizes. A search of the archive revealed an alternative insignia from the brand\u2019s famous knight \u2013 a unicorn, designed by Burberry for his family. \u201cIn the day it was a horse, in the night it became a unicorn,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cI thought it was a very beautiful thing. In a way, it\u2019s very relatable to what happened in my life\u2026 My sisters were like Thomas Burberry. During the day, they have to be strong warriors, but in the night they would take off all this armour and be very sweet mothers to me.\u201d\n\nFamily comes first for Tisci. He remains very close to his mother, who is now 90. His formative experiences of fashion came from watching his eight sisters \u2013 who, he says, are four pairs of best friends \u2013 get ready to go out, when he was a child. \u201cThey would be in the bathroom, putting makeup on. I was sitting on the bathtub thinking, one day I can go out and meet the people around the world.\u201d\n\nTisci has said before that he took the Givenchy job so he could buy his mother a house. His break with the brand was also prompted by family \u2013 at the funeral of his brother-in-law in 2016, he realised his mother was getting older, his nieces and nephews were growing up. And he wanted in. \u201cI wanted to be the son of my mother, the brother of my sister, that I have never been really because life never gave me the opportunity,\u201d he says. He quit Givenchy the following spring. The announcement went out while he was in a desert in Algeria, with his phone switched off.\n\nSitting back. Model Freja Beha Erichsen wearing Burberry. Photograph: Shaniqwa Jarvis/The Guardian\n\nThe next year was low-key. He had, he says, \u201cno agenda\u201d. \u201cLike anyone when you are busy, you have a PA, a PR,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes you want to go to buy your toothpaste, you want to discover what is the new cream for your skin, not always have somebody going for you.\u201d He slept a lot and he travelled, going to Portugal with his family and backpacking around Costa Rica. That is, until Burberry called. Tisci was brought back to fashion by the man who brought him into it in the first place \u2013 Marco Gobbetti, now CEO of Burberry (with an annual salary of \u00a37.3m, as was recently revealed), but then at Givenchy. \u201cMarco is the person who saved my career and gave me the opportunity to be who I am today,\u201d Tisci says, with that frisson of drama. The trench was also enticing. \u201cWhen you behave well at school, in France you get the Chanel bag,\u201d he says. \u201cIn England you get the Burberry trench. It\u2019s something I discovered here. Adele told me the first thing she bought when her first single came out was a Burberry trench.\u201d Tisci\u2019s first collection for Burberry featured 20 trenches.\n\nBut will the perception of a brand \u2013 and an item \u2013 so associated with Britishness change post-Brexit? \u201cBritish is not my culture but I am representing a very important British house,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cFor me to celebrate Britishness and bring it to America, China, it\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\nI would guess Tisci was Remain \u2013 inclusivity and diversity are his MO. He championed casting people of colour well before the rest of fashion woke up to the idea. He also cast his friend Lea T, a trans woman, in an ad campaign in 2010, helping her financially and opening the door to models such as Hari Nef, Andreja Pejic and Nathan Westling. \u201cI got so much shit. You cannot imagine,\u201d he says. \u201cThank God we had people like Oprah Winfrey who said, \u2018Stop a second, he is doing something that is right.\u2019 When somebody more powerful says something, it changes.\u201d Family Tisci were a support network, too. \u201cWhen she [Lea T] decided to become a woman and her family didn\u2019t accept her, my mum took her to our house and she lived with us,\u201d he says. \u201cShe treated Lea as a daughter. Lea still says, \u2018Your mum is the first person to call me she, not he.\u2019\u201d\n\nTisci is definitely an ally to a socially aware generation (Burberry\u2019s policy of burning clothes and its use of fur ended soon after he joined). But he doesn\u2019t always get it right. There was a skirmish after the autumn show when model Liz Kennedy compared the fastening on a hoodie to a noose on social media. \u201cSuicide is not fashion,\u201d she wrote. \u201cRiccardo Tisci and everyone at Burberry it is beyond me how you could let a look resembling a noose hanging from a neck out on the runway.\u201d While other brands have seen items that cause offence reach stores \u2013 both Gucci and Prada have had scandals around designs with racist imagery \u2013 this was swiftly shut down. In a statement, Tisci said, \u201cIt does not reflect my values nor Burberry\u2019s and we have removed it from the collection.\u201d\n\nThe good ship Burberry: Tisci brings a twist to Burberry\u2019s heritage with graphic prints and a new logo. Photograph: Shaniqwa Jarvis/The Guardian\n\nWhile Tisci says he isn\u2019t a political person, he does concede he has a platform. \u201cIf it\u2019s to fight for rights, to help people, I am the first one,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it\u2019s about going to sit at a table and talk about money, numbers and power, that is, like you say here, not my cup of tea.\u201d\n\nNow back in London for over a year, Tisci lives in Mayfair (he did consider Marylebone, where his friend Madonna has a house), trains every day in a local gym and watches what he eats. Then, once in a while, he lets himself go. Tisci has gone to raves, festivals \u2013 \u201cI never thought I would be a festival person\u201d \u2013 and gigs: Rosal\u00eda, the buzzy Spanish singer, Bj\u00f6rk, Primal Scream. The evening we speak, he is having drinks with singer Dua Lipa. Next up, his birthday, celebrated quietly with family. I\u2019m not taking his word for it \u2013 it\u2019s all documented on Instagram a few days later. The designer looks content, lake in the background, Aperol spritz on the table, surrounded by his sisters and mother.

He is the youngest child of nine, the only boy among eight sisters. While his childhood was a happy one, money was scarce. \u201cI\u2019m talking poor,\u201d he recalled in a 2012 interview, \u201clike eat-basically-once-a-day poor.\u201d\n\n1978\n\nTisci\u2019s father passes away when he\u2019s four, and the family relocates to Cermante, a small town in Lombardy, Northern Italy.

He later studies art at the Istituto d\u2019Arte in Cant\u00f9.\n\n1991\n\nAt 17, he leaves for London, where he works in hotels and shops. \u201cSometimes when I look back, I think \u2018Wow, how can I have done that when I was 17?,\u2019\u201d he said in a 2013 interview. The experience energises him, and he builds a bond with the city. \u201cThe moment I put feet in London, I know this is going to be the chance of my life,\u201d Tisci told Vogue in 2012.\n\n1993\n\nTisci sees an advertisement for the London College of Fashion on the tube, and enrols for a foundation class. His tutor, Priyesh Shah, spots his talent and arranges an internship with Antonio Berardi, who encourages him to apply to the prestigious Central Saint Martins in London. Tisci wins a scholarship and is invited to skip his first year \u2013 which makes him unpopular with fellow students. \u201cI was most hated,\u201d he reflected in 2015. \u201cThey broke down my locker.

He sells his graduate collection to London boutique Kokon To Zai and Bj\u00f6rk is one of his first clients.\n\n2004\n\nAfter working for Puma and Coccapani, Tisci signs a three-year contract as creative director of Ruffo Research, the house that launched Antonio Berardi, Sophia Kokosalaki and Haider Ackermann. The line abruptly folds in July 2004, and Tisci moves to India to begin work on his own brand. His debut collection, presented in an abandoned factory off-schedule during Milan Fashion Week, is rich in gothic and religious references, a recurring theme in his work. Vogue\u2019s Sarah Mower calls him \u201cclearly a name worth watching\u201d.\n\n2005\n\nOn February 28, 2005, Marco Gobbetti, then the chief executive of Givenchy, appoints Tisci creative director of the house for haute couture, pret-a-porter and accessories. \u201cI wasn\u2019t interested,\u201d Tisci said of being approached for the job, but when his mother told him she needed to sell her house to support his sisters, he changed his mind. \u201cThey showed me a contract with all these zeros on it, and it was like help from God.\u201d\n\nIn July, he presents his first collection for Givenchy haute couture. \u201cHis debut, staged tableau vivant-style at Givenchy, was chaotic and poorly organized, and a number of editors wanted to put the nice-looking Mr. Tisci over their knee and spank him,\u201d Cathy Horyn wrote at the time. \u201cBut of 29 outfits there were three or four that suggested Mr. Tisci has a modernist vision, and three or four is enough.\u201d\n\n2008\n\nTisci is named creative director of Givenchy menswear and accessories. The designer also produces the costumes for Madonna\u2019s Sticky and Sweet tour, one of their first collaborations.

Lea went on Oprah Winfrey, she was on television all over the world, and people fell in love with her. And, now, a transsexual has been on the cover of Time magazine.\u201d\n\n2011\n\nDuring his Autumn/Winter 2011 menswear show, Tisci sends models wearing shirts, sweaters and shorts emblazoned with images of growling Rottweilers down the catwalk. An instant street style hit, the designer continues to develop signature prints in his future collections, including black panthers, floral extravaganzas and the Bambi print of 2013.\n\n2012\n\nGivenchy announces it will no longer show haute couture, but will continue creating one-off couture looks for clients and special events. On the red carpet, Tisci continues to dress A-list stars, including Beyonce and Cate Blanchett.\n\n2013\n\nTisci wins the CFDA International Award for his work at Givenchy. He also produces the costumes for the Ballet de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra de Paris\u2019 Bolero, explaining that \u201cthese costumes express two different sides of my personality: darkness and romanticism.\u201d\n\n2014\n\nKanye West, Kim Kardashian and North West wear Givenchy by Tisci on the couple\u2019s wedding day.

Aged 17, Tisci moved to London to attend Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design. After graduating in 1999, Tisci returned to Italy and started working for a number of companies including Puma, Missoni, Justin Oh and Coccapani. Tisci then embarked on a three year contract with Ruffo Research \u2013 a business that collaborated with young designers.\n\nIn 2004, once Tisci\u2019s contract was over, he started to develop his own collection. Tisci showed his designs in Milan Fashion Week autumn/winter 05/06 the following year. Shortly after Tisci showcased his work, he was offered the Creative Director role at Givenchy.\n\nWanting to focus on his own designs and label, Tisci was initially unsure whether to accept the position. But after financial problems for his family, Tisci accepted Givenchy\u2019s offer. On February 28th, 2005, Ricardo Tisci became Creative Director of the Haute Couture, ready-to-wear and accessories lines at Givenchy following in the footsteps of John Galliano, Alexander McQueen and replacing Julien Macdonald.\n\nTisci saw success at Givenchy, especially with haute couture line, raising their customer base from five to 29.\n\nIn 2008, Tisci designed Madonna\u2019s costumes for her \u2018Sticky & Sweet Tour\u2019 under the Givenchy label. The same year Tisci was asked to curate an issue of A magazine.\n\nTisci caused a stir in 2010, when he cast the first transgender model to appear in a catwalk show. The Brazilian transsexual named Lea T had worked with Tisci for years, previously his personal assistant.

She\u2019s part of the family\u2019.\n\nKnown for revitalizing the Givenchy brand, Ricardo Tisci\u2019s style is romantic with a dark aesthetic. After speculation he would leave Givenchy for Dior, Tisci remains with Givenchy and his modern, religion inspired, romanticised designs.\n\nRiccardo Tisci biography"}, {"url": "https://www.famousfashiondesigners.org/riccardo-tisci", "page_content": "Riccardo Tisci is an Italian designer from Taranto, who was born in 1974. He graduated from Central Saint Martin\u2019s Academy in 1999, London, after studying in Italy. The city of his birthplace is tied to mythological stories of marines and mermaids, that acted as an inspiration in designs he created for Givenchy haute couture and ready-to-wear. After graduation, Tisci worked for a series of companies such as Coccapani and Puma prior to signing a three year agreement with Ruffo Research, which initiated the careers of many fashion designers including Sophia Kokosalaki. In 2004, when the contract expired, he started working on his personal collection, that he exhibited in 2005 and 2006 Fall Milan Fashion Week.\n\nBefore long, he was appointed as the creative director at Givenchy in 2005. This was an offer he had almost turned down since his original idea was to focus on his own fashion collection. However, when the designer found out about his mother selling the house for a personal problem related to his sisters and their new family life, he accepted the company\u2019s offer and was content with his salary. Marco Gobbetti of Givenchy described Tisci as a perfect fit for the label because the designer has an elegance that is highly contemporary, modern and romantic simultaneously. Unlike the many designers who have succeeded Hubert de Givenchy, Tisci has received immense success, both financially and critically, specially in the sphere of haute couture.

In May 2008 he was additionally named as menswear and accessories designer of the Givenchy men's division. In March 2018, it was announced he had been appointed chief creative officer of Burberry, succeeding Christopher Bailey.\n\nTisci's apparent fascination with Gothic touches (dark, languid dresses for fall couture) and space-age minimalism (one ready-to-wear show featured white-clad models drifting around a sterile-white sphere) has drawn new attention to the Givenchy brand. Reviews and output so far have been mixed and inconsistent, but many, including influential fashion critics (such as Cathy Horyn of The New York Times and Suzy Menkes of the International Herald Tribune) have honed in on Tisci's conceptual leanings, as well as his future potential for revitalizing the Givenchy brand and infusing it with his precision and imagination.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nTisci was born in Taranto and raised in Como.

It's element is fire; it is hot and dry, it governs Leo, is in exaltation in Aries and is in analogy with the heart. It represents the boss, authority, beside the father and the husband ; the age of the Sun goes from 20 years old to about 40, following the Venus age when one is aware of his seductive power. Temperament: Bilious Characterology: Emotive, Active, Secondary, passionate type. For more information, see the page dedicated to the Sun. Sun in Leo You display a firm will and a certain nobleness of heart. You make use of, and sometimes, you abuse of your persuasion powers in your efforts to project a brilliant image of yourself. Your generosity is unlimited towards the people who do not antagonize your beliefs. But you do not accept to be contradicted, and you do not tolerate errors and defeats. You are sensitive to power struggles and you strive to keep your image and your panache free from all stain. No one can step on your toes! Leo is ambitious and he does not rest until the exhibited power he conquered is fully respected. Therefore, you properly fulfil the responsibilities you are entrusted with, but above all, you make it a point of honour to show that you are up to any situation. Whenever you have the opportunity to prove yourself in your activity, your fighting spirit, votre majestic persuasion powers and your conquering mind are amazing. You need to wield power. It is indispensable for you to feel comfortable and to be at your best. Leo must be cautious not to mistake his territory with that of his neighbour! The respect for borders - affective, social and professional - can spare you the delusions and the backlashes inherent to the love for power. If this condition is met, individual legitimate ambition becomes a source of creativity. Sun Dominant If the Sun is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Solarian: you loathe pettiness and Machiavellian manoeuvre, and you are fond of natural nobleness as well as of direct and honest attitudes. You endeavour to get out of muddled or dark situations as quickly as possible. Your need for transparency may lead you to make cut-and-dried judgments such as yes or no, and black or white. However, your honesty commands your entourage's consideration. At times, you come across as authoritarian. It is true that you never want to be thought of the notable absentee, and that you manage to make people pay attention to you, as well as to your plans and your assessments. To this end, the Solarian sometimes develops a great talent for placing himself under the spotlight without missing a single opportunity to arouse interest. Some other Solarians, although more discreet, still manage to be the focus of any debate, even in situations of exclusion. It is your way of being present even though you are actually not there... More than other people, you appreciate the esteem extended to you. It is useless to cheat with you, since in all areas you consider establishing enduring relationships only with those who love you, admire you, respect you, or express some degree of affection to you. Your will to straighten out your inter-personal relationships is your strength and sometimes, your Achilles' heel. You cannot achieve anything behind the scenes. Therefore, your comportment is marked with heroism, and your stands are devoid of ambiguity, in the sense that your commitments are unfailing, and your rebuffs, final. Interpretation of the 8\u00b0 Leo symbolic degree \"A peacock spreads its tail as it follows a nobleman in a ceremonial dress. In the background, there is a castle with its gardens and terraces.\" (Janduz version) Conceited, materialistic, and superficial character tinged with a streak of snobbery. The family comes from a high social layer. One has very good tastes but also an irrepressible propensity to ostentation. Excessive importance is paid to appearances, and much money is wasted in showing off one's worldly possessions. One has no concern whatsoever for the essential things of life. Whether one's fortune is inherited or earned by oneself, one enjoys happiness among one's fellow creatures. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology.

For a man, she represents his mother and later his wife, and his relationship with women in general. For a woman, the Moon is almost as important as the Sun and the Ascendant. Her element is water, she is cold and moist, she rules Cancer, is in exaltation in Taurus and is in analogy with the stomach. She symbolizes the mother, wife, the crowd, the Moon is associated with birth and childhood. Tradition also matches her with the end of life, after Saturn the old age, it is thus customary to go back to one's place of birth to die: the end of life meets the very beginning.

For more information, see the page dedicated to the Moon. Moon in Capricorn On the day and at the time of your birth, the Moon was in the sign of Capricorn. In your private sphere and your daily rhythms, you give precedence to moderation and reserve over the untimely excesses of your imagination. Your nature is more contemplative than excited and your deep sensitivity is controlled. It is probably the reason why you are sometimes criticized for your coldness. An ivory tower protects your fragile sensitivity. Your lunar sign belongs to a zodiacal axis (Cancer-Capricorn) that is particularly selective and self-protective: your close friends are handpicked and carefully chosen for their natural affinities with your personal realm. The external world is often disturbing. Therefore, you must create an enclosed environment where your fragile sensitivity can freely blossom. The only danger may be that you imprison your life rhythms in immutable rites and in a simplistic daily ceremonial. With more flexible intimate behaviours, your sensitivity can be fully expressed and the absolute harmony you dream of can be achieved. Moon Dominant If the Moon is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Lunarian: the driving force behind your actions is mainly the pursuit of well-being and tranquillity. Your sensitive and romantic self lives on those periods of rest during which you let your imagination wander at will. This is your way of finding inspiration and balance. Nothing is allowed to disturb your feeling of fulfilment and security within a harmonious cell, be it a family or a clan. More than other people, the Lunarian is attached to those moments during which one forgets one's worries and lets oneself cast adrift aimlessly, with no other goal than to be lulled into an ambiance, a situation, or a perfect moment. Many people do not understand such absences and their meaning, which is to regain strength. These people readily describe you with such unflattering terms as apathy and nonchalance. Never mind! Some inspirations require surrendering as well as striking a balance derived from alternate action and passivity. Your qualities are expressed to the fullest in situations which demand familiarity and privacy. Your capacities to respect and blend into your environment is at least as valuable as some other people's aggressive dispositions. However, you are well-advised to avoid indolence and renunciation out of laziness or indifference. Interpretation of the 19\u00b0 Capricorn symbolic degree \"A monkey wearing jewels looks at itself in the mirror. In its back, another monkey makes funny faces.\" (Janduz version) Conceited, superficial, and shrewd character endowed with great talents for mimicry. One achieves success in fashion or in any occupation in the entertainment industry. The financial situation may not be stable, and therefore, it is wise to put some savings aside in order to cope with lean periods. This degree also describes unreliable employees.

Temperament: Nervous Characterology: Emotive, non Active and Primary type or Non-Emotive, Active and Primary, Nervous or Sanguine type. For more information, see the page dedicated to Mercury. Mercury in Cancer Mercury describes your relations, your communication skills and the way you relate to the external world. However, other astrological elements also influence these areas. The sign Mercury occupies is significant only if Mercury is part of your planetary dominantes. In your chart, Mercury is in Cancer. Your intellect and your sensitivity are indissociable. Your behaviours are influenced by ambiances and by emotions aroused as you contact other people. You assimilate through feelings and images. Communication means exchanging your perceptions and conveying emotions. To be able to follow you and to understand you, a strong sensitivity is required: hence, your selectivity regarding your relationships. Mercury Dominant If Mercury is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Mercurian: the tradition points out the importance of communication. From idle but enriching chatters to observation gift, such a dominant endows you with a wide range of expression. Human beings have one thousand facets and one thousand masks they wear according to circumstances and the fortunes of the game of life. You take the role of an observer who is avid for novelties, discoveries, and surprises. Everything catches your attention and becomes an opportunity for new encounters, relationships, and learning. The world amazes you, amuses you sometimes, and stimulates your curiosity. Because the most important thing is to discover, and because you consider that each new situation is packed with potentialities, you try to fill the gaps in your knowledge. Although your open-mindedness may scatter your centres of interest, it also enables you to carefully avoid sticking to only one immutable and rigid view. The slightest sign enables you to perceive the other side of the coin, as well as the infinite complexity of people and of situations. On the human plane, you seek the dialogue and the information without which you know that you are not able to fully grasp the nature of your interlocutor. This keen interest in the Unknown sharpens your inter-relational skills. All these qualities are traditionally associated with Mercury. Interpretation of the 22\u00b0 Cancer symbolic degree \"A man sleeps in a field, in broad daylight, near another man who yawns and stretches himself, while two marauders steal their working tools.\" (Janduz version) Carefree, neglectful, and lazy character. Nevertheless, owing to sheer good luck, brilliant success and happiness are achieved around mid-life. One must then put up every effort in order to make them last, because otherwise, one is most likely to end up in poverty and loneliness.

For men, she also corresponds to the kind of woman he's attracted to (but not especially in marriage which is more symbolized by the Moon, Venus is the lover and not the wife). Her element is the Air, she is moist, rules Taurus and Libra, is in exaltation in Pisces and is in analogy with the kidneys, the venous system, the bladder, the neck. She represents the artists, tradesmen, occupations linked to beauty and charm; the age of Venus goes from 15 to about 25 years old. Temperament: Sanguine and Lymphatic Characterology: Emotive, non Active and Primary type or Emotive, non Active and Secondary type. For more information, see the page dedicated to Venus. Venus in Cancer Venus describes your affective life. On the day of your birth, she is found in Cancer. Emotions and sensations are indissociable from your imagination, your dreams and your inner life. There is something romantic and fabulous in the way you experience love. You can really feel passion only within a subtle, refined and quite mysterious relationship. In love, your imagination has unlimited powers. Tenderness is the key to your sentimental fulfilment. You dread violent passions and storms and you strive to fulfil your needs for gentleness and harmony. For you, love is a refuge. You treasure the security of your couple cell and you protect the intimacy and the secrets of your relationship. Feelings make you dream... Your affectivity is romantic and whimsical. Whims are of course the indispensable ingredients of your sentimental life, its salt and sugar. However, you may pour too much salt in your affectivity! Imagination may be tricky. You become the victim of your mood swings and strange desires overwhelm your thoughts. Your romantic sensitivity requires its fair share of dreams and mystery. Better than anyone, you create an atmosphere of sweet intimacy, which is the basis of a fulfilled love relationship, even, and above all, in the everyday life. Venus Dominant If Venus is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Venusian: you are a sensual and emotional person particularly receptive to the natural likes and dislikes aroused by your contact with people. You are prone to frequent instinctive aversions and true passions which are exclusively driven by the feeling of love. The heart has its reasons which Reason knows nothing of... Your balance is based on the richness of your affective life. Without love, the Venusian is resourceless, lost, and deprived of any reason for living. You have an obvious and strong will to charm and to arouse the attachments without which you cannot properly function. Every area of your life is thus marked by your affectivity. The danger is that you may \"be taken in\" by charm. In such cases, you would prefer to keep your emotions under better control. Thus, hyper-sensitivity has its own inconveniences. Nevertheless, better than anyone else, you know how to play with feelings and attractions. Although you are sometimes caught in the traps of an over sensitive emotionalism, feelings remain your best assets in many circumstances. There is another aspect to the Venusian dominant. According to the Tradition, this planet rules the Arts, and you are endowed with some degree of artistic dispositions, ranging from good to excellent. Interpretation of the 13\u00b0 Cancer symbolic degree \"A star shines brightly over a bed of flowers and a lamb wearing a crown adorned with a star.\" (Janduz version) Intelligent, serious, and determined character. One has a keen interest in plants, precious gems and metal, and in all matters related to astronomy and space, including rockets and spaceships. If the family belongs to a high social layer, one perpetuates the tradition and increases the inherited wealth. If of modest origins, one distinguishes oneself through one's work and earns a brilliant reputation. In both cases, one achieves wealth and success, probably owing to a precocious marriage. Travels and education are very favoured. If in the natal chart, the Midheaven is in conjunction with this degree, all the good omens are strengthened. With the Imum Coeli, it heralds dangers linked to water. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology.

For a woman, Mars corresponds to the kind of man she's attracted to (but not especially in marriage which is rather symbolized by the Sun, Mars is the lover, not the husband). Fire is its element, it is hot and dry, and it rules Aries and Scorpio (along with Pluto), is in exaltation with Capricorn and is in analogy with the muscles and the spleen. It represents the soldiers, sportsmen, warriors, surgeons, blacksmiths... ; the age of Mars goes from 42 to 50 years old. Temperament: Bilious Characterology: Emotive, Active, Primary type. It is a Choleric. For more information, see the page dedicated to Mars. Mars in Virgo The planet Mars indicates how you react to life concrete stimulations. It also describes your fighting spirit, your abilities to stand for yourself and to take action. With Mars in Virgo, you strive to control your emotions and to reduce your field of activity in order to keep a maximal level of efficiency in your actions. When you commit yourself into something, you display a strong ingenuity and resourcefulness and you intervene at the right time. Your actions are as efficient as they are discreet. You may not feel comfortable when the situation you face is not logical. The whims of fate are not your allies: but you analyze properly more stable situations and you handle them methodically well. You seldom take inconsiderate actions and you prefer to take the time to weigh up the pros and the cons before undertaking anything. Your entourage may see your reserve and your restraint as a lack of boldness. Mars Dominant If Mars is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Marsian: in your hand-to-hand struggle for life, you demonstrate an acute and active sense of confrontation with the world, with other people, and with your own destiny. You need to take action and to fight for your projects and your desires. You perceive all situations with deep intensity, and you react to the here and now without bothering to step back in order to ensure that events are under your control. You take up challenges with excessive foolhardiness as a consequence of your impulsiveness. However, better than anyone else, you know how to mobilise your resources in case of crisis. You take action whenever it is necessary to do so, and you are present in a timely manner. With Mars, your attitudes are dictated by the realities of the moment, by your emotions, and by everything which proved to have worked in the past. When this dominant is not well integrated, it may bring about an aggressive or impulsive behaviour. Therefore, you must learn to control your hyper-sensitivity and your fits of temper. You are also endowed with Marsian qualities: the fighting spirit and the taste for duel without which one may find oneself overwhelmed by events. When this willpower is well channelled, its precious energy enables to cope with all sorts of contingencies. There are a thousand ways to win, and a thousand challenges to take up with the enthusiasm and the dynamism which make life so worthy. A certain idea of life which is wild, passionate, and in tune with events. Interpretation of the 3\u00b0 Virgo symbolic degree \"A young man tills the soil with a plough and a pair of oxen. As he ages, he enjoys watching the wheat ripening.\" (Janduz version) Simple and pragmatic character. Success can be achieved in agriculture or animal husbandry. Life is meaningful and happy, and old age unfolds in affluence and serenity. If the origins are modest, one is very likely to improve one's social status and purchase realties.

Temperament: Sanguine Characterology: Emotive, Active, Primary type; it is an extrovert Choleric. Actually the humid version of Mars, inclined to action like him. For more information, see the page dedicated to Jupiter. Jupiter in Pisces The planet Jupiter symbolizes expansion, broadness and generosity. Jupiter is associated with the functions of synthesis, enthusiasm and optimism. In your natal chart, his house position is more important than his sign position because, like Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Jupiter in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. Jupiter in Pisces increases your natural generosity and your dedication capacity. Your empathy is strong and you are inclined to offer your strength and your enthusiasm to the most deprived people and to give unlimited assistance to others. Your imagination is powerful and your feelings may flare up easily: with your sensitivity on the alert and your unbridled affectivity, you belong to the category of people who intuitively detect other people's sufferings and most valuable qualities of the heart, as if you were a human radar. Jupiter Dominant If Jupiter is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Jupiterian: because this planet brings about a keen interest in social and professional success, the Tradition considers it to be beneficial. Indeed, you know how to adjust to events and to jump at the chance when it arises. The members of your entourage gladly entrust you with high responsibilities because they are often impressed by your learning skills and your adaptation abilities as you deal with new structures and new languages. What is the secret of your good star? It is your self-confidence which wins public support. Now, what is the secret of your charm? Definitely, enthusiasm, euphoria, and exaltation. Exaggeration also. When this dominant is well integrated, it is a factor of affluence and optimism, and a certain degree of joviality enables you to easily fit into various spheres. It constitutes your main asset to manage your life. However, you must at times curb your desire for integration, lest your sense of opportunity turns into extreme opportunism. Here also, the key to success lies in a correct estimate of everyone's chances and possibilities. Although management is one of your forte, and you can adjust your objectives to current realities better than other people, you lack the hindsight which enables you to avoid short-term vagaries and daily fluctuations. If you strive too much to adapt, you run a risk of betraying yourself. This is the other traditional side of the coin with \"The Greater Benefic\"! Interpretation of the 16\u00b0 Pisces symbolic degree \"A man falling off a bridge calls for help, while another man throws himself into the river to commit suicide.\" (Janduz version) Pessimistic, misanthropic, and withdrawn character. Instead of shutting oneself away in an ivory tower, one ought to seek the company of cheerful and devoted friends. In the professional area, partnerships must be given priority because they can offset the threat of bankruptcy portended by this degree and ensure a decent standard of living. Dangers come from depressive tendencies and from water. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology.

Saturn in Cancer The planet Saturn symbolizes contraction, effort, time, limitation and concentration. Saturn eliminates anything that is not authentic, sooner or later. It is impossible to cheat him as he gives an irresistible desire to form a coherent whole with oneself, in responsible and wise ways. He is the great purifier. He represents our limitations but also our truth. In your natal chart, the house position where Saturn is posited is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Saturn in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. Saturn in Cancer decreases your emotionalism. You are less vulnerable as you build a protective carapace, with all the good and the bad consequences that may be implied. You are provident and wise in the family and real estate areas, may be a bit too much. Saturn Dominant If Saturn is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Saturnian: you gladly leave to other people the decision to take life as it comes. As far as you are concerned, you prefer to take advantage of your experiences in order to discover, to grow, and to question yourself. Interpretation of the 12\u00b0 Cancer symbolic degree \"Behind shrubberies, a man carries a lamb on his shoulders. A dagger and a chopped head are half-hidden under a nearby rock.\" (Janduz version) Introverted, melancholic, and irascible character. If intelligence and willpower can overcome instincts of violence, oppression, and cruelty, then one can expect fame, honours, and wealth.

Temperament: Nervous to the extreme Characterology: Emotive, Active, Secondary type; it is a Passionate type. For more information, see the page dedicated to Uranus. Uranus in Libra The planet Uranus symbolizes originality, independence and cerebral energy bursting suddenly. Uranus triggers the irresistible need for freedom that we have in ourselves. Uranus tends to break the constraints that have become unbearable and gives us the courage and the will to get rid of what has become a burden; when he is well aspected, he also indicates genius. In your natal chart, Uranus' house position is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Uranus in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. The sign positions of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto have a collective meaning. They do not influence your personality, unless they are involved in numerous aspects or when they emphasize a personal point of your natal chart such as your Ascendant's ruler, an angular planet, i.e. a planet near the Ascendant, the Midheaven, the Nadir or the Descendant. In such cases, the activity of the slow planet is very highlighted. Uranus in Libra may turn you into a formidable negotiator because your emotional detachment gives you the ability to never lose your way in the course of your discussions; your original personality disconcerts your interlocutor and you wonderfully take advantage of it. Uranus Dominant If Uranus is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Uranian: personal values are prevailing. Inner certainties fuel an inflexible will and a desire to call attention on yourself as well as to follow your beliefs through. This planet prompts you to behave with determination, to put forward your own truth, and to start your personal revolution. More than other people, you are willing to keep some degree of autonomy in all circumstances, and you often display an individualistic nature. In order to achieve your ideal of freedom and independence, you may act like a despot as you try to convince and to impose your views, whether smoothly or forcefully. Regardless of the flexibility of your comportment, some situations demand an absolute firmness as well as uncompromising, frank and straightforward attitudes. People may criticise you for your intransigence and say that you are a hardliner. Outsider's opinions don't matter! The most important thing is that you act in all conscience and reach your primary objectives. More than anyone else, you know how to use your willpower and to focus your energy on a precise aim, relentlessly, whatever the consequences might be. In the chapter of qualities, let's mention a definite sense of responsibility, an innovative mind open to techniques and modern ideas, as well as a natural self-discipline which overcomes many an obstacle. Therefore, people are well-advised not to hound you into a corner. Interpretation of the 24\u00b0 Libra symbolic degree \"The sun shines bright on a flowery promontory where a peacock spreads its tail.\" (Janduz version) Ambitious, proud, and frivolous character. Success and wealth are achieved owing to one's good-looking features and sex-appeal. However, if the natal chart indicates strong moral and intellectual qualities, thanks to a devoted mentor, and although one never asked for it, one achieves considerable success and prosperity and remains simple and nice.

Water is its element, it is moist, it rules Pisces, is in exaltation in Cancer, though some authors say it is Leo, and is in analogy with the vegetative system. It represents dreamers, mediums, magicians, merchants of illusion, drug addicts. Temperament: rather Lymphatic Characterology: Emotive, non Active, Primary or Secondary type; it is a Sentimental, or sometimes Amorphous type. For more information, see the page dedicated to Neptune. Neptune in Sagittarius The planet Neptune symbolizes extreme receptivity, intense emotional sharpness, impressionability and inspiration; it is the planet of mediums, mystics and religious faith. In an astrological chart, it indicates dilution, vagueness, understanding one's environment through emotions and the absence of clear and determined limits and structures. In your natal chart, Neptune's house position is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Neptune in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. The sign positions of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto have a collective meaning. They do not influence your personality, unless they are involved in numerous aspects or when they emphasize a personal point of your natal chart such as your Ascendant's ruler, an angular planet, i.e. a planet near the Ascendant, the Midheaven, the Nadir or the Descendant. In such cases, the activity of the slow planet is very highlighted in many regards. Neptune in Sagittarius may turn you into a monk, a visionary, or an active idealist willing to change the world. Rebellion and inspiration at the service of a sacred cause: here is an example that could describe accurately this planetary configuration. Neptune Dominant If Neptune is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Neptunian: your intuition is highly developed. You are of a contemplative nature, and you are particularly receptive to ambiances, places, and people. You gladly cultivate the art of letting-go, and you allow the natural unfolding of events to construct your world. You follow your inspirations, for better or for worse. At times, you display an extraordinary clairvoyance gift. You seem to be able to read your subconscious like a book, and you track down subtle underlying mechanisms, flaws, or open breaches. This innate intuition might explain the strokes of good luck which the Neptunian is sometimes credited with. However, you may also be the victim of illusions and misleading intuitions. You are an idealist, and you let your deepest aspirations prevail over the realities of the moment. Then, you set off in quest of some quixotic objective, living like a Don Quixote who relentlessly pursues an impossible dream. You have a great talent for psychology and the mysteries of the human soul. Since you instinctively perceive people's intents and motivations, as you swim in the complexity of human nature, you feel in your element. The subtlety of your perceptiveness is the source of both special affections and irrevocable rejections. What is the danger of such a dominant? If it is not offset by other influences in your natal chart, you may not have an iron will. Your trump card is your instinct, which may be developed to the extent that it becomes clairvoyance. Interpretation of the 6\u00b0 Sagittarius symbolic degree \"Oxen and goats graze in a pasture under the sun.\" (Janduz version) Quiet, contented, and hard-working character. Occupations in the industry of cattle breeding and all agricultural products are very favoured. One is happily married and enjoys a fulfilling family life.

Its element is indefinite; burning (like lava in fusion ?), it rules Scorpio, is in exaltation in Pisces and is in analogy with the sexual organs and excretion. It represents dictators, sadistic people, violent characters, is instinctive and powerful but also mysterious with hidden strengths. Temperament: rather Bilious Characterology: Emotive or non-Emotive, Active, Primary type; it is a Passionate Choleric type. For more information, see the page dedicated to Pluto. Pluto in Libra The planet Pluto symbolizes deep disruptions and upheavals, domination and sexual instincts, and the inner power we have in ourselves. Pluto destroys in order to reconstruct and he provokes painful crises that are needed in metamorphosis. Pluto is our deepest instincts' brutal force. It is the hidden and unconscious violence that can explode in us with incredible intensity before being projected in our actions; in itself, the planet is not negative: the might and the intensity of its energy are beyond the conceivable but it can be funnelled. Pluto is the only possibility we have at our disposal to overcome our inner blocks and to eliminate outgrown situations that have become inextricable. Pluto's energy is valuable because of its usefulness for the irreversible destruction of what constitutes a problem and not because of its negative side and its perversity. Pluto allows to reconstruct and to regenerate parts of our personality or whole stretches of our life, provided that we manage to funnel his wild energy and to step back. It is impossible to tame this energy, given its essence. However, it is possible to take advantage of it for a precise aim, through a temporary identification of some parts of us with this energy. In such a case, the outcome is our final evolution and even, our transformation. In your natal chart, Pluto's house position is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, Pluto is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Pluto in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. The sign positions of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto have a collective meaning. They do not influence your personality and they are not to be really taken into account, unless they are involved in numerous aspects or when they emphasize a personal point of your natal chart such as your Ascendant's ruler, an angular planet, i.e. a planet near the Ascendant, the Midheaven, the Nadir or the Descendant. In such cases, the activity of the slow planet is very highlighted. Pluto in Libra intensifies your charisma and... your domination. Yet, you influence your entourage in charming and magnetic ways. Pluto Dominant If Pluto is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Plutonian: you sometimes feel like a foreigner who does not belong to the world, to its laws, and its concerns. The rules of life in society are not necessarily yours. You are interested in what is unknown and in the subtle laws of a hidden order. So, you take malicious pleasure in ridiculing the patterns you find too simplistic or too rigid. You also revel in underlining the limits of explanations you deem too common. There is something unconventional about the way you are, the way you think, and the way you act. What is your specificity made of? Is it an extraordinary partner? A life off the beaten path? Or do you only distance yourself from conventional morals? In any case, you have the feeling, sometimes quite vague, that you come from nowhere, and that you do not belong to any definite group... In short, it means that you cannot be simplified in order to conform to existing models. The gap between you and ordinary mortals is also an element of your strength. Your deep clear-sightedness, firstly, enables you to put things into perspective and to grant them only the attention they deserve. Your other remarkable asset is your capacity to intervene from behind the scenes, to secretly organise events, and to bring about the desirable outcome without seeming to impose or to dictate anything. However, you must still overcome one of the major difficulties of this dominant, which is to get people to accept your difference and to smoothly fit into your environment. Interpretation of the 4\u00b0 Libra symbolic degree \"As he tries to help a young woman climb a mountainous path, a man falls from the top of a rock into the lake which is further down.\" (Janduz version) Reckless and undiscerning character lacking practical good sense. Relationships are not selected carefully enough, and confidence is granted too easily. The top of the rock symbolises a high social status, and the question is whether one is able to retain it or not. Females encountered in both the private and the professional spheres are most likely to be the cause of recurrent failures. Several marriages, including an illegal one, are possible. This degree warns against water and accidents in the mountain. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees.

Most astrologers consider it as a kind of \"mediator\" between Saturn and outer planets. Consequently, Chiron is of Saturn's nature and at the same time is influenced by Uranus, the first slow-moving planet. Astrologically, it symbolizes wisdom, patience and the faculty to reduce others' sufferings: it is said to be the \"great healer\" of the zodiac. Like all the secondary bodies, it must be in close conjunction with planets or angles in order to fully express its action. %TEXTES_22%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_23% Ceres, the biggest of the four minor asteroids used besides Chiron, is associated with the mythological goddess of growing plants and harvest and also symbolizes physical constitution, vitality and fertility. She's also known as Demeter, according to the astrologer Zipporah Dobyns, linked to the symbolism of the mother but in a less emotive and more physical way than the Moon. Ceres is thought to be the ruler of Virgo, in exaltation in Gemini, in exile in Pisces and in fall in Sagittarius. Keywords associated with Ceres could be order, practical sense, worry, precision, modesty, method, sobriety, motherhood, fertility, the Earth: a kind of a more cerebral Moon... %TEXTES_23%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_24% Pallas is sometimes used in modern Astrology: she represents intelligence, abstract and global thinking talents. It is usually considered to be a determining element in political strategy. %TEXTES_24%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_25% Juno is the asteroid corresponding to the adaptation to the marital partner and to the defence of individual rights; it is thus used in the field of marriage. %TEXTES_25%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_26% Vesta is rarely used and brings the ability to efficiently devote oneself to a cause. %TEXTES_26%\n\nTrue North Node 18\u00b028' \u042f Sagittarius The North Node (True Node here) represents the goals that must be achieved during life, in the karmic sense according to some traditions. Its position in house indicates in what field an effort is necessary in order to evolve. The North Node is often called the Dragon's head, it is usually considered beneficial, a bit like Jupiter with the planets. The Lunar nodes are fictional points and not actual heavenly bodies: they are the intersections of the Moon with the Ecliptic (the path made by the Sun in its orbit as seen from the Earth). The axis of the Lunar nodes moves 19 degrees each year, namely a bit more than three minutes each day. The South Node is diametrically opposed to the North Node, therefore it faces it (it's not drawn here, it's the same symbol but upside down). It symbolizes what has already been achieved or acquired, in a karmic sense: it's the past from which it's advised to move on in order to progress. The South Node is rather negative, of a Saturnian nature: the experience through suffering. Interpretation of the 18\u00b0 Sagittarius symbolic degree \"As it tries to escape from a burning house, a snake is stopped by a circle of fire.\" (Janduz version) Passionate, wily, and spiteful character. Fire plays a major part in life, whether it represents a disaster or a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity with great consequences on destiny. Regardless of the nature of ordeals and opponents, and despite the losses suffered, if one displays courage, this degree indicates that obstacles can be overcome and enemies, defeated. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\n\nTrue Lilith 4\u00b015' Aquarius Lilith or the Dark Moon (True Lilith here) represents the uncrossable threshold, taboos, the individual's provocative and fascinating side, including on a sexual level. She symbolizes violence and \"untameability\", the radical and deep-seated refusal to submit. The keywords for Lilith can be sterility, sadism, perversity, castration, sadomasochism, eroticism, orgasm, forbidden fantasies, marginality, cruelty; redemption, illumination, rebelliousness... Lilith's opposite point is called Priapus; it is the Lunar perigee, the position where the Moon is closest to the Earth. It symbolizes man's primitive nature, the horror hidden in our deepest self; masochism, extreme sensuality, impulsiveness, irrationality and excess. Physically speaking, the Dark Moon is the focal point unoccupied by the Earth: it is not a concrete body but a mathematical point. Interpretation of the 4\u00b0 Aquarius symbolic degree \"A young woman with a crown of flowers on her head admires her reflection in the water. Painting and sculpture tools are scattered here and there.\" (Janduz version) Self-centred, sensual, and frivolous character. Meeting one's sexual needs is the major concern for which one is prepared to sacrifice everything. Because sensuality prevails over true love, one may be involved in adulterous relationships and experience big affective losses. On the professional area, owing to the influence of the constellation of the Dolphin, all artistic careers are very favoured, especially when the theme chosen is about love, beauty, children, or flowers. Paradoxically enough, this degree sometimes indicates a true religious vocation. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_29% The Part of Fortune is an ancient concept, used by Ptolemy and other astrologers before him. Firstly, it has nothing to do with fortune! In modern astrology, it is actually used to enhance a planet or angle when in close conjunction with it: it thus amplifies the meaning associated to the point affected by its presence. It is calculated in the following way: Part of Fortune = AS + Moon - Sun (it is the Moons position when the Sun rises) The classical Part of Fortune, of which the calculus method is unchanged whether in a diurnal or nocturnal chart, is usually distinguished from the diurnal/nocturnal Part of Fortune which is calculated by the formula AS + Sun - Moon for a nocturnal chart, and AS + Moon - Sun in a diurnal chart. We currently use the latter formula for our astrological programmes. For more information, see the page dedicated to the Arabian parts. %TEXTES_29%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_30% The First House or Ascendant represents one's behaviour in the eyes of others, and also one's health. It corresponds to the way the individual acts in the world. It is the image of the personality seen by others and the person's visible behaviour expressed outwardly. The 1st House is in analogy with Aries and thus Mars too, and then the Sun. It is an angular house, the most important one with the Midheaven, maybe even more so due to its link with the body and health. %TEXTES_30%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_31% The Tenth House still called the Midheaven, is the highest point amidst the houses, at the top of the chart, in the South, and relates to destiny in general and career (and not daily work as meant by the Sixth House).

It is in analogy with Capricorn and Saturn. The Tenth House is the most important angular house along with the Ascendant. %TEXTES_31%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_32% The First House or Ascendant represents one's behaviour in the eyes of others and also one's health.

It is in analogy with Gemini and Mercury. It's a cadent house, less important than the angular and succedent ones.\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_35% The Fourth House also called Immum Coeli is the sphere of inner emotions, family, the father, home and roots, but also the home one creates. It's Home Sweet Home, security and cocoon. It is in analogy with Cancer and the Moon. It's an angular and important house. %TEXTES_35%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_36% The Fifth House is the sphere of pleasures and love affairs (but not commitment or marriage), creations and entertainments, children, arts and game.

It is a cadent house, less important than the angular and succedent ones.\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_38% The Seventh House also called the Descendant (in front of the Ascendant) is the sphere of partnership, marriage, contracts, relationships with others, the outer world. It is in analogy with Libra and Venus, and Saturn to a lesser extent. It is an angular and important house. %TEXTES_38%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_39% The Eighth House is the sphere of emotional security, the depths of the self, secrets and paranormal, transcendence, sexuality, mysteries, upheavals, surgical operations, others' money (investments, inheritances), crises, transformation after evolution, death. It is in analogy with Scorpio and Pluto, and Mars to a lesser extent. It is a succedent and quite important house.\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_40% The Ninth House is the sphere of high studies, both physical and mental journeys (philosophy, spirituality), rebelliousness, changes of scenery, desire for dealing with the unknown. It is in analogy with Sagittarius and Jupiter.

It is in analogy with Pisces and Neptune.\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_44% The Vertex, sometimes called counter-Ascendant, is a fictitious point which is at the intersection of two great circles, the Ecliptic and the great vertical circle (Prime Vertical) in the West of the birthplace, linking the East, the Zenith, the West, and the Nadir. It is always located in the West of the chart around the Descendant. It is the chart's fifth angle, so to speak, less important than the other angles. Its interpretation is controversial, because certain astrologers pay no attention to it. The Vertex is sometimes considered to be the second Descendant because, like the latter, it is related to communication and exchanges. It has to do with associations and fated encounters, those that are not chosen, and reveals the type of sensitivity and reactivity we have in our dealings with other people: a refined and tolerant way in Libra, straightforward and spontaneous in Aries, etc. %TEXTES_44%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_45% The East Point is a fictitious point at the intersection of two great circles, the Ecliptic and the great vertical circle (Prime Vertical) in the East of the birthplace, linking the East, the Zenith, the West, and the Nadir. It is always located in the East of the chart, around the Ascendant. The East Point is sometimes considered to be a second Ascendant, less important, but also related to how one is seen by other people, and to how one expresses one's personality. %TEXTES_45%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_46% Cupido is a hypothetical trans-Neptunian planet, the existence of which is not proven.

He studied in Italy at the Design Istituto d\u0092Arte Applicata in Cant\u00f9 until the age of 17, and then graduated from London's Central Saint Martins Academy in 1999. In 2005, Tisci was given the title of creative director for Givenchy Women's haute couture and ready-to-wear lines. In May 2008 he was additionally named as menswear and accessories designer of the Givenchy men's division. In March 2018, it was announced he had been appointed chief creative officer of Burberry, succeeding Christopher Bailey.\n\n\n\nTisci's apparent fascination with Gothic touches (dark, languid dresses for fall couture) and space-age minimalism (one ready-to-wear show featured white-clad models drifting around a sterile-white sphere) has drawn new attention to the Givenchy brand. Reviews and output so far have been mixed and inconsistent, but many, including influential fashion critics (such as Cathy Horyn of The New York Times and Suzy Menkes of the International Herald Tribune) have honed in on Tisci's conceptual leanings, as well as his future potential for revitalizing the Givenchy brand and infusing it with his precision and imagination.\n\nAstrological portrait of Riccardo Tisci (excerpt)\n\nDisclaimer: these short excerpts of astrological charts are computer processed. They are, by no means, of a personal nature. This principle is valid for the 63,440 celebrities included in our database. These texts provide the meanings of planets, or combination of planets, in signs and in houses, as well as the interpretations of planetary dominants in line with modern Western astrology rules. Moreover, since Astrotheme is not a polemic website, no negative aspect which may damage the good reputation of a celebrity is posted here, unlike in the comprehensive astrological portrait.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHere are some character traits from Riccardo Tisci's birth chart. This description is far from being comprehensive but it can shed light on his/her personality, which is still interesting for professional astrologers or astrology lovers.\n\nIn a matter of minutes, you can get at your email address your astrological portrait (approximately 32 pages), a much more comprehensive report than this portrait of Riccardo Tisci.\n\n\n\n\n\nN.B.: as this celebrity's birth time is unknown, the chart is arbitrarily calculated for 12:00 PM - the legal time for his/her place of birth; since astrological houses are not taken into account, this astrological profile excerpt is less detailed than those for which the birth time is known.\n\nThe dominant planets of Riccardo Tisci\n\nWhen interpreting a natal chart, the best method is to start gradually from general features to specific ones. Thus, there is usually a plan to be followed, from the overall analysis of the chart and its structure, to the description of its different character traits.\n\nIn the first part, an overall analysis of the chart enables us to figure out the personality's main features and to emphasize several points that are confirmed or not in the detailed analysis: in any case, those general traits are taken into account. Human personality is an infinitely intricate entity and describing it is a complex task. Claiming to rapidly summarize it is illusory, although it does not mean that it is an impossible challenge. It is essential to read a natal chart several times in order to absorb all its different meanings and to grasp all this complexity. But the exercise is worthwhile.\n\nIn brief, a natal chart is composed of ten planets: two luminaries, the Sun and the Moon, three fast-moving or individual planets, Mercury, Venus and Mars, two slow-moving planets, Jupiter and Saturn, and three very slow-moving planets, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. Additional secondary elements are: the Lunar Nodes, the Dark Moon or Lilith, Chiron and other minor objects. They are all posited on the Zodiac wheel consisting of twelve signs, from Aries to Pisces, and divided into twelve astrological houses.\n\nThe first step is to evaluate the importance of each planet. This is what we call identifying the dominant planets. This process obeys rules that depend on the astrologer's sensitivity and experience but it also has precise and steady bases: thus, we can take into account the parameters of a planet's activity (the number of active aspects a planet forms, the importance of each aspect according to its nature and its exactness), angularity parameters; (proximity to the four angles, Ascendant, Midheaven, Descendant and Imum Coeli or Nadir, all of them being evaluated numerically, according to the kind of angle and the planet-angle distance) and quality parameters (rulership, exaltation, exile and fall). Finally, other criteria such as the rulership of the Ascendant and the Midheaven etc. are important.\n\nThese different criteria allow a planet to be highlighted and lead to useful conclusions when interpreting the chart.\n\nThe overall chart analysis begins with the observation of three sorts of planetary distributions in the chart: Eastern or Western hemisphere, Northern or Southern hemisphere, and quadrants (North-eastern, North-western, South-eastern and South-western). These three distributions give a general tone in terms of introversion and extraversion, willpower, sociability, and behavioural predispositions.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nThen, there are three additional distributions: elements (called triplicity since there are three groups of signs for each one) - Fire, Air, Earth and Water - corresponding to a character typology, modality (or quadruplicity with four groups of signs for each one) - Cardinal, Fixed and Mutable - and polarity (Yin and Yang).\n\nThere are three types of dominants: dominant planets, dominant signs and dominant houses. The novice thinks astrology means only \"to be Aries\" or sometimes, for example, \"to be Aries Ascendant Virgo\". It is actually far more complex. Although the Sun and the Ascendant alone may reveal a large part of the character - approximately a third or a half of your psychological signature, a person is neither \"just the Sun\" (called the sign) nor just \"the first house\" (the Ascendant). Thus, a particular planet's influence may be significantly increased; a particular sign or house may contain a group of planets that will bring nuances and sometimes weaken the role of the Ascendant, of the Sun sign etc.\n\nLastly, there are two other criteria: accentuations (angular, succedent and cadent) which are a classification of astrological houses and types of decanates that are occupied (each sign is divided into three decanates of ten degrees each). They provide some additional informations.\n\nThese general character traits must not be taken literally; they are, somehow, preparing for the chart reading. They allow to understand the second part of the analysis, which is more detailed and precise. It focuses on every area of the personality and provides a synthesis of all the above-mentioned parameters according to sound hierarchical rules.\n\nWarning: when the birth time is unknown, which is the case for Riccardo Tisci, a few paragraphs become irrelevant; distributions in hemispheres and quadrants are meaningless, so are dominant houses and houses' accentuations. Therefore, some chapters are removed from this part.\n\nFor all paragraphs, the criteria for valuation are calculated without taking into account angles and rulerships of the Ascendant and of the Midheaven. The methodology retains its validity, but it is less precise without a time of birth.\n\nElements and Modes for Riccardo Tisci\n\nThe predominance of Water signs indicates high sensitivity and elevation through feelings, Riccardo Tisci. Your heart and your emotions are your driving forces, and you can't do anything on Earth if you don't feel a strong affective charge (as a matter of fact, the word \"feeling\" is essential in your psychology). You need to love in order to understand, and to feel in order to take action, which causes a certain vulnerability which you should fight against.\n\nRiccardo Tisci, Fire is dominant in your natal chart and endows you with intuition, energy, courage, self-confidence, and enthusiasm! You are inclined to be passionate, you assert your willpower, you move forward, and come hell or high water, you achieve your dreams and your goals. The relative weakness of this element is the difficulty to step back or a kind of boldness that may prompt you to do foolish things.\n\nThe twelve zodiacal signs are split up into three groups or modes, called quadruplicities, a learned word meaning only that these three groups include four signs. The Cardinal, Fixed and Mutable modes are more or less represented in your natal chart, depending on planets' positions and importance, and on angles in the twelve signs.\n\nRiccardo Tisci, the Cardinal mode is dominant here and indicates a predisposition to action, and more exactly, to impulsion and to undertake: you are very keen to implement the plans you have in mind, to get things going and to create them. This is the most important aspect that inspires enthusiasm and adrenalin in you, without which you can grow weary rapidly. You are individualistic (maybe too much?) and assertive. You let others strengthen and improve the constructions which you built with fervour.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nDominants: Planets, Signs and Houses for Riccardo Tisci\n\nThe issue of dominant planets has existed since the mists of time in astrology: how nice it would be if a person could be described with a few words and one or several planets that would represent their character, without having to analyse such elements as rulerships, angularities, houses, etc!\n\nThe ten planets - the Sun throughout Pluto - are a bit like ten characters in a role-play, each one has its own personality, its own way of acting, its own strengths and weaknesses. They actually represent a classification into ten distinct personalities, and astrologers have always tried to associate one or several dominant planets to a natal chart as well as dominant signs and houses.\n\nIndeed, it is quite the same situation with signs and houses. If planets symbolize characters, signs represent hues - the mental, emotional and physical structures of an individual. The sign in which a planet is posited is like a character whose features are modified according to the place where he lives. In a chart, there are usually one, two or three highlighted signs that allow to rapidly describe its owner.\n\nRegarding astrological houses, the principle is even simpler: the twelve houses correspond to twelve fields of life, and planets tenanting any given house increase that house's importance and highlight all relevant life departments: it may be marriage, work, friendship etc.\n\nIn your natal chart, Riccardo Tisci, the ten main planets are distributed as follows:\n\nThe three most important planets in your chart are the Sun, Venus and Jupiter.\n\nOne of the dominant planets in your natal chart is the Sun. He symbolizes will, magnetism, sense of honour and dignity. You are a Solar being, and you often display charismatic and leadership qualities. Your warmth and your persuasive power lead you far away from pettiness. You enjoy thinking big and, consequently, you move forward according to what you decide.\n\nYour Solarian weakness may be related to the sin of pride or to excessive authority. The frontier between pride and vanity is tenuous: be careful not to overstep it and to keep the nobleness of heart that is part of your charm.\n\nWith Venus among your dominant planets, one of your first reflexes is... to please! Your look, your charm, and your seduction are omnipresent elements in your behaviour.\n\nYour approach to things is connected to your heart, and for you, no real communication can flow if your interlocutors exude no sympathy or warmth. Cold and logical reasoning, clear thoughts and good sense are not important to you: if there is no affective bond with your environment, no connection can be established with the Venusian that you are, and nothing happens.\n\nYou have a strong artistic side, and you never neglect subjective but clear concepts such as pleasure, beauty, and also sensuality. However, sometimes to the detriment of efficiency, durability, logic, and... detachment.\n\nJupiter, the planet of expansion, organization, power and benevolence, is quite emphasized in your chart. Like any Jupiterian, you are warm, open, sociable, consensual, active and optimistic. You can use your self-confidence to erase differences of opinion, and you leave the task of analyzing and perfecting things to specialists. Your role, and you know it since you were young, is to gather, to demonstrate your synthesizing and conciliatory mind, and to naturally reap its fruits - power.\n\nYou appreciate legality, social order but also order in general. With you as a leader, every plan or human entity can be organized and structured. You excel at supervising. The Jupiterian type is indeed the politician par excellence, and a positive Jupiter in your chart is synonymous with good integration into society, whatever the chosen path.\n\nIs this idyllic picture really perfect? Certainly not: each planet's typology has its own weaknesses. One of yours is pride, like the Solarian, but your will of expansion at all costs may generate a form of exaggeration in everything, endless pleasure, inappropriate self-confidence that could lead you to rough materialism and the thirst for absurd material comfort - in the worst cases, of course.\n\nIn your natal chart, the three most important signs - according to criteria mentioned above - are in decreasing order of strength Cancer, Leo and Capricorn. In general, these signs are important because your Ascendant or your Sun is located there. But this is not always the case: there may be a cluster of planets, or a planet may be near an angle other than the Midheaven or Ascendant. It may also be because two or three planets are considered to be very active because they form numerous aspects from these signs.\n\nThus, you display some of the three signs' characteristics, a bit like a superposition of features on the rest of your chart, and it is all the more so if the sign is emphasized.\n\nCancer is one of your dominant signs and endows you with imagination and exceptionally shrewd sensitivity. Although suspicious at first sight - and even at second...- as soon as you get familiar with people and let them win your confidence, your golden heart eventually shows up, d"}, {"url": "https://www.famousdetails.com/riccardo-tisci/", "page_content": "Riccardo Tisci (Fashion Designer) was born on the 8th of August, 1974.
