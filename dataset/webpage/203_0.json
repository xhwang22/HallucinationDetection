Interval (1973).\n\nMerle Oberon, who is best remembered for her striking portrayal of the tormented Cathy in the 1939 film version of Emily Bront\u00eb 's Wuthering Heights, was a popular movie actress during the 1930s and 1940s. Oberon's beauty alone sustained her career into the 1950s, although her private life attracted as much attention as her films; she was married four times and often involved in romantic affairs. Following her death in 1979, Michael Korda, her nephew by her first marriage to Alexander Korda, said of her: \"Her greatest achievement was not in her roles, but herself, as Merle Oberon. She was her own work of art.\"\n\nOberon kept the details surrounding her birth a secret throughout her life, insisting that she was born into an aristocratic family in Tasmania. In truth, she was born in 1911 in Bombay's overcrowded St. George's Hospital, the daughter of Arthur Terrence O'Brien Thompson, a mechanical engineer for the British railways, and Charlotte Selby Thompson , a Ceylonese nurse's assistant. Fearing she might be ostracized as a half-caste, Merle initiated the lie about her past when she entered show business and by several accounts eventually came to believe her own legend. Oberon was raised in Bombay and Calcutta and was educated until the age of 11 at the strict La Martini\u00e8re school in Calcutta, an austere place where she was very much a loner. After she left, she was tutored at home by her hard-working mother, then entered business school at the age of 15. Her first job was as a typist in a department store.\n\nAt age 17, Oberon made her way to London, where she initially worked as a dance-hall girl under the name Queenie Thompson. By now\n\na regal beauty, she was hired as an extra in a number of British films and eventually caught the eye of Hungarian-born director-producer Alexander Korda who was starting his own film company and offered the actress a five-year contract. Korda cast her in the small role of Anne Boleyn in The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933), the first British talkie to attract an international audience. Oberon went on to play leads with Korda's company, including a Japanese woman in The Battle (1934) and Lady Blakeney in the film adaptation of Emma Orczy 's The Scarlet Pimpernel (1935), opposite Leslie Howard, with whom she also had a love affair. In 1935, Korda sold half her contract to the Goldwyn studios, thus launching Oberon's Hollywood career. Following an inauspicious debut in Folies Berg\u00e8re (1935), she gained credibility in The Dark Angel (1935), with Fredric March, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award. In 1937, Oberon returned to England to star in the ambitious I Claudius with Charles Laughton, but her involvement in a near-fatal car crash halted the already troubled project in mid-production. Following her recovery, Korda starred her in several comedies, including Over the Moon (1937) and The Divorce of Lady X (1938), opposite a very young Laurence-Olivier.\n\nOlivier was her co-star again in Wuthering Heights, although Oberon's first choice for the role of Heathcliff had been Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and Olivier had desperately wanted his new love Vivien Leigh for the role of Cathy. Tension on the set was heightened by the dictatorial style of the film's director William Wyler. The finished product, however, bore little evidence of the traumatic shoot, and Oberon's career went into high gear. Frank Nugent, critic for The New York Times, was generous in his acclaim, praising the \"wild spirit\" that marked her performance. Despite other glowing reviews, Oberon was not nominated for an Academy Award that year, an \"appalling\" oversight according to her biographers, Charles Higham and Roy Moseley.\n\nOberon's private life fascinated the gossip columnists, beginning with her engagement in 1934 to Joseph Schenck, producer and chair of the board of 20th Century-Fox, whom she abandoned for actor Leslie Howard, whom she subsequently left for actor David Niven. \"It was Merle's pattern,\" write Higham and Moseley. They also suggest that she was ahead of her time in her choice of men, preferring them to be \"neither subservient nor dominating, but to be her equal, her partner and friend as well as her physical lover.\" Oberon was also married four times; her first husband Alexander Korda was in love with her for years before they wed in 1939. The marriage, however, was failing by 1945, when Oberon met and fell in love with 35-year-old cinematographer Lucien Ballard, who also worked to provide special lighting for the star after a reaction to sulfa drugs and subsequent dermabrasion treatments severely damaged her skin. (Ballard developed and patented a new light, the \"Obie,\" named for Oberon, which was widely used in the industry.) Differences began to emerge between the two, however, early in the relationship. \"Merle was prone to daydreams, reveries, and romantic abstractions, whereas Ballard was tough and without interest in mysticism, spiritualism, which was beginning to fascinate Merle,\" write Higham and Moseley. In the wake of Oberon's divorce from Korda in 1945, the two married, although Ballard later said he dreaded being thought of as \"Mr. Merle Oberon,\" and only married the actress because she wore him down. The union lasted just four years, during which time Oberon met her great love, Count Giorgio Cini, a handsome and wealthy Italian aristocrat who was killed in a plane crash in 1949, not long after Oberon's divorce from Ballard was granted.\n\nWhile Oberon's private life flourished during the 1940s, her career began to decline. Two successive comedies, That Uncertain Feeling (1941) and Affectionately Yours (1941), failed at the box office, and her performance in Korda's romantic Lydia (1941) disappointed the critics, although she herself thought it was one of her best efforts. A turn as George Sand , in A Song to Remember (1945), opposite Cornel Wilde as Chopin, drew out-and-out ridicule. \"William Bendix being Chopin would have been no less incongruous than Merle Oberon being George Sand in a smart sort of Vesta Tilley outfit,\" snarled critic Richard Winnington. By 1947, Oberon was relegated to the lower half of double bills, and by the mid-1950s was playing supporting roles, notably in Desiree (1954) and Deep in My Heart (1954).\n\nIn 1957, Oberon married wealthy Italian industrialist Bruno Pagliai, who, though not good-looking, exuded power, money, and charm. They adopted two children, a girl and a boy, and settled into two lavish homes: one in Mexico City and another in Cuernavaca. While her husband was frequently away on business, Oberon doted on her children and ran her two households with a military precision that frequently strained those who worked for her. While she bloomed as an international hostess, she made fewer and fewer films. One of her infrequent appearances was in Of Love and Desire (1963), filmed in her own house and at her own expense. She hired then-unknown Richard Rush to direct. \"As an actress\u2014and as a human being\u2014she was like a jeweled Swiss clock,\" he said. \"Exquisite perfection. Finely timed. One thinks of her as part of an older Hollywood, an older tradition, but her working style was very like that of a Method-trained actor or actress. Everything she did was totally internalized.\" The finished product, nonetheless, was leveled by the critics, although it did surprisingly well at the box office. Higham and Moseley believe that although it is not a particularly good film, it is one of Oberon's most interesting because it completely captures her spirit. \"With its lush musical score, opulent images and scenes of passion, jealousy, abandon, and reconciliation, it is like a Victorian novel, and it was clearly very close to Merle's soul.\" Two of Oberon's other films of the '60s, The Oscar (1966) and Hotel (1967), both enjoyed wide showings as well.\n\nOberon also produced her last film, Interval (1973), which was financed by Pagliai, although their marriage was all but over by then. In the movie, Oberon portrays an aging woman who falls in love with a younger man, played by Robert Wolders, her new paramour. The film received scathing reviews, the critic for The New York Times writing that \"on a scale of awfulness, it is almost sublime.\" In 1975, after a difficult split from Pagliai, Oberon and Wolders, who was 25 years her junior, married and settled into a beach house in California.\n\nFollowing a trip to Australia in the fall of 1978, Oberon was stricken with chest pains, and subsequently underwent heart bypass surgery. The healing process produced thick scars called keloids, which were so painful that she underwent steroid treatments to achieve some relief. Oberon never recovered completely from her ordeal and was even too ill to attend her daughter Francesca Pagliai 's wedding. She died of a stroke on Thanksgiving eve in 1979. (Starting in 1981, Wolders would live with Audrey Hepburn until her death.)\n\nOberon left a million dollars of her estate to the Motion Picture Country House and Hospital, and the auctioning of her extensive jewelry collection raised close to another million for various other cinema charities. Six years after her death, her nephew Michael Korda wrote a novel based on Oberon's life entitled Queenie (1985), which was made into a television miniseries in 1987.\n\nsources:\n\nGarraty, John A., and Mark C.

The only possible opening seemed to be in some line in which I could use my face. This was, in fact, no better than a hundred other faces, but it did possess a fortunately photogenic quality.\u201d \u2013 Merle Oberon.\n\nShe was one of the great stars of Hollywood\u2019s golden age. An exquisite actress with opalescent eyes, who left an indelible mark on her audience. She rose from poverty stricken circumstances to become a millionaire who married four times, owned several fine houses and became a Lady in 1942. Yet she was a woman forced to live a lie by her production studio.\n\nHer name was Merle Oberon.\n\nEstelle Merle O\u2019Brien Thompson was born on in Bombay (now Mumbai) British India on February 19 1911. Her father was a railway engineer from Darlington named Arthur Terrance O\u2019Brien Thompson and her mother was Constance Selby, who was just 12 when she gave birth. Constance was the daughter of Arthur Thompson\u2019s girlfriend Charlotte Selby, who was a Eurasian with partial Maori heritage from Ceylon.\n\nCharlotte was around 26 when Merle was born, and raised her as her own. Merle would grow up thinking her mother was her sister.\n\nIn 1914, Arthur Thompson joined the British Army and later died of pneumonia on the Western Front during the Battle of the Somme. Constance eventually married Alexander Soares and had four other children, who grew up believing that Merle was their aunt. After living in dilapidated flats, they moved to Calcutta (now named Kolkata) in 1917 and Merle gained a foundation scholarship to attend prestigious private school La Martiniere Calcutta for Girls. But she quit school after being taunted about her parentage and was taught at home.\n\nMerle\u2019s first performance was with the Calcutta Amateur Dramatic Society. She worked in nightclubs and as a telephonist under the name \u2018Queenie Thompson\u2019. She began seeing Mark Hanna, the head of Paramount Pictures in India, and he sparked her interest in stardom. Through Hanna she met former actor Colonel Ben Finney and secretly hoped the relationship would \u201cpave her way to the movies\u201d (www.sapnamagazine.com). Finney ended the relationship when he learned of Merle\u2019s parentage, but introduced her to Rex Ingram of Victorine Studios in Nice. Merle and her mother moved to Marseilles in France and Ingram was so impressed by Oberon\u2019s exotic beauty that he put her in a film called \u2018The Three Passions\u2019 as an extra.\n\nMerle was utterly exquisite. \u201cHer face was as finely-carved as an ivory mask. She exuded the atmosphere of being a great lady: not merely a star,\u201d Cornell Wilde said of her. \u201cI felt as if I had walked into a museum and was looking at a masterpiece of sculpture.\u201d Merle was 5\u2019 2\u201d and darkly beautiful, with finely chiselled features and opalescent almond-shaped blue-green eyes.\n\nAlexander Korda was a Hungarian-born British film producer and director, and Merle got her first serious break in his picture \u2018Wedding Rehearsal\u2019 after Ann Todd dropped out. By this time, Merle had made her way to England and was working as a nightclub hostess under the name \u2018Queenie O\u2019Brien\u2019. She continued to get bit parts until Alexander\u2019s Korda\u2019s wife Maria drew her to his attention: \u201cWhat a striking girl,\u201d she exclaimed.\n\nKorda had wrapped \u2018The Private Life of Henry VIII\u2019, but decided to add an early sequence with Anne Boleyn and decided to give Merle the chance of a lifetime. Merle was elated to be offered the part and was captivated by Anne Boleyn: \u201cThose who have written about her have mostly been dry professors who do not understand women. One day perhaps I may write a book about Anne myself,\u201d she was to tell a reporter.\n\nBut Merle horrified when she received the script. It was only three pages and less than two minutes of film. Merle later told the London Observer: \u201cWhen I found that they have given me exactly two (sic) minutes on the screen, that made me mad, and I thought to myself I\u2019ll make them remember those two minutes whatever else they forget. If I don\u2019t, they may get rid of me in a subtle way they got rid of Catherine of Aragon. It wasn\u2019t difficult, really, the lines were so lovely and simple \u2013 \u2018Mine is such a little neck\u2019 \u2013 I remember crying afterward and saying to Alex, \u2018what in the world is the matter with me?\u2019 and he said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s acting Merle\u2019!\u201d (www.sapnamagazine.com). The scene was shot in two days and is so poignant and haunting, that those who see it never forget it.\n\n\u2018The Private Life of Henry VIII\u2019 was a huge success; Merle won great reviews and Korda signed her to a long-term contract. Merle was ambitious, but it was the 1930s and not culturally acceptable to be of mixed origins from India. Merle was forced to pretend that she was from Tasmania \u2013 birthplace of actor Errol Flynn. She introduced her mother as her maid, and used creams to lighten her complexion, sometimes enduring terrible skin reactions as a result. In 1940, Merle suffered damage to her complexion from a combination of cosmetic poisoning and an allergic reaction to sulfa drugs. Alexander Korda sent her to a skin specialist in New York, who administered several dermabrasion procedures, but the results were only partially successful. Without make-up, the damage to Merle\u2019s complexion was still evident.\n\nOver the years, Merle would spin a complicated series of stories about her origins, but Tasmania always remained her birthplace. She concocted a story that all her birth records had been destroyed in a fire. The year before she died, Merle finally admitted that the stories had not been true.\n\nMerle\u2019s relationship and subsequent marriage to Alexander Korda was to her advantage. She appeared in \u2018The Private Life of Don Juan\u2019 (1934) and was given leading roles such as Lady Blakely in \u2018The Scarlet Pimpernel\u2019 (1934), which also starred Leslie Howard. Through Korda, Merle secured Hollywood productions with Samuel Goldwyn and earned an Academy Award nomination for \u2018The Dark Angel\u2019 (1935) with David Niven. Merle also appeared in \u2018These Three\u2019 (1936), \u2018Beloved Enemy\u2019 (1936) and \u2018I, Claudius\u2019 (1937), \u2018The Divorce of Lady X\u2019 (1938) and \u2018The Cowboy and the Lady\u2019 (1938).\n\nMerle was involved in a car accident in London during the making of \u2018I, Claudius\u2019 and careful lighting and make-up helped to hide the imperfections she suffered as a result.\n\nIn 1939, Merle appeared in her most memorable role. For some years, Walter Wanger had been planning to make a film of Emily Bronte\u2019s \u2018Wuthering Heights\u2019. Wanger had Merle in mind for the part of Cathy, and Charles Boyer for Heathcliffe. Merle wanted Douglas Fairbanks Jr for the part. Laurence Olivier was reluctant to accept the part because he wanted his wife Vivien Leigh to play Cathy. In October 1938, Olivier finally relented, but his relationship with Merle remained strained throughout the shoot. He refused to utter a word to her when a scene was finished. Samuel Goldwyn insisted on presenting a Hollywood version of England for the movie, which maddened the director William Wyler and Laurence Olivier. The film was an ordeal to shoot, but got great reviews.\n\nMerle moved to America with the outbreak of war and married Alexander Korda in 1939. At their wedding, Korda presented her with a necklace once worn by Marie Antoinette. In 1942, Merle became Lady Korda when her husband was knighted. The couple divorced in 1945, and Merle married cinematographer Lucien Ballard, who devised a special lighting technique coined the \u2018Obie\u2019 (Oberon\u2019s nickname). The device was mounted on the side of a camera and lit the subject head-on, thus reducing imperfections. Both Oberon and Ballard were of mixed blood: he being part Cherokee-Indian.\n\nThroughout the 1940s, Merle appeared in 15 pictures, such as \u2018That Uncertain Feeling\u2019 (1941), \u2018The Lodger\u2019 (1944) and \u2018A Song To Remember\u2019 (1945). In \u2018A Song To Remember\u2019 Merle played Chopin\u2019s lover, George Sand, opposite Cornell Wilde. It was a curious part for Merle to play, but resulted in her biggest screen triumph since \u2018Wuthering Heights\u2019 in 1939.\n\nMerle continued to feature in major productions. After the early fifties, she appeared only occasionally on screen, but continued to make an impression. Among her pictures were \u2018Berlin Express\u2019 (1948), \u2018Pardon My French\u2019 (1951), \u2018Deep in My Heart\u2019 (1954) and \u2018D\u00e9sir\u00e9e\u2019 (1954). After \u2018The Price of Fear\u2019 (1956), Merle did not appear again on screen until \u2018Of Love And Desire\u2019 (1963). In between, Merle was the host of the TV series \u2018Assignment Foreign Legion\u2019 (1956).\n\nOne of Merle\u2019s last movie productions was the lavish \u2018Hotel\u2019 (1967), which was based on a novel written by Arthur Hailey. The movie also starred one of her lovers, Rod Taylor. Merle\u2019s last screen appearance was in \u2018Interval\u2019 (1973), which she also produced and co-directed.\n\nAfter Lucien Ballard, Merle married twice more. She married Italian-born Bruno Pagliai in 1957 and lived in Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico, with their two adopted children. In 1975, Merle married Dutch actor Robert Wolders, who was a quarter of a century younger than her. Among her many lovers were David Niven and Leslie Howard.\n\nMerle was psychic and may have foreseen her death. She suffered a stroke from which she did not recover and died on November 23, 1979, in Malibu, California. Merle was 68 and beautiful to the end. She was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.\n\nMerle Oberon had been an enigma for most of her life. Mysterious and radiant, she had the power to captivate those who met her with her charm, kindness and elegance. A woman who was not only beautiful on the outside, but also on the inside. Today, Merle Oberon still enchants audiences with her haunting beauty and unforgettable screen presence.\n\nWords: Alex Karas\n\nImage: Hayley Miller"}, {"url": "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-60587", "page_content": "Is Merle your ancestor?

Raised in India, she did not come to London until she was 17; she then progressed from cafe hostess (name Queenie O'Brien) to film extra. This in turn led to minor roles in undistinguished British films during 1930\u201332 (name Estelle Thompson), until she finally caught the eye of the Hungarian-British producer, Alexander Korda.\n\nKorda gave her the opportunity, personal patronage, and training which was to establish her as a beautiful star (name Merle Oberon) and acceptable actress. She was later to become his wife. Her first role of importance was as Anne Boleyn in Korda's film, The Private Life of Henry VIII, where her dark beauty and svelte grooming made a marked, if short-lived, impression among the King's succession of wives. Her appearance and panache won her many star roles in both London and Hollywood productions, including those in Korda's The Private Life of Don Juan, The Scarlet Pimpernel, and The Dark Angel.\n\nHer career seemed threatened when she was in a severe car accident during the shooting of I, Claudius, in which she was to have played Messalina opposite Charles Laughton. (Korda made her accident his reason for closing down this troubled production.) After successful facial surgery, however, she was able to return to the screen, and starred from 1938 through to the 1960s in a range of films, largely American. The more notable, perhaps, are The Divorce of Lady X, Wuthering Heights (with Laurence Olivier), Ernst Lubitsch's That Uncertain Feeling, Ren\u00e9 Clair's Forever and a Day, and as George Sand in the Chopin biographical film A Song to Remember. Daniel Mann directed her last film, Interval, which she produced herself and co-edited, about an older woman who finds happiness with a younger man, played by Robert Wolders. He went on to become her husband in real life.\n\n\u2014Roger Manvell"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/06/merle-oberon-oscars-best-actress", "page_content": "Magazine writers didn\u2019t know what to make of Merle Oberon when she took Hollywood by storm in the 1930s.

Photograph: United Artists/Allstar\n\nCritics condemned the declaration as too politically correct, even as it captured the complex tie that binds these women, each a product of her time. Where the 60-year-old Yeoh is a butt-kicking film pioneer on the brink of smashing a cultural ceiling for playing a role originally written for Jackie Chan, Oberon carefully hid her true identity to evade certain racial persecution and took that secret to her grave. It wasn\u2019t until decades after her death in 1979 at age 68 that the world learned her truth. That, not Oberon\u2019s eye-opening work in The Dark Angel, is what should rightly be hailed as her signature performance.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about the story of racial representation,\u201d says Shilpa Dav\u00e9, an assistant professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, \u201cMerle Oberon is a really important part. She brings a global aspect to it, the shades of brown.\u201d\n\nBorn Estelle Merle O\u2019Brien Thompson in what was then the British Indian city of Bombay, Oberon was determined to make the most of her innately fairer complexion. It became her ticket to a bigger world, the shroud that helped disguise the fact that she was the product of rape. Her birth father was the Anglo-Irish foreman of a tea plantation. Her mother, believed to have been of Sri Lankan and M\u0101ori ancestry, was just 14 when she gave birth in 1911. After centuries of intermixing, babies born from biracial relationships had evolved into a quiet shame \u2013 shunned by Britons and Indians alike.\n\nThe family nicknamed Oberon \u201cQueenie\u201d, as her birth coincided with Queen Mary and King George\u2019s visit to India. In an attempt to soften Oberon\u2019s lot in life, her grandmother raised her as her own and convinced her that her teenage mother was actually her half sister. But that wasn\u2019t enough to shield Oberon from the relentless taunts over her mixed heritage. At the age of three, after a cross-country move to Calcutta, she won a scholarship to one of the city\u2019s best all-girls private schools, only for classmates to drive her out with their overt racism. Films and the nightlife scene became her escape, and playing pretend key to her survival.\n\nMerle Oberon and Leslie Howard in The Scarlet Pimpernel. Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Alamy\n\nIn adolescence, Oberon began honing a posh accent and lightening her skin with bleach creams loaded with ammoniated mercury \u2013 a dangerous poison that had more of a weakening effect on Oberon\u2019s many male suitors. Those who didn\u2019t dump her outright after discovering her race helped sponsor her moves from India to France and England, where she worked for a time as a club hostess under the name Queenie O\u2019Brien. When she became romantically involved with the Hungarian-born British director Alexander Korda, Oberon\u2019s acting career clicked into high gear.\n\nA bit part as Anne Boleyn in the 1933 blockbuster The Private Life of Henry VIII announced her breakout. A mad scramble to come up with a cover story for the actor credited as \u201cMerle Oberon\u201d ensued. She told people she had been born in Tasmania \u201cbecause it was so far from the US and Europe and generally considered to be \u2018British\u2019 to its core\u201d, wrote Mar\u00e9e Delofski, director of the 2002 documentary The Trouble with Merle. (In her lifetime, Oberon visited Australia twice.) Oberon claimed her birth records had been destroyed in a fire. (Her half-brother, Harry, would discover them in Bombay, now Mumbai, after her death.) As for her much darker-skinned mother \u2013 her biological grandmother \u2013 Oberon presented her as a maid.\n\nSuch was the cost of making it in show business at a time when the US government was keen to crack down on indecency. Rather than leave it up to lawmakers, Hollywood seized on the opportunity to police itself, adopting a set of rules known as the Hays Code \u2013 which, among many other things, frowned upon interracial romance. With representational casting essentially made illegal, studios embraced yellow and blackface. And when Oberon\u2019s early work with Korda, whom she eventually married, led to a successful career under Samuel Goldwyn, it became in everyone\u2019s best interest to keep her identity a mystery. \u201cThink about it,\u201d says Dav\u00e9. \u201cShe was part of this cadre of actors and actresses that were loaned out to make all these movies. She was dependent on Goldwyn and Korda for her livelihood. I can see why she had to hide in that way. She had no power.\u201d\n\nNot even the 1936 best actress nomination brought Oberon any extra clout. For a start, the Oscars were barely a decade old and not yet the gold standard award. For another, the media was even tougher on female actors than they are now and held Oberon up for extra scrutiny.\n\nOberon gets a tip as she leaves for Royal Ascot, in a 1950 photo in London. Photograph: Norman Vigars/Getty Images\n\nOne critic derided Oberon\u2019s performance in the 1934 action film The Scarlet Pimpernel, citing a \u201ctendency to strongly orientalize her appearance by means of facial makeup and the slant of black brows\u201d. When a 1934 Los Angeles Times story used the term \u201cEuro-Asian\u201d to describe her, Oberon dismissed it as a coincidence. In an ad campaign for Max Factor, the cosmetics brand bragged about how its makeup turned her from \u201cslightly unreal and exotic\u201d to a \u201cbeautiful, charming girl\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s ironic that she would be Oscar nominated for The Dark Angel, a film about a first world war love affair that is complicated when the male protagonist suffers a battle injury that costs him his eyesight. Strangely, it was Oberon\u2019s only nomination, even as Hepburn and Davis became Oscar perennials and Oberon kept working into the early 70s. She starred opposite Laurence Olivier in 1939\u2019s Wuthering Heights and as herself in 1966\u2019s The Oscar, which is about the awards.\n\nStill, she soldiered on in spite of the damage she\u2019d caused to her skin from so much bleach cream and a car accident that left her disfigured and forced Korda to abandon production of the epic I, Claudius. To keep the cracks in Oberon\u2019s white facade from surfacing on screen, the cinematographer Lucien Ballard developed a special camera light for her to obscure her facial scars. This was after \u201cLady Korda\u201d had divorced her knighted director husband to marry Ballard.\n\nOn her downslope, Oberon reveled in her grand dame status, regaling magazine reporters with her true Hollywood stories, when she wasn\u2019t making the odd cameo on the game show What\u2019s My Line? or presenting a special achievement award to the Poseidon Adventure at the 1973 Oscars. Even then Charlton Heston called her \u201ca lady whose beauty is not only a legend, but a reality\u201d.\n\nBut even as times changed and Hollywood\u2019s aversion toward race mixing on screen began to relax, Oberon remained committed to her lie and quickly tightened up when it unraveled. When her nephew Michael Korda, then editor-in-chief at Simon and Schuster, tried to write a biography on Oberon, he says, she threatened to sue him and cut him out of her will if he used real details. So he turned it into the roman-\u00e0-clef Queenie, which became an ABC miniseries.\n\nAccording to the Australian historian Cassandra Pybus, a visit to Hobart in 1978 turned awkward for Oberon when officials couldn\u2019t find proof that she had been born in Tasmania. After confirming as much, Oberon ducked reporters and skipped a ceremony at a theater named in her honor before quietly returning home.\n\nA year later, she died in Malibu from a stroke."}], "Merle Oberon was Anglo-Indian actress.": [{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/06/merle-oberon-oscars-best-actress", "page_content": "Magazine writers didn\u2019t know what to make of Merle Oberon when she took Hollywood by storm in the 1930s.

This was after \u201cLady Korda\u201d had divorced her knighted director husband to marry Ballard.\n\nOn her downslope, Oberon reveled in her grand dame status, regaling magazine reporters with her true Hollywood stories, when she wasn\u2019t making the odd cameo on the game show What\u2019s My Line? or presenting a special achievement award to the Poseidon Adventure at the 1973 Oscars. Even then Charlton Heston called her \u201ca lady whose beauty is not only a legend, but a reality\u201d.\n\nBut even as times changed and Hollywood\u2019s aversion toward race mixing on screen began to relax, Oberon remained committed to her lie and quickly tightened up when it unraveled. When her nephew Michael Korda, then editor-in-chief at Simon and Schuster, tried to write a biography on Oberon, he says, she threatened to sue him and cut him out of her will if he used real details. So he turned it into the roman-\u00e0-clef Queenie, which became an ABC miniseries.\n\nAccording to the Australian historian Cassandra Pybus, a visit to Hobart in 1978 turned awkward for Oberon when officials couldn\u2019t find proof that she had been born in Tasmania. After confirming as much, Oberon ducked reporters and skipped a ceremony at a theater named in her honor before quietly returning home.\n\nA year later, she died in Malibu from a stroke."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Merle-Oberon", "page_content": "Merle Oberon, (born February 19, 1911, Bombay [now Mumbai], India\u2014died November 23, 1979, Los Angeles, California, U.S.), British and American film actress who appeared in more than 30 motion pictures.

But as a star in Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age, she kept her background a secret \u2013 passing herself off as white \u2013 throughout her life.\n\nMayukh Sen, a US-based writer and academic, first stumbled across her name in 2009 when he found out that Oberon was the first actor of South Asian origin to be nominated for an Oscar.\n\nHis fascination grew as he saw her films and dug deeper into her past. \u201cAs a queer person, I empathise with this feeling that you must hide a part of your identity to survive in a hostile society that isn\u2019t really ready to accept who you are,\u201d he says. Sen is now working on a biography to tell Oberon\u2019s story from a South Asian perspective.\n\nShe was born Estelle Merle O\u2019Brien Thompson in Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1911. Her mother was part-Sinhalese and part-Maori while her father was British.\n\nThe family moved to Calcutta (now Kolkata) in 1917 after Oberon\u2019s father died in 1914. She got her start in acting through the Calcutta Amateur Theatrical Society in the 1920.\n\nAlso read: Indian Cinema: A Story of Flawed Means and Perfect Endings\n\nIn 1925, after watching her first film, a silent movie, The Dark Angel, Oberon was inspired by its star, Vilma B\u00e1nky, to become an actress, according to Sen. She left for France in 1928 after an army colonel introduced her to director Rex Ingram who gave her bit parts in his films.\n\nOberon\u2019s mother Charlotte Selby, who had darker skin, followed her as her maid.\n\nA 2014 documentary called The Trouble with Merle later found that Selby was, in fact, Oberon\u2019s grandmother. Selby\u2019s daughter Constance had Oberon as a teenager but the two were reportedly raised together as sisters for some years.\n\nOberon\u2019s first big break came from Sir Alexander Korda \u2013 a filmmaker she would later marry \u2013 who cast her as Anne Boleyn in The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933).\n\nPublicists for Korda reportedly had to invent a background story to explain her race.\n\n\u201cTasmania was chosen as her new birthplace because it was so far from the US and Europe and was generally considered to be \u2018British\u2019 to its core,\u201d Mar\u00e9e Delofski, director of The Trouble with Merle, wrote in her notes on the documentary.\n\nOberon was passed off as an upper-class girl from Hobart who moved to India after her father died in a hunting accident, Delofski said.\n\nOberon, however, soon became an intrinsic part of local lore in Tasmania and, for the rest of her career, Australian media followed her closely with pride and curiosity. She even acknowledged Tasmania as her hometown but rarely mentioned Calcutta.\n\nBut Calcutta remembered her. \u201cIn the 1920s and 1930s, there were passing mentions of her in the memoirs of a lot of Englishmen,\u201d journalist Sunanda K. Datta Ray says.\n\n\u201cPeople claimed she was born in the city, that she was an operator at the switchboard of the telephone exchange and that she won a contest at Firpo\u2019s restaurant.\u201d\n\nAs she bagged more Hollywood films, Oberon moved to the US and in 1935 was nominated for an Oscar for her role in The Dark Angel.\n\nBut it was her performance in 1939\u2019s Wuthering Heights, opposite acting legend Laurence Olivier, that cemented her place in the industry.\n\nAlso read: \u2018Bridgerton\u2019 Brings the Regency Novel Back Into Fashion \u2013 But Did It Ever Go Away?\n\nShe was reportedly picked over Vivien Leigh, another India-born actress, because the team behind the film felt she was a bigger name, Sen says.\n\nA New York Times review of the film said Oberon had \u201cperfectly caught the restless, changeling spirit of the Bront\u00eb heroine\u201d.\n\nThe late 1930s catapulted Oberon to the so-called big league, Sen says. Her inner circle included figures like music composer Cole Porter and playwright No\u00ebl Coward.\n\nKorda and veteran producer Samuel Goldwyn helped Oberon assimilate, taming traits like her accent that would have given away her South Asian origins, Sen says.\n\nBut Oberon\u2019s secret weighed on her \u2013 even though her light-skinned complexion made it easier for her to pass off as white on screen.\n\n\u201cShe still often felt the need to silence frequent murmurs that she was mixed race. Film journalists of her era would note her tanner complexion,\u201d Sen says.\n\nSome accounts claim Oberon\u2019s skin was damaged by skin-whitening or bleaching treatments.\n\nAfter Oberon was injured and her face scarred in a car crash in 1937, cinematographer Lucien Ballard famously developed a technique that lit her in a way that would obscure her blemishes. (Oberon divorced Korda and married Ballard in 1945.)\n\n\u201cSome sources have suggested that the technique was also a way to \u2018whiten\u2019 Merle\u2019s face before the camera,\u201d Sen says.\n\nOberon\u2019s nephew Michael Korda, who published a family memoir called Charmed Lives in 1979, said he obscured details of her background after she threatened to sue him for including her real name and birthplace.\n\n\u201cI had assumed that enough water had passed under the bridge, but she still minded very much indeed about her past,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nThe charade became harder to maintain. In 1965, Oberon cancelled public appearances and cut short a trip to Australia after finding the local journalists to be curious about her background. Reports say she was distraught during her last visit to Tasmania in 1978 as questions around her identity continued to swirl.\n\nBut she never admitted the truth in public. She died in 1979, of a stroke.\n\nIn 1983, her Anglo-Indian heritage was revealed in a biography, Princess Merle: The Romantic Life of Merle Oberon. The authors found her birth record in Bombay, her baptismal certificate, and letters and photographs her Indian relatives had.\n\nThrough his book, Sen hopes to be able to convey the enormous pressures Oberon faced as a South Asian woman \u201cnavigating an industry that wasn\u2019t designed to accommodate her and producing such moving work while fighting those battles\u201d.\n\n\u201cDealing with those struggles couldn\u2019t have been easy. It feels more productive to extend grace and empathy to her than to judge.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.mic.com/articles/168949/the-surprising-story-of-merle-oberon-the-only-indian-actress-to-be-nominated-for-an-oscar", "page_content": "When the omniscient narrator read Dev Patel's name during the 89th annual Academy Awards nominations announcement in January, the actor extended an incredible record. He became just the 13th Asian actor ever nominated for an Oscar, and the third of Indian descent.\n\nThe second was Ben Kingsley, the British actor of Gujarati Indian lineage on his father's side. The first, however, was the only Indian actress ever nominated for an Oscar: Merle Oberon. But had Hollywood had its way, as it did most of her life, we likely never would have known she was Indian at all.\n\nAP\n\nOberon was born Estelle Merle O'Brien Thompson in 1911. For most of her life, she claimed she was born in Australia \u2014 but in fact, she was born in Mumbai. Her mother was Constance Selby, a 15-year-old girl from Ceylon (now known as Sri Lanka), but because Constance was so young, her mother Charlotte Selby raised Oberon as her own.\n\nShe moved to England in 1928, and quickly caught the attention of Hungarian director Alexander Korda. Korda cast her as Anne Boleyn in his 1933 film The Private Life of Henry VIII, crediting her under the name Merle Oberon. The role would become her breakout, boosting her professional and personal life. Films like The Scarlet Pimpernel, I, Claudius and Wuthering Heights filled her filmography; she earned her Oscar nomination for 1935's The Dark Angel. Simultaneously, Oberon embarked on a marriage with Korda, which would end in 1945. She married thrice more before passing away in 1979. Her last film was 1973's Interval.\n\nWhile working, Oberon reportedly refused to appear on camera without makeup \u2014 now understood to be about masking her darker complexion. She died without revealing the truth of her identity. It wasn't until the publication of her 1983 biography, written by Charles Higham, that her ancestry came to light.\n\nAP\n\nWhy did Oberon and Korda go to such lengths to mask her identity? The answer is simple: Hollywood at the time wouldn't have allowed it.\n\nIn 2002, the Australian Broadcast Company aired a documentary titled The Trouble With Merle. The documentary was an exploration of Oberon's identity as it relates to her celebrity. In the director's notes, helmer Mar\u00e9e Delofski wrote that her heritage wouldn't have found a home on film:\n\nIn the movies at that time, a woman of mixed race was not acceptable. The racism of the period made it very explicit: Merle's Anglo-Indian background was a major obstacle to her becoming a star. Tasmania was chosen as her new birthplace because it was so far from the USA and Europe and was generally considered to be \"British\" to its core. So Estelle Thompson from Bombay became Merle Oberon, a white upper class Hobart girl who moves to India from Tasmania after her distinguished father dies in a hunting accident.\n\nOberon was hardly the only actress working in that era to blur racial lines. John Gavin, born John Anthony Golenor Pablos, consistently played white characters before he became President Ronald Reagan's ambassador to Mexico later in life. Raquel Welch was Bolivian, and refused to change her name to something more palatable for white audiences. Light-skinned black actress Fredi Washington actually used makeup to look darker-skinned on film.\n\nBut Oberon is perhaps the most famous example of disguised ancestry in Hollywood. How much she knew is up for debate; Delofski has questions about how much was her work and how much Hollywood (and Korda) designed for her.\n\n\"Maybe Merle didn't even know who her mother was,\" the director said. \"The studio reconstructed her history and she had to live that life story and keep living that life story.\"\n\nAP\n\nHollywood has changed in the intervening years, though some vestiges of that stigma remain. Sisters Meg and Jennifer Tilly go by their mother's maiden name rather than their Chinese father's. In other ways, the world has opened: For example, actors like Hailee Steinfeld and Darren Criss speak openly about their part-Filipino heritage.\n\nOberon, on the other hand, remains a fascinating figure in Oscar history. She carries a unique distinction that she herself never confirmed in life: that she is the only Indian actress ever nominated for an Oscar. While inclusion remains a massive issue for the film and TV industries, it's growing increasingly hopeful that she'll be joined in the record books by another Indian actress (Quantico's Priyanka Chopra, perhaps?) very soon.\n\nSunday night in London, Patel became the first actor of Indian descent to win a BAFTA \u2014 the British equivalent of an Oscar \u2014 for his work in Lion. Decades after Oberon's career peak, actors of Indian descent like Patel, Chopra and more are cracking through the very barriers that kept Oberon's identity concealed. It's a slow process, but a historic one."}, {"url": "https://ethnicelebs.com/merle-oberon", "page_content": "Birth Name: Estelle Merle O\u2019Brien Thompson\n\nDate of Birth: 19 February, 1911\n\nPlace of Birth: Girgaum, Emmanuel, Bombay, British India (now Girgaon, Mumbai)\n\nDate of Death: 23 November, 1979\n\nPlace of Death: Malibu, California, U.S.\n\nEthnicity: English, Irish, Indian, M\u0101ori\n\nMerle Oberon was a British actress.

Making her debut in films as an extra she soon made her mark in British films after being spotted by producer-director Alexander Korda and she landed doing a small but significant role of Anne Boleyn in \u2018The Private Life of Henry VIII\u2019. This was followed by another successful performance as Lady Blakeney, n\u00e9e Marguerite St. Just in British adventure film \u2018The Scarlet Pimpernel\u2019 directed by Harold Young. Her quick success in British films made her try her hand in the US film industry where renowned Hollywood producer Samuel Goldwyn gave her several plum roles, particularly in \u2018The Dark Angel\u2019, the performance in which fetched her \u2018Academy Award for Best Actress\u2019 nomination.

All through her life she concealed her mixed ancestry and even concocted a story claiming her birthplace as Tasmania, Australia. However such story was debunked following her demise. Some sources claim her parents to be Arthur Terrence O'Brien Thompson, a mechanical engineer from England who served \u2018Indian Railways\u2019 and Charlotte Selby, a Eurasian lady with partial M\u0101ori background hailing from Ceylon (at present Srilanka). According to sources Charlotte gave birth to a daughter called Constance in Ceylon, out of her relationship with Irish foreman Henry Alfred Selby, when she was 14-year-old. When Constance was 12-year-old, she gave birth to Merle. However, Merle was raised by Charlotte as her younger daughter and as younger sister of Constance. Merle\u2019s birth certificate lists Arthur Thompson as her father with the first name misspelt as \u2018Arther\u2019. Later Constance married Alexander Soares and together had four children, Stanislaus, Harry, Edna and Douglas. Arthur Thompson began serving the \u2018British army\u2019 in 1914. He succumbed to pneumonia during the \u2018Battle of the Somme\u2019, the largest battle of \u2018First World War\u2019 on the Western Front. After living in an impoverished condition in Bombay, Charlotte moved to Calcutta (at present Kolkata) with Merle in 1917. There Merle joined one of the prestigious schools of the city, \u2018La Martiniere Calcutta\u2019 for girls after receiving foundation scholarship. However, her parental origin haunted her here too where she was ridiculed of her unconventional heritage. Eventually she left school and studied at home. Years later when Harry traced Merle\u2019s birth certificate in records of the Indian government, he was shocked to find that she was actually his sister and not maternal aunt. He tried to meet her in Los Angeles but she did not agree to see him. Harry did not reveal this fact to biographer Charles Higham who was working on her biography but later shared it with Maree Delofski, who made the 2002 documentary on Merle, \u2018The Trouble with Merle\u2019, produced by \u2018Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019.\n\nCareer\n\nOberon was crazy about films and would frequent the nightclubs of Calcutta. According to Sunanda K. Datta-Ray, an Indian journalist, Oberon served for a while as a telephone operator using the name Queenie Thompson. Her first performance was with an amateur theater group \u2018Calcutta Amateur Dramatic Society\u2019. She got acquainted with Colonel Ben Finney, a former actor, at \u2018Firpo\u2019s Restaurant\u2019 in 1929, where she won a contest, and soon started dating him. However the relationship did not took off as Finney distanced himself from her upon knowing about her mixed ancestry. However she relocated to France taking word of Finney to introduce her to Irish film director Rex Ingram. Her exotic look made Ingram hire her as an extra in 1929 British silent drama film \u2018The Three Passions\u2019 that marked her first step in the film industry. Thereafter she performed in several films for the next few years mostly doing trivial roles which went without any credit. Her breakthrough came in 1933 when she landed up playing Anne Boleyn in the historical biopic \u2018The Private Life of Henry VIII\u2019 starring opposite Charles Laughton, after being spotted by the film\u2019s director Alexander Korda. Huge success of the film got her other leading roles by the turn of the year in films like \u2018The Battle\u2019, \u2018The Private Life of Don Juan\u2019 and \u2018The Scarlet Pimpernel\u2019, all of which were released in 1934. Her success graph in British films combined with her close association with Korda made her think of a career in Hollywood. Korda helped her take the next step forward by selling shares of her contract to Jewish Polish American film producer Samuel Goldwyn who on the other hand provided her with good opportunities in Hollywood. She went on to do several films in Hollywood including those produced by Goldwyn like \u2018Beloved Enemy\u2019 and \u2018These Three\u2019 in 1936 and by others like \u2018Folies Berg\u00e8re de Paris\u2019 (1935) and \u2018The Dark Angel\u2019 (1935) of which the latter fetched her the sole \u2018Academy Award for Best Actress\u2019 nomination of her career. She met with a severe car accident that damaged her face while making of the 1937 film \u2018I, Claudius\u2019, which was never completed. However the incident could not deter her from her goal and she went on to do several notable films reviving her beauty and charm with the aid of good make-up and prudent lighting. Some such films include 'Wuthering Heights\u2019 starring opposite Laurence Olivier in 1939; \u2018Lydia\u2019 (1941); \u2018A Song to Remember\u2019 (1945); \u2018Night in Paradise\u2019 (1946); \u2018Berlin Express\u2019 (1948); and \u2018D\u00e9sir\u00e9e\u2019 (1954).\n\nPersonal Life & Legacy\n\nOn June 3, 1939, she married Alexander Korda in Antibes and after Korda was knighted in 1942, she became Lady Korda. \u2018Princess Merle\u2019, her biography by Charles Higham and Roy Moseley apprised that in 1940 her complexion suffered damage due to allergic reactions. Korda made arrangements for her skin treatment in New York City where she had to undergo many dermabrasion procedures which gave partial results and without makeup the flaws of her skin would remain noticeable. On June 4, 1945, the couple divorced. On 26th June 1945, Merle married cinematographer Lucien Ballard. A special camera light was introduced by Ballard to tactfully hide her facial flaws on film which became famous as the \u2018Obie\u2019. Their marriage lasted till February 11, 1949. Her third marriage was with Italy-born industrialist, Bruno Pagliai from July 28, 1957 to 1973 with whom she adopted two children, Francesca Pagliai and Bruno Pagliai Jr. Her fourth marriage with Dutch actor Robert Wolders, 25 years younger to her, lasted till her death. On November 23, 1979, she succumbed to a stroke in Malibu, California and was buried at \u2018Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery\u2019 in Glendale, California.\n\nTrivia\n\n\u2018Hollywood Walk of Fame\u2019 has a star on her, for motion pictures at 6250 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n// Famous Aquarius Celebrities peoples\n\nJessii Vee Check out all that you wanted to know about Jessii Vee, the famous Canadian Vlogger & YouTube Personality; her birthday, her family and personal life, her boyfriends, fun trivia facts and more.

She began her film career in British films as Anne Boleyn in The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933). After her success in The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934), she travelled to the United States to make films for Samuel Goldwyn. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in The Dark Angel (1935). A traffic collision in 1937 caused facial injuries that could have ended her career, but she soon followed this with her most renowned performance in Wuthering Heights (1939).\n\nThroughout her adult life, in order to conceal her Indian heritage she maintained the fiction that she was born in Tasmania, Australia; she concocted a story that all her school records had been destroyed in a fire, which meant it could be neither proven nor disproven. She maintained these fictions throughout her professional life. The year before she died she finally admitted this story was not true, and records located since her death have confirmed her true origin.\n\nSpouse(s):\n\nAlexander Korda (1939\u201345)\n\nLucien Ballard (1945\u201349)\n\nBruno Pagliai (1957\u201373)\n\nRobert Wolders (1975\u201379)\n\nChildren:\n\nFrancesca Pagliai (daughter)\n\nBruno Pagliai Jr. (son)\n\nEarly life\n\nEstelle Merle Thompson was born in Bombay, British India on 19 February 1911. According to some sources, her birth name was Estelle Merle O'Brien Thompson. Merle was given \"Queenie\" as a nickname, in honour of Queen Mary, who visited India along with King George V in 1911.\n\nOver the years, Oberon obscured her parentage. Some sources claim Merle's parents to have been Arthur Terrence O'Brien Thompson, a British mechanical engineer from Darlington, who worked in Indian Railways, and Charlotte Selby, a Eurasian from Ceylon with partial M\u0101ori heritage.\n\nHowever, at the age of fourteen, Charlotte had in Ceylon given birth to her first child Constance, the result of a relationship with Henry Alfred Selby, an Irish foreman of a tea planter, and some sources have claimed that Constance, twelve at the time of Merle's birth, and not Charlotte, was Merle's biological mother. Whatever the true relationship, Charlotte raised Merle as her own child and as Constance's sister. Charlotte's partner, Arthur Thompson, was listed as the father in Merle's birth certificate, with the forename misspelled as \"Arther\".\n\nConstance eventually married and had four other children, Edna, Douglas, Harry and Stanislaus (Stan) with her husband Alexander Soares. Edna and Douglas moved at an early age to the UK and Harry later in life moved to Toronto, Canada and retained Constance's maiden name, Selby. Stanislaus was the only child to keep his father's last name of Soares and he currently resides in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada. All the siblings reportedly believed Merle to be their aunt (the sister of their mother Constance), when in fact she was their half-sister.\n\nWhen Harry Selby tracked down Merle's birth certificate in Indian government records in Bombay (Mumbai), he was surprised to discover he was in fact Merle's brother and not her nephew. He attempted to visit her in Los Angeles, but she refused to see him. Harry withheld this information from Oberon's biographer Charles Higham, only eventually revealing it to Maree Delofski, the creator of The Trouble with Merle, a 2002 documentary produced by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, which investigated the various conflicting versions of Merle's origin.\n\nIn 1914, Arthur Thompson joined the British Army and later died of pneumonia on the Western Front during the Battle of the Somme. Merle, with her \"mother\" (really her grandmother), led an impoverished existence in shabby Bombay flats for a few years. Then, in 1917, they moved to better circumstances in Calcutta. Oberon received a foundation scholarship to attend La Martiniere Calcutta for Girls, one of the best private schools in Calcutta. There, she was constantly taunted for her unconventional parentage and eventually quit school and received her lessons at home.\n\nOberon first performed with the Calcutta Amateur Dramatic Society. She was also completely enamored of the films and enjoyed going out to nightclubs. Indian journalist Sunanda K. Datta-Ray claimed that Merle worked as a telephone operator in Calcutta under the name Queenie Thomson, and won a contest at Firpo's Restaurant there, before the outset of her film career.\n\nIn 1929, Merle met a former actor named Colonel Ben Finney at Firpo's, and dated him. However, when he saw Oberon's dark-skinned mother one night at her flat, and realised Oberon was mixed-race, he decided to end the relationship. However, Finney promised to introduce her to Rex Ingram of Victorine Studios, if she was prepared to travel to France. which she readily did. After packing all their belongings and moving to France, Oberon and her mother found that their supposed benefactor avoided them, although he had left a good word for Oberon with Ingram at the studios in Nice. Ingram liked Oberon's exotic appearance and quickly hired her to be an extra in a party scene in a film named The Three Passions.\n\nActing career\n\nOberon arrived in England for the first time in 1928, aged 17. Initially she worked as a club hostess under the name Queenie O'Brien and played in minor and unbilled roles in various films. \"I couldn't dance or sing or write or paint. The only possible opening seemed to be in some line in which I could use my face. This was, in fact, no better than a hundred other faces, but it did possess a fortunately photogenic quality,\" she modestly told a journalist at Film Weekly in 1939. In view of the information discovered since this 1939 article (see preceding section) this should be seen as part of a myth perpetrated by Oberon, since apparently she did not reach Europe until 1929.\n\nHer film career received a major boost when the director Alexander Korda took an interest and gave her a small but prominent role, under the name Merle Oberon, as Anne Boleyn in The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933) opposite Charles Laughton. The film became a major success and she was then given leading roles, such as Lady Blakeney in The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934) with Leslie Howard, who became her lover for a while.\n\nOberon's career benefited from her relationship, and later marriage, to Korda. He sold \"shares\" of her contract to producer Samuel Goldwyn, who gave her good vehicles in Hollywood. Her \"mother\" stayed behind in England. Oberon earned her sole Academy Award for Best Actress nomination for The Dark Angel (1935) produced by Goldwyn. Around this time she had a serious romance with David Niven, and according to his authorized biography, even wanted to marry him, but he wasn't faithful to her.\n\nShe was selected to star in Korda's film I, Claudius (1937) as Messalina, but a serious car accident resulted in filming being abandoned. Oberon was scarred for life, but skilled lighting technicians were able to hide her injuries from cinema audiences. She went on to appear as Cathy in her most famous film, Wuthering Heights (opposite Laurence Olivier; 1939), as George Sand in A Song to Remember (1945) and as the Empress Josephine in D\u00e9sir\u00e9e (1954).\n\nAccording to Princess Merle, the biography written by Charles Higham with Roy Moseley, Oberon suffered even further damage to her complexion in 1940 from a combination of cosmetic poisoning and an allergic reaction to sulfa drugs. Alexander Korda sent her to a skin specialist in New York City, where she underwent several dermabrasion procedures. The results, however, were only partially successful; without makeup, one could see noticeable pitting and indentation of her skin.\n\nCharlotte died in 1937. In 1949 Oberon commissioned paintings of her mother from an old photograph. The paintings hung in all her homes until Oberon's own death in 1979.\n\nMerle Oberon had a brief affair in 1941 with Richard Hillary, an RAF fighter pilot who had been badly burned in the Battle of Britain. They met while he was on a good-will tour of the United States. He later became well known as the author of a best-selling book, The Last Enemy.\n\nMerle Oberon became Lady Korda when her husband was knighted in 1942. At the time, the couple were based at Hills House in Denham, England. She divorced him in 1945, to marry cinematographer Lucien Ballard. Ballard devised a special camera light for her to eliminate her facial scars on film. The light became known as the \"Obie\".\n\nShe married twice more, to Italian-born industrialist, Bruno Pagliai (with whom she adopted two children; they lived in Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico) and Dutch actor Robert Wolders \u2013 later companion to actresses Audrey Hepburn and Leslie Caron \u2013 before her retirement in Malibu, California, where she died, aged 68, after suffering a stroke. She was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.\n\nMerle Oberon has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (at 6250 Hollywood Boulevard) for her contributions to Motion Pictures.\n\nMichael Korda, nephew of Alexander Korda, wrote a roman \u00e0 clef about Oberon after her death entitled Queenie. This was also turned into a television miniseries starring Mia Sara.\n\nDisputed birthplace\n\nOberon claimed that she was born and raised in Tasmania, Australia. The story of her alleged Tasmanian connections was comprehensively debunked after her death.\n\nOberon is known to have been to Australia only twice. Her first visit was in 1965, on a film promotion. Although a visit to Hobart was scheduled, she became ill after journalists in Sydney pressed her for details of her early life, and she left for Mexico shortly afterwards. In 1978, the year before her death, she agreed to visit Hobart for a Lord Mayoral reception. The Lord Mayor of Hobart became aware shortly before the reception that there was no proof she had been born in Tasmania, but went ahead with the reception to save face. However, shortly after arriving at the reception, Oberon denied she had been born in Tasmania, to the disappointment of many. She then excused herself, claiming illness; whether ill or not, this meant she was unavailable to answer any more questions about her background. On the way to the reception, she had told her driver that as a child she was on a ship with her father, who became ill when it was passing Hobart. They were taken ashore so he could be treated, and as a result she spent some of her early years on the island. This story, too, seems to have been a fabrication. During her Hobart stay, she remained in her hotel, gave no other interviews, and did not visit the theatre named in her honour.\n\nFilmography\n\nFeatures\n\nThe Three Passions (1928)\n\nA Warm Corner (1930)\n\nAlf's Button (1930)\n\nNever Trouble Trouble (1931)\n\nThe W Plan (1931)\n\nFascination (1931)\n\nFor the Love of Mike (1932)\n\nReserved for Ladies (1932)\n\nEbb Tide (1932)\n\nAren't We All?

Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s unfinished novel\u2014will look familiar. Matt Bomer plays a wunderkind producer based on MGM production head Irving Thalberg. Kelsey Grammer plays his boss, a figure inspired by Louis B. Mayer. But the most fascinating character may be Margo Taft, an actress played by Jennifer Beals who\u2019s concealing an explosive secret. The character is based on Merle Oberon, a golden-age movie star who was known for her great beauty\u2014and the similar secret she took with her to the grave.\n\nThe raven-haired, brown-eyed stunner, probably best known for playing Cathy opposite Laurence Olivier\u2019s Heathcliff in the 1939 classic Wuthering Heights, spent her life hiding her biracial identity, \u201cpassing\u201d for white. Like Oberon, Margo likely fears that the truth about her heritage will torpedo her career during a time when racial prejudice was rampant, and silver-screen faces were lily-white, save for a black servant or two.\n\nOberon\u2019s career took off after a move to London at age 17, when English director Alexander Korda cast her in a small but pivotal role as Anne Boleyn in The Private Life of Henry VIII in 1933. The film\u2019s success led to leading-lady status, and films including The Scarlet Pimpernel, The Dark Angel\u2014for which she was Oscar-nominated\u2014That Uncertain Feeling, and A Song to Remember.\n\nBut it was Oberon\u2019s personal story that was worthy of a Hollywood script. The actress, known more for her striking looks\u2014often described as \u201cexotic\u201d\u2014than her acting abilities, claimed she was born in Tasmania (like her contemporary Errol Flynn). She said that after her British Army officer father died, she was raised by her aristocratic Indian godparents. It\u2019s believed Korda, who became the first of Oberon\u2019s four husbands, concocted the fake origin story.\n\nNicknamed \u201cQueenie\u201d in honor of King George V and Queen Mary\u2019s 1911 visit to India the year she was born in the city now known as Mumbai, Estelle Merle O\u2019Brien Thompson\u2019s true provenance wasn\u2019t revealed until four years after her death in 1979. The biography Merle: A Biography of Merle Oberon exposed what seems to have been known by those in her inner circle: Oberon was Anglo-Indian. Her mother\u2014or the woman believed to be her mother (more about that later)\u2014came from what\u2019s now Sri Lanka, and was part M\u0101ori; her father, Arthur Thompson, was a British mechanical engineer. Ironically, the regal actress\u2014she became \u201cLady Korda\u201d when her first husband was knighted in 1942\u2014had an impoverished childhood in India.\n\nIn 1985, her nephew Michael Korda, then editor in chief of Simon & Schuster, penned the roman \u00e0 clef Queenie about his aunt, and told The Los Angeles Times that her Eurasian ancestry \u201cwas an open secret\u201d within his family. He also said that when he wrote a 1979 family memoir, Oberon threatened to sue him for including her real name and birthplace, so he had to obscure them.\n\nIn The Last Tycoon, which premieres July 28, Beals\u2019s Margo negotiates her own deals and rides roughshod over directors, demanding they show her their genitals before she\u2019ll shoot a frame of film. She also has a secret: she\u2019s passing for white\u2014with her black mother by her side, masquerading as her maid\u2014much as Oberon\u2019s mother, Charlotte Selby, did when the actress lived in England.\n\nWhile Beals knew Margo was based on Oberon, she says her goal for her character, who wears \u201clayers of masks,\u201d was to make her distinct. Yet her interpretation of the fiercely independent actress may also offer insight into Oberon\u2019s own mindset. \u201cMargo is willing to suppress so much in order to get as far as she can,\u201d says Beals. Oberon was just as tenacious: after a 1937 car accident damaged one side of her face, she hid her scars with makeup and good lighting. Then, on the set of the 1944 filmThe Lodger, cinematographer Lucien Ballard mounted a light on the side of a camera, which diffused her flaws. The \u201cObie,\u201d as the device became known, went into wide use\u2014and Oberon left Korda to marry Ballard in 1945."}, {"url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/first-non-while-anne-boleyn-merle-oberon-hid-race-hollywood/", "page_content": "With dark, lustrous hair and mysterious eyes, Merle Oberon seemed the perfect choice to play Anne Boleyn in the 1933 film The Private Life of Henry VIII. Henry\u2019s second wife is described in the historical records as possessing \u201cblack hair and an oval face of sallow complexion\u201d and Oberon\u2019s otherworldly beauty appeared to capture the essence of one of the most tragic figures in British history. Only years later would the true significance of the casting become clear: Oberon, it was revealed, had broke new ground as the first non-white actress to play a British royal on screen.\n\nThe importance of dismantling outmoded boundaries around casting and representation is once again at the forefront of conversation with news that Jodie Turner-Smith is to portray Boleyn in a new Channel 5 retelling of the royal\u2019s fateful journey from throne room to chopping block. This has been rightly hailed a breakthrough, as black actors have previously had the opportunity to play British royalty on just a handful of occasions.\n\nPrior to Turner-Smith, there was Golda Rosheuvel as Queen Charlotte in Netflix\u2019s bawdy blockbuster Bridgerton. And in 2016 Sophie Okonedo was Queen Margaret, wife of Henry VI, in the BBC\u2019s The Hollow Crown: The War of The Roses (adapted from Shakespeare\u2019s Henry VI parts one, two and three).\n\nBut before all of those there was Merle Oberon, a black and white era star and Oscar nominee who went to lengths to conceal her Asian heritage and to present herself as white. Only after her death in November 1979, would the truth of her background emerge.\n\nTo her, it was a secret to be carried to the grave.
