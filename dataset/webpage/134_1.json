Root will join former Congressman and Libertarian Party presidential candidate Bob Barr on the Libertarian ticket in Nov.\n\nEndorsed by Barr following the selection of the presidential candidate, Root was selected as the vice president after two rounds of voting.\n\n\u201cRoot brings a rarely seen excitement to the political process,\u201d says Libertarian Party National Media Coordinator Andrew Davis. \u201cHis fire and passion are sure to ignite voters who are bored with the stale politics of the two-party system. Root\u2019s spirit combined with Barr\u2019s political experience creates a dynamite ticket that will blow apart the status quo politics of Republicans and Democrats.\u201d\n\nThe Libertarian Party is America\u2019s third largest political party, founded in 1971 as an alternative to the two main political parties. You can find more information on the Libertarian Party by visiting www.LP.org . The Libertarian Party proudly stands for smaller government, lower taxes and more freedom.\n\nFor more information, or to arrange a media interview, please call Andrew Davis at (202) 333-0008 during normal business hours, or at (202) 731-0002 during any other time."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/05/fashion/05nite.html", "page_content": "\u201cThat\u2019s what my life has been about, winning,\u201d Mr. Root said. \u201cThe Libertarians have been a debate society since 1971. No one ever thought about winning. And then I came along.\u201d\n\nNot that he thinks he and his running mate will triumph in 2008. \u201cBob Barr and I are going to get a million to three million votes this year,\u201d he predicted, between bites of chicken. \u201cIn 2012 I expect to duplicate Ross Perot\u2019s number of 19 million. In 2016 I expect to be a credible third-party candidate, and in 2020 I plan to win.\u201d\n\nThe last member of Mr. Root\u2019s entourage, Roy Pomerantz, arrived late. Both graduated from Columbia College in 1983. \u201cI donated to Wayne\u2019s campaign on the understanding that he would donate an equal amount to our 25th reunion,\u201d said Mr. Pomerantz, head of a company that sells infant gear and pet toys. \u201cIt was the first time he anted up.\u201d\n\nNeither one knew their famous Columbia classmate, Barack Obama. \u201cI\u2019ve not only not met him,\u201d Mr. Root said, \u201cI\u2019ve not met anybody who met him.\u201d\n\nThere was a timeout while Mr. Root took a call from ESPN about that evening\u2019s Eagles-Cowboys game. The late money was flowing to Philadelphia, but Mr. Root chose Dallas. \u201cI\u2019m a contrarian,\u201d he said.

Here are some answers.\n\nHe says he\u2019s Jewish and has interesting ideas about Jewish identity.\n\nIn the Fox column, the 58-year-old Root refers to his \u201cJewish butcher father, David Root.\u201d He told The Jewish Telegraphic Agency that all four grandparents are Jewish and that his DNA shows him \u201c99.5\u201d percent European Jewish.\n\nRoot, who lives in Las Vegas, says he founded the Republican Jewish Coalition chapter in Nevada. Matt Brooks, the RJC\u2019s executive director, confirmed that Root was involved in the group but says he has not been for more than a decade. (Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate who is a major funder of the RJC and Republican candidates along with Jewish causes, hired Root to write a column for the Las Vegas Review-Journal after buying the newspaper in 2015 \u2014 a move that raised eyebrows among fans of the paper\u2019s hard news tradition.)\n\nRoot told JTA he \u201ctook Jesus Christ as a savior\u201d about 30 years ago, but he still considers himself Jewish.\n\nNotably, several other Trump defenders are Jews turned Christian, including Trump\u2019s lawyer, Jay Sekulow, and the right-wing activist and lawyer Larry Klayman.\n\nThe lessons Root takes away from being born Jewish comport with hoary Jewish stereotypes \u2014 some flattering, others less so.\n\n\u201cI am a Jew and you can\u2019t take away from a person being a Jew,\u201d he said, noting that Islamist extremists and white supremacists would target him as Jewish. \u201cI\u2019ve got Jewish blood and passion and zeal.\u201d\n\n\u201cJesus Christ was a Jew, and the CEO of the Christian religion,\u201d Root said, adding that he, too, was born Jewish and was a CEO.\n\nRoot, who calls himself a \u201ccapitalist evangelist\u201d told Daniel Davis, a syndicated radio host, that his Jewish background informed his philosophy. Jews were \u201crelentless,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey like to hammer down the door till they get what they want,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the Fox column, Root said Trump \u201cis your typical Jewish parent.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald\u2019s children are all Ivy League graduates \u2014 just like my daughter who recently graduated magna cum laude from Harvard,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cDonald is handing his business over to his children.

I believe Trump is our miracle.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s been on the Trump train longer than most.\n\nRoot, the Libertarian Party\u2019s vice presidential nominee in 2008, announced his support for the businessman and reality star almost as soon as Trump announced he was running in June 2015. He emceed one of the candidate\u2019s first rallies, in Las Vegas. Trump, unsurprisingly, praised Root\u2019s book \u201cAngry White Male: How the Donald Trump Phenomenon is Changing America\u201d published that year.\n\nRoot, who ran a sports gambling business, told JTA that the Republican Party has not done enough to shake Jewish voters out of their adherence to Democrats.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m one of the best salesmen in America, and I believe I can sell conservatism to Jews,\u201d he said.\n\nRoot went on to say that he would soon announce that he will head a \u201cmajor Jewish organization\u201d and planned to set up a Jews for Trump political action committee.\n\nHe\u2019s called a conspiracy theorist \u2014 he says he asks questions.\n\nLiberal outlets have long singled out Root for peddling conspiracy theories, including that the 2017 shooting massacre in Las Vegas that killed 58 concertgoers was the work of Islamist extremists. No motive has been ascribed for the attack, which was carried out by a white non-Muslim man named Stephen Paddock.\n\nRoot has also questioned whether white supremacists were behind the deadly violence at a neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, and whether there is more to the 2016 murder of Seth Rich, a Jewish Democratic Party staffer. (Police believe Rich was killed in a robbery gone bad; conspiracy theorists believe Hillary Clinton was behind the killing.)\n\nRoot told JTA that conspiracy theories proliferate on the right and the left, and that he does not necessarily endorse the theories \u2014 he asks questions. That, he said, was a very American thing to do, and that pluralities of Americans do not buy into the accepted narratives behind the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963 or the suicide of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein this month.\n\n\u201cI question everything coming out of the mouths of government officials,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re egomaniacs who lie about everything to protect themselves.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/2019-08-22/ty-article/who-is-wayne-allyn-root-the-host-trump-quoted-saying-hes-like-the-king-of-israel/0000017f-e3e0-d804-ad7f-f3fa087e0000", "page_content": "On Wednesday morning, President Donald Trump quoted a conservative talk show host named Wayne Allyn Root to defend comments he had made the day before that angered many in the Jewish community: that Jews who vote for Democrats show \u201ca total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you to Wayne Allyn Root for the very nice words,\u201d Trump said before quoting something Root has said previously about the president.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is the greatest President for Jews and for Israel in the history of the world, not just America, he is the best President for Israel in the history of the world \u2026 and the Jewish people in Israel love him \u2026 like he\u2019s the King of Israel.

He is purposely overwhelming the U.S. economy to create systemic failure, economic crisis and social chaos \u2014 thereby destroying capitalism and our country from within. Barack Obama is my college classmate (Columbia University, class of '83). As Glenn Beck correctly predicted from day one, Obama is following the plan of Cloward & Piven, two professors at Columbia University. They outlined a plan to socialize America by overwhelming the system with government spending and entitlement demands. Add up the clues below. Taken individually they're alarming. Taken as a whole, it is a brilliant, Machiavellian game plan to turn the United States into a socialist/Marxist state with a permanent majority that desperately needs government for survival ... and can be counted on to always vote for bigger government. Why not? They have no responsibility to pay for it.

He penned a biweekly political opinion column published the Las Vegas Review-Journal, and his entry for 6 June 2010 was the article excerpted above, entitled \"Obama's agenda: Overwhelm the system,\" in which he opined that President Obama is \"purposely overwhelming the U.S. economy to create systemic failure, economic crisis and social chaos.\"\n\nSome online-circulated versions of this column are entitled \"Obama's college roommate speaks out,\" but that heading reflects a misreading of the word \"classmate,\" as Wayne Allyn Root never was, or claimed to be, Barack Obama's roommate \u2014 Root merely attended Columbia University at the same time as Barack Obama did and later claimed (despite substantial evidence to the contrary) that neither he nor anyone else attending Columbia during that time had ever heard of or met Barack Obama.\n\nRoot's credentials as a political prognosticator are rather suspect, as he predicted in May 2012 that Barack Obama would lose the upcoming presidential election to Republican candidate Mitt Romney \"in a landslide.\" (Obama handily won with 62% of the electoral vote.)"}, {"url": "https://www.creators.com/author/wayne-allyn-root", "page_content": "Wayne Allyn Root (aka WAR) is a high-energy, passionate, outspoken, unapologetic conservative media star.

I\u2019m opening speaker 4 President of United States,\u201d Wayne Allyn Root, a Las Vegas Review-Journal columnist and former Libertarian Party vice-presidential nominee, boasted Thursday morning on Twitter, hours before President Trump headlines a Las Vegas rally to elect a Republican ticket in the state.\n\n\u201c@realDonaldTrump personally requested Wayne Root as opening speaker to welcome crowd,\u201d the right-wing commentator claimed. \u201cThank u Mr. President.\u201d\n\nThe opening act makes sense considering Root\u2019s long-running, often sycophantic friendship with the president.\n\nTrump wrote a glowing blurb for Root\u2019s 2015 book Angry White Male: How the Donald Trump Phenomenon is Changing America (which, coincidentally, featured a foreword by shady ex-Trump confidant Roger Stone). Root, in turn, emceed the future president\u2019s 2015 campaign rally in Vegas, and later offered to become Trump\u2019s own \u201cKarl Rove\u201d should he win the election. Earlier this year, Root bragged about spending a \u201cmagical evening\u201d with President Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nAnd in many ways, Root is the Las Vegas version of Trump: He\u2019s a ruthless self-promoter from New York; a heavily airbrushed and often-gaudy TV personality whose flashy antics and love of chintz have made him synonymous with a city.\n\nMoreover, just like the president, Root is now a bombastic right-wing media personality obsessed with the Clintons, Obama, the physical appearance of liberals, and the batshit conspiracy theories that comport with his worldview.\n\nPerhaps most infamously, when gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire and killed 58 people at a country-music festival on the Vegas strip last fall, Root proclaimed on Twitter, without a shred of evidence: \u201cThis is real thing. Clearly coordinated Muslim terror attack. PRAY for our Vegas police. PRAY for victims. VERY bad. Awful.\u201d\n\nAfter sustained outcry over falsely linking a deadly mass shooting to Islamic terror, Root refused to apologize or back down, instead claiming he heard about the connection from \u201ccredible news sources,\u201d which, at that time, meant far-right conspiratorial websites like The Gateway Pundit. \u201cI report it as I hear it,\u201d Root added.\n\nDays later, on his radio show, Root went off the rails, once again claiming \u201cISIS fingerprints were all over this thing,\u201d before bashing the critics of his radical conspiracy-mongering: \u201cI have nothing to worry about so I laugh in their liberal commie faces, their liberal commie Muslim-sympathizer faces. Screw you! Come and get me. Screw you.\u201d\n\nMonths earlier, after it was revealed that a white nationalist allegedly murdered a female anti-racism protester during the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Root shared a particularly deranged theory: \u201cSuch B.S,\u201d he said of the alleged killer\u2019s far-right politics. \u201cProbably paid actors & infiltrators hired by Soros. No conservative I\u2019ve ever met commits violence. EVER.\u201d\n\nBeyond waxing crazy about deadly news events, Root has also been a leading voice for the right-wing conspiracy theory that Democratic officials ordered the murder of former DNC staffer Seth Rich for allegedly passing stolen emails to WikiLeaks.\n\n\u201cHe was murdered because he was the guy that gave all the DNC files to Julian Assange and Wikileaks,\u201d Root asserted on his radio show in June 2018, as Right Wing Watch first reported. \u201cThey just killed him for no reason and nobody seems to be interested in finding the killer. And it sure seems to me to point to leading Democrats\u2014Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the DNC, the Clintons, Hillary Clinton, all the above, Donna Brazile, all the above, seem to be mixed up in this, they all had a motive to kill this guy.\u201d\n\nAt other points, he has suggested that Rich\u2019s murderer was former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, former President Bill Clinton, or Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta.\n\nIn one particularly bizarre tweet, Root wrote: \u201cI think Seth Rich murder is HUGE issue,\u201d boasting in strikingly Trumpian language that \u201cI understand people and psychology. Something is VERY wrong.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, Root was an early supporter of Trump\u2019s crusade to prove true the completely debunked conspiracy theory that President Obama was not born in the United States. \u201cGood job Donald Trump,\u201d Root tweeted in 2011, long before the birther-in-chief became commander-in-chief. \u201cI can produce my birth certificate in 1 minute. I have it in my safe.\u201d\n\nThe Vegas stalwart would later go on to claim he never was a birther, but simply someone who believed Obama hid dark secrets hidden beneath mundane documents like his college transcripts. Seemingly missing the connotative connection to birtherism, Root once told Hannity that he believes Obama was a \u201cforeign exchange student\u201d at Columbia University.\n\nHe has certainly never shied away from other racially tinged attacks on the first black U.S. president. Obama was a \u201cMarxist, anti-American, anti-Israel, globalist, middle class-hating, Muslim sympathizer,\u201d Root has repeatedly written. At one point, Root called Obama the \u201cfirst Muslim president\u201d in a column that sought to reveal the ex-president\u2018s \u201ctrue religious loyalties.\u201d\n\nThroughout Obama\u2019s eight years in office, Root claimed he was a \u201cManchurian candidate\u201d who was sent\u2014possibly by the Bilderberg Group\u2014to \u201cdestroy this country\u201d from within and \u201ckill all of us.\u201d He further maintained that Obama was gay, referring to him as \u201cBathhouse Barry\u201d and claiming that his \u201cfriends in Chicago\u201d told him the president had a \u201csordid past.\u201d\n\nWhile opening a 2016 Trump rally in Vegas, Root reportedly received rapturous applause by suggesting Clinton and her top aide Huma Abedin will meet the same deadly fate as two popular film characters who drove off a cliff. \u201cWe all get our wish,\" Root said of the Clinton-Abedin relationship. \u201cThe ending is like Thelma and Louise.\u201d\n\nBeyond the usual bevy of far-right conspiracy theories and inflammatory rhetoric, Root has seemingly fixated on the sexuality and physical appearances of his liberal enemies.\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating President Trump\u2019s ties to Russia, Root posited earlier this year, because he has \u201cpenis envy.\u201d The radio host declared: \u201cMueller\u2019s is smaller than Trump\u2019s.\u201d According to Right Wing Watch, Root has claimed that \u201call liberal men are gay\u201d and \u201call liberal women are ugly.\u201d\n\nHe has lamented how HBO host John Oliver married a \u201cSTUNNING. GORGEOUS\u2026 Trophy Wife\u201d instead of \u201cplain liberal women.\u201d And he has suggested that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough only became critical of Trump so he could have \u201csex w/hot blonde\u201d Mika Brzezinski, his fianc\u00e9e and co-host.\n\nDuring one bonkers radio segment, Root expressed dismay that some of his social-media critics have referred to him as an old man. \u201cThere\u2019s no difference in when you call someone \u2018old\u2019 versus when you call someone the \u2018N-word,\u2019\u201d the radio-host claimed. \u201cThere\u2019s no difference. It\u2019s a lack of respect. It\u2019s filthy. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\n\nIn a normal world, Root\u2019s level of unabashed buffoonery would put him more at home with the QAnon-flag and Seth Rich poster-toting weirdos that will flock to the Las Vegas Convention Center on Thursday night. But instead he\u2019s the speaker a U.S. president reportedly \u201cpersonally requested\u201d to open for him at a nationally televised event."}, {"url": "https://rootforamerica.com/", "page_content": "WAR Story\n\nThe Bio of Wayne Allyn Root\n\nWayne Allyn Root has been branded by media across the globe as \u201cthe Capitalist Evangelist.\u201d A former Libertarian Vice Presidential nominee, Wayne is a fierce, enthusiastic and relentless defender of Reagan conservatism, Libertarianism, economic freedom and capitalism.\n\n\u201cWayne Allyn Root is one of the great conservative thinkers in America\u201d \u2013 Bill Cunningham, host \u201cThe Bill Cunningham Show\u201d Premiere Radio Network\n\nHe is both a political and business personality in the national media.
