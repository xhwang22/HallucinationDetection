Swanson believed laboratories weren't the only source of new scientific discoveries. Swanson, a specialist in the relationship between natural and computer languages, thought electronic databases also held the key to medical knowledge.\n\nA trailblazing information scientist, Swanson died Nov. 18 at age 88.\n\nConcerned that excessive specialization could inhibit scientific creativity, Swanson pioneered the field of literature-based discovery, which uses existing research to create new knowledge. The three-term dean of the University\u2019s Graduate Library School and professor emeritus in the Humanities Division believed that unearthing unseen links between two distinct areas of study could yield new discoveries\u2014what he called \u201cundiscovered public knowledge.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, Swanson received the ASIST Award of Merit, the highest honor from the American Society for Information Science & Technology, for his work.\n\nArrowsmith: \u2018An intellectual adventure\u2019\n\nSwanson famously tested his theory of undiscovered public knowledge with a 1986 paper in which he made a provocative connection between dietary fish oil and Raynaud\u2019s disease, a circulatory disorder.\n\nIn a search of the Medline database, which houses millions of scientific journal abstracts, Swanson found a common thread in research on Raynaud's disease and dietary fish oil. His hunting turned up numerous articles that described high blood viscosity in patients with Raynaud\u2019s disease; in a separate search, he found a body of research that showed dietary fish oil could reduce blood viscosity.\n\nThe implication of bringing these two literatures together was powerful: could fish oil, Swanson wondered, be used to treat Raynaud\u2019s disease?\n\nA clinical trial three years later validated the use of fish oil for patients with Raynaud\u2019s disease. Swanson later hypothesized a connection between migraine headaches and magnesium deficiency that was also subsequently supported by clinical research.\n\nSpurred on by these findings, Swanson and Neil Smalheiser of the University of Illinois at Chicago developed Arrowsmith, a piece of software that assists investigators in identifying connections between two sets of Medline articles.\n\nArrowsmith (named after the 1925 Sinclair Lewis novel) was aimed at building a \u201csystematic, computational\u201d method to find possible links among articles, Smalheiser said. \u201cThe computer was not supposed to generate discoveries, but it was supposed to identify and put together these potential assertions.\u201d\n\nThe Arrowsmith model proved influential, and the approach Swanson and Smalheiser developed has been adapted to study the correlations of genes with diseases and find possible new uses for medications.\n\nDespite the impact of Swanson and Smalheiser's work on Arrowsmith, \u201cWe never saw it as anything other than an intellectual adventure,\u201d Smalheiser said.\n\n\u2018Experiments with information\u2019 not salamanders\n\n\u201cDon was doing science, without dissecting a salamander,\u201d said Mark Olsen, assistant director of the American and French Research on the Treasury of the French Language (ARTFL) project, a major digital humanities project that was influenced by Swanson\u2019s work. \u201cHe was doing experiments with information.\u201d\n\nSwanson began his career studying physics as an undergraduate at the California Institute of Technology. He received his MA in physics from Rice University in 1947 and his PhD, also in physics, from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1952.\n\nEven in their early days, computers were a source of fascination for Swanson. \u201cI think he was always dazzled by the idea of the computer,\u201d said his wife, Patricia Swanson.\n\nSwanson worked as a computer systems analyst at Hughes Research & Development and research scientist at Ramo-Wooldridge Corp. & TRW, Inc., before he joined the UChicago faculty in 1963 as dean of the Graduate Library School (which closed in 1990). Swanson's background as a physical scientist set him apart from the seven previous deans of the school, who represented a variety of other disciplines.\n\nAt the GLS, Swanson initially focused on computer-aided information retrieval, an entirely new area of study at the time.\n\n\u201cAt the time Don began working on it, people simply couldn\u2019t imagine that you could retrieve information with a computer,\u201d said his colleague Abe Bookstein, professor emeritus in the Humanities. \u201cIn a field that was very qualitative, Don was instrumental in introducing quantitative formal techniques.\u201d\n\nHe was also a rigorous and encouraging teacher, according to his former GLS student Charles Blair, who remembered Swanson for his \u201cvery clean, organized and methodical approach to his subject.\u201d\n\nSwanson happily lent his expertise to colleagues around the University. In the early days of the ARTFL project, Prof. Robert Morrissey came to Swanson for advice on how to handle organization of the massive new database. \u201cHe told me, \u2018What this project needs is a little sunshine and water,\u201d remembered Morrissey, the Benjamin Franklin Professor of French Literature and director of ARTFL. \u201cHe was very generous with his time.\u201d\n\nThat generosity was not unusual for Swanson, according to Smalheiser\u2014Swanson went \u201cout of his way to be nice and encouraging,\u201d Smalheiser said.\n\nSwanson\u2019s quiet manner belied a mischievous sense of humor that led him to write satiric articles, for example, \u201cNew Horizons in Psychoanalysis: Treatment of Necrosistic Personality Disorders,\u201d in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine (1986).\n\nNot only intellectually witty but also physically fit, Swanson was an avid runner who completed a half-marathon at the age of 80.\n\nBut his work was by far his greatest passion, according to Patricia Swanson. \u201cHe was always trying to do something better,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Swanson is survived by his son, Richard B. Swanson; and his daughter, Judith A. Swanson, PhD\u201987. Another son, Douglas A. Swanson, died in 2004.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in Swanson\u2019s honor may be made to the University of Chicago Library, the Nature Conservancy or the Heritage Foundation."}, {"url": "https://blog.sciencenet.cn/blog-1557-8018.html", "page_content": "Abstract\n\nWith the rapid development of science and technology, specialties are split into subspecialties further and there are poor communications across specialties. Information developed in one area of research may be of value in another without anyone becoming aware of the fact, so there should be many implicit undiscovered connections of interest which can not be retrieved by conventional computer-aided literature search. Don R. Swanson, professor of information science at the University of Chicago, solved this problem.\n\nHe developed an information method called non-interactive literature-based discovery and designed Arrowsmith, which is an interactive software and search strategies. This paper introduces the background\n\n, concept and application of Swanson\u2019s information method in detail and the reviews of American information scientists on Swanson\u2019s\n\nmethod and explains the author\u2019s opinion.

ACM Author-Izer is a unique, link-based, self-archiving service that enables ACM authors to generate and post links on either their home page or institutional repository for visitors to download the definitive version of their articles for free. Q. What articles are eligible for ACM Author-Izer?\n\nA. ACM Author-Izer can be applied to all the articles authors have ever published with ACM. It is also available to authors who will have articles published in ACM publications in the future.\n\nQ. Are there any restrictions on authors to use this service?\n\nA. No. An author does not need to subscribe to the ACM Digital Library nor even be a member of ACM.\n\nQ. What are the requirements to use this service?\n\nA. To access ACM Author-Izer, authors need to have a free ACM web account, must have an ACM Author Profile page in the Digital Library, and must take ownership of their Author Profile page.\n\nQ. What is an ACM Author Profile Page?\n\nA. The Author Profile Page initially collects all the professional information known about authors from the publications record as known by the ACM Digital Library. The Author Profile Page supplies a quick snapshot of an author's contribution to the field and some rudimentary measures of influence upon it. Over time, the contents of the Author Profile page may expand at the direction of the community. Please visit the ACM Author Profile documentation page for more background information on these pages.\n\nQ. How do I find my Author Profile page and take ownership?\n\nA. You will need to take the following steps: Create a free ACM Web Account Sign-In to the ACM Digital Library Find your Author Profile Page by searching the ACM Digital Library for your name Find the result you authored (where your author name is a clickable link) Click on your name to go to the Author Profile Page Click the \"Add Personal Information\" link on the Author Profile Page Wait for ACM review and approval; generally less than 24 hours\n\n\n\nQ. Why does my photo not appear?\n\nA. Make sure that the image you submit is in .jpg or .gif format and that the file name does not contain special characters\n\nQ. What if I cannot find the Add Personal Information function on my author page?\n\nA. The ACM account linked to your profile page is different than the one you are logged into. Please logout and login to the account associated with your Author Profile Page.\n\nQ. What happens if an author changes the location of his bibliography or moves to a new institution?\n\nA. Should authors change institutions or sites, they can utilize ACM Author-Izer to disable old links and re-authorize new links for free downloads from a new location.\n\nQ. What happens if an author provides a URL that redirects to the author\u2019s personal bibliography page?\n\nA. The service will not provide a free download from the ACM Digital Library. Instead the person who uses that link will simply go to the Citation Page for that article in the ACM Digital Library where the article may be accessed under the usual subscription rules.\n\n\n\nHowever, if the author provides the target page URL, any link that redirects to that target page will enable a free download from the Service.\n\nQ. What happens if the author\u2019s bibliography lives on a page with several aliases?\n\nA. Only one alias will work, whichever one is registered as the page containing the author\u2019s bibliography. ACM has no technical solution to this problem at this time.\n\nQ. Why should authors use ACM Author-Izer?\n\nA. ACM Author-Izer lets visitors to authors\u2019 personal home pages download articles for no charge from the ACM Digital Library. It allows authors to dynamically display real-time download and citation statistics for each \u201cauthorized\u201d article on their personal site.\n\nQ. Does ACM Author-Izer provide benefits for authors?\n\nA. Downloads of definitive articles via Author-Izer links on the authors\u2019 personal web page are captured in official ACM statistics to more accurately reflect usage and impact measurements.\n\n\n\nAuthors who do not use ACM Author-Izer links will not have downloads from their local, personal bibliographies counted. They do, however, retain the existing right to post author-prepared preprint versions on their home pages or institutional repositories with DOI pointers to the definitive version permanently maintained in the ACM Digital Library.\n\nQ. How does ACM Author-Izer benefit the computing community?\n\nA. ACM Author-Izer expands the visibility and dissemination of the definitive version of ACM articles. It is based on ACM\u2019s strong belief that the computing community should have the widest possible access to the definitive versions of scholarly literature. By linking authors\u2019 personal bibliography with the ACM Digital Library, user confusion over article versioning should be reduced over time.\n\n\n\nIn making ACM Author-Izer a free service to both authors and visitors to their websites, ACM is emphasizing its continuing commitment to the interests of its authors and to the computing community in ways that are consistent with its existing subscription-based access model.\n\nQ. Why can\u2019t I find my most recent publication in my ACM Author Profile Page?\n\nA. There is a time delay between publication and the process which associates that publication with an Author Profile Page. Right now, that process usually takes 4-8 weeks."}, {"url": "https://handwiki.org/wiki/Biography:Don_R._Swanson", "page_content": "Don R.

He first appeared in Disney's Steamboat Willie, along with Minnie. Although they were in two previous shorts, this was the first to be distributed. Steamboat Willie took advantage of the new technology and was a \"talkie\" - music was coordinated with the animation. It became the most popular cartoon of its day.\n\nIn 1943, he was only 15 years old when on June 20th through June 22nd, the Detroit Race Riot erupted at Belle Isle Park. The rioting spread throughout the city (made worse by false rumors of attacks on blacks and whites) and resulted in the deployment of 6,000 Federal troops. 34 people were killed, (25 of them black) - mostly by white police or National Guardsmen, 433 were wounded (75 percent of them black) and an estimated $2 million of property was destroyed. The same summer, there were riots in Beaumont, Texas and Harlem, New York.\n\nIn 1955, when he was 27 years old, in January, President Eisenhower sent direct aid to South Vietnam. In February, U.S. advisors were sent to train troops.\n\nIn 1977, when he was 49 years old, on January 21st, President Carter pardoned \"draft dodgers\" - men who avoided the draft during the Vietnam War. He fulfilled a campaign promise with the pardon. But it only applied to civilian evaders - the estimated 500,000 to 1 million active-duty personnel who went AWOL were not included.\n\nIn 1992, in the year of Donald F Swanson's passing, on April 29th, riots began in Los Angeles after the \"Rodney King\" verdict was issued.

He was an integral part of the Department of English until his retirement in 1998. All who encountered him remembers him with great affection and respect. Dr. Henry Limouze, emeritus chair, writes, \u201cDon Swanson was a colleague, scholar, teacher, reader, and friend. We were lucky to have him, and he will be missed.\u201d\n\nHis wide-ranging knowledge of nineteenth and twentieth-century English and American literature made him a core part of the department\u2019s offerings, and he was instrumental in the department creating and developing its graduate program. During the 1990s, he served as graduate director. Dr. Henry Limouze notes, \u201cI will always be grateful for this. Those who were faculty during that decade may remember curricular reform, planning, mission statements, assessment, \u2018visioning,\u2019 and more planning. The English department could seem like a whirligig that spun crazily while we strove to absorb the latest in higher education, or fought battles to defend the humanities, or just tried to keep up with our own scholarship and grading. But Don was the \u2018still center\u2019 of our department. He had seen worse battles. Don had served in the Merchant Marine during World War II, when unarmed cargo ships were routinely sunk by U-Boats.\u201d\n\nHis calmness and good humor combined with his depth and breadth of knowledge to make him an engaging and versatile teacher and conversationalist. Dr. MaryBeth Pringle recalls that \u201cDon's head was always off somewhere among the stars of literature and history. There was often a surprising story to hear or fact to learn when you encountered him.\u201d From his graduate work at Rutgers, Don had tales to tell of meeting Dylan Thomas and befriending the poet John Malcom Brinnin. A visit to his office for graduate advising could include a from-memory recitation of Chaucer to demonstrate how the Prologue might have sounded, a tale from his days in the Merchant Marine that illuminated an aspect of Conrad\u2019s work, or a kindly reminder that he would provide refreshments for the evening graduate seminar.\n\nHis wide-ranging curiosity and dedication to knowledge was on display during a sabbatical during which he investigated the genre of crime fiction. Not content to simply read, he enrolled in the Dayton Police Academy\u2019s Neighborhood Assistance Officer training course, which included ride-along beat work. He followed this by then writing his own crime novel to see how the practice of crime writing could shed light on the genre.\n\nDon\u2019s devotion to his wife, Willa, was much admired and remarked upon, and he is remembered above all for his gentle spirit and kindness. A 1981 memo from Dr. MaryBeth Pringle speaks to his unassuming and generous nature. A disabled student needed to be hospitalized, and Don volunteered to tutor him in the hospital rather than have him be unable to complete the class. Dr. Pringle wrote: \u201cI\u2019ve known for years now that you\u2019re a special kind of teaching professional. This particular act of kindness doesn\u2019t surprise me, but I\u2019m moved by it all the same.\u201d\n\nThat best portion of a good man's life,\n\nHis little, nameless, unremembered acts\n\nOf kindness and of love.\n\nWilliam Wordsworth\n\nNo doubt there were many more of these acts in Donald Swanson\u2019s life, but the faculty, staff, and students of the Department of English were privileged to know of, and be the recipients of, many of them.\n\n"}], "Don R. Swanson is an American professor emeritus of library and information science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.": [{"url": "https://news.uchicago.edu/story/don-r-swanson-information-science-pioneer-1924-2012", "page_content": "Don R. Swanson believed laboratories weren't the only source of new scientific discoveries. Swanson, a specialist in the relationship between natural and computer languages, thought electronic databases also held the key to medical knowledge.\n\nA trailblazing information scientist, Swanson died Nov. 18 at age 88.\n\nConcerned that excessive specialization could inhibit scientific creativity, Swanson pioneered the field of literature-based discovery, which uses existing research to create new knowledge. The three-term dean of the University\u2019s Graduate Library School and professor emeritus in the Humanities Division believed that unearthing unseen links between two distinct areas of study could yield new discoveries\u2014what he called \u201cundiscovered public knowledge.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, Swanson received the ASIST Award of Merit, the highest honor from the American Society for Information Science & Technology, for his work.\n\nArrowsmith: \u2018An intellectual adventure\u2019\n\nSwanson famously tested his theory of undiscovered public knowledge with a 1986 paper in which he made a provocative connection between dietary fish oil and Raynaud\u2019s disease, a circulatory disorder.\n\nIn a search of the Medline database, which houses millions of scientific journal abstracts, Swanson found a common thread in research on Raynaud's disease and dietary fish oil. His hunting turned up numerous articles that described high blood viscosity in patients with Raynaud\u2019s disease; in a separate search, he found a body of research that showed dietary fish oil could reduce blood viscosity.\n\nThe implication of bringing these two literatures together was powerful: could fish oil, Swanson wondered, be used to treat Raynaud\u2019s disease?\n\nA clinical trial three years later validated the use of fish oil for patients with Raynaud\u2019s disease. Swanson later hypothesized a connection between migraine headaches and magnesium deficiency that was also subsequently supported by clinical research.\n\nSpurred on by these findings, Swanson and Neil Smalheiser of the University of Illinois at Chicago developed Arrowsmith, a piece of software that assists investigators in identifying connections between two sets of Medline articles.\n\nArrowsmith (named after the 1925 Sinclair Lewis novel) was aimed at building a \u201csystematic, computational\u201d method to find possible links among articles, Smalheiser said. \u201cThe computer was not supposed to generate discoveries, but it was supposed to identify and put together these potential assertions.\u201d\n\nThe Arrowsmith model proved influential, and the approach Swanson and Smalheiser developed has been adapted to study the correlations of genes with diseases and find possible new uses for medications.\n\nDespite the impact of Swanson and Smalheiser's work on Arrowsmith, \u201cWe never saw it as anything other than an intellectual adventure,\u201d Smalheiser said.\n\n\u2018Experiments with information\u2019 not salamanders\n\n\u201cDon was doing science, without dissecting a salamander,\u201d said Mark Olsen, assistant director of the American and French Research on the Treasury of the French Language (ARTFL) project, a major digital humanities project that was influenced by Swanson\u2019s work. \u201cHe was doing experiments with information.\u201d\n\nSwanson began his career studying physics as an undergraduate at the California Institute of Technology. He received his MA in physics from Rice University in 1947 and his PhD, also in physics, from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1952.\n\nEven in their early days, computers were a source of fascination for Swanson. \u201cI think he was always dazzled by the idea of the computer,\u201d said his wife, Patricia Swanson.\n\nSwanson worked as a computer systems analyst at Hughes Research & Development and research scientist at Ramo-Wooldridge Corp. & TRW, Inc., before he joined the UChicago faculty in 1963 as dean of the Graduate Library School (which closed in 1990). Swanson's background as a physical scientist set him apart from the seven previous deans of the school, who represented a variety of other disciplines.\n\nAt the GLS, Swanson initially focused on computer-aided information retrieval, an entirely new area of study at the time.\n\n\u201cAt the time Don began working on it, people simply couldn\u2019t imagine that you could retrieve information with a computer,\u201d said his colleague Abe Bookstein, professor emeritus in the Humanities. \u201cIn a field that was very qualitative, Don was instrumental in introducing quantitative formal techniques.\u201d\n\nHe was also a rigorous and encouraging teacher, according to his former GLS student Charles Blair, who remembered Swanson for his \u201cvery clean, organized and methodical approach to his subject.\u201d\n\nSwanson happily lent his expertise to colleagues around the University. In the early days of the ARTFL project, Prof. Robert Morrissey came to Swanson for advice on how to handle organization of the massive new database. \u201cHe told me, \u2018What this project needs is a little sunshine and water,\u201d remembered Morrissey, the Benjamin Franklin Professor of French Literature and director of ARTFL. \u201cHe was very generous with his time.\u201d\n\nThat generosity was not unusual for Swanson, according to Smalheiser\u2014Swanson went \u201cout of his way to be nice and encouraging,\u201d Smalheiser said.\n\nSwanson\u2019s quiet manner belied a mischievous sense of humor that led him to write satiric articles, for example, \u201cNew Horizons in Psychoanalysis: Treatment of Necrosistic Personality Disorders,\u201d in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine (1986).\n\nNot only intellectually witty but also physically fit, Swanson was an avid runner who completed a half-marathon at the age of 80.\n\nBut his work was by far his greatest passion, according to Patricia Swanson. \u201cHe was always trying to do something better,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Swanson is survived by his son, Richard B. Swanson; and his daughter, Judith A. Swanson, PhD\u201987. Another son, Douglas A. Swanson, died in 2004.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in Swanson\u2019s honor may be made to the University of Chicago Library, the Nature Conservancy or the Heritage Foundation."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Don_R._Swanson", "page_content": "Don R.

ACM Author-Izer is a unique, link-based, self-archiving service that enables ACM authors to generate and post links on either their home page or institutional repository for visitors to download the definitive version of their articles for free. Q. What articles are eligible for ACM Author-Izer?\n\nA. ACM Author-Izer can be applied to all the articles authors have ever published with ACM. It is also available to authors who will have articles published in ACM publications in the future.\n\nQ. Are there any restrictions on authors to use this service?\n\nA. No. An author does not need to subscribe to the ACM Digital Library nor even be a member of ACM.\n\nQ. What are the requirements to use this service?\n\nA. To access ACM Author-Izer, authors need to have a free ACM web account, must have an ACM Author Profile page in the Digital Library, and must take ownership of their Author Profile page.\n\nQ. What is an ACM Author Profile Page?\n\nA. The Author Profile Page initially collects all the professional information known about authors from the publications record as known by the ACM Digital Library. The Author Profile Page supplies a quick snapshot of an author's contribution to the field and some rudimentary measures of influence upon it. Over time, the contents of the Author Profile page may expand at the direction of the community. Please visit the ACM Author Profile documentation page for more background information on these pages.\n\nQ. How do I find my Author Profile page and take ownership?\n\nA. You will need to take the following steps: Create a free ACM Web Account Sign-In to the ACM Digital Library Find your Author Profile Page by searching the ACM Digital Library for your name Find the result you authored (where your author name is a clickable link) Click on your name to go to the Author Profile Page Click the \"Add Personal Information\" link on the Author Profile Page Wait for ACM review and approval; generally less than 24 hours\n\n\n\nQ. Why does my photo not appear?\n\nA. Make sure that the image you submit is in .jpg or .gif format and that the file name does not contain special characters\n\nQ. What if I cannot find the Add Personal Information function on my author page?\n\nA. The ACM account linked to your profile page is different than the one you are logged into. Please logout and login to the account associated with your Author Profile Page.\n\nQ. What happens if an author changes the location of his bibliography or moves to a new institution?\n\nA. Should authors change institutions or sites, they can utilize ACM Author-Izer to disable old links and re-authorize new links for free downloads from a new location.\n\nQ. What happens if an author provides a URL that redirects to the author\u2019s personal bibliography page?\n\nA. The service will not provide a free download from the ACM Digital Library. Instead the person who uses that link will simply go to the Citation Page for that article in the ACM Digital Library where the article may be accessed under the usual subscription rules.\n\n\n\nHowever, if the author provides the target page URL, any link that redirects to that target page will enable a free download from the Service.\n\nQ. What happens if the author\u2019s bibliography lives on a page with several aliases?\n\nA. Only one alias will work, whichever one is registered as the page containing the author\u2019s bibliography. ACM has no technical solution to this problem at this time.\n\nQ. Why should authors use ACM Author-Izer?\n\nA. ACM Author-Izer lets visitors to authors\u2019 personal home pages download articles for no charge from the ACM Digital Library. It allows authors to dynamically display real-time download and citation statistics for each \u201cauthorized\u201d article on their personal site.\n\nQ. Does ACM Author-Izer provide benefits for authors?\n\nA. Downloads of definitive articles via Author-Izer links on the authors\u2019 personal web page are captured in official ACM statistics to more accurately reflect usage and impact measurements.\n\n\n\nAuthors who do not use ACM Author-Izer links will not have downloads from their local, personal bibliographies counted. They do, however, retain the existing right to post author-prepared preprint versions on their home pages or institutional repositories with DOI pointers to the definitive version permanently maintained in the ACM Digital Library.\n\nQ. How does ACM Author-Izer benefit the computing community?\n\nA. ACM Author-Izer expands the visibility and dissemination of the definitive version of ACM articles. It is based on ACM\u2019s strong belief that the computing community should have the widest possible access to the definitive versions of scholarly literature. By linking authors\u2019 personal bibliography with the ACM Digital Library, user confusion over article versioning should be reduced over time.\n\n\n\nIn making ACM Author-Izer a free service to both authors and visitors to their websites, ACM is emphasizing its continuing commitment to the interests of its authors and to the computing community in ways that are consistent with its existing subscription-based access model.\n\nQ. Why can\u2019t I find my most recent publication in my ACM Author Profile Page?\n\nA. There is a time delay between publication and the process which associates that publication with an Author Profile Page. Right now, that process usually takes 4-8 weeks."}, {"url": "https://handwiki.org/wiki/Biography:Don_R._Swanson", "page_content": "Don R.

Swanson (October 10, 1924 \u2013 November 18, 2012) was an American information scientist, most known for his work in literature-based discovery in the biomedical domain. His particular method has been used as a model for further work, and is often referred to as Swanson linking. He was an investigator in the Arrowsmith System project,[1] which seeks to determine meaningful links between Medline articles to identify previously undiscovered public knowledge. He had been professor emeritus of the University of Chicago since 1996, and remained active in a post-retirement appointment until his health began to decline in 2009.\n\nSwanson received his B.S. in Physics at Caltech, Pasadena, California in 1945, followed by an M.A at Rice Institute, Houston, Texas, two years later, and then a PhD in Theoretical Physics from the University of California at Berkeley in 1952. He worked as a physicist at various laboratories until 1963, when he was made a professor and served as dean of the Graduate School of Library Science at the University of Chicago until 1972 and again from 1977 to 1979 and 1987 to 1989.\n\nIn 2000, he was awarded the ASIST Award of Merit, the highest honor of the society, for his \"lifetime achievements in research and scholarship.\"[2]\n\nYouTube Encyclopedic\n\n1 / 2 Views: 1 538 012 3 565 593\n\nNick Offerman Answers Woodworking Questions From Twitter | Tech Support | WIRED\n\nThe basics on a Speed square Transcription\n\nReferences\n\nWorks\n\n1986a : \"Undiscovered public knowledge.\" Library Quarterly 56(2): 103\u2013118.\n\n: \"Undiscovered public knowledge.\" 56(2): 103\u2013118. 1986b : \"Fish oil, Raynaud's syndrome, and undiscovered public knowledge.\" Perspectives in Biology and Medicine 30(1): 7\u201318.\n\n: \"Fish oil, Raynaud's syndrome, and undiscovered public knowledge.\" 30(1): 7\u201318. 1987 : \"Two medical literatures that are logically but not bibliographically connected.\" Journal of the American Society of Information Science 38(4): 228\u2013233.\n\n: \"Two medical literatures that are logically but not bibliographically connected.\" 38(4): 228\u2013233. 1988 : \"Migraine and magnesium: Eleven neglected connections.\" Perspectives in Biology and Medicine 31(4): 526\u2013557.\n\n: \"Migraine and magnesium: Eleven neglected connections.\" 31(4): 526\u2013557. 1989a : \"Online search for logically-related noninteractive medical literature: A systematic trial-and-error strategy.\" Journal of the American Society of Information Science 40: 356\u2013358.\n\n: \"Online search for logically-related noninteractive medical literature: A systematic trial-and-error strategy.\" 40: 356\u2013358. 1989b : \"A second example of mutually-isolated medical literatures related by implicit, unnoticed connections.\" Journal of the American Society of Information Science 40: 432\u2013435.\n\n: \"A second example of mutually-isolated medical literatures related by implicit, unnoticed connections.\" 40: 432\u2013435. 1990a : \"Somatomedin C and arginine: Implicit connections between mutually-isolated literatures,\" Perspectives in Biology and Medicine 33 (1990): 157\u2013186.\n\n: \"Somatomedin C and arginine: Implicit connections between mutually-isolated literatures,\" 33 (1990): 157\u2013186. 1990b : \"Medical literature as a potential source of new knowledge.\" bulletin of the Medical Library Association 78(1) 29\u201337.\n\n: \"Medical literature as a potential source of new knowledge.\" 78(1) 29\u201337. 1990c : \"Integrative mechanisms in the growth of knowledge: A legacy of Manfred Kochen.\" Information Processing & Management 26(1): 9\u201316.\n\n: \"Integrative mechanisms in the growth of knowledge: A legacy of Manfred Kochen.\" 26(1): 9\u201316. 1990d : \"The absence of co-citation as a clue to undiscovered causal connections.\" In: C.

Suppose one field of science has linked medical condition A with symptom B, and a completely different field has linked dietary deficiency C with that same symptom B. The literature then would contain an implicit logical link between A and C, but unless a researcher from one field stumbled upon the other field's literature, that link would never become explicit.\n\n\n\nPROGRAM DEVELOPER: Don R. Swanson, professor emeritus of information science at the University of Chicago, has developed a computer program that will allow systematic searching for links in scientific literature.\n\nSwanson prefers to call his approach text-based informatics. Other enthusiasts, such as Michael D. Gordon, professor of computer and information systems at the University of Michigan Business School in Ann Arbor, refer to it as literature-based discovery. \"I think that [Swanson] has made concrete and operational this idea that there are discoveries that can be made within the public literature,\" notes Gordon. \"He has performed very, very well-conceived and well-executed experiments. . . . And there has been follow-on work in the medical community that has been based on his reporting these connections.\"\n\n\"He's opening up a new way of doing information science, a new avenue for approaching information,\" adds Henry Small, director of contract research at the Philadelphia-based Institute for Scientific Information Inc. \"Whether or not this pans out, I think people are thinking in a new way about information. They're thinking of knowledge discovery rather than just information retrieval.\"\n\nOne of Swanson's first successes with text-based informatics came in 1986: \"Raynaud's disease is a circulatory disorder for which neither the cure nor the cause is known,\" he explains. \"I found literature that indicated that at least a subgroup of Raynaud's patients have certain abnormalities in their blood. Separately [I learned that] dietary fish oil tended to correct those abnormalities, such as high viscosity. And so putting those together suggested that dietary fish oil should be of benefit to Raynaud's patients. About two years later somebody did a clinical trial that did show a beneficial effect.\" (Swanson's original paper is: D.R. Swanson, Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, 30[1]:7-18, 1986; and the papers reporting the clinical trial that validated his suggestion are: B.B. Chang et al., Surgical Forum, 39:324-326, 1988; and R.A. DiGiacomo et al., American Journal of Medicine, 86[2]:158-164, 1989.)\n\nThen in 1988 Swanson used his method to establish a relationship between migraine headaches and magnesium deficiency (D. R. Swanson, Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, 31:526-557, 1988). Despite the fact that at the time there were virtually no records in the MEDLINE database mentioning both migraine and magnesium, Swanson found that there were 11 intermediate effects linking the neurological disorder with the dietary deficiency. To give just two examples, writes Swanson, \"magnesium can inhibit spreading depression in the cortex, and spreading depression may be implicated in migraine attacks; magnesium-deficient rats have been used as a model of epilepsy, and epilepsy has been associated with migraine.\" The relationship Swanson found between migraine and magnesium has been validated repeatedly in the clinic.\n\nMore recently Swanson has collaborated with Neil R. Smalheiser, now an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who says that he has encouraged Swanson to take a slightly different approach to text-based informatics. Previously Swanson had focused on cases in which no link between a particular A and a particular C had been suspected. Now the collaborators are focusing on cases in which researchers have already established at least a tenuous connection between A and C. \"They either know that A and C are linked experimentally, but may not know how they're linked,\" explains Smalheiser, \"or they want to see what is already known about possible relationships between A and C.\"\n\n\n\nCOLLABORATOR: Neil R. Smalheiser, assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago, has worked with Swanson in developing ARROWSMITH.\n\nOn the one hand ARROWSMITH uncovered, in Smalheiser's words, \"a whole cottage literature in schizophrenia arguing that patients shared markers of various kinds suggestive of chronic oxidative stress.\" On the other hand, the program turned up information about an animal model of chronic oxidative stress that's produced by depriving rats of Vitamin E and selenium for a period of six weeks. These rats show selective increases in calcium-independent phospholipase A2.\n\n\"We saw this A-to-B-to-C link and proposed not only that this could explain what they saw in people, but that this chronic oxidative stress model could be [useful] for studying this phenomenon,\" notes Smalheiser.\n\nSwanson describes ARROWSMITH (which is available for use at no cost at http://kiwi.uchicago.edu) as, \"interactive software that extends the capability of a MEDLINE search. It operates on the output of a conventional search in a way that lets the user see new relationships and form novel hypotheses. . . . The user puts in a broader field as a conjecture--'I'd like to look at all dietary substances and see any connections to migraine.' And that's organized into a ranked list on which magnesium appears at or near the top. Therefore the hypothesis is suggested to the user, rather than asking the user to come up with the hypothesis.\"\n\nDespite the promise of Swanson's approach, information scientists and researchers have detailed a number of shortcomings and criticisms both with the ARROWSMITH program and, more broadly, with literature-based discovery itself. ISI's Small, for example, expresses a general sense of doubtfulness: \"I have to say I'm skeptical, but it's not so farfetched that it's not worth some serious attention. I think everyone has some skepticism that you can find something new from what's already out there.\"\n\nOf Swanson, Small remarks, \"He's not doing anything in the laboratory. He's not collecting any new experimental results. And that seems to be the primary way discoveries occur, through the experimental method, testing hypotheses and so forth. So to think, say in the case of a disease, that the answer to a particular disease . . . is actually sitting out there somewhere hidden, is a little bit of a stretch. . . . What if the migraine headache was caused by something we haven't even looked at yet? In that case, no matter how hard the machine flails away at this, it's not going to find an answer.\"\n\nOn the other hand, allows Small, \"In the cases where the explanation and the problem are already out there and just have to be put together, his method is a very, very reasonable one to try.\"\n\nA more specific shortcoming of ARROWSMITH is that the current version of the software operates only on an article's title, not on the full text, the abstract, or even its medical subject headings (although Swanson has a version in development that does examine subject headings). Swanson defends this approach by noting that most titles in the biomedical literature are highly descriptive, and by pointing out that having the program examine additional fields would greatly increase processing time.\n\n\n\nNOT JUST SCIENCE: Kenneth A. Cory used a Swanson approach to find a link between the poetry of Robert Frost and ancient Greek philosopher Carneades.\n\nAnother problem with ARROWSMITH is that it requires a significant investment in time and effort from its users, who must first conduct two detailed MEDLINE searches and download the results in a specific text format. \"I think the most basic [limitation] is that this is really meant for the person who already knows how to do database searching,\" Swanson acknowledges. \"It doesn't replace conventional searching, and the more the user knows about database searching, the better the user can exploit ARROWSMITH.\"\n\nThen users must upload the results to the ARROWSMITH site for processing. \"When the Internet slows down, the responsiveness of the system slows down,\" notes Swanson.\n\nSmalheiser agrees that this can be a problem. \"The trouble with the web site is that when you're downloading very large files of the sort that a literature would consist of--schizophrenia has thousands and thousands of titles--it takes a long time to do that over the Internet.\" And then, once ARROWSMITH produces its output--a process that takes from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the size of the input files--a researcher who is highly knowledgeable in the subjects under investigation must take the time to interpret the results.\n\n\"Even though the computer is doing a lot, the user has to invest the time to study the output and use the output as a guide to the literature,\" Swanson notes. \"It's not a magical solution in which the computer comes up with new ideas and new hypotheses. The role of the computer is to display information that stimulates the user to see new connections. So it depends on the sophistication and the abilities of the user.\"\n\nDespite the technique's promise, literature-based discovery seems to have generated more interest within the information science community than among life scientists. Swanson points out that very few individuals have made use of ARROWSMITH despite its free availability to anyone in the world with an Internet connection. Smalheiser observes that the papers he's co-authored with Swanson reporting the associations they discovered--including associations between indomethacin and Alzheimer's disease and estrogen and Alzheimer's disease--have been cited only for the results they produced. The innovative method itself has apparently not caught many eyes.\n\n\"I find it almost unbelievable that this isn't something that has captured everyone's attention,\" complains Gordon, who co-authored a paper (M.D. Gordon, R.K. Lindsay, Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 47:116-128, 1996) replicating and extending Swanson's original results on migraine. \"It's both extremely exciting intellectually and extremely important in terms of the kind of results it potentially can produce. I don't understand why it hasn't been seized upon.\"\n\nSmalheiser suggests one reason: \"There is a certain amount of work that is involved, because when you're linking two literatures there's a significant number of terms--a B list--that you have to wade through. So you have to know what you're looking for and why to make sense of this, to quickly go through separating the wheat from the chaff.\"\n\nThis is much more difficult, he notes, than using one of the publicly available sequence databases to perform a simple DNA homology search. \"When you do a DNA homology search, they will give you a list of the 100 most homologous genes. . . . Whereas if we generate a B list, the raw B list might be 600 terms. And then we manually edit it down to 150 terms. Then we scan through the titles quickly, knowing what kind of things we're looking for, but it still could be a stack of 20 pages.\"\n\n\"It takes an expert to evaluate the different hypotheses,\" ISI's Small observes. \"And how many medical experts are going to have the patience to do this kind of thing? I think this might be the crux of the issue, because a clinical practitioner is not going to go to MEDLINE and try to churn away at something like this.\"\n\nAnd then there may be a psychological barrier preventing researchers from allowing a computer to generate hypotheses. But researchers need have no fear that they'll be supplanted by machines, says Gordon. After all, accountants weren't rendered obsolete by computerized spreadsheet programs.\n\nThe most detailed expression of Swanson's ideas on text-based informatics can be found in the paper: D.R. Swanson, N.R. Smalheiser. \"An interactive system for finding complementary literatures: a stimulus to scientific discovery.\" Artificial Intelligence , 91:183-203, 1997. The full text of this article, as well as the gateway to the ARROWSMITH program, are on Swanson's web site: http://kiwi.uchicago.edu/\n\nThe bottom line, concludes Gordon, is that Swanson's work has provided a valuable set of tools. \"Put them in the hands of someone who really understands medicine. They ought to be able to comb through a good body of literature in a much more systematic way than they could have otherwise. They can have brought to their attention concepts and articles that otherwise, because of their specialization, they very likely never would have considered. They could be much more efficient with this tool working for them, and ultimately they could probably be more effective, more creative.\"\n\nRobert Finn, a freelance science writer based in Long Beach, Calif., can be reached online at finn@nasw.org."}]}
