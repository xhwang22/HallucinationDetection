His coach was Alex Joyner, who he recalls as \u201cone of the finest men I ever knew.\u201d After high school he pitched in the fast Hudson Valley League where he attracted the attention of scout Fred Mathews of the Philadelphia Phillies of the National League who signed him to a contract in 1945. This began a professional baseball career that spanned twenty-two years, eleven in top minor league competition, and eleven in the major circuits. Thus, Steve Ridzik played longer in the major baseball leagues than any Yonkers athlete.\n\nOn reporting to Philadelphia he was farmed to the Wilmington Blue Rocks, who after a short trial period, transferred him up the baseball ladder to Greenboro in the Carolina State League. His minor league experiences encompassed such clubs and leagues as Schenectady in the Canadian American League; Toronto and Baltimore in the International League; Utica in the Eastern League; Wilmington in the inter-State league; Minnesota and Fort Worth in the American Association; and San Diego in the Pacific Coast League. During this time his tams won five league championships and Steve was named on five minor league all star teams.\n\nHis major league career covered five clubs-the Philadelphia Phillies, Cincinnati Reds, New York Giants, Cleveland Indians, and the Washington Senators, from which club he retired from baseball in 1966. His first year in the big leagues in 1950 was an auspicious one, as his club, the Philadelphia Phillies, won the National League crown. The Highlight of his career came in 1952 when he pitched a no hit-no run game against the Saint Louis Cardinals.\n\nSteve also played Winter League Baseball in Puerto Rico and in the Venezuelan and Dominican Republic Leagues.

What began strictly as an online bookseller slowly evolved into a purveyor of hundreds of different product lines. That helped Amazon (AMZN) to grow into a global e-commerce and cloud computing giant, with a $1.8 trillion market capitalization value as of July 22, 2021.\n\nBezos is widely lauded as a visionary in e-commerce. But he owes much of his success to the management team that helped develop Amazon\u2019s many silos and executed the company\u2019s rapid growth.\n\nBelow, we sketch out the profiles of Amazon\u2019s founder and six of the company\u2019s top executives. We highlight the various roles they have held at Amazon, their contributions to the company, previous roles at other companies, and their educational backgrounds.\n\nKey Takeaways Since launching Amazon in 1994, founder Jeff Bezos has grown the company into a giant global corporation with a market capitalization value of nearly $1.8 trillion.\n\nBezos owes much of his success to his management team.\n\nBezos is one of the world\u2019s richest people, with an estimated net worth of $206 billion as of July 22, 2021.\n\nJeffrey P.

From cloud computing to groceries to advertising to healthcare, Amazon has made itself felt in just about every major industry.\n\nUnder his leadership, Amazon in 2005 launched Amazon Prime, which offered two-day shipping on more than one million items when the standard in the retail industry was up to six days. Amazon Prime has since added access to video and music streaming and now boasts more than 150 million subscribers worldwide. In 2006, the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing platform was launched under Bezos\u2019 direction. He also helped Amazon build its own delivery and logistics business. By July 2020, Amazon was delivering nearly two-thirds of its own packages.\n\nBefore founding Amazon, Bezos worked for a telecommunications start-up named Fitel.

She first joined the company in February 2006, assuming the role of VP of Finance and Controller.\n\nA year later, she was promoted to VP, Worldwide Controller and principal accounting officer. Reynolds has been a key manager in helping Amazon to develop accounting systems capable of scaling in tandem with Amazon\u2019s incredible growth.

Prior to that, he was promoted to VP in April 2002 after joining Amazon in November 1999 as associate general counsel for Litigation and Regulatory matters.

Alex Wong | Getty Images\n\nDuring Amazon 's most recent all-hands staff meeting held in November, CEO Jeff Bezos explained why he's no longer taking live questions from employees at the event. Some questions had become too specific to small teams, he said, and the new format would allow employees from all over the world to more easily submit questions. The change, however, wasn't made to avoid tough questions, Bezos said \u2014 because in the worst case, he added with a laugh, he could just defer those to his executive team members. \"There's no question that could stymie me because I'm so comfortable saying 'I don't know,'\" Bezos said, according to a recording of the meeting heard by CNBC. \"If [the question] is super hard, I just delegate it.\" Bezos' comment about delegation was a joke, but it also reflects an important aspect of his leadership culture: the camaraderie he's built over the years with his most senior executives at Amazon.\n\nwatch now\n\nThat trust and comfort between Bezos and the rest of the leadership is important, since stability at the top is one of the key reasons for Amazon's success. Amazon is known for seeing very little turnover among its most important power players, with many of them having been at the company for years, if not decades \u2014 a point Bezos previously highlighted as one of the company's strengths. According to an internal organization chart seen by CNBC, Amazon's executives at the highest level are largely unchanged from the leadership chart CNBC put together in November 2017. Bezos, for example, lost only one of his direct reports, who was already on a two-year hiatus. There have been some notable changes among lower-level executives, however. Unusually, Amazon saw several departures among its VP-level executives last year, while Bezos lost two of his S-Team members, a tight-knit group of over a dozen senior executives famous for seeing very few departures historically. One thing has not changed: Almost all of the executives at the top of Amazon's consumer-facing businesses, like retail, cloud and hardware, are white men. Only four of the 48 executives in those roles are women. That number goes up slightly if you include PR and HR roles, but Beth Galetti, senior vice president of human resources, is still Bezos' only female direct report. There are still no African-Americans and only a handful of people of Asian descent in this group. However, many of the \"shadow\" advisor roles, a highly coveted temporary position that follows top executives to every meeting for training purposes, are women. Amazon's representative wasn't immediately available for comment. Here are the the six most important decision-makers at Amazon and their direct reports, excluding non-consumer-facing roles, like HR, finance and legal:\n\nJeff Bezos, Amazon CEO:\n\nBezos saw almost no change in his direct reports last year, except for one very notable loss. As CNBC reported in December, Diego Piacentini, a longtime Amazon executive and one of its largest shareholders, decided to leave the company following a two-year hiatus working with the Italian government. Piacentini's departure was particularly interesting because it was the second S-Team loss in 2018, after Sebastian Gunningham, SVP of marketplace, left in March. S-Team members don't necessarily report directly to Bezos as they move around the company leading different projects. Bezos also got a new shadow advisor in Wei Gao, the second woman ever to fill the role.

Mike Kane | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nJeff Wilke, worldwide consumer CEO:\n\nWilke's team saw some turnover last year, as at least five of his direct reports left or changed roles. Greg Greeley, VP of Prime, and Chee Chew, VP of consumer engagement, each left for Airbnb and Twilio, respectively. Gunningham went to WeWork. Peter Faricy, who took over most of Gunningham's responsibilities last year, also left the company after a reshuffling in the marketplace team. Neil Lindsay, VP of marketing, took over Greeley's former role, and now manages worldwide marketing and the Prime program. Sukumar Rathnam, VP of Selection and Catalog Systems, was briefly one of Wilke's direct reports last year, but is now reporting to someone else within Wilke's organization. Russ Grandinetti, who runs international business, has the largest number of direct reports under him, as Amazon is aggressively expanding its presence overseas. Sarah Jane Gunter, who was Wilke's shadow assistant, has been replaced by Yunyan Wang, a woman of Chinese descent.

Scott Wiltamuth, former VP of development & management tools, joined the machine learning services team. Brent Jaye, VP of AWS Support, still lists that title on his LinkedIn profile, but no longer reports to Jassy, according to the company's internal organization chart. Krystal Walsh-Allen, Jassy's shadow advisor, has been replaced by Doug Yeum, formerly head of Amazon Korea. Also, Adam Bosworth, who joined from Salesforce in 2017, is now in charge of AWS New Products, likely related to AWS Everyone, a secretive project for \"low code/no code\" software, as Geekwire previously reported. There is also a couple of leaders who aren't part of AWS but nonetheless report to Jassy. Babak Parviz, who runs the secretive Grand Challenge team, is organizationally under AWS' CEO, as is Twitch founder Emmett Shear. But it's unclear how involved Jassy is in the day to day operations of those units.

Albert Cheng, who temporarily took over Roy Price's job as head of Amazon Studios in 2017, has been replaced by Jennifer Salke. Jason Ropell, who worked closely with Price, has also left. Amazon's advertising boss Paul Kotas, IMDB's Col Needham, and Amazon Music's Steve Boom all report up to Blackburn as well.

Stephen Brashear | Getty Images\n\nDave Limp, SVP of Amazon Devices, Digital Management\n\nLimp, in charge of all hardware and Alexa voice assistant teams, didn't see much change either. Only Douglas Booms is no longer reporting to Limp, but he still remains within his organization.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) has become one of the most successful tech companies in the world. As its market cap has risen to over $1 trillion, its chief executive officer and founder, Jeff Bezos, has become the world\u2019s richest man. The board that oversees Amazon is small for a huge corporation. However, each member apparently has been chosen for a specific background in governance and business development.\n\nBezos is chair of the board of the company he founded in 1994. Although his 15.1% ownership does not give him sole, outright control of Amazon, it does help put him in a place from which he has effective control.\n\nRosalind G. Brewer (the retailer) joined the board in early 2019. As the Group President, Americas, and chief operating officer of Starbucks, she is in a unique position to help Amazon with its brick-and-mortar business; in particular, Whole Foods.\n\nJamie S. Gorelick (the lawyer) has been on the Amazon board since 2012. She is a partner at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr. She also has been a Deputy Attorney General of the United States and general counsel of the U.S. Department of Defense. Amazon has run into increasing pressure from the government because of what has been described as a monopoly position. There is a chance its presence in e-commerce faces stiff regulation. Also, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company\u2019s cloud business, does a great deal of business with the government.\n\n\n\nDaniel P. Huttenlocher (the scientist) has been on the board since September 2016. He is currently dean of MIT Schwarzman College of Computing. Amazon has one of the most technically complicated retail infrastructures in the world. Some of its logistics are run by advanced automation. Its Alexa-powered household aids are essentially run by modest artificial intelligence software. AWS is among the larger tech providers to tens of thousands of companies.\n\nJudith A. McGrath (the media expert) was the board chair and CEO of MTV Networks Entertainment Group, which was once among the largest cable channels in America. She oversaw original programming the channel used to draw viewers. Amazon Prime\u2019s streaming video service is among the largest in the world, with over 100 million subscribers. Part of its edge is the creation of original programming, on which it spends hundreds of millions of dollars per year. She has been on the board since July 2014.\n\nIndra K. Nooyi (the consumer products expert) was the CEO of PepsiCo until her retirement in 2019. She has been on the Amazon board since February 2019. Amazon\u2019s food and consumer products foodprint has grown rapidly, through both its Whole Foods operations and the large selection of food products it sells through Amazon.com.\n\nJonathan J. Rubinstein (the Wall St. connection), was co-CEO of Bridgewater Associates from May 2016 to April 2017. He joined the board in December 2010. Bridgewater is the largest hedge fund in America and has about $140 billion in assets. Its founder, Ray Dalio, is among the most influential financiers in the world.\n\nThomas O. Ryder (the transaction expert) was the president of American Express Travel Related Services International. He joined the Amazon board in November 2002 and is one of the board\u2019s senior members. He was also head of the Reader\u2019s Digest Association, which at the time was one of the world\u2019s largest magazine publishers. He has expertise in subscription businesses like Amazon Prime, which is an important aspect of Amazon\u2019s business. Amazon\u2019s credit card transactions are a key engine of its e-commerce operations. Amazon also issues its own credit cards.\n\nPatricia Q. Stonesifer (the philanthropist) was CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the largest private foundations in the world. Amazon promotes its efforts to provide help to \u201cunderprivileged communities\u201d where it has a \u201cphysical presence.\u201d Most recently, it has publicized its help to its employees and customers during the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic. She joined the board in February 1997 and is the longest-serving member, other than Bezos.\n\nWendell P. Weeks (the multinational CEO) is head of Corning and is the only active CEO of a worldwide public company on the Amazon board. He joined in February 2016. He has experience selling products in all the world\u2019s largest companies. He also oversees Corning\u2019s operating and staff functions, oversight roles Bezos has at Amazon.\n\nThe board members are well paid.

His coach was Alex Joyner, who he recalls as \u201cone of the finest men I ever knew.\u201d After high school he pitched in the fast Hudson Valley League where he attracted the attention of scout Fred Mathews of the Philadelphia Phillies of the National League who signed him to a contract in 1945.
