He was in Massachusetts, the only state that requires health coverage, and participating in a forum sponsored by PBS. He faced JudyAnn Bigby, an advocate of the state\u2019s near universal coverage plan and the secretary of health. \u201cIt was the worst possible setting for him,\u201d says one of his opponents, Regina Herzlinger of Harvard Business School.\n\nRarely coy, Epstein began by declaring that Wal-Mart could provide health coverage better than Massachusetts could. Then in a move Herzlinger called \u201cKissingeresque,\u201d Epstein distanced himself from his teammate, who was presenting a distasteful argument, and reached across the aisle to her. \u201cIt took him about five minutes to realign three of the four debaters,\u201d she says. Afterward, Epstein was \u201csurrounded by people who may not have liked what he had to say but were dazzled by his brilliance.\u201d\n\nEpstein\u2019s debating skills are legendary, as is almost everything about the man. It\u2019s been said that taking notes in his class is like trying to fill a Dixie cup with water from Niagara Falls. \u201cRichard speaks without breathing, and in perfect paragraphs,\u201d says Samuel Issacharoff, Bonnie and Richard Reiss Professor of Constitutional Law. During the timed closing remarks in Boston, Epstein got in 35 percent more words than did his opponent (218 words per minute versus 161).\n\nIt seems he knows something about everything, and his reach extends beyond the academy to newspaper op-eds, podcasts, and even YouTube videos. He\u2019s written and edited 22 books on diverse subjects. At the University of Chicago, he has taught 27 different courses\u2014including Roman law\u2014since 1972. Epstein, who has been an annual visiting professor at the NYU School of Law since 2005, plans to follow suit when he permanently joins the faculty in 2010. \u201cWhatever they ask is what I teach,\u201d Epstein says. \u201cThat\u2019s always been my rule.\u201d\n\nHe trains students to speak off-the-cuff\u2014a practice that can fell even the ablest. He calls on a student closest to the aisle, then moves rapidly down the row, getting through half the class in an hour. \u201cHe\u2019s intimidating at first, but he\u2019s not trying to embarrass you,\u201d says Michael Schachter \u201910, who nearly blacked out once when Epstein worked his way toward him in Contracts.\n\nEpstein can debate any topic with ease because his arguments have a common denominator: classical liberalism. \u201cI\u2019m working off a strong, central theorem,\u201d he says. In a nutshell: He believes in individual freedom, but not unconstrained by the rights of others, and in limited government with an eye toward the common good.\n\nIn his best-known work, Takings: Private Property and the Power of Eminent Domain (1985), which has been cited in four U.S. Supreme Court cases, he doesn\u2019t come down against eminent domain per se, but argues that the government should be required to provide the same protections as any private entity in a property dispute. \u201cHe, more than any other scholar, has had an impact on reopening issues about property rights that have been neglected for decades in the constitutional literature,\u201d says Vanderbilt law professor James Ely. Epstein is currently working on a book that analyzes the Constitution through libertarian eyes. The Tulsa Law Review, which traditionally honors constitutional scholars, dedicated its 2008 symposium to Epstein\u2019s complete works.\n\nPredictably, Epstein opposes most of the positions of his one-time colleague President Barack Obama. He does support the president\u2019s call to safeguard habeas corpus rights and close Guant\u00e1namo Bay, while reserving his highest compliment for Obama\u2019s skill in another arena altogether: the basketball court. \u201cHe\u2019s a great player, but not the equal of Arne Duncan, his education secretary,\u201d says Epstein, who played with those two plus First Brother-in-Law Craig Robinson at a party for Marty Nesbitt, Obama\u2019s campaign treasurer.\n\nEpstein was raised with his two sisters in what he calls \u201ca perfectly conventional Brooklyn home.\u201d His father, Bernard, was a radiologist, and his mother, Catherine, \u201ca basic New Deal liberal,\u201d ran Bernard\u2019s office. Epstein did well in school, but was not a model student. He bounced out of his seat to blurt out answers, often lost his homework, and wasn\u2019t a particularly good test-taker. \u201cI had a bunch of teachers who prophesied an ugly end to my academic career,\u201d he recalls. That didn\u2019t stop him from getting into Columbia College. As a student during the height of the turbulent 1960s, Epstein stood apart from the protests. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a contrarian intellectual, and when I see lots of people out there chanting and screaming, my first reaction is that they\u2019ve got to be wrong,\u201d he says.\n\nHe graduated in 1964, earning a Kellett Fellowship to study at Oxford. The English curriculum was oriented toward private law, so he found himself immersed in work by judges with classical libertarian leanings. He received his B.A. in jurisprudence in 1966, then entered Yale Law School, earning his LL.B. in 1968.\n\nDuring the next four years he taught law at the University of Southern California and met his wife, Eileen, a professional fundraiser. They have three children. At the University of Chicago, Epstein headed the John M. Olin Program in Law and Economics, and in 2001 served as interim dean when his predecessor left unexpectedly. \u201cHe filled the gap selflessly. People thought of him as a steady rock,\u201d says Chicago colleague Douglas Baird.\n\nIn 2005, Epstein began splitting his year between Chicago and New York. \u201cThis is a faculty that is convivial and highly professional,\u201d he says. \u201cI like the culture.\u201d His appointment allows him to keep his connection with the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, where he has been a fellow since 2000, and spoil his granddaughter, Bella. In his leisure time he plays basketball and does crossword puzzles. With typical humility, he notes, \u201cI have progressed from rank amateur to respectable mediocrity, and sometimes surprise myself by finishing a Saturday New York Times puzzle.\u201d\n\n\u2013\n\nAll of 2009 Faculty Focus\n\n2009 Home"}, {"url": "https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2008/november/richard_epstein_one_of_the.html", "page_content": "Professor Richard Epstein, the James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor of Law at the University of Chicago, will join NYU School of Law as a permanent member of the faculty in the fall of 2010.\n\nEpstein, who is currently visiting the Law School for the fourth time, is considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in legal academia.

Epstein at least two years to get anything published because \"it's tricky,\" he said. Not to mention the distractions.\n\n\"There was a lot of instability\" at the University of Southern California where he first taught, Epstein said. The dean shut down the university for a while due to continual student protests.\n\nBy Epstein's third year of teaching, he started to get the hang of writing.\n\nSince then, Epstein has published 19 books, nearly 270 law review articles, 84 magazine and newspaper pieces and a several dozen other works.\n\nOf all these, one work stands out: \"Takings: Private Property and the Power of Eminent Domain.\"\n\nPublished by Harvard University Press in 1985, the book was \"almost universally\" condemned by law professors, said Eric A. Kades, a professor at William & Mary School of Law.\n\nEpstein, now at the University of Chicago Law School, echoed that view: the book was \"widely reviled when it came out.\"\n\nNevertheless, \"Takings\" has since been cited by the U.S. Supreme Court in four property rights cases, Kades noted.\n\n\"Not only does the Supreme Court cite him,\" Kades said, \"but his work has clearly influenced the court, perhaps most clearly in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council,\" 505 U.S. 1003 (1992).\n\nTwenty years later, Epstein's 1985 book and his body of work on property rights led the William & Mary School of Law to give Epstein the school's 2005 Brigham-Kanner Prize this fall.\n\nThe prize is given to recognize the recipient's lifetime of contributions to protecting property rights and advancing those constitutional rights.\n\nDespite the initial condemnation of Epstein's book by the legal academy, \"Takings\" was an \"instant classic ... a must-read ... cited on both sides of the aisle,\" Kades related.\n\n\"The academy is very liberal. He's very conservative,\" Kades continued, explaining why law professors' original reviews were \"almost universally condemnatory.\"\n\n\"Liberals generally believe the state has wide powers to regulate private property,\" according to Kades. \"Conservatives generally believe property owners have wide rights to be free of government regulations of their land use.\"\n\nEpstein fondly remembered the 1991 U.S. Senate hearings to confirm Clarence Thomas to sit on the Supreme Court -- and the cameo appearance by \"Takings.\"\n\n\"It did not start as a debate over Anita Hill,\" Epstein said. \"It started with a debate over natural law and property rights.\"\n\nEpstein recalled that Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., showed Epstein's book to Thomas \"and wanted him to confirm or disavow this book.\"\n\nIf Thomas had approved of the book, it would have given his opponents reason to reject him, Epstein related, but \"Thomas did the right thing and avoided the question.\"\n\n\"When I wrote the book, I had never taught constitutional law,\" Epstein stated. He said he had done a lot of work with property law and nuisances.\n\nHe said he wanted to learn whether the Constitution laid down a difference between property disputes involving individuals and property disputes between the government and a citizen.\n\n\"Eventually, I concluded it did not,\" Epstein said.\n\nIn Kades' summation, Epstein's \"fundamental axiom ... is that the government's power to regulate is no greater than private citizens' power to assert common-law remedies against each other.\"\n\nThe book, Epstein said, also questioned the legality of New Deal legislation.\n\n\"It was a thorough, unrelenting, all-guns-blazing attack on the received wisdom,\" Epstein said.\n\nBut his defense of property rights, he said, was \"not meant to be a defense of privilege but a defense of a series of social institutions.\"\n\n\"Where we find eminent domain abuse in most cases is powerful people going to government to condemn land owned by their neighbors to build parking lots\" and other commercial uses, Epstein asserted.\n\nEpstein says, as expected, that the Supreme Court recent decision in Kelo v. City of New London, No. 04-108 (June 23, 2005), in holding that New London, Conn., could take citizens' homes in the name of urban planning was \"dreadful.\"\n\nKades estimated that Epstein's many writings have been cited by other authors about 6,500 times.\n\n\"He's one of the giants of the field, one of the very top property scholars of the last 50 years,\" Kades said.\n\nYet when Epstein was asked what his focus is, he said, \"I don't specialize in anything.\"\n\nHe has taught courses in civil procedure, communications, constitutional law, contracts, corporations, criminal law, health law and policy, legal history, labor law, land use planning, patents, taxes, Roman law, torts, and workers' compensation.\n\nHe has written about most of those things, too.\n\n\"People ask me, How do you know what you want to write? I haven't the slightest idea,\" Epstein said. \"Somebody suggests a topic. You read, you talk, you listen ... until it all comes pouring out of your head in a relatively organized fashion.\"\n\n\n\nCopyright 2005 Law Bulletin Publishing Company"}, {"url": "https://www.law.nyu.edu/news/ideas/Richard-Epstein-prolific", "page_content": "Richard Epstein\n\nGoogle \u201cRichard A. Epstein\u201d and \u201cprolific\u201d and you\u2019ll get plenty of hits. Other searches will produce multiple items documenting that Epstein, who is the Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law, has long been one of the country\u2019s most productive and influential legal scholars. On April 20, NYU Law and the University of Chicago Law School (Epstein\u2019s former academic home, where he is now a senior lecturer) will jointly sponsor an event in Chicago to honor Epstein\u2019s 50-year career. Even focusing just on the most recent quintile of his career\u2014since the fall of 2007, when he began teaching regularly at NYU\u2014there is plenty to celebrate, as his output and activity have continued at a brisk pace.\n\nScholarly productivity has long been assessed by quantifying traditional publications, and Epstein has no shortage of those. Between September 1, 2007, and March 1, 2018, he authored 123 academic journal articles and 30 book chapters; he also wrote or edited 10 books.\n\nTo focus only on Epstein\u2019s academic writing, though, is to miss a substantial portion of his oeuvre. A leading exponent of libertarian (or, in his preferred formulation, \u201cclassical liberal\u201d) thought, Epstein is a multiplatform threat, disseminating his ideas on myriad topics through online columns, podcasts, radio broadcasts, Twitter, and other outlets.\n\nThe conservative website Ricochet, which features Epstein on podcasts, referred to him in a tweet as \u201cThe Human Paragraph.\u201d Words, Epstein acknowledges, flow easily for him. \u201cIf you can get yourself to a topic sentence,\u201d he says, \u201cyou can usually see a problem through to the end.\u201d Credit Epstein with more than 450 topic sentences for the opinion pieces he has written since August 2008, primarily for Defining Ideas, an online journal of Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution, where Epstein is a senior fellow. Based on their average length, these pieces total about 750,000 words. Under \"The Libertarian\" moniker, he's done hundreds of podcasts for Hoover, as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy his own estimate, Epstein delivers between 75 and 100 lectures and talks a year. During a two-day visit to Philadelphia this February, he delivered four, all without notes, as is typical for his appearances. \u201cIf you like to talk, it\u2019s not a great burden,\u201d he explains. With material from a single five-hour recording session, the Federalist Society has produced a YouTube playlist featuring 14 brief videos of Epstein explaining the common law and plans to post nine more this summer on contracts as well as additional segments next year on torts.\n\n\u201cThey put me on a stool and said, \u2018Start talking,\u2019\u201d Epstein recalls. \u201cPretty soon it was like a rock rolling downhill.\u201d\n\nEmploying yet another medium, Epstein has done two \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d interviews on Reddit, the social news and media site.\n\nBeyond how much he produces, Epstein scores high on another metric for law professors: influence. The yardstick for this is law journal citations, and Epstein ranks in the upper echelons in a tally published in 2014 as well as in a current count in the HeinOnline database that includes citations over the past decade. Courts also cite his scholarship frequently.\n\nLess amenable to measurement, but still emblematic of Epstein\u2019s influence is the Classical Liberal Institute (CLI), which he co-founded at NYU Law in 2013 with Mario Rizzo, an economics professor at NYU. CLI shapes law, policy, and scholarship through its conferences, publications, and fellows program and works closely with its affiliate scholars even after they leave NYU.\n\nOf final note is the breadth of Epstein\u2019s scholarship and teaching. Among the topics he wrote about just in 2017, for example, are patents, right-to-work laws, takings law, Brexit, and Kantian moral theory. Over the course of his career, he has taught courses on 30 different subjects (16 since arriving at NYU Law), including Roman law, military law, and water law. \u201cI will write or teach about anything, and happily learn as I teach,\u201d he says.\n\nPosted April 17, 2018\n\nIllustration: Robert Neubecker"}, {"url": "https://www.law.uchicago.edu/events/faculty-lecture-richard-epstein-us-constitution-new-york", "page_content": "Faculty Lecture with Richard A.
