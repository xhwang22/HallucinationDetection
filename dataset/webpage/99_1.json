Thondup was originally slated to be ordained as a Buddhist monk, and was trained as such till he was eleven, having been recognized as a reincarnated Rinpoche. In 1941, he was enthroned as the Maharaja Kumar, replacing his elder brother, Paljor, who died in a plane crash while serving as an officer in the Royal Indian Air Force.\n\nPalden Thondup married twice. His first wife, Samyo Kushoe Sandeki, was from the Tibetan aristocracy and died in 1957. Sandeki was a popular figure in Sikkim and was widely respected by the people. Palden met a young American socialite, Hope Cooke, in Darjeeling and married her in 1963. His coronation as the Maharaja took place on an astrologically determined auspicious date, 4 April 1965, although he had taken over as ruler on 2 December 1963 after his father\u2019s death. The coronation was a grand ceremony, covered by American and European media that were attracted by another American marrying royalty, following the wedding of Hollywood actress, Grace Kelly, with the ruling Prince of Monaco.\n\nAlso read: For over 10 years, this Sikkim man has kept a lake litter-free at 12,406 ft\n\nPalace intrigue\n\nHope Cooke was ambitious and allowed her naivet\u00e9 to overcome the reality of her position as an \u2018outsider\u2019. She was caught early in the web of palace intrigues and shallow politicking. When my wife and I made our first call on the Chogyal and Gyalmo (queen consort), our initial impression of Hope Cooke was of a young person who had adopted the outward poise of Tibetan aristocracy, reducing the soft tones in which Tibetan ladies expressed themselves to a mostly incomprehensible whisper. She obviously did not realize that she was not taken as seriously as she thought she was by senior courtiers. What is more, she was at the receiving end of Palden Thondup\u2019s favourite sister, Princess Pema Tsedeun, also known as Kukula. Kukula was urbane and politically savvier than her brother. There was an immediate clash of personalities between her and Hope Cooke, with each in her own way trying to exert her influence on the ruler.\n\nOur first meeting with the Chogyal\u2014whose request to be addressed as such and not Maharaja had been acceded to by the Indian government\u2014and the Gyalmo took place in an intimate private sitting room at the palace. It was just the four of us around cups of tea and cakes from Calcutta\u2019s Swiss bakery and cafe, Flurys, along with an array of Sikkimese snacks. The Chogyal was his charming self, ready to discuss everything including politics. It was clear to me that he was trying to gauge whether I would be useful to him in the games he indulged in, of sharpening differences between officials of the political office and the political officer.\n\nThe same attempt was also in play where the relations between the political officer and the divisional commander of the 17th Mountain Division, were concerned. Prior to the visit, I had discussed the call with my boss, N.B. Menon, who let me have his insight into the mind of the Chogyal and his ways. I had little difficulty in reading his motives and the ideas that lay behind them. He was intent on creating confusion that he could take advantage of, in order to achieve his political ambition.\n\nAlso read: The sordid underbelly of \u2018golden state\u2019 Sikkim \u2014 it\u2019s India\u2019s suicide capital\n\nI managed to convey, indirectly, that I would not be part of any political game-playing, suggesting that given the norms of protocolary behaviour as first secretary (I was yet to be promoted to that status), I would of course be in touch with his principal secretary, Jigdal Densappa, and the concerned officials at the Sikkim secretariat. Palden Thondup took the hint and soon thereafter arranged for Karma Topden, the son of his political confidante, Martem Topden, a senior politician and legislator from the Sikkim National Party, to be the one to interact with me on political issues. This was, of course, along with Jigdal Densappa, who was Karma\u2019s mentor.\n\nKarma Topden had been trained in intelligence and was part of the so-called Study Group that was the backup in both political and socio-economic spheres to serve the ruler\u2019s ambitions and interests. It was also the think-tank that advised the Chogyal on all matters related to India. Hope Cooke was involved in broader policy formulations that emerged out of the deliberations of the Study Group that had Jigdal as its administrative head. It was this group, along with a set of legal advisors, that fed the Chogyal\u2019s ambitions to the point where he tended to fail to realistically evaluate the possible.\n\nOne of the outcomes of the deliberations of this group, where Hope Cooke had taken the lead, was to resurrect the controversy surrounding the grant of Darjeeling to the East India Company, adding the twist of asking for its return from India. What lay behind this attempt was the supposition that by placing the Indian government under this kind of pressure, it could force Delhi to negotiate a fresh treaty with Sikkim where in return for a settlement on Darjeeling, Sikkim would ask to be treated as an independent state in a special relationship with India.\n\nAlso read: Coercion, not accommodation \u2014 India and China need a new compact for 3,488-km border\n\nExpanding ambition\n\nTo grant credence to this ambition, Hope Cooke published an article in 1967, putting forward the claim that all land within the territory of Sikkim belonged to the ruler in eternity and as such could only be held in trust till he sought its return. She demanded the return of Darjeeling and its surrounds to the kingdom of Sikkim,1 suggesting that this was what her husband was seeking by revoking the trust deed that had granted Darjeeling to the East India Company. This article contributed to the atmosphere of distrust between the Chogyal and the Indian government, and it was felt that Hope Cooke was a \u2018trojan horse\u2019 planted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Sikkim. It was also a wake-up call to the mandarins in South Block, both at the prime minister\u2019s office and the ministry of external affairs.\n\nThe Chogyal was informed in no uncertain terms that this attempt at muddying issues was unacceptable and that his wife was stepping into dangerous waters. Hope Cooke, of course, was also playing to the gallery. By bringing Darjeeling into the Sikkim\u2013India equation, she felt that both the Bhutia and the Gurkha elements of the Nepali population would ensure that they endorsed her husband and his will to get a revision of the Treaty of 1950. In this endeavour she was unsuccessful, as the bulk of the Nepali and many among the Bhutia hierarchy were suspicious of her. This was also part of the palace politics and intrigues let loose by Kukula against her sister-in-law, the Gyalmo.\n\nEven among the top Sikkimese bureaucracy, there were quite a few who resented Hope Cooke\u2019s attempts to interfere and put barriers in the way of their dealings with the palace on matters of administration and policy. This resentment was to reach a climax when a pliant Indian Civil Service officer, I.S. Chopra, was selected by Foreign Secretary T.N. Kaul to take over the post of the principal administrative officer in Gangtok. Chopra, falling under the blandishments of Palden Thondup, accepted the title of \u2018Sidelong\u2019, a Tibetan title equivalent to the designation of \u2018prime minister\u2019. He in turn bent before the Chogyal and Hope Cooke\u2019s wishes to the point where he pressurized the chief secretary to divert plan funds provided by India in favour of projects that benefitted the Bhutia interests adding to the feelings of alienation of the Nepali majority.\n\nI.S. Chopra was unfit for the job entrusted to him. He was protocol-conscious and attempted to undercut N.B. Menon, who may have been junior to him in the foreign service but was the senior interlocutor between Delhi and the Chogyal. P.N. Haksar as the principal secretary to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had no confidence in Chopra, describing him as someone who had \u2018no loyalties to anything and least of all to his own country. But he was a friend of the Foreign Secretary (T.N.Kaul) and has always been a smooth operator. Having become the Dewan of Sikkim, he could not care less what happened to Indo-Sikkimese relations.\u2019"}, {"url": "https://www.royalsikkim.com/Archives%20and%20History/Royal%20History.aspx", "page_content": "Brief History on Sikkim\n\nNot much is known about Sikkim's ancient history, except for the fact that the first inhabitants were the Lepchas or Rong (ravine folk). Lepchas are said to have come from to the region from the Assam and Myanmar side. During 1200 AD Sikkim was absorbed by other clans from Tibet which included the Namgyal clan, who arrived in the 1400's and steadily won political control over Sikkim. In 1642, Phuntsog Namgyal (1604-1670) became the Chogyal (king). He presided over a social system based on Tibetan Lamaistic Buddhism. His descendants of Phuntsog Namgyal ruled Sikkim for more than 330 years.\n\n\n\nDuring the 1700's, Sikkim suffered continuous attacks from Nepal and Bhutan, after which it lost much of its territory. Nepalese also came to Sikkim and settled there as farmers. By the 1800's, Sikkim's population was culturally very complicated, and internal conflict resulted. In 1814-1815, Sikkim backed the British in a successful war against Nepal, and won back some of its territory, once lost.\n\n\n\nIn 1835, the British East India Company acquired the health resort of Darjeeling from Sikkim. During the mid-1800's, Sikkim violently withstand attempts to bring it under British rule, but in 1861 it finally became a British colony. The British had access through Sikkim to Tibet, and Sikkim's independent status was recognized.\n\n\n\nIn 1890, Britain and China signed a convention recognising the border between Sikkim and Tibet. Later, the British installed a political office to help the Chogyal of Sikkim run the internal and external functions of the kingdom. Sikkim had retained guarantees of independence from Britain when she became independent, and such guarantees were transferred to the Indian government when it gained independence in 1947. A popular vote for Sikkim to join the Indian Union failed and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to a special protectorate status for Sikkim. Sikkim was to be a tributary of India, in which India controlled its external defence, diplomacy and communication. A state council was established in 1955 to allow for constitutional government for the Chogyal, which was sustained until 1973.\n\nIn 1962, India and the People's Republic of China went to war. Although Sikkim was an independent country, skirmishes occurred at the Nathula Pass between Indian border guards and the Chinese soldiers. After the war, the ancient pass was shut down (it reopened July 6, 2006). Chogyal Tashi Namgyal succumbed to cancer in 1963 . Chogyal Palden Thondup Namgyal, ascended the throne in 1965. Trouble began to brew for the crown even before the Chogyal assumed the throne, as Indian Prime Minister Nehru, who had carefully preserved Sikkim's status as an independent protectorate, died in 1964. The chogyal, who responded to the increased pressure by drinking, was viewed by India as politically dangerous, especially after his wife, an American socialite Hope Cooke, published a journal article advocating a return of certain former Sikkimese properties.\n\nIn early 1970 the anti-monarchy Sikkim National Congress Party demanded fresh elections backed by greater representation of the Nepalese settlers. In 1973, anti-royalty riots in front of the palace led to a formal request for protection from India. India worried that an unstable Sikkim would invite Chinese to act on its claims that Sikkim was part of Tibet, and therefore part of China. The Indian government appointed a Chief administrator, Mr. B. S. Das, who effectively wrested the control of the country away from the Chogyal. Frosty relations between the Chogyal and the elected Kazi (Prime Minister) Lhendup Dorji resulted in an attempt to block the meeting of the legislature. The Kazi was elected by the Council of Ministers which was unanimous in its opposition to the retention of the Monarchy. Matters came to a head in 1975 when the Kazi appealed to the Indian Parliament for representation and change of status to statehood. On April 14, 1975, a referendum was held, in which Sikkim voted to merge with the union of India. Sikkim became the 22nd Indian State on April 26, 1975. On May 16, 1975, Sikkim officially became a state of the Indian Union and Lhendup Dorji became head of State (chief minister).\n\n\n\nChogyal of Sikkim SI no.

He was consecrated in 1642 at the age of 38. Phuntsog was a fifth generation descendant of Guru Tashi, a 13th century prince from the Mi-nyak House in Kham in Eastern Tibet. According to legend, Guru Rinpoche, a 9th century Buddhist saint had foretold the event that a Phuntsog from the east would be the next chogyal of Sikkim. In 1642, three lamas, from the north, west, and south went in search for the chosen person. Near present day Gangtok, they found a man churning milk. He offered them some refreshments and gave them shelter. So impressed were they by his deeds that they realised that he was a chosen one and immediately crowned him king. The crowning took place Norbughang near Yuksom on a stone slab in a pine covered hill, and he was anointed by sprinkling water from a sacred urn.\n\nPhuntsog, along with the lamas, then converted the local Lepcha tribes to Buddhism and set about expanding his kingdom up to the Chumbi Valley in Tibet, parts of modern day Darjeeling in the south, and parts of eastern Nepal.\n\nPhuntsog moved his capital to Yuksam and instituted the first centralised administration. The kingdom was divided into twelve Dzongs, or districts under a Lepcha Dzongpon (governor) who headed a council of twelve ministers. During his reign Buddhism was consolidated as the established religion in Sikkim. He was succeeded by his son, Tensun Namgyal in 1670.\n\nTensung Namgyal (1644\u20131700) was the second chogyal (monarch) of Sikkim. He succeeded his father Phuntsog Namgyal in 1670. He moved the capital from Yuksom to Rabdentse near Geyzing in 1670. He had three wives and was succeeded by his son Chakdor Namgyal, borne by his second wife in 1700.\n\nChakdor Namgyal was the third Chogyal (king) of Sikkim. He was succeeded Gyurmed Namgyal in 1717.\n\nGyurmed Namgyal was the fourth Chogyal (king) of Sikkim. He was succeeded by Phuntsog Namgyal II in 1733.\n\nPhuntsog Namgyal II was the fifth Chogyal (king) of Sikkim. He was succeeded by Tenzing Namgyal in 1780.\n\nDuring his reign the Nepalese raided Rabdentse, the then capital of Sikkim\n\nTenzing Namgyal was the sixth Chogyal (king) of Sikkim. He was succeeded by Tsugphud Namgyal in 1793. During his reign Chogyal fled to Tibet, and later died there in exile.\n\nTshudpud Namgyal (1785 - 1863) was king of Sikkim from 1793-1863. He gained independence from Nepal in 1815 and ruled under a British protectorate from 1861.\n\nUnder his father Tenzing Namgyal, most of Sikkim was appropriated by Nepal. Tshudpud Namgyal returned to Sikkim in 1793 to reclaim the throne. Because the capital of Rabdentse was too close to the Nepalese border, he shifted the capital to Tumlong.\n\nSikkim allied itself with the British in India, who also considered Nepal an enemy. Nepal overran most of the region, sparking the Gurkha War in 1814 with the British East India Company. The Sugauli Treaty and Treaty of Titalia returned the annexed territory to Sikkim in 1817.\n\nIn 1835, Tshudpud Namgyal ceded Darjeeling to the HEIC (Honourable East India Company) for an annual fee, but this relation was broken off sharply after he seized two British scientists in Sikkim, Joseph Dalton Hooker and Archibald Campbell. This led to two British military attacks in 1850 and 1861, resulting in the annexation of Sikkim by 1861. The same year, Tshudpud was granted the title of Maharaja of Sikkim by the British, and he abdicated the following year. At his death in 1863, aged 78, he had ruled Sikkim for 69 years, making him the longest-reigning Chogyal in history; as well, he was also the oldest ever Chogyal of Sikkim.\n\nSidkeong Namgyal (1819 - 1874) was king of Sikkim from 1863 to 1874. He was son of Tsugphud Namgyal and was succeeded by his half-brother Thutob Namgyal.\n\nThutob Namgyal (1860-11 February 1914) was the ruling Chogyal (monarch) of Sikkim between 1874 and 1914. Thutob ascended to the throne succeeding his half-brother Sidkeong Namgyal who died issueless. Differences between the Nepalese settlers and the indigenous population during his reign led to the direct intervention of the British, who were the de-facto rulers of the Himalayan nation. The British ruled in favour of the Nepalese much to the discontent of the chogyal, who then retreated to the Chumbi Valley and allied himself with the Tibetans.\n\nAfter a series of skirmishes between the Tibetans and the British near Jelepla, the Tibetans were pushed back and the Chogyal was put under the supervision of Claude White, the appointed political officer in 1889. In 1894, he shifted the capital from Tumlong to the present location, Gangtok. He was knighted in 1911.\n\nThutob died in 1914 and was succeeded by his son, Sidkeong Tulku Namgyal. The Sir Thutob Namgyal Memorial (STNM) Hospital in Gangtok was built in memory of him in 1917.\n\nSidkeong Tulku Namgyal (1879-5 December 1914) was the ruling Maharaja and Chogyal of Sikkim for a brief period in 1914, from 10 February to 5 December. He was the eldest son and heir of Maharaja Sri Panch Sir Thutob Namgyal, and was educated at St. Paul's School, Darjeeling and at Pembroke College, Oxford. A polyglot, he was learned in Chinese, English, Hindi, Lepcha, Nepali and Tibetan. Following an attack of jaundice, Sidkeong Tulku Namgyal died of heart failure on 5 December 1914, aged 35. He was succeeded by his younger brother, Tashi Namgyal.\n\nTashi Namgyal (October 26 1893 \u2013 December 2 1963) was the ruling Chogyal (King) of Sikkim from 1914 to 1963. He was the son of Thutob Namgyal.\n\nNamgyal was the 11th ruler of the Namgyal dynasty of Sikkim, succeeding his half brother Sidkeong Tulku Namgyal, who had ruled from February to December in 1914, till his death from heart failure. Born in Tibet and crowned by the 13th Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso, he was a strong advocate for closer links with India.\n\nHe was married in October 1918 to Kunzang Dechen, and they had 3 sons and 3 daughters. On his death he was succeeded as Chogyal by his son Palden Thondup Namgyal.\n\nDuring his life, he favoured closer links between Sikkim, India and Tibet. Although some conspiracy theorists attribute his death to Indian agents, such theories are widely discounted by most historians due to his excellent relations with India.\n\nAbout a decade after his death, his son Palden Thondup Namgyal, the incumbent hereditary Chogyal was formally deposed by the people of Sikkim who voted in a referendum (by a majority of 97%) to join the Indian Union. Palden Thondup Namgyal was widely unpopular among his people and the then democratically elected Prime Minister Lendup Dorji appealed to India to change the status of Sikkim from protectorate to statehood. On May 16, 1975, Sikkim was officially made the 22nd state of the Indian Union, thus ending the era of the Chogyal monarchy.\n\nPalden Thondup Namgyal (May 23, 1923 - January 29, 1982) was the 12th and last Chogyal (king) of Sikkim.\n\nAt six, Chogyal Namgyal became a student at St. Joseph's Convent in Kalimpong, but had to terminate his studies due to attacks of malaria. From eight to eleven he studied in order to ordain monkhood under his uncle, Rimpoche Lhatsun, and was subsequently recognized as the reincarnate leader of both Phodong and Rumtek monasteries. He later continued his studies at St. Joseph's College in Darjeeling and finally graduated from Bishop Cotton School in Simla, in 1941.\n\nChogyal P.T Namgyal served as adviser for internal affairs for his father, Sir Tashi Namgyal, the 11th Chogyal, and led the negotiating team which established Sikkim's relationship to India after independence in 1949. He married Sangey Deki in 1950, a daughter of an important Tibetan family, and together they had two sons and a daughter. Sangey died in 1957.\n\nChogyal P.T Namgyal married Hope Cooke in 1963, a twenty-two-year-old American socialite who was a graduate of Sarah Lawrence College. The marriage brought worldwide media attention to Sikkim. The couple, who had two children, Prince Palden and Princes Hope Leezum, divorced in 1980.\n\nShortly after their marriage, his father died and Namgyal was crowned the new Chogyal on an astrologically favorable date in 1965. In 1975 Sikkim merged with the union of India through a referendum receiving a 97%-majority election vote, thus ending his rule.\n\nP.T. Namgyal was an amateur radio operator, call sign AC3PT, and was a highly sought contact on the airwaves. The international call book listed his address as: P.T. Namgyal, The Palace, Gangtok, Sikkim.\n\nChogyal Palden died of cancer in New York City, in the United States on January 29, 1982.He was cremated at Yumasala the royal cremation place near Hanuman Tok, People from all over Sikkim paid their respect and mourned his death.\n\nHis son from his first marriage, Wangchuk Namgyal, was named the 13th Chogyal, but the position no longer confers any official authority.\n\nChogyal Wangchuk Tenzing Namgyal (b. April 1, 1953) is the second son of Palden Thondup Namgyal, the last sovereign king of Sikkim. He is also the present heir of the Namgyal dynasty and claimant to the Sikkim throne.\n\nHe was crowned as Sikkim's 13th king after his elder brother crown prince Tenzing Namgyal died in a tragic road accident. However, now this position does not confer any official authority and his responsibility includes only religious matters though he remains a chogyal in the hearts of Sikkimese people."}, {"url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/indiascope/story/19761115-sikkim-chogyals-waning-hope-819431-2015-04-11", "page_content": "Palden Thondup Namgyal who is lying in a coma after taking an overdose of barbiturates would not have become a public personality had not his elder brother died in an aircrash. Palden Thondup, just turned 53, ascended the gaddi in 1963 after the death of his father. The late Maharajah of Sikkim was a recluse who spent most of his time painting various views of the Kanchenjunga range which is visible from Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe state of Sikkim has a rough area of 3,200 square miles and a population of a little over two lakhs. The original people of Sikkim, the gentle Lepchas, were driven down the mountains by marauding Tibetans locally known as Bhutiyas. But for hard work in the fields a number of Nepalese were induced to come into the state and in course of time they formed the majority, as much as about 75 per cent, of the total population. Sikkim was a member of the Chamber of Princes and the British considered it another princely state along with the rest of six hundred-odd states.\n\nThe Sikkim National Congress, formed as a unit of the Indian National Congress, was a powerful organization at the time of Indian independence in 1947 under the leadership of Kazi Lhendup Dorji, the present Chief Minister of the state. There was a strong agitation at the time for merger with India. The blue and gold palace of the Maharajah was surrounded by demonstrators and the tension could only be resolved by the intervention of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru who successfully soothed ruffled feelings.\n\nIt was after the second marriage of Palden Thondup Namgyal to Hope Cooke, an American socialite, that attempts were made by him to secure a separate identity for himself and Sikkim. He rigged up a legislative council where, through an electoral gimmick, the Tibetans who were personally loyal to him, would always be in a majority. The vast numbers of Nepalese in the state were refused the right to vote, Later, Palden Thondup Namgyal took the title of Chogyal instead of the \"Maharajah\" which he had inherited from British times. Photographs of the Chogyal and his wife were compulsorily put up in public and private institutions. This gave room to considerable indignation among the public. The Chogyal tried to silence public criticism by force through his Tibetan Mafia. The wife of Kazi Lhendup Dorji, a Belgian, was exiled from Sikkim and was compelled to reside in Kalimpong in India.\n\nVague reports went around that the Chogyal was in touch with certain foreign agencies to promote the idea of a sovereign state of Sikkim. Hope Cooke's travels abroad and her pretensions to royalty gave ground for suspicion that some underhand moves were afoot in this sensitive state that borders the Tibetan region of China. Meanwhile, economic conditions in the state began to show steady decline. In the mountainous areas where people lived by rearing sheep, cattle and yaks, the population is very sparse and economic conditions are static. But in the dense plains, stark poverty was the fate of tens of thousands of Nepalese-descended Sikkimese without political rights.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Chogyal himself was the chief investor in the few industries set up in the state. He held stock in the local brewery. He owned the only habitable hotel in Gangtok and he also owned two cinema theatres in Gangtok.\n\nDiscontent that had been boiling inside the state for several years spilled over in 1973 when there were widespread disturbances in the state. In Gangtok at this time, the police had vanished and their place had been taken by volunteers of the United Front of the various political parties. In many places there had been clashes. The palace guards, not many in number, could not control the situation even though they had been equipped by modern arms like machine guns. Rampaging crowds met every evening at the Palden Stadium and demanded the resignation of the Chogyal and the inclusion of Sikkim as an integral part of the Indian Union. Some intemperate remarks by the sister of the Chogyal poured oil on the fire. Finally, the Indian army had to take over disturbed parts of Gangtok and other areas and bring a measure of peace and stability. Later, in a referendum held in the State, the people of Sikkim by an overwhelming majority decided to accede to India and parliament later ratified the decision.\n\nadvertisement\n\nTo these pressures on the Chogyal was added the emotional stress of his wife's sullen departure for the United States taking their two younger children along with her. Since then, the Chogyal has been under the necessity of coming to terms with reality. It is not known whether he is a habitual user of barbiturates or has been drugging himself only lately. Much of the predicament he finds himself in now must be traced to the unachievable ambitions of his American wife."}, {"url": "https://www.gofugyourself.com/royal-wedding-rewind-palden-thondup-namgyal-of-sikkim-marries-american-hope-cooke-09-2020", "page_content": "This is a royal wedding I was totally unfamiliar with, and I appreciate the person who suggested we rewind to this event, because it\u2019s very interesting and also educational.

It was ruled by Buddhist priest-kings known as the Chogyal. It became a princely state of British India in 1890. Following Indian independence, Sikkim continued its protectorate status with the Union of India after 1947, and the Republic of India after 1950. It enjoyed the highest literacy rate and per capita income among Himalayan states. In 1973, anti-royalist riots took place in front of the Chogyal\u2019s palace. In 1975, after the Indian Army took over the city of Gangtok, a referendum was held that led to the deposition of the monarchy and Sikkim joining India as its 22nd state.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like marrying a prince and then getting deposed \u2014 as the rulers at the time of the deposition of said monarchy were our bride and groom here, Palden Thondup Namgyal and Hope Cooke. She took the kids and went to New York five months into her husband\u2019s subsequent house arrest and basically never came back. They were having issues anyway, as they both had had affairs and he also seems like he was somewhat difficult \u2014 at one point, he threw her record player out a window, and he had a drinking problem. He shortly thereafter ODed on barbiturates, but did not die, and they eventually got divorced in 1980. I STRONGLY recommend you read this New York Times review of her autobiography, which I now want to read, as it is eyebrow-raisingly interesting. Hope Cooke has led a life right out of a Judith Krantz novel. (She\u2019s still alive and kicking around Brooklyn \u2014 or at least she was as of 1993, per this ALSO very interesting New York Times piece about her walking tours.) (I mean, she is definitely still alive. She simply may have moved.)\n\nThe short background: Her family was awful; Her mother died when the plane she was piloting solo crashed (perhaps intentionally) and her father subsequently bailed, so Hope and her sister and a series of extremely mean governesses lived across the hallway from Hope\u2019s (also mean!) grandparents. She and the Crown Prince met and fell in love when she went on a summer trip to India at 19. They bonded, it is implied, because they were both sort of sad souls; he was a widower whose childhood was also fraught, in no small part because, as Wiki puts it, \u201chis plans to study science at Cambridge were dashed when his elder brother, the crown prince, a member of the Indian Air Force was killed in a plane crash in 1941.\u201d (Surely their shared history of family plane crash tragedy helped bond them, if nothing else.) After the wedding, she was embraced as \u2014 as the NYT puts it \u2014 the \u201cGrace Kelly of the Himalayas\u201d until the deposition of the monarchy, at which point Newsweek allegedly switched the metaphor to Marie Antoinette. (A burn that I\u2019ve read reported in various articles in other publications but couldn\u2019t find in its original source; I do feel confident that the turn of events upending the monarchy in Sikkim was probably not wholly about her spending.)\n\nThe Washington Post, in a very interesting piece dating from around the divorce, writes of the wedding:\n\nFrom the beginning, though, it was the oddness that danced a dark shadow over her chances for happiness. Bad enough that her husband waltzed his other conquests in front of her on their wedding day, worse still was her sister-in-law, the elegantly beautiful, haughty Cocoola, who remarked on the eve of her wedding how inauspicious it would be if anything were to break, and then broke a saucer, scattering the millet seed it contained, a bad sign in itself. \u201cWorse still,\u201d Cooke writes in her autobiography, \u201cTime Change,\u201d \u201cthe more I look[ed] at the brocade pattern of my wedding dress, the more it seem[ed] that it had been stitched with the wrong side exposed. In Sikkim, a sign of death. Still, she lit the butter lamps in front of the images of Buddha and Guru Padmasambhava and offered a long white scarf to her father-in-law while 12 ambassadors, including John Kenneth Galbraith, and half the world\u2019s press looked on. The wedding festivities lasted a week.\n\nYou can see that ritual with the scarf here:\n\nThere aren\u2019t a ton of photos of this wedding beyond these two, which is a shame, as it looks like it was a very interesting ceremony. There is however, British newsreel footage that feels pretty comprehensive:\n\nIf only it were in color!\n\n[Photos: Shutterstock]"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/palden_thondup.namgyal/2119676", "page_content": "Palden Thondup Namgyal\n\npolitician\n\nMarch 23, 1923 (age 58) Gangtok, East Sikkim district, India\n\nAt six, Namgyal became a student at Saint Joseph\"s Convent in Kalimpong, but had to terminate his studies due to attacks of malaria.

That woman was Hope Cooke. It was based on her autobiography.\n\nIt spoke about how the American media was enamoured with an American marrying Crown Prince Palden Thondup Namgyal of Sikkim in 1963. The press always heavily followed any trips of theirs to the United States. Vogue wanted to know her beauty secrets. What the media did not know was that this so-called fairy tale was anything but.\n\nHope Cooke was born on 24 June 1940 in San Francisco, California to John J. Cooke and Hope Noyes. When Hope was not yet two, her mother died in a single person plane crash in 1942. Her father then moved her and her sister, Harriet, to New York City with him to an apartment that was across the hall from their maternal grandparents (who Hope claimed were aloof and refused to talk about her mother). Hope and Harriet were raised by governesses; one beat the future royal with a coat hanger when she could not remember the Lord\u2019s Prayer. Their grandfather died when Hope was 12, and their grandmother passed away just three years later when Hope was 15.\n\nFrom then, Hope and Harriet lived with their maternal aunt and uncle; the latter was the former US Ambassador to Iran and Peru. Hope studied at both the Chaplin School in New York and the Madeira School in Virginia. She completed her high school education in Iran.\n\nShe chose to continue her studies and head to university. She enrolled at Sarah Lawrence College in 1959 where she majored in Asian Studies. One summer she travelled to India with her later recalling, \u201cI\u2019ve never been so happy \u2026 India! My heart explodes \u2026 The East is my home\u2026\u201d It was in Darjeeling that she met the recently widowed Palden Thondup Namgyal, Crown Prince of Sikkim.\n\nThey became engaged two years later, in 1961, after bonding over what the New York Times called the \u201csimilar isolation of their childhoods.\u201d The couple did not marry until 1963 due to astrologers claiming 1962 was a bad year for marriages.\n\nThe Crown Prince and Hope wed after the latter had renounced her American citizenship, in a Buddhist monastery on 20 March 1963; their ceremony was officiated by 14 lamas \u2013 the title for a high priest in Tibetian Buddhism. Although the wedding was a Buddhist ceremony, Hope never converted from Christianity. However, she was known to have practised Buddhism from an early age.\n\nTogether, they had two children: Prince Palden Gyurmed Namgyal and Princess Hope Leezum Namgyal. Hope gained three stepchildren (Prince Tenzing Kunzang Jigme Namgyal, Prince Tobgyal Wangchuk Tenzing Namgyal and Princess Yangchen Dolma Namgyal) from the union who she adored. She vowed that her children would know happiness and not grow up with the sad family life like both their parents.\n\nJust two years after their nuptials, the Crown Prince was proclaimed Sikkim\u2019s monarch (Chogyal or King) on 4 April 1965. His reign would be short, as he was deposed ten years later on 10 April 1975. He was put under house arrest in the palace. Not long after, Hope and Palden separated with Hope returning with their two children to the United States.\n\nHope later described her ex-husband as a heavy-drinker, sexist and philanderer. He continued his affair that started before he married Hope with a Belgian woman during their marriage. However, she was not innocent as she was also having an affair with an American man.\n\nHer popularity waned with Newsweek even calling her the Himalayan Marie-Antoinette after Sikkim was annexed into India. A US Representative and US Senator co-sponsored a bill to give Hope her American citizenship back, but the bill would not pass until the language was altered to only give her permanent residence status. President Ford signed it in 1976. She and the Chogyal divorced in 1980. He died just two years later of cancer.\n\nIn 1983, she married for a second time to Mike Wallace, but this union did not last. She resided in London for a time, but she eventually returned to the United States.

Grandfather dies when she's 12, Granny dies three years later. She goes to live with her aunt and uncle, Mary and Selden Chapin, then the ambassador to Iran, and finishes high school there. One summer in her late teens she travels to India: ''I've never been so happy ... India! My heart explodes ... The East is my home ... I must stay near India somehow ...''\n\nHope Cooke is majoring in Asian studies at Sarah Lawrence when she meets the recently widowed Crown Prince of Sikkim in Darjeeling (where, with typical eccentricity, she is taking a course in typing). Two years later they are engaged. The writer immediately hints at the complex pragmatism of this alliance: Her impulse toward him may be inspired by her fascination with Indian spirituality and her desire for some kind of rootedness; his impulse toward her is in part prompted by his need to find a mother for his children. Both are also driven toward each other by the similar isolation of their childhoods. ''Even more than me,'' Hope muses about the Prince's ''Chaplinesque loneliness,'' ''when he was small he had a rather sad life.''\n\nHope Cooke is an exceptionally chaste adventuress who seeks the tamer shores of security rather than the wilder shores of love. She's perhaps more infatuated with the prospect of nesting in her little Oriental palace than she is with the moody king. ''I want a family so much. I want to fill this nest, make it a real home.'' One of the most touching aspects of this story is her delight in recapturing childhood through her affection for her three stepchildren, whom she seems to love quite as much as she will later love her own son and daughter. She exults when her modest (five-bedroom) palace explodes with offspring and the family consumes 12 dozen eggs a week. She has made a fierce resolution to reverse the karma that had saddened her childhood and her husband's.''These children will be happy. The wheel of unhappiness that both my husband and I grew up on will not go to this generation.''\n\nBut the monsters lurking in Hope's fairy tale appear soon after her marriage. The Crown Prince may well have been one of the Far East's most enlightened rulers, as both the author and the historical record confirm: He shaped a model Asian state whose literacy rate and per capita income were twice as high as the neighboring countries of Nepal, Bhutan and India; he retained a measure of independence for a tiny country threatened on two sides, by an India intent on annexation and an equally aggressive Communist-dominated Tibet. Yet, as Hope Cooke describes him, he was also a heavy-drinking philanderer with an odious streak of macho sexism. Notwithstanding his strained finances, the Crown Prince managed to maintain a love affair with a married woman in Belgium before and during his marriage to Hope; he even flew to visit her a few weeks before Hope's first child was born. The lover wrote letters to the Prince on ''crisp rustling paper'' that Hope could hear crinkling in her husband's bathrobe when he hugged her at night. If a letter dropped to the floor, she read it while he went to the altar to perform his Buddhist prayers.\n\nWhen Sikkim's independence was endangered by the death of Nehru, who had carefully preserved Sikkim's autonomy under the terms of a protectorate, the Crown Prince began to drink more and throw temper tantrums. During one such tantrum, he tosses Hope's record player, her ''lifeline to the West,'' out the window. Fairy tale turns to nightmare as Indira Gandhi conspires to deprive Sikkim of the little independence it has. While Hope entertains visiting reporters interested in ''My Thirty Ways of Preparing Yak,'' she is secretly tippling beer in the morning, living on whisky, Valium and cigarettes from noon on. She begins to realize that the manic fervor with which she'd developed Sikkim's cottage industries and helped her husband fight Indian domination is a substitute for a love that barely exists, if it ever existed. On one of her yearly trips to New York, she has an affair with a man who had been a friend during her lonely adolescence, and the memory of this affair haunts her for the rest of her stay in the Far East. She lies in bed more dazed than ever by whisky and Valium, listening to Joan Baez sing freedom songs."}]}
