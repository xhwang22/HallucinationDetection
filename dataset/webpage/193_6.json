However, injuries at the start of the following year \u2013 first at the opening round in Australia, followed by a car accident back in France \u2013 meant that Barrier was only able to take part in the final six rounds of 2014.

For his BMW Motorrad Italia GoldBet STK Team it was the second title win in three years competing in the series, after the triumphant season with Ayrton Badovini (ITA) back in 2010.\n\nIn the season\u2019s ten races, 23-year old Sylvain celebrated four victories, which was more than any other rider. In total, the Frenchman rode his RR to six podium finishes and claimed seven pole positions. Over the course of the year, he also showed his spirit to never give up. He fought his way back to the top after a setback halfway through the season when he suffered a severe shoulder injury that put him a long way back in his title campaign.

It was a tough race, but I was feeling very comfortable on the bike from the warm-up. I rode very carefully on the first two laps because the rear tyre was not warmed up properly and also Eddi La Marra and Bryan Staring had already crashed.

Two-time FIM Superstock 1000 Champion Sylvain Barrier is the rider chosen to race the EVO-spec version of the BMW S1000RR in the upcoming eni FIM Superbike World Championship season. We caught up with BMW Motorrad Italia Director Andrea Buzzoni, not long after the team\u2019s first test of the year at Portimao.\n\nWhat is this new project all about? What are the goals for 2014?\n\n\n\n\u201cAs BMW Italia we are continuing our involvement in allowing Sylvain Barrier to race in the EVO class in 2014. It will be his fourth year with us and together we achieved tremendous results. Our new project is based on two pillars: one is the rider, and the other one is the team, which puts together the best expertise BMW Italia was able to bring so far. I\u2019m talking about our Sporting and Technical Director Dino Acocella, who started with us in STK but in the last two years he mostly focused on the SBK side of the garage. He is the perfect guy for this new EVO campaign. Our crew chief will be Rossano Innocenti, who has won six STK1000 titles in seven years, 3 with Ducati and 3 with BMW Italia.\n\nI can say we go back to our BMW Italia roots, even though we will still keep in close contact with BMW Motorrad, as they will use our project to gather information for BMW sporting products. One of Berti Hauser\u2019s \u2013 2014 new Motorsport director ad BMW Motorrad - guys will be with us for the whole season. The goal is to win the EVO title, but we know there\u2019ll be a lot of competition, as half of the grid will be racing on EVO bikes.\u201d\n\nHow the new EVO formula gels with your new venture?\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the technical side I think we are in a good position for the EVO, as we have an excellent package to start from. The EVO class will help teams saving a lot of money on the engine and electronics R&D side, that usually strongly depends on the manufacturer involvement in the series. I don\u2019t think a private team can get to the level of the official ones, with the current WSBK rules, in terms of engine and electronic development, money invested and expertise.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe EVO class makes it all about rider, bike and team. Performance wise, as we could see at Portimao during our first test, there is not a lot of room for improvement on the engine and electronics, that means that most of the difference will be made by the work done on the chassis. On corner exit the full-WSBK machines are on a whole different level, but corner speed wise the gap is not that big.\u201d\n\nSylvain has already shown great speed, but how do you think he will deal with race starts \u2013 probably his Achille\u2019s heel \u2013 and the two (longer) races on the same day?\n\n\n\n\u201cI have seen worse about race starts (laughs), I mean it surely isn\u2019t his strong point, but I would say he gets 50% of race starts right. We need to work on this. On the other hand I\u2019m really confident about his race pace and consistency, because Sylvain has been training like a Superbike rider for at least a couple of years now. He is mentally focused and he trains really hard, thanks also to James (Toseland).\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.crash.net/wsbk/news/196804/1/sstk-champion-barrier-to-make-wsbk-bow", "page_content": "By Christina Bulpett\n\nSylvain Barrier will make his World Superbike Championship debut at the season-ending Jerez round with BMW as a reward for winning back-to-back FIM Superstock 1000 Cups for the manufacturer.\n\nThe Frenchman had been tipped for a one-off outing with the BMW GoldBet team after becoming the first rider since James Ellison to pick up two consecutive Superstock 1000 titles one round early at Magny-Cours.\n\nA long-awaited debut for a rider that has dominated the Superstock 1000 class over the past two years, he is delighted to be getting his chance.\n\n\"This is really great news!
