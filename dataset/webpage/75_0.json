Library of Congress\n\n\"Even as an undergraduate he betrayed what many people believe to be the central passion of his life, an inordinate desire to be arrested.\" \u2014 Walter Lippman, 1914\n\nJohn Reed \u2014 writer, reporter, activist and playboy \u2014 was a legend even to his contemporaries. Born to a well-to-do Oregon family, a graduate of Harvard, and a steadfast socialist, Reed lived what many would call a terrifying life of his own making and desire.\n\nAdventurer\n\nIn the innocent, hopeful years before World War I, and scarcely out of Harvard, Reed embarked on a rebellious course that led him to befriend the Wobblies (Industrial Workers of the World), to write for Max Eastman's The Masses, to ride with the guerrilla forces of Pancho Villa, and to rush into the maw of the Russian Revolution just as the Bolsheviks brought an end to Czarist rule.\n\nBohemian Figure\n\nHe was a knight of American Bohemia, and a habitu\u00e9 of its capital, New York City's Greenwich Village. There he communed with an eclectic array of intellectuals, writers, and artists -- including Emma Goldman. His acquaintances advocated free speech and free love, and were committed to the cause of anarchism. One of them, the journalist Louise Bryant, became his wife and followed him to Russia twice -- once to write about the revolution as it continued to unfold, and once more to join her husband after his arrest and imprisonment. Reed and Bryant were determined \"to smash through the hull of custom and tradition,\" the editor Max Eastman observed, \"and touch at all times and over the earth the raw current of life.\"\n\nWar Protester\n\nWhen World War I broke out in Europe, it cast a pall over the generally pacifist \"lyrical Left.\" Reed wrote an article for The Masses entitled \"The Trader's War,\" criticizing the hypocritical mincing-machine of a war whose aim was profits through the sale of armaments. Three years later, at Emma Goldman's trial in June 1917 for obstructing the draft, Reed said the war was an \"overture to the blackest month for free men our generation has known. With hideous apathy the country has acquiesced in a regime of judicial tyranny, bureaucratic suppression and industrial barbarism. In America, law is merely the instrument for good or evil of the most powerful interest, and there are no Constitutional safeguards worth the powder to blow them to hell.\"\n\nWitness to Revolution\n\nReed's reporting of the Russian Revolution in 1917 brought him lasting fame. He arrived in Petrograd in time to witness the Bolshevik seizure of power in October. His now famous book, Ten Days That Shook the World was the first major account of the revolution to appear in America. \"From his typewriter,\" the historian Robert Rosenstone wrote, \"would flow hundreds of thousands of words about the origins and workings of Soviets, Kerensky and the Provisional Government, workers' control of factories, the state of the army, the character of the Russian people, Bolshevism, the personalities of Lenin, Trotsky, Lunacharsky and other leaders, the tangled web of foreign affairs, the meaning of counterrevolution, the implications of the revolution for the rest of the world.\" Reed's politics had always been passionately left-wing. They were now socialist in spirit, and communist in practice, meaning that his socialism responded to the Kremlin's dictates. From 1917 on, Reed's positions -- and those of other American left-wingers -- were always formed in dialogue, either for or against, with Moscow's Comintern (Communist International).\n\nTheory and Practice\n\nIn the fall of 1919, Reed made his last trip to Russia. After several months of observing how unstable Russia had become -- the government was now suppressing its citizens with summary executions -- Reed made plans to leave. The first leg of Reed's long journey home took him to the Astoria Hotel in Petrograd. Learning that Emma Goldman had just arrived in Russia after her deportation from the U.S., wrote Rosenstone, \"Jack burst into her room 'like a sudden ray of light.' Over a steaming cup of coffee, they celebrated a reunion.\" Almost immediately, Goldman brought up the uncomfortable topic of state power and demanded to know about the Cheka (the Bolshevik secret police). \"Reminded of all the old Russian revolutionists who had broken with the Bolsheviks, Jack blurted, 'You are a little confused by the Revolution in action because you have dealt with it only in theory.'\"\n\nUp Against the Revolution\n\nReed's causes often put him at mortal risk. Such was the case in Russia in 1919, as he passed through regions torn by civil war as he traveled home. He was arrested and imprisoned in Finland, just before the ship on which he stowed away was to sail to America. After his release, Reed returned to Petrograd to recover. In July 1919, he attended Comintern's Second Congress in Moscow. His militancy on the question of trade unionism alienated him from Russian leaders who had in mind consolidating their power over a populace that had to learn \"compromise\" and subjugation of individualist concerns.\n\nHero in Russia\n\nIn September 1919, at Reed's request, Louise Bryant traveled to Moscow to join her husband. She found him \"older and sadder.\" Their reunion was short-lived. Weak from prison and suffering from a long battle with kidney disease, Reed succumbed to typhus. He died on October 17, 1920, in a Moscow hospital with his Bryant by his side. He was thirty-three years old. John Reed was buried at the base of the Kremlin Wall, a Hero of the Revolution.\n\nImmortalized On Film\n\nIn 1981 actor and director Warren Beatty made a three-and-a-half-hour film based on Ten Days That Shook the World, using documentary interviews with Reed's surviving contemporaries as interludes in the film. Beatty himself played the character of John Reed, and Diane Keaton played Louise Bryant. Maureen Stapleton played Emma Goldman, winning an Oscar for her performance."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/john-reed-4/", "page_content": "John Silas \"Jack\" Reed (October 22, 1887 \u2013 October 17, 1920) was an American journalist, poet, and socialist activist, best remembered for his first-hand account of the Bolshevik Revolution, Ten Days That Shook the World. He was married to writer and feminist Louise Bryant. Reed died in Russia in 1920, and was buried at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, one of only three Americans to have been given this honor in Russia, the others being labor organizer Bill Haywood, and Charles Ruthenburg, the founder of the Communist Party USA.\n\nEarly life\n\nJohn Reed was born on October 22, 1887, in his maternal grandmother's mansion in Portland, Oregon, with Chinese servants in today's Goose Hollow neighborhood. He wrote of paying a nickel to a \"Goose Hollowite\" (young toughs in a gang in the working-class neighborhood below King's Hill) to keep from being beaten up. A memorial bench overlooks the site of Reed's birthplace in Washington Park. His mother, Margaret Green Reed, was the daughter of a leading Portland citizen who had made a fortune through three enterprises: as owner of the first gas works in Oregon, owner of the first pig iron smelter on the west coast, and as second owner of the Portland water works. John's father, Charles Jerome Reed, was the representative of an agricultural machinery manufacturer who had come to town from the East. With his ready wit, he quickly won acceptance in Portland\u2019s business community. The family's wealth came from the Green side, not the Eastern-transplanted Reed side. His parents were married in 1886.\n\nA sickly child, young \"Jack\" grew up surrounded by nurses and servants, and his upper-class playmates were carefully selected. His brother, Harry, was two years younger. Jack and his brother were sent to the recently established Portland Academy, a private school. Jack was bright enough to pass his courses but could not be bothered to work for top marks, as he found school dry and tedious. In September 1904, Jack was sent to Morristown School in New Jersey to prepare for college as his father, who never attended a university, wanted his sons to go to Harvard. At this prep school, Jack continued his track record of poor classroom performance, although he did make the football team and showed literary promise.\n\nThe Harvard Monthly Vol.44 (1907) Vol.44 (1907)\n\nReed failed in his first attempt on the admission exam but passed on his second try and in the fall of 1906 he entered Harvard College. Tall, handsome, and light-hearted, he threw himself into all manner of student activities. He was a member of the cheerleading team, the swimming team, and the dramatic club. He served on the editorial boards of the Lampoon and The Harvard Monthly and as president of the Harvard Glee Club. In 1910 he held the position of \u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03cc\u03b4\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 in the Hasty Pudding Theatricals and also wrote music and lyrics for their show Diana's Debut. Reed failed to make the Harvard teams for football and crew, but excelled in other sports of lesser prestige, swimming and water polo. He was also made Ivy orator and poet in his senior year of college.\n\nReed also attended meetings of the Socialist Club, over which his friend Walter Lippmann presided, but he never joined. Still, the club left its impact on his psyche. The group had social legislation introduced into the state legislature, attacked the university for failing to pay its servants living wages, and petitioned the administration for the establishment of a course in Socialism. Reed later recalled:\n\nAll this made no ostensible difference in the look of Harvard society, and probably the club-men and the athletes, who represented us to the world, never even heard of it. But it made me, and many others, realize that there was something going on in the dull outside world more thrilling than college activities, and turned our attention to the writings of men like H.G. Wells and Graham Wallas, wrenching us away from the Oscar Wildian dilettantism which had possessed undergraduate litterateurs for generations.\n\nReed graduated from Harvard College in 1910, and that summer he set out to see more of the \"dull outside world,\" visiting England, France, and Spain before returning home to America the following spring. Reed chose to work for his fare to Europe on a cattle boat and experience the way of a common laborer. Reed's traveling was encouraged by his favorite professor, Charles Townsend Copeland or \"Copey\", who told him he must \"see life\" if he wanted to successfully write about it.\n\nCareer\n\nBohemian journalist\n\nJohn Reed had determined to become a journalist and he set out to make his mark in the big city in which that industry was based, New York. Reed made use of a valuable contact he had made at Harvard, the muckraking journalist Lincoln Steffens, who appreciated Reed's skills and intellect at an early date. Steffens landed his young admirer an entry-level position on The American Magazine, reading manuscripts, correcting proofs, and later helping with the composition. Reed supplemented his insufficient salary by taking an additional job as the business manager of a new short-lived quarterly magazine called Landscape Architecture.\n\nA native of Oregon, John Reed made New York City the base of his operations. A native of Oregon, John Reed made New York City the base of his operations.\n\nReed made his home in Greenwich Village, a burgeoning hub of poets and artists. He came to love New York, relentlessly exploring it and writing poems about it. His formal jobs on the magazines paid the rent, but it was as a freelance journalist that Reed sought to establish himself. He collected rejection slips circulating an essay and short stories about his six months in Europe, eventually breaking through in The Saturday Evening Post. Within a year, Reed had other work accepted by Collier's, The Forum, and The Century Magazine. One of his poems had been set to music by composer Arthur Foote, and the editors at The American had come to see him as a contributor and begun to publish his work. Reed was a young man on the rise.\n\nReed's serious interest in social problems was first aroused at about this time by Steffens and Ida Tarbell, and once aroused it quickly led him to a far more radical position than theirs. In 1913 he joined the staff of The Masses, edited by Max Eastman. Reed contributed more than 50 articles, reviews, and shorter pieces to this publication.\n\nThe first of Reed's many arrests came in Paterson, New Jersey, in 1913, for attempting to speak on behalf of strikers in the New Jersey silk mills. The harsh treatment meted out by the authorities to the strikers and a short jail term which followed further radicalized him. Reed allied himself with the syndicalist trade union the Industrial Workers of the World at this time. Reed's account of his experiences appeared in June as an article \"War in Paterson.\" During the same year, following a suggestion made by IWW leader Bill Haywood, Reed put on \"The Pageant of the Paterson Strike\" in Madison Square Garden as a benefit for the strikers.\n\nIn the autumn of 1913 Reed was sent to Mexico by the Metropolitan Magazine to report the Mexican Revolution. He shared the perils of Pancho Villa's army for four months, and was with Villa's Constitutional (Constitutionalist) Army (whose \"Primer Jefe\" political chief was Venustiano Carranza) when it defeated Federal forces at Torre\u00f3n, opening the way for its advance on Mexico City. Reed adored Villa, while Carranza left him cold.\n\nReed's time with the Villistas resulted in a series of outstanding magazine articles that brought Reed a national reputation as a war correspondent. Reed deeply sympathized with the plight of the peons and vehemently opposed American intervention, which came shortly after he left. Reed's Mexican reports were later republished in book form as Insurgent Mexico, which appeared in 1914.\n\nOn April 30, 1914, Reed arrived in Colorado, scene of the recent Ludlow massacre. There he spent a little more than a week and investigated the events, spoke on behalf of the miners, wrote an impassioned article on the subject (\"The Colorado War\", published in July), and came to believe much more deeply in class conflict. That summer he spent in Provincetown, Massachusetts with Mabel Dodge and her son, putting together Insurgent Mexico and interviewing President Wilson on the subject. The resulting report, much watered down at White House insistence, was not a success.\n\nWar correspondent\n\nOn August 14, 1914, shortly after Germany declared war on France, he set sail for neutral Italy, having been sent by the Metropolitan. He met his lover, Mabel Dodge, in Naples, and the pair made their way to Paris. Reed saw the war as having emerged from imperialist commercial rivalries and showed little sympathy for any of the participants. In an unsigned piece entitled \"The Traders\u2019 War,\" published in the September 1914 issue of The Masses, Reed passionately wrote:\n\n\"The real War, of which this sudden outburst of death and destruction is only an incident, began long ago. It has been raging for tens of years, but its battles have been so little advertised that they have been hardly noted. It is a clash of Traders...\n\n\"What has democracy to do in alliance with Nicholas, the Tsar? Is it Liberalism which is marching from the Petersburg of Father Gapon, from the Odessa of the pogroms?...\n\n\"No. There is a falling out among commercial rivals....\n\n\"We, who are Socialists, must hope \u2014 we may even expect \u2014 that out of this horror of bloodshed and dire destruction will come far-reaching social changes \u2014 and a long step forward towards our goal of Peace among Men.\n\n\"But we must not be duped by this editorial buncombe about Liberalism going forth to Holy War against Tyranny.\n\n\"This is not Our War.\"\n\nIn France, he was frustrated by wartime censorship and the difficulty of accessing the front. Reed and Dodge went to London, and Dodge soon left for New York, to the relief of Reed. The rest of 1914 he spent drinking with French prostitutes and pursuing an affair with a German woman. The pair went to Berlin in early December. While there, Reed interviewed Karl Liebknecht, who was one of the few socialists in Germany to vote against war credits. Reed was deeply disappointed by the general collapse in working-class solidarity promised by the Second International, and by its replacement with militarism and nationalism.\n\nJohn Reed, c. 1917 John Reed, c. 1917\n\nHe returned to New York in the middle of that month and occupied himself writing about the war. A return to Central Europe followed in 1915, a journey on which he was accompanied by Canadian artist and frequent Masses contributor Boardman Robinson. Traveling from Thessaloniki, they met scenes of profound devastation in Serbia (including a bombed-out Belgrade), also going through Bulgaria and Romania. They passed through the Jewish Pale of Settlement in Bessarabia, and in Che\u0142m they were arrested, incarcerated for several weeks and liable to be shot for espionage had not the American ambassador shown some interest.\n\nTraveling to Russia, Reed was outraged to learn that the ambassador in Petrograd was inclined to believe they were spies. Reed and Robinson were re-arrested when they tried to slip into Romania. This time it was the British ambassador (Robinson being a British subject) who finally secured permission for them to leave, but not before all their papers were seized in Kiev. In Bucharest the duo spent time piecing together their journey, with Reed at one point traveling to Constantinople in hopes of seeing action at Gallipoli. These experiences led to Reed's book, The War in Eastern Europe, published in April 1916.\n\nAfter returning to New York, he paid a visit to his mother in Portland, where he met and fell in love with Louise Bryant, who joined him on the East coast in January 1916. Though happy, both had affairs with others rather freely, in accord with the bohemian sensibilities of sexual liberation in common currency in that day. Early in 1916 Reed met Eugene O'Neill, and beginning that May the three rented a cottage in Provincetown. Not long after, Bryant and O'Neill began a romance.\n\nThat summer Reed donned his reporter's hat and covered the Presidential nominating conventions. Reed himself endorsed Woodrow Wilson, believing that he would make good on his promise to keep America out of the war. In November 1916 he married to Louise Bryant in Peekskill, New York. In the same year he underwent an operation to remove a kidney at Johns Hopkins Hospital and he was hospitalized until mid-December. The operation rendered him ineligible for conscription and saved him from registering as a conscientious objector. During 1916 he also published privately Tamburlaine and Other Poems in an edition of 500 copies.\n\nAs the country raced towards war, the radical Reed was marginalized: his relationship with the Metropolitan was over. John pawned his late father's watch and sold his Cape Cod cottage to birth control activist and sex educator Margaret Sanger. When Wilson asked for a declaration of war on April 2, 1917, Reed shouted at a hastily convened meeting of the People's Council in Washington: \"This is not my war, and I will not support it. This is not my war, and I will have nothing to do with it.\" In July and August Reed continued to write aggressive articles for The Masses, which the United States Postal Service refused to mail, and for Seven Arts, which as a result of an article by Reed and one earlier in the summer by Randolph Bourne, had its financial backing cut off and ceased publication. Reed was stunned by the nation's pro-war fervor and his career lay in ruins.\n\nWitness to the Russian Revolution\n\nOn August 17, 1917, Reed and Bryant set sail from New York to Europe, having first provided the State Department with legally sworn assurances that neither would represent the Socialist Party at a forthcoming conference in Stockholm. The pair were going as working journalists to see for themselves and report upon the sensational developments taking place in the fledgling republic of Russia. Traveling by way of Finland, the pair arrived in the capital city of Petrograd immediately after the failed military coup of monarchist General Lavr Kornilov, an attempt to topple the Provisional Government of Alexander Kerensky by force of arms. Reed and Bryant found the Russian economy was in shambles and several of the subject nationalities of the old empire, such as Finland and Ukraine, autonomous and seeking to forge a military accommodation with Germany.\n\nReed and Bryant wound up at ground zero for the October Revolution, in which the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (bolshevik) headed by Vladimir Lenin toppled the Kerensky government in what they believed to be the first blow struck in a worldwide socialist revolution.\n\nThe food situation in the capital was dire. Reed later recalled:\n\nThe last month of the Kerensky regime was marked first by the falling off of the bread supply from 2 pounds a day to 1 pound, to half a pound, to a quarter of a pound, and, the final week, no bread at all. Holdups and crime increased to such an extent that you could hardly walk down the streets. The papers were full of it. Not only had the government broken down, but the municipal government had absolutely broken down. The city militia was quite disorganized and up in the air, and the street-cleaning apparatus and all that sort of thing had broken down \u2014 milk and everything of that sort.\"\n\nA mood for radical change was in the air. The Bolsheviks, seeking an all-socialist government and immediate end to Russian participation in the war, sought the transfer of power from Kerensky to a Congress of Soviets, a gathering of elected workers' and soldiers' deputies to be convened in October. The Kerensky government saw this as a clear effort to replace its own regime with another and moved to shut down the Bolshevik press, issuing warrants of arrest for the Soviet leaders and preparing to transfer the troops of the Petrograd garrison, believed to be unreliable, back to the front. A Military Revolutionary Committee of the Soviets, dominated by the Bolshevik Party, determined to seize power on behalf of the future Congress of Soviets and at 11 pm on the evening of November 7, 1917, it captured the Winter Palace, seat of Kerensky's government. Reed and Bryant were present during the fall of the Winter Palace, the symbolic event which initiated the Bolshevik Revolution.\n\nThe cover of this 1919 British pamphlet emphasizes Reed's short-lived status as Soviet consul. The cover of this 1919 British pamphlet emphasizes Reed's short-lived status as Soviet consul.\n\nReed was an enthusiastic supporter of the new revolutionary socialist government and he went to work for the new People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, translating decrees and news of the actions of the new government into English. \"I also collaborated in the gathering of material and data and distributing of papers to go into the German trenches,\" Reed later recalled.\n\nReed was close to the inner circle of the new government. He met Leon Trotsky and was introduced to Lenin during a break of the Constituent Assembly on January 18, 1918. By December, his funds were nearly exhausted and he took employment with an American, Raymond Robins of the Red Cross. Robins wished to set up a newspaper promoting American interests; Reed complied, but in the dummy issue he prepared he included a warning beneath the masthead: \"This paper is devoted to promoting the interests of American capital.\"\n\nThe dissolution of the Constituent Assembly left Reed unmoved, and two days later, armed with a rifle, he joined a patrol of Red Guards prepared to defend the Foreign Office from counter-revolutionary attack. Reed then attended the opening of the Third Congress of Soviets, where he gave a short speech promising to bring the news of the revolution to America, where he hoped it would \"call forth an answer from America's oppressed and exploited masses.\" American journalist Edgar Sisson told Reed that he was being used by the Bolsheviks for their propaganda, a rebuke he accepted. In January, Trotsky, responding to Reed's concern about the safety of his substantial archive, offered Reed the post of Soviet Consul in New York; as the United States did not recognize the Bolshevik government, his credentials would almost certainly have been rejected and he faced prison (which would have given the Bolsheviks some propaganda material). The appointment was viewed as a massive blunder by most Americans in Petrograd, and the businessman Alex Gumberg directly approached Lenin, showing him a prospectus in which Reed called for massive American capital support for Russia and for the setting up of a newspaper to express the American viewpoint on the negotiations at Brest-Litovsk. Lenin found the proposal unsavory and withdrew the nomination; thereafter, Reed only mentioned Gumberg's name with a string of epithets attached.\n\nBoth Reed and Bryant netted books from their Russian experiences, with Bryant's Six Red Months in Russia appearing first and Reed's 10 Days That Shook the World, published early in 1919, garnering the most notice.\n\nWhile Bryant had made her way home to the United States in January 1918, Reed did not reach New York City until April 28, 1918. On his way back to the USA, Reed traveled from Russia to Finland; he did not have a visa or passport while crossing to Finland. In Turku harbor, when Reed was boarding a ship on his way to Stockholm, Finnish police arrested Reed and took him to Kakola prison in Turku until he was released. From Finland, Reed traveled to Kristiania, Norway via Stockholm. Because he remained under indictment in the Masses case, Reed was immediately met by federal authorities, who held him on board his ship for more than eight hours while they searched his belongings. Reed's irreplaceable papers were seized, the raw material from which he intended to write his book, and he was released upon his own recognizance after his attorney, Morris Hillquit, promised to make him available at the Federal Building the next day. His papers were not returned to him until seven months later, in November 1918.\n\nRadical political activist\n\nBack in America, Reed and Bryant took pains to defend the Bolsheviks and oppose American intervention, but a hyper-patriotic public incensed at Russia's departure from the war against Germany, gave him a generally cold reception. While he was in Russia, his articles in The Masses and particularly a headline, \"Knit a straight-jacket for your soldier boy\", had been largely instrumental in bringing an indictment against that magazine for sedition. The first Masses trial ended in a hung jury the day before he arrived; the defendants, including himself, were to be retried, so after returning, he immediately posted $2,000 bail on April 29.\n\nCover of Reed's Voice of Labor, October 1919 Cover of Reed'sOctober 1919\n\nThe second Masses trial also ended in a hung jury. In Philadelphia, he stood outside a closed hall on May 31, harangued a crowd of 1,000 until police dragged him away, was charged with inciting a riot, and posted $5,000 bail. He was now more aggressively political, intolerant, and self-destructive; his third arrest since his return from Russia came on September 14, when he was charged with violating the Sedition Act and freed on $5,000 bail. This was a day after possibly the largest demonstration for Bolshevik Russia held in the United States (in The Bronx), when Reed passionately defended the revolution, which he seemed to think was coming to America as well. He tried to prevent Allied intervention, arguing that the Russians were contributing to the war effort by checking German ambitions in the Ukraine and Japanese designs on Siberia, but this came to naught.\n\nOn February 21\u201322, 1919, Bryant was fiercely grilled before a Senate committee exploring Bolshevik propaganda activities in the US, but emerged resilient; Reed followed on the 22nd, delivering quick, subtle testimony which was, however, savagely distorted by the press. Later that day he went to Philadelphia to stand trial for his May speech; despite a hostile judge, press, and patriotic speech by the prosecutor, Reed's lawyer convinced the jury the case was about free speech, and he was acquitted. Returning to New York, Reed continued speaking widely and participating in the various twists of socialist politics that year. He served as editor of The New York Communist, the weekly newspaper issued by the Left Wing Section of Greater New York.\n\nAffiliated with the Left Wing of the Socialist Party, Reed with the other radicals was expelled from the National Socialist Convention in Chicago on August 30, 1919. The radicals then split into two bitterly hostile groups, forming the Communist Labor Party of America (Reed's, in the creation of which he had been indispensable) and, the next day, the Communist Party of America. Reed was the international delegate of the former, wrote its manifesto and platform, edited its paper, The Voice of Labor, and was denounced as \"Jack the Liar\" in the Communist Party organ, The Communist. Reed's writings of 1919 displayed doubts about Western-style democracy and defended the dictatorship of the proletariat, which he saw as a necessary step that would prefigure the true democracy \"based upon equality and the liberty of the individual.\"\n\nComintern functionary\n\nIndicted for sedition and hoping to secure Comintern backing for the CLP, Reed fled from America in early October 1919 on a Scandinavian frigate by means of a forged passport, working his way to Bergen as a stoker. Given shore leave, he disappeared to Kristiania, crossed into Sweden on October 22, passed through Finland and made his way to Moscow by train. In the cold winter of 1919\u20131920, he traveled in the region around Moscow, observing factories, communes, and villages; filling notebooks; and carrying on an affair with a Russian woman. His feelings about the revolution were now ambiguous: on the one hand, he told Emma Goldman, who had recently arrived aboard Buford and especially complained about the Cheka, that the enemies of the revolution deserved their fate. However, he suggested that she see Angelica Balabanoff, a critic of the current situation, indicating he wanted Goldman to hear the other side.\n\nCover of the 1922 German edition of 10 Days That Shook The World, published by the Comintern in Hamburg Cover of the 1922 German edition of, published by the Comintern in Hamburg\n\nReed, although facing the threat of arrest in Illinois, tried to return home in February 1920. At that time, the Soviets organized a convention to establish a United Communist Party of America. Reed attempted to leave Russia through Latvia, but his train never arrived, forcing him to hitch a ride in the boxcar of an eastbound military train to Petrograd. In March, he crossed into Helsinki, where he had radical friends, including a future politician and SDKL member of parliament Hella Wuolijoki. With their help he was hidden in the hold of a freighter. On the 13th, customs officials found him in a coal bunker on the ship. He was taken to the police station, where he maintained that he was the seaman \"Jim Gormley\". Eventually, the jewels, photographs, letters, and fake documents he had in his possession forced him to reveal his true identity. Although beaten several times and threatened with torture, he refused to surrender the names of his local contacts. As a result of his silence, he was not able to be tried for treason, and was instead convicted of smuggling and having jewels in his possession (102 small diamonds worth $14,000, which were confiscated).\n\nThe US Secretary of State was satisfied with Reed's arrest and pressured the Finns for his papers. American authorities, however, remained indifferent to Reed's fate. Although Reed paid the fine for smuggling, he was still detained illegally, and his physical condition and state of mind deteriorated rapidly. He suffered from depression and insomnia, wrote alarming letters to Bryant, and on May 18 threatened a hunger strike. He was finally released in early June, and sailed for Tallinn, Estonia, on the 5th. Two days later, he traveled to Petrograd, recuperating from malnutrition and scurvy caused by having been fed dried fish almost exclusively, but his spirits were high.\n\nAt the end of June, Reed traveled to Moscow and, after discussing with Bryant the possibility of her joining him, she gained passage on a Swedish tramp steamer and arrived in Gothenburg on August 10. At the same time, Reed attended the second Comintern congress. Although his mood was as jovial and boisterous as ever, his physical appearance had deteriorated; he was quite thin, seemed weak and was sallow and his face lined.\n\nDuring this congress, Reed bitterly objected to the deference other revolutionaries showed to the Russians, who assumed the tide of revolutionary fervor was ebbing, making it necessary for the Communist party to work within the existing institutions \u2013 a policy Reed felt would be disastrous. He was contemptuous of the bullying tactics displayed during the congress by Karl Radek and Grigory Zinoviev, who ordered Reed to attend the Congress of the Peoples of the East to be held at Baku on August 15.\n\nThe journey to Baku was a long one, five days by train through countryside devastated by civil war and infected by typhus. Reed was reluctant to go and asked to arrive later, as he had planned to go first to Petrograd, where Bryant was arriving from Murmansk. Zinoviev insisted Reed take the official train: \"the Comintern has made a decision. Obey.\" Reed would normally have rebelled at being spoken to with such contempt, but he needed Soviet good-will at the moment and was not prepared for a final break with the Comintern, so he made the trip with great reluctance. Reed's actions and feelings during this time are a matter of speculation, but years after abandoning Communism, his friend Benjamin Gitlow asserted that the treatment Reed received from Zinoviev filled Reed with bitter disillusionment for the Communist movement.\n\nDuring his time in Baku, Reed received a telegram announcing Bryant's arrival in Moscow. He followed her there, arriving on September 15, and was able to tell her of the events of the preceding eight months. He appeared older and his clothes were in tatters. While in Moscow, he took her to meet Lenin, Trotsky, Lev Kamenev, and other leading Bolsheviks, and also to visit Moscow's ballet and art galleries.\n\nDeath\n\nReed was determined to return home, but fell ill on September 25. At first thought, mistakenly, to have influenza, he was hospitalized five days later and was found to have spotted typhus. Bryant spent all her time with him, but there were no medicines to be obtained because of the Allied blockade. His mind started to wander, and then he lost the use of the right side of his body and could no longer speak. His wife was holding his hand when he died in Moscow on October 17, 1920. After a hero's funeral, his body was buried at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.\n\nJohn Reed's body lying in state, Moscow 1920 John Reed's body lying in state, Moscow 1920\n\nLegacy\n\nThe uses of Reed as a symbol in popular culture have been varied. Some have dismissed him as a \"romantic revolutionary\" and a \"playboy\", a vapid dilettante pretending to profess revolutionary sensibilities. For the Communist movement to which he belonged, Reed became a symbol of the international nature of the Bolshevik revolution, a martyr buried at the Kremlin wall amidst solemn fanfare, his name to be uttered reverently as a member of the radical pantheon. Others, such as his old friend and comrade Benjamin Gitlow, made the claim that Reed had begun to shun the bureaucracy and violence of Soviet Communism late in his life and have thus sought to posthumously enlist Reed in their own anti-communist cause.\n\nReed has also been an influence upon the cinema. Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein's influential 1927 silent film October: Ten Days That Shook the World was based on Reed's book.\n\nJohn Dos Passos included a highly stylized, brief biography of Reed in his 1932 novel/history work titled 1919 that was the second part of his U.S.A. trilogy.\n\nHalf a century later, Warren Beatty made the 1981 film Reds, based on the life of Reed. Beatty starred as Reed, while Diane Keaton played the part of Louise Bryant and Jack Nicholson that of Eugene O'Neill. The movie won three Academy Awards, and was nominated for nine others.\n\nThe 1958 Soviet film In October Days (Russian: \u0412 \u0434\u043d\u0438 \u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f), directed by the highly regarded Sergei Vasilyev, also featured roles for Reed and Bryant.\n\nTwo films are based on Reed's accounts of the Mexican Revolution: the 1973 film Reed: Insurgent Mexico, by Mexican director Paul Leduc, and the two-part Mexican\u2013Soviet-Italian co-production consisting of Red Bells (1982) and Red Bells II (1983), both directed by Sergei Bondarchuk, with Franco Nero as Reed."}, {"url": "https://alphahistory.com/russianrevolution/historian-john-reed/", "page_content": "John Reed was more journalist than historian and his popular Russian Revolution book, Ten Days that Shook the World, is more partisan commentary than history.

He is probably best known as the author of Ten Days That Shook the World, his account of the Bolshevik Revolution which he reportedly wrote from his home at 1 Patchin Place.\n\nReed was born on October 22, 1887 to a wealthy family in Portland, Oregon. After graduating from Harvard University in 1910 where he was the editor of the University\u2019s monthly magazine, he took on a number of journalism assignments and moved to bohemian Greenwich Village to be among other writers, intellectuals and artists. His first home here was at 42 Washington Square and from there he explored the surrounding eclectic community of artists, immigrants and political and social activists. Based on this experience, he wrote his poem \u2018The Day in Bohemia\u201d in 1912. Here is an excerpt:\n\nTwixt Broadway and Sixth Avenue,\n\nAnd West perhaps a block or two,\u2013\n\nFrom Third Street up, and Ninth Street down,\n\nBetween Fifth Avenue and the Town,\u2013\n\nPoliceman walk as free as air,\n\nWith nothing on their minds but hair,\n\nAnd life is very, very fair\n\nIn Washington Square.\n\nBohemia!

His involvement in activism started with his (as well as other Villagers\u2019) role in advocating for striking silk workers in Patterson, New Jersey in 1913. In 1914 Reed was sent to cover the Mexican Revolution; for four months, he traveled alongside Pancho Villa and his guerilla peasants, sending reports back home which contradicted the prevailing American reports which portrayed the Mexican revolutionary as a villian.\n\nMax Eastman\u2019s Marxist magazine The Masses sent Reed to Russia during that country\u2019s Bolshevik Revolution. He arrived in Petrograd in October of 1917 with his wife Louise Bryant, also a journalist, as the Bolsheviks seized power. Reed was a supporter of the new socialist government that took over Russia and he wrote extensive notes chronicling the revolution which became the basis of his book Ten Days that Shook the World. Bryant also wrote a book based on her experience in Russia, Six Red Months in Russia.\n\nBy 1919 Reed, along with activist Benjamin Gitlow, led a portion of the Socialist Party\u2019s left wing to form the Communist Labor Party, one of the two early communist organizations in this nation which would lead to the founding of the Communist Party of the USA. He also served as a contributing editor of its initial journal, The Revolutionary Age and then became editor of The Communist (today, known as Political Affairs).\n\nOn another trip to Russia where he was received as a hero, he developed typhus and died at the age of 33 in 1920.

Reed first gained prominence as a war correspondent during the first World War. He and his wife, fellow journalist Louise Bryant, were in Petrograd, Russia when the October Revolution broke out. He catalogued those events in his book Ten Days That Shook the World.\n\nReed was not only a witness to the revolution, but an enthusiastic supporter as well. He offered his services translating decrees, and even took up arms, joining a patrol against counterrevolutionaries. He fell ill and died in Russia during the fall of 1920. He was given a state funeral and was one of three Americans buried at the Kremlin.\n\nEarly life\n\nJohn Silas Reed was born on October 22, 1887, in his maternal grandparents' mansion in what is now the Goose Hollow neighborhood of Portland, Oregon. His grandmother's household had Chinese servants.[1] Reed wrote of paying a nickel to a \"Goose Hollowite\" (young toughs in a gang in the working-class neighborhood below King's Hill) to keep from being beaten up. In 2001 a memorial bench dedicated to Reed was installed in Washington Park, which overlooks the site of Reed's birthplace (the mansion no longer exists).[2]\n\nHis mother, Margaret (Green) Reed, was the daughter of Portland industrialist Henry Dodge Green,[3] who had made a fortune founding and operating three businesses: the first gas & light company, the first pig iron smelter on the West Coast, and the Portland water works (he was its second owner).[4] SW Green Avenue was named in his honor.[5]\n\nJohn's father, Charles Jerome Reed, was born in the East and came to Portland as the representative of an agricultural machinery manufacturer. With his ready wit, he quickly won acceptance in Portland's business community.[6] The couple had married in 1886, and the family's wealth came from the Green side, not the Reed side.\n\nA sickly child, young Jack grew up surrounded by nurses and servants. His mother carefully selected his upper-class playmates. He had a brother, Harry, who was two years younger. Jack and his brother were sent to the recently established Portland Academy, a private school.[7] Jack was bright enough to pass his courses but could not be bothered to work for top marks, as he found school dry and tedious.[8] In September 1904, he was sent to Morristown, a New Jersey prep school, to prepare for college. His father, who did not attend college, wanted his sons to go to Harvard.[9] At Morristown Jack continued his poor classroom performance, but made the football team and showed some literary promise.[10]\n\nThe Harvard Monthly Vol. 44 (1907) Vol. 44 (1907)\n\nReed failed his first attempt at Harvard College's admission exam but passed on his second try, and enrolled in the fall of 1906.[11] Tall, handsome, and lighthearted, he threw himself into all manner of student activities. He was a member of the cheerleading team, the swimming team, and the dramatic club, served on the editorial boards of the Lampoon and The Harvard Monthly, and was president of the Harvard Glee Club. In 1910 he held a position in the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, and also wrote music and lyrics for their show Diana's Debut. Reed failed to make the football and crew teams, but excelled in swimming and water polo.[12] He was also made \"Ivy orator and poet\" in his senior year.\n\nReed attended meetings of the Socialist Club, over which his friend Walter Lippmann presided, but never joined. The group introduced legislation into the state legislature, attacked the university for failing to pay its servants living wages, and petitioned the administration to establish a course on socialism.[13] Reed later recalled:\n\nAll this made no ostensible difference in the look of Harvard society, and probably the club-men and the athletes, who represented us to the world, never even heard of it. But it made me, and many others, realize that there was something going on in the dull outside world more thrilling than college activities, and turned our attention to the writings of men like H.G. Wells and Graham Wallas, wrenching us away from the Oscar Wildian dilettantism which had possessed undergraduate litterateurs for generations.[14]\n\nReed graduated from Harvard College in 1910. That summer he set out to see more of the \"dull outside world,\" visiting England, France, and Spain before returning home to America the following spring.[15] Reed worked as a common laborer on a cattle boat to pay his fare to Europe. His travels were encouraged by his favorite professor, Charles Townsend Copeland (\"Copey\"), who told him he must \"see life\" if he wanted to write about it successfully.[16]\n\nCareer\n\nJournalist\n\nReed had determined to become a journalist, and set out to make his mark in New York, a center of the industry. Reed made use of a valuable contact from Harvard, Lincoln Steffens, who was establishing a reputation as a muckraker. He appreciated Reed's skills and intellect at an early date. Steffens landed his young admirer an entry-level position on The American Magazine, where he read manuscripts, corrected proofs, and later helped with the composition. Reed supplemented his salary by taking an additional job as the business manager of a new short-lived quarterly magazine called Landscape Architecture.[17]\n\nA native of Oregon , John Reed made New York City the base of his operations.\n\nReed made his home in Greenwich Village, a burgeoning hub of poets, writers, activists, and artists. He came to love New York, relentlessly exploring it and writing poems about it. His formal jobs on the magazines paid the rent, but it was as a freelance journalist that Reed sought to establish himself. He collected rejection slips, circulating an essay and short stories about his six months in Europe, eventually breaking through in The Saturday Evening Post. Within a year, Reed had other work accepted by Collier's, The Forum, and The Century Magazine. One of his poems was set to music by composer Arthur Foote. The editors at The American came to see him as a contributor and began to publish his work.[18]\n\nReed's serious interest in social problems was first aroused about this time by Steffens and Ida Tarbell. He moved beyond them to a more radical political position than theirs. In 1913 he joined the staff of The Masses, edited by Max Eastman. Reed contributed more than 50 articles, reviews, and shorter pieces to this socialist publication.\n\nThe first of Reed's many arrests came in Paterson, New Jersey, in 1913, for attempting to speak on behalf of strikers in the New Jersey silk mills. The harsh treatment meted out by the authorities to the strikers and the short jail term he served further radicalized Reed. He allied with the general socialist union, the Industrial Workers of the World. His account of his experiences was published in June as an article, \"War in Paterson.\" During the same year, following a suggestion made by IWW leader Bill Haywood, Reed put on \"The Pageant of the Paterson Strike\" in Madison Square Garden as a benefit for the strikers.[19]\n\nIn the autumn of 1913, Reed was sent to Mexico by the Metropolitan Magazine to report the Mexican Revolution.[20] He shared the perils of Pancho Villa's army for four months and was with Villa's Constitutional (Constitutionalist) Army (whose \"Primer Jefe\" political chief was Venustiano Carranza) when it defeated Federal forces at Torre\u00f3n, opening the way for its advance on Mexico City.[21] Reed adored Villa, but Carranza left him cold.\n\nReed's reporting on the Villistas in a series of outstanding magazine articles gained him a national reputation as a war correspondent. Reed deeply sympathized with the peons and vehemently opposed American intervention. Reed's reports were collected and published as the book Insurgent Mexico (1914).\n\nOn April 30, 1914, Reed arrived in Colorado, scene of the recent Ludlow massacre, which was part of the Colorado Coalfield War between the John D. Rockefeller, Jr.-owned Colorado Fuel & Iron Company and United Mine Workers union supporters. There he spent a little more than a week, during which he investigated the events, spoke on behalf of the miners, and wrote an impassioned article on the subject (\"The Colorado War\", published in July). He came to believe much more deeply in class conflict.[22]\n\nReed spent summer 1914 in Provincetown, Massachusetts with Mabel Dodge and her son, putting together Insurgent Mexico and interviewing President Wilson on the subject. The resulting report, much watered down at White House insistence, was not a success.[23]\n\nWar correspondent\n\nOn August 14, 1914, shortly after Germany declared war on France, Reed set sail for neutral Italy, on assignment for the Metropolitan. He met his lover Mabel Dodge in Naples, and the pair made their way to Paris. Reed believed the war was the result of imperialist commercial rivalries and felt little sympathy for any of the parties.\n\nIn an unsigned piece titled \"The Traders' War,\" published in the September 1914 issue of The Masses, Reed wrote:\n\nThe real War, of which this sudden outburst of death and destruction is only an incident, began long ago. It has been raging for tens of years, but its battles have been so little advertised that they have been hardly noted. It is a clash of Traders... What has democracy to do in alliance with Nicholas, the Tsar? Is it Liberalism which is marching from the Petersburg of Father Gapon, from the Odessa of the pogroms?... No. There is a falling out among commercial rivals.... We, who are Socialists, must hope\u2014we may even expect\u2014that out of this horror of bloodshed and dire destruction will come far-reaching social changes\u2014and a long step forward towards our goal of Peace among Men. But we must not be duped by this editorial buncombe about Liberalism going forth to Holy War against Tyranny. This is not Our War.[24]\n\nIn France, Reed was frustrated by wartime censorship and the difficulty of reaching the front. Reed and Dodge went to London, and Dodge soon left for New York, to Reed's relief. The rest of 1914 he spent drinking with French prostitutes and pursuing an affair with a German woman. The pair went to Berlin in early December. While there, Reed interviewed Karl Liebknecht, one of the few socialists in Germany to vote against war credits. Reed was deeply disappointed by the general collapse in working-class solidarity promised by the Second International, and by its replacement with militarism and nationalism.[25]\n\n1917 c. 1917 Reedc. 1917\n\nHe returned to New York in December and wrote more about the war. In 1915 he traveled to Central Europe, accompanied by Boardman Robinson, a Canadian artist and frequent Masses contributor. Traveling from Thessaloniki, they saw scenes of profound devastation in Serbia (including a bombed-out Belgrade), also going through Bulgaria and Romania. They passed through the Jewish Pale of Settlement in Bessarabia. In Che\u0142m they were arrested and incarcerated for several weeks. At risk of being shot for espionage, they were saved by the American ambassador.\n\nTraveling to Russia, Reed was outraged to learn that the American ambassador in Petrograd was inclined to believe they were spies. Reed and Robinson were rearrested when they tried to slip into Romania. This time the British ambassador (Robinson being a British subject) finally secured permission for them to leave, but not until after all their papers were seized in Kiev. In Bucharest, the duo spent time piecing together more of their journey. At one point Reed traveled to Constantinople in hopes of seeing action at Gallipoli. From these experiences he wrote the book, The War in Eastern Europe, published in April 1916.\n\nAfter returning to New York, Reed visited his mother in Portland. There he met and fell in love with Louise Bryant, who joined him on the East coast in January 1916. Though happy, both also had affairs with others, in accordance with their bohemian circle and ideas about sexual liberation. Early in 1916 Reed met the young playwright Eugene O'Neill. Beginning that May, the three rented a cottage in Provincetown, Massachusetts, a summer destination on Cape Cod for many artists and writers from Greenwich Village. Not long after, Bryant and O'Neill began a romance.\n\nThat summer Reed covered the Presidential nominating conventions. He endorsed Woodrow Wilson, believing that he would make good on his promise to keep America out of the war.[26] In November 1916 he married Bryant in Peekskill, New York. The same year, he underwent an operation at Johns Hopkins Hospital to remove a kidney. He was hospitalized until mid-December.[27] The operation rendered him ineligible for conscription and saved him from registering as a conscientious objector, as had been his intention. During 1916 he privately published Tamburlaine and Other Verses, in an edition of 500 copies.\n\nAs the country raced towards war, Reed was marginalized: his relationship with the Metropolitan was over. He pawned his late father's watch and sold his Cape Cod cottage to the birth control activist and sex educator Margaret Sanger.[28]\n\nWhen Wilson asked for a declaration of war on April 2, 1917, Reed shouted at a hastily convened meeting of the People's Council in Washington: \"This is not my war, and I will not support it. This is not my war, and I will have nothing to do with it.\"[29] In July and August Reed continued to write vehement articles against the war for The Masses, which the United States Post Office Department refused to mail, and for Seven Arts. Due to antiwar articles by Reed and Randolph Bourne, the arts magazine lost its financial backing and ceased publication.[30] Reed was stunned by the nation's pro-war fervor, and his career lay in ruins.\n\nWitness to the Russian Revolution\n\nWorker of the American labor movement, internationalist writer, John Reed. Stamp of USSR, 1987.\n\nOn August 17, 1917, Reed and Bryant set sail from New York to Europe, having first provided the State Department with legally sworn assurances that neither would represent the Socialist Party at a forthcoming conference in Stockholm.[31] The pair were going as working journalists to report on the sensational developments taking place in the fledgling republic of Russia. Traveling by way of Finland, the pair arrived in the capital city of Petrograd immediately after the failed military coup of monarchist General Lavr Kornilov. This was an attempt to topple the Provisional Government of Alexander Kerensky by force of arms. Reed and Bryant found the Russian economy in shambles. Several of the subject nations of the old empire, such as Finland and Ukraine, had gained autonomy and were seeking separate military accommodations with Germany.\n\nReed and Bryant were in Petrograd for the October Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks, headed by Vladimir Lenin, toppled the Kerensky government; the Bolsheviks believed this was the first blow of a worldwide socialist revolution.\n\nFood shortages made the situation dire in the capital, and social disorder reigned. Reed later recalled:\n\nThe last month of the Kerensky regime was marked first by the falling off of the bread supply from 2 pounds a day to 1 pound, to half a pound, to a quarter of a pound, and, the final week, no bread at all. Holdups and crime increased to such an extent that you could hardly walk down the streets. The papers were full of it. Not only had the government broken down, but the municipal government had absolutely broken down. The city militia was quite disorganized and up in the air, and the street-cleaning apparatus and all that sort of thing had broken down\u2014milk and everything of that sort.[32]\n\nA mood for radical change was in the air. The Bolsheviks, seeking an all-socialist government and immediate end to Russian participation in the war, sought the transfer of power from Kerensky to a Congress of Soviets, a gathering of elected workers' and soldiers' deputies to be convened in October. The Kerensky government considered this a kind of coup, and moved to shut down the Bolshevik press. It issued warrants of arrest for the Soviet leaders and prepared to transfer the troops of the Petrograd garrison, believed to be unreliable, back to the front. A Military Revolutionary Committee of the Soviets, dominated by the Bolshevik Party, determined to seize power on behalf of the future Congress of Soviets. At 11 pm on the evening of November 7, 1917, it captured the Winter Palace, the seat of Kerensky's government.[33] Reed and Bryant were present during the fall of the Winter Palace, the symbolic event that started the Bolshevik Revolution.[34]\n\nThe cover of this 1919 British pamphlet emphasizes Reed's short-lived status as Soviet consul.\n\nReed was an enthusiastic supporter of the new revolutionary socialist government. He went to work for the new People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, translating decrees and news of the new government into English. \"I also collaborated in the gathering of material and data and distributing of papers to go into the German trenches,\" Reed later recalled.[35]\n\nReed was close to the inner circle of the new government. He met Leon Trotsky and was introduced to Lenin during a break of the Constituent Assembly on January 18, 1918. By December, his funds were nearly exhausted, and he took a job with American Raymond Robins of the International Red Cross. Robins wanted to set up a newspaper promoting American interests; Reed complied. But in the dummy issue he prepared, he included a warning beneath the masthead: \"This paper is devoted to promoting the interests of American capital.\"[36]\n\nThe dissolution of the Constituent Assembly left Reed unmoved. Two days later, armed with a rifle, he joined a patrol of Red Guards prepared to defend the Foreign Office from counter-revolutionary attack. Reed attended the opening of the Third Congress of Soviets, where he gave a short speech promising to bring the news of the revolution to America, saying he hoped it would \"call forth an answer from America's oppressed and exploited masses.\" American journalist Edgar Sisson told Reed that he was being used by the Bolsheviks for their propaganda, a rebuke he accepted.[37]\n\nIn January, Trotsky, responding to Reed's concern about the safety of his substantial archive, offered Reed the post of Soviet Consul in New York. As the United States did not recognize the Bolshevik government, Reed's credentials would almost certainly have been rejected and he would have faced prison (which would have given the Bolsheviks some propaganda material). Most Americans in Petrograd considered Reed's appointment a massive blunder. Businessman Alexander Gumberg met with Lenin, showing him a prospectus in which Reed called for massive American capital support for Russia and for setting up a newspaper to express the American viewpoint on the negotiations at Brest-Litovsk. Lenin found the proposal unsavory and withdrew Reed's nomination. Learning of Gumberg's intervention, Reed always denigrated him afterward.[38]\n\nReed and Bryant wrote and published books about their Russian experiences. Bryant's Six Red Months in Russia appeared first, but Reed's 10 Days That Shook the World (1919) garnered more notice.\n\nBryant returned to the United States in January 1918, but Reed did not reach New York City until April 28.[39] On his way back, Reed traveled from Russia to Finland; he did not have a visa or passport while crossing to Finland. In Turku harbor, when Reed was boarding a ship on his way to Stockholm, Finnish police arrested him; he was held at Kakola prison in Turku until he was released. From Finland, Reed traveled to Kristiania, Norway via Stockholm.\n\nBecause he remained under indictment in the Masses case, federal authorities immediately met Reed when his ship reached New York, holding him on board for more than eight hours while they searched his belongings. Reed's papers, the material from which he intended to write his book, were seized. He was released upon his own recognizance after his attorney, Morris Hillquit, promised to make him available at the Federal Building the next day.[40] His papers were not returned to him until November.\n\nRadical political activist\n\nVoice of Labor, October 1919 Cover of Reed'sOctober 1919\n\nBack in America, Reed and Bryant defended the Bolsheviks and opposed the American intervention. Incensed at Russia's departure from the war against Germany, the public gave Reed a generally cold reception. While he was in Russia, his articles in The Masses, particularly one headlined \"Knit a straight-jacket for your soldier boy,\" had been instrumental in the government gaining an indictment for sedition against the magazine (antiwar agitation was considered sedition and treason).\n\nThe first Masses trial ended in a hung jury the day before Reed reached New York. The defendants, including him, were to be retried. He immediately posted $2,000 bail on April 29.[41] The second Masses trial also ended in a hung jury.\n\nIn Philadelphia, Reed stood outside a closed hall on May 31, and harangued a crowd of 1,000 about the case and the war until police dragged him away. He was arrested for inciting a riot, and posted $5,000 bail. Reed became more aggressively political, intolerant, and self-destructive. On September 14, he was arrested for the third time since returning from Russia, charged with violating the Sedition Act and freed on $5,000 bail. This was a day after possibly the largest demonstration for Bolshevik Russia was held in the United States (in The Bronx). Reed had passionately defended the revolution, which he seemed to think was coming to America as well. He tried to prevent Allied intervention in Russia, arguing that the Russians were contributing to the war effort by checking German ambitions in the Ukraine and Japanese designs on Siberia, but this argument had no traction with the people.[42]\n\nOn February 21\u201322, 1919, Bryant was fiercely grilled before a Senate committee exploring Bolshevik propaganda activities in the U.S., but emerged resilient. Reed followed her. According to Homberger, his testimony was \"savagely distorted\" by the press. Later that day Reed went to Philadelphia to stand trial for his May speech; despite a hostile judge, press, and patriotic speech by the prosecutor, Reed's lawyer convinced the jury the case was about free speech, and he was acquitted.[43] Returning to New York, Reed continued speaking widely and participating in the various twists of socialist politics that year. He served as editor of The New York Communist, the weekly newspaper issued by the Left Wing Section of Greater New York.\n\nAffiliated with the Left Wing of the Socialist Party, Reed with the other radicals was expelled from the National Socialist Convention in Chicago on August 30, 1919. The radicals split into two bitterly hostile groups, forming the Communist Labor Party of America (Reed's group, which he helped create) and, the next day, the Communist Party of America. Reed was the international delegate of the former, wrote its manifesto and platform, edited its paper, The Voice of Labor, and was denounced as \"Jack the Liar\" in the Communist Party organ, The Communist. Reed's writings of 1919 displayed doubts about Western-style democracy and defended the dictatorship of the proletariat. He believed this was a necessary step that would prefigure the true democracy \"based upon equality and the liberty of the individual.\"[44]\n\nComintern functionary\n\nIndicted for sedition and hoping to secure Comintern backing for the CLP, Reed fled America with a forged passport in early October 1919 on a Scandinavian frigate; he worked his way to Bergen, Norway as a stoker. Given shore leave, he disappeared to Kristiania, crossed into Sweden on October 22, passed through Finland and made his way to Moscow by train. In the cold winter of 1919\u201320, he traveled in the region around Moscow, observing factories, communes, and villages. He filled notebooks with his writing and had an affair with a Russian woman.[45]\n\nReed's feelings about the revolution became ambivalent. Activist Emma Goldman had recently arrived aboard the Buford, among hundreds of aliens deported by the United States under the Sedition Act. She was especially concerned about the Cheka. Reed told her that the enemies of the revolution deserved their fate, but suggested that she see Angelica Balabanoff, a critic of the current situation. He wanted Goldman to hear the other side.[46]\n\n10 Days That Shook The World, published by the Comintern in Hamburg in 1922 German edition of, published by the Comintern in Hamburg in 1922\n\nThough facing the threat of arrest in Illinois, Reed tried to return to the United States in February 1920. At that time, the Soviets organized a convention to establish a United Communist Party of America. Reed attempted to leave Russia through Latvia, but his train never arrived, forcing him to hitch a ride in the boxcar of an eastbound military train to Petrograd.[47] In March, he crossed into Helsinki, where he had radical friends, including Hella Wuolijoki, the future politician and member of parliament. With their help, he was hidden in the hold of a freighter.\n\nOn March 13, Finnish customs officials found Reed in a coal bunker on the ship. He was taken to the police station, where he maintained that he was seaman \"Jim Gormley\". Eventually, the jewels, photographs, letters, and fake documents he had in his possession forced him to reveal his true identity. Although beaten several times and threatened with torture, he refused to surrender the names of his local contacts. Because of his silence, he could not be tried for treason. He was charged and convicted of smuggling and having jewels in his possession (102 small diamonds worth $14,000, which were confiscated).\n\nThe US Secretary of State was satisfied with Reed's arrest and pressured the Finnish authorities for his papers. American authorities, however, remained indifferent to Reed's fate. Although Reed paid the fine for smuggling, he was still detained. His physical condition and state of mind deteriorated rapidly. He suffered from depression and insomnia, wrote alarming letters to Bryant, and on May 18 threatened a hunger strike. He was finally released in early June, and sailed for Tallinn, Estonia, on the 5th. Two days later, he traveled to Petrograd, recuperating from malnutrition and scurvy caused by having been fed dried fish almost exclusively. Still, his spirits were high.[48]\n\nAt the end of June, Reed traveled to Moscow. After he discussed with Bryant the possibility of her joining him, she gained passage on a Swedish tramp steamer and arrived in Gothenburg on August 10. At the same time, Reed attended the second Comintern congress. Although his mood was as jovial and boisterous as ever, his physical appearance had deteriorated.[49]\n\nDuring this congress, Reed bitterly objected to the deference other revolutionaries showed to the Russians. The latter believed the tide of revolutionary fervor was ebbing, and that the Communist party needed to work within the existing institutions\u2014a policy Reed felt would be disastrous. He was contemptuous of the bullying tactics displayed during the congress by Karl Radek and Grigory Zinoviev, who ordered Reed to attend the Congress of the Peoples of the East to be held at Baku on August 15.\n\nThe journey to Baku was a long one, five days by train through a countryside that was devastated by civil war and typhus. Reed was reluctant to go. He asked for permission to travel later, as he wanted to meet Bryant in Petrograd after she arrived from Murmansk. Zinoviev insisted that Reed take the official train: \"the Comintern has made a decision. Obey.\"[50] Reed, needing Soviet goodwill and unprepared for a final break with the Comintern, made the trip with reluctance. Years after having abandoned Communism himself, his friend Benjamin Gitlow asserted that Reed became bitterly disillusioned with the Communist movement because of his treatment by Zinoviev.\n\nDuring his time in Baku, Reed received a telegram announcing Bryant's arrival in Moscow. He followed her there, arriving on September 15, and was able to tell her of the events of the preceding eight months. He appeared older and his clothes were in tatters. While in Moscow, he took Bryant to meet Lenin, Trotsky, Lev Kamenev, and other leading Bolsheviks, and also to visit Moscow's ballet and art galleries.\n\nDeath\n\nReed's body lying in state in Moscow\n\nReed was determined to return to the United States but fell ill on September 25. At first thought to have influenza, he was hospitalized five days later and diagnosed with spotted typhus. Bryant spent all her time with him, but there were no medicines to be obtained because of the Allied blockade. Reed's mind started to wander; eventually he lost the use of the right side of his body and could no longer speak. His wife was holding his hand when he died in Moscow on October 17, 1920.[51] After a hero's funeral, Reed's body was buried at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. He remains one of only three Americans who were honored by being buried there, the other two being C. E. Ruthenberg, the founder of [[Communist Party USA, and Bill Haywood, a founding member and leader of the Industrial Workers of the World.\n\nLegacy\n\nReed's interpretation in popular culture has varied. Some, such as biographer Robert A. Rosenstone, have called him a romantic, while Upton Sinclair derided him as a \"playboy of the revolution.\"[52] For the Communist movement to which he belonged, Reed became a symbol of the international nature of the Bolshevik revolution, a martyr buried at the Kremlin wall amid solemn fanfare, his name to be uttered reverently as a member of the radical pantheon. By the 1930s, the height of the communist movement in the United States, literary John Reed Clubs, affiliated with the Communist Party, existed in his honor in many large cities of the United States. Others, such as his old friend and comrade Benjamin Gitlow, claimed that Reed had begun to shun the bureaucracy and violence of Soviet Communism toward the end of his life. They sought to posthumously enlist Reed in their own anti-communist cause.\n\nRepresentation in other media\n\nSoviet director Sergei Eisenstein's influential 1927 silent film October: Ten Days That Shook the World was based on Reed's book.\n\nwas based on Reed's book. John Dos Passos included a highly stylized, brief biography of Reed in his 1932 novel/history work 1919, the second part of his U.S.A. trilogy.\n\nthe second part of his U.S.A. trilogy. The 1958 Soviet film In October Days (Russian: \u0412 \u0434\u043d\u0438 \u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f ), directed by Sergei Vasilyev, featured Reed and Bryant.\n\n(Russian: ), directed by Sergei Vasilyev, featured Reed and Bryant. Actor and director Warren Beatty made the film Reds (1981), based on Reed's life. Beatty starred as Reed, Diane Keaton as Louise Bryant. and Jack Nicholson as Eugene O'Neill. The movie won three Academy Awards and was nominated for nine others.\n\nTwo films are based on Reed's accounts of the Mexican Revolution, one with two parts released a year apart. Mexican director Paul Leduc made Reed: Insurgent Mexico (1973).[53] A Mexican\u2013Soviet-Italian co-production released Red Bells (1982) and Red Bells II (1983), both directed by Sergei Bondarchuk, with Franco Nero as Reed.[54]\n\nPublications\n\nDiana's Debut.

He was a sickly child with a weak kidney. For much of his teenage years, he suffered recurrent attacks of pain that kept him bedridden for periods of a week or more. He attended Portland Academy, a private school with younger brother Harry. He was bright enough to pass his courses but would not work for top marks, as he found school dry and tedious. He entered Harvard College in 1906, and excelled in swimming and water polo, served the editorial boards of Lampoon and The Harvard Monthly, and wrote music and lyrics for the Hasty Pudding Theatricals show. He graduated from Harvard College in 1910, and that summer he set out to see more of the \"dull outside world,\" visiting England, France, and Spain before returning home to America the following spring.\n\nCareer\n\nWanting to be a freelance journalist, he circulated essay and short stories about his six months in Europe which were accepted in The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's, The Forum, and The Century Magazine. One of his poems was set to music by composer Arthur Foote, and the editors at \u2018The American\u2019 came to see him as a contributor and begun to publish his work. In 1913, he joined \u2018The Masses\u2019, a magazine of socialist politics. He was arrested for the first time in Paterson, New Jersey for speaking on behalf of strikers in the silk mills.

When The Ludlow Massacre happened in April 1914, he arrived at the scene in Colorado and reported on the event, siding with the miners and seeing it as an example of class conflict. On the outbreak of the First World War, Reed went to Europe where he covered the battle fronts in France, Germany, Russia, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria for The Masses and the Metropolitan Magazine. He saw World War I as a \u201cClash of Traders\u201d and showed little sympathy for any of the participants and observed with dismay that working-class solidarity was being replaced by militarism and nationalism. In 1915, he returned to Portland where he met Louise Bryant. They rented a home in Provincetown, in Massachusetts and acted in, Bound East for Cardiff, a play written by Eugene O'Neill. In 1917, accompanied by his wife Louise Bryant who was also provided foreign correspondent accreditation, he left for Petrograd. He interviewed Alexander Kerensky, head of Russian Provisional Government just before Kerensky went into hiding. In November 1917, he spent time with Lenin and saw in him, \u201cthe power of explaining profound ideas in simple terms, of analyzing a concrete situation. And combined with shrewdness, the greatest intellectual audacity.\" He returned to New York City in April, 1918 and was immediately arrested and charged for violating the Espionage Act by publishing anti-war articles and cartoons in The Masses that undermined the war effort. He was released on bail and he published a series of articles on the Russian Revolution in The Liberator. He was arrested many times on charges of violating the Sedition Act. In September 1919, Reed and several others, decided to form the Communist Party of the United States. Within a few weeks it had 60,000 members whereas the Socialist Party of America had only 40,000. In 1920, he attended the Second Congress of the Communist International in Moscow and sought official recognition of the American Communist Party.

Arrested and thrown into the Oxford County prison at Paris, Higgins insisted that the charges had been trumped up by a conspiracy of his enemies in an effort to conceal the true crime -- the seduction of Higgins' daughter, Ruby Jane, by his enemy, the \"saducer... cursed libertine... [and] fel monster of hell,\" Capt. Taber (1849 September 6).\n\nA cordwainer from Mexico, Me., Higgins' reputation in the community was already sullied prior to the rape. A self-confessed drunkard, Higgins had previously been involved as a plaintiff in civil suits stemming from his carousals, and he was alleged to have committed a rape at one time. Even his friend, Reed, admitted that \"when intoxicated [Higgins] is very quarrelsome, [and] consequently... has got many enemies\" (1852 April 12). But Higgins' stormy family life, and the wayward, even wanton behavior of his children may have damaged his reputation just as much in the eyes of the community. According to Edmond, Ruby Jane and her brother, Edwin, had once claimed that they would see their father jailed, even if they had to perjure themselves to do it, and Edmond also asserted that Taber had tried to lure the children into hiring someone to murder their mother. Both children, if Edmond is to be believed, had very bad reputations and criminal tendencies.\n\nEven so, and despite the rape charges, Higgins initially expressed a seeming concern for Ruby Jane's well-being, and wrote that he felt that she had been mislead by Taber's evil influence. Through his counsel, John Reed, a former Democratic state representative and postmaster of Roxbury, Me., Higgins attempted to keep his daughter apart from her \"saducer,\" informing her that he did so not \"out of any ill will to you By no means But... for your own good for he was Effecting your present Everlasting and perhaps Eternal Ruin\" (1849 October 12). His efforts failed. Edmond was informed that Ruby had moved in with the \"libertine,\" although this was denied in court, and she may have gotten pregnant by him. When informed of this latter news, Edmond sarcastically told Reed that if Ruby Jane wished to arrange an abortion, she should talk to the Waltons, a prominent local family allied with Taber, \"for you know it is an old proverb that practise makes Perfect in any avocation\" (1850 May 7).\n\nHiggins consistently maintained that Ruby Jane's allegations were fraught with inconsistencies, were flatly contradicted by the testimony of more reliable witnesses (including his wife, Melintha), and did not even make \"common sense.\" After his conviction and sentencing to the Maine State Penitentiary at Thomaston, he continued to claim that the rape charge was \"more than a thousand times worse to me than all the rest taken together that I Ever had to deal with...\" (1850 January 1), and he continued to implicate some of the most respected members of the local community, as liars and conspirators, including Justice of the Peace, Charles W. Walton. His term in the Penitentiary was harsh, and when he was not too ill, he was put to work in the shoe factory, a place notorious as \"the Chief scourge of the prison, and absolutely the worst place in the United States, a perfect Disgrace to the State & to Humanity\" (1858 June 6). At one point, Higgins was denied even the meager wages he drew for his labor in the factory, while for eighteen months in 1861 and 1862, he was too ill to work.\n\nHis personality and record aside, Higgins was never without supporters. His wife stood by him steadfastly, as did his counsel, John Reed, and friend, E. L. Osgood. While first attempting to secure a pardon, Higgins so impressed Judge John Ruggles that he wrote, \"I cannot but marvel that he [Edmond] should have been convicted of such a crime on such evidence attended with such circumstances\" (1851 October 15). A year later, Melintha arranged for a respected attorney from Augusta, Lot M. Morrill, to assist in Edmond's efforts to obtain a pardon, and Morrill, like Reed and Ruggles, also appears to have been convinced of Higgins innocence. Higgins was even able to convince the warden and every minister in town to sign a petition backing his pardon. Nevertheless, \"public feeling\" ran strongly against him, egged on, perhaps, by Walton and his associates. Sensing the inevitable, he bitterly insisted that while rich men in Maine always get away with their crimes, are seldom imprisoned, and never sentenced to death, the poor suffer even when innocent.\n\nBetween 1862 and 1864 another campaign was mounted to obtain a pardon for Higgins, prompted by Reed's discovery of a letter from Ruby Jane to Taber demanding money, and threatening to inform on him if he would not pay. Reed deposed that he believed that Higgins had never raped his daughter, but had merely been trying to protect her from Taber's seductions, and Reed seems to have assumed that the letter would impugn the testimony of both Ruby Jane and Taber. Taber and the Waltons, however, continued to insist that Higgins was a bad man, rightly convicted, and demanded that his pardon be denied. Higgins was still in prison in August 1864, awaiting the final decision of the state council on pardons.\n\nFrom the guide to the Edmond Higgins papers, Higgins, Edmond, 1849-1864, (William L.
