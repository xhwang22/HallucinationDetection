Manilal was a prolific researcher and published over 200 research papers in various journals.": [{"url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10734-020-00609-z", "page_content": "Data\n\nThe data are collected in surveysFootnote 1 of tenured and tenure-track faculty in departmental fields of computer science, engineering, and six fields of sciences (biology/life sciences, chemistry/microchemistry, earth/atmospheric, mathematics, physics, psychologyFootnote 2). These fields encompass the range of classifications of the US National Science Foundation. The faculty members surveyed are in eight research universities identified by a strong baseline university as institutional peers in prestigious, national standing in scientific and technological fields.Footnote 3 These universities are within the Research I and Doctoral-Research Extensive categories of the Carnegie Classifications at the time of the survey. They are cross-regional within the USA (one southeast, two northeast, one northcentral, two midwest, one southeast, and two pacific west) and encompass public (four) and private (four) institutions. Research universities constitute an important grouping because they train doctoral students, confer numbers of degrees, receive federal grants, and contribute to research. They also set standards for rewards in other types of institutions (Fairweather 2005).\n\nThe survey is distinguished by inclusion of the population of women, except for sampling in life sciences and psychology (n = 434), enabling analysis by gender, and a stratified, random (probability) sample of men by field (n = 527). We accomplished this sample by (1) canvassing completely the websites of departmental fields within these eight institutions; (2) identifying the total population of tenured and tenure-track faculty; and (3) taking stratified random samples by field from known and specified populations (see Appendix\u2014supplementary materials).\n\nThe resulting number of respondents to the survey is 327 men and 280 women. The overall response rate is 65% for both women and men respondents (a response rate that removes 24 ineligible cases from the base because of moves, retirements, and/or being deceased). This response reflects the use of customized letters and follow-ups to non-respondents, based on Dillman et al. (2014) protocols. The response here exceeds the rates of 50% (or less) most commonly reported in surveys of academics and scientists.\n\nOur survey data are revealing but do not permit links to bibliometric (Web of Science, Scopus) data, the weighting of articles by numbers of authors, and inclusion of citations. This is because the identity (names) of survey respondents is protected by the given approval of the institutional review board, and thus, the means are unavailable for \u201ctracing\u201d respondents to other sources. Despite this, our method enabled collection of a range of important indicators that are absent from most bibliometric studies.\n\nMeasures of variables\n\nDependent variable\n\nThe dependent variable is prolific (or not) based on self-reported number of articles published or accepted for publication in refereed journals in the prior 3 years and, for computer scientists, the number of refereed proceedings as well. Information on numbers of coauthors is not available.Footnote 4 The inclusion of refereed proceedings for computer scientists is in keeping with the Computing Research Association\u2019s (1999) \u201cbest practices\u201d that, in computing, proceedings are rigorously reviewed and a standard means of publication, along with refereed articles.\n\nThe measures of publications take into account: (1) types of publications, (2) time lags, (3) period of time, and (4) self-reporting of data. First, the survey asks respondents to list separately the number of articles published and those fully accepted in refereed journals and in conference proceedings\u2014as well as counts of other types of publications. Collecting counts in other categories helps to reduce or eliminate respondents\u2019 mis-categorizing them as \u201crefereed articles\u201d (or proceedings) and thus improves the validity of counts in the \u201ccore\u201d publications. Second, the inclusion of the number of articles (and proceedings) published and separately, the number fully accepted for publication, addresses the time lags that occur between submission, acceptance, and publication. Third, specifying a prior 3-year period controls for the effects of seniority (available span of time) for publishing; and publications in a recent period may be analyzed in relationship to current departmental features reported (while a long span could not). Further, the measure goes beyond articles simply published in a 3-year period and includes those fully accepted, as indicated, and thus helps address lags in times to publication. Fourth, self-reported counts correlate highly with those listed in independent sources (Ehrenberg et al. 2009).\n\nDefinitions of the prolific commonly reflect a \u201cpower law of distribution\u201d (Newman 2005), namely, that the bulk of counts occurs for a small number of cases; that a long-right tail of the distribution exists; and, classically, that about 80% of counts owe to 20% of the cases. Thus, to begin, we examined the distributions of counts of publication productivity for all respondents (n = 607) and for those with cases complete (n = 493) for our variables. These two distributions were comparable in the concentrations of publications in a small group; and in the percentages of respondents by gender, rank, and departmental field (Table 1). Further, results of Little\u2019s MCAR test were not significant (p = .155), indicating that data were missing completely at random.\n\nTable 1 Characteristics of all respondents and those with cases complete Full size table\n\nThe distribution of publications for cases complete (Fig. 1) has a range of 0 to 80, skewness of 2.2, a mean of 11.6, and a median of 9. Notably, this distribution shows a flattening of counts at 20 or more articles in the 3-year period, representing 15.6% of these academic scientists. This cut-off point provides a fit to the resulting models here. Using points for prolific of (1) the upper 21% and (2) the upper 15% for each of the three major fields did not change results. Further, no significant differences appear in values of the independent variables for the upper 5% compared with the upper 15%; and an upper 5% is restricted because it contains only 25 respondents. The proportion of respondents (15.6%) who constitute the threshold for prolific here is within the range of proportions (10%\u201325%) identified as prolific in other groups over time (see Garg and Padhi 2000; Kwiek 2016).\n\nFig. 1 Frequency of publication counts for scientists in prior 3-year period Full size image\n\nA potential question is whether the men and women differ in the distribution of actual counts within the categories of prolific and non-prolific. A box-plot (Fig. 2) shows similar mean and median counts for prolific and non-prolific women and men. This indicates that the cut-off points for prolific/non-prolific are not camouflaging actual counts among the women compared with men.\n\nFig. 2 Box-plots of publication counts for prolific and non-prolific scientists, by gender. Box-plots graphically depict five publication statistics: the first quartile, the median, and the third quartile (see the boxes), the smallest and the largest extremes (the whiskers), and the outliers (circles) Full size image\n\nIndependent variables\n\nThe independent variables encompass (1) characteristics of individuals (gender, rank, and reported work practices) and (2) features of their departments (human and material resources, departmental climates).\n\nGender is coded as male (female as comparison). Ranks are full professor and associate professor (assistant professor as comparison). Work practices are span of collaboration and frequency of speaking about research. Collaborative span is based on reported collaboration in research proposals or publications (yes/no) in the past 3 years with faculty (a) within the home unit; (b) within the home university, but outside of home unit; and (c) in other institutions. Collaboration at each of these levels (a\u2013c) constitutes a value of 1, so that the resulting measure can extend from 0 to 3. The question about frequency of speaking with faculty in home unit about research refers to speaking about \u201cresearch projects and research interests.\u201d This is coded as a dummy variable of speaking daily or weekly (compared with less than weekly).\n\nFor human resources, we considered reported quality (poor to excellent) of (a) faculty, (b) graduate students, and (c) undergraduate majors in the home unit. The quality of faculty and undergraduates had virtually no association with being prolific, while the quality of graduate students did (dummy, \u03c4b = .139, p < .001; scaled, \u03c4b = .149, p < .001). In keeping with the importance of graduate students for research in academic science, this measure was the stronger of the three variables (especially in its scaled form); and including this meets the need to limit the number of variables (in relationship to cases).\n\nQuality of material resources takes the form of two binary variables of \u201cexcellent\u201d (compared with \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cfair,\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d) in reported quality of (a) space and (b) equipment. Conceptually, the variables go beyond sufficiency to measure excellence in space and equipment (related potentially to being prolific). Empirically, the recoding permits inclusion of both variables without the level of collinearity (r = .54, p < .001) that exists for the variables in scaled form.\n\nWe measure work climate with questionnaire items asking respondents to rank their home unit along eight, scaled (5-point scale), bipolar dimensions of (1) formal-informal, (2) boring-exciting, (3) unhelpful-helpful, (4) uncreative-creative, (5) unfair-fair, (6) competitive-noncompetitive, (7) stressful-unstressful, and (8) noninclusive-inclusive.\n\nWe used exploratory factor analysis to detect an underlying structure among these (1\u20138). The interest was in communality (common variance) among the items. Thus, we used principal axis, rather than maximum likelihood, factoring. The results of oblique (oblimin) rotation were similar to orthogonal, and we chose the orthogonal (varimax) to more clearly separate the factors. One item (formal-informal) did not load on any factors (loadings below 0.5) and was removed.\n\nThe factor analysis identified three constructs of departmental climates: (1) \u201cstimulating\u201d (creative, exciting); (2) \u201ccollegial\u201d (fair, helpful, inclusive); and (3) \u201ccompetitive\u201d (stressful, competitive). The correlations among the seven items and factor loadings appear in Table 2. After identifying the factor structure, we created scores (unweighted scales) by adding the items with factor loadings of 0.55 or greater. Reliability tests (Chronbach\u2019s alpha) produced values of 0.84 for stimulating, 0.74 for collegial, and 0.68 for competitive climates. The alpha value for competitive climate was lower than the others; and at the same time, the values for each climate are sufficient for inclusion.\n\nTable 2 Dimensions of departmental climate: correlation matrix and factor loadings based on principal axis factoring and varimax rotation (N = 493) Full size table\n\nSensitivity tests\n\nWe considered other variables that do not appear in the final models. These variables did not differentiate faculty in research universities; did not relate closely to the perspective; introduced multicollinearity; and/or extended the number of variables beyond those appropriate for the number of cases.Footnote 5 Specifically, \u201cgreat interest\u201d in research and in teaching did not differentiate prolific and non-prolific faculty, in part, because of limited variation in these. This is also the case for being a principal investigator on a grant within the past 3 years and for the time between bachelor\u2019s and doctoral degrees. Age and age-squared were co-linear with academic rank, and in the presence of rank, did not predict.\n\nWe explored the impact of fields (Table 3). The box-plots of publication counts in the three broad fields reveal greater similarity among engineering and sciences compared with computer science (Fig. 3). Engineering and sciences have faculty with zero publications and distant outliers. All faculty in computing published at least once in the last 3 years.\n\nTable 3 Fields of prolific and non-prolific Scientists Full size table\n\nFig. 3 Box-plots of publication counts, by field. Box-plots graphically depict five publication statistics: the first quartile, the median, and the third quartile (see the boxes), the smallest and the largest extremes (the whiskers), and the outliers (circles) Full size image\n\nWe could not use each field of science because some were smallFootnote 6; had few faculty members; and were sensitive to zero cell count problem, that is, to the invariance of the dependent and independent variables (Menard 2010). However, we analyzed fields or clusters of fields as predictors of the actual publication counts (a continuous variable rather than being prolific or not) in a negative binomial (and in a Poisson) regression for overdispersed distributions. The results (not displayed) were consistent with those of logistic regression and average field output. They show that, compared with being in engineering, locations in computer science, chemistry, or physics were associated with statistically significant increases in publication counts; being in mathematics decreased the count. Field was a good predictor of counts of publications, but not a good predictor of being highly prolific.\n\nFinally, we assessed the potential interaction of gender and rank with being prolific. First, we addressed the interaction in a logistic regression. The product term was not statistically significant and could not be interpreted. A second diagnostic, Jaccard\u2019s (2001) method of testing two-way interactions with a moderator (gender), showed the odds of being prolific as a function of gender and rank. The odds ratios for each rank were equal, confirming the absence of interaction of rank and gender. However, further tests showed that rank mediated the relationship between gender and being prolific; and the \u201cFindings\u201d and \u201cDiscussion and conclusions\u201d sections address this.\n\nMeans of analysis\n\nWe use three multi-stage logistic regression models to assess characteristics associated with being prolific. These models express the relationship between being prolific (compared with not) and (1) the individual characteristics of gender and academic rank; (2) the preceding (model 1) with addition of work practices; and (3) the preceding (model 2) with addition of reported departmental features. In the analysis of extremes (as is the case of prolific), logistic regression is advantageous over a linear probability because it can handle extremes, and a linear probability model is likely to yield out-of-bound predicted probabilities (Menard 2010).\n\nThe logistic regressions present the predictive value (log odds) that an independent variable has for being prolific. The coefficients may be interpreted as a change in the log odds of a response per unit of change in the independent variable. The multi-stage models allow us to assess the independent variables in the absence and presence of other variables. Alterations in values and significance can point to covariation between the variables in the earlier model with those in the subsequent model(s).\n\nCross-sectional data and logistic regression allow us to explore patterns of relationships but do not establish causal order, as addressed in the \u201cDiscussion and conclusions\u201d section. With these caveats, we use the term \u201cpredictor\u201d for independent variables because this term is commonly used and understood in logistic regression."}, {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06185-8", "page_content": "Authorship is the coin of scholarship \u2014 and some researchers are minting a lot. We searched Scopus for authors who had published more than 72 papers (the equivalent of one paper every 5 days) in any one calendar year between 2000 and 2016, a figure that many would consider implausibly prolific1. We found more than 9,000 individuals, and made every effort to count only \u2018full papers\u2019 \u2014 articles, conference papers, substantive comments and reviews \u2014 not editorials, letters to the editor and the like. We hoped that this could be a useful exercise in understanding what scientific authorship means.\n\nWe must be clear: we have no evidence that these authors are doing anything inappropriate. Some scientists who are members of large consortia could meet the criteria for authorship on a very high volume of papers. Our findings suggest that some fields or research teams have operationalized their own definitions of what authorship means.\n\nThe vast majority of hyperprolific authors (7,888 author records, 86%) published in physics. In high-energy and particle physics, projects are done by large international teams that can have upwards of 1,000 members. All participants are listed as authors as a mark of membership of the team, not for writing or revising the papers. We therefore excluded authors in physics.\n\nWho gets credit? Survey digs into the thorny question of authorship\n\nOf what remained, 909 author records were Chinese or Korean names. Because Scopus disambiguates Chinese and Korean names imperfectly, these may have wrongly combined distinct individuals. For 2016 (when disambiguation had improved for Chinese and Korean names), at least 12, and possibly more than 20, authors based in China were hyperprolific, the largest number from any country that year. We believe that this could be connected to Chinese policies that reward publication with cash or to possible corruption2,3.\n\nBecause of the disambiguation issues, we excluded these names from further analysis, as well as group names and cases in which we found errors (such as journalistic news items misclassified as full articles), duplicate entries, or conference papers misassigned to an organizer.\n\nThis left 265 authors (see Supplementary Information). The number of hyperprolific authors (after our exclusions) grew about 20-fold between 2001 and 2014, and then levelled off (see \u2018Hyperprolific authors proliferate\u2019). Over the same period, the total number of authors increased by 2.5-fold.\n\nWe e-mailed all 265 authors asking for their insights about how they reached this extremely productive class. The 81 replies are provided in the Supplementary Information. Common themes were: hard work; love of research; mentorship of very many young researchers; leadership of a research team, or even of many teams; extensive collaboration; working on multiple research areas or in core services; availability of suitable extensive resources and data; culmination of a large project; personal values such as generosity and sharing; experiences growing up; and sleeping only a few hours per day.\n\nSource: J. P. A. Ioannidis, R. Klavans & K. W. Boyack\n\nAbout half of the hyperprolific authors were in medical and life sciences (medicine n = 101, health sciences n = 11, brain n = 17, biology n = 6, infectious diseases n = 3). When we excluded conference papers, almost two-thirds belonged to medical and life sciences (86/131). Among the 265, 154 authors produced more than the equivalent of one paper every 5 days for 2 or more calendar years; 69 did so for 4 or more calendar years. Papers with 10\u2013100 authors are common in these CVs, especially in medical and life sciences, but papers with the hundreds of authors seen in particle physics are uncommon.\n\nHealth tips for research groups\n\nMaterials scientist Akihisa Inoue, former president of Tohoku University in Japan and a member of multiple prestigious academies, holds the record. He met our definition of being hyperprolific for 12 calendar years between 2000 and 2016. Since 1976, his name appears on 2,566 full papers indexed in Scopus. He has also retracted seven papers found to be self-duplications of previously published work4. We searched for news articles in Google detailing retractions for the next 20 most hyperprolific authors and found only one other author (Jeroen Bax) to have one retracted paper.\n\nThe 265 hyperprolific authors worked in 37 countries, with the highest number in the United States (n = 50), followed by Germany (n = 28) and Japan (n = 27). The proportion from the United States (19%) is roughly similar to its share of published science. Germany and Japan are over-represented. There were disproportionally more hyperprolific authors in Malaysia (n = 13) and Saudi Arabia (n = 7), countries both known to incentivize publication with cash rewards5.\n\nHyperprolific authors also tended to cluster in particular institutions, often as part of a common study. For example, Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands had nine hyperprolific authors, more than any other institution. Seven of them co-authored mostly papers related to the Rotterdam study, a nearly 30-year-old epidemiological project, or its successor Generation R study, which have followed multiple health parameters in thousands of older adults and yielded thousands of publications. Five hyperprolific investigators from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, also often co-authored papers related to cohort studies. Eleven hyperprolific authors across different institutions were on one large cohort study, the European Prospective Investigation on Cancer and Nutrition; other large epidemiological studies were also represented. Hyperprolific authors were also concentrated in cardiology and crystallography.\n\nThese biological and medical disciplines with many hyperprolific authors exhibit different patterns from those found in particle and high-energy physics. Papers with hundreds to thousands of authors are the norm across a community of many thousands of scientists working in projects based at CERN, Europe\u2019s particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland. In crystallography, papers tend to have few co-authors. In epidemiology and cardiology, long lists of authors appear only in relationship to specific research teams that seem to have a tradition of extensive authorship lists.\n\nKid co-authors in South Korea spur government probe\n\nThis raises the question of what authorship entails. The US National Institutes of Health, for example, has guidelines on the activities that qualify: actively supervising, designing and doing experiments, and data acquisition and analysis outside \u201cvery basic\u201d work plus drafting the manuscript. Collecting funds or distant mentorship do not qualify. Most of the 6,000 authors in a recent survey across many geographical regions and disciplines felt that drafting a paper, interpreting results and analysing data should qualify for authorship, but attitudes varied by region and field6.\n\nAuthorship criteria\n\nPerhaps the most widely established requirements for authorship are the Vancouver criteria established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors in 1988. These specify that authors must do all of four things to qualify: play a part in designing or conducting experiments or processing results; help to write or revise the manuscript; approve the published version; and take responsibility for the article\u2019s contents.\n\nThe International Committee of Medical Journal Editors does not count supervision, mentoring or obtaining funding as sufficient for authorship. We did observe that some authors seemed to become hyperprolific on becoming full professors, department chairs or both. It is common and perhaps expected for scientists who assume leadership roles in large centres to accelerate their productivity. For example, clinical cardiologists publish more papers after they assume director roles (despite heavy clinical and administrative duties). Occasionally, the acceleration is stunning: at the peak of their productivity, some cardiologists publish 10 to 80 times more papers in one year compared with their average annual productivity when they were 35\u201342 years old. There was also often a sharp decrease after passing the chair to a successor. Another study noted similar patterns two decades ago7.\n\nOne unexpected result was that some hyperprolific authors placed many publications in a single journal. Prominent in this regard were Acta Crystallographica Section E: Structure Reports Online (relaunched in 2014 as Section E: Crystallographic Communications, with brief structural data reports now published in IuCrData) and Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Kristallographie New Crystal Structures. Three authors have each published more than 600 articles in the former (Hoong-Kun Fun, Seik Weng Ng and Edward Tiekink); three authors have each published more than 400 papers in the latter (Karl Peters, Eva Maria Peters and Edward Tiekink). Three other authors (Anne Marie Api, Charlene Letizia, Sneha Bhatia) published many papers in single supplement issues of Food and Chemistry Toxicology focused on reviews of fragrance materials.\n\nJournals indexed in Scopus are generally considered to be quality journals. The citation impact of hyperprolific authors was usually high, but there was large variability: with a median of 19,805 citations per author (range: 380 to 200,439). The median number of full papers per hyperprolific author in 2000\u20132016 was 677; across all hyperprolific authors, last author positions accounted for 42.5%, first author positions for 7.1%, and single authorships for 1.4%. Across the years, the median proportion of papers with middle author positions (that is, not a single, first or last author) was 51%, but varied from 2.1% to 98.5% for individual authors.\n\nOur work to identify hyperprolific authors is admittedly crude. It is mainly intended to raise the larger question of what authorship entails. Whether and how authorship is justified unavoidably varies for each author and each paper, and norms differ by field. It is likely that sometimes authorship can be gamed, secured through coercion or provided as a favour. We could not assess these patterns in our data. We did not examine contributorship statements8, which are not archived in Scopus. Nevertheless, even contributorship statements can be gamed and might not be accurate.\n\nFurther work is needed to explore how to best normalize these data and what is the optimal level of normalization: for example, adjusting for wide discipline, relatively narrow field and/or highly specific research team.\n\nWhat authors say\n\nTo better understand authorship norms, we e-mailed a survey to the 81 hyperprolific authors of 2016 (see Supplementary Information). We asked whether they fulfilled all four Vancouver criteria. Of the 27 who completed the survey, most said they did not (see \u2018Survey\u2019). Almost all the responders were from US and European institutions. The only two responders from elsewhere stated that they failed Vancouver criteria in most of their papers. It is likely that the survey underestimates the proportion not meeting Vancouver criteria.\n\nSurvey One-third of the 81 authors identified as hyperprolific in 2016 replied when asked how often they met each of 4 criteria established for authorship of medical studies. Of the 27 responders, 19 admitted they had not met at least 1 criterion more than 25% of the time. Eleven wrote that they had not met two or more criteria upwards of 25% of the time. \u2022 Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis or interpretation of the data for the work (9 of 27 met this criterion in less than 75% of their papers). \u2022 Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content (9 of 27 met this criterion in less than 75% of their papers). \u2022 Final approval of the version to be published (3 out of 27 met this criterion in less than 75% of their papers). \u2022 Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work (14 out of 27 met this criterion in less than 75% of their papers).\n\nNot all authors had approved the final versions of their own papers, but all considered approval of the final version necessary for authorship. Fifty-nine per cent (16 of 27) said that they had contributed more than any other listed author for 25 or more of the papers they authored in 2016.\n\nPeer review: Troubled from the start\n\nResponses to the question \u201cWhat, in your own words, do you think should be required for authorship?\u201d generally reflected a requirement for \u201csignificant contributions\u201d, but also dissatisfaction with how authorship was assessed. One scientist said, \u201cI personally don\u2019t count them as \u2018my papers\u2019 and don\u2019t have them on my CV as such, as there is a distinction between being a \u2018named author\u2019 versus a \u2018consortium member\u2019 authorship.\u201d Another observed that authorship was often awarded for seniority, and another that better distinctions were essential. \u201cI think there should be levels of authorship \u2014 and not those implied by order!\u201d It will be interesting to monitor how innovations in assigning credit, such as data citation or formal author contribution taxonomies, could alter authorship conventions. Authorship norms can vary within each field and even within each team. For example, some teams in epidemiology and cardiology apparently offer authorship more generously; others stick to stricter (and probably more appropriate) authorship criteria. For a similar task and contribution, one cohort study might credit 20 authors, another might give credit only to 3 people or none. For example, genome-wide studies typically include many dozens of authors. As a dramatic counter-example, one recent publication of a genome-wide study had only one author9, and apparently that researcher did the same amount of work for which perhaps dozens would get authorship credit in similar papers spearheaded by different teams. Some evidence suggests that the increase in the average number of authors per paper does not reflect so much the genuine needs of team science as the pressure to \u2018publish or perish\u201910.\n\nWidely used citation and impact metrics should be adjusted accordingly. For instance, if adding more authors diminished the credit each author received, unwarranted multi-authorship might go down. We found that the 30 hyperprolific authors who seemed to benefit the most from co-authorship numbered 6 cardiologists and 24 epidemiologists (including those working on population genetics studies). (For these scientists, the ratio of their Hirsch H index to their co-authorship-adjusted Schreiber H m index was higher; see Supplementary Information.)\n\nOverall, hyperprolific authors might include some of the most energetic and excellent scientists. However, such modes of publishing might also reflect idiosyncratic field norms, to say the least. Loose definitions of authorship, and an unfortunate tendency to reduce assessments to counting papers, muddy how credit is assigned. One still needs to see the total publishing output of each scientist, benchmarked against norms for their field. And of course, there is no substitute for reading the papers and trying to understand what the authors have done."}, {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01230-x", "page_content": "You can also search for this author in PubMed Google Scholar\n\nYou can also search for this author in PubMed Google Scholar\n\nA researcher at the University of California, San Diego, prepares to launch a 3D-printed rocket.Credit: Erik Jepsen/UC San Diego\n\nThe Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in Beijing has topped the Nature Index 2020 Annual Tables list as the most prolific producer of research published in the 82 selected journals tracked by the Index (see Graphic).\n\nCAS\u2019s Share of 1805.22 in 2019 was almost twice that of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which came in second.

The established, prolific and emerging researchers each contribute to the scholarly conversation. It\u2019s up to you to learn who they are and what they achieved in order to further their ideas.\n\nThe Web of Science\u2122 makes it easy to find these leading authors, and confidently assess their output and associated citation impact thanks to the built-in citation network. This blog will help you uncover:\n\nFind specific researchers and their paper\n\nYou will likely have a few researchers in mind when beginning your author search. The Web of Science\u2019s Author Search helps you easily find researchers and their publications in the Web of Science Core Collection\u2122 \u2013 regardless of how common or complex their name, or how their name may be presented in different publications over time.\n\nStart your search by entering the full name of the researcher you\u2019re looking for or enter their ResearcherID or ORCiD. These are persistent author identifiers that help to distinguish researchers from their peers, and to ensure a researcher\u2019s work is correctly attributed to them.\n\nYou will then be taken to the researcher\u2019s Author Record. This is an initial snapshot of the author\u2019s publications, citation impact and citing articles in the Core Collection, which is based on the intersection of a machine learning algorithm and human curation via Publons\u2122 and ORCID.\n\nAuthor Records enable you to discover a researcher\u2019s published work and assess their output and associated impact.

From an obscure accessory phase found in equally obscure silica-undersaturated rocks (<100 research papers in the first 90 years of its recorded existence), perovskite and its related phases have risen to an unprecedented level of scientific popularity (3,476 publications in 2013 alone, according to SciFinder\u00ae). The mineral was discovered by the Prussian mineralogist Gustav Rose (1839) in a piece of chlorite-rich skarn from the Akhmatovskaya Kop\u2019 (Akhmatov\u2019s Pit) in the Urals (Fig. 1), sent to him by his Russian colleague and a notable mineral collector August Alexander K\u00e4mmerer, who had undoubtedly recognized the potential scientific value of the sample, and at whose request the new mineral was named in honor of the decorated Napoleonic Wars veteran Count Lev A. Perovskiy (1792\u20131856). Despite his somewhat tainted reputation as a rapacious collector (Shakinko 1980), the Assistant Minister and then Minister of the Interior Perovskiy was a progressive figure in the Russian Court, noted for his key role in agrarian reforms, and the advancement of archeology, mining and lapidary enterprises (Maykov 1916). In the seven decades following the publication of Rose\u2019s original description (in Latin!), perovskite research focused on the apparent discrepancy between the isometric morphology of crystals from the Urals and Alps and their clearly biaxial optical character and lamellar twinning (for a brief overview, see Bowman 1908). Rooted deep in the intricacies of crystal structure, this discrepancy would ultimately be resolved only with the advent of X-ray diffraction techniques some half a century later (Kay and Bailey 1957). Although synthetic CaTiO 3 and a related Na\u2013Nb oxide were first prepared around the same time as Verneuil\u2019s ruby, Spezia\u2019s quartz and a great many other \u201ctest-tube minerals\u201d (Holmquist 1898), the real impetus to perovskite research came only in the 1920s with the first industrial patent (Patent US1436164)\u2014issued to none other than Victor Moritz Goldschmidt\u2014and with the detailed structural studies of CaTiO 3 and \u201cverwandten Verbindungen\u201d inspired by the same Goldschmidt and conducted in Oslo by his students Thomas F.W. Barth (1925) and Frederik W.H. Zachariasen (1928). Their findings, including the now fundamental tolerance factor, were summarized in the seminal Geochemische Verteilungsgesetze der Elemente series.\n\nFig. 1 The perovskite beginnings: a The Akhmatovskaya Kop\u2019 (type locality) in the South Urals, as it was seen by the Russian explorer and geologist Ivan V. Mushketov (1877). This locality was discovered in 1811 by Efim F. Akhmatov, Director of the Kusinskiy Iron Works near Zlatoust, and throughout the 1800s, used as a source of valuable mineral specimens (i.e., a Kop\u2019). In 1981, it was declared a state-protected geological monument. b A vintage specimen of chlorite\u2013calcite skarn from the Akhmatovskaya Kop\u2019 sporting superb pseudocubic perovskite crystals up to 3 cm in size with a conspicuous twinning striation. This sample, now in the Fersman Mineralogical Museum in Moscow, traces its pedigree from the famous Kochubey collection, which dates back to the historical exploration of the Urals and the time of Rose, K\u00e4mmerer and Perovskiy (photo and information courtesy of Alexander A. Evseev) Full size image\n\nIn the 1940s, the pressing military and industrial need for ferroelectrics with a high dielectric constant led to the discovery of BaTiO 3 ceramics (Vul and Gol\u2019dman 1945; von Hippel et al. 1946), which propelled perovskite materials, whose prior commercial application had been virtually limited to pigments, into the electronic age (Table 1). The structure of BaTiO 3 was first solved by Helen D. Megaw (1945), whose subsequent research laid the foundation for our contemporary understanding of the structural variations and phase transitions in synthetic perovskites and their relation to the diverse and often unique properties exhibited by these materials. This early work on ferroelectric ceramics not only gave rise to what is today a multibillion dollar industry (Haertling 1999), but ultimately paved the way to principally new perovskite-based technologies and materials, from barrier layer capacitors to high-temperature superconductors, high-response piezoelectrics, proton conductors, fuel cells, memory storage devices, colossal magnetoresistors (e.g., Galasso 1990; Tejuca and Fierro 1992; Kreuer 2003; Ishihara 2009; Qi et al. 2010) and, most recently, organometal halides for photovoltaic applications (Liu et al. 2013).\n\nTable 1 Perovskite timeline: major discoveries and breakthroughs in research and technology Full size table\n\nKnown to occur, in addition to Akhmatovskaya-style skarns, in various silica-undersaturated igneous rocks (\u201cbasalts\u201d) since at least the 1870s (Bo\u0159ick\u00fd 1876), perovskite had, by the 1970s, been recognized as a fairly common accessory mineral in chondrite meteorites, kimberlites and several other industrially important rocks, whereas the perovskite group already numbered six recognized species. Following the groundbreaking experimental work of Lin-gun Liu (1974), silicate perovskite (Mg,Fe)SiO 3 has been identified as the principal constituent of the Earth\u2019s lower mantle (Knittle and Jeanloz 1987) and, as such, the most abundant terrestrial mineral. More recently, this phase was documented in shock-induced veinlets in meteorites (Tomioka and Fujino 1997). Tremendous implications of these discoveries for the understanding of Earth\u2019s evolution and planetary processes are reflected in the fact that more than 200 research papers and reviews have been published on (Mg,Fe)SiO 3 in the past 40 years, easily making it one of the best-studied perovskite-type compounds to date.\n\nIn striking contrast to the progress made in the materials science and high-pressure fields (Table 1), there had been little work done on \u201cnormal-pressure\u201d crustal perovskites prior to the 1990s; many members of that group had not even been structurally studied. This imbalance was first recognized by Roger H. Mitchell (Fig. 2a), one of the world\u2019s leading experts on lamproites, carbonatites and other igneous rocks that often contain accessory perovskite (Fig. 2b). Roger\u2019s interest in this subject, dating back to his early research on kimberlites (Mitchell 1972), led to a painstakingly systematic study of the composition, isotopic variation, paragenesis, crystal structure and phase relations of perovskite and related Ti(\u00b1Nb) oxides from dozens of localities around the world, as well as of composition-driven structural changes across several synthetic solid solution series of petrologic significance. Some of the problems Roger set off to tackle proved so complex that their resolution required years of dedicated effort and the use of multiple cutting-edge instruments (see, e.g., Mitchell et al., this issue). Among his greatest contributions was the demonstration of the compositional and structural complexity of naturally occurring perovskites and of their potential value as petrogenetic indicators. This work culminated in some 50 peer-reviewed papers and a monograph (Mitchell 2002) that the inventor of perovskite structural hierarchy Mike Glazer praised as \u201cthe book that I wish I had written!\u201d (Glazer 2002). The present thematic issue is a tribute to Roger\u2019s career-long fascination with perovskites and his insightful research in that area. It is hard to think of a journal that would be more appropriate for this publication than Physics and Chemistry of Minerals, whose cover has featured the tilted perovskite octahedra since 1997 (Kohlstedt and Langer 1997).\n\nFig. 2 a Professor Emeritus Roger H.

She penned the details in her blog.\n\nThe first and most prominent kind of deception she discovered was the manipulation of images, either by duplicating sections of an image or repeating the same images. There is duplication in images featuring animals as well. There are several instances where features in an image are duplicated multiple times within the same image.\n\nPatterns in graphs also seemed problematic, according to Bik. Several papers containing different graphs showed similar patterns, both within the same paper and also across multiple papers. These included graphs even showing the same background noise, which is random and really cannot be replicated in different setups, let alone different experiments.\n\nBik also discovered instances of plagiarism \u2014 in one paper, there was little to no original text at all.\n\nThe 90-year-old Annamalai University is accredited \u2018Grade A\u2019 by the Indian National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). A vital criterion in retaining this grade is to publish a large number of research papers.\n\nThePrint reached NAAC for a comment, but there was no response.\n\nK. VijayRaghavan, Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India, said, \u201cMy office will be bringing this to the attention of the chancellor of the university and to relevant funding agencies. This will happen in the next few days. We expect them to examine the matter speedily and correctly.\u201d\n\nAlso read: Forget top 100 list, India doesn\u2019t even have a mechanism to identify research universities\n\nVice-chancellor also implicated\n\nBik also dug into the vice-chancellor of the university, V. Murugesan.\n\n\u201cIn this particular case at Annamalai, the research misconduct was very widespread, and also appear to have affected the current vice-chancellor, who is ultimately responsible for research conducted at his university,\u201d Bik said.\n\nOut of the papers where Murugesan is listed as author, at least 14 have image manipulation issues. In multiple instances, the same photo has been used in different papers, and there are also images which feature multiple duplications of the same pattern.\n\n\u201cI had little hope reporting the problematic papers knowing that he himself has authored several of those papers,\u201d said Bik.\n\nThePrint also reached Murugesan for a comment, but there was no response.\n\nIndian academia rife with fraud\n\nThis is not the first time instances of image manipulation in published research papers submitted by researchers from Indian universities have come to light. Earlier this year, over 33 research papers originating from the CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute (CSIR-CDRI), Lucknow, were flagged by scientists for having manipulated images.\n\nSimilarly, over 130 papers from CSIR-IITR, Lucknow, and at least 28 papers from CSIR-IICB were flagged for manipulation or duplications. Over 127 papers from Indian universities have been retracted since 2016. For many other papers, the mistakes have been corrected.\n\nThe incidents prompted Shekhar Mande, director general of CSIR, to constitute a committee to draft \u2018Guidelines for Scientific Ethics and Research Integrity\u2019. He had also assured that action would be taken against those found guilty of scientific misconduct.\n\nThe Indian Council of Medical Research\u2019s (ICMR) Bioethics Unit at National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research, Bengaluru, also released a new policy on Research Integrity & Publication Ethics to \u201censure highest professional and ethical standards in inception, conduct, reporting, reviewing, publication of research\u201d.\n\nBut there is seemingly still a long way to go for Indian academia. Bik has found more problematic papers authored by Indian researchers, but not to the scale of the 200-plus papers from Annamalai University.\n\nThe Indian scientific community has been struggling in recent years to uphold its research integrity. Number of published research papers is an important criteria in the promotion of scientists in Indian universities, which prompt many to publish their research in dubious journals. In 2017, a report found that India was the top global contributor to research published in predatory journals.\n\nEarlier this year, the University Grants Commission had derecognised thousands of journals that were found to be predatory, and published a fresh list of 800 reputed journals.\n\nTo discourage researchers from publishing in these paid journals, UGC had asked all universities and colleges in the country to appoint and promote faculty members on the basis of its new list of approved journals.\n\n\u201cI hope that the Indian government and universities realise that scientific misconduct is extremely harmful for the reputation of research done in India. There need to be strict rules at each university,\u201d said Bik.\n\n\u201cI also hope there will be an overarching, independent organisation that can oversee research done at Indian universities, similar to the Office of Research Integrity in the USA,\u201d she added.\n\nAlso read: Plagiarism, data manipulation hurting India\u2019s research, govt panel raises alarm"}, {"url": "https://www.iitk.ac.in/mme/obituary/", "page_content": "OBITUARY\n\nProfessor Ramamurthy Balasubramaniam\n\nDepartment of Materials and Metallurgical Engineering.\n\nIndian Institute of Technology, Kanpur\n\nWebsite: http://home.iitk.ac.in/~bala/\n\nProfessor Ramamurthy Balasubramaniam (fondly known as \u2018Bala\u2019) was born on 15 April 1961 in Salem, TamilNadu.
