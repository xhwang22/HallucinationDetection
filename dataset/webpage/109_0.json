{"Frank Abagnale Jr. was born on April 27, 1948.": [{"url": "https://www.biography.com/crime/frank-abagnale", "page_content": "(1948-)\n\nWho Is Frank Abagnale?\n\nThe son of a stationery business owner, Frank Abagnale entered the world of crime as a youngster with credit card and check schemes. He later impersonated various white-collar professionals, creating an overseas trail, and was arrested at 21 by the French police. Abagnale was eventually hired by the FBI as a consultant and then started his own agency, educating corporations, financial institutions and government organizations on how to detect and handle fraudulence. A portion of his life was the subject of the popular 2002 film Catch Me If You Can.\n\nEarly Life\n\nFrank Abagnale Jr. was born on April 27, 1948, in Bronxville, New York. Much of the information known to the public about his personal history was shared in his 1980 memoir Catch Me If You Can. Abagnale would later say via his website that some of the details in the book were exaggerated, with the preface also stating that certain details of the story were altered to protect other parties.\n\nAccording to the memoir, Abagnale was the third of four children born to parents Paulette Abagnale and Frank Abagnale Sr. The couple met in Algiers during World War II, while Frank Sr. was stationed in Oran, with Paulette still only in her teens when they wed. After the war, the two moved to New York, where Frank Sr. started his own business.\n\nAbagnale would later state that he had a stable childhood and was especially close to his father, who traveled often and became deeply involved in Republican local politics. When his mother decided to leave Frank Sr. due to her husband's absences, the younger Frank's life was turned upside-down. Not only were his siblings devastated, but so was his father, who was still in love with his wife. As his mother worked toward her independence, Frank Jr. decided to live with his father after the divorce, and he often tagged along on business dealings. It was during this time that Frank Jr. learned about white-collar transactions.\n\nCredit Card Schemes\n\nAs a teenager, Abagnale got caught up in petty crimes, including shoplifting. He soon grew tired of these practices, though, and decided to move into more sophisticated forms of burglary. Specifically, Abagnale began using his father's gas credit card to make a tidy profit. Abagnale convinced gas station attendants to give him a portion of his sale back in cash and allowed them to pocket a portion of the proceeds. The scam fell apart, though, when his father got the credit card bill, which added up to thousands of dollars. Unbeknownst to Abagnale, his father was struggling financially.\n\nDismayed over her son's delinquency, Abagnale's mother sent him to a school for wayward boys. Undone by his father's newfound circumstances and caught between his parents' tensions, Abagnale reportedly left home at 16 years old.\n\nAbagnale had little in his bank account and no formal education. Abagnale altered his driver\u2019s license to make himself 10 years older than he was and exaggerated his education. This helped him get better-paying jobs, but he still barely made ends meet.\n\nAbagnale decided to quit working and wrote bad checks to support himself. Before long, Abagnale had written hundreds of bad checks and overdrawn his account by thousands of dollars. Knowing that he would eventually be caught, he went into hiding.\n\nImpersonations Meant to Impress\n\nAbagnale realized that he could cash more bad checks if he dazzled bank tellers with a new, more impressive personality. He decided pilots were highly respected professionals, so he schemed his way into getting a pilot's uniform. Abagnale called Pan American Airlines' headquarters and told them that he had lost his uniform while traveling. HQ told him where to go to pick up a new one, which he did \u2014 and charged it to the company using a fake employee I.D.\n\nAbagnale then learned all he could about flying \u2014 once, by pretending he was a high schooler doing a student newspaper article on Pan Am \u2014 and cleverly forged his own pilot's I.D. and F.A.A. license. His ruse earned him valuable information about how to impersonate a pilot, which he did allegedly in order to hitch rides on planes all across the world.\n\nOnce Pan Am and police began catching on to Abagnale's lies, he decided to change identities again, this time becoming an out-of-town doctor in Georgia. When a local doctor came visiting, Abagnale thought his identity was blown \u2014 but instead, he was invited to visit the local hospital, where he became a regular visitor and purportedly landed a temporary job. Abagnale eventually gave up the gig and left town.\n\nOver the next two years, Abagnale was said to have bounced from job to job. But eventually, Abagnale's past caught up with him when he settled down in Montpelier, France. He had decided to live a straight life for awhile after having reputedly cashed $2.5 million in bad checks over the years. When a former girlfriend recognized his face on a wanted poster, she turned him in to authorities.\n\nJail Time and Consultancy\n\nAbagnale served time in France (reputedly in the harsh confines of Perpignan, where he became seriously ill), Sweden and the United States for his crimes, during which time his father died. Abagnale was eventually granted parole after several years from a Petersburg, Virginia prison. He eventually found lecturing work as a white-collar crime specialist, providing information to bank employees about ways to avoid fraud and theft.\n\nIn exchange for his freedom, the government told Abagnale that he had to educate them about his methods in order to prevent others from defrauding authorities. Abagnale worked with the FBI for more than 30 years as one of the world\u2019s foremost experts on document fraud, check swindling, forgery and embezzlement. He also started his own company, Abagnale & Associates, which educates others on how to avoid becoming fraud victims.\n\nMovie: 'Catch Me If You Can'\n\nIn 2002, Steven Spielberg made a film about Abagnale's life, Catch Me If You Can, based on the aforementioned memoir. Leonardo DiCaprio starred as the famous impostor, with Christopher Walken portraying Frank Abagnale Sr. and receiving an Oscar nod for the role. The movie later inspired a Broadway musical version which ran for several months in 2011 at the Neil Simon Theatre.\n\nUpon the film's release, more questions were raised about what parts of Abagnale's story are true and can be verified. Abagnale has later said that he regrets that the film was made, preferring to have left that part of his life behind.\n\nBooks\n\nAbagnale wrote the books The Art of the Steal (2001) and Stealing Your Life (2007), both about fraud prevention.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nBirth Year: 1948\n\nBirth date: April 27, 1948\n\nBirth State: New York\n\nBirth City: Bronxville\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Frank Abagnale gained notoriety in the United States and overseas for his fraudulent crimes.

However, Frank Sr. possibly never imagined that he would become his son\u2019s first victim. When he was 15 years old, Frank Jr. used his father\u2019s gasoline credit card to buy car parts and then sold them off. This mischief caused his father a debt of $3,400. Frank Jr. was caught when the credit card bill arrived and was thrashed by his father.\n\nThe Abagnale children had a good life until it all turned upside down. Frank\u2019s mother was not happy with his father and their financial troubles and wanted a divorce. The happy family was on the verge of breaking down. When the divorce was finally granted, his father was devastated. Frank stayed with him and never left his side in this hour of crisis. Frank also started taking interest in his father\u2019s business transactions. It was during this time that he became acquainted with white collar transactions for the first time.\n\nFrank Jr. was the third of the four children in the family. Frank later stated that contrary to popular belief, he had a very stable childhood and was close to his father. When Frank Sr. became extensively interested in local politics, Frank Jr. often accompanied him on his long trips.\n\nFrank Abagnale Jr. was born to an affluent business family in Bronxville, New York, on April 27, 1948, to a French mother, Paulette, and a Jewish father, Frank Abagnale Sr. His parents had met in Algiers, where Frank Sr. was stationed as an army personnel. Paulette was in her teens when she met Frank, and once the war was over, Frank married her and brought her back to New York. He then started his own business, which quickly turned into a successful enterprise.\n\nRecommended Lists:\n\nThe Crime Life\n\nWhen he left home, Frank had very little money in his bank account. His bank balance primarily consisted of his earnings from part-time jobs. However, the money he had was not enough for him to sustain his lifestyle. Furthermore, he did not get any formal education, and it was difficult for him to find a better-paying job. He indulged in shoplifting but was not caught. This helped him gain confidence for bigger frauds, and he decided to target banks.\n\nHe indulged in confidence tricks and wrote many personal checks to banks on his overdrawn accounts. He created several new identities and opened different accounts in many banks to sustain his tricks. He also magnetically printed his account number on bank deposit slips and stole several hundred dollars from the banks. As soon as he realized that he would not be able to sustain this fraud for long, he went into hiding. However, this was not before he had accumulated enough money that would sustain him for a couple of years.\n\nHe used tricks such as dressing up as a security guard and stealing the money from airlines and car rental companies. He once put up an \u201cout of order\u201d sign in front of the drop box for payments that instructed the depositors to hand over their money to the guard on duty. He then collected the money, disguised as a guard, and disappeared before getting caught.\n\nWhen he had saved enough money, Frank decided to finally make his dream of traveling around the world a reality. He soon came up with a trick using which he would be able to travel the world without having to pay a single dime. He called up the \u2018Pan Am\u2019 administration and told them that he was a pilot and that he had lost his uniform. He produced a fake pilot\u2019s licence and got a new uniform. However, he did not make his way into \u2018Pan Am\u2019s cockpits, knowing that he would eventually be exposed.\n\nHe availed of flights and stayed in expensive hotels on the company\u2019s expenses. When, on one occasion, he was asked to take charge of flying a plane, he put the flight on auto-pilot mode, as he was clueless about how to fly a plane. After he had had enough of this trick, he went back to the US and assumed the identity of a doctor in a Georgia hospital for 11 months. Soon, he realized that his lack of experience in the field could cost people their lives. He thus quit the hospital soon."}, {"url": "https://historycollection.com/catch-can-real-story-frank-abagnale-jr/", "page_content": "Frank Abagnale Jr. is one of the most famous con artists in history. Some say he is the best, although pedants would point out that the best confidence tricksters are the ones you\u2019ve never heard about. Nonetheless, Abagnale led an extraordinary life where he assumed up to eight identities, cashed approximately $2.5 million worth of bad checks (his estimate), and lived a fast-paced life filled with drama and suspense; all by the time, he was 21 years old. The movie \u2018Catch Me If You Can\u2019 is based on his life story, with Leonardo DiCaprio playing the role of Abagnale.\n\nEarly Life\n\nHe was born on April 27, 1948, in New York and his father, Frank Sr., and mother, Paulette, divorced when he was 14 years old. Abagnale was extremely close to his father, and he viewed him as a role model. He used to attend business meetings with his father, and this is where he learned details about business transactions. Despite having a relatively stable childhood, Abagnale soon resorted to petty crimes such as shoplifting. However, he quickly grew bored of it and sought a greater criminal challenge.\n\nIronically, Abagnale\u2019s father was the first victim of his con artist career. When he was 15, he called various gas stations and told the owners to ring him up for merchandise (such as tires), but gave him a cash sum well below the real value of the products. Abagnale used his father\u2019s charge card for the scam for about a month, until his father received a bill for $3,400. What Abagnale didn\u2019t know was that his father was struggling financially.\n\nHis mother sent him to a school for \u2018troubled boys,\u2019 and during that period his father lost his business. Meanwhile, Abagnale left home at the age of 16 and earned just $1.50 an hour for his first job. He believed the low pay was due to his age rather than the lack of a high school degree, so he altered his ID to pretend he was 10 years older.\n\nThe Beginning of a Crime Spree\n\nAbagnale was a master check forger and was apparently the first to exploit the routing of checks via the numbers on the code line. However, he had difficulties at the beginning because the practice of writing bad checks and overdrawing his account only happened for so long before banks demanded payment.\n\nAs a result, it was necessary to use innovative methods of conning people out of money. On one occasion, he took a batch of bank deposit slips, prefilled his account number and placed them back in the stack. The reason? Abagnale noticed that most people left the account number section blank, but the banks always went by the section if it was filled. The next morning, he woke up to find $42,000 in his account.\n\nAbagnale soon realized that he would have more success with his bad checks if he could showcase an air of authority. He knew that pilots were well-respected individuals, so he used his cunning to acquire a uniform. It was here that his career as a con artist quite literally \u2018took off.\u2019"}, {"url": "https://www.ancientfaces.com/person/frank-w-abagnale-jr-birth-1948/100032830", "page_content": "Con-expert was easy man to believe\n\nPublished on Sunday, February 13, 1977 in The News Port Arthur Texas newspaper\n\n\n\nGalveston (UPI) - It's easy to believe Frank W. Abagnale Jr. Just ask all the people who cashed his bad checks totaling more than $2.5 million in more than 29 countries.\n\n\n\nAsk the people who thought he was an airline pilot. Or the others who believed he was a lawyer Or a doctor Or a college professor. Or the prison guards who let him out of jail thinking he wasn't a prisoner.\n\n\n\nAbagnale, now reformed and living in Houston, recently opened up and talked about his years as a con artist and his life since.\n\n\n\nThe story begins with the separation of Abagnale's parents when he was 16 and living in upstate New York. As the troubles at home grew, Abagnale ran away to New York City.\n\n\n\nHe encountered more troubles. Even by lying about his age, jobs were hard to find. He began passing bad checks.\n\n\n\nHe found it easier to cash checks if he passed himself off as someone else. He found the company that manufactured Pan American Airline uniforms and talked an employee into selling him oce. He told people he was a Pan Am pilot.\n\n\n\nIt became easier to pass checks. His troubles were diminishing.\n\n\n\nCarrying the ruse further, Abagnale acquired metal Pan Am wings and the authentic hat pin. He obtained a fake ID card from a different company.\n\n\n\nArmed with the tools of his masquerade and with the confidence he needed to make it work. Abagnale embarked on an around-the-world con.\n\n\n\nAs a crew member of a scheduled airline,, he flew for free, cashed checks easily and convinced everyone, lady acquaintances met along the way included, that he was in his late twenties.\n\n\n\nIn fact, Frank Abagnale was 18. \"It was just natural for me to do all that.\" he said \"I just found I had the ability\". His cash flow hampered by a $100 limit on personal checks, Abagnale moved up in class by developing Pan American \"expense\" checks for himself, designed with the help of press-on letts and numbers over blank checks with the added touch of a logotype fashioned from a plastic airplane model kit.\n\n\n\n\"I supported Reveli Model Co.\", Abagnale said \"I probably bought 2000 Pan Am model planes\". When Abagnale talks about his experiences, he has a certain amazed expression, part combination of pride that he pulled it off and part bewilderment that so many people actually bought the act.\n\n\n\nWith the airline, the FBI and Interpol finally closing in, Abagnale changed hats, first, posing as a lawyer in Louisiana for six months (\"I think being a lawyer is just being a good con artist\"), then a doctor only administrative functions in Georgia, then a college professor in Utah. He was eventually caught on bad check charges and jailed for six months in France \"They kind of make the Mexican prisons look like the Holiday inns\" he said. From there he was taken to Sweden and a year later deported to the United States.\n\n\n\nSecurity guards and FBI agents were waiting in NEw York, but Abagnale escaped through a hatch in the plane's restroom \"I wasn't trying to be sneaky\" he sai \"I just wanted to get off the plane.\" Authorities found in Montreal, Canada and sent him to the penitentiary in Atlanta. At first he said \"the farthest thing from my mind was escaping from there\". But then one day, with guards mistaking him for a prison inspector, he walked free again.\n\n\n\nCaptured in New York he was sentenced to 72 years in prison, later reduced to 12. He was paroled after four years in the Federal Reformatory in Peterburg, Va. He moved to Houston and tried to start over, but twice when he was in line for promotion, companies found out about his past and fired him.\n\n\n\nSo he's working now in security, establishing himself as an authority. He has his own consulting firm and he makes personal appearances at school banquets. Production on \"The Skyway Man\" a movie based on his experiences is due to start in the Spring. Now 28 years old, Abagnali says he's decided to play it straight. \"I didn't want to be known the rest of my life as a great con artist.\" he said \"Nobody remembers Derrmand Dema's the great imposter and nobody will remember me.\""}, {"url": "https://factsbuddy.com/frank-abagnale-jr/", "page_content": "Frank Abagnale Jr Bio | Wiki\n\nFrank Abagnale Jr is a popular American author and convicted felon who harassed individuals and small businesses.

Frank was raised in a very tumultuous business household and was born and raised in New York. When he was 12 years old, his parents separated, which may have had a significant impact on how he developed into a notorious criminal genius. When Frank was only 15 years old, his father was his first target. Frank defrauded him of more than $3,000 during that time. As a result, he dropped out of school and ultimately began living a life of crime. In his brief tenure as a fraudster, he is thought to have used no less than eight different identities, including those of an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer. He was apprehended three times but managed to get away with the first two by deceiving the officials. After serving about five years in prison, he was granted release in 1974 on the understanding that he would assist the \u201cFederal Bureau of Investigation\u201d (FBI) is looking into crimes that were comparable to those he had committed. Since then, he has created his own security company and has been working as a security consultant.\n\nEarly Youth & Life\n\nOn April 27, 1948, in Bronxville, New York, Frank Abagnale Junior. was born to a wealthy business family consisting of a French mother named Paulette and a Jewish father named Frank Abagnale Sr. While Frank Sr. was serving in the army in Algeria, his parents got acquainted. When Paulette and Frank first met, she was in her teens. After the war, they got married and moved back to New York. He then launched his own company, which became very successful very rapidly.\n\nFrank Jr. was the third of the family\u2019s four kids. Contrary to popular belief, Frank subsequently claimed that he had a very stable childhood and was close to his father. Frank Jr. frequently traveled with Frank Sr. when he developed a keen interest in neighborhood affairs.\n\nBefore everything turned upside down, the Abagnale children had a good existence. Frank\u2019s mother desired a divorce because she was unhappy with his father and their financial situation. The contented family was on the brink of disintegrating. His father was devastated when the divorce was eventually finalized. In this hour of need, Frank remained by his side the entire time. Frank began showing interest in his father\u2019s financial dealings as well. This was the period when he first became familiar with white-collar business dealings.\n\nFrank\u2019s father frequently expressed his admiration for his intelligence. But it\u2019s possible that Frank Sr. never thought he\u2019d be his son\u2019s first casualty. When he was 15 years old, Frank Jr. bought auto parts with his father\u2019s gas credit card and later sold them. His father owed $3,400 as a result of this misconduct. When the credit card statement came, Frank Jr. was discovered and beaten by his father. Frank fled home when he was 16 years old.\n\nThe Life of Crime\n\nFrank had very little money in his bank account when he departed his house. His earnings from part-time employment made up the majority of his bank balance. He did not have enough money to support his way of living, though. He also did not receive any formal education, which made it challenging for him to obtain a better-paying job. Despite engaging in theft, he escaped detection. He chose to target banks because this gave him the confidence to commit larger frauds.\n\nHe used confidence tricks, and on his overdrawn accounts, he penned numerous personal checks to banks. To continue his tricks, he adopted numerous new identities and established numerous new accounts. He also took several hundred dollars from the banks and magnetically printed his account number on bank deposit slips. He fled into seclusion as soon as he realized he would not be able to continue this fraud for very long. However, he did not do this before saving up enough cash to last him for a few years.\n\nHe stole money from airlines and car rental businesses using cunning methods like posing as a security guard. He once posted a notice that the payment drop box was \u201cout of order\u201d and asked people to give their money to the on-duty security instead. He then took the cash, pretended to be a security, and vanished without being discovered.\n\nFrank made the decision to eventually fulfill his lifelong dream of world travel once he had amassed sufficient funds. He quickly devised a method by which he could traverse the globe without spending a single penny. He made a call to the \u201cPan Am\u201d management and informed them of his loss of uniform and status as a pilot. He obtained a new uniform and presented a fake pilot\u2019s license. He avoided entering the cockpits of \u201cPan Am\u201d though, as he was aware that he would ultimately come to light.\n\nOn the company\u2019s dime, he used flights and booked expensive lodgings. He once was asked to assume control of flying a plane, but because he had no idea how to do it, he put the flight on auto-pilot. He returned to the US and pretended to be a doctor for 11 months in a Georgia hospital after tiring of this ruse. He soon came to the conclusion that his dearth of industry knowledge might endanger lives. He quickly left the hospital as a result.\n\nHis next objective was \u201cHarvard University\u2019s\u201d law school. He presented forged documents claiming to be a graduate of the school. He put in two weeks of intense study time and succeeded on the bar test. Later, he succeeded in landing a position at the Louisiana State Attorney General\u2019s office.\n\nHe had just turned 19 years old. One of his coworkers was from \u201cCambridge,\u201d and when he inquired about Frank\u2019s time spent there, Frank was unable to respond. Frank instantly resigned from his position after sensing that his lies would soon come to light.\n\nCapture and Detention\n\nWhen Frank was identified by one of his ex-girlfriends in 1969, he was living a comfortable life in Montrichard, France. He was sought after by 12 different governments when the French police found him, and he was eventually extradited. He was imprisoned in several nations. He was given a 12-year sentence in a US federal prison after the US requested his extradition while he was being tried in Sweden.\n\nHe managed to escape the police twice, but he was finally apprehended and imprisoned in Petersburg, Virginia, in 1971. When the authorities made him a deal to assist them with fraud cases, which were at an all-time high in the US, he spent less than five years in prison before being freed.\n\nFrank\u2019s Following Years\n\nKelly Anne and Frank Abagnale first connected when he was employed by the \u201cFBI.\u201d They shortly got hitched and now reside in Charleston, South Carolina. Sean, Chris, and Scott are their three boys. Frank\u2019s life served as the inspiration for Steven Spielberg\u2019s highly acclaimed movie \u201cCatch Me If You Can.\u201d\n\nThe film also enjoyed tremendous financial success. Leonardo DiCaprio played the part of Frank in the movie.\n\nFrank maintained a close friendship with Joseph Shea, the \u201cFBI\u201d agent who was instrumental in bringing Frank to justice, for a very long period.\n\nEstimated Net Worth\n\nAn American security expert with a $10 million fortune is Frank Abagnale. He rose to fame as one of the most notorious impostors ever due to his past as a check forger and impostor. He claimed to have taken on no less than eight aliases during this time."}, {"url": "https://biographics.org/frank-abagnale-biography-catch-me-if-you-can/", "page_content": "Frank Abagnale\n\nLoading...\n\nHe has achieved legendary status among con men by pulling off some of the most outrageous, brazen and unbelievable deceits in the history of fraud. By the age of 21, he had impersonated a Pan Am pilot, a pediatric supervising doctor and a lawyer, charming everyone he met and bouncing checks all over the world. In this week\u2019s Biographics, we take a look at the incredible story of Frank William Abagnale.\n\nEarly Life\n\nFrank William Abagnale was born on April 27th, 1948 in New Rochelle, New York. Named after his father, who owned a stationery business, Frank was the third of four children. His mother, Paulette, was of French-Algerian extraction. The couple met while Frank, Sr. was on active service in Algiers during World War 2. They were soon married despite a thirteen -year age gap.\n\nFrank, Sr. proved to be a very successful businessman with the stationery store doing exceptionally well. As a result, the family lived in a large home and, although the Abagnale\u2019s were by no means rich, Frank. Jr and his siblings had a comfortable childhood.\n\nA Family Torn Apart\n\nFrank attended Ioana Catholic School in Westchester, New York. His world was turned upside down in 1960, when his parents separated. This came as a shock to all the children, who thought that their mother was a contented housewife who had everything she ever wanted. However, Frank Sr. was very active in local body politics, as well as being active in the management of the New York Yacht Club. In addition, he was a very keen deep-sea fisherman. All of these interests meant that he was often away from home. One day he came home from an overseas marlin fishing adventure to find that his wife and four kids had moved out.\n\nFrank Sr. was crushed by the separation. He deeply loved his wife and fought to get her back until the day he died. But Paulette\u2019s mind was made. As a sign of independence, she enrolled in dental college and began building a life of her own.\n\nFrank Sr. recruited Jr. to help him win back Paulette\u2019s affections. He would give his son gifts to pass on, schooling him just to what to say and how to say it. But Paulette wouldn\u2019t budge. The couple divorced when Frank was fourteen.\n\nLiving with Dad\n\nUnlike his siblings, Frank chose to live with his father. This opened up a whole new world for the teenager, who had been used to a regimented and disciplined life with his mother. Tagging along with his dad, he began spending time in the bars around New York as Frank Sr. wheeled and dealed amongst the city\u2019s businessmen and politicians. The experience quickly made the boy street-wise.\n\nIt was around this time that Frank began to skip school in order to run with a handful of local punks who were, like him, from dysfunctional families and seeking some way to express their frustrations. Frank was bigger and more mature looking than his associates, which was handy when it to came to playing hooky \u2013 he was often mistaken for a teacher on an outing with students. The group committed minor crimes like sneaking into movie theaters and stealing candy.\n\nFrank soon became frustrated at the childishness and lack of sophistication of his partners in crime. They didn\u2019t exhibit any of the class that he had realized was the key to making it as a successful criminal. Things came to a head when his mates stole a car while the owner was watering his lawn. They swung by to pick Frank up only to be stopped by the police moments later.\n\nFrank and his fellow cons were thrown into juvenile detention. Frank Sr\u2019s political connections managed to get his son sprung and to have any mention of the incident erased from the record.\n\nFrank\u2019s dad told him that he was wasting his time hanging around kids who were clearly not as mature or sophisticated as him. It was time to start acting like a man. The pep talk seemed to do the trick and Frank began attending school regularly. He also got a part time job as a shipping clerk at a warehouse in Bronxville. To show his support for his son\u2019s change of direction, Frank Sr. bought him his first car \u2013 an old Ford.\n\nWheels and Girls\n\nHaving a set of wheels opened up new horizons for young Frank. Specifically, it allowed him to meet and enjoy the company of girls. For the next couple of years, by his own admission, he was consumed with satisfying his teenage libido. He would cruise around town, prowling for a young lady that he could entice with his ever-growing charm into an evening of intimate activity.\n\nFrank soon discovered that his sexual excursions cost money. Invariably he\u2019d have to supply his conquest with a coke and a burger in order to keep her happy. The problem was that his meager finances didn\u2019t allow for such an expense.\n\nFrank approached his dad and requested a gas charge card. He promised that he wouldn\u2019t abuse the privilege and his father was impressed with his sincerity. He handed his Mobil card over to his son.\n\nLoading...\n\nA month later, Frank enacted his first scam. Pulling into a Mobil gas station he saw a sign announcing that you can put a new set of tires on your car and charge it to your Mobil Card. It was then that he realized that you could use the card for other things aside from gas. Thinking fast, he approached an attendant at the station that he was familiar with.\n\nFrank asked what it would cost for a new sets of tires \u2013 the answer was $160. Frank readily acknowledged that he didn\u2019t need new tires but said that he was desperately short of cash. So, he suggested that he buy the set of tires and charge them to the card. But rather than taking the tires, the attendant would give Frank a hundred dollars for them. He could then sell off the tires for $160, making a quick sixty-dollar profit.\n\nTen minutes later Frank drove away from the Mobil with a hundred dollars cash in his pocket. He was hooked.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Frank replicated the scheme at different Mobil stations around the Bronx. At times he would simplify the deal, offering the pump attendant to give him ten dollars of cash while signing a bill for a twenty-dollar gas sale.\n\nIt was only when the bill from Mobil arrived that Frank realized that his father was the chump who would pay for his excesses. But Frank had a simple solution- he threw the bills into the waste bin. Of course, that didn\u2019t solve anything. Pretty soon, a Mobil representative visited Frank Sr. at his store and requested an explanation for an outstanding $3,400 bill in 3 months after 15 years of impeccable payment history.\n\nFrank Jr. was called in front of both men to explain. He said he didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, but neither man was convinced. Finally, Frank admitted it, but quickly offered the ultimate excuse . . .\n\nIt\u2019s the girl\u2019s dad \u2013 they do funny things to me. I can\u2019t explain it.\n\nHis father nodded with a wry smile and replied . . .\n\nDon\u2019t worry about it, boy. Einstein couldn\u2019t understand it either.\n\nUnfortunately for young Frank, his mother wasn\u2019t so understanding. She blamed his criminal activity on the influence of his father and promptly organized for him to attend a Catholic private school for problem children. Frank spent a year there. During those twelve months his father\u2019s financial fortunes took a steep reverse and he lost almost everything. He was quick to assure his son that the $3,400 that he had stolen was not a factor in his money problems.\n\nOn His Own\n\nFrank left home at 16. He left without saying a word to anyone, hopping on a train to New York City. Along with the few belongings that he\u2019d crammed into a suitcase, he had in his possession a check book that had $200 in the account. An hour off the train he had attached himself to a teenage boy and convinced him to take him home with him. Frank went on to spin a story about being an orphan and that he was determined to make it on his own in the big city. The parents offered for him a stay to as long as he wanted it.\n\nThe next day Frank got a job as a stock clerk for $1.50 per hour. He quickly found out this was not going to pay his way in New York. He figured that the reason for his low wage was his age. So, he simply altered the date of birth on his driver\u2019s license from 1948 to 1938. Now, as a 26-year-old, he went out looking for another job. He found one as a truck driver\u2019 helper for $2.75 an hour.\n\nFrank supplemented his income by cashing checks from his account. After a couple of days, he knew that his account was overdrawn, but that technicality didn\u2019t phase him. He continued writing bad checks on a daily basis. It didn\u2019t take him long to rationalise that his time working for $2.75 an hour was not worth his effort. So, he quit and simply wrote more bad checks.\n\nPilot\n\nOne day, while walking along 42nd Street, Frank was stopped in his tracks at the sight of an aircrew from Eastern Airlines emerging from the Commodore Hotel. He was mesmerized as the captain, co-pilot, flight engineer and four stewardesses breezed by. Frank wrote in his memoir that he had never seen such a splendid group of people.\n\nHis mind began to work overtime. Imagine if he were a pilot. He would have instant respect \u2013 and, as a result, would be able to cash checks anywhere with impunity. Continuing down the street, he found himself outside of the Pan Am building. Quickly he formulated a plan. He returned to his accommodation, found Pam Am\u2019s phone number, rang and asked to speak to someone in the purchasing department. He went on to inform the purchasing officer that he was a Pam Am pilot based in Los Angeles. He was due to hop a flight back home at 8 pm, but his uniform had been stolen. He confidently requested a replacement uniform.\n\nThe helpful purchasing officer gave Frank directions to the uniform company to pick up his uniform. He walked out with a complete co-pilot\u2019s uniform in hand. What he needed now was a pilot\u2019s ID card. He quickly had one made up, affixing the Pan Am logo from a model plane that he purchased for $2.49.\n\nDecked out in his Pan Am uniform, Frank walked into La Guardia airport. He was soon approached by a TWA co-pilot who asked what Pan Am was doing at La Guardia. It turned out that Pan Am did not fly out of La Guardia. Picking up on his research, Frank replied . . .\n\n\u2018oh, I just deadheaded in from Frisco on the first flight I could catch. I\u2019ll catch a chopper to Kennedy\u2019\n\nThis answer seemed to satisfy. But then the co-pilot asked . . .\n\nWhat kind of equipment you on?\n\nThis threw Frank. In his research, he hadn\u2019t come across the word equipment used in that context. Searching for the right answer, he came out with . . .\n\nGeneral Electric.\n\nThe pilot was actually asking what type of plane Frank flew so the quizzical look on his face at this reply was understandable. Frank quickly made his departure. He didn\u2019t attempt to board a plane that first day. He was to spend some weeks getting confident in his role as he wandered the airport, struck up conversations with pilots and built his store of \u2018shop knowledge\u2019. During this time, he also found great success in cashing checks in his pilot\u2019s uniform. In fact, the tellers couldn\u2019t give him the cash fast enough.\n\nFinally ready to take to the skies, Frank turned up at La Guardia\u2019s Eastern Operations office and informed the desk clerk that he needed to deadhead to Miami on the next flight, assuming that there was room on the plane. Deadheading was the name used for the practice of allowing staff to travel for free in order to get to a job location. He was told there was a vacancy on a flight departing in fifteen minutes. Within minutes he found himself in the cockpit sitting in a tiny seat which came down from the door behind him. With him were the pilot, co-pilot and flight attendant. After asking what type of equipment he flew, the three pretty much ignored him for the rest of the flight. Before getting off at Miami, Frank made a date with one the stewardesses who was laying over in Miami that night.\n\nAmazed at how simple the whole process had been, Frank became a serial deadheader. Upon arriving in a city, he would stay overnight in a motel used by Pam Am staff, charge the bill to the company, and in the morning, before heading to his next deadhead flight, cash a bad check for a hundred or more dollars just to have some ready cash. This pattern continued for two years, between the ages of sixteen and eighteen, taking him to twenty-six countries on more than 250 flights that covered in excess of a million miles.\n\nDoctor\n\nBy the middle of 1966, Frank was ready for a new gig. He had experienced a close call when someone had stated that he didn\u2019t actually work for Pan Am. Fortunately, his bluster and feigned outrage got him through the challenge but he knew that eventually the game would be up.\n\nIt was when applying for a long-term lease on an apartment in Atlanta, Georgia that he, on a whim, wrote down his profession as medical doctor. When asked what type of doctor he was, he replied that he was a pediatrician, based in California but was on a 12-month sabbatical to audit some research papers. Things went well for a period of time, until one day he got a knock at the door. His new neighbor introduced himself \u2013 Dr. Willis Granger, chief resident pediatrician at the Smithers General Hospital in Marietta.\n\nFrank was afraid that Granger would blow his cover but, fortunately the real doctor wasn\u2019t one to talk shop and they were able to cross each other\u2019s paths without incident. Meanwhile Frank spent as much time as he could at the local library reading up on the subject of pediatrics.\n\nA few weeks later Frank felt confident enough to accept an offer from Dr. Granger to tour Smithers General Hospital. After that he made regular visits. On one such occasion he was approached by the hospital administrator and asked to do him a huge favor \u2013 could he cover a midnight to eight shift for a doctor who would be away for ten days due to a death in the family?\n\nFrank objected that he didn\u2019t have a licence to practice in Georgia. But the administrator countered that he wouldn\u2019t really be doing anything during the night shift, just overseeing interns and nurses. So long as he passed an interview panel of five doctors everything would be fine.\n\nFrank\u2019s initial impulse was to refuse \u2013 there were too many dangers involved. But he was so intrigued with the challenge. And so he agreed.\n\nMuch to Frank\u2019s relief, the interview was light-hearted and non-inquisitorial. He was now a night shift pediatric supervising doctor with 8 interns and 40 nurses under his control. In order to make it through, Frank took on the persona of rule-breaking anti-establishment practitioner in the mold of Hawkeye Pierce on his favorite TV show, MASH. Things went smoothly until he was called to the emergency room. He took his time getting there, hoping that an intern would step in. When he finally arrived, there were three interns gathered around the patient. Frank asked them for their diagnoses, and when all three agreed he told then to go ahead with the procedure.\n\nAt the end of his ten-day stint, Frank was approached by the administrator and informed that the doctor he was replacing was not coming back. Could he possibly stay on until a replacement could be found? He ended up spending 11 months as a doctor at Smithers Hospital.\n\nLawyer\n\nAfter finishing up at the hospital, Frank decided to leave Atlanta. He moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana where he met up with a flight steward that he had formerly had a relationship with. Remembering that Frank had told her about his (supposed) law degree from Harvard, the girl introduced him at a party to assistant state\u2019s attorney, Jason Wilcox. On learning that Frank was currently out of work, Wilcox told him that the Attorney General was looking for bright articulate young lawyers. Why didn\u2019t he take the bar exam and practice with them?\n\nOnce again, Frank found it impossible to resist the challenge. On his third attempt he passed the bar exam. He was given a position in one of the Attorney General\u2019s civil departments. The job was really that of a glorified errand boy, but Frank was happy in the anonymity of the role. Around this time, he began dating a girl named Gloria, who was a staunch Methodist. Through this relationship he ended up on a church committee, sitting alongside a man who was a real graduate of Harvard Law School. This guy began asking too many specific questions and Frank knew it was time to pull the plug on his law career.\n\nFrank next turned up in Utah, where he claims to have scammed his way to becoming a teacher at Brigham Young University for eight months. However, the university denies that he ever worked there.\n\nPrisoner\n\nBy now Frank was wanted in many parts of the world for a long list of fraudulent activities. The FBI were on his trail, as was Interpol. His luck finally ran out while he was spending time in the southern French town of Montrichard. He was arrested on the basis of an Interpol warrant for fraud issued from Sweden for fraudulent checks written during a visit while he was supposedly a Pan Am employee. The French authorities soon discovered that he had written false checks all over their country also and so they refuse to honor the extradition.\n\nFrank was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment in France, which, after being reduced to 6 months, was served at Perpignan prison. Conditions were abysmal and Frank\u2019s weight went from 198 to 109 pounds during his stay there. He was then extradited to Sweden where he served another six months imprisonment.\n\nUpon his release from Malmo prison in Sweden, Frank was taken into custody by US Federal officers and returned to the United States. After a third trial, he was convicted to twelve years imprisonment for multiple cases of fraud. During his time in US custody he escaped twice but was recaptured on both occasions.\n\nGoing Straight\n\nAfter four years jail, Frank was offered a deal \u2013 his prison term would be quashed if he agreed be an on-call consultant to assist the authorities to investigate fraud cases.\n\nFrank agreed.\n\nAfter his release from prison he took on a succession of menial jobs, only to be fired for not revealing his criminal past. He then decided to parlay his vast criminal experience into a legitimate career by becoming a security consultant and advising companies as to how they could avoid the sorts of scams that he had perpetrated for so long. He went on to set up his own fraud protection company, Abagnale and Associates. He has been advising the FBI on fraud related matters for more than 40 years.\n\nFrank Abagnale, aged 70 in 2018, lives in Charleston, South Carolina, with his wife Kelly. They have three sons, one of whom works for the FBI.\n\nSources:\n\nCatch Me If You Can by Frank Abagnale (Kindle Edition)\n\nEncyclopedia of White Collar and Corporate Crime by Lawrence M.

Abagnale targeted individuals and small businesses, yet gained notoriety in the late 1970s by claiming a diverse range of victimless workplace frauds, many of which have since been placed in doubt. In 1980, Abagnale co-wrote his autobiography, Catch Me If You Can, which built a narrative around these claimed victimless frauds. The book inspired the film of the same name directed by Steven Spielberg in 2002, in which Abagnale was portrayed by actor Leonardo DiCaprio. He has also written four other books. Abagnale runs \"Abagnale and *ociates\", a consulting firm.\n\nAbagnale claims to have worked as an *istant state attorney general in the U.S. state of Louisiana, a hospital physician in Georgia, and impersonated a Pan American World Airways pilot who logged over two million air miles by deadheading. The veracity of most of Abagnale's claims have been questioned, and ongoing inquiries continue to confirm that they were made up. In 2002, Abagnale admitted on his website that some facts had been overdramatized or exaggerated, though he was not specific about what was exaggerated or omitted about his life. In 2020, journalist Alan C. Logan provided evidence he claims proves the majority of Abagnale's story was invented or at best exaggerated. The public records obtained by Logan have since been independently verified by journalist Javier Leiva.\n\nEarly life\n\nFrank William Abagnale Jr. was born in the Bronx, New York City, on April 27, 1948, to a French-American mother who died in November, 2014, and an Italian-American father who died in March, 1972. He spent his early life in Bronxville, New York. His parents separated when he was 12 and divorced when he was 15 years old. After the divorce, Abagnale moved with his father, and his new stepmother, to Mount Vernon, New York.\n\nAbagnale claims his first victim was his father, who gave him a gasoline credit card and a truck, and was ultimately liable for a bill amounting to $3,400. Abagnale was only 15 at the time. In his autobiography, Abagnale says, because of this crime, he was sent to a reform school in Westchester County, New York (fitting the description of the Lincolndale Agricultural School) run by Catholic Charities USA. In numerous interviews, Abagnale has claimed he attended an elite Catholic private school in Westchester, New York, Iona Preparatory School, through the 10th grade at age 16 in 1964. Abagnale is not mentioned by name, though, nor do any photographs of him appear in the Iona Preparatory School yearbooks from the time he ostensibly attended. Moreover, no alumni recall Abagnale ever attending the high school.\n\nIn December 1964, he enlisted in the United States Navy at the age of 16. He was discharged after less than three months, and was released on February 18, 1965. Less than two weeks after his release, Abagnale was arrested for petty larceny in Mount Vernon on February 26, 1965. The following month, in March 1965, Abagnale identified himself as a Scarsdale, New York, police officer and entered the apartment of a Mount Vernon, New York, resident claiming that he was investigating her teenaged daughter. Suspicious, the victim called the Mount Vernon police, who found Abagnale with a toy gun and a paper police badge. Abagnale was arrested and booked on a vagrancy charge after being identified in a lineup by the victim. The following day, Abagnale was ordered by the court to be committed to Gr*lands psychiatric ins*ute, in Westchester County, for observation.\n\nIn June 1965, the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Abagnale in Eureka, California, for car theft after he stole a Ford Mustang from one of his father's neighbors. Abagnale was pictured in the local newspaper, seated in a car, being questioned by Special Agent Richard Miller of the FBI. He had financed his cross-country trip from New York to California with blank checks stolen from a family business located on the Bronx River Parkway. Abagnale was also charged with impersonating a US customs official, although this charge was subsequently dropped. On July 2, 1965, this stolen-car case was transferred to the Southern District of New York.\n\nAirline pilot\n\nAfter being released into the custody of his father to face the stolen-car charges, 17-year-old Abagnale decided to impersonate a pilot. He obtained a uniform at a Manhattan uniform company, purchased with the money he obtained from the forgery of checks and on July 7, 1965, informed local media that he was a graduate of the American Airlines pilot school in Fort Worth, Texas, but he was arrested for theft of checks in Tuckahoe, New York days later. Abagnale was sentenced to three years at the Great Meadow Prison in Comstock, New York for these stolen checks. After serving only two years of his sentence, he was released into the custody of his mother, but he broke the terms of his parole with a stolen-car conviction in Boston, M*achusetts, and was returned to Great Meadow for one year.\n\nAfter his release on December 24, 1968, 20-year-old Abagnale disguised himself as a TWA pilot and moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he talked his way into the house of a local music teacher, whose daughter was a Delta Air Lines stewardess he had met in New York. In Baton Rouge, Abagnale also befriended a local minister, claimed he had a master's degree in social work from Ithaca College, and sought work with vulnerable youth with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The reverend introduced him to Louisiana State University faculty, who determined he was an \"obvious phony\". The reverend, after Abagnale told him he was a furloughed TWA pilot, became suspicious and called the airline, which informed him that Abagnale was a fraud. The reverend notified the Baton Rouge Police Department, and Abagnale was arrested on February 14, 1969, initially on vagrancy charges. Upon his arrest, he was found to have illegally driven his Florida rental car out of state and to possess falsified airline employee identification. The following day, detectives determined that Abagnale had stolen blank checks from his host family and a local business in Baton Rouge, and he was subsequently charged with theft and forgery. Unable to make bail, he was convicted on June 2, 1969, and was sentenced to 12 years of supervised probation, but he soon fled Louisiana for Europe.\n\nEurope\n\nTwo weeks after the Louisiana bench warrant was issued, Abagnale was arrested in Montpellier, France, in September 1969. He had stolen an automobile and defrauded two local families in Klippan, Sweden. He was sentenced to four months for theft in France, though he served only three months in Perpignan's prison.\n\nHe was then extradited to Sweden, where he was convicted of gross fraud by forgery. He served two months in a Malm\u00f6 prison, was banned from Sweden for eight years, and was required to compensate his Swedish victims (which he, allegedly, failed to do). Abagnale was deported back to the United States in June 1970, when his appeal failed.\n\nUnited States\n\nAfter returning to the United States, 22-year-old Abagnale dressed in a pilot's uniform and traveled around college campuses, p*ing bad checks and claiming he was there to recruit stewardesses for Pan Am. At the University of Arizona, he stated that he was a pilot and a doctor. According to Paul Holsen, a student at the time, Abagnale conducted physical examinations on several female college students who wanted to be part of flight crews. None of the women were ever enrolled in Abagnale's fictional program, as his autobiography and film depict.\n\nAfter Abagnale cashed a personal check made to look like a Pan Am paycheck, on July 30, 1970, in Durham, North Carolina, he again came to the attention of the FBI. He was arrested in Cobb County, Georgia, three months later, on November 2, 1970, after cashing 10 fake Pan Am payroll checks in different towns. Abagnale escaped from the Cobb County jail and was picked up 4 days later in New York City. He was sentenced to 10 years in 1971 for forging checks that totaled $1,448.60, and he received an additional two years for escaping from the local Cobb County jailhouse.\n\nIn 1974, Abagnale was released on parole after he had served around two years of his 12-year sentence at Federal Correctional Ins*ution in Petersburg, Virginia. Unwilling to return to his family in New York, Abagnale says he left the choice of parole location up to the court, which decided that he would be paroled in Houston, Texas.\n\nAfter his release, Abagnale stated that he performed numerous jobs, including cook, grocer, and movie projectionist; he was fired from most of those after he was discovered to have been hired without revealing his criminal past. He again posed as a pilot in 1974 to obtain a job at Camp Manison, a summer children's camp in Texas, where he was arrested for stealing cameras from his co-workers. After he received only a fine, he obtained a position at a Houston-area orphanage by pretending to be a pilot with a master's degree. This job had him finding foster homes for the children living at the orphanage. This ruse was eventually discovered by his parole officer, who swiftly removed him from his orphanage work and moved him into living quarters above his own garage, so he \"could keep an eye on him\". His next position was at Aetna, where he was fired and sued for check fraud.\n\nAccording to Abagnale, he approached a bank with an offer in 1975. He explained to the bank what he had done and offered to speak to the bank's staff and show them various tricks that \"paperhangers\" use to defraud banks. His offer included the condition that if they did not find his speech helpful, they would owe him nothing; otherwise, they would owe him only $50, with an agreement that they would provide his name to other banks. With that, he began a new career as a speaker and security consultant. During this time, he falsified his resume to show he had worked with the Los Angeles Police Department and Scotland Yard.\n\nIn 1977, Abagnale gave public talks wherein he claimed that between the ages of 16 and 21, he was a doctor in a Georgia hospital for one year, an *istant state attorney general for one year, a sociology professor for two semesters, and a Pan American airlines pilot for two years. In addition, Abagnale claimed that he recruited female university students as Pan American stewardesses, traveling with them for three months throughout Europe. He also claimed he eluded the FBI with a daring escape from a commercial airline toilet bowl, while the plane was taxiing at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. In 1978, Abagnale told a Honolulu Advertiser reporter that he was familiar with the toilet apparatus, squeezed himself through the opening, swung down through the lower hatch, landed on the pavement, ran across the runway, and hailed a cab. Abagnale claimed he moved the sewage container aside and that no one heard a thing: \"I took off running. I thought they were right behind me. What I didn't know was that the door was spring loaded and when it slammed shut the whole *embly fell back into place. Nobody heard anything because of the engines' roar.\"\n\nHe moved with his wife, Kelly, and their three sons to Tulsa, Oklahoma. His family and he lived in the same house for the next 25 years. After the sons left home for college and careers elsewhere, Kelly suggested that Frank and she should leave Tulsa. They agreed to move to Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nIn 1976, he founded Abagnale & *ociates, which advises companies on secure do*ents. In 2015, Abagnale was named the AARP Fraud Watch Amb*ador, where he helps \"to provide online programs and community forums to educate consumers about ways to protect themselves from iden*y theft and cybercrime.\" In 2018, he began co-hosting the AARP podcast The Perfect Scam about scammers and how they operate.\n\nHe has appeared in the media a variety of times, including three times as guest on The Tonight Show, an appearance on To Tell the Truth in 1977, and a regular slot on the British network TV series The Secret Cabaret in the 1990s. The book about Abagnale, Catch Me If You Can, was turned into a movie of the same name by Steven Spielberg in 2002, featuring actor Leonardo DiCaprio as Abagnale. The real Abagnale made a cameo appearance in this film as a French police officer taking DiCaprio into custody.\n\nVeracity of claims\n\nDuring his many speeches and his appearances on television, Abagnale has alleged many criminal exploits. These include stating that he was wanted in 26 countries, has worked extensively for the FBI, and escaped several times from FBI custody. He also claimed that he cashed over 17,000 bad checks, amounting to US$2.5:million, and worked as an *istant attorney general and a hospital physician. In addition, he stated that he started a fake stewardess trainee program, traveling with them throughout Europe for two months, and logged over three million air miles disguised as a pilot. Almost all of these claims have been refuted by journalists.\n\nIn public lectures describing his life story, Abagnale has consistently maintained that he was \"arrested just once,\" and that was in Montpellier, France. However, public records show Abagnale was arrested in New York (multiple times), California, M*achusetts, Louisiana, Georgia, and Texas.\n\nDespite public records showing Abagnale targeted individuals and small family businesses, Abagnale has long claimed publicly that he \"never, ever ripped off any individuals.\" He made the same claim of never targeting individuals and small businesses to BBC journalist Sarah Montague and the *ociated Press. According to Abagnale, the only individual he ever swindled was a Miami sex worker: \"She tried to charge me $1,000 for an evening, so I gave her a $1,400 forged cashier's check, and got $400 in change.\" In 2002, Abagnale told the Star Tribune, \"As long as I didn't hurt anyone, people never considered me a real criminal, my victims were big corporations. I was a kid ripping off the establishment.\"\n\nIndividuals criminally targeted by Abagnale, however, have described the long-term consequences of victimization:\n\nHe had a key to our front door, it was never recovered. We changed the lock. I fed him. I cooked. I don't trust people as much anymore.\n\n\u2014 Charolette Parks, Abagnale victim interviewed April 27, 1981,\n\nHis claim that he p*ed the Louisiana bar examination, worked for Attorney General Jack P. F. Gremillion, and closed 33 cases, was challenged by several journalists in 1978. No record has been found of Abagnale ever being a member of the Louisiana Bar and no evidence shows he ever worked as an *istant attorney general in Louisiana's Attorney General's Office. In 1978, the Louisiana State Bar *ociation reconciled all those who took the bar exam and concluded that Abagnale never took the exam using his own name or that of an alias; the State Attorney General's Office examined payments to all employees during the time Abagnale claimed he worked there and concluded that he never worked in the office using his name or an alias. After Abagnale appeared on The Tonight Show, then-First *istant Attorney General Ken DeJean gave a reporter a series of questions to ask Abagnale about the description of then-Attorney General Gremillion. Abagnale failed to answer the questions correctly.\n\nThe man is not an imposter, he is a liar.\n\n\u2014 Kenneth C. DeJean, First *istant Attorney General, \"The Great imposter\", April 24, 1981,\n\nAbagnale claimed that when he was 18 years old, he worked for a year as a supervising pediatrician at the Cobb General Hospital in Marietta, Georgia. He maintained that he worked the midnight-to-8 am shift, supervising seven residents and 42 nurses. Abagnale claimed that he would visit the university library to memorize medical journals and textbooks: \"With my photographic memory, I could easily memorize anything. That did not mean that I could comprehend it, but I could rattle it off verbatim.\" Abagnale told his audiences that over the course of his one year at Cobb General, no one doubted his position as a physician: \"So I made the rounds, picked up the clipboards, scribbled a few lines, initialed them, and everyone thought I was doing a fine job.\" However, hospital administrators told journalist Ira Perry that the hospital had no midnight-to-8 am shift, nor did the position of regular overnight pediatrician exist, at the time. Using records from the New York State Archives, author Alan C. Logan demonstrated that Abagnale was in the Great Meadow Prison, in Comstock, New York, when he was 18.\n\nAbagnale's claim that he impersonated a doctor is not entirely without merit, however. On the University of Arizona campus in 1970, he stated that he was a pilot and a doctor. According to Paul Holsen, who was an older university student and licensed commercial pilot at the time, Abagnale informed him that he was there on behalf of Pan Am to recruit and conduct physical examinations on candidates. In his autobiography, Holsen claimed that after Abagnale's ruse was discovered, authorities informed him that Abagnale had indeed conducted physical exams on students. University of Arizona officials acknowledge that Abagnale had interacted with 12 female students. Abagnale has openly acknowledged that he performed examinations on young women while impersonating a doctor: \"When the girls came by, I always gave them a thorough examination and sent them on their way. I was young, but not stupid.\" In 2021, Louisiana State University Manship Chair in Journalism Robert Mann expressed his regret in not confronting Abagnale's claim of conducting physical examinations as a doctor: \"Looking back on my story about the event , I am embarr*ed by what I wrote about Abagnale's time posing as a pediatrician. Reading those words now, in which Abagnale bragged about sexual abuse, makes me sick.\"\n\nAbagnale has publicly claimed an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 140: \"I have an I.Q. of 140 and retain 90% of what I read. So, by studying and memorizing the bar exam, I was able to get the needed score.\" In 2021, Abagnale gave the keynote speech at the American Mensa Conference in Houston. The organizers claimed he was the subject of an FBI manhunt and cashed millions of dollars' worth of checks while impersonating a pilot and doctor. Despite claims of a photographic memory, when queried by USA Today journalist Andy Seiler regarding details of his imposter roles and movements in the 1960s, Abagnale responded by saying, \"You get to a point in your life where you go, 'I don't remember what I did.'\"\n\nOne of Abagnale's most notable claims was an alleged escape from the United States Penitentiary, Atlanta, in 1971:\n\nI was in one of the largest maximum-security federal prisons for two weeks when I impersonated a prison inspector and walked out, right past the machine guns and the guards.\n\n\u2014 Frank W. Abagnale, \"Ex-con tells tricks of trade\", February 22, 1979,\n\nIn 1982, Abagnale told the press, \"I was and still am the only and youngest man to escape from that prison.\" The Federal Bureau of Prisons confirmed, though, that Abagnale was never housed in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary: \"He was never admitted, so I don't really see how he could have escaped,\" said acting Warden Dwight Amstutz.\n\nIn 1978, after Abagnale had been a featured speaker at an anticrime seminar, a San Francisco Chronicle reporter looked into his *ertions. Telephone calls to banks, schools, hospitals, and other ins*utions Abagnale mentioned turned up no evidence of his cons under the aliases he used. Abagnale's response was, \"Due to the embarr*ment involved, I doubt if anyone would confirm the information.\" He later said he had changed the names.\n\nFurther doubts were raised about Abagnale's story after an October 1978 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, with a news article saying:\n\nAbagnale is indeed a convicted confidence artist. But he is finding willing believers as he promotes and invents a more varied criminal past.\n\n\u2014 Stephen Hall,, \"Johnny Is Conned\", October 6, 1978\n\nIn December 1978, Abagnale's claims were again investigated after he visited Oklahoma City for a talk. As part of his investigation into the story, Perry spoke with Pan Am spokesman Bruce Haxthausen, who responded to the journalists' inquiry saying:\n\nThis is the first we've heard of this, and we would have heard of or at least remember it if it had happened. You don't forget $2.5:million in bad checks. I'd say this guy is as phony as a $3 bill.\n\n\u2014 Ira Perry,, \"Inquiry Shows 'Reformed' Con Man Hasn't Quit Yet\", December 10, 1978\n\nIn 2002, Abagnale addressed the issue of his story's lack of truthfulness with a statement posted on his company's website, which said in part: \"I was interviewed by the co-writer only about four times. I believe he did a great job of telling the story, but he also overdramatized and exaggerated some of the story. That was his style and what the editor wanted. He always reminded me that he was just telling a story and not writing my biography.\" However, Abagnale made the primary claims of working as a doctor for a year, an attorney for a year, a PhD professor, and his several escapes on national television in 1977 on the show To Tell the Truth and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, which antedated the 1980 autobiography by several years. He also made these claims in print media, namely the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, three years before the publication of his co-written autobiography, effectively nullifying the claim his aforementioned co-author, Stan Redding, exaggerated the story.\n\nDespite Abagnale's website claim about his autobiography co-author Stan Redding, investigative journalist Javier Leiva discovered an obscure cover story of True Detective (January 1978) in which Abagnale told the story of his life. In True Detective, Abagnale claimed to Redding that he p*ed the Louisiana bar exam, worked as an *istant attorney general, was employed as a sociology professor, worked as an Atlanta pediatrician, escaped from an airplane toilet, escaped from the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, recruited University of Arizona students (and traveled with them throughout Europe for weeks), and cashed $2.5 million in checks. These claims antedate, by several years, the co-aut*d autobiography, and they also demonstrate that it was Abagnale who invented and exaggerated his life story, not Stan Redding.\n\nIn 2002, at the Catch Me If You Can film premiere, Abagnale conceded to journalist Andy Seiler of USA Today that the impersonations in the autobiography were fabricated: \"I impersonated a doctor for a few days, I was a lawyer for a few days. In the book, it's like I am doing this for a year.\" Despite this admission, in public speeches, Abagnale would return to his claims of long-term impersonations of a doctor and for working for a year as an attorney. Abagnale's fees for speaking about his alleged life story are reported to be between $20,000 and $30,000.\n\nIn 2006, KSL journalist Scott Haws challenged Abagnale with his claim that he worked as a PhD-holding sociology professor at Brigham Young University (BYU) for two semesters. Abagnale claimed that he could not recall the details, and that his co-author Redding had exaggerated some things. Haws \"refreshed Frank's memory\" and showed him his own words, including the Catch Me If You Can movie book and the credits that rolled at the end of the film Catch Me If You Can, where Abagnale, not Redding, made the BYU professor claim. Abagnale conceded to Haws that he might have been a guest lecturer.\n\nSo despite claiming to be a sociology professor in at least three books, two solely written by Abagnale himself, and an on-camera claim following the movie, it appears Abagnale as a BYU professor is mostly or entirely just another real fake.\n\n\u2014 Scott Haws, Did Frank Abignale Really Teach at BYU?, April 27, 2006, KSL-TV\n\nLeading up to 2020, author Alan C. Logan conducted an in-depth investigation for a book that focused on the perspective of Abagnale's victims. As part of this process, Logan combined earlier newspaper articles, numerous administrative do*ents, and public records that had not been the subject of scrutiny by major media outlets. Based on these do*ents, Logan provided a timeline that challenged the overall truthfulness of Abagnale's self-described criminal history and movements between 1964 and 1974. Logan maintains that his investigation found that Abagnale's account of his criminal past is, for the most part, a fabrication. Using records from the New York State Archives, Logan showed that Abagnale was in Great Meadow Prison in Comstock, New York, between the ages of 17 and 20 (July 26, 1965, and December 24, 1968) as inmate #25367, the time frame during which Abagnale claims to have committed his most significant scams. Logan's investigation uncovered numerous petty crimes that Abagnale has never acknowledged. Various media outlets have asked Abagnale to respond to Logan's book content, which included victim statements and citations to publicly accessible records. Abagnale has responded by stating that the book is \"not worthy of a comment\".\n\nFriendswood, Texas - arrest photo, 1974\n\nAbagnale has told the press, \"I was convicted on $2.5 million dollars' worth of bad checks\" and that he later hired a law firm to get all the money back to hotels and other companies. Federal court records, though, show that Abagnale was convicted of forging 10 Pan American Airlines checks in five states (Texas, Arizona, Utah, California. and North Carolina), totaling less than US$1,500. Following his parole on February 8, 1974, he claimed he went to work for the FBI, but after this date, Abagnale was arrested for theft at a kids' camp in Friendswood, Texas, on August 29, 1974.\n\nIn many interviews and speeches, Abagnale has claimed that he has earned millions of dollars from his patents. The United States Patent and Trademark Office website, to the contrary, does not list Abagnale\u2014as a person\u2014or Abagnale and *ociates\u2014as a business\u2014as holders of any patents, and neither are listed as an inventor on any patent. In his cheque design patents, Canadian inventor Calin A. Sandru merely mentions in the Background section of the invention that KPMG and Abagnale and *ociates are groups that affirm that cheque fraud is a significant problem.\n\nLogan, girded with public records, shared his findings in detail on the NPR program Watching America, August 13, 2021, broadcast on WHRO.\n\nIn 2022, investigative journalist Javier Leiva independently obtained the public records first sourced by Logan. Leiva also confirmed that Abagnale was in prison between 17 and 20 and then convicted for theft in Baton Rouge in June 1969. Leiva also obtained the federal records connected to Abagnale's Pan Am checks and confirmed that his conviction, at 22 years old, was based on less than $1,500. Leiva says he calculated that between 1965 and 1970, Abagnale was only free for a matter of months and that his records show he was in prison most of that time. On June 23, 2022, Leiva confronted Abagnale at the Connect IT Global 2022 conference in Las Vegas with prison and other public records in-hand. Leiva describes these events in his podcast series Pretend - The Real Catch Me If You Can (Part 1).\n\nRelationship with the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nOne of Abagnale's most controversial claims is his relationship with the FBI. In 1977, when Abagnale began claiming a five-year uninterrupted life on the run, involving multiprofession imposter scams, he did not claim to work for the FBI. He did, however, leverage the names of FBI personnel to bolster his new biographical claims. In 1978, journalist Ira Perry determined that Abagnale and his publicist were giving out the names of FBI agents to any party that asked for references or verification of his claimed biography; in particular, they gave out the name of Robert Russ Franck, whom they claimed was the \"former Atlanta agent\" who knew all about Abagnale. When Perry contacted Franck, who had just retired as head of the FBI's Houston Division, and had never worked in Atlanta, Franck told him:\n\nThat damn Abagnale uses my name all over the place, but I've never even met the guy.\n\n\u2014 Robert Russ Franck,, \"Inquiry shows 'Reformed' con man hasn't quit yet\", December 14, 1978\n\nFranck informed Perry that he had only heard about Abagnale through people attempting to verify his biographical claims, and was unable to confirm whether the claims were true or not. Perry also interviewed Eugene Stewart, a retired FBI agent who was in charge of the Atlanta division when Abagnale claimed he was a pediatrician in suburban Atlanta. Stewart, who at this point was Delta Air Lines chief of security, informed Perry that Abagnale was a low-level criminal: \"It's more of a har*ment than anything else,\" said Stewart. In addition, Stewart noted that Abagnale had been using a Delta Air Lines uniform to cash bad personal checks in Texas after his 1974 parole. After his parole, Abagnale was arrested for theft from a children\u2019s camp in Friendswood, Texas. Public records show that almost two years after his parole, in October 1975, Abagnale was hired by Aetna Insurance, and was abruptly fired by the company after he allegedly cashed bad personal checks during his employee training. Aetna eventually filed suit against Abagnale after his appearance on To Tell the Truth was broadcast in 1977.\n\nAfter the publication of his 1980 autobiography, Abagnale began to inform his audiences that he was on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. He carried this claim into the '90s: \"I was the only teenager in the history of the FBI to be put on their 10 Most Wanted list,\" Abagnale told his audiences in 1994. In the lead up to the release of the film Catch Me If You Can, this \"Ten Most Wanted Fugitives\" claim was used in marketing for the film. Pressed on this claim when the film was released, and with evidence clearly showing the absence of Abagnale on any most wanted list, he conceded on his website that he was never on the FBI's Most Wanted list.\n\nIn 2002, Los Angeles Times journalist Bob Baker (1948\u20132015) reported that no FBI task force was set up to capture Abagnale. Despite his claims that he was living in the infamous Riverbend Apartments, supposedly eluding the FBI for one year as a pediatrician in suburban Atlanta, the newspaper report of Abagnale's arrest indicated he had been in the area for only two days; local FBI agents responded to a tip that Abagnale was in a local hotel and arrested him there. In September 2022, retired FBI Agent Alan Brown obtained permission from FBI headquarters to discuss his arrest of Abagnale. Brown spoke to investigative journalist Javier Leiva and acknowledged that the Atlanta field office simply acted on a teletype request to pick Abagnale up at the Squire Inn, in Marietta, Georgia. In contrast to Abagnale's claims about escaping from the hotel, as depicted in the film, Brown stated that Abagnale was arrested in his room without incident. Brown also stated that he had no personal knowledge of Abagnale's arrests prior to 1970, and after 1970, when Abagnale was arrested in Friendswood, Texas.\n\nIn the years following the release of Catch Me if You Can, Abagnale began claiming that he was granted a unique parole from the federal prison in Petersburg, Virginia, so that he could work for the bureau: \"When the FBI took me out of prison, it was to do undercover work.\" Abagnale has claimed that the clandestine work was given to him directly by Clarence M. Kelley, who directed the FBI from 1973 to 1978. In his \"Talks at Google\" lecture, Abagnale claimed that because of his photographic memory, Kelley asked him to memorize the components of military hardware and infiltrate bases as a lieutenant. Abagnale describes Kelley's instructions this way: \"Okay, you are a lieutenant in the army. You have been in the army this many years. Your expertise is this missile. I need you to learn all of this in two weeks, and I'm sending you to this base, and I want you to find out what's going on in this particular area.\" In the lecture, Abagnale also claims Kelley sent him on similar missions \"as a scientist at a lab in New Mexico.\"\n\nJerri Williams, a retired FBI agent who specialized in white-collar crime and fraud, spoke to investigative journalist Javier Leiva about these claims. Williams rejected Abagnale's claims of being tasked with clandestine operations directly by Kelley:\n\nIf anybody tells you that they got an *ignment directly from the FBI director, right from the head of the FBI, you know for a fact it's bull*. It doesn't happen that way.\n\n\u2014 Jerri Williams, Retired FBI Agent, Pretend Radio, Episode 05\n\nAfter the film was released, Abagnale began to use the first-person plural pronoun \"we\" to refer to the FBI; he also began to inform audiences that he was directly working for the FBI and celebrating each anniversary of his unique parole and the opportunity to go to work at the FBI; for example, in 2006, he informed his audiences, \"this year I am celebrating 31 years with the FBI,\" in 2014, he told his audiences, \"this year I'm celebrating 38 years at the FBI where I work today.\" The dates of this anniversary celebration point to 1976 and do not line up with Abagnale's claim of a parole-release deal. Abagnale was, according to United States Board of Parole and Federal Bureau of Prisons standard practice at the time, sent to a pre-release center in Houston in 1973, within the 120 days prior to his actual federal parole date of February 8, 1974.\n\nIra Winkler, former intelligence *yst for the United States Department of Defense, and current chief security architect for Walmart stores internationally, describes an encounter with Abagnale. Winkler queried Abagnale on the specifics of his position at the FBI. Abagnale responded that he was, \"a special agent\". Winkler says, \"You mean a full-fledged special agent?\", to which Abagnale responded in the affirmative.\n\nIn a 2018 interview broadcast on PBS, Abagnale publicly criticized former FBI director James Comey for his unprofessionalism during the 2016 US presidential election. In the same interview, Abagnale claims that the FBI is concerned that he is of retirement age: \"The FBI always ask me when am I going to retire, because they don't want me to,\" said Abagnale. In interviews, Abagnale has claimed that his work with the FBI is pro bono, although he has claimed publicly that his company has made millions of dollars from contracts with the U.S. government: \"Today, Frank Abagnale and *ociates does $10.5 million of business per year, 90% of it with the federal government,\" he told his audience in 1988. In 1991, Frank Abagnale and his wife Kelly filed for bankruptcy in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In the court filings, Abagnale claimed that he had $1.6 million in debts and $308,000 in *ets.\n\nJournalist Ira Perry was unable to find any evidence that Abagnale worked with the FBI; according to one retired FBI special agent in charge, Abagnale was caught trying to p* personal checks in 1978 several years after he claimed that he began working with the FBI. Dating back to the 1980s, Abagnale claimed that Joseph Shea, an FBI agent, had pursued him for 5 years (between 1965 and 1970). Abagnale claimed that Shea befriended and supervised him during his parole. When Catch Me If You Can was released in theatres, though, The Atlanta Journal-Cons*ution reported that Abagnale and Shea only reunited in the late 1980s, almost 20 years after Shea arrested him. Abagnale spotted Shea at an anticrime seminar in Kansas City and sought out Shea to shake his hand.\n\nWhen the film was released, an FBI spokesperson acknowledged that Abagnale had given lectures at the academy \"from time to time,\" but denied that Abagnale had been given commendations by the agency as claimed in the film's marketing. At no point has the FBI made an official statement corroborating Abagnale's biographical claims, nor has the agency confirmed his extraordinary claims that he was sent into a military base as an expert on missiles, and into a secret lab in New Mexico. Abagnale has claimed in public lectures that he was discussed in detail in a coffee-table book celebrating 100 years of the FBI. However, Abagnale's name does not appear anywhere in the official book celebrating 100 years of the FBI. In his public lectures, Abagnale has taken on a pseudo-spokesperson role for the FBI. In discussing recruitments, he states, \"currently we take 1 in 10,000 applications.\" Abagnale made this same claim of 1 in 10,000 applications to Idaho Statesman journalist Michael Katz in 2019. Overall approximately 11,500 applications per year are made for 900 positions at the FBI (2018 statistics), which is about one in 13 applicants.\n\nIn 2020, Abagnale was confronted by one of his victims in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. When asked why he talks about being an attorney general and p*ing the state's bar exam, and yet failing to acknowledge his arrest and conviction in Baton Rouge, Abagnale said, \"That's because I work for the FBI.\" Abagnale claimed to the Star Tribune that he is an ethics instructor at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia: \"I teach ethics at the FBI academy, which is ironic, but years ago, someone at the bureau said, 'Who better than you to do this?'\u2014I try to teach young agents the importance of doing the right thing.\"\n\nTalks at Google\n\nIn August 2022, Google disabled all comments and added a disclaimer to Abagnale's \"Talks at Google\", which now states: \"Disclaimer: Google does not endorse or condone the content contained within this video, nor does it lay claim to the validity of the actions described herein. The following is presented unaltered as it was recorded on Nov 27, 2017, and remains on the Talks at Google YouTube channel for historical purposes.\" In the video disclaimer Google did not provide an explicit reason for the abnegation of Abagnale's video or whether or not it was part of their new initiative to work with journalists to combat misinformation and disinformation. However, according to investigative journalist Javier Leiva, the move was made in response to members of his audience.\n\nControversy at Xavier and other universities\n\nOn September 12, 2022, Frank Abagnale was awarded the \"Heroes in Ethics\" award by Xavier University, located in Cincinnati, Ohio. Abagnale gave the keynote lecture at the university's annual Heroes of Professional Ethics series. At the conclusion of his talk, Abagnale invited the audience to ask him any questions on any matter. A member of the audience, Jim Grinstead, the host of the podcast Scams and Cons, asked Abagnale, \u201cSo I wonder, in light of the ethics award you\u2019re going to be presented tonight, would you come clean? Would you tell the truth about the stories you\u2019ve told? Will you admit that you just lied to everybody, and you\u2019re still conning them?\u201d In his response Abagnale denied telling any lies or spreading any misinformation. He claimed he had nothing to do with his autobiography, the film, and the Broadway musical. Xavier University has removed any discussion of the September 12 event from its website.\n\nThe incident at Xavier University was not the first time Abagnale's story caused controversy on a university campus. In 1981, after criminal-justice professor William Toney and his students debunked Abagnale's biographical claims, several universities cancelled Abagnale's appearances. In an attempt to provide compromise, the University of South Carolina asked Abagnale to sign an affidavit that would attest to the truthfulness of his biographical claims. The university informed Abagnale that he would still be allowed to give the speech and collect his speaking fee, even if he did not sign the affidavit, but if he refused, the university would warn the students at the outset of the speech that Abagnale had not promised to tell the truth. Abagnale refused to sign the affidavit, referring to the do*ent as a \"slap in the face\".\n\nAs disbelief in Abagnale's story spread, in part due to the work of Professor William Toney, he cancelled his own university bookings. In a letter to Georgia Southwestern State University, Abagnale wrote that it was wrong to profit from his criminal past by speaking about it to college campuses. Furthermore, in the letter to GSSU, Abagnale stated that he was cancelling all college speaking engagements because the criminal aspects of the life story he was presenting \" not something to which young impressionable minds should be exposed\". In the midst of this controversy, Abagnale was queried by journalist John Dagley, who asked him if his biography was a lie, to which he replied:\n\n\"Well, then, I am the world's greatest con man. As one gentleman said to me, 'If you didn't do all those things, and you've made all this money you've made in advances, royalties, and speaking engagements, then you are in fact the world's greatest con man.'\"\n\nPersonal life\n\n\u2014 Frank W.

They have three sons, Scott, Chris, and Sean. Abagnale maintains that meeting his wife was the motivation for changing his life. He told author Paul Stenning that he met her while allegedly working undercover for the FBI when she was a cashier at a grocery store.\n\nBooks\n\nThe Greatest Hoax on Earth: Catching Truth, While We Can , Alan C.

He later impersonated various white-collar professionals, creating an overseas trail, and was arrested at 21 by the French police. Abagnale was eventually hired by the FBI as a consultant and then started his own agency, educating corporations, financial institutions and government organizations on how to detect and handle fraudulence. A portion of his life was the subject of the popular 2002 film Catch Me If You Can.\n\nEarly Life\n\nFrank Abagnale Jr. was born on April 27, 1948, in Bronxville, New York. Much of the information known to the public about his personal history was shared in his 1980 memoir Catch Me If You Can. Abagnale would later say via his website that some of the details in the book were exaggerated, with the preface also stating that certain details of the story were altered to protect other parties.\n\nAccording to the memoir, Abagnale was the third of four children born to parents Paulette Abagnale and Frank Abagnale Sr. The couple met in Algiers during World War II, while Frank Sr. was stationed in Oran, with Paulette still only in her teens when they wed. After the war, the two moved to New York, where Frank Sr. started his own business.\n\nAbagnale would later state that he had a stable childhood and was especially close to his father, who traveled often and became deeply involved in Republican local politics. When his mother decided to leave Frank Sr. due to her husband's absences, the younger Frank's life was turned upside-down. Not only were his siblings devastated, but so was his father, who was still in love with his wife. As his mother worked toward her independence, Frank Jr. decided to live with his father after the divorce, and he often tagged along on business dealings. It was during this time that Frank Jr. learned about white-collar transactions.\n\nCredit Card Schemes\n\nAs a teenager, Abagnale got caught up in petty crimes, including shoplifting. He soon grew tired of these practices, though, and decided to move into more sophisticated forms of burglary. Specifically, Abagnale began using his father's gas credit card to make a tidy profit. Abagnale convinced gas station attendants to give him a portion of his sale back in cash and allowed them to pocket a portion of the proceeds. The scam fell apart, though, when his father got the credit card bill, which added up to thousands of dollars. Unbeknownst to Abagnale, his father was struggling financially.\n\nDismayed over her son's delinquency, Abagnale's mother sent him to a school for wayward boys. Undone by his father's newfound circumstances and caught between his parents' tensions, Abagnale reportedly left home at 16 years old.\n\nAbagnale had little in his bank account and no formal education. Abagnale altered his driver\u2019s license to make himself 10 years older than he was and exaggerated his education. This helped him get better-paying jobs, but he still barely made ends meet.\n\nAbagnale decided to quit working and wrote bad checks to support himself. Before long, Abagnale had written hundreds of bad checks and overdrawn his account by thousands of dollars. Knowing that he would eventually be caught, he went into hiding.\n\nImpersonations Meant to Impress\n\nAbagnale realized that he could cash more bad checks if he dazzled bank tellers with a new, more impressive personality. He decided pilots were highly respected professionals, so he schemed his way into getting a pilot's uniform. Abagnale called Pan American Airlines' headquarters and told them that he had lost his uniform while traveling. HQ told him where to go to pick up a new one, which he did \u2014 and charged it to the company using a fake employee I.D.\n\nAbagnale then learned all he could about flying \u2014 once, by pretending he was a high schooler doing a student newspaper article on Pan Am \u2014 and cleverly forged his own pilot's I.D. and F.A.A. license. His ruse earned him valuable information about how to impersonate a pilot, which he did allegedly in order to hitch rides on planes all across the world.\n\nOnce Pan Am and police began catching on to Abagnale's lies, he decided to change identities again, this time becoming an out-of-town doctor in Georgia. When a local doctor came visiting, Abagnale thought his identity was blown \u2014 but instead, he was invited to visit the local hospital, where he became a regular visitor and purportedly landed a temporary job. Abagnale eventually gave up the gig and left town.\n\nOver the next two years, Abagnale was said to have bounced from job to job. But eventually, Abagnale's past caught up with him when he settled down in Montpelier, France. He had decided to live a straight life for awhile after having reputedly cashed $2.5 million in bad checks over the years. When a former girlfriend recognized his face on a wanted poster, she turned him in to authorities.\n\nJail Time and Consultancy\n\nAbagnale served time in France (reputedly in the harsh confines of Perpignan, where he became seriously ill), Sweden and the United States for his crimes, during which time his father died. Abagnale was eventually granted parole after several years from a Petersburg, Virginia prison. He eventually found lecturing work as a white-collar crime specialist, providing information to bank employees about ways to avoid fraud and theft.\n\nIn exchange for his freedom, the government told Abagnale that he had to educate them about his methods in order to prevent others from defrauding authorities. Abagnale worked with the FBI for more than 30 years as one of the world\u2019s foremost experts on document fraud, check swindling, forgery and embezzlement. He also started his own company, Abagnale & Associates, which educates others on how to avoid becoming fraud victims.\n\nMovie: 'Catch Me If You Can'\n\nIn 2002, Steven Spielberg made a film about Abagnale's life, Catch Me If You Can, based on the aforementioned memoir. Leonardo DiCaprio starred as the famous impostor, with Christopher Walken portraying Frank Abagnale Sr. and receiving an Oscar nod for the role. The movie later inspired a Broadway musical version which ran for several months in 2011 at the Neil Simon Theatre.\n\nUpon the film's release, more questions were raised about what parts of Abagnale's story are true and can be verified. Abagnale has later said that he regrets that the film was made, preferring to have left that part of his life behind.\n\nBooks\n\nAbagnale wrote the books The Art of the Steal (2001) and Stealing Your Life (2007), both about fraud prevention.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nBirth Year: 1948\n\nBirth date: April 27, 1948\n\nBirth State: New York\n\nBirth City: Bronxville\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Frank Abagnale gained notoriety in the United States and overseas for his fraudulent crimes.

A former conman who specialised in impersonation and forgery, he was portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in the 2002 film Catch Me If You Can. His story has also been told as a book, a musical and is drawn upon in TV series White Collar.\n\nAt the age of 16, Abagnale posed as a pilot for Pan Am Airlines in order to wangle free flights. He later pretended to be a doctor, before masquerading as an attorney \u2013 just some of the eight different identities Abagnale claims to have assumed. Throughout this time he became a master forger of cheques, defrauding banks of millions of pounds. He was arrested at the age of 21 in France and spent six months in prison there, six months in a Swedish jail and was then deported to the US (not before he'd escaped from the aeroplane intended to transport him). After serving five years of his 12-year sentence, he was paroled on the condition that he helped the FBI uncover cheque forgers. He has since made a career as a security consultant, working closely with the FBI for almost 40 years, and launching his own company Abagnale & Associates.\n\nAbagnale talks to WIRED about his past life as a conman, identity theft, the criminal opportunities made possible by the web and the efforts made by governments to fight cybercrime.\n\nHow would the technology available today have affected your ability to con people in your early years?\n\nWhat I did was almost 50 years ago and it's about 4,000 times easier today to con people than when I did it. To forge a cheque 50 years ago, you needed a Heidelberg printed press, you had to be a skilled printer, know how to do colour separations, negatives, type-setting... those presses were 90 feet long and 18 feet high. There was a lot of work involved in creating a cheque.\n\nToday, you open a laptop. If you are going to forge a British Airways cheque, you go to their website, capture the corporate logo and put it in the top right corner. You then put a jet taking off in the background and make a really fancy four-colour cheque in 15 minutes on your computer.

Abagnale targeted individuals and small businesses.\n\nHe gained notoriety in the late 1970s by claiming a diverse range of victimless workplace frauds, many of which have since been placed in doubt.\n\nFrank William Abagnale Jr. was born in the Bronx, New York City, on April 27, 1948.\n\nHis mother was an Algerian American who died in November 2014, and his father was an Italian American who died in March 1972.\n\nLet us take a closer look into the life of the Abagnales. This article will keep you glued, thus keep reading till the end.\n\nWhat happened to Frank Abagnale\u2019s parents?\n\nHis childhood was good until his teens when his parents separated and eventually divorced and his father got custody of him. The two moved out of Bronxville together and were very close.\n\nFrank Sr. would often bring him to high-profile gatherings.\n\nSr has been dead since 1972. Although the movie showed him staying in contact with his son, that was just fiction. In reality once Jr left home, they never saw each other again.

There is not much information about Frank Abagnale\u2019s mother.\n\nIn Catch Me If You Can, he runs away when he\u2019s given the choice to live with either his father or his mother following their divorce. In reality, Frank actually lived with his father.\n\nWhen Frank Abagnale\u2019s Parents Divorced\n\nFrank Abagnale, whose life was the basis for the film Catch Me If You Can, once recalled the day he learned that his parents were splitting up.\n\nAt the age of 16, in the 10th grade, his parents, after 22 years of marriage, one day decided to get a divorce. Unlike most divorces where the children were usually the first to know, his parents were very good about keeping that a secret.\n\nWhen he was in the 10th grade, one day his father walked in the classroom one afternoon and asked someone to excuse his from class. When he came out in the hallway, his father handed me his books and told that he would be driven to the county seat in White Plains, New York.\n\nThat was he would meet his parents, and they would explain what was going on.\n\nWhen the Judge asked to choose\n\nFrank remembers he was dropped at the steps of a big stone building and told to go on up the steps where his parents would be waiting for me in the lobby. He remembers climbing the steps, seeing a sign on the building that said \u201cFamily Court.\u201d\n\nBut he really didn\u2019t understand what that meant.\n\nWhen he arrived in the lobby, his parents were not there. But he was ushered into the back of an immense courtroom where his parents were standing before a judge.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t hear what the judge was saying, nor his parents\u2019 response.\n\nBut eventually, the judge saw him at the back of the room and motioned to approach the bench. So, he walked up the stand in between his parents.\n\nHe remembers distinctly that the judge never looked at me. Judge never acknowledged he was standing there.\n\nHe simply read from his papers and said that his parents were getting a divorce. And because he was 16 years of age, he would need to tell the court which parent he chose to live with.\n\nHe started to cry. So, he turned and ran out of the courtroom. Judge called for a 10-minute recess.\n\nBut by the time his parents got outside, he was gone. His mother never saw him again for about seven years until he was a young adult.\n\nContrary to the movie, his father never saw him or ever spoke to him again.\n\nWhat did Frank\u2019s father do?\n\nFrank\u2019s father was living vicariously through his son. He was a struggling small business owner.\n\nFrank Sr. always thought the government was out to get him \u2013 put him out of business. It seemed like no matter how hard he tried or how much effort he put in; success never came.\n\nFrank Sr. was happy to see Frank Jr. \u201clive the high life,\u201d by cheating the system. It was like beating the government at their own game.\n\nWhere did Frank Abagnale\u2019s parents meet?\n\nAccording to the memoir, Abagnale was the third of four children born to parents Paulette Abagnale and Frank Abagnale Sr.\n\nThe couple met in Algiers during World War II, while Frank Sr. was stationed in Oran, with Paulette still only in her teens when they wed.\n\nAfter the war, the two moved to New York, where Frank Sr.\n\nWho is Frank Abagnale?\n\nFrank Abagnale Jr. is an American security consultant, known as one of the world\u2019s most infamous impostors of all time. Between the ages of 15 and 21, he committed frauds, forged checks, and tricked countless people using different identities.\n\nBorn and raised in New York, into a very unsettled business family, Frank struggled with family issues as a kid. His parents divorced when he was 12 years old, and that may have played a major role in shaping him as a high-profile criminal mastermind.\n\nHis first victim was his very own father, who was cheated of more than USD 3,000 by Frank, when Frank was just 15 years old. Following this, he quit school and eventually ended up leading the life of a criminal.\n\nIt is believed that he assumed no less than eight identities in his short career as a fraudster, including that of an airline pilot, a physician, and a lawyer. He was captured thrice, but escaped the first two times, by tricking the authorities.\n\nIn 1974, he was released after serving about five years in prison, on the condition that he would work alongside the \u2018Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019 (FBI) to investigate crimes similar to those that he had indulged in.

In 2017, the number of fraud victims in the US reached 16.7 million, with $16.8 billion lost. For more than 45 years, I've worked with, advised and consulted with the FBI and hundreds of financial institutions, corporations and government agencies around the world to help them in their fight against fraud. But my expertise began more than 50 years ago, in an unusual way: I was one of the world's most famous con artists. While I'm ashamed of what I did as a young man \u2014 cheating, stealing and, along the way, deceiving and hurting people \u2014 I was grateful for the opportunity to turn myself around. My story, which is depicted in my 1980 memoir, \"Catch Me If You Can,\" gave me a wider audience to talk about fraud prevention.\n\nProtect your identity\n\nIdentity theft is the deliberate use of someone else's identity (e.g., name, address, Social Security number, bank accounts) to get money and credit, obtain employment, steal property, falsify educational and other credentials, access healthcare and more.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is when an identity thief drains your bank accounts, takes your property and sells or trades your sensitive information. In 2017, during talk I gave at Google, a young man posed a question that I'm often asked: \"Given all the advancements in computing and technology, isn't it harder for today's criminals to steal your identity than it was back in the 1960s?\" The answer, I told him, is no: It's not harder. In fact, it's about 4,000 times easier today than it was then.\n\nTechnology is the identity thief's best tool\n\nIdentify thieves love technology because it gives them a convenient pathway to the details of your life. Just think about all that's available to you with just a few taps on your keyboard: Credit card reports, bank account numbers and personal and family details. It's all there. You just have to know how to look for it \u2014 and con artists are very good at seeking and finding information. With today's technology, all a thief has to do is go online, give a check-printing service your name and account number, have the checks sent to a post office box and voil\u00e0 \u2014 there goes the contents of your checking account. In the 1960s, when I wrote fake checks under a business' or an individual's name and account number \u2014 in essence, stealing their identity \u2014 I needed a four-color printing press, typesetting equipment and the technical know-how to run those machines. Now all I'd need to do is go to a corporate website, grab its logo and then to a banking website to download its logo. Next, I'd have to make a phone call to the accounts receivable department of the company whose identity I plan to steal and ask for writing instructions so I could ostensibly wire funds I owe them. And just like that, I'd know which bank the company uses and its account number at that bank. Then, I'd go online to access the company's annual report. Lo and behold, now I have a copy of the chairperson's or CEO's signature from the letter at the beginning of the report, which I can put on the checks I created through the miracle of technology. All of it totally authentic to the very last detail \u2014 except that the money isn't mine, and the check is a fake.\n\nDon't use a debit card\n\nWant to avoid identity theft? Never, ever use a debit card. I don't own one. I never have and I never will. I don't recommend them to anyone \u2014 not my family, not my friends, not you. As I said at the Google talk, a debit card is certainly and truly the worst financial tool ever given to the American consumer. Why? It's simple: Every time you use one, you put your money and your bank account at risk. Instead, use a credit card. I use one for practically all of my purchases, even when I'm traveling abroad. With credit cards, federal law limits my liability if there's an unauthorized use of my card. When I use a credit card, I'm spending the credit card company's money every day until I pay my bill at the end of the month. Meanwhile, my money is earning interest in a bank account."}, {"url": "https://thecinemaholic.com/where-was-catch-me-if-you-can-filmed/", "page_content": "Steven Spielberg\u2018s \u2018Catch Me If You Can\u2018 is a biographical crime movie based on the life and criminal exploits of Frank Abagnale Jr., one of the most notorious imposters, who is now a security consultant. It follows Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio), as he breaks the law with his sly tactics and provokes the FBI into conducting a massive search operation.\n\nLeo\u2019s brilliant portrayal of the suaveness with which Frank undertakes illegal adventures is what adds to the appeal of this movie. Constantly on the run, Frank is seen gliding through an assortment of beautiful locations throughout the movie that catches the attention of the viewers. So where was it filmed?\n\nCatch Me If You Can Filming Locations\n\n\u2018Catch Me If You Can\u2019 was initially scheduled to start filming in January 2002 but got postponed to February 7, 2002, in Los Angeles, California. The production wrapped up filming on May 12, 2002, in Montreal, Quebec. Let us get into the specific details!\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\n\u2018Catch Me If You Can\u2019 was primarily shot in and around Los Angeles, California. Frank\u2019s visit to Miami Mutual Bank was shot in Union Station, Downtown Los Angeles. Built in 1939, the majestic rail station oscillates between a public spot bearing the bustle of everyday life and a rare artifact immersed in grandiosity. The Rose City High School, situated at 325 South Oak Knoll Avenue, in Pasadena, is where the school scenes were shot.\n\nCarl\u2019s visit to Mrs. Abagnale\u2019s house and a few other scenes were also shot in Pasadena, California. Specifically, the scenes were filmed at 3077 East California Boulevard. Furthermore, the home of the Strong family is in New Orleans in the movie, but in real life, it is situated at 2186 East Crary Street, near Altadena.\n\nThe Tropicana Hotel, where Frank and Carl (Tom Hanks) share an intense conversation, is the rear portion of Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood, Los Angeles (although Tropicana Bar is a real place). The hotel was established in 1927, and in 1929, it hosted the first Academy Awards. The scene involving Frank and the stewardesses was filmed in the Fine Arts Auditorium of the Ebell of Los Angeles located in Midtown Los Angeles.\n\nThe Miami International Airport shown in the movie is actually Ontario International Airport, which is not in Canada, but in Ontario, California. Glimpses of the FBI offices in the movie were staged in the Boeing-Aerospace Facility in Downey. The Alcatraz Prison on Alcatraz Island, San Francisco Bay, which is located in Northern California, is also featured in the movie. The Bellarmine Jefferson High School in Burbank was also used for filming, as was the Old Orange Courthouse, located at 211 West Santa Ana Boulevard, Santa Ana. Compton and San Pedro also appear on the list of filming locations.\n\nDid you know that the Old Orange County Courthouse on Santa Ana Blvd. was a filming location for popular films like Legally Blonde and Catch Me If You Can?

Kennedy International Airport, called the TWA Building. Similarly, the Washington DC Square is Larkin Park, which is situated in Yonkers. The apartment where Frank\u2019s family shifts is located at Buena Vista Avenue, also in Yonkers. The Chase Bank outlet seen in the film is actually the Brooklyn Borough Hall.\n\nFrank is seen doing his laundry at the Launderland Laundromat, located at 151 Lake Avenue, while Frank lives the high life. Other locations include Jamaica (in Queens) and Manhattan Park Avenue in Manhattan, where filming ensued from April 25 to April 30, 2002. Few scenes from the movie were also shot in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and Orange, New Jersey.\n\nMontreal, Quebec\n\nAs a substitute for all the scenes taking place in France, Quebec is featured. Because of its enormous French population that materialized into French culture with solid roots, Quebec lived up to its standard. With the Notre Dame des Victoires accessorizing the background, the square of Montrichard, where Frank gets arrested, is a fabrication within the confines of Place Royale in Quebec City. The prison where he is afterward sent to is called St-Vincent-de-Paul, situated in Laval. Lionel Groulx Metro Station is also featured. As a whole, the movie was filmed in 147 different locations.\n\nRead More: Movies Like Catch Me if You Can"}, {"url": "https://www.digibiography.com/frank-abagnale-jr/", "page_content": "Frank Abagnale Jr is an American security expert who is regarded to be one of the most infamous fraudsters in the history of.

This was in fact at the age of 16 and 18 . He was able to organize more than 250 journeys, visiting more than 26 countries.\n\nAbagnale disguised himself as an airline pilot to fly all over the world without charge.

A former conman who specialised in impersonation and forgery, he was portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in the 2002 film Catch Me If You Can. His story has also been told as a book, a musical and is drawn upon in TV series White Collar.\n\nAt the age of 16, Abagnale posed as a pilot for Pan Am Airlines in order to wangle free flights. He later pretended to be a doctor, before masquerading as an attorney \u2013 just some of the eight different identities Abagnale claims to have assumed. Throughout this time he became a master forger of cheques, defrauding banks of millions of pounds. He was arrested at the age of 21 in France and spent six months in prison there, six months in a Swedish jail and was then deported to the US (not before he'd escaped from the aeroplane intended to transport him). After serving five years of his 12-year sentence, he was paroled on the condition that he helped the FBI uncover cheque forgers. He has since made a career as a security consultant, working closely with the FBI for almost 40 years, and launching his own company Abagnale & Associates.\n\nAbagnale talks to WIRED about his past life as a conman, identity theft, the criminal opportunities made possible by the web and the efforts made by governments to fight cybercrime.\n\nHow would the technology available today have affected your ability to con people in your early years?\n\nWhat I did was almost 50 years ago and it's about 4,000 times easier today to con people than when I did it. To forge a cheque 50 years ago, you needed a Heidelberg printed press, you had to be a skilled printer, know how to do colour separations, negatives, type-setting... those presses were 90 feet long and 18 feet high. There was a lot of work involved in creating a cheque.\n\nToday, you open a laptop. If you are going to forge a British Airways cheque, you go to their website, capture the corporate logo and put it in the top right corner. You then put a jet taking off in the background and make a really fancy four-colour cheque in 15 minutes on your computer. You then go down to an office supply store, buy security cheque paper and put it in your colour printer."}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/crime/frank-abagnale", "page_content": "(1948-)\n\nWho Is Frank Abagnale?\n\nThe son of a stationery business owner, Frank Abagnale entered the world of crime as a youngster with credit card and check schemes. He later impersonated various white-collar professionals, creating an overseas trail, and was arrested at 21 by the French police. Abagnale was eventually hired by the FBI as a consultant and then started his own agency, educating corporations, financial institutions and government organizations on how to detect and handle fraudulence. A portion of his life was the subject of the popular 2002 film Catch Me If You Can.\n\nEarly Life\n\nFrank Abagnale Jr. was born on April 27, 1948, in Bronxville, New York. Much of the information known to the public about his personal history was shared in his 1980 memoir Catch Me If You Can. Abagnale would later say via his website that some of the details in the book were exaggerated, with the preface also stating that certain details of the story were altered to protect other parties.\n\nAccording to the memoir, Abagnale was the third of four children born to parents Paulette Abagnale and Frank Abagnale Sr. The couple met in Algiers during World War II, while Frank Sr. was stationed in Oran, with Paulette still only in her teens when they wed. After the war, the two moved to New York, where Frank Sr. started his own business.\n\nAbagnale would later state that he had a stable childhood and was especially close to his father, who traveled often and became deeply involved in Republican local politics. When his mother decided to leave Frank Sr. due to her husband's absences, the younger Frank's life was turned upside-down. Not only were his siblings devastated, but so was his father, who was still in love with his wife. As his mother worked toward her independence, Frank Jr. decided to live with his father after the divorce, and he often tagged along on business dealings. It was during this time that Frank Jr. learned about white-collar transactions.\n\nCredit Card Schemes\n\nAs a teenager, Abagnale got caught up in petty crimes, including shoplifting. He soon grew tired of these practices, though, and decided to move into more sophisticated forms of burglary. Specifically, Abagnale began using his father's gas credit card to make a tidy profit. Abagnale convinced gas station attendants to give him a portion of his sale back in cash and allowed them to pocket a portion of the proceeds. The scam fell apart, though, when his father got the credit card bill, which added up to thousands of dollars. Unbeknownst to Abagnale, his father was struggling financially.\n\nDismayed over her son's delinquency, Abagnale's mother sent him to a school for wayward boys. Undone by his father's newfound circumstances and caught between his parents' tensions, Abagnale reportedly left home at 16 years old.\n\nAbagnale had little in his bank account and no formal education. Abagnale altered his driver\u2019s license to make himself 10 years older than he was and exaggerated his education. This helped him get better-paying jobs, but he still barely made ends meet.\n\nAbagnale decided to quit working and wrote bad checks to support himself. Before long, Abagnale had written hundreds of bad checks and overdrawn his account by thousands of dollars. Knowing that he would eventually be caught, he went into hiding.\n\nImpersonations Meant to Impress\n\nAbagnale realized that he could cash more bad checks if he dazzled bank tellers with a new, more impressive personality. He decided pilots were highly respected professionals, so he schemed his way into getting a pilot's uniform. Abagnale called Pan American Airlines' headquarters and told them that he had lost his uniform while traveling. HQ told him where to go to pick up a new one, which he did \u2014 and charged it to the company using a fake employee I.D.\n\nAbagnale then learned all he could about flying \u2014 once, by pretending he was a high schooler doing a student newspaper article on Pan Am \u2014 and cleverly forged his own pilot's I.D. and F.A.A. license. His ruse earned him valuable information about how to impersonate a pilot, which he did allegedly in order to hitch rides on planes all across the world.\n\nOnce Pan Am and police began catching on to Abagnale's lies, he decided to change identities again, this time becoming an out-of-town doctor in Georgia. When a local doctor came visiting, Abagnale thought his identity was blown \u2014 but instead, he was invited to visit the local hospital, where he became a regular visitor and purportedly landed a temporary job. Abagnale eventually gave up the gig and left town.\n\nOver the next two years, Abagnale was said to have bounced from job to job. But eventually, Abagnale's past caught up with him when he settled down in Montpelier, France. He had decided to live a straight life for awhile after having reputedly cashed $2.5 million in bad checks over the years. When a former girlfriend recognized his face on a wanted poster, she turned him in to authorities.\n\nJail Time and Consultancy\n\nAbagnale served time in France (reputedly in the harsh confines of Perpignan, where he became seriously ill), Sweden and the United States for his crimes, during which time his father died. Abagnale was eventually granted parole after several years from a Petersburg, Virginia prison. He eventually found lecturing work as a white-collar crime specialist, providing information to bank employees about ways to avoid fraud and theft.\n\nIn exchange for his freedom, the government told Abagnale that he had to educate them about his methods in order to prevent others from defrauding authorities. Abagnale worked with the FBI for more than 30 years as one of the world\u2019s foremost experts on document fraud, check swindling, forgery and embezzlement. He also started his own company, Abagnale & Associates, which educates others on how to avoid becoming fraud victims.\n\nMovie: 'Catch Me If You Can'\n\nIn 2002, Steven Spielberg made a film about Abagnale's life, Catch Me If You Can, based on the aforementioned memoir. Leonardo DiCaprio starred as the famous impostor, with Christopher Walken portraying Frank Abagnale Sr. and receiving an Oscar nod for the role. The movie later inspired a Broadway musical version which ran for several months in 2011 at the Neil Simon Theatre.\n\nUpon the film's release, more questions were raised about what parts of Abagnale's story are true and can be verified. Abagnale has later said that he regrets that the film was made, preferring to have left that part of his life behind.\n\nBooks\n\nAbagnale wrote the books The Art of the Steal (2001) and Stealing Your Life (2007), both about fraud prevention.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nBirth Year: 1948\n\nBirth date: April 27, 1948\n\nBirth State: New York\n\nBirth City: Bronxville\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Frank Abagnale gained notoriety in the United States and overseas for his fraudulent crimes.

The FBI would not comment.\n\nWhile an FBI agent was looking for him, there is also no proof that the bureau set up a task force dedicated to his capture.\n\nIn fact, Abagnale was arrested again, in 1974, for stealing art and photography equipment from a Texas summer camp where he was working. He was 26.\n\nIn 1982, Toney presented his findings on Abagnale at the International Platform Association, a speakers\u2019 convention in Washington, DC. Others on the schedule included Carl Sagan, David Brinkley, F. Lee Bailey \u2014 and Frank Abagnale, Jr.\n\nBut after getting wind of Toney\u2019s talk, \u201cHow to Catch a Con Man,\u201d Abagnale never showed up.\n\nAccording to records obtained by The Post, Abagnale threatened to sue Toney for libel and slander; Toney filed suit against Abagnale for \u201cdamages.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said he never hurt little people, just went after big businesses,\u201d Parks Campbell, today, said of Abagnale.

When she landed in New Orleans the following day, he was there at the airport.\n\nFor years, Abagnale claimed to have pretended to worked for both TWA and Pan Am \u2014 which Pan Am disputed in a 1982 letter. Provided\n\n\u201cHe was very charming, but he smelled bad,\u201d Campbell told The Post. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t body odor. It was fear.\u201d\n\nWhen he surprised her at four other airports, she began to get uneasy but decided to have him meet her parents in Baton Rouge.\n\n\u201cMy parents and brother fell in love with him,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter dinner, her mother invited Abagnale to return and she\u2019d teach him to fish. But on the ride back to New Orleans, Campbell told him she didn\u2019t want to see him anymore.\n\nAbagnale also has claimed to have talked his way into a job at Brigham Young University, which the school has denied. Provided\n\nA few days later, however, Abagnale popped up at her parents\u2019 door unannounced, telling them he was on furlough from TWA.\n\nThey invited him to stay over \u2014 it ended up being six weeks.\n\nHer parents, a nurse and teacher, treated Abagnale like one of their children.\n\nHe thanked them by rifling through her parents\u2019 checkbooks and getting into the savings accounts of her brother and a family friend, stealing about $1200 from them.\n\nAbagnale, seen here played by DiCaprio, also claimed to have posed as a doctor. \u00a9DreamWorks/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\n\u201cHe said he never hurt little people, just went after big businesses,\u201d said Campbell. \u201cThat\u2019s the one that sticks in my craw. My mama\u2019s heart was broken.\u201d\n\nSoon after, Abagnale sent a mea culpa to the family.\n\n\u201cThere are no words to express how ashamed and sorry I am,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou people have showed me more love in six weeks than I have ever seen in my lifetime. Even though I will go to prison, every cent I owe you will be repaid.\u201d\n\nCampbell, whose parents are long gone, is still waiting.\n\nAlthough Abagnale has claimed to have used the aliases Frank Williams, Frank Adams, Robert Conrad, and Robert Monjo, there\u2019s no evidence he did.

He reiterated that, \u201cEverything I did I did between the age of 16 and 21. I was caught when I was 21.\u201d\n\nThat same month, Javier Leiva, host of The Pretend podcast, which devoted eight episodes to Abagnale\u2019s faux shenanigans, attended a speech Abagnale gave in Las Vegas.\n\nNinety percent of the lecture was about IT security/fraud prevention, but \u201cthe undertone of his false life-story was palpable,\u201d said Leiva.\n\nAbagnale walked on stage to John Williams\u2019 theme song for \u201cCatch Me If You Can,\u201d and elaborated on his alleged check-forging scheme.\n\nAt the end of his email to me, Abagnale asked, \u201cIs 50 years not long enough to receive some redemption for a crime committed when one was a teenager?\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone has a right to a second chance,\u201d said Leiva. \u201cForgiveness is a virtue.

The 2002 movie Catch Me if You Can, about Frank Abagnale Jr.\u2019s mythical life as a master con man was certainly entertaining and convincing. And the film, directed by Steven Spielberg no less, featured a cast comprised of several of Hollywood\u2019s heavy hitters: Tom Hanks, Leonardo DiCaprio, Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, James Brolen and Jennifer Garner, among others.\n\nBut as Logan watched the film and thought something just didn\u2019t seem right. He has written a book about Abagnale called THE GREATEST HOAX ON EARTH: CATCHING TRUTH WHILE WE CAN .\n\nIn early 2020, he wrote a book about medical con man Robert Vernon Spears, who was the prime suspect in a mysterious 1959 commercial airline disaster. He compared Spears, whose story was verifiable to that of Abagnale and found that \u201cnothing was adding up, nothing was verifiable.\u201d\n\nIn his own book, Catch Me if You Can, published in 1980, Abagnale claimed that between the mid-1960s and the early 1970s, he impersonated a pilot for Pan American Airlines, a doctor in Georgia, a professor at Brigham Young University and a lawyer for the Louisiana Attorney General\u2019s office in Baton Rouge and even passed the bar exam \u2013 and cashed bad checks worth more than $2 million in more than 26 countries.\n\nIn his TWA uniform\n\nTrouble is, he was in prison for much of that time and wasn\u2019t paroled until 1974. After his release, he moved to Friendswood, Texas, where he was soon arrested again for theft.\n\nIn more traditional clothing\n\nHe did meet Delta Airlines flight attendant Paula Parks from Baton Rouge (now a resident of Livingston Parish) and while stalking her, befriended her parents \u2013 from whom he stole blank checks from them and wrote $1200 in bad checks.\n\nBaton Rouge flight attendant Paula Parks\n\nAbagnale with Paula\u2019s father, Bud Parks, in the Parks\u2019 Baton Rouge home\n\nAbagnale and Paula\u2019s mom, Charlotte Parks\n\nAbagnale appeared on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson (several times), the Today show with Tom Brokow, and on To Tell the Truth, the only time all three mystery guests lied. But reporters for the San Francisco Chronicle and The Daily Oklahoman picked up the scent of a bogus story and began picking his story apart, piece-by-lying piece.\n\nKen DeJean, First Assistant Attorney General in the 1970s and \u201880s, has also debunked Abagnale\u2019s claim that he posed as a lawyer in that office. \u201cAfter his second appearance on The Tonight Show, I called the producer and tried to set him straight and I talked to a reporter for The National Enquirer, which was planning to do a story on him,\u201d DeJean said. \u201cI gave The National Enquirer reporter a set of questions to ask Abagnale: What did the Attorney General look like? How old was he? How tall was he? Describe our office? What floor (of the State Capitol) is our office on?\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t answer a single question correctly,\u201d DeJean said, adding that the tabloid subsequently killed the story. Abagnale described Attorney General Jack P.F. Gremillion as being in his forties, six feet tall, slim with blonde hair (he was in his sixties, short, portly, and balding).\n\nLikewise, his claim to have been included in the FBI\u2019s 100th anniversary coffee table book turned out to be more of Abagnale\u2019s flim-flam. There is such a coffee table book, but it contains no mention anywhere in it of Abagnale.\n\nThere is plenty information available to show that Abagnale has been running a con about his fictional life as an imposter but apparently no one at LABI bothered to vet him thoroughly before booking him for its seminar.\n\nIt\u2019s apparently a fairly simple process to run a scam if no one\u2019s checking your story.\n\nBut Logan has.\n\nYou might want to check his NEW BOOK before scheduling the next speaker for your organization.\n\nAdvertisement"}, {"url": "https://historycollection.com/catch-can-real-story-frank-abagnale-jr/", "page_content": "Frank Abagnale Jr. is one of the most famous con artists in history. Some say he is the best, although pedants would point out that the best confidence tricksters are the ones you\u2019ve never heard about. Nonetheless, Abagnale led an extraordinary life where he assumed up to eight identities, cashed approximately $2.5 million worth of bad checks (his estimate), and lived a fast-paced life filled with drama and suspense; all by the time, he was 21 years old. The movie \u2018Catch Me If You Can\u2019 is based on his life story, with Leonardo DiCaprio playing the role of Abagnale.\n\nEarly Life\n\nHe was born on April 27, 1948, in New York and his father, Frank Sr., and mother, Paulette, divorced when he was 14 years old. Abagnale was extremely close to his father, and he viewed him as a role model. He used to attend business meetings with his father, and this is where he learned details about business transactions. Despite having a relatively stable childhood, Abagnale soon resorted to petty crimes such as shoplifting. However, he quickly grew bored of it and sought a greater criminal challenge.\n\nIronically, Abagnale\u2019s father was the first victim of his con artist career. When he was 15, he called various gas stations and told the owners to ring him up for merchandise (such as tires), but gave him a cash sum well below the real value of the products. Abagnale used his father\u2019s charge card for the scam for about a month, until his father received a bill for $3,400. What Abagnale didn\u2019t know was that his father was struggling financially.\n\nHis mother sent him to a school for \u2018troubled boys,\u2019 and during that period his father lost his business. Meanwhile, Abagnale left home at the age of 16 and earned just $1.50 an hour for his first job. He believed the low pay was due to his age rather than the lack of a high school degree, so he altered his ID to pretend he was 10 years older.\n\nThe Beginning of a Crime Spree\n\nAbagnale was a master check forger and was apparently the first to exploit the routing of checks via the numbers on the code line. However, he had difficulties at the beginning because the practice of writing bad checks and overdrawing his account only happened for so long before banks demanded payment.\n\nAs a result, it was necessary to use innovative methods of conning people out of money. On one occasion, he took a batch of bank deposit slips, prefilled his account number and placed them back in the stack. The reason? Abagnale noticed that most people left the account number section blank, but the banks always went by the section if it was filled. The next morning, he woke up to find $42,000 in his account.\n\nAbagnale soon realized that he would have more success with his bad checks if he could showcase an air of authority. He knew that pilots were well-respected individuals, so he used his cunning to acquire a uniform. It was here that his career as a con artist quite literally \u2018took off.\u2019"}, {"url": "https://www.crimemuseum.org/crime-library/famous-prisons-incarceration/frank-abagnale/", "page_content": "Frank Abagnale was a famous check-forger, imposter, and con-artist. He committed his crimes primarily between the ages of 15 and 21. He was arrested multiple times in multiple countries, spending 6 months in a French prison, 6 months in a Swedish prison, and finally 4 years in a US prison in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nAbagnale is also famous for his prison escape in 1971. While being transferred into prison by a United States Marshal, the Marshal forgot to give the prison Abagnale\u2019s detention commitment. This struck the administration as unusual, and caused the guards to believe that he was a prison inspector sent by the FBI. Using this information to his advantage he used his phone call to get his friend, Jean Sebring, to forge a business card to back up the story.\n\nSebring used a business card given to her by FBI Agent Joe Shea and altered it to include Abignale\u2019s information. Once delivered to Abignale, he told the guards that he was in fact an inspector sent by the FBI and that he had to get outside of the prison to talk to his fellow FBI agent. The guards laughed and boasted about how they knew all along and were difficult to fool, ultimately allowing Abagnale to leave the facility.\n\nHe was eventually returned to prison to serve four years, but following his release, made an effort to turn his life around. He became an FBI consultant and lecturer and opened his own private financial fraud consultancy company named Abagnale & Associates. He also made an appearance in the movie Catch Me If You Can, which was based on his life. His current net worth is $10 million.

He has been talking in a calm, quick, flawless cadence for more than two hours, flashing his 140 slide projections on a big screen, listing every manner of fraud that could befall these men and women: forgery, embezzlement, bogus checks, identity theft.\n\nAs the litany of scam rises, Abagnale\u2019s pace accelerates even more. He recites the con man\u2019s inner monologues. He acts out dialogues between criminal and victim. He tells the audience which brands of tape, nail polish, laser printer and paper stock crooks employ to forge or alter checks, what Web sites they use to steal someone\u2019s identity, how they look over a shopper\u2019s shoulder to grab critical data, how they take advantage of human naivete.\n\nThis is powerful stuff not merely because of who Abagnale is -- a 54-year-old consultant who pulls in $15,000 per lecture -- but because of who he was: a notoriously creative teenage check forger and impersonator in the 1960s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoured by his parents\u2019 divorce, Abagnale ran away from home in New York at 16 and turned his considerable intellect to passing, by his estimate, $2.5 million worth of bad checks over the next five years. He was motivated at first by the raw craving for money to spend on girls. As he improved the craft of creating counterfeit checks, he assumed a series of trustworthy identities in order to cash them and evade capture: airline pilot, doctor, lawyer, professor. By the time he was 21, the FBI had him. He spent four years behind bars, then began lending his expertise to vulnerable businesses. He wrote one book in 1980 about his cons and another last year about how to avoid being conned.\n\nAbagnale enjoys a high profile within business and law enforcement communities, including the FBI Academy, where he frequently lectures on white-collar crime. But beginning Christmas Day, the young Frank will overtake middle-aged Frank as Leonardo DiCaprio becomes Abagnale in \u201cCatch Me If You Can,\u201d director Steven Spielberg\u2019s comedic dramatization of Abagnale\u2019s teen spree.\n\nThe young Frank would have relished the attention -- the thrill of being the latest non-celebrity lionized by a Hollywood biopic, joining folks like Erin Brockovich, David Helfgott (\u201cShine\u201d), John Nash (\u201cA Beautiful Mind\u201d) and Jim Morris (\u201cThe Rookie\u201d).\n\nThe middle-aged Frank -- the one who tells his audiences that fraud has skyrocketed because of society\u2019s ethical deterioration -- has been wary of the buzz. In September, before he saw a cut of the film, he was so worried studio promotion would glorify his crimes James Bond-style that he disavowed young Frank on his business Web site. (\u201cI consider my past immoral, unethical and illegal. It is something I am not proud of.\u201d)\n\nHe now praises Spielberg and DiCaprio for capturing the sadness and moral quandaries of his youth as well as the manic excitement. Yet he\u2019s still bothered by the idea that he\u2019ll soon be recognized any time he hands his credit card to a hotel reservation clerk. He settled long ago in Tulsa, Okla., where he\u2019s been married for 26 years and is the father of three sons in college. \u201cI like to wash my cars in front of my home on weekends,\u201d he says in a restrained tone that has little trace of New York. \u201cI like to garden. I like doing what I do for a living.\u201d\n\nWith no financial stake in the picture, he\u2019s told Spielberg\u2019s DreamWorks to limit his media exposure, but it figures to be a losing battle. There\u2019s an irresistible conflict between the boy and man, and on this day, in Abagnale\u2019s speech inside L.A.\u2019s exclusive Jonathan Club, that tension resonates with each of his pronouncements.\n\n\u201d Today, 60% of all transactions are still paid by check. The check is king....What many Americans don\u2019t understand is that many of those checks are no good.\u201d\n\nHe was 14 when Mom moved out in 1964. He stayed with Dad, an affluent Manhattan stationery store owner, figuring his father needed his help. Around the same age he became girl crazy and began putting thousands of dollars on his unsuspecting father\u2019s credit card. Three thousand dollars later, he wound up for a time in a school for wayward boys. At 16 he moved out on his own, found that minimum-wage work was insufficient for his social life, and figured he could get paid more if he lied about his age.\n\nHe was prematurely gray, so when he added 10 years to his resume, it worked. But money was still too tight, and he was routinely cashing checks without money in his account, figuring it didn\u2019t matter because he was a kid. Then one day he noticed a group of airline pilots and thought how easy it would be to cash bad checks in pilot\u2019s garb.\n\nIt was a more innocent time, a time when people were far less inclined to ask for your ID, when an airline asked fewer questions of a young man who called to say he\u2019d lost his pilot\u2019s uniform and needed another one. Or a kid who called with questions for his high school newspaper story on pilot procedures and documents. Soon, Abagnale had obtained a Pan Am uniform, forged an airline ID badge and FAA pilot\u2019s license, and was hitching free jump-seat rides across the country and staying in hotels where the crews stayed, cashing bogus checks at banks or airline counters. He started printing his own checks. He compiled a detailed journal of pilot terminology to improve his bluffing, and begged off whenever another pilot offered him a chance to leave the jump seat and take a turn at the controls.\n\nThe same mental agility and charm that make him a riveting public speaker today helped him to quickly adopt new personas and produce new credentials. \u201cWhat also helped me a lot was being an adolescent and having no fear,\u201d he said in an interview, \u201cwhere an adult in the same situation would have analyzed the hell out of it, worrying about the consequences.\u201d Tall, handsome and friendly, he was, by his account, a magnet for attractive stewardesses and always on the lookout for a female bank teller he could innocently chat up for intelligence.\n\nHe had no permanent home. He stayed in motion. Slowing down meant confronting an inevitable ache. \u201cIt was a very lonely life,\u201d he says. \u201cEven though I met all those girls, they all thought I was someone I wasn\u2019t.\u201d The pilot\u2019s uniform made him special, universally liked and respected; he used it, he wrote in his 1980 book on conning, the same way a junkie uses heroin.\n\n\u201cIf you believe you have a foolproof system, you have failed to take into consideration the creativity of fools....There are no criminals looking for a challenge. They\u2019re only looking for opportunities.\u201d\n\nHis refinements in his later teens included buying an $8,000 camera that let him duplicate Pan Am expense checks. He improved on that when he met an Air France stewardess whose father, the owner of a printing shop in France, unwittingly helped Abagnale print bogus Pan Am payroll checks. Sometimes he enriched himself through elemental creativity, like the time he walked into a bank, grabbed a handful of deposit slips, used press-type lettering to insert his own account number in the empty space and returned the slips -- meaning that the people who used them (without noticing the change) were depositing their money in his account. That netted $40,000 in four days, he said.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to forge Transamerica checks, I\u2019m going to make two phone calls -- one to accounts payable, where they\u2019ll give me the account number for wiring instructions and, second, to public affairs, where I can ask for an annual report, which will contain the signature of the CEO.\u201d\n\nAfter a couple of years of the pilot scam, Abagnale said, he spent almost a full year impersonating a pediatrician in Georgia. It started innocently -- he was trying to lie low, and called himself a doctor on an apartment rental application. Neighbors introduced him to a hospital administrator, who asked him to supervise a ward and, unwilling to give himself away, he complied, never having to make a crucial medical decision. Forging credentials subsequently enabled him to pass, for shorter times, as a college professor (he taught sociology) and a Harvard-trained lawyer.\n\nAbagnale said that after passing counterfeit checks in every U.S. state and two dozen other countries, he was arrested in France, served half a year, was extradited to Sweden, served several months there, and was returned to the U.S. He escaped off the plane in New York, returned to Georgia, was arrested by the FBI in an Atlanta suburb, escaped again and was arrested for good in New York a month later. He was sentenced to 12 years in federal prison and served three -- earning his GED and taking some college-level courses -- before being paroled to Houston.\n\nOnce free, he chafed in a series of dead-end jobs. Then, thanks to the suggestion of his parole officer, and with help from the FBI agent who had arrested him in Georgia, Abagnale was steered into consulting jobs with law enforcement. That led to his first private-sector client, Target, and a new career. He got married and, looking for a quieter place to raise children, moved to Oklahoma. His clients have ranged from banks to title insurance companies to high-security printing companies to Australian businesses worried about fraud during the 2000 Olympics.\n\nAbagnale\u2019s gift is \u201chis uncanny ability to look at a [fraud] situation and say, \u2018Well, this is how a person did it and this is what I\u2019d do to make sure nothing like it happens again,\u2019 \u201d said Phillip Desing, supervisory special agent at the FBI Academy\u2019s Investigative Training Division. \u201cHe\u2019s about as close to brilliant as you can get.\u201d Desing said Abagnale has never accepted compensation for his lectures to new and veteran FBI agents.\n\nAbagnale sold his movie rights to a screenwriter in the late \u201870s, but the project traded hands without taking shape. Four years ago it began to jell in a screenplay by Jeff Nathanson (\u201cRush Hour 2\u201d) that eventually attracted DiCaprio.\n\nThat, in turn, attracted DreamWorks film chief and co-producer Walter Parkes. When a late draft of the script made its way to DreamWorks co-owner Spielberg, he told Parkes he\u2019d like to direct. With Spielberg came Tom Hanks to play an FBI agent who pursues Abagnale throughout the film. Hanks\u2019 character is a composite of Abagnale\u2019s parole officer and the agent who arrested him in Georgia, Joe Shea.

He said his confidence in the director\u2019s ability to capture the emotional truth grew when Spielberg volunteered that he too had been a teenager when his parents divorced.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a devastating thing,\u201d said Abagnale, whose father died in 1974 after trying unsuccessfully for years to win back his wife. He is convinced that the departure of his mother, now 75 and living in New York, was the central cause of his teenage rootlessness, a theme the movie hits far harder than his book. The two speak weekly, but \u201cshe knows I\u2019ll go to my grave thinking that....Every child needs its mother, and every child needs its father. I don\u2019t care what people say.\u201d\n\nSuppose young Frank had never veered from the straight and narrow? \u201cI think I would have gone to college. I think I would have been a very successful entrepreneur....Luckily, I was creative and did these things to support myself. But it was always on the run, doing it just to stay ahead.\u201d\n\nHe saw the movie, which claims merely to have been \u201cinspired\u201d by actual events, two weeks ago in Spielberg\u2019s office. \u201cIt was hard for me to take it all in at once. It was so surreal.\u201d\n\nWhat does middle-aged Frank want people to take away from young Frank\u2019s story? \u201cMan, this guy did some incredible things -- but I wouldn\u2019t want it to happen to me.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.caniry.com/what-happened-to-frank-abagnale-and-brenda/", "page_content": "Who does Frank end up with in Catch Me If You Can?\n\nWho was the real person in Catch Me If You Can?\n\nIs Frank from Catch Me If You Can Still Alive?\n\nHow true is the movie Catch Me If You Can?\n\nAbagnale has publicly claimed an Intelligence quotient (IQ) of 140: \u201cI have an I.Q. of 140 and retain 90 percent of what I read.

Then again, anything Frank Abagnale says sounds reasonable.\n\nAfter all, Abagnale is probably America\u2019s best-known con man even though he\u2019s been legit for decades. People still remember \u201cCatch Me If You Can,\u201d the movie about his early life staring Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nAbagnale didn\u2019t just pose as the guy from the electric company at your door to check for faulty wires. He posed as an airline pilot, attorney and physician. He cashed millions in bad checks. Frank Abagnale was so very good at being bad.\n\nNow, Abagnale is an adviser to the AARP, FBI and Better Business Bureau. He writes books, has a podcast and he speaks to federal agents at places like Huntsville\u2019s new FBI center. AARP brought him to Huntsville this month for a free talk about modern scams, and 1,000 people registered to attend.\n\nAbout those two red flags: Remember, they sound obvious. But a lot of people fall for them every year. The real number of victims is unknown, because who wants to admit falling for these things?\n\nRed Flag No. 1: \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you for money,\u201d Abagnale said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to send me money. You\u2019ve got to do this right away. You\u2019ve got to pay this or pay for this right away.\u201d\n\nRed Flag No. 2: \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you for information. Where do you bank? What\u2019s your Social Security number? Can you give me your date of birth?\u201d\n\nAgain, it sounds obviously wrong. But it doesn\u2019t happen in one phone call, necessarily, although it can. You can find out on the phone that you\u2019ve \u201cwon\u201d a sweepstakes and need to act now to claim your winnings. But frequently, the con artist takes time to build a relationship. Maybe with an older woman. It\u2019s called a \u201cromance scam,\u201d Abagnale says.\n\n\u201cMy husband died several years ago,\u201d Abagnale says, slipping into character as the victim. \u201cHe\u2019s a very nice gentleman. This has been going on for six months. We talk on the phone every night. He emails me all the time, sends me pictures.\u201d\n\nFinally, the woman says, \u201cIf you only live two states away, how come you don\u2019t come see me?\u201d\n\nBut the gentleman caller can\u2019t come. He needs an operation. It costs $30,000. The \u201ctruth\u201d is, if he doesn\u2019t get it, he\u2019s probably going to die.\n\n\u201cWell, I could give you money,\u201d the woman says.\n\nGame, set, and match.\n\n\u201cThe relationship was great until money entered into it,\u201d Abagnale said. \u201cAgain, this is someone you\u2019ve never met. You didn\u2019t solicit them. They solicited you. You have to stop and say, whoa, whoa, before I start giving money to someone I\u2019ve never met and don\u2019t know.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just a story spun by Frank Abagnale. It happened. The man wasn\u2019t \u201ctwo states over.\u201d He lived in Greece. He\u2019d never been out of Greece.\n\nAbagnale has other stories about Jamaican gangs - they\u2019re a major force in worldwide cons today - and \u201cyou\u2019ve won a sweepstakes\u201d cons. The sad part is many older people won\u2019t admit they\u2019ve been taken by scams like these, he said. They fear the kids will say this proves Mom can\u2019t handle her money. They need to take over. Independence is gone.\n\n\u201cYou really can\u2019t rely on your bank, rely on the government, or rely on the police you protect you,\u201d Abagnale said. \u201cYou have to be a smarter consumer and a smarter businessperson than you did 50 years ago. You\u2019ve got to be sure you think things through. If you\u2019re not sure, share it with someone.\u201d\n\nAnyone can be scammed, Abagnale said. Two former FBI administrators have admitted on Abagnale\u2019s podcast that they\u2019ve been scammed, he said. A former editor of Time magazine admitted he\u2019d been scammed.\n\n\u201cAnybody can be scammed,\u201d Abagnale repeats, \u201cbut if your scammed, you need to share it with someone. The police can\u2019t do anything if they don\u2019t know about it.\u201d\n\nOne last bit of advice:\n\n\u201cPeople ask me, \u2018How do they know the man in this house is 82 years old\u2019?\u201d Abagnale said. \u201cBecause when you and I were kids, you went to the White Pages and all it told you was the name, address and phone number.\u201d\n\nToday, he said, telephone number websites also offer relatives\u2019 names, the ages of occupants at the address, the ZIP code and other information. ZIP codes are practically maps to affluent districts, Abagnale said.\n\n\u201cPeople think, well, (the call) must be legit,\u201d Abagnale said, \u201cbecause how did they know I\u2019m 79 and live here?\u201d\n\nAnd the scam is on."}]}
