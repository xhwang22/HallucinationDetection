{"Johannes Andreas August Grabau was a geologist and paleontologist.": [{"url": "http://concordiahistoricalinstitute.libraryhost.com/repositories/2/resources/1031", "page_content": "Johann Andreas August Grabau was born 18 March 1804 in Olvenstedt, Saxony, in the Kingdom of Prussia, the son of Johann Andreas Grabau (d. 1822) and Anna Dorothea Grabau n\u00e9e Jericho. J.A.A. Grabau had a brother John and a sister Lisette. He was married in Erfurt on 15 July 1834, to Christine Sophia n\u00e9e Burgraf, the daughter of Johann Andreas Burggraf and Friedericke Louise Elizabeth n\u00e9e Beulke. They had at least three children: Johann (pastor in Bergholz, New York), Wilhelm (married Maria von Rohr, pastor in Cedarburg, Wisconsin), and Beata (whose married name was Gram). Grabau died on 2 June 1879 in Buffalo, New York.\n\n\n\nGrabau was educated at the grammar school in Olvenstedt (1809-1818), the Magdeburg Gymnasium (1818-1825) and finally at the University of Halle (1825-1829). After three years as a teacher in Magdeburg and Sachsa bei Nordhausen, Grabau was ordained and installed as pastor of St. Andrew\u2019s Church in Erfurt in June 1834.\n\n\n\nIn 1836 Grabau ran afoul of the Prussian state church for his opposition to the Union Agenda. After two years\u2019 imprisonment (1837-1839), Grabau was finally granted permission to emigrate along with his congregation. This group, under the leadership of Grabau and Captain Heinrich von Rohr, departed for America in the summer of 1839. Grabau and a majority of his congregation settled in Buffalo while von Rohr and some of the families continued to Wisconsin. In Buffalo the settlers established Trinity Old Lutheran Church, quickly followed by the founding of a school.\n\n\n\nGrabau and his congregation soon met with controversy, however. First was a split with a congregation of Silesian Lutherans who had accompanied Grabau\u2019s congregation across the Atlantic. While the Silesian pastor, Leberecht Friedrich Ehregott Krause, was in Germany, Grabau excommunicated the Silesians because of an unsettled debt to the shipping agent who had arranged their passage. The Silesians denied Grabau\u2019s authority in the matter, but Pr. Krause, who passed through Buffalo again in 1841 on his way to take up a call to Wisconsin, sided with Grabau. The Silesians approached the Saxon pastor E.M. B\u00fcrger [Buerger] who was passing through Buffalo at the time, intending to return to Germany, and B\u00fcrger, having investigated the situation, finally accepted their call and became the pastor of the congregation, known in distinction from Grabau\u2019s as First Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church.\n\n\n\nRelations between Grabau\u2019s group and the Saxon Lutherans in Missouri had already been placed on a shaky footing by Grabau\u2019s 1840 Hirtenbrief, a letter which he had written in response to the situation of the emigrants who had traveled with von Rohr to Freistadt, Wisconsin. In the absence of a pastor, they had appointed a schoolteacher to preach and administer the sacraments among them, a practice of which Grabau strongly disapproved. Grabau sent a copy of the Hirtenbrief to C.F.W. Walther and G.H. Loeber. The Missouri pastors disagreed with Grabau\u2019s teaching but were not able to send a response until 1843. An increasingly acrimonious exchange between the two groups continued for several decades, providing impetus for Walther\u2019s Voice of our Church on the Question Concerning the Church and the Ministry. The gap between Grabau and the Saxons widened further as portions of the Wisconsin congregations in Freistadt, Milwaukee, and Kirchhayn, offended by Pr. Krause\u2019s liberal use of excommunication, sought Saxon pastors to serve them.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Grabau proceeded with the work of church organization. In 1845 the Synod of the Lutheran Church Emigrated from Prussia [Synode der aus Preussen ausgewanderten lutherischen Kirche] was formed by Grabau, von Rohr (who had in the meantime been trained and ordained as a pastor), Krause and Pr. G. A. Kindermann, a Pomeranian whose congregation had emigrated to Wisconsin. Grabau was elected senior ministerii or president of the synod, popularly known as the Buffalo Synod. The synodical paper, Kirchliches Informatorium, was established in 1851 under Grabau\u2019s editorship. In 1853/4 the Synod established the German Martin Luther College in Buffalo with Grabau as its rector.\n\n\n\nIn 1866 a schism arose within the Buffalo Synod itself. At the synodical assembly in June of that year, a majority of the Buffalo pastors, including von Rohr, turned against Grabau, accusing him of false doctrine. Grabau and three pastors withdrew, claiming to constitute the legitimate Buffalo Synod. In November von Rohr and his fellow pastors agreed to a colloquium with representatives of the Missouri Synod. As a result of this meeting, a majority of the Buffalo Synod pastors, under the leadership of Pr. Christian Hochstetter of Buffalo, joined the Missouri Synod at once. A rump group, under von Rohr\u2019s leadership until his death in 1874, continued to constitute a separate Buffalo Synod until 1877.\n\n\n\nGrabau continued as pastor of Trinity Old Lutheran Church in Buffalo and as president of the Buffalo Synod, which consisted of Grabau and those pastors who had refused to join in the condemnation of 1866. After a legal battle with von Rohr\u2019s Buffalo Synod, Grabau retained control of the Martin Luther College in Buffalo and remained as its rector. The official organ of Grabau\u2019s synod after 1866 was Die Wachende Kirche, under his editorship. He continued in these responsibilities until his death on 2 June 1879."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/johannes.grabau/3766575", "page_content": "Johannes Grabau\n\nclergyman\n\nMarch 18, 1804 (age 75) Stadtkreis Magdeburg, Sachsen-Anhalt, Germany\n\nAfter teaching for four years in Magdeburg and Sachsa, Grabau was elected pastor of St. Andreas in Erfurt March 3, 1834, and was ordained June 17, in the Barfiisser Kirche. In 1836, he announced that as a strict Lutheran he could no longer use the Union liturgy, and when his superiors failed to persuade him he was deposed from office and forbidden to enter his church. He conducted services in private houses in defiance of the authorities until he was arrested March 1, 1837, and imprisoned at Heiligenstadt. In September, he escaped. With his rescuer, Capt. Heinrich K. G. von Rohr, who had been dismissed from the Prussian army for opposing the Union, he made his way about the country visiting sympathizers as far away as Stettin. On September 21, 1838, he was captured and remanded to prison. Finally, he received permission to emigrate; Von Rohr gathered a company of one thousand with Grabau as their pastor, and in June and July 1839, they sailed from Hamburg in five ships. Grabau and the greater part of the company settled in Buffalo in October. There he was pastor of the DreifaltigkeitsKirche for almost forty years. In 1840, with Von Rohr as his first pupil, he opened a school, later known as Martin Luther Seminary, to train candidates for the ministry. On July 15, 1845, Grabau, Von Rohr, and three other clergymen met at Milwaukee and organized the Synod of the Lutheran Church Emigrated from Prussia, which soon became known as the Buffalo Synod. In 1853-54, he and Von Rohr visited Germany to confer with Wilhelm Lohe on matters of doctrine. From 1842 until 1866, he carried on a fierce controversy with C. F. W. Walther and other theologians of the Missouri Synod on the subject of ordination, the ministry, and the church. The Missouri Synod made the controversy into a war of extermination against Grabau and his followers, set up rival congregations and rejoiced when the Buffalo Synod split into three factions in 1866. The largest faction, consisting of Christian Hochstetter and eleven other pastors, promptly allied themselves with the Missourians; Von Rohr continued at the head of his party until his death in 1874; and Grabau, with a few pastors still loyal to him, kept open his seminary, started a new paper, Die Wachende Kirche, to take the place of the old Informatorium, which remained in Von Rohr\u2019s possession, and was elected Senior Ministerii of the new Buffalo Synod.

His fluency in German proved later to be an asset in his drive to bring advanced concepts in sedimentology and stratigraphy to American classrooms. In particular, Grabau was strongly influenced by the German geologist Johannes Walther (q.v.), to whom in 1913 he dedicated his textbook, Principles of Stratigraphy. A correspondence course in mineralogy from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology started Grabau's formal education in geology. He graduated from that institution with a BS degree in 1896. Grabau earned his MS and DSc degrees from Harvard University in 1896 and 1900, respectively. His subsequent career may be divided into an American phase from 1900\u20131919, when he was associated principally with Columbia University, and a Chinese phase from 1920\u20131946, when he held joint appointments at the National University of Peking (now Beijing University) and the Geological Survey of China. Grabau remained in China during the Second World War and died in Peking, March 20, 1946. His gravesite and memorial is located on the campus of Beijing University.\n\nRegarded overall as a stratigrapher and paleontologist, Grabau's impact on sedimentology came during his early career through various attempts to devise a comprehensive classification scheme for sedimentary rocks. The most detailed treatment occurs in Principles of Stratigraphy in a single 30-page chapter out of a total text of 1,185 pages in 32 chapters. Grabau divided all rocks into two groups: exogenetic as opposed to endogenetic. He defined exogenetic rocks as those formed by agents acting from the outside to break down pre-existing materials. Endogenetic rocks were classified as those formed by agents acting from within, for example precipitation of minerals from solutions. Essentially, his dichotomy corresponds to clastic and nonclastic rocks. In an earlier 1911 paper, Grabau stressed that after the question of origin, texture was the next most important consideration. He applied the terms rudaceous, arenaceous, and lutaceous to clastic particles that range in size from boulders to clay. Other terms coined by Grabau, such as calcirudytes, calcarenytes, and calcilutytes still are used for various grades of bioliths, or limestones. Derivation of new terms from classical roots was a proclivity of Grabau's. In a state of mild exasperation, Joseph Barrell (q.v.) offered a written response to an abstract by Grabau on the classification of marine deposits, suggesting that English terms \u201cperfectly clear and quite as sharp\u201d might be used in place of those derived from Greek. As an example, Barrell preferred \u201cshallow-sea deposits\u201d for the \u201cThalassigenous deposits\u201d proclaimed by Grabau (1913).\n\nGrabau's lasting influence was as a compiler with an encyclopedic mastery of materials and concepts. To regard his massive Principles of Stratigraphy as a textbook devoted strictly to the study of layered rocks would be a gross under estimation. His command of the topic was expansive, as indicated by the array of contents in separate sections on the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, pyrosphere (on volcanism), and centrosphere (on internal earth dynamics). Grabau's outlook was entirely holistic and careful examination of the contents of Principles of Stratigraphy reveals that well over half the book is devoted to topics closely allied with sedimentology. Individual chapters, for example, deal with evaporites, eolian deposits, fluvial deposits, swamp deposits, reef and algal deposits, and deep-sea deposits. His handling of stratigraphy in the broadest sense, was thus prescient of contemporary texts that combine the studies of sedimentary environments and stratigraphy. Grabau (1917) may have shown his ultimate passion, however, with the prediction that \u201cIn future, the study of lithogenesis must go hand in hand with the study of paleogeography.\u201d"}]}
