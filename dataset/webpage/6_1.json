Greek immigrants established the Pan-Hellenic Soccer Club in 1957. The club's first game was played on 20 October 1958, when it defeated St Clair 26-0 at Parramatta Stadium. In its first season, it finished second out of eight teams with 17 points from six matches to secure a spot in the new national league competition.\n\nThe club's first match in the new national league system was on 23 March 1959, when it lost 1-4 at home to Eastern Suburbs. It was one of three new clubs competing that year, along with Melbourne Croatia and Perth City. Sydney Olympic competed in the Australian National League (NSW Division) until 1970, when they dropped down a level to play in the New South Wales State League. In 1971, they returned to the top division but were relegated back down a level two years later. They have remained there since then, except for an interim return to the top division in 1977.\n\nIn 1978, Olympic won their first and only championship title. They repeated this success in 1979, taking out the double. The 1980s saw the club struggle against financial hardship, with several seasons including the 1982 and 1983 campaigns where they had to apply for protection from bankruptcy.\n\nWhen did Sydney Olympic FC change their name?\n\nThe club changed its name to Sydney Olympic in 1977 and became a founder member of the Phillips Soccer League, subsequently renamed the National Soccer League (NSL), Australia's first national football league, which it remained a part of until its collapse in 2004. The club then entered the new Australian Super League before withdrawing in 2005 when financial difficulties prevented it from continuing.\n\nOlympic initially played its home games at Blacktown Stadium but later moved to Marconi Stadium after it was rebuilt. The club won the NSL championship in its first season under its current name.\n\nWhere is the Melbourne City football club located in Australia?\n\nMelbourne City Football Team is a professional soccer club headquartered in Cranbourne East, Melbourne, Australia, that competes in the A-League, the highest level of Australian football, under a Football Australia license. The team was founded in 2011 as a successor to the Melbourne Heart FC franchise.\n\nCranbourne East is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 21 km east of the CBD. At the 2016 Census, Cranbourne East had a population of 7,409 people living in 3,175 households.\n\nThe suburb is served by three public primary schools: Cranbourne East Primary School, St Andrews Memorial Church Of England Primary School and St Mary's Catholic College. It also has two public secondary schools: Cranbourne East Secondary College and Monash University Cranbourne Campus. There are also several private schools in the area including Melbourne Grammar School, Saint Joseph's College, St Kevin's College and Trinity College (Australia).\n\nCranbourne East residents have access to the main campus of the University of Melbourne, which is within 15 minutes' drive of the suburb. Other universities with campuses in the area include Deakin University, Edith Cowan University, La Trobe University and the Victorian Institute of Technology.\n\nMelbourne City plays its home games at Melbourne Rectangular Stadium on Abbotsford Road in Montmorency.\n\nWhen was the Sydney Football Club established in Australia?\n\nSydney Football Team (FC) was founded in 2004 as the first Hyundai Australian-League (A-League) club to represent Australia's largest metropolis. The team is owned by Delaware North, a major provider of hospitality services across Australia. The company also owns and operates other sports teams including the Sydney Swans in the AFL and the Newcastle Knights in the NRL.\n\nSydney FC played its first match on October 8, 2004, when it hosted Melbourne Victory at Allianz Stadium. The team's first win came one day later when it defeated Perth Glory 2-1. Sydney has not lost since its inaugural game against Melbourne Victory.\n\nThe club finished its first season at the top of the table with 11 wins, 1 draw, and just 4 losses. Its goal difference of +7 was the best in the league. In the final series of matches, Sydney was challenged by Adelaide United but was able to defend its title with a 3-0 victory over the Reds. This feat made Sydney the first new team to win the championship since 2003-04 when Melbourne Victory claimed its second title.\n\nIn 2005, Sydney FC repeated its success from the previous season by winning the Premiership again.\n\nWhere is the oldest soccer club in Sydney?\n\nWe are the oldest club in western Sydney, and we are based in Belmore Park, North Parramatta. We have openings in our all-age men's, over-35 men's, and under-15 and under-16 boys and girls' teams. The season begins.... In late January for us.\n\nThe origins of football in Australia can be traced back to 1866, when a game called \"soccer\" was introduced to Sydney by a group of Englishmen. It became so popular that many schools were playing soccer before they were even thinking of cricket. The first official match of what is now known as Australian rules football took place on 20 April 1867, when Melbourne University played Richmond College in Victoria. However, it wasn't until much later that other clubs outside of Melbourne began to emerge. The first non-Victorian club was formed in 1872, by students at the Royal Military College, Duntroon. The original members came from across Australia but mainly from New South Wales and Queensland - states where association football has always been more popular than cricket.\n\nAfter the introduction of American football in 1865, sports such as rugby union, cricket, and baseball began to dominate the cultural landscape, leaving little room for other games to develop. It was only after these established sports had been played for several years that soccer started to gain popularity again.\n\nWhere is Sydney FC based?\n\nAustralia, Sydney Locations/Sydney FC was founded in 2005 as one of eight new teams who joined the Australian Football League (AFL). The team is based at Allianz Stadium, which they share with rugby league side Sydney Roosters.\n\nSydney FC play in the AFC Champions League and have reached the group stage on three occasions (2011, 2014, 2015). They also played in the OFC Club Championship but were eliminated by Melbourne Knights in the quarter-finals in their first season.\n\nThe club's home ground is Allianz Stadium, located in Sydney's eastern suburb of Leichhardt. The stadium has a capacity of 20,000 people and was built for the 2000 Olympics. It is owned by the New South Wales Government and is operated by the same company that runs Olympic Park Stadium. The main sponsor of the club is Chinese beverage manufacturer Dalian Wanda.\n\nHow big is Sydney FC's fan base?\n\nAccording to the club, 70% of tickets sold for their home games are bought by local fans. In addition, over 75,000 people went to see them play during their first season in the AFL."}, {"url": "https://betsapi.com/t/78650/Sydney-Olympic", "page_content": "Sydney Olympic Football Club is an Australian semi-professional soccer club, based in Belmore, Sydney, New South Wales, that plays in the National Premier Leagues NSW.

However, it was not until the 1950's and 1960's following the influx of immigrants post World War II that things began to ramp up within the states.\n\nFollowing the successful qualification of the Socceroos to the 1974 FIFA World Cup, a meeting in April 1975 at St George Soccer House in Mortdale between a number of delegates brought things together and accelerated the idea of a national division, and in collaboration with the Australian Soccer Federation (ASF), by 1976 the initial fourteen teams to compete in the National Soccer League were announced.\n\nOn the weekend of April 2-3, 1977, the competition to be known as the Philips Soccer League began with:\n\n- Eastern Suburbs-Hakoah (NSW)\n\n- St George (NSW)\n\n- Marconi (NSW)\n\n- Sydney Olympic (NSW) - who changed from Pan Hellenic\n\n- Western Suburbs (NSW)\n\n- Canberra City (ACT)\n\n- Brisbane City (QLD)\n\n- Brisbane Lions (QLD)\n\n- Adelaide City (SA)\n\n- West Adelaide (SA)\n\n- Fitzroy United (VIC)\n\n- Footscray JUST (VIC)\n\n- Mooroolbark (VIC)\n\n- South Melbourne (VIC)\n\nThe initial year of the NSL saw the Champion - Eastern Suburbs - crowned after finishing top of the table at the end of the season, but in 1978 a Finals Series was introduced, which went through a few variations, and was not used to determine the Champion team for the time being.\n\nIn 1984 the biggest change was made with the introduction of a Two Conference format, with a top five Finals Series for each conference. The Champion was then determined by the finals system. Under that format, the clubs were increased to 24, and divided into an Australian and National Conference, later called the Northern and Southern Conferences.\n\nThe Finals Series winners of each conference then met in a national Grand Final to determine the Champion. The dual-conference format was scrapped at the end of the 1986 season.\n\n1987 saw the return of a single-conference format and a top five Finals Series, which was continued in 1992-93 when it was expanded to a top six. The 1987 finals did not count for the Championship, but the Champion-deciding finals series returned in 1988.\n\nThe competition was initially played in winter, but in 1989 it was switched to a summer competition to make better use of grounds, and utilising the warmer weather and night matches to attract more families to games.\n\nThe league saw an instant boost in average crowd attendances, and in the year 2000 had a record attendance of 43,242 in the Grand Final between Perth Glory and Wollongong Wolves.\n\nHowever, a number of issues including financial problems forced the NSL to finish at the end of the 2003-04 season, replaced in 2005 by the A-League following the name-change of the Australian Soccer Association (ASA) to Football Federation Australia (FFA).\n\nPerth Glory were the last winners of the NSL."}, {"url": "https://www.sbs.com.au/sport/article/former-nsl-giants-now-making-their-mark-in-the-womens-game/2zhxwznkc", "page_content": "Founded within three years of each other in the mid-1950s, the two Sydney clubs have experienced almost every ebb and flow of the competition\u2019s ever-changing landscape: the New South Wales First Division in the 1960s and 70s, the National Soccer League boom of the 80s and 90s, through to the eventual decline of the top-flight competition in the early 2000s and the establishment of the A-League and National Premier Leagues in the 15 years since.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey\u2019ve won multiple titles in multiple competitions across multiple decades. They\u2019ve produced and provided platforms for some of Australian football\u2019s biggest names including Mark Bosnich, Charlie Yankos, Rale Rasic, Brett Emerton, Robert Hooker, Ante Milicic and Tim Cahill. And nestled just a stone\u2019s throw away from each other in Sydney\u2019s inner western suburbs, both clubs have developed a rivalry that continues to colour their modern-day match-ups \u2013 including a famous tie that decided the 2018 NSW NPL Championship.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s this history \u2013 now deeply woven into the fabric of Australian football \u2013 that makes both clubs\u2019 recent moves into the women\u2019s game all the more exciting. For the first time, both Sydney Olympic and APIA Leichhardt will be fielding senior women\u2019s teams in the state\u2019s premier women\u2019s competition \u2013 National Premier League Women\u2019s 1 \u2013 for the re-jigged 2020 season. While they will face each other as opponents on the field, the rise of both clubs in the women\u2019s space has been remarkably similar. Olympic and APIA fielded their first women\u2019s teams roughly a decade ago \u2013 both of them starting in the state\u2019s third division \u2013 but it\u2019s only in the last five years that both programs have accelerated thanks to greater investment from clubs and sponsors, reflecting the increased momentum women\u2019s football has been generating globally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOlympic started their women\u2019s program in 2011,\u201d recalls current Olympic head coach, George Beltsos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere were three divisions back then: NPL1, NPL2 and state league, which was the lowest. We started there. In my first season, Enzo [Calabria, former head coach] signed everyone that trialled because he was worried about not having enough numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe support for women\u2019s football when we first started came mainly from family members and volunteers who had daughters playing. No women were paid to play then. But attitudes changed a few years ago as our women\u2019s program started to taste some kind of success.\n\n\u201cA new board took over the club \u2013 Bill Papas, Damon Hanlin and new CEO John Boulous \u2013 and for the first time, they made funds available to reward our players for their efforts. Now, the girls get what the boys get, nothing less.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn 2018, we won the Premiership and Championship double and finally got promoted to NPL1. This enabled us to attract more quality players that wanted to play at the top level, but also play for the biggest club in NSW. We managed to finish second in our first season and played some enjoyable football.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI would say ethnic background clubs never looked at women\u2019s football before because of the stereotype of how football was for men, but that has all changed now. You look at these clubs such as Olympic and we are proof that isn\u2019t the case anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe quality of women\u2019s football in the past few years has come on in leaps and bounds, and you can arguably say that our Matildas at the moment are in a much better place than our Socceroos are. It\u2019ll get even bigger with the Women\u2019s World Cup being held here in 2023. The sky is the limit. I\u2019m hoping to see and help some of our Olympic players be in that squad \u2013 that would be a dream come true for them and for me.\u201d For Kalisa Tsoupis, former Olympic captain and current first-grade women\u2019s manager, the biggest changes haven\u2019t just been financial. There has been a noticeable culture shift at the club as women\u2019s football has grown in interest and legitimacy, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c[In 2011], I felt like the women\u2019s program was just an add-on. It wasn\u2019t seen as an equal component to the club as the men\u2019s division. Yes, we weren\u2019t in the [National] Premier League, but we were still part of the club. In the early years, we had no season launch or presentation of our jerseys. I feel like because Olympic has only ever had a men\u2019s team and been very successful in that, having a women\u2019s team wasn\u2019t seen as necessary, so it wasn\u2019t considered as important as it should have been.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has always been the mentality that football is a male sport. Growing up, I was told by many I should be dancing, not playing football because that was the normal thing for girls to do.\n\nRead More Football NSW announce NPL season return\n\n\u201c[But] the last few years have been amazing [and] it could not have been possible without the support, investment, respect and appreciation the women\u2019s teams have received from all club staff and management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe reason I remained at the club for so long was the fact that I could see growth. The club over the years invested a little more every year into the women\u2019s program. We\u2019ve got major sponsors on board including Kellogg\u2019s\u2019 \u201cSpecial K,\u201d we now share the main field with the men\u2019s team, and first-grade players get financial support. I cannot be prouder of the club and all the support it has provided for the women\u2019s team, and it\u2019s clearly [paying off] in the results we\u2019ve achieved.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a similar story at APIA Leichhardt. After a crucial board meeting in 2014 saw the club decide to revolutionise their failing women\u2019s program, APIA\u2019s rise up the NPLW ranks has been rapid. From starting at the bottom of the third tier, key short-term recruits including former Matildas Teresa Polias and Servet Uzunlar helped the women\u2019s team reverse course.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn advertising and marketing blitz opened the club up to new sponsors and prospective talent, with over 100 players trialling for the club\u2019s youth teams the following season. Four years later, thanks to successes in the senior and reserve grades, APIA were in the state\u2019s top division. \u201cIn two years, basically, we turned it all around,\u201d said Matteo Maiorana, APIA\u2019s women\u2019s manager.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd like everything in football, if your senior team is successful, it filters down. So that momentum rolled on and on. The following season, we recruited more senior players and won the league again: two Premierships back-to-back. That second year, there was a big meeting again and we said, \u2018we\u2019re actually in with a chance of getting promoted here.\u2019 And we did.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a saying in the club, and it resonates all the way through: the journey is the reward. The journey to get to where we are has been the most exciting and unbelievable thing that I can think of. I wouldn\u2019t change a thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike many newly-promoted teams, APIA didn\u2019t go on a large recruitment drive when they reached NPLW1. While their promotion this season has seen them attract some big W-League stars like Princess Ibini, Elizabeth Ralston, Georgia Yeoman-Dale, Teigen Allen and Alexandra Huynh, 29 of the 38-woman squad has remained from their second-division days, including three promoted youth players. For captain Ash Palombi, who joined APIA in NPLW2, that player retention has been key \u2013 not just for team chemistry on the field but also for the club\u2019s culture off it. \u201cFrom the get-go, that was something that was established already. The culture is what you have to buy into: this is what we\u2019re about, this is our motto, this is where we\u2019re headed, this is our plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you keep the nucleus of the team and you don\u2019t want to leave because the culture becomes everything. You\u2019ve got the banter floating around but then you\u2019ve got the fact that you all want to play together and for each other, and also for the people behind the scenes. It starts with the core and there\u2019s never any deviating from the plan, it was either \u2018you\u2019re in or you\u2019re out.\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re buying into the whole club, not just a single team. After we got promoted \u2013 that next training session \u2013 the men\u2019s team who were training on the other half of the field walked over and applauded us. Our SAP girls sat in the corner of the stands over there and had a drum going in our final game. They created songs with our names in them, cheering us on. That sort of stuff is what keeps you here.\n\nLike Olympic, it took time for that culture to develop. The weight of the club\u2019s history in the men\u2019s game meant old attitudes regarding women\u2019s football were not easily changed. But success is persuasive and now that they\u2019ve reached the top tier, APIA have their sights set on achieving even more of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFive years ago, we laughed because we couldn\u2019t even field a team,\u201d Maiorana said. \u201cWe used to forfeit games because we didn\u2019t have enough players. Now we\u2019ve got 80 or 90 players trialling and can pick whoever we want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s so much more we can do. We want to win the NPL1 Club Championship. That\u2019ll prove to all the nay-sayers \u2013 and to ourselves \u2013 that we belong. That means we\u2019ve got good teams now and into the future and would cement our place in women\u2019s football. The next big thing is seeing one of our players making the Matildas who plays for APIA. It\u2019s about providing the opportunities for players to progress. We\u2019re always thinking three or four years ahead.\u201d Palombi agrees. \u201cHow good would it be to see someone that\u2019s gone through the ranks in the juniors, see them stick and progress through the club with the coaching staff that we\u2019ve got, make their first-grade appearance and then go on and play in the W-League and potentially something further?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a prescient comment as Football Federation Australia and W-League clubs must soon reckon with their purpose within football\u2019s wider ecosystem. Like the old NSL clubs who have \u2018fallen\u2019 from their heyday at the top of Australian football, adjusting to shifting expectations and opportunities is necessary if women\u2019s football is to evolve.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is something to be learned, perhaps, from the position these historic clubs of Sydney Olympic and APIA Leichhardt now find themselves in with regards to the women\u2019s game: they acknowledge their role as one link in a larger chain of development, with long-term visions of producing players talented enough for national and international opportunities.\n\n\n\n"}], "Sydney Olympic won the NSL Championship in 2002.": [{"url": "https://www.topendsports.com/sport/soccer/list-league-a-league.htm", "page_content": "Australia's A-League Winners List\n\nHere are the winners from each season in the top level football league in Australia, the A-League.

Participation rates amongst junior players was steadily climbing to seriously start rivalling the other major sporting codes for the first time.\n\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\n\nBut apart from major league matches, such as playoff games, grand finals and championship deciders, the crowds over the length of the journey had not risen to the levels that gave it any sustained profitability.\n\nOver the twenty one years various changes were introduced to the NSL including creating two separate conferences, introducing a play-off series and switching to a summer league, but the financial breakthrough was still not achieved.\n\nDuring the nineties there was also a growing opinion from sponsors and benefactors and the new board of Soccer Australia, that the NSL would not become a mainstream competition because of the overt ethnic flavour of many of the clubs and the league itself.\n\nSome of the NSL clubs were seen as introverted, self concerned with their own ethnicity and not welcoming to the general follower of Australian sports.\n\nEthnic flags and logos were banned and clubs were even asked to change their name to be more like American baseball or football clubs and forget their countries of origin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NSL\u2019s cause was also being seriously wounded by a wolf pack of local newspapers who savaged the game at every opportunity with back page headlines and stories of \u201cEthnic Soccer Hooligan Violence\u201d. So much so that mothers started to fear for their children\u2019s safety if they went anywhere near a football match.\n\nFootball fans themselves started to wonder if these \u201csports reporters\u201d had even attended the same NSL game, so dramatic were the newspaper reports of serious trouble.\n\nSo around that time we saw the gradual reformation of the NSL into a homogenised and sanitised non-ethnic NSL, with only fair dinkum Australian football clubs.\n\nThe NSL Club attendance roll started to look like this: South Melbourne Lakers, Carlton Blues, Football Kingz, Adelaide City Zebras, Sydney United Pumas, Marconi Stallions, Wollongong Wolves, Melbourne Knights, Perth Glory, UTS Olympic, Gippsland Falcons, Brisbane Strikers, Newcastle Breakers, Canberra Cosmos, Collingwood Warriors, Northern Spirit, Parramatta Power and the West Adelaide Sharks.\n\nAnother major change around this time was that clubs like Canberra Cosmos and Perth Glory moved to being full time professional football clubs with full time employees and professional players, as opposed to a lot of NSL clubs and players who were only semi-professional or even amateur in some ways, up to that time.\n\nThe 1997-98 season saw the South Melbourne Lakers top the league table with big spending newcomers Carlton Blues runners up at their first attempt. Carlton and South Melbourne met in the grand final at a packed Olympic Park in an all Melbourne NSL decider.\n\nAnge Postecoglou\u2019s side won their third NSL title 2-1 and first as a manager for Ange. The Carlton Blues team contained a young Marc Bresciano and Simon Colosimo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNorthern Spirit joined the league in 1998-99 and were an immediate hit with the fans of northern Sydney playing to packed stands and a record average attendance in their first season.\n\nSydney City Pumas topped the league table that year ahead of the South Melbourne Lakers, but newcomers Perth Glory and Northern Spirit made the top five and the NSL playoffs.\n\nPerth Glory also attracted big crowds with 28,000 attending their Semi Final win over Marconi. However, Glory lost in the preliminary final to Sydney City. South Melbourne picked up their fourth NSL title with the Lakers 3-2 win in a great grand final at Olympic Park in front of a big crowd.\n\nWollongong Wolves won their first NSL title in 1999-2000 beating a gallant Perth Glory. The match was hailed as the greatest ever NSL grand final after a 3-3 finish in regular time and a penalty shootout win only after eighteen penalty kicks were taken. It was also a memorable game for the record NSL crowd of 43,242 in attendance.\n\nWollongong repeated their title victory in 2000-01, their second NSL crown in a row. This time beating South Melbourne at Parramatta Stadium in front of relatively disappointing crowd of 13,400 fans, given the Perth Glory semi final was watched by 31,710.\n\nThe Sydney Olympic Sharks surprised everyone in 2001-02 winning their second NSL title by beating runaway league leaders Perth Glory one nil in front of 42,735 fans.\n\nGlory finally won the NSL title they richly deserved in 2002-03 extracting their revenge on the Olympic sharks in from of 38,211 fans. Jamie Harnwell and Damien Mori put two goals past Clint Bolton to win two nil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlory repeated that effort in 2003-04 beating Parramatta Power 1-0 on the 4/4/2004 in front of 9,700 football fans. That was it, the last game of the NSL and the end of the competition.\n\nSo why did the NSL fail?\n\n1. Apart from the high profile games, the NSL and its clubs were never able to attract the large enough fan base to the games to produce enough return on their investment. Large investors, benefactors and sponsors finally ran out of patience and ended their involvement to cut their losses.\n\n2. High profile Australian players started to leave the NSL in larger numbers, due the ever growing overseas football markets and to take up more enticing offers from overseas leagues. Up to 200 of Australia\u2019s best footballers had left the NSL to go overseas to seek their football fortune.\n\n3. Soccer Australia was judged to have been poor administrators of the NSL. The lack of direction and leadership at times did not help the competition, particularly in its declining years.\n\n4. There were a number of controversies and indecisions and finally when Soccer Australia decided to abandon the ethnic flavour of the NSL, it tended to alienate some of the larger and more traditional ethnic clubs, who started pulling in opposite directions.\n\n5. The Australian press were not totally supportive of the NSL and probably sold more papers when they ran negative stories about the NSL, particularly the ethnic soccer violence angle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. There was not a proper process to assess the clubs\u2019 financial and structural viability when they applied to join the NSL and so there was a high turnover of NSL clubs.\n\n7. Australia is a very complex and very competitive sporting market with limited fan bases and financial returns. The other competitions were well entrenched and financially more stable.\n\n8. The Australasian competition with teams from Perth to New Zealand had very large operating and travel expenses and required large ticket and merchandising sales to remain profitable in the long run.\n\nThe National Soccer League (NSL) kicked off in 1977 with so much promise, thirty four years ago this month. Despite all its misgivings, problems and financial woes it ran for twenty eight years, creating a historical and lasting legacy for the many football fans of this country.\n\nHow will you remeber the NSL?"}, {"url": "https://sydneyolympicfc.com/?page_id=125", "page_content": "Club Overview\n\nSydney Olympic Football Club is an Australian semi professional soccer club, based in Belmore, Sydney, New South Wales, that plays in the National Premier Leagues NSW.

It was the year when football became a national club competition for the first time.\n\nIt was also the year when big business started to see the potential of the game and a future in football sponsorship in this country. Companies like Philips, Coca-Cola and Ericsson put in millions of dollars into the NSL to help it get off the ground and kept it running for twenty-eight years.\n\nIt also saw the establishment of a football philanthropy which continues to this day, the scale of which was never seen before in this country. Some of Australia\u2019s richest men, who had made their fortunes in the lucky country and had a great love of football, put their own money back into the game. Some of these wealthy Australians also sat on the board of Soccer Australia.\n\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\n\nIn the early years of the NSL Frank Lowy and a number of successful Jewish businessmen from the Eastern Suburbs poured millions into Sydney City in the NSL. The team did spectacularly well on the field. With their sponsors backing, Sydney City was able to assemble the best team in the NSL and won four of the first six NSL titles.\n\nThis success was not reflected off the field and even as four time NSL champions, Sydney City were never profitable and only averaged crowds of about 600 per game at best, while the overall average game attendance during the first few years of the NSL was about 3000 to 4000.\n\nAs crowd averages started falling, Soccer Australia and the NSL backers decided to re-structure the league.\n\nIn 1984, among other things, they agreed on a new, revolutionary championship format with a twofold aim; to reduce the expensive interstate travel costs and to increase the \u201clocal derby\u201d content of NSL matches.\n\nFirstly, the NSL was split into two conferences:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 the Australian Conference, with teams from NSW and the ACT, and\n\n\u2022 the National Conference, consisting of Victorian, South Australian and Queensland clubs.\n\nSecondly, the winner of each conference played off in an end of season two legged home and away final to determine the NSL champion.\n\nIn 1984, the first year of the re-structured league, astonishingly there were 24 teams who entered the new NSL competition \u2013 12 in each division. This is the highest number of teams in any national domestic club competition in Australia and remains a record till this day.\n\nThe Australian Conference (Northern Conference) consisted of teams from Sydney City, Sydney Olympic, Marconi-Fairfield, APIA Leichhardt, Blacktown, Sydney Croatia, Penrith, Newcastle, Canberra, St George, Melita and Wollongong City.\n\nThe National Conference (Southern Conference) consisted of teams from South Melbourne, Heidelberg United, Melbourne Croatia, Brisbane Lions, Brunswick, Preston, Adelaide City, Footscray, Green Gully, West Adelaide, Brisbane City and Sunshine George Cross.\n\nThe top five teams in the points table at the end of the 28 round competition from each conference played off in an elimination series to determine who would represent their conference in the two legged NSL grand final.\n\n1984 NSL Australian Conference semi finalists \u2013 Sydney Olympic, Marconi, Blacktown City, Sydney City and APIA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1984 NSL National Conference semi finalists \u2013 Preston, Heidelberg, South Melbourne, Brunswick and Brisbane Lions.\n\n1984 NSL Grand Final First Leg \u2013 South Melbourne 2 Sydney Olympic 1.

Crowds during the regular season remained around the three to four thousand mark average, but the finals series average attendances rose to about nine thousand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was great that so many teams around the country had entered the NSL, however it still didn\u2019t introduce enough financial stability into the competition, so after only three seasons the two conference system was scrapped.\n\nThe NSL reverted back to the one single competition and a new set of rules were introduced to cull the number of teams. About half the teams were dumped back to their respective state leagues.\n\nThe criteria used to decide who stayed and who went was based 50 per cent on the 1986 playing record, 40 per cent on past playing record, and 10 per cent on crowd support. The result was that only one team from outside Sydney and Melbourne was retained, reigning champions Adelaide City.\n\nIn another major blow to the NSL, Sydney City and its backers pulled out of the revised NSL competition in 1987, after only one round. They were frustrated by the major changes and the lack of support for their team and withdrew leaving a big hole, as the most successful team in NSL history at that point in time.\n\nApart from returning to a thirteen team single division, the league also dispensed with finals series for the 1987 season, reverting back to first past the post championships.\n\n1987 saw APIA Leichardt become NSL Champions for the first time heading off Preston by six points and great rival Marconi in third position.\n\nAttendances didn\u2019t improve much that year and many considered the lack of finals as a backward step, so a five team NSL finals series was re-introduced from 1988 and were to remain with the competition until the NSL\u2019s demise in 2004.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 1988 season saw Sydney Croatia, Marconi, South Melbourne, Sydney Olympic and Wollongong make the finals series.

With a new prize of national championship honours to play for, the Sydney derbies became more intense.\n\nThe best battles of the first few NSL years were between Sydney Olympic and Sydney City where legendary players such as Joe Watson, Eddie Thomson (coach from 1980) and later John Kosmina gave Hakoah a dominant record over the more-heavily supported Olympic.\n\nSydney City were almost untouchable in the first few NSL years, winning four of the first six league championships.\n\nIn fact, Sydney clubs dominated the first seven national league seasons, with Marconi (1978) and St George (1983) also taking out national honours.\n\nThe championship-deciding finals system, introduced in the NSL in the mid-1980s, gave an even bigger stage for Sydney clubs to battle it out.\n\nFrom 1988 to 1990 there were three classic grand finals in a row fought out between Sydney teams.\n\nThe Marconi - Sydney Croatia 1988 final was epic, 1-1 after 90 minutes, 2-2 after extra time and a penalty shoot-out eventually won by Berti Mariani's Marconi.\n\nThe Sydney Croatia (later Sydney United) team of this era included Robbie Slater, Graham Arnold and Croatian legend Vedran Rozic, who was one of the last great player-coaches of the national league.\n\nNSL crowd records were broken in 1989 and again the following year when Marconi and Sydney Olympic played out two grand finals in a row at the new Parramatta Stadium.\n\nMarconi took out the 1989 decider 1-0 thanks to a late Zlatko Nastevski goal, but Olympic gained revenge the following year with a 2-0 grand final victory.\n\nAmazingly Olympic and Marconi met in six finals series in a row from 1984 to 1990, and also squared off in the 1994 and 2001 play-offs.\n\nIn all national league matches, Marconi and Sydney Olympic came up against each other 66 times, Marconi with the clearly dominant record winning 28 times to Olympic' s 19.\n\nHowever, it was a record that edged more Olympic's way throughout the late 1990s as the former Pan Hellenic ended up being the last Sydney club to win an NSL championship (2002).\n\nOne star name to note was Liverpool legend Ian Rush, who turned out as a guest player for Olympic against Marconi in 1999. Rushy even scored as did Brett Emerton in a 2-1 win at Belmore in front of just over 7,000 fans.\n\nThe next most common Sydney national league derby was Marconi - Sydney Croatia (48 games) then Olympic - Croatia (44).\n\nClubs such as Blacktown City, Parramatta Melita Eagles and Western Suburbs also provided Sydney some keenly-contested derby matches on the national stage after previously meeting in the state league.\n\nNew intra-Sydney rivalries were created with the formation of Northern Spirit and Parramatta Power in the late 1990s.\n\nBattles between the long-established Marconi, Olympic and Sydney United against these \u2018upstarts\u2019 created new type of rivalry on the national stage, however they were ultimately short-lived as the NSL closed down in 2004.\n\nThe top five players in terms of most appearances in all Sydney national league derbies reveal five great names: Graham Jennings (136 Sydney derbies), Ian Gray (135), Peter Katholos (129), Marshall Soper (126) and Gary Meier (125) leading the way.\n\nThe most Sydney derby goals were scored scored by more legends in John Kosmina (46 Sydney derby goals), Mark Jankovics (45) and Soper (41).\n\nSydney FC had Australia's biggest city to itself when the new Hyundai A-League kicked-off in 2005 and while there were some memorable matches against clubs from other cities, in hindsight there was something missing.\n\nThe more recent formation of the Western Sydney Wanderers added a fantastic new rivalry that ignited in their very first confrontation, where Alessandro Del Piero scored the winner in Sydney FC's 1-0 win at Parramatta Stadium in October 2012.\n\nThe Wanderers gained revenge at the next opportunity, winning 2-0 at Allianz while the third match-up in 2012/13 ended level as Brett Emerton (Sydney) and Iacopo La Rocca (Wanderers) saw red in a fiery 1-1 draw.\n\nThe Sydney A-League derby had quickly established itself as an un-missable event and from the following season 2013/14 Sydney saw something it had never seen before, with sell-out crowds for home-and-away season matches.\n\nWhile the Wanderers enjoyed overall Sydney derby honours in their first two Premiership-winning seasons, the Sky Blues have been dominant ever since. In fact the Wanderers have not won a Sydney derby since January 2014.\n\nLeading into their Round 20 confrontation at Allianz Stadium the overall record stands at five wins to Sydney FC, three to Western Sydney and three draws.\n\nAll signs are pointing to derby number 12 being one of the biggest yet, with Sydney FC clinging to a top six spot and anxious to get out of a form slump, while the second-placed Wanderers are desperately keen to get out of a six-match winless streak against their bitter rivals.\n\nBring it on for another night of derby drama in Sydney.\n\nFollow Andrew Howe\u2019s Australian football stats updates on Twitter @AndyHowe_statto"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/event/Sydney-2000-Olympic-Games", "page_content": "Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, athletic festival held in Sydney that took place September 15\u2013October 1, 2000. The Sydney Games were the 24th occurrence of the modern Olympic Games.\n\nSydney was narrowly chosen over Beijing as host city of the 2000 Olympics. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) was attracted to the city\u2019s long history of enthusiasm for sports, its promise to use recovered toxic wastelands as sites for sporting venues, and its plan to involve the smaller countries of Oceania in hosting activities. Despite some cost overruns and a ticket scandal, the preparations and the Games themselves went smoothly. The opening ceremonies celebrated the history of Australia, especially the unique cultures and contributions of the Aboriginal peoples of the continent. The high point of the opening ceremonies came when Aboriginal runner Cathy Freeman lit the Olympic flame. She later won the gold medal in the 400-metre event. The accomplishments and recognition of Freeman were an important milestone for Australian Aboriginal peoples, who were still struggling for their place in Australian society (see Sidebar: Cathy Freeman: The Heart of a Nation).\n\nBritannica Quiz The Olympic Games\n\nNearly 11,000 athletes representing 199 IOC member countries (including 3 athletes from the United Nations dependency of East Timor) participated in the Games, which featured a record 928 medals awarded in 300 events. Several events were contested at the Olympics for the first time in 2000, including men\u2019s and women\u2019s tae kwon do, trampoline, triathlon, and synchronized diving. Other new women\u2019s events included weightlifting, modern pentathlon, and pole vault. The track-and-field competition starred American sprinter Marion Jones, who won three gold and two bronze medals. Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe, nicknamed the \u201cThorpedo,\u201d collected three gold medals and a silver, and Dutch swimmers Pieter van den Hoogeband and Inge de Bruijn each won two gold medals.

Opposition to the National League in Victoria was strong, with leading clubs fearing that it would undermine the State League and cost much more than it would bring in. Their reluctance was only overcome when Tom Bailey of Mooroolbark United announced that he would apply for membership. Mooroolbark finished rock bottom and lasted only one season in the National League, ultimately replaced by the newly created club, Newcastle KB United. Fitzroy United were the best of the Victorian clubs, finishing third behind inaugural champions Eastern Suburbs Hakoah.\n\nSouth Melbourne finished in the same position in 1978, with Fitzroy United a couple of rungs down the table in fifth and Footscray JUST third from bottom. Fitzroy United relocated to Olympic Village in 1979, becoming Heidelberg United, and almost claimed the championship, finishing runners-up to Marconi. The lethal strike partnership of Gary Cole and Jamie Paton scored 21 goals between them, but they were no match for the combined tally of 31 from Mark Jankovics and young Victorian Eddie Krncevic. South Melbourne finished with the wooden spoon, but avoided relegation on a technicality. A much improved performance saw South finish third in 1980, just behind rivals Heidelberg United, who were runners-up again, this time to Sydney City by a solitary championship point. The Bergers were also bettered in the NSL Cup final, losing 3-0 to Marconi, but consolation came in the form of the Top 4 Finals Series, where the Bergers thrashed Sydney City 4-0 in the final at Bruce Stadium in Canberra, thanks to a hat-trick from Cole.\n\nStalwarts of the great South Melbourne era in the National Soccer League, (from left) Mehmet Durakovic, Michael Petersen and goalkeeper Peter Laumets.

It was South Melbourne's turn to occupy the runners-up position, losing out to Sydney City again who finished two games clear on the top of the table. The Bergers (4th) and an improved Preston (5th) finished just ahead of South Melbourne (6th), with Footscray JUST (14th) lucky to avoid the wooden spoon. 1983 witnessed marginal improvement, with Preston finishing third ahead of South Melbourne (4th) and Heidelberg United (6th).\n\nIn 1984 the National Soccer League (NSL) was increased from 16 to 24 clubs and divided into two conferences of twelve clubs apiece. The National Conference had eight clubs from Victoria, two from Queensland and two from South Australia. The Australian Conference comprised 10 clubs from New South Wales, one from the ACT and one from Northern New South Wales. First time entrants from the Victorian State League included Melbourne Croatia, Brunswick Juventus, Green Gully and Sunshine George Cross. Four Victorian clubs occupied the finals positions, with South Melbourne finishing on top and winning the National Conference finals. In the two-leg play-off for the national title, South Melbourne beat Sydney Olympic 2-1 in both legs. Charlie Egan nabbed both goals at Olympic Park and Oscar Crino and John Yzendoorn scored at Barton Park.\n\nSouth Melbourne, 1984 NSL Champions, the first Victorian club to claim the NSL Championship trophy.\n\nThe following season, South Melbourne won the National Conference, but were eliminated in the finals by Preston Makedonia, who in turn fell short, conceding two late goals in losing to Brunswick Juventus 2-1 in the Conference final. Juventus won the Championship beating Sydney City 1-0 home and away, Fabio Incantalupo scoring both goals. In 1986, Brunswick Juventus topped the National Conference table, but it was Adelaide City which won the Finals series and would ultimately claim the championship with a two-legged 3-2 playoff aggregate win over Sydney Olympic.\n\nFabio Incantalupo holds the 1985 NSL championship trophy aloft at Olympic Park in Melbourne.\n\nCome 1987, the NSL reverted to a single division with 14 clubs, with Brunswick Juventus, Footscray JUST, Heidelberg United, Melbourne Knights, Preston Makedonia, South Melbourne and Sunshine George Cross making up half the league. Despite the over-subscription of Victorian clubs, neither would challenge APIA Leichhardt for honours, with the Bergers finishing last and being relegated. 1988 would witness the introduction of the Finals Series to determine the NSL champion, South Melbourne finishing third with a host of NSW teams headed by Wollongong City. Marconi claimed the championship, winning four successive elimination finals to defeat Sydney Croatia on penalties. Brunswick Juventus were relegated, replaced by Heidelberg United for the 1989 season, the final winter season before the league would move to summer. Melbourne Croatia and Preston both finished in the finals, but neither would make the Grand Final, which was won by Marconi again. Heidelberg United would drop back down to the Victorian State League, along with the newly branded Melbourne City JUST. By the end of the following year, the club would ultimately be taken over by the Argentinian community, their history lost along with it.\n\nAs summer football began in 1989, the National Soccer League would bring to the fore two Victorian powerhouses, South Melbourne and Melbourne Knights, who had great success in the NSL throughout this period. South Melbourne were crowned champions in 1990\u201391 with the legendary Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s at the helm. The final, against Melbourne Knights, was played in front of 25,000 at Olympic Park and is remembered as one of the great finals of the NSL era. South were champions again in 1997\u201398 and 1998\u201399, where a young Ange Postecoglou would begin his coaching odyssey, while the Knights, led by Andrew Marth, Steve Horvat and a young but lethal Mark Viduka, won back-to-back titles in 1994\u201395 and 1995\u201396.

The Warriors, had more than 10,000 fans to their first home match at Victoria Park, but the marriage between soccer and AFL didn't last beyond one season. Carlton tasted more success, reaching the Grand Final in its debut season, losing narrowly to a Con Boutsianis winner in a thrilling final against South Melbourne at a packed Olympic Park. The club invested heavily in youth, with Mark Bresciano, Vince Grella, Simon Colosimo, Archie Thompson and Josh Kennedy all coming through the Carlton ranks. Financial problems amidst a broken football landscape saw the club withdrew midway through its fourth season.\n\nMelbourne Knights with the 1994-95 NSL Championship trophy. Source: Melbourne Knights website.\n\nMorwell Falcons were the only regional Victorian club that competed in the NSL, and drew upon a greater history before it was finally admitted to the NSL in 1993. Founded by Italian migrants to the Latrobe Valley, the club had benefited from a VSF restructure in 1982, debuting in the Victorian State League that season, and winning it in 1984 and 1989. After steady improvement in its first couple of seasons in the NSL, the Falcons reached the finals in 1994-95 under Bobby McLachlan, but were eliminated 6-1 on aggregate by South Melbourne. The challenge of maintaining a place among the sport's elite would ultimately be too much for the regional club, and it too folded by 2001.\n\nSouth Melbourne with the 1998-99 NSL Championship trophy, won of four championships they would claim in the NSL era.\n\nBy this time, only South Melbourne and Melbourne Knights remained in the NSL, but the winds of change would soon dawn in 2004, with the Crawford Report delivering a final hammer blow to a competition which debuted in 1977 and would run for twenty-eight seasons, showcasing the best players from Victoria and Australia, and providing seven championships to Victorian clubs."}, {"url": "https://olympics.com/en/olympic-games/sydney-2000", "page_content": "New Firsts\n\nTriathlon and taekwondo were two new additions to the Olympic programme.

Samuel Silvera looked comfortable as he received the ball from Jason Cummings in the 34th minute at CommBank Stadium, his side ahead 1-0, almost as if the world was slowing down for him. He had started the game on the right and not looked comfortable, nervous even, with loose touches, errors and turnovers uncharacteristic of his season.\n\nPerhaps recognising this, Mariners boss Nick Montgomery, who was denied coach of the year honours earlier in the week based on a technicality, had switched him with B\u00e9ni Nkololo just over 10 minutes prior and been immediately rewarded when the French winger broke down the right and set Cummings up, on his second attempt, to fire past Tom Glover in the City goal.\n\nA lead secured and nerves settled, the Mariners began to rise like a tide, lifted by the wave of yellow and blue-clad supporters at their end of the ground. Conversely, City \u2013 the three-time defending premiers seeking to establish themselves amongst the pantheon of the greatest sides in Australian football history \u2013 looked off the pace in the final third. Marco Tilio, one of the brightest stars in the league, was finding space, only to send his efforts tamely at keeper Danny Vukovic.\n\n\u201cIt looked like they wanted to win the game more than us,\u201d said City coach Rado Vido\u0161i\u0107. \u201cThey outplayed us in the first half. They bullied us. They won every 50-50 ball. Even the smallest players, they were unbelievably committed. We just maybe thought someone else was going to do it for me, and it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nAnd now Silvera was on the ball, looking up and seeing only Nuno Reis, a centre-back shifted over to the right and instructed to stay home as Bos sprung forward in attack on the opposite side, in his way. Decision made, a sudden burst of pace, and he was beyond him, driving into the penalty area and driving a shot into the bottom corner of the net to make it 2-0 to the Mariners.\n\nSamuel Silvera celebrates his goal with teammates in the A-League Men grand final. Photograph: Saeed Khan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCity responded \u2013 you knew they would, they\u2019re too good not to \u2013 and pegged one back with five minutes remaining in the first half when Jamie Maclaren dragged a cutback to Richard van der Venne to hammer into the net. But thanks to Silvera, the Mariners had that two-goal buffer. At half-time, club chief executive Shaun Mielekamp tweeted out a single word, part affirmation, part prayer, and part theft of intellectual property from the writers of Ted Lasso: \u201cBelieve!\u201d\n\nTen minutes into the second half, Andrew Nabbout slid a ball through for Van der Venne to send past Vukovic but not past the rapid rearguard action of Nectarios Triantis. City was pressing, but the Mariners, in the best way possible, were desperate in their defending.\n\nAnd then potentially the most remarkable half-an-hour in Australian football history occurred: a City collapse almost as epic as the tale woven by the Mariners.\n\nIn the 65th minute, Silvera turned his man and played through Cummings, who was tackled. Substitute Jacob Farrell lunged for the ball and was felled by Nabbout. Penalty to the Mariners, penalty for Cummings, and 3-1 with 25 to go.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Guardian Australia Sport Free newsletter Get a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I need to enjoy the moment now.\u201d\n\nIt was a humiliating collapse from a City side that has now been to four straight grand finals and lost three, and it became a rout when Silvera delivered a trivela onto the head of N\u2019Kololo to make it 5-1. It was an open-hand slap from the league\u2019s smallest team, one whose uneven training pitch is prone to flooding and whose gym is a converted shipping container, to the ALM\u2019s outpost of the City Football Group.\n\nAnd then, just because they could, they added a sixth through Moresche.

The A-League club which made such an impression on new consultant Harry Redknapp he could not quite recall their name.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the South Coast Mariners \u2026 they asked me if I would do a bit as an advisor,\u201d the English manager told talkSPORT radio in May 2016. The Mariners had just claimed the wooden spoon, finishing 12 points adrift and with a total three wins and 13 points from 27 games.\n\nExecutive vice chairman Peter Storrie, one of Redknapp\u2019s former West Ham colleagues, had done the wooing and chief executive Mike Charlesworth expected him to visit the Central Coast at least twice during the season and possibly also in the off-season. \u201cNo, no,\u201d Redknapp said. \u201cI won\u2019t be going. It\u2019s a long way \u2013 30-odd hours on a plane.\u201d\n\nHow about those Mariners? The team which used to do so much with so little but had slipped into comedic areas and reached the peak of peak A-League. How about the 70 goals conceded in 2015-16 under Tony Walmsley, an unenviable record that got him the sack?\n\nHow about the 4-1 loss to Perth Glory on New Year\u2019s Eve of 2018 remembered not for the unfortunate scoreline but the image of two portable training goals being wheeled onto the field after a goal post on one of the originals snapped mid-match?\n\nHow about Usain Bolt, the champion sprinter with the first touch of a trampoline who came but did not conquer? How about the home defeat to Wellington Phoenix that ended with an 8-2 scoreline and another sacked coach in Mike Mulvey?\n\nNow there is none of that. Gone is the drama and the farce and the toy rifles smuggled into stadiums by small children. In its place, finally, is some football. This season, under Alen Stajcic, is the first time the Mariners have back-to-back league wins since December 2017. It is their best start since their title-winning campaign of 2013-14 of the Graham Arnold era. Five wins and two losses from the opening seven games seems scarcely fathomable, their 15 points to date utterly incongruous with those 13 gleaned from entire season some five years ago.\n\nEach week, A-League observers with a keen sense of history wait for it all to come crashing down, for natural order to resume. Except that it does not, and the football keeps coming. There is still the small matter of the club\u2019s perennially imminent sale the still-empty promise of a budget big enough to climb up off the salary cap\u2019s floor.\n\nStill, how about 19-year-old Alou Kuol, whose mere presence on the field makes magic happen, and whose brace off the bench against Western United on Sunday \u2013 his fourth and fifth goals from seven outings this season \u2013 won the game 3-2 and restored the Mariners\u2019 spot at the top of the table, and whose name is now talked about as an Olyroos candidate for the Olympics?\n\nHow about Danny De Silva\u2019s return to form, and the energy of Josh Nisbet, Jordan Smylie and Daniel Bouman? That tired \u201cgive youth a chance\u201d refrain so often trotted out when money is tight, recruitment poor and injuries plentiful has suddenly taken on a prettier hue.\n\nAnd what about Matt Simon doing things the way he used to back when the club\u2019s winning culture made for premierships, championships and regular finals appearances. He has always been the serial pest opponents love to hate and hate to love, only the Wizard of Woy Woy of 2021 is producing his special kind of sorcery surrounded by some other magic. Last week the club talisman marked his 200th appearance with an assist and penalty goal to help Central Coast to a 3-2 comeback win over Melbourne City. He was chaired off the field by teammates, then cried as he embraced his young daughter, who was born prematurely and to whom he dedicated his display. Days later the 35-year-old opened the scoring against Western United to lay the foundations on which Kuol would build.\n\nAccording to United coach Mark Rudan, Stajcic is actually the resident practitioner of the paranormal. \u201cHe\u2019s a magician as far as I\u2019m concerned \u2013 he\u2019s turned the place around again,\u201d Rudan said before his side\u2019s loss. \u201cIt\u2019s funny [the media] mentioned [the Mariners are] walking on water because right now you\u2019d think Alen Stajcic is Jesus, because he\u2019s done a fantastic job with them. We all know the fantastic job that he did with the Matildas as well.\u201d\n\nAfterwards, Stajcic himself was more pragmatic. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic, the magic is hard work,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you put the hard work in sometimes you get rewarded, and we\u2019re in a moment now where the hard work we put in over the pre-season is paying off.

At the end of last community season, every Grand Final trophy across the region was presented by a Mariners player.\u201d\n\nThe Origins\n\nEven the most optimistic football fans raised eyebrows when the Mariners were announced as one of the eight A-League foundation clubs.\n\nWhile the process, whereby the best regional bid would join teams from seven other major markets, presented hope for a Central Coast bid, they were still deemed a long shot. Businessmen Brian Sewell and Jerry Raterman fronted the bid before disappearing, as Lyall Gorman took the executive reigns. But throughout, Lawrie McKinna was the driving force, with patriotic \u201cCoastie\u201d John Singleton\u2019s influence key.\n\nSingleton, who was an Industree Group Stadium (then Bluetongue Stadium) shareholder, was a Football Australia board member and respected by chairman Frank Lowy. Singleton grew to love McKinna so much that he topped up his wage when Sydney FC came knocking in 2006 after Pierre Littbarski left.\n\n\u201cI drove up and met Lawrie and just said \u2018Mate, we don\u2019t want you to leave here\u2019,\u201d Singleton said in 2008.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have time to draw up anything official, but we shook hands on it and that was that. We said we\u2019d worry about the contract later and he knocked back what was a legal, firm offer for substantially more money in place of a gentleman\u2019s agreement.\n\n\u201cThat was great. He genuinely loves it here and he hasn\u2019t done one thing wrong from a public point of view or a coaching point of view.\u201d\n\nDespite domestic football\u2019s difficult past, the NSL and A-League are inextricably linked, and the Mariners epitomise this, with the spirit of mateship fostered in those early years emanating from Northern Spirit.\n\nMcKinna was Northern Spirit\u2019s coach in the final NSL season and brought the bulk of Northern Spirit squad and backroom staff to the Coast once he was appointed the Mariners\u2019 inaugural coach.\n\nThis group \u2013 which included John Hutchinson, Alex Wilkinson, Adam Kwasnik, Matt Osman, Wayne O\u2019Sullivan, Noel Spencer and Stewart Petrie \u2013 was family. Some hadn\u2019t been paid for six months or more by the time the NSL wrapped up and were living in a share house paid for by McKinna, fed by his wife Christine.\n\nForming the backbone of the squad, that camaraderie underpinned the Mariners\u2019 early years, and that legacy remains, with many of those still calling Central Coast home.\n\nBut there was also a touch of glamour on the Coast, as entrepreneurial McKinna signed a swathe of Aussie icons, including Mile Jedinak, John Aloisi and Mark \u2018Bozza\u2019 Bosnich.\n\nI visited the Central Coast on no less than 20 occasions during my time as Daily Telegraph football reporter and McKinna picked me up and took me on a personal tour including the club\u2019s modest facilities on my first visit.\n\nAt one stage, McKinna had the entire Central Coast searching for his lost boxer dog, Douglas David, which he revealed on his regular Central Coast FM slot.\n\nAussie football impact\n\nPound for pound, the Mariners\u2019 impact on Australian football has been \u2013 at a minimum \u2013 as significant as any region during the A-League era.\n\nWithout the Mariners: Mile Jedinak may have never got an A-League contract, Bozza probably never would\u2019ve played an A-League game, and who knows how John Aloisi and Tony Vidmar\u2019s football journeys would have unfolded \u2013 Vidmar got a final deal after a heart condition devastatingly saw him miss the 2006 World Cup.\n\nThis week, a unique episode of A-Leagues #AllAccess.\n\n\n\nWe take you behind the scenes to take a closer look at the stories fuelling @MelbourneCity and @CCMariners' @IsuzuUTE A-League Grand Final quest.\n\n\n\nA-Leagues #AllAccess Episode 28: Countdown coming, Thursday 7:30pm AEST \ud83d\udcfa pic.twitter.com/T0hwPr0YVp \u2014 Isuzu UTE A-League (@aleaguemen) May 31, 2023\n\nAustralian internationals Andrew Redmayne, Matt Simon, Lachlan Wales (U23) and Trent Buhagiar (U23) potentially never get a pathway into Australian domestic football.\n\nThe Mariners was also Graham Arnold\u2019s first A-League coaching job, back in 2010-11, which led to the greatest Grand Final in A-League history, Brisbane Roar\u2019s famous comeback win at Suncorp Stadium.\n\nThe dark days\n\nThe Mariners\u2019 were among the worst teams in Australian sport during their darkest days, just after the Socceroos had won the Asian Cup.\n\nThough no fault of his own, Nick Montgomery was there to witness it first-hand, returning in 2017.\n\nThe issues clearly ran deep, including financial woes. From the fans\u2019 viewpoint, the biggest one was the club lost its soul.\n\nThat was the period where the club disconnected from the locals and it\u2019s no coincidence that they had the least number of homegrown products in their first team, losing locals like Wales too easily, whilst it was the last time the Mariners had a batch of players living on the Central Coast.\n\n\u201cDid the club lose its DNA? We were searching for it. We were trying to find what we\u2019ve got now \u2013 trying to find this recipe that Nick Montgomery has found for us,\u201d Mariners CEO Shaun Mielekamp said.\n\n\u201cOff the field we\u2019ve developed the old boys culture which Rugby League does so well. When I was at Souths (in marketing and merchandising), the connection to past players was such a powerful part of the club. Club greats Mario Fenech, Bob McCarthy, John Sattler \u2013 they were always around through thick and thin. The A-League hasn\u2019t embraced that at all.\n\n\u201cMike Cockerill (the late great Fairfax football reporter) came up to me one day and said, \u2018please promise me there will always be a local in the squad\u2019. There always has been. But the factory (academy) wasn\u2019t in operation. When I came, we didn\u2019t have academy. It makes sense its taken us this long to produce a steady stream, of local talent. Buhagiar and Wales, we wouldn\u2019t lose them now.\n\n\u201cNow with the A-League Women\u2019s side, Annalise Rasmussen, a Buff Point local, is our first contracted player and will get a chance to pursue her professional football journey and education at home.\u201d\n\nThe early days of the @CCMariners\u2026\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude97 John Aloisi's first session featured a burnt-out car on the pitch!\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc36 On Tony Vidmar's first day, a dog walked on the field & did his business.\n\n\n\nThis week, the club is heading to their fourth Grand Final.\n\n\n\nCatch the full discussion on\u2026 pic.twitter.com/5ZJsEmUc1o \u2014 Isuzu UTE A-League (@aleaguemen) May 31, 2023\n\nWomen\u2019s expansion was a pipe dream more than six years ago.\n\nThere was a view that the Mariners were that bad, they in some ways triggered the 2017 expansion process that led to 15 bids Australia-wide.\n\nThat process seemed to inspire the National Second Division, giving a host of semi-professional clubs wings and hope of returning to the national frame.\n\nIt was also the period (2018) that the AFL launched a Tasmanian steering committee, with the Federal Government last month committing $240 million of federal funding to a new Tasmanian stadium.\n\nSuccess has 1000 fathers, but underpinning the Mariners\u2019 on and off field revival has been the local DNA.\n\nJacob Farrell (Wyoming) and Harrison Steele (Terrigal) will be the true locals lining up on Saturday night, while Josh Nisbet and Danny Vukovic are adopted Coasties, with scholarship players Lachlan Bayliss, Sasha Kuzevski and Cameron Windust joining Mariners academy products Dan Hall, Max Balard and January departure Garang Kuol.\n\n\u201cThe academy has also helped with a smooth cultural transition. Where previously some young signings from Sydney came in as big time Charlies, the kids coming through our academy are coming through with the right mentality. In large part thanks to the likes of Matty Simon,\u201d Mielekamp said.\n\n\u201cThere used to be a bus picking up all the Sydney players from Turramurra. Everyone is now living on the Coast. It\u2019s an unspoken rule \u2013 players demand that of each other. It comes from within the squad.\u201d\n\nThe future\n\nMontgomery, who like the Northern Spirit crew and so many before him has adopted the Central Coast as home, has made a huge impact. But one hopes that the club has the blueprint now for sustained on and off field success.\n\nIf the Central Coast, population 376,000, can thrive like this, imagine what a region steeped in Australian football history like Newcastle can do?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a small region with enormous potential. With the A-League Women\u2019s team coming in, it completes the ecosystem,\u201d Mielekamp said.\n\n\u201cThe way we work with Central Coast Football and grassroots, I haven\u2019t seen anyone come close to that genuine engagement. The community work over the years is paying off \u2013 there is barely a kid on the Coast that doesn\u2019t have 20 autographs on their caps.\n\n\u201cOur active support is kids. It\u2019s young kids and families and a massive generation of under 16s coming through that\u2019s given us that spike, in addition to our core rusted on fans. Many of whom stuck with us through thick and thin.\u201d\n\nAdelaide United is the other club that has really stuck true to its local DNA, and in that process both clubs have no qualms about throwing young local players into the deep-end, because it\u2019s true to their identity. And the kids \u2013 in well balanced and coached teams \u2013 have delivered.\n\nThe Mariners fairytale should serve as inspiration for other regional areas in Australia, as the nation\u2019s population grows.\n\nOn Saturday night, the Mariners will again be promoting Central Coast to Australia and beyond."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com.au/football/story/_/id/37789828/special-celebration-marks-central-coast-mariners-spectacular-league-victory", "page_content": "Normally when a team wins the A-League Men Grand Final -- or any final or league, for that matter -- the celebratory trophy lift is reserved for players and staff associated with the squad, a private moment of jubilation staged on a very public stage. The 2022-23 ALM decider, however, wasn't a normal game and even more pertinently, newly crowned champions the Central Coast Mariners aren't your usual club. So Saturday evening probably deserved a special moment of celebration.\n\nThat's why when captain Danny Vukovic paused after making his way over to the hastily erected celebratory arch and waited for a horde of family, friends, Mariners staff, and Jake Banks -- Banksy -- the Mariners' number one fan who is confined to a wheelchair due to cerebral palsy, it felt natural. It felt right. The Mariners are a team that has built a culture based on togetherness and putting in the effort not for themselves, but for the man next to him, and the community at their backs. One of confidence and belief in what they do and their ability to do it. Of living the spirit of the battle hymn that was ringing out across Parramatta Stadium as blue and yellow confetti rained down on those streaming towards the trophy presentation -- Tom Petty's \"I Won't Back Down.\"\n\nTheir \"family photos\" after home wins are a public expression of this identity, a reflection of their place in the community of Gosford and the greater Central Coast. So it only made sense to take another one now.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\n\n\"It was never going to be anything different,\" Mariners chief executive Shaun Mielekamp said. \"Even post-match, we still don't back down when it's about getting your families on the field. This is who we are and we truly believe in these values and we won't buckle on that for anybody.\n\n\"The players wouldn't have done the [trophy lift] without their families there.\"\n\nFor coach Nick Montgomery, 10 years on from missing the Mariners' 2013 title win after receiving the first red card of his career in the semifinal, it meant that the greatest moment of his young coaching career was spent with his wife and children by his side.\n\nWhen he took over from Alen Stajic ahead of the 2021-22 season, it was easy to dismiss his appointment or worse, label it a step backward. Following playing finals football under Stajcic it appeared that the club, who had finished last four times in five seasons prior to that successful year, was simply going with the cheapest option when they tapped their former captain and now youth coach as his replacement following Stajic's resignation; throwing away any hopes of progress to save a few bucks.\n\nInstead, he has become the best young coach in the competition, one that will almost certainly move on to bigger and better one day. When accounting for his personality and history at the club, it's not unrealistic to say that nobody else in the league could have done what he did with this team.\n\n\"It's a family club, it really is,\" he said. \"The Central Coast is a family community. People move there with their children. The last 10 years, there's been some really tough times on the Coast. The team has really struggled.\n\n\"To get everyone on the pitch at the end there ... that's just normal for us. We do the family photo every week at home when we win a game so I don't think there's any more fitting picture than getting all the families out there tonight and creating memories that will last forever.\"\n\nCentral Coast Mariners celebrate winning the 2023 A-League Men's Grand Final. Scott Gardiner/Getty Images\n\nAnd the memories, undoubtedly, will last forever, for Saturday's contest, long before the unorthodox trophy lift, was incredible. A contest that may never be repeated.\n\nMelbourne City 1, Central Coast Mariners 6. One of the most remarkable games in ALM history. The Mariners, the little old Mariners, are champions. A team that operates off the sniff of an oily rag and just over half a decade ago was so bad that they were almost relegated from a league that doesn't even have relegation, thumped City, a side backed by the billions and billions of the City Football Group and who have won three straight premierships.\n\nThis isn't supposed to happen. Not in the modern football age of hypercapitalism, global football groups, and other assorted modern miracles. The little guys don't get to win in the face of all this at the best of times, let alone produce a scoreline that devastatingly humbles the biggest dog in the yard in the most important game of the year.\n\nBut that's exactly what happened in Parramatta. What Montgomery calls \"the smallest club with the biggest heart\" put forth one of the most remarkable performances in Australian football history.\n\nIn transition, they were lethal, slicing through a City defence that had set club records for miserliness this season with what at times was a casual ease. When they needed to be, they were devastating in front of goal and if not for some heroics from City keeper Tom Glover, could have gone into the halftime break up 3-1 or 4-1. After City pulled it back to 2-1 just before half-time and things looked a little shaky, the Mariners dug in and defended desperately to see off the threat. And when Jacob Farrell won a penalty that Jason Cummings stepped up to convert, they were ruthless in breaking the backs of City's resistance and piling on the pain.\n\nIn what is all but certain to be his last game for the club before he jets out overseas, Cummings, now a Socceroo that has been to a World Cup after his career rescued by Montgomery, scored a hat trick, set a new Mariners record for most goals in a season, and was awarded the Joe Marston Medal for best afield. In his first season back on the Coast, back with the club that helped propel him to what was an ill-fated first crack at Europe, Samuel Silvera had a goal and an assist. Vukovic, 18 years after he was in goal for the Mariners as they lost the first-ever ALM Grand Final, is now a championship-winning captain.\n\n\"Everyone knows how much this club means to me,\" Cummings said post-game. \"Dundee let me go and [Montgomery] and the Mariners gave me the opportunity. The last year and a half has been a dream come true. I need to enjoy the moment now.\"\n\nIt's seismic. Not just because of all these narratives, which only scratch the surface of what can be told about this club, but because a result like this, a comprehensive thrashing on the league's biggest stage, represents the ultimate validation of how the Mariners have turned their club around. This was the youngest squad in the league, full of players that had either come up through their academy or moved over from others in the hope of greater opportunities. Their senior players are a collection of cast-offs, misfits, reclamation projects, journeymen, or, in Vukovic's case, players in their twilight. But they still found a way to win.\n\nThe 2022-23 ALM trophy will now stand as the ultimate proof that you don't have to be the richest club in the league, have the best facilities, bring in high-profile international talent, or spend a heap on wages to be successful. If you're smart enough, good enough, committed enough, unified enough, and, yes, lucky enough, you can still do some great things.\n\nRichard Venne of Melbourne City looks dejected following the 2023 A-League Men's Grand Final. Izhar Khan/Getty Images\n\nFor Melbourne City, however, the recriminations will begin. The narrative of their season, of their past five years, has changed with one, disastrous 90 minutes. Despite winning three-straight premierships and making four straight Grand Finals, just once have they actually secured an ALM championship in this time. In Australia, until some kind of reform happens, it's the championship that matters.\n\n\"It looked like they wanted to win the game more than us,\" said City coach Rado Vidosic.\n\n\"They outplayed us in the first half. They bullied us. They won every 50-50 ball. Even the smallest players were unbelievably committed. We just maybe thought someone else was going to do it for me, and it didn't happen.\"\n\nAnd perhaps there is also the elephant in the room that needs to be acknowledged. Twice now this season, in the women's and men's Grand Finals, a team from Melbourne has won the right to \"host,\" only to be forced to travel to Sydney to take on a NSW-based opponent under the terms of the league's deal with Destination NSW to play its deciders in the Harbour City. And both times, they have been defeated comprehensively by a team whose supporters dwarfed their own in the stadium, by a 10-1 aggregate all up.\n\nThat, however, is a conversation that probably needs a larger sample size, with next year's Grand Finals added to the data pool.

I'm disappointed, this is going to hurt us but we are definitely going to learn from it.\"\n\nCity began strongly with Danny Vukovic forced into a low save to thwart Socceroos winger Marco Tilio but things began to unravel when midfielder Valon Berisha collided with the Mariners goalkeeper.\n\nWith Berisha hobbling, the Mariners smelled blood and surged downfield through Nkololo with the French winger finding Cummings, who finished past Tom Glover.\n\nCity subbed off Berisha for van der Venne but the Mariners were attacking at will.\n\n\n\nMarco Tulio and Nkololo forced Glover into fingertip saves, but there was nothing to prevent Silvera burning past Nuno Reis on the left and finishing to make it 2-0 after 34 minutes.\n\nCity looked shellshocked but somehow finished the first half with a goal, when van der Venne fired past Vukovic in the 40th minute.\n\nThe goal before halftime seemed to shake City into action and they began the second half with intent as Mathew Leckie and van der Venne both went close to equalising.\n\nMontgomery turned to his bench, sending on home-grown leftback Jacob Farrell shortly after the hour mark.\n\nFarrell had an immediate impact as he was felled by Andrew Nabbout in the City box in the 64th minute, with referee Chris Beath pointing to the spot.\n\nCummings sent Glover the wrong way and soon had another opportunity from the spot when Callum Talbot handled a Farrell cross.\n\nThe Socceroos forward fired to the right to wrap up his hat-trick and the Mariners hadn't finished there.\n\nCity's resolve wilted and the Mariners were queuing up to score, Silvera setting up Nkololo from an inch-perfect cross before Brazilian striker Moresche completed the rout."}, {"url": "https://ccmariners.com.au/history", "page_content": "About Us\n\nInaugurated in 2004, Central Coast Mariners FC is proud to be the first ever professional sporting entity to represent the Central Coast region on a national and international sporting stage.

When a club like United come calling, and the dollar signs light up like a pinball machine, one would be foolish to not at least give the opportunity serious consideration.\n\nI am no great fan of Charlesworth. He has cut the club back to the bare minimum, failed to provide proper investment and made some crazy decisions over the years.\n\nBut he has also lost a lot of money attempting to keep the franchise afloat and, without his money, the Yellow and Navy would have sunk some time ago.\n\nIf the deal and relocation eventuates, good luck to him. But such a move would destroy any smidgin of a legacy he might have managed in the past, and it will be Australian football \u2013 and the proud Central Coast community \u2013 that will be left to count the terrible cost.\n\nSpeaking as a long-time Mariners supporter and season ticket holder, the game simply cannot allow one of the A-League\u2019s few true community clubs to be shafted, rebranded and parachuted into a Sydney region that does not really possess a sporting soul. Especially when they are top of the table for the first time in an age.\n\nAustralian football history is littered with the corpses of foreign clubs which have come here expecting to reap the financial rewards and take advantage of the country\u2019s big bank of young talent.\n\nManchester United would disenfranchise thousands of fans\n\nScottish club Rangers did it with Northern Spirit in the former National Soccer League and it did not end well. Rangers departed in haste, leaving a shell of a club that eventually played in front of 300 people at Warringah.\n\nManchester United also had a dabble on a smaller scale, investing in youth development at Parramatta Eagles before ending the relationship.\n\nEven now, United\u2019s arch-rivals and EPL champions-in-waiting Manchester City, backed by the football conglomerate that is the City Football Group, own Melbourne City in the A-League, having taken over the club known as Melbourne Heart before rebranding it.\n\nCFG have at least done some decent work with Melbourne City in both the A-League and W-League and are actively attempting to engage a wider fanbase. That said, the Victorian club have not really captured the imagination and are still very much searching for an identity.\n\nIn contrast, the Western Sydney Wanderers, at just nine years old, have shown what can be done by tapping into a local community. Granted, their on-field results of the past three or four seasons have not made for pretty reading, but the club have led the way in community engagement and spent a considerable amount money on building a state-of-the-art training and academy centre.\n\nThere is also the question of what Manchester United\u2019s owner, the Glazer family, would gain from relocating the Mariners.\n\nYes, the global influence of the United name and brand is not to be underestimated, but that does not mean United fans who follow different A-League outfits will jump ship simply to support another because their Premier League club bought it.\n\nManchester United\u2019s assistant manager Mike Phelan, seen talking to Marcus Rashford, was the Mariners\u2019 sporting director.

There is nothing to gain from it. The Central Coast football community will not cop it and, as the saying goes, lose the club and you lose the fans.\n\nUnited would disenfranchise thousands of fans with no guarantee of replacing them with anywhere near the same number in any new region.\n\nFootball is not about branding; it is about passion and community spirit \u2013 and Manchester United would do well to remember that.\n\nRay Gatt is a veteran Australian sports journalist and author who was chief football writer at The Australian for 30 years."}, {"url": "https://www.theroar.com.au/2023/06/05/the-mariners-title-win-was-the-glimmer-of-hope-a-league-fans-needed/", "page_content": "Central Coast Mariners\u2019 6-1 humiliation of Melbourne City was a reminder that no matter how incompetent the game\u2019s administration is, football always finds a way to bounce back.\n\nFresh from watching Adelaide United\u2019s Carl Veart being named Coach of the Year last week, Nick Montgomery made the A-League look stupid once again.\n\nMontgomery was ruled ineligible to win Coach of the Year \u2013 which is apparently a \u2018best and fairest\u2019 award \u2013 after he was sent off for allegedly stepping outside his technical area in a 1-1 draw with Wellington Phoenix last February.\n\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\n\nNot to worry.
