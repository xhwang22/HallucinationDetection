{"The Third Dalai Lama established the Ganden Phodrang government.": [{"url": "http://en.youth.cn/Inter_Channel/Top_News/201207/t20120702_2246463.htm", "page_content": "Not a \"spiritual leader,\" but a political figure clad in kasaya.\n\nPerhaps, the followers and supporters of the 14th Dalai Lama have seldom questioned the role of the political monk in essence in Tibetan history, nor realized what it would mean for the Tibetan people if the Dalai Lama and his clique returned to power.\n\nThe memory should unfold from 1959, in the year the Dalai Lama fled China and went into exile in India, where he set up a state apparatus called \"Tibetan government-in-exile\" run by aristocratic, nepotistic monks that collected taxes, jailed and tortured dissenters and engaged in all the usual political intrigues.\n\nWas this a myth? The monastic nobility headed by the Dalai Lama controlled all land on behalf of the \"gods\". They monopolized the common wealth by exacting tribute and labor services from peasants and herders. This system was somewhat akin to how the medieval Catholic Church exploited peasants in feudal Europe.\n\nTibetan peasants and herders had little personal freedom. Without the permission of the priests, or lamas, they could not do anything. They were considered appendages to the monastery. The peasantry lived in dire poverty while enormous wealth accumulated in the monasteries and in the Dalai Lama's palace in Lhasa.\n\nIn 1956 the Dalai Lama, fearing that \"the Chinese central government would soon move on Lhasa,\" issued an appeal for gold and jewels to construct another throne for himself. This, he argued, would help rid Tibet of \"bad omens\". One hundred and twenty tons were collected. When the Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959, he was preceded by more than 60 tons of treasure.\n\nWhat makes the \"colorful\" Dalai Lama more \"legendary\" is nothing more than his close links with the CIA.\n\nHis \"government\" set up in exile in India, at least until the 1970s, received $US1.7 million a year from the CIA.\n\nThe money was to pay for guerilla operations against the Chinese PLA, notwithstanding the Dalai Lama's public stance in support of non-violence, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.\n\nThe Dalai Lama himself was on the CIA's payroll from the late 1950s until 1974, reportedly receiving $US180,000 a year.\n\nBut apparently the guerrilla army never did more than engage in border skirmishing. As early as 1964, in fact, its effectiveness and efficiency were called into question by the CIA, which nevertheless stuck with the plan. Funds to pay this army were funnelled through the Dalai Lama and his organization, which received US$1.7 million a year, later reduced to $1.2 million. (Of this, the Dalai Lama himself was paid $186,000 a year.\n\nOne former CIA agent named Ralph McGehee, admittedly a professional thorn in the side of his former employer, alleged that the CIA has been a prime funder of the Dalai Lama's media profile as a symbol of \"meditative peace and Buddhist mindfulness.\"\n\nHowever, the romantic notions about the \"peaceful\" and \"harmonious\" Shangri-la the Dalai Lama has all along preached and boasted of should be tested against reality.\n\nWhen suddenly the words \"democracy\" and \"human rights\" entered the vocabulary of the Dalai Lama's government-in-exile in India's Dharamsala, some Western media, so intoxicated, might have cheered for it.\n\nBut Dharamsala is by no means a Shangri-la, as where Dalai Lama's commitment to \"democracy\" seems weak.\n\nAn Office of Tibet document claims \"soon after His Holiness the Dalai Lama's arrival in India, he re-established the Tibetan Government in exile, based on modern democratic principles\". Yet it took more than 30 years for an Assembly of Tibetan People's Deputies to be directly elected from among the 130,000 exiles. Of 46 assembly members, only 30 are elected. The other 16 are appointed by religious authorities or directly by the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe Dalai Lama's proposals now amount to calling for negotiations with Beijing to allow him and his exiled government to resume administrative power in an \"autonomous\", albeit larger, Tibet.\n\nThe Dalai Lama's call for international pressure on Beijing seeks only to achieve this.\n\nThe political monk has since turned to the \"underground battle\", stealthily sowing discord between Tibetans and the Han Chinese and inciting ethnic hatred, while trotting globally and lobbying for international support.\n\nThe Tibetan people deserve due respect. But the Dalai clique and his \"government-in-exile\" can only be judged from their actions and, their willingness to tell the truth."}, {"url": "http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/english/culture/2014-02/27/content_599683.htm", "page_content": "DEEP in the snowy mountains of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, legend recalls, is a blessed valley in the shape of an eight-petal lotus. Spectacular snowcapped mountains, steep gorges and alpine meadows sprinkled with wildflowers are found here. It is Shangri-La in Yunnan Province\u2019s Di-qing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.\n\nDiqing, or Deqen, sits in the transitional zone between the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Its ancient history, distinctive landforms, mysterious religions and diverse ethnic groups lend a great appeal to this faraway land.\n\nThe Gedeng Neolithic Site in Weixi County attests to human habitation as early as 7,000 years ago. And inscribed slates unearthed in the region reveal a thriving civilization dating back 2,400 years.\n\nLocated on the ancient Tea-Horse Trail, also known as the Southern Silk Road, Diqing is an intersection of exchanges between China\u2019s east and west, north and south. In addition to Tibetans, who account for one third of the local population, it is home to 25 other ethnic communities, including the Lisu, Naxi and Bai. They all live in concord with each other, while retaining their respective cultures, which have converged and co-developed over the past generations.\n\nThe Ganden Songtsen Ling Monastery, Dondrup Ling Monastery and the Dongba pictographs are among the most iconic manifestations of Diqing\u2019s diverse and mysterious folk traditions, which add brilliance to the region\u2019s scenic panorama.\n\nDiqing remained unknown to the outside world until 1933, when English writer James Hilton wrote Lost Horizon, which describes an isolated but pleasurable valley called Shangri-La whose residents of different ethnic backgrounds enjoyed peace and longevity. The novel was made into a film in 1937, and the theme song \u201cBeautiful Shangri-La\u201d then spread across the world.\n\nThe book was thought to present Shangri-La as an imaginary place. The exact location could not be identified, though a number of countries around the world have claimed it is on their territory. Now 60 years of research provide sufficient evidence that Diqing is none other than Shangri-La.\n\nThe English \u201cShangri-La\u201d sounds like it originates in the Tibetan dialect spoken in Zhongdian, capital of Diqing. In the Tibetan language, the word means \u201cmoon in one\u2019s heart.\u201d Moreover, the folklore and natural environment depicted in the novel bear a strong resemblance to Zhongdian. In 2001, the region officially changed its name to Shangri-La.\n\nDiqing boasts a wide diversity of landforms \u2013 mountains, lakes, glaciers, karsts, meadows \u2013 and climate zones, owing to its peculiar geographic location, complex geological structures and sharp altitudinal differences. What\u2019s more, the region is rich in biodiversity. Almost all plants that usually grow in the tropical, temperate and frigid zones of the northern hemisphere can be found here. The region is thus treasured as a botanical gene bank.\n\nThe Ganden Songtsen Ling Monastery\n\nShangri-La is about 200 km from Lijiang, an ancient city inhabited by the Naxi people. Heading north from Lijiang, the scenery changes dramatically with the increasing altitude. The sight of wildflowers bathed in glorious sunshine and cows and sheep grazing on the meadows lightens the heart.\n\nNo visitor to Shangri-La should miss the Ganden Songtsen Ling Monastery, known as the soul of Diqing.\n\nBuilt in 1679, at the order of the fifth Dalai Lama following an augury, it is the largest Tibetan Buddhist shrine in Yunnan Province. Rising along a hillside, this majestic complex, with its towering roofs of gilded brass tiles gleaming in the sun, along with vermilion walls, white windows and black curtains standing out against a clear blue sky, evokes a heavenly aura. This design wins it the renown of \u201cminor Potala Palace.\u201d\n\nGanden Songtsen Ling was significant for the seventh Dalai Lama Kelzang Gyatso. Before the sixth Dalai Lama Tsangyang Gyasto (1683-1708) passed away, he predicted, \u201cThe white crane will not stay afar. Someday, it will return from Litang.\u201d It turned out that his soulboy was indeed found to be born in Litang, now a county in Sichuan Province."}, {"url":

to foreign countries.\n\nZhang Yijiong, executive vice minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), speaks at a press conference held by the press center of the 19th CPC National Congress in Beijing, capital of China, Oct. 21, 2017. The press conference was themed on the united front work and the external work of the CPC. [Photo: Xinhua]\n\nSpeaking at a press conference on the sidelines of the 19th CPC National Congress, executive deputy head of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee Zhang Yijiong urged foreign governments to exercise \"caution in both words and deeds.\"\n\n\"The 14th Dalai Lama is not only a religious figure, but also a political one,\" Zhang said.\n\nThe aim of the so-called \"Tibetan government-in-exile\" organized by him in a foreign country in 1959 is, in essence, seeking \"Tibet independence\" and splitting the motherland, according to the official.\n\n\"As head of the group, the 14th Dalai Lama has never stopped his activities in this regard over the past decades,\" Zhang said.\n\n\"No country in the world recognizes the so-called 'Tibetan government-in-exile,'\" he said, noting that although individual officials in some countries had received the Dalai Lama, their countries do not recognize the group.\n\n\"The Chinese government opposes governments and organizations in any country in the world to receive the Dalai Lama in any name,\" said the official.\n\n\"We consider such visit as a severe insult to the feelings of the Chinese people and a deviation from their commitment to recognizing the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government representing the whole of China,\" he warned.\n\n\"So we hope governments around the world exercise caution in both words and deeds and give full consideration to their friendship with China and their respect for China's sovereignty,\" he added.\n\nZhang said there has been a decreasing number of countries receiving the Dalai Lama in their official capacity in recent years and the Dalai Lama could only manage to give lectures in universities or hold

"page_content": "China said Monday that no concessions would be made on issues concerning the national sovereignty following talks between central government officials and private envoys of the Dalai Lama. \"The unification of the motherland, territorial integrity and the national dignity are the greatest interests of the Chinese people. We will never make a concession,\" Zhu Weiqun, executive vice minister of the United Front Work Department (UFWD) of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, told reporters.\n\nThe Dalai Lama's private representatives, Lodi Gyari and Kelsang Gyaltsen, were in China from October 31 to November 5, during which period Zhu, UFWD Vice Minister Sita and Executive Vice Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region Pelma Trilek held talks with them.\n\nDu Qinglin, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, also met with them.\n\nThis is the ninth round of talks between Chinese central government officials and the Dalai Lama's private envoys since 2002 and the third round of talks this year.\n\nZhu admitted contacts and talks \"failed to make progress\". He said the Dalai Lama side should \"shoulder full responsibility for that\".\n\nAsked to comment on the reports in which the Dalai Lama said he would not follow a so-called \"middle way\" if the talks failed, Zhu said the claim of \"middle way\" aimed at outright Tibetan independence and thus unacceptable to the central government.\n\nThe Dalai Lama put forward the idea of \"middle way\" in the 1980s.\n\nZhu said the Dalai Lama explained the approach many times, including in the \"five-point peace plan\" in 1987, the \"seven-point new suggestions\" in 1988 and a \"Memorandum\" tabled to the central government by his private representatives during the recent talks.\n\nZhu said those remarks and documents showed that the Dalai Lama's \"middle way\" had five basic features. \"The first is that the Dalai Lama does not acknowledge that Tibet is part of China since ancient times.\"\n\n\"The Dalai Lama said on many occasions that when the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) entered Tibet, Tibet was an independent country and now Tibet is still an independent country, which was illegally occupied,\" Zhu said.\n\nHe said it is known to all people with some historical knowledge that the Chinese central authorities have exerted undisputable and effective administration over Tibet since the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368).\n\n\"By denying China's sovereignty over Tibet, the Dalai Lama is seeking a legal basis for his activities of 'Tibet independence', 'semi-independence and 'independence in a disguised form',\" Zhu said.\n\n'Secondly, the Dalai Lama is scheming for a 'Greater Tibet', which has never existed,\" he said.\n\nZhu said the so-called \"Greater Tibet\" included not only the whole Tibet Autonomous Region, but also a large territory of Qinghai Province, Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Gannan in Gansu Province, Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Garze and Aba in Sichuan Province, Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Deqen in Yunnan Province and some other areas.\n\n\"In total, it covers one fourth of China's entire territory,\" Zhu said.\n\nZhu said Tibetan areas outside Tibet had never been under the administration of Tibet's local government. When Tibet was peacefully liberated in 1951, the jurisdiction of the local Tibet government did not exceed the current area of the Tibet Autonomous Region.\n\nZhu said the attempt at a \"Greater Tibet\" also harbors malicious intentions.\n\n\"China is a country in which various ethnic groups live together. If ethnic groups in China all ask for an autonomous region in which only people of their own groups could live, the whole country would be cast into chaos,\" he said.\n\nZhu said the third feature of the \"middle way\" was to overthrow the current social and political system in the Tibet Autonomous Region under the pretense of \"high degree of autonomy\".\n\nThe official said the Dalai Lama and key supporters had said on many occasions that a \"high degree of autonomy\" meant that except for diplomatic and military affairs, all political, economic, cultural, educational and religious affairs should be subject to the administration of Tibetans.\n\nIn that case, feudal serfdom would be re-established over one-fourth of the Chinese territory, he said.\n\nZhu said the fourth feature was that it asked the central government to withdraw the PLA from \"Greater Tibet\" area.\n\n\"Everybody knows that the army is a basic guarantee of territorial integrity, national security and social stability,\" Zhu said. \"I believe not a single nation would agree to withdraw its own army from its own territory.\"\n\nZhu said the fifth feature of the \"middle way\" is the exclusion of other ethnic groups from the area of \"Greater Tibet\".\n\nZhu said the Dalai Lama's \"five-point peace plan\" stated clearly that the migration of other ethnic groups to Tibet must be curbed and the Han migrants must leave Tibet.\n\nThat means, once the Dalai Lama retained power in Tibet, racial discrimination, segregation and purges would be inevitable, Zhu said.\n\nThe official urged the Dalai Lama to \"do some good things for the country and the people including the Tibetans\". He reiterated that the door for the Dalai Lama's return to a patriotic stance had always been open and would remain open.\n\n\"But the door for 'Tibet independence', 'half independence' and 'independence in a disguised form' had never been open, nor would it be open in the future,\" he said."}, {"url": "http://en.youth.cn/Inter_Channel/Top_News/201112/t20111206_1798855.htm", "page_content": "The recent self-immolations of monks and nuns in Tibetan-inhabited areas of southwest China's Sichuan province are linked to overseas plots, a Chinese Tibetologist wrote in a signed article.\n\nThe self-immolations took place at four Tibetan Buddhism temples, and most of them occurred at the Kirti Monastery in the province's Aba Tibetan and Qiang autonomous prefecture.\n\n\"We have learned what is behind these events,\" Zhang Yun, a researcher with the China Tibetology Research Center, wrote in an article published by the Xinhua News Agency.\n\nThe living Buddha of the Kirti Monastery, who fled in 1959 and has since lived in Dharamsala, India, has long exerted influence over the monastery, Zhang wrote. The living Buddha used to serve as a private secretary to the 14th Dalai Lama and religious head of the \"Tibetan government-in-exile.\"\n\nAfter the deadly rioting in Lhasa on March 14, 2008, monks who fled the monastery established a \"coordination team\" to mastermind and organize operations.\n\nScandals have surfaced claiming some people bought the bodies involved in the self-immolations, he wrote in the article.\n\n\"People are repulsed and angered by the masterminds, supporters and eulogists of the self-immolations, as they feel sad and sorry for the loss of young lives,\" Zhang wrote.\n\nBuddhism asks its adherents to have charity in their hearts and a fundamental discipline of not killing any living thing. \"Tibetan Buddhism has held a fine tradition for this,\" he wrote.\n\nHowever, the cruel behavior of some monks during the Lhasa riots and the recent self-immolations tarnished the image of Tibetan Buddhism in the minds of ordinary people in regards to its no killing precept, Zhang said.\n\nIn his article, Zhang wrote that many heart-wrenching scenes emerged from the self-immolation incidents in Sichuan's Tibetan areas: young monks set themselves aflame after being pushed to do so by senior monks; police officers and medical staff rushed to save lives, but the monks tried to disrupt their efforts; the parents of the injured parties begged for the release of their children while the monks were left as victims of their own devices.\n\n\"These self-immolations not only brought into question whether these monasteries had obeyed the fundamental precepts of Buddhism, but also whether they occupy the bottom moral rung of being human,\" he wrote.\n\nSelf-immolation, abetting such activities, looting and buying bodies -- all these acts have prompted people to question the nature of these monasteries, he said.\n\n\"If the senior monks couldn't teach young monks to be benevolent, and the young monks couldn't abide by the precepts, how can they practice the responsibility of saving mankind? How could any parent trust them with their children?\" Zhang wrote.\n\nAccording to Western media reports, young monks and nuns shouted \"Free Tibet\" and \"Tibet independence\" before setting themselves ablaze. These actions show that not only were these self-immolation attempts politically-motivated but also that these people were ignorant of history, Zhang wrote.\n\nPeople with even a modicum of common sense should know that Sichuan is not part of Tibet, he wrote, adding that even in the Simla Convention, an illegal document drafted by the British government in 1913 and 1914 in an attempt to achieve \"Tibetan independence\", which the central authorities refused to sign, the Tibetan-inhabited areas of Sichuan were included in the territory of the Republic of China.\n\nAttempts to realize the \"independence of Tibet\" during past imperialistic invasions have all failed, and nowadays it goes against the progress of history to advocate for \"Tibet independence,\" Zhang wrote.\n\nInstigating separatism is against the will of the people as well as the fine anti-imperialistic and patriotic traditions carried on by the Tibetan people throughout modern history, he wrote.\n\nAfter the Opium Wars broke out in 1840, people of the Tibetan and Qiang ethnic groups in Sichuan marched to the front lines in the southeast coastal areas to fight British invaders under the instructions of the Qing Dynasty.\n\nIn February 1842, nearly 2,000 Tibetan and Qiang soldiers used their own horses and equipment to fight against foreign invaders.\n\nTibetan people also made great efforts in assisting the Red Army during the Long March which lasted from 1934-1935."}, {"url": "http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/ctenglish/2018/hotspots/70y/journey/201909/t20190929_800180106.html", "page_content": "ON October 1, 2019, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) ushers in the 70th anniversary of its founding. Over the past 70 years, the PRC has developed from the state of poverty and emptiness in 1949 to being the second largest economy in the world which is flourishing with a strong national identity. The great achievements that have been made are mainly the results of the persistent hard work of Chinese people. At the same time, China has adhered to a foreign policy of resolutely defending its national sovereignty and fundamental interests, maintaining a sound national development environment, and continuously contributing to world peace.\n\n1949-1978: Safeguarding Independence\n\nOctober 1, 1949 witnessed the founding ceremony of the PRC held in Beijing. Mao Zedong, chairman of the Central People\u2019s Government, solemnly declared to the world that \u201cthe Chinese people have stood up.\u201d Having been oppressed by colonialism and imperialism since 1840, the old China had no independent policies. Therefore, the PRC, right at the beginning of handling its international relations, was determined to fundamentally change the humiliating way in which the late Qing government and the Republic of China government had conducted diplomacy.\n\nAt the 26th United Nations General Assembly on October 25, 1971, the People\u2019s Republic of China regains its legitimate seat in the UN by an overwhelming majority by vote. Qiao Guanhua, head of the Chinese delegation to the UN conference, and Huang Hua, deputy head, share a hearty laugh.\n\nThe new China first of all took a diplomatic path to peace, and implemented \u201cthree major policies\u201d \u2013 completely breaking with the old Chinese government\u2019s diplomacy, eliminating the remaining imperialist and colonial forces, and firmly standing on the side of the socialist camp and the peace-loving people of the world. An independent diplomatic strategy was accordingly established.\n\nThe PRC was founded at the beginning of the Cold War, arousing panic and hostility in the imperialist camp headed by the U.S., which adopted a foreign policy of containment and hostility towards China, refusing to give recognition to the PRC. Nevertheless, since it represented world justice, the new China quickly won the recognition of the socialist camp and some other countries, and established formal diplomatic relations with more than a dozen countries in the first year (There were only about 60 sovereign states in the world at that time).\n\nWhen the new China had just started its national construction, the Korean War broke out, and the U.S., taking advantage of it, manipulatively set up the United Nations Command to launch the war of aggression against North Korea. They first sent the seventh fleet into the Taiwan Strait, and quickly brought the war to the Yalu River on the Sino-Korean border, seriously jeopardizing the national security of China. To defend the newly established country, the Chinese People\u2019s Volunteer Army crossed the Yalu River in October 1950 to resist U.S. aggression and aid North Korea. After three years of joint fierce and bloody counterattacking of the Chinese and North Korean armies, setting the military demarcation line near the 38th parallel, the U.S. was forced to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement in July 1953. China tided over the grim \u201csurvival test.\u201d\n\nAs the Korean War drew to an end, tensions in East Asia eased and the pace of national construction of new China sped up. In order to promote the development of China\u2019s foreign relations, Zhou Enlai, then premier and foreign minister of China, put forward the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which was announced to the world in the Joint Statements between China and India, and between China and Myanmar. These principles immediately sparked support from the global community, and the peaceful image and diplomatic strategy of a new China were widely applauded. Since then, China\u2019s diplomacy has developed rapidly. By 1965, formal diplomatic relations were established with 45 countries, including France, a Western power, in 1964.\n\nOn February 21, 1972, U.S. President Nixon visits China at the invitation of Zhou Enlai, premier of the People\u2019s Republic of China. China-U.S. relations, which had been handicapped by confrontations for more than 20 years, enter a new chapter.\n\nIn the 1960s, new China\u2019s diplomacy continued to encounter severe challenges. First, in the socialist camp, the Soviet Union carried out a policy of \u201cgreat-power chauvinism\u201d to interfere with China\u2019s sovereignty and independence. New China resolutely safeguarded its sovereign independence and national dignity by resisting the Soviet Union\u2019s great-power chauvinism. As a result, the Soviet Union withdrew its experts and specialists from China and tore up contracts to exert pressure, finally resulting in the breakdown of Sino-Soviet relations. Second, following its failure in the Korean War, the U.S. did not change its policy of hostility and containment. Besides continuing to interfere in China\u2019s internal affairs concerning Taiwan, it sent armed forces into southern Vietnam. In 1965, a U.S. mass aggression against Vietnam broke out. China\u2019s national security was seriously threatened by U.S. aggression in the south.\n\nDuring this period, new China adhered to its independent foreign policy, against both the U.S. and Soviet Union, and became an important force that could not be ignored in the international political arena. A strategic triangular relationship accordingly took shape among the U.S., the Soviet Union and China. As the U.S. plunged into the quagmire of the Vietnam War, the Soviet Union strengthened its international expansion, and the rivalry for hegemonic domination between the Soviet Union and the U.S. was formed as the Soviet Union gained the upper hand.\n\nIn July 1971, Henry Kissinger, the then U.S. National Security Advisor, secretly visited China. In October of that year, China resumed its legitimate membership in the United Nations. In February 1972, U.S. President Richard Nixon paid an official visit to China. New China soon established diplomatic relations with dozens of countries, including Italy, Canada, Britain, West Germany, and Japan. China\u2019s strategic security environment was improved and China\u2019s diplomacy witnessed great development, and this momentum was sustained during the following years.\n\nThis phase lasted for 29 years, and new China\u2019s diplomacy greatly contributed to achieving the historical mission of gaining independence. By the end of 1978, 101 countries had established formal diplomatic relations with China at the ambassadorial level. Independence is a distinct feature of China\u2019s diplomacy at this stage.\n\n1978-2012: Peaceful Development\n\nAt the end of 1978, the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to shift the focus of the national work to economic construction, a great historical turning point that initiated the grand era of \u201creform and opening-up\u201d which had enormous impacts on China as a nation. To enable its people to live a comfortable life, China needed to focus on the economic construction, open up to the outside world and implement reforms to realize high-speed economic growth. To align with the national strategy, China\u2019s diplomacy made unique innovations, ensuring that China\u2019s economic construction had a peaceful environment, and meanwhile facilitating China to develop economic, trade, science and technology, cultural, and other relations with other countries in an all-round way.\n\nOn April 26, 2019, Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan host a banquet in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing to welcome foreign leaders and guests attending the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation.\n\nSince 1980, the independent foreign policy of peace has been defined as the general and principal foreign policy of China. Under this policy framework, China adopted the policy of non-alignment, which means that China will never be dependent on any superpower, nor will it form alliance or strategic relations with any of them. China also put forward a series of forward-looking diplomatic theories, such as that peace and development are the two major themes of the contemporary world; that the jeopardy of war should not be ignored even though the possibility is low \u2013 the forces of peace to contain war got remarkably stronger at that time; that the two superpowers dare not wage war easily; and that efforts should be made to support third world countries in developing their national economy, to improve North-South relations, and develop South-South cooperation.\n\nChina and the U.S. established diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level on January 1, 1979. The thaw in Sino-Soviet relations began to emerge after 1982. In May 1989, General Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev visited China, marking the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations. China had thus achieved the goal of improving its relationship with the world\u2019s important strategic forces in an all-round way. Within the decade from January 1979 to the end of May 1989, 27 more countries established formal diplomatic relations with China, raising the number of countries with diplomatic ties with China to 128 (there were about 170 sovereign countries in the world by then). China had also established economic and trade relations with most countries and regions in the world. China\u2019s international status was further enhanced as a result.\n\nAfter 1989, the Western countries led by the U.S. imposed comprehensive sanctions on China. China\u2019s diplomacy faced severe challenges following the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe, the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the collapse of the bipolar structure and the deterioration of the international environment. However, China withstood the test, as the country did not waver in upholding the policy of reform and opening-up, and continued to press on with development. Politically, China adhered to the track of a socialist market economy. China\u2019s diplomacy won the support of most countries in the world, and prompted those countries that imposed sanctions on China to gradually change their policies. China broke the blockade of the West, and entered a period of relatively rapid development.\n\nIn 1997 and 1999, Hong Kong and Macao returned to the motherland smoothly, practicing the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy. The relationship between China and international organizations had been developing steadily. After more than 10 years of diplomatic negotiations, China formally joined the WTO in December 2001, signifying its deeper integration into the world economy. China established economic and trade relations with almost every country and region in the world. Since then, China\u2019s economy has experienced rapid development. In 2008, China took the position as the world\u2019s largest industrial country, and then surpassed Japan to become the world\u2019s second largest economy in 2010.\n\nDuring this period spanning 34 years, China\u2019s diplomacy made important contributions to the realization of the historical task of achieving prosperity. By the end of 2012, China had established diplomatic relations with 172 countries (the number of sovereign countries in the world at that time was about 200). Peaceful development was a distinct feature of China\u2019s diplomacy at this stage.\n\n2012-2019: Win-win Cooperation\n\nSince the 18th National Congress of the CPC, the CPC Central Committee, under the leadership of Xi Jinping, has led the whole Party and the people of China into a new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics. This new era is one of realizing the Chinese Dream, strengthening national power, and making great contributions to the world. The CPC Central Committee, with Xi Jinping at its core, grasps the general trend of China\u2019s and world\u2019s development in the new era, and moves China closer to the center of the world stage, making China a great diplomatic power for championing world development and maintaining world peace.\n\nThis new era has just started and will last for some time to come, but a series of theoretical and practical innovations have been made in the work of foreign affairs.\n\nIn June 2018, at the Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs, Xi Jinping\u2019s thinking on diplomacy with Chinese characteristics for a new era was officially put forward, as an important part of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and a major theoretical achievement of the CPC Central Committee\u2019s political thought on governing the country in the diplomatic field.\n\nXi Jinping\u2019s profound thinking on diplomacy includes the following major elements:\n\nA Community of Shared Future for Mankind. Since 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping has proposed to establish a community of shared future for mankind at many diplomatic activities. On January 18, 2017, Xi delivered a keynote speech at the United Nations Office in Geneva, Switzerland, entitled \u201cWork Together to Build a Community of Shared Future for Mankind.\u201d In the speech, he pointed out that China will stay committed to building a community of shared future for mankind to achieve shared and win-win development, and building a world of lasting peace through dialogue and consultation, a world of common security for all through joint efforts, a world of common prosperity through win-win cooperation, an open and inclusive world through exchanges and mutual learning, and a clean and beautiful world by pursuing green and low-carbon development. The concept of building a community of shared future for mankind is of worldwide significance, and will certainly have a far-reaching impact on international relations and human development.\n\nUpholding justice while pursuing shared interests. In many diplomatic activities since 2013, Xi has emphasized the importance of upholding justice while pursuing shared interests. To do so, according to Xi, we should, at the political level, uphold the principles of fairness, justice and equality among nations, abide by the basic norms governing international relations, oppose hegemonic and power politics, and object to harming the interests of others and destroying regional peace and stability for the sake of one\u2019s own interest; and at the economic level, we should take actions that bring mutual benefits and lead to win-win solutions. China has the obligation to provide assistance to neighboring and developing countries within the limits of its own resources. It is necessary to work for justice at the expense of self-interest and fulfill these obligations despite an unfavorable calculus in financial terms.\n\nThe Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is based on the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits. When Xi visited Kazakhstan in September 2013, he raised the idea of the Silk Road Economic Belt. Later during his visit to Indonesia in October, he put forward the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road initiative. These ideas have been warmly received by many countries. The core of Xi Jinping\u2019s thinking on diplomacy is a community of a shared future for mankind. In order to achieve this goal, we need to take a series of governance approaches represented by the BRI, and implement them in a down-to-earth manner to promote the advancement of human society towards a bright future.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned, Xi\u2019s thinking on diplomacy also includes such ideas as win-win international relations, sincere and cordial relations with Africa and developing countries, coordinated land and marine development, and a new-type of major country relations.\n\nChina\u2019s diplomacy in the new era has achieved fruitful results, and bilateral relations have continued to expand. By mid-2019, China had established formal diplomatic relations with 178 countries. Multilateral diplomacy is dynamic, and China has made great efforts to promote the Paris Agreement that was reached at the end of 2016. China dispatches the largest number of UN peace-keeping forces among the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. China has also made tremendous contributions to addressing regional hot issues, such as the North Korean nuclear issue, the South China Sea issue, the Syrian issue, the Iranian nuclear issue, the fight against global diseases, and poverty eradication.\n\nSummit diplomacy plays an important role. From 2013 to 2018, President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang respectively visited a dozen countries and participated in four to seven international summits a year on average. They have played a unique and irreplaceable role in displaying China\u2019s image, promoting Chinese conceptions and perspectives, implementing China\u2019s propositions, developing friendly relations with other countries in the world, and dealing with and solving major bilateral, regional, and global complex problems.\n\nThe scale of host diplomacy is unprecedented. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in November 2012, China has hosted many signature events of global or regional importance. They include: the fourth summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building in Asia (CICA) held in Shanghai in May 2014, the 22nd APEC Informal Leaders\u2019 Meeting held in Beijing in November 2014, the G20 Leaders Meeting held in Hangzhou in September 2016, the 18th Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit held in Qingdao in June 2018, the Beijing Summit of the 2018 CACF held in September 2018, and the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation held in Beijing in May 2017 and April 2019 respectively.\n\nIn the new era, China is steadily and rapidly moving towards the center of the world diplomatic arena. It safeguards the international environment for China\u2019s peaceful development and world peace in general. It is making efforts to contribute to the future development of the world. Win-win cooperation is a distinct feature of China\u2019s diplomacy at this stage.\n\nZHANG LILI is a professor with the China Foreign Affairs University."}, {"url": "https://www.bbrtv.com/2021/0730/663408.html", "page_content": "New Tibet, the rising 'Roof of the World'\n\nupdatetime:2021-07-30 12:19:15 Views\uff1a 0 Source\uff1aXinhua\n\nThere are very few places on this earth where humanity can transcend the boundaries of race and nationality, where one can go beyond the human perspective and understand that we are one with the universe.\n\nTibet is one such destination.\n\n\"There's natural beauty around the world, but Tibet is an example of real natural beauty,\" said American economist David Blair. \"It's great to have an opportunity to see.\"\n\n\"It's very spiritual,\" said Shaun Rein, another American expat living in China and founder of a Shanghai-based market research firm.\n\nInvited by Xinhua's China Chat show, Blair and Rein spent a week in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region on a fact-finding mission to acquire firsthand experience of the lives of everyday Tibetans, local socioeconomic development, and the real face of new Tibet, possibly one of the most misunderstood places in the world.\n\nThis year marks the 70th anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet. On May 23, 1951, the central government of the People's Republic of China, then still in its infancy, signed an agreement with the local government of Tibet on the peaceful liberation of the region, helping the people of Tibet break free from the fetters of imperialist invaders for good.\n\nA subsequent democratic reform in the late 1950s abolished theocracy and feudal serfdom in Tibet. The 14th Dalai Lama, clinging jealously to the system of serfdom and slavery that dominated old Tibet, fled China in the wake of a failed coup to resist the reform.\n\nThese great changes, as noted in the late American journalist Israel Epstein's 1983 book Tibet Transformed, \"were profoundly emancipatory, physically and mentally, for the overwhelming majority of Tibetans.\"\n\nWith strong support from the central government and the rest of China, and boosted by the great endeavors of people of all ethnic groups in the region, Tibet is catching up with other parts of the country in terms of socioeconomic development.\n\nA new modern socialist Tibet that is united, prosperous, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful is taking shape, underpinned by sustained stability and rapid development.\n\nCONNECTIVITY: ROADS, INTERNET AND INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nHaving lived in China for most of the past 24 years and having first traveled to Tibet in 2001, Shaun Rein, founder and managing director of China Market Research Group, had feared his return to the region would be a journey back in time to the Tibet of old, to a region left behind by the rest of the country.\n\n\"Tibet was so poor when I came here the first time,\" Rein said, recalling long bumpy journeys along winding dirt roads that left him clutching for a barf bag.\n\nBefore his return to Tibet, Rein planned for the worst and told his team they would probably not be able to reach him due to a lack of access to phone or Internet.\n\nYet Rein was in for a pleasant surprise. Today, fast highways connect the capital city of Lhasa to other smaller cities throughout the region, while cell phone towers dot the landscape providing incredible Internet speeds.\n\nRein was shocked by the changes in Tibet's transport sector over the last 20 years, even if they paled in comparison to those witnessed by Epstein as he took a grinding 12-day trip by jeep and truck convoy from Chengdu in Sichuan Province to Lhasa in 1955.\n\n\"Even that seemed wonderfully speedy then,\" Epstein wrote, recalling his first visit to Tibet in his book. \"For thousands of years in the past, the only transport had been by yak or mule caravan -- six months being considered good time for the trip.\"\n\nSince 1951, Tibet has gradually built a comprehensive transport network composed of highways, railways and air routes.\n\nAccording to a white paper issued by China's State Council Information Office in May, 118,800 km of highways have been built, providing access to all administrative villages in the region. Ninety-four percent of towns and 76 percent of administrative villages now have direct access to asphalt and concrete roads.\n\nBuilding and fixing roads in Tibet can be very costly, and many of the roads are underused due to the low population density in more remote parts of the region, according to Dong Gengyun, a Beijing official who has been sent to Lhasa on a three-year assignment to support Tibet's development.\n\n\"But we have to do it, because we're not here for sightseeing, but to help develop the local economy and improve people's livelihoods,\" Dong said.\n\nDavid Blair, vice president and senior economist at the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization, regards infrastructure spending as critical because it allows people to run businesses. In Tibet, he saw people setting up B&Bs and even innovation centers.\n\n\"In many remote areas of the United States, you cannot get high-speed Internet either by wireless or wired network, and there's no incentive to provide it,\" Blair said, amazed by the \"great 4G connectivity in a little village in the middle of Tibet.\"\n\nOPPORTUNITY: TEENS, PILGRIMS AND ENTREPRENEURS\n\nThere was not a single school in the modern sense of the word in old Tibet. The illiteracy rate exceeded 95 percent, to say nothing of the complete lack of understanding of modern science and technology.\n\nFounded in 1956 with only 20 to 30 students, Lhasa Middle School in the downtown area of the city is the first modern and standard middle school in the history of Tibet.\n\nAt present, the school has some 3,000 students, with Tibetan students accounting for about 62 percent, said Tang Yong, the school's principal, adding that most of the students aspire to one day attend college.\n\nFrom 1951 to 2020, the central government invested 224 billion yuan (about 35 billion U.S. dollars) in Tibet's education. Now, the region has established a modern educational system which includes preschool, primary and middle schools, vocational and technical schools, institutions of higher learning, and special education institutions.\n\nAccording to Gong Xiaotang, Party secretary of the Lhasa No. 2 Secondary Vocational School, Tibet has taken the lead in China in providing students with 15 years of publicly funded compulsory education.\n\nStudents at the vocational school have a wide variety of courses to choose from, including cooking, traditional Tibetan clothing and medicine production, thangka painting, and other disciplines. The school is also teaching hotel management, accounting, advertisement design and drone operation.\n\n\"I was impressed by the kids. They were learning a skill that was going to make them money, and they seem to understand that at a very young age,\" Blair said. \"And I was amazingly impressed by how much these kids knew, how hardworking they were, and how dedicated they are to building their own futures.\"\n\nThe American economist was also struck by a maker's center in Lunang, Nyingchi City, where primary students are taught to use computers and 3D printers.\n\n\"They're creating a spirit of dynamism in the young kids, and that's going to pay off,\" Blair said, noting that the youngsters will grow up dreaming of being innovators, building businesses and taking advantage of economic opportunities.\n\nBarkhor Street, which circles the Jokhang Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage site and part of the historic ensemble of the Potala Palace, is the most famous pilgrim circuit in Lhasa and is always packed with pilgrims from across the region. The faithful complete the circuit clockwise, spinning their prayer wheels in the same direction.\n\nThere are more than 1,700 sites for Tibetan Buddhist activities with 46,000 monks and nuns in Tibet, while traditional religious activities are carried out regularly in accordance with the law.\n\nEvery year, large sums of money are spent by the government on the renovation and maintenance of the Potala Palace to ensure that the pilgrims have a safe environment where they can practice their religion, according to Jorden, director of the administrative office of the Potala Palace.\n\n\"We saw many people still retain their religious ideals, while at the same time, they don't want to be poor because of that,\" Blair said.\n\nThis sentiment was echoed by Rein, who found that the religious beliefs of Tibetan locals have proven no obstacle to bringing about economic prosperity. \"I don't think there's a disconnection or conflict between the two.\"\n\nIn 2020, the per capita disposable income of people in Tibet was double the figure from 2010. The average per capita disposable income of rural residents enjoyed double-digit growth over the past 18 years, while that of urban residents in 2020 reached 41,156 yuan, a year-on-year increase of 10 percent.\n\nRein believed the most impressive part of the trip was seeing the rise of the middle class in Tibet, as a growing number of locals bid farewell to poverty. \"When you have a vibrant middle class, you have a vibrant, sustainable and successful society,\" he said.\n\nThe Tibet Yougecang Enterprise, a Tibetan incense producer with fewer than 60 employees, has received a 50-million-yuan line of credit from the Agricultural Bank of China, according to Dawa, the enterprise's deputy general manager.\n\nHaving seen the implementation of Beijing's policy supporting small businesses and encouraging mass entrepreneurship in Tibet, Rein and Blair were optimistic about the future development of the region as well as the Chinese economy.\n\nHowever, finding a viable business model remains the greatest challenge for Tibet, so that the region can ultimately wean itself off support from the rest of the country, Blair noted.\n\nREALITY: A FAREWELL TO LIES AND SLANDER\n\nWhile Epstein wrote of a rekindled enthusiasm and passion for life among ordinary Tibetans since the democratic reform, Rein and Blair observed a Tibet far removed from its portrayal in Western media.\n\nRein and Blair saw for themselves the bilingual signs and software used by doctors to write out diagnoses for patients at the Tibetan Medicine Hospital of Tibet Autonomous Region, as well as students learning Tibetan language in a classroom in Lhasa Middle School.\n\n\"It was very clear that the government is doing a pretty good job at protecting Tibetan culture and Tibetan language,\" Rein said, adding that he was upset with the baseless accusations made by former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his successor Antony Blinken.\n\n\"I don't like the false narrative that Blinken is perpetuating after Pompeo, which a lot of U.S. media are talking about simply because China wants to create a unified, patriotic country,\" Rein said.\n\nThe term also bothered Blair, who mentioned that such grave accusations should not be made so lightly. \"I don't think there's anything like that going on, so we should take that term off the table,\" he said.\n\nThe population of Tibet has increased from 1.23 million in 1959 to 3.5 million in 2019, with ethnic Tibetan people accounting for over 90 percent of the region's total. The average life expectancy in Tibet reached a record high of 71.1 in 2020, double the figure from 1951.\n\nChina attaches great importance to the protection and development of traditional Tibetan culture, with the study and use of the Tibetan language protected by law. The region now has 16 periodicals and 12 newspapers in the Tibetan language, and has published more than 40 million copies of 7,185 Tibetan-language books. In addition, the language is widely used in the sectors of health, postal services, communications, transport, finance, and science and technology.\n\nThe disconnect between the region's flourishing cultural scene and its depiction in Western circles was described by Albert Ettinger, a Tibet researcher from Luxembourg, in his 2015 book Battleground Tibet as \"stories from wonderland.\" These tall tales seek to conflate unprecedented population growth with \"genocide\" and a cultural renaissance with \"cultural genocide.\"\n\nRein and Blair also found that younger Tibetans seem to be the most optimistic of all the different segments of society, thanks to the great advancements made in the quality of life of locals.\n\nAs the first two foreigners to visit the Zam Hydropower Station along the Yarlung Zangbo River, the largest plant of its kind in Tibet, they were glad to see the balance struck between development and environmental protection.\n\nThe hydropower plant currently provides 30 percent to 35 percent of Tibet's energy needs, saving some 400,000 tonnes of diesel oil every year, according to Liu Feng, who is in charge of its operation. In addition, hundreds of millions of yuan has been spent to ensure fish can safely bypass the facility and swim back upstream.\n\n\"If people's livelihoods are to be improved, the region needs to have sufficient electricity,\" Liu said. \"People should not demonize the utilization of hydroelectric energy.\"\n\nSince 1978 when China started its reform and opening-up push, the Communist Party of China Central Committee has held seven national meetings on Tibet, making major decisions and plans for the region.\n\nChina began to provide pairing-up support for Tibet in 1994, with central government departments, other provinces and equivalent administrative units along with centrally administered state-owned enterprises offering paired assistance through 6,330 projects, representing a total investment of 52.7 billion yuan by 2020. A total of 9,682 outstanding officials were selected and dispatched to assist the region during the period.\n\nAccording to Rein, these policies show that the whole country has been trying to progress and work together to build a strong China.\n\n\"You don't see, say in the United States, where a wealthy state like California is sending some of their tax money to poor states like West Virginia,\" he said. \"And that's why they are falling further and further behind under the income level.\"\n\nIn comparison, China, Rein noted, \"doesn't want to leave any provinces behind.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb Editor\uff1aMXJ"}, {"url": "http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/english/culture/2017-07/31/content_744393.htm", "page_content": "Celebrating the Yogurt Festival\n\nACCORDING to the Tibetan calendar, the Shoton Festival is traditionally celebrated from the end of the sixth month to the beginning of the seventh month in areas inhabited by people of Tibetan ethnicity, such as Tibet, Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan. Following the Tibetan New Year, the Shoton Festival is one of the most important festivals for Tibetans. In the Tibetan language, \u201cShoton\u201d means \u201cyogurt banquet\u201d; therefore, the festival is also known as the Yogurt Festival. During the celebration, people can watch Tibetan Opera and worship giant Buddha images painted on Thangka scrolls. As such, the festival is also called the \u201cFestival of Tibetan Opera\u201d and the \u201cSunning of the Buddha.\u201d\n\nTibetan Opera is a performance art which combines drama, dance, music, and rhyming lines. Performers dance and sing to extend their propitious wishes to the audience.\n\nThe traditional Shoton Festival celebrations start with the ceremony of the Sunning of the Buddha and feature activities such as Tibetan Opera performances, horse shows, and yak racing. The celebrations are normally held in Norbulingka in the western suburb of Lhasa. During the festival, Norbulingka and its surrounding woods resemble a newly built city with colorful tents, bustling streets, and busy markets. Everyone sings and dances passionately, with the accompanying music played on Tibetan musical instruments. These are the most vibrant days for local Tibetan people.\n\nThe Shoton Festival was officially added to China\u2019s Intangible Cultural Heritage list in 2006.\n\nOrigin and Development\n\nThe Shoton Festival originated in the middle of the 11th century as a purely religious activity.\n\nIt is said that a major taboo of Buddhism is to kill living beings. However, as the weather begins to grow warm in the summer, the trees and grass start to grow and hibernating insects wake up. As such, it\u2019s difficult to avoid killing these small creatures when the monks walk outside the monastery. Therefore, the Gelug, one of the schools of Tibetan Buddhism, stipulated that monks must stay in monasteries for studying and worship from the fourth to sixth month of the Tibetan calendar, and are only allowed to go outside at the end of the sixth month. On the day the ban is lifted, the monks go out and travel down the mountains. People make yogurt and hold banquets for the visiting monks, during which they can also appreciate Tibetan Opera performances. This marks the origin of the Shoton Festival.\n\nThe Sunning of the Buddha, also known as the Buddha-basking Ceremony, is the most eye-catching prelude to the Shoton Festival.\n\nBy the second half of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th century, the theocratic system had been strengthened in Tibet, as the Qing imperial government formally granted the fifth generation of Dalai, then leader of the Gelug sect of Tibetan Buddhism, the title \u201cDalai Lama,\u201d and gave the fifth generation of Panchen the title \u201cPanchen Erdeni.\u201d In 1642, the Gelug sect wielded the power and the fifth Dalai Lama became leader of the then theocratic Tibet. The Drepung Monastery where he lived became the political, religious, and cultural center of Tibet. On the last day of the sixth month of the Tibetan calendar, thousands of Buddhists swarmed into the monastery to offer yogurt to the Dalai Lama and monks, asking for blessings of longevity, good harvest, and to not go to hell after they die. The nearby troupes also put on performances such as Tibetan Opera and a yak show. As time went by, more activities have been held, making Shoton a grand festival.\n\nAccording to historical records, the fifth Dalai Lama would personally watch the Tibetan Opera on the day of the festival. That same day, another spiritual leader dubbed the \u201ciron rod\u201d lama would take office. The \u201ciron rod\u201d lama was responsible for making sure every monk observed the rules and prohibitions and managed the monks in the monastery and Dratsang (a school in the monastery for monks to study Buddhist doctrine). His title was derived from the fact that he often brought an iron rod with him when inspecting the monastery.\n\nThe inclusion of the Tibetan Opera in the Shoton Festival signifies the religious event gradually evolved into cultural and entertainment activities. However, the celebration was still confined inside the monastery, with the Drepung Monastery as the center. Therefore, the festival was also called Drepung Shoton Festival.\n\nAfter the white palace of the Potala Palace were finally built, the fifth Dalai Lama moved there from the Drepung Monastery. The following generations of Dalai Lama all settled in the Potala Palace, where they lived and carried out religious activities, making the palace a sacred place for lamas and Buddhists to pay homage. When celebrating the Shoton Festival, the joint performance of Tibetan Opera was first carried out in the Drepung Monastery, and then in the Potala Palace for the Dalai Lama.\n\nA giant Thangka is carried by scores of lamas all the way to the big platform built along the hillside, where it is finally unfolded and displayed.\n\nThe seventh Dalai Lama suffered from many illnesses in his later years. The physicians advised him to live in Norbulingka and have a bath there with running water to preserve his health. Following this advice, he stayed in Norbulingka every summer until he passed away. By the period of the eighth Dalai Lama, the construction of Kelzang Podrang Palace was completed in Norbulingka and has gradually become the de facto summer palace for Dalai Lamas. Therefore, the main venue for celebrating the Shoton Festival was transferred to Norbulingka and ordinary people have been allowed to enter to watch Tibetan Opera performances. In this way, the Shoton Festival has gradually become a festival for everyone.\n\nSince 1959, when the democratic reform was conducted in Tibet, the Shoton Festival celebrations have been further enriched. During the festival, residents near Lhasa City gather together to go to Norbulingka, bringing barley wines and their luggage. In addition to local Tibetan Opera troupes, other troupes from Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan all come to Lhasa to exchange experiences, with an aim to improve their performance skills. Moreover, many song and dance troupes come to put on their performances, making the event even more exciting. Businessmen also seize the opportunity to promote their goods, while still meeting the needs of visitors. The government departments and public institutions in Tibet also organize large-scale song and dance performances, as well as academic symposiums during the Shoton Festival.\n\nSunning of the Buddha\n\nThe Sunning of the Buddha, also known as the Buddha-basking Ceremony, is the most eye-catching prelude to the Shoton Festival. Every year on the last day of the sixth month of the Tibetan calendar, Buddhists display the giant Thangka of Great Buddha on the hillside of the Drepung Monastery for tourists and devout believers to worship.\n\nThe Drepung Monastery was built in 1416 by Tsong Khapa\u2019s fourth disciple Jamyang Choskyi. Tsong Khapa is the founder of the Gelug sect of Tibetan Buddhism. Now, the 250,000-square-meter monastery is the biggest Buddhist temple in Tibet, with a 4,500-square-meter architectural complex of the Tsochin Assembly Hall, Buddhas of Three Periods Hall, Four Dratsangs, and Gaden Podrang Hall. All these buildings are surrounded by white exterior walls which look like large piles of rice from a distance, and thus the monastery was named \u201cDrepung,\u201d meaning \u201cpiles of rice\u201d in the Tibetan language.\n\nOriginating from the period of the fifth Dalai Lama, the Buddha-basking Ceremony in the Drepung Monastery usually starts before daybreak when disciples and visitors converge from all directions onto the solemn and respectful square of the Tsochin Assembly Hall, waiting patiently for the sacred ceremony.\n\nAt dawn, guided by Buddhists holding ritual instrument in hands, the giant Thangka in the monastery will be carried by scores of lamas all the way to the big platform built along the hillside to finally unfold and display. Crowds of people immediately make way for the Great Buddha, soon converging and then joining the long queue walking forward. The participation in the transportation of the Thangka with Buddha Sakyamuni\u2019s image is such an honor, that even people far away will throw different colors of Khada, a brightly colored scarf, and mascots to show their homage and blessing.\n\nIn the first ray of sunshine, as the blaring horn and scripture reciting goes on, a huge figure of Sakyamuni embroidered in color is gradually unfolded on the cliffs, approximately six or seven stories high, showcasing a solemn and peaceful countenance of the Great Buddha. Then, followers will begin to worship and present Khada, and pray for safety, happiness, and fortune.\n\nThe ceremony lasts for the whole morning and at around 2 pm, the giant Thangka will be cautiously rolled up and escorted back to the Drepung Monastery, to wait for next year\u2019s Shoton Festival.\n\n\u2013 Gala in Norbulingka Most activities of the Shoton Festival are celebrated in Norbulingka in the western suburb of Lhasa. In the Tibetan language, \u201cNorbulingka\u201d means \u201ctreasure garden.\u201d Norbulingka Park used to be the Summer Palace of Dalai Lama. At each year\u2019s Shoton Festival, people will get together with family members in Norbulingka, set up colorful tents and carpets, and bring beverages and delicacies to enjoy the blissful time. Under the straight white poplars, on the green grassland, along the river bank, Tibetan people with flamboyant costumes sitting in groups of three or five can be seen everywhere, singing, dancing, drinking, or playing chess. Tibetan Opera shows are performed on the second day of the Shoton Festival, at which point Opera troupes will continually sing every morning from 11 am until night falls. Besides the traditional Buddha display, the Shoton Festival is now more enjoyable with art shows, horse races, hiking conventions around the Namtso Lake, and a \u201cShoton Star\u201d singer contest; in addition, business negotiations, merchandise exhibitions, tourism and entertainment are all included. \u2013 Thangka Thangka is a scroll painting with Tibetan Buddha images on silk, often kept unframed and rolled up when not on display, with a further silk cover on the front. Tibetan history, politics, culture, and social life can all be depicted on this scroll in a religious and ethnic style. Thangka, passed down from generation to generation, are all made from precious materials such as gold, silver, pearl, agate, coral, turquoise, malachite, and cinnabar; and are painted with herbal dyes made from saffron, Chinese rhubarb, and indigo. The natural materials ensure that bright colors don\u2019t fade after hundreds of years. The process to make a Thangka is often complicated and adheres to a series of strict standards, including the painting prelude, canvas making, picture composition, coloring and dyeing, drawing the outline, dyeing the gold and silver colors, highlighting eyes on the countenance, and stitching brocade; and then the Thangka must be blessed by eminent monks. The whole process will take at least half a year, while some complicated ones need more than 10 years. \u2013 Tibetan Opera The Tibetan Opera usually has three main parts: a prelude, an episodic show, and an ending ceremony. In the prelude dance, characters perform paying homage to deities, praying, blessing, and give a brief introduction to the plot; the episodic show presents the audience with different stories in various performance forms, from singing and dancing to rhyming lines and monologue; while in the ending ceremony, as drums and cymbals play, all performers will dance and sing and at the same time, extend their propitious wishes to the audience."}], "The Ganden Phodrang government governed Tibet until the mid-17th century.": [{"url": "http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/english/report/2015-11/10/content_707988.htm", "page_content": "Tibetan Buddhism in Its Prime\n\nBy staff reporter LI YUAN\n\nWITH a history spanning 1,400 years, Tibetan Buddhism has a profound influence on Tibet\u2019s politics, economy, culture, and society. It has undergone robust and orderly development in the 50 years since the establishment of Tibet Autonomous Region, manifest in the religious freedom enjoyed by local people, and it has contributed positively to various undertakings of the region.\n\nDrukhang Tubdain Kaizhub is the seventh Drukhang Living Buddha and also a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), vice-chairman of the CPPCC Tibet Committee, and president of the Buddhist Association of China Tibet branch. It\u2019s no wonder that Drukhang Tubdain Kaizhub calls himself the busiest Living Buddha in the country. Whenever I tried to contact him for an interview he was always out of town \u2013 giving lectures, participating in poverty relief or student aid programs, or on charity drives to dispatch free medicines to those in need. I eventually caught up with him in Beijing, where he was attending a meeting.\n\nLamas and locals attend the \u201csunning\u201d ceremony of the giant portrait of Padma Sambhava on June 10, 2014 at the Churpu Monastery in Doilungdeqen County, Lhasa.\n\nHealthy Development of Religious Affairs\n\nDrukhang Living Buddha of the Gelug Sect is the most revered Living Buddha on the northern Tibetan Plateau, and dates back 380 years. Drukhang Tubdain Kaizhub was identified as the seventh Living Buddha in 1958, the first reincarnation of a Living Buddha after the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Involving close attention from the central government, his enthronement was the most extravagant of any Drukhang Living Buddha so far.\n\nThe reincarnation of Living Buddhas and the related rules and practices are an integral part of the continuation of Tibetan Buddhism, and are fully respected by the government. The latest statistics show that there are now 358 Living Buddhas in Tibet, 60 of whom are newly selected and enthroned by way of the reincarnation system.\n\nAs a prominent religious figure, Drukhang Tubdain Kaizhub has witnessed and been part of the vigorous development of Tibetan Buddhism in China. \u201cUnder the theocratic rule in feudal times faith was held to ransom by politics and its sanctity was impaired. Under the socialist system, Tibet Autonomous Region separates religion from polity, thus allowing believers to freely practice and preach Buddhism.\u201d\n\nAccording to Drukhang Tubdain Kaizhub, there are 1,787 religious venues of various kinds and 46,000 monks and nuns in Tibet. Over the past years the regional government implemented a slew of measures to improve the wellbeing of local religious communities, including funding for modern utilities at temples. So far more than 70 percent of local temples have paved access roads, running water, electricity, telecommunications networks, and TV and radio broadcast facilities. Fitness facilities totaling a value of RMB 1.2 million have been allocated to 20 monasteries. The regional government also promulgated a decree for insurance coverage for local monks and nuns, and appropriated RMB 13 million for this purpose. This move extended medical insurance and pension coverage to 93.3 percent and 66.8 percent of Tibetan clergy respectively, while the basic allowance for subsistence has reached everyone eligible. The local government provides free regular health checks to monks and nuns and keeps health records for them.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping\u2019s remark that \u201cgovernance of the border area is critical to the governance of the state, and stability in Tibet is critical to the governance of frontiers\u201d encapsulates the significance of Tibet. With this understanding, Tibet Autonomous Region has been probing a system of better management of its religious establishments.\n\nSince late 2011 the regional government has established management committees at local monasteries, whose members include both competitive officials and accomplished members of these institutions. Such committees look after education, administration, and services for religious personnel. In this way such affairs as applications for leave, religious activities, and finance are well regulated and handled. The committees also organize teaching sessions for their members on the state\u2019s religious policies, rights and benefits of religious practitioners, and current affairs of interest.\n\nIn the view of Drukhang Tubdain Kaizhub, the innovation of monastery administration lies in shifting its focus from management to services. \u201cTake monastic discipline as the teacher. No discipline, no laws.\u201d With these measures the monks and nuns can be better committed to their practices, loving their country, and defending their faith. So they are of great benefit,\u201d the Living Buddha said.\n\nThe Chinese government has sponsored preservation programs for a multitude of Tibetan Buddhist sites, including the renovation of the Potala Palace, which was lauded by UNESCO officials as a \u201cmiracle in the history of preserving ancient architecture.\u201d Since 2008 China has invested RMB 570 million in the repair and maintenance of the Jokhang, Ramoche, Sera, and Zhaibung monasteries. Buddhist classics are recompiled and republished, including Chinese Tripitaka Kangyur, the General Catalogue of Tibetan Tripitaka in Chinese and Tibetan, and Sublime Interpretation of the Seven Treatises of Hetuvidya. A good number of Kalpa-sutras, or rules of ceremonies, biographies, and studies of Tibetan Buddhism by research institutions, scholars and senior lamas have also been printed.\n\nDrukhang Tubdain Kaizhub is impressed with this progress: \u201cThese precious aspects of cultural heritage belong to Tibet, but also to the entire Chinese nation and all humankind. We religious figures are heartened by the fact that the state is sparing no efforts in preserving them.\u201d\n\nLamas of the Ningma Sect engage in a sutra debate session, a traditional method of study in Tibetan Buddhism\n\nEducation System Enhanced\n\nDrukhang Tubdain Kaizhub is president of the Buddhist Academy of Tibet, located next to the Rato Monastery in Nyetang Township of Quxu County, Lhasa. The academy is the first comprehensive higher education institution of Tibetan Buddhism in the autonomous region, and its faculty and students come from all five major sects of the religion. Inspired by the High-level Tibetan Buddhism College of China, it combines modern and traditional pedagogy, operating three divisions respectively responding to the Esoteric Sect, Exoteric Sect and Living Buddhas, and offering courses in three categories \u2013 legal affairs, public affairs, and Buddhism. Its 13 lecturers are all senior priests from across Tibet.\n\nSo far the academy has concluded two sessions of the religious title studies program and seven sessions of the program for monks and nuns from remote frontier areas. The students, numbering nearly 1,000, have hailed from the full range of sects and divisions of Buddhism.\n\nDrukhang Tubdain Kaizhub accredits the vitality of his academy to the central government\u2019s patronage of Tibetan Buddhism. \u201cThe education system of Tibetan Buddhism is improving steadily in terms of curriculum and teaching methods, cultivating outstanding monks and nuns who are dedicated to their country and religion. An innovative academic system that integrates modern schools with traditional seminaries has been established, inaugurating and completing the academic title system for Tibetan Buddhism.\u201d The Living Buddha said that the experience of Tibet Autonomous Region has corroborated the significance of all-round, high-caliber talents to the management of temples and their future development.\n\nThe sixth Razheng Living Buddha, Lodro Gyaco Trinley Lhunzhub, was one of the first graduates of the Buddhist Academy of Tibet. He proudly recalled that his paper on the environmental theories of Tibetan Buddhism won first prize at Tibet\u2019s first writing contest on the doctrines and disciplines of Tibetan Buddhism. He observed in his thesis: \u201cThe lust of humankind induces disharmony in the relations between people and people, people and animals, and people and nature in general, resulting in various catastrophes. Deeds of goodness will restore harmony in the ecosystem, and more damage to the environment will result in more disasters.\u201d\n\nAccording to Drukhang Tubdain Kaizhub, his students show broad interests and concerns. \u201cBesides Buddhism, the most discussed topics include contributions by eminent monks to national unity, self-improvement by members of different sects to catch up with the times, evolving Buddhist theories in the synchronization of the times, Buddhism\u2019s influence on world peace, and practicability of environmental ideas in Buddhist doctrines.\u201d\n\nIn recent years the regional government has promulgated statutes to support the Buddhist Academy of Tibet and to regulate the title awarding work at the academy. The Buddhist Academy of Tibet and the High-level Tibetan Buddhism College of China in Beijing are two leading incubators of high-ranking Tibetan Buddhist priests in China. Below them are the sutra-learning classes organized by 60-plus monasteries of different sects in Tibet, which offer traditional religious courses and evaluate and confer academic degrees on their students.\n\nSince 2005 the High-level Tibetan Buddhism College of China has held annual examinations for the Dorampa degree. Meanwhile, examinations for the Geshe Lharampa degree are held in Jokhang, Ganden, Sera, and Zhaibung monasteries. So far 84 monks have obtained the Geshe Lharampa degree, and 46 achieved the Dorampa degree.\n\nTo widen access to higher education for local lamas, the Buddhist Academy of Tibet opened a branch at the Shabten Monastery in Nagqu in 2011. In July 2015 the first batch of students finished a four-year course. The academy has also sponsored several sessions for lamas in remote areas, unprecedented in the history of Tibetan Buddhism education.\n\nDrukhang Tubdain Kaizhub (left) awards a lama who has passed his academic exams with Buddhist title certification.\n\nSocial Integration Fosters Vitality\n\nToday Tibetan Buddhism is no longer confined to Chinese regions inhabited by Tibetan people. It is known and practiced globally. Drukhang Tubdain Kaizhub commutes between China\u2019s inland and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and travels extensively abroad. In these exchanges he is frequently asked about the adaptation of Tibetan Buddhism to social progress in the new era, and his answer is, \u201cThe essence of Buddhism is great mercy. It requires no harm to any life, and believes that all sins will be self-punished. The mission of Buddhism is to salvage humankind from worldly sins and sufferings. These are all relevant in today\u2019s society, so the cardinals of Buddhism see no need for any change.\u201d\n\nDrukhang Tubdain Kaizhub believes that Tibetan Buddhism must acclimatize to socialist society, and has all the conditions to do so. \u201cThe fate of a religion is interwoven with that of the nation. Healthy development of the religion and full commitment by its followers is only possible in a strong, prosperous, and stable country. Due to the purport of Buddhism and under the condition of the current social system, laws, and policies, Tibetan Buddhism now can well adapt to the socialist society,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Living Buddha warned that Tibetan Buddhism must be wary of infiltration by secessionism and draw a clear line between religion and superstition. He also stressed unity within Tibetan Buddhism: \u201cThe various sects have different approaches to reaching enlightenment, but share the same tenets and goals. So we are all one family.\u201d He said that history testifies that the best time for Buddhism is the period when different religious sects live in peace, which is in the interests of the nation and the people."}, {"url": "http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/ctenglish/2018/ln/202105/t20210518_800246798.html", "page_content": "Tibet\u2019S human rights issues always draw global attention and Western anti-China forces often use this topic as an excuse to stigmatize China. Nevertheless, misinformation for the purpose of political interference can never be construed as facts. Through their field inspections and long-term in-depth research, experts and scholars worldwide, who truly care about Tibet\u2019s development and respect Tibetan culture, have more objective evaluations of the status quo of Tibet\u2019s social development and human rights protection, than politicians.\n\nWorkers filing results of a general survey of silk fabrics of Potala Palace on April 12, 2016. The Potala Palace has a rich collection of cultural relics, including some 100,000 ancient books and documents.\n\n\n\n\n\nAchievements in Human Rights Protection\n\nThis year marks the 70th anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet.\n\nAccording to Muhammad Iqbal, a Pakistani lawyer who has done an in-depth study of the feudal serfdom once in place in Tibet 70 years ago, before the peaceful liberation, old Tibet was a feudal serfdom society under theocratic rule. About 99.7 percent of the arable land was controlled by local government, and millions of serfs were cruelly exploited and oppressed. Democratic reforms and poverty alleviation policies have enabled former serfs to have the land use right, farm tools, livestock, and other means of production.\n\nTaking Tibet\u2019s waterworks improvement as an example, Iqbal said from the winter of 1959 to the spring of 1960, about 1,500 km of new canals were built in agricultural areas, 300 reservoirs were repaired, and more than 24,666 hectares of irrigated land was added. In 1960, 5,000 km of canals were built, 1,500 reservoirs and ponds were completed, and the irrigation area was further expanded. Iqbal believed that as a region dominated by agriculture and animal husbandry, the improvement of Tibet\u2019s water supply system has had a positive impact on social development.\n\nIn fact, Tibet\u2019s development and changes during the past seven decades have far exceeded this. \u201cAfter 70 years of unremitting efforts, Tibet\u2019s agriculture and animal husbandry are steadily modernizing and are no longer subject to natural environment. Tibet has developed a comprehensive transportation network consisting of highways, railways, and air routes. Trade, logistics, e-commerce, and other new forms of industries are growing rapidly. By the end of October 2019, there were about 38,000 registered students in higher-learning institutions of Tibet. In addition, vocational schools can provide handicraft teaching and other employability skills,\u201d said Iqbal, whose research has given him a comprehensive understanding of Tibet\u2019s development.\n\nHaile Andargie Wondalem, vice dean of the Law School of Debre Markos University in Ethiopia, has always been concerned about the development of Tibetan women\u2019s rights and interests. According to his study, Tibetan women\u2019s higher education level has been improving, and there are a large number of female doctors, professors, and professional and technical personnel. Wondalem believes that economic and social development has ensured Tibetan women\u2019s rights of life and development, the most important elements of human rights.\n\nWondalem said, \u201cFor centuries, Tibet was ruled by feudal serfdom before the democratic reform in Tibet in 1959. Women were subjected to cruel execution and oppression without freedom of marriage and access to education, their health conditions were not guaranteed, and the death rate was very high.\u201d After the democratic reform, \u201cChildren can enjoy 15 years of free schooling, from kindergarten to senior high school. The improvement of compulsory education, higher education, adult education, vocational education, and special education systems provided more and more women and children with opportunities to attend school. Tibet now has more than 1,339 hospitals and clinics, 23 times the number in 1959,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cHuman rights can be realized not only by breaking the dark and decayed regime, but also by fully guaranteeing women\u2019s rights to survival, development, and self-fullfillment. Respecting, realizing and protecting women\u2019s human rights contribute to a better, prosperous and progressive future,\u201d said Wondalem.\n\nAccording to Yogeshwar Romkhami, former senior superintendent of the Nepal police and chief leader of the People\u2019s Party of Nepal, over the past 70 years since Tibet\u2019s peaceful liberation, the region has gone through noticeable social development, realizing the transformation from backwardness to modernization. While constructing modern infrastructure, the Chinese government has invested large amounts of resources to protect ancient monasteries and culture, and properly handled the relationship among ecological protection, economic development, and enriching the people. \u201cChina\u2019s great cause of poverty alleviation has completely changed Tibet,\u201d said Romkhami.\n\nStaff members do post production editing of a program at the Lhasa Radio and Television Station on March 26, 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping Culture Alive\n\nBritish Tibetologist Elaine Robson has had a deep bond with the Tibetan language and culture since the 1950s. In the early 1990s, she studied under professor Hu Tan, who has long been committed to the research, sorting, and protection of Tibetan dialects at the China Tibetology Research Center. Encouraged by professor Hu, Robson tried to use Tibetan translation to publish a number of world-renowned literary works, which were later welcomed by Tibetan readers. Robson believes that her ability to use Tibetan for literary translation should be accredited to the Chinese government\u2019s endeavor to protect and develop minority languages and cultures, vivid proof of the active vitality of minority languages.\n\nAccording to Sarbottam Shrestha, president of Nepal\u2019s Arniko Society (an alumni association of scholars and experts who have graduated from China and are engaged in various government and non-governmental organizations), the Chinese government has long been committed to protecting traditional Tibetan culture and respecting the Tibetan people\u2019s love for traditional culture. \u201cKing Gesar is a famous Tibetan folk literature work that has been sung by folk singers for generations, and different versions have also been derived. The Chinese government launched a large-scale project to collect all the different editions. After the collection, King Gesar became the longest epic in the world,\u201d said Shrestha.\n\nAs one of the ancient languages of the world, Sanskrit is extremely rich in content. Its most famous works are the ancient Indian Brahmanism classics, namely four Vedas: Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda, as well as two epics: Mahabharata and Ramayana. Many Sanskrit Buddhist scriptures have been unearthed in China. Among them, the Sanskrit palm-leaf scriptures are the most representative. Most of these precious ancient documents written in Sanskrit on dried palm leaves are treasures kept in monasteries in Tibet Autonomous Region.\n\nThe Austrian Buddhologist and Tibetologist Birgit Kellner considers the Sanskrit manuscripts preserved in Tibet Autonomous Region as one of the greatest treasures of humankind. \u201cThe contents of these manuscripts reflect the entire range of Buddhist literary culture throughout its long and variegated history. The manuscripts also include Indian literature of a more general nature, for example epic and narrative literature, and scientific and scholarly literature. It\u2019s estimated that there are about 60,000 manuscript folios currently preserved in various monasteries and institutions in Tibet, amounting to approximately 3,500 to 4,000 texts or textual fragments. Many of these texts are rare and unique, and not found anywhere else. These texts also include works by philosophers or masters whose names have so far nowhere been recorded. Considering that manuscripts of these periods are poorly preserved on the Indian subcontinent itself, the manuscripts from Tibet \u2013 chiefly in Sanskrit \u2013 are invaluable resources for our understanding of the cultural, intellectual, and religious history of Buddhism in the context where it originated,\u201d Kellner said.\n\nThe number of Sanskrit manuscripts found in Tibet Autonomous Region is large and as a cultural heritage it has great historical and cultural value. After the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Chinese government has attached great importance to the protection of Sanskrit scriptures in Tibet Autonomous Region, and organized special personnel to collect Tibetan Sanskrit scriptures, while adopting a series of measures to protect the Sanskrit palm-leaf scriptures in the Potala Palace and Norbulingka. China\u2019s research on Sanskrit classics has been carried out orderly in recent years, and remarkable results have been achieved in the research, collation, and publication of Sanskrit documents, as well as international academic exchanges.\n\nAccording to Kellner, the China Tibetology Research Center has cooperated in recent years with the Austrian Academy of Sciences to carry out research on Tibetan Sanskrit manuscripts. In the future, the two sides will continue to maintain close exchanges and jointly strengthen international cooperation in the study of Sanskrit.\n\nTibetan food is another important part of the culture of this ethnic group. Austrian writer Rudolf Lantschbauer is a long-time observer of Tibetan food culture. Lantschbauer indicated that there were 48 kinds of vegetables and more than 30 kinds of fruits found in a farmers\u2019 market in Lhasa when he stayed there, which were more abundant than the supermarkets in his hometown in Austria. He then added that the Tibetan cuisine is flourishing, and not only allows the general public to enjoy delicacies, but also increases the income of local people.\n\nLantschbauer studies Tibetan culinary culture from a unique perspective. He believes that the region\u2019s social features can be better understood from Tibetan traditional Buddhist thangka paintings. By examing Tibetan traditional medicine and thangka, Lantschbauer found that many traditional Tibetan diets are divided into two categories: edible and herbal for medicinal purposes. Tibetan traditional diets are closely related to medical care, he said."}, {"url": "http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/ctenglish/2018/ln/201903/t20190329_800163714.html", "page_content": "The photo shows Tibetans reading a newspaper.

In 1988, he graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree. By that time, CTRC had been established for only two years. Khar ventured to Beijing to join the research center which eventually became China\u2019s most prestigious institution for Tibetological studies.\n\nTibetan native Wande Khar has worked for China Tibetology Research Center (CTRC) for decades. He was born and grew up in Hezuo City in Gansu Province\u2019s Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. In the late 1970s, Tibetan language education had just been officially introduced to local schools. After graduating from high school, Khar became a teacher in a local primary school.

She showed him a 1984 photo of Xigaze in China\u2019s Tibet Autonomous Region and asked whether the area remained as poor and underdeveloped as decades ago. \u201cI suggested she visit Xigaze again and take another photo for comparison,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIn the eyes of many Westerners, Tibetans were a very vulnerable group, and based on inadequate sensory experience and imagination, they seem to think Tibet stopped developing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 2007: Wande Khar (second right) takes a photo with herders from nearby Gegyai County at the foot of Mount Kailash in Ngari, Tibet. The herders came to circle the mountain as a pilgrimage. courtesy of Wande Khar\n\nHowever, after six decades of modernization and transformation, Tibet has indeed achieved self-sufficiency in grain production and supply, developed modern industry from scratch, and enjoyed convenient transportation facilities, with all low-income farmers and herders covered by the social security system. Increasing numbers of Tibetans educated elsewhere are returning home to support local development. Moreover, Tibet is known as one of the regions with the best environmental quality in the world and remains a world-renowned tourist destination featuring distinct, abundant religious and cultural heritage.\n\nFrom the peaceful liberation of Tibet in the early 1950s to the launch of Tibet\u2019s democratic reform in 1959 and the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region in 1965, Tibet has kept in step with the country\u2019s epoch-making changes. Alongside the great liberalization and development of its productive forces, the autonomous region has accumulated abundant social wealth and transformed the traditional mindsets of locals.\n\n\u201cRadical Emancipation of the Mind\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nYang Tao (left), a scholar from China Tibetology Research Center, and a Tibetan woman who operates the tent restaurant behind them. In August 2016, Yang conducted a survey at the Qomolangma base camp and interviewed local Tibetans engaged in tourist service on how the boom of tourism had impacted their lives and the local ecological environment. courtesy of Yang Tao\n\nMount Qomolangma, known as Mount Everest in the West, attracts some 60,000 tourists each year, providing plentiful opportunity for local farmers and herders to improve their livelihood. At an altitude of more than 5,000 meters, the Qomolangma base camp in Tashi Dzom Township, Xigaze\u2019s Tingri County offers services such as tents, camp carts, yaks and workers for transporting supplies, as well as tour guides. In August 2016, Yang Tao, a scholar from CTRC, spent a week conducting a survey there. He found that due to limitations of capital thresholds and yak numbers, it was hard for poor locals to benefit from tourism development, so Yang suggested optimization of the tourist revenue sharing mechanism of the base camp.\n\nIncome distribution is an inevitable topic in all sorts of economic theories. Six decades ago, it would have been unimaginable to form a revenue sharing mechanism involving the government, investors, farmers and herders in Tibet, let alone institutional optimization that aims to benefit more poverty-stricken farmers and herders.\n\nRecently, four Tibetological researchers from CTRC\u2014Tserin Yangdzom, Wande Khar, Li Jian and Yang Tao\u2014were interviewed by China Pictorial. The researchers agreed that the democratic reform that started six decades ago has been the most profound and radical social reform in the history of Tibet and laid the groundwork for the modernization of Tibet\u2019s social system.\n\nOriginating in the 13th century, the feudal serfdom system enforced a strict hierarchical structure in Tibet. Lords accounted for less than five percent of Tibet\u2019s population and maintained ownership of the vast majority of production means, while serfs and slaves who accounted for more than 95 percent of the total population lacked production means and personal freedom. In his book Old Tibet Faces New China, French Tibetologist Alexander David-Neel wrote, \u201cAll the farmers in Tibet are serfs saddled with lifelong debt, and it is almost impossible to find any who have paid off their debts.\u201d\n\nIn Yang Tao\u2019s eyes, the most prominent characteristic of Tibet\u2019s development is institutional reform creating a strong driving force. \u201cDemocratic reform enabled Tibet to shift from a feudal serfdom system to a socialist system, not only bringing radical changes to productivity and production relations, but also giving ordinary farmers land and livestock and considerably boosting their enthusiasm for agricultural production.\u201d\n\nWande Khar believes that the democratic reform eliminated the feudal personal independence relationship that had existed in Tibet for centuries and enabled serfs to become independent persons, which is the most important cornerstone for Tibet becoming a modern society.\n\nTsering Yangdzom grew up in Lhasa. Thanks to substantial improvement of educational facilities after the peaceful liberation of Tibet, she had access to quality education from primary school to college. She once worked as a teacher at Tibet University. In 1988, she joined CTRC and became Khar\u2019s colleague. Yangdzom has paid great attention to the disruptive influence of Tibet\u2019s democratic reform on people\u2019s minds. \u201cToday, as we plainly describe the effort to \u2018overthrow the system of feudal serfdom\u2019 in Tibet, most don\u2019t realize the people underwent a radical emancipation of the mind.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe photo shows Tibetan textile workers in 1960. Abundant in wool and cashmere, Tibet has developed a long-standing textile industry. by He Shiyao/China Pictorial\n\nAssistance and Communication\n\nDue to high altitudes, cold weather and uneven population distribution, Tibet suffers higher costs for industrial development and human resources than many central and coastal regions. According to Yang Tao and Li Jian, the harsh natural environment is a core factor impeding Tibet\u2019s endogenous development and self circulation. Tsering Yangdzom stressed that traditional culture and ethnic sentiment of Tibetans make them less enthusiastic about commercialization, so reform is evidently promoted from top to bottom.\n\nSince the early 1980s, the Chinese government has formulated and implemented a series of major measures conducive to the development of Tibet and the well-being of Tibetan people by upholding the principle of catering to actual local conditions and putting people\u2019s livelihood first. For this reason, government-backed national assistance is the most prominent feature of Tibet\u2019s modernization. This is also a policy and measure for regional coordinated development with Chinese characteristics, which is rare worldwide.\n\nIn March 1984, the second National Conference on Work in Tibet passed a decision to organize governments of nine provinces and municipalities and several ministries and departments of the central government to construct 43 projects that Tibet urgently needed, especially public establishments such as power plants, schools, hospitals and cultural centers. Some of these projects later became landmarks in Lhasa such as the Lhasa Hotel, Tibet People\u2019s Hall and Tibet Public Art Museum. Primary statistics show that by the end of 2018, nearly 10,000 assistance programs had been carried out in Tibet, nearly 8,000 officials had been dispatched to work in the autonomous region, and more than 30 billion yuan (US$4.48 billion) in aid funds had been allotted to Tibet.\n\nThe first time Tsering Yangdzom left Tibet to study elsewhere in 1978, her family spent 61 yuan (US$9.1) on her ticket from Lhasa to Chengdu. \u201cThat ticket cost what my mother earned in two whole months.\u201d One of her classmates once asked her, \u201cDo you eat rice and drink tap water at home?\u201d Feeling discriminated against, young Yangdzom angrily answered, \u201cWe don\u2019t eat or drink!\u201d\n\nWith limited interactions and exchange taking place, such misconceptions were not uncommon back then. Not until the early 1980s were large-scale institutional aid projects benefiting Tibet launched across the country. Concrete action has also revealed channels and opportunities for mutual understanding and cultural integration between Tibet and the rest of China. Just as the Tibetan civilization has repeatedly integrated with other civilizations throughout history, mutual recognition between Tibet and the rest of China is also increasing.\n\nOn the celestial burial platform of the famous Drikung Thil Monastery, a Tibetan asked Yang Tao whether the Han people considered sky burial cruel. Yang replied, \u201cOf course not. That\u2019s the real eternal home.\u201d The Tibetan gave him a thumbs-up. On the way back, the Tibetan driver asked Yang what sounded good for dinner. He said anything would be fine, even just soup. \u201cIf you refuse to eat their food, they will think you don\u2019t respect them. That driver assured me that I really do respect their customs.\u201d\n\nBecause it is hard to grow vegetables in alpine areas, the traditional Tibetan diet usually consists of highland barley and meat. During a survey in Bainang County, Tibet\u2019s Xigaze City, Li Jian discovered that Shandong Province, a major producer of vegetables, had been supporting Bainang since 1995. In addition to sending officials to aid Tibet, a group of Shandong farmers also ventured to Bainang to teach locals how to grow vegetables. Today, Bainang has become the largest plateau greenhouse vegetable base in Tibet, with annual sales exceeding 100 million yuan (US$14.8 million). More and more Tibetans are beginning to embrace and eat vegetables.\n\nLi stresses that Tibet\u2019s uniqueness means that the autonomous region cannot directly copy the development modes of other parts of the country to solve its problems. According to him, however, alongside aid projects, new ideas and experiences are flowing into Tibet, fueling new development concepts.\n\nVision of a Moderately Prosperous Tibet\n\nA herder named Rigzin lived in a village in northern Tibet\u2019s Rungma Township, Nyima County, about 1,200 kilometers away from Lhasa. The village is within the core area of the Qiangtang National Nature Reserve at an average elevation of 5,000 meters. The scenery is beautiful, but the harsh conditions are not friendly to human residents. Many villagers suffered from rheumatism and heart diseases, and the average life expectancy was less than 60 years. Without the necessary conditions for developing public services, the township even had not a single vegetable shop. Because of its extremely fragile ecological environment, Rungma Township became the first pilot project for ecological relocation in Tibet.\n\nOn June 18, 2018, after voluntary relocation, Rigzin\u2019s family and 240 other households moved into a village in the suburb of Lhasa. The resettlement site was built with total investment of 226 million yuan (US$33.8 million), and a modern agricultural and animal husbandry demonstration park under construction, which covers an area of more than 30 hectares, will offer adequate job opportunities.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Deng Xiaoping, chief architect of China\u2019s reform and opening up, proposed a vision of building a \u201cmoderately prosperous society.\u201d The report to the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed to complete the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects by 2020. As Chinese President Xi Jinping pointed out, building a moderately prosperous society in all respects should be based on the situation of specific areas. However, with a vast territory and different situation in different areas, productivity varies, so the goal for prosperity should be different at various levels.\n\nYang Tao argues that instead of indicators like GDP, three standards for \u201cmoderately prosperous\u201d are more important in regions inhabited by ethnic minorities: improvement of people\u2019s living standards, environmental protection and poverty elimination.\n\nLi Jian points out that as the only provincial-level region with contiguous poor areas and a vast area with extreme poverty, Tibet should not only raise 150,000 impoverished people out of poverty, but also ensure that infrastructure facilities like roads and other basic public services are available to all.\n\nIn addition to the large-scale support by the central government and local governments, the new direction for poverty alleviation in Tibet should be enhancing local impoverished people\u2019s abilities to create wealth. Tibet boasts very unique landscapes, which makes it an ideal place for tourism and special industries such as plateau farm products processing. Li once visited the industrial park for modern animal husbandry in Tibet\u2019s Coqen County. The introduction of modern production techniques has created many jobs and provided locals the opportunity to earn a stable income and climb out of poverty.\n\nLi stresses the innovative power of young people in the age of internet. \u201cTibetan millennials who received higher education have led the local farmers to become involved in emerging industries. By developing industries such as planting Tibetan medicinal plants and manufacturing tourism souvenirs, they help the poor earn more money.\u201d The South Asia channel has drawn Li\u2019s special attention recently. With the construction of the South Asia channel and the Belt and Road Initiative projects, Tibet will become the crux of cooperation instead of a landlocked remote area and gain location advantages that will produce more fuel for development.\n\nLiving Standards Leap: Education and Medical Services\n\n\n\n\n\nWith maturing medical agencies and the establishment of a disease control and prevention system, Tibetan people have seen a remarkable rise in life expectancy from 35.5 years to 68 years as their health conditions have substantially improved. This photo shows members of a medical aid team from northeastern Liaoning Province making rounds with local doctors at Nagqu People\u2019s Hospital on March 15, 2018. Xinhua\n\nScholars at CTRC once conducted a family-based survey in Chamdo, eastern Tibet, to find out what parents expect their children to do for a living after they grow up. The survey, covering herders, farmers and urban residents, suggests that the most sought-after professions are doctors and civil servants.\n\nLi Jian and the other three scholars found that the development of modernity is altering local people\u2019s everyday lives through their own research in Tibet. Education is a crucial driver for developing a modern society in Tibet. Before the democratic reform of Tibet, the region lacked schools in the modern sense and less than two percent of school-age children had access to education. But now a sound educational system with Tibetan features and ethnic characteristics has taken shape, including pre-school, primary, middle and high schools as well as vocational, adult training and higher education. Many Tibetan scholars such as Tsering Yangdzom and Wande Khar have become leading figures in the areas of their studies. Young Tibetans now have greater access to education and more opportunities to pursue personal development.\n\nAfter the launch of China\u2019s reform and opening up in the late 1970s, increasing numbers of farmers and herders began swarming into cities in search of jobs and business opportunities. The information and skills they acquired in the process returned to make a positive impact on the social development of Tibet. In Li Jian\u2019s eyes, Tibetan society has benefited substantially from educational development and changing population structure especially since 2000. \u201cThe number of farmers and herders with fundamental education has risen dramatically in Tibet. Equipped with basic scientific and cultural knowledge, they are more productive than the previous generations, and also more socially inclusive.\u201d\n\nLooking back on her childhood in Lhasa, Tsering Yangdzom says, \u201cBack then the only hospitals we could visit were the Tibet Autonomous Region People\u2019s Hospital and Lhasa People\u2019s Hospital. But now there are dozens in Lhasa.\u201d Before the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951, just three poorly equipped official medical institutions were available alongside a few private clinics. The ratio of medical staff to the total population in Tibet was a paltry 0.4 for every 1,000 people. Because of chills and lack of oxygen in the high-altitude region, even a cold or dysentery could be deadly, and an outbreak of smallpox or typhoid fever could easily kill thousands.\n\nIn the early 1950s, the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army began to offer medical services to Tibetans as they trekked through the region. When the 21st century arrived, a healthcare system featuring free medical services covered all counties and more than 96 percent rural townships in Tibet. With maturing medical agencies and the estabalishment of a disease control and prevention system, Tibetans have seen great progress in health conditions and a remarkable rise in life expectancy from 35.5 years to 68 years. \u201cGreen medical passages\u201d have been built in many herding areas, such as Damxung County in central Tibet, which Yangdzom visited with Yang Tao in 2011. \u201cPatients who need more treatment are transferred to larger hospitals in cities or even Lhasa. Regular checks are performed on clinics in rural areas to ensure expired drugs are pulled off the shelves,\u201d said Yangdzom.\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation is a crucial driver of the development of modern society in Tibet. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, Tibetan children and youngsters were granted greater access to education and more opportunities to pursue personal development. This photo shows students playing in the campus of a primary school in Lhasa in 1966. by Ru Suichu/China Pictorial\n\nPartly because of the local religious culture, many Tibetans formerly resisted both Western and traditional Chinese medicine. Instead, they looked to deities for recovery or only trusted Tibetan medicine. Yangdzom and Khar both noted that educational and medical development, which Tibetans value more since the democratic reform, has introduced the benefits of modern civilization. \u201cAfter the peaceful liberation of Tibet, doctors from other parts of China helped locals tackle their health problems. Tibetans eventually accept that they should see a doctor when they get sick. In the past, a cold or dysentery could be deadly for some Tibetans, but after they tried granules or berberine for colds, they realized that medicines can cure and that such diseases didn\u2019t mean a death sentence.\u201d\n\nSaving Mountains and Rivers\n\n\u201cWhere else in the world has 40 percent of the land been set aside in nature preserves in twenty years? How hard is it to reverse a steady decline in number of endangered species? The industrious Tibetans achieved it,\u201d wrote former U.S. President Jimmy Carter in the preface of the book Across the Tibetan Plateau: Ecosystems, Wildlife, and Conservation.\n\nIn Yangdzom and Khar\u2019s memories, Tibet once embraced a great leap in industrial construction. During the \u201ccultural revolution\u201d period (1966-1976), dozens of non-ferrous metals, rare metals and non-metallic ore were found in the region, but massive exploitation was eventually terminated, mostly due to ecological protection concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis August 2017 photo shows Tibetan macaques walking near a group of people in Gongbo Gyamda County, Tibet. In recent years, the population of Tibetan macaques has been rising thanks to local measures to protect the ecological environment and strengthen public awareness of environmental conservation. by Zhang Rufeng/Xinhua\n\nTibet has tremendous ecological significance. It is the source of rivers flowing through China, South Asia and Southeast Asia and the climate regulator for China and even the eastern hemisphere of the planet. An important gene tank for protecting Earth\u2019s biological diversity, it is home to over 9,600 types of wild plants, 798 types of vertebrates and nearly 4,000 types of insects.\n\nHowever, the ecological environment is extremely fragile on the plateau. It takes as long as several years in certain areas of Tibet to grow grass that can be restored within a single year in areas with lower altitudes. The dilemma of balancing economic development and environmental protection was identified by European countries and the United States during the early period of industrialization and in eastern China in the 1980s and 1990s. Tibetans realized the importance of coordinating economic growth and natural resources and environment as early as the 1970s.\n\nBenefiting from the proliferation of green development policies, Tibet has kept most of the region untouched, with 47 natural preserves at all levels that cover Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon, Mount Qomolangma, Lake Manasarovar and more world-known tourist attractions.\n\nAlong with environmental protection have come economic gains. Emerging industries such as ecological tourism are thriving in Tibet thanks to its strength in natural resources. In 2018, 33.68 million tourist visits to Tibet generated revenues of 49 billion yuan (US$7.3 billion), which accounted for about 34 percent of its GDP. \u201cTibet is better integrated into the entire Chinese market, and the country\u2019s demand for improved living standards and ecological products have injected strong momentum into Tibet\u2019s economic development,\u201d Yang Tao noted.\n\nConcepts of environmental protection from the West were introduced to China in the 1980s, and have integrated with and been restructured by traditional values about nature in the country. In the eyes of Tibetans, there is a worldly space in nature behind the deified concepts that can be utilized for survival. Modern concepts of environmental protection mingle with local values about nature through communication between locals and outsiders as well as within local communities. Traditionally, farmers and herders in Tibet chop wood for household use, but those living in Lulang Town, Nyingchi City have spontaneously taken the role of forest rangers. During a research tour to Lulang in June 2018, Yang noted that local awareness of ecological protection has grown with the tourism boom. \u201cThey are earning more money because of thriving tourism. To keep their hometown attractive to tourists, they actively fight behaviors that could harm the forest. Protecting woods has even been added to the local code of conduct.\u201d"}, {"url": "http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/english/culture/2017-07/31/content_744393.htm", "page_content": "Celebrating the Yogurt Festival\n\nACCORDING to the Tibetan calendar, the Shoton Festival is traditionally celebrated from the end of the sixth month to the beginning of the seventh month in areas inhabited by people of Tibetan ethnicity, such as Tibet, Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan. Following the Tibetan New Year, the Shoton Festival is one of the most important festivals for Tibetans. In the Tibetan language, \u201cShoton\u201d means \u201cyogurt banquet\u201d; therefore, the festival is also known as the Yogurt Festival. During the celebration, people can watch Tibetan Opera and worship giant Buddha images painted on Thangka scrolls. As such, the festival is also called the \u201cFestival of Tibetan Opera\u201d and the \u201cSunning of the Buddha.\u201d\n\nTibetan Opera is a performance art which combines drama, dance, music, and rhyming lines. Performers dance and sing to extend their propitious wishes to the audience.\n\nThe traditional Shoton Festival celebrations start with the ceremony of the Sunning of the Buddha and feature activities such as Tibetan Opera performances, horse shows, and yak racing. The celebrations are normally held in Norbulingka in the western suburb of Lhasa. During the festival, Norbulingka and its surrounding woods resemble a newly built city with colorful tents, bustling streets, and busy markets. Everyone sings and dances passionately, with the accompanying music played on Tibetan musical instruments. These are the most vibrant days for local Tibetan people.\n\nThe Shoton Festival was officially added to China\u2019s Intangible Cultural Heritage list in 2006.\n\nOrigin and Development\n\nThe Shoton Festival originated in the middle of the 11th century as a purely religious activity.\n\nIt is said that a major taboo of Buddhism is to kill living beings. However, as the weather begins to grow warm in the summer, the trees and grass start to grow and hibernating insects wake up. As such, it\u2019s difficult to avoid killing these small creatures when the monks walk outside the monastery. Therefore, the Gelug, one of the schools of Tibetan Buddhism, stipulated that monks must stay in monasteries for studying and worship from the fourth to sixth month of the Tibetan calendar, and are only allowed to go outside at the end of the sixth month. On the day the ban is lifted, the monks go out and travel down the mountains. People make yogurt and hold banquets for the visiting monks, during which they can also appreciate Tibetan Opera performances. This marks the origin of the Shoton Festival.\n\nThe Sunning of the Buddha, also known as the Buddha-basking Ceremony, is the most eye-catching prelude to the Shoton Festival.\n\nBy the second half of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th century, the theocratic system had been strengthened in Tibet, as the Qing imperial government formally granted the fifth generation of Dalai, then leader of the Gelug sect of Tibetan Buddhism, the title \u201cDalai Lama,\u201d and gave the fifth generation of Panchen the title \u201cPanchen Erdeni.\u201d In 1642, the Gelug sect wielded the power and the fifth Dalai Lama became leader of the then theocratic Tibet. The Drepung Monastery where he lived became the political, religious, and cultural center of Tibet. On the last day of the sixth month of the Tibetan calendar, thousands of Buddhists swarmed into the monastery to offer yogurt to the Dalai Lama and monks, asking for blessings of longevity, good harvest, and to not go to hell after they die. The nearby troupes also put on performances such as Tibetan Opera and a yak show. As time went by, more activities have been held, making Shoton a grand festival.\n\nAccording to historical records, the fifth Dalai Lama would personally watch the Tibetan Opera on the day of the festival. That same day, another spiritual leader dubbed the \u201ciron rod\u201d lama would take office. The \u201ciron rod\u201d lama was responsible for making sure every monk observed the rules and prohibitions and managed the monks in the monastery and Dratsang (a school in the monastery for monks to study Buddhist doctrine). His title was derived from the fact that he often brought an iron rod with him when inspecting the monastery.\n\nThe inclusion of the Tibetan Opera in the Shoton Festival signifies the religious event gradually evolved into cultural and entertainment activities. However, the celebration was still confined inside the monastery, with the Drepung Monastery as the center. Therefore, the festival was also called Drepung Shoton Festival.\n\nAfter the white palace of the Potala Palace were finally built, the fifth Dalai Lama moved there from the Drepung Monastery. The following generations of Dalai Lama all settled in the Potala Palace, where they lived and carried out religious activities, making the palace a sacred place for lamas and Buddhists to pay homage. When celebrating the Shoton Festival, the joint performance of Tibetan Opera was first carried out in the Drepung Monastery, and then in the Potala Palace for the Dalai Lama.\n\nA giant Thangka is carried by scores of lamas all the way to the big platform built along the hillside, where it is finally unfolded and displayed.\n\nThe seventh Dalai Lama suffered from many illnesses in his later years. The physicians advised him to live in Norbulingka and have a bath there with running water to preserve his health. Following this advice, he stayed in Norbulingka every summer until he passed away. By the period of the eighth Dalai Lama, the construction of Kelzang Podrang Palace was completed in Norbulingka and has gradually become the de facto summer palace for Dalai Lamas. Therefore, the main venue for celebrating the Shoton Festival was transferred to Norbulingka and ordinary people have been allowed to enter to watch Tibetan Opera performances. In this way, the Shoton Festival has gradually become a festival for everyone.\n\nSince 1959, when the democratic reform was conducted in Tibet, the Shoton Festival celebrations have been further enriched. During the festival, residents near Lhasa City gather together to go to Norbulingka, bringing barley wines and their luggage. In addition to local Tibetan Opera troupes, other troupes from Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan all come to Lhasa to exchange experiences, with an aim to improve their performance skills. Moreover, many song and dance troupes come to put on their performances, making the event even more exciting. Businessmen also seize the opportunity to promote their goods, while still meeting the needs of visitors. The government departments and public institutions in Tibet also organize large-scale song and dance performances, as well as academic symposiums during the Shoton Festival.\n\nSunning of the Buddha\n\nThe Sunning of the Buddha, also known as the Buddha-basking Ceremony, is the most eye-catching prelude to the Shoton Festival. Every year on the last day of the sixth month of the Tibetan calendar, Buddhists display the giant Thangka of Great Buddha on the hillside of the Drepung Monastery for tourists and devout believers to worship.\n\nThe Drepung Monastery was built in 1416 by Tsong Khapa\u2019s fourth disciple Jamyang Choskyi. Tsong Khapa is the founder of the Gelug sect of Tibetan Buddhism. Now, the 250,000-square-meter monastery is the biggest Buddhist temple in Tibet, with a 4,500-square-meter architectural complex of the Tsochin Assembly Hall, Buddhas of Three Periods Hall, Four Dratsangs, and Gaden Podrang Hall. All these buildings are surrounded by white exterior walls which look like large piles of rice from a distance, and thus the monastery was named \u201cDrepung,\u201d meaning \u201cpiles of rice\u201d in the Tibetan language.\n\nOriginating from the period of the fifth Dalai Lama, the Buddha-basking Ceremony in the Drepung Monastery usually starts before daybreak when disciples and visitors converge from all directions onto the solemn and respectful square of the Tsochin Assembly Hall, waiting patiently for the sacred ceremony.\n\nAt dawn, guided by Buddhists holding ritual instrument in hands, the giant Thangka in the monastery will be carried by scores of lamas all the way to the big platform built along the hillside to finally unfold and display. Crowds of people immediately make way for the Great Buddha, soon converging and then joining the long queue walking forward. The participation in the transportation of the Thangka with Buddha Sakyamuni\u2019s image is such an honor, that even people far away will throw different colors of Khada, a brightly colored scarf, and mascots to show their homage and blessing.\n\nIn the first ray of sunshine, as the blaring horn and scripture reciting goes on, a huge figure of Sakyamuni embroidered in color is gradually unfolded on the cliffs, approximately six or seven stories high, showcasing a solemn and peaceful countenance of the Great Buddha. Then, followers will begin to worship and present Khada, and pray for safety, happiness, and fortune.\n\nThe ceremony lasts for the whole morning and at around 2 pm, the giant Thangka will be cautiously rolled up and escorted back to the Drepung Monastery, to wait for next year\u2019s Shoton Festival.\n\n\u2013 Gala in Norbulingka Most activities of the Shoton Festival are celebrated in Norbulingka in the western suburb of Lhasa. In the Tibetan language, \u201cNorbulingka\u201d means \u201ctreasure garden.\u201d Norbulingka Park used to be the Summer Palace of Dalai Lama. At each year\u2019s Shoton Festival, people will get together with family members in Norbulingka, set up colorful tents and carpets, and bring beverages and delicacies to enjoy the blissful time. Under the straight white poplars, on the green grassland, along the river bank, Tibetan people with flamboyant costumes sitting in groups of three or five can be seen everywhere, singing, dancing, drinking, or playing chess. Tibetan Opera shows are performed on the second day of the Shoton Festival, at which point Opera troupes will continually sing every morning from 11 am until night falls. Besides the traditional Buddha display, the Shoton Festival is now more enjoyable with art shows, horse races, hiking conventions around the Namtso Lake, and a \u201cShoton Star\u201d singer contest; in addition, business negotiations, merchandise exhibitions, tourism and entertainment are all included. \u2013 Thangka Thangka is a scroll painting with Tibetan Buddha images on silk, often kept unframed and rolled up when not on display, with a further silk cover on the front. Tibetan history, politics, culture, and social life can all be depicted on this scroll in a religious and ethnic style. Thangka, passed down from generation to generation, are all made from precious materials such as gold, silver, pearl, agate, coral, turquoise, malachite, and cinnabar; and are painted with herbal dyes made from saffron, Chinese rhubarb, and indigo. The natural materials ensure that bright colors don\u2019t fade after hundreds of years. The process to make a Thangka is often complicated and adheres to a series of strict standards, including the painting prelude, canvas making, picture composition, coloring and dyeing, drawing the outline, dyeing the gold and silver colors, highlighting eyes on the countenance, and stitching brocade; and then the Thangka must be blessed by eminent monks. The whole process will take at least half a year, while some complicated ones need more than 10 years. \u2013 Tibetan Opera The Tibetan Opera usually has three main parts: a prelude, an episodic show, and an ending ceremony. In the prelude dance, characters perform paying homage to deities, praying, blessing, and give a brief introduction to the plot; the episodic show presents the audience with different stories in various performance forms, from singing and dancing to rhyming lines and monologue; while in the ending ceremony, as drums and cymbals play, all performers will dance and sing and at the same time, extend their propitious wishes to the audience."}, {"url": "https://en.tibet3.com/news/tibet/2019-08-27/4972.html", "page_content": "A Group of Tibetan\n\nMost people around the world have heard of Tibet, the land of high mountains, permanent snow, and the Buddhism. However, there are a lot of facts about Tibet that most people rarely know, and even fewer understand. From the weather to the languages and the people themselves, knowing a little about where you are going before you get there can help to make your Tibet Tour even more exciting.\n\nWhere is Tibet?\n\nThe Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) is one of the westernmost provinces of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and lies on the border with India to the south and west, with Nepal to the west and Bhutan to the south within the borders with India. Ringed on the southern and western sides by the mighty Himalayas, this vast land lies on the world\u2019s highest plateau. To the east lie the provinces of Yunnan, Sichuan, and Gansu, and to the north are Qinghai Province and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.\n\nGeography of Tibet\n\nTibet has a unique topography and geography, and varies in elevation from the northwest to the southeast. Ringed by the main body of the Himalayas, the plateau is crisscrossed by the mountain ranges of the Transhimalaya, including the famous Gangdise Mountains (Mount Kailash) and the Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains closer to Lhasa. The landscape ranges from dense green forests to arid deserts and dry moonscapes, and high mountain ranges to the deepest river canyons. Vast areas of prairies and grasslands stretch across the plateau, and four of the world\u2019s most important rivers start their course to the seas from this high-altitude region. With such a diverse geography and climate, the plateau is home to a huge number of endemic animals, plants, and birds.\n\nMt.Qomolangma-Highest Mountain in the world\n\nWeather in Tibet\n\nKnowing some more the weather in Tibet is one of most important fact to make your Tibet travel easy and well prepared. Due to the higher altitude of the plateau, most people think it snows all year round here. It doesn\u2019t, but the weather can be unlike any you have ever encountered. Across most of the region, the weather is considered to be harsh, and at elevations above 4,500 meters, it is possible to see snow late in the spring and autumn seasons.\n\nTibet has a four-season monsoon climate, and despite being subject to the Indian Southwest Monsoon in the summer months from June to September, the plateau actually sees a lot less rain than any other monsoon climate. The height of the Himalayas actually filters out most of the rain before it gets there, leaving a lot less to fall on the plateau.\n\nTemperatures, however, can be a troublesome thing in Tibet. While even in the winter months, areas such as Lhasa can be pleasantly warm, with temperatures of around 10-12 degrees, other areas can have daytime temperatures as low as -10 degrees in winter. In the summer, it is not uncommon to find warm temperatures up to 24 degrees in the warmer areas, despite the harsh conditions, and even at Mt. Qomolangma (known as Mount Everest in west) Base Camp, the summer sees temperatures of up to 14-16 degrees. So the Mount Qomolangma Base Camp Trekking is very popular and the temperature is very favorable during summer.\n\nHowever, it is the nights that make the difference. After the sun drops below the horizon, temperatures can drop very quickly, often dropping to around or below freezing in less than a couple of hours. At Mount Qomolangma Base Camp, the temperature at night can drop to freezing in May, and as low as -17 in January but normally the temperature at night during summer will be above minus.\n\nFounder of Tibetan Scripture\n\n\n\nTibetan Language\n\nThe Tibetan language is one of the two official languages in Tibet, and has its origins in the 7th century, when Buddhist texts first began appearing. While Standard Tibetan is the main version, there are also several variations throughout the plateau, which have grown from the original spoken word over the millennia.\n\nClassic Tibetan as a script is the standard form of writing for all Tibetan variants, and is a form of Abugida, such as is used in writing Dzongkha (Bhutan), Sikkimese, and Ladakhi. The creation of the Tibetan alphabet is normally attributed to Thonmi Sambhota, a minister of Songtsen Gampo. It is said that he went to India to study the art of writing Sanskrit, and introduced a form of Indic alphabet on his return.\n\nMore akin to the script of Kashmir than Chinese, the modern Tibetan alphabet has 34 characters, and has little in common with the western Roman alphabet.\n\nTibetan Population\n\nDespite being the second largest province in China (Xinjiang is the largest), Tibet has the lowest density of population in the entire country. With a land area of 1.228 million km2, Tibet actually covers around 12.8% of the total area of China, but has an average of only two people per square kilometer.\n\nThe total population of the Tibetan people is estimated to be around 6 million, but only around 3.18 million actually live in the Tibet Autonomous Region. The rest live in the Tibetan-inhabited areas of Sichuan, Gansu, Yunnan, and Qinghai. With such a low number of people living on the plateau, mostly in the southern and eastern areas, this vast land is open and untouched in many areas, with virgin forests and hidden valleys yet to be discovered.\n\nDrepung Monastery-One of the largest Tibet Buddhist Monastery\n\n\n\nTibetan Religion\n\nThe major religion of Tibet is Tibetan Buddhism, and around 80 percent of the Tibetans within the TAR are Buddhists. However, there are still around 12% of the population of Tibet that still follow the ancient animistic and shamanistic practices of Bon, the pre-cursor to Buddhism on the plateau. A small minority of Tibetans are Muslim, around 0.4%, and there is a small community of Roman Catholics in Shannan Prefecture.\n\nBuddhism has been practiced in Tibet since the 7th century, though it was sporadic and disorganized until the late 10th century. Buddhism first came to Tibet under the reign of the Tibetan Kings of the Yarlung Dynasty, and was first formally introduced in the 7th century, under the reign of the Tibetan king, Songtsen Gampo, who married at least two Buddhist wives (Princess Bhrikuti of Nepal and Princess Wencheng of the Tang Dynasty).\n\nBuddhism\u2019s official position was established in the 8th century, but during the 9th and early 10th centuries, King Langdarma, who was an anti-Buddhist Bon follower, began a reversal of the influence of Buddhism in Tibet. After his death, the Tubo Kingdom crashed and civil wars ensued, even between Buddhists and Bon followers.\n\nHowever, Buddhism survived this period of fragmentation, and grew stronger in the 11th century, with the arrival of the Buddhist master, Atisha, from India and the founding of the Kadampa School of Tibetan Buddhism, the first official sect of Tibetan Buddhism. Since the 1th century, Buddhism has had its strongest influence on the people of the plateau, and remains today the major religion of the Tibetans.\n\n(The article is provided by Explore Tibet)"}, {"url": "https://en.tibet3.com/religion/2016-11-24/1994.html", "page_content": "The Ganden Monastery is located on the Wangpori Mountain sitting at an altitude of 3800 meters within the Dagz\u00ea County of Lhasa.

(Xinhua/Wu Gang)\n\nBEIJING, Aug. 25 (Xinhua) -- Affected by global warming, China's Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has grown warmer and wetter over recent decades, contributing to the occurrence of extreme weather and climate events, a study has shown.\n\nThe plateau has been warming faster than any other region in the country over the past 60 years, according to the findings of the study released on the China Meteorological Administration website on Tuesday.\n\nFrom 1961 to 2020, temperatures in the region have climbed steadily at a rate of 0.35 degrees Celsius every 10 years, more than twice the global average, while annual precipitation has risen an average of 7.9 mm every 10 years.\n\nExperts have said that the influences of such changes on the region are complicated: While a warmer climate has made the region greener and expanded the habitats of wild animals, extreme weather is more likely to occur in the region.\n\nDue to rising temperatures, extreme climate events and disasters such as blizzards, thunderstorms, landslides and debris flows have increased significantly over the past four decades.\n\nA warmer and wetter plateau could also lead to biodiversity loss, shrinking glaciers and vegetation growth changes in the region, the study has shown.\n\nClimate change is a major factor affecting vegetation growth on the plateau, scientists said, stressing that the increased vegetation in the area over the past 30 years is basically in line with most regions around the world.\n\nYet the current warming trend has shown no sign of stopping. Experts estimate temperatures will continue to rise, with the region facing greater risks of climate and environmental disasters.\n\nDespite plenty of studies conducted on the plateau, there are still many uncertainties about how a changing plateau will impact the global climate and how different climate systems will interact with each other, experts said.\n\nTo restore the plateau's ecosystem and ensure its sustainable development, scientists advised the region to put in place a three-dimensional observation network for climate change, build up data collection and early warning capacities, and conduct deeper research into climate change patterns in the region.\n\nWith the highest elevation in the world's mid-latitude region, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is highly sensitive to the impact of global warming. The region is known as \"the water tower of Asia\" as it houses abundant glaciers vital to the regional water cycle and water resources in downstream areas."}, {"url": "http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/ctenglish/2018/sl/201802/t20180206_800116765.html", "page_content": "By JANE LU\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Due to its broad territory and diverse natural environment, China is home to the widest range of wildlife species with 6,266 kinds of vertebrates, including 2,404 kinds of terrestrial animals and 3,862 kinds of fish, which make up nearly 10 percent of the world\u2019s vertebrates. The giant panda, the snub-nosed monkey, the South China tiger, the brown-eared pheasant, the red-crowned crane, the crested ibis, the white-flag dolphin, and the Chinese alligator are some of China \u2019s rare species of wild animals. This year, we have created a column to introduce some of these animals.\n\nTHE Tibetan antelope inhabits the harsh steppe areas at an elevation of 4,000 to 6,000 km , and is under China \u2019s highest level of protection. The government has established three national nature reserves in Tibet , Qinghai , and Xinjiang. The locations are around the Kunlun Mountains and Altun Mountain in Western China, among which Hoh Xil in Qinghai Province is the best known.\n\nThe lifespan of a Tibetan antelope is about eight years on average. A mother antelope, around two years of age, usually breeds for the first time and a single cub is born. Mating occurs in November and December. The gestation lasts for seven to eight months. Every summer pregnant females travel along fixed routes to Hoh Xil to give birth, where grass and water are plenty while natural enemies are few, especially around the Drone Lake and Taiyang Lake . The rich variety of food and relatively safe environment are favorable for breeding and raising baby antelopes. Soon afterwards, the females make the return journey together with their babies. It was not a few years ago that grand scenes of mass migration of about 2,000 Tibetan antelopes could be seen.\n\nThe Tibetan antelope is timid by nature, and can run at a speed of 80 km per hour. Male antelopes are also called unicorns in China , as their symmetrical angles look like a single horn from afar. They have developed thick underfur for the harsh climate.\n\nThere used to be millions of Tibetan antelopes according to historical records, but the population had plummeted since the 1990s and dropped to about 50,000 to 75,000 in the mid-1990s. People could only see scattered antelopes in the previously densely populated areas. Therefore, it was listed among the first-class protected species under the National Wildlife Protection Law. Hunting and trade are strictly forbidden. In 2008, it was listed as an endangered species on the Red List of Threatened Species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).\n\nOne reason to account for this is the more occurrences of extreme weather. The antelopes, especially females and the young, are susceptible to death in the freezing cold weather.\n\nA staff member at Sanandaj Natural Protection Station in Hoh Xil strives to protect Tibetan antelopes.\n\nAnother cause is human encroachment on their habitats. The reclamation of uninhabited areas led to a reduced area for antelopes\u2019 habitation. For instance, rare animals such as kiangs and Tibetan antelopes used to live in the uninhabited area \u2013 Shuanghu County on the northern Changtang Plateau. Since the mid-1970s, however, people came and turned it into pastures, disrupting hundreds of square kilometers of the ecological environment. Another example is the Ulan Ula Lake and Taiyang Lake in western Qinghai Province . After the discovery of gold mines, people flocked in and destroyed the primeval vegetation, making it increasingly difficult for Tibetan antelopes to survive.\n\nHowever, the ultimate reason for the drastic decline of antelope population is human greed. Poachers rampantly kill the animals for hides, as the exceptionally fine and soft underfur can be woven into a luxury shawl \u2013 Shahtoosh. Illegal poachers usually smuggle the fur, called \u201csoft gold,\u201d to Nepal and India and finally to countries such as Italy and France . In addition, the pitch-black antlers of male antelopes are regarded a rare medical material, and the heads used to be a kind of fancy decorations, thus making antelopes a target for illegal hunters and smugglers. In May 2003, the police cracked a big case of armed poachers who killed more than 1,000 antelopes. According to incomplete statistics, about 20,000 antelopes were poached from 1980 to 2005. The life of antelopes was disturbed and breeding affected because of poaching.\n\nIn this connection, the Chinese government set up nature reserves, cracked down on poaching, and sought international cooperation in banning illegal trade of antelope fur products. In 1999, an international symposium on antelope protection and trade controls was held in Xining , capital of Qinghai Province . Representatives from seven countries including China , France , India , Italy , Nepal , and the U.K. reached consensus and issued The Xining Declaration.\n\nIn addition, numerous volunteers have participated in protection efforts by saving injured young antelopes, prohibiting illegal earth and sand digging, and raising people\u2019s awareness of environmental protection. During migration season, staff and volunteers could be seen regularly near the Qinghai-Tibet Highway , stopping vehicles to allow the antelopes to cross. When the Qinghai-Tibet Railway was under construction, antelopes\u2019 migration was given special attention. Thirty-three special passageways \u2013 with a width of one to two km \u2013 were built along the migration routes in Changtang Plateau and Hoh Xil. Thanks to years of anti-poaching efforts, the antelope population in Tibet has grown to 170, 000 at the end of 2012."}, {"url": "https://en.tibet3.com/news/2022-02/14/content_100006893.html", "page_content": "BEIJING -- Chinese geologists revealed when and how the Central Tibetan Valley elevated from a low valley into its current soaring height, providing new clues to the formation of the roof of the world.\n\nThe study published Thursday in the journal Science Advances showed that the Central Tibetan Valley was at a relatively low elevation of 1,700 meters between 50 and 38 million years ago, sustaining a subtropical \"Shangri-La\" diverse ecosystem.\n\nIt rose rapidly to become a part of what is now the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, at an elevation over 4,000 meters between 38 and 29 million years ago, according to the study.\n\nChinese and British scientists led by Ding Lin from the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research under the Chinese Academy of Sciences collected a large number of samples from the Lunpola Basin within the center of the Valley for radiometric dating and clumped isotope analysis.\n\nThey found nine layers of volcanic tuffs there, and established the absolute age framework across ancient sediments in the basin, thus revealing the exact point of geological transition.\n\nThe study showed that, along with the elevation and the cooling of the global climate, the temperature and precipitation in the central plateau decreased significantly.\n\nThereafter, climate change transformed the place from one that hosted a warm-humid, low-elevation subtropical ecosystem serving as an incubator for today's exceptional Asian biodiversity, to a high, cold-dry alpine ecosystem, according to the study.\n\nFurther, Ding's team proposed a new model of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau formation, in which the subducting Lhasa mantle fell away and/or was thermally eroded, allowing the upwelling of the asthenosphere, a thin semifluid layer of the earth.\n\nThis process softened the crust above and facilitated the northward movement of India, finally giving rise to multiple high mountains including the Himalayas, according to the study."}, {"url": "http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/english/spc/2017-02/04/content_742457.htm", "page_content": "By WANG SHUO\n\nMORNING in Shangri-La features bright sunshine and a blue sky. Songtsam Shangri-La (L\u00fcgu) Lodge sits just between the Ganden Sumtseling Monastery and a small village called Kainag. In the yard is a four-storey Tibetan-style building where Baima Dorji was born and grew up. Today, he has built his home into one of the best boutique travel lodges in China.\n\nBaima Dorji built his home into one of the best boutique travel lodges in China.\n\nThe hotel, opened in 2001, is the first Songtsam lodge Baima set up. The hotel chain has six lodges, all in Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan, and in 2017 new hotels will be launched in Li-jiang and Lhasa.\n\nBaima displays much hand-made Tibetan furniture, as well as handicrafts and decorations in his hotels. He said that at first, he just wanted to make the hotels a medium to introduce Tibetan culture to the outside world. \u201cAs the operation continued, I realized that I wanted to make my hotels a spiritual haven rather than just an exhibition center,\u201d said Baima. He understood what urban residents longed for, and wanted to create a place for them to enjoy fresh air. \u201cPeople come here to escape from pressure and fierce competition in their busy city lives.\u201d\n\nIntroducing Tibetan Culture\n\nBaima is in fact a newcomer to the hotel industry. He studied veterinary medicine at a vocational school in Kunming, capital city of Yunnan, and worked as a veterinarian in his hometown for two years. At that time a local TV station had just been established. Baima became interested in the sector, so started to learn TV program production. He got an internship at the Yunnan TV Station, that gave him the opportunity to study at the Beijing Film Academy.\n\nSongtsam Cizhong Lodge beside the Lancang River is adjacent to the famous Cizhong Catholic Church. Yu Xiangjun\n\nAfter leaving the Tibetan-inhabited areas, Baima found that many people didn\u2019t understand, or even misunderstood Tibetan culture. \u201cMany of my friends thought the Tibetan-inhabited areas were full of snow mountains with eagles flying above and that the Tibetan people were boorish, but that is not true,\u201d said Baima. \u201cMany Tibetans are also introverted and reserved.\u201d\n\nHe suddenly got the inspiration to make TV programs to facilitate mutual understanding between Tibetans and people of other ethnic groups. In 1992, Baima worked at China Central Television (CCTV), where he made documentaries on Tibetan culture that were very popular. Among them the Dashan de Xiaoxiang (literally meaning \u201cthe image of the mountain\u201d), made in 1998, was selected for the Cannes Film Festival. It told of a traditional village in a mountainous area of Yunnan Province.\n\nWhen working at CCTV, Baima kept studying and became clearer about what he wanted to do. He planned to set up a platform to better introduce the Tibetan culture, and so enhance mutual understanding among different ethnic groups.\n\nSongtsam Tacheng Lodge is beside flourishing vineyards and faces green croplands.Yu Xiangjun\n\nAt that time, Baima\u2019s colleagues often complained about the poor accommodation at Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture where Baima\u2019s hometown is located. Baima immediately thought of the many boutique travel lodges in Paris, having stayed in one near the Arc de Triomphe. He started thinking about transforming his home, which consists of two yards and occupies an area of over 1,000 square meters, into such a hotel.\n\nIn 2001, Baima rebuilt his houses into the Song-tsam Shangri-La (L\u00fcgu) Lodge, which had 22 rooms. The same year, Zhongdian County in Diqing was officially renamed Shangri-La.\n\nBreathtaking View\n\nThe operation didn\u2019t go well at first, due to cashflow problems. Baima invited professionals from Germany and Austria to help, but to no avail.\n\nIn 2003, Baima decided to run the hotel himself. He stayed there and shared with his workers his ideas about a cultural experience. Baima also hired locals who were able to introduce Tibetan religion, culture and history to guests. \u201cI want my guests to experience local culture and enjoy living closer to nature,\u201d said Baima.\n\nSongtsam Meili Lodge, hidden in a small Tibetan village, all of whose windows offer imposing views of Minling Mountain.\n\nThe increasing fame of the hotel attracted many investors, but Baima turned them down: \u201cI knew I was not ready to introduce capital at that time.\u201d Diqing is where the three rivers \u2013 Jinsha River, Lancang River, and Nujiang River \u2013 run parallel and create breathtaking scenery. Baima believes the tourist resources in Diqing are rare and precious. \u201cI didn\u2019t open the lodge to make money. Unless I have a suitable plan to develop it, I\u2019d better not. Better to leave it to offspring.\u201d\n\nBaima spent almost a decade on research and experiments, but never pursued aggressive expansion or heavy publicity. In 2006, Baima met a partner who shared similar thoughts and they made their plan. In 2009, the Songtsam Linka Retreat, a watchtower-style building which sits on the mountain slope opposite the Ganden Sumtseling Monastery, opened. Since 2011, the four Songtsam hotels in the hinterland of Diqing opened one after another.\n\nIn handpicked locations, all lodges enjoy beautiful natural settings. Combining stays at different lodges, one can form a circuitous trip with Songtsam Linka as its center. \u201cWe hope that our hotels are like the courier stations in olden times where visitors can stay for a rest and enjoy different views at each lodge.\u201d\n\nDeparting from the Shangri-La Lodge, it takes about one hour\u2019s drive to Benzilan Lodge, which lies along a stretch of the Jinsha River. Benzilan Lodge was established in a small village hidden in the valley, and houses only 10-odd families. A sandstone road connects it with the outside world, but in history it was a stop along the Tea-Horse Trail. The windows of the lodge rooms face gorgeous views of a mountain pass and under the windows is cropland belonging to local households.\n\nSongtsam Shangri-La (L\u00fcgu) Lodge features a wide range of Tibetan-style ornamentations and furniture, including wooden cabinets, figures of Buddha, Thangka paintings and tapestries.\n\nLeaving the Benzilan Lodge and climbing the Baima Mountains, visitors soon reach Deqen County beside the Lancang River. There they can appreciate the imposing views of Minling Mountain. The Song-tsam Meili Lodge enjoys a superior location as all its windows directly face this magnificent snow mountain which is sometimes covered by cloud and mist.\n\nFurther south along the Lancang River Valley is the Cizhong Catholic Church, built by French missionaries in the early 1900s. The Songtsam Cizhong Lodge is only 200-odd meters from the church. Through the window can be seen several vineyards hidden in the mist. As the Catholic missionaries introduced grape cultivation and winemaking to this village, almost every household here grows grapes on this land at an elevation of over 3,000 meters that produce delectable wine.\n\nIt takes about four hours to drive from Cizhong to Tacheng Town, where there is a famous scenic spot \u2013 Bodhidharma\u2019s Cave. The Songtsam Tacheng Lodge is ensconced among the villages, terraced fields, mountains and rivers here.\n\nEnjoy Inner Peace\n\nGuests at the Songtsam hotels are always amazed at the wide range of Tibetan-style ornamentations and furniture displayed in the lobby, restaurants and guestrooms.\n\nIn fact, many of them are private collections belonging to Baima Dorji. When asked why he puts these precious items in the public area where they could easily be damaged, Baima explained: \u201cThose items will feel \u2018depressed\u2019 if they can\u2019t be appreciated by people over time.\u201d To his mind, the value of his collection is to share them with people.\n\nAutumn-hued trees in the Songtsam Shangri-La (L\u00fcgu) Lodge yard.\n\nTo best preserve the original looks of the villages and natural environment, Baima insisted on the most traditional type of construction. He hired local carpenters, stonemasons and coppersmiths. When building the Songtsam Linka Retreat, Baima found a very good coppersmith. He had considered changing his profession to relief sculpture as it is more profitable. \u201cI told him that I would employ him for as long as he wants to work,\u201d said Baima. \u201cNow we have five of our own coppersmiths. They made all the copperware in the hotels, from basins and pots to door bolts.\u201d\n\nBaima also cooperates with local handicraftsmen by taking hotel guests to the workshops where they make black pottery, so to boost development of local craftsmanship.\n\nBaima pointed out that today many people have a limited understanding of the essence of Tibetan culture. For example, color paintings. \u201cSome Tibetan families spend a huge amount on home decoration, but what they buy are showy, superficial decorative paintings.\u201d Baima said frankly that some art traditions were lost and abandoned during the \u201ccultural revolution\u201d (1966-1976). \u201cAs a matter of fact, the Tibetan culture respects introversion and solemnness,\u201d said Baima.\n\nIn order to show people authentic Tibetan culture, Baima personally modulated the colors for several paintings in the Songtsam hotels. He blended the colors by imitating the tone of hundreds of old paintings that he collected in Tibet.\n\nBorn in a small village, Baima understands the importance of education. Since 2005, he has given financial support to children in his home village for their education. Moreover, he has helped local children to attend school in areas where Songtsam hotels are located. The allocation is RMB 500, RMB 1,000 and RMB 2,000 per year for a middle school student, a high school student, and a college student respectively. \u201cLife is a long journey,\u201d Baima said, \u201cand helping others will make it more meaningful.\u201d\n\nToday, over 98 percent of the employees at the Songtsam lodges are from the locality. \u201cThey treat the guests as their friends, which is in line with their belief that a close relationship should be formed among people. I think their emotions and beliefs touch the inner world of our guests,\u201d said Baima.\n\nAlong with the development of the business, Baima has found that his lodges are \u201cneeded by people.\u201d People under pressure can always feel at home at Baima\u2019s lodges to rest their bodies and souls.\n\nShangri-La represents a place of purity in people\u2019s hearts. However, for Baima, who grew up here, it is a home that makes every resident and visitor of this land happy.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that one day I can pick up my camera again to make some documentaries about Tibet, and share the Tibetan culture with more audiences,\u201d said Baima."}]}
