{"Charles Melville Hays was the president of the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR).": [{"url": "https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-victim/charles-melville-hays.html", "page_content": "Mr Charles Melville Hays, 55, was born at Rock Island, Illinois, USA, on 16 May 1856. He was educated at the public schools of Rock Island, and went to work for the Atlantic and Pacific Railway when he was 17. At 22 he was appointed secretary to the Manager of the Missouri Pacific Railway.\n\nHe married Clara Gregg in St. Louis Mo, 13 October 1881, and they had four daughters.\n\nIn 1889 he was appointed general manager of the entire Wabash Railway network. In 1896 he moved to Montreal to become general manager of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. It was Hays who convinced the Canadian Prime Minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, of the need for a second transcontinental railroad. To this extent, the Canadian government subsidized the Grand Trunk to the tune of $30-million, and in November 1902 construction of the railroad began. The company's board of directors in England, however, were more concerned with dividends than with risky expansion. Financing proved chaotic, and at the end of 1911 the railroad was 100-million in debt. Hays went to England for a directors meeting where he proposed to spend the companys way out of bankruptcy by upgrading rolling stock, double tracking and by building a chain of luxury hotels across Canada. Hays had already built the flagship hotel, the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier in Ottawa, and had plans for six others, including the Fort Garry in Winnipeg and the Macdonald Hotel in Edmonton.\n\nHe arrived in England \"looking fagged and tired,\" according to Alfred Smithers, Chairman of the Grand Trunk's board of directors. He was supposed to spend Easter in Paris with his daughter and son in law, Thornton and Orian Davidson, but in a letter to friends in Montreal on April 1, said he preferred to stay at Smithers country estate in Kent before sailing home on 10 April on the Titanic. The recipient is unknown, partly because the letter is so hard to decipher, it is possibly Lockett Gavin Coleman, asst. superintendant of the Grand Trunk Railroad but the informality of the letter suggests it was to a close friend or relative.\n\n\n\n(Courtesy and \u00a9 Craig Sopin,USA / Courtesy: Alan Hustak, Canada)\n\nDear [?Marin / Mavin] I thought you would be interested in seeing the decision in the [?Flessen - a law suit of that time] case + so enclose you the synopsis of same which please keep for my scrap book after you have read.

Hays\n\nWhile in England he recieved news that the third of his four daughters, Louise, was having a difficult pregnancy and might have to be delivered by Ceasearean section. ANother reason for his return was the imminent opening of the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier Hotel on April 26. Travelling with him would be Paul Romaine Chevr\u00e9, the sculptor who had done the bust of Laurier that still stands in the lobby.\n\nIn his business dealings Hays had had discussions with the White Star Line about speeding travellers from Europe to the Orient using White Star ships and his transcontinental railroad. As a result, J. Bruce Ismay invited Hays and his entourage as guests aboard Titanic. They paid \u00a393 10s to cover incidental expenses, travelled on ticket number 12749, and occupied four cabins: B-69-71-73 and B-24. (Mr and Mrs Hays in B-69, Thornton and Orian Davidson in B-71, their maid Miss Perreault in B-73 and Hays secretary, Vivian Payne, in B-24).\n\nOne hour before the disaster, Hays relaxed with Colonel Archibald Gracie and Captain Edward Crosby in the Gentlemen's Smoking Lounge and they talked about the technological advances in transportation. At one point, Hays conceded that while Titanic was a superlative vessel, he expressed concern that \"the trend to playing fast and loose with larger and larger ships will end in tragedy.\" Twenty minutes later, Titanic struck the iceburg. Hays never believed the ship would sink quickly. As he put his wife and daughter into a lifeboat he assured them Titanic would stay \"afloat for at least 10 hours.\"\n\nHays drowned in the disaster, but the Minia recovered his body on 26 April. \"It was no trouble to identify him as he had a lot of papers on him and a watch with his name on it,\" sailor Francis Dyke wrote to his mother. His coffin was brought back to Montreal for burial aboard his private railway car, Canada. The car is still preserved and on display at the Canadian Railway Museum near Delson, Quebec.\n\nSimultaneous funerals for Hays were held on 8 May at the American Presbyterian Church in Montreal...\n\n\n\n(Courtesy: Alan Hustak, Canada)\n\nand at the Church of St. Edmund King and Martyr in London. At 11:30 a.m. on the day of the funeral, as the Montreal Herald Reported:\n\n\"From Montreal to Chicago, from New Brunswick to the Pacific coast, in all the thousands of miles of sidings and branch lines owned and operated by the Grand Trunk Railway, in every Grand Trunk Depot, at every Grand Trunk crossing, action ceased for the space of five full minutes as the Grand Trunk Railway system paid its respects to the memory of its great departed chief. For five minutes activities were suspended and the thousands of individuals who serve the great system invarious capacities bowed their heads in silent tribute. Then once more work resumed, the wheels turned, and in 30 seconds things had been as they had before.\"\n\n\n\nCourtesy: Alan Hustak, Canada\n\nHays is buried in the Pine Hill Section, (Lot 246) of Montreals' Mount Royal Cemetery.

He was born at Rock Island, Ill., May 16, 1856. His school education was completed when he was 17 years of age.\n\n\n\nHis first work in the railroad world was in the passenger department of the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad in St. Louis. He was soon promoted to an important position in the ofice [sic] of the auditor of the road, and later was transferred to the General Superintendent's office, where he remained until 1877. That year he was made Secretary to the General Manager of the Missouri Pacific Railroad. In 1886 he became Assistant General Manager of the road. One year later he was appointed General Manager of the Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific, and later became Manager of the Wabash Western.\n\n\n\nWhen the consolidation of the Wabash lines took place, Mr. Hays was made Vice President of the company and General Manager of the lines of the whole system. This position he retained until his Grand Trunk appointment. At that period he held the following directorships and important railroad positions: Director of the Chicago & Western Indiana Belt Railway of Chicago, Detroit Union Railway and Station Company, Keokuk Union Station Company, Kansas City Union Station Company, Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis and Chairman of its Executive Committee. He also represented the Wabash Railroad at the meetings of the Central Traffic Association, Western Passenger and Trunk Line Association. On Dec. 31, 1895, he resigned from the service of the Wabash Railroad, of which he was then General Manager and Vice President, to accept the position of General Manager of the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada, at Montreal.\n\n\n\nIn 1897 he completed the reorganization of the Central Vermont Railway Company, a subsidiary line of the Grand Trunk, of which he was then President, and in 1908 supervised the completion of the Victoria Jubilee open span double track bridge crossing the St. Lawrence River at Montreal, replacing the old single track, tubular bridge; and the single span steel arch bridge over the Niagara River at Niagara Falls, replacing the old suspension bridge at that point. Under his regime the main line of the Grand Trunk was double-tracked all the way from Ste. Rosalle, a point thirty-eight miles east of Montreal, to Chicago, a distance of 878 miles.\n\n\n\nUpon the death of the late Collis P. Huntington, the President and a large owner in the Southern Pacific Company and steamship lines, controling upward of 10,0000 miles, Mr. Hays was the first choice for his successor, and the appointment was made Jan. 1, 1901. In the Autumn of the same year, he resigned and was recalled to take charge of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, of Canada, becoming Second Vice President and General Manager Jan. 1, 1902.\n\n\n\nThe same year, Mr. Hays conceived the project of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, which Sir Wilfrid Laurier and his Government made possible by the passage of the necessary legislation in 1903 and 1904. This line will he the only transcontinental railway wholly within Canadian territory. It will rum from Moncton, N. B., to Prince Rupert, B. C., about 3,600 miles.\n\n\n\nOn Jan. 1, 1910, Mr. Hays was elected a member of the Board of Directors of the Grand Trunk Central Railway Company, and on that date was made President of the company and its consolidated lines and subsidiary railroad and steamship companies.\n\n\n\nMr. Hays has been in full charge of the company's affairs in America. A year ago Sir Wilfrid Laurier, at a dinner of the Canadian Club of New York, held at the Hotel Astor, said:\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Hays is beyond question the greatest railroad genius in Canada. As an executive genius he ranks second only to the late Edward H. Harriman.\""}, {"url": "http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=7430", "page_content": "HAYS, CHARLES MELVILLE, railway official; b. 16 May 1856 in Rock Island, Ill.; m. 13 Oct. 1881 Clara J. Gregg in St Louis, Mo., and they had four daughters; d. 15 April 1912 in the North Atlantic, and was buried in Montreal.\n\nCharles M. Hays grew up and received his early education in St Joseph, Mo. At 17 he began work in St Louis with the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. In 1878 he was appointed secretary to the general manager of the Missouri Pacific and six years later he accepted a similar position with the larger Wabash, St Louis and Pacific. He became general manager of the Wabash Western in 1887 and of the entire Wabash system in 1889.\n\nA reorganization of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada in 1895 resulted in Hays\u2019s appointment as general manager of that system, effective 1 Jan. 1896, and his move with his family to Montreal. His predecessor, Lewis James Seargeant, became a special adviser to the GTR\u2019s London-based board of directors. With one interruption, in 1901, Hays held his position until 1909, when he was appointed president; he was president as well of the railway\u2019s western Canadian subsidiary, the Grand Trunk Pacific, from 1904 until his death.\n\nHe had arrived in Canada at a time of economic depression. The performance of railways had been disappointing for years, although the Canadian Pacific Railway had fared better than the larger, more heavily indebted GTR. Hays was brought in to make major managerial changes \u2013 specifically to introduce \u201cAmerican\u201d methods which were more aggressive and less scrupulous than those of British systems. His first responsibility was to restructure the GTR\u2019s administration and operations. Instead of relying only on the reports and recommendations of senior administrators in Britain, he sought the opinions and advice of operating staff in Canada. Traffic exchanges with other systems, the negotiation of running rights, and the modernization of accounting procedures solved many of the practical problems left unaddressed by the head office. Hays was even willing to sell important trackage between Toronto and Hamilton to the rival CPR, but only after the GTR had obtained an advantageous agreement on running rights. The improved efficiency resulting from these reforms coincided with an era of unprecedented growth and enabled him to bring the GTR from a state of near-bankruptcy to one of moderate success. In the process, Hays, a stocky man who invariably appeared well dressed with a neat beard, became known for his unwillingness to tolerate any interference in the way he ran the railway and for his implacable disdain for organized labour, especially during a dispute in Ontario in 1905 and a bitter, system-wide strike in 1910.\n\nAfter 1896 Canadian prosperity was based on the settlement of the prairies. To compete effectively with the CPR, Hays believed the GTR had to cross them. In 1900 he had advanced a grandiose plan to run the lines of an American subsidiary, the Grand Trunk Western, from Chicago to Winnipeg and thence to the Pacific. The directors in London rejected this proposal and in late 1900 Hays resigned to become president of the Southern Pacific Railroad in the United States as of 1 Jan. 1901. Unfortunately for him, it was taken over by the interests of railway magnate Edward Henry Harriman. Hays disagreed with the new owners and quit; by the end of 1901 he had returned to his old job, and a vice-presidency, at the GTR. In the meantime its board had been persuaded by president Sir Charles Rivers Wilson to adopt an aggressive policy of westward expansion. Significantly too, the federal government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier had decided to promote the building of a second transcontinental railway. On the failure of the GTR and the smaller, prairie-based Canadian Northern to unite on such a project, Ottawa threw its support behind the GTR. On 24 Nov. 1902 Hays formally announced plans to construct a transcontinental.\n\nThe Grand Trunk Pacific, Hays\u2019s greatest and most controversial work in Canada, was to consist of two sections: a line west from Winnipeg and a government-built line between Winnipeg and Moncton, N.B., that was to connect with the old Grand Trunk system. Hays was responsible for the construction and operation policies of the new western line. His persistent demands for federal subsidization, however, contributed to bitter discord within Laurier\u2019s cabinet [see Andrew George Blair*], which could not agree on a policy. In May 1903 Hays was joined by president Sir Charles Wilson, who was able to exert greater influence on cabinet; together they formed an effective team, one tough, the other smooth. Hays was willing to promise whatever Wilson thought diplomatically necessary, but he did so only if there were no real means for the government to enforce terms that the GTP might find inconvenient in the future. Nevertheless, his concessions were critically important in meeting specific political difficulties faced by Laurier when he was promoting the transcontinental scheme in parliament that summer and fall. In October the National Transcontinental Railway Act was passed and the GTP was incorporated.\n\nFour aspects of Hays\u2019s GTP policies were particularly problematic. He seriously underestimated the Canadian Northern, whose owners he thought would sell out to him but who, instead, launched vigorous competition. A second, more difficult matter was the commitment of the GTR to the GTP. There were no existing traffic links between the two systems, and the board in London was not willing to give the western project its unqualified support. Nevertheless, Hays, acting without proper authorization from London, committed the parent company in 1903 to conditions which would ultimately ruin the GTP and the Grand Trunk. The selection in 1905 of the site of Prince Rupert, on Kaien Island, B.C., as the western terminal was the third controversial decision supported by Hays. There was little local traffic on the portion of the line in northern British Columbia, only 100 miles of which had been built by 1912, but Hays insisted that it would prove beneficial since it shortened the route to Asia.\n\nA final, disastrous decision involved the priority Hays gave to the construction of the GTP to the highest standards in North America, before a system of feeders had been developed on the prairies. The resulting delay in completion and the lack of competition allowed the CPR and the Canadian Northern to consolidate their holds on traffic on the prairies. Consequently, what was arguably the best main line across western Canada did not attract the volume of freight needed for profitable operation.\n\nHays did not live to see the GTP completed: he perished in the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. Sanctified by this tragic end and by his high social standing in Montreal, including membership in the American Presbyterian Church, he was eulogized as one of Canada\u2019s greatest railwaymen. On 25 April 1912 work and movement on the GTR\u2019s entire system stopped for five minutes in tribute. Hays\u2019s legacy, however, was mixed. He presided over the most prosperous era in the history of the GTR, but as president of the GTP he initiated policies and programs which led in 1919 to the GTP being placed in receivership and to legislation authorizing federal acquisition of the GTR\u2019s capital stock. During the proceedings of the board appointed to value this stock, it was alleged that Hays had deceived the London directors in 1903 and that they had never knowingly endorsed the scheme that led to the insolvency and nationalization of the entire system.\n\nTheodore D.

Starting out in the railroad business at age 17, he worked his way up to become general manager of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. During the planning stages of a trans-Canadian railway line, Hays booked passage aboard the RMS Titanic. When the great ship struck the iceberg on April 14, 1912, Hays made sure his wife and daughter made it into a lifeboat, but he himself perished in the sinking, on April 15, 1912.\n\nBackground\n\nBusinessman and president of the Grand Trunk Railway Charles Melville Hays was born on May 16, 1856, in Rock Island, Illinois. Working his way from the ground up, Hays became a giant in the railroad industry. Unfortunately, all of his wealth and success could not prevent him from becoming one of the victims of the Titanic disaster of 1912.\n\nEarly Career\n\nAt the age of 17, Hays started out in the passenger department for Atlantic & Pacific Railroad. Rising up the rankings, he became the secretary to the general manager of Missouri Pacific Railroad in 1877 and moved up to assistant general manager in 1886. The following year Hays was made the general manager of the Wabash Western.\n\nTranscontinental Expansion\n\nIn 1896, Hays moved to Montreal, Canada, to become the general manager of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. One of his greatest projects was planning a transcontinental railway line across Canada. The Canadian government supported the project, but still the company needed more funds. To that end, Hays traveled to England to improve the company's financial capabilities.\n\nPart of his plan included a series of luxury hotels along the new railway line. To attend the opening of the first hotel, the Chateau Laurier, Hays and his wife booked passage on the White Star Line's new luxury vessel, the Titanic. On April 10, 1912, the couple boarded the ship in Southampton for its maiden voyage. Their daughter Orian and her husband Thornton Davidson joined them, getting on the ship when it stopped at Cherbourg, France, later that day.\n\n'Titanic'\n\nOn the night of April 14, Hays was reportedly with Colonel Archibald Gracie and Captain Edward Crosby in a smoking lounge. The group discussed the competition between the ship lines to build the biggest, fastest and most luxurious vessels. In fact, the Titanic itself had been hailed a new breed of ship that was supposed to be unsinkable. Hays told his companions that the trend toward large boats might end in tragedy. Not long after this comment, the Titanic struck an iceberg.\n\nLike many of the other brave men onboard, Hays stayed behind as the lifeboats were filled with women and children first. His wife Clara and daughter Orian made it onto one of the boats. After Charles and Clara were separated, she called out to every other lifeboat they encountered, hoping that he had made it on one of them. Unfortunately, Hays did not survive, joining roughly 1,500 other souls who were lost with the Titanic.\n\nHis body was later recovered by the Minia, which docked at Halifax at the end of its gruesome mission. Hays was then taken by private railcar to Montreal where he was buried."}, {"url": "https://www.melville.ca/p/charles-melville-hays", "page_content": "From May 16, 1856 to April 15, 1912\n\nCharles Melville Hays began working for the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad in St. Louis, Missouri.

The evolution of this project began in 1902 when Charles Melville Hays, President of the GTR was given permission to prepare an application for federal assistance for a new railway to the Pacific but not permission to commit the Company to such a project. Hays\u2019s first plan for a western branch envisaged a line starting at Callander, Ontario and going west via Winnipeg and Edmonton following the original Sandford Fleming survey across the prairies. West from Edmonton, the line would use the Yellowhead Pass to reach the Pacific at Port Simpson. he Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP) was part of an ambitious plan developed by the Laurier Government and The Grand Trunk Railway to build a transcontinental railway from Moncton, New Brunswick to the Pacific. The evolution of this project began in 1902 when Charles Melville Hays, President of the GTR was given permission to prepare an application for federal assistance for a new railway to the Pacific but not permission to commit the Company to such a project. Hays\u2019s first plan for a western branch envisaged a line starting at Callander, Ontario and going west via Winnipeg and Edmonton following the original Sandford Fleming survey across the prairies. West from Edmonton, the line would use the Yellowhead Pass to reach the Pacific at Port Simpson.\n\nLaurier responded positively to this proposal since it gave him an opportunity to escape from an earlier commitment to support another railway to be built across the desolation of the Canadian Shield. The Trans-Canada Railway had been conceived by Colonel Church to serve the needs of the British Empire by linking its various parts in an All Red-Route. Despite its origins, support for this project had come from Quebec nationalists and the Roman Catholic Church who saw it as a way of settling the Canadian Shield and exploiting its mineral wealth.\n\nWhile supporting the Grand Trunk Railway in its efforts to extend its activities to the West, Laurier, having failed to insist on cooperation between the Canadian Northern and the Grand Trunk, countered with another proposal, that of constructing a \"National Transcontinental Railway.\" This new entity would consist of two divisions: the Western, from Winnipeg to the Pacific coast, would be built by the Grand Trunk Pacific, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Grand Trunk; and the Eastern, from Muncton to Winnipeg, would be built by the government (generally known as the National Transcontinental) and upon its completion would be leased to the Grand Trunk Pacific to operate. After a contentious debate in Parliament, the National Transcontinental Railway Act was proposed on September 2, 1903 and the Grand Trunk Pacific was incorporated on October 24, 1903. At the same time that the incorporation of the GTP was taking place in Ottawa, Hays was making contact with its potential supporters in the west. As a sample, the town council of Edmonton was approached by him for their support for the GTP, with the result that an agreement regarding terminal facilities was signed.\n\nThe GTP from Winnipeg to the Pacific Coast (Kaien Island, on which Prince Rupert was built was chosen as the terminus) was directed into two divisions--the Prairie from Winnipeg to Wolf Creek in Alberta, and the Mountain from Wolf Creek to the Coast.\n\nThe mainline was constructed to a high standard from the outset so that it would not be \"inferior to the main line of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada (parent company of the GTP) between Montreal and Toronto, so far as may be practicable in the case of a newly constructed line of railway.\" This required a well-constructed roadbed with grades not to exceed four-tenths of one percent, and curves to be four degrees or greater. To further enhance the standards of construction, the use of 85 pound rail to the yard on the prairies was mandated. But as Currie points out, \"the proposed standard of construction was suited to a busy railway in a thickly populated area...it was ill-fitted for a pioneer road on the sparsely settled Prairies: it was quite unrealistic for a railway through the mountains to the undeveloped port of Prince Rupert....\"\n\nThe first sod for the GTP was turned near Carberry, Manitoba on August 29, 1905 with steel reaching Edmonton in 1909, while the first train entered the city on August 13. Passenger service was inaugurated in 1910.\n\nAfter several surveys, GTP engineers had eliminated all but three possible passes--the Peace, Pine and Yellowhead, the latter being the most favoured. But the choice generated controversy with the Canadian Northern, which had a prior claim to that route, through its ownership of the charter of the Edmonton, Yukon and Pacific. However, the protests of the CNoR disallowing the use of the pass by the GTP were dismissed by the government, with the result that both companies ran their respective lines through it.\n\nTwo subsidiary companies of the GTP had an impact on the landscape of Alberta. In 1906 the Grand Trunk Pacific Branch Lines Company and the Grand Trunk Pacific Town and Development Company were incorporated. The Branch Line Company built a line from Tofield to Calgary, and opened up the country for the exploration of coal reserves by building a line from Bickerduke to Lovett, an area which became known as the Coal Branch. Both were in operation by 1913. Lacking land grants the GTP, through the Town and Development Company, purchased land along the main line and developed \"towns in precise patterns, at a distance of not under seven miles or more than fifteen miles from each other.\"\n\nGeoffrey Taylor, writing about the building of the GTP states that technology \u201chad changed little in its essentials since Langdon and Shepard laid the roadbed for the Canadian Pacific in the 1880s... the pick and shovel gang, the horse and dump wagon, and the scraper were still the mainstay of the contractor.\u201d\n\nNotes | Bibliography | Abbreviations\n\nCanadian National Railways, Vol. 2, Towards the Inevitable 1896-1922\n\nA History of Transportation in Canada\n\nCanadian Railway Development\n\nCanadian National Railways, Vol. 2\n\nThe Grand Trunk Pacific Raiwlay of Canada\n\nCanadian National Railways, Vol. 2\n\nThe Asians Dreams\n\nCanadian National Railways, Vol. 2\n\nCanadian National Railways, Vol. 2\n\nThe Railway Contractors"}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Charles-Melville-Hays", "page_content": "Charles Melville Hays (May 16, 1856 \u2013 April 15, 1912) was the president of the Grand Trunk Railway. He began working in the railroad business as a clerk at the age of 17 and quickly rose through the ranks of management to become the General Manager of the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway. He became Vice-President of that company in 1889 and remained as such until 1896 when he became General Manager of the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) of Canada.\n\nHays left GTR for a short time to serve as the President of the Southern Pacific Railway Company but returned to GTR after one year. As Vice-President and General Manager of GTR he is credited with keeping the company from bankruptcy. In 1909, he became the president of GTR and all its consolidated lines, subsidiary railroads, and steamship companies. He was known for his philanthropy and received the Order of the Rising Sun, third class, from the Emperor of Japan in 1907.\n\nHays is credited with the formation of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP), a dream he had to create a second transcontinental railroad within the borders of Canada. He is also blamed for the insolvency of both the GTR and the GTP. He died before his dream was complete as he perished at sea in the sinking of the RMS Titanic. Before the ship collided with an iceberg, Hays made a statement that was prophetic of the disaster. His body was recovered, and he was buried in Montreal. He was survived by his wife and four daughters.\n\nEarly years\n\nCharles Melville Hays was born in Rock Island, Illinois on May 16, 1856. His family moved to St. Louis, Missouri when he was a child.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 1873, at the age of 17, he began his career in the railroad business working for the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad in St. Louis. From 1877 to 1884, Hays was Secretary to the General Manager of the Missouri Pacific Railroad. Beginning in 1884, he held the same position with the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway until 1886, when he became that company's General Manager. In 1889, he became Vice-President of the Wasbash Railroad and remained as such until 1896, when he became General Manager of the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) of Canada.\n\nIn 1901, Hays left GTR to serve as the President of the Southern Pacific Railway Company but returned to the company in January 1902 as Vice-President and General Manager. In October 1909, he was appointed president of GTR, which also gave him control of its subsidiary railroad and steamship companies. These included the Central Vermont Railway, the Grand Trunk Western Railway, the Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway, the Detroit and Toledo Shoreline Railroad, the Toledo, Saginaw and Muskegon Railway, the Southern New England Railway Company, the Canadian Express Company, and several others. In addition, he was sought after to help manage several philanthropies. He was Governor of the Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, Montreal General Hospital and McGill University. He received the Order of the Rising Sun, third class, from the Emperor of Japan in 1907 for assistance he gave the Imperial Government Railways.\n\nWhen Hays became General Manager of GTR in 1896, it was near bankruptcy and under-performing its rival, the Canadian Pacific Railway(CPR). On the advice of American financier J. Pierpont Morgan, the GTR board selected Hays as General Manager to bring more aggressive, \"American\" business practices to the company. He reorganized the management of the company and successfully negotiated running rights with CPR. He also brought more efficiency to the handling of accounts, built new track and ordered more powerful locomotives. These changes produced an era of greater success for the railroad.\n\nTranscontinental Railway\n\nAt this time in Canadian history the western prairies were being rapidly settled. Hays wanted to capitalize on the trend by constructing a transcontinental railroad, within the borders of Canada, to run 3,600 miles from Moncton, New Brunswick, to Prince Rupert, British Columbia. In 1900, he introduced a proposal to extend the lines of the Grand Trunk Western, an American subsidiary, from Chicago to Winnipeg, \"and thence to the Pacific.\" However, he was turned down by the railroad's directors in London. Later that year, Hays left GTR to work for Southern Pacific, but a change in ownership there lead to his resignation. He returned to the GTR to find that the president, Sir Charles Rivers Wilson, had convinced the Board of Directors to pursue the transcontinental railway. Meanwhile, the government, under Sir Wilfrid Laurier, had also decided to back the project. Plans to construct the transcontinental line were announced on November 24, 1902.\n\nHays' plan involved the creation of a subsidiary line from Winnipeg to Prince Rupert, with the government building the line from New Brunswick to Winnipeg. The cabinet became weary of Hays' demands for subsidies, but after negotiations between the government and Hays, aided by the railroad's president Rivers Wilson, the National Transcontinental Railway Act was passed in 1903. It enabled the incorporation of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP). The government's portion of the line would be called the National Transcontinental Railway (NTR).\n\nThere were problems with some of Hays' policies regarding the GTP.\n\nFirstly, he had planned to buy out the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR), but the company resisted and instead provided competition.\n\nSecondly, Hays lacked support from the Board of Directors in London; he wanted to link the GTR with the GTP, but the board would not back this plan. He thus proceeded on his own authority, making commitments that would ultimately ruin both the GTP and the GTR.\n\nThirdly, Hays faced opposition to his choice of Prince Rupert, on Kaien Island, B.C., for the western terminal, because there was not much traffic there. Hays preferred the location as he believed it would provide a shorter route for transshipment to destinations in Asia.\n\nHays made the construction of the mainline his priority, failing to develop feeder lines. CNoR and CPR joined forces to gain control of the prairie traffic. The competition among the three railroads led to Canada's ending up with three transcontinental railways instead of one. This was to result in the GTP's being starved of traffic; even though it was arguably the best of the three, it ultimately failed to attract enough freight to make it profitable.\n\nAfter construction on the GTP began in 1905, Hays started the Grand Trunk Pacific Development Company in order to purchase thousands of acres of land on which he established town sites along the route of the railway, including Melville, Saskatchewan, which was named after him. Hays' vision went beyond the building of the railway. He also had plans for a fleet of ocean liners and a string of resort hotels across the Rocky Mountains. He hired the famed architect Francis Rattenbury from CPR to design a grand hotel, the Ch\u00e2teau Prince Rupert, at the westernmost stop on the railway. In 1909, only 3000 people lived in Prince Rupert, but anticipation of the railroad caused it to grow rapidly, despite the rapidly rising cost of property and the muddy environs. The city was incorporated in 1910.\n\nAfter Rivers Wilson retired as the railroad's president in 1909, Hays was appointed to fill the position. By 1910, Grand Trunk union workers were demanding wages on par with those of railroad workers in the United States. A strike put a stop to construction. Hays finally gave into the workers' demands but failed to re-hire 250 previously fired strikers, despite promising to do so. He also denied workers their pensions, causing one member of Parliament to describe him as \"heartless, cruel, and tyrannical\".\n\nBy 1912, the cost of constructing the railway was increasing, with rising wages and price increases on materials, while the government refused to allow a rate increase. Another reason for the mounting costs was Hays' insistence on \"building to the very highest standards\". Meanwhile, CNoR and CPR monopolized the traffic in the west. In addition, Grand Trunk, which would be leasing the NTR from the government, was responsible for paying back the construction cost of that line. Hays began to fear insolvency.\n\nTitanic\n\nIn April 1912, Hays was in London soliciting financial support for the GTP. He was anxious to get back to Canada for the opening of the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier in Ottawa, Ontario, named after Prime Minister Laurier. The gala opening of this hotel was set for April 25, 1912. Hays had also received news that his daughter Louise was having difficulty with her pregnancy.\n\nAdditionally, he might have had business with J. Bruce Ismay, chairman of the White Star Line; in any case, Ismay had invited Hays to join him on the RMS Titanic. Hays, his wife, Clara, his daughter, Orian (see source note), his son-in-law, Thornton Davidson, his secretary, Mr. Vivian Payne, and a maid, Miss Mary Anne Perreault, shared a deluxe suite (cabin B69) on the Promenade Deck.\n\nAt 11:40 pm on April 14, 1912, Titanic struck an iceberg. Hays helped the women in his party into one of the ship's 20 lifeboats, but he, his son-in-law, and his secretary remained and perished when the ship sank, along with 1,500 other Titanic passengers and crew. Hays was reported to have made a prophetic remark on the evening of the disaster; deploring the way the steamship lines were competing to win passengers with ever-faster vessels, he is said to have commented, \"The time will come soon when this trend will be checked by some appalling disaster.\"\n\nDeath\n\nHays' body was recovered from the waters of the North Atlantic by the Minia, and he was buried at Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal. Two funerals were held for him on May 8 \u2013 one at the American Presbyterian Church in Montreal, the other in London at the Church of St Edmund, King and Martyr\n\nAfter his death\n\nHays died before he could see the GTP through to completion. He was eulogized as one of the greatest railwaymen in Canada, and work on the GTR was stopped for five minutes, on April 25, 1912, in his memory. During the period in which Hays led the GTR it saw its most prosperous era.\n\nHowever, his policies led to the GTP's collapse in 1919. The company was placed in receivership, and the government seized GTR's stock. It was later alleged that Hays had deceived the company's London directors in 1903 by committing them to conditions in the railway's agreements with the Canadian government for the building of the GTP that they did not agree to. That scheme was blamed for the company's collapse.\n\nThe railroad car in which his body was transported back to Montreal is preserved at the Canadian Railway Museum near Delson, Quebec. There is a statue of him in Prince Rupert, and the city of Melville, Saskatchewan, is named after him, as is the village of Haysport, British Columbia.\n\nPersonal life\n\nHe was survived by his wife, Clara Jennings (n\u00e9e Gregg), whom he married in St. Louis, Missouri on October 13, 1881. They had four daughters: Orian (Mrs. Thornton Davidson, Mrs. Robert N. Hickson), Clara (Mrs. Hope Scott), Marjorie (Mrs. George Hall), and Louise (Mrs. Grier).\n\nSource note\n\nOne source used here (Hacking) names the daughter with Hays on the Titanic as \"Margaret\", however, it was daughter Orian who was traveling with her husband, Thorton Davidson. That source does not mention Orian as a passenger on the ship. There was a 24-year-old woman, named Margaret Bechstein Hays on the Titanic, but she was staying in a different compartment than the C.M. Hays party, with another group of people. She escaped via lifeboat No. 7 (with her Pomeranian, Lady), while the other Hays women boarded lifeboat No. 3. Early newspaper reports said that Clara and Margaret Hays, and Mrs. Thornton [Orian] Davidson disembarked the rescue ship in New York City together and boarded a train for Montreal, while other sources say that Margaret Hays lived in New York and took care of two young child survivors (Edmond and Michael Navratil), who were unclaimed immediately following the disaster. Margaret (Hays) Easton's 1913 wedding announcement says her father, Frank Hays, walked her down the aisle. Finally, Orian's death notice lists Marjorie (Mrs. George Hall)\u2014not Margaret Easton\u2014as a predeceased sister."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Charles-Melville-Hays/6000000016092549189", "page_content": "About Charles Melville Hays\n\nDictionary of Canadian Biography Online\n\nhttp://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-victim/charles-melvill...\n\nName: Mr Charles Melville Hays\n\nBorn: Friday 16th May 1856\n\nAge: 55 years\n\nLast Residence: in Montreal Qu\u00e9b\u00e9c Canada\n\nOccupation: Businessman\n\n1st Class passenger\n\nFirst Embarked: Southampton on Wednesday 10th April 1912\n\nTicket No. 12749 , \u00a393 10s\n\nCabin No.: B69\n\nDied in the sinking.\n\nBody recovered by: Minia (No. 307)\n\nBuried: Mount Royal Cemetery Montreal Qu\u00e9b\u00e9c Canada on Wednesday 8th May 1912.\n\nMr Charles Melville Hays, 55, was born at Rock Island, Illinois, USA, on 16 May 1856. He was educated at the public schools of Rock Island, and went to work for the Atlantic and Pacific Railway when he was 17. At 22 he was appointed secretary to the Manager of the Missouri Pacific Railway.\n\nHe married Clara Gregg in St. Louis Mo, 13 October 1881, and they had four daughters.\n\nIn 1889 he was appointed general manager of the entire Wabash Railway network. In 1896 he moved to Montreal to become general manager of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. It was Hays who convinced the Canadian Prime Minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, of the need for a second transcontinental railroad. To this extent, the Canadian government subsidized the Grand Trunk to the tune of $30-million, and in November 1902 construction of the railroad began. The company's board of directors in England, however, were more concerned with dividends than with risky expansion. Financing proved chaotic, and at the end of 1911 the railroad was 100-million in debt. Hays went to England for a directors meeting where he proposed to spend the company's way out of bankruptcy by upgrading rolling stock, double tracking and by building a chain of luxury hotels across Canada. Hays had already built the flagship hotel, the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier in Ottawa, and had plans for six others, including the Fort Garry in Winnipeg and the Macdonald Hotel in Edmonton.\n\nHe arrived in England \"looking fagged and tired,\" according to Alfred Smithers, Chairman of the Grand Trunk's board of directors. He was supposed to spend Easter in Paris with his daughter and son in law, Thornton and Orian Davidson, but in a letter to friends in Montreal on April 1, said he preferred to stay at Smithers country estate in Kent before sailing home on 10 April on the Titanic. The recipient is unknown, partly because the letter is so hard to decipher, it is possibly Lockett Gavin Coleman, asst. superintendant of the Grand Trunk Railroad but the informality of the letter suggests it was to a close friend or relative. [See Titanica page for images and transcriptions of letters]\n\nWhile in England he recieved news that the third of his four daughters, Louise, was having a difficult pregnancy and might have to be delivered by Ceasearean section. ANother reason for his return was the imminent opening of the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier Hotel on April 26. Travelling with him would be Paul Romaine Chevr\u00e9, the sculptor who had done the bust of Laurier that still stands in the lobby.\n\nIn his business dealings Hays had had discussions with the White Star Line about speeding travellers from Europe to the Orient using White Star ships and his transcontinental railroad. As a result, J. Bruce Ismay invited Hays and his entourage as guests aboard Titanic. They paid \u00a393 10s to cover incidental expenses, travelled on ticket number 12749, and occupied four cabins: B-69-71-73 and B-24. (Mr and Mrs Hays in B-69, Thornton and Orian Davidson in B-71, their maid Miss Perreault in B-73 and Hays secretary, Vivian Payne, in B-24).\n\nOne hour before the disaster, Hays relaxed with Colonel Archibald Gracie and Captain Edward Crosby in the Gentlemen's Smoking Lounge and they talked about the technological advances in transportation. At one point, Hays conceded that while Titanic was a superlative vessel, he expressed concern that \"the trend to playing fast and loose with larger and larger ships will end in tragedy.\" Twenty minutes later, Titanic struck the iceburg. Hays never believed the ship would sink quickly. As he put his wife and daughter into a lifeboat he assured them Titanic would stay \"afloat for at least 10 hours.\"\n\nHays drowned in the disaster, but the Minia recovered his body on 26 April. \"It was no trouble to identify him as he had a lot of papers on him and a watch with his name on it,\" sailor Francis Dyke wrote to his mother. His coffin was brought back to Montreal for burial aboard his private railway car, Canada. The car is still preserved and on display at the Canadian Railway Museum near Delson, Quebec.\n\nSimultaneous funerals for Hays were held on 8 May at the American Presbyterian Church in Montreal...\n\n...and at the Church of St. Edmund King and Martyr in London. At 11:30 a.m. on the day of the funeral, as the Montreal Herald Reported:\n\n\"From Montreal to Chicago, from New Brunswick to the Pacific coast, in all the thousands of miles of sidings and branch lines owned and operated by the Grand Trunk Railway, in every Grand Trunk Depot, at every Grand Trunk crossing, action ceased for the space of five full minutes as the Grand Trunk Railway system paid its respects to the memory of its great departed chief. For five minutes activities were suspended and the thousands of individuals who serve the great system in various capacities bowed their heads in silent tribute. Then once more work resumed, the wheels turned, and in 30 seconds things had been as they had before.\"\n\nHays is buried in the Pine Hill Section, (Lot 246) of Montreals' Mount Royal Cemetery. A massive monument is inscribed:\n\n\"And so he died and the example of his simple, devoted consecrated life is our priceless heritage. We are a different people, we are a better people, because this man worked and loved and died.\"\n\n\n\nThe town of Melville in Saskatchewan and Hays in Alberta, Canada are named for him, and a statue in his memory was erected in Prince Rupert, B.C. which would have been the Pacific terminus city of the transcontinental railroad he had planned to build.\n\nIn 1919 the Grand Trunk Railroad was placed in recievership, and later was absorbed into Canadian National Railways.\n\nNotes\n\nIn 1907 Hays was given Japan's highest decoration, the Order of the Rising Sun by Prince Fushimi, and in 1910 was offered a knighthood but turned it down because to become Sir Charles would have meant giving up his U.S. citizenship. His Japanese decoration can be seen today at the Lyman House Memorial Museum in Hilo, Hawaii.\n\nTravelling Companions (on same ticket)\n\nReferences and Sources\n\nNewark Evening News, 16 April 1912, Word Received Here of C.

Hasta hace muy poco no ten\u00edamos ni siquiera una fotograf\u00eda de \u00e9l, pero en marzo de 2.013 finalmente se public\u00f3 la \u00fanica de la que existe constancia. La imagen muestra a un Vivian beb\u00e9, con apenas 9 meses.\n\nVivian Payne con apenas 9 meses. La imagen est\u00e1 deteriorada, pero el paso del tiempo no ha podido ocultar sus ojos llenos de vida y la atm\u00f3sfera de futuro que cualquier ni\u00f1o de su edad desprende. Lamentablemente, para Vivian ser\u00eda un futuro demasiado corto\n\nQueremos que esta entrada sirva como homenaje a todos los j\u00f3venes llenos de sue\u00f1os que se hundieron con el Titanic y de los que apenas conocemos los nombres.\n\n__________\n\nVivian Ponsonby Payne naci\u00f3 en 1.889. Su padre, un contable de la Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, muri\u00f3 en 1.903 cuando Vivian s\u00f3lo ten\u00eda 13 a\u00f1os. El presidente de la compa\u00f1\u00eda donde trabajaba, Charles Melville Hays, se convirti\u00f3 casi en un padre para el chico tras el fallecimiento del suyo. Para Hays fue todo un placer ya que s\u00f3lo ten\u00eda hijas.\n\nCharles Hays, el que fuera como un padre para Vivian tras la muerte del suyo\n\nAsisti\u00f3 a la Escuela Superior de Montreal, donde fue calificado como \u201cun estudiante brillante, su reputaci\u00f3n no fue dada s\u00f3lo por su gran capacidad, sino por su duro trabajo\u201d.\n\nDespu\u00e9s de su graduaci\u00f3n fue contratado por Hays como secretario personal y trabaj\u00f3 para la Grand Trunk haciendo recados entre las oficinas de Montreal y Ottawa. El Montreal Herald, un peri\u00f3dico canadiense, dijo sobre \u00e9l lo siguiente:\n\n\u201cMr. Payne ten\u00eda el don de hacer amigos sin ning\u00fan esfuerzo y atra\u00eda a todo aquel con quien entrara en contacto.\u201d\n\nA principios de 1.912 Vivian acompa\u00f1\u00f3 al matrimonio Hays y su familia a un viaje por Europa. El joven pisar\u00eda por primera vez Inglaterra y qued\u00f3 asombrado con los hermosos paisajes. Escribi\u00f3 entusiasmado a su madre una carta donde describ\u00eda con gran ilusi\u00f3n, lo incre\u00edble que le parec\u00eda que todo fuese verde en pleno marzo.\n\nPor lo poco que podemos extraer de su carta y lo que los que le conocieron dec\u00edan de \u00e9l, se puede deducir que Vivian viv\u00eda con ilusi\u00f3n cada momento, que era un gran trabajador y sobretodo, podemos destacar su alegr\u00eda.\n\nHays y su s\u00e9quito embarcaron al Titanic el mi\u00e9rcoles 10 de abril de 1.912 en el puerto de Southampton, Inglaterra. Lo hicieron como invitados del mism\u00edsimo Bruce Ismay, el presidente de la White Star Line, la compa\u00f1\u00eda naviera propietaria del buque.\n\nLa familia regresaba precipitadamente debido a las complicaciones del embarazo de una de las hijas de los Hays, Louise, que se presentaba con amenaza de ces\u00e1rea. De no haber sido as\u00ed, seguramente el viaje se hubiese alargado algunos d\u00edas m\u00e1s.\n\nLa partida ocup\u00f3 cuatro camarotes de primera clase, Charles y Clara Hays el B-69, la hija y el yerno de \u00e9stos, Orian y Thornton Davidson el B-71, la doncella de Clara, Mary Anne Perreault, el B-73 y el joven Vivian el B-24.\n\nEl camarote que utiliz\u00f3 Vivian Payne. Estaba situado en la cubierta B por el lado de babor por proa\n\nLa noche del 14 de abril de 1.912, a las 23,40 horas, el Titanic choca con un iceberg que le hiere de forma mortal. Probablemente la familia Hays, su doncella y el joven Payne subiesen presurosos a la cubierta de botes.\n\nClara, Orian y Anne embarcaron en uno de los primeros salvavidas, el 3, que dej\u00f3 el Titanic a alrededor de las 00,50-00,55 horas. Ninguno de los tres hombres tuvo la oportunidad de subir con ellas y seguramente se quedasen despidi\u00e9ndolas desde la cubierta mientras el bote era bajado.\n\nLa noche era cada vez m\u00e1s fr\u00eda y los tres intentar\u00edan por todos los medios salvar la vida, pero eran varones y su condici\u00f3n no ayudaba. El 80,5% de los hombres que hab\u00eda en el buque, perecer\u00edan.\n\nSeguramente se mantuviesen los tres juntos hasta el final. Se lanzar\u00edan al mar intentando la \u00faltima oportunidad, sin embargo no les servir\u00eda de nada. El joven Vivian falleci\u00f3 esa noche junto con su mentor y casi padre Charles Hays y el yerno de \u00e9ste, Thornton Davidson. Podemos imaginarnos la impotencia de Hays al no poder hacer nada por el que sent\u00eda era su propio hijo.\n\nEl 26 de abril el Minia encontr\u00f3 el cad\u00e1ver de Charles Hays, pero nunca pudieron hacerlo con los de Thonrton y el joven Vivian.\n\nMientras tanto en Canad\u00e1 la madre de Vivian esperaba impaciente noticias de su hijo. Tan pronto como se enter\u00f3 de la gravedad de la situaci\u00f3n, se dirigi\u00f3 a las oficinas de la compa\u00f1\u00eda naviera, la White Star Line en Montreal y suplic\u00f3 que le diesen noticias de su hijo. Desesperada implor\u00f3 que fuese uno de los supervivientes. El peri\u00f3dico canadiense Toronto Globe recogi\u00f3 sus palabras.\n\n\u201c\u00bfNo pueden encontrar nada acerca de mi hijo? \u00c9l es mi beb\u00e9 y s\u00f3lo tiene 22 a\u00f1os. \u00bfNo cree que el se\u00f1or Hays pueda haberlo salvado?\u201d\n\nDesgraciadamente para ella sus deseos nunca se har\u00edan realidad, jam\u00e1s volver\u00eda a ver a su hijo. Lo \u00fanico que le quedar\u00eda de \u00e9l, ser\u00eda el recuerdo de esos ojos vivaces que tanto se iluminaban.\n\nUna placa de lat\u00f3n fue erigida en su memoria en la Iglesia Cristiana Anglicana de Montreal, Canad\u00e1. Fue pagada por 123 de sus asociados."}]}
