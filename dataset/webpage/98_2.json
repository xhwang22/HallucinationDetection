{"Danny Smith has also served as the special teams coordinator for the Jacksonville Jaguars, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Chicago Bears.": [{"url": "https://www.steelers.com/team/coaches-roster/danny-smith", "page_content": "Danny Smith is in his 11th season with the Steelers as the special teams coordinator. Smith was hired on January 31, 2013.\n\nSince joining the Steelers in 2015, kicker Chris Boswell is 202-of-234 overall on field goal attempts (86.3%), including 90-of-115 (78.3%) from 40 yards or longer. He ranks fifth in field goal percentage (86.3%) among all NFL kickers with at least 200 field goal attempts in league history. Boswell's 86.3 field goal percent ranks second in Steelers history among kickers with at least 30 field goal attempts, behind only Shaun Suisham (2010-14: 124-141 for 87.9%). He has registered a franchise-record 10 career game-winning field goals (last five min. of the fourth quarter or overtime for a lead change).\n\nIn 2022, Boswell made 20 field goals for the sixth time in his career, despite missing five games with an injury. His 59-yard field goal against the NY Jets in Week 4 tied the longest make of his career. In Week 17 at Baltimore, Boswell became the second player in team history withat least 200 career field goals made.\n\nIn 2021, Boswell broke his own franchise record for most field goals made in a season in Steelers history (36). He also converted 8-of-9 attempts from 50+ yards, doubling his previous record of four makes from 50+ yards in a single season (2017).\n\nSmith also oversaw the development of rookie punter Pressley Harvin in 2021. Harvin finished 10th in the League, landing 25 punts inside the 20-yard line as a rookie.\n\nUnder the guidance of Smith, Boswell made 19 field goals on 20 attempts (95.0%) in 2020, the best field goal percentage of his career in a single season. From 2019-2020, Boswell connected on 25-straight field goal attempts, which was the longest streak in the NFL when it ended in Week 11 of 2020 at Jacksonville.\n\nBoswell made 29 of his 31 field goal attempts (93.5%) in 2019, including 29 of 30 from inside 54 yards and 10 of 12 from 40+ yards. He ranked tied for third in the NFL in field goals made, tied for fourth in field goals attempted and fourth in points (115). Among NFL kickers with at least 30 field goal attempts, Boswell ranked second in field goal percentage.\n\nBoswell was the only kicker in 2019 that did not miss an extra-point attempt (28 of 28) and connected on at least 90% of his field goal attempts. He was the first NFL kicker to accomplish the feat since 2017 and fifth to do so since 2015, when the extra-point attempt was moved to the 15-yard line.\n\nWide receiver and punt returner Diontae Johnson excelled under Smith's tutelage in 2019. The rookie led the NFL in punt-return average (12.4). Johnson was the fifth player in franchise history to lead the League and first since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger. He returned a punt 85 yards for a TD at Arizona in Week 14, which was the longest punt return for a TD in franchise history. It was the first punt-return TD for the Steelers since December 6, 2015 (Antonio Brown vs. Indianapolis). Johnson was the first Pittsburgh rookie with a punt return for a TD since December 17, 2006 (Santonio Holmes vs. Carolina).\n\nBoswell landed 13 successful field goals in 2018, following a 2017 season where he earned his first Pro Bowl selection after a record-setting campaign. Boswell established single-season franchise records for the most field goals made (35) and total points (142) during the 2017 season, in addition to setting a team record for the most field goals made from 50 yards or further in a season with four. His 35 field goals made and 142 points surpassed the previous milestones of Norm Johnson set in 1995 (34 and 141). Boswell converted four game-winning field goal attempts \u2014 kicks within one minute of regulation \u2014 during the 2017 regular season.\n\nIn 2016, Boswell tied the franchise's regular-season record for the most field goals made in a single game with 6 (12/18 at Cincinnati). Also in that contest, he set the franchise record for most field goals made from 40 yards or longer in a single game (5). Since 1960, his 5 made field goals from 40 yards or longer are tied for the most in a single game in NFL history (Mason Crosby, 11/22/15).\n\nBoswell also set the NFL and Steelers record for most field goals made in a single postseason game (6) at Kansas City in the AFC Divisional Playoff. At the end of the 2016 postseason, Boswell was a perfect 15-of-15 in his playoff career. He became the first player in NFL postseason history to covert each of his first 15 field goal attempts.\n\nThough Boswell had never kicked in an NFL game prior to his 2015 Steelers debut, he made 29 field goals and 26 PATs for a total of 113 points in just 12 games. He set rookie/first-year single-season team records in field goals made (29), points (113) and field goal percentage (90.6). Boswell's 29 made field goals tied for fifth on the team's single-season field goals made chart.\n\nPrior to the 2015 regular season, the Steelers lost kicker Shaun Suisham for the season in the team's first preseason contest due to a knee injury. Pittsburgh then went through two other kickers (Garrett Hartley and Josh Scobee) before signing Boswell prior to the team's Week 5 game.\n\nThrough his first five years in the NFL and with the Steelers, punter Jordan Berry owns the team's single-season regular season record for highest net punting average (40.9, 2019). He ranks third in franchise history with a 44.2 punting average (min. 100 punts) and second in team annals with 131 punts inside the opponent 20-yard line.\n\nBerry, who recorded a franchise record 40.9 net punting average, averaged a career-best 45.5 yards per punt in 2019.\n\nIn 2018, Berry tallied a 38.8 net punting average coming off a 2017 season in which he posted the second-best mark in team history with a 39.8 average.\n\nIn 2016, Berry set the team's single regular-season record for highest net punting average (40.2) and became the seventh Steeler in team history to land 50 punts inside the opponent's 20-yard line in their career.\n\nDuring the 2015 season, Berry established a Steelers' single-season record (since 1976) for the highest percentage of punts downed inside the 20-yard line (47.5). That percentage also placed him third in the NFL.\n\nIn 2014, Smith got solid efforts from Suisham and punter Brad Wing. Suisham made 29-of-32 field goal attempts and all 45 of his PATs for a total of 132 points, good for fourth in the AFC. Wing averaged 43.7 yards per punt in his debut NFL season in 2014. His gross punting average was the fifth-highest total in team history for a rookie or first-year player in a single season.\n\nIn the Steelers' Week 17 showdown with the Cincinnati Bengals, the AFC North Championship was on the line. Smith's punt return units cleared the way for Antonio Brown to return a punt 71 yards for a TD. It marked the second straight season Brown returned a punt for a TD against Cincinnati.\n\nIn Smith's first season as the Steelers' special teams coordinator in 2013, Suisham had a career year, connecting on 30-of-32 field goals, which are a career high and are tied for the third-most field goals made in a single season in Steelers history. His 93.8 field goal percentage (minimum 15 attempts) also set a new single-season team record.\n\nIn addition to being selected to the Pro Bowl as a wide receiver in 2013, Brown was also selected as a return specialist. He recorded a 67-yard punt return for a TD in Week 15 versus Cincinnati, which was one of his five returns of 40 or more yards on the season.\n\nPrior to joining Pittsburgh, Smith served as the Washington Football Team's special teams coordinator from 2004-2012. He helped establish Washington's special teams as one of the top coverage and return units in the NFL.\n\nPrior to joining the Washington Football Team, Smith was the special teams coordinator for the Buffalo Bills (2001-03), coached tight ends for the Detroit Lions (1999-2000), and he split duties as the defensive backs and special teams coach for the Philadelphia Eagles (1995-98).\n\nSmith spent eight years (1987-94) as an assistant coach for Georgia Tech, where he coached running backs, wide receivers and defensive backs. He was on the staff for the Yellow Jackets' 1990 team that was named co-NCAA National Champions.\n\nSmith played defensive back for Edinboro State College from 1972-1976, and he was elected to the Edinboro University Athletics Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nHis first collegiate coaching position came as a graduate assistant at his alma mater in 1976. Smith also was a defensive graduate assistant coach at Clemson University (1979), The College of William & Mary (1980-83) and The Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina (1984-86)."}, {"url": "https://www.jaguars.com/team/coaches-roster/", "page_content": "The Jacksonville Jaguars hired two-time Super Bowl champion and former NFL QB Doug Pederson as head coach on Feb. 3, 2022.\n\n\u201cDoug Pederson four years ago won a Super Bowl as head coach of a franchise in pursuit of its first world championship,\u201d Owner Shad Khan said. \u201cI hope Doug can replicate that magic here in Jacksonville, but what is certain is his proven leadership and experience as a winning head coach in the National Football League.
