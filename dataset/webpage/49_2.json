Albert II has maintained the status quo, upholding the low-tax regime that has made Monaco a haven for the super-rich.\n\nEarly Life\n\nAlbert Alexandre Louis Pierre Grimaldi was born in Monaco on 14 March 1958, the second child and only son of Prince Rainier III and Grace Kelly, an American cinema actress. He attended the Lyc\u00e9e Albert Ier, then the principality\u2019s sole secondary school, where he developed a passion for sport. Having received his baccalaureate diploma in 1976, Albert enrolled the following year at Amherst College in Massachusetts, USA, and graduated with a degree in political science in 1981. From Sept. 1981\u2013April 1982 he served in the French Navy as a sub-lieutenant on the aircraft carrier Jeanne d\u2019Arc. On 14 Sept. 1982 his mother was killed in a car crash in the mountains near Monaco. Subsequently, he became vice-president of the Princess Grace-USA Foundation, which grants scholarships to talented young musicians, actors and dancers. In the same year he also became president of the Monaco Red Cross.\n\nDuring the mid-1980s Albert undertook work experience at an investment bank and an international law firm in New York, as well as the French luxury goods group Mo\u00ebt Hennessy in Paris. Back in Monaco he chaired the principality\u2019s prestigious Yacht Club, the International Television Festival and Monaco\u2019s Athletic Federation. Albert also became increasingly involved in the Olympic movement, both as an administrator (as a member of the International Olympic Committee in 1985 and president of Monaco\u2019s Olympic Committee in 1993) and competitor (in the principality\u2019s bobsleigh team at four Winter Olympics between 1988 and 2002).\n\nDuring the 1990s he began to increase his involvement in the day-to-day administration of Monaco. In 1997 he organized the 700th anniversary celebrations of the Grimaldi family\u2019s control over the principality. He also assisted his father and the government in preparing reports that strongly denied allegations by French parliamentarians in 2000 that Monaco\u2019s lax policies had facilitated money laundering.\n\nLong described in the press as the world\u2019s \u2018most eligible bachelor\u2019, Albert\u2019s unmarried status became a matter of political concern, casting doubt on the succession of the Grimaldi family and the independence of the principality. A change to the constitution was formulated in April 2002, however, allowing the throne to continue through the female line. On 31 March 2005 the Palace of Monaco announced that Albert would take over the duties of his father as Regent, after Prince Rainier III, who had been admitted to hospital, was no longer able to rule. Following the death of his father on 6 April 2005, he became Sovereign Prince of Monaco, and was enthroned on 12 July.\n\nCareer in Office\n\nIn his first public statement as Prince Albert II, he said that the death of his father, who had governed for 56 years, had left the people of the principality feeling orphaned and united in a profound sense of loss. He has retained the territory\u2019s famously low-tax regime and continued to develop tourism, as well as nurturing Monaco\u2019s precision engineering, fish canning, banking and pharmaceutical industries. In July 2011 he married Charlene Wittstock, a former Olympic swimmer for South Africa."}, {"url": "https://history.as.uky.edu/reign-louis-xiv-1643-1715-overview", "page_content": "Born in 1638, Louis XIV succeeded his father, Louis XIII, as king at the age of five. He ruled for 72 years, until his death in 1715, making his reign the longest of any European monarch. By the time he died, he outlived his son and his grandson, leaving the throne to his young great-grandson Louis XV. Louis XIV\u2019s reign was important in French history not just because it lasted so long but because he was a strong-willed ruler who was determined to make his subjects obey him and to make his kingdom the predominant power in Europe. He came closer than any other French king to making the political theory of absolutism a reality.\n\nLouis XIV\u2019s childhood was marked by the upheaval of the Fronde (1648-1653), which left him with a lasting horror of disorder. The Fronde had shown that the royal judges of the Parlement , the great nobles, the provincial political elites, and the common people could all pose threats to royal authority. Louis XIV would attempt to insure that none of these groups would be able to oppose the central government as they had during the Fronde.\n\nDuring the early years of his reign, Louis XIV remained dependent on Mazarin, the minister who had loyally served his mother during the Fronde. Mazarin transmitted to Louis XIV the practices that Henri IV, Sully, and Richelieu had developed in the early decades of the seventeenth century. The treaty of the Pyrenees (1659) ended the long war between France and Spain, which had continued even after the settlement of the Thirty Years\u2019 War in 1648, on terms favorable to France. France had clearly replaced Spain as Europe\u2019s most powerful kingdom.\n\nAs an adolescent, Louis XIV threw himself into the social whirl of the court and the pursuit of young women; he did not seem particularly serious about his political responsibilities. When Mazarin died in 1661, everyone expected him to find a new principal minister to take on the burden of actually running the government. To the court\u2019s surprise, Louis announced that he intended to be his own principal minister. There would be no equivalent to Sully, Richelieu, or Mazarin for the rest of his reign. Soon after Mazarin\u2019s death, Louis had the ambitious finance minister Fouquet, who had hoped to dominate the government, arrested, and his lavish estate confiscated. Impressed by the architect and garden designer who had created Fouquet\u2019s palace at Vaux-le-Vicomte, Louis later hired them to create his own palace at Versailles.\n\nAlthough Louis XIV tried to oversee all aspects of the government, he did rely on ministers for assistance in carrying out his policies. The fate of Fouquet had shown these men, however, that they could not aspire to personal dominance in the style of Richelieu and Mazarin. Louis was careful to divide his favor among competing ministers and encourage rivalries among them, so that he would always be in a position to make the decisions that mattered.\n\nThe most important minister in the first half of Louis XIV\u2019s reign was Colbert, a former assistant of Mazarin\u2019s. Colbert is remembered above all for his efforts to regulate the French economy. He believed that an organized effort was needed to allow France to surpass its rivals, particularly the Netherlands and England. French merchants and manufacturers were strictly regulated to avoid what Colbert regarded as wasteful competition and to make sure that their goods were of high quality. Colbert tried to encourage the development of domestic manufactures to replace goods that France had had to import from abroad, especially expensive luxury products. His mercantilist policies discouraged imports through high tariffs and tried to build up export industries whose sales abroad would increase the amount of money flowing into the kingdom.\n\nBuilding up France\u2019s economy was just one part of Louis XIV\u2019s program for increasing the country\u2019s power. In his view, the most important duty of a ruler was to seek gloire (glory) for himself and his country through military successes. The war minister, Louvois, was put in charge of organizing an army that soon grew to be Europe\u2019s largest. In 1665, Louis XIV launched an attack on the Spanish provinces in the Netherlands, along France\u2019s northern borders. This War of Devolution (1666-68) added the important city of Lille to French territory. In 1672, France attacked the Netherlands, an important commercial rival. The French expected an easy victory over their much smaller opponent, but the Dutch succeeded in finding allies and put up a stiff resistance. Although Louis XIV\u2019s propagandists proclaimed the war a triumph, in fact it ended in 1678 with only minor gains for France.\n\nAt home, Louis XIV continued his efforts to strengthen royal power. He systematized Richelieu\u2019s method of controlling the provinces through appointed officials by creating a system of permanent intendants, one for each of the country\u2019s provinces. The intendants, who could be moved or dismissed by the king, oversaw the enforcement of laws and the collection of taxes, and reported regularly to the king about events in their province. French subjects became accustomed to the permanent presence of royal authority throughout the country. In 1673, Louis curtailed the powers of the parlements, the royal courts. They were forbidden to protest against the provisions of new laws until after they had registered them. This greatly reduced the courts\u2019 ability to obstruct royal policy and influence the population.\n\nAlthough he was determined to be obeyed, Louis XIV understood that he needed cooperation from his subjects to carry out his policies. He offered the country\u2019s noble elites a virtual monopoly on government offices and favors in exchange for their support. In France\u2019s towns, elected city councils were replaced with officials named by the king, who could be counted on to give him their loyalty. To raise money, he created and sold an ever-increasing number of venal offices. Louis XIV distrusted the lower classes, viewing them as a potential source of disorder. He created large hopitaux (hospices) where beggars, orphans, criminals and the insane were forcibly locked up under tight supervision.\n\nLike his predecessors Henri IV and Louis XIII, Louis XIV wanted to see France achieve religious unity. Although he was a devout Catholic, he resented the Pope\u2019s efforts to control the French Church. In 1682, he imposed the Gallican articles on the French hierarchy, giving the king almost total control over the naming of bishops and the internal affairs of the church. Urged on by militant Catholics who convinced him that the Protestant minority was too weak to resist, Louis decided in 1685 that the time had come to revoke the edict of Nantes. Protestant worship in France was forbidden, and drastic measures, such as quartering troops in Protestant homes, were used to pressure them to convert. About one-third of France\u2019s Protestants fled abroad to escape this persecution; others formed an underground movement, holding religious services in forests and remote mountain areas. The Protestant exiles waged a propaganda campaign against Louis XIV from their refuges in the Netherlands and elsewhere, significantly damaging the king\u2019s reputation abroad.\n\nThroughout the early 1680s, Louis XIV continued his aggressive drive to expand France\u2019s borders, particularly along the Rhine river. The annexation of the historically German city of Strasbourg in 1681 gave him control of the strategic province of Alsace. France\u2019s push toward the Rhine brought Louis XIV into conflict with the Austrian Habsburg dynasty, but Emperor Leopold I was distracted by a war against the Ottoman Empire, whose armies threatened his capital of Vienna in 1683. Although the Austrians were fellow Christians, Louis XIV encouraged the Turks, further poisoning relations with the Habsburgs.\n\nOnce the Austrians had defeated the Turks, they joined an alliance with France\u2019s other enemies. Leadership of this coalition came from the Dutch leader William of Orange, who became king of England in 1688 as William III, replacing James II who Louis XIV had supported. In 1688, France found itself involved in a new round of warfare against an alliance that included all the other major European powers: England, the Netherlands, Austria, and Prussia. Huguenot exiles driven out of France after 1685 waged an effective propaganda campaign against Louis XIV. The war of the League of Augsburg lasted until 1697. The death of the capable war minister Louvois in 1691 deprived Louis of a valuable advisor. Although the French won some major battles, Louis XIV was unable to break up the enemy coalition, and the final peace settlement was a barely disguised defeat for him.\n\nThe war of the League of Augsburg left France financially exhausted, and the aging king was not eager to start another conflict. When Charles II, the king of Spain, died without an heir in 1700 and left his throne to a French Bourbon prince, however, Louis found himself in a dilemma. France\u2019s enemies refused to accept an arrangement that they feared would some day lead to a union of France and Spain. Louis was unwilling to renounce such a significant gain in France\u2019s diplomatic and military position. Negotiations with William III and Leopold I broke down, and in 1701 France again found itself at war with the British, Dutch, and Austrians.\n\nThe war of the Spanish Succession (1701-1713) was the largest and costliest European war up to that time. At its height, the French army grew to more than 400,000 men, three times as large as it had been during the Thirty Years\u2019 War. The cost of maintaining this huge war effort was crippling. Taxes increased to record levels. The king\u2019s effort to increase the capitation, a tax paid by all subjects regardless of their social status, put a strain on the alliance with the nobility that had been the basis of Louis\u2019s system. Protestants in the remote southern region of the C\u00e9vennes revolted in 1703, starting a guerilla war that became an additional drain on resources. The French army also suffered several major defeats, most notably at the battle of Blenheim in 1704, when the British forces commanded by the Duke of Marlborough won a devastating victory.\n\nThe disasters of the war generated increasing criticism of Louis XIV and his heavy-handed absolutist system. Merchants and manufacturers complained about the rules and regulations that hindered their activities. At the court, many high nobles resented their exclusion from any real political role and talked about the necessity of reducing the excessive powers Louis XIV had gathered into his hands. One unhappy noble, the duc de Saint-Simon, documented their complaints in his extensive diaries. His acid portrait of the aging king and his faction-ridden court was published after his and the king\u2019s death, and has become both a literary classic and the source of much of our knowledge about French politics and opinion under Louis XIV.\n\nDevout Catholics objected to a church that had become an instrument of political control; some of them joined a dissident Catholic movement, Jansenism, that called for a purer, stricter form of piety. Fearing that the Jansenists would weaken his authority over the church, Louis XIV pressured the Pope to issue a condemnation of their theological doctrines. The Pope\u2019s bull, Unigenitus, issued in 1713, only strengthened the Jansenists\u2019 determination to resist both Papal and royal authority. The Jansenist controversy would become one of the major divisions in France during the eighteenth century.\n\nFrench fortunes reached their low point in 1709, following more military defeats. The winter of 1709-1710 was one of the coldest in French history, destroying crops and reducing much of the population to utter misery. Louis XIV was by now ready to make peace, but his enemies kept raising their demands as they saw France\u2019s difficulties mounting. Unwilling to accept demands that he regarded as humiliating for himself and dangerous for the country, Louis was driven to take the extraordinary step of appealing directly to his subjects for their support. \u201cI come to ask for your councils and your aid in this encounter that involves your safety,\u201d he told them.\n\nDivisions among France\u2019s enemies and better fortunes on the battlefield finally made it possible to bring the war to an end in 1713. The Bourbon Philip V remained king of Spain, but renounced any claim to the French throne, and France avoided having to cede territory gained earlier in Louis\u2019s reign. The war left France on the verge of bankruptcy, however, and the aged king was deeply unpopular. In the meantime, the death of his son and grandson during the last years of the war had left a young great-grandson as heir, raising the prospect of another troubled regency. Louis XIV\u2019s attempt to ensure the survival of the dynasty by making his illegitimate sons eligible for the throne further alienated key court figures. At his death in 1715, Louis XIV left behind a deeply troubled kingdom. His critics hoped that France would now move in the direction of a less centralized government with a less aggressive foreign policy."}, {"url": "https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/money-and-power/a37821372/prince-albert-princess-charlene-monaco-scandals/", "page_content": "Before his marriage in 2011 to the South African swimmer Charlene Wittstock, Albert, the playboy prince of Monaco, upheld the traditions of a dysfunctional family that has been defined by scandal and intrigue for seven centuries. His marriage seemed a turning point, an opportunity to right the ship not just of his own life but of his homeland. But now, 15 years after he ascended the throne and several scandals later, there is a new one, perhaps the most outrageous of all\u2014a story that involves an anonymous Brazilian, dueling lawyers in Milan and Paris, a Vladimir Putin cameo, and the worst sinus infection in the history of mankind.\n\nWhen Albert II succeeded his father as the Sovereign Prince of Monaco in 2005, he made a bold pledge. For decades the tiny principality\u2014a gaudy jewel on the French republic\u2019s south coast\u2014had become synonymous with grift, gambling, and questionable banking practices. Somerset Maugham, the British writer and resident of nearby Nice, once described the French Riviera, which includes the 700-year-old casino state, as a \u201csunny place for shady people.\u201d\n\nPrince Albert and Princess Charlene with their twins Jacques and Gabriella in 2020.

His government in the glitzy tax haven, which is smaller than Central Park and has a population under 40,000, would be guided by \u201cmorality, honesty, and ethics.\u201d\n\nMore From Town & Country play icon The triangle icon that indicates to play\n\nBut the billionaire bachelor had perhaps not applied the same propriety to his personal life. No sooner had he ascended to the throne than decades of his own fast living came back to bite him in the royal derriere. Fifteen years later it\u2019s still biting. And the latest scandal, which involves yet another paternity claim, hangs darkly over Albert\u2019s principality.\n\nAlmost four decades after her death in a car crash, Grace Kelly still lends Monaco a degree of status in the popular imagination that dwarfs its geopolitical importance. Albert knows this, and he has long sought to keep the stardust falling; he oversaw the design of a $50,000-a-night Princess Grace Suite at Monaco\u2019s storied H\u00f4tel de Paris Monte-Carlo, which reopened after refurbishment in 2019. Yet for all his efforts, Albert, whose wife initially brought a more modern brand of glamour to his rule, seems unable to get out of his own way. And the latest allegations are yet another threat to his moral, modernizing mission.\n\nThe wedding of Prince Rainier and Grace Kelly in April 1956. Albert was born two years later. Gilbert TOURTE\n\nIn 2005, weeks after Prince Albert completed his accession at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, a cover story in Paris Match stunned France. Across 10 pages, the gossipy French magazine (and bible of Mon\u00e9gasque intrigue) revealed that the bachelor prince had a secret love child. Alexandre was born in late 2002, the product of a relationship that began in 1997 with Nicole Coste (n\u00e9e Tossoukp\u00e9), a flight attendant from Togo in West Africa. The prince had asked for her phone number during an Air France flight from Nice to Paris.\n\nIn 2005 Albert accepted the boy, now 18, as part of his family\u2014and fortune. But not the line of succession, which Rainier had cannily changed by constitutional amendment in 2002 to include siblings as heirs if they had children. (Albert has two sisters, one of whom, St\u00e9phanie, has had relationships, marriages, and three children with, variously, two bodyguards, an elephant trainer, and a Portuguese circus acrobat.) Monaco\u2019s constitution excludes children born out of wedlock.\n\nIn 2006 a DNA test confirmed the claims of a former waitress from California, Tamara Rotolo, who had for years insisted that her daughter Jazmin was the result of a brief encounter with Prince Albert in 1991, while she was on holiday in France. Rotolo\u2019s attempts to seek child support through the courts had come to naught. Her daughter, then 14, was having a normal day at her school near Palm Springs when Albert\u2019s lawyers announced that she had been formally recognized as a member of a billionaire royal family halfway around the world. Now 29, Jazmin Grace Grimaldi (who did not reply to emails for this story) is an actress and singer.\n\nAlbert\u2019s son Alexandre Grimaldi-Coste, with his mother Nicole Coste. Foc Kan\n\nIn the space of a year, a playboy prince and committed bachelor had risen to the throne and admitted to having two illegitimate children. Further paternity claims\u2014valid or not\u2014were perhaps inevitable. \u201cOne day Albert told me, \u2018Oh, if I listened to all the claims, I would have more children than anybody else in the world,\u2019 \u201d St\u00e9phane Bern tells me. Bern is a prominent French TV presenter who has been close to the prince since 1989. \u201cSometimes I make jokes about it. I say that I\u2019m too old to be his son, and he laughs.\u201d\n\nBut new claims are different\u2014and less amusing\u2014because Albert is 63 and no longer a bachelor. His 2011 wedding to Wittstock (now Princess Charlene of Monaco), who is 20 years his junior, reportedly cost $55 million. Giorgio Armani, Karl Lagerfeld, and Naomi Campbell were guests. The couple had twins, Jacques and Gabriella, in 2014, finally putting to rest any succession concerns.\n\nYet even in the run-up to the wedding, rumors swirled of another love child. The French weekly news magazine L\u2019Express published claims\u2014strongly denied by the couple and Albert\u2019s lawyers\u2014that Charlene, who cried during her wedding, had attempted to \u201cescape\u201d the principality, once after traveling to Paris for a bridal gown fitting. \u201cPeople see from outside that you are living a fairy tale, but life is always knocking at your door,\u201d Bern says.\n\nMariza S, as she is being called for the purpose of potential court proceedings, according to the Telegraph newspaper in the UK and the German magazine Bunte, is a Brazilian woman who is now in her mid-thirties and lives in Italy. She has thick black curly hair and claims that she caught Prince Albert\u2019s eye in a nightclub in Rio in 2004.\n\nAlbert with his daughter Jazmin Grace Grimaldi, who was recognized in 2006 after 14 years of legal battles. David M. Benett\n\nAccording to the Telegraph and Bunte, legal documents filed in Milan by a lawyer with a confusing name (Erich Grimaldi, who tells me Mariza found him on Facebook, is not related to the Grimaldis of Monaco) allege that Mariza, then 20, did not recognize the prince. She says he told her he was a Canadian lawyer and diplomat.\n\nWhat follows is a tale that Albert\u2019s lawyer dismisses as pure fiction. According to Mariza, as detailed in Bunte\u2019s reporting on her legal filings, she and Albert engaged in an extraordinary two-week globetrotting tryst, flying from Rio to Lisbon and then to Milan, where Mariza says she applied for a visa to travel to Moscow, via Monaco. In the Russian capital, Mariza says she recalls meeting President Putin alongside her \u201cdiplomat\u201d paramour, before she was eventually put on a plane back to Rio, via Amsterdam.\n\nNine months later Mariza allegedly had a daughter, known in the proceedings as Celia, as reported in the Telegraph and Bunte. It was at this point, apparently, that Mariza claims Albert stopped responding to messages. She says she continued to think he was a Canadian diplomat until she recognized him years later in an Italian gossip magazine.\n\nMariza began a fight for recognition and support. When direct messages to the palace\u2019s official Instagram account went unanswered, Celia, according to news reports, sent the prince a letter last September. \u201cQueride Papai\u201d (Dear Daddy), the letter begins, handwritten in Portuguese and reproduced by the German news company RTL. \u201cWhen I was five or six years old, I kept asking my mother where you are and why you are not with us\u2026but I never got an answer from her\u2026 I don\u2019t understand why I grew up without a father, and now that I\u2019ve found you, you don\u2019t want to see me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne day Albert told me, \u2018If I listened to all the claims, I would have more children than anybody else in the world.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhen I manage to reach Grimaldi, Mariza\u2019s lawyer, he\u2019s speeding across Milan on a Vespa. In broken English, and in translated text messages, he tells me that the case is delayed. A court hearing had been scheduled for February, when the prince was due to be summoned for an \u201cacknowledgment of paternity.\u201d But, speaking in March, Grimaldi says the prince\u2019s lawyers have pleaded sovereign immunity. At the time of writing, Grimaldi was hoping a judge would reject the plea, and he was waiting for the case to come back to court, which he said should happen imminently.\n\nGrimaldi says he is unable to share documents related to the case, but he claims evidence exists to back up Mariza\u2019s memories of a journey across Europe. The lawyer, who is more used to contract law and credit recovery, says Mariza simply wants a DNA test. He is not intimidated by his royal adversary. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, it makes no difference if my counterpart is a prince, a king, a president of state, a politician, or an entrepreneur,\u201d he says.\n\nThierry Lacoste, Prince Albert\u2019s longtime lawyer, has dismissed Mariza\u2019s story as a \u201csham\u201d and \u201cblackmail\u201d in the French magazine Le Point. In a statement from his Paris office, Lacoste tells me \u201cthe claims before the Italian courts are totally unfounded.\u201d Sovereign immunity, he added, was \u201cperfectly classic for a head of state as part of the defense package.\u201d\n\nYet Mariza\u2019s allegation is not the only thing now fueling Monaco\u2019s giant gossip mills. In December, Princess Charlene shocked royal observers at a charity event when, above a gold-sequined face mask, she revealed that the blond locks on one side of her head had been shaved off. Was it a sign of inner turmoil? Not so, she indicated in January in an interview with one of her husband\u2019s biographers, Isabelle Riv\u00e8re; she just liked the style.\n\nPrincess Charlene appeared at 2020 Christmas party with a new haircut. ERIC GAILLARD // Getty Images\n\nAnd yet, around the same time, Princess Charlene reportedly skipped an official meeting with French president Emmanuel Macron. Then in May she flew alone to South Africa for what was supposedly going to be a week, only to stay away from Monaco for months. Doctors, she said, had warned her against flying home lest a pressurized private jet aggravate a sinus infection related to a dental implant procedure. (Albert and her children made a visit to South Africa in August.)\n\nBy early September, Charlene had still not returned, and she was not expected to do so until October, at the earliest. As rumors \u00admushroomed, an exasperated Albert granted an interview with his biographer Peter Mikelbank. \u201cShe didn\u2019t go into exile. It was absolutely just a medical problem which had to be treated,\u201d Albert told Mikelbank in People magazine in September. While not referring to Mariza directly, Charlene insisted in January, before her South African isolation, that she was happy, and she expressed full support for her husband. \u201cWhen my husband has problems, he tells me about it,\u201d she told Riv\u00e8re. \u201cI often tell him, \u2018No matter what, I\u2019m a thousand percent behind you. I\u2019ll stand by you whatever you do, in good times or in bad.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe intense interest in the latest paternity case reflects an appetite for Mon\u00e9gasque intrigue that predates Albert\u2019s playboy past. Bad times have long been a feature of life in Monaco, more than 700 years after Fran\u00e7ois Grimaldi seized a fortress and established a family fiefdom. (While Monaco today is a member of the United Nations, it is a sovereign city-state that depends on the protection of France.)\n\nAlbert\u2019s father, Prince Rainier III, once had to fight off an attempted coup by his own older sister, Princess Antoinette, Baroness of Massy, who was herself married three times. She wanted to declare herself regent, securing the throne for herself and her son. Monaco remained a constitutional anomaly, existing partly to satisfy an interest in royalty as fantasy in a country that had beheaded its own king in 1793. \u201cMonaco is for French people a sort of substitution monarchy,\u201d Bern told me.\n\nRainier\u2019s marriage to Grace Kelly scuppered Antoinette\u2019s schemes. That he married into Hollywood royalty also propelled Monaco from a French pre\u00adoccupation into glittering global notoriety. \u201cGrace Kelly\u2019s mother thought her daughter was about to marry a prince from Morocco,\u201d Bern says. \u201cShe had never even heard of Monaco.\u201d\n\nThe wedding, in 1956, was a sensation, attracting 1,500 journalists. MGM broadcast it live to more than 30 million people. The 700 guests included Cary Grant, David Niven, and Aristotle Onassis. Rainier, who had become ruler in 1949, described it as \u201cthe biggest circus in history.\u201d\n\nPrincess Grace helped change Monaco\u2019s reputation, yet the couple\u2019s glamour and fame only intensified the pressure on their heirs. As the only son, arriving between two sisters, Albert had a destiny hung over him like a heavily jeweled sword of Damocles.\n\nPrincess Grace of Monaco holding Prince Albert, born on March 14, 1958. Keystone-France // Getty Images\n\nHaving a tough, critical father didn\u2019t help. \u201cPrince Rainier always told me, \u2018I\u2019m not sure my son is ready,\u2019 \u201d Bern recalls. \u201cAnd then when I spoke to Albert, he said, \u2018If I say I\u2019m ready, my father will be upset. If I say I\u2019m not ready, people will think I\u2019m a stupid boy. So I can\u2019t say anything.\u2019 He had to be silent and experience his own life with girls and sport.\u201d\n\nAlbert made the most of immense privilege and dashing good looks while he waited for the inevitable to happen. He was (and remains, Bern says) a likable man, and he was a popular figure at Amherst, where he studied from 1977 to 1981.\n\nBruce McInnes, then leader of Amherst\u2019s Glee Club, remembered a laid-back prince with a fine baritone voice. McInnes once entertained Prince Rainier and Princess Grace at his home after a concert at the Massachusetts college, and he conducted a performance at the cathedral in Monaco during a European tour. David Niven and Yul Brynner attended.\n\n\u201cWe became good friends,\u201d McInnes, who died in April at the age of 85, wrote in an email. \u201cThere were many times when he would get late night hunger pangs and would telephone me and walk the short distance to my house for a grilled cheese sandwich or\u2014forgive the language\u2014a \u2018shitburger\u2019, which consisted of a very messy, grossly oversize cheeseburger, grilled onions, and a fried egg. Several of his buddies would come along for these gustatory delights!\n\n\u201cI will always remember Albert as a real gentleman\u2014not at all arrogant, never flaunting his position in life\u2026 He certainly knew something of what lay ahead for him, but at Amherst he was\u2014as much as possible\u2014just one of the boys.\u201d\n\nBut speculation about Albert\u2019s love life\u2014and appetite for more than dirty burgers\u2014was exceptional even by the standards of the Grimaldis. He has been linked to such high-profile women as Naomi Campbell and Claudia Schiffer, while his perennial bachelorhood inevitably inspired gossipy speculation about his sexuality.\n\nBern suspects the pressure on Albert\u2014and any future wife\u2014might have driven him to seek relationships without commitments, free from impossible comparisons. \u201cI think when you are the product of such an incredible love story between a glamorous star and a prince, you find yourself in a difficult position to do it again,\u201d Bern says. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d he adds later, laughing, \u201che should have used more condoms.\u201d\n\nAlbert is reported to have once said of his tough love\u2013dispensing father: \u201cI\u2019ll get married when Rainier dies.\u201d When that happened, in 2005, Bern says that Albert, then 47, changed. \u201cI noticed he was like another man,\u201d he says. Albert\u2019s speech, which Bern says had a hint of George VI\u2019s stutter, suddenly rang with confidence.\n\nCleaning up Monaco\u2019s reputation was part of the prince\u2019s mission to put his own stamp on the state after his father\u2019s long rule. But doing so would not be without challenges, especially for someone whose reputation required its own rehab.\n\nRobert Eringer remembers the tension between Albert\u2019s professional and personal lives. The American private investigator says he got to know the prince in the 1990s and remembers him as a \u201cshy and awkward\u201d man.\n\nPrince Albert and Princess Charlene leave the palace in Monaco after their wedding on July 2, 2011. Richard Heathcote/PP // Getty Images\n\nIn 2005, when Albert took the throne, Eringer established an unofficial agency\u2014the Monaco Intelligence Service\u2014to help root out unsavory characters who did not fit the new image. Late that same year, Eringer says he met Tamara Rotolo and Jazmin in Monaco, months before Jazmin was officially recognized. \u201cI had hoped for Albert to meet his daughter for the first time in a private setting, our safe house,\u201d Eringer writes in an email to me from his home in Santa Barbara. \u201cIt would have meant a lot to her and mitigated the harshness of legal proceedings.\u201d But Albert and his lawyers passed up the opportunity, Eringer claims, waiting instead for Jazmin\u2019s legal recognition the following year.\n\nEringer says he lost royal favor in 2007 and later attempted to sue the prince for unpaid fees of $60,000. His case collapsed when a U.S. court ruled that sovereign immunity applied to the disputed contract. Eringer also wrote a blog that carried dozens of scandalous claims about the prince and his rule, including a striking photo of Albert leaping naked from a boat in his more carefree days.\n\nAlbert and his lawyers have dismissed Eringer\u2019s claims and sued the American for defamation, compelling him to take down his blog, according to Eringer. Albert once described his former consigliere as \u201ca bitter person who spews his venom and resentments on the internet.\u201d Thierry Lacoste, Albert\u2019s lawyer, tells me Eringer\u2019s \u201cslanderous attacks\u201d are \u201ca demonstration of his absence of probity.\u201d\n\nYet in the latest paternity scandal, Eringer emerges as an unlikely character witness for Albert, albeit a barbed one. His doubts about Mariza\u2019s story center on her claim that Albert had disguised his identity. \u201cThat was not how Albert operated,\u201d Eringer tells me. \u201cHe used his identity as a prince to attract women. By 2005 Albert was nearing 50, almost bald, fat, and rather ugly. It was his princely status that attracted women, certainly not his looks.\u201d\n\nBern is more diplomatic\u2014and guarded\u2014in doubting the latest claims. \u201cIf there are already illegitimate children, it\u2019s easy to say, \u2018I\u2019m also one,\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cBut I won\u2019t judge, because if tomorrow it\u2019s proven, I would look very stupid.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Albert has been anxious to present a wholesome image of his legitimate family, even as they remain physically separated. This summer, while nursing her sinuses in South Africa, Charlene released a series of heavily produced videos charting their relationship to mark the 10th anniversary of their marriage. \u201cHappy anniversary, Albert, thank you for the blessing of our beautiful children,\u201d the princess wrote under a trailer published on her official Instagram page. And yet, for all the public sentiment, the couple did not celebrate together\u2014doctor\u2019s orders.\n\nAlbert, meanwhile, is doing his own PR tour. In an interview earlier this year, he talked about his children, who turn seven in December. Crown Prince \u00adJacques is \u201cshy and a little quieter,\u201d while Princess Gabriella is \u201ca little more outgoing and definitely has the gift of gab.\u201d He has also talked about the pandemic, which has been an economic disaster for the principality, though his words could easily have been an appraisal of the ever diminishing odds, in the wake of his personal drama, of his accomplishing what he set out to do for Monaco when he ascended the throne nearly two decades ago. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t know what the future holds,\u201d he said, \u201cboth in the short and long term\u2026it\u2019s a bit worrying and very unsettling.\u201d\n\nThis story appears in the November 2021 issue of Town & Country.

Honor\u00e9 Camille L\u00e9onor Grimaldi was born on November 10, 1720, in Paris, France. He was the third of the nine children and the second but the eldest surviving of the six sons of Louise-Hippolyte, Sovereign Princess of Monaco for ten months before her death from smallpox, and Jacques I, briefly the Sovereign Prince of Monaco, born Jacques Fran\u00e7ois Leonor Goyon de Matignon. Honor\u00e9\u2019s maternal grandparents were Antonio I, Prince of Monaco and Marie of Lorraine. His paternal grandparents were the French nobles Jacques III Goyon de Matignon, Count of Thorigny, a Lieutenant General in the French army, (1644 \u2013 1725) and Charlotte de Goyon de Matignon, Countess of Thorigny (1657 \u2013 1721).\n\nHonor\u00e9 III had eight siblings but only three survived to adulthood:\n\nAntoine-Charles, Marquis des Baux and Count de Matignon, (1717 \u2013 1718), died in infancy\n\nCharlotte Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Nathalie (1719 \u2013 1790), a nun at the Convent of the Visitation in Paris, France\n\nCharles, Count de Carlad\u00e9s and Count de Matignon (1722 \u2013 1749), unmarried, died from smallpox at the age of 27\n\nJacques (born and died 1723), died in infancy\n\nLouise Fran\u00e7oise, Mademoiselle des Baux (1724 \u2013 1729), died in childhood\n\nFran\u00e7ois-Charles, Count of Thorigny (1726 \u2013 1743), died in his teens\n\nCharles-Maurice, Count de Valentinois (1727 \u2013 1798), married Marie Christine Chr\u00e9tienne de Rouvrois, no children\n\nMarie Fran\u00e7oise Th\u00e9r\u00e9se, Mademoiselle d\u2019Estouteville (1728 \u2013 1743), died in her teens\n\nIn 1641, during the reign of Honor\u00e9 II, Monaco had become a French protectorate, and the Princes of Monaco became vassals of the Kings of France while remaining sovereign princes. Many successive Princes of Monaco and their families spent most of their lives in France and intermarried with French and Italian noble families.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III\u2019s parents Louise-Hippolyte and Jacques; Credit \u2013 Wikipedia\n\nBecause of the poor relationship of his maternal grandparents, Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s parents Louise-Hippolyte and Jacques decided to live in France. They spent their time between Jacques\u2019 mansion in Paris, the H\u00f4tel de Matignon, now the official residence of the Prime Minister of France, and Torigni-sur-Vire in Normandy, France where the de Goyon de Matignon family chateau, Ch\u00e2teau des Matignon, was located. Honor\u00e9 was mostly raised at the French court under the supervision of Anne Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte de Bourbon, Duchess of Maine, the wife of Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, Duke of Maine, King Louis XIV\u2019s legitimized son by his official mistress Fran\u00e7oise-Ath\u00e9na\u00efs de Rochechouart de Mortemart, Marquise of Montespan.\n\nOn February 20, 1731, Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s maternal grandfather Antonio I, Prince of Monaco died and his mother Louise-Hippolyte was now the Sovereign Princess of Monaco. Louise-Hippolyte had a very short reign of ten months. Several weeks before Christmas of 1731, a smallpox epidemic spread through the Mediterranean coastal areas. Louise-Hippolyte died from smallpox at the age of 34, on December 29, 1731.\n\nUpon Louise-Hippolyte\u2019s death, her husband Jacques was now the legal guardian of their ten-year-old eldest son Honor\u00e9 and had a plan. Jacques should rule as Prince of Monaco until Honor\u00e9 reached his twenty-fifth birthday. At that time, Honor\u00e9 would abdicate in favor of his father following the example of sons who gave up to their fathers land they had inherited through their mothers. Although the plan was initially accepted, it met with increasing opposition.\n\nFinally, in May 1732, Jacques handed over the rule of Monaco to his brother-in-law Antonio Grimaldi, Chevalier de Grimaldi, an illegitimate son of Antonio I, Prince of Monaco. Jacques\u2019 official abdication date was November 7, 1733, but he had long since returned to Paris with his eldest son who was now technically Honor\u00e9 III, Prince of Monaco. Antonio Grimaldi, Chevalier de Grimaldi became Governor-General of Monaco, was the de facto ruler of Monaco from 1732 until he died in 1784, and ably served as regent for more than fifty years for his nephew Honor\u00e9 III. Honor\u00e9 resided at his father\u2019s Paris home the H\u00f4tel de Matignon and spent much time at the French court at the Palace of Versailles. His father Jacques lived the remainder of his life in France, dying aged 61, on April 23, 1751, at his Paris home, the H\u00f4tel de Matignon.\n\nAs Colonel of the Regiment of Monaco, part of the French army, Honor\u00e9 III took part in the War of the Austrian Succession (1740 \u2013 1748) and was wounded at the 1746 Battle of Rocoux and then at the 1747 Battle of Lawfeld. Honor\u00e9 had close ties to the French kings Louis XV and Louis XVI. In 1756, Honor\u00e9 decreed that Monaco would be ceded to the King of France if the Grimaldi dynasty was to die out.\n\nOver the years, Honor\u00e9 III had declined many marriage proposals. In 1755, a marriage was proposed between 35-year-old Honor\u00e9 and 18-year-old Maria Caterina Brignole, daughter of Giuseppe Brignole, Marquis di Groppoli, the Ambassador to France from the Republic of Genoa, now in Italy, and Maria Anna Balbi. Maria Caterina\u2019s parents came from two of the most powerful families in the Republic of Genoa. Her paternal grandfather Anton Giulio Brignole Sale, 5th Marquis of Groppoli had been Ambassador of the Republic of Genoa to France. Two of her paternal uncles were Doges of the Republic of Genoa. Maria Caterina\u2019s maternal grandfather Francesco Maria Balbi also had been a Doge of the Republic of Genoa.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III had previously been the lover of Maria Caterina\u2019s mother but wished to marry to provide an heir to the throne of Monaco. However, Maria Caterina\u2019s father opposed the marriage because of Honor\u00e9\u2019s bad reputation and because of his fear that Honor\u00e9 might inherit his fortune. In 1756, only after the intervention of King Louis XV of France and his mistress Madame de Pompadour did Maria Caternina\u2019s father consent to the marriage.\n\nThe wedding of Honor\u00e9 III and Maria Caterina was to occur on July 5, 1757, in Monaco, and it got off on a bad foot. Maria Caterina traveled to Monaco by boat accompanied by a contingent of Genovese nobility. When they arrived, Honor\u00e9 did not come aboard the ship to welcome his bride. He said his status as a monarch demanded that Maria Caterina come to him. The Genovese contingent refused, saying that Maria Caterina was a member of a ruling family of the Republic of Genoa. The ship was stranded offshore for several days while a bridge was built between the port and Maria Caterina\u2019s ship. Honor\u00e9 and Maria Caterina walked towards each other at the same distance and met each other over the sea.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III and Maria Caterina had two sons:\n\nHonor\u00e9 III and Maria Caterina initially lived in Monaco but by 1760, Honor\u00e9 was dissatisfied with his life there, and returned to France without his wife, spending time with his mistresses at his French homes. Eventually, Maria Caterina was allowed to come to France. However, Honor\u00e9 continued his affairs and Maria Caterina began an affair, that would become long-term, with Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9. In 1770, Louis Joseph used his influence to obtain a legal separation for Maria Caterina from Honor\u00e9 and the right to manage her own finances. Honor\u00e9 finally realized his relationship with Maria Caterina was over and eventually accepted Maria Caterina\u2019s relationship with Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9. Three years after Honor\u00e9\u2019s death, Maria Caterina and Louis Joseph were married but their marriage was kept secret for ten years.\n\nThe French Revolution had dire consequences for Honor\u00e9 III and his family. The Grimaldi family lost all aristocratic privileges in France and was dispossessed of their French property. In January 1793, Honor\u00e9 III was officially declared deposed and the Principality of Monaco was annexed by France. During the Reign of Terror, in September 1793, Honor\u00e9 III was arrested and imprisoned in Paris. Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s son Honor\u00e9 (IV) was also arrested as were Honor\u00e9 (IV)\u2019s wife Louise d\u2019Aumont and his son Florestan. Honor\u00e9 (IV) was released after fifteen months in prison and his wife and son were saved by their family doctor.\n\nThe last victims of the Reign of Terror on their way to the guillotine \u2013 Among them was Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s daughter-in-law Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Choiseul\n\nThe wife of Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s other son Joseph was not as lucky. Joseph spent most of his time abroad negotiating foreign loans which made him a suspect of counter-revolutionary activities. Joseph did become involved in a counter-revolution in Vend\u00e9e. His wife Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se was arrested in the absence of her husband, condemned to death, and guillotined in 1794, one of the last victims before the end of the Reign of Terror.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III was eventually released from prison. He died soon afterward in Paris on March 21, 1795, at the age of 74, but his burial place is unknown. At 59 years, the reign of Honor\u00e9 III remains the longest in the history of Monaco. Following the defeat of Napoleon I, Emperor of the French in 1814, Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s son Honor\u00e9 IV, aged 56 and in ill health since his imprisonment during the Reign of Terror, returned to Monaco where he reigned as Sovereign Prince until his death in 1819.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

He was the only son of Rainier III, prince of Monaco, and Grace Kelly (Princess Grace of Monaco), a former actress.\n\nAlbert attended Amherst College (B.A., 1981) in Massachusetts and briefly served in the French navy. Following his mother\u2019s death in 1982, he became president of the Monaco Red Cross and was later involved with a number of charities and causes. In 2006 he established the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, focusing on environmental protection. An avid sportsman, he formed the Monegasque Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation in 1987 and, as a member of the principality\u2019s bobsled team, was a five-time Olympian. Albert was also active in the International Olympic Committee, holding a number of positions. In 1994 he became chair of Monaco\u2019s Olympic committee.\n\nAs his father\u2019s health began to decline in the early 21st century, Albert assumed greater royal responsibilities. In April 2005 Prince Rainier died, and Albert formally assumed the throne on July 12. He did so amid controversy, as days earlier he publicly acknowledged that he had fathered a son out of wedlock. In 2006 Albert publicly acknowledged that he had also fathered a daughter. Those children, however, were barred from inheriting the throne, for a 2002 constitutional amendment required the heir\u2019s parents to be married. Another amendment included female siblings and their legitimate heirs in the line of succession, easing concerns of Monaco\u2019s future in the event that Albert, who had two sisters (Caroline and St\u00e9phanie), did not produce a rightful heir. On July 1, 2011, Albert married Charlene Wittstock, a competitive swimmer from South Africa. The couple had twins, Jacques Honor\u00e9 Rainier and Gabriella Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Marie, on December 10, 2014.

In the principality of Monaco, the Grimaldis gathered to mark the centenary of the birth of one of their most important family members, the late Prince Rainier III.\n\nRainier Louis Henri Maxence Bertrand Grimaldi was born in Monaco\u2019s Palais Princier on May 31, 1923. He was the first Grimaldi prince to be born in Monaco in almost two centuries. His mother was Princess Charlotte, the only daughter of Prince Louis II of Monaco, and his father was her soon-to-be-estranged (and, eventually, to be divorced) husband, Count Pierre de Polignac. He had one older sister, Princess Antoinette, but male-preference primogeniture meant that he skipped ahead of her in the line of succession to the Monegasque throne. Educated in England, Switzerland, and France, young Rainier was destined from birth to reign one day as Monaco\u2019s Sovereign Prince. His mother sped up that timeline on May 30, 1944, the day before Rainier\u2019s 21st birthday, when she renounced her right to the throne in favor of her son. After serving with the Free French Army in World War II, Rainier became the Prince of Monaco five years later on the death of his grandfather on May 9, 1949.\n\nThe war years had not been kind to Monaco, and Rainier III inherited a principality that was in dire financial straits. He worked hard to restore the economic status of the small nation, heavily promoting it as a glamorous haven for the ultra-rich. He upped the glamor even more in 1956, when he married the American actress Grace Kelly. The eyes of the world watched as Kelly, who had won the 1955 Best Actress Oscar, married her prince in a lavish ceremony at Monaco\u2019s cathedral.\n\nRainier and Grace\u2019s family grew to include a trio of children: Princess Caroline, born in 1957; Prince Albert, born in 1958, and Princess Stephanie, born in 1965.\n\nThe family was half Monegasque, half American, half European tradition, half Hollywood glitter. Monaco thrived as the press keenly covered the public engagements and personal lives of the Prince and Princess and their children. Rainier continued to reign over the principality, but a series of reforms during his tenure as sovereign prince handed over more power to Monaco\u2019s elected National Council.\n\nOn September 13, 1982, Princess Grace suffered a cerebral hemorrhage while driving her car, and she passed away the following day from the injuries she sustained in the subsequent crash. Prince Rainier would mourn for his late wife for the rest of his life, opting not to remarry. After her death, he established the Princess Grace Foundation to honor her legacy and support the arts both in Monaco and in the United States.\n\nPrince Rainier III reigned for more than half a century, until his death in Monaco on April 6, 2005. He was succeeded by his son, Prince Albert II, who has now been on the throne for nearly two decades.\n\nOn May 31, Rainier\u2019s children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren gathered in Monaco to celebrate his legacy. Prince Albert II was present with his wife, Princess Charlene, and their children, Hereditary Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella. Princess Caroline was joined by her four children, Andrea, Charlotte, Pierre, and Alexandra, with their spouses/partners and children. And Princess Stephanie\u2019s three children, Louis, Pauline, and Camille, were also there, along with Louis\u2019s wife, Marie (who just gave birth to Stephanie\u2019s first grandchild, Victoire Ducruet).\n\nA series of events were held to celebrate Rainier\u2019s life. Here, the family takes place in a painting workshop. They also unveiled a new sculpture walk.\n\nHere, Prince Albert poses with a group of schoolboys on the steps of Monaco\u2019s cathedral during the festivities.\n\nThe Grimaldis also took part in a special parade of vintage cars. Prince Rainier was an avid, enthusiastic car collector, and his impressive personal collection is able to be visited by members of the public.\n\nPrince Albert drove a car with Princess Charlene and the twins as passengers. (I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s Charlene\u2019s little nephew, Raigen Wittstock, in the backseat with his cousins.)\n\nPrincess Caroline drove with her granddaughter, India Casiraghi, in the passenger seat.\n\nHere, Andrea Casiraghi drives a car with his wife, Tatiana, and their younger son, Maximilian, in the front seat.\n\nPrincess Stephanie and Pauline Ducruet rode in the back of Andrea\u2019s car during the parade.\n\nAnd here, Pierre Casiraghi drives with his wife, Beatrice, and their sons, Stefano and Francesco, plus Princess Alexandra and her partner, Ben-Sylvester Strautmann.\n\nLater on, there was cake\u2026\n\n\u2026and, of course, a grand fireworks display over the water.\n\nThe jewels worn for the celebration were small but meaningful. Let\u2019s have a closer look at the jewelry pieces worn by the three senior princesses, shall we? Here\u2019s Princess Charlene wearing a khaki-colored trouser suit with sequin details for the daytime events of the celebration.\n\nShe chose a classic pair of diamond studs, one of her signature jewelry pieces, to go with the suit.\n\nShe also added a special pin celebrating Prince Rainier\u2019s centenary.\n\nIn the evening, Charlene changed into a black dress with eyelet detailing at the neckline.\n\nShe wore the same diamond stud earrings with the dress.\n\nPrincess Caroline wore an ensemble with a red and white color theme, echoing the national colors of Monaco.\n\nShe wore button-style earrings (made of mother-of-pearl and rubies, I think?) and a necklace with a Monegasque flag pendant, as well as a Van Cleef & Arpels bracelet. The pin at the neckline of her gown is made of a coin from the earliest years of Prince Rainier\u2019s reign.\n\nPrincess Stephanie wore a white trouser suit for the celebrations, paired with simple stud earrings.\n\nFor the daytime festivities on Tuesday, she wore a white top under her jacket\u2026\n\n\u2026but in the evening, she wore a commemorative T-shirt from the celebrations, which has a design inspired by vintage travel posters."}, {"url": "https://people.com/royals/prince-albert-dad-prince-rainier-handled-princess-graces-death/", "page_content": "Prince Albert is opening up about his mother Princess Grace\u2018s tragic death, and the moment his father, Prince Rainier, told him about the deadly car crash that claimed his mother\u2019s life and injured his sister, Princess Stephanie.\n\nHollywood actress Grace Kelly, who became Princess Grace when she wed Prince Rainier of Monaco in 1956, suffered a stroke while driving back to Monaco from the royal family\u2019s country home on Sept. 13, 1982.
