{"Pattern's music has been described as 'a mix of soulful, jazzy indie rock, with a hint of funk and a lot of heart.'": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/art/jazz", "page_content": "Nonetheless, one important aspect of jazz clearly does distinguish it from other traditional musical areas, especially from classical music: the jazz performer is primarily or wholly a creative, improvising composer\u2014his own composer, as it were\u2014whereas in classical music the performer typically expresses and interprets someone else\u2019s composition .\n\nMost early classical composers (such as Aaron Copland , John Alden Carpenter \u2014and even Igor Stravinsky , who became smitten with jazz) were drawn to its instrumental sounds and timbres, the unusual effects and inflections of jazz playing (brass mutes, glissandos, scoops, bends, and stringless ensembles), and its syncopations, completely ignoring, or at least underappreciating, the extemporized aspects of jazz. Indeed, the sounds that jazz musicians make on their instruments\u2014the way they attack, inflect, release, embellish, and colour notes\u2014characterize jazz playing to such an extent that if a classical piece were played by jazz musicians in their idiomatic phrasings, it would in all likelihood be called jazz.\n\nJazz, in fact, is not\u2014and never has been\u2014an entirely composed, predetermined music, nor is it an entirely extemporized one. For almost all of its history it has employed both creative approaches in varying degrees and endless permutations. And yet, despite these diverse terminological confusions, jazz seems to be instantly recognized and distinguished as something separate from all other forms of musical expression . To repeat Armstrong\u2019s famous reply when asked what swing meant: \u201cIf you have to ask, you\u2019ll never know.\u201d To add to the confusion, there often have been seemingly unbridgeable perceptual differences between the producers of jazz (performers, composers, and arrangers) and its audiences. For example, with the arrival of free jazz and other latter-day avant-garde manifestations , many senior musicians maintained that music that didn\u2019t swing was not jazz.\n\nAny attempt to arrive at a precise, all-encompassing definition of jazz is probably futile . Jazz has been, from its very beginnings at the turn of the 20th century, a constantly evolving, expanding, changing music, passing through several distinctive phases of development; a definition that might apply to one phase\u2014for instance, to New Orleans style or swing \u2014becomes inappropriate when applied to another segment of its history, say, to free jazz . Early attempts to define jazz as a music whose chief characteristic was improvisation , for example, turned out to be too restrictive and largely untrue, since composition , arrangement , and ensemble have also been essential components of jazz for most of its history. Similarly, syncopation and swing, often considered essential and unique to jazz, are in fact lacking in much authentic jazz, whether of the 1920s or of later decades. Again, the long-held notion that swing could not occur without syncopation was roundly disproved when trumpeters Louis Armstrong and Bunny Berigan (among others) frequently generated enormous swing while playing repeated, unsyncopated quarter notes.\n\njazz , musical form , often improvisational, developed by African Americans and influenced by both European harmonic structure and African rhythms. It was developed partially from ragtime and blues and is often characterized by syncopated rhythms, polyphonic ensemble playing, varying degrees of improvisation, often deliberate deviations of pitch, and the use of original timbres.\n\nWest Africa in the American South: gathering the musical elements of jazz\n\nThe elements that make jazz distinctive derive primarily from West African musical sources as taken to the North American continent by slaves, who partially preserved them against all odds in the plantation culture of the American South. These elements are not precisely identifiable because they were not documented\u2014at least not until the mid- to late 19th century, and then only sparsely. Furthermore, Black slaves came from diverse West African tribal cultures with distinct musical traditions. Thus, a great variety of Black musical sensibilities were assembled on American soil. These in turn rather quickly encountered European musical elements\u2014for example, simple dance and entertainment musics and shape-note hymn tunes, such as were prevalent in early 19th-century North America.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nThe music that eventually became jazz evolved out of a wide-ranging, gradually assimilated mixture of Black and white folk musics and popular styles, with roots in both West Africa and Europe. It is only a slight oversimplification to assert that the rhythmic and structural elements of jazz, as well as some aspects of its customary instrumentation (e.g., banjo or guitar and percussion), derive primarily from West African traditions, whereas the European influences can be heard not only in the harmonic language of jazz but in its use of such conventional instruments as trumpet, trombone, saxophone, string bass, and piano.\n\nThe syncopations of jazz were not entirely new\u2014they had been the central attraction of one of its forerunners, ragtime, and could be heard even earlier in minstrel music and in the work of Creole composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk (Bamboula, subtitled Danse des N\u00e8gres, 1844\u201345, and Ojos Criollos, 1859, among others). Nevertheless, jazz syncopation struck nonblack listeners as fascinating and novel, because that particular type of syncopation was not present in European classical music. The syncopations in ragtime and jazz were, in fact, the result of reducing and simplifying (over a period of at least a century) the complex, multilayered, polyrhythmic, and polymetric designs indigenous to all kinds of West African ritual dance and ensemble music. In other words, the former accentuations of multiple vertically competing metres were drastically simplified to syncopated accents.\n\nThe provenance of melody (tune, theme, motive, riff) in jazz is more obscure. In all likelihood, jazz melody evolved out of a simplified residue and mixture of African and European vocal materials intuitively developed by slaves in the United States in the 1700s and 1800s\u2014for example, unaccompanied field hollers and work songs associated with the changed social conditions of Blacks. The widely prevalent emphasis on pentatonic formations came primarily from West Africa, whereas the diatonic (and later more chromatic) melodic lines of jazz grew from late 19th- and early 20th-century European antecedents.\n\nHarmony was probably the last aspect of European music to be absorbed by Blacks. But once acquired, harmony was applied as an additional musical resource to religious texts; one result was the gradual development of spirituals, borrowing from the white religious revival meetings that African Americans in many parts of the South were urged to attend. One crucial outcome of these musical acculturations was the development by Blacks of the so-called blues scale, with its \u201cblue notes\u201d\u2014the flatted third and seventh degrees. This scale is neither particularly African nor particularly European but acquired its peculiar modality from pitch inflections common to any number of West African languages and musical forms. In effect these highly expressive\u2014and in African terms very meaningful\u2014pitch deviations were superimposed on the diatonic scale common to almost all European classical and vernacular music.\n\nThat jazz developed uniquely in the United States, not in the Caribbean or in South America (or any other realm to which thousands of African Blacks were also transported) is historically fascinating. Many Blacks in those other regions were very often emancipated by the early 1800s and thus were free individuals who actively participated in the cultural development of their own countries. In the case of Brazil, Blacks were so geographically and socially isolated from the white establishment that they simply were able to retain their own African musical traditions in a virtually pure form. It is thus ironic that jazz would probably never have evolved had it not been for the slave trade as it was practiced specifically in the United States.\n\nJazz grew from the African American slaves who were prevented from maintaining their native musical traditions and felt the need to substitute some homegrown form of musical expression. Such composers as the Brazilian mulatto Jos\u00e9 Maur\u00edcio Nunes Garcia were fully in touch with the musical advances of their time that were developing in Europe and wrote music in those styles and traditions. American slaves, by contrast, were restricted not only in their work conditions and religious observances but in leisure activities, including music making. Although slaves who played such instruments as the violin, horn, and oboe were exploited for their musical talents in such cities as Charleston, South Carolina, these were exceptional situations. By and large the slaves were relegated to picking up whatever little scraps of music were allowed them."}, {"url": "https://americanhistory.si.edu/smithsonian-jazz/education/what-jazz", "page_content": "Jazz is a kind of music in which improvisation is typically an important part. In most jazz performances, players play solos which they make up on the spot, which requires considerable skill. There is tremendous variety in jazz, but most jazz is very rhythmic, has a forward momentum called \"swing,\" and uses \"bent\" or \"blue\" notes. You can often hear \"call--and--response\" patterns in jazz, in which one instrument, voice, or part of the band answers another. (You can hear Ella Fitzgerald and Roy Eldridge do \"call and response\" in Ella's Singing Class.) Jazz can express many different emotions, from pain to sheer joy. In jazz, you may hear the sounds of freedom-for the music has been a powerful voice for people suffering unfair treatment because of the color of the skin, or because they lived in a country run by a cruel dictator.\n\nTHE NATURE OF JAZZ\n\nJazz musicians place a high value on finding their own sound and style, and that means, for example, that trumpeter Miles Davis sounds very different than trumpeter Louis Armstrong (whose sound you can hear in Louis's Music Class.) Jazz musicians like to play their songs in their own distinct styles, and so you might listen to a dozen different jazz recordings of the same song, but each will sound different. The musicians' playing styles make each version different, and so do the improvised solos. Jazz is about making something familiar--a familiar song--into something fresh. And about making something shared--a tune that everyone knows--into somethingpersonal. Those are just some of the reasons that jazz is a great art form, and why some people consider it \"America's classical music.\"\n\nTHE GROWTH OF JAZZ\n\nJazz developed in the United States in the very early part of the 20th century. New Orleans, near the mouth of the Mississippi River, played a key role in this development. The city's population was more diverse than anywhere else in the South, and people of African, French, Caribbean, Italian, German, Mexican, and American Indian, as well as English, descent interacted with one another. African-American musical traditions mixed with others and gradually jazz emerged from a blend of ragtime, marches, blues, and other kinds of music. At first jazz was mostly for dancing. (In later years, people would sit and listen to it.) After the first recordings of jazz were made in 1917, the music spread widely and developed rapidly. The evolution of jazz was led by a series of brilliant musicians such as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington (listen to Ellington in Duke's Music Class), Charlie Parker, and Miles Davis. Jazz developed a series of different styles including traditional jazz, swing (listen, for example, to Benny Carter, who got his start in swing music, in Benny's Music Class) bebop, cool jazz, and jazz?rock, among others. At the same time, jazz spread from the United States to many parts of the world, and today jazz musicians--and jazz festivals--can be found in dozens of nations. Jazz is one of the United States's greatest exports to the world."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/art/jazz-rock", "page_content": "jazz-rock, also called fusion, popular musical form in which modern jazz improvisation is accompanied by the bass lines, drumming styles, and instrumentation of rock music, with a strong emphasis on electronic instruments and dance rhythms.\n\nSince the recordings of 1920s bands, notably Paul Whiteman\u2019s, there have been fusions of jazz and popular music, usually presenting jazz\u2019s \u201chot,\u201d swinging, staccato qualities in contrast to \u201csweet,\u201d legato popular music characteristics. With the slow development of a unique identity in rock music, occasional jazz tunes also began including rock rhythms in the 1960s. Beginning in 1969, trumpeter Miles Davis and associates such as drummer Tony Williams, guitarist John McLaughlin, saxophonist Wayne Shorter, and electric keyboardists Joe Zawinul, Herbie Hancock, Larry Young, and Chick Corea broke through to distinctive fusion musics. Jazz and rock elements contrasted, even competed with or enhanced each other, in bands of the early 1970s such as Davis\u2019s increasingly African-music-oriented groups, Williams\u2019s Lifetime quartet, McLaughlin\u2019s fiercely loud and energetic Mahavishnu Orchestra, the light, danceable music of Hancock\u2019s Headhunters and Corea\u2019s Return to Forever, and the mobile sound and rhythmic colours of Zawinul\u2019s and Shorter\u2019s Weather Report.\n\nThe most important work by these musicians dates from the early 1970s; since then, most have alternated between periods of playing fusion music and playing mainstream jazz. The jazz-rock idiom gained one of the largest jazz audiences since the swing era ended in the mid-1940s. The style was also known as crossover because sales of the music crossed over from the jazz market to the popular music market. Guitarist Larry Coryell was popular in the early years of jazz-rock fusion; guitarist Pat Metheny, with his pastoral harmonies, has been a star since the late 1970s.\n\nMeanwhile, two other kinds of fusion music were also current. The most popular jazz-rock strain grew out of hard bop: the funky 1960s jazz of musicians such as flutist Herbie Mann, alto saxophonist Hank Crawford, and the Crusaders. Their repertoires included original and standard rock tunes over which they improvised jazz. In the 1970s the CTI record label in particular offered this kind of fusion music on albums by Stanley Turrentine, Freddie Hubbard, and others. Less commercially successful was the free jazz fusion of Ornette Coleman\u2019s Prime Time group (beginning in 1973) and his associates, guitarist James Blood Ulmer, bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, and drummer Ronald Shannon Jackson, though all led valuable bands in the 1980s. One problem was that the recurring rhythmic-harmonic patterns of rock tended to dominate, reducing jazz improvisation to mere decoration.\n\nA later development of jazz-rock\u2014contemporary jazz, or light jazz\u2014appeared on the radio in the 1980s and \u201990s. The most popular kind of fusion music, it abandoned jazz elements almost completely and frequently used a minimum of improvisation. Stars of contemporary jazz included saxophonist Kenny G and the group Spyro Gyra. Two jazz-rock fashions of the 1990s were acid jazz, a catchall term for bop and free jazz improvising over funk and hip-hop rhythms; and neo-swing, which revived the shuffle rhythms of small 1940s swing (\u201cjump\u201d) bands."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/art/blues-music", "page_content": "The blues has a distinct melancholic and somber tone, which is achieved through vocal techniques such as melisma , rhythmic techniques such as syncopation , and instrumental techniques such as \u201cchoking\u201d guitar strings on the neck or applying a metal slide to the guitar strings to create a whining voicelike sound.\n\nIn the early 20th century the blues (among several other popular genres of music) was considered seductive and destructive by parents and clergy who worried that such \u201cDevil\u2019s music\u201d was a dangerous and sinful influence on children.\n\nThe origins of the blues are poorly documented, but it is believed that after the American Civil War (1861\u201365), formerly enslaved African Americans and their descendants created this genre while working on Southern plantations, taking inspiration from hymns , minstrel show music, work songs and field hollers, ragtime , and popular music of the Southern white population.\n\nIn the 19th century the English phrase blue devils referred to the upsetting hallucinations brought on by severe alcohol withdrawal. This was later shortened to the blues, which described states of depression and upset, and it was later adopted as the name for the melancholic songs that the musical genre encapsulates.\n\nThe blues is a form of secular folk music created by African Americans in the early 20th century, originally in the South.

Blues songs are lyrical rather than narrative; blues singers are expressing feelings rather than telling stories. The emotion expressed is generally one of sadness or melancholy, often due to problems of love but also oppression and hard times. To express this musically, blues performers use vocal techniques such as melisma (sustaining a single syllable across several pitches), rhythmic techniques such as syncopation, and instrumental techniques such as \u201cchoking\u201d or bending guitar strings on the neck or applying a metal slide or bottleneck to the guitar strings to create a whining voicelike sound.\n\nAs a musical style, the blues is characterized by expressive \u201cmicrotonal\u201d pitch inflections (blue notes), a three-line textual stanza of the form AAB, and a 12-measure form. Typically the first two and a half measures of each line are devoted to singing, the last measure and a half consisting of an instrumental \u201cbreak\u201d that repeats, answers, or complements the vocal line.

One of the more technical elements is called syncopation, or an unexpected rhythm on the off-beat. Western music is built upon several expectations. Certain chord changes and progressions place emphasis on certain beats, usually the first and third. Syncopation places rhythmic stress in areas where it normally isn't found, like on the second and fourth beats. This is one of the ways that jazz maintains such an improvised feel, even when it's not improvised.\n\nSyncopation feels unexpected, sometimes even forced, but breaks up normal rhythms into unique patterns. In jazz, syncopation really traces its roots back to Buddy Bolden, a New Orleans cornet player who played between 1895 and 1906. Bolden's band is often credited with developing the first standard syncopated bass drum pattern, which created emphasis on the off-beats.\n\nThe other major element of jazz music is the swing note. Strictly defined, it is a triple subdivision of the beat against duple subdivisions. But I prefer Louis Armstrong's definition: 'If you don't feel it, you'll never know it.' In essence, swing is a rhythmic momentum, a pulsing of the beat created by playing notes written in the same duration as a pattern of long and short.\n\nLook at this section of sheet music. On paper, these are all eighth notes, so they should all be the same length. However, when this is swung, every other note is played a little bit longer. So, where does it say on the sheet music to do that? Well, it doesn't. Swing is something that is often spontaneous, only used by musicians when it feels right. Sometimes a jazz band will decide collectively to swing a piece, other times a soloist will improvise it, but it's always a personal choice.\n\nHistory and Styles of Jazz\n\nWith something so hard to truly define, it shouldn't be any surprise that the history of jazz isn't exactly known. Jazz music, as we know it, sort of appeared in the early 20th century amongst African-American musicians in New Orleans. The first styles of jazz drew very heavily from African-American music and rhythms; even the swing beat was a common element of African music used by African-American musicians for decades. After slavery was abolished in 1865, African-American musicians were able to pursue opportunities around the country, and they introduced new rhythms and melodies into mainstream American music."}, {"url": "https://walnutcreekband.org/how-do-you-describe-jazz-music/", "page_content": "While there are many ways to describe jazz music, there are some essential elements that make this genre of music so unique and special.\n\nWhat is Jazz Music?\n\nJazz music is a genre of American music that originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in African American communities in the Southern United States. It developed from roots in blues and ragtime and styles such as Dixieland jazz. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African American music traditions including blues and ragtime.\n\nThe History of Jazz Music\n\nJazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is characterized by syncopated rhythms, polyphonic ensemble playing, and improvisation. Jazz developed from roots in blues and ragtime and quickly spread to Europe and the rest of the world.\n\nJazz has been described as \u201cthe sound of surprise\u201d, and its history is closely linked to the social and political history of the United States. The early years of jazz were defined by pioneering musicians such as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and Jelly Roll Morton, who developed new musical styles by fusing African-American musical traditions with European musical traditions. In the 1920s, jazz began to be influenced by Latin American music, particularly Cuban music.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, jazz was further influenced by swing music, a style of popular music that developed out of jazz. Swing was characterized by a strong rhythm section, often made up of brass instruments such as trumpets and trombones, as well as a lightening-fast tempo. Swing became very popular with white audiences and helped to make jazz more mainstream.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, jazz began to be influenced by rock music and OTHER popular styles such as soul and funk. This led to the development of different subgenres of jazz such as hard bop, free jazz, and fusion. Today, jazz is enjoyed all over the world by people of all ages and from all walks of life.\n\nThe Different Styles of Jazz Music\n\nJazz music is a type of music that originated in the African-American communities in the United States. It is a genre of music that is characterized by Swing, blue notes, call and response, polyrhythms, and improvisation. Jazz has been influences by various types of music such as blues, gospel, and ragtime. The different styles of jazz music include:\n\n-Dixieland: This style of jazz was the first type of jazz to be played. It originated in New Orleans in the early 1900s. Dixieland jazz is characterized by a Collective improvisation, where all the musicians play together. The most common instrumentation for this style of jazz is: trumpet, clarinet, trombone, and drums.\n\n-Swing: Swing jazz is a type of Jazz that developed in the early 1930s. Swing music is characterized by a strong rhythm section, often featuring a walking bass line and drums playing four on the floor. The most common instrumentation for this style of jazz is: trumpet, saxophone, trombone, piano, guitar, bass, and drums.\n\n-Bebop: Bebop is a type of jazz that developed in the mid-1940s. Bebop is characterized by fast tempos, complex chord progressions, and improvisation based on these progressions. The most common instrumentation for this style of jazz is: trumpet, saxophone, trombone, piano bass , and drums.\n\n-Cool Jazz: Cool jazz developed in the late 1940s and early 1950s. It was influenced by bebop but sought to create a more relaxed atmosphere than bebop did. Cool jazz is characterized by MODAL harmonic structures rather than complex chord progressions . The most common instrumentation for this style cool jazz cool piano , saxophone , trumpet , and drums .\n\n\u2013 Hard Bop : Hard bop developed in the mid \u2013 1950s and was influenced bebop , cool Jazz , gospel , and blues . Hard bop is characterized by mix different styles of music , often featuring funky rhythms , driving brass sections , and Soulful vocals . The most common instrumentation for this style of hard bop brass instruments like trumpets and trombones as well as electric guitar , piano , bass , and drums .\n\nThe Key Elements of Jazz Music\n\nJazz music is a complex and ever-evolving genre that defies easy categorization. At its core, jazz is a mix of African and European musical traditions. The earliest Jazz recordings were made in the 1920s, and the genre has since evolved to encompass a wide range of styles and sub-genres.\n\nThe key elements of Jazz music include improvisation, swing, blue notes, call and response, Polyrhythm, and syncopation. These elements are often combined in unique ways to create new and exciting sounds.\n\nJazz music is typically played on acoustic instruments such as piano, bass, trumpet, saxophone, and drums. However, there is no definitive instrumentation for Jazz ensembles, and many groups experiment with different combinations of instruments.\n\nThe history of Jazz is often divided into three distinct periods: the New Orleans era (1920s-1930s), the Swing era (1930s-1940s), and the Bebop era (1940s-1950s). Each of these periods saw the development of new styles and sub-genres that helped shape the course of Jazz music.\n\nThe Characteristics of Jazz Music\n\nJazz music is a genre of music that originated in the African-American communities in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.Characteristics of Jazz Music\n\nThe following are some of the characteristic features of jazz music.\n\nJazz is characterized byswing, which is a rhythmic style that involves alternation between notes that are played with different levels of force. This creates a \u201clilting\u201d feeling.\n\nIn addition, jazz employs improvising musicians who make up melodies on the spot as they play. This is often done by playing \u201criffs\u201d or short melodic phrases.\n\nAnother feature of jazz is its use of blue notes, which are notes that are played at a slightly lower pitch than would be expected. This gives jazz its distinctive \u201cbluesy\u201d sound.\n\nHow Jazz Music is Created\n\nMusicians who improvise jazz create their own melodies over the chords of a song. This is what gives jazz its distinctive sound. The chords provide the \u201charmonic framework\u201d or \u201charmonic skeleton\u201d for a piece of music, on top of which the soloist creates a melody. The soloist may also use ideas from the original melody or base their improvisation on scales associated with the chords.\n\nThe Role of Improvisation in Jazz Music\n\nJazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States. It is characterized by blue notes, call-and-response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime.\n\nThe Influence of Jazz Music\n\nJazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States. It originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and developed from roots in blues and ragtime. Jazz is seen by many as \u201cAmerica\u2019s classical music\u201d. Since the 1920s Jazz Age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime.\n\nThe Future of Jazz Music\n\nJazz music has been around for over a century, and it shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, many experts believe that jazz is currently experiencing a renaissance, with more people than ever before taking an interest in this unique and endlessly inventive genre.\n\nSo what does the future hold for jazz? Well, it\u2019s hard to say for sure. One thing that seems certain is that jazz will continue to evolve, incorporating new influences and ideas from a wide range of other genres. We may even see the emergence of entirely new sub-genres of jazz in the years to come.\n\nOne thing is for sure: jazz is here to stay. So if you\u2019re not already a fan, now is the perfect time to start exploring this fascinating and always evolving genre!\n\nWhy Jazz Music Matters\n\nJazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities in the United States. It is characterized by a complex and ever-changing style that incorporates elements of blues, ragtime, and European classical music. Jazz has been an important part of American culture for more than a century and has had a significant impact on other genres of music around the world.\n\nDespite its popularity, jazz has often been misunderstood or misrepresented. For many people, jazz is seen as abstract or inaccessible. But at its heart, jazz is about expression and communication.

However, a generally agreed upon classification is that indie music is music that has been produced outside of commercial record labels, music that has a DIY approach to both recording and publishing.\n\nThat description, indie as an economic model of producing your own music, or producing music with an independent label, is one way to look at it. But Indie music is also sometimes used as a genre description, a way to describe a certain sound. And it's true, some artists and bands are considered 'indie' and do record and produce their music within a commercial record label. Similarly, many DIY 'indie' bands produce music outside of the record industry but who fall into various other genres, and would not easily identify themselves with the term 'indie'. This has led many to question whether the use of 'indie' as a term to describe a style of music has any real meaning.\n\nIndie vs. Alternative\n\nThere is a lot of confusion about the difference between the alternative and indie genres. The history of the two terms intertwines. Alternative first pops up in the 1980s to describe rock music that was simply considered outside of the mainstream. At the time popular rock bands were power metal, glam metal, and classic style rock. They were technical and very polished. But many underground artists were still playing rock and certainly did not fit any of those categories.\n\nThe term indie is similar. Indie first simply means bands that are not signed to one of the major labels and came from a variety of genres. The internet increased the awareness of many of these bands as it became easier to share music. Many bands that were once considered indie would end up signing with major labels, such as The Strokes and Modest Mouse.\n\nAlternative rock and indie rock have gradually merged with each other because of their extensive overlap. Many indie rock bands are simultaneously categorized as alternative rock, and many alternative rock bands are simultaneously categorized as indie bands. This has led to an oxymoronic situation in which you have many indie artists recording on major labels, and many alternative artists recording on independent labels. But the reason for this confusion has to do with the common threads that have existed between artists of both genres throughout the years.\n\nAt the end of the day, it really doesn't make a difference what you call these bands. Whether you consider them indie or alternative are merely semantic differences that have no clear solution. The power of the music produced by these artists extends far beyond what these mere labels describe.\n\nStill, the indie genres has a fascinating history. So let's take a look at some of indie music's characteristics, and the huge variety of subgenres of indie music that have existed throughout the years.\n\nRead our article on Pop Music Genres and Characteristics.\n\nIndie Rock\n\nDescribing a very diverse range of subgenres, as we said above, indie rock does not describe a definitive musical entity. However, a few things do tend to typify indie rock bands. One of the more important things is that indie rock artists tend to reject the swagger typified by traditional rock bands. The use of the term 'indie' to describe bands that did not record on the major commercial labels fell out of fashion in the 80s. Instead, indie began to refer to a style of music usually related to punk or post-punk.\n\nThe 90s saw grunge, punk-revival, and Britpop bands go mainstream, but many of these bands were able to maintain their 'indie' status. For example, Sub Pop Records enjoyed mainstream success in the early 1990s with the rise of the grunge genre, which they were instrumental in promoting. But in 1995 they sold to Warner Music Group.\n\nLo-fi, emo, noise pop, slowcore, math-rock, and post-rock are all considered indie genres. The 2000s saw the impact of the internet on music consumption and distribution, and new waves of indie bands began to achieve success, some of them signing to major labels, others continued with independent labels. Many of these bands played a kind of back-to-basics guitar rock, like The Strokes and The White Stripes.\n\nEmo\n\nBoth Weezer and Jawbreaker would release foundational emo albums in 1994 (24 Hour Revenge Therapy, and Weezer respectively). But the emo genre traces its roots back to 1984 and the post-hardcore band Rites of Spring which combined the hardcore punk music style with more varied rhythms and melodies, as well as lyrical content that would come to define the genre: personal, emotional, nostalgia-driven, romantically bitter and poetically desperate. Like many of these music subgenres, emo is more than just a music style, it also has an associated fashion and cultural element, including long bangs, skinny jeans, tight t-shirts, studded belts. Emo enjoyed mainstream success in the early 2000s with bands like My Chemical Romance and Fall Out Boy.\n\nNoise Pop\n\nWith its mix of feedback, dissonance, and pop music songcraft, noise pop experimented with distortion, drones, and white noise all while maintaining conventional pop music songwriting. The style has been described as hazy, narcotic, textured, angular and many regard the influential band The Velvet Underground as one of the earliest examples of the genre. It wasn't, however, until 1985's Psychocandy by the Scottish alt-rock band The Jesus and Mary Chain that the genre was properly born. Noise pop would lead directly to the development of the shoegazing movement which began to emerge in the late '80s.\n\nKeep reading on about The Stages of Custom Music Production & Its Benefits to gain a deeper understanding of the topic.\n\nPost-Punk Revival\n\nThis genre of indie rock began developing in the late 90s and early aughts. Inspired by a combination of different styles, primarily garage rock, new wave, and post-punk, several post-punk revival bands went mainstream in the early 2000s. Post-punk itself was a style of music developed in the late 1970s that saw a departure from the simplistic traditions of punk rock and infused the genre with avant-garde influences. Post-punk revival offered a return to that late-70s form ranging from the atonal music created by groups like Liars to the more melodic pop-inflected songs of The Sounds. Several bands saw mainstream success such as The Strokes, The Killers, Franz Ferdinand, and the Arctic Monkeys. The style declined in popularity by 2010, but many bands, such as Arcade Fire, were strongly influenced by the subgenre.\n\nIndie Pop\n\nLike indie rock, indie pop is related to rock music in general, particularly guitar pop. Indie pop generally exists in opposition to mainstream pop with its do-it-yourself ethic. Also like indie rock, indie pop traces its origin from post-punk. Melodies tend to play a more prominent role in indie pop when compared to indie rock, and they tend to be less abrasive, more positive, and relatively free of angst. Chamber pop, twee pop, dream pop, and the Japanese Shibuya-Kei style are all examples of this genre. Let's take a look at them.\n\nChamber Pop\n\nMelody, texture, and use of orchestral elements such as strings, horns, and piano, are all defining elements of chamber pop (sometimes called 'orchestral pop'). The Beach Boys' 1966 album Pet Sounds was a huge influence on the subgenre, as were the baroque pop bands of the 1960s. Like all of the indie bands on this list, chamber pop is stylistically and aesthetically diverse. But they all share a strong influence by pop musicians like Burt Bacharach, Scott Walker, Lee Hazlewood, and Brian Wilson. Chamber pop shares many parallel influences with the Japanese music movement known as Shibuya-Kei.\n\nTwee Pop\n\nWould you be interested in Music 101: What is Indie Music?\n\nThe origins of twee pop take us back to 1986, and to a cassette compilation put out by the British music magazine NME. Originally it was the term C86 that defined this kind of indie music. Twee pop is characterized by treble-heavy, undistorted guitars, with power-pop melodies and structures. Boy-girl harmonies, lyrics about love and relationships, and a perceived innocence also define its sound. Twee pop would evolve into the cuddlecore subgenre, which enjoyed brief success in the mid-90s\n\nDream Pop\n\nThis subgenre often overlaps with other indie genres, especially shoegaze, so much so that dream pop and shoegaze are often used interchangeably. The main thing that sets this genre apart from its peers is its atmosphere and heavy reliance on sonic textures, and the immersive experience offered to the listener. Again the music of Brian Wilson and other mid-60s/early-70s figures were the primary source of influence. Bands such as Cocteau Twins, A. R. Kane, Bat for Lashes, and My Bloody Valentine all count themselves among the genres best.\n\nUnderground Hip Hop\n\nSometimes refered to as 'indie hip-hop', underground hip-hop encompasses anything in hip-hop that is produced outside of the commercial record. It does have some characteristics that make it different from its more commercial cousin, and that includes lyrics that are generally more socially conscious and positive. Alt-hip hop and 'conscious' hip hop all have ties to underground hip-hop and emphasize that they do not conform to any of the traditional genres or stereotypes, and draw equally from funk, pop, rock, jazz, reggae, soul, and folk music.\n\nIndie Music Scenes\n\nIn addition to the different subgenres of indie music, there are also several localized 'indie music scenes'. Often a local music scene can play just as much of a role in music history and the developments of different genres as the music coming out of the big commercial labels.\n\nOther readers recommend reading about Arpeggiator and Its Uses next for more information.\n\nSome examples of prominent indie music scenes are:\n\nNo Wave - This was an avant-garde art scene that came out of late 70s New York City. It was a reaction against punk rock and its perceived recycling of clich\u00e9s and influences from rock music. Musicians of the No Wave movement relied on experimentation with noise and dissonance, with atonality and abrasiveness, and with confrontation and a worldview drenched in nihilism. The movement embraced many different styles such as funk, jazz, blues, and punk rock. Perhaps the best-known band to emerge from this genre was Sonic Youth.\n\nMadchester - Developed in Manchester, U.K. in the late 80s, Madchester was an indie cultural scene. Not just a music scene, Madchester was closely associated with dance. 'Indie-raves' were presided over by music that merged acid house, psychedelia, 60s pop, and rave music. It was heavily influenced by the drug MDMA and was part of a broader social phenomenon of 1980s UK youth culture, sometimes called the Second Summer of Love. Madchester Bands would dominate the UK indie charts for much of the late 80s and early 90s. Some well-known groups to come out of the Madchester scene include The Stone Roses and 808 State.\n\nGrunge - This subculture, which was also sometimes referred to as 'Seattle sound', was a rock subculture that emerged in the mid-80s around the state of Washington. Fusing punk rock and heavy metal, Grunge incorporated angst-filled, introspective lyrics that addressed themes of social alienation, trauma, neglect, and self-doubt. Sub Pop Records was home to many of the brands associated with the grunge movement, and this independent label did much to market the genre before selling out to Warner Music Group in 1995. In the early 90s grunge was hugely popular throughout the English-speaking world, and made grunge the most popular form of rock music of its day. Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains were all bands that came out of that movement.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we've seen, indie music is hardly one single thing. Not only does it have multiple, sometimes overlapping subgenres, but the genre of 'indie music' itself overlaps with other broader musical trends, like alternative rock, punk, pop, and hip-hop. No sooner can you point to an example of what indie music 'is', than you can point to several contradictory examples that hold up a different ethos. Regardless of the differences, indie music shares a rejection of commercial aspirations, and the trends of commercial genres.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: You may be interested in What is Sound Design and Its Use ? as well."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/art/music", "page_content": "But the prevalence of music is nothing new, and its human importance has often been acknowledged. What seems curious is that, despite the universality of the art, no one until recent times has argued for its necessity. The ancient Greek philosopher Democritus explicitly denied any fundamental need for music: \u201cFor it was not necessity that separated it off, but it arose from the existing superfluity.\u201d The view that music and the other arts are mere graces is still widespread, although the growth of psychological understanding of play and other symbolic activities has begun to weaken this tenacious belief.\n\nMusic is an art that, in one guise or another, permeates every human society. Modern music is heard in a bewildering profusion of styles, many of them contemporary, others engendered in past eras. Music is a protean art; it lends itself easily to alliances with words, as in song , and with physical movement, as in dance . Throughout history, music has been an important adjunct to ritual and drama and has been credited with the capacity to reflect and influence human emotion . Popular culture has consistently exploited these possibilities, most conspicuously today by means of radio , film , television , musical theatre , and the Internet . The implications of the uses of music in psychotherapy , geriatrics , and advertising testify to a faith in its power to affect human behaviour . Publications and recordings have effectively internationalized music in its most significant, as well as its most trivial, manifestations . Beyond all this, the teaching of music in primary and secondary schools has now attained virtually worldwide acceptance.\n\nmusic , art concerned with combining vocal or instrumental sounds for beauty of form or emotional expression, usually according to cultural standards of rhythm , melody , and, in most Western music, harmony . Both the simple folk song and the complex electronic composition belong to the same activity, music. Both are humanly engineered; both are conceptual and auditory, and these factors have been present in music of all styles and in all periods of history, throughout the world.\n\nHistorical conceptions\n\nMusic is everywhere to be heard. But what is music? Commentators have spoken of \u201cthe relationship of music to the human senses and intellect,\u201d thus affirming a world of human discourse as the necessary setting for the art. A definition of music itself will take longer. As Aristotle said, \u201cIt is not easy to determine the nature of music or why anyone should have a knowledge of it.\u201d\n\nEarly in the 20th century, it was regarded as a commonplace that a musical tone was characterized by the regularity of its vibrations; this uniformity gave it a fixed pitch and distinguished its sounds from \u201cnoise.\u201d Although that view may have been supported by traditional music, by the latter half of the 20th century it was recognized as an unacceptable yardstick. Indeed, \u201cnoise\u201d itself and silence became elements in composition, and random sounds were used (without prior knowledge of what they would be) by composers, such as the American John Cage, and others in works having aleatory (chance) or impromptu features. Tone, moreover, is only one component in music, others being rhythm, timbre (tone colour), and texture. Electronic machinery enabled some composers to create works in which the traditional role of the interpreter is abolished and to record, directly on tape or into a digital file, sounds that were formerly beyond human ability to produce, if not to imagine.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

In India, music has been put into the service of religion from earliest times; Vedic hymns stand at the beginning of the record. As the art developed over many centuries into a music of profound melodic and rhythmic intricacy, the discipline of a religious text or the guideline of a story determined the structure. In the 21st century the narrator remains central to the performance of much Indian traditional music, and the virtuosity of a skillful singer rivals that of the instrumentalists. There is very little concept of vocal or instrumental idiom in the Western sense. The vertical dimension of chord structure\u2014that is, the effects created by sounding tones simultaneously\u2014is not a part of South Asian classical music; the divisions of an octave (intervals) are more numerous than in Western music, and the melodic complexity of the music goes far beyond that of its Western counterpart. Moreover, an element of improvisation is retained that is vital to the success of a performance. The spontaneous imitation carried on between an instrumentalist and narrator, against the insistent rhythmic subtleties of the drums, can be a source of the greatest excitement, which in large measure is because of the faithful adherence to the rigid rules that govern the rendition of ragas\u2014the ancient melodic patterns of Indian music. traditional Chinese music Chinese music, like the music of India, has traditionally been an adjunct to ceremony or narrative. Confucius (551\u2013479 bce) assigned an important place to music in the service of a well-ordered moral universe. He saw music and government as reflecting one another and believed that only the superior man who can understand music is equipped to govern. Music, he thought, reveals character through the six emotions that it can portray: sorrow, satisfaction, joy, anger, piety, love. According to Confucius, great music is in harmony with the universe, restoring order to the physical world through that harmony. Music, as a true mirror of character, makes pretense or deception impossible.\n\nAncient Greek ideas traditional Greek music Although music was important in the life of ancient Greece, it is not now known how that music actually sounded. Only a few notated fragments have survived, and no key exists for restoring even these. The Greeks were given to theoretical speculation about music; they had a system of notation, and they \u201cpracticed music,\u201d as Socrates himself, in a vision, had been enjoined to do. But the Greek term from which the word music is derived was a generic one, referring to any art or science practiced under the aegis of the Muses. Music, therefore, as distinct from gymnastics, was all-encompassing. (Much speculation, however, was clearly directed toward that more-restricted meaning with which we are familiar.) Music was virtually a department of mathematics for the philosopher Pythagoras (c. 550 bce), who was the first musical numerologist and who laid the foundations for acoustics. In acoustics, the Greeks discovered the correspondence between the pitch of a note and the length of a string. But they did not progress to a calculation of pitch on the basis of vibrations, though an attempt was made to connect sounds with underlying motions. Plato (428\u2013348/347 bce), like Confucius, looked on music as a department of ethics. And like Confucius he was anxious to regulate the use of particular modes (i.e., arrangements of notes, like scales) because of their supposed effects on people. Plato was a stern musical disciplinarian; he saw a correspondence between the character of a person and the music that represented him or her. Straightforward simplicity was best. In the Laws, Plato declared that rhythmic and melodic complexities were to be avoided because they led to depression and disorder. Music echoes divine harmony; rhythm and melody imitate the movements of heavenly bodies, thus delineating the music of the spheres and reflecting the moral order of the universe. Earthly music, however, is suspect; Plato distrusted its emotional power. Music must therefore be of the right sort; the sensuous qualities of certain modes are dangerous, and a strong censorship must be imposed. Music and gymnastics in the correct balance would constitute the desirable curriculum in education. Plato valued music in its ethically approved forms; his concern was primarily with the effects of music, and he therefore regarded it as a psychosociological phenomenon. Yet Plato, in treating earthly music as a shadow of the ideal, saw a symbolic significance in the art. Aristotle carried forward the concept of the art as imitation, but music could express the universal as well. His idea that works of art could contain a measure of truth in themselves\u2014an idea voiced more explicitly by Plotinus in the 3rd century ce\u2014gave added strength to the symbolic view. Aristotle, following Plato, thought that music has power to mold human character, but he would admit all the modes, recognizing happiness and pleasure as values to both the individual and the state. He advocated a rich musical diet. Aristotle made a distinction between those who have only theoretical knowledge and those who produce music, maintaining that persons who do not perform cannot be good judges of the performances of others. Aristoxenus, a pupil of Aristotle, gave considerable credit to human listeners, their importance, and their powers of perception. He denigrated the dominance of mathematical and acoustical considerations. For Aristoxenus, music was emotional and fulfilled a functional role, for which both the hearing and the intellect of the listener were essential. Individual tones were to be understood in their relations to one another and in the context of larger formal units. The Epicureans and Stoics adopted a more naturalistic view of music and its function, which they accepted as an adjunct to the good life. They gave more emphasis to sensation than did Plato, but they nevertheless placed music in the service of moderation and virtue. A dissenting 3rd-century voice was that of Sextus Empiricus, who said that music was an art of tones and rhythms only that meant nothing outside itself. The Platonic influence in musical thought was to be dominant for at least a millennium. Following that period of unquestioned philosophical allegiance, there were times of rededication to Greek concepts, accompanied by reverent and insistent homage (e.g., the group of late 16th-century Florentines, known as the Camerata, who were instrumental in the development of opera). Such returns to simplicity, directness, and the primacy of the word have been made periodically, out of loyalty to Platonic imperatives, however much these \u201cneo\u201d practices may have differed from those of the Greeks themselves. In the 21st century the effects of Greek thought are still strongly evident in the belief that music influences the ethical life; in the idea that music can be explained in terms of some component such as number (that may itself be only a reflection of another, higher source); in the view that music has specific effects and functions that can be appropriately labelled; and in the recurrent observation that music is connected with human emotion. In every historical period there have been defectors from one or more of these views, and there are, of course, differences of emphasis."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/art/soul-music", "page_content": "soul music, term adopted to describe African American popular music in the United States as it evolved from the 1950s to the \u201960s and \u201970s. Some view soul as merely a new term for rhythm and blues. In fact a new generation of artists profoundly reinterpreted the sounds of the rhythm-and-blues pioneers of the 1950s\u2014Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Bo Diddley, Sam Cooke, and Ray Charles\u2014whose music found popularity among whites and was transformed into what became known as rock and roll.\n\nIf rock and roll, represented by performers such as Elvis Presley, can be seen as a white reading of rhythm and blues, soul is a return to African American music\u2019s roots\u2014gospel and blues. The style is marked by searing vocal intensity, use of church-rooted call-and-response, and extravagant melisma. If in the 1950s Charles was the first to secularize pure gospel songs, that transformation realized its full flowering in the work of Aretha Franklin, the \u201cQueen of Soul,\u201d who, after six years of notable work on Columbia Records, began her glorious reign in 1967 with her first hits for Atlantic Records\u2014\u201cI Never Loved a Man (the Way I Love You)\u201d and \u201cRespect.\u201d Before Franklin, though, soul music had exploded largely through the work of Southern artists such as James Brown and Southern-oriented labels such as Stax/Volt.\n\nThe Motown sound, which came of age in the 1960s, must also be considered soul music. In addition to its lighter, more pop-oriented artists such as the Supremes, the Motown label produced artists with genuine gospel grit\u2014the Contours (\u201cDo You Love Me\u201d [1962]), Marvin Gaye (\u201cCan I Get a Witness\u201d [1963]), and Stevie Wonder (\u201cUptight [Everything\u2019s Alright]\u201d [1966]). But Motown packaged its acts as clean-cut and acceptable, as it sought to sell to white teens. As the civil rights movement gained steam, African American artists grew more politically aware. Rooted in personal expression, their music resonates with self-assertion, culminating in Brown\u2019s \u201cSay It Loud\u2014I\u2019m Black and I\u2019m Proud (Part 1)\u201d (1968).\n\nIn Memphis, Tennessee, Stax/Volt Records was built on an unshakable foundation of straight-up soul. Singers such as Otis Redding, Sam and Dave, and Isaac Hayes screamed, shouted, begged, stomped, and cried, harkening back to the blues shouters of the Deep South. Atlantic\u2019s Jerry Wexler, who had participated in the earliest phase of soul music with his productions for Solomon Burke (\u201cJust Out of Reach\u201d [1961]), began recording Franklin as well as Wilson Pickett, one of soul\u2019s premier vocalists, in Fame Studios in Florence, Alabama, where the arrangements were largely spontaneous and surprisingly sparse\u2014strong horn lines supported by a rhythm section focused on boiling funk.\n\nOther artists and producers followed Wexler\u2019s lead. Etta James, with her earthshaking delivery and take-no-prisoners approach, traveled to Muscle Shoals, Alabama, to record \u201cTell Mama\u201d (1967), one of the decade\u2019s enduring soul anthems, written by singer and songwriter Clarence Carter. Percy Sledge\u2019s supersmooth \u201cWhen a Man Loves a Woman\u201d (1966), recorded in nearby Sheffield, became the first Southern soul song to reach number one on the pop charts.\n\nSoul was not restricted to the South and to Detroit, Michigan. Curtis Mayfield\u2019s Impressions, prime movers of Chicago soul, added their own sense of social consciousness to the soul music movement, notably in \u201cKeep On Pushing\u201d (1964) and \u201cPeople Get Ready\u201d (1965). By the decade\u2019s end even Motown, the most conservative of the soul labels, had begun to release issue-oriented records, especially with Norman Whitfield\u2019s dynamic productions for the Temptations (\u201cCloud Nine\u201d [1968]) and Edwin Starr (\u201cWar\u201d [1970]). Soul also flowered in New Orleans, Louisiana, in the ultrafunky work of Art Neville\u2019s group the Meters. Atlantic Records produced smoldering soul smashes in New York City\u2014notably by Aretha Franklin and Donny Hathaway; Wonder and the Jackson 5 created some of the era\u2019s great soul records in Los Angeles; and in Philadelphia, Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff virtually reinvented the genre with the O\u2019Jays and Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.
