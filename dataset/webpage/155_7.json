Few know, however, how much strength he drew from his Down Syndrome daughter.\n\nWhen it comes to failed governments in our time, it\u2019s hard to ignore French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s administration. Hollande\u2019s record on basic issues like unemployment as well as his ineptness in the face of jihadist terrorism is so unimpressive that he declined to run for reelection. This, however, hasn\u2019t stopped his government from making the type of last-minute defiant gesture beloved of administrations whose days are numbered.\n\nIn Hollande\u2019s case, it has taken the form of effectively banning pro-life websites that don\u2019t explicitly identify themselves as pro-life. This follows a 2016 ruling by France\u2019s Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat endorsing a broadcasting tribunal\u2019s 2014 decision to prohibit a commercial portraying Down Syndrome children as joyful individuals loved by their parents because it might distress those who chose to terminate an unborn disabled child.\n\nReflecting upon these developments, I couldn\u2019t help thinking how much France owes to one particular Down Syndrome child: a young girl who struggled to speak, needed assistance to walk, and who died of pneumonia at the age of 20 cradled in her father\u2019s arms. Anne de Gaulle\u2019s father, however, was no ordinary man.\n\nCharles de Gaulle was surely the twentieth century\u2019s greatest Frenchman. Yet for all his achievements, the ultimate drama of de Gaulle\u2019s life was his helpless daughter. What Anne gave to him, however, was immeasurable. As de Gaulle confided to a priest at the beginning of his lonely crusade in 1940 to save France\u2019s honor, \u201cfor me, this child is a grace, she is my joy, she helps me to look beyond all the failures and honors, and always to look higher.\u201d\n\nUn enfant pas comme les autres\n\nCharles de Gaulle was an austere individual, one who consciously cultivated distance from others. 47 years after his death, however, we know much more about the private man. Thanks to the publication of memoirs, especially those of his son Admiral Philippe de Gaulle, the General emerges as a man who, like many French army officers of his background, found solace in his Catholic faith and a closely-knit family. We\u2019re also discovered that de Gaulle had a rich intellectual life which went far beyond politics. This went hand-in-hand with a wicked sense of humor which, in private, de Gaulle wasn\u2019t averse to using against himself.\n\nBy the time he reached his mid-30s, de Gaulle had settled into a milieu in which his faith, family and profession provided many of the certainties required for an ambitious man intent upon shaking up a political and military establishment committed to obsolete ideas. All this was shattered on 1 January 1928 when Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s third child was born. Within a few months, it became apparent that Anne was severely disabled.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that this was an era in which disabled children were neither seen nor heard in polite company. Down Syndrome children were referred to as \u201cmongols.\u201d Some even speculated that the condition resulted from alcoholism or some form of impropriety on the parents\u2019 part. It wasn\u2019t until 30 years after Anne de Gaulle\u2019s birth that another devout French Catholic, Professor Jerome Lejeune, and his research team discovered that Down Syndrome was caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21.\n\nIn the 1930s, it was common for French families to place disabled children permanently in hospitals that were woefully ill-equipped to care them. Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle, however, refused to send Anne to live with, as he would say, \u201cstrangers.\u201d In de Gaulle\u2019s words, \u201cGod has given her to us. We must take responsibility for her, wherever she is and whatever she will be.\u201d In a way, de Gaulle\u2019s reaction to Anne\u2019s entry into his life foreshadowed the spirit of resistance expressed in his famous appeal of 18 June 1940 to Frenchmen to continue the war against Germany.\n\nThe de Gaulles worked hard to build a place for, to use de Gaulle\u2019s expression, \u201ca child who is not like the others\u201d in their family. From all accounts, Yvonne de Gaulle adopted a matter-of-fact approach. She focused on the practicalities of caring for a disabled child. Charles de Gaulle\u2019s contribution was to envelop Anne in a web of affection. According to his son, de Gaulle wanted to give Anne the assurance that he loved her just as much as her older brother and sister\u2014that her disability meant nothing to him.\n\nThe tall army officer infamous for his air of haughty disdain as leader of Free France during World War II and later as French President didn\u2019t hesitate to unbend to play on the floor with Anne. De Gaulle sang to Anne, told her stories, and even allowed her to play with one of his most treasured possessions: his officer\u2019s kepi hat. De Gaulle also said prayers with Anne in the evening. Painstakingly, she would repeat each word after her father. \u201cYou see,\u201d de Gaulle proudly informed his relatives, \u201cshe knows her prayers!\u201d\n\nWhen away on army business, de Gaulle constantly inquired about Anne\u2019s well-being. On one occasion, Anne had an operation while he was absent on maneuvers. De Gaulle telephoned incessantly to ask if she was in pain, whether the procedure had succeeded, what the doctors were saying, etc. Anne seems to have been aware of just how much she meant to her father. Her first governess recalled that Anne adored him and would be visibly upset when his responsibilities took de Gaulle away from his family.\n\nThough the de Gaulles valued their privacy, they didn\u2019t view Anne as an embarrassment. There are pictures of her standing awkwardly with members of the de Gaulles\u2019 extended family. Most striking, however, is a photo of Anne taken at a beach in Brittany in 1933. She is sitting on her father\u2019s lap. He, dressed in a homburg hat and three-piece suit, gently holds her hands as the five year-old girl looks intensely into her father\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s an image of unconditional love.\n\nWhile Anne lived, the de Gaulles took her everywhere with them. That included less-than-hospitable locations such as the French mandate in Syria and Lebanon. De Gaulle was posted there in 1929, partly because some of his superiors wanted to sideline an officer who asked awkward questions about France\u2019s readiness for the next war. There was, however, no question of leaving Anne behind. Instead she went with them, with the de Gaulles hiring a full-time governess to help them care for Anne in a Middle-Eastern country.\n\nFragility\u2014and Resistance\u2014in the face of Evil\n\nThere was, of course, a cost to all this. Though Charles de Gaulle came from a minor aristocratic family and his wife from an upper-middle class background, the de Gaulles were not wealthy. His modest army pay was their main source of income. Hiring full-time help was subsequently an enormous financial liability, but one they didn\u2019t hesitate to assume.\n\nThen there was the psychological burden. As Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s biographer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Neau-Dufour observes, Yvonne was an exuberant, even care-free young woman before Anne was born. After Anne\u2019s birth, that woman gradually disappeared. Yvonne became a much quieter, even somewhat withdrawn person who dreaded public appearances. This, however, didn\u2019t stop her from undertaking the extremely difficult task of successfully fleeing France with the profoundly disabled Anne in tow as the German Army swept across the country in May and June 1940.\n\nThis brings into focus another factor of which Charles de Gaulle was undoubtedly aware: how the National Socialist regime treated the disabled. Eugenics was part and parcel of the Nazi view of the world (and most Western liberal opinion for decades). And, as the Nazis made clear right from the beginning, the disabled had no place in a National Socialist world. They were lebensunwertes leben (life unworthy of life).\n\nStarting in September 1939, the Nazi government began removing Down Syndrome children and infants suffering from other disabilities from their parents. These children were taken to \u201chealth facilities\u201d and killed by lethal injection or gas poisoning. In the name of \u201cracial health\u201d and other eugenics nonsense, the regime murdered thousands of disabled children. Among them was a 15 year-old Down Syndrome cousin of the future pope, Joseph Ratzinger.\n\nThis would have been Anne de Gaulle\u2019s fate if she had ever fallen into Nazi hands. Although de Gaulle never referenced it specifically, it\u2019s likely that the brutal treatment of the disabled was one of the things he had in mind when referring to the evil of the Nazi regime. When de Gaulle refused to surrender in 1940 and was branded a traitor by France\u2019s political and military elites, it was certainly the act of an intensely patriotic man unwilling to accept his country\u2019s abasement by the Nazis. But de Gaulle\u2019s act of resistance also concerned safeguarding his defenseless daughter from those who viewed her as sub-human.\n\nLife after Death\n\nLike many Down Syndrome children, Anne de Gaulle died at an early age. Her brother Philippe recollects arriving at his parents\u2019 house in 1948 to find the entire residence immersed in silence. Noone, he writes, dared to say anything to his grief-stricken father. Anne was subsequently buried in the cemetery at the de Gaulles\u2019 parish church in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. After attending their regular Sunday Mass and always on the anniversary of her death, Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle would visit Anne\u2019s grave. 22 years after she died, her father was laid to rest beside Anne. Her mother joined them in 1979.\n\nThat, however, wasn\u2019t the end of the story. Back in October 1945, the de Gaulles raised enough money from private donors to buy the chateau de Vert-C\u0153ur in the department of Yvelines, not far from Paris. They then began creating a home for intellectually disabled girls. A few months after Anne\u2019s death, the Fondation Anne-de-Gaulle opened its doors at the chateau. Staffed by nuns, funded by the considerable royalties generated by de Gaulle\u2019s memoirs, and presided over by Yvonne de Gaulle until her death, the Foundation continues to serve the disabled today.\n\nOne of Charles de Gaulle\u2019s biographers, the late Jean Lacouture, records him as once saying, \u201cWithout Anne, I could never perhaps have done what I did. She gave me the heart and the inspiration.\u201d In that sense, the man of June 18 and his beloved pauvre petiteAnne teach us something which we are tempted to forget\u2014that all of us can find strength in weakness and that nothing is more powerful than self-giving love."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/de-gaulle-yvonne-1900-1979", "page_content": "de Gaulle, Yvonne (1900\u20131979)\n\nFrench first lady who went into exile with her husband Charles de Gaulle when he headed the Free French resistance during WWII and was, in her later years, affectionately known in France as \"Tante Yvonne\" (Aunt Yvonne).

Born Yvonne Charlotte Anne-Marie Vendroux (pronunciation: Vahn-DROO) on May 22, 1900, in the family home in Calais, on the Channel coast of France; died on November 8, 1979, in the military hospital Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce, Paris; daughter of Jacques Vendroux (the head of a biscuit manufacturing company) and Marguerite (Forest) Vendroux; received primary and secondary education largely with private tutors at home; spent several years at a primary school, Notre-Dame in Calais; married Charles de Gaulle, on April 7, 1921 (a civil ceremony took place the previous day but it was the religious ceremony held April 7 that was regarded as their wedding by the de Gaulles); children: Philippe (b. December 28, 1921); Elisabeth de Boissieu (b. May 15, 1924); Anne de Gaulle (January 1, 1928\u2013February 6, 1948).\n\nChildhood years spent in family home in Calais; at age five, began primary education with private tutors (1905); as German forces advanced toward Calais at outset of WWI, Vendroux family took refuge in England (July\u2013August 1914); family returned to Calais (December 1914); cared for war wounded in Calais (1915\u201316); left Calais, under threat of German bombs, for safety in Paris (1916); as renewed German offensive threatened Paris (March 1918), sent out of harm's way to Mortagne, Brittany, then Perigueux (summer and autumn, 1918); worked with mother among the wounded war veterans in Calais (1919\u201320); met Charles de Gaulle (October 1920); after marriage, lived together in Paris (1921); moved with Charles, who was promoted to major and placed in charge of 19th Battalion of Light Infantry in Trier, Germany (1927); moved with family to Beirut (then in Syria, a French mandate of the League of Nations, now Lebanon), where Charles was posted (1929); returned to Paris (1931); purchased La Boisserie, an estate in the village of Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises, in the Haute-Marne department in eastern France (June 9, 1934); based in Metz where Charles commanded the 507th Tank Regiment (1937); outbreak of WWII (September 1, 1939); Germans entered Paris (June 14, 1940); de Gaulle family left France for London (June 17) where Charles' first BBC radio broadcast back to France called for resistance against Germany (June 18); moved to join Charles in liberated Algiers (July 1943); Allied invasion of Normandy (June 6, 1944); rejoined Charles, now head of the Provisional Government, in Neuilly, near Paris (September 1944); Charles resigned as head of the Provisional Government (January, 1946); moved back into La Boisserie(May 1946); death of daughter Anne, caused by pneumonia (February 6, 1948); returned to Paris with re-call of Charles to power during Algerian crisis (June 1, 1958); became \"first lady\" of France upon the inauguration of Charles as first president of the Fifth Republic (January 8, 1959); narrowly survived an assassination attempt in the company of her husband (August 22, 1962); retired to La Boisserie after referendum defeat of de Gaulle (April 1969); death of Charles de Gaulle (November 9, 1970).\n\nOn August 22, 1962, in the Paris suburb of Petit-Clamart, en route from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace to the town of Villacoublay, the French presidential car was ambushed by a commando who fired some 150 shots from automatic weapons. Fourteen bullets struck the car in which Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle, their son-in-law Alain de Boissieu, and the driver Francis Marroux were riding, on their way for a weekend at the presidential retreat in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. No one was hit. The Petit-Clamart attack was but the closest call in a series of assassination attempts by groups opposed to Charles de Gaulle's ceding of independence to the rebellious colony of Algeria. The general, at least according to some accounts, had been too proud even to drop to the floor during the fusillade, and, even though a bullet passed between their heads, Yvonne de Gaulle had also remained seated erect during the attack. Upon their arrival at Villacoublay, the general turned to his wife and said: \"Yvonne, you are brave.\"\n\nYvonne de Gaulle's behavior during and after the Petit-Clamart assassination attempt typified the stoicism, courage, and fidelity that characterized her entire adult life and for which she is remembered in France. Years after her death, President Richard Nixon remembered her having said in 1969, \"the presidency is temporary, the family permanent.\" The product of a middle-class Catholic family from Calais, in Normandy, Yvonne de Gaulle exemplified the \"dutiful wife and mother,\" silent in public but influential behind the scenes. Deeply religious and private, she kept to herself whatever complaints she might have had living with the self-assured and frequently cantankerous Charles de Gaulle. She lived so privately that, even as first lady in France during the 1960s, she was able to shop in Parisian stores without being recognized. Although her role came increasingly into question in the France of the 1960s, she nonetheless came to be respected in France as \"Tante Yvonne\" (Aunt Yvonne), during the presidency of her husband.\n\nThe daughter of Jacques and Marguerite Vendroux , Yvonne Vendroux was born on May 22, 1900, in the family home in Calais, on the Channel coast of France. Her father, who had gone into the biscuit-producing business, came from a long line of shipowners and local mayors and was himself vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, a municipal councilor, and the honorary consul of several foreign countries. He was, in French terms, a \"notable,\" or local dignitary. His family, the Van Droog, tobacco producers, had moved in the late 17th century from Delft in Holland to Dunkirk, where the name was changed to Vandroux; later the family moved to Calais, where the name was changed to Vendroux. Yvonne's mother, Marguerite Forest Vendroux, was the granddaughter of a well-known notary of the town of Charleville.\n\nMadame de Gaulle's importance was considerable not for what she said or did but for what she neither did nor said, by her silent presence. \u2014Andr\u00e9 Malraux\n\nYvonne Vendroux had a happy and stable childhood. Raised amid comfortable circumstances, the second of four children, she spent her early years with her family, in Calais in the winter and in a country estate in the Ardennes during the summer, where she went mountain climbing and developed a lifelong love of nature, especially flowers. Most of her schooling took place in the form of home tutoring. Dubious about the quality of the local schools after the 1905 separation of church and state in France, Yvonne's parents hired a tutor, Mademoiselle Delannoy , for her primary education. After 1907, she was sent for awhile as a day student to the local Notre-Dame boarding school, but her parents retained the tutor to supplement their daughter's education. Her secondary school education took place entirely at home.\n\nYvonne's first communion, in 1911, was followed by three relatively carefree years, broken with the onset of World War I in August 1914. As German forces advanced toward Calais and bombs fell on the town early in the war, the Vendroux family took refuge in Kent, in southern England. By the end of 1914, when it had become clear that the French forces would hold and Calais would be safe from German invasion, the Vendroux family returned. There, Yvonne's activities continued to revolve around the home as her mother cared for wounded war veterans. In 1916, seeking greater security, the family again left Calais for Paris, where Yvonne remained until March 1918, when a renewed German offensive led the family to send her and her sister Suzanne to Brittany. Now 18, Yvonne next went to Perigueux, where she spent the final days of World War I. With the end of the war, the Vendroux family turned to the restoration of their various properties in the Calais and Ardennes areas. Yvonne assumed an increasing role in household management, allowing her mother to continue to work in veterans' hospitals. Her older brother Jacques accompanied her as chaperon to the parties and balls in Paris and Calais. Yvonne soon joined her mother working among the war wounded, widows, and orphans.\n\nIn October 1920, at a tea arranged by family friends, Yvonne met Captain Charles de Gaulle, then on a brief leave from service with the French military mission in Poland. Shortly thereafter, he invited her to a ball at Saint-Cyr, the French military academy. Taken with Charles, Yvonne accepted and went in the company of Jacques. A few days later, asked directly about her feelings toward Charles, Yvonne replied, \"It will be he or no one.\" The families met, and the couple was officially affianced on November 11, 1920. Charles had to return for two additional months' service in Poland, then returned to France in February. He was named professor of history at Saint-Cyr, a post that would keep him in Paris.\n\nYvonne Vendroux and Charles de Gaulle were married in a civil ceremony in Calais on April 6, 1921, and in a religious ceremony the next day at the Notre-Dame Church in that city. Following their marriage, the young couple settled in a modest Paris apartment and lived a relatively quiet life. Their son Philippe was born at the end of 1921. In 1924, their second child, Elizabeth, was born. Charles finished his studies at the War College, published his first book, La Discorde chez l'Ennemi (Discord in the Enemy), and was posted as an officer working with Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain, the hero of World War I, with whose career his own would be dramatically crossed. In 1927, Yvonne de Gaulle joined her husband in a posting in Trier, Germany, where in 1928, their daughter Anne was born. Within months of Anne's birth, it had become clear that she was suffering from Down's syndrome. Anne was never to speak well or eat or dress unaided. Her illness was the great personal tragedy of the de Gaulles who cared for her tenderly.\n\nIn 1929, the de Gaulles were sent to Beirut, Lebanon, then part of French-controlled Syria, where they remained until 1931. In 1932, Yvonne's father died; her mother died the following year. At the end of 1933, Charles de Gaulle was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In June 1934, the de Gaulles bought \"La Boisserie,\" the estate of Yvonne's late parents, located in the village of Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises, in the gently rolling hills of the Haute-Marne department about midway between Paris and France's eastern frontier. The year 1934 also saw the publication of Charles' second book, Vers l'arm\u00e9e de m\u00e9tier (The Army of the Future), which argued, to little avail, that the French should adopt new mechanized forms of warfare. In 1937, Charles was given the command of the 507th Tank Regiment based in Metz. Life for the de Gaulle family revolved quietly around Paris, Metz, and La Boisserie.\n\nYvonne's domain was the family home at La Boisserie, her place of refuge from the turbulent political affairs surrounding her husband. She quietly endured the tragedy of Anne's disabilities while living with a man who was very much a lone rebel in political and military circles during the 1930s, and who clearly ruled as master of the household. Known for his arrogance, Charles was said to be a tyrant at home, with Yvonne silently bearing the brunt of his disappointment and frustration. Charles dominated conversations; Yvonne was told plainly, and sometimes publicly, that her opinion did not count. On more than one occasion Charles was observed telling his wife to be silent, that she could not possibly know anything about politics. Years later, an acquaintance said that compared to the cheerful if somewhat reticent young woman who had married Charles in 1921, the Yvonne of the late 1930s was profoundly sad.\n\nThe outbreak of war with Nazi Germany in September 1939 found Charles in command of his tank regiment. Poland was quickly crushed by the Germans, but the war with France involved little actual fighting in what became known as the dr\u00f4le de guerre, or phony war. This changed with the German thrust westward of May 10, 1940. The force of the German onslaught was such that, within days, Charles was writing from the front to Yvonne at La Boisserie, warning her to be ready for quick flight in the event that the military situation turned disastrous. On June 1, Charles was promoted to brigadier-general. Five days later, he was appointed undersecretary of state for National Defense and War by Premier Paul Reynaud. The Germans entered Paris on June 14. On June 16, the Reynaud government was replaced by one headed by Marshal P\u00e9tain, who was committed to seeking peace with the Germans. A day later, Yvonne with her three children and their governess left for England to join her husband, a political exile.\n\nFor the second time in her life, Yvonne de Gaulle experienced wartime exile in England. On June 18, Charles broadcast back to France, calling on the entire nation to resist the Germans and any French authority that supported collaboration with them. In London, their son Philippe, then 18 years old, joined the newly created Free French Navy in July. In addition to the occupation of her homeland, Yvonne had to accept the fact that her husband was now a rebel, standing almost alone against his country's legal government, which was headed by World War I hero and his own former sponsor, Marshal P\u00e9tain. Moreover, P\u00e9tain sentenced Charles to death in absentia for wartime desertion and treason. Yvonne set up a household in London as he organized what became the Free French resistance to Nazi Germany and the government of Vichy France. Whatever his other activities in wartime London, Charles was invariably present to tell Anne stories at her bedtime and to shield her from the press.\n\nTogether with other Londoners, Yvonne endured the German Blitz or air raids in the summer and fall of 1940, but ultimately her faith in her husband's vision was rewarded; the fortunes of war turned with the entry of the Soviet Union and the United States into combat against the Nazis. Following the liberation of French North Africa, the de Gaulle family returned to Algiers in June 1943. The liberation of metropolitan France, which began with the D-Day landings in Normandy, June 6, 1944, left the country under the Free French, reorganized as a Provisional Government and headed by Charles de Gaulle. In late August, Paris was liberated and by the end of September, almost all of metropolitan France had been cleared of Germans. Yvonne, now the wife of the leader of the Provisional Government, returned home to supervise the reconstruction of La Boisserie, which had been pillaged and partially burned during the Occupation. Charles, however, became increasingly dispirited as the politicians who had dominated prewar politics and, in his view, had brought on the catastrophe of 1940, regained strength, promising to recreate what he called the \"regime of parties.\" On January 3, 1946, a few weeks after the marriage of daughter Elisabeth to Commander Alain de Boissieu, Charles abruptly resigned his position. The family lived until May in an uncomfortable house rented from the government while La Boisserie was being restored and Charles waited restlessly to be recalled to power.\n\nIn 1946, with the help of Georges Pompidou, who later served as one of Charles' prime ministers and was to become his successor as president, the de Gaulles established the Anne de Gaulle Foundation to help handicapped girls. The Foundation was to care for Anne in the event that her parents predeceased her. Supported financially by the income from Charles' books, the Foundation built a house on a wooded hill in the Chevreuse valley. Staffed by six nuns and a mother superior, the house eventually provided for some 40 handicapped girls. Yvonne helped select them.\n\nIn April 1947, Charles created the Rassemblement du Peuple Fran\u00e7ais (Rally of the French People), a political party that was to serve as a vehicle for his return to power. Then, on February 6, 1948, Anne died of bronchial pneumonia at age 20. With the death of Anne, the Anne de Gaulle Foundation occupied much of Yvonne's attention. She also accompanied Charles throughout France as he campaigned for his new RPF, but by 1952, the party was fading and he ended it the next year. These years were spent, often with their grandchildren, at La Boisserie where Charles worked on his memoirs, with occasional trips abroad where he was received as the hero of the wartime French Resistance. To visitors at La Boisserie, Yvonne occasionally expressed the desire to protect her husband \"for history,\" and keep him out of politics. The tranquil life was interrupted, however, when the government's inability to suppress the Algerian rebellion led to rioting by European Algerians in the streets of Algiers on May 13, 1958. La Boisserie was quickly turned into a command post as Charles and his advisors planned his return to office. On June 1, Charles de Gaulle was voted in as premier by the National Assembly with full powers to write a new constitution for France. The result was France's Fifth Republic, with a much stronger presidency, filled in 1959 by Charles de Gaulle.\n\nOnce again, Yvonne de Gaulle was a reluctant first lady of France. During the early 1960s, Charles survived several assassination attempts by opponents of independence for Algeria. The closest call was the Petit-Clamart fusillade in 1962. Profiting by the wave of sympathy engendered by the assassination attempt, Charles proposed a constitutional change to elect the president by universal suffrage, which was approved by popular referendum in October. In 1965, against Yvonne's will, he stood as a candidate for the presidency. Forced into a runoff with Socialist candidate Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, Charles was elected in the second round to a seven-year term.\n\nTo many in 1960s France, \"Aunt Yvonne\" came to represent the wife of a previous era. She accompanied Charles to innumerable Paris Opera galas, where she sat through close to 30 performances of \"Carmen,\" and hosted the Kennedys, Khrushchevs, and many other world leaders. The comparison of the prim and somewhat dowdy Yvonne, who scrupulously supervised the household affairs of France's presidential \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, with the youthful and fashionable Jacqueline Kennedy , who accompanied her husband, then president of the United States, on a visit to Paris in 1961, was played out in the international press. Wearing sedate black, gray, or mauve dresses designed by Paris couturier Jacques Heim, Yvonne avoided d\u00e9colletage and shunned the more up-to-date fashions of Coco Chanel . Yvonne's successor as France's first lady, Claude Pompidou , recalled later that Yvonne's only advice to her had been to wear hats. Yvonne arranged the floral decorations of the palace, and she loved to travel and accompany her husband on all his official trips abroad, but whenever possible, she returned\n\nto La Boisserie and the gardens that were her favorite pastime.\n\nA strict Catholic, Yvonne set an austere tone at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, making sure the private lives of those in her husband's entourage passed moral muster. Exerting a considerable, if private, influence, she saw to it that divorcees were weeded out of influential positions and excluded from presidential social functions. She was equally severe in her judgments of much of the literature and film of the 1960s and carefully scrutinized the selection of films to be shown in the palace. For her religious devotions, she had a special chapel built inside the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nYvonne was with Charles when, during the height of the student and worker unrest of May 1968, he traveled to Baden-Baden to consult with French generals about the possibility of his resigning. She shared his disappointment, when, in April 1969, in a referendum he had called on behalf of decentralizing political reforms, he was defeated. Having staked his political prestige on the referendum, Charles immediately resigned. The couple returned to La Boisserie, where on November 9, 1970, Charles died. Yvonne continued to live there, where she cooked, knitted, and tended her garden, visited often by her children and four grandchildren until the fall of 1978, when she withdrew to the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception convent in Paris. In July 1979, she was operated on in Paris for an intestinal obstruction. Readmitted to a Paris military hospital, she died November 8, 1979. She was buried beside Charles and Anne at the church cemetery in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. Surviving Yvonne, in addition to her son Philippe and daughter Elisabeth, were her grandchildren and one great-grandson. Mourned as the symbol of moral rectitude and marital fidelity of a long gone era, \"Tante Yvonne\" was called the \"minister of common sense\" in the government of General Charles de Gaulle. Following her death, La Boisserie, which remained in the possession of Philippe, was converted into a museum, open to the public, in honor of the de Gaulles.\n\nsources:\n\nB\u00e9liard, Jean. \"Entretien avec Richard Nixon,\" in Institut Charles de Gaulle.

Charles de Gaulle led the Free French forces in resisting capitulation to Germany during World War II and became provisional president of France in the immediate aftermath of the war. Later he was an architect of the Fifth Republic and was president from 1959 to 1969. When did Charles de Gaulle become famous? Charles de Gaulle was undersecretary of state for defense and war when Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain took over the government of France with the intention of signing an armistice with Adolf Hitler. De Gaulle left for London, where, on June 18, 1940, he broadcast an appeal to his countrymen to continue to fight under his leadership. What were Charles de Gaulle\u2019s policies as president of France? Charles de Gaulle was determined that France should be treated as one of the great powers and not fall under the sway of any other country, particularly the United States. To that end, he made France a nuclear power, withdrew France from the military command of NATO, and followed his own views on foreign policy. When did Charles de Gaulle lose power? Charles de Gaulle lost power twice. He resigned as provisional president in 1946 because he opposed political parties forming the Fourth Republic, and, when his own movement failed to gain a majority, he retired from politics in 1953. The second time, voters rejected his proposed reforms, and he resigned as president in 1969.\n\nCharles de Gaulle, in full Charles Andr\u00e9 Joseph Marie de Gaulle, (born November 22, 1890, Lille, France\u2014died November 9, 1970, Colombey-les-deux-\u00c9glises), French soldier, writer, statesman, and architect of France\u2019s Fifth Republic.\n\nEducation and early career De Gaulle was the second son of a Roman Catholic, patriotic, and nationalist upper-middle-class family. The family had produced historians and writers, and his father taught philosophy and literature; but, as a boy, de Gaulle already showed a passionate interest in military matters. He attended the Military Academy of Saint-Cyr, and in 1913, as a young second lieutenant, he joined an infantry regiment commanded by Colonel Philippe P\u00e9tain. De Gaulle was an intelligent, hardworking, and zealous young soldier and, in his military career, a man of original mind, great self-assurance, and outstanding courage. In World War I he fought at Verdun, was three times wounded and three times mentioned in dispatches, and spent two years and eight months as a prisoner of war (during which time he made five unsuccessful attempts to escape). After a brief visit to Poland as a member of a military mission, a year\u2019s teaching at Saint-Cyr, and a two-year course of special training in strategy and tactics at the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure de Guerre (War College), he was promoted by Marshal P\u00e9tain in 1925 to the staff of the Supreme War Council. From 1927 to 1929 de Gaulle served as a major in the army occupying the Rhineland and could see for himself both the potential danger of German aggression and the inadequacy of the French defense. He also spent two years in the Middle East and then, having been promoted to lieutenant colonel, spent four years as a member of the secretariat of the National Defense Council. De Gaulle\u2019s writing career began with a study of the relations between the civil and military powers in Germany (La Discorde chez l\u2019ennemi, 1924; \u201cDiscord Among the Enemy\u201d), followed by lectures on his conception of leadership, Le Fil de l\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9e (1932; The Edge of the Sword). A study on military theory, Vers l\u2019arm\u00e9e de m\u00e9tier (1934; The Army of the Future), defended the idea of a small professional army, highly mechanized and mobile, in preference to the static theories exemplified by the Maginot Line, which was intended to protect France against German attack. He also wrote a memorandum in which he tried, even as late as January 1940, to convert politicians to his way of thinking. His views made him unpopular with his military superiors, and the question of his right to publish under his name a historical study, La France et son arm\u00e9e (1938; France and Her Army), led to a dispute with Marshal P\u00e9tain. Britannica Quiz Pop Quiz: 17 Things to Know About World War II\n\nWorld War II At the outbreak of World War II, de Gaulle commanded a tank brigade attached to the French Fifth Army. In May 1940, after assuming command as temporary brigadier general in the 4th Armoured Division\u2014the rank that he retained for the rest of his life\u2014he twice had the opportunity to apply his theories on tank warfare. He was mentioned as \u201can admirable, energetic, and courageous leader.\u201d On June 6 he entered the government of Paul Reynaud as undersecretary of state for defense and war, and he undertook several missions to England to explore the possibilities of continuing the war. When the Reynaud government was replaced 10 days later by that of Marshal P\u00e9tain, who intended to seek an armistice with the Germans, de Gaulle left for England. On June 18 he broadcast from London his first appeal to his compatriots to continue the war under his leadership. On August 2, 1940, a French military court tried and sentenced him in absentia to death, deprivation of military rank, and confiscation of property. De Gaulle entered his wartime career as a political leader with tremendous liabilities. He had only a handful of haphazardly recruited political supporters and volunteers for what were to become the Free French Forces. He had no political status and was virtually unknown in both Britain and France. But he had an absolute belief in his mission and a conviction that he possessed the qualities of leadership. He was totally devoted to France and had the strength of character (or obstinacy, as it often appeared to the British) to fight for French interests as he saw them with all the resources at his disposal.

Broadcasts from London, the action of the Free French Forces, and the contacts of resistance groups in France either with de Gaulle\u2019s own organization or with those of the British secret services brought national recognition of his leadership; but full recognition by his allies came only after the liberation of Paris in August 1944.

He was raised there and in Paris. He died of a ruptured blood vessel in 1970 at the age of 79.\n\nDe Gaulle came from a devout Catholic family whose parents lamented the lack of religion in the French government. Educated in Catholic schools, de Gaulle was nothing less than completely devout his whole life. He didn\u2019t speak of his faith very frequently, but there\u2019s no doubt of its importance.\n\nThroughout his dynamic life, the Catholic church was a comfort and a place of stability. About his love of Catholic ceremony he said,\n\nMass is the ceremony I most favor during my travels. Church is the only place where someone speaks to me and I do not have to answer back.\n\nAfter his beloved daughter Anne died of pneumonia at the age of 20, de Gaulle was consoled by the belief that she was looking on from heaven.

May little Anne protect us from on high.\n\nAlthough de Gaulle\u2019s love of France was deeply entwined with its Catholic heritage, he remained committed to secular government. His religion, however, is only a small part of his immense legacy in France and through the world.\n\nDefining France\n\nDe Gaulle, a top member of the French military during World War II, refused to accept his country\u2019s surrender to the Nazis. He instead retreated to England and declared himself the leader of the Free French Forces, which joined the Allies in their eventual defeat of Germany. After presiding over France\u2019s interim post-war government, he resigned in 1946 to protest the constitution\u2019s lack of a strong executive power. Political instability plagued the country in de Gaulle\u2019s absence. He assumed emergency powers in 1958 while a new constitution was written, and spent the next ten years as president of France\u2019s new government.\n\nGaullism is marked by three major tenets: a powerful executive, heavy involvement of the state in the economy, and complete independence in foreign policy. It is that last tenet that is perhaps de Gaulle\u2019s most enduring legacy. He said,\n\nNo nation has friends, only interests.\n\nIt was this belief that caused the Frenchman to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) because he believed it was overly dominated by the U.S. and U.K. And although he supported a united Europe, he fought the U.K.'s entrance into the European Economic Community because he believed it was too cozy with the U.S.\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s legacy in American and British memory isn\u2019t too favorable.

But he remains a hero among both the left and the right in France and across the world."}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/political-figures/charles-de-gaulle", "page_content": "(1890-1970)\n\nWho Was Charles de Gaulle?\n\nCharles de Gaulle rose from French soldier in World War I to exiled leader and, eventually, president of the Fifth Republic, a position he held until 1969. De Gaulle's time as a commander in World War II would later influence his political career, providing him with a tenacious drive. His time as president was marked by the student and worker uprisings in 1968, which he responded to with an appeal for civil order.\n\nEarly Life and Military Career\n\nThe son of a philosophy and literature professor, famed French leader de Gaulle was born on November 22, 1890, into a patriotic and devoutly Catholic family. De Gaulle was a well-educated and well-read child. Early on, he dreamed of being a military leader. He enrolled at the country's top military academy, Saint-Cyr, in 1909. In 1912 he completed his studies and joined an infantry regiment that was commanded by Colonel Philippe P\u00e9tain, serving as a lieutenant.\n\nDuring World War I, de Gaulle distinguished himself on the battlefield. He was wounded twice early on, and received a medal for his service. Promoted to captain, de Gaulle fought in one of the war's most deadly confrontations \u2014 the Battle of Verdun \u2014 in 1916. During the fight, he was injured and, subsequently, taken prisoner. After several failed escape attempts, de Gaulle was freed at the end of the war.\n\nA bright and skilled soldier, de Gaulle enrolled in a special training program at the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure de Guerre after the war. He later worked with P\u00e9tain and served on France's Supreme War Council. Gaining some international experience, de Gaulle spent time in Germany and the Middle East.\n\nAlso an insightful writer, de Gaulle explored a number of military issues in his books. He published his examination of Germany, La Discorde chez l'ennemi, in 1924. Another important book was Vers l'arm\u00e9e de m\u00e9tier (1932), in which he made suggestions for creating a better army. This critical work was largely ignored by French military officials, but not by the Germans. According to some reports, the German military followed some of de Gaulle's recommendations in World War II. He and his mentor, Petain, had a falling out over another book, a military history piece entitled La France et son arm\u00e9e (1938).\n\nWorld War II\n\nAt the time fighting broke out between Germany and France, de Gaulle was leading a tank brigade. He was temporarily appointed the brigadier general of the 4th Armored Division in May 1940. Continuing to rise up professionally, de Gaulle became the undersecretary for defense and war for French leader Paul Reynaud that June. A short while later, Reynaud was replaced by P\u00e9tain. P\u00e9tain's new government, sometimes called the Vichy government, worked out a deal with Germany to avoid further bloodshed. The Vichy regime became infamous for collaborating with the Nazis.\n\nA dedicated patriot, de Gaulle did not accept France's surrender to Germany in 1940. He instead fled to England, where he became a leader of the Free French movement, with the support of British prime minister Winston Churchill. From London, de Gaulle broadcast a message across the English Channel to his countrymen, calling for them to continue to resist the German occupation. He also organized soldiers from French colonies to fight alongside the allied troops.\n\n\"Whatever happens, the flame of French resistance must not and shall not die.\" - Charles du Gaulle, June 18 1940\n\nDe Gaulle sometimes irritated other allied leaders with his demands and perceived arrogance. American President Franklin D. Roosevelt reportedly could not stand him. In fact, at the war's end, de Gaulle was purposely left out of the Yalta Conference, as Germany negotiated its surrender. He did, however, secure his nation an occupation zone in Germany and a seat on the United Nation's Security Council. De Gaulle enjoyed wide support at home and, in 1945, became president of France's provisional government. In a dispute over greater power for the country's executive branch, de Gaulle resigned this post.\n\nFor several years, de Gaulle led his own political movement, \"Rally for the French People,\" which did not gain much momentum. He retired from politics in 1953 before returning to become president of the country in 1959.\n\nPresident of the Fifth Republic\n\nThe French government, known as the Fourth Republic, began to crumble in the late 1950s, and de Gaulle once again returned to public service to help his country. He helped form the country's next government, becoming its president in January 1959. Establishing France's Fifth Republic, de Gaulle dedicated himself to improving the country's economic situation and maintaining its independence. He sought to keep France separate from the two superpowers \u2014 the United States and the Soviet Union. To show France's military relevance, de Gaulle successfully campaigned for the country to press on with its nuclear weapons program.\n\nDe Gaulle was not afraid to make controversial decisions. After coping with uprisings in Algeria for years, he helped the French colony achieve independence in 1962. This move was not widely popular at the time. De Gaulle supported the idea of a united Europe, but he wanted Europe to be free from the superpowers' influences. He fought to keep Britain out of the European Economic Community because of its close ties to the United States. In 1966, de Gaulle also pulled his country's forces out of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), acting again on his concerns with the United States. To some, de Gaulle came off as anti-American. Though he may have been, to some extent, his actions seemed to truly reflect his deep nationalistic views.\n\nSometimes inflexible and intractable, de Gaulle nearly saw his government toppled by student and worker protests in 1968. He managed to restore order to the country, but left power soon after, following a battle over political and economic reforms. In April 1969, de Gaulle resigned from the presidency.\n\nDeath and Legacy\n\nAfter his resignation, de Gaulle retired to his home in Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises. He had little time to enjoy the quiet life of this village, as he died of a heart attack on November 9, 1970. French President George Pompidou, who had worked closely with de Gaulle before succeeding him, delivered the terrible news to the public, saying \"General de Gaulle is dead. France is a widow.\" France mourned the loss of its famous statesman and military leader; the country had lost one of its greatest heroes \u2014 a hero who had seen his people through war, and proved to be instrumental in his country's recovery.\n\nOther world leaders offered up words of praise for de Gaulle. Queen Elizabeth II said that his \"courage and tenacity in the allied cause during the dark years of the Second World War will never be forgotten.\" Two American presidents, Lyndon B. Johnson and Harry S. Truman, also sent their condolences to the people of France. President Richard Nixon was among the foreign dignitaries who attended a special service for de Gaulle, held shortly after his death, at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nDe Gaulle married Yvonne Vendroux in 1921 and together, they had three children: Philippe (born in 1921, and who later became a French admiral and senator), \u00c9lisabeth (1924-2013) and Anne (1928-1948).\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Charles de Gaulle\n\nBirth Year: 1890\n\nBirth date: November 22, 1890\n\nBirth City: Lille\n\nBirth Country: France\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Charles de Gaulle rose from French soldier in World War I to exiled leader and, eventually, president of the Fifth Republic.

Led by General Charles de Gaulle, the Free French were eventually able to unify most French resistance forces in their struggle against Germany.\n\nOn June 16, 1940, the government of France was constitutionally transmitted to Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain, who had already decided that France must conclude an armistice with Germany. Two days later, a French army officer, General Charles de Gaulle, appealed by radio from London (whence he had fled on June 17) for a French continuation of the war against Germany. On June 28 de Gaulle was recognized by the British as the leader of Free France (as the nascent resistance movement was named), and from his base in London de Gaulle began to build up the Forces Fran\u00e7aises Libres, or Free French Forces. At first these consisted merely of French troops in England, volunteers from the French community resident in England since prewar times, and a few units of the French navy.\n\nBritannica Quiz Pop Quiz: 17 Things to Know About World War II\n\nIn the autumn of 1940 the French colonial territories of Chad, Cameroun, Moyen-Congo, French Equatorial Africa, and Oubangi-Chari (all in sub-Saharan Africa) rallied to de Gaulle\u2019s Free France, and the smaller French colonies in India and in the Pacific soon followed suit. A Free French military expedition in September 1940 to capture the important naval base of Dakar in French West Africa failed, however, and the base remained in the hands of French forces loyal to the national government that P\u00e9tain had set up in Vichy.\n\nIn 1941 Free French forces participated in British-controlled operations against Italian forces in Libya and Egypt, and that same year they joined the British in defeating the Vichy forces in Syria and Lebanon. In September de Gaulle created the Comit\u00e9 National Fran\u00e7ais (French National Committee), a Free French government-in-exile that was recognized by the Allied governments.\n\nDespite these gains, the Free French remained a small force until 1942, by which time an underground anti-Nazi R\u00e9sistance movement had sprung up in France. In his efforts to obtain the support of the R\u00e9sistance, de Gaulle changed the name of his movement to Forces Fran\u00e7aises Combattantes (Fighting French Forces) and sent his emissary Jean Moulin to France to try to unify all the various R\u00e9sistance groups in France under de Gaulle\u2019s leadership. Moulin came close to accomplishing this in May 1943 with his establishment of the Conseil Nationale de la R\u00e9sistance (National Council of the Resistance).\n\nThe successful Anglo-American invasion of northwestern Africa in November 1942 resulted in the defection of most of the Vichy troops stationed there to the side of the Free French. De Gaulle then entered a power struggle with the Allied-backed commander in chief of the French forces in North Africa, General Henri Giraud. In June 1943 a Comit\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ais de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale (French Committee of National Liberation) was constituted in Algiers, with Giraud and de Gaulle as its joint presidents. But de Gaulle soon outmaneuvered Giraud, whose resignation in the spring of 1944 left de Gaulle in supreme control of the entire French war effort outside of Metropolitan France. More and more R\u00e9sistance groups were meanwhile acknowledging de Gaulle\u2019s leadership.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

They were almost wholly American-equipped and supplied. In August 1944 the Free French 1st Army, under General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, took part in the Allies\u2019 invasion of southern France, driving thence northeastward into Alsace before joining in the Western Allies\u2019 final thrust into Germany. In August 1944 the R\u00e9sistance groups, now organized as Forces Fran\u00e7aises de l\u2019Int\u00e9rieur (French Forces of the Interior), mounted an anti-German insurrection in Paris, and the Free French 2nd Armoured Division under General Jacques-Philippe Leclerc drove into Paris to consummate the liberation.

Within weeks of the 1940 collapse, tiny groups of men and women had begun to resist. Some collected military intelligence for transmission to London; some organized escape routes for British airmen who had been shot down; some circulated anti-German leaflets; some engaged in sabotage of railways and German installations. The Resistance movement received an important infusion of strength in June 1941, when Hitler\u2019s attack on the Soviet Union brought the French Communist Party into active participation in the anti-German struggle. It was further reinforced by the German decision to conscript French workers; many draftees took to the hills and joined guerrilla bands that took the name Maquis (meaning \u201cunderbrush\u201d). A kind of national unity was finally achieved in May 1943, when de Gaulle\u2019s personal representative, Jean Moulin, succeeded in establishing a National Resistance Council (Conseil National de la R\u00e9sistance) that joined all the major movements into one federation.\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s original call for resistance had attracted only a handful of French citizens who happened to be in Britain at the time. But, as the British continued to fight, a trickle of volunteers from France began to find its way to his headquarters in London. De Gaulle promptly established an organization called Free France and in 1941 capped it with a body called the French National Committee (Comit\u00e9 National Fran\u00e7ais), for which he boldly claimed the status of a legal government-in-exile. During the next three years, first in London and then (after 1943) in Algiers, he insisted on his right to speak for France and on France\u2019s right to be heard as a Great Power in the councils of the Allies. His demands and his manner irked Churchill and Roosevelt and caused persistent tension. The U.S. government unsuccessfully attempted in 1942 to sidetrack him in favour of General Henri Giraud, who immediately after the Allied landings in North Africa was brought out of France to command the French armies in liberated North Africa and to assume a political role as well. De Gaulle arrived in Algiers in May 1943 and joined Giraud as copresident of a new French Committee of National Liberation. By the end of the year he had outmaneuvered Giraud and emerged as the unchallenged spokesman for French resisters everywhere. Even the Communists in 1943 grudgingly accepted his leadership."}, {"url": "https://www.thelocal.fr/20201110/forgotten-history-the-women-who-fought-in-the-french-resistance", "page_content": "Advertisement\n\nThey did not yet have the right to vote, but women in France played a key part in weakening the enemy from within during the Nazi occupation from 1940-44.\n\nYet, their stories have gone largely untold.\n\n\"These women have really gone under the radar,\" said Anne Sebba, a British author whose book Les Parisiennes, published in 2018, traces the lives and battles of female Resistance fighters in the French capital during World War II.\n\nThe reason was partly that women did not always join formal resistance organisations, which meant they got few medals at the end of the war.\n\n\"There was a general belief that women didn't do much during the occupation of Paris.

She survived the war, and later immortalised her horrific experiences in the camp in La Traverse De La Nuit (God Remained Outside)."}, {"url": "https://www.historytoday.com/reviews/history-french-resistance", "page_content": "At 6pm on 18 June 1940, a relatively unknown French two-star general, Charles de Gaulle, composed himself in front of a microphone at the BBC\u2019s Broadcasting House in London and began a speech. Lasting less than six minutes, his words were an impassioned rejection of the armistice with Nazi Germany, which had been announced the day before by Marshal P\u00e9tain, prime minister and soon to be head of state of the collaborationist Vichy regime. Bristling with intent, de Gaulle was adamant that the Fall of France was just one battle and not the whole war, which he predicted would become a world war. Broadcast at 10pm, the speech was not obviously political. Rather it was a call to arms, aimed at the French military.\n\nFew French people responded to de Gaulle\u2019s plea, principally because it was difficult not to accept P\u00e9tain\u2019s logic that Nazi Germany had won. Indeed, most saw de Gaulle as irrelevant, preferring to embrace P\u00e9tain as the saviour figure whose authoritarian antisemitic regime, based in the central spa town of Vichy, enjoyed mass support in autumn 1940.\n\nHowever, after the Second World War, de Gaulle\u2019s speech of 18 June 1940 became enshrined in French history as the starting point of the French Resistance, which led directly to the Liberation four years later. This founding narrative allowed French people to forget the humiliation of Nazi Occupation and rebuild national self-esteem.\n\nIn reality, as Olivier Wieviorka shows in his compelling study, the speech was only one starting point for the Resistance, namely de Gaulle\u2019s Free French Movement in London.\n\nThroughout France, grassroots groups sprung up in late 1940 and 1941, independently of de Gaulle and of one another. Admittedly these groups were tiny in number and not all of them were necessarily military in character. In fact, many focused on the production of a clandestine press that challenged the Vichy regime and Nazism in terms of ideas. Furthermore, there was the ambiguous stance of the Communist Party, which, given the August 1939 Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, did not enter into full-blown anti-Nazi resistance until Germany\u2019s invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941.\n\nWieviorka charts the minutiae of these multiple beginnings with skill, outlining how this diversity explains the resentments, rivalries and political divisions between the different groups, not least the tension between de Gaulle in London and those fighting the Nazis at the sharp end in France. In particular, Wieviorka shows how, although the Resistance was united behind de Gaulle in May 1943, there was always suspicion on the part of the Gaullists towards the Communist Party. They feared that communist resisters had a secret plan to turn the defeat of Nazi Occupation into revolutionary insurrection and, for this reason, de Gaulle carefully controlled the choreography of the liberation of Paris at the end of August 1944, ensuring that he alone became the symbol of re-found national unity.\n\nFrom the outset Wieviorka underlines his disciplinary credentials. As a historian his mission is to strip back the myths and legends to arrive at a balanced interpretation of what has always been a highly emotive subject. To this end the book is defined by rigour and his arguments are backed up by a wealth of facts and figures. Thus he shows how the greatest repression took place right at the end of the Occupation. With the war turning decisively against them, Nazi violence intensified, which meant that the 21,600 deported to concentration camps between D-Day on 6 June 1944 and the end of November 1944 represented almost a third of all deportees for the whole four-year period. Then, in the weeks before final defeat in May 1945, the Nazis rounded up Resistance leaders, such as Charles Delestraint, and shot them, usually in the back of the neck.\n\nWieviorka is especially good on how radio became a key battleground of ideas. In London, de Gaulle had to fight for access to the airwaves via the BBC\u2019s noon news, eventually winning a daily five-minute slot from December 1940 onwards, which then became a crucial platform. During 1942, three million people tuned in to de Gaulle, which, Wieviorka says, explains why the Nazi and Vichy authorities did everything in their power to deter listening, ranging from jamming broadcasts through to the threat of imprisonment.\n\nThere is also a highly perceptive chapter on the sociology of resistance. After 1945, Gaullists and Communists fervently maintained that the majority of French people contributed to the Resistance. Such claims, Wieviorka emphasises, were a gross distortion of the truth, motivated by the desire to win political ascendency in the postwar period. The \u2018army of the shadows\u2019 was always a minority phenomenon, amounting to something between 300,000 and 500,000 women and men out of a population in 1945 of 39.6 million. Here, Wieviorka explores the logic of Resistance-engagement in terms of class, underlining how the numerical presence of the working class reflected the weight of the Communists. Moreover, the working class could draw upon a long-established culture of resistance, which included demonstrations, strikes and violent confrontation. Equally, though, there was a strong middle-class presence (teachers, doctors, academics) because, particularly at the beginning, proficiency in the written word was crucial in establishing the underground press, added to which was the massive role of foreigners. Thus of the 120,000 Spaniards who fled the Franco regime in 1939, many joined the Resistance on the grounds that this was a continuation of their anti-fascist struggle.\n\nHowever, this study is very much a history of the Resistance in metropolitan France. There is no consideration of how the French Resistance played out in France\u2019s empire. Similarly, some of the translation reads awkwardly, not least references to women as \u2018the fairer sex\u2019. That said, this is an impressive synthesis which, alongside the work of Roderick Kedward, Hannah Diamond and Robert Gildea, is now one of the starting points for understanding the French Resistance.\n\nThe French Resistance\n\nOlivier Wieviorka, Translated by Jane Marie Todd\n\nHarvard University Press 592pp \u00a336\n\nBuy from bookshop.org (affiliate link)\n\nMartin Evans is Professor of Modern European History at Sussex University.

French Resistance has a military side, as well as a more civilian component, and it wasn't always based on what de Gaulle wanted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot yet the eminent figure he would become, the French general continued broadcasting messages of encouragement from London, but his intention was not for those in France to immediately take up arms against the German occupiers. As Adam Gopnik wrote in The New Yorker, \"At first, de Gaulle had no vision of an armed internal resistance in France.\"\n\n\" \" Gen. Charles de Gaulle issues his call of resistance to the French people from London, England, June 18, 1940, just after the Nazi occupation of France. De Gaulle led the Free French Forces from London and later from Algiers throughout the occupation, and returned to Paris on its liberation in September 1944. \u00a9 Hulton-Deutsch Collection/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nHowever, resistance groups did form within France, including paramilitary organizations, often comprised of demobilized military men, with varying levels of loyalty to de Gaulle. Called the maquis, these organizations consisted of guerrilla-style resisters who lived in the mountains and caves throughout the country.\n\n\"If you went into the maquis, you went into clandestine, illegal life,\" says Pike. Members were never recognized as soldiers by the enemy, which meant that if caught, they did not enjoy the rights a prisoner of war would have.\n\nExamples of maquis organizations included the Arm\u00e9e Secr\u00e8te (AS), a Gaullist group; the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans Fran\u00e7ais (FTPF or simply FTP), created by the French Communist Party; and Organisation de R\u00e9sistance de l'Arm\u00e9e (ORA), a non-Gaullist group formed in the southern zone.\n\nThe various groups operated independently and did not necessarily agree with one another. In fact, there was friction between the AS and the FTP. The AS saw the communist-led FTP as causing trouble with its acts of sabotage, while FTP referred to the AS as the \"wait and see boys,\" according to Pike.\n\nA turning point for the disparate resistance groups came when de Gaulle sent civil servant Jean Moulin to France to unify the various networks. In May 1943, he convinced several groups to merge into the Conseil National de la Resistance (CNR). In later stages of the war, fighters worked together as the Force Fran\u00e7aises de l'Int\u00e9rieur (FFI) under the Allied command."}, {"url": "https://historyofyesterday.com/the-french-resistance-during-world-war-ii/", "page_content": "fter Guderian\u2019s tanks crossed the Meuse River on May 13, 1940, France was subdued by the Germans in just four weeks. The British were able to retreat across the English Channel, but the French were forced to retreat: the disaster was not only for the army but also for the civilian population \u2014 10 million refugees fled from the invading army. It was the largest population exodus in Europe in centuries.\n\nFight for the People\n\nMarshal P\u00e9tain (Source: Wikimedia Commons) On June 16, the new head of state, Marshal P\u00e9tain, demanded an armistice, a decision that eased many French people. The 84-year-old marshal, surrounded by the myth of the victory at Verdun in the First World War, was then seen as the man who saved France from a nightmare. He came to be compared to Joan of Arc, and his portrait was hung in many churches. But it would not be long before P\u00e9tain was blasphemed for his policy of collaborating with the Nazis. According to the armistice, France was divided into two zones, and P\u00e9tain established his government in the unoccupied area, in Vichy, a spa town chosen because the many hotels here could accommodate ministers. From there, the Vichy regime launched an offensive against all Republican elements in France, in a renaissance movement of extremist nationalism known as the National Revolution. It was, in the words of Charles Maurras \u2014 the theorist of this far-right France \u2014 the \u201ctriumph of true France\u201d before the Socialists, Communists, Jews, Freemasons, as well as before democratic and parliamentary traditions, accused of precipitating the defeat of France and led the country to catastrophe.\n\nThe French of the Vichy regime sought to find its place in a Europe of Nazism which, some believed, was imminent, if it had not already become a reality. Through Prime Ministers Pierre Laval and Darlan, the regime sought an agreement with the German occupier, and P\u00e9tain himself acknowledged that it was a matter of collaborationism. At first, mutual arrangements and benefits were sought, but German applications were accepted \u2014 or even anticipated. The culmination of this policy was the action of the new Militia \u2014 similar to the Nazi Gestapo \u2014 which persecuted French Jews and pursued and killed members of the Resistance, in collaboration with the German police.\n\nOn the other hand, the French Resistance rejected the armistice, collaborationism, extremist politics of the Vichy regime and, last but not least, the mythical status and popularity of P\u00e9tain, which was not easy given that no one could forget that P\u00e9tain \u2014 the collaborator with the Germans \u2014 had defeated them in the battle of Verdun (World War I).\n\nThe Rise of Resistance\n\nThe French resistance fought not only for the liberation of the country but also for the minds and hearts of the French. Many members of the Resistance would later declare that, at least for the first two years, their hardest mission was to defeat \u201cP\u00e9tainism,\u201d the confidence and support enjoyed by the Marshal. The task was easier after November 1942, when the Germans occupied the whole country, and P\u00e9tain remained in charge of what had become a regime subject to Berlin. However, P\u00e9tain\u2019s supporters had not completely disappeared.\n\nThe French Resistance Flag (Source: Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThe difference between the two areas, occupied and unoccupied, was the first significant variable in the history of the Resistance. The presence of the Germans in the north and west was both an impetus and a limiting factor for the Resistance. Instead, the absence of the Germans in the South of France was a vital factor \u2014 here, the anti-Vichy resistance experienced a much better organization and a wealth of clandestine publications.\n\nThere was also a difference between urban and rural areas. Initially, the resistance movement was par excellence an urban one. First of all, because the Germans were much more present here; then all the facilities for printing newspapers and manifestos were in the cities. Also in the city were much more pronounced the traditions of revolutionary politics, liberalism in high schools, and universities.\n\nBut as more and more French people began to feel the burden of the occupation, and many were deported to Germany to secure the Reich\u2019s workforce, more and more members of the Resistance withdrew to the rural areas of the Reich. France and the peasant communities became vital for the survival of the members of the Resistance in 1943\u20131944.\n\nOn the military front, the Resistance was permanently dependent on weapons and ammunition sent by the Allies. But the Allies had their own ideas about the strategic importance of each French region and based on that they chose which group to receive weapons. For example, groups of communists or those far from the main communication arteries were unlikely to receive supplies.\n\nAll these variables affected the nature and strength of the Resistance, and to better understand this phenomenon we need an analysis of the elements of class, profession, and personality of the members of the movement.\n\nThe first unofficial members of the Resistance were those who refused to accept the Armistice as the end of the war for France. We can name De Gaulle, in London, or those in France: Edmond Michelet, Jean-Moulin, Henri Frenay, Bertie Albrecht, Lucie Aubrac, and others. These are isolated individuals who tried to find ways to continue the conflict despite the disastrous situation.\n\nTo these were added the ideological enemies of Nazism: communists, socialists, left-wing Catholics, and Protestants. They all felt that they had to do something to oppose the government\u2019s inertia, which advised the French to take care of their lives and leave important decisions in the hands of P\u00e9tain and Laval.\n\nInfluence from Great Britain\n\nWinston Churchill and General de Gaulle in 1944 (Source: Rare Historical Photos)\n\nBy mid-1941, isolated individuals began to form small Resistance groups and networks. The most developed of these was the Free French Movement, led by General de Gaulle of Great Britain, which could benefit from BBC support to recruit volunteers from France and to establish a symbolic link between those who continued the war on behalf of free France. But de Gaulle\u2019s movement, although very important, was different from what actually happened on the mainland, in occupied France.\n\nHere, the Resistance movements gradually developed, and some groups did not even know of the initiative of the general on the other side of the English Channel. Along with the Resistance groups, there were also secret networks that transmitted information about the Germans to the British.\n\nActions of the Resistance\n\nIn the first two years of occupation, the Gestapo was not felt equally in all regions of France. The repressive policies of the Vichy regime were not felt in the same way throughout France, with one exception: the Jewish population. It was persecuted not only by the Germans but also by the legislation imposed by the Vichy government. Therefore, the resistance of the Jews was very difficult to assert, and only after the deportations began \u2014 in the summer of 1942 \u2014 did the Resistance movement as a whole begin to realize the savagery of German anti-Semitism and the extent to which the Vichy government collaborated with the Nazis regarding the arrest and persecution of Jews.\n\nDuring the process of shaping and developing the Resistance, many people became involved almost by accident: they found a clandestine pamphlet in the mailbox, did a favor to an arrested friend by sending a message, hid someone who was hiding from the Gestapo, saw an arrested neighbor, etc. The ways in which people came to the Resistance were very varied, as were the ways in which people put their talents and skills at the service of this movement.\n\nBefore the war, the French had the richest political press in Europe. After the defeat that led to the suppression of freedom of expression, both by German censors and by the Vichy government, it was necessary for the Resistance to create its own media network and they managed to do so in a remarkable way. Clandestine publications obtained information from the BBC, Swiss radio, Moscow, or African radio stations set up by General de Gaulle. Brochures, pamphlets, newspapers, even novels, and collections of poems or essays were published, demonstrating the vitality of the Resistance movement.\n\nNot all members of the resistance acted underground. Many remained at their jobs, using them to uncover important information, to protect the activities of the Resistance, and to sabotage the Germans. It is imperative to remember that not only the Germans were the target of the Resistance\u2019s operations, but also the French considered to be collaborators. These actions against French citizens were severely attacked by the Vichy regime and, after 1943, were classified as terrorist actions.\n\nIn essence, the Resistance was a reaffirmation of France\u2019s independence and individuality, as well as a struggle to regain freedom and, above all, national integrity. In military terms, it could have achieved more if it had been more effectively integrated into Allied plans and strategies.\n\nAs agent Harry Ree demonstrated at the Peugeot factory in Montbeliard, Resistance sabotage could be much more efficient and resource-efficient than random bombings such as the one in Rennes on March 9, 1944, in which they died. 300 civilians and the military target had barely been reached.\n\nThe resistance contributed greatly to the liberation of two-thirds of France, and organized ambushes and sabotages which affected the withdrawal and regrouping of the German army after the Allied landings."}, {"url": "https://u.osu.edu/wwiihistorytour/2023/05/20/paris-conflicting-stories-of-the-french-resistance/", "page_content": "In class and through my own research this semester, I\u2019ve learned how Charles de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French during WWII, defined resistance to Nazi occupation only as military action carried out by men beneath his command. This narrow definition could be a result of his own status as a military man and a potential desire to recognize only those who were loyal to him in the wide range of resistance networks. His limited view of resistance excluded the significant contributions of most of those who resisted the occupation from the French public memory. The subtle and small day-to-day resistance efforts conducted by resistants throughout France were ignored. Since most French women resisted non-violently, very few of them received recognition in the decades after the war, even though women comprised around 25% of active resistants.\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s definition of resistance as an affair for military men was extremely apparent in Paris\u2019 Mus\u00e9e de L\u2019Ordre de La Lib\u00e9ration in Les Invalides. The Order of Liberation was created in November 1940 by De Gaulle to honor the fighters who made significant contributions to the liberation of France, and the museum recognizes them. Upon walking in, one is met with a wall of faces of De Gaulle\u2019s Companions of Liberation. Only six are women, and nearly all the faces are white, even though black men from Senegal and North Africa comprised the bulk of De Gaulle\u2019s army. It doesn\u2019t make sense why France continues to tell this narrow narrative of resistance in one of Paris\u2019 most popular history museums. While Les Invalides is focused on the military side of France\u2019s history, perpetuating De Gaulle\u2019s military view of resistance without addressing the other avenues of resistance is a misrepresentative half-truth that continues to ignore the significant contributions of women and men of color.\n\nGermaine Tillion and Genevieve de Gaulle-Anthonioz, the niece of Charles de Gaulle, are two significant women resistants excluded from the Mus\u00e9e de L\u2019Ordre de La Lib\u00e9ration. Only two miles away from Les Invalides, they are interred in the Pantheon, a monument constructed to honor the \u201cgreat men\u201d of France. These two women were moved to the Pantheon in 2015 as a result of a movement that began in the 1970s to recognize women for their unique contributions to the Resistance. Only six women have been interred in the Pantheon compared to the fifty-four Frenchmen honored there, so their recognition marked progress in the recognition of women resistants and the dissolution of France\u2019s patriarchal structure. I had the privilege of visiting their graves and seeing how the women I\u2019d spent months researching were properly honored. Yet I was shocked at their complete absence from the museum. How can two women important enough to enter into the extremely exclusive Pantheon be given no mention or even a separate exhibit in Paris\u2019 museum to liberation? France\u2019s selective telling of its resistance history in different spaces suggests that their memory of the Resistance may not have progressed as much as my research indicated, and that more work must be done to tell a cohesive history of French Resistance that doesn\u2019t center solely on De Gaulle\u2019s chosen white men."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/travel/charles-de-gaulle-london-history.html", "page_content": "With its bland architecture and gray concrete pavement, little distinguishes Curzon Square from its surroundings in the heart of London\u2019s Mayfair district. But it was here that Charles de Gaulle wrote a speech that would change his country\u2019s fate and, he believed, fulfill his destiny.\n\nOn June 17, 1940, still reeling from France\u2019s fall to Nazi Germany three days earlier, de Gaulle fled to London, where he borrowed a friend\u2019s apartment at 3 Curzon Square (then called Seamore Grove) and drafted a passionate call to arms. The next day he broadcast a message on BBC radio \u2014 a direct, clarion appeal to the French people:\n\n\u201cI, General de Gaulle, now in London, call on all French officers and men who are at present on British soil, or may be in the future, with or without their arms; I call on all engineers and skilled workmen from the armaments factories who are at present on British soil, or may be in the future, to get in touch with me.\u201d\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s initial broadcast reached only a few parts of occupied France. (Subsequent transmissions on June 19 and 22 reached greater swathes of Vichy territory.) But today, it is considered one of the most significant moments in French history, even honored with its own square in Paris, Place du 18 Juin 1940.\n\nImage De Gaulle in the BBC studios, broadcasting his call to arms to all French people on British soil.

Charles de Gaulle led the Free French forces in resisting capitulation to Germany during World War II and became provisional president of France in the immediate aftermath of the war. Later he was an architect of the Fifth Republic and was president from 1959 to 1969. When did Charles de Gaulle become famous? Charles de Gaulle was undersecretary of state for defense and war when Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain took over the government of France with the intention of signing an armistice with Adolf Hitler. De Gaulle left for London, where, on June 18, 1940, he broadcast an appeal to his countrymen to continue to fight under his leadership. What were Charles de Gaulle\u2019s policies as president of France? Charles de Gaulle was determined that France should be treated as one of the great powers and not fall under the sway of any other country, particularly the United States. To that end, he made France a nuclear power, withdrew France from the military command of NATO, and followed his own views on foreign policy. When did Charles de Gaulle lose power? Charles de Gaulle lost power twice. He resigned as provisional president in 1946 because he opposed political parties forming the Fourth Republic, and, when his own movement failed to gain a majority, he retired from politics in 1953. The second time, voters rejected his proposed reforms, and he resigned as president in 1969.\n\nCharles de Gaulle, in full Charles Andr\u00e9 Joseph Marie de Gaulle, (born November 22, 1890, Lille, France\u2014died November 9, 1970, Colombey-les-deux-\u00c9glises), French soldier, writer, statesman, and architect of France\u2019s Fifth Republic.\n\nEducation and early career De Gaulle was the second son of a Roman Catholic, patriotic, and nationalist upper-middle-class family. The family had produced historians and writers, and his father taught philosophy and literature; but, as a boy, de Gaulle already showed a passionate interest in military matters. He attended the Military Academy of Saint-Cyr, and in 1913, as a young second lieutenant, he joined an infantry regiment commanded by Colonel Philippe P\u00e9tain. De Gaulle was an intelligent, hardworking, and zealous young soldier and, in his military career, a man of original mind, great self-assurance, and outstanding courage. In World War I he fought at Verdun, was three times wounded and three times mentioned in dispatches, and spent two years and eight months as a prisoner of war (during which time he made five unsuccessful attempts to escape). After a brief visit to Poland as a member of a military mission, a year\u2019s teaching at Saint-Cyr, and a two-year course of special training in strategy and tactics at the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure de Guerre (War College), he was promoted by Marshal P\u00e9tain in 1925 to the staff of the Supreme War Council. From 1927 to 1929 de Gaulle served as a major in the army occupying the Rhineland and could see for himself both the potential danger of German aggression and the inadequacy of the French defense. He also spent two years in the Middle East and then, having been promoted to lieutenant colonel, spent four years as a member of the secretariat of the National Defense Council. De Gaulle\u2019s writing career began with a study of the relations between the civil and military powers in Germany (La Discorde chez l\u2019ennemi, 1924; \u201cDiscord Among the Enemy\u201d), followed by lectures on his conception of leadership, Le Fil de l\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9e (1932; The Edge of the Sword). A study on military theory, Vers l\u2019arm\u00e9e de m\u00e9tier (1934; The Army of the Future), defended the idea of a small professional army, highly mechanized and mobile, in preference to the static theories exemplified by the Maginot Line, which was intended to protect France against German attack. He also wrote a memorandum in which he tried, even as late as January 1940, to convert politicians to his way of thinking. His views made him unpopular with his military superiors, and the question of his right to publish under his name a historical study, La France et son arm\u00e9e (1938; France and Her Army), led to a dispute with Marshal P\u00e9tain. Britannica Quiz Pop Quiz: 17 Things to Know About World War II\n\nWorld War II At the outbreak of World War II, de Gaulle commanded a tank brigade attached to the French Fifth Army. In May 1940, after assuming command as temporary brigadier general in the 4th Armoured Division\u2014the rank that he retained for the rest of his life\u2014he twice had the opportunity to apply his theories on tank warfare. He was mentioned as \u201can admirable, energetic, and courageous leader.\u201d On June 6 he entered the government of Paul Reynaud as undersecretary of state for defense and war, and he undertook several missions to England to explore the possibilities of continuing the war. When the Reynaud government was replaced 10 days later by that of Marshal P\u00e9tain, who intended to seek an armistice with the Germans, de Gaulle left for England. On June 18 he broadcast from London his first appeal to his compatriots to continue the war under his leadership. On August 2, 1940, a French military court tried and sentenced him in absentia to death, deprivation of military rank, and confiscation of property. De Gaulle entered his wartime career as a political leader with tremendous liabilities. He had only a handful of haphazardly recruited political supporters and volunteers for what were to become the Free French Forces. He had no political status and was virtually unknown in both Britain and France. But he had an absolute belief in his mission and a conviction that he possessed the qualities of leadership. He was totally devoted to France and had the strength of character (or obstinacy, as it often appeared to the British) to fight for French interests as he saw them with all the resources at his disposal.

Broadcasts from London, the action of the Free French Forces, and the contacts of resistance groups in France either with de Gaulle\u2019s own organization or with those of the British secret services brought national recognition of his leadership; but full recognition by his allies came only after the liberation of Paris in August 1944. Henri Giraud, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Charles de Gaulle, and Winston Churchill; Casablanca Conference In London de Gaulle\u2019s relations with the British government were never easy, and de Gaulle often added to the strain, at times through his own misjudgment or touchiness. In 1943 he moved his headquarters to Algiers, where he became president of the French Committee of National Liberation, at first jointly with General Henri Giraud. De Gaulle\u2019s successful campaign to edge out Giraud gave the world proof of his skill in political maneuvering."}]}
