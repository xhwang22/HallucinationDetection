T. PACAUD (Megantic):\n\nMr. Speaker, the debate, through the speeches which have already been made, has rohbed me of arguments which I intended to offer the House, and I shall therefore willingly curtail my remarks somewhat.\n\nThe question of the food supply which is raised by this motion involves considerations which are of the utmost importance both to our country and to our Allies. No other question, Sir, has stirred and aroused the people of Canada more fervently, moire deeply or more unanimously. This intense feeling which has been growing and spreading steadily since the outbreak of war may easily be explained by an impartial survey of conditions as they have existed and still exist in Canada at this time. On the one hand we have the prohibitive prices, which deny to the masses the very necessaries of life, with the accompanying hardships and misery. On the other hand we have the revolting disclosures that have been made from time to time concerning the hoarding of food, the cold storage opera-1SJ\n\ntions, the nefarious greed of the profiteers. These, Sir, are the outstanding facts which cannot he denied. Mr. O'Connor has exposed them to the public. We had the story of the bacon manipulations; we had the egg disclosures; and more recently, and through another source, we heard of hundreds and hundreds of pounds of chicken left to rot in cold storage at Winnipeg. I hese may serve as illustrations of what i3 going on in Canada on a very large scale. Sir, in the face of such disclosures, nothing effective was done or attempted to be done by the Government to remedy snch an evil. Are we not tempted, Sir, to laud the patience of the Canadian people in the face of euch provocation from the men who daily exploit them', from the Government who refuses to protect them?\n\nWhat has the Government done? A Food Board was created and a Food Controller was put in control. The Order in Council creating this board gave the Controller clearly defined powers. He had the right \" to govern the prices of any article of food and to supervise the storage, .the distribution, the sale and the delivery of these articles.\" Why were not these powers exercised, exercised especially in the cases which have been brought to the attention of the public by the High Cost of Living Commissioner?\n\nInstead of taking immediate steps to curtail this open exploitation of the public, the Government, through its commissioner, preferred to follow the easier course of preaching economy to the people. Under the circumstances which I have related, I say that these mere words, followed by no effective action, may have satisfied the cold storage magnates, but they certainly have not satisfied the people of this country.\n\nWe have in Canada an abundance of food, sufficient not only for our own needs, but the greater bulk of which is exported to allied countries. This brings me to another phase of this same question-the campaign of production which the Government has so fervently prosecuted of late. To this campaign all loyal Canadians will give their hearty support. We all recognize that upon the success of our devotion to food raising depends in a large measure the victory of our hoys at the front. We -know that the world faces to-day a food situation which is nothing short of appalling. We know that the supply is not sufficient to feed the world's armies, let alone the civilian population. But, Sir, this is not all. We have had occasion ^ to hear the representatives of. Britain making to us an appeal,-\n\nan appeal which will surely be heard and responded to, and which has thrilled each one of us in a patriotic determination to strive every nerve to do what is requested of us. Lord Rhondda, the British food controller, for one, has made his plea quite clear. \"We look,\" he says, \"to the resources of Canada and the indomitable energy of Canadians for an answer that will shatter Germany's threat of starvation.\" He tells us, that it is vital for the United Kingdom and the Allies to obtain from Canada foodstuffs in far larger quantities than under peace conditions. His frankness even goes so far as to recall to us that an increased export of food supplies must be forthcoming, even though the achievement of this task entails diversion of,effort from other enterprises. It is Canada's duty to prove her efficiency and her determination. This plea must not be left unanswered. May I be permitted to confess that these words of the British food controller are comforting to those of us who through motives which cannot be challenged, opposed a measure which wre sincerely believed if put into operation would decidedly diminish if not defeat our effectiveness in this war, by laying aside the most formidable weapon which could have been used against the enemy. We faced a storm of abuse and slander, but these attacks did not deter us from what we believed was our plain duty. We have at least the consolation of knowing that our conception of duty was shared, in some measure at least, by the brightest minds of Britain. What we need to-day, is a larger acreage and higher yields for the years to come. We need to increase our productive capacity, the problem is with us, and it must be solved. Upon its solution, to my mind, depends the success of our allies and ourselves in this war. To achieve our purpose, it is obvious that we need farm labour. It is not less obvious that it is a national necessity that we should remove the duties on farming implements. The Government have started in their task by means of the registration of the man power of the Dominion. I believe that, though that is a good step in the right direction, it has come a little late; it should have been done at the very beginning of the war. Nevertheless, I sincerely hope, that in its results it may procure more information and attain better results for Canada and for the Empire than has been achieved by the now famous National Service cards of a year ago.\n\nMr. J. IE. FONTAINE (Hull) (translation) : Mr. Speaker, I am perhaps a little\n\naudacious in rising to take part in this debate, since I have just entered this Parliament, and am in nowise familiar with Parliamentary procedure; nevertheless,\n\nwhen the voters of Hull county, which I have the honour to represent, elected me by acclamation on the 19th of last November,\n\nI gave them my solemn promise that I would seize upon every opportunity offered to protest against the exorbitant cost of living and try to bring it down if it were possible to do so. It was reserved, Mr. Speaker, for the right hon. leader of the Opposition, to afford me this opportunity in bringing about this debate this afternoon; for him who, in contrast to the hon. gentlemen seated on the other side of the House, has always been the protector and the defender of the people against the trusts and the monopolists.\n\nIt is useless, I believe, for me to say that the present cost of living has reached a price so high that the consumer is forced ti deprive himself even of necessaries of life. I could mention things, foods like flour, bacon, eggs, which have surely increased 50 and even 100 per cent. If, at least, Mr. Speaker, salaries had increased in proportion; but I see, by the reports of the Labour Gazette which I have here before me, that salaries have not been increased by more than 15 to 17i per cent. There has been a general protest. I remember, in the city of Hull, where I reside, on the other side of Ottawa, hearing Mr. Watters, the president of the Labour Unions of Canada, denounce the Minister of Labour (Mr.'Crothers) and even denounce the Prime Minister of this country because the workingmen could not procure the necessaries of life with the low salaries they were paid.\n\nIn the face of these protests the Government thought they would calm public opinion by appointing what they called a Food Controller, and it was then that the Government told us of the appointment of Mr. Hanna. Everybody was satisfied, the people believed that the .Government was sincere and that by their appointing a Food Controller we could at least earn enough to enable us to buy the necessaries of life. The irony of it, Mr. Speaker ! The Controller was well and duly appointed; he was given spacious offices, and it is said that his suite was furnished with luxury and that he was given a staff, both very numerous and very expensive-if I believe the gentlemen who have preceded me-and still he was not controlling; the cost of living was soaring all the time.\n\nA moment ago I heard my hon. friend, the Minister of Customs, say that the appoint-\n\nment of the Controller did not aim at control. My iLord! we were well aware of it, he never did control! His duty consisted simply in seeing that no food was wasted. Could he have forgotten what my hon. friend from Meg-antic (Mr. Pacaud) said a while ago? Haven't we learned, in the last few days, through the newspapers, that a large ..quantity of foodstuffs, hoarded in storage warehouses in order to boost prices, had been sent to the incinerator in the city of Winnipeg? Well! if the duty of the Food Controller was to prevent the waste of foodstuffs, why did he allow such .an enormous quantity of food to find its way to the garbage heap? Is it because those implicated are the friends of the Government? I ask you that, Mr. Speaker."}, {"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/6123144", "page_content": "Lucien Turcotte Pacaud ( September 21 1879 \u2013 March 5 1960 ) was a Quebec lawyer and political figure.

Laying aside for the time being the reservations and the criticisms which a perusal of this document may suggest to one, I feel prompted at the very outset of my remarks to recall the magnitude of the task of those whose mission was to draft this Treaty, to pacify a world which had, during four years of war, suffered the greatest carnage known in history. I could not better illustrate the thought which I wish to convey, Mr. Speaker, than by citing\n\nthe word of a great French writer and statesman: That during the seven months which preceded, the signing of this Treaty it was as if humanity had been placed on the dissecting table so as to better discover the mystery of its new organism and of its new life, to detect and to stamp out from its very soul the venom which had poisoned it in the past and nearly brought it to its downfall. This was the lofty purpose which the representatives of the great powers had in view, and to what extent their efforts were crowned with success a study of the document which is now the subject of this debate can alone enlighten us.\n\nA Treaty, Sir, which has for its object the re-modelling of a whole world, when presented for ratification to this Parliament -though I strongly hold, as others have done before me, that this ratification is alike dangerous and unnecessary-should not at least have prompted the Government to pursue the course which they had intended to pursue-to snatch from any individual member of this House the time and opportunity to study this Treaty with the care and attention which the interests of this country demand. Such hasty action, Sir, as it was intended to impose upon us was not justified, in my opinion, on any ground of reasoning, and furthermore, may I add, it was in direct contradiction of the attitude which had been taken by the governments of France, of Great Britain and of the United States where the statesmen seem to respect more clearly the privileges and the rights of Parliament than the genr tlemen who for the time being are occupying the treasury benches of this House.\n\nWishing, Mr. Speaker, to curtail my remarks as much as possible, I will endeavour as briefly and as clearly as I can to lay before the House the general conclusions which I have reached and which will explain the vote I intend to cast on this most important matter. It is a fact that this Treaty has been severely criticised and in some quarters unmercifully assailed by men of outstanding character and reputation in all the allied countries. Let us not be surprised at this divergence of view on the part of men who are not responsible for the framing of this instrument, when we recall that the Treaty itself is but the result of a compromise between those who had the responsibility of drafting it.\n\nBearing this thought in mind, what do we find in this Treaty? We find features which will assuredly have the hearty support of the interested people. We find clauses which do not live up to our expectations;\n\nwe find others, again, which seem to shatter the very hopes of those who have sacrificed so much, by endangering the safety and future freedom of action of the countries which they indirectly affect.\n\niSir, what appeals to me most strongly in this Treaty is that in it are to be found, though modified and amended, the principles which prompted and inspired the famous fourteen articles of President Wilson, which at the time of their pronouncement on the 8th of January, 1918, stirred the Allied world, and commanded its hearty and enthusiastic support. What are these principles? Could they not, when considered in their last analysis, be reduced to the following three political axioms:\n\n1. That each part of the final settlement should be based on justice, under reserve of dispositions the most proper to guarantee permanent peace.\n\n2. That no territorial settlement should be made that does not comply with the interests and advantages of the populations involved in the said settlement.\n\n3. That each well-defined nationality should see its aspirations realized in the fullest measure.\n\nMr. Speaker, looking over this Treaty from cover to cover, though we may perceive that these axioms were not always rigorously adhered to, can we not proclaim that it is through the instrumentality of these principles that new nations have come to life, endowed with the blessings of freedom, at last delivered from the yoke of oppression? Unfortunately, Sir, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that great as has been the advance in the right direction, there are still many flaws in this Treaty, regrettable omissions which we may hope soon to see remedied and adjusted. I am frank to admit that for myself I should have liked at this moment, when we are witnessing the births of nations, the resurrection of Poland, the transfer of Alsace-Lorraine to its rightful owners, to see also the final settlement of the Irish question. I only hope and pray that the bitterness engendered through centuries of struggle in that country may soon disappear through the influence of freedom, generously accorded to her people.\n\nThese, Mr. Speaker, are the three considerations which the study of this Treaty from its larger aspect have suggested to me.\n\nI now come to the last and most important point which I wish to raise, as many others have done who preceded me. Is it necessary for this Parliament to ratify this Treaty? What would be the consequence of our ratification or of our .abstaining from ratify-\n\nmg the Treaty? In what direction lies the surest safeguard of Canadian interests, which we are here to protect? These questions have been raised and fully discussed in the course of, this debate. I unhesitatingly range myself with those who have argued, to my mind so well and so conclusively, that ratification by this Parliament is unnecessary and that whatever may be our action in this House, the Treaty will remain unaffected. No amount of sophistry, from whatever quarter it is launched, can, in my opinion, effectively veil this truth: that in the authority within the British Empire to which belongs exclusively the right to declare war in the name of the Empire-the King and his constitutional advisers-is alone vested the power to make peace for that Empire. What, therefore, are the motives that have prompted this Government to such hasty action-to the calling of a special session to ratify a Treaty that needs no ratification by us? It is in the Covenant of the League of Nations, and especially in Article X, that we may find a reason for their action.\n\nI do not wish, Mr. Speaker, to he understood as being opposed to the principle of the League of Nations. I strongly believe that permanent peace cannot be hoped for without the closest co-operation between the democratic nations of the world. These nations are called upon to protect and to defend two principles: the principle of justice inherent in the aspirations of their people, and the principle, too often forgotten, of mutual respect among all nationalities. In the defence of these principles, and to better assure that peace and justice may in the future triumph in the world, we are now erecting a new organism representing alike nationalities and democracies-an organism which is embodied in the Covenant of the League of Nations. But, Sir, could we not have attained this same high purpose through other means than by those which bind this country in the future to abide by the decision of a Council in which we shall not be represented-a decision which may be so far-reaching in its consequences as to have the effect of dragging us into a war, of conscripting our young manhood and our wealth for the purpose of protecting the territorial integrity of other nations, and this without giving to our Parliament the right to deliberate and to decide on the merits of the case?\n\nThe Government, by forcing us to ratify a Treaty though no good can be derived from such action and though no necessity is apparent for it, are only taking advan-\n\ntage of the reluctance that a member may have to reject it on general grounds, in order that they may better pursue their old policy of imperialism in disguise-always ready to raise an altar to Canadian autonomy, but never failing to undermine in action what they so highly praise and proclaim in words.\n\nThis, Mr. Speaker, is the situation as it presents itself to me. It is grave and critical, endangering, as it does our future freedom of action. By the adoption of Article X we are stripping this Parliament of its most valued prerogative; we are placing the Canadian people at the beck and call of a Council not responsible to the nation for its actions. By one stroke of the pen we are mortgaging our freedom, receiving practically nothing in return.\n\nOur prospects under this arrangement are not bright. Let us at least comfort ourselves with the hope that the prophecy of President Poincare of France may yet be realized, when he said that \"real and permanent peace will not emerge from any single instrument of peace, but will be the outcome of a never-ceasing and collective effort on the part of the allied and associated powers.\"\n\nMr. FRANK B. STACEY (Fraser Valley): Mr. Speaker, as I recall the words of the hon. gentleman who leads the Opposition (Mr. McKenzie) in his opening remarks this afternoon, with regard to what should he the characteristics and qualifications of those who take part in this debate, I assure you that it is with the greatest hesitation that I rise to offer any observations whatever upon the subject which is occupying the attention of this House.\n\nWhen Parliament assembled a week ago I had no intention of making any remarks upon this subject. I mistakenly assumed that the language of the document which we are now considering would be couched in legal and technical phraseology and that an ordinary man would have difficulty in understanding it and should, perhaps be silent when the time for discussion came.\n\nBut I found that what is, to my mind, the very heart of the document was capable of interpretation by an ordinary layman or workingman like myself. While I do not presume to discuss the question from the standpoint of its constitutionality, I purpose offering some observations as to the Treaty, especially that part of it called the Covenant of the League of Nations, as it appeals to the ordinary man, to the .man in the street, to the man who is not versed in the technicalities of legal inspection and\n\ndiscussion, But as it is, I believe, regarded by the great majority of ordinary men and women who are interested in knowing something about the real, practical meaning of this Covenant of the League of Nations. I shall not pretend nor attempt to speak respecting the Treaty of Peace itself.\n\nIt strikes me-and I believe it appeals in this way to hundreds of thousands of our citizens-that after five years of agony, heartaches, carnage and immeasurable destruction, the allied nations conceived an idea, that grew into a plan, which was finally formulated into a document, which gives greater promise and 'hope of a lasting peace in this world than has ever before been seen or known by men in the long and chequered history of humanity. The preamble itself is a remarkable and striking statement, a tribute alike to the high spirit of the signatories, and, under the circumstances, to their magnanimity as victors.\n\nI shall presume to offer a few remarks on the article that has been referred to so frequently, not only this evening, but on previous occasions, namely, Article 10. As I have intimated, I have not had a legal training. I do not pretend to read into this Treaty possible difficulties; I do not pretend to be able to discuss the constitutional difficulties which may arise, which are possibly real and genuine and which this nation may have to face in the future. But I remember this, that objection has1 been taken to Article 10 by hon. gentlemen opposite because its .provisions may involve us in conflicts in some far-away section of Europe, or in some distant portion of South America. We must not forget to-day that the world is very small, so small that Jules Verne's book has long since been thrown into the bonfire, and it is quite possible that there are within this Chamber hon. gentlemen who themselves may voyage around the world in less than eight days. All those manifestations and conditions which obtained a generation ago are changed. If distance is to be measured by time, the Atlantic ocean is not any larger than some of our great Canadian lakes used to be. Why should not Canada have a place in the League of Nations? During half a century or more we have grown out of a national infancy and childhood and youth into a young manhood; we have been under the protection of the great Mother Country, and there is, I am sure, no disposition on the part of any one to-day to 9 p.m. break with England. She has, in *a sense, led us by the hand until now, reaching the stage of manhood, we\n\nare, I trust, prepared to take our place beside her, shoulder to shoulder, in every great plan which looks towards the peace, prosperity and happiness of the world. Hon. members opposite have to-day been searching the pages o.f history to ascertain some precedent for the action that is now proposed to be taken. As I see it, we are not reviewing history, we are making history; we are not following precedents, we are establishing precedents. And, why should we not, as a self-governing nation, be prepared, at this stage in our history, to assume our place and take our full measure of responsibility at this critical time in the history of the world?\n\nIn my province, which province by the way sent more than 10 per cent of her total population to the front, there were, during the course of the war-I regret to say this, but I want to be honest-a few men who apparently did not realize the duties of citizenship. True they claimed and desired all the privileges of citizenship in my province; they claimed the right to the franchise; they sought the protection of the British navy and also, the protection of the allied forces, including the protection of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. But for one reason or another they did not enlist. Sometimes they had a fluttering around the heart; sometimes they thought they had a flatfoot, and occasionally we found them obsessed with the idea that they needed a change of climate. For the benefit of their health or for the advantage of their pocket, they concluded that a trip across the line to the 'south would be of advantage to them, and so they went. At any late, they failed to join up, and we had in our province a few men who, while they desired all the privileges of citizenship, refused to assume the responsibilities of citizenship.\n\nI fear lest there may be some spirit akin to the foregoing in the action of those gentlemen here or elsewhere who would like to have the full protection afforded this country by the ratification of the Treaty of Peace, including the League of Nations and including Article X-who would like to have all the advantages and all the privileges, without assuming the responsibilities and obligations which are embodied in that article. It was very aptly pointed out by the hon. member for Megan-tic (Mr. Pacaud), if I mistake not, that this proposition is the application of the idea and principle of co-operation-national co-operation. This is true. I cannot conceive of the Canadian Parliament or the\n\nCanadian people refusing to approve of the Treaty of Peace, especially with regard to this Covenant of the League of Nations. The preamble, I may say, is a marvellous introduction to a state paper that will take its place by the side of any state paper in the annals of human history. I shall read two or three sentences:\n\nIn order to promote international co-operation and to achieve international peace and security -by the acceptance of obligations not to resort to war.\n\nI call attention to the three succeeding clauses:\n\nBy the prescription of open, just and honourable relations between nations; by the firm establishment of the understandings of international law as the actual rule of conduct among governments; and by the maintenance of justice and the scrupulous respect of all Treaty obligations in the dealings of organized peoples with one another.\n\nAs I understand it, Mr. Speaker, these three last clauses that I have read contain the very reasons which led 32,000 of our young men five years ago to rush to Val-cartier. These three clauses give the reason why, a little later in the dark and awful days of the four years that followed, over half a million more of their brothers and sisters went to their aid. The reason is found in this preamble. There is no additional reason to be ascertained; it lies here and here alone. But the words of this preamble are words and only words. They are great words; they will be historic words, and will ever be read as an expression of high statesmanship and of splendid ideas.; but they are words only. The essence, the acid test of this preamble, is found in Article X. You cannot make use of the preamble legitimately, reasonably, logically, without also accepting Article X. 1 believe in my heart, Sir, that it would be an example of the very personification of audacity for any man or any Parliament to say: \"We refuse to approve of Article X,\" and then have the nerve to proceed to approve of the remaining two hundred pages. In the days of. the future should the storm break over our heads or over the head of some other small nation, we are united in our aim to speedily bring the struggle to an end and protect the weaker nation. I claim that there is a greater probability, amounting almost to a certainty, of actual peace than could possibly be secured without the provisions of Article X. And should the storm break and troubles come, then we are prepared to do our share. I take it, Mr. Speaker, that Article X of this Covenant means in\n\nsubstance, in commonplace phraseology stripped of all legal technicalities, that we believe in peace and want peace. It means that we want peace ourselves and want peace for all nations of the world; and because we want it and because we bate war, we are willing to co-operate with other nations in keeping the world's peace so far as may be humanly possible. Is it not reasonable and sane, iand comparatively sure, that with these provisions and with these ideas there is greater probability of peace than if we and all others refused to say \"We shall bind ourselves together in the joint interests of humanity.\" Moreover, is it not a laudable aim for any young nation just entering upon its maturity to ally itself with the very highest civilization of the globe in its determination to be, in a very broad sense, the safeguard and advocate of the peace and prosperity and liberty of the world?\n\nThere is one view of this question that has not been presented to this House. It may not, strictly speaking, be involved in the letter of the Treaty, indeed, I am willing to admit, that it is not; but it appears to me to be a question of very great and serious import. And not only in my humbly judgment but, I believe, in the judgment of the great bulk of the citizens of Canada the question is agitating their minds: They are thinking and speaking about the matter which I am going to venture to introduce to this- House now.\n\nI shall assume that this Parliament will ratify the Treaty of Peace; I shall assume that otir country is entering upon a new era, upon a new and larger life. She has won by the valour of her sons upon the battle field and by the statesmanship of her legislators in the councils of the nations a very high place in the world's record of great deeds. The world over the magic word Canada\" upon the shoulder straps of every Canadian soldier from the humblest private to General Sir Arthur Currie, has been both the pride of the wearer and the admiration, if not indeed the envy, of every observer. With these facts and results behind us, and with a future that one can hardly overestimate ahead of us, and entering now upon a larger national life my problem is: How shall we the Canadian people so relate ourselves to the new conditions and to the new national life to ensure that our country will become not merely great in population or in wealth, but in all those higher attributes of mind and spirit which alone are the assured factors in national prosperity? This, Sir, is the question that has been in my mind and\n\nwhich is in the minds, I have reason to believe, of our best citizens and I believe also, although not expressed as yet, in the minds of the members of this House.\n\nWhere is the Canadian citizen who has not been thrilled, who has not even been moved to tears at the recital of deeds of unparalleled heroism by our soldiers overseas? And of equal courage and matchless devotion of our daughters as they have taken their places in ministering to the needs of those who have been wounded? How can we, I repeat, in view of all these things, so relate ourselves to the future that we shall be equal to the increased responsibilities and obligations which are resting upon us as a nation? If there is any phrase or single sentence that better embodies or suggests the answer to my query than another, it is this: The character and the development of our Canadian citizenship. I am well aware of the fact that this is neither the time nor the place to discuss that question at length, but I shall venture to give a few moments to it because of the reasons I have assigned.\n\nIf I might express in the most general terms my appreciation of the character and the qualities suggested in the term \" Canadian citizenship \" I would do it by referring to four main factors which contribute to such a true and desirable Canadian citizenship. First, in our homes we shall be compelled through youthful inquiries in the future to lay greater emphasis upon patriotic principles and the relation of the family to national life than we found it necessary to do prior to 1914.\n\nThen there is the Canadian press. I suppose that in referring to it I am treading upon sacred ground-or otherwise.. I cannot help but feel that, notwithstanding the very efficient service rendered by the Canadian press to Canadian ideals and to the true spirit of Canadian citizenship, there is one thing that I would fain see changed and changed for the better. I do not think that the cynical spirit sometimes continued almost to exaggeration by the press is conducive to the development of the highest type of Canadian citizenship and ideals. I come to another factor that enters vitally into the character and development of our Canadian citizenship and that. Sir, is found in our school system. We are coming to a day of change. The best citizens behind our public schools realize . that mistakes have been made in the past and that some change is necessary. Throughout this land there is an idea that the day is not far distant when the passing of an examination\n\nwill not be regarded as the be-all and end-all of our public school life. Greater attention must be given to the expression of the individual as a factor in our national life. But speaking of our educational work as a great factor in our national life, I place special emphasis upon the opportunities and obligations of our Canadian colleges.\n\nI do riot now refer to the technical institution which furnishes our country with experts either industrial, economic, professional or scientific. I have in mind the college of liberal arts whether for ladies exclusively or the university course for both sexes leading to the Bachelor's degree. These institutions are in the main turning out not professors or scientific or economic experts but citizens who will take their place in the ordinary ranks of domestic or commercial life, but who, by reason of their extraordinary educational advantages, should be more than ordinary citizens. That is to say, the main objective of the college of liberal arts should not be scholarship but citizenship. The latter must become the goal, the former, a means of reaching it. Our country's future will be largely determined by the ideals of citizenship inspiring our people. The great opportunity and business of the college and university is to project upon society broadminded, or rather spacious-minded, men and women, well-balanced and sane, who will become big citizens. Our country's supreme need to-day, to-morrow and for all time, is not so much bright scholars as big citizens. We need more bigger, broader, better citizens, and the college system or curriculum which fails to produce the goods must either be changed or ultimately go to the scrap heap. The citizen does not exist for the college, but the college for the citizen. Education is of real value only as it qualifies for, and results in, good citizenship. Many a good citizen has never had a college life, but a good citizen is always a truly educated man, nevertheless. Perhaps I can best explain my meaning by the following illustration: A\n\nfew weeks ago I ran across a man in my province who, from the standpoint of the schools, would be called an uneducated man. In fact, Sir, he himself claimed to be an uneducated man and deplored the fact most sincerely and heartily. But I found that he could give me the name and the characteristics of every plant that grew in that district. He could tell me the names and describe the uses of all the trees in that section of the country. If a bird flew by or alighted upon a tree he could\n\ntell me its name and give me all its characteristics. If he saw the footprint of an animal on the ground he could tell me its name and describe its habits-in fact, he was a reliable authority on the entire flora and fauna of that district, and yet he claimed to be an uneducated man. As I said, from the standpoint of the schools, he was uneducated. He knew little of mathematics, less of literature, I doubt if he could spell the word \"philosophy,\" and he thought he knew nothing of science. Moreover, Sir, he was a good citizen, inasmuch as he took his part in the great war faithfully and well. And last June, when the whole of the West between the Bed river and the Pacific was threatened with an incipient Soviet revolution resulting in some of its leaders being imprisoned and not, as the hon. the leader of the Opposition described the other day as being driven to prison because they were labour leaders-far from it, and let me say that the records of the courts have vindicated the position I took here last June and take here to-night-during that unsettled month this man acted as a steadying force in the community. He counselled against rocking the boat. He was a sort of moral and social anchor during the troublous times of last June. He counselled quietness, and steadiness, while some so-called scholars counselled otherwise. That man, Sir, was a good citizen, and from the standpoint of Canadian citizenship well-educated, although from the viewpoint of the schools, he would not perhaps, in the past at least, be so designated. My argument comes to this point: that our university life must so shape itself to meet the demands of the coming generation that the great aim of every college of liberal art in this Dominion, from ocean to ocean, would be nothing less than to turn out the very highest type of Canadian citizenship that can be produced within its walls. This man to whom I refer, I think, illustrated better than any one I have ever met the thought that was given expression to by John Milton two hundred and fifty years ago, and I doubt if his definition has ever been excelled, when he said:\n\nI call therefore a complete and generous education that which enables a man to perform justly, skilfully, and magnanimously, all the offices, public and private, both in peace and war.\n\nNow, I come to discuss, for a few moments only, another factor, another great force, in the creation of a right ideal of Canadian citizenship. I have briefly\n\ntouched upon the home, more briefly upon the press, and perhaps at greater length upon the college. But, Sir, there is still another factor which plays a most important part in the development of that type of citizenship which will enable us as a people and as a nation to take our place and maintain it in the days to come through the new relations that are put upon us. I refer, Sir, to the influence, and the power, and the work of the church. The college man says a good citizen must be an educated citizen. I agree with him, I accept his statement. The church-man will say a good citizen must be a Christian citizen. I do not deny the statement, I am inclined to agree with him. iBut, Sir, I believe this country has come to realize that notwithstanding all they have done in the past the churches of this land must lay more stress, more time, and more energy, upon those means which tend towards the development of a high ideal of Christian citizenship. That church, individual or denominational, will take its place in the Canadian life which, in the largest degree promotes a true and strong citizenship, and not very much longer will there attach to the cloth as such any special recognition or any inherent authority in the social world.\n\nThe churches of our realm have done a grand work for the Empire during the past four or five years; but they have a greater work to do from ocean to ocean in seeking upon all occasions to inject into the minds of their people the paramount importance of Canadian citizenship. I said a few moments ago that the college existed for the citizen, and not the citizen for the college. I go further and say that the church exists for the citizen, and not the citizen for the church. That church will take its place and do its work that sets before its people the highest type of true Canadian citizenship. It is not the cut or the colour of the leader's garb that to-day has or to-morrow will have any influence along the line of real leadership. It is not what is below a man's collar that makes for citizenship, but what is above it. What is above it is of prime importance; what is below vit is of very minor importance.\n\nThe ratification of this Treaty of Peace, including the Covenant of the League, of Nations, Mr. Speaker, will take place, I believe. That means that we are entering upon a new era with a new and a larger life. Our responsibilities are great, our obligations are heavy, but our resources are\n\nalmost boundless. With faith in our future and with confidence in one another and with a sincere purpose to give the very-best that is in us to our country and to posterity, I believe that we can and will not only take our place but maintain that position in the world's great League of Nations.\n\nOn the motion of Hon. Mr. Doherty the House adjourned at 9.40 p.m.\n\nTuesday, September 9, 1919."}, {"url": "https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/995076/lucien-turcotte-pacaud", "page_content": "Edit Mode\n\nGo Premium to enter Edit Mode\n\nTake control of your EliteProspects profile!

Laying aside for the time being the reservations and the criticisms which a perusal of this document may suggest to one, I feel prompted at the very outset of my remarks to recall the magnitude of the task of those whose mission was to draft this Treaty, to pacify a world which had, during four years of war, suffered the greatest carnage known in history. I could not better illustrate the thought which I wish to convey, Mr. Speaker, than by citing\n\nthe word of a great French writer and statesman: That during the seven months which preceded, the signing of this Treaty it was as if humanity had been placed on the dissecting table so as to better discover the mystery of its new organism and of its new life, to detect and to stamp out from its very soul the venom which had poisoned it in the past and nearly brought it to its downfall. This was the lofty purpose which the representatives of the great powers had in view, and to what extent their efforts were crowned with success a study of the document which is now the subject of this debate can alone enlighten us.\n\nA Treaty, Sir, which has for its object the re-modelling of a whole world, when presented for ratification to this Parliament -though I strongly hold, as others have done before me, that this ratification is alike dangerous and unnecessary-should not at least have prompted the Government to pursue the course which they had intended to pursue-to snatch from any individual member of this House the time and opportunity to study this Treaty with the care and attention which the interests of this country demand. Such hasty action, Sir, as it was intended to impose upon us was not justified, in my opinion, on any ground of reasoning, and furthermore, may I add, it was in direct contradiction of the attitude which had been taken by the governments of France, of Great Britain and of the United States where the statesmen seem to respect more clearly the privileges and the rights of Parliament than the genr tlemen who for the time being are occupying the treasury benches of this House.\n\nWishing, Mr. Speaker, to curtail my remarks as much as possible, I will endeavour as briefly and as clearly as I can to lay before the House the general conclusions which I have reached and which will explain the vote I intend to cast on this most important matter. It is a fact that this Treaty has been severely criticised and in some quarters unmercifully assailed by men of outstanding character and reputation in all the allied countries. Let us not be surprised at this divergence of view on the part of men who are not responsible for the framing of this instrument, when we recall that the Treaty itself is but the result of a compromise between those who had the responsibility of drafting it.\n\nBearing this thought in mind, what do we find in this Treaty? We find features which will assuredly have the hearty support of the interested people. We find clauses which do not live up to our expectations;\n\nwe find others, again, which seem to shatter the very hopes of those who have sacrificed so much, by endangering the safety and future freedom of action of the countries which they indirectly affect.\n\niSir, what appeals to me most strongly in this Treaty is that in it are to be found, though modified and amended, the principles which prompted and inspired the famous fourteen articles of President Wilson, which at the time of their pronouncement on the 8th of January, 1918, stirred the Allied world, and commanded its hearty and enthusiastic support. What are these principles? Could they not, when considered in their last analysis, be reduced to the following three political axioms:\n\n1. That each part of the final settlement should be based on justice, under reserve of dispositions the most proper to guarantee permanent peace.\n\n2. That no territorial settlement should be made that does not comply with the interests and advantages of the populations involved in the said settlement.\n\n3. That each well-defined nationality should see its aspirations realized in the fullest measure.\n\nMr. Speaker, looking over this Treaty from cover to cover, though we may perceive that these axioms were not always rigorously adhered to, can we not proclaim that it is through the instrumentality of these principles that new nations have come to life, endowed with the blessings of freedom, at last delivered from the yoke of oppression? Unfortunately, Sir, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that great as has been the advance in the right direction, there are still many flaws in this Treaty, regrettable omissions which we may hope soon to see remedied and adjusted. I am frank to admit that for myself I should have liked at this moment, when we are witnessing the births of nations, the resurrection of Poland, the transfer of Alsace-Lorraine to its rightful owners, to see also the final settlement of the Irish question. I only hope and pray that the bitterness engendered through centuries of struggle in that country may soon disappear through the influence of freedom, generously accorded to her people.\n\nThese, Mr. Speaker, are the three considerations which the study of this Treaty from its larger aspect have suggested to me.\n\nI now come to the last and most important point which I wish to raise, as many others have done who preceded me. Is it necessary for this Parliament to ratify this Treaty? What would be the consequence of our ratification or of our .abstaining from ratify-\n\nmg the Treaty? In what direction lies the surest safeguard of Canadian interests, which we are here to protect? These questions have been raised and fully discussed in the course of, this debate. I unhesitatingly range myself with those who have argued, to my mind so well and so conclusively, that ratification by this Parliament is unnecessary and that whatever may be our action in this House, the Treaty will remain unaffected. No amount of sophistry, from whatever quarter it is launched, can, in my opinion, effectively veil this truth: that in the authority within the British Empire to which belongs exclusively the right to declare war in the name of the Empire-the King and his constitutional advisers-is alone vested the power to make peace for that Empire. What, therefore, are the motives that have prompted this Government to such hasty action-to the calling of a special session to ratify a Treaty that needs no ratification by us? It is in the Covenant of the League of Nations, and especially in Article X, that we may find a reason for their action.\n\nI do not wish, Mr. Speaker, to he understood as being opposed to the principle of the League of Nations. I strongly believe that permanent peace cannot be hoped for without the closest co-operation between the democratic nations of the world. These nations are called upon to protect and to defend two principles: the principle of justice inherent in the aspirations of their people, and the principle, too often forgotten, of mutual respect among all nationalities. In the defence of these principles, and to better assure that peace and justice may in the future triumph in the world, we are now erecting a new organism representing alike nationalities and democracies-an organism which is embodied in the Covenant of the League of Nations. But, Sir, could we not have attained this same high purpose through other means than by those which bind this country in the future to abide by the decision of a Council in which we shall not be represented-a decision which may be so far-reaching in its consequences as to have the effect of dragging us into a war, of conscripting our young manhood and our wealth for the purpose of protecting the territorial integrity of other nations, and this without giving to our Parliament the right to deliberate and to decide on the merits of the case?\n\nThe Government, by forcing us to ratify a Treaty though no good can be derived from such action and though no necessity is apparent for it, are only taking advan-\n\ntage of the reluctance that a member may have to reject it on general grounds, in order that they may better pursue their old policy of imperialism in disguise-always ready to raise an altar to Canadian autonomy, but never failing to undermine in action what they so highly praise and proclaim in words.\n\nThis, Mr. Speaker, is the situation as it presents itself to me. It is grave and critical, endangering, as it does our future freedom of action. By the adoption of Article X we are stripping this Parliament of its most valued prerogative; we are placing the Canadian people at the beck and call of a Council not responsible to the nation for its actions. By one stroke of the pen we are mortgaging our freedom, receiving practically nothing in return.\n\nOur prospects under this arrangement are not bright. Let us at least comfort ourselves with the hope that the prophecy of President Poincare of France may yet be realized, when he said that \"real and permanent peace will not emerge from any single instrument of peace, but will be the outcome of a never-ceasing and collective effort on the part of the allied and associated powers.\"\n\nMr. FRANK B. STACEY (Fraser Valley): Mr. Speaker, as I recall the words of the hon. gentleman who leads the Opposition (Mr. McKenzie) in his opening remarks this afternoon, with regard to what should he the characteristics and qualifications of those who take part in this debate, I assure you that it is with the greatest hesitation that I rise to offer any observations whatever upon the subject which is occupying the attention of this House.\n\nWhen Parliament assembled a week ago I had no intention of making any remarks upon this subject. I mistakenly assumed that the language of the document which we are now considering would be couched in legal and technical phraseology and that an ordinary man would have difficulty in understanding it and should, perhaps be silent when the time for discussion came.\n\nBut I found that what is, to my mind, the very heart of the document was capable of interpretation by an ordinary layman or workingman like myself. While I do not presume to discuss the question from the standpoint of its constitutionality, I purpose offering some observations as to the Treaty, especially that part of it called the Covenant of the League of Nations, as it appeals to the ordinary man, to the .man in the street, to the man who is not versed in the technicalities of legal inspection and\n\ndiscussion, But as it is, I believe, regarded by the great majority of ordinary men and women who are interested in knowing something about the real, practical meaning of this Covenant of the League of Nations. I shall not pretend nor attempt to speak respecting the Treaty of Peace itself.\n\nIt strikes me-and I believe it appeals in this way to hundreds of thousands of our citizens-that after five years of agony, heartaches, carnage and immeasurable destruction, the allied nations conceived an idea, that grew into a plan, which was finally formulated into a document, which gives greater promise and 'hope of a lasting peace in this world than has ever before been seen or known by men in the long and chequered history of humanity. The preamble itself is a remarkable and striking statement, a tribute alike to the high spirit of the signatories, and, under the circumstances, to their magnanimity as victors.\n\nI shall presume to offer a few remarks on the article that has been referred to so frequently, not only this evening, but on previous occasions, namely, Article 10. As I have intimated, I have not had a legal training. I do not pretend to read into this Treaty possible difficulties; I do not pretend to be able to discuss the constitutional difficulties which may arise, which are possibly real and genuine and which this nation may have to face in the future. But I remember this, that objection has1 been taken to Article 10 by hon. gentlemen opposite because its .provisions may involve us in conflicts in some far-away section of Europe, or in some distant portion of South America. We must not forget to-day that the world is very small, so small that Jules Verne's book has long since been thrown into the bonfire, and it is quite possible that there are within this Chamber hon. gentlemen who themselves may voyage around the world in less than eight days. All those manifestations and conditions which obtained a generation ago are changed. If distance is to be measured by time, the Atlantic ocean is not any larger than some of our great Canadian lakes used to be. Why should not Canada have a place in the League of Nations? During half a century or more we have grown out of a national infancy and childhood and youth into a young manhood; we have been under the protection of the great Mother Country, and there is, I am sure, no disposition on the part of any one to-day to 9 p.m. break with England. She has, in *a sense, led us by the hand until now, reaching the stage of manhood, we\n\nare, I trust, prepared to take our place beside her, shoulder to shoulder, in every great plan which looks towards the peace, prosperity and happiness of the world. Hon. members opposite have to-day been searching the pages o.f history to ascertain some precedent for the action that is now proposed to be taken. As I see it, we are not reviewing history, we are making history; we are not following precedents, we are establishing precedents. And, why should we not, as a self-governing nation, be prepared, at this stage in our history, to assume our place and take our full measure of responsibility at this critical time in the history of the world?\n\nIn my province, which province by the way sent more than 10 per cent of her total population to the front, there were, during the course of the war-I regret to say this, but I want to be honest-a few men who apparently did not realize the duties of citizenship. True they claimed and desired all the privileges of citizenship in my province; they claimed the right to the franchise; they sought the protection of the British navy and also, the protection of the allied forces, including the protection of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. But for one reason or another they did not enlist. Sometimes they had a fluttering around the heart; sometimes they thought they had a flatfoot, and occasionally we found them obsessed with the idea that they needed a change of climate. For the benefit of their health or for the advantage of their pocket, they concluded that a trip across the line to the 'south would be of advantage to them, and so they went. At any late, they failed to join up, and we had in our province a few men who, while they desired all the privileges of citizenship, refused to assume the responsibilities of citizenship.\n\nI fear lest there may be some spirit akin to the foregoing in the action of those gentlemen here or elsewhere who would like to have the full protection afforded this country by the ratification of the Treaty of Peace, including the League of Nations and including Article X-who would like to have all the advantages and all the privileges, without assuming the responsibilities and obligations which are embodied in that article. It was very aptly pointed out by the hon. member for Megan-tic (Mr. Pacaud), if I mistake not, that this proposition is the application of the idea and principle of co-operation-national co-operation. This is true. I cannot conceive of the Canadian Parliament or the\n\nCanadian people refusing to approve of the Treaty of Peace, especially with regard to this Covenant of the League of Nations. The preamble, I may say, is a marvellous introduction to a state paper that will take its place by the side of any state paper in the annals of human history. I shall read two or three sentences:\n\nIn order to promote international co-operation and to achieve international peace and security -by the acceptance of obligations not to resort to war.\n\nI call attention to the three succeeding clauses:\n\nBy the prescription of open, just and honourable relations between nations; by the firm establishment of the understandings of international law as the actual rule of conduct among governments; and by the maintenance of justice and the scrupulous respect of all Treaty obligations in the dealings of organized peoples with one another.\n\nAs I understand it, Mr. Speaker, these three last clauses that I have read contain the very reasons which led 32,000 of our young men five years ago to rush to Val-cartier. These three clauses give the reason why, a little later in the dark and awful days of the four years that followed, over half a million more of their brothers and sisters went to their aid. The reason is found in this preamble. There is no additional reason to be ascertained; it lies here and here alone. But the words of this preamble are words and only words. They are great words; they will be historic words, and will ever be read as an expression of high statesmanship and of splendid ideas.; but they are words only. The essence, the acid test of this preamble, is found in Article X. You cannot make use of the preamble legitimately, reasonably, logically, without also accepting Article X. 1 believe in my heart, Sir, that it would be an example of the very personification of audacity for any man or any Parliament to say: \"We refuse to approve of Article X,\" and then have the nerve to proceed to approve of the remaining two hundred pages. In the days of. the future should the storm break over our heads or over the head of some other small nation, we are united in our aim to speedily bring the struggle to an end and protect the weaker nation. I claim that there is a greater probability, amounting almost to a certainty, of actual peace than could possibly be secured without the provisions of Article X. And should the storm break and troubles come, then we are prepared to do our share. I take it, Mr. Speaker, that Article X of this Covenant means in\n\nsubstance, in commonplace phraseology stripped of all legal technicalities, that we believe in peace and want peace. It means that we want peace ourselves and want peace for all nations of the world; and because we want it and because we bate war, we are willing to co-operate with other nations in keeping the world's peace so far as may be humanly possible. Is it not reasonable and sane, iand comparatively sure, that with these provisions and with these ideas there is greater probability of peace than if we and all others refused to say \"We shall bind ourselves together in the joint interests of humanity.\" Moreover, is it not a laudable aim for any young nation just entering upon its maturity to ally itself with the very highest civilization of the globe in its determination to be, in a very broad sense, the safeguard and advocate of the peace and prosperity and liberty of the world?\n\nThere is one view of this question that has not been presented to this House. It may not, strictly speaking, be involved in the letter of the Treaty, indeed, I am willing to admit, that it is not; but it appears to me to be a question of very great and serious import. And not only in my humbly judgment but, I believe, in the judgment of the great bulk of the citizens of Canada the question is agitating their minds: They are thinking and speaking about the matter which I am going to venture to introduce to this- House now.\n\nI shall assume that this Parliament will ratify the Treaty of Peace; I shall assume that otir country is entering upon a new era, upon a new and larger life. She has won by the valour of her sons upon the battle field and by the statesmanship of her legislators in the councils of the nations a very high place in the world's record of great deeds. The world over the magic word Canada\" upon the shoulder straps of every Canadian soldier from the humblest private to General Sir Arthur Currie, has been both the pride of the wearer and the admiration, if not indeed the envy, of every observer. With these facts and results behind us, and with a future that one can hardly overestimate ahead of us, and entering now upon a larger national life my problem is: How shall we the Canadian people so relate ourselves to the new conditions and to the new national life to ensure that our country will become not merely great in population or in wealth, but in all those higher attributes of mind and spirit which alone are the assured factors in national prosperity? This, Sir, is the question that has been in my mind and\n\nwhich is in the minds, I have reason to believe, of our best citizens and I believe also, although not expressed as yet, in the minds of the members of this House.\n\nWhere is the Canadian citizen who has not been thrilled, who has not even been moved to tears at the recital of deeds of unparalleled heroism by our soldiers overseas? And of equal courage and matchless devotion of our daughters as they have taken their places in ministering to the needs of those who have been wounded? How can we, I repeat, in view of all these things, so relate ourselves to the future that we shall be equal to the increased responsibilities and obligations which are resting upon us as a nation? If there is any phrase or single sentence that better embodies or suggests the answer to my query than another, it is this: The character and the development of our Canadian citizenship. I am well aware of the fact that this is neither the time nor the place to discuss that question at length, but I shall venture to give a few moments to it because of the reasons I have assigned.\n\nIf I might express in the most general terms my appreciation of the character and the qualities suggested in the term \" Canadian citizenship \" I would do it by referring to four main factors which contribute to such a true and desirable Canadian citizenship. First, in our homes we shall be compelled through youthful inquiries in the future to lay greater emphasis upon patriotic principles and the relation of the family to national life than we found it necessary to do prior to 1914.\n\nThen there is the Canadian press. I suppose that in referring to it I am treading upon sacred ground-or otherwise.. I cannot help but feel that, notwithstanding the very efficient service rendered by the Canadian press to Canadian ideals and to the true spirit of Canadian citizenship, there is one thing that I would fain see changed and changed for the better. I do not think that the cynical spirit sometimes continued almost to exaggeration by the press is conducive to the development of the highest type of Canadian citizenship and ideals. I come to another factor that enters vitally into the character and development of our Canadian citizenship and that. Sir, is found in our school system. We are coming to a day of change. The best citizens behind our public schools realize . that mistakes have been made in the past and that some change is necessary. Throughout this land there is an idea that the day is not far distant when the passing of an examination\n\nwill not be regarded as the be-all and end-all of our public school life. Greater attention must be given to the expression of the individual as a factor in our national life. But speaking of our educational work as a great factor in our national life, I place special emphasis upon the opportunities and obligations of our Canadian colleges.\n\nI do riot now refer to the technical institution which furnishes our country with experts either industrial, economic, professional or scientific. I have in mind the college of liberal arts whether for ladies exclusively or the university course for both sexes leading to the Bachelor's degree. These institutions are in the main turning out not professors or scientific or economic experts but citizens who will take their place in the ordinary ranks of domestic or commercial life, but who, by reason of their extraordinary educational advantages, should be more than ordinary citizens. That is to say, the main objective of the college of liberal arts should not be scholarship but citizenship. The latter must become the goal, the former, a means of reaching it. Our country's future will be largely determined by the ideals of citizenship inspiring our people. The great opportunity and business of the college and university is to project upon society broadminded, or rather spacious-minded, men and women, well-balanced and sane, who will become big citizens. Our country's supreme need to-day, to-morrow and for all time, is not so much bright scholars as big citizens. We need more bigger, broader, better citizens, and the college system or curriculum which fails to produce the goods must either be changed or ultimately go to the scrap heap. The citizen does not exist for the college, but the college for the citizen. Education is of real value only as it qualifies for, and results in, good citizenship. Many a good citizen has never had a college life, but a good citizen is always a truly educated man, nevertheless. Perhaps I can best explain my meaning by the following illustration: A\n\nfew weeks ago I ran across a man in my province who, from the standpoint of the schools, would be called an uneducated man. In fact, Sir, he himself claimed to be an uneducated man and deplored the fact most sincerely and heartily. But I found that he could give me the name and the characteristics of every plant that grew in that district. He could tell me the names and describe the uses of all the trees in that section of the country. If a bird flew by or alighted upon a tree he could\n\ntell me its name and give me all its characteristics. If he saw the footprint of an animal on the ground he could tell me its name and describe its habits-in fact, he was a reliable authority on the entire flora and fauna of that district, and yet he claimed to be an uneducated man. As I said, from the standpoint of the schools, he was uneducated. He knew little of mathematics, less of literature, I doubt if he could spell the word \"philosophy,\" and he thought he knew nothing of science. Moreover, Sir, he was a good citizen, inasmuch as he took his part in the great war faithfully and well. And last June, when the whole of the West between the Bed river and the Pacific was threatened with an incipient Soviet revolution resulting in some of its leaders being imprisoned and not, as the hon. the leader of the Opposition described the other day as being driven to prison because they were labour leaders-far from it, and let me say that the records of the courts have vindicated the position I took here last June and take here to-night-during that unsettled month this man acted as a steadying force in the community. He counselled against rocking the boat. He was a sort of moral and social anchor during the troublous times of last June. He counselled quietness, and steadiness, while some so-called scholars counselled otherwise. That man, Sir, was a good citizen, and from the standpoint of Canadian citizenship well-educated, although from the viewpoint of the schools, he would not perhaps, in the past at least, be so designated. My argument comes to this point: that our university life must so shape itself to meet the demands of the coming generation that the great aim of every college of liberal art in this Dominion, from ocean to ocean, would be nothing less than to turn out the very highest type of Canadian citizenship that can be produced within its walls. This man to whom I refer, I think, illustrated better than any one I have ever met the thought that was given expression to by John Milton two hundred and fifty years ago, and I doubt if his definition has ever been excelled, when he said:\n\nI call therefore a complete and generous education that which enables a man to perform justly, skilfully, and magnanimously, all the offices, public and private, both in peace and war.\n\nNow, I come to discuss, for a few moments only, another factor, another great force, in the creation of a right ideal of Canadian citizenship. I have briefly\n\ntouched upon the home, more briefly upon the press, and perhaps at greater length upon the college. But, Sir, there is still another factor which plays a most important part in the development of that type of citizenship which will enable us as a people and as a nation to take our place and maintain it in the days to come through the new relations that are put upon us. I refer, Sir, to the influence, and the power, and the work of the church. The college man says a good citizen must be an educated citizen. I agree with him, I accept his statement. The church-man will say a good citizen must be a Christian citizen. I do not deny the statement, I am inclined to agree with him. iBut, Sir, I believe this country has come to realize that notwithstanding all they have done in the past the churches of this land must lay more stress, more time, and more energy, upon those means which tend towards the development of a high ideal of Christian citizenship. That church, individual or denominational, will take its place in the Canadian life which, in the largest degree promotes a true and strong citizenship, and not very much longer will there attach to the cloth as such any special recognition or any inherent authority in the social world.\n\nThe churches of our realm have done a grand work for the Empire during the past four or five years; but they have a greater work to do from ocean to ocean in seeking upon all occasions to inject into the minds of their people the paramount importance of Canadian citizenship. I said a few moments ago that the college existed for the citizen, and not the citizen for the college. I go further and say that the church exists for the citizen, and not the citizen for the church. That church will take its place and do its work that sets before its people the highest type of true Canadian citizenship. It is not the cut or the colour of the leader's garb that to-day has or to-morrow will have any influence along the line of real leadership. It is not what is below a man's collar that makes for citizenship, but what is above it. What is above it is of prime importance; what is below vit is of very minor importance.\n\nThe ratification of this Treaty of Peace, including the Covenant of the League, of Nations, Mr. Speaker, will take place, I believe. That means that we are entering upon a new era with a new and a larger life. Our responsibilities are great, our obligations are heavy, but our resources are\n\nalmost boundless. With faith in our future and with confidence in one another and with a sincere purpose to give the very-best that is in us to our country and to posterity, I believe that we can and will not only take our place but maintain that position in the world's great League of Nations.\n\nOn the motion of Hon.

T. PACAUD (Megantic):\n\nMr. Speaker, the debate, through the speeches which have already been made, has rohbed me of arguments which I intended to offer the House, and I shall therefore willingly curtail my remarks somewhat.\n\nThe question of the food supply which is raised by this motion involves considerations which are of the utmost importance both to our country and to our Allies. No other question, Sir, has stirred and aroused the people of Canada more fervently, moire deeply or more unanimously. This intense feeling which has been growing and spreading steadily since the outbreak of war may easily be explained by an impartial survey of conditions as they have existed and still exist in Canada at this time. On the one hand we have the prohibitive prices, which deny to the masses the very necessaries of life, with the accompanying hardships and misery. On the other hand we have the revolting disclosures that have been made from time to time concerning the hoarding of food, the cold storage opera-1SJ\n\ntions, the nefarious greed of the profiteers. These, Sir, are the outstanding facts which cannot he denied. Mr. O'Connor has exposed them to the public. We had the story of the bacon manipulations; we had the egg disclosures; and more recently, and through another source, we heard of hundreds and hundreds of pounds of chicken left to rot in cold storage at Winnipeg. I hese may serve as illustrations of what i3 going on in Canada on a very large scale. Sir, in the face of such disclosures, nothing effective was done or attempted to be done by the Government to remedy snch an evil. Are we not tempted, Sir, to laud the patience of the Canadian people in the face of euch provocation from the men who daily exploit them', from the Government who refuses to protect them?\n\nWhat has the Government done? A Food Board was created and a Food Controller was put in control. The Order in Council creating this board gave the Controller clearly defined powers. He had the right \" to govern the prices of any article of food and to supervise the storage, .the distribution, the sale and the delivery of these articles.\" Why were not these powers exercised, exercised especially in the cases which have been brought to the attention of the public by the High Cost of Living Commissioner?\n\nInstead of taking immediate steps to curtail this open exploitation of the public, the Government, through its commissioner, preferred to follow the easier course of preaching economy to the people. Under the circumstances which I have related, I say that these mere words, followed by no effective action, may have satisfied the cold storage magnates, but they certainly have not satisfied the people of this country.\n\nWe have in Canada an abundance of food, sufficient not only for our own needs, but the greater bulk of which is exported to allied countries. This brings me to another phase of this same question-the campaign of production which the Government has so fervently prosecuted of late. To this campaign all loyal Canadians will give their hearty support. We all recognize that upon the success of our devotion to food raising depends in a large measure the victory of our hoys at the front. We -know that the world faces to-day a food situation which is nothing short of appalling. We know that the supply is not sufficient to feed the world's armies, let alone the civilian population. But, Sir, this is not all. We have had occasion ^ to hear the representatives of. Britain making to us an appeal,-\n\nan appeal which will surely be heard and responded to, and which has thrilled each one of us in a patriotic determination to strive every nerve to do what is requested of us. Lord Rhondda, the British food controller, for one, has made his plea quite clear. \"We look,\" he says, \"to the resources of Canada and the indomitable energy of Canadians for an answer that will shatter Germany's threat of starvation.\" He tells us, that it is vital for the United Kingdom and the Allies to obtain from Canada foodstuffs in far larger quantities than under peace conditions. His frankness even goes so far as to recall to us that an increased export of food supplies must be forthcoming, even though the achievement of this task entails diversion of,effort from other enterprises. It is Canada's duty to prove her efficiency and her determination. This plea must not be left unanswered. May I be permitted to confess that these words of the British food controller are comforting to those of us who through motives which cannot be challenged, opposed a measure which wre sincerely believed if put into operation would decidedly diminish if not defeat our effectiveness in this war, by laying aside the most formidable weapon which could have been used against the enemy. We faced a storm of abuse and slander, but these attacks did not deter us from what we believed was our plain duty. We have at least the consolation of knowing that our conception of duty was shared, in some measure at least, by the brightest minds of Britain. What we need to-day, is a larger acreage and higher yields for the years to come. We need to increase our productive capacity, the problem is with us, and it must be solved. Upon its solution, to my mind, depends the success of our allies and ourselves in this war. To achieve our purpose, it is obvious that we need farm labour. It is not less obvious that it is a national necessity that we should remove the duties on farming implements. The Government have started in their task by means of the registration of the man power of the Dominion. I believe that, though that is a good step in the right direction, it has come a little late; it should have been done at the very beginning of the war. Nevertheless, I sincerely hope, that in its results it may procure more information and attain better results for Canada and for the Empire than has been achieved by the now famous National Service cards of a year ago.\n\nMr. J. IE. FONTAINE (Hull) (translation) : Mr. Speaker, I am perhaps a little\n\naudacious in rising to take part in this debate, since I have just entered this Parliament, and am in nowise familiar with Parliamentary procedure; nevertheless,\n\nwhen the voters of Hull county, which I have the honour to represent, elected me by acclamation on the 19th of last November,\n\nI gave them my solemn promise that I would seize upon every opportunity offered to protest against the exorbitant cost of living and try to bring it down if it were possible to do so. It was reserved, Mr. Speaker, for the right hon. leader of the Opposition, to afford me this opportunity in bringing about this debate this afternoon; for him who, in contrast to the hon. gentlemen seated on the other side of the House, has always been the protector and the defender of the people against the trusts and the monopolists.\n\nIt is useless, I believe, for me to say that the present cost of living has reached a price so high that the consumer is forced ti deprive himself even of necessaries of life. I could mention things, foods like flour, bacon, eggs, which have surely increased 50 and even 100 per cent. If, at least, Mr. Speaker, salaries had increased in proportion; but I see, by the reports of the Labour Gazette which I have here before me, that salaries have not been increased by more than 15 to 17i per cent. There has been a general protest. I remember, in the city of Hull, where I reside, on the other side of Ottawa, hearing Mr. Watters, the president of the Labour Unions of Canada, denounce the Minister of Labour (Mr.'Crothers) and even denounce the Prime Minister of this country because the workingmen could not procure the necessaries of life with the low salaries they were paid.\n\nIn the face of these protests the Government thought they would calm public opinion by appointing what they called a Food Controller, and it was then that the Government told us of the appointment of Mr. Hanna. Everybody was satisfied, the people believed that the .Government was sincere and that by their appointing a Food Controller we could at least earn enough to enable us to buy the necessaries of life. The irony of it, Mr. Speaker ! The Controller was well and duly appointed; he was given spacious offices, and it is said that his suite was furnished with luxury and that he was given a staff, both very numerous and very expensive-if I believe the gentlemen who have preceded me-and still he was not controlling; the cost of living was soaring all the time.\n\nA moment ago I heard my hon. friend, the Minister of Customs, say that the appoint-\n\nment of the Controller did not aim at control. My iLord! we were well aware of it, he never did control! His duty consisted simply in seeing that no food was wasted. Could he have forgotten what my hon. friend from Meg-antic (Mr. Pacaud) said a while ago? Haven't we learned, in the last few days, through the newspapers, that a large ..quantity of foodstuffs, hoarded in storage warehouses in order to boost prices, had been sent to the incinerator in the city of Winnipeg? Well! if the duty of the Food Controller was to prevent the waste of foodstuffs, why did he allow such .an enormous quantity of food to find its way to the garbage heap? Is it because those implicated are the friends of the Government? I ask you that, Mr. Speaker."}, {"url": "https://www.lipad.ca/members/record/68071fca-03f2-4f7c-b33c-2ed63bb08327/5/", "page_content": "1.
