J. Edgar Hoover, the Chief of the BOI, continued in his office and became the first Director of the FBI. The FBI's responsibility is to \"detect and prosecute crimes against the United States\".\n\nIn 1942, when he was merely 7 years old, due to World War II, automobile production in the United States was stopped on February 1st. A tire rationing program had begun the month before. Detroit - the main hub of car manufacturing - was ordered to free up assembly lines for military production. The president of the Automobile Manufacturers Association said \u201cThe automotive industry is in this war all the way\". Some dealerships had to close and others expanded their repair shops. The used car market boomed (as did a black market in used cars).\n\nIn 1957, he was 22 years old when on October 4th, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik I, the first man made earth-orbiting satellite - and triggered the Space Race. Sputnik I was only 23 inches in diameter and had no tracking equipment, only 4 antennas, but it had a big impact.\n\nIn 1963, Ronald was 28 years old when on November 22nd, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson became the 36th President of the United States when President John Kennedy was shot and killed in Dallas, Texas. Johnson was sworn in on the plane carrying Kennedy's body back to Washington D.C.\n\nIn 1997, in the year of Ronald J Meagher's passing, on July 1st, Hong Kong was returned to China. In 1898, Great Britain was awarded Hong Kong for 99 years. In a subsequent agreement, China agreed to allow Hong Kong to remain capitalist. So the handing over of the area ended British rule but did not change the economic system of Hong Kong."}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Ron_Meagher", "page_content": "What we do.

Now aged 65, he has published a book on his life growing up in Irish America. \u201cRolling Up the Rug: An American-Irish Story\u201d is available on Amazon.\n\nThis is the first chapter of his tale:\n\nThe fall of 1961. I am with my father. He has returned to his homeland for the first time after 35 years in America. The two of us stand silently under a sullen Irish sky in the high, dry grass among the fallen stones of the old country farmhouse in County Sligo where he was born and raised. He is quiet for a long time. As he leads me down a deserted dirt road, he shakes his head slowly, \"You see that crossroads, Mick?\u201d He points, \u201cOh, the life that used to be had there of a Sunday morning after Mass, the boys and girls, the laughter, the flipping of coins, and the gambling, and my own father among them. Those good times \u2014 all gone.\"\n\nGood times \u2014 but not good enough to keep my father from leaving the land of his birth. In 1928, a year before the depression, at age 22, he boarded the USS California at the port of County Derry and landed in New York City where he spent the rest of his life. The woman he married, my mother, Mamie Gallagher, had arrived in New York one year before him. At age 16, she was the oldest of five children when she left her family's small farm in County Leitrim. She said good-bye forever. She never saw her parents again.\n\nMy father was an Irish fiddler. My mother sang songs in a lilting, operatic voice. They were the life of every gathering, and they threw many a party themselves. When I think back to my parents and the apartment where they raised my brother, sister, and me all those years ago, I think first about the parties.\n\nSign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Subscribe to IrishCentral\n\nA Saturday morning in the early 1950s. Mom and Pop begin moving the couch, chairs, and tables from the living room into the kids\u2019 bedroom. Getting down on their knees in the living room, they begin the ritual that truly signals a night of music and dancing: rolling up the rug. With grunts and pushes and lots of, \"Easy does it there!\" they hoist the big well-worn, maroon patterned rug and banish it to the bedroom for the night. They then rim the bare living room with bridge chairs rented for the occasion \u2014 and the room transforms into a tiny dance hall.\n\nLater, my mother shops for a big ham, cold cuts, potato and macaroni salads and coleslaw from the German delicatessen. At the Jewish bakery, she buys several loaves of seeded rye bread, marble cake, and macaroon cookies. The local beer distributor delivers a keg of beer that is hauled up the five flights of stairs and set up on its side in the kitchen sink with a spigot attached for the pouring. Bottles of Four Roses and Canadian Club whiskey stand ready on the kitchen table to be mixed later with ginger ale for \"high balls.\"\n\nBy evening the men and women arrive decked out in their best. Most of the Irish who lived in and around our neighborhood of Highbridge had come to America in the 1920s in a wave of immigration after Ireland gained independence. Like, my mother and father, they were mostly from the farms in the west of Ireland from counties Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Clare, Leitrim, Donegal, Roscommon, Longford, Cavan, Cork, and Kerry.\n\nThe women come bustling into our little apartment all perfumed, powdered, and corseted into dresses dotted with rhinestones. The men in starched white shirts with wide ties tightly knotted, their faces shiny, clean-shaven and smiling. Their big, ham-fisted-laboring-man hands extend in greeting, often crushing a dollar bill into the little hand of the boy who carries their coats and fedoras off to the bedroom.\n\nIrishCentral History Love Irish history?

It is always the same lilting melody: \"The Stack of Barley\" \u2014 the original Irish tune that gave birth to America's \"Turkey in the Straw.\" At once, men and women are up on the little-improvised dance floor swinging each other, laughing, dancing and whooping. They stomp the bare floor of our little living room while others stand around clapping their hands, tapping their feet, shouting encouragement. My father's elbow gyrates madly on the fiddle, his left foot tapping the floor to the driving rhythm of the music. Highland flings lead into an Irish hopped-up version of the \"Verse of Vienna,\" followed by set dances and old-time waltzes. And one special night, as the fiddle and accordion music floats out our window onto the steamy summer night air, my Aunt Margaret \u2013 in a pink satin dress, her curly blond hair piled high on her head \u2013 leads the entire crowd around every room of the apartment in a Conga line that goes on forever.\n\nLater in the evening, they settle down to sing. Happily crammed together into our little Bronx apartment, these country people \u2013 now transformed into hard-working New Yorkers \u2013 begin to recall the quiet beauties of the land they left behind. They sing of the valleys, streams, and meadows of their youth:\n\nCome by the hills to the land where fancy is free,\n\nAnd stand where the peaks reach the sky\n\nAnd the rocks meet the sea.\n\nThen my mother sings:\n\nLast night I had a pleasant dream,\n\nI woke up with a smile.\n\nI dreamt that I was home again\n\nIn dear old Erin's Isle.\n\nFor most of those people in the room, going home again to Ireland remained only a dream.\n\nThey sing funny songs too about Eliza's two big feet and of Paddy McGinty's Goat \u2013 famous for eating up all of Kate's \"folderols\" on her wedding night. And then, always towards the end, my mother and father sing \"their\" song together. She in her chair, her hands in her lap, a big, white smile on her face, him standing beside her, his hand resting on her shoulder, the roomful of friends in rapt attention, knowing well the song about to be sung:\n\nWhen you and I were seventeen,\n\nLife was but a dream\n\nThe world was just a field of green\n\nAnd you my charming queen\n\nOh, do you recall\n\nWhen love was all\n\nAnd we were seventeen.\n\nIn the glow of such moments, my ten-year-old self wishes that nobody will go home, the lights will never go out, nothing will ever change, and nobody will ever die.\n\n*\u201cRolling Up the Rug: An American-Irish Story\u201d is available here.\n\n*Originally published in February 2015, updated in April 2023."}]}
