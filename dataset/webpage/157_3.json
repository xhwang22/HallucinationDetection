{"John Cameron was reelected in the 1926 Alberta general election.": [{"url": "https://wiki.alquds.edu/?query=1926_Alberta_general_election", "page_content": "The 1926 Alberta general election was held on June 28, 1926, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. The United Farmers of Alberta government that had first been elected in 1921 was re-elected, taking a majority of the seats in the Alberta Legislature. Herbert Greenfield had resigned as United Farmers leader and premier, and John E. Brownlee led the UFA to this second election victory, increasing the UFA's number of seats.\n\nThe writs of election were issued on May 10, 1926, allowing an election period of 40 days.\n\n1926 was Alberta's first general election where Single transferable voting (STV) was used in the three largest cities and Instant-runoff voting was used everywhere else.A Report on Alberta Elections 1905-1982\n\nCalgary, Edmonton and Medicine Hat continued to be multi member districts. Edmonton elected five members; Calgary elected five members; and Medicine Hat elected two. Previously they had elected members by Plurality block voting. Now they elected members using STV-PR, which at the time was called the Hare Proportional representation system.A Report on Alberta Elections 1905-1982\n\nOutside the large cities, districts were single member districts and MLAs were elected under Alternative Voting system. Rural voters, like their city counterparts, cast preferential ballots and had ability to rank the candidates. The seat was filled by the candidate who received a majority of the votes whether through first-choice votes or a combination of first-choice votes and votes transferred from less-popular candidates.[2] This was the first election in Canada (and in North America) where all the members were elected through non-plurality voting systems.\n\nThis dual system of voting would last until 1956. Medicine Hat after 1926 changed to a single-member constituency, whose MLA was elected through Alternative Voting.\n\nUnder STV in Edmonton, the UFA captured one seat in Edmonton where it had taken no seats in 1921 under the Liberal government's Block Voting system. The Labour party also for the first time elected an MLA in Edmonton. As well, Edmonton voters elected a Liberal and two Conservatives. This mixed crop of representatives was much better balanced than the single-party sweeps that Edmonton had previously elected through other electoral systems.\n\nThe UFA also took a great share of the rural seats, taking 42 of the province's 49 rural seats. It took four rural seats that had been captured by Liberal candidates in 1921 (Beaver River, Leduc, Sedgewick and Whitford), and one that had been won by an Independent in 1921 (Claresholm). The UFA also won the district of Empress formerly known as Redcliffe, which had been won by the UFA in 1921. No UFA candidate ran for re-election to its seat in Medicine Hat. It gained a seat in the newly created next-door Cypress district. It also lost its St. Albert seat.\n\nThe UFA derived no benefit from Alternative Voting - it would have won all but one of the seats it won under Alternative Voting if the contest had been conducted using Plurality voting. And it lost one seat that it would have won if the contest had been held using Plurality voting (in Bow Valley).\n\nConservatives, being a less popular party, had been badly treated under FPTP and Block Voting in 1921 but now did better. It won two seats each in Edmonton and Calgary, where Block Voting had been replaced by STV.\n\nAt the time of the election call, six seats were sitting vacant. They had been vacated by MLAs who had run in the 1925 federal election. MLA C.W. Cross was elected in the federal election. William McCartney Davidson, Calgary Independent MLA, was another one of those who had left. [3]\n\nThe UFA vote share went up 10 percent in this election compared to 1921. This shows effect of the change in voting system - the UFA actually received 15,000 fewer votes in 1926 than in 1921. The Liberals received 54,000 fewer. The change in percentage of UFA support is likely more a result of urban voters not being allowed to cast multiple voters as they had done in 1921. That had artificially raised the Liberal vote count and percentage and had lowered the UFA percentage recorded for the 1921 election.\n\nIn 1926 the UFA vote count outside the cities was 69,000, having gone down from the 81,000 the party's candidates had received outside the cities in 1921. The UFA's vote total was about 50 percent of the first-preference votes cast outside the cities. Through transfers it received a majority of votes in each of the 42 districts where its candidate won.[4]\n\nUnder STV Edmonton elected a mixed bag of representatives. UFA, Liberal, Conservative and Labour MLAs were all elected, which compared well with the total sweep that Liberals made in 1921 under Block Voting.\n\nIn Calgary Conservative supporters found representation under STV where they had been shut out under Block Voting in 1921.\n\nUnder STV in Medicine Hat, a Liberal and a Conservative took the city's two seats - which was fair as the two parties had about equal support there.\n\nUnder Alternative Voting outside the cities, if no candidate took a majority of votes in the first count, votes were transferred until a candidate acceptable to a majority of the voters was determined. In Bow Valley the UFA candidate leading in the first count did not have as much support from Conservative supporters and a Liberal took the seat.\n\nIn four districts only two candidates ran so vote transfers were not needed. Three-way contests would be a feature of most elections from here on in, as Canada had passed the point when only two parties dominated politics. Labour and farmer parties were here to stay to fight it out against the two old-line parties.\n\nIn fifteen of the province's 49 rural districts, three or more candidates ran and vote-splitting meant no one candidate took a majority of the votes on the first count. A UFA candidate was in the top spot in most of these contests. Liberal and Conservative party supporters were split on whether to support the other old-line party or the UFA, if their candidate was eliminated and their ballots able to be transferred to another. In many cases many Conservative and Liberal back-up preferences were marked for the UFA candidate, and in eight of those 15 districts the UFA candidate who had been leading in the first count won the seat, in three the Liberal leading was elected in the end, and in two the Labour candidate was leading and elected in the end.\n\nThe only turn-overs where the candidate leading in the first count was not elected were in Bow Valley and Pincher Creek. In Pincher Creek, back-up preferences on votes at first placed on the Conservative candidate favoured the UFA candidate, who took the seat over the previously-leading Liberal candidate. In Bow Valley, vote transfers from the Conservative candidate went mostly to the Liberal, who passed the UFA candidate in popularity. Overall party-wise the two turn-overs cancelled each other but two different individuals were elected due to the Alternative Voting system than would have been elected under FPTP.\n\nThe UFA's seat majority was due to its victories in the rural areas. Its moral right to power rested on the fact that to be elected in a rural district a candidate had to have support from a majority of a district's voters. The UFA was elected through majority support in 42 of the province's 52 districts, and its candidate in Edmonton was the most popular of all the candidates who ran there as well.[5]\n\nResults [ edit ]\n\nPopular vote United Farmers 39.68% Liberal 26.17% Conservative 22.10% Labour 7.79% Others 4.26%\n\nSeats summary United Farmers 71.67% Liberal 11.67% Labour 8.33% Conservative 6.67% Ind.

The shortest time period was between 1872 and 1874 but then 1925 and 1926 came along.\n\nWhy did these elections come so quickly after each other? Well, it all came down to a minority government, a decision by a Governor General, and some crafty political maneuvering.\n\nFor the past four years, the Liberal government of William Lyon Mackenzie King had held onto through an alliance with the Progressives, due to its slim majority. The Conservatives had fallen to third in the 1921 election, but were the Official Opposition after the Progressives turned down the role.\n\nThe next election was not scheduled until December of 1926, but all of that would change when a budget vote was voted down in Parliament in September of 1925. King was not expecting this turn of events, but it would trigger the election one year early.\n\nThe previous four years had been boom years for Canada. There was elation in the decade following the First World War as the Jazz Age began. Not all Canadians enjoyed the good times, with many labourers and farmers dealing with tough times.\n\nAs was the case in 1921, Arthur Meighen and the Conservatives pushed a high tariff policy that was supported by the manufacturing firms of Ontario and Quebec. King, taking a line from the Progressives to court their voters, supported reduced tariffs accomplished over time. Progressives, who represented the Canadian West for the most part, wanted little to no tariffs to help labourers and farmers.\n\nIn the leadup to the election, King promised low tariffs and good relations between English and French Canada, which was a major issue at the time, almost a decade after the Conscription Crisis.\n\nDuring the four years leading up to 1925, Meighen had not sat around doing nothing. He had focused on rebuilding the Conservative Party, which had been decimated in the 1921 election. He especially focused on rebuilding in Quebec, while also focusing on the Maritimes and Ontario. Due to his belief that high tariffs were good for the country, he knew that he had essentially lost the Canadian West before the election was even held.\n\nOn election day, it was expected that it would be the largest amount of voters going to the polls in Canadian history. In places such as Victoria, cars were being loaned to electors to help get people out to vote. Even Premier Oliver loaned his car to party workers after he voted early in the morning. There was also betting that the Liberals would take the election.\n\nIn the election on Oct. 29, 1925, the Conservatives bounced back with a gain of 66 seats to finish with 115, eight short of a majority. This made Arthur Meighen prime minister once again, a role he had from 1920 to 1921. Sorry, I should correct, that, it made him Prime Minister, technically. What do I mean? I will get to that.\n\nKing and the Liberals lost 18 seats to finish with 100, while the Progressives collapsed and lost 36 seats to finish with 22. The Conservatives took the majority of seats in British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. In Ontario, they had 67 seats to the 12 won by the Liberals. The Liberals again ruled Quebec, finishing with 59 seats to the Conservatives four, an improvement considering the Conservatives won zero seats in 1921.\n\nInterestingly, King would write in his diary in the morning of the election and he would predict that his party would gain 59 in Quebec, although he was wrong in his belief he would take half of the votes in the Maritimes. He would write, quote:\n\n\u201cI believe we will have a majority over all of 10 to 15 and with the Progressives a majority of 40 to 50. W should hope we will have in round numbers a majority as good as Liberal of 25 overall\u2026whatever the outcome, I shall regard it as all for the best and shall not murmur in the least, nor rejoice over much.\u201d\n\nKing had lost in his own riding and would write, quote:\n\n\u201cThere was just a little feeling of regret at losing a riding and having to face another contest, a little feeling too of relief at not having to keep on nursing a constituency. I find that the greatest anxiety. I shall get a seat somewhere.\u201d\n\nUpon receiving the full election result, King would blame the defeat on money from the big interests who were seeking further protection and a lack of organization on the part of the Liberals. He would write, quote:\n\n\u201cIt looks like a heavy road ahead, but the Progressives may come in with us, a few will be foolish enough not to, then if he wins in the House of Commons, it looks like another election or great uncertainty again for awhile.\u201d\n\nThe Windsor Star in bold lettering stated, quote:\n\n\u201cKing may keep office. Denies his mind is made up to resign as a result of the vote.\u201d\n\nKing had told the Canadian Press, quote:\n\n\u201cWhen all the returns are in, I intend to discuss the situation with the Governor General and I shall then make a statement on my intentions.\u201d\n\nKing had met with Byng on Oct. 30, the day after the election, and King would write that Byng said to him, quote:\n\n\u201cThere are three alternatives as I see it. The first is dissolution, that I hope you will not ask for, that I would not wish to grant at this stage, the people do not want another election immediately. The next is that Mr. Meighen, having the largest solid group should be called on and the third that you should continue. I shall of course agree to whatever you say as to the last two, but Mr. King, as a friend of yours, may I say that I hope you will consider very carefully the wisdom of the second course.\u201d\n\nThe issue was that despite having fewer seats than the Conservatives, King was able to hold onto power by forming a coalition with the Progressives, who aligned closely with the Liberals and this allowed King to form a minority government. This may seem surprising but as the sitting prime minister, King was able to do this.\n\nMeighen of course was fuming over this turn of events, and he demanded that King resign as prime minister. Governor General Lord Byng agreed that the Conservatives should form the government but despite his objections, there was no valid reason to dismiss King from power.\n\nKing then ran in a by-election in Prince Albert and was elected.\n\nWhile King spoke to the press and helped to guide the public narrative, Meighen stayed relatively silent on the whole matter in public. It would not be until Nov. 5, a week after the election that Meighen would speak. He had been waiting until he knew what King was going to do in regards to staying on in power. Meighen would state, quote:\n\n\u201cThe premier\u2019s statement stripped of its sophistry is merely an announcement of his determination to hang on in defiance of a heavily adverse verdict from the people of Canada\u2026Mr. King is now merely the leader of a minority group. There has never been a case in Canada and none for a third of a century in Britain, where the leader of a minority group has waited for the calling of Parliament, or has refused to resign immediately once the will of the people was known.\u201d\n\nKing would look at the path ahead and state in his diary that he felt it was the right thing to do. He would write, quote:\n\n\u201cRegard all power as a trust in the fullest sense. I have had great comfort and help from the spiritual influences about me.\u201d\n\nAs can be expected, this government did not last long and a scandal rocked the government. For a time, King kept the Progressives on his side through the promise of supporting the establishment of Old Age Pensions.\n\nIn the customs department, it was found not only were leading members of the department conducting illicit trade. At the time Jacques Bureau was the Minister of Customs and Excise. King had seen the danger of this affair for his government and he had Bureau resign in September 1925, before the last election, and take a position in the Senate. King would write in his diary, one month earlier, quote:\n\n\u201cBureau I was saddened and shocked to hear is on another drunken spree. Poor fellow. He is killing himself rapidly, cannot overcome his condition.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, King would write again of Bureau, stating quote:\n\n\u201cOutrageous and disgraceful the manner in which Customs Dept. being run.\u201d\n\nWhen the scandal broke after Conservative MP Henry Stevens had the House pass a motion to create a special committee to investigate the customs department, it was found that Bureau shielded individuals and also benefitted personally through receiving contraband liquor, while his chauffeur received a smuggled vehicle.\n\nKing knew that a vote of censure was coming, so he asked the Governor General to call an election in the hopes of forming government again without the need for a coalition. Instead, Lord Byng refused this request. King would write, quote:\n\n\u201cIt was clear from the moment I began to speak that His Excellency\u2019s mind was completely made up and that he did not wish even to argue the constitutional aspect, but to stand in the position already taken.\u201d\n\nOn June 28, 1926, King resigned. The entry in his diary states in simple tone, quote:\n\n\u201cResigned as Prime Minister of Canada today.\u201d\n\nRather than be crushed by his resignation, King would write quote:\n\n\u201cI feel relief beyond all words in being free of office with a sense of right in every step of the procedure.\u201d\n\nHe would speak in the House of Commons on the day of his resignation, stating quote:\n\n\u201cHis Excellency, having declined to accept my advice on the subject of dissolution, to which I believed under British practice I was entitled, I have tendered my resignation, which His Excellency has agreed to accept.\u201d\n\nUpon giving his resignation, King moved the House to adjournment, which Meighen protested should not be allowed and that he should say something as well. Meighen then said that there should be a conference between himself and the prime minister, to which King responded, quote:\n\n\u201cThere is no prime minister.\u201d\n\nMeighen was then asked by Byng to form a government.\n\nAt the time, an MP who was appointed to a cabinet post would resign their seat and then seek re-election in a by-election. Meighen did not do this because it would result in several ministers not being in the House of Commons during critical votes when his government was already shaky as it were. He gave up his own seat to become prime minister but he named several men as acting ministers, or ministers without a portfolio, so they did not have to resign. King would argue this was against government policy and the ministers had to resign, then be elected in a by-election. If they did not do so, they would have no right to govern.\n\nA representative for Meighen stated, quote:\n\n\u201cHaving in mind the fact that the present session has now continued almost six months and is very near to close, Mr. Meighen believed it to be the first duty of any government he might form to conclude with all dispatch the work of the present session.\u201d\n\nKing was an incredibly smart person when it came to political maneuvering and he would go on the attack, stating that Lord Byng was an official of a foreign power who was interfering with Canadian politics.\n\nThe Meighen government made it through four Parliamentary votes, but they lost on the fifth vote by only one vote.\n\nKing then brought the Progressives to his side and within three days, they had brought down the government in a vote of confidence. With that, Meighen gained the distinction of having the shortest lived government in Canadian history and Lord Byng called an election.\n\nKing would campaign on the message of the Conservatives being corrupt. He also ran on the platform of the constitutional issue, citing interference by the governor general in Canadian affairs. On July 2, 1926, he would write quote:\n\n\u201cI could not believe Byng would deliver himself so completely into my hands.\u201d\n\nKing was smart enough as a politician to know that attacking Byng directly would upset some people in Canada, due to the ties to the Royal Family. He portrayed Meighen as governing illegally. This tactic was spurred on by nationalist feelings in Canada, helping King gain traction.\n\nMeighen, possibly believing that his high tariff talk had helped win the election for him previously, continued on the high tariff platform, while also attacking the Liberals, stating they were corrupt.\n\nIn the Sept. 14, 1926 election, King and the Liberals regained power, with 116 seats, while the Conservatives fell by 24 seats to 91. The Progressives lost another 11 seats, and the United Farmers of Alberta gained nine seats to tie the Progressives with 11 seats total. Meighen would lose his seat in the election and promptly resigned as leader of the Conservative Party.\n\nThe day after winning the election, King would visit the tomb of Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Lady Laurier, where he was joined by the Speaker of the Commons in a private visit, so he could lay a wreath of bay leaves.\n\nTo hold onto power, which he would for four years despite a minority government, King formed an alliance with the Progressives again.\n\nThis election was also notable in that the Liberals agreed to not run candidates in all ridings due to their alliance with the Progressives. This created the unique situation where the Conservatives picked up 40 per cent of the vote in Manitoba, twice what any other party had, but had no seats elected.\n\nThe Liberals once again decimated the Conservatives in Quebec, with 59 seats to their four seats. In Saskatchewan, as well as the aforementioned Manitoba, the Conservatives won no seats. The Conservatives took the balance of seats in British Columbia, New Brunswick, Ontario and Nova Scotia.\n\nThe entire affair, known as the King-Byng Affair, would be brought up at the 1926 Imperial Conference, and at the 1929 Conference on the Operation of Dominion Legislation and the 1930 Imperial Conference. It would eventually result in the Statute of Westminster, which was passed on Dec. 11, 1931. This Statute clarified Dominion parliaments and gave them full legal freedom except in an area where they chose to be subordinate to England. From this point on, the Governor General would follow the advice of the Prime Minister of Canada, not the British Parliament.\n\nByng would say of the whole affair upon his return to England, quote:\n\n\u201cI have to await the verdict of history to prove my having adopted a wrong course, and this I do with an easy conscience that, right or wrong, I have acted in the interests of Canada and implicated no one else in my decision.\u201d\n\nInformation from Canadian Encyclopedia, Wikipedia, Dynasties and Interludes, Biographi, Library and Archives Canada, Victoria Daily Times,\n\nShare this Facebook Twitter Reddit\n\nLiked it?

Every page goes through several hundred of perfecting techniques; in live mode. Quite the same Wikipedia. Just better.\n\nThe 1926 Alberta general election was held on June 28, 1926, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. The United Farmers of Alberta government that had first been elected in 1921 was re-elected, taking a majority of the seats in the Alberta Legislature. Herbert Greenfield had resigned as United Farmers leader and premier, and John E. Brownlee led the UFA to this second election victory, increasing the UFA's number of seats.\n\nThe writs of election were issued on May 10, 1926, allowing an election period of 40 days.\n\n1926 was Alberta's first general election where Single transferable voting (STV) was used in the three largest cities and Instant-runoff voting was used everywhere else.A Report on Alberta Elections 1905-1982\n\nCalgary, Edmonton and Medicine Hat continued to be multi member districts. Edmonton elected five members; Calgary elected five members; and Medicine Hat elected two. Previously they had elected members by Plurality block voting. Now they elected members using STV-PR, which at the time was called the Hare Proportional representation system.A Report on Alberta Elections 1905-1982\n\nOutside the large cities, districts were single member districts and MLAs were elected under Alternative Voting system. Rural voters, like their city counterparts, cast preferential ballots and had ability to rank the candidates. The seat was filled by the candidate who received a majority of the votes whether through first-choice votes or a combination of first-choice votes and votes transferred from less-popular candidates.[2] This was the first election in Canada (and in North America) where all the members were elected through non-plurality voting systems.\n\nThis dual system of voting would last until 1956. Medicine Hat after 1926 changed to a single-member constituency, whose MLA was elected through Alternative Voting.\n\nUnder STV in Edmonton, the UFA captured one seat in Edmonton where it had taken no seats in 1921 under the Liberal government's Block Voting system. The Labour party also for the first time elected an MLA in Edmonton. As well, Edmonton voters elected a Liberal and two Conservatives. This mixed crop of representatives was much better balanced than the single-party sweeps that Edmonton had previously elected through other electoral systems.\n\nThe UFA also took a great share of the rural seats, taking 42 of the province's 49 rural seats. It took four rural seats that had been captured by Liberal candidates in 1921 (Beaver River, Leduc, Sedgewick and Whitford), and one that had been won by an Independent in 1921 (Claresholm). The UFA also won the district of Empress formerly known as Redcliffe, which had been won by the UFA in 1921. No UFA candidate ran for re-election to its seat in Medicine Hat. It gained a seat in the newly created next-door Cypress district. It also lost its St. Albert seat.\n\nThe UFA derived no benefit from Alternative Voting - it would have won all but one of the seats it won under Alternative Voting if the contest had been conducted using Plurality voting. And it lost one seat that it would have won if the contest had been held using Plurality voting (in Bow Valley).\n\nConservatives, being a less popular party, had been badly treated under FPTP and Block Voting in 1921 but now did better. It won two seats each in Edmonton and Calgary, where Block Voting had been replaced by STV.\n\nAt the time of the election call, six seats were sitting vacant. They had been vacated by MLAs who had run in the 1925 federal election. MLA C.W. Cross was elected in the federal election. William McCartney Davidson, Calgary Independent MLA, was another one of those who had left. [3]\n\nThe UFA vote share went up 10 percent in this election compared to 1921. This shows effect of the change in voting system - the UFA actually received 15,000 fewer votes in 1926 than in 1921. The Liberals received 54,000 fewer. The change in percentage of UFA support is likely more a result of urban voters not being allowed to cast multiple voters as they had done in 1921. That had artificially raised the Liberal vote count and percentage and had lowered the UFA percentage recorded for the 1921 election.\n\nIn 1926 the UFA vote count outside the cities was 69,000, having gone down from the 81,000 the party's candidates had received outside the cities in 1921. The UFA's vote total was about 50 percent of the first-preference votes cast outside the cities. Through transfers it received a majority of votes in each of the 42 districts where its candidate won.[4]\n\nUnder STV Edmonton elected a mixed bag of representatives. UFA, Liberal, Conservative and Labour MLAs were all elected, which compared well with the total sweep that Liberals made in 1921 under Block Voting.\n\nIn Calgary Conservative supporters found representation under STV where they had been shut out under Block Voting in 1921.\n\nUnder STV in Medicine Hat, a Liberal and a Conservative took the city's two seats - which was fair as the two parties had about equal support there.\n\nUnder Alternative Voting outside the cities, if no candidate took a majority of votes in the first count, votes were transferred until a candidate acceptable to a majority of the voters was determined. In Bow Valley the UFA candidate leading in the first count did not have as much support from Conservative supporters and a Liberal took the seat.\n\nIn four districts only two candidates ran so vote transfers were not needed. Three-way contests would be a feature of most elections from here on in, as Canada had passed the point when only two parties dominated politics. Labour and farmer parties were here to stay to fight it out against the two old-line parties.\n\nIn fifteen of the province's 49 rural districts, three or more candidates ran and vote-splitting meant no one candidate took a majority of the votes on the first count. A UFA candidate was in the top spot in most of these contests. Liberal and Conservative party supporters were split on whether to support the other old-line party or the UFA, if their candidate was eliminated and their ballots able to be transferred to another. In many cases many Conservative and Liberal back-up preferences were marked for the UFA candidate, and in eight of those 15 districts the UFA candidate who had been leading in the first count won the seat, in three the Liberal leading was elected in the end, and in two the Labour candidate was leading and elected in the end.\n\nThe only turn-overs where the candidate leading in the first count was not elected were in Bow Valley and Pincher Creek. In Pincher Creek, back-up preferences on votes at first placed on the Conservative candidate favoured the UFA candidate, who took the seat over the previously-leading Liberal candidate. In Bow Valley, vote transfers from the Conservative candidate went mostly to the Liberal, who passed the UFA candidate in popularity. Overall party-wise the two turn-overs cancelled each other but two different individuals were elected due to the Alternative Voting system than would have been elected under FPTP.\n\nThe UFA's seat majority was due to its victories in the rural areas. Its moral right to power rested on the fact that to be elected in a rural district a candidate had to have support from a majority of a district's voters. The UFA was elected through majority support in 42 of the province's 52 districts, and its candidate in Edmonton was the most popular of all the candidates who ran there as well.[5]\n\nYouTube Encyclopedic\n\n1 / 5 Views: 473 615 62 403 962 8 608\n\nCanadian Prime Ministerial Election of 1926\n\nCanadian Prime Ministerial Election of 1921\n\n9 Most Shocking Facts About Famous Landmarks\n\nA New Home in Canada\n\nAndrew Coyne 'The Alarming State of Canada's Democracy'_Merv Leitch QC lecture_4 Nov 2013 Transcription\n\nResults\n\nPopular vote United Farmers 39.68% Liberal 26.17% Conservative 22.10% Labour 7.79% Others 4.26%\n\nSeats summary United Farmers 71.67% Liberal 11.67% Labour 8.33% Conservative 6.67% Ind.

He became the butt of endless jokes.\n\nEconomic Crisis\n\nR.B. Bennett\u2019s Conservative Party had won a majority government in August 1930. However, the Great Depression had been his government\u2019s millstone since its rise to power. Bennett had tried to bring back prosperity using traditional economic tools, including high import tariffs. (See also Protectionism.) By 1934, as the Depression and the burden of unemployment wore on, political discontent surfaced across the country.\n\nIn Ontario and the West, the socialist Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) emerged with its \u201cRegina Manifesto.\u201d It advocated unemployment and health insurance, farming price supports and public housing. At the other end of the political spectrum, the Social Credit movement blossomed and came to power in Alberta in 1935. It argued for increased purchasing power for consumers, via a $25-per month social dividend payment to every adult Albertan. Another new political party, Maurice Duplessis\u2019s Union Nationale, began to make waves in Quebec. And there was criticism from within Bennett\u2019s own cabinet that the Conservative government\u2019s policies were creating easy profits for big business and hardship for others.\n\n\n\n\n\nReforms Announced on Radio\n\nAmidst these pressures, and with an election on the horizon, Bennett dramatically changed course. Modelling his strategy on United States President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, the prime minister took to the radio airwaves with a series of speeches outlining a New Deal for Canada.\n\nBennett\u2019s reforms promised a more progressive taxation system; a maximum work week; a minimum wage; closer regulation of working conditions; unemployment insurance; health and accident insurance; a revised old-age pension; and agricultural support programs. (See also Social and Welfare Services.) Bennett\u2019s New Deal legislation was largely unopposed by the other political parties; however, the reforms were not enacted in time for the October 1935 election.\n\nGeneral Election\n\nBennett\u2019s 11th-hour proposals were seen as too-little, too-late by a weary and impatient electorate. He lost the 1935 election to William Lyon Mackenzie King and the Liberals, who were returned to Parliament with a majority government. The Liberal percentage of the vote did not dramatically increase from the election in 1930. But the new parties contesting the election \u2014 the CCF, Social Credit, and the Reconstruction Party (a Conservative splinter group) \u2014 all drew votes away from the Conservatives.\n\nKing referred Bennett\u2019s New Deal legislation to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (Canada\u2019s highest court of appeal at the time). In 1937, it declared many of the reforms unconstitutional and outside of federal jurisdiction. (See Distribution of Powers.)\n\nSee also Unemployment Relief Camps; On to Ottawa Trek; Welfare State.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://canadaehx.com/2021/08/28/the-elections-1930/", "page_content": "After the chaos of the 1925 and 1926 elections, coupled with the King-Byng Affair, it probably seemed like things would get better for William Lyon Mackenzie King but what he did not count on was the monumental event of The Great Depression.\n\nBy the time the 1930 election rolled around, the first signs of the Depression had appeared, and it would result in Canada wanting to go a different direction than it had for the majority of the 1920s.\n\nThe Great Depression is often seen as something that hurt farmers, but it spread across the country to several sectors. The Maritimes were dealing with a severe economic decline, while the overproduction of pulp and paper caused huge layoffs in northern Ontario. The price of wheat began to fall in 1928, but some factories in southern Ontario still operated. In Quebec, New Zealand butter exports were causing the price for dairy products to fall. King did not seem to take notice of the pending disaster. His diary doesn\u2019t even include a reference to the Stock Market Crash in 1929.\n\nArthur Meighen was long gone as the leader of the Conservatives, replaced by the millionaire Richard Bennett, known more commonly as R.B. Bennett.\n\nHe would campaign heavily on his business knowledge and putting in aggressive measures to combat The Great Depression. He would state on June 9, 1930, during the campaign, quote:\n\n\u201cI propose that any government of which I am the head will at the first session of Parliament, initiate whatever action is necessary to that end, or perish in the attempt.\u201d\n\nAt the time, unemployment was rising in Canada and the Liberals had laid claim to the economic prosperity Canada enjoyed through the 1920s. That claim then attached them to the bad times as well, and Canadians began to blame the Liberals for the issues that were created by The Great Depression.\n\nAnother issue for the Liberals at this time was the King responded slowly to the growing crisis. The Dominion Bureau of Statistics did not begin to register a drop in employment until 1930, giving a delayed response and view to the entire situation for King.\n\nWhen provinces began to ask for aid to help their citizens, he simply stated that it was a Conservative conspiracy, and he would make one of the rare political plunders of his career. Called the Five Cent Speech, he stated on April 3, 1930, that the Canadian government should not give unemployment benefits to provincial governments that had Conservative leaders.\n\nHe would state in the House of Commons, quote:\n\n\u201cWith respect to giving money out of the federal treasury to any Tory government in this country for these unemployment purposes, with those governments situated as they are today with policies diametrically opposed to those of this government, I would not give them a five-cent piece.\u201d\n\nIn his diary for April 2, 1930, he would write, quote:\n\n\u201cI shall try tomorrow to make an effective speech on unemployment and without notes. I pray God for help in doing so.\u201d\n\nThe next day, he would write that his speech received a thunderous ovation from the Liberals, but he also noted that he had made a mistake. He would write, quote:\n\n\u201cIt was a fighting speech and in except in two particulars was what was needed. I made a slip I think in saying I would not give a cent to a Tory government on Earth. It was a slip in that it can be read apart from the context, and it is capable of much misrepresentation as applied to unemployment.\u201d\n\nOn April 4, the day after the speech, King saw that it was now spreading around the country, he would write, quote:\n\n\u201cThe slip I made yesterday. I am persuaded it was such, was in not seeing the single remark would be taken out of its context and misrepresented and the rest of the speech would go by the boards. I am sorry for this. Also, as Prime Minister, speaking in House of Commons, I went perhaps too far.\u201d\n\nAt the time, seven of the nine provinces were led by Conservatives, and since King believed that unemployment was not a serious problem, he saw the requests for aid as grandstanding more than anything.\n\nFor the Conservatives, this was a gift, and they would run with it through the election. They would portray King as someone who was incapable of running the Canadian government.\n\nThe Liberals were also dealing with an age factor. Except for 1920 and part of 1926, they had been ruling most of the 1920s. King was 56 years old for one, and many of the chief strategists had been with the party since the days of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and they were beginning to get too old to help the party. On top of that, King seemed to have troubles at every stop along the campaign tour.\n\nThe Conservatives, on the other hand, pushed the image of Bennett being a self-made man who had rebuilt the party using his own funds, providing an estimated $500,000, or $7.7 million today. Of that, one-fifth went to party offices in Quebec. The party bought out newspapers in Liberal controlled areas and shifted their slant to support the Conservatives, and this would be the first election in which radio was a major factor. While King had a somewhat slow and halting way of talking, Bennett was vibrant, which people preferred to listen to. The Conservatives also capitalized on radio, buying the best radio spots they could. Bennett also promised to blast Canada into the world markets through a new tariff policy, which would help the party gain votes in the west.\n\nKing did see the potential for radio, but he found talking into a microphone something he did not enjoy. He would write, quote:\n\n\u201cTonight, I made what I believe has been the greatest effort of my life. I spoke for nearly two hours over the radio, to an unseen audience from coast to coast. I prayed very earnestly as I faced the microphone, thinking of the people of Canada as a whole. I found everything went well once I started, save only that I was far from covering all the ground I had laid out. I had to speak rapidly, and I had to condense, leave out parts.\u201d\n\nBennett would pledge to end unemployment in the country and provide work for everyone. The Conservative message, after the Liberals pushed for lower tariffs to England and higher tariffs to the United States, was that Bennett\u2019s first concern was Canada.\n\nThe Liberals countered this by putting out a pamphlet full of facts that stated, quote:\n\n\u201cDuring the past seven years, Canada has been wonderfully prosperous, more prosperous than ever before, more prosperous than any other country in the world. There was a larger increase in the total number employed in the six years between 1922 and 1928 than in the previous 32 years.\u201d\n\nWhile that was true, it didn\u2019t reflect the current situation in 1930 in Canada.\n\nOverall, compared to the past elections over the course of 20 years, this was a quieter affair. Maclean\u2019s magazine would write on Aug. 1, 1930, quote:\n\n\u201cThe politicians, too, seemed strangely unreal. Mr. Bennett and Mr. King talked rather like revivalists. They used the most solemn language, but somehow or other they lacked the iron of some past campaigns, were either too polite or too little in real earnest to say those things which shock the anemic but actually please many more others and give to an election a certain fighting zest.\u201d\n\nOne reason for this more settled affair, in terms of elections, was that Meighen was no longer the leader of the Conservatives. King and Meighen did not like each other, but King and Bennett did like each other, even when trading attacks on the campaign trail. In fact, the two men would often meet in Bennett\u2019s office to talk and discuss major matters pertaining to the election. When Parliament ended prior to the election, King and Bennett even talked and shared a joke, while also shaking hands on the floor of the House of Commons.\n\nOver the course of the election campaign, Bennett travelled 22,530 kilometres around the country, meeting with voters. He left Ottawa at 2:10 a.m. on June 8 in a private railway car to begin his tour and on June 9, he gave his first speech over the radio, broadcast to the 500,000 radios in Canada at the time. Bennett would continue to campaign until July 26, delivering as much as five speeches per day.\n\nIn the July 28, 1930, election, the Liberals lost 27 seats, becoming the Official Opposition with 89 seats. The Conservatives in contrast soared ahead with a gain of 44 seats, finishing with a majority of 135. The United Farmers finished with nine, while the Progressive Party continued its decline, finishing with just three seats. The Conservatives defeated the Liberals in every province except Saskatchewan, where the Liberals had 12 seats to the Conservative\u2019s seven, and Quebec. In Quebec, the Conservatives did surprisingly well, picking up 24 seats, up 20 from the 1926 election, while the Liberals picked up 40. In Ontario, the Conservatives dominated with 59 seats to the 22 won by the Liberals.\n\nKing would write in his diary at 3:30 a.m. on July 29, quote:\n\n\u201cThe result is a great surprise. First, I was astonished Nova Scotia did not do better, greatly disappointed at PEI and New Brunswick as bad as it could be. Ontario did not do well in some seats owing to neglect of members, internal differences. Quebec not as good as expected, we lost many there. The west held up pretty well, but we lost several seats.\u201d\n\nFor King, he had been leading the party since the death of Laurier in 1919, and had gone through four elections by this point, including the 1930 one. He wrote in his diary prior to the election that he was exhausted and sick. When the result became known, he would write, quote:\n\n\u201cThe truth is I feel I do not much care, the load is very heavy, and I would gladly do literary work for a while. I shall be glad to throw on to Bennett\u2019s shoulders the formation of a government and finding a solution for unemployment and other problems. My guess is he will go to pieces under the strain.\u201d\n\nUpon his election, Bennett would state, quote:\n\n\u201cThe policy of this Conservative Party has been accepted by the people of Canada as the instrument of national development. The fact that every province of the Dominion has contributed to the result will sustain the new government in the task which lies before us.\u201d\n\nKing, unlike the 1925 election, would concede defeat with the Conservatives commanding a large majority. He would say in a statement, quote:\n\n\u201cI have told his excellency that I shall be glad in any way possible to expedite the summoning of Parliament and am prepared to tender my resignation as Prime Minister\u2026I naturally regret its outcome. I am particularly sorry that a few of my colleagues and some of the former supporters of the government in the House of Commons have met with defeat.\u201d\n\nAfter the election, Liberals started dealing with allegations of corruption due to the Beauharnois Scandal, which was a plan to divert water from the St. Lawrence into the Beauharnois Canal to develop hydroelectric power. The Beauharnois Light, Heat and Power Company, seeing the potential to divert the St. Lawrence to the canal, wanted to keep the Liberals in power in order to capitalize on the potential huge profits. To do so, the company put $500,000 into the campaign fund. When the Liberals lost, the scandal came to light.\n\nWhile Bennett had won the election, and would remain prime minister for five years, The Great Depression would prove to be a much tougher problem to solve for him. As it turned out for King, losing to Bennett when he did may have been the best thing that could have happened to him in terms of his career. We will talk about that in the next episode.\n\nInformation from Library and Archives Canada, Vancouver Province, Wikipedia, Macleans, the Ottawa Journal, Montreal Gazette, Biographi, Dynasties and Interludes,\n\nShare this Facebook Twitter Reddit\n\nLiked it?
