''The university has been unsuccessfully trying to solve them for many years. Those problems have put us in the position of defending ourselves before the N.C.A.A. committee on infractions twice in the past few years. There is no way of measuring the damage that has been done to the university's most priceless assets, its integrity and its reputation.'' Case of Quintin Dailey\n\nQuintin Dailey, the team's all-America guard last season, was charged with five counts of felony assault in a sexual attack on a female student last December and pleaded guilty in June to assault. He was placed on three years' probation by a San Francisco judge. At a probation hearing before sentencing, Dailey is reported to have admitted he was paid $1,000 a month by a San Francisco alumnus for a summer job he did not perform. Last spring, Dailey left San Francisco after his junior year and was the No. 1 draft choice of the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association.\n\nThe university's investigation involved payments to Dailey as well as those to an incoming freshman when the sport was dropped. ''The university simply could not suffer another proceeding before the N.C.A.A. committee on infractions,'' said Father LoSchiavo. First Such Action\n\nSan Francisco's unexpected action marked the first time an N.C.A.A. institution has voluntarily dropped a major sport indefinitely because of admitted violations of N.C.A.A. rules. David Berst, the N.C.A.A. director of enforcement said that Southwestern Louisiana University was ordered to drop varsity basketball in the 1973-74 and 1974-75 seasons as part of a four-year probation, 1973-1977. The school has since returned to playing varsity basketball.\n\nThe University of Kentucky and Long Island University dropped the sport voluntarily during the 1952-53 season in the aftermath of the basketball gambling scandals of the early 1950's. Kentucky did not field a team for one season and L.I.U. suspended play for six years."}, {"url": "https://www.vice.com/en/article/wnm58m/a-forgotten-classic-and-the-complicated-legacy-of-the-1961-st-joes-hawks", "page_content": "Jim Lynam is a basketball lifer with an auteur's eye. He believes that his sophomore season, 55 years ago at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia, is worthy of a feature film. And Lynam understands that although his Hawks' wild 127-120 four-overtime victory over the Utah Redskins in the now-defunct NCAA consolation game was one of the greatest college basketball games of all time, it would have to be secondary to any film's main plotline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If I was making that movie, I'd open with a close-up of the trophy,\" he says. \"The coaches agonized over whether we should even have the end-of-the-year basketball banquet\u2014it was an impossible decision. We did. It was a somber affair. When I received the team MVP trophy, the engraving on the plaque ended and a separate narrow rectangular gold strip had my name on it. If Inspector Clouseau looked at it, he'd recognize they altered the trophy. The guy who made it didn't redo the plaque, he cut off Jack Egan's name off the bottom, got another little piece and engraved James F. Lynam on there\u2026 That's how I'd start telling the tale.\"\n\nJack Egan's name was sliced off the MVP trophy in favor of Lyman's because he didn't attend the post-season banquet, even though, as team captain, he'd just completed one of the best campaigns in St. Joe's history. But Egan and two teammates, forward Frank Majewski and center Vincent Kempton, had recently confessed to shaving points three times that season for a total of $2,750 that was split between the three. Egan wasn't the ringleader\u2014that would have been Majewski\u2014but their actions ended up costing him the most.\n\nThe three tight-knit senior starters were swept up in a wide-ranging national game-fixing scandal that first came to light on St. Patrick's Day 1961\u2014eight days before St. Joe's played Utah in that consolation game\u2014when New York County District Attorney Frank Hogan revealed that two players from Seton Hall admitted to taking cash to shave points, and that more schools were involved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHogan was dubbed \"Mr. Integrity\" for a career spanning more than thirty years in which he took on organized crime, police corruption, the crooked quiz shows, and the 1951 City College of New York point shaving scandal. For a solid decade, New York was the epicenter for fixing college basketball games. The fixes didn't die out after CCNY, even though a handful of athletes were sent to jail. In fact, the scandal that engulfed St. Joe's dwarfed that one: 476 players fixed 43 games between 1957-61.\n\nBefore all hell broke loose, the St. Joe's Hawks had a superb season led by coach Jack Ramsay. Perhaps the game most emblematic of what the Hawks could do\u2014but didn't\u2014was the one they played against Xavier in Cincinnati on January 14.\n\nAfter falling behind 87-75, Paul Westhead, a senior reserve guard, recalls the second unit guys coming in and tightening the gap.\n\n\"We put on the full-court zone press Coach Ramsay was famous for, cut into the lead, and made a valiant effort to get us back in the game. The starters came in and missed some plays\u2026 Who knows what happened\u2026\"\n\nWhat happened, at least on the court, was Majewski, a workmanlike forward, had his worst game of the season against the Musketeers going 1-of-5 for three points. For their game-fixing efforts, the three miscreants would be paid $1,000\u2014but they needed to lose by 11.\n\nThe Xavier defeat was just a blip. The Hawks would proceed to reel off fifteen straight victories, including NCAA tournament East Regional wins over Princeton and Wake Forest. They didn't lose again until they were steamrolled 95-69 in the Final Four by the No. 1-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes of Jerry Lucas and John Havlicek fame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Of all the games I ever played in, it's the only one where I remember getting back on defense and it was still like a floodgate coming at you,\" says Lynam, now a 74-year-old broadcaster with Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia. \"We weren't scoring, Lucas would get every rebound, outlet the ball, and they would run it down our throats.\"\n\nWesthead, 77, says the team left Philadelphia for the NCAA tournament believing they could play with anybody, even though St. Joe's didn't have Ohio State's star power.\n\n\"On the flight to the Final Four we all wore Stetson hats, it was Kansas City here we come\u2026 As I recall, we didn't play that bad against Ohio State and they still demolished us. It was hard to imagine a college team could be that good. The Buckeyes far surpassed our abilities, but there was no embarrassment about getting clocked. Back then, the consolation game was still a big deal, like winning the bronze and the Olympics, so we regrouped and just said, 'let's get out there and play.'\"\n\nJack Ramsay, who coached the 1961 St. Joe's squad, went onto a Hall of Fame career. Photo: Wikimedia.\n\nAnd on March 25, boy did they ever. Early in the second half of the thrilling, up-and-down, back-and-forth, unrecognized classic consolation game, St. Joe's had a 12-point lead on the Utah Redskins (they wouldn't become the Utes until 1972), but it didn't hold.\n\nLed by Billy \"The Hill\" McGill, a 6'9\" center who scored 38.8 a game\u2014only three players in NCAA history have eclipsed that average\u2014Utah took the lead late. McGill would go for 34 and 14 boards, with his front-court mate Jim Rhead contributing 28 and 11 of his own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Billy had a jump hook that couldn't be blocked and we were dominating on the inside,\" recalls Rhead, 77. \"We couldn't pull away because Jack Egan had the hot hand. This was long before the three-pointer, but he kept pulling up from a few steps behind today's NBA line. His shooting was the difference.\"\n\nIn the consolation game, Egan\u2014the would-be St. Joe's team MVP\u2014dropped 42 points on 17-of-33 field goals, went 8-of-8 from the free throw line, and grabbed 16 rebounds to round it out. Until the final overtime, the Hawks needed every one of Egan's buckets.\n\nThe first overtime got off to an amazing start, which Lynam rehashed with a laugh he didn't have that night. Right off the tip, Hawks guard Billy Hoy snatched the ball, pulled up and drilled a 15-footer\u2014\n\n\"In the wrong basket! It's mass confusion, the refs are trying to figure out what happened, I'm not sure Hoy realized what he did, and I'm on the sideline going ballistic. Coach Ramsay was trying to calm me down saying it's going to be fine, and I'm screaming, 'No it's not, He scored in the other hoop!\"\n\nThe Hawks would tie it at 97. In the second OT, Egan would hit two late free throws to knot it at 101.\n\nFree throws would also play a crucial role in the third OT. The rotation was shortened, but Westhead, who had broken his wrist in a freshmen-varsity pre-season game and never got a ton of minutes, came off the bench and made a key play.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"A couple of guys fouled out, so coach was running out of players. I [checked in], and well I had a suspect jumper, so I put my head down, drove the lane, and got clobbered. While I was on the ground, Coach Ramsay asked how I felt. I said my ankle hurt, but he didn't let me say whether I could continue playing. He made an injury substitution, brought in Harry Booth to shoot my free throws. Coach knew I was fifty-percent from the line. He was ever clever. That was my contribution, getting carried off-the-court for another shooter in my last game ever.\"\n\nUtah did make a stand at the end of that period, blocking a potential St. Joe's game-winner to keep it even at 112. Egan started off the fourth overtime with a basket and two free throws. Then Lynam took over from there, scoring seven of his 31 on the night as St. Joe's prevailed.\n\n\"I felt bad that we lost, but McGill fouled out, and it's tough when you're short your best player,\" says Rhead. \"But it was a fun hard-fought game and my last one in college. I didn't care if we went all night.\"\n\nOne team that wasn't happy they went so long was the reigning national champs, the Ohio State Buckeyes, who were facing Cincinnati in the finals. The \"locker room\" facility in Kansas City was cramped and hot. It was so tight, St. Joe's changed at the hotel before leaving for the arena. Multiple times, Lynam noticed the Buckeyes standing under the basket trying to get loose for the title game that never seemed to come. Rhead later got an earful of Buckeye whinging.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I stuck around to play in the college all-star game and the guys from Ohio State said between trying to warm up four different times and sitting down for an hour, they lost their edge.\"\n\nThe 27-0 Buckeyes sent the championship game into overtime on a layup by Bobby Knight, but they fell to the Cincinnati Bearcats 70-65.\n\nThe effect it had on Ohio State is just one of many small aspects of the game's multi-pronged legacy. McGill, who was the first black player at the University of Utah, would go on to become the NBA's top pick in 1962, selected by the Chicago Zephyrs. He would be out of the league after three seasons, hang on for two more in the ABA, and end up homeless and sleeping in bus stations and laundromats a decade after his jump hook bulldozed the NCAA.\n\nAt least \"The Hill\" made it to the big leagues. Jack Egan never played again.\n\n***\n\nTwo days after the monumental consolation game, Jim Lynam was sleeping in his dorm room. The dorms of the time were private mansions that the school had purchased just off campus. The pay phone was in a closet right outside Lynam's room.\n\n\"First few times I ignored it, but the phone wouldn't stop ringing, so I finally got up and answered it,\" he says. \"A teammate, a dear friend of mine from high school who was sitting out that year, was in a rant, screaming, really emotional. 'Did you hear what happened to those guys?' As I was coming to my senses, my first thought was that those guys were in an automobile accident.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose guys\u2014Egan, Kempton, and Majewski\u2014had crashed and burned, but not in a car. All three had taken money to fix games, receiving $2,750 for shaving points in three games, including the loss to Xavier.\n\nMajewski was the on-campus point man, the one who brought Kempton and Egan into a national gambling operation that stretched from New York City to North Carolina, and would lead to the arrests of 37 players from 22 colleges in 1961. Ensnared among the regular Joe College ballers was future Hall-of-Famer and playground legend Connie Hawkins. He was mainly guilty by association\u2014there's no evidence he participated in fixing games\u2014but the whispers kept him out of the pros for seven years.\n\nThe mastermind fixer was Jack Molinas, a former All-American at Columbia who received an indefinite suspension from the NBA two months into his career for betting on games. Molinas, who was connected to big-time mobsters such as Genovese Family Capo Vincent \"The Chin\" Gigante and the real-life guy Joe Pesci played in Casino, was the point shaving kingpin. But he didn't do much of the street-level dirty work. That was left to lower-level gamblers like Aaron Wagman, who was arrested on March 17 and indicted on 38 counts of corruption and conspiracy a few days later.\n\nWagman, a former pool hustler and Yankee Stadium peanut vendor who talked a big game, was already out on $20,000 bail for trying to bribe University of Florida fullback Jon McBeth into keeping the Gators under the 13-point spread. Wagman, presumably not a criminal mastermind, didn't slow down after his arrest. Investigators followed him from state-to-state as he fixed games, which is why so many college kids eventually ended up in the presence of District Attorney Frank Hogan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Someone with firsthand knowledge told me the D.A.'s office looked like Ft. Lauderdale on spring break,\" says Lynam.\n\nHogan wanted to blow up the betting ring to pieces; he wanted Molinas. Wagman cut a deal to testify against him. Molina was sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison. He would serve, five, mainly at Attica, where, according to a 2003 ESPN article, he became the inspiration for Burt Reynolds character in The Longest Yard. After prison, he moved to Los Angeles where he got into fur importing and pornography, producing filth gems like Lord Farthingay's Holiday before a mob hit rubbed him out\u2014he took a bullet to the back of the head in his Hollywood Hills backyard.\n\nHogan's two-year investigation never would have come together if he hadn't heard from the likes of Egan, Kempton, and Majewski.\n\nIn the May 8, 1961 Sports Illustrated expose \"Portrait of a Fixer,\" writer Ray Cave describes how crushed Frank Majewski was after missing a shot at the end of regulation against Utah. Even though the Hawks went on to win, and the senior forward had a solid game with a double-double, \"It was almost as if he owed a debt to St. Joseph's and had tried to pay it off in his last game.\"\n\nThe celebratory Schmidt's beers from after the Utah game probably hadn't even worn off when the news broke about the fix. Majewski played the tournament knowing the walls were closing in and the jig would soon be up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe scandal was devastating to the small Catholic school of 1,450 students, but at times, to hoops fans, it looked more like bad slapstick comedy. Tom Lees, a columnist for the Times Herald of Montgomery County, Penn. had the misfortune of catching a St. Joe's game against Seton Hall at the famed Palestra that season. Fifty-five years later, he could still remember the putrid action:\n\nIt was absolutely the worst college basketball game I have ever seen. Guys were throwing lousy passes, walking with the ball, double dribbling, discontinuing, etc. It was a joke. When we found out later that two Seton Hall players, Art Hicks and Seth Gunther, were also shaving points in that game, it explained why. Five players from two teams deliberately making mistakes makes for a bad game to view, I can assure you.\n\nWagman's marching orders were followed in that game, as St. Joe's kept it under ten, beating Seton Hall 72-71. For their efforts, the three Hawks in on the shenanigans got $1,000. No word on what the split was, but the money was received by Majewski. Of the three, Kempton is the only one who didn't go along with the scheme, at least in part, out of necessity. As he told the Philadelphia Daily News in 1990, \"It was pure, unmitigated selfishness, greed, immaturity, call it what you want.\"\n\nThe other two young men had a much rougher go of it. Majewski seemed to be an easy mark for Wagman. He came from a working class Jersey City background. His father, a printer, died when he was a sophomore. His mother had a heart attack when he was senior. Majewski told Cave he couldn't wait to get to work and that game-in and game-out, his heart wasn't in basketball.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJack Egan, on the other hand, was a tremendous ballplayer who loved the game. His future seemed awfully bright. On March 27 1961, two days after his shooting clinic against Utah, he was selected by the Philadelphia Warriors in the third round. The following spring, Egan should've teamed with Wilt Chamberlain in reaching the Eastern Conference Finals against Bill Russell and the Celtics.\n\n\"The money NBA players make today is astronomically larger, but it's all relative. Guys coveted the pros every bit as much back then as they do today,\" says Lynam, a former head coach of St. Joe's and the 76ers. \"I have no doubt Jack Egan would've had a great basketball career. He threw it all away.\"\n\nNobody was more hurt by the scandal than Coach Jack Ramsay. Initially, all three players denied the allegations, stonewalling past the point of credulity. Years later, in varied accounts, all would apologize profusely to Ramsay, who said little about it over the years. In the book Jack McKinney's Tales From St. Joe's Hardwood, however, Ramsay took a lot of blame for his star player's demise saying, \"When I look back, I wasn't caring enough. I let Jack Egan down.\"\n\nRamsay's later-in-life consternation stems from the fact that he had forced Egan to quit a $40 a week bartending gig, which he only took when St. Joe's didn't come through on a promised campus job. Egan didn't need the money for college hi-jinx either. He had two children and a pregnant wife. He was broke and hearing about it at home. His wife would miscarry before the season got underway.\n\nRamsay told Egan if he quit, he'd lose his scholarship, so he reluctantly went along with Majewski, although he had point shaving stipulations: No Big Five games, no Middle Atlantic Conference games. Egan admitted to taking money, but apparently nobody told his shooting hand he was skimming. He drained a still-standing (since tied) record 47 against Gettysburg, and then of course, there was the Utah game\u2026\n\n\"When we first heard about it, we wondered if our game was part of it. But I thought if Egan was shaving points against us he was either really terrible at it, or he could've gone for sixty,\" says Rhead.\n\nAll three seniors were expelled, but they were allowed back to St. Joe's a few years later to earn their degrees. According to McKinney, Egan, Kempton, and Majewski all had successful business careers.\n\nFor the guys on the team who weren't on the take, the 1960-61 campaign and its culmination in the 127-120 win is what matters. It may have been technically vacated by the powers-that-be, but that doesn't change the fact that St. Joe's owned the record for most points by an NCAA tournament game-winner. The Hawks record wasn't broken until 1990 when alum Paul Westhead's Loyola Marymount team shattered it in their 149-115 win over Michigan, a game that lives on in ways the 4-OT shootout never will. But they still remember it."}, {"url": "https://playersbio.com/joe-smith/", "page_content": "Joe Smith is an American former professional basketball player who played as a power forward in the NBA for around sixteen years for 12 different teams.

Besides him and his mother, Joe had six other siblings in his family.\n\nHe was the youngest among them. However, they were Letha\u2019s children from her previous marriage.\n\nHis mother initially worked as a maid to raise her children. But after she obtained her diploma, Letha got a job as a medical clerk at Norfolk Naval Hospital.\n\nAs she had completed her education quite late in her life, she wanted all her kids to at least graduate high school. Joe respected his mother\u2019s suggestions and did pretty well in his studies.\n\nHe grew up along with his siblings in a well-disciplined household with a fixed routine.\n\nApart from studies, Joe had also developed a love for sports since childhood. He was much taller than his other siblings, so he enjoyed playing basketball mostly.\n\nHe had already decided to play basketball for North Carolina Tar Heels when he was still in school.\n\nUnfortunately, he could not join the University of North Carolina at Tar Heels as they did not accept him, citing his \u201cunderdeveloped\u201d game and physique.\n\nConsequently, after graduating high school, he enrolled at the University of Maryland in 1993.\n\nBasketball Career\n\nCollege Career\n\nJoe Smith played college basketball for the Maryland Terrapins for two seasons. He already had some experience playing basketball as a power forward at Maury High School.\n\nAlthough he felt a bit low initially after being rejected by the Tar Heels, his experience with the Terrapins was pretty good as he found them supportive from the beginning.\n\nThe terrapins coach, Gary Williams, loved him for his passion for the game and his dedication to improving his performance consistently. He believed that Smith was the guy who never felt he reached his pinnacle, so he always kept practicing.\n\nAs a result, Joe\u2019s performance in his sophomore season was equally promising. He played 34 matches in the season and finished with an average of 20.8 points and 10.6 rebounds per game.\n\nProfessional Career\n\nAlthough everyone was pretty sure that Joe would be one of the top picks in the draft, they had not thought in their wildest dreams that he would be the first pick.\n\nJoe had an excellent start scoring his highest single-game point (30) of his rookie season and showed that he would live up to his expectations.\n\nAfter playing two excellent seasons with the Warriors, Smith was expected to have a stable NBA career, but unfortunately, his club traded him to the Philadelphia 76ers during the 1997-98 midseason.\n\nHe played only a half-season with the 76ers, after which they traded him to the Minnesota Timberwolves in 1999.\n\nHis first season with the Timberwolves went quite well, as he averaged 13.7 points and 8.2 rebounds. But, although he played more matches in the next season, his performance declined.\n\nThe club released him in 2000, after which he played for the Detroit Pistons for a year before returning to the Timberwolves. He then had a three-year association with the Milwaukee Bucks, where he had a relatively better performance.\n\nAfter the Bucks released him, Joe was constantly transferred from one team to another until he signed with the LA Lakers in 2011.\n\nHis only good season in the latter part of his NBA was with the Chicago Bulls in the 2007-08 season, in which he averaged 11.2 points per game.\n\nCoaching Career\n\nAfter his retirement, he was with the Phoenix Suns helping out the Ukrainian center Alex Len during the 2015 pre-draft.\n\nHowever, the Suns did not hire Smith, so he started his academy named Fun-D-Mental Basketball Training in 2014.\n\nHe currently runs a Joe Smith Basketball Academy for Boys and Girls. In addition, he is associated with a private coaching service named CoachUp.\n\nAwards & Achievements\n\nSome of his awards and achievements include:\n\nNBA All-Rookie First Team (1996)\n\nAP Player of The Year (1995)\n\nNaismith Player of The Year (1995)\n\nUPI College Player of The Year (1995)\n\nACC Player of The Year (1995)\n\nAdolph Rupp Trophy (1995)\n\nConsensus first-team All-American (1995)\n\nACC Rookie of The Year (1994)\n\nFirst-team All-ACC (1994, 1995)\n\nNet Worth & Career Earnings\n\nIt sounds weird, but the top pick of the 1995 NBA draft, Joe Smith, leaves paycheck to paycheck, despite having accumulated more than $60 million from his professional basketball career.\n\nWhen he started playing professional basketball in 1995, the Golden State Warriors paid him $2.4 million for his rookie season, and he made another $6 million by playing nearly two more seasons with the Warriors until 1998.\n\nSmith could have made $86 million if he had signed with another team, but he signed an illegal deal with the Timberwolves in 1999. He earned around $4.7 million playing two seasons for them.\n\nHe had initially signed the contract for a low amount after the Timberwolves assured him they would sign him with a heavy sum later. But, he was not provided with any such deals as promised, and consequently, the NBA fined the Timberwolves for their action.\n\nIn his later years, Joe\u2019s salary rates frequently fluctuated, but he never received an amount lower than $1 million.\n\nMoreover, he earned additional money through brand endorsements and merch sales.\n\nJoe was known for his extravagant nature, and now that he is broke, he lives a very modest life.\n\nSmith now thinks that the reason behind his misfortune was that he had too much attachment to material possessions, which ultimately brought him back to where he was in the past.\n\nAs per the CNBC report in 2018, Joe had around $160k in debt.\n\nRelationships\n\nJoe Smith is currently married to Kisha Chavis. The circumstance in which they met each other is unknown, but as per the reports, after dating for a few years, the couple got engaged in 2016.\n\nThe lovers later married each other on St. Croix beach in 2018. Their close friends attended their marriage ceremony, which was televised on a reality tv show called \u2018Say Yes to the Dress: Atlanta.\u2019\n\nAlthough Joe found his love at a low point in his life when he had gone completely broke. Fortunately, Kisha accepted him as he was, and they are content with what they have now.\n\nAs per the rumors, Chavis was previously in a relationship with another man before she dated Joe. Similarly, this is not the first marriage of Joe Smith.\n\nHe was married to Yolanda Smith in the early 2000s. However, their relationship ended in 2011 after Yolanda filed for a divorce when she discovered that Smith was cheating on her with another woman named Deanne Marie.\n\nSmith continued providing financial assistance to his wife to raise his child after their separation.

He was a co-captain his senior season, a four-year starter and a two-time Academic All-American.\n\n\n\nIndeed, Holland made a lot of himself at Purdue.\n\n\n\nHolland enjoyed a cup-of-coffee NFL career, toiling on several practice squads before enrolling in dental school.\n\nGoldandBlack.com caught up with the 31-year-old Holland this week.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: What was your inspiration to become a dentist?\n\nHolland: I went to Purdue with the plan to be some sort of doctor, just didn't know what field. The beauty of being on the football team was you were exposed to a roomful of doctors and athletic trainers. So, I had a board of people I could bounce ideas off of in terms of what made a lot of sense career-wise. So, I spoke with a couple of the doctors at Purdue and opted for dental school. Everyone said you can't really go wrong. And I did. I always did have a little bit of an interest in dentistry. And as I got a little bit further along in my college career, I kind of shifted my focus towards that. And thankfully I was accepted into dental school my senior year. And IU allowed me to defer enrollment as I gave the NFL a shot and got thrown onto practice squads. I then was able to go into dental school just one year after my last season in the NFL.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: How long have you been practicing?\n\nHolland: I just finished my second year of private practice (Holland Dental). I purchased the practice January 3rd this year. I had been an associate at a practice in Fishers for a while and that was all going great, and I really loved the doctor I was working with. But part of what drew me to dentistry in the first place was the ability to own your own practice. Since I had graduated from dental school, I began putting out feelers about who was looking to sell. And I was connected with the doctor that I've just purchased the practice from. He was the team dentist for the Colts. It just seemed to make too much sense. I\u2019m on the west side of Indianapolis. The practice I purchased is in the Eagle Creek area.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: Are you married? Any children?\n\nHolland: I\u2019m married. I have an anniversary coming up in June. No kids yet, but our dog keeps us busy.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: How did you end up at Purdue?\n\nHolland: I played tailback at Chatard, which I think even sometimes I forget. I\u2019d never played defense more than a handful of snaps until I got to Purdue. We always ran the ball at Chatard. I kind of thought I potentially would have the chance to play running back in college. And it became pretty clear that that was not really anybody's plan. I was originally recruited as a safety. The only school that even really mentioned the possibility of starting out at tailback was IU. And I really think that was just a way to try to maybe become a more attractive option. But at that point, I kind of accepted the transition to defense and actually looked forward to the transition.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: What other schools did you consider?\n\nHolland: I was actually offered by Northwestern by Randy Walker just a handful of weeks before he ended up passing away. And so I went up there and I met with Pat Fitzgerald and was very impressed by everything. But I went to a game and it really wasn't a big college football environment. The very next week, I went to Purdue and saw it beat Minnesota. The environment, the stadium, everything about that trip was good. That kind of cemented it. Purdue was always the place I wanted to go. It provided the college football experience, provided the academics, the resources and the support ... it had all I needed.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: How tough was it to transition to defense?\n\nHolland: I was wide open to the transition from running back to safety and was looking forward to that. I did not have as open of a mind to the transition from safety to linebacker. I think it was mostly because I got to Purdue at about 205 pounds, and it never came easy to me to gain weight. It was always a struggle to gain size.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: Did anyone talk to you about moving to linebacker from safety?\n\nHolland: (Defensive coordinator/linebackers coach) Brock Spack had mentioned to me in recruitment and during my redshirt year when I was still playing safety that he would love to see me move to linebacker. I think that was probably always the plan. I went through all of my redshirt freshman training camp at safety. And at that time was gonna get in the rotation on nickel and dime situations. I really wasn't gonna play a huge role defensively at that position anyway, and they moved me to outside linebacker right behind Jason Werner. A couple days after they moved me, Jason went down with a season-ending back injury. So, about five days in at linebacker, I was getting ready to start. I took my bumps and bruises that redshirt freshman year. With a little size and a little bit more experience, I got a little better every single year. It really wasn't until my senior year where I really felt like I was well-suited for linebacker and I was playing the position that I should be playing.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: How was your senior year?\n\nHolland: My senior year was a blast because I was fighting. I was bigger and stronger and faster than I've ever had been and things were coming a little more naturally to me than they had in the past. I can't believe how lucky I was to start as many games as I did. And I was in that position by happenstance.\n\nStory continues below photo\n\n"}]}
