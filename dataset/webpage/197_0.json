The connection between the two? Edna Garrett \u2014 played by veteran actress Charlotte Rae \u2014 whose vivacious character went from being a Park Avenue housekeeper on Diff\u2019rent Strokes to a boardinghouse den mother on The Facts of Life.\n\nMrs. Garrett \u2014 or \u201cMrs. G.,\u201d as she was sometimes known \u2014 was equal parts wise and wisecracking. Her character was a much-loved glue that held the series together.\n\nRae, who was nominated for both two Emmys and two Tonys, died on Sunday, Aug. 5 at age 92. As she is being mourned by media and TV fans around the globe, here are 7 facts about the Jewish actress you may not know.\n\nHer full name was Charlotte Rae Lubotsky\n\nRae was born to Russian Jewish immigrants and grew up in Milwaukee, where her dad, Meyer Lubotsky, owned a tire shop.\n\nHer mom was friends with Golda Meir\n\nIsrael\u2019s future fourth prime minister \u2014 who lived in Milwaukee as a young girl and teen \u2014 was childhood pals with Rae\u2019s mom, Esther.\n\nRae attended Northwestern University\n\nThough she didn\u2019t complete her studies, she made at least one significant friendship: fellow actress Cloris Leachman, who would (much later!) be brought onto The Facts of Life to play her replacement, Mrs. Garrett\u2019s sister, Beverly Ann Stickle.\n\nShe was married to composer/music editor John Strauss for 25 years\n\nStrauss won a Grammy for his work on the soundtrack for the movie, Amadeus (which, interestingly enough, probably puts the degree of separation between Rae and Falco at only one or two degrees). The couple had two children, Larry and Andrew. Strauss came out as bisexual in the 1970s.\n\nThe pair were apparently close to Woody Allen\n\nStrauss collaborated with director on a number of films, including Everything You Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask). Rae appeared as Allen\u2019s mother in the movie Bananas.\n\nNorman Lear was a major fan\n\nThe uber-producer cast Rae for guest spots in his early sitcoms, including All in the Family and Good Times, before offering her the life-changing role of Edna Garrett on Diff\u2019rent Strokes.\n\nLeaving The Facts of Life was her idea\n\nPlaying Mrs. Garrett is what made her a star \u2014 but Rae decided to call it quits after seven seasons, saying, \u201cI needed some time for the rest of my life.\u201d Still, she went on to act, including in voiceover roles (for 101 Dalmations: The Series) and a cameo appearance in You Don\u2019t Mess With The Zohan, which our sister site, JTA, called \u201ca liberal Zionist manifesto.\u201d\n\nHeader Image via TVGuide.com"}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Charlotte-Rae/6000000009741236698", "page_content": "About Charlotte Rae\n\nCharlotte Rae, the quavery-voiced redhead who started out on Broadway but was best known as a warmhearted, wisecracking housemother in two hit 1980s sitcoms, died Sunday at home in Los Angeles. She was 92.\n\nHer death was confirmed in an email by Paul Hilepo, her manager.\n\nKnown for her wide smile and plump figure, Ms. Rae was a fixture on Broadway and television for six decades. But along with other stars from the golden age of Broadway like Betty Garrett and Bea Arthur, she found her greatest success in sitcoms, beginning in the early years of television.\n\nMs. Rae was known to millions of Americans as Edna Garrett, a part she played on two shows: \u201cDiff\u2019rent Strokes,\u201d where she was the housekeeper to three children, one of them played by Gary Coleman, and \u201cThe Facts of Life,\u201d a spinoff in which she looked after a group of teenage girls at a private school. After a slow start in 1979 \u2014 Ms. Rae\u2019s contract allowed her to return to \u201cDiff\u2019rent Strokes\u2019\u2019 if the spinoff was a flop \u2014 the series evolved into a huge success and became known for tackling topical issues from a young woman\u2019s perspective: among them eating disorders, sex, drugs and AIDS.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press in 2015, Ms. Rae said that she had begged the producers of \u201cThe Facts of Life\u201d to allow her character to \u201close her temper, yell at the kids. Let her be a human being.\u201d They declined. \u201cMrs. G\u201d remained the epitome of adult reason.\n\nMs. Rae left at the beginning of the eighth season, citing health problems (she underwent surgery and had a pacemaker installed in 1982), and was replaced by Cloris Leachman for the remainder of the show\u2019s run.\n\nHer first television success came in the early 1960s with \u201cCar 54, Where Are You?,\u201d in which she played Sylvia Schnauser, the wife of an irascible police officer played by Al Lewis. She also appeared on numerous other shows, including \u201cThe Phil Silvers Show,\u201d \u201cThe Defenders,\u201d \u201cBarney Miller\u201d and \u201cGood Times.\u201d She was a cast member on the short-lived 1975 sitcom \u201cHot L Baltimore,\u201d based on a Lanford Wilson play, and played Molly the Mail Lady in early episodes of \u201cSesame Street.\u201d\n\nShe was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\nCharlotte Rae Lubotsky was born on April 22, 1926, in Milwaukee to Jewish immigrants from Russia, Meyer Lubotsky and the former Esther Ottenstein, who had been a childhood friend of the future Israeli prime minister Golda Meir. She wanted to act from a young age and headed to New York in 1948 after briefly attending Northwestern University.\n\nShe found success on Broadway and off for about 20 years, appearing in 10 productions, most notably as Mrs. Peachum in the celebrated 1954 revival of \u201cThe Threepenny Opera\u201d and Mammy Yokum in \u201cLi\u2019l Abner\u201d in 1956. Both roles were extremely matronly, even though she was not yet 30 when she played them.\n\nShe also recorded an album, \u201cSongs I Taught My Mother: Silly, Sinful & Satiric Selections,\u201d in 1955. Consisting mostly of show tunes, it poked fun at the Gabor sisters and Marlene Dietrich. She received two Tony Award nominations: in 1966 for best featured actress in a musical for \u201cPickwick\u201d and in 1969 for best actress in a play for \u201cMorning, Noon and Night.\u201d Her last Broadway appearance was in 1973, in the short-lived David Rabe play \u201cIn the Boom Boom Room,\u201d as the mother of a go-go dancer played by Madeline Kahn.\n\nShe considered an Off Broadway production of Samuel Beckett\u2019s one-woman play \u201cHappy Days\u201d in 1990 to be her career highlight \u2014 \u201clike \u2018Hamlet\u2019 to a man,\u201d she said, paraphrasing Peggy Ashcroft\u2019s description of her joyously existential character, who is buried up to her neck in dirt. \u201cMiss Rae holds firmly to the author\u2019s inclinations \u2014 the pauses, stops and starts and poetic lilt of language,\u2019\u2019 Mel Gussow of The New York Times wrote of Ms. Rae\u2019s performance. \u201cWith an ebullience that seems to spring from conviction, she goes about her everyday life, undeterred by the fact of her entrapment.\u201d\n\nShe continued performing into her 80s. She appeared in \u201cThe Vagina Monologues\u201d Off Broadway in 1993, in the Paper Mill Playhouse production of \u201cPippin\u201d in 2000, and in a concert version of the 1971 musical \u201c70, Girls, 70\u201d at City Center Encores! in 2006. Onscreen, she appeared in the movie version of \u201cHair\u201d in 1980; as an older woman who has an affair with Adam Sandler\u2019s character in \u201cYou Don\u2019t Mess With the Zohan\u201d in 2008; and as the mother of Kevin Kline\u2019s character in \u201cRicki and the Flash\u201d in 2015.\n\nShe was married from 1951 to 1975 to the composer and sound editor John Strauss, who often accompanied her on piano. Mr. Strauss died in 2011.\n\nIn her autobiography, \u201cThe Facts of My Life,\u201d written with her son Larry Strauss and published in 2015, Ms. Rae said that both she and Mr. Strauss had struggled with alcoholism, and that after 25 years of marriage Mr. Strauss announced that he was bisexual and wanted an open relationship. They divorced, and Ms. Rae never remarried.\n\n\u201cI have wonderful friends,\u2019\u2019 she said in 2015. \u201cI\u2019m not just a lonely old lady.\u201d\n\nShe also wrote that her son Andy was found to be autistic at age 16 and at one point was held at the juvenile ward at Bellevue Hospital in New York. He died of a heart attack in his 40s. She said there was nothing more devastating in her life than his autism and early death.\n\nFor all her success as a performer, Ms. Rae never forgot how difficult it had been to grow up plump and short. \u201cI felt inferior,\u201d she once told TV Guide. \u201cI had this tremendous need to perform. I wanted to be acceptable to my peers. I thought if I could just be a big star, I\u2019d feel like somebody too.\u201d Actress.

She was 92.\n\nRae died at her Los Angeles home Sunday with her family at her side, said her publicist, Harlan Boll. A cause of death was not immediately available, but Rae was diagnosed last year with bone cancer after beating pancreatic cancer, Boll said.\n\nShe originated the character of Mrs. Garrett in 1978 during the first season of NBC\u2019s comedy \u201cDiff\u2019rent Strokes,\u201d then took Mrs. Garrett with her for the spinoff \u201cFacts,\u201d which premiered the following season.\n\nInitially set at a girls\u2019 boarding school, that NBC series ran for nine seasons.

Her father was a Russian Jewish immigrant who owned a retail tire business. She was a small girl, felt herself plain and awkward, and found that in performing she could feel popular and accepted. She began doing children's theater and community radio, and became serious about theater as a career.\n\nHer supportive parents sent her to Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, whose theater school has a reputation as one of the finest in the United States. There she met her close friends and classmates Paul Lynde and Cloris Leachman, all of whom regarded him- or herself as some sort of oddball. They sparked each other's creativity: Leachman recalled in an interview that they could make up whole operas on the spot.\n\nRae quickly became known as an effective \"character ingenue\" and a moving musical theater singer, and she played Mrs. Peachum in a studio presentation of Kurt Weill's Der Dreigroschenoper. She was a member of a traditional college review for three years in a row and was reviewed by the Chicago Tribune as \"big-league material.\"\n\nShe and Leachman moved to New York, where they shared an apartment while trying to break into show business. When out of money, she would sing for coins at a rough bar, but soon was an opening act for the well-known folk singer Richard Dyer Bennett at the Village Vanguard. In 1952 she joined the cast of the Blitzstein English translation of Der Dreigroschenoper (The Three-Penny Opera) off Broadway, and participated in its legendary original cast recording.\n\nShe married composer John Strauss, who helped her develop her stage act. He first Broadway show was a musical directed by the great Abe Burrows called Three Wishes for Jamie. It was a flop, but it led to her being cast as Mammie Yokum in the musical comedy Li'l Abner, a hit.\n\nShe did a considerable amount of live television during that medium's golden age, and had a part on the 1961 situation comedy Car 54 Where Are You? In 1971 she had a part in Woody Allen's film Bananas, and turned again to series television for a pilot of an American version of the British series Are You Being Served? She also appeared in the Robert Redford film The Hot Rock, and, in 1974, a guest appearance on the hit All in the Family TV series. Its producer, Norman Lear, was then planning a series called Hot L Baltimore, and cast her as a regular. The show was cancelled soon after its debut in 1975, but in 1978 Rae landed the part of a housekeeper named Mrs. Garrett on another situation comedy, Diff'rent Strokes. This show was a major hit, and her character one of the most popular parts of it. Two years later the Mrs. Garrett character was made the center of a new ensemble show called The Facts of Life as the housekeeper of a dormitory of adolescent girls.\n\nAfter leaving the program two years before it ended its run of original episodes, she continued making character appearances in TV series (including Murder She Wrote and The Worst Witch) and as a voice artist for animated series, including the part of Tarara Boomdeaye in The Brothers Flub, Nanny in the 101 Dalmatians series, and Aunt Pristine Figg in Tom and Jerry: The Movie.\n\nRae died at her Los Angeles home in 2018."}, {"url": "https://mrpopculture.com/whatever-happened-to-charlotte-rae/", "page_content": "Charlotte Rae Lubotsky was a multitalented American woman with the talents of acting, comedy, and singing.

She was one of the daughters born in a large family who depicted a character in her fifties. Her role got so famous that she is still known by her character\u2019s name. Rae left the series in 1986.\n\nThe Facts of Life\n\nThis show was inspired by one of the episodes of Diff\u2019rent Strokes \u2013 The Girl\u2019s School. This was based on an idea of the housekeeper turning into a housemother who boards students in the private school. The show was named Facts of Life because the series focused on the reality-based issues of young girls like weight gain, depression, diet, drugs, alcohol, as well as dating and relationships.\n\nThe Facts of Life eased her life, and after doing this series, she was well-recognized by the audience.

Charlotte Rae joined this organization in the 1970s, and she always considered it an important part of her life as it helped her be sober and active by restricting alcohol.\n\nThe best part of this international fellowship is that it doesn\u2019t charge the people who need care and want to leave alcohol. The funds are fulfilled by the charity from its members.\n\nHealth Issues\n\nIn her last years, Charlotte suffered from a number of diseases, including:\n\nPancreatic Cancer\n\nCharlotte was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2009.

Ray was born in New York City to her mother Charlotte Augusta Burroughs Ray and her father, a prominent abolitionist, Charles Bennett Ray, who worked as a pastor of the Bethesda Congregational Church and as editor of one of the first newspapers published by and for African Americans, The Colored American.\n\nRay attended one of the few schools in the country that educated African American girls: Myrtilla Miner\u2019s Institution for the Education of Colored Youth in Washington, D.C., subsequently known as the Miner Normal School. She graduated in 1869.\n\nThat same year Ray began teaching at Howard University, just two years after the school was established. The same year she began teaching, she was accepted to the Howard School of Law where she attended classes in the evenings. She graduated with her Howard Law degree on February 27, 1872, as its first woman graduate.\n\nAlthough women were not members of the bar of the District of Columbia, Ray apparently took her bar exams and applied as \u201cC.E. Ray\u201d securing her admission to the bar without disclosing that she was a woman thereby becoming the first female member of the District of Columbia bar.\n\nIn 1872 Ray opened her own law practice specializing in commercial law in Washington D.C. One of her most recognized cases was her representation of Martha Gadley, an African American woman who petitioned for divorce from an abusive husband. Gadley\u2019s petition was denied in 1875, but Ray agreed to take the case on appeal to the District of Columbia\u2019s Supreme Court. She successfully overturned the lower court\u2019s ruling by arguing that the husband\u2019s habitual drunkenness and extreme violence endangered his wife\u2019s life and entitled her to a divorce.\n\nDespite her success, Ray was apparently unable to obtain sufficient cases for representation, so she subsequently closed her practice in 1879 and returned to New York City to work as a teacher in the Brooklyn public school system. She was an active advocate for social justice. She attended the National Woman Suffrage Association\u2019s (NWSA) annual convention in New York City in 1876 and she joined the National Association of Colored Women (NACW) in 1895. In 1897 she relocated to Woodside in Queens, where she lived until her death four years later at the age of 60.\n\nRay\u2019s contributions to the practice of law continue well after her death. There are at least two annual awards made in her name: The Annual Charlotte E.

She and her three sisters, along with their parents, lived above her father\u2019s tire and appliance store in the city. As a teenager, Rae quickly got involved with a local radio station as well as the local children\u2019s theater, and further sculpted her talents during an apprenticeship with a traveling professional theater company.

She showed off her voice and comedic chops in theaters and nightclubs like Village Vanguard and the iconic Blue Angel, where other well-known talents like Barbra Streisand and Mike Nichols also got their start.\n\nRae married TV and film producer John Strauss in 1951, and was finally given a chance to shine soon after, making her Broadway debut in the musical comedy Three Wishes for Jamie in 1952. She would then appear in a revival of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill's Threepenny Opera alongside Bae Arthur and John Astin, as well as in the musical Li'l Abner, based on the popular comic strip of the same name.\n\nAnxious to market herself as a multi-talented star, Rae released her first (and only) solo album in 1955, Songs I Taught My Mother. Her husband worked as director on the project, recording the music and managing the band during the process.\n\nIn addition to all of her work in music and musical theater, the 1950s brought Rae\u2019s first television spots.

The series ran for nine seasons, with Rae parting ways with the show at the beginning of the eighth in 1986. She was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Lead Actress in a Comedy for the part.\n\n\u201cPeople of a certain age still remember me as Edna Garrett,\u201d Rae said of her defining role. \u201cThey often want to give me a hug because the character was so warm and nurturing.

She admitted that many of the actresses on the show suffered behind the scenes, feeling body-shamed by the producers. Apparently, the show had a scale backstage to weigh the girls on a regular basis.\n\n\"The more they tried to pressure them and weigh them and threaten them, the more they would eat,\" Rae said. \"It's not the way you handle adolescence. You don't do that.\"\n\nIn 2017, Rae revealed to People that she had been diagnosed with bone cancer, seven years after battling pancreatic cancer, which her mother, uncle, and elder sister died from. At the time, she offered some advice to people as they get older.\n\n\u201cEvery day is a birthday,\" Rae said. \"I want to tell everybody to celebrate every day, to savor the day and be good to yourself, love yourself, and then you can be good to others and be of service to others.\u201d\n\nShe is survived by her sister, Miriam Guten as well as her son Larry, whom she shared with ex-husband John Strauss.

Parents must lay down ground rules for their children to help them to grow up and to learn responsibility for their actions. They must learn to stand on their own two feet.\u201d\n\nBorn Charlotte Rae Lubotsky in Milwaukee on April 22, 1926, she was one of three daughters of Russian Jewish immigrants.\n\nRae caught the acting bug early, performing with the Children\u2019s Theatre of Wauwatosa and acting on the radio. As a teenager, she won a summer apprenticeship with the Port Players, a professional summer theater company. She also was a regular on stage at Shorewood High School.\n\nIn 1944, Rae headed to Northwestern University and studied alongside the likes of Charlton Heston, Paul Lynde, Patricia Neal, Jeffrey Hunter, Agnes Nixon and future Fiddler on the Roof lyricist Sheldon Harnick. Her roommate was Cloris Leachman. (Decades later, Leachman would replace Rae for the final two seasons of Facts of Life.)\n\nAround 1948, Rae made the decision to leave school to seek fame and fortune in New York. A versatile singer and dancer, she could often be seen at the Blue Angel or the Village Vanguard.\n\nIn 1951, Rae married film composer and music editor John Strauss. The couple had two sons, Larry and Andrew. Rae and Strauss stayed together for more than 25 years until he revealed that he was bisexual and wanted an open marriage. They divorced in 1976.\n\nRae made her Broadway debut in 1952 in the musical comedy Three Wishes for Jamie, then followed with a turn as Mrs. Peachum in the 1954 revival of The Threepenny Opera. The cast also included Bea Arthur, John Astin and Paul Dooley. In 1956, she created the role of Mammy Yokum in the original Broadway production of L\u2019il Abner.\n\nRae received the first of two Tony noms in 1966, as best featured actress in a musical for Pickwick. The second came in 1969 when she was nominated as best actress in a play for Morning, Noon and Night.\n\nIn 1955, Rae recorded the album Songs I Taught My Mother. Subtitled Silly, Sinful and Satiric Selections, it featured songs by Cole Porter, Lorenz Hart & Richard Rodgers, Marc Blitzstein, Vernon Duke and Harnick.\n\nRae also began her extensive television career in the 1950s, with appearances on The United States Steel Hour and The Phil Silvers Show. A role that really brought her attention came in 1961 when she was cast as Sylvia Schnauser, the wife of Officer Leo Schnauser, played by Al Lewis, in the NBC sitcom Car 54, Where Are You?\n\n\u201cI was doing a lot of drama until I took the comedy role in the series Car 54, Where Are You?, and I\u2019ve been tagged as a comedian ever since,\u201d she said in 1985.\n\nWhen not appearing onstage, Rae worked steadily in television throughout the 1960s and \u201870s on such series as The Defenders; The Partridge Family; McMillan & Wife; Love, American Style; All in the Family; Good Times; and Barney Miller. She played Molly the Mail Lady on Sesame Street and was a regular on The Rich Little Show. In 1975, she received an Emmy nomination for her performance in the telefilm Queen of the Stardust Ballroom.\n\nRae also popped up in features, taking on comedic roles in Bananas as well as Hello Down There (1969), Jenny (1970),The Hot Rock (1972) and Hair (1979).\n\nRae was a favorite of legendary TV producer Norman Lear. The two had met in the 1950s when he was writing for The Colgate Comedy Hour. In addition to giving her guest shots on his sitcoms, Lear cast her as Mrs. Bellotti in Hot L Baltimore, the short-lived 1975 adaptation of Lanford Wilson\u2019s hit 1973 play.\n\nIn 1978, Fred Silverman, then president of ratings-laggard NBC, was high on a sitcom concept called 45 Minutes From Harlem, about a wealthy, white New York industrialist who becomes a foster parent to two orphaned African-American boys who were children of a former employee. The show was being fashioned for Maude co-star Conrad Bain and a newly discovered child actor, Gary Coleman.\n\nSilverman wanted Lear to produce. To entice him, Silverman cast Rae as the household\u2019s wisecracking maid. The ploy worked, and Lear\u2019s company, Tandem Productions, produced the show.\n\nRae remembered the unusual meeting where she secured the part. At the time, she was filming a guest spot for The Eddie Capra Murder Mysteries and showed up in costume to audition for the role of Mrs. Garrett. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have me read, we just talked, and they asked me about how I felt this housekeeper should be with these two boys and with Mr. Drummond [Bain\u2019s character], and I told him the way I felt. The next thing I knew, I had the part.\u201d\n\nRounding out the cast were Todd Bridges as Willis, the older brother of Coleman\u2019s character Arnold, and Dana Plato as Kimberly, the biological daughter of Drummond.\n\nDiff\u2019rent Strokes became a hit shortly after debuting in November 1978. Coleman was the breakout star as his catchphrase, \u201cWha\u2019chu talkin\u2018 \u2019bout, Willis?\u201d became part of TV history. But as the first season unfolded, the growing popularity of Edna Garrett became apparent. The producers designed an episode with an eye towards a spinoff.\n\nThe season\u2019s last entry, \u201cThe Girls School,\u201d found Mrs. Garrett meeting and bonding with a group of youngsters at East Lake School for Girls, a prestigious prep school that Kimberly was attending. NBC execs liked what they saw and ordered a series. The Facts of Life debuted the following August.\n\nThough the basic premise of Edna Garrett guiding the girl\u2019s through life\u2019s traumas remained throughout its run, the sitcom evolved throughout its nine seasons. The first season featured seven young girls in the cast, including a young Molly Ringwald. By the second season, four of those girls were gone. The three that remained included Lisa Whelchel as Blair, the spoiled rich girl; Kim Fields as gossip Tootie; and Mindy Cohn as the naive Natalie. Nancy McKeon was added as Jo, a rough-around-the-edges Bronx girl. Mrs. Garrett also transformed from housemother to the school\u2019s dietician.\n\nIn season five, Mrs. Garrett went into business for herself, creating Edna\u2019s Edibles, a gourmet food shop. Season seven saw the introduction of Blair\u2019s cousin Geri Tyler, who had cerebral palsy. Played by Geri Jewell, who also had the disorder, it marked the first time a character with a disability had a recurring role on a series.\n\nBy season seven, Rae was feeling that her character was getting stale and asked that her role be reduced. The producers decided to write her out entirely, marrying off Mrs. Garrett and sending her to Africa to work in the Peace Corps. Leachman was introduced as Garrett\u2019s sister, Beverly, who came in to take over the shop and watch over the girls.\n\nAfter leaving Facts of Life, Rae remained busy, with work on TV shows including 101 Dalmatians: The Series; ER; The King of Queens; Murder, She Wrote; Sisters; and Girl Meets World; and such films as You Don\u2019t Mess With the Zohan (2008), Love Sick Love (2012) and Ricki and the Flash (2015).\n\nAs syndication fueled the popularity of Facts of Life, Rae was lured back to play the character that had made her a star. She revisited Mrs. Garrett in 1982 with The Facts of Life Goes to Paris and in 2001 for The Facts of Life Reunion. Rae skipped 1987\u2019s The Facts of Life Down Under (that one featured Leachman as her sister).\n\nIn 2015, Rae released her memoir, The Facts of My Life. Written with her son Larry Strauss, it revealed her struggle to come to grips with her husband\u2019s sexuality and her battle with alcoholism.\n\nIn addition to her son Larry and his wife, Eleanor, survivors include her sister, Miriam, and grandchildren Sean, Carly and Nora. Her other son Andrew died in 1999 of a heart attack.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, her family asked that donations be made to The Actors Fund, Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (Pan-Can) or the Clare Foundation."}, {"url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/6949599/charlotte-rae-lubotsky-facts-of-life-different-strokes/", "page_content": "THE actress had a career spanning over sixty years until she died at the age of 92.\n\nHere's all you need to know about the veteran star.\n\n2 Charlotte Rae Lubotsky was an actress famous for starring in Diff'rent Strokes and The Facts of Life Credit: Rex Features\n\nWho was Charlotte Rae Lubotsky?\n\nCharlotte Rae Lubotsky was an American actress, comedian, singer and dancer born in Wisconsin on April 22, 1926.\n\nShe was best known for playing Edna Garrett in Diff'rent Strokes and its spin-off The Facts of Life.\n\nAs well as her work with the subsequent The Facts of Life TV movies, she provided the voice for Nanny in 101 Dalmatians: The Series.\n\nMore recently the actress starred in 2015's Ricki and the Flash alongside Meryl Streep.\n\nCharlotte was married to composer John Strauss from 1951 to 1976 when he revealed he was bisexual.\n\nThe couple shared two sons - Andrew and Larry - who helped her write her 2015 autobiography The Facts of my Life.\n\n2 Charlotte played well-loved character Edna Garrett Credit: Kobal Collection - Shutterstock\n\nHow did The Facts of Life actress die?\n\nAt a screening in 2009 Charlotte was diagnosed early with pancreatic cancer but made a full recovery six months later.\n\nBut in 2017 she was diagnosed with bone cancer at the age of 91.\n\nAfter battling with the disease the actress died at her home in Los Angeles on August 5, 2018, aged 92\n\nWho did she play in Diff'rent Strokes?\n\nCharlotte played housekeeper Edna Garrett.\n\nEdna looked after the Drummond family in New York after Willis and Arnold's mum Lucy died.\n\nThe character was so loved that she was given her own spin-off - The Facts of Life.\n\nThe Facts of Life ran from 1979-1988 and saw Edna take on the role of housemother in a boarding school."}, {"url": "https://www.emmys.com/bios/charlotte-rae", "page_content": "After several years as a stage actress, in 1954, Rae began working steadily in television, initially on variety shows such as Armstrong Circle Theatre, Kraft Television Theatre, NBC Television Opera Theatre, The Philco Television Playhouse, The Colgate Comedy Hour, The DuPont Show of the Week, and The Phil Silvers Show.\n\nCharlotte Rae was an American actress, comedienne, singer and dancer.\n\nAfter several years as a stage actress, in 1954, Rae began working steadily in television, initially on variety shows such as Armstrong Circle Theatre, Kraft Television Theatre, NBC Television Opera Theatre, The Philco Television Playhouse, The Colgate Comedy Hour, The DuPont Show of the Week, and The Phil Silvers Show.\n\nHer first significant success was on the sitcom Car 54, Where Are You?, in which she played Sylvia Schnauzer, the wife of Officer Leo Schnauzer (played by Al Lewis).

She turned 92 this April 22, and she died Aug. 5, 2018, peacefully in her condo in Los Angeles surrounded by love.\n\nYou can read her obituary in the New York Times, People, Entertainment Weekly, etc. They talk of her roles on Broadway, her Emmy and Tony nominations, her early comedy acts and cabaret singing, her work in films and TV, her alcoholism and longtime sobriety, her pacemaker, pancreatic cancer, bone cancer and much more.\n\nI want to share her as I remember her.\n\nShe almost always wore a scarf, usually red, around her neck, and often a comfy running suit. She was short and getting shorter. She loved asparagus. She talked to my mom twice a day, sometimes more.\n\nThough best known for her comedic roles, she wasn\u2019t always funny nor was she always \u201con.\u201d She needed her naps and her down time \u2014 and made sure she got them \u2014 but she was up for fun, too. Her zest for life was contagious.\n\nShe was a feminist, a fierce Democrat and an ardent Zionist, who tried to engage me in talking about Israeli politics. I\u2019d enlist my more knowledgeable husband for that role. Her famous\n\nquivery voice would get strident and those talks provided fuel for my husband\u2019s friendly imitations of her.\n\nWhile she pursued her career ambitiously, she was a devoted mother to her sons, Andy and Larry. And she was very connected to her sisters, the late Beverly Levin, a trained opera singer, and my mom, Miriam Guten, a composer and pianist in Dallas. Together, they made a formidable trio.\n\nOnce she and I tagged along on a trip my parents took to Western Canada. We didn\u2019t work out as roommates because of my snoring, but we bonded over our mutual love of nature. This trip was during the heyday of Facts of Life, and she was approached constantly by fans. I loved how she handled each respectfully, then quietly said she was with her family and returned to us.\n\nFamily was supremely important to her. She devised a plan to spend Thanksgivings together. The first year we had a wonderful family meal at her Brentwood home, where she loved her lemon trees. That year, she was the Grand Marshal in the Rose Bowl Parade and we all got to hang out in the Green Room with the other celebs beforehand. Brushes with fame were fun.\n\nFor years, every family simchah included a performance of parodies roasting and toasting the honoree \u2014 with sisters Charlotte and Beverly vying for starring roles and all of us making up the chorus. Mom directed and accompanied us on the piano.\n\nAunt Charlotte loved to sing and had incredible phrasing that came from the heart. When she sang \u201cMake Someone Happy\u201d at the rehearsal dinner for my wedding, she had everyone in tears.\n\nAs she faced her heart problems and cancers, I admired her bravery. She loved life and filled it with friends, family, work and more adventures.\n\nI talked to her fairly often, but last saw her in June when we all came to L.A. for her granddaughter\u2019s wedding. She was weak and thin and sleepy, but that special spark was still there.

Her death was confirmed by her manager, Paul Hilepo.\n\nRae got her start in the theater, eventually acting on Broadway. However, it\u2019s her television work that made her a household name. She was best known as Edna Garrett, a flame-haired housekeeper to three children on Diff\u2019rent Strokes. She continued the role on the Strokes spin-off, The Facts of Life. In that series, Garrett leaves the house to go care for several teenage girls who attend a private school. The show began airing in 1979; Garrett stuck with it until the eighth season, eventually bowing out due to health problems.

Rae has never been shy about describing the difficulty of being an actor in those days: \u201cBeing an actor is not like any other job. It\u2019s not easy. I felt like a hooker!\u201d she joked in a 2016 interview. \u201cYou never know when your next job is going to come along.\u201d\n\nShe first played Mrs. Garrett, a frank, funny housekeeper with a distinctive bouffant, in 1978 in Diff\u2019rent Strokes. She carried on the role until 1984, going between that show and The Facts of Life. Though the actress left the role behind in the mid-1980s, she kept acting, returning to the stage and turning up in shows like ER and Pretty Little Liars, as well as movies like Ricki and the Flash, acting alongside Meryl Streep.\n\nThe actress was married from 1951 to 1975 to composer and sound editor John Strauss, with whom she often collaborated.

This week, we honor the life of Charlotte Rae, born Charlotte Rae Lubotsky, who brought joy, and wisdom as Mrs. Garrett in \u201cDiff\u2019rent Strokes\u201d and the subsequent \u201cThe Facts of Life.\u201d On Sunday, she died at 92 from bone cancer. In her last year, choosing to forgo treatment, she wrote, \u201cI\u2019m feeling so terrific and so glad to be above ground\u2026I\u2019d like to choose life.\u201d Up to her last, she chose life.\n\nRae\u2019s parents were both working class Russian-Jewish immigrants who raised her and her two sisters in Milwaukee. Her mother, a Zionist, was childhood friends with Golda Meir, Israel\u2019s fourth prime minister.\n\nAdvised to drop her Jewish-sounding last name early in her career, Rae found a foothold in show-business, ironically, playing Sylvia Schnauser on the TV comedy \u201cCar 54, Where Are You?\u201d Her star climbed as she took on several starring roles on Broadway, garnering a Tony nomination alongside an Emmy nomination.\n\nRae earned a small, recurring role as Edna Garrett, the family housekeeper, on \u201cDiff\u2019rent Strokes,\u201d and as her character became beloved, Deadline reports that it was Rae who suggested a spin-off surrounding her character. \u201cThe Facts of Life\u201d starred Rae as a house mother to a group of teenage girls, and made Rae a household name.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nRae\u2019s seven-year run on \u201cThe Facts of Life\u201d ended in 1986, but she continued acting and receiving major roles until 2015.

She acted alongside Meryl Streep in the 2015 film \u201cRicki and the Flash\u201d and showed off her still razor-sharp comedic skills in Adam Sandler\u2019s \u201cYou Don\u2019t Mess with the Zohan.\u201d\n\nRae was a survivor \u2014 after losing her mother and her sister to pancreatic cancer, she opted to be screened early and beat cancer. She co-wrote her autobiography, \u201cThe Facts of Life,\u201d with one of her two sons. In it, she wrote plainly about her struggles with alcoholism, raising an autistic son, and on her husband, John Strauss, coming out as bi-sexual.\n\n\u201cAt 91, every day is a birthday,\u201d she wrote. Her advice, after seven decades of making art and entertainment, was this: \u201cSavor the day and be good to yourself, love yourself, and then you can be good to others and be of service to others.\u201d\n\nJenny Singer is the deputy lifestyle editor for the Forward.

It was the role she introduced on the series Diff\u2019rent Strokes (1978-86) and, then, in its spin-off The Facts of Life (1979-88), which scored her a 1982 Emmy Award nomination in the category of Best Supporting Actress.\n\nCharlotte may have died on Aug. 5, 2018, after a battle with bone cancer, but one can imagine the incredible joy she would have gotten from the outpouring of love and memories that were devoted to her, conveying just how much of an impression her portrayal has had on the audience. When asked by the Television Academy Foundation what she hoped her legacy would be, she responded, \u201cIf I took people out of themselves and they forgot all their troubles for a little while, because I brought them there, that would make me very happy. And if I ever made them laugh \u2014 God knows we need as many laughs as we can get.\u201d\n\nWell done, Charlotte.\n\nGetty Images\n\nForty years ago, she was under a soon-to-expire contract at CBS when she had gotten a phone call from the office of Norman Lear (creator of All in the Family and The Jeffersons, among many others), asking her if she\u2019d be interested in coming over to NBC for the sitcom Diff\u2019rent Strokes. On the proposed show, she would play housekeeper Mrs. Garrett for the wealthy Phillip Drummond (Conrad Bain), his daughter Kimberly (Dana Plato), and his adopted sons Arnold (Gary Coleman) and Willis (Todd Bridges) Jackson. During the process, she was asked her opinion of the character and what she would bring to a household like this.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018The three children are without a mother, so I guess they need a little mothering, a lot of nice attention and a little guidance,'\u201d she responded. \u201c\u2018But no funny business with them. They\u2019ve got to know that there are certain rules that they have to adhere to. It can\u2019t be we just melt and love them to death every time we see them.'\u201d\n\nApparently, it worked because she was hired. But then let go, because of that CBS contract. Then again, Norman Lear, who was producing Diff\u2019rent Strokes, had just a wee bit of clout with CBS (not only for All in the Family and The Jeffersons, but Maude, Good Times, One Day at a Time\u2026 it\u2019s quite a list). A phone call later, Charlotte was free to bring Mrs. Garrett to life.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\u201cWhat a wonderful part,\u201d she stated. \u201cI loved that woman. She could cook, was a good housekeeper, and had all that love for the kids. We had the most delightful year; they were so darling and warm. Dana was a little flaky, but she was okay, but the boys were so sweet. And Gary Coleman\u2026 he was the star of the show. One producer, who was not connected with us, said, \u2018He\u2019s your meal ticket.\u2019 The whole thing with him is so sad, of course, because one day I went into his dressing room to tell him something and he was in dialysis. His mother was a nurse and supervised it, but no one ever talked about it. He was such a trooper and always delivered. Always\u2026 I don\u2019t want to talk about it anymore, because he\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nCharlotte learned a fact of life \u2014 popular TV shows spawn spin-offs.\n\nBy the end of the first season of Diff\u2019rent Strokes, Charlotte was, admittedly, growing nervous. Throughout the year her lines had been cut down (\u201cTwelve lines in the last show\u201d) and she was finding herself with less and less to do. Then one of the producers asked if they could have dinner, and she assumed she was about to get the ax. Instead, she was told Fred Silverman, who had taken over programming for NBC (after having turned things around for CBS and ABC), was a fan of her portrayal of Sylvia Schnauser on the Fred Gwynne sitcom, Car 54, Where Are You, and wanted to spin her character off into a show about a housemother in a girl\u2019s school. \u201cAnd that was the beginning of The Facts of Life and a whole different world for me,\u201d she said.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThat world, it should be pointed out, brought with it a sense of anxiety all its own. Not that Charlotte didn\u2019t think she was up to the challenge, but, rather, what would happen if, unlike Diff\u2019rent Strokes, it didn\u2019t work for the network and was canceled? She had just come out of a divorce after 25 years of marriage and suddenly losing a steady source of income would bring real-world repercussions. But the thing that turned that around was the assurance that, should Facts of Life be quickly canceled, Mrs. Garrett would be able to return to the Drummond household.\n\n\u201cAnd in the beginning, the ratings were very low,\u201d Charlotte noted, \u201cbut we found out that NBC kept it, because everything was low with them at the time. But when summertime came and the reruns were on all the different networks, people starting turning us on and getting hooked on our show.\u201d\n\nGetty Images\n\nThat show was initially set at Eastland School (eventually Eastland Academy), a private all-girls school in upstate New York, where Edna Garrett serves as housemother at a dormitory. In the first couple of seasons, there was a bit of a cast shake-up with the girls, eventually settling on the wealthy and spoiled Blair Warner (Lisa Whelchel), the humorous Natalie Green (Mindy Cohn), the youngest among them, Dorothy \u201cTootie\u201d Ramsey (Kim Fields); and, in season two, tomboy Jo Polniaczek (Nancy McKeon). Lost in the mix, among others, was \u201980s movie sweetheart Molly Ringwald.\n\nFor research purposes, Charlotte and producers actually went to an all-girls school that the daughter of one of the show\u2019s producer\u2019s attended, asking the girls a wide variety of questions, some of which had to do with what they wanted to achieve in the future. \u201cThis one little girl was chubby and Jewish, and so funny, and I thought that would be a wonderful supplement to the other three girls who were Christian, and one of them was African American with this funny little voice. It was Mindy Cohn, who was very funny and cute. She had never done a professional thing in her life, but I recommended her and she read and they took her.\u201d\n\nGetty Images\n\nOne way in which that backfired is that it created a bit of distance between Charlotte and the rest of the cast. They assumed that since she was involved in bringing Mindy on the show, she was a part of management and essentially kept their distance in the beginning.\n\n\u201cThey were very polite,\u201d Charlotte emphasized, \u201cbut they were not willing to get close at first. Years later, Nancy said, \u2018We thought you were management,\u2019 and I said, \u2018No, I was just part of the team.'\u201d\n\nOne of her strongest memories of the show is working with the other actresses, and the genuine care that they all had for each other. \u201cThey would take cigarettes out of my mouth,\u201d she laughed. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful to them, because I didn\u2019t smoke more than five cigarettes a day, but they kept pulling them out anyway. And when I had my pacemaker put in over Labor Day Weekend, because I was nominated for an Emmy they brought me an Academy Award statue that said, \u2018The cream always rises to the top.\u2019 Just very sweet. And when we went to Paris together to shoot the TV movie The Facts of Life Go to Paris, we all had such a wonderful time.\u201d\n\nThe Facts were always changing.\n\nThe general public may not realize this, but The Facts of Life managed to touch on a number of issues facing teenage girls growing into womanhood. Not the least of which was body shaming, which actually became an issue for some of the cast members for real. \u201cI had no idea they were being weighed by the producers,\u201d said Charlotte of a process apparently done to make sure they didn\u2019t get too heavy for the camera, \u201cwhich was so stupid, because the more they tried to weigh them, the more they would want to eat. I mean, teenagers \u2014 that\u2019s what they do. You can\u2019t tell them things like that.\u201d\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe other thing about the series is that it was one that was always trying to change as the girls were getting older. Season 2, as noted above, saw the cast cut down and Mrs. Garrett adding school nutritionist to her duties. By the end of Season 4, Jo and Blair graduated from Eastland Academy, so a means had to be contrived to keep everyone together. At the start of Season 5, Mrs. Garrett opened up a gourmet food venture called \u201cEdna\u2019s Edibles,\u201d which would see the four girls living and working with her there. In Season 7, the store was destroyed in a fire, resulting in the girls deciding to rebuild and turn it into a pop-culture gift shop they called \u201cOver Our Heads.\u201d George Clooney was also added to the cast (and how are you going wrong by adding George in the days when you could still afford to add him?).\n\nFor Charlotte, The Facts of Life had run its course, reducing her role in seasons six and seven and her leaving right after the start of season eight (Mrs. Garrett getting married and moving to Africa to work for the Peace Corps, replaced by Cloris Leachman as a new character). The show ran a total of nine seasons, and could have run more except for the fact that both Nancy McKeon and Mindy Cohn were ready to move on.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\u201cWhen it was getting towards the seventh year,\u201d Charlotte detailed, \u201cI felt I couldn\u2019t go on for two more years, which is what they asked everyone to do. It didn\u2019t feel right to me, because I knew the focus was going to be even more on the kids and the kids don\u2019t need that much guidance anymore. They helped each other, more or less. They didn\u2019t seem to be writing for me to be talking to them about my experiences anymore, so I thought I\u2019d like to go back and do stage work and travel and enjoy myself, which I did. So I did a crazy thing \u2014 after everyone said I should stay and get every nickel I could. I did have a moment where I thought, \u2018This is my one big thing. It\u2019s a miracle that I got it.\u2019 A lot of people get on a series and it\u2019s not successful. But you only live once.\u201d\n\nAnd as the years passed, she took great peace in the fact that the work they\u2019d done actually touched fans of the show in one way or another.\n\n\u201cI get a kick out of people remembering me,\u201d she smiled.\u201dOne time I was in New York and was coming out of the subway with a friend \u2014 we had gone to see something in the Village \u2014 and as we got off the subway and went up the stairs, this big guy saw me and yelled, \u2018I knew it!\u2019 He and I embraced and then he went his way and I went mine. Some movie and TV stars don\u2019t like it, but I tell them, \u2018You know, you\u2019re in their home all the time. You\u2019re in between their feet if they\u2019re in bed looking at television. I mean, it\u2019s a very intimate relationship.'\u201d"}, {"url": "https://actingmagazine.com/2018/08/charlotte-rae-dies-at-92/", "page_content": "\n\nCharlotte Rae, best known as Mrs. Garrett on Facts of Life & Diff\u2019rent Strokes, dies at 92, after a battle with cancer.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nCharlotte Rae\u2019s representatives confirmed that Rae, best known to television viewers as Mrs. Garrett from the hit television show Diff\u2019rent Strokes and its spinoff, Facts of Life, has passed away after a battle with cancer.

She was 92.\n\nThe story of Charlotte Rae dead at 92 years old early life\n\n\n\nShe was born Charlotte Rae Lubotsky on April 22, 1926, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Russian Jewish immigrants Esther (n\u00e9e Ottenstein), who was a childhood friend of Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, and Meyer Lubotsky, a retail tire business owner. One of three sisters, her siblings, are Miriam and the late Beverly (1921 \u2013 1998). For the first ten years or so of her life, Rae\u2019s family lived in Milwaukee, then moved to Shorewood, Wisconsin. She graduated from Shorewood High School in 1944. She did radio work and was with the Wauwatosa Children\u2019s Theatre. In 1942, at age 16, she was an apprentice with the Port Players, a professional theater company that came for the summer to Milwaukee, with several established actors such as Morton DaCosta, who would eventually direct The Music Man on Broadway.\n\nRae attended Northwestern University, although she did not complete her studies, where she met Cloris Leachman, who many years later succeeded Rae on The Facts of Life for the show\u2019s last two seasons. At Northwestern she met several then-unknown stars and producers, including Agnes Nixon, Charlton Heston, Paul Lynde, Gerald Freedman, Claude Akins and songwriter Sheldon Harnick. In a 2016 interview with Milwaukee Talks, she said about her decision in appearing in only dramatic television: \u201cWhen I started out, I wanted to be a serious actor, I never thought I\u2019d get into comedy.\u201d When a radio personality told her that her last name wouldn\u2019t do, she dropped it, to her father\u2019s chagrin.\n\nShe moved to New York City in 1948, where she performed in the theater and nightclubs. During her early years in New York, she worked at the Village Vanguard (alongside up-and-coming talents such as singer Richard Dyer-Bennet) and at the posh Blue Angel, home to budding talents Barbra Streisand, Mike Nichols and Elaine May. She moved to Los Angeles in 1974.\n\nCredits"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/31/arts/television/betty-white-dead.html", "page_content": "Ms. White won her final Emmy in 2010 as outstanding guest actress in a comedy series for hosting the Mother\u2019s Day episode of \u201cS.N.L.\u201d She followed that appearance with a regular role on yet another sitcom, \u201cHot in Cleveland,\u201d and then with a book contract and her own reality show. She was bigger than she had been in decades. But she didn\u2019t see her resurgence as a comeback.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working steady for 63 years,\u201d she said in an interview for the ABC News program \u201cNightline\u201d in 2010. \u201cBut everybody says, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s such a renaissance.\u2019 Maybe I went away and didn\u2019t know it.\u201d\n\nMs. White was over 50 and already a television veteran when she first appeared on \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d but her work there elevated her career to a new level.\n\nA comedy about a young, single television news producer in Minneapolis, \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d was one of the most popular sitcoms of its day or any other, thanks to smart writing, Ms. Moore\u2019s charismatic presence and a high-caliber supporting cast. Even in the company of scene-stealing actors like Ms. Moore, Ed Asner and Valerie Harper, Ms. White\u2019s Sue Ann stood out.\n\nThe character, introduced in the show\u2019s fourth season, was conceived as cloying, calculating and predatory, her deviousness always accompanied by a charming smile. The producers wanted a \u201cBetty White type\u201d to play the role, but they did not immediately ask Ms. White because she and Ms. Moore were close friends and the producers were afraid that there would be damage to the friendship if she didn\u2019t get the role, or didn\u2019t want it."}]}
