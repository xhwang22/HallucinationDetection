Gameiro, stylishly celebrating his first international for five years, then completed the scoring with his second goal of the night in the 59th minute.\n\nFrance, with four points from two games, are joint top of the group alongside Holland and Sweden. Bulgaria occupy fourth position on three points.\n\nQuincy Promes scored two early goals to set Holland on their way to a 4-1 victory over Belarus and end a miserable run of home form. Davy Klaassen and Vincent Janssen added two more in the second half as the Dutch, who finished third at the last World Cup in Brazil but failed to qualify for Euro 2016, ended an unprecedented run of five successive home defeats stretching back 16 months.\n\nPromes\u2019 opener in the 14th minute marked his first international goal as he hit the ball through the legs of three defenders. He added a second 15 minutes later with a strong finish from the edge of the penalty area. Belarus threatened with two good chances before the break and then scored straight after it with Sergei Kornilenko\u2019s strong run setting up Aleksey Rios for a close-range finish.\n\nBut the Dutch quickly restored their two-goal advantage in the 54th minute as Klaassen tapped home the rebound after Belarus had lost possession on the edge of their own area. Janssen struck the woodwork but found the net with a thunderous left-foot shot as the Dutch moved to four points from their opening two qualifiers after a draw in Sweden last month. They host France in Amsterdam on Monday.\n\nSweden remain unbeaten after their first two matches thanks to Mikael Lustig\u2019s second-half winner in Luxembourg. The Celtic defender\u2019s half-volley from Marcus Berg\u2019s corner was the only goal of the game.\n\nBelgium hammered Bosnia-Herzegovina 4-0 for their second straight World Cup qualifying win under Roberto Mart\u00ednez, brushing off injuries to lead Europe\u2019s Group H. The European Championship quarter-finalists exposed weaknesses in a Bosnian defence that buckled in the 26th minute when Emir Spahic scored an own-goal.\n\nTwo minutes later a gifted touch from Dries Mertens found Eden Hazard, who ran by defenders and chipped the ball past the goalkeeper, Asmir Begovic.\n\nThe normally well-composed Bosnians were forced into spells of panic defending and Toby Alderweireld made it 3-0 on the hour. Besieged by five Bosnian players, Romelu Lukaku swung in the fourth.\n\nBelgium are level on points with Greece, who defeated a hard-working Cyprus 2-0 to continue their recovery under their new coach, Michael Skibbe.\n\nValentin Stocker came off the bench to score in the last minute and give Switzerland a 3-2 win away to Hungary after Adam Szalai had twice equalised for the hosts. Switzerland struggled to get going in the first half without the suspended Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka, who usually dictates the rhythm in midfield. But Haris Seferovic, the striker widely criticised for his performances at Euro 2016 when he failed to score a goal, put the Swiss in front six minutes after half-time, scoring from a rebound after Xherdan Shaqiri\u2019s shot was saved by Peter Gulacsi.\n\nSzalai equalised two minutes later, also from a rebound after his own shot hit the post. Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez put Switzerland back in front in the 67th minute, volleying home from Valon Behrami\u2019s lofted cross for his first international goal, only for Szalai to equalise again four minutes later. Switzerland were not to be denied, however, and snatched the points when a long thrown-in was twice headed on and Stocker scored at the far post.\n\nThe Swiss went top of Group B with six points from two matches following a game in which all five goals were scored after half-time, while Hungary were left with one point and already look unlikely to make a first World Cup appearance since 1986.\n\nThe Faroe Islands are second with four points after their shock 2-0 win in Latvia. Portugal and Latvia have three and Andorra none."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/soccer/sevilla-fc/story/2876687/", "page_content": "Sevilla striker Kevin Gameiro has said that he has felt forgotten about after his move from France to Spain.\n\nGameiro, 29, has scored 29 goals in all competitions this season including the equaliser in the Europa League final as Sevilla came from behind to beat Liverpool 3-1.\n\nBut the former Paris Saint-Germain player has not played for France since November 2011 and was only named on their standby list for Euro 2016.\n\nDespite Sevilla winning the Europa League three years in a row, he feels their relatively low profile in France explains why he has been underappreciated in his homeland.\n\n\"I was a little forgotten this last while,\" Gameiro told RMC. \"I've been at Sevilla for three years and I've managed to make a name for myself.\n\n\"I've had some flattering comments from some very big Spanish names. You see too that there are some very big clubs interested in me.\n\n\"I work hard every year to try to be as effective as possible for my club. It's true that Sevilla are not well publicised in France unfortunately -- because they're really a very big club with history.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Gameiro's teammate Adil Rami told the same station that he feels like his reputation has almost been called into question by France coach Didier Deschamps.\n\nThere was no place for Rami, 30, in France's Euro 2016 squad despite another centre-back, Liverpool's Mamadou Sakho, being left out because he is serving a provisional 30-day ban for an anti-doping violation.\n\nTo explain his decision-making process, Deschamps said he was not necessarily picking the best 23 French players but gathering a squad that he felt would get on well enough together to win next month's tournament.\n\nRami said those comments could cast doubt on players like him.\n\n\"You have to ask Didier Deschamps the question about my absence,\" he told RMC. \"I was really disappointed by one thing. His talk about not taking the best players on the pitch, but the best players to form a squad.\n\n\"I have the impression that he's insinuating that I'm not a good guy and that I'm a lout. If we're talking football, I don't see why I'm not at the Euros.\"\n\nRami said Deschamps advised him to leave Milan for Sevilla to boost his chances of playing at Euro 2016.\n\nAfter featuring in over 40 matches in La Liga, the Champions League and the Europa League this season, Rami is aggrieved that he will not get a chance to be involved for France.\n\nHe said: \"At a certain point, you have to take into account the statistics, the number of matches and the opponents that you've played against. I've taken on Barcelona, Real, Juventus, without talking about Valencia or Atletico Madrid.\n\n\"I feel a little injustice because the criteria for being included in the French team are the same for everyone.\""}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2016/10/06/the-long-wait-seems-over-for-france-forward-kevin-gameiro/91655440/", "page_content": "AP\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 It's been a long wait for Kevin Gameiro.\n\nBut in the absence of the injured Olivier Giroud and with Karim Benzema still out of the France squad, the Atletico Madrid forward will finally get the opportunity to establish himself for good in Didier Deschamps' team.\n\nGameiro, who joined Atletico in the offseason for a reported 30 million euros ($34 million), is expected to start alongside Madrid teammate Antoine Griezmann when France takes on Bulgaria on Friday at the Stade de France in a World Cup qualifier.\n\nThe European Championship runners-up, who were held to a 0-0 draw by Belarus in their Group A opener, will then travel to Amsterdam to play the Netherlands three days later.\n\nGriezmann, the top scorer at Euro 2016, is Deschamps' first choice, with Gameiro, Andre-Pierre Gignac, Anthony Martial and Nabil Fekir in competition to replace Giroud.\n\nThe Arsenal striker, who has not started a game this season with his club, has been hindered by a toe injury while Benzema \u2014 who has not appeared for France since being charged with blackmail over a sex-tape scandal \u2014 still has no place in the plans of Deschamps, at least on a short-term basis.\n\nThe double absence of Benzema and Giroud is likely to benefit the 29-year-old Gameiro, who has strong credentials for his inclusion. His main asset is the promising relationship he has started to build with Griezmann at Atletico. Despite Fernando Torres' competition that has been limiting his playing time, Gameiro has scored three goals and delivered as many assists in nine appearances.\n\n\"Individually, both of them are quality players and the fact that they are playing together with their club is a good thing,\" Deschamps said. \"They can improve their chemistry.\"\n\nGameiro started his international career six years ago and was regularly called by previous France coach Laurent Blanc, until a friendly game against the United States in November 2011. The former Sevilla player then had to wait nearly five years before wearing the France jersey again.\n\nGameiro, who scored the equalizer in the Europa League final as Sevilla came from behind to beat Liverpool 3-1, sometimes felt forgotten after he left Paris Saint-Germain to move abroad. He was selected on a list of reserve players for the European Championship but did not make the final cut, and finally received a proper call-up in September, making his ninth international appearance against Belarus after coming in as a substitute.\n\n\"It was a very long wait. These things happen during a career, but I never gave up,\" Gameiro said. \"Sevilla is a big club in Spain, but in France they don't get much exposure. Signing at Atletico Madrid put me one step above.\"\n\nAgainst a Bulgarian team that conceded three goals in its 4-3 opening win over Luxembourg, Deschamps will field an offensive-minded side, with Paul Pogba and Dimitri Payet also expected to start."}, {"url": "https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/transfer-news/who-kevin-gameiro-everything-spurs-13105455", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nDon't miss any of the latest and best Spurs news - sign up to the free Tottenham newsletter for updates straight to your inbox\n\nSpurs have been installed as favourites to sign Atletico Madrid striker Kevin Gameiro in the summer as Mauricio Pochettino looks to strengthen his squad.\n\nDespite Harry Kane\u2019s goalscoring heroics, Spurs are in need of bolstering their attacking options with Vincent Janssen struggling in his first season at White Hart Lane.\n\nIt\u2019s a position Pochettino needs to strengthen, especially with Janssen struggling to fill Kane\u2019s shoes when the striker missed a month of action towards the end of the season through injury.\n\nGameiro would prove to be a shrewd signing for Spurs but they would face competition for his signature.\n\nHere we take a look at the latest striker to be linked with a move to north London.\n\nWho is he?\n\nGameiro is a highly-rated striker who has enjoyed successful spells in Spain and France during his career.\n\nHe started his career with Strasbourg but he came to the attention of Paris Saint-Germain after scoring a number of goals for Lorient.\n\n(Image: JAVIER SORIANO/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIn 2013 he moved to Sevilla and scored 67 goals in 145 games, including a goal in their 3-1 win over Liverpool in the 2016 Europa League final.\n\nGameiro transferred to Atleti in the summer for \u00a327million but he has struggled to fulfil expectations in Madrid since his move.\n\nThe forward also plays for the French national team and scored twice for his country in their 4-1 World Cup qualifying win over Bulgaria in October.\n\nHow has he done this season?\n\nThe striker has endured a mixed season at the Vicente Calderon following his big-money move from Sevilla.\n\nGameiro has scored 16 goals in all competitions for Atleti, 12 in La Liga, but he has often rotated with Fernando Torres to partner Antoine Griezmann.\n\nAlthough he may not have hit the heights that he would have liked, 16 goals is a decent return to say he has been in and out of the starting XI.\n\nIn February he hit the headlines after scoring the fastest hat-trick in La Liga since 1995 in a time of four minutes and 43 seconds against Sporting Gijon.\n\nHowever, the Frenchman has endured a couple of barren runs without a goal but he has contributed seven assists for his teammates throughout the season.\n\nHow much would he cost?\n\n(Image: MIGUEL RIOPA/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nGameiro only joined Atleti last summer from Sevilla for a fee of \u00a327million so he will come at a price.\n\nDiego Simeone\u2019s team will want to recoup as much, if not more, of the transfer fee they paid their Spanish counterparts one year ago.\n\nReported interest from China could also drive the transfer fee up, especially with a number of Chinese Super League teams paying over the odds to bring some of Europe\u2019s top talent to their league.\n\nIf Spurs are willing to bring Gameiro to north London, then they will have to pay a hefty price.\n\nWho else is interested in him?\n\nSpurs are the 4/1 favourites with BetVictor to secure his services but they will face a battle with a number of other clubs to bring Gameiro to north London.\n\nManchester United are also reported to be interested in Gameiro, while Real Madrid and Barcelona are backed at 8/1.\n\nGameiro has also been linked with a return to former club Paris Saint-Germain and some Chinese clubs are also plotting a big-money move to bring the striker to the far east.\n\nWhat has he said?\n\nReports have been circulating around Spain that Rojiblancos may look to offload the striker as he has struggled to fulfil expectations since his summer move.\n\nHowever, despite the speculation, Gameiro took to Twitter nine day ago to let Atleti fans know that he has no intention of leaving the Spanish capital.\n\nHe said: \"Despite the rumours circulating, I'm not thinking about leaving.\n\n\"My greatest desire is to continue defending the Atleti colours for many years!!
