The NGBL was organized as a professional softball league in 1944 to keep the best players from migrating to the All-American League which was established in 1943. Nonetheless, Twi was one of those who transferred to the AAGPBL despite the NGBL\u2019s best efforts. She signed up to play for the Grand Rapids Chicks in 1945 and continued to be a member of the AAGPBL through the 1950 season.\n\nA solid defensive player, who routinely ranked among league leaders in fielding percentage, Twi was a starter in left field or first base in every game from 1945 to 1950 with few injury-related exceptions. In 1946 she led the league in runs with 78. In 1947, she was a member of the champion Grand Rapids Chicks. Her career totals included 274 runs, 429 hits, and 255 stolen bases. After leaving the AAGPBL, she remained active in sports, played a couple of more years in the NGBL, and enjoyed golf, hiking, and aerobics.\n\nTwi studied at Illinois State Normal and Indiana University and immediately landed a job as a physical education teacher at South Bend\u2019s Washington High School where she inspired kids for nearly 30 years. She also coached the school\u2019s softball and volleyball teams to several city championships.\n\nThose who knew Twi said she had a good sense of humor, civic pride, and was a joy to be around. South Bend Bat Girl, Ruth Davis, a longtime friend of Twi\u2019s who also taught high school in South Bend for 25 years, noted that Twi had a \u201creal dry wit . . . but she was warm and giving. If she heard of someone in need, she was quick to act, but she didn\u2019t seek out recognition after helping people. She was quiet about her charity work, and many weren\u2019t aware of the extent of her involvement.\u201d\n\nDavis recalled that when Twi just turned 70, in 1990, she still referred to her work for Meals-on-Wheels for 15 years as \u201cTaking food to the old people.\u201d Davis also noted that Twi always had \u201ca young and inquisitive mind,\u201d and that \u201cShe took classes at the community college in South Bend while in her 60s just so she could learn.\u201d\n\nBetsy Jochum was an outfielder for the South Bend Blue Sox during Twi\u2019s tenure in the AAGPBL and later became a teacher in South Bend and a friend of Twi\u2019s. She remembered Shively as a fierce competitor. \u201cShe was a good ball player back in a time when women didn\u2019t play sports.\u201d\n\nTwi succumbed to four years of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and a year-long fight with lung cancer in a Douglas, Michigan nursing home on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1999 at the age of 79. According to Gary Umphrey, another longtime friend who looked after Twi during her convalescence, she remained upbeat and lucid even as Alzheimer\u2019s and lung cancer beat her body down. \u201cShe was a sweet woman and I hated to see her uncomfortable,\u201d he said. About five days before she died, Umphrey was commiserating with her and said she defied the way Alzheimer\u2019s usually slurred her speech. \u201cShe opened her eyes, looked at me and said, \u2018I\u2019m not all that uncomfortable.\u2019 And that truly was her spirit\u2014tough to the end.\u201d\n\nSOURCE\n\nCompiled from Twi\u2019s obituary and other articles about her in the South Bend, (IN) Tribune at the end of November and beginning of December 1999."}, {"url": "https://www.biographies.net/biography/twila-shively/m/0hhtbrr", "page_content": "Who was Twila Shively?\n\nTwila Shively [\u2033Twi\u2033] was an American competitive baseball player.

She also won all four grand slams in doubles \u2013 one of only seven women to have done so.\n\nDespite those great achievements in France, the US, Australia and at Wimbledon, Fry was the least known and least celebrated of the generation of female American players who dominated tennis in the 1950s. While Louise Brough, Doris Hart and Margaret DuPont were grabbing the headlines, Fry was doggedly collecting a cupboard full of major titles a lot further under the radar.\n\nPartly that was because she refused to let the success go to her head, either at the time or later. On being told by the Orlando Sentinel writer David Whitley in 2000 that she had been Billie Jean King\u2019s idol, Fry replied: \u201cThat flatters me because I wasn\u2019t that good. I wasn\u2019t a natural. I could run and I could concentrate.\u201d\n\nThose undervalued assets were good enough to bring a decade of consistent success at the highest level even though her tireless chase-and-retrieve game did not always meet with approval from the purists. On the eve of playing the teenage sensation Maureen \u201cLittle Mo\u201d Connolly in a big match, Connolly\u2019s outspoken coach, Teach Tennant, said of Fry: \u201cNo one can win playing negative.\u201d Connolly had to play long and hard in that match \u2013 and in many others against Fry \u2013 to justify her coach\u2019s dismissive remark.\n\nShirley Fry playing at Wimbledon in 1951. Photograph: Hulton Deutsch/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nThe youngest of four children of Ida and Lester Fry, Shirley was born in Akron, Ohio, and educated at Central high school in the city. Encouraged by a father who loved sports and ran a tennis shop, she had begun playing tennis at the age of nine. She was noticed winning matches during her time studying for a degree in human relations at Rollins College, in Winter Park, Florida. She progressed quickly in tennis in the early years of the second world war, reaching the quarter finals of the US Championships at the age of 15, and achieving a world top 10 ranking in the late 1940s.\n\nHowever, it was not until 1951 that she was able to establish herself as a champion by beating Hart, then ranked world No 1, in the final of the French Championships, where the slow clay courts at Roland Garros were suited to her style. Although she continued to enjoy success on the tournament circuit in the following years, there was no money in amateur tennis and in the mid-50s, she was forced briefly to retire from tennis and to take a job as a copy girl on the St Petersburg Times in Florida.\n\nHer consistency and determination had not gone unnoticed, however, and in 1956 she received an invitation to join the US Wightman Cup team that was due to play Great Britain at Wimbledon that summer. With her travel expenses paid for, Fry embraced the opportunity, staying on in London so that she could play in the Wimbledon championships a few weeks later. There she won both the singles title, beating Britain\u2019s Angela Buxton 6-3, 6-1 in the final, and the mixed doubles title with the American Vic Seixas. Fry\u2019s run to the singles final required her to overcome two of the greatest players of her era \u2013 the No 1 seed, Brough, and the No 4 seed Althea Gibson, who would go on to win the title the following year.\n\nShirley Fry, far right, with members of the winning 1956 US Wightman Cup team, from left, Dorothy Head Knode, Beverly Baker Fleitz and Louise Brough, at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, London.

She retired from the game to raise their four children and, in later years, took up golf. She never mastered the game to her satisfaction but then she had never been carried away by her exceptional tennis prowess, either.\n\nKarl died in 1976. She is survived by their children, Mark, Scott, Lori and Karen, and 12 grandchildren."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/king-billie-jean-1943", "page_content": "King, Billie Jean (1943\u2014)\n\nAmerican champion tennis player and founder of the Women's Tennis Association who fought to ensure women's access to equal purses in major tournaments and helped establish a separate professional women's tennis tour.

The event featured Chinese rickshaws, Egyptian litters, and a crowd of 30,472 in the stands, in addition to 50 million television viewers, a baby pig named Larimore Hustle and a giant Sugar Daddy sucker. But the main attraction, large enough to draw heavyweight boxing champion George Foreman to Houston to present the winner's check, was a five-set tennis match scheduled between Wimbledon champion Billie Jean King and aging hustler and Wimbledon champion Bobby Riggs. How did a tennis match between this superlative player in her prime and a man 26 years her elder come to take on such importance? And what was the significance of King's 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 victory for women's tennis, women athletes in general and, in a larger sense, the women's movement in 1973? To understand fully takes a review of King's entire career.\n\nBorn in 1943, at the height of World War II, Billie Jean Moffitt grew up during the 1950s in Long Beach, California, in a family that she herself has described as \"Exhibit A: American Dream, Southern California Division.\" Her father worked as a firefighter, and her mother worked inside the home, raising Billie Jean and her younger brother Randy, born in 1948. As she remembers it, the young Billie Jean Moffitt always knew that she would do something important with her life, preferably in athletics, a realm in which both she and her brother were gifted (he would later be a pitcher for the San Francisco Giants). Growing up, Billie Jean played football, ran track, and played softball on a team for girls 15 and younger in Long Beach's Houghton Park. After realizing that there was no future for a woman in football or softball, she asked her father what sports would be open to her as she grew older, and he suggested golf, swimming, or tennis. Billie Jean found golf too slow and never liked the water, so tennis became her choice.\n\nAfter purchasing her first racquet for eight dollars with money she made doing odd jobs for the neighbors, ten-year-old Billie Jean began taking tennis lessons from Clyde Walker on the public courts at Houghton Park. She soon fell in love with the sport. After only three months of training, she reached the finals in her first tournament before losing 6-0, 6-0. From then on, Billie Jean was a fixture in Southern California tennis. She got her first taste of the tennis snobbery she would struggle against throughout her career when she played in the Girls' 13-Under singles at the Southern California Junior championships in June 1955. Perry T. Jones, president of the Southern California Tennis Association, refused to allow her to have her photograph taken with the other players because she was not wearing a tennis dress.\n\nOver the next few years, Billie Jean played in and around Los Angeles while reading extensively about the game. In 1958, she was invited to attend the National Girls' 15-Under championships, and, thanks to financial support from the Long Beach Tennis Patrons, she and her mother made the trip to Middletown, Ohio, where she lost in the quarterfinals. Following that, she began to take lessons from Alice Marble , Wimbledon and U.S. champion during the 1930s, who encouraged Billie Jean to think like a winner. By 1959, she was a member of the Southern California Junior Wightman Cup team, traveling regularly on the Eastern tennis circuit, playing against teams of girls from other parts of the United States. That year, Billie Jean attained her first national ranking, placing #19 on the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA) charts. In 1961, she made her first trip to England with doubles partner Karen Hantze . After winning the Queen's Club, the tournament immediately preceding Wimbledon, the two began to feel that they might have a chance at that most prestigious of tournaments. They were right. They beat Margaret Smith Court and Jan Lehane of Australia in straight sets, launching an unprecedented record of Wimbledon championships for Billie Jean.\n\nIn 1961, there were few opportunities for women tennis players to make money in their profession. The sport was in the grip of what Billie Jean has called \"shamateurism,\" with top players receiving money under the table from tournament sponsors for appearances, as well as free racquets and other equipment from manufacturers, and small per diem fees from the national federations that controlled the sport. A few men had been able to earn a living by turning professional, at the cost of further chances at the major championships, but women were typically unable to accomplish even that. That autumn, Billie Jean entered Los Angeles State College, planning to play tennis part time. While there, she met her future husband and business partner, Larry King, and in the fall of 1964 she left for Australia to spend three months being coached by Mervyn Rose, determined to devote herself to tennis full time.\n\nBy the fall of 1965, King was sure she could be the #1 tennis player on the women's circuit, a position she achieved the following year when she won her first Wimbledon singles title. In 1967, she adopted a new stance, vocally representing all tennis players struggling to put forth the idea that they would play just as hard as professionals as they had as \"ostensible\" amateurs. \"Nobody considers an amateur painter, or an amateur writer, or an amateur inventor necessarily more talented or dedicated than a professional,\" she said, so why insist that athletes not be paid for the entertainment they provide to a sports audience? In 1967, she expressed these views during her press conferences at the 1967 National championships at Forest Hills and was threatened with suspension by the USLTA if she continued to speak out against the rules of the game. Ultimately, King was not suspended, and she never hesitated thereafter to insist that athletes have the right\n\nto earn a living through sport and to govern themselves through professional organizations.\n\nLess than a month later, the British Lawn Tennis Association voted for open tennis, allowing both amateurs and professionals to compete against each other. Ironically, with the coming of the era of the open, the disparity between what the men and women could earn and the prize money they were offered became yet another injustice for King to address. In a shrewd assessment of the situation, she saw that professional women players must prove that they could attract an audience. Accordingly, she joined with Fran\u00e7oise Durr , Ann Jones , Rosemary Casals and six male touring professionals in the National Tennis League in traveling throughout Europe for the next two years, learning the business of tennis, promoting tournaments and handling the press at each stop. According to King, those two years taught crucial lessons that she applied in 1971, when the women began to run their own tour. Unfortunately, the stress put on her knees by that tour and the major tournaments she played during 1967 and 1968 also forced her to undergo the first of many knee operations in October 1968.\n\nBillie Jean King\"> When I die, at my funeral, nobody's going to talk about me. They're all just going to stand up and tell each other where they were the night I beat Bobby Riggs. \u2014Billie Jean King\n\nBy the fall of 1970, the new era of the tennis open had demonstrated to King and other women professionals that they were going to have to stand together to assert their right to fair treatment at tournaments. In a sport controlled by men, with tournaments run by men, the women often found themselves playing on outside courts in not-so-prime time and receiving relatively little public or financial credit despite their high-quality games. By that autumn, it was also evident that promoters were cutting back the number of tournaments that included women in order to reduce the women's share of the purses they would have to pay. According to King, the women players were initially not even asking for an equal share of tournament money, since they played best-of-three sets rather than the best-of-five sets played by the men. The fact that the women were not as physically strong as the men, and their games therefore not typically as heavy-hitting, was also seen as a justification for the lower purses. On the other hand, people did want to see the women play, which meant in King's mind that women's tennis was equal in entertainment value to men's tennis. During the last week of September 1970, to establish this point, King joined with Casals, Julie Heldman , Val Ziegenfuss, Kristy Pigeon, Nancy Richey, Peaches Bartkowicz, Kerry Melville, and Judy Dalton in signing contracts with World Tennis magazine to play in what was to become the first Virginia Slims tournament, to be held in Houston. Because the tournament was not sanctioned by the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association, all nine players were suspended. They responded by announcing an eight-tournament women's professional tennis circuit to be sponsored by World Tennis and Virginia Slims, to begin play in January 1971. King then took it upon herself to recruit other women to join the Virginia Slims tour, and although it was a struggle for the tour to survive through the early years, the players involved continued to promote their matches and encourage the growth of professional women's tennis for the sake of the next generation of women players.\n\nBy 1971, the money had begun to come in for Billie Jean King, who earned for the first time more than $100,000 playing tennis that year. The next year, she won over $100,000 in prize money again, regained her #1 ranking, and became the first Sportswoman of the Year ever named by Sports Illustrated. Thanks to her success and the arrival of new young tennis stars like Chris Evert , the women on the tour gained enough clout to require their own professional organization, the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), which King helped to found in 1973.\n\nAs King and other women tennis professionals forced the sports world to accept them as athletes and entertainers deserving fair treatment, women in other fields were demanding an end to sex discrimination. This so-called second wave of feminism demanded equal pay for equal work and, significantly for women athletes, equal access to opportunities for young girls to compete, breaking down the tradition that had limited girls' intramural games to times when boys were not using the facilities. As athletics had historically been extolled as a means for young boys to acquire the competitive spirit they would need later in life, people began to ask why girls should not also benefit from such competition. Those opposing women's sports argued that since women could not successfully compete with men, money and facilities should not be provided for young girls to perform in competitions that would necessarily be of inferior quality. In 1972, in response to demands that girls and young women be afforded more sports opportunities, Congress passed Title IX of the Civil Rights Act, which made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of sex in any federally funded educational institution. Thus, schools and colleges had to provide equal opportunity for sports involvement for all students. (Thousands of women active in college sports today have Title IX to thank.)\n\nIn light of the debate over the meaning and value of athletics for women and girls, the contest that took place at the Houston Astrodome between Bobby Riggs and Billie Jean King in the fall of 1973 had broad significance\u2014especially because Riggs had soundly beaten his first woman challenger, Margaret Smith Court, earlier that year. King believes that her victory over Riggs was not just a victory over one man but over the things for which he stood, including the notion that women could not compete equally with men in tennis or any other professional endeavor. \"We proved we don't choke under pressure,\" she said. Fortunately for King, her experiences as a speaker for women's rights and the nascent Virginia Slims tour prepared her for the circus-like atmosphere of the Riggs match. She would need those skills once more.\n\nIn 1981, just as her tennis career was winding down, King was faced with a lawsuit brought by her former lover, Marilyn Barnett , who accused King of backing out of a commitment to support her for the rest of her life. The suit brought to public attention a matter in her private life that King would have preferred to keep private. Determined to handle Barnett's accusations in a straightforward manner, King once again showed courage in the face of adversity and an understanding of the importance of her place as a public representative for women's athletics. She handled the issue honestly before the press. By refusing to hide or avoid confrontation, King thus defused the situation with Barnett, whose suit was ultimately thrown out of court by a California judge. She also helped other athletes, such as Martina Navratilova , to face the media when their own sexual orientation became the subject of controversy. King acknowledged that the Barnett lawsuit cost her a great deal of money in endorsements, including a contract to represent an exclusive line of Wimbledon clothing that was never finalized and the cancellation of other clothing contracts. On the other hand, in 1982 the NBC network not only kept Billie Jean King as an announcer for its Wimbledon coverage but broke with tradition by using her for commentary on some of the men's matches.\n\nAfter the 1973 Riggs match, King continued to play championship-caliber tennis throughout the decade. In 1975, she won her last Wimbledon singles final, but won the U.S. Open doubles title as late as 1980, 19 years after her first Wimbledon championship. Besides playing in major championships, she remained actively involved in the organization and promotion of TeamTennis, which she envisioned as an alternative way of showcasing tennis. Indeed, King argued that TeamTennis was a forum for new systems of scoring and for demonstrating that tennis should not be the sport of second chances that it traditionally had been. In recognition of her contributions to the game, Billie Jean King was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1987; in recognition of her work on behalf of women, she was elected to the Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York, in 1990, and received the Elizabeth Blackwell award in 1998. \"Everything I do is about equal opportunity,\" she said. \"Race, gender, sexual orientation. Let's get over it. Let's celebrate our differences.\"\n\nsources:\n\nBartlett, Michael, and Bob Gillen, eds. The Tennis Book. NY: Arbor House, 1981.\n\n\"The Battle of the Sexes,\" in Newsweek.

Now established in Boston, the four-time national champion was the doyenne of American tennis. She surveyed the local talent, including a hard-hitting teenager from Oregon named Margaret Osborne.\n\nOsborne\u2019s mother asked what she thought. Wightman didn\u2019t consider the youngster to be national champion material. \u201cShe\u2019s too nice. She doesn\u2019t have the killer instinct.\u201d Wightman knew a thing or two about what it took to destroy an opponent on the tennis court. Back in 1910 as Hazel Hotchkiss, she had won a golden match\u201348 points in a row\u2013against a poor girl in Seattle.\n\nWightman was a keen judge of talent, but she was wrong this time. She didn\u2019t misjudge Osborne\u2019s personality\u2013the youngster really was that nice, and her main flaw as a young player was her inability to finish points. But the apparent kindness wasn\u2019t what defined her on the tennis court. More than anything else, Margaret was calm, ignoring the annoyances that derailed other players and keeping her head when matches were tight.\n\nIn one title match after another, her unflappability was put to the test. Osborne won her first major at the 1946 French Championships, saving match points against Pauline Betz. Betz had beaten her in every previous meeting on clay and in most of their matches on other surfaces, too.\n\nMargaret won her first US national championship in 1948 in circumstances that are almost impossible to believe. They would\u2019ve overcome just about any other player. Two days before she was set to face the defending champion, her great friend and doubles partner Louise Brough, Osborne had learned that her father died after being hit by a car back home in California. Her mother convinced her to play anyway\u2013that\u2019s what Dad would\u2019ve wanted.\n\nThe match that ensued was, by games played, the longest in the tournament\u2019s history. Two rain delays stretched the contest even longer, further testing the players\u2019 nerves. Osborne and Brough both possessed devastating American Twist serves\u2013\u201ctwo bombs,\u201d as Doris Hart put it\u2013and neither could break for the first 26 games of the third set. Some spectators lost their patience with the stalemate, chanting \u201cBring on the men!\u201d Somehow, Margaret made the first move, and she won the match, 4-6, 6-4, 15-13.\n\nMaybe she didn\u2019t have the killer instinct, but at age 30, she had what it took to become the national champion.\n\n* * *\n\nMargaret Osborne duPont\u2013she gained a last name when she married businessman and horse breeder Will duPont in 1947\u2013is best known for her feats on the doubles court. With Brough, she won the title at Forest Hills for nine years running and 12 times overall. (She also won the women\u2019s doubles title the year before the streak began, with Sarah Palfrey Cooke.) Altogether, Brough and Osborne duPont won 20 majors together. Margaret added another 10 mixed doubles titles with four different partners over a span of nearly two decades.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to forget what a formidable\u2013and versatile\u2013singles player she was, as well. She won a second Roland Garros title in 1949, making her just the second American woman, after Helen Wills, to win the French twice. She is one of only 13 women to win two French titles as well as two (or more) other majors:\n\nSuzanne Lenglen Helen Wills Margaret Osborne duPont Doris Hart Maureen Connolly Margaret Court Chris Evert Martina Navratilova Steffi Graf Monica Seles Justine Henin Maria Sharapova Serena Williams\n\nIf you wanted to compile a ranking of the 13 best players of all time, you could do a lot worse than to start with this list.\n\nOsborne duPont\u2019s career haul of six major singles titles\u2013three at Forest Hills, two at the French, and one at Wimbledon\u2013puts her in elite company. The strikes against her were largely out of her control: her peak was relatively short, and she excelled during a relatively weak era, when Pauline Betz had just turned pro and the European game was still recovering from World War II.\n\nAnother putaway at net\n\nThe war limited her playing opportunities when she could have been at her peak. She didn\u2019t win her first major until 1946, when she was 28. She cut back on travel after her marriage in late 1947, and the 1950 season was the last time that she played at least 30 matches. An elite doubles player for two decades, she packed a lot of results into a much shorter span as a world-beater on the singles court.\n\n* * *\n\nIt\u2019s ironic that family life limited Osborne duPont\u2019s playing opportunities, because she married one of the great tennis fans of the 20th century.\n\nWilliam duPont, Jr. was a scion of the Delaware duPont family, whose fortune dated back nearly a century to its origins in the gunpowder business. Will was more interested in horses, and he turned the family\u2019s 400-acre estate, Bellevue Hall, into a center for his thoroughbred breeding and training operation.\n\nHe also converted Bellevue into a luxurious stop on the women\u2019s tennis circuit. He built eight tennis courts\u2013including grass, cement, and both outdoor and indoor clay. During World War II, some long-established tournaments were suspended, and duPont stepped into the breach. The estate in Wilmington, Delaware became part of the summer grass-court swing.\n\nPauline Betz played at Bellevue in 1944 and 1945, beating Margaret both years. She described the experience:\n\nAs many as thirty-six players at the same time have been living at [Bellevue] wondering what the poor folk were doing. We drop tennis clothes on the floor and receive them back laundered and ironed; breakfast and lunch at any hour; converge on the dinner table for home-grown steak or roast beef; raid the ice box once or twice per night for home-made ice-cream, and just can\u2019t understand how we gain weight during an exhausting tournament.\n\nMargaret said of Will, \u201cHe wasn\u2019t very good, but he sure loved to play.\u201d Perhaps it was inevitable that after he divorced his first wife in 1941, he would marry a tennis player. Alice Marble claimed that Will said he\u2019d leave his wife for her. Louise Brough told an interviewer much later in life that he had hit on her as well. Both Brough and Betz reported that Will always smelled bad, a trait they attributed to his eccentricity but might have been because he spent so much time with his horses.\n\nOsborne (left) and Brough at Wimbledon in 1947\n\nWhen Margaret married Will, her life changed. She would never again need to worry about money, and she developed a love of horses that would last for the remainder of her life, long after the couple divorced in 1964. But Will was set in his ways, and some of those habits got in the way of competitive tennis. She knew what she was getting into, but it must have bristled that her schedule was no longer her own.\n\nThe first thing that the world top-ranked singles player lost when she became Mrs. duPont was any kind of opportunity for post-match celebration. Will was a homebody, so after Margaret finished her last match at Forest Hills\u2013even if it was decided by an epic 15-13 third set\u2013they caught the 8:30 train back home to Wilmington.\n\nMore damaging to Osborne duPont\u2019s legacy, the marriage prevented her from ever playing in Australia. Will took his annual holiday in January, and he expected Margaret to accompany him to California. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, a succession of American stars\u2013Hart, Brough, Maureen Connolly\u2013made victorious trips Down Under. Given the opportunity, Osborne duPont probably would\u2019ve picked up another major and won the career slam\u2013very possibly doing the same in doubles as well.\n\n* * *\n\nI mentioned that Margaret was known for her calm under pressure. That didn\u2019t mean that her opponents had much chance to relax.\n\nS. Wallis Merrihew, the editor of American Lawn Tennis, assessed her game in 1942:\n\nShe has all the strokes and they are men\u2019s strokes. Maurice McLoughlin and Billy Johnston at their highest and best could scarcely surpass it. Her serve is ideal to go to the net on, her volley is on a par with it, she can smash and drive with the best of them.\n\nPauline Betz was particularly impressed by Margaret\u2019s overhead smash. In her autobiography, Wings On My Tennis Shoes, she made a brief list of the players with the best smashes. It was all men\u2013Jack Kramer, Richard \u201cPancho\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez, and so on\u2013except for one woman: Osborne duPont. Betz poked fun at her own shaky smash and said that unlike her, the likes of Kramer and Osborne \u201ccannot understand why there should ever be a question of missing.\u201d\n\nMargaret was a few years older than Kramer, and she reached her peak at about the same time. Kramer, along with Gonz\u00e1lez, Ted Schroeder, and others, popularized the \u201cBig Game\u201d\u2013relentless, high-percentage serve-and-volley tennis. The women\u2019s game had always been more baseline oriented, especially as generations of Americans tried to emulate the slugging prowess of Helen Wills.\n\nMargaret competing in the 1948 Wightman Cup\n\nOsborne duPont and Brough didn\u2019t quite adopt the all-out net attack that came to define the men\u2019s game, but they displayed an all-court prowess rarely seen at women\u2019s tournaments. It\u2019s part of what made them so deadly as a doubles team. Betz said that Osborne duPont was \u201calmost impossible to hit through or past in a doubles match,\u201d even if she sometimes missed volleys in singles.\n\n* * *\n\nForty times in their career, \u201cOzzie\u201d and \u201cBroughie\u201d faced off in singles. (This was not a strong era for nicknames.) Brough won their first eight meetings, and they split the rest down the middle. 27 of their encounters were in finals, 4 of them with a grand slam title on the line.\n\nOsborne duPont\u2019s one triumph over Brough in a major final came in the epic 1948 match at Forest Hills. The other three didn\u2019t quite measure up to the same standard, but the big-serving duo always made things interesting. At Wimbledon in 1949, Brough won by the oddball scoreline of 10-8, 1-6, 10-8. Margaret had four set points in the first set, and she was two points away from closing out the match on her own serve at 6-5 in the third. This is in the era before sit-down changeovers, and unlike Forest Hills, Wimbledon didn\u2019t give players a ten-minute intermission after the second set. The two women were on their feet, without pause, for 43 games.\n\nThe 1949 Wimbledon final also stood out in memory for another reason. Cynthia Starr and Billie Jean King interviewed the two women for their 1988 book, We Have Come a Long Way. Osborne duPont\u2019s reputation was that she never choked. She said, as humbly as she could manage, that she couldn\u2019t remember ever choking. The two women rarely disagreed, but Brough \u201cgently disputed\u201d the point\u2013surely thinking back to that marathon title match.\n\nOsborne duPont (and Brough, of course) in the 1950 Wimbledon final\n\nMargaret certainly didn\u2019t choke very much. Her last major title came when she was 44, in mixed doubles at Wimbledon in 1962. She and Neale Fraser finally secured the trophy after 41 games, beating Ann Haydon and Dennis Ralston, 2-6, 6-3, 13-11. In another classic mixed doubles match, Ozzie and Bill Talbert beat Gussie Moran and Bob Falkenburg, 27-25, 5-7 6-1. In Margaret\u2019s memory, \u201cThe wind was so strong \u2026 that you couldn\u2019t possibly win a game on one side of the court.\u201d The match was postponed at 22-22 in the first set, and sanity prevailed in the less extreme conditions of the following day.\n\nOsborne duPont was at Wimbledon in 1962 as the coach of the US Wightman Cup team. Mixed doubles at the Championships was just a bonus. It had been three decades since Hazel Wightman herself\u2013the original force behind the annual international meeting\u2013had doubted Margaret\u2019s potential. Since then, Osborne duPont had won 37 grand slam titles. She went undefeated in 19 Wightman Cup matches. She ranked among the US year-end top ten 14 times, three of them after she became a mother.\n\nShe didn\u2019t think there were any particular secrets to her success. In 1962, she told a reporter, \u201cI just enjoy tennis very much and play the game a lot. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d Sure, yes, that, plus a serve with so much spin that spectators could hear a swish as the racket made contact. Wightman was wrong, but no matter. \u201cIn a way it was a compliment. I considered her one of my very best friends in tennis.\u201d"}]}
