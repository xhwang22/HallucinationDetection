{"Charles Lee was a member of the 2001\u201302 Raptors team that made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Toronto-Raptors", "page_content": "Toronto Raptors, Canadian professional basketball team based in Toronto that plays in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Raptors have won one conference title and one NBA championship (both 2019).\n\nThe Raptors joined the NBA in 1995 as an expansion team alongside the Western Conference\u2019s Vancouver Grizzlies. The two expansion teams were the first NBA franchises based in Canada. (An earlier team, the Toronto Huskies, played in the Basketball Association of America\u2014one of the forerunners of the NBA\u2014during the 1946\u201347 season.) The Raptors finished in last place in their division in each of their first three seasons in the league. Toronto acquired its first superstar, guard-forward Vince Carter, in a 1998 draft-day trade. A five-time All-Star for Toronto, Carter helped the franchise reach its first playoff berth, during the 1999\u20132000 season. In 2000\u201301 the Raptors again qualified for the postseason and advanced to the conference semifinals, a dramatic seven-game loss to the eventual conference champion, the Philadelphia 76ers. After a winning campaign that ended in a first-round postseason elimination in 2001\u201302, Toronto entered into a four-year stretch of losing seasons, which was marked by the trade of the disgruntled Carter in 2004.\n\nBritannica Quiz Great Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nThe Raptors returned to the postseason in 2006\u201307, with a team featuring standout centre-forward Chris Bosh, but were knocked out in the opening round of the playoffs in both that season and the following, and the franchise subsequently failed to post winning records. In 2010 Bosh left the team in free agency, prolonging the rebuilding process.\n\nThe 2013\u201314 season saw the team stage a stunning turnaround as it rebounded from a last-place divisional finish the previous season to win the second division title in team history. The Raptors won another division crown in 2014\u201315, but the team was swept out of the postseason in its opening-round series. In 2015\u201316 Toronto, led by All-Star guards Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, won 56 games and advanced to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in team history, where the Raptors were eliminated by the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Raptors earned a franchise-record fourth straight playoff appearance in 2016\u201317 but were swept by the Cavaliers in the teams\u2019 second-round postseason series. In 2017\u201318 the Raptors set a team record with 59 victories and had the best record in the Eastern Conference for the first time in franchise history. Despite Toronto\u2019s stellar regular-season performance, the team once again faltered against the Cavaliers in the playoffs, losing all four games of the teams\u2019 second-round series.\n\nSearching for a way to finally break through in the following off-season, the Raptors traded franchise icon DeRozan to the San Antonio Spurs in a deal that brought versatile wing Kawhi Leonard in return. The trade was considered risky since Leonard had only one year remaining on his contract and had feuded with the Spurs for the better part of the previous year. However, Leonard was an ideal addition to the Raptors both on and off the court, as he teamed with Lowry seamlessly and led Toronto to the first conference championship in franchise history in 2018\u201319. Toronto then stunned the heavily favoured two-time defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors in the finals, winning a hard-fought six-game series to capture the Raptors\u2019 first championship."}, {"url": "https://www.jax.org/people/charles-lee", "page_content": "A new research affiliation agreement between Shriners Hospitals for Children (SHC) and JAX will endeavor to gain a greater understanding of the genetic factors involved in cerebral palsy.\n\nJAX's Charles Lee has been named chairholder of The Robert Alvine Family Endowed Chair, established with a $1.5 million gift (matched by JAX) from Robert Alvine, chair emeritus of the JAX Board of Trustees.\n\nPeter Robinson of the Jackson Laboratory was sworn in to the National Human Genome Research Institute\u2019s (NHGRI) Advisory Council on Aug 19, 2022.\n\nPress Release May 03, 2022 JAX announces 2022 recipients of the JAX Scholar awards The Jackson Laboratory is proud to announce the 2022 recipients of the JAX Postdoctoral Scholar award.

At certain points he is believed to have sought to supplant George Washington and take command of the Continental Army. Lee and Washington came into direct confrontation during the Battle of Monmouth on June 28, 1778. Lee's conduct during the battle and the subsequent exchange with Washington eventually led to his permanent dismissal from the Continental Army.\n\nCharles Lee was born in Cheshire, England the son of British Army General John Lee and Isabella Buxbury. Educated in Switzerland, Lee became fluent in several languages. He joined the British army in 1744. After serving in a number of European armies, including those of Russia, Poland, and Portugal, he took up permanent residence in America and joined the Continental Army in 1775. Lee was commissioned second major general in the force, following only George Washington in seniority.\n\nLee was widely respected in the colonies for his military reputation, and his military advice and direction were sought after in a number of locations in the first years of the conflict. He served on the siege lines outside of Boston and aided in the development of the defenses of Newport, Rhode Island. Afterwards he began the defenses of New York, and was reassigned to the southern department where his most significant contribution came in the defense of Charleston, S.C. against a British assault in 1776.\n\nThese actions led to Lee achieving a fairly high reputation. Lee was captured by the British in 1776 following the fall of New York City. Exchanged in a prisoner swap in 1778, Lee returned to the Continental Army and was a staunch critic of the reforms of the Baron von Steuben. There is some speculation that Lee abandoned the American cause while a prisoner in New York, as he wrote several notes to William Howe on the best manner to defeat the Americans. This was unknown to the American camp at the time of his return and Lee was reinstated at his previous rank.\n\nLee returned to the field and led the advanced guard at the Battle of Monmouth on June 28, 1778. Lee's attack was disorganized and the ensuing confusion resulted in the retreat of the American advance guard. When confronted by Washington on his reason for the withdrawal, the two men exchanged words. Lee was brought up on charges of insubordination and removed from command in the army for one year. In the aftermath, he became embroiled in several affairs of honor and often criticized the Continental Congress for enforcing the sentence on him. These actions led to his permanent dismissal from the Continental Army in January of 1780. He died in Philadelphia in 1782.\n\nJames McIntyre\n\nAssistant Professor of History\n\nMoraine Valley Community College\n\nBibliography:\n\nAlden, John R. General Charles Lee: Traitor or Patriot?.

Mohawk warriors, with whom he lived during the French and Indian War, called him Ounewaterika, or \u201cBoiling Water\u201d\u2014a name that only partially suggested his disposition. And during the first year of the Revolution certain members of the Continental Congress regarded him as the greatest general in the world\u2014the officer who should have led the American army had he not been an Englishman. A man around whom controversy swarmed like angry hornets, Charles Lee was a Jekyll-Hyde personality, a stormy character eaten with pride and ambition, brilliant, courtly, scholarly and at the same time uncouth, slovenly, and contentious.\n\nThe family into which he was born in Chester, England, a few months before George Washington\u2019s birthday in 1732, had been gentry since the thirteenth century, and Charles, the seventh child\u2014tall, bony, thin and ugly as a scarecrow \u2014was educated in a manner befitting a son of the Enlightenment. Commissioned in his father\u2019s regiment at the age of fifteen, he came to America in 1755 to fight the French and Indians, where he acquired a reputation for a violent temper and brutally frank opinions. Back in Europe, he was active in literary, theatrical, and political circles, condemned the government loudly, fought in Portugal, became an aide to King Stanislas of Poland (who made him a major general), and was increasingly on the outs with the ministry of George in, whom he called a \u201cdespicable and tho stupid at the same time not innoxious dolt.\u201d Finally, he had enough of the Old World and sailed to America in 1773, where he rapidly met most of the men who were to assume importance in the Revolution and became, by the time hostilities broke out, a leading contender for commander of the Continental Army. But Congress had to have a native-born American, and to Lee\u2019s chagrin, George Washington of Virginia received the appointment. Lee was named a major general, and it required no imagination to see that he was a perfect original. An acquaintance, Jeremy Belknap, described him as \u201can odd genius; full of fire and passion, and but little good manners; a great sloven, wretchedly profane, and a great admirer of dogs, \u2014of which he had two at dinner with him, one of them a native of Pomerania, which I should have taken for a bear had I seen him in the woods.\u201d By the fall of 1776 Lee had won acclaim for the defense of Charleston, he was on close or intimate terms with the important members of Congress, and he was the army\u2019s favorite officer. This\u2014coupled with the fact that Washington had presided over an unbroken series of disasters beginning with the loss of Long Island\u2014gave rise to rumors that Charles Lee would supersede the Virginian in command of the army. Lee\u2019s insatiable ambition and colossal vanity made it certain that he would seek the opportunity to do so, and when Washington divided his army after the Battle of White Plains and left Lee in Westchester while he retreated through New Jersey, Lee took his own good time about rejoining his commander. Meantime, he was carrying on a highly dubious correspondence with other officers, including Joseph Reed of Washington\u2019s staff, to whom he complained of the Commander in Chiefs \u201cfatal indecision of mind.\u201d He wrote to various officials in New England, requesting recruits and supplies for his own army (he could expect little help from Washington, he told them) and observing that it was up to the military to save cause and country from the British and a bungling Congress. \u201cThere are times,\u201d he stated, \u201cwhen we must commit treason against the Laws of the State for the salvation of the State.\u201d\n\nMoving slowly across New Jersey to join Washington, despite repeated requests that he do so as quickly as possible, Lee made the great mistake of spending the night of December 12, 1776, about three miles from his army\u2019s camp at a tavern in Basking Ridge, and was captured the next morning by a party of British dragoons. (The young cavalryman who took Lee was to gain notoriety on the battlegrounds of America as \u201cBloody\u201d Tarleton; after escorting his \u201cNoble Prisoner\u201d to Brunswick, Tarleton, whose actual first name was Banastre, declared proudly that this \u201cmost miraculous Event\u201d had \u201cput an End to the Campaign.\u201d) Lee was imprisoned for nearly two years, never knowing if he would be tried as a deserter from the British army, and to save his neck, submitted a plan to the enemy for ending the rebellion\u2014a scheme that Americans did not learn about until seventy years after his death. He was finally exchanged, but at the Battle of Monmouth he inexplicably ordered a retreat and was later court-martialed and suspended for twelve months. His brilliant, merciless pen was his undoing: during the trial he cast aspersions on Washington and other officers that could not be forgiven, and when his year\u2019s penance was up, wrote such an offensive letter to Congress that that body cashiered him from the service. In 1782, heavily in debt and still fulminating against Washington, whom he called a \u201cpuffed up charlatan \u2026 extremely prodigal of other men\u2019s blood and a great oeconomist of his own,\u201d he died in Philadelphia.\n\nLee\u2019s capture effectively ended his career, and there is no saying what might have happened had that event not occurred. He had been chafing for months about his subordinate role, he had the bit in his teeth and was lining up allies for what appeared to be a final power struggle with Washington, and on the strength of their respective achievements to that moment, it is quite possible that the Virginian might have lost out. Had Lee instead of Washington received credit for the victories that came later, at a time when many Americans were seriously questioning Washington\u2019s military capabilities, it is not easy to say what the consequences might have been then, or after the war\u2019s end. For Lee was scornful of Washington\u2019s considered habit of deferring to Congress, he had no use whatever for the principle of military subservience to a civilian government, and in hindsight it maybe asked whether the removal of this power-hungry egocentric from the center stage may not have been the luckiest possible break for the country.\n\n\u2014 Richard M. Ketchum"}, {"url": "https://www.battlefields.org/learn/biographies/charles-lee", "page_content": "At the outbreak of the American Revolution, Charles Lee resigned his post in the British Royal Army to join the colonists in their patriotic cause. To Lee\u2019s chagrin, George Washington surpassed the British born officer as Congress\u2019s choice for Commander of the Continental Army. Although Lee was widely recognized for his adroit military capabilities, after only a few years into the war, his reputation would be tarnished entirely.\n\nCharles Lee was born on January 26, 1731 in Cheshire, England. As a boy, he was enrolled in military school and later served in the French and Indian War as a Lieutenant. While in America, Lee married a Mohawk woman and was subsequently adopted into the Mohawk tribe. Due to Lee\u2019s erratic temperament, the Native Americans referred to him as \u201cBoiling Water.\u201d\n\nIn 1773, Lee returned to the colonies to establish a more permanent residence in Virginia. When hostilities between Britain and the American colonies erupted in 1775, all hope for reconciliation was extinguished and the two sides plunged into war. As second in command of the Continental Army, Lee was appointed head of the Southern Department. His resentment for Washington as Commander-in-Chief, however, would continue to surface throughout the war.\n\nThe Major General garnered substantial praise and admiration for his defense of Charleston in 1776. Though the victory was largely accomplished by the judgement of others, Lee was credited with the win and dubbed a hero. In the following months, Lee joined Washington in New York where the \u201chero of Charleston\u201d began badmouthing his superior in written correspondences. Longing for Washington\u2019s job and exploiting the colonists\u2019 recent defeats in New York, Lee penned a Congressman, \u201cHad I the powers, I could do you much good.\u201d The Major\u2019s efforts to undermine General Washington were disrupted when in December of 1776 he was captured by the British. As second in command, Lee was a notable prize for the enemy and his release would only come in 1778 after a British loss at Saratoga.\n\nIn May of 1778, Lee had returned to the Continental Army in time for the Battle of Monmouth. The decisive battle took place on June 28 as the Patriots pursued the British into New Jersey. Lee was ordered to lead the troops into battle and what followed proved disastrous for the general. As the British began to flank Lee\u2019s men, the commander prematurely issued a retreat. Witnessing this, Washington confronted Lee on the battlefield and the two commanders exchanged heated words. Charged with disobeying orders and insubordination, Lee was relieved of his command and court-martialed. Congress decided to remove Lee for one year during which the ex-general proceeded to speak out against Washington.\n\nIndeed, Lee\u2019s sharp tongue created new enemies determined to defend Washington\u2019s honor. In 1778, John Laurens challenged Lee to a duel and shot him in the side, wounding but not killing the officer. In 1780, Lee formally resigned from the Continental Army and retired to Philadelphia. It was there that Lee died in 1782."}, {"url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/major-general-charles-lee-2360612", "page_content": "Major General Charles Lee (February 6, 1732\u2013October 2, 1782) was a controversial commander who served during the American Revolution (1775\u20131783). A British Army veteran, he offered his services to the Continental Congress and was given a commission. Lee's prickly demeanor and substantial ego brought him into frequent conflict with General George Washington. He was relieved of his command during the Battle of Monmouth Court House and was later dismissed from the Continental Army by Congress.\n\nEarly Life\n\nBorn February 6, 1732, in Cheshire, England, Lee was the son of Major General John Lee and his wife Isabella Bunbury. Sent to school in Switzerland at an early age, he was taught a variety of languages and received a basic military education. Returning to Britain at age 14, Lee attended the King Edward VI School in Bury St. Edmonds before his father purchased him an ensign's commission in the British Army.\n\nServing in his father's regiment, the 55th Foot (later 44th Foot), Lee spent time in Ireland before purchasing a lieutenant's commission in 1751. With the beginning of the French and Indian War, the regiment was ordered to North America. Arriving in 1755, Lee took part Major General Edward Braddock's disastrous campaign which ended at the Battle of the Monongahela on July 9.\n\nFrench and Indian War\n\nOrdered to the Mohawk Valley in New York, Lee became friendly with the local Mohawks and was adopted by the tribe. Given the name Ounewaterika or \"Boiling Water,\" he was permitted to marry the daughter of one of the chiefs. In 1756, Lee purchased a promotion to captain and a year later took part in the failed expedition against the French fortress of Louisbourg.\n\nReturning to New York, Lee's regiment became part of Major General James Abercrombie's advance against Fort Carillon in 1758. That July, he was badly wounded during the bloody repulse at the Battle of Carillon. Recovering, Lee took part in Brigadier General John Prideaux's successful 1759 campaign to capture Fort Niagara before joining the British advance on Montreal the following year.\n\nInterwar Years\n\nWith the conquest of Canada complete, Lee was transferred to the 103rd Foot and promoted to major. In this role, he served in Portugal and played a key part in Colonel John Burgoyne's triumph at the Battle of Vila Velha on October 5, 1762. The fighting saw Lee's men recapture the town and win a lopsided victory that inflicted around 250 killed and captured on the Spanish while only sustaining only 11 casualties.\n\nWith the end of the war in 1763, Lee's regiment was disbanded and he was placed on half-pay. Seeking employment, he traveled to Poland two years later and became an aide-de-camp to King Stanislaus (II) Poniatowski. Made a major general in the Polish service, he later returned to Britain in 1767. Still unable to obtain a position in the British Army, Lee resumed his post in Poland in 1769 and took part in the Russo-Turkish War (1778\u20131764). While abroad, he lost two fingers in a duel.\n\nTo America\n\nInvalided back to Britain in 1770, Lee continued to petition for a post in the British service. Though promoted to lieutenant colonel, no permanent position was available. Frustrated, Lee decided to return to North America and settled in western Virginia in 1773. There he purchased a large estate near lands owned by his friend Horatio Gates.\n\nQuickly impressing key individuals in the colony, such as Richard Henry Lee, he became sympathetic to the Patriot cause. As hostilities with Britain looked increasingly likely, Lee advised that an army should be formed. With the Battles of Lexington and Concord and subsequent beginning of the American Revolution in April 1775, Lee immediately offered his services to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia.\n\nJoining the American Revolution\n\nBased on his prior military exploits, Lee fully expected to be made the commander-in-chief of the new Continental Army. Though Congress was pleased to have an officer with Lee's experience join the cause, it was put off by his slovenly appearance, desire to be paid, and frequent use of obscene language. The post instead was given to another Virginian, General George Washington. Lee was commissioned as the Army's second-most senior major general behind Artemis Ward. Despite being listed third in the Army's hierarchy, Lee was effectively second, as the aging Ward had little ambition beyond overseeing the ongoing Siege of Boston.\n\nCharleston\n\nImmediately resentful of Washington, Lee traveled north to Boston with his commander in July 1775. Taking part in the siege, his gruff personal behavior was tolerated by other officers due to his prior military accomplishments. With the arrival of the new year, Lee was ordered to Connecticut to raise forces for the defense of New York City. Shortly thereafter, Congress appointed him to command the Northern, and later Canadian, Department. Though selected for these posts, Lee never served in them because on March 1, Congress directed him to take over the Southern Department at Charleston, South Carolina. Reaching the city on June 2, Lee was quickly faced with the arrival of a British invasion force led by Major General Henry Clinton and Commodore Peter Parker.\n\nAs the British prepared to land, Lee worked to fortify the city and support Colonel William Moultrie's garrison at Fort Sullivan. Doubtful that Moultrie could hold, Lee recommended that he fall back to the city. This was refused and the fort's garrison turned back the British at the Battle of Sullivan's Island on June 28. In September, Lee received orders to rejoin Washington's army at New York. As a nod to Lee's return, Washington changed the name of Fort Constitution, on the bluffs overlooking the Hudson River, to Fort Lee. Reaching New York, Lee arrived in time for the Battle of White Plains.\n\nIssues with Washington\n\nIn the wake of the American defeat, Washington entrusted Lee with a large portion of the Army and tasked him with first holding Castle Hill and then Peekskill. With the collapse of the American position around New York after the losses of Fort Washington and Fort Lee, Washington began retreating across New Jersey. As the retreat began, he ordered Lee to join him with his troops. As the autumn had progressed, Lee's relationship with his superior had continued to degrade and he began sending intensely critical letters regarding Washington's performance to Congress. Though one of these was accidentally read by Washington, the American commander, more disappointed than angered, did not take action.\n\nCapture\n\nMoving at a slow pace, Lee brought his men south into New Jersey. On December 12, his column encamped south of Morristown. Rather than remain with his men, Lee and his staff took quarters at White's Tavern several miles from the American camp. The next morning, Lee's guard was surprised by a British patrol led by Lieutenant Colonel William Harcourt and including Banastre Tarleton. After a brief exchange, Lee and his men were captured.\n\nThough Washington attempted to exchange several Hessian officers taken at Trenton for Lee, the British refused. Held as a deserter due to his previous British service, Lee wrote and submitted a plan for defeating the Americans to General Sir William Howe. An act of treason, the plan was not made public until 1857. With the American victory at Saratoga, Lee's treatment improved and he was finally exchanged for Major General Richard Prescott on May 8, 1778.\n\nBattle of Monmouth\n\nStill popular with Congress and parts of the Army, Lee rejoined Washington at Valley Forge on May 20, 1778. The following month, British forces under Clinton began evacuating Philadelphia and moving north to New York. Assessing the situation, Washington desired to pursue and attack the British. Lee strenuously objected to this plan as he felt the new alliance with France precluded the need to fight unless victory was certain. Overruling Lee, Washington and the army crossed to New Jersey and closed with the British. On June 28, Washington ordered Lee to take a force of 5,000 men forward to attack the enemy's rearguard.\n\nAt around 8 a.m., Lee's column met the British rearguard under Lieutenant General Lord Charles Cornwallis just north of Monmouth Court House. Rather than commence a coordinated attack, Lee committed his troops piecemeal and rapidly lost control of the situation. After a few hours of fighting, the British moved to flank Lee's line. Seeing this, Lee ordered a general retreat after offering little resistance. Falling back, he and his men encountered Washington, who was advancing with the rest of the Army.\n\nAppalled by the situation, Washington sought out Lee and demanded to know what had happened. After receiving no satisfactory answer, he rebuked Lee in one of the few instances where he swore publicly. Replying with inappropriate language, Lee was immediately relieved of his command. Riding forward, Washington was able to rescue American fortunes during the remainder of the Battle of Monmouth Court House.\n\nLater Career and Life\n\nMoving to the rear, Lee promptly wrote two highly insubordinate letters to Washington and demanded a court-martial to clear his name. Obliging, Washington had a court-martial convened at New Brunswick, New Jersey on July 1. Proceeding under the guidance of Major General Lord Stirling, the hearings concluded on August 9. Three days later, the board returned and found Lee guilty of disobeying orders in the face of the enemy, misbehavior, and disrespecting the commander-in-chief. In the wake of the verdict, Washington forwarded it to Congress for action.\n\nOn December 5, Congress voted to sanction Lee by relieving him from command for one year. Forced from the field, Lee began working to overturn the verdict and openly attacked Washington. These actions cost him what little popularity he had remaining. In response to his assault on Washington, Lee was challenged to several duels. In December 1778, Colonel John Laurens, one of Washington's aides, wounded him in the side during a duel. This injury prevented Lee from following through on a challenge from Major General Anthony Wayne.\n\nReturning to Virginia in 1779, he learned that Congress intended to dismiss him from the service. In response, he wrote a scathing letter that resulted in his formal dismissal from the Continental Army on January 10, 1780.\n\nDeath\n\nLee moved to Philadelphia in the same month as his dismissal, January 1780. He resided in the city until taking ill and dying on October 2, 1782. Though unpopular, his funeral was attended by much of Congress and several foreign dignitaries. Lee was buried at Christ Episcopal Church and Churchyard in Philadelphia."}, {"url": "https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/major-general-charles-lee-and-battle-monmouth", "page_content": "History has not been kind to Charles Lee, the man whom George Washington referred to as \u201cThe first officer in Military knowledge and experience we have in the whole army\u2026.\u201d He was a conundrum of a man\u2014brilliant, but eccentric and erratic. His military career was filled with a plethora of peaks and valleys, and in the end, his own worst enemy was his ego.\n\nLee\u2019s role during the Battle of Monmouth Court House in present-day Manalapan and Freehold, New Jersey, has been shrouded in controversy and myth. The popular idea of Lee being cussed out by Washington and relieved of command on the field in front of his peers has been misconstrued for several centuries, mainly because the repeated accounts of what happened that day have been from the memories of men who did not even witness the events they described. Lee\u2019s performance at Monmouth was cautious, sloppy, courageous, and commendable, all at the same time. In the wake of the battle, only his personal honor had been injured\u2014his reputation was already suspect to many of the officers in Washington\u2019s circle\u2014and because of this, Lee felt the need to have his name cleared of any supposed wrong-doings. He did not know when to back down and remain quiet. A court-martial would follow, and Lee\u2019s career in the Revolutionary War came to an inglorious end. Over two-hundred and forty years removed from the events of June 28, 1778, Lee\u2019s performance must continuously be reassessed, or it will be forever tainted by bias and myth.\n\nAn engraving of Charles Lee's capture at Basking Ridge by British dragoons in December 1776. New York Public Library\n\nAfter being held in captivity for nearly sixteen months, Lee returned to the Continental Army in May 1778, when he reassumed the rank of second in command. As Washington prepared to pursue Sir Henry Clinton\u2019s British force across New Jersey, which was in retreat from Philadelphia toward the safety of New York City, Lee was not confident in the Americans. His absence from the army had made him ignorant of the transformation that the Continental soldier had undergone since December 1776 when he was captured by British dragoons in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. He still did not think that they were capable of standing toe-to-toe with British regulars on the field of battle. He could not have been more wrong. Combat experience and professional training at the hands of Baron von Steuben at Valley Forge had turned the Continental Army into a force to be reckoned with. Regardless, Lee assumed command of the army\u2019s right-wing and led the advance into New Jersey on June 20, 1778.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Lee lobbied for Washington to avoid an open engagement with Clinton. Instead, he argued that the British should be allowed to return to New York City and that the Americans should bide their time and wait for France to become more militarily involved\u2014he understood, correctly, that France\u2019s entrance into the conflict would ultimately decide its outcome. Washington, and some of his most trusted subordinates like Lafayette, Green, and Wayne, did not intend to let Clinton\u2019s army escape New Jersey without a fight. By June 27, Lee and 4,500 men of his advanced corps, or vanguard, were encamped around Englishtown, some six miles away from the British at Monmouth Court House. Washington, who was leading the main body of the army several miles behind at Manalapan Bridge, rode ahead to meet with Lee that evening. No direct order to engage the enemy was apparently delivered by the commander in chief. Lee was to advance toward Monmouth Court House the following morning with his vanguard, keeping within striking distance of the enemy should they attempt to resume their march. Brigadier Generals Charles Scott and Anthony Wayne, who was serving under Lee, believed that Washington did intend them to attack, but Lee did not.\n\nThe next morning, June 28, his force advanced. The movement was cautious and slow because Lee did not have enough intelligence regarding the enemy\u2019s position and the lay of the land. Eventually, though, contact was made between the two forces and the Americans formed up a line of battle just west of the village. The battle that Washington had been yearning for was at hand, and it was Lee\u2019s job, in his mind at least, to keep the rearguard of Clinton\u2019s army pinned down long enough for him to arrive with the main body and deliver the crushing blow. Things collapsed very quickly for Lee\u2019s force. Clinton turned around General Charles Cornwallis\u2019s division and moved it in the Americans\u2019 direction. Without any orders from Lee, Gen. Scott, near the left-center of the line, began pulling his men back. This movement initiated a general retreat, and with the British now in pursuit, Lee\u2019s vanguard was fleeing west. A potential disaster was in the works. Lee attempted to gain control of the confused situation, not quite sure himself of what had transpired. Luckily, for the Americans, the commander in chief was on the field.\n\nAn engraving of Maj. Gen. Charles Lee, 1778. Library of Congress\n\nGeorge Washington had arrived in Englishtown roughly an hour and a half ahead of the Continental Army\u2019s main body and sat down for breakfast sometime around ten in the morning, June 28, 1778. Six miles away, Major General Charles Lee\u2019s vanguard of roughly 5000 men was just about to throw itself at the British rearguard north of Monmouth Court House.\n\nWashington had ridden ahead of the main body toward the sounds of musket fire in the distance. Arriving in the fields west of the village, he expected to find Lee engaged with the enemy and pinning him in place. The situation was much different and he was greeted by retreating men along the road from Englishtown, quickly learning that Lee\u2019s force was falling back in the face of the enemy. Washington continued on toward Perrine Ridge, a gently sloping rise north of the road and several miles west of the village. There, he attempted to rally some of the troops nearby and form them up in a defensive line. He then rode forward to find Gen. Lee. \u201cHere, fortunately for the honour of the army, and the welfare of America,\u201d Washington\u2019s aide John Laurens remembered, \u201cGeneral Washington met the troops retreating in disorder, and without any plan to make an opposition.\u201d\n\nLee was situated further east and south of the road on a hill near the Rhea farm when Washington found him. The exchange that occurred between the two commanders has fallen victim to myth over the centuries. Many widely accepted versions of the encounter have come from individuals who either recollected it decades later or were not even present at the time. Charles Lee, who obviously was there, remembered it as follows:\n\nWhen I arrived first in his [Washington\u2019s] presence, conscious of having done nothing that could draw on the least censure, but rather flattering myself with his congratulation and applause, I confess I was disconcerted, astonished and confounded by the words and manner in which his Excellency accosted me\u2026. The terms, I think, were these\u2014\u201cI desire to know, sir, what is the reason\u2014whence arises this disorder and confusion?\u201d The manner in which he expressed them was much stronger and more severe than the expressions themselves. When I recovered myself sufficiently, I answered, that I saw or knew of no confusion but what naturally arose from disobedience of orders, contradictory intelligence, and the impertinence and presumption of individuals, who were vested with no authority, intruding themselves in matters above them and out of their sphere. That the retreat \u2026 was contrary to my intentions, contrary to my orders, and contrary to my wishes\u2026. To which he replied, \u201cAll may be very true, sir, but you ought not to have undertaken it unless you intended to go through with it.\u201d\n\nAfter this exchange, according to Lee\u2019s aide Captain John Mercer, who was in fact present, Washington simply \u201cpassed him by\u201d and continued on.\n\nPostwar accounts of the meeting between the two men would have Washington calling Lee a \u201cdamned poltroon,\u201d and swearing \u201cuntil the leaves shook on trees.\u201d Lafayette and Charles Scott, respectively, passed these versions on. Neither of them was there when it happened, so their accounts must be viewed as pure exaggerations. Neither was a fan of Lee.\n\nThere is also an accepted version of the exchange in which Lee was subsequently relieved of command and sent to the rear of the army. This is simply another myth. Lee remained on the field and helped organize and conducted a delaying action to buy time for Washington to bring the main body of the army onto the field and form along Perrine Ridge. The American chieftain personally placed men under Wayne into a protruding section of woods known as the \u201cPoint of Woods\u201d and the returned command to Lee, who in turned prepared a defensive line further west along a fence line dubbed the \u201cHedgerow.\u201d As Washington galloped back to Perrine Ridge, Lee was left in command of all troops on that part of the battlefield. Before departing, Lee promised his commander that, \u201cI myself should be one of the last to leave the field\u2026.\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s rearguard south of the Englishtown Road near the Point of Woods and along the Hedgerow, was short, but vicious and valiant, and it bought Washington the time he needed to form up his line of defense in their rear. It was some of the bloodiest fighting to occur that day, and as Lee pulled his men back in the direction of Perrine Ridge, he was the last one to personally retire in front of the enemy. He had kept his promise and helped turn the tide of the battle. The British would not attempt to storm the American position on Perrine Ridge.\n\nA mid-19th century painting of the Battle of Monmouth, featuring George Washington rallying his men. Wikimedia Commons\n\nWhen Lee returned to the main American line he was ordered by Washington to reform his shattered command around Englishtown. He had not been relieved of duty on the spot, but as time passed that hot afternoon, Washington ordered Baron von Steuben to ride west and assume command of Lee\u2019s troops. Effectively, Charles Lee would never lead troops on a battlefield again. The event that transpired next is widely remembered by students of history. At his own request, Lee was court-martialed in early July under the charges of disobedience of orders, misbehavior before the enemy, and disrespecting Washington in several letters written following the battle. In August, he was found guilty on all three charges and ordered to return home for the next year.\n\nHad Lee simply kept silent following the battle, his status within the army probably would not have been put into question. Because he had verbally attacked and disrespected Washington by asking for an apology after the fact, Lee drew attention to himself and went to war with the commander in chief. It did not become a matter of clearing his own name or satisfying his ego. In the army\u2019s and public\u2019s eyes, it became Lee vs. Washington. That was a fight that the former could never win. It could not just be swept under the table anymore. Someone had to lose, and that, of course, was Charles Lee.\n\nHistory loves its villains, and Charles Lee makes a good one if he is to be studied only at the surface. Dig deeper and a complicated, but very brilliant and capable man can be discovered. His service at Monmouth, the defining event in his life, is not one of cowardice and insubordination that has been remembered. His subordinate officers failed him when the battle was initiated, and despite this, he was able to help turn a potential disaster into an American victory with his stand at the Point of Woods and Hedgerow. His legacy has been tainted by myth and history, but in the days following the battle of Monmouth, this was all initiated at his own doing. However, as with many individuals in history, actions speak louder than words. On the battlefields of the Revolutionary War, Lee\u2019s actions would have spoken enough for him if he allowed them to.\n\nFurther Reading:"}, {"url": "https://www.epa.gov/perspectives/aanhpi-heritage-month-coming-full-circle-environmental-justice", "page_content": "AANHPI Heritage Month: Coming Full Circle on Environmental Justice\n\nMay 26, 2022\n\nFor Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, I have been asked to reflect on how I, a Chinese American born in Taiwan and raised in New York City, came to make Environmental Justice the central focus of my life\u2019s work. This is a reasonable question. When I started to work on the intersecting issues of race, poverty, and the environment, the issue did not even have a name.\n\nComing of age during the tumultuous 1960s and 1970s, I was influenced greatly by the African American struggle for civil rights and racial justice. Like many Asian Americans, I struggled to understand my racial/ethnic identity in the United States. The universal truths embodied in the writings of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and others profoundly shaped my aspirations, thinking, and values.\n\nCharles Lee, announcing the release of the 1987 Toxic Wastes and Race report at the National Press Club\n\nI started writing about the link between race, poverty, and environment in the late 1970s. In 1982 I saw the connection play out in real life, and it was life changing. I traveled to Warren County, North Carolina to show solidarity with predominantly Black residents protesting the siting of a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) hazardous waste landfill. More than 500 people were arrested as protesters lay in front of trucks carrying PCB-laden waste oil. Throughout the protests, I sensed the potential for transformative societal change.\n\nBecause of Warren County, I went to work for the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice and did groundbreaking work that gave environmental justice a name and helped propel it onto the national stage. By writing the landmark 1987 Toxic Wastes and Race report (pdf), I brought the weight of empirical evidence to support the idea of environmental racism. By organizing the historic 1991 First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit, I helped to coalesce a national environmental justice movement.\n\nThis summit strongly demonstrated that communities of color were already providing powerful leadership on environmental issues, including three transcendent Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander voices:\n\nSenator Jeton Anjain organized the evacuation of his Marshall Islands homeland, Rongelap, contaminated by the United States\u2019 1954 hydrogen bomb tests.\n\nMililani Trask worked for Native Hawaiian sovereignty and the return of the state-managed lands legally entitled to Native Hawaiians.\n\nYoung Hi Shin co-founded Asian Immigrant Women Advocates to fight for workers\u2019 rights in the San Francisco Bay Area\u2019s garment, hotel, home care, and other low-wage industries.\n\nThese actions created a framework to empower and lift-up the voices of all overburdened communities to sustain their pursuit of environmental justice. As a result, EPA\u2019s Office of Environmental Justice was created in 1992, working to address the disproportionately adverse human health and environmental impacts in overburdened communities. Echoing these concerns, in 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, recognizing the need for federal focus on environmental justice.\n\nFormer Administrator Gina McCarthy presents the EJ Pioneer Award to Charles Lee on the 20th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 12898.\n\nAANHPI advocates realized the need to better organize around environmental justice, which resulted in the creation of the Asian Pacific Environmental Network (APEN). To sum up the APEN\u2019s first two decades, former APEN director Roger Kim and Occidental College professor Martha Matsuoka wrote that APEN \u201cillustrates how [AANHPI] communities can help lead the environmental movement in the future. Building on the existing work of community-based organizing and tapping the demographic transition underway is central to any comprehensive strategy to combat climate change, accelerate the development of an equitable clean energy economy, and ensure a livable planet for generations to come.\u201d\n\nSince coming to EPA, I have worked to integrate environmental justice into our Agency\u2019s policies, programs, and activities. Efforts by the Biden-Harris Administration to advance equity are unprecedented. Under Administrator Michael Regan\u2019s leadership, EPA made environmental justice and equity core principles of how we carry out our mission.\n\nMaking environmental justice a central part of it\u2019s the agency\u2019s new Strategic Plan;\n\nIncreasing investments in overburdened communities\n\nStrengthening civil rights enforcement to hold polluters accountable\n\nImplementing an Agency Equity Action Plan that addresses cumulative impacts\n\nToday, we are living through a historic moment for environmental justice. We have come full circle \u2013 from a time when environmental justice did not have a name to today when it is at the center of the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s agenda. Having dedicated much time speaking to and mentoring AANHPI students and youth, today represents a historic opportunity for a whole new generation of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders to step forward and provide leadership to advance environmental justice for all communities.\n\nAbout the Author Charles Lee\n\nSenior Policy Advisor to the Office of Environmental Justice\n\nOffice of the Administrator Charles Lee is a founder of the EJ movement in the United States.
