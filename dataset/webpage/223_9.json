Players approaching or beyond 40 years of age were able to stick around when a full-strength, peacetime major league roster wouldn\u2019t have given them the time of day. Others came back out of retirement, hoping they might have some competitive fight left against a handicapped supply of baseball talent. Former Pittsburgh star Lloyd Waner returned and joined his 41-year-old brother Paul at Brooklyn, while 1931 World Series hero Pepper Martin came back to the Cardinals four years after having last played in the majors, batting a respectable .279 in 40 games for the NL champs.\n\nIn between the teenagers and the elderly, many of those with a more common playing age were sticking around the majors because of various physical imperfections\u2014flat feet, allergies, previous injuries\u2014that made them ineligible for military service. Labeled as \u201c4Fs,\u201d these players were good enough to play 154 games a year in the majors, yet were not ideal material for the Armed Forces. In 1944 the average major league team had 10 4Fs on its roster.\n\nThe 4F classification would be a godsend for the St. Louis Browns, who just happened to have 18 such players on their team in 1944.\n\nThe general makeup of the Browns\u2019 roster was a classic reflection on the state of the game during World War II. There were pitchers Nels Potter and Jack Kramer, considered washed up after subpar stints during the late 1930s, but now making good on a second chance. Infielders Don Gutteridge and Mark Christman, both out of the majors after 1940, were back in simply because they were available. Outfielder Milt Byrnes was playing full-time in the second of what would be his only three years of big league ball, all during the war. Pitcher Denny Galehouse, a mediocre pitcher before the war who looked better during, was available on Sundays since it was his day off from wartime employment at nearby Akron, Ohio. And there was shortstop Vern Stephens, a genuine talent who was hanging around because he had been classified 4F with a bad knee.\n\nLast and once least was pitcher Sid Jakucki. His only major league experience came eight years earlier when he struggled to a 0-3 record and an 8.71 ERA for the 1936 Browns. Nonetheless, Jakucki was given a new lease on big league life after he was found playing semipro ball in Houston.\n\nWhen this ragtag batch of once-and-current major leaguers won their first nine games on the year, people joked that the standings were being printed upside down. Remaining near or at the top throughout the year, the Browns watched as the competition within the AL began to wither away to mid-season military deferment. The Boston Red Sox came on strong, only to be sapped by the draft\u2014laying claim to productive hitters in Bobby Doerr and Jim Tabor, as well as pitcher Tex Hughson, who left late in the year with an 18-5 record and 2.26 ERA.\n\nOne team that stayed tight with the Browns to the very finish was the Detroit Tigers\u2014blessed with the double-barreled pitching sensation of Hal Newhouser and Dizzy Trout, a pair of 4F cases who between them won a stunning 56 games. The midseason loss of outfielder Dick Wakefield\u2014on his way to a possible triple crown\u2014likely deprived the Tigers of taking control of the AL, forcing them into a dogfight with the Browns.\n\nTrailing the Tigers by a game going into the season\u2019s final weekend\u2014and with the New York Yankees coming to St. Louis for the year\u2019s last four games\u2014the Browns capitalized on their rare case of pennant fever. While Detroit split the first two games in a doubleheader against Washington, the Browns swept the Yankees in a twinbill as the two former rejects, Jack Kramer and Nels Potter, each earned a win by allowing a combined total of one run. After the Browns and Tigers both won the next day to remain tied for first, it was Detroit who lost its final game to the Senators\u2014leaving the Browns\u2019 destiny in their own hands as they took the field against the Yankees for their last game.\n\nA rare opportunity called for a rare sellout at Sportsman\u2019s Park, the first in 20 years for the Browns; 15,000 were turned away. St. Louis starter Sid Jakucki, known to be more than a recreational drinker, was literally locked away in his hotel room the night before to keep from loosening up at the bar.\n\nAfter trailing early, 2-0, the Browns evened the score with the help of a home run from Chet Laabs\u2014another player who split his time between the Browns and war-related employment. Laabs then broke the tie with another blast\u2014just his fifth of the year\u2014and aided with Vern Stephens\u2019 late insurance homer, Jakucki did his part in silencing the Yankees the rest of the way. The Browns won the game\u2014and the only AL flag they would ever conquer.\n\nEven in triumph, there was a tinge of shame placed upon the Browns\u2019 pennant-winning performance for the record book; their 89-65 effort would go down as the worst by an AL champion to date."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/discussions/99211", "page_content": "After 4 games of the 1942 World Series between the St. Louis Cardinals and the New York Yankees, the Cardinals enjoyed a 3 games to 1 lead.

He won all five of his Gold Glove Awards with the Cardinals and is often considered one of the finest gloves ever at third base.\n\n\n\nBoyer was born in Liberty, Mo., and became a high school star in Alba. He signed with the Cardinals in 1949 as a pitcher, but during one game in his second Minor League season, the club's third baseman got injured. Boyer took over at the position, showed his hitting talent and never pitched again. He debuted in '55 and made his first of 11 All-Star teams in '56. He\u2019s the only Cardinal in history to have hit for the cycle twice ('61 and '64). In '58, he hit .307, the first of four consecutive seasons with at least a .300 average.\n\n\n\nIn Game 4 of the 1964 World Series against the Yankees, Boyer hit a sixth-inning grand slam to rally the Cardinals from a 3-0 deficit to a 4-3 win. Boyer and the Cardinals beat the Yankees and their third baseman, Ken\u2019s brother, Clete, in seven games that year.\n\n\n\nBoyer was traded to the Mets in 1965, but he returned to the Cardinals as a coach and Minor League manager in the 1970s, taking over the big league club from '78 until part way through '80. He died of lung cancer at age 51 in '82, and when the Cardinals retired his No. 14 two years later, Boyer became the only non-Hall of Famer to have his number hanging on the left-field wall of Busch Stadium. Fifty-five years after he left the Cardinals, Boyer still ranks third in home runs (255), sixth in RBIs (1,001) and ninth in hits (1,855) in the franchise\u2019s record books.\n\n\n\n\\\"\\\\[Boyer\\\\] wasn't a guy for show, at all,\\\" Mike Shannon, Boyer\u2019s eventual successor at third base, told Rick Hummel of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2009. \\\"He wasn't flashy.

But one transaction they made during the season stands out as altering the landscape of the franchise: the trade of pitcher Curt Schilling to the Arizona Diamondbacks on July 26, 2000.\n\nClearly, Schilling\u2019s fate was sealed in Philadelphia. The team had to trade him for the best possible package, something that was easier said than done because Schilling was limiting the places to which he\u2019d agree to be traded. So even though I don\u2019t have fond memories of GM Ed Wade, I can\u2019t exactly put all of the blame on him for what transpired. Still\u2026\n\nTo refresh your memory, the Phillies received pitchers Omar Daal, Nelson Figueroa, and Vicente Padilla, along with first baseman Travis Lee in exchange for their ace. They were not going to get \u201cequal value\u201d from Arizona in any way, shape, or form, but the hope was that a couple of the players would turn into serviceable pieces for a rebuilding club like the Phillies. Let\u2019s see how that worked out.\n\nOmar Daal had won 16 games for the D-Backs in 1999 but had struggled mightily in 2000, posting a 2-10 record with a 7.22 ERA at the time of the trade. He actually pitched halfway decently for the Phils once he came over, but that didn\u2019t stop him from racking up the losses since the team was so bad. From August 13 through September 16, he lost seven straight STARTS, not just decisions, which is extremely difficult to do. What makes it even sadder is that the last five of them were actually quality starts (6+ innings pitched with 3 earned runs or less). That put Daal at 19 losses with two more starts left to go in the season.\n\nThere was big-time drama over whether or not he would become the majors\u2019 first 20-game loser in two decades, but he didn\u2019t get there. He actually could have pitched again on the season\u2019s final day, but the Phillies didn\u2019t want to take any chances at embarrassing the guy, so they sat him. He\u2019d follow that up with a surprisingly good 2001, going 13-7 with a 4.46 ERA, after which he was traded to the Dodgers.\n\nAs for Nelson Figueroa, he seemed like the proverbial \u201cthrow-in\u201d of the trade, having just three games of major league experience under his belt. He wouldn\u2019t debut for the Phils until 2001, and he actually pitched quite well, going 4-5 with a 3.94 ERA in 19 games (13 starts) for the club. But the Phillies decided not to roster him at the start of the 2002 season, and he was lost to waivers. He would randomly resurface with the Phillies for a few months in 2010, which nobody remembers.\n\nWe\u2019ll skip to Travis Lee, the only position player in the trade, next. Lee had a nice start to his MLB career in 1998, finishing third in NL Rookie of the Year voting (well behind Kerry Wood and Todd Helton). After a step back in 1999, he was plodding along again in 2000 at the time of the trade. Once he came to the Phils, he would stick through the 2002 season. He played a slick first base, but the bat never really materialized. In 366 games, he batted .258 with just 34 home runs and 174 RBI. The Phillies would slightly upgrade their offense at first base when they let him leave and signed Jim Thome.\n\nFinally, the \u201ccrown jewel\u201d of the Schilling trade, Vicente Padilla. Just 22 at the time of the trade (even though he looked 50 already), Padilla seemed like he had the raw talent to develop into a good starter. The Phillies played it slow with him, though, giving him 28 games out of the bullpen over the rest of 2000, followed by 23 games in 2001.\n\nHe did get some good time in the rotation at AAA that year, however, and so the decision was made to plug him in as a starter for the Phillies in 2002. He did not disappoint, delivering an all-star campaign, and it was at that All-Star Game that Padilla became an interesting footnote of baseball history. He was not expected to pitch in the game, being withheld just in case it went long. And that\u2019s exactly what happened, with the contest going to extra innings.\n\nPadilla pitched the 10th and 11th innings, and he even got an at bat. (Why did we ever let pitchers hit in All-Star Games?) At any rate, Padilla was unable to take the mound for a third inning, forcing the game to end in a tie since he was the last pitcher for the National League. You can hardly blame the guy, and it was definitely in the Phillies\u2019 best interest to not have their pitcher risk injury in an exhibition, but it was still embarrassing.\n\nPadilla was good again for the Phils in 2003, but he struggled for much of 2004 and 2005 before he was shipped out to Texas that offseason as the last remnant of the Curt Schilling trade. As for Schilling himself, he\u2019d pitch seven more seasons, including THREE seasons of 20-plus wins for Arizona and Boston. He also collected three World Series rings and cemented himself as one of the most clutch pitchers in major league history. Despite all this, Schilling remains outside the Hall of Fame for now, which can only be attributed to his personality and all of the enemies he\u2019s made because the guy was clearly an amazing player.\n\nThe Phillies and their fans were treated to nine years of Schilling, an era that ended 20 years ago today. He was one of the greatest pitchers in franchise history, which is why it\u2019s such a shame that he couldn\u2019t be part of a World Series winner here and that the organization could only get pennies on the dollar for him when they ultimately parted ways.\n\nThe return for Schilling wasn\u2019t as bad as you probably remember it being, it just seems worse because of all of the success that he had after he left. But Schilling wasn\u2019t going to be in Philly for long, as he clearly wanted out, so the team just had to take what they could get. Maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s not remembered all too fondly around here, despite what he did in a Philadelphia Phillies uniform."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/35399985/phillies-acquire-reliever-gregory-soto-infielder-kody-clemens-tigers", "page_content": "The Philadelphia Phillies have acquired hard-throwing lefty reliever Gregory Soto and infielder Kody Clemens from the Detroit Tigers, the team announced Saturday.\n\nIn return, Detroit received infielder Nick Maton, outfielder Matt Vierling and catcher Donny Sands.\n\nSoto, 27, was an All-Star the past two seasons, including 2022, when he went 2-11 for the fourth-place Tigers.

Kruk, who is currently a broadcaster for the Phillies, had a 10-year career during which he hit exactly 100 homers, batted exactly .300, and posted an excellent .397 on-base percentage. In baseball history, there are only 32 members of the admittedly arbitrary 100/.300/.395+ club. Kruk is one of only 10 members of the club that played after 1963. The others: Mike Trout, Joey Votto, Todd Helton, Chipper Jones, Manny Ram\u00edrez, Frank Thomas, Larry Walker, Edgar Martinez, and Wade Boggs. Of them, five are Hall of Famers. Trout and Votto will be, and Helton and Ram\u00edrez should be.\n\nOn this day in 1989, the Phillies made a franchise-altering trade, acquiring Kruk along with infielder Randy Ready from the Padres in exchange for outfielder Chris James. The Padres had just swept the Phillies at home and were hoping to jump into the playoff race. They immediately went into a losing skid, but caught fire at the end of the season, finishing 89-73. However, that wasn\u2019t good enough as the Giants won the NL West with a 92-70 record. James was solid for the Padres, posting a .743 OPS with 11 homers and 46 RBI in 87 games.\n\nKruk had an interesting but brief major league career with the Padres. His roommate, Roy Plummer, was an armed robber. Kruk was completely unaware of this. In spring training of 1988, the FBI informed Kruk of his roommates\u2019 activities. Kruk feared retribution from Plummer and said that the anxiety affected his baseball performance. In 1988, Kruk batted what was for him a poor .241/.369/.362 with nine homers and 44 RBI over 466 plate appearances.\n\nThe Phillies didn\u2019t enjoy immediate success upon Kruk\u2019s arrival in 1989. The club finished the season with a losing record and would do the same in the ensuing three seasons. None of it was Kruk\u2019s fault, though: in aggregate, from 1990-92, he hit .303/.393/.459, earning two All-Star nominations. In this span of time, the only other first basemen to hit above .300 were Frank Thomas, Paul Molitor, Hal Morris, and Rafael Palmeiro. The Padres had used Kruk both in the corner outfield and at first base, but the Phillies made him a full-time first baseman, which turned out to be a good move.\n\nIn 1993, everything came together for the Phillies and Kruk had what was arguably the greatest season of his career. He hit .316, which was actually seven points below his average the previous year, but he drew 111 walks to push his on-base percentage up to .430. Kruk hit third in the lineup, creating plenty of RBI opportunities for Dave Hollins in the clean-up spot, Darren Daulton at No. 5, and the trio of Jim Eisenreich, Pete Incaviglia, and Wes Chamberlain in the No. 6 spot. The Phillies shocked the world in \u201993, winning the NL East by three games over the Expos with a 97-65 record. They then dispatched the Braves in six games in the NLCS to advance to the World Series against the Blue Jays.\n\nKruk was productive in the NLCS, contributing six hits including a pair of doubles, a triple, a home run, four walks, five RBI, and four runs scored. But he turned things up a notch in the World Series, registering multi-hit performances in the first three games. He would finish the World Series with eight hits in 23 at-bats along with seven walks, four RBI, and four runs scored. The World Series was winnable for the Phillies as they lost a barnburner Game 4 15-14, and of course, dropped the deciding Game 6 on a World Series-clinching walk-off three-run home run by Joe Carter off of Mitch Williams.\n\n1994 was tough on Kruk in many ways. He was diagnosed with testicular cancer in spring training. Knee issues continued to bother him, and then Major League Baseball had a work stoppage. In an abbreviated season, Kruk hit a still-productive .823 OPS. He became a free agent and, when baseball came back, he signed with the White Sox. In the first inning of a July 30 game against the Orioles in \u201995, Kruk singled to left field off of Scott Erickson. He reached first base, bowed to the fans, and walked off the field into retirement. Kruk told the media, \u201cThe desire to compete at this level is gone. When that happens, it\u2019s time to go.\u201d\n\nKruk has spent his post-playing days working in sports media as both a broadcaster (Phillies, ESPN nationally) and as a commentator (The Best Damn Sports Show Period, Baseball Tonight). The Phillies inducted him into their Wall of Fame in August 2011. One wonders if Kruk hadn\u2019t been bit by the injury bug, and if there hadn\u2019t been a work stoppage, if he might have been able to accrue some more numbers to have a borderline Hall of Fame case. Regardless, he\u2019ll go down as one of the games\u2019 quietly great hitters.\n\nFollow @Baer_Bill"}], "Whitey Kurowski played two seasons in Philadelphia Phillies.": [{"url": "https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/kurowwh01.shtml", "page_content": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhen was Whitey Kurowski born?\n\nWhitey Kurowski was born on April 19, 1918.\n\nWhere was Whitey Kurowski born?\n\nWhitey Kurowski was born in Reading, PA.\n\nHow tall was Whitey Kurowski?\n\nWhitey Kurowski was 5-11 (180 cm) tall.\n\nHow much did Whitey Kurowski weigh when playing?\n\nWhitey Kurowski weighed 193 lbs (87 kg) when playing.\n\nHow many seasons did Whitey Kurowski play?\n\nWhitey Kurowski played 9 seasons.\n\nIs Whitey Kurowski in the Hall of Fame?\n\nWhitey Kurowski has not been elected into the Hall of Fame.\n\nWhat position did Whitey Kurowski play?\n\nWhitey Kurowski was a Third Baseman.\n\nHow many hits did Whitey Kurowski have?\n\nWhitey Kurowski had 925 hits over his career.\n\nHow many home runs did Whitey Kurowski have?\n\nWhitey Kurowski had 106 home runs over his career.\n\nWhat was Whitey Kurowski's average?\n\nWhitey Kurowski had a .286 average over his career.\n\nHow many teams has Whitey Kurowski played for?\n\nWhitey Kurowski played for 1 team, the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nHow many World Series has Whitey Kurowski won?\n\nWhitey Kurowski won 3 World Series.\n\nWhen did Whitey Kurowski retire?\n\nWhitey Kurowski last played in 1949."}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Whitey_Kurowski", "page_content": "George John Kurowski\n\nBR page\n\nBiographical Information [ edit ]\n\nWhitey Kurowski played nine seasons in the major leagues, all for the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1940's.

In a nine-season career, Kurowski posted a.286 batting average with 106 home runs and 529 Reserve Bank of India in 916 games played. Kurowski\"s childhood nickname came from his already white hair. A native of Reading, Pennsylvania, Kurowski overcame several personal problems. Kurowski overcame childhood osteomyelitis, which made him miss a part of a bone on his right forearm. His most productive season came in 1947, when he posted career-highs in average (310), home runs (27), Reserve Bank of India (104), runs (108), doubles (27), slugging % (544) and on-base % (420). An All-Star during five consecutive seasons (1943-1947), Kurowski exceeded the 20 home run mark three times to set a major league record for a third baseman (1944-1945, 1947), and hit over.300 three times (1945-1947). He also led the National League three times in putouts, twice in fielding %, and once in double plays.

He was 81.\n\nKurowski, who lived in Shillington, had been in failing health since suffering a stroke after heart bypass surgery in July, according to his wife, Joan.\n\nOn the afternoon of Oct. 5, 1942, a remarkable stretch of World Series success for the Yankees came to an end with one swing by a rookie infielder. George (Whitey) Kurowski's two-run home run off Red Ruffing into the left-field stands at Yankee Stadium in the ninth inning of Game 5 propelled the Cardinals to a 4-2 victory and a Series title, the first time the Yankees had been beaten in nine trips to the Series since they were defeated by the Cards in 1926.\n\nThat Kurowski was even in a major league uniform defied the odds. When he was growing up in Reading, Pa., he fell off a fence and landed in broken glass, severely cutting his right arm. Two years later, he began suffering severe pain and was found to have developed osteomyelitis, a bone inflammation. Three inches of bone above his wrist were surgically removed, leaving the arm weakened and with an unnatural bend.

(I learned a great deal about both from my Aunt Irene.) With that in mind, this post will be dedicated to my personally selected Polish-American MLB All Star squad \u2013 one player at each position in the field, two starting pitchers (a lefty and a righty) and two relievers (again, a right-hander and a southpaw).\n\nThe team I came up with looks pretty competitive. The twelve players played a combined 204 major leagues seasons (none fewer than nine). The lineup includes six MLB Hall of Famers. Together, this dozen major leaguers garnered 79 All Star selections, 24 Gold Gloves and 12 batting titles. They also can point to four Most Valuable Player Awards and one Triple Crown. In addition, eleven of the twelve have been inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame in Orchard Lake Village, Michigan.\n\nNote: For a look at an All Star squad picked on the basis of the ability to handle Nolan Ryan\u2019s heat, click here.\n\nWe\u2019ll go through the All Star Squad first, but there are a couple of special mentions (detailed at the end of the post): 1) Moe Drabowsky \u2013 The best-ever major leaguer actually born in Poland; and Art \u201cPinky\u201d Deras \u2013 the Polish-American youngster acknowledged as the Best Little League Player Ever (there\u2019s even a documentary about him). So, let\u2019s get to it.\n\n\u2014\u2013THE BASEBALL ROUNDTABLE POLISH-AMERICAN ALL STAR TEAM\u2014\u2013\n\nCatcher \u2013 A.J. Pierzynski\n\nI\u2019ve got a special spot in my heart for the catcher on my All Polish-American squad \u2013 a hard-nosed player who started his MLB career with my Minnesota Twins. A.J. Pierzynski was a consistent and quality performer who always came to win\n\n_______________________________________\n\nIf you played against him, you hated him. If you played with him, you hated him a little less \u2026. He\u2019s worth the work because he always shows up for you.\u201d\n\nOzzie Guillen, Manager, Chicago White Sox\n\n__________________________________\n\nPierzynski, signed by the Twins out of high school in 1994, made his MLB debut with Minnesota (as a 21-year-old) in 1998. The 6\u20193\u201d/250-pound, left-handed hitter (right-handed thrower) played in 19 MLB seasons \u2013 for the Twins (1998-2003); Giants (2004); White Sox (2005-2012); Rangers (2013); Red Sox (2014); Cardinals (2014); and Braves (2015-16).\n\nPierzynski was a two-time All Star. He collected 2,043 hits in 2,059 games (for a .280 career average), hit 188 home runs and drove in 909. His best season came with the Twins in 2003, when he hit .312, with 11 home runs and 74 RBI (although he did hit a career-high 27 home runs for the White Sox in 2012). He ranks eighth all time in games played at catcher. He holds the AL record for most consecutive games (by a catcher) in a season without an error at 117 in 2005 (tied with Buddy Rosar, Athletics, 1946). Pierzynski was about as steady at the plate as you can get. For his career, he hit .280:\n\n.283 at home \u2013 .277 on the road\n\n.282 in the first-half of the season; .278 in the second half.\n\n.287 with runners on base; .287 with runners in scoring position; .275 with the bases empty.\n\n______________________________________________________\n\nFirst Base \u2013 Ted Kluszewski\n\nTed \u201cBig Klu\u201d Kluszewski was a rare breed \u2013 a true power hitter who also practiced exceptional plate discipline. In 1954, for example, Kluszewski hit .326, with 49 home runs and 141 RBI \u2013 a season made even more remarkable by the fact he struck out only 35 times (versus 78 walks). I doubt if we\u2019ll ever see another player top 40 home runs without reaching 40 whiffs. Kluszewski, in fact, had a streak of four seasons (1953-56) when he hit over .300, drove in 100+ runs, bashed 35+ home runs \u2013 and struck out no more than 40 times in any season. In those four seasons, Kluszewski hit 171 home runs \u2013 and fanned 140 times (average 43 HR\u2019s and 35 whiffs a season). It should also be noted that Kluszewski led NL first baseman in fielding percentage every year from 1951 through 1955. Unfortunately, a back injury in 1956 hampered his performance in the later years of his career (he played until 1961). He played for the Reds (1947-1957); Pirates (1958-59); White Sox (1959-60); and Angels (1961).\n\nKluszewski \u2013 a big man for his time at 6\u20192\u201d/225-pounds \u2013 is also noted for adding a bit of flair to the game, making his own intimidating fashion statement. Big Klu complained that his uniform jersey was too tight for his large and powerful biceps. He went on to have the sleeves cut from his jersey \u2013 exposing his bare arms from the shoulder. (This was considered a bold move at that very conforming time in the game\u2019s history.)\n\nKluszewski only appeared in one post-season \u2013 hitting .391, with three homers and ten RBI in the 1958 World Series (for the White Sox). True to his form \u2013 Big Klu did not strike out even once (25 plate appearance) in the Series.\n\nBig Klu was an Angel Taken by the Angels in the 1960 expansion draft, Kluszewski hit the first-ever home run for the expansion team (a two-run shot in the first inning of the Angels\u2019 first game \u2013 April 11 versus the Orioles). He added a punctuation mark, by hitting the Angels\u2019 second\u2013ever home run (a three-run shot) the very next inning. The Angels won 7-2 and, of course, Kluszewski did not strikeout.\n\nThe big left-hander hit .298 over his 15-season MLB career, with 279 home runs and 1,028 RBI. The four-time All Star topped .300 in seven seasons, drove in 100+ runs in four seasons and hit 40 or more long balls in three campaigns. His best season was 1954, when he hit .326-49-141. Ultimately, however, Big Klu is best remembered for those sleeveless jerseys, muscular arms and exceptional bat control.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nSecond Base \u2013 Bill Mazeroski\n\nConsidered the best fielding second baseman of all time by many, Bill Mazeroski was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2001.He played 17 MLB seasons \u2013 all with the Pirates \u2013 hitting .260, with 138 home runs and 853 RBI. It was, however, his glove the earned him a spot on this squad. \u201cMaz\u201d was a seven-time All Star and an eight-time Gold Glover at the keystone sack. He led NL second baseman in assists nine times, putouts five times and double plays turned eight times. (He is the all-time career leader in double plays by a second baseman, fifth in assists, seventh in puts and tenth in games played at the two-bag. The 5\u201911\u201d/183-pound right-hander\u2019s best season at the plate was probably 1962, when he hit .271, with 14 home runs and 81 RBI.\n\nBill Mazeroski is best remembered for two things \u2013 his unmatched skill at turning the double play and his walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game Seven of the 1960 World Series \u2013 which gave the Pirates a 10-9 win and an unlikely World Championship. In the Series, the Yankees outhit the Pirates .338 to .256, out-homered the Pirates 10 to four and outscored Pittsburgh 55 to 27. Mazeroski hit .320 in the seven-game set, smacked two of the Pirates\u2019 four home runs and drove in five tallies. Bobby Richardson of the losing Yankees hit .367 and drove in 12 runs to win the Series MVP Award \u2013 still the only player on a losing team to take home the World Series MVP Trophy.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nThird Base \u2013 George Kurowksi\n\nGeorge \u201cWhitey\u201d Kurowski played in nine MLB seasons (1941-49), all for the Cardinals. In the six seasons that he played at least 100 games, he was an All Star four times. In the three seasons from 1945 to 1947, Kurowski hit .311, with 62 home runs and 295 RBI. For his career, he hit .286 (in 916 games), with 106 home runs and 529 RBI. He led NL third baseman in putouts in three seasons, as well as in assists and doubles plays once each. He finished in the top ten in home runs in the league five times, RBI four times and batting average three times. His best season was 1947, when he hit .310, with 27 home runs, 104 RBI and 108 runs scored.\n\nWhitey Kurowski had to overcome the effects of a childhood injury and osteomyelitis in his right (throwing) arm in his quest to reach the major leagues. The surgery required to save his arm left his right wing about three inches inches shorter than his left. His determination is reflected in the fact that he made the major leagues as a third basemen \u2013 a position the demands a strong throwing arm. Arm problems most likely shortened his career. (The Society for American baseball Research reports Kurowski \u201cunderwent 13 operations on the arm so he could continue playing.)\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nShortstop \u2013 Alan Trammell\n\nThe shortstop selection for this team \u2013 Alan Trammell \u2013 was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2019. The 6\u2019/165-pound Trammell (a right-hander) was a Tigers\u2019 second round draft pick right out of high school in 1976. He made his MLB debut in September of 1977 and went on to play 20 MLB seasons \u2013 all for the Tigers.\n\nTrammell was a six-time All Star and a four-time Gold Glover. Over his career, he collected 2,365 hits (.285 average), with 185 home runs, 1,003 RBI, 1,231 runs scored and 236 stolen bases. He hit over .300 seven times (a high of .343 in 1987), hit 20 or more home runs twice, scored 100+ runs in three seasons and stole 20 or more bases three times. His best season was 1987, when Trammell hit .343, collected 205 hits, knocked 28 home runs, drove in 105 and scored 109.\n\nAllen Trammell (SS) and Lou Whitaker (2B) played together for 19 seasons \u2013 MLB\u2019s longest every SS-2B teammates run.\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nHonorable Mention at Shortstop \u2013 Troy Tulowitzki Troy Trevor Tulowitzki earns honorable mention here with his glove (a two-time gold Glover) and bat (topping 20 home runs in seven of 12 MLB seasons). Still active, \u201cTulo\u201d may someday take Alan Trammell\u2019s spot in this lineup. Tulowitzki has played for the Rockies (2006-2015) and Blue Jays (2016-17). He missed the 2018 season (ankle surgery) and signed with the Yankees for 2019. Tulowitzki is a five-time All Star, whose best season was 2014, when he hit .340 with 30 home runs and 105 RBI for the Rockies. For his career, he is .290 (in 1,286 games), with 224 home runs and 779 RBI. His numbers would be even stronger if not for the injury bug. His past injuries include: a torn left quadriceps, fractured wrist, groin surgery, fractured rib, hip surgery, cracked shoulder blade. Troy Tulowitzki \u2026 Rare Feats Troy Tulowitzki is one of only two players to both hit for the cycle and turn an unassisted triple play (the other is John Valentin).\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nOutfield \u2013 Stan Musial\n\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with Stan \u201cThe Man\u201d Musial on your team. One of the greatest players in MLB history (inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1960), Musial played 22 MLB seasons (all for the Cardinals) between 1941 and 1963 (he missed 1945 to military service).\n\nMusial was an All Star in 20 of his 22 seasons and a three-time NL Most Valuable Player. He won seven batting titles and led the NL in hits six times, runs scored five times, RBI two times, doubles eight times and triples five times. He also topped the NL in total bases, on base percentage and slugging percentage six times each.\n\nStan Musial hit .347 in 1944 \u2013 missed the 1945 season due to military service \u2013 and came back to hit .365 in 1946.\n\nMusial hit over .300 in 17 full seasons and over .350 in five campaigns (a high of .376 in 1948). He topped 20 home runs ten times, with a high of 39 in 1948. He also hit 50 or more doubles twice, 20 triples twice, had 200 or more hits in six seasons, 100+ RBI in ten seasons and 100+ runs scored in 11. For his career, Musial had 3,630 hits (.331 average), 475 home runs and 1,951 RBI. and 1,949 runs scored. He is in MLB\u2019s top ten all time in games played, hits, runs scored, runs batted in, doubles and total bases.\n\nHow good was Stan Musial? He was good enough to take your breath away. Vin Scully\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nOutfield \u2013 Al Simmons (Szymanski)\n\nAl Simmons is the second Hall of Famer in our Polish-American All Star outfield \u2013 and he put up Musial-like numbers (Musial-lite?). However, Simmons did not enjoy as notable a nickname as \u201cStan the Man.\u201d Due to his unusual batting style (front foot pointed toward third base), he became known as \u201cBucketfoot Al.\u201d (Note: It\u2019s reported Simmons went with Simmons over Szymanski because of the difficulty people had pronouncing Szymanski.)\n\nSimmons played 20 MLB seasons (1924-41, 1943-44) and ended just 73 hits shy of 3,000 \u2013 with a .334 career average and 307 home runs. Simmons played for the Athletics (1924-32, 1940-41, 1944), White Sox (1933-35); Tigers (1936), Senators (1937-38), Braves (1939), Reds (1939) Red Sox 1943)\n\nSimmons was a two-time batting champ, who hit over .300 in 13 seasons \u2013 and over .380 in four campaigns. The 5\u201911\u201d/190-pound righty also led his league in hits twice, and had 200 or more hits six times. In addition, he led his league in runs scored once, and RBI once.

He led the AL in runs scored three times, doubles three times, hits twice and home runs and RBI once each. His best year was 1967, when he won the AL Triple Crown with a .326-44-121 stat line. Yaz finished his career with 3,419 hits (.285 average), 452 long balls and 1,944 RBI. He also hit .369-4-11 in 17 post-season contests. He is among MLB\u2019s top ten (career) in games played, at bats, hits, total bases, doubles and walks. In 1968 \u2013 known in baseball lore as \u201cThe Year of the Pitcher\u201d \u2013 Carl Yastrzemski won the American League batting title with a .301 average \u2013 the lowest ever for a league leaders.\n\nSide Note:\n\nI have my own memories of Yaz. With two games left in the 1967 season, my Twins went into Boston with a one-game lead over the Red Sox and lost two games (and the pennant) to Boston by scores of 6-4 and 5-3. All Yaz did was go 7-for-8 with a double, a home run, two runs scored and six RBI. Ouch-ski!\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nRH Starting Pitcher \u2013 Phil Niekro\n\nPhil Niekro spent 24 seasons on the MLB mound: Braves (1964-83, 1987); Yankees (1984-85); Indians (1986-87); Blue Jays (1987). During that time, Niekro earned 318 wins (16th all time) versus 274 losses \u2013 and put up a 3.35 ERA. The 6\u20191\u201d/180-pound knuckleballer won 20 or more games three times and 15 or more in 13 seasons. His nickname was \u201cKnucksie,\u201d but I would have preferred \u201cKnuck-ski.\u201d\n\nNiekro led the National League in wins in 1974 (20) and 1979 (21) He was also the league leader once each in earned run average (1.87), winning percentage (17-4, .810 in 1982 \u2013 at age 43) and strikeouts (262 in 1977). Working with the tireless ease of a knuckleballer, he also led the NL four times each in games started, complete games and inning pitched. Niekro\u2019s best season was 1974, when he went 20-13, 2.38 \u2013 leading the NL in wins, complete games (18) and innings pitched 302 1/3.\n\nPhil Niekro Trivia \u2026 Phil Niekro is the last MLB pitcher to lead his league in both wins and losses in the same season \u2013 going 21-20, 3.39 in 1979. That season, he also led the league in starts (44), complete games (23) and innings pitched (342). Phil Niekro and his brother Joe Niekro hold the record for the most MLB wins by brothers, with 539. Phil went 318-274, while Joe went 221-204. In 1979, Phil and Joe Niekro tied to the NL lead in victories with 21 each. On May 29, 1976, Joe Niekro hit the only home run of his 22-season (1,165 plate appearances) MLB career. The opposing pitcher? His brother Phil. On August 5, 1973, Phil Niekro threw the first no hitter for the \u201cAtlanta\u201d Braves \u2013 defeating the San Diego Padres 9-0.\n\n____________________________________________\n\nLH Starting Pitcher \u2013 Ed Lopat (Lopatynski)\n\nEddie Lopat pitched in 12 MLB seasons \u2013 for the White Sox (1944-47), Yankees (1948-55) and Orioles (1955). He went 166-112, with a 3.21 earned run average. It\u2019s reported that Eddie used Lopat over Lopatynski because the latter did not fit into a box score. Lopat also picked up the nickname \u201cThe Junkman,\u201d because of his ability to both change speeds and deliver a wide range of breaking pitches.\n\nThe 5\u201910\u2019/180-pound southpaw was an All Star with the Yankees in 1933, when he went 21-9, 2.91 (his only 20-win season \u2013 although from 1947 through 1953, he won 15 or more games in six of seven seasons). In 1953, again with the Yankees, Lopat went 16-4 and led the American League in winning percentage (.800) and ERA (2.42).\n\nIn seven World Series starts, all with the Yankees, Lopat went 4-1, 2.60 with three complete games.\n\n______________________________________________________\n\nRH Reliever \u2013 Jim Konstanty\n\nJim Konstanty has the distinction of being the first MLB relief pitcher to win a league MVP Award. He accomplished the feat in 1950, when he was called on in relief a league-leading 74 times by the Phillies. Konstanty won 16 games (seven losses) and led the league with 22 saves. That season, the Phillies won the NL pennant with a 91-63 record \u2013 which means Konstanty won or saved 42 percent of Philadelphia\u2019s wins.\n\nIn his eleven MLB seasons, the 6\u20191\u201d/202-pound righty went 66-48, 3.46 and saved 76 games (152 innings pitched in relief). By the way, James was Konstanty\u2019s middle name \u2013 his first name was Casimir.\n\nA Man for All Seasons \u2026 In his senior year in high school, Jim Konstanty was captain of the Arcade High School basketball, baseball and football teams. Then, at Syracuse University, he lettered in baseball, basketball, soccer and boxing.\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nLH Reliever \u2013 Ron Perranoski\n\nRon Perranoski \u2013 a 6\u2019/180-pound southpaw \u2013 went 79-74, 2.79 with 178 saves in 13 MLB seasons. He played for the Dodgers (1961-67, 1972); Twins (1968-71); Tigers (1971-72); and Angels (1973).\n\nPerranoski led his league in games pitched in three seasons and games saved twice (with a high of 34 saves for the 1974 Twins). In 1963, he led the NL in winning percentage at .842 \u2013 picking up 16 wins (three losses) and 21 saves, all in relief. Add in his 1.67 earned run average and it is clearly his best season.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-A COUPLE OF SPECIAL MENTIONS \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMoe Drabowsky \u2013 Best Polish-Born Major Leaguer\n\nMiroslav Drabowsky was born in Ozano, Poland on July 21, 1935, to a Jewish (American citizen) mother and a Polish father. His family moved to the United Stars in the late 1930\u2019s, as Adolf Hitler was gaining momentum in Eastern Europe. Growing up in Connecticut, Drabowsky played high school baseball at Loomis Chaffee School and college baseball at Trinity College in Hartford. He signed with the Cubs in July of 1956 and made his MLB debut on August 7 of that year (at age 21).\n\nThe 6\u20193\u201d/190-pound righty was a starter his first four seasons, going 29-40, 3.81, with 22 complete games in 83 starts. Drabowsky switched to the bullpen in 1960 (seven starts in 32 appearances) and made a name for himself coming in from the pen. From 1960-72, he went 59-65, 3.66, with 54 saves (421 appearances in relief, 71 starts).\n\nIn 17 MLB seasons, Drabowsky went 88-105, 3.71 with 54 saves. He struck out 1,162 batters (702 walks) in 1,641 innings. Drabowsky pitched for the Cubs (1956-60); Braves (1961); Reds (1962); Athletics (1962-65); Orioles (1966-68, 1970); Royals (1969-70); Cardinals (1971-72); and White Sox (1972).\n\nMoe Drabowsky, a member of the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame (NPASHOF), gave up the 3,000th hit of Stan Musial (another NPASHOF inductee).\n\n____________________________________________\n\nArt \u201cPinky Deras \u2013 Best-Ever Little Leaguer\n\nArt \u201cPinky\u201d Deras was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame in 2011 \u2013 recognizing his exploits as a 12-year-old Little Leaguer \u2013 leading the Hamtramck, Michigan team to the 1958 Little League National Championship. Now, Deras was big for his age, six-feet tall and 135 pounds as a 12-year-old. He was also a dominant force \u2013 going 18-0 on the mound (16 shutouts and ten no-hitters) and whiffing 298 batters in 108 innings. That means 92 percent of his outs came via the strikeout. He also hit a resounding .641, with 33 home runs and 112 RBI.\n\nDeras signed a contract with the Cardinals right out of high school, declining of football scholarship to Michigan State. He played five minor league seasons, hitting .243, with 32 home runs in 518 games. He did not pitch in professionally ranks.\n\n______________________________________________________\n\nPrimary resources: Baseball-Reference.com; Society for American Baseball Research; National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nBASEBALL ROUNDTABLE ON THE TOP 100 BASEBALL BLOG LIST\n\nBaseball Roundtable is on the Feedspot list of the Top 1oo Baseball Blogs.

Led by Joe Gordon, Charlie Keller, and Joe DiMaggio, they easily won the American League pennant that season, winning 103 games and outpacing the second-place Boston Red Sox by nine games.\n\nThe Cardinals had not had nearly as easy a time in winning the National League flag. As late as August 5 they trailed the Brooklyn Dodgers by 10 games. It wasn\u2019t until they swept a two-game series against the Dodgers on September 11 and 12 that they moved into a tie for the league lead. The following day, after dropping the first game of a doubleheader against the Phillies, St. Louis began a six-game win streak that gave them the lead for good. They finished with 106 wins, two games ahead of the Dodgers, to win their sixth National League pennant.\n\nThough the Cardinals started National League MVP Mort Cooper in Game 1, they committed four errors and lost the opener, 7-4. From that point forward, however, the World Series belonged to the Cardinals.\n\nAfter winning Game 2 at Sportsman\u2019s Park, 4-3, the Cardinals went to Yankee Stadium and picked up 2-0 and 9-6 wins. As a result, Game 5 presented the opportunity to conclude the series and hoist the championship.\n\nThe Cardinals started 24-year-old right-hander Johnny Beazley, who had gone 21-6 with a 2.13 ERA during the regular season. Beazley had been the winning pitcher in Game 2, scattering 10 Yankees hits and allowing three runs in a complete-game effort.\n\nTo oppose Beazley, the Cardinals sent 37-year-old Red Ruffing to the mound. A 19-season major-league veteran, Ruffing was a six-time all-star who had received American League MVP votes in four of the previous five seasons. He went 14-7 with a 3.21 ERA in the regular season and was the winning pitcher in Game 1 of the World Series, allowing four runs over 8 2/3 innings.\n\nRuffing opened Game 5 with a scoreless first inning before Phil Rizzuto gave him a one-run lead with a solo home run to lead off the bottom of the inning. Ruffing held that lead until the top of the fourth, when Enos Slaughter hit a solo home run to right field.\n\nThe Yankees regained the lead in the bottom of the fourth when Red Rolfe laid down a bunt single and advanced to second on a throwing error by Beazley. After Rolfe advanced to third on a fly ball, DiMaggio drove him home with a single to left.\n\nNew York threatened again in the fifth as Ruffing singled and the Cardinals committed two more errors. With the bases loaded, DiMaggio grounded out to Kurowski at third base to end the inning.\n\nThe Cardinals carried that momentum into their next at-bat, as Terry Moore and Slaughter opened the inning with singles. With runners on first and third, Walker Cooper hit a sacrifice fly to right field that tied the game once more.\n\nNeither side threatened again until the top of the ninth, when Walker Cooper hit a leadoff single up the middle. After Johnny Hopp laid down a sacrifice bunt to advance Walker Cooper to second, Ruffing faced off with Kurowski, who had struck out three times against Rudding in Game 1 and was 0-for-3 with three fly balls heading into the ninth inning of Game 5.\n\nAs a 7-year-old in Reading, Pennsylvania, Kurowski had climbed a fence and fallen, landing in broken glass. When the injury turned into osteomyelitis, an infection of the bone, doctors removed four inches of his ulna, one of two bones in the forearm.\n\nOn this occasion, however, neither Kurowski\u2019s misshapen right arm nor Rudding\u2019s previous success against him made any difference. His fly ball sailed over the left-field wall to give the Cardinals a 4-2 lead heading into the bottom of the ninth.\n\nThe Yankees made things tense in the final frame when Joe Gordon led off with a single and Bill Dickey reached on the Cardinals\u2019 fourth error of the game. However, Walker Cooper picked Gordon off second base and Beazley got pinch-hitter Jerry Priddy to pop up for the second out. The Yankees called upon George Selkirk to bat in place of Rudding, but Selkirk grounded out to second baseman Jimmy Brown to end the game and the series.\n\nFor the fourth time in franchise history, the Cardinals were world champions. Bookmakers and scalpers who expected the powerhouse Yankees to win the series reportedly lost up to $100,000.[1] It was the first World Series the Yankees had lost in seven trips since 1926, when Rogers Hornsby\u2019s Cardinals won the first championship in franchise history.\n\n\u201cBaseball\u2019s domination by the New York Yankees folded up and passed out of existence before 69,052 spectators here this afternoon as the St. Louis National League Cardinals, fighting uphill in the vast Yankee Stadium, became the new world champions of the green diamond,\u201d wrote St. Louis Globe-Democrat sports editor Martin J. Haley.[2]\n\n\u201cAny time you can beat a ball club like the Yanks \u2026 well, I just feel wonderful,\u201d Cardinals manager Billy Southworth said. \u201cIf I felt any better I wouldn\u2019t be able to stand it.\u201d[3]\n\nFor bringing the championship back home to St. Louis, each player received a $6,192.50 share of the World Series purse.[4] For many of the Cardinals, that doubled their salary for the season.\n\n\u201cGosh, I can buy that farm now,\u201d pitcher Howie Krist said. \u201cIt\u2019s 150 acres and it\u2019s a good producing piece of land. Money may shrink, but 150 acres will be 150 acres five years from now, just as it is today.\u201d[5]\n\nKurowski, who was down to his last bat after breaking all of his others during the season, kept it nearby throughout the postgame celebration, showing it to teammates, visitors, and anyone who showed interest.\n\n\u201cI hope my brother Ray was listening on the radio,\u201d Kurowski said. \u201cHe\u2019s a Marine down in Parris Island, South Carolina. I got a letter from him this afternoon congratulating me on getting into the World Series, but telling me I made him look silly by fanning my first three times at bat. I got even with him today.\u201d[6]\n\nAfter the 1942 season, Kurowski made five consecutive all-star appearances. In 1945, he hit .323 with 21 homers and 102 RBIs and placed fifth in the National League MVP voting. In 1947, he again finished in the top 10 in the MVP vote after batting .310 with a career-high 27 homers and 104 RBIs. Shortly thereafter, arm injuries ended his career and he went on to become a minor-league coach and manager for 18 seasons.\n\nAfter his breakout 1942 season, Beazley\u2019s career was interrupted by World War II. Before the World Series, he had announced his intention to return home to Nashville, Tennessee, and enlist in the Marine Corps. After he beat the Yankees in Game 5, the Marines recruiting office sent him a telegram: \u201cIf you can toss hand grenades like you pitch for them Cards, hurry up.\u201d[7]\n\nAfter three years of military service, Beazley finally returned in 1946 and went 7-5 with a 4.46 ERA. Ahead of the 1947 season, the Cardinals sold him to the Boston Braves, where he won just two games the remainder of his career.\n\nBeazley\u2019s counterpart in Game 5, Ruffing, missed the next two seasons due to military service, returning in 1945 at age 40. He pitched three more seasons in the majors, making his final appearance with the White Sox in 1947.\n\nThe 1942 championship marked the beginning of a five-year stretch in which the Cardinals made four World Series appearances and won three. In 1943, the Yankees returned the favor, beating St. Louis in a five-game World Series, but the Cardinals bounced back and won the 1944 title over the cross-town Browns. In 1946, the Cardinals won the World Series again, this time defeating the Red Sox in seven games."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/13938886/world-series-line-1926-50", "page_content": "JUMP TO ...\n\nIntro | 1903-25 | 1926-50 | 1951-75 | 1976-2000 | 2001-15\n\n1926\n\nSt. Louis (NL) 4, New York (AL) 3\n\nYankees star Babe Ruth shakes hands with Cardinals star Rogers Hornsby before the start of the 1926 World Series.
