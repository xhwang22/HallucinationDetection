{"Rich Williams has written or co-written several of Kansas's biggest hits, including 'Carry On Wayward Son' and 'Dust in the Wind'.": [{"url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/kansas-williams-dust-in-the-wind-success-was-an-absolute-fluke-504506/", "page_content": "Rich Williams says he and the other members of Kansas \u201cdon\u2019t talk much\u201d about the group\u2019s various anniversaries, but hitting 35 years since the group\u2019s \u201cPoint of Know Return\u201d album and its biggest hit, \u201cDust in the Wind,\u201d has given them pause.\n\n\u201cI remember doing \u2018Dust in the Wind\u2019\u2026we weren\u2019t apprehensive, but we were wondering \u2018How\u2019s this going to be received?\u2019 because it was just acoustic guitar, violin and voice,\u201d Williams tells Billboard.com about the song. \u201cWe were always outside of the box, but this was outside of the box for us. What\u2019s funny is that, in retrospect, we took a lot of heat for \u2018selling out.\u2019 What about \u2018Dust in the Wind\u2019 was mimicking anything to do with the mainstream? That was an absolute fluke that it was a hit. We had no idea it was going to be talked about 35 years later. It was only a hit because it\u2026was a great song. Even a blind pig finds a truffle once in awhile.\u201d\n\nWilliams says the \u201cPoint\u2026\u201d anniversary will bring some of the quadruple-platinum album\u2019s songs back into the Kansas set, including \u201cParadox\u201d and \u201cCloset Chronicles.\u201d But it\u2019s unlikely the group will play the album in its entirety, the guitarist adds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been talked about,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWe did some shows with Jethro Tull last year and they were doing \u2018Aqualung.\u2019 I thought it was a great concept. There\u2019s something really cool about it. With us, there\u2019s three owners. I\u2019m all for it. Of the other two primaries, one (drummer Phil Ehart) is kind of a maybe, the other (singer-keyboardist Steve Walsh) is, \u2018No f***in\u2019 way!\u2019 For a singer, sometimes they feel like, \u2018I can\u2019t sing this lyric anymore, \u2019cause I don\u2019t believe in it.\u2019 Well, OK\u2026\u2019 So it\u2019s not in the plans, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\nThis year Kansas will continue to mix headlining shows with collegiate symphonic dates that have become staples on the group\u2019s itinerary \u2014 though Williams says that concept \u201cis starting to wind down. It\u2019s running out of steam as far as new places to play with it, I think.\u201d That, however, might allow Kansas to start thinking about a new album, he says \u2014 its first since \u201cSomewhere To Elsewhere\u201d in 2000.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not recording anything, but individually people are always inventing things, working in the studio on stuff,\u201d Williams says. \u201cA lot of it is reinventing what we already have written and altering things, creating segues and that type of stuff for the live shows rather than new material. But I\u2019ve mentioned to the guys before that we don\u2019t have to do a CD; the way things are anymore we can do two songs, if that\u2019s what we wanted to do, and put something new out there. If I were king this would be done this winter, but I\u2019m in a democracy, so we\u2019ll wait for everyone to be ready.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.grunge.com/220556/the-real-meaning-behind-kansass-carry-on-wayward-son/", "page_content": "They were working on a new album, recording tracks for what would become Leftoverture, and Livgren was doing most of the writing \u2014 band member Steve Walsh was on an empty streak, creatively \u2014 and one tune Livgren penned at the last minute caught everyone's ear, sort of. As Kansas guitarist Rich Williams told Ultimate Classic Rock, some members were less than thrilled. They didn't really want to learn yet another song before heading into the studio, but \"Carry On Wayward Son\" was something special from the beginning \u2014 in Williams' words, \"'Whoa! This has got some promise to it!'\"\n\nWith lines like, \"Carry on, my wayward son / There'll be peace when you are done,\" fans may think the song is religious, possibly referring to \"The Prodigal Son.\" However, according to Livgren, the track is actually about his life. Says Livgren, \"It's an autobiographical song. Parallel to my musical career I've always been on a spiritual sojourn, looking for truth and meaning. It was a song of self-encouragement. I was telling myself to keep on looking and I would find what I sought.\" And so he did.\n\nThe song's popularity later got a boost by CW show Supernatural, which pretty much adopted \"Carry On\" as an unofficial theme song. Ehart shared, \"And millions of these younger people that are watching the show hear the song. They go to YouTube, they go to Google, whatever, and listen to it, and start coming to our shows only knowing that song, and now starting to know other stuff about Kansas.\""}, {"url": "https://www.discogs.com/release/1644076-Kansas-The-Best-Of-Kansas", "page_content": "Title ( Format ) Label Cat# Country Year\n\nRecently Edited The Best Of Kansas ( Cassette , Compilation ) CBS Associated Records QZT 39283 US 1984\n\nRecently Edited The Best Of Kansas ( LP, Compilation, Stereo ) CBS Associated Records QZ 39283 Canada 1984\n\nNew Submission The Best Of Kansas ( LP, Compilation, Stereo ) Epic EPC 26065 UK 1984\n\nNew Submission The Best Of Kansas ( CD , Compilation ) Epic, Epic CDEPC 26065 , ZK 39283 Europe 1984"}, {"url": "https://www.vintageguitar.com/35009/richard-williams/", "page_content": "Unleashing pent-up creativity is a gratifying experience for a band, as Kansas guitarist Richard Williams can attest. The band known for the prog-/hard-rock hybrid exemplified by \u201cCarry On Wayward Son\u201d and \u201cDust in the Wind\u201d recently released Leftoverture Live & Beyond, which included the 1976 classic Leftoverture performed in its entirety along with material from 2016\u2019s The Prelude Implicit.\n\nOriginal members Williams and drummer Phil Ehart today lead a rejuvenated lineup that includes longtime bassist Billy Greer, violinist David Ragsdale along with three new members \u2013 vocalist Ronnie Platt, keyboardist David Manion, and guitarist Zak Rizvi. Their collective excitement is palpable on both Leftoverture Live & Beyond and The Prelude Implicit.\n\nLeftoverture Live & Beyond is 19 songs recorded at 12 shows in early 2017.\n\n\u201cThe only song we\u2019d never played live from Leftoverture was \u2018Questions of My Childhood.\u2019 And we didn\u2019t re-record anything or go back in and do overdubs,\u201d Williams said.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, we\u2019ve done a lot of rearrangements of Kansas songs \u2013 sometimes for good, sometimes for not so good. With this new lineup, we\u2019ve gone back as much as we can to the way the songs were written and recorded. We\u2019re trying to lean more on the original arrangements.\u201d\n\nBefore they started work on The Prelude Implicit, the band toured, and it went so well, he said, \u201c\u2026the restraints were off of us, musically.\u201d At first, doubts nagged about their ability to write new songs because former vocalist/keyboardist Steve Walsh and guitarist/keyboardist Kerry Livgren had always been Kansas\u2019 primary songwriters; Somewhere to Elsewhere was Livgren\u2019s material with the original members performing, but Williams said it was \u201can assembly-line thing\u201d with parts recorded separately.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the same as sitting in a room with a bunch of guys, developing ideas. That ebb and flow is really where some of our best stuff came from \u2013 not just from one person but by the combination and effort of everybody. We didn\u2019t have that on Somewhere to Elsewhere. That\u2019s what we had on The Prelude Implicit again,\u201d he said. \u201cWe made the album for us as much as we made it for anything else. We didn\u2019t know what it was going to be going into it. We had never done it this way before. We wanted to be quintessentially Kansas from the artwork to the lyrics to the music to the variety within the music \u2013 very well-thought-out to be as Kansas as we possibly can.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 main concern has always been about what\u2019s best for Kansas as a whole.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a team player. There\u2019s no Richard Williams solo album. I\u2019ve never had a desire to do a solo album,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my opinion, Kansas has always been the sum of its parts, not so much the talent of any one person. I\u2019ve always just been very comfortable in the role of a team player.\u201d\n\nHis attitude applies to working with other guitarists in Kansas, whether it\u2019s been Livgren, Steve Morse, or Rizvi.\n\n\u201cIn our early days, we were doing an interview and they asked Kerry, \u2018Who\u2019s your biggest influence?\u2019 He said, \u2018Probably Rich, because we play together all the time.\u2019 We were working on equipment together and guitars and guitar tones and different things. You\u2019re not in competition, but constantly working together. That\u2019s all very positive,\u201d said Williams.\n\nFor more than 30 years, Williams\u2019 main electric has been a PRS Custom from \u201984 or \u201985. Early in Kansas, he played a Gibson L-6S that\u2019s still part of his collection of about 30 guitars. He also plays a Martin D-28 based on the one he used on \u201cDust in the Wind.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty nipping at Kansas\u2019 heels in recent years has been replaced with forward-thinking confidence; pending is a tour during which they\u2019ll perform 1977\u2019s Point of Know Return in its entirety, and they\u2019re set to record a new studio album.\n\n\u201cThe quality of the shows and the performance level of the band is at an all-time high,\u201d said Williams. \u201cThe energy level, the crowd enjoyment \u2013 everything \u2013 is greater than it has been since the early days. It feels much like it did on the second, third, and fourth albums,\u201d said Williams. \u201cIt\u2019s that type of focused energy. It\u2019s been a tremendous experience. None of us are looking back, remembering when. Our best days are in front of us.\u201d \u2013 Bret Adams\n\nThis article originally appeared in VG\u2018s June 2018 issue.

Well, spoiler alert: A lot of singers don't write their own songs. Shocking, I know. It's almost as if songwriting is a completely separate skill from singing! There are some truly shocking hit songs that were written by other artists when you take a look through songwriting history, though.\n\nFor example, did you know Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\" isn't an original Whitney Houston song? I feel like this one is pretty well known at this point, but there are still those who don't know that Houston's arguably most iconic song is actually a cover of a song of the same name by Dolly Parton. Yup, \"I Will Always Love You\" was originally a country love song.\n\nSingers not writing their own music (especially in the pop genre) is actually really common. And frequently enough, songwriters end up becoming famous singers in their own right once they get to a point where they no longer want to simply sell the songs they write. But it is one hell of a lucrative line of work once you start making money off selling your tracks to big-name artists.\n\nHere are 27 hugely popular songs that were written by other famous artists:\n\n01 \"Party In The U.S.A.\" \u2014 Miley Cyrus Songwriter: Jessie J Before she rose to fame as a solo artist, Jessie J wrote one of Miley Cyrus' biggest hits, which peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. She told Glamour U.K. in 2014 that she had originally written the song for herself with Dr. Luke and Claude Kelly, but ended up not recording it. She said the song ended up paying her rent for three years.\n\n02 \"Love Yourself\" \u2014 Justin Bieber Songwriter: Ed Sheeran Sheeran penned \"Love Yourself\" from Bieber's Purpose album, then he had Bieber on his own No. 6 Collaborations Project on the track \"I Don't Care.\"\n\n03 \"Make It Right\" \u2014 BTS Songwriter: Ed Sheeran Sheeran also contributed to K-Pop sensation BTS' 2019 album, Map Of The Soul: Persona, with the song \"Make It Right.\"\n\n04 \"Sorry\" \u2014 Justin Bieber Songwriter: Julia Michaels Julia Michaels has now made a name for herself as a solo artist, but she started out writing hits for other artists for a minute. She penned Justin Bieber's \"Sorry\" for his Purpose album, arguably the album's biggest hit.\n\n05 \"Baby\" \u2014 Justin Bieber Songwriter: Christina Milian Try not to let this blow your mind, but Christina Milian is responsible for Justin Bieber's first hit. Yes, it's true. She wrote \"Baby.\" She did that. Bieber has Usher to thank for discovering him, but he owes a heck of a lot to Milian.\n\n06 \"Irreplaceable\" \u2014 Beyonc\u00e9 Songwriter: Ne-Yo Beyonc\u00e9 doesn't write a lot of her own songs. Lots of mainstream artists don't, honestly. But Ne-Yo does! The \"So Sick\" singer wrote Queen Bey's early classic \"Irreplaceable,\" and reportedly regretted selling it afterwards. I would too! That song's iconic.\n\n07 \"Diamonds\" \u2014 Rihanna Songwriter: Sia Shine bright like... all the money Sia has in the bank thanks to writing Rihanna's \"Diamonds.\" The devil works hard, but Sia works harder.\n\n08 \"Hollaback Girl\" \u2014 Gwen Stefani Songwriter: Pharrell Williams I'm going to let you in on a little secret: Pharrell Williams is behind just about every iconic song you could think of. The list gets even more overwhelming when you factor in the songs he produced. Gwen Stefani's \"Hollaback Girl\" is one of countless hit songs he penned.\n\n09 \"Pretty Hurts\" \u2014 Beyonc\u00e9 Songwriter: Sia Pharrell Williams and Sia have a lot in common in that they've grown successful for writing songs for big-name artists. Sia wrote \"Pretty Hurts,\" the opening song to Beyonc\u00e9's 2013 self-titled album.\n\n10 \"Breakaway\" \u2014 Kelly Clarkson Songwriter: Avril Lavigne I'll spread my wings and I'll... buy a song from Avril Lavigne! Clarkson's 2004 hit was actually written by emo queen Avril Lavigne. And then it was featured in The Princess Diaries 2. Yes, I remember that. No, I feel no shame.\n\n11 \"American Boy\" \u2014 Estelle, Kanye West Songwriter: John Legend John Legend wrote this classic hit with will.i.am of The Black Eyed Peas.\n\n12 \"Better Man\" \u2014 Little Big Town Songwriter: Taylor Swift Swift returned to her country music roots to pen Little Big Town's \"Better Man\" in 2016.\n\n13 \"Forget You\" \u2014 Ceelo Green Songwriter: Bruno Mars Before he was a solo artist with an Album of the Year win under his belt, Bruno Mars penned Ceelo Green's stupidly catchy \"Forget You.\"\n\n14 \"Get Me Bodied\" \u2014 Beyonc\u00e9 Songwriter: Solange Bey likes to keep it in the family. Solange Knowles actually wrote a lot of songs on Beyonc\u00e9's past albums! She wrote \"Get Me Bodied\" (and was featured in the music video), \"Upgrade U,\" and \"Why Don't You Love Me\" for her older sister.\n\n15 \"Till The World Ends\" \u2014 Britney Spears Songwriter: Kesha Kesha is a pop star in her own right, but she wrote \"Till The World Ends\" for the Princess of Pop herself.\n\n16 \"I'm A Slave 4 U\" \u2014 Britney Spears Songwriter: Pharrell Williams Who freaking knew that Pharrell wrote \"I'm A Slave For U?!\" He also wrote Snoop Dogg's \"Drop It Like It's Hot,\" Nelly's \"Hot In Herre,\" and Kelis' \"Milkshake.\" The talent this man has. The power this man has. The cultural impact this man has made.\n\n17 \"Little Things\" \u2014 One Direction Songwriter: Ed Sheeran Ed Sheeran is behind a lot of your favorite One Direction songs, \"Little Things\" being one of the not-so-little hits. Sheeran also wrote \"18,\" \"Moment,\" and \"Over Again\" for the group.\n\n18 \"Strip That Down\" \u2014 Liam Payne Songwriter: Ed Sheeran Sheeran continued his One Direction legacy by writing Liam Payne's debut solo single, \"Strip That Down.\"\n\n19 \"Rock Your Body\" \u2014 Justin Timberlake Songwriter: Pharrell Williams Did you think we were done with the Pharrell credits? Think again! Pharrell blessed Justin Timberlake by writing \"Rock Your Body\" and \"Se\u00f1orita\" for Timberlake's debut solo album, Justified.\n\n20 \"Bad Liar\" \u2014 Selena Gomez Songwriter: Julia Michaels Michaels wrote the bop that is \"Bad Liar,\" Selena Gomez's 2017 single. She also wrote Gomez's \"Hands To Myself.\" Now that she's a successful solo artist, I guess Michaels could stop writing hits for other artists. I mean, she could, but why would she want to?\n\n21 \"We Found Love\" \u2014 Rihanna Songwriter: Calvin Harris Rihanna found love in a hopeless place on her 2011 9x-platinum single, but it may not have been inspired by her own romantic endeavors after all. It was actually penned by Calvin Harris, who also appeared in several scenes of the music video.\n\n22 \"Elevator\" \u2014 Pussycat Dolls Songwriter: Lady Gaga The Pussycat Dolls\u2019 song \u201cElevator\u201d took their career to new heights, but what some fans might not have known is that the lyrics were the work of Lady Gaga. Yep, Little Monsters might take an extra liking to the song after learning that fun fact.\n\n23 \"Miss Movin' On\" \u2014 Fifth Harmony Songwriter: Julia Michaels Julia Michaels has written or co-written for dozens of artists aside from herself, including Fifth Harmony. The songstress penned the girl group\u2019s 2013 song \u201cMiss Movin\u2019 On,\u201d written about finding independence after a broken relationship.\n\n24 \"Fire Starter\" \u2014 Demi Lovato Songwriter: Julia Michaels Michael\u2019s long list of credits includes some seriously impressive names, and Lovato is undoubtedly one of the biggest artists she\u2019s written for. Michaels lent her skills on the pop star\u2019s 2013 year track \u201cFire Starter.\u201d\n\n25 \u201cWhataya Want from Me\u201d \u2014 Adam Lambert Songwriter: Pink Lambert\u2019s \u201cWhataya Want from Me\u201d took over airwaves upon its 2009 release. While the American Idol alum is an incredibly talented songwriter, even he gets a little help from friends. Pink was the mastermind behind this particular single.\n\n26 \"Unthinkable\" \u2014 Alicia Keys Songwriter: Drake If you take a look at the songwriting credits for Key\u2019s \u201cUnthinkable,\u201d they include the name Aubrey Graham, better known as Drake.\n\n27 \"Don't Cha\" \u2014 Pussycat Dolls Songwriters: CeeLo Green & Busta Rhymes It was not one, but two, superstar songwriters who hit the studio to write \u201cDon\u2019t Cha\u201d for the Pussycat Dolls. CeeLo Green and Busta Rhymes teamed up to pen the song for the now-defunct girl group."}, {"url": "https://www.npr.org/2021/07/20/1018319039/kansas-member-robby-steinhardt-dies", "page_content": "Robby Steinhardt \u2014 Whose Group Kansas Notched Hits Like 'Dust In The Wind' \u2014 Has Died\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. \u2014 Robert E. \"Robby\" Steinhardt, a violinist and vocalist with the progressive rock band Kansas, has died due to complications from pancreatitis.
