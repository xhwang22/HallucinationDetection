Already pushing forward the boundaries of research in medicine and the sciences, Birmingham was beginning to change the world.\n\nThe early days\n\nThe University grew out of Mason College, which can trace its roots back to the medical education seminars of Mr John Tomlinson in 1767-68. He was \u2018First Surgeon\u2019 to the Birmingham Workhouse Infirmary and his 28 weekly lectures on anatomy were the first to be held outside London or south of the Scottish border. Mason Science College was founded by Kidderminster-born Josiah Mason in 1875. From humble beginnings, Mason made his fortune by mass-producing key rings, pens, pen nibs and electroplating.\n\nHe became one of the country\u2019s most esteemed industrialists and philanthropists and was knighted for his generosity in establishing a great orphanage in the suburb of Erdington. The College became Mason University College in 1898 with the Rt Hon Joseph Chamberlain MP becoming the President of its Court of Governors.\n\nThe socio-political landscape\n\nTo set the scene, at this time, England\u2019s only other independent universities were in Oxford, Cambridge, Durham and London. While compulsory education had been introduced in 1880 for children between the ages of five and ten years old, most of the population entered work by the age of 14.\n\nJoseph Chamberlain was acutely aware of these limiting factors when he proposed the establishment of the University of Birmingham. He sought to provide \u2018a great school of universal instruction\u2019, so that \u2018the most important work of original research should be continuously carried on under most favourable circumstances\u2019. It was his ambition that \u2018the individual trades of the new University [would] forever associate their name and their industry with this new institution\u2019. Many aspects of Chamberlain\u2019s vision continue to inspire and guide the University today, including our continuing responsibilities to, and aspirations within, our region; providing a skilled, professional workforce and ground-breaking research that benefits regional industries.\n\nEstablishing the University\n\nChamberlain\u2019s impact on the city of Birmingham, beyond the establishment of the University, was immense, particularly in his improvements to living conditions and education. Thanks to Chamberlain's tireless work, the University was granted a Royal Charter by Queen Victoria on 24 March 1900 - and with the generous donation of land and funds, the University of Birmingham was born. Since then we have led the way with research discoveries and Nobel Prize-winners.\n\nPreserving and researching our history\n\nWhile we highlight Chamberlain\u2019s legacy in terms of the impact on establishing our University as a centre of education for the many, we are committed to encouraging our expert historical researchers to reflect on our past and acknowledge contested narratives."}, {"url": "https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/term/BIOG249899", "page_content": "Also known as Josiah Mason primary name: Mason, Josiah other name: Sir Josiah Mason\n\nDetails individual; merchant/tradesman; English; Male\n\nLife dates 1795-1881\n\nAddress Birmingham"}, {"url": "https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/2021/the-sir-josiah-mason-trust-is-helping-more-people-go-to-university", "page_content": "The Sir Josiah Mason Trust is helping more people go to University Over 300 students facing disadvantages have been supported by The Sir Josiah Mason Trust.\n\nYoung people walking onto campus at Birmingham\n\nThe Sir Josiah Mason Trust has been supporting the University\u2019s Outreach programme for more than ten years.

He began life as a street hawker of cakes, fruits and vegetables. After trying his hand in his native town at shoemaking, baking, carpentering, blacksmithing, house-painting and carpet-weaving, he moved in 1816 to Birmingham. Here he found employment in the gilt-toy trade. In 1824 he set up on his own account as a manufacturer of split-rings by machinery, to which he subsequently added the making of steel pens. Owing to the circumstance of his pens being supplied through James Perry, the London stationer whose name they bore, he was less well known than Joseph Gillott and other makers, although he was really the largest producer in England, contributing heavily to the Birmingham pen trade. In 1874 the business was converted into a limited liability company. Besides his steel-pen trade Mason carried on for many years the business of electro-plating, copper-smelting, and India-rubber ring making, in conjunction with George Elkington. Mason was almost entirely self-educated, having taught himself to write when a shoemaker\"s apprentice, and in later life he felt his deficiencies keenly. lieutenant was this which led him in 1860 to establish his great orphanage at Erdington, near Birmingham. Upon it he expended about \u00a3300,000, and for this munificent endowment he was knighted in 1872. He had previously given a dispensary to his native town and an almshouse to Erdington. In 1880 Mason College, since incorporated in the University of Birmingham, was opened. The total value of the endowment was about \u00a3250,000. In commemoration of him, his bust stands at the centre of the roundabout at the junction of Chester Road & Orphanage Road in Erdington (52531556\u00b0North 1825128\u00b0West\ufeff / 52531556. -1825128).

The caller, he then noted irritably, looked so insignificant. He had probably come to beg.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to be brief,\u201d the Rector snapped, \u201cas I\u2019m very busy. I have my sermon to prepare and correspondence to attend to . . . what was it, now?\u201d\n\nThe old man took no offence.\n\n\u201cI wondered whether I might have your advice. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes. No doubt you did, and you may have it within reasonable limits. But, as I\u2019ve told you, I cannot spare much time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted,\u201d continued the visitor, patiently, \u201cto give some money towards the building of an orphanage.\u201d\n\n\u201cA very laudable idea, I\u2019m sure,\u201d said the Rector, hardly treating the offer seriously, \u201cbut I can assure you that \u00a320 or \u00a350 wouldn\u2019t go very far.\u201d\n\n\u201cI quite realise that,\u201d said the visitor. \u201cI was thinking of giving \u00a3100,000.\u201d\n\nAt this point it was the parson\u2019s turn to feel uncomfortable.\n\nThen the conversation turned to what sort of orphanage to build, where to build it and how the orphans were to be chosen.\n\nThe parson was more concerned with the prestige of his church. He wanted the orphanage to admit only members of the Church of England, and for theological tuition to be based entirely on his church\u2019s teachings.\n\nJosiah Mason would have none of it. He was a mild-mannered man, but where principle was concerned, he wouldn\u2019t budge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the happiness and future of the children that counts,\u201d he insisted, \u201cand I don\u2019t care whether they\u2019re Jews or Catholics, or Anglicans or Hottentots. They need and deserve love and support, whatever they are.\u201d\n\nSo, leaving the parson fuming over his unfinished sermon, Mason departed to establish his own orphanage at Erdington, in a splendid building which could house in comfort three hundred children. It cost him \u00a360,000, and another \u00a3200,000 was invested to provide enough income to maintain the orphanage in perpetuity.\n\nThat was vastly more than the \u00a3100,000 Mason had originally intended to spend, but he liked giving money away for useful purposes. He himself lived simply, with absolutely no interest in luxury. Indeed, few people dreamed that he was wealthy. Yet this unassuming man not only founded one of the best orphanages in the country, but Birmingham University as well. His life is a model of what can be done if you have courage, a firm character, a capacity for hard work and a good heart.\n\nJosiah came of a poor but respectable family, and his childhood was hard. His father was a weaver in Kidderminster \u2013 a badly-paid trade \u2013 and at the age of eight Josiah was helping to swell the family income and support his crippled brother by selling pies and cakes in the street. He quite enjoyed the street life, and people admired the cheerful lad who never grumbled, although he was out for long hours in all weathers, in snow and rain, wind and cold, in his shabby clothes.\n\nHaving saved up enough, Josiah bought a donkey, which he called Admiral Rodney (after the famous British seaman) and sold fruit and vegetables. From then on, he had an astonishing variety of jobs and seems to have given satisfaction in them all. He worked for a shoemaker, in a bakery, as a carpenter, blacksmith, housepainter and carpet-weaver.\n\nHowever, Kidderminster\u2019s traditional trade of carpet-weaving did not appeal to him. He had seen too much of his family\u2019s poverty to want to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps, so he went to work for an uncle in Birmingham who made gilt toys. The uncle treated him badly, and after seven years, Josiah found himself unemployed.\n\nWhile he was wondering what to do next, chance made up his mind for him. He met a man called Harrison who made split rings (like those used to hold keys). He joined him, and when Harrison retired, he sold Mason the business for \u00ac\u00a3500. It was a small sum for such a thriving concern, but Harrison liked him.\n\nThe business continued to prosper, and Mason, who saved money carefully, looked around for profitable investments.\n\nAgain fate played into his hands. For centuries people had used goose quills for writing. Now, thanks to the industrial revolution and the increasing interest in the education of ordinary people, the amount of writing done \u2013 of accounts kept, letters written, records and documents prepared \u2013 had increased to vast proportions. If every goose in Britain had been robbed of its feathers, there wouldn\u2019t have been enough quills to go round!\n\nIn 1780, fifteen years before Josiah Mason was born, the split-ring manufacturer Samuel Harrison had made a steel pen for the famous scientist Dr. Joseph Priestley, and from 1803 onwards various makers of steel pens began to operate. Josiah Mason had seen Harrison\u2019s invention. In the 1820s, makers in London and Birmingham were trying to outdo each other in design, and when Mason bought some nibs made by Perry, a famous London stationer, he wrote to him pointing out their faults and suggesting improvements.\n\nAfter that, Mason made all Perry\u2019s nibs. They carried Perry\u2019s name and hardly anybody knew that Mason made them. For the same reason, they did not realise how wealthy Mason was becoming.\n\nIn 1829, Perry sold only thirty boxes of a gross of nibs each. Years later he was selling 32,000 gross a week and Josiah Mason, who made them all, was employing a thousand men in his factory. The nibs sold not only in Britain but all over the world.\n\nLater, Mason took an interest in electroplating, teaming up with the famous George Elkington of Birmingham and joining with him in the ownership of a copper-smelting works in South Wales. Mason was also one of the earliest town planners, for, to attract workpeople to the lonely Welsh site, he built houses and schools.\n\nTowards the end of his life, Mason, who was childless, remembered his early poverty and the frustrations he had suffered in being uneducated. The orphanage he founded was a kind of memorial to his crippled brother, whom he had loved and nursed.\n\nThen he thought of his great educational project.\n\nAt that time Birmingham, although a thriving industrial centre, was lagging behind Manchester and Liverpool in its educational facilities. Mason decided, therefore, to build a college entirely at his own expense.\n\nHis first intention was to make the college a sort of technical institution where people could learn the skills chiefly required in Birmingham; but then he agreed that it should become a more general college.\n\nAs in the case of his orphanage, however, Josiah Mason insisted that religion could not be made a condition of admittance. A person\u2019s religion, he insisted, was his private concern.\n\nDesigning the college and finding the land to build it on took a long time, but in due course the great Gothic building, somewhat like a cathedral in red brick, was completed. It was opened in 1879, on Josiah\u2019s eightieth birthday.\n\nThe project cost Mason \u00a3200,000, but it made him very happy to know that the city he loved, and in which by hard work and honesty he had made his fortune, had become an important provincial centre of learning.\n\nMason College became the nucleus around which grew the University of Birmingham. Today, as he fervently wished, the good work begun by the humble pie-pedlar still goes on."}, {"url": "https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/facilities/cadbury/archives/university/official.aspx", "page_content": "Official archives\n\nAt present, the vast majority of the official archives of the University are un-catalogued.

Josiah Mason came from Kidderminster but made his fortune after he moved to Birmingham in 1816. He was involved in many different trades, but he became extremely successful in the steel pen nib manufacturing industry. At that time, Birmingham was an important centre of metal working and industry, producing three quarters of the world\u2019s pen nibs amongst many other things. It was at this time that Birmingham became known as the \u2018Workshop of the World\u2019.\n\nThe original house was built within 70 acres of open countryside just south of Birmingham. The original building is within the part rendered and painted cream, where the main staircase and tiled floor is. This protective rendering was probably added because the brick was not of the highest quality. The custom at the time was to quarry the materials for bricks nearby and to produce one\u2019s own bricks on-site. The likelihood is that the quarry was then landscaped to form the lake in the woodland area. Over the years, parts of the estate were sold off to leave the ten acres we have today.\n\nIn his later life, Josiah Mason became a great philanthropist with endowments to found an orphanage in Erdington and a new college in Birmingham, Mason Science College which opened in 1880. Mason Science College was originally situated next to the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery in Chamberlain Square and was later incorporated into the University of Birmingham in 1900. Neville Chamberlain and Stanley Baldwin both studied at the college.\n\nJosiah Mason went into a business partnership with George Elkington (1801-1865), a Birmingham-born manufacturer who patented the first commercial electroplating process. Through their partnership, Elkington, Mason, & Co. produced tableware, jewellery and beautiful writing pens to Victorian high society and royalty. Many of their items can be seen at the V&A Museum in London.\n\nJosiah Mason sold Woodbrooke to George Elkington in 1839, who lived here with his wife Mary and seven children. They are recorded on the 1841 census as living here with three servants. Mary Elkington died in 1858 and was buried at St Mary\u2019s in Selly Oak where stained-glass windows were later installed to her memory. George himself died in 1865, with his eldest son Frederick continuing to live at Woodbrooke and run his father\u2019s successful silversmith business.\n\nIn 1881, Frederick Elkington sold Woodbrooke to another successful local businessman, George Cadbury. Before moving to Woodbrooke, George lived at 32 George Road in Edgbaston directly opposite the Edgbaston Quaker Meeting House. George had taken over his father\u2019s chocolate business along with his brother Richard in 1861. At the time, the Cadbury\u2019s had a factory on Bridge Street in the centre of Birmingham. Living conditions in the city were poor, with courtyard housing a common feature. The last remaining courtyard housing in Birmingham have been preserved by the National Trust as the \u2018Back to Backs\u2018, so called because houses would either face the street or a rear courtyard and would back onto one another.\n\nPerhaps influenced by the civic improvements of mayor Joseph Chamberlain in the 1870s, which saw swathes of slum clearances and improvements to living conditions, the Cadbury brothers made a decision to move their entire factory out of the city. Not only that, but they undertook the construction of new houses, schools and parks for its employees to enjoy. Construction of the new factory and village started in 1878, with the area eventually being called \u2018Bournville\u2019 after the small river Bourne that runs through it. Needing to be closer to the new factory, George moved to Woodbrooke in 1881 and lived here until 1894 when he moved to the Manor House nearby in Northfield.\n\nThe Woodbrooke Settlement\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, there was a growing sentiment to discuss traditional religious beliefs and how they may respond with the changing beliefs of younger generations within the Religious Society of Friends (known as Quakers). After the 1895 Manchester Conference, a movement within the Society began to organise summer schools that were to be both recreational and educational; the summer schools became opportunities where knowledge and experience could be shared through joint worship, creativity and relaxation.\n\nJohn Wilhelm Rowntree (1868 \u2013 1905) was a vocal proponent of having a more permanent home (\u2018settlement\u2019) for the summer schools, convincing George Cadbury to allow Woodbrooke to be used as an initial experiment. The first students arrived in 1903.\n\nWoodbrooke\u2019s original trust deed specifies how it is to function and that its role is to allow Quakers and others:\n\nto receive instruction with regard to the Christian religion, especially as it bears upon the doctrines held by the members of the Society of Friends and in connection therewith receive and enjoy the benefit of practical training and experience in Christian work especially.\n\nstudy social and economic questions.\n\nstudy the classics and theological and philosophical and other branches of learning\n\nreceive the benefit of spiritual and intellectual culture and intercourse or do any one or more of these things.\n\nIt was to a short course that Woodbrooke first opened its doors as a study centre for Friends. In the summer of 1903 six one-week courses were held in succession, attended by some 300 Friends altogether. Rufus Jones gave the opening lecture on \u2018Present Day Ideas of God and the Spiritual Life\u2019. The charge was 35/- per week. It was noted that \u2018cycle accommodation for about 50 machines will be provided, and an attendant will be on duty to make small repairs at a moderate fee\u2019.\n\nWoodbrooke became an important part of the Quaker landscape in Birmingham, already well established with the Cadbury factory around the corner and several Friends Meeting Houses within walking distance. Woodbrooke built links with Birmingham University, offering a number of social work courses through the university, and forged even stronger connections through being the founder college in what became the Selly Oak Colleges Federation.Woodbrooke\u2019s history is intertwined with the dynamic ecumenical spirit that pervaded the Selly Oak Colleges and made them such an attraction to progressive theologians and thinkers from across the denominations and around the world.\n\nBecause Woodbrooke was not formally affiliated to other Quaker organisations there was some suspicion that these young pioneers might turn into something of a liability. \u2018I think we had a certain sense that Woodbrooke was somehow \u201con trial\u2019\u2019,\u2019 recalls Ethel Heath, a student in the earliest years, \u2018and that we were helping to create precedents and to make history, even though it might be on a very small scale.\u2019\n\nInternational and ecumenical links\n\nVisitors from abroad were an important part of Woodbrooke\u2019s history right from the start. Relationships were made with people from around the British Empire and these would become more and more meaningful as Quakers and those struggling for independence in India, Kenya and other colonies found much in common when they met at Woodbrooke.\n\nRendel Harris, the first Director of Studies, was resolved that Woodbrooke should not be an introverted Quaker institution. Neither the staff nor the students should be recruited exclusively from the Society of Friends. So long as they were sympathetic to Quaker beliefs, he would engage the best available scholars for the teaching posts at Woodbrooke, whatever their denomination.\n\nFirst World War\n\nQuakers have long upheld a testimony to peace, opposing all war. Many, however, experienced great inner conflict during the First World War, feeling that in this instance it was right to enlist and serve as soldiers. The variety of moral stances taken by Quakers was something Woodbrooke, as a community, had to contend with. It supported both conscientious objectors and uniformed men who visited or temporarily made their homes here. \u2018It was strange how different avenues of service opened out for Woodbrooke year after year,\u2019 remembers H. G.Wood of the war years. \u2018It was part of a true catholicity, that we could shelter conscientious objectors, prepare men for alternative service and make a Christian gentleman like Arthur Bisseker, who felt it to be his duty to join up, feel welcome when he appeared amongst us in khaki. I like to discover in the same pigeonhole a letter from a conscientious objector under arrest and another from James Cunnison in training.\u2019 Wood himself, whilst Director of Studies, spent four months with the Friends Ambulance Unit in France. Local eyebrows were sometimes raised at the assortment of people living here. The police maintained a close watch on the conscientious objectors whom they had to arrest from time to time. Wood remembers a not untypical kindness when \u2018the Warden met a police officer coming down the drive about 10 am and said, \u201cI suppose you are coming for one of my young men?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d he answered and mentioned the name of the man he had come to arrest. \u201cOh,\u201d said the Warden, \u201che left two hours ago in order to get married.\u201d \u201cDid he now,\u201d said the officer, \u201clet him enjoy himself, I\u2019ll call again in a week\u2019s time.\u201d\u2019\n\nAfter the First World War\n\nThe return to civilian life was not always smooth for men and women who had been profoundly changed by their experience.William Wilson wrote wryly of the 1919 student intake remarking that \u2018freedom was the watchword \u2013 freedom apparently from everything! These devotees of freedom, in their zeal to have something to be freed from, were driven to demand that even minor rules should be debated and that the student body decide what was to be taught and who was to teach it.\u2019 A weekly student meeting (nicknamed the \u2018Soviet\u2019) resulted from this campaign. Later students did not always agree and eventually the older organisational structure prevailed, with the addition of a Woodbrooke house meeting.\n\nWoodbrooke during the 1930s\n\nWoodbrooke deepened its international connections throughout the 1930s, building on previous contacts abroad and making new ones. Horace Alexander, an expert in international relations as well as a forward thinking conservationist and ornithologist, was a lecturer at Woodbrooke. His international work brought him into contact with Mahatma Gandhi, of whom he became an admirer and friend. When Gandhi visited this country in 1931 he came to Woodbrooke where he was welcomed by the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress of the city, the Bishop of Birmingham and Midlands-based Indians alongside the entire Woodbrooke community. An eye witness recorded in the logbook \u2018The common-room was crammed with people. Gandhi began his speech by telling why he had come to Woodbrooke. It was not a matter of business; it was a pilgrimage of gratitude. Last year, at a time when Gandhi and other principal leaders were in prison,Woodbrooke had spared Professor Alexander that he might go to India and study the situation. All news about the civil resistors was censored, and India needed more than ever a friend who would give the English people a true picture of their plight.\u2019 That evening, in a more relaxed atmosphere, skills were shared when \u2018Mr Alexander brought down his Indian spinning wheel, and tried to transmit his knowledge of this noble art to other Woodbrookers \u2013 but with little success. Mr Desai preferred an exchange lesson; he taught spinning, and in return was taught knitting.\u2019\n\nSecond World War\n\nOpinions amongst the Quaker community were again divided over the war. Amongst Quakers the horror of the Holocaust made Second World War a profound test of their pacifism. During these years Woodbrooke again welcomed refugees, conscientious objectors and others who were stranded unable to get home. Even so, harmony was maintained and unusual friendships were formed. \u2018\u2026 a striking instance of the breaking down of barriers, was that of a French girl who came with a well founded detestation of Germans, for she had directly suffered from the invasion of France. She became abosom friend of a German girl. Many similar instances occurred. \u2026 scarcely anyone can have a term at Woodbrooke without coming to see that we all belong together and must be friends of one another.\u2019\n\nThe police would arrive periodically about midnight to be sure that all the enemy aliens (who were not allowed to be away for a night without a permit) were on the premises. All had to be awakened and brought downstairs. \u2018It was a little weird, in the half-lighted hall, to see the trim, uniformed, British police officers, checking on their list the circle of sleepy-eyed, slightly dishevelled aliens in their heterogeneous night clothes,\u2019 recalls Edith Richards who lived here at the time. Around Christmas 1940 the chalet building became home to four evacuated Birmingham families who \u2018settled in so well that they would like to have stayed \u201cfor the duration\u201d!\u2019 Woodbrooke suffered some bomb damage but none of the structure of the building was harmed. Air raids sent the Woodbrooke community into the cellars for safety, where knitting and other useful work was sometimes put aside to make time for parties, keeping up everyone\u2019s spirits.\n\nThe aftermath of the Second World War\n\nAs Hugh Doncaster recalled, \u2018some of the tensions of the war years reappeared after the close of the war. The emotional strain for some was great indeed and the searching and cleansing experience of reconciliation, slowly but surely achieved, was something in which the whole community shared. Many of our students came with spirits torn by\n\nthe ruthlessness of men: some who had lived for twelve years in Germany in opposition to Nazi ideals and practice and had suffered accordingly; some who had gone partly with the tide and been cruelly disillusioned; some who had undergone the horrors of concentration camps or lost their loved ones at the hands of brutal men. In the personal friendships of this community, in the search for enduring truth, and above all in the quiet of our daily worship, we were privileged to witness miracles of healing term by term.\u2019"}]}
