Every page goes through several hundred of perfecting techniques; in live mode. Quite the same Wikipedia. Just better.\n\nCanadian politician\n\nGordon \"Gordie\" Hogg (born August 24, 1946) is a Canadian politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for South Surrey\u2014White Rock in the House of Commons of Canada from 2017 to 2019, as a member of the Liberal Party of Canada. He previously represented Surrey-White Rock in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 1997 to 2017 as part of the British Columbia Liberal Party caucus, serving in several cabinet positions under Premier Gordon Campbell during that time, and was the mayor of White Rock, British Columbia from 1984 to 1993.\n\nBackground\n\nHogg was born in Victoria to Kathleen and Dr. Allan Hogg, a prominent physician in White Rock, who was instrumental in establishing the first White Rock Hospital in 1954, and is the oldest of four children. Dr. Hogg went on to deliver more than 1,100 children during his time in the community, with a wing of the Peace Arch Hospital named in his honour.[1][2]\n\nWhile attending the University of British Columbia (UBC), Hogg was a two-sport athlete, playing football and basketball, including winning the National Junior Men\u2019s Basketball Championship in 1967.[3] He graduated from UBC with a bachelor of arts in sociology and psychology, and from Antioch College with a master's degree in psychology.[4][5]\n\nHogg began coaching baseball in the community in his teens. He was asked to go before White Rock City Council to request support for the team to go to Edmonton for the championships. Upon returning home, Hogg said that he thought the whole thing had been pointless, to which his mother replied \u201cSon, I hoped I\u2019d always raised you to be the kind of person that if you didn\u2019t like something, you wouldn\u2019t complain about it, but you\u2019d get involved and try and make a difference.\u201d Hogg has said that this is what led him to run for politics, first at the municipal level, then provincially and federally.[2][6]\n\nHe had worked for the Salvation Army's House of Concord as a probation officer, and the British Columbia corrections service as a regional director.[2][7] In 1996, while working as director of the Burnaby Youth Custody Centre, he established Night Hoops, a nighttime basketball program for at-risk youth to help reduce recidivism and other related issues.[8]\n\nHogg and his wife LaVerne have one son, Blair. They were also foster parents and billet parents for the Surrey Eagles hockey team. He had served on the board of organizations such as Peace Arch Hospital and the Peace Arch Community Health Council.[5]\n\nPolitical career\n\nMunicipal\n\nHogg was elected in 1974 as alderman for the City of White Rock, serving in that role from 1975 to 1983.[9][10] He was then elected the city's mayor in 1984, serving until 1993.[9][10] During his tenure as mayor, Hogg oversaw the development of the White Rock Promenade along the waterfront,[2] as well as the repurposing of the old train station into the White Rock Museum and Archives.\n\nProvincial\n\nWith incumbent Surrey-White Rock member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Wilf Hurd resigning to run in the 1997 federal election, Hogg was approached by the British Columbia Liberal Party to contest the riding's by-election.[11] He was elected to the British Columbia Legislative Assembly at the 1997 by-election,[5][12] and held the seat for twenty years. While the Liberals were in opposition, Hogg served as critic for education and human resources.[5] He shared an apartment in Victoria with Geoff Plant and party leader Gordon Campbell during that time.[13]\n\nWhen the Liberals formed government following the 2001 provincial election, Hogg was appointed Minister of Children and Family Development by Premier Campbell.[5][14] He was forced to resign from that role in January 2004 during an investigation into the ministry's spending;[15] an audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers concluded there was no evidence of fraud or misappropriation of the ministry's funds.[16][17]\n\nHe re-entered the cabinet in August 2006 to serve as Minister of State for ActNow BC, a provincial initiative to promote healthy living.[17] He then served as Minister of State for Mining from June 2008 until being replaced by Randy Hawes in June 2009.[14] He was subsequently named Parliamentary Secretary for Social Entrepreneurship.[18]\n\nHogg was chosen as government caucus chair by fellow Liberal MLAs in July 2011, replacing the outgoing Ron Cantelon.[19] He was also named Parliamentary Secretary for Non-Profit Partnerships by Premier Christy Clark in September 2011,[20] before being reassigned to the role of Parliamentary Secretary for Youth Sport in September 2015.[21]\n\nHogg announced in October 2016 that he would not seek re-election in 2017.[7] The BC Liberals chose Tracy Redies, former CEO of Coast Capital Savings, as the next candidate for the riding.[22]\n\nFederal\n\nHogg first ran for federal office under the federal Liberal banner in the riding of Surrey\u2014White Rock\u2014South Langley in 1993, placing second behind Reform candidate Val Meredith.[23]\n\nIn 2017, Hogg was selected as the Liberal candidate for the South Surrey\u2014White Rock by-election, resulting from the resignation of incumbent Conservative MP Dianne Watts.[24] Hogg defeated former cabinet minister and former MP from neighbouring Delta\u2014Richmond East, Conservative candidate Kerry-Lynne Findlay, in the by-election. This marked the first time a Liberal had won the riding since the 1940s, when it included all of Surrey, and most of New Westminster.[25] On March 21, 2018, Hogg was elected as chair of the Federal Liberal Pacific Caucus.[26] He sat on the House of Commons Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, and the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage.[9]\n\nHogg lost the seat to Findlay in the 2019 federal election;[27] he was defeated by Findlay again in 2021.[28]\n\nRecent activities\n\nAt the age of 70, while working as an MLA, Hogg completed an interdisciplinary doctorate that focused on public policy from Simon Fraser University (SFU).[29] He was subsequently named an adjunct professor in criminology at SFU in 2017.[4][7]\n\nHe ran for mayor of Surrey in the 2022 municipal election as part of the Surrey First slate,[28][30] finishing third behind winner Brenda Locke and incumbent Doug McCallum.[31]\n\nElectoral record\n\nFederal\n\n\n\n\n\nProvincial\n\nB.C.

By September 1791, the Assembly had completed most of the work for which it was convened. Its deputies had drafted a constitution they believed reflected the aims of the revolution. Feudalism, noble titles and the Ancien R\u00e9gime\u2019s other institutional inequalities had been abolished. The idealistic Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen was drafted and adopted as a preamble to the new constitution. Royal absolutism was dead and the king had been stripped of most of his executive powers.\n\nA new legislature In late September 1791, Louis XVI gave his assent to the new constitution, pledging to \u201cmaintain it at home, defend it abroad and cause its execution by all the means at my disposal\u201d. Its mission complete, the National Constituent Assembly voted for its own dissolution and handed national government to the Legislative Assembly. To an outsider unaware of earlier events, the French Revolution would have appeared to be drawing to a close. France\u2019s transition from absolutist monarchy to constitutional government appeared complete. Idealistic politicians certainly viewed the handing of power to the Legislative Assembly with optimism. This transition gave the nation a fresh start from the rising tensions and violence of 1791. Many believed the king had finally accepted constitutional change and hoped his earlier intransigence would be forgotten. Writing at the time, the Marquis de Ferrieres suggested that \u201cthe king and queen appear entirely in favour of the constitution \u2013 and they are wise to do so\u2026 The people are delirious. The king and queen are acclaimed the moment they appear. So, you see, everything points to a solid new order of affairs.\u201d Other Monarchiens (constitutional monarchists) expressed sentiments that were equally as hopeful.\n\nThe recalcitrant king Republicans and political realists had a dimmer view of the situation. The constitution had been enacted but its head of state was a prisoner of the state, following his failed attempt to flee Paris in June 1791. France was now a constitutional monarchy but its monarch was reluctant, untrustworthy and unpopular. The king, who was shiftless, uncertain and difficult to pin down on political questions, expressed little personal faith in the constitution. In a conversation with the royalist politician Bertrand de Molleville, Louis XVI described the constitution as \u201cfar from a masterpiece\u201d. \u201cI think it has some great defects,\u201d he told Molleville, \u201cbut I have sworn to maintain it, warts and all\u2026 Executing the Constitution in its literal terms is the best way of making the nation see the alterations that it needs.\u201d This passage suggests the Legislative Assembly faced a king who was bent on constitutional sabotage. To compound the problem of executive leadership, the new Legislative Assembly was itself neither representative nor experienced. It was elected by \u2018active citizens\u2019: those affluent enough to pay a sizeable amount in taxation. Most working-class citizens were not entitled to cast a vote for the new legislature. This exclusion outraged the radical sections and democrats in the Jacobin club, many of whom favoured universal suffrage.\n\nThe \u2018self-denying ordinance\u2019 The Legislative Assembly was also hampered by the self-denying ordinance, a regulation proposed by Maximilien Robespierre and passed by the National Constituent Assembly on May 16th 1791. The self-denying ordinance forbade all sitting members of the National Constituent Assembly from standing as candidates for the Legislative Assembly. Robespierre\u2019s ordinance was intended as an act of political self-sacrifice, to renew government and prevent any entrenchment of power in the new assembly. A small number of deputies opposed it, arguing that replacing the entire legislature would jeopardise the stability of the government.\n\nNew personnel Elections for the Legislative Assembly were held in September 1791. Most of the 745 deputies elected to the Legislative Assembly had a record in provincial or municipal government or the public service. Many were members of the Cercle Social and the Jacobin Club who had not won seats in the National Constituent Assembly. Among those to take a seat in the Legislative Assembly were Jacques Brissot, the Marquis de Condorcet, the Republican lawyer Pierre Vergniaud, the Jacobin merchant Pierre Cambon and Georges Couthon, an ally of Robespierre. Because the constitution kept \u2018passive voters\u2019 at arm\u2019s length, the vast majority of deputies came from the middle classes. Almost half of them (330 deputies) were Republicans, while around one quarter (165) were Feuillant constitutional monarchists and the rest (250) were politically unaligned.\n\nThe rise of Brissot In the first weeks of the Assembly, deputies gravitated around prominent leaders and developed into factions. The largest of these factions was led by the imposing figure of Jacques Brissot. A lawyer turned political journalist, Brissot had acquired a reputation as a man of letters dedicated to the revolution. Before his election to the Legislative Assembly, Brissot sat in the Paris Commune and delivered several powerful speeches to the Jacobin club. He was also well travelled and had many contacts abroad, skills that prompted Brissot\u2019s appointment to the Assembly\u2019s diplomatic committee. Brissot was considered a radical in 1789 when he occupied the centre-left of the Legislative Assembly. He was a moderate Republican who wanted to abolish the monarchy and the 1791 constitution. He was also in favour of war with France\u2019s European neighbours: to bring about the collapse of the French monarchy, to export revolutionary ideas and to threaten monarchies elsewhere. Brissot\u2019s large contingent of followers came to be known as the Brissotins, the Girondins (many hailed from the Gironde d\u00e9partement) or the Rolandists (their leaders frequented the salon of Madame Roland)."}]}
