He received both his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees from Harvard University, where he earned All-America honors as a goaltender and was twice named to the All-Ivy League First Team (1974-75, 1976-77). In 1977, he was named the \u201cMost Valuable Player of the Beanpot\u201d, one of college hockey\u2019s most prestigious tournaments. In October 1998, he was inducted into the Harvard University Athletic Hall of Fame. Steveo and Petrovek talked about how old they were when they both started playing hockey.\n\nPetrovek, who played youth hockey in the greater Boston area, was one of four goaltenders invited to the final U.S. Olympic Team Trials Camp in 1976. He was drafted by both the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League and the Edmonton Oilers of the World Hockey Association in 1975.\n\nPetrovek joined as a Managing Owner and CEO of Portland Pirates LLC during the summer of 2000. Petrovek came to the Pirates after working the previous seven years with USA Hockey, Inc. and The USA Hockey Foundation in Colorado Springs, Colorado.\n\nAs Managing Owner and CEO, Petrovek oversaw the short and long term needs of the business, represents the franchise as an alternate governor at the League level, and participates regularly as a member of various league committees. He took the lead role in developing the Pirates\u2019 winning bids for the 2003 Dodge AHL All-Star Classic and the 2010 Time Warner Cable AHL All-Star Classic joining Rochester, Hershey and Providence as the only cities to host more than one AHL All-Star event in the league\u2019s history. Petrovek told Stevoe that he feels fortunate to have stayed in athletics after playing hockey for Harvard.\n\nLocally, Petrovek has served as Board Chair of the United Way of Greater Portland (2007-2009), was a member of the United Way\u2019s Annual Campaign Cabinet since 2001-2010, and Chaired the 2004 United Way Annual Campaign.

From an initial meeting with Larry and Darcy last fall and our follow-up with Chief Operating Officer Dan DiPofi, we knew this would be a great fit for our fans and our business, one that we expect will bring exciting, championship caliber performances on the ice for years to come, along with a deeply rooted commitment to our community off the ice as well. Today\u2019s announcement represents another important building block in our growth and commitment to professional hockey in Maine,\u201d said Petrovek and Bullard in a joint statement.\n\n\n\nBefore teaming up with the Pirates, the Sabres were affiliated with the Rochester Americans for 29 seasons, the longest such partnership in professional hockey between an NHL team and its AHL affiliate. During that span, Rochester had a record of 1,137-932-238-13 in 2,320 regular season games (.593 winning percentage) and made the playoffs 24 out of the 29 seasons. The team won its Division title eight times, advanced to the Calder Cup Finals six times, winning the Calder Cup three of those years in 1983, 1987 and 1996. A number of current Sabres players, including Thomas Vanek, Derek Roy,\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are excited to begin our AHL affiliation with the Portland Pirates and the city of Portland,\u201d said Buffalo Sabres Managing Partner Larry Quinn. \u201cI am looking forward to working with Lyman Bullard, Brian Petrovek and Brian Williams, and the entire Pirates organization. I have been impressed with their professionalism from day one and am excited to build our new relationship both personally and professionally.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is a rich history of professional hockey in Portland and we hope to add to that winning tradition,\u201d said Sabres General Manager Darcy Regier. \u201cDuring our tenure with our previous AHL affiliation, our franchise model was to draft and to develop young prospects and build our success from a core group within. With our current roster of players like Jason Pominville,\n\n\n\nThe NHL officially came to Buffalo on Dec. 2, 1969, as part of a two-team expansion, when the league awarded Seymour and Northrup Knox the franchise that would soon be named \u201cSabres.\u201d They chose center Gilbert Perreault as their first draft pick in 1970, after being awarded the number one selection. He, along with wingers Rene Robert and Rick Martin, became known as \u201cThe French Connection\u201d and led the Sabres to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1975, only five seasons after the team\u2019s inception. The team had continued success and made the playoffs for the next ten seasons, five of which where under Hall of Fame coach Scotty Bowman (\u201879-\u201880, \u201881-\u201885). The team experienced great success again in the mid-90s, going through a number of changes in the 1996-97 season. Founder Seymour H. Knox passed away in the spring of 1996 just as the Sabres donned new uniform colors and moved from the storied Memorial Auditorium into the new HSBC Arena where they went on to capture the Northeast Division title. Lindy Ruff, a former Sabres defenseman and left wing, was named head coach at the beginning of the next season and led the team to the Eastern Conference Finals. The team\u2019s success carried over to the 1998-1999 season when the Sabres made the Stanley Cup Finals where they lost to the Dallas Stars in six games.\n\n\n\nTom Golisano brought stability and a renewed excitement to the team when he purchased it in March, 2003. Following the NHL lockout, the Sabres returned to exceed all expectations by recording 52 wins and reaching the Eastern Conference Finals, earning Ruff a Jack Adams Trophy for Coach of the Year. The next season proved to be even better, as the Sabres won a franchise-record 53 games and earned the President\u2019s Trophy in front of 41 sell-out crowds in the regular season. They also sold out the nine home playoff games on their way to the Conference Finals, making it the first time since 1979-80 that every game was played in front of a sold-out crowd. This success on and off the ice earned the organization a nomination for \u201cProfessional Sports Team of the Year\u201d from the Sports Business Journal and Sports Business Daily.\n\n\n\nBuffalo becomes the third NHL affiliate in Pirates history. During its five-year affiliation with the Washington Capitals (2000-2005), the Pirates compiled a .535 regular-season winning percentage and made the playoffs three out of the five seasons. During their three-year affiliation with the Anaheim Ducks (2005-2008), the Pirates compiled a .563 regular-season winning percentage and made two Calder Cup playoff appearances, losing in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals in both the 2005-06 and 2007-08 seasons. During that time, the Pirates averaged close to 5,000 fans per game and attendance grew by over 15 percent. With their NHL affiliate closer geographically, Portland hopes that its fans will invest in the success of the Sabres and the rivalry between the Boston/Providence Bruins will intensify. Pirates fans will be able to watch the Sabres play divisional opponent Boston six times during the NHL\u2019s regular season, giving fans a closer look at their new NHL affiliate.\n\n\n\nThe new long-term agreement between the Pirates and the Buffalo Sabres guarantees professional hockey in the city of Portland through 2011. Since the Maine Mariners inaugural season in 1977, over 1,000 games have been played in front of over 3 million fans at the American Hockey League level. The AHL is the top development league for the National Hockey League and will be celebrating its 73rd season of play next season. Dating back to the days of the Maine Mariners, the American Hockey League has now played hockey in Portland for over 30 years. Only five other teams (Hershey, Rochester, Providence, Springfield and Cleveland) have had an American Hockey League franchise in their city longer than Portland. The Cumberland County Civic Center, the Pirates\u2019 home, has hosted four Calder Cup Champions in 1978, 1979, 1984 and 1994 and the 2003 Dodge AHL All-Star Classic, one of the most successful in league history. \u201cThis is an exciting day for fans of hockey throughout our state to partner with an eastern US city with one of the richest histories in professional hockey dating back to the turn of the century.

From an initial meeting with Larry and Darcy last fall and our follow-up with Chief Operating Officer Dan DiPofi, we knew this would be a great fit for our fans and our business, one that we expect will bring exciting, championship caliber performances on the ice for years to come, along with a deeply rooted commitment to our community off the ice as well. Today\u2019s announcement represents another important building block in our growth and commitment to professional hockey in Maine,\u201d said Petrovek and Bullard in a joint statement.\n\n\n\nBefore teaming up with the Pirates, the Sabres were affiliated with the Rochester Americans for 29 seasons, the longest such partnership in professional hockey between an NHL team and its AHL affiliate. During that span, Rochester had a record of 1,137-932-238-13 in 2,320 regular season games (.593 winning percentage) and made the playoffs 24 out of the 29 seasons. The team won its Division title eight times, advanced to the Calder Cup Finals six times, winning the Calder Cup three of those years in 1983, 1987 and 1996. A number of current Sabres players, including Thomas Vanek, Derek Roy,\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are excited to begin our AHL affiliation with the Portland Pirates and the city of Portland,\u201d said Buffalo Sabres Managing Partner Larry Quinn. \u201cI am looking forward to working with Lyman Bullard, Brian Petrovek and Brian Williams, and the entire Pirates organization. I have been impressed with their professionalism from day one and am excited to build our new relationship both personally and professionally.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is a rich history of professional hockey in Portland and we hope to add to that winning tradition,\u201d said Sabres General Manager Darcy Regier. \u201cDuring our tenure with our previous AHL affiliation, our franchise model was to draft and to develop young prospects and build our success from a core group within. With our current roster of players like Jason Pominville,\n\n\n\nThe NHL officially came to Buffalo on Dec. 2, 1969, as part of a two-team expansion, when the league awarded Seymour and Northrup Knox the franchise that would soon be named \u201cSabres.\u201d They chose center Gilbert Perreault as their first draft pick in 1970, after being awarded the number one selection. He, along with wingers Rene Robert and Rick Martin, became known as \u201cThe French Connection\u201d and led the Sabres to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1975, only five seasons after the team\u2019s inception. The team had continued success and made the playoffs for the next ten seasons, five of which where under Hall of Fame coach Scotty Bowman (\u201879-\u201880, \u201881-\u201885). The team experienced great success again in the mid-90s, going through a number of changes in the 1996-97 season. Founder Seymour H. Knox passed away in the spring of 1996 just as the Sabres donned new uniform colors and moved from the storied Memorial Auditorium into the new HSBC Arena where they went on to capture the Northeast Division title. Lindy Ruff, a former Sabres defenseman and left wing, was named head coach at the beginning of the next season and led the team to the Eastern Conference Finals. The team\u2019s success carried over to the 1998-1999 season when the Sabres made the Stanley Cup Finals where they lost to the Dallas Stars in six games.\n\n\n\nTom Golisano brought stability and a renewed excitement to the team when he purchased it in March, 2003. Following the NHL lockout, the Sabres returned to exceed all expectations by recording 52 wins and reaching the Eastern Conference Finals, earning Ruff a Jack Adams Trophy for Coach of the Year. The next season proved to be even better, as the Sabres won a franchise-record 53 games and earned the President\u2019s Trophy in front of 41 sell-out crowds in the regular season. They also sold out the nine home playoff games on their way to the Conference Finals, making it the first time since 1979-80 that every game was played in front of a sold-out crowd. This success on and off the ice earned the organization a nomination for \u201cProfessional Sports Team of the Year\u201d from the Sports Business Journal and Sports Business Daily.\n\n\n\nBuffalo becomes the third NHL affiliate in Pirates history. During its five-year affiliation with the Washington Capitals (2000-2005), the Pirates compiled a .535 regular-season winning percentage and made the playoffs three out of the five seasons. During their three-year affiliation with the Anaheim Ducks (2005-2008), the Pirates compiled a .563 regular-season winning percentage and made two Calder Cup playoff appearances, losing in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals in both the 2005-06 and 2007-08 seasons. During that time, the Pirates averaged close to 5,000 fans per game and attendance grew by over 15 percent. With their NHL affiliate closer geographically, Portland hopes that its fans will invest in the success of the Sabres and the rivalry between the Boston/Providence Bruins will intensify. Pirates fans will be able to watch the Sabres play divisional opponent Boston six times during the NHL\u2019s regular season, giving fans a closer look at their new NHL affiliate.\n\n\n\nThe new long-term agreement between the Pirates and the Buffalo Sabres guarantees professional hockey in the city of Portland through 2011. Since the Maine Mariners inaugural season in 1977, over 1,000 games have been played in front of over 3 million fans at the American Hockey League level. The AHL is the top development league for the National Hockey League and will be celebrating its 73rd season of play next season. Dating back to the days of the Maine Mariners, the American Hockey League has now played hockey in Portland for over 30 years. Only five other teams (Hershey, Rochester, Providence, Springfield and Cleveland) have had an American Hockey League franchise in their city longer than Portland. The Cumberland County Civic Center, the Pirates\u2019 home, has hosted four Calder Cup Champions in 1978, 1979, 1984 and 1994 and the 2003 Dodge AHL All-Star Classic, one of the most successful in league history. \u201cThis is an exciting day for fans of hockey throughout our state to partner with an eastern US city with one of the richest histories in professional hockey dating back to the turn of the century.

Bullard remained the majority owner until this winter, when Ron Cain increased his stake in the team and, shortly thereafter, took over CEO duties from Petrovek, who remained president of business development.\n\nChurch said he believes Petrovek retains his ownership stake. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not an owner,\u201d Church said, \u201cso I don\u2019t know for sure.\u201d\n\nCalls to Petrovek, Cain and Bullard were not returned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in a prepared statement, Petrovek said, \u201cMy decision allows Ron to steer the ship on his own course and begin a new journey for the brand and our fans and sponsors as the team prepares for the 2014-15 season.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Cain thanked Petrovek for his service.\n\n\u201cBrian is at the top of his game,\u201d Cain said. \u201cOur loss will be another\u2019s gain.\u201d\n\nCain lauded Petrovek\u2019s success in attracting the AHL all-star game to Portland in 2003 and 2010 and his involvement in civic and charitable organizations. Petrovek has served on the boards of Maine Medical Center, the United Way of Greater Portland and Portland\u2019s Downtown District.\n\nPetrovek was also the face and voice of the team\u2019s difficult and extended lease negotiations with trustees of the Cumberland County Civic Center in 2003, 2010 and 2013. \u201cWe\u2019ll give it three more years,\u201d he said after grudgingly signing a 2003 agreement. \u201cWe will not play in the building three years from now unless it has been renovated or the economic terms are different.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Petrovek flirted with moving the franchise to Albany, N.Y., before agreeing to a two-year extension. After voters approved a $33 million bond in 2011 to renovate the civic center, its trustees reached an agreement with the Pirates on a one-year lease with an eye toward a longer-term deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch a deal, which seemed to be imminent in April 2013, fell apart in August. In September, the team filed a lawsuit and then announced that its entire 38-game home schedule would be played at the Androscoggin Bank Colisee in Lewiston.\n\n\u201cWith any sports team, there\u2019s a certain amount of friction around the guy who\u2019s the face of the organization,\u201d said Chris Hall, CEO of the Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce. \u201cCertainly, the last year and a half has been difficult, but people should reflect on all the good years and the contributions. The city of Portland is well known as a great minor-league sports town. Well, one of the reasons is because of people like Brian Petrovek.\u201d\n\nThe first few months in Lewiston included three sellouts and an average attendance of more than 2,600 fans.

His blood-alcohol content was measured at three times the legal limit for driving.\n\n\u201cWhat his legacy will be, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Church. \u201cMy hope is that people look at the big picture and recognize all the good that has come with his leadership of the organization.\u201d\n\nIn another, unrelated change, the Pirates lost their general manager Monday when Brad Treliving, former assistant GM of their parent NHL club, the Phoenix Coyotes, was hired as GM of the NHL\u2019s Calgary Flames.\n\nGlenn Jordan can be contacted at 791-6425 or at:\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: GlennJordanPPH"}, {"url": "https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1975/1/9/petro-confidence-in-crimson-crease-pwhy/", "page_content": "Why? Why would you ever want to be a hockey goalie? A chuckle, and then a shake of the head. A friend and teammate rallies to his aid, \"He can't skate--that's why he's the goalie.\"\n\nAnother laugh and then Brian Petrovek, Harvard goaltender and Eastern college hockey's top netminder, assumes a more serious manner.\n\n\"I grew up in a hockey family in a hockey town (Norwood, Mass.) with a brother who just happened to be a goalie,\" he said. \"It was just natural for me to follow him. I started out as a goalie, and believe me--I wouldn't want to be anything else.\"\n\nPetrovek arrived at Harvard through the grace of an unlikely character, former B.U. head coach Jack Kelly. He had originally gone to Hotchkiss at the suggestion of Kelly, a close family friend.\n\nWhen Kelly graduated into the big leagues as the coach of the New England Whalers, he suggested that Brian shoot for Harvard rather than B.U. Needless to stay, Petro scored.\n\nAs goaltender for the Yardling squad last year, Petrovek was frustrated. Although the squad posted a strong 14-4 record, he didn't find the competition keen enough to sharpen his play.\n\nPetrovek spent last summer working at a hockey camp. When he returned this fall he was determined to take over the starting goalie position, a position many felt kept the Crimson from winning the national championship last spring.\n\nPetro exudes this determination and confidence when he talks about Harvard's chances this season.\n\n\"I think we should win it all this year and I'm going to be sure that I'm not the reason that Harvard isn't the national champion come March,\" he said.\n\nPetrovek is a low-keyed individual. The heckling and antics of rowdy fans and the rough emotional intensity of the game do not faze him. He writes it all off as being part of the game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe says he feels that the collegiate rule imposing a game's suspension for fighting promotes a lot of cheap shots.\n\nIf the rule was eliminated, a player could let out his frustration in fight rather than resorting to the potentially more damaging buttends and slashes that are now found in the game.\n\n\"A Physical Game\"\n\n\"Hockey's a physical game, and it seems artificial to have such a rule. The NHL has successfully contained fighting in that league, and I feel college hockey could do so also.\"\n\nIt's hard for Petrovek to divorce his hockey life from his role as a student. He's majoring in history mostly from an interest cultivated from travel as a hockey player.\n\nPetro's career interests don't take him far from the rink either. He would like to have a shot at the pros, but right now his concentration is centered on this Friday's showdown with Ivy league challenger Cornell.\n\nPetrovek is as concerned with the Ivy title as with the Nationals: \"Cornell will be the biggest game of the year for us. The squad is very league-minded.\"\n\nPetro continued, \"I'll go through my preparation very carefully. I'm very superstitious. Thursday night I'll go walking through the Yard and then up by Radcliffe. A goalie's lonely job, and I have to get prepared individually.\n\n\"Friday morning I'll have breakfast at Pewter Pot and then walk my particular route to the training meal. And my black turtleneck, I almost forgot. I don't think I'd play without it.\"\n\nUnless Cornell can successfully sabotage one black turtleneck, the Big Red will see a lot of their scoring drives turned away by number 26.

But such a challenge usually comes with a price--defeat.\n\nSometimes the challenge will come from outside national boundaries. The Harvard women's lacrosse team hosted a squad from South Australia earlier this week. Playing on a rainy Monday, the Crimson fell, 22-3.\n\nBut other times, the challenge will come from the good ol' U.S. of A.\n\nRemember when freshman goaltender Mike Francis had his first collegiate game last November against Team USA? He underwent a \"baptism by vulcanized rubber,\" as puck after puck went hurtling towards the Harvard goal.\n\nMembers of the Harvard women's water polo team may not soon forget the challenge they faced at last year's Eastern Tournament. They faced--and fell to--Sports Fest, an all-star team which representea the east in last year's National Sports Festival.\n\nThought Harvard has suffered devastating blowouts in past games which have not counted in the standings, there have been some Harvard teams which have risen to the challenge. And overcame.\n\nBrian Petrovek '77 threw a legendary 32-save effort against Team USA in the Boston Garden on November 23, 1975.\n\n\"It was nice for us to do,\" Petrovek, now the general manager of the AHL's Utica Devils, recalled, \"though I think we caught them [Team USA] early in the year.\"\n\nBut the real story behind the Crimson's 5-2 upset was the fact that Pertovek had a chance to go to Innsbruck but it was not in the cards. He missed the final cut.\n\nLast weekend all attention was focused on two shells racing on the Charles. One boat contained the Radcliffe lightweight fours with coxswain. The other contained members of the U.S. national team, stroking for the Boston Rowing Club.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We've raced against them before and hadn't even come close to beating them,\" said coxswain Katia Rorer. \"We had the objective of having a good race.\"\n\nBy the time the race was over, the Radcliffe boat had overcome its challenge.\n\nBy nine seconds.\n\n\"Officially, it didn't mean a thing to anyone,\" said senior Sarah Allums. \"But unofficially, it meant just everything to us.\"\n\nIndeed, it was probably the biggest win ever for this Radcliffe fivesome, which consists of Rorer.

Harvard did not play poorly, as it had in the Beanpot final, but B.U. brought a superior brand of hockey to the ice.\n\nBoth teams opened the game cautiously yet the Crimson maintained a slight territorial advantage for the first half of the first period. Even though Harvard kept the puck in the Terrier end, the Crimson was unable is mount any good scoring threats on B.U. goalie Brian Durocher.\n\nThe Terriers' duo of Rick Meagher, the tournament's most valuable player, and Mike Eruzione got B.U. rolling. Meaghey scored tow goals within 23 seconds. On the first tally. Eruzione made a perfect pass to Meagher, who rammed it past Brian Petrovek from 15 feet out.\n\nFor his second goal. Meagher picked up a loose puck that had eluded a Harvard defenseman at the Crimson blue line and waltzed in alone on Petrovek. Meagher scored on the breakaway in textbook fashions, decoying Petro out of his skates, and lifted his team to a lightning quick 2-0 advantage.\n\nBoth goals came when the Crimson defensive tandem of Larry Pratelli and Todd Nieland was on the ice. In this respect, the game was a repeat of the 7-2 Harvard loss I the Beanpot-final, as the swift Terrier forwards were once again too much for the two to handle.\n\nThird Score\n\nThe third B.U. score of the first period, however, at 18 seconds left in the stanza, propelled the Terriers to a lead too great for the Crimson to surmount.\n\nHarvard was having difficulty working the puck out from behind the Crimson net, way onto the stick of Terrier Buddy Powers, who was all alone five feet out. He promptly backhanded around Petrovek for the tally.\n\nFor the rest of the night the contest was a game of cat and mouse. Three times Harvard came within two goals--3-1, 4-2, 5,3--but each time the Terriers surged back to restore their three-goal cushion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only thing Crimson fans could be happy about was the remarkable efficiency of the power play unit which accounted for all three goals. The Harvard power play had been batting at a lowly, 290 clip for the season, but against B.U. it was awesome, despite the absence of Jimmy Thomas on the left point. Thomas missed the game with a head injury he incurred against Cornell the night before.\n\nPerfect Shot\n\nHarvard took more shots than usual, instead of working the puck around for the perfect shot--and the strategy paid off three time. Each Crimson tally came on a rebound or a tip-in off an errant shot from far out.\n\nJim McMahon picked up two of the power play goals--first at 4:58 of the second period on a rebound of a Steve Dagdigian shot. Mac collected his second goal at 14:55, by knocking down an Eddie Rossi shot from the point and putting past Durocher from close in.\n\nDagdigian got the final Crimson score of the night, at 17:51 of the second frame gathering the rebound from another Ross point shot which Durocher had left lying in his crease.\n\nSandwiched in between the Crimson tallies were two goals by Terry Meagher Rick's older brother, that kept the Crimson at bay.\n\nB.U. put the icing on the cake on a tip in from Mike Eruzione during a five-on three power play at 6:29 of the third period.\n\nThe Terriers Ken Kuzyk added insult in injury with another tally at 15:51, and school was out for Harvard.\n\nB.U. goalie Durocher played a solid game for the Terriers, stopping 32 Crimson shots, some of which were stingers. Harvard's Petrovek, in the other net, endured perhaps his most dismal game of the season. Petro earned 19 saves, and although he was not at fault on any of the B.U. scores, he did not play up to the caliber of the top goaltender in the East.\n\nIt was the B.U. defensive corps that was the difference in the match, however. When Harvard was not on its power play, the Crimson offense was impotent. The loss of Thomas was not felt on the power play. But it was sorely suffered by linemates Leigh Hogan and Teddy Thorndike Coach Bill Cleary used Phelps Swift and Billy Hozack in an effort to get the line moving, but these substitutions were to no avail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRandy Roth, Dave Gauthier and Kevin Burke played solid two-way hockey, and appeared to make up the most effective Crimson line on the ice with some tenacious forecheking--but forechecking did not make the big play.\n\nThe big guns for B.U. were Eruzione and Meagher. Both forwards are only sophomores and are the second and third leading scorers on the B.U. squad.\n\nMeagher, the most dynamic player on the Terrier squad, showed that he is capable of scoring each time he touches the puck. Eruzione, though not as flashy or as smooth a skater as Meagher, is the hustler, always digging and never letting up.\n\nAs expected, both teams played a fast skating, clean game. Unlike the previous nigh against Cornell, there was no cheap stuff between the two squads. Each team had a healthy respect for the other, as though there was an unwritten agreement between the players to avoid needless rough stuff in the corners and around the net.\n\n\"A lot of players on each team know each other personally,\" said Harvard's Dave Gauthier. \"You could call our games with them grudge matches, but we're not out to really hurt each other of give cheap shots. We want to go out and play a good hard game and may the better team win.\"\n\nAll is all it wasn't pleasant way, either for the players or for the largely inebriated Crimson fans, to end a highly-successful Eastern season, Next week brings the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament to St. Louis, Mo, and another Harvard Crack at regaining its honor against B.U."}, {"url": "https://api.thecrimson.com/article/1981/2/10/most-valuable-wade-lau-pand-then/", "page_content": "And then there was Wade Lau.\n\nThere was Boston College forward Robin Monleon with a flashy wrist shot at the nine-minute mark of the opening period. There were the last minute rushes by Eagles Billy O'Dwyer, Mark Switaj, Bobby Hehir and Gary Sampson at the crazy close of the second period. There was Switaj's sneaky flip-shot off a screen just into the third stanza. There was Eagle defenseman Mark Murphy's slapshot from the left point nine minutes into the third. There was Hehir 50 seconds later sweeping in on the Harvard net. There was the puck that landed on the back of the net at the ten-minute mark that led to a premature Eagle celebration. There was B.C. blueliner Jim Chisholm's vicious slapshot at 12:10. There were others, lost in the pages of an overflowing notebook and post-game ecstacy.\n\nAnd then, there was Wade Lau.\n\nWade Lau making pad saves, and stick saves and glove saves. Wade Lau challenging the Eagle forwards like he never challenged opposing forwards in his life.

It's no coincidence that Harvard last won the Beanpot that same year. There was Petrovek, and now there is Lau.\n\n\"This was Wade's shining moment,\" defenseman Mark Fusco, who had more than a few shining moments in the tourney, said. \"This is the first time he's really shown what Wade Lau can do. We couldn't have won it without him.\"\n\n\"What can I say?\" Crimson coach Billy Cleary said. \"Wade is now playing the hockey that I knew and that he knew he could play. He was just super.\"\n\nAnd what can Wade Lau, the recipient of all the hugs, of all the handshakes, the man with the Golden glove on one hand and the magic wand in the other, say? Was this the biggest thrill of his life?\n\n\"No doubt about it,\" the lanky goaltender grinned in a locker room full of cameras and pens and screaming teammates. \"No doubt about it at all.\"\n\nLast night at the Boston Garden, there was a Crimson revelation. And, at the crest of it all, there was Wade Lau."}]}
