{"George Roll is an American businessman and entrepreneur.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Soros", "page_content": "George Soros , (born August 12, 1930, Budapest , Hungary), Hungarian-born American financier, author, philanthropist, and activist whose success as an investor made him one of the wealthiest men in the world. He was also known as a powerful and influential supporter of liberal social causes.\n\nSoros, who was born into a prosperous Jewish family, had his upbringing disrupted by the Nazis \u2019 arrival in Hungary in 1944. The family split up and used false papers to avoid being sent to concentration camps . In 1947 they moved to London. Soros studied philosophy under Karl Popper at the London School of Economics , but he abandoned his plans to become a philosopher. He joined the London merchant bank Singer & Friedlander. In 1956 he moved to New York City , where he worked initially as an analyst of European securities and rapidly made his mark.\n\nFinancial career\n\nIn 1973 Soros established the Soros Fund (later Quantum Endowment Fund), a hedge fund that subsequently spawned a range of associated companies. His daring investment decisions caused the funds to grow rapidly, but not all his gambles succeeded. He correctly foresaw the worldwide stock market crash of October 1987\u2014but wrongly predicted that Japanese stocks would fall hardest of all.\n\nSoros\u2019s status as an almost mythical financier was established in September 1992 when the British government devalued the pound sterling. Through his Quantum group of companies, Soros had sold billions of pounds during the days preceding devaluation, much of it purchased with borrowed money. Afterward Soros bought back pounds, repaid the money he had borrowed, and made a profit of about $1 billion. Others also profited from the pound\u2019s fall, but the scale of Soros\u2019s operations dwarfed those of everyone else, and the gambit earned him the nickname \u201cthe man who broke the Bank of England.\u201d In 1994, however, his instincts appeared to fail him\u2014at least temporarily\u2014as he speculated that the dollar would rise in value against the Japanese yen. Instead, the dollar fell all year, and the Quantum Fund reportedly lost hundreds of millions on a single day in February.\n\nAlthough he denied involvement in speculative attacks on the Thai baht in 1997, Soros\u2019s name was soon linked with the financial crisis that swept Asia the following year. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad singled out Soros, stating that he was responsible for the decline of the ringgit. In reality, Soros\u2019s funds had lost billions as a result of the crisis. Soros recovered with early gains on Internet stocks in 1999, but his investment style became more conservative in the wake of the implosion of the technology bubble in 2000. In December 2002 a French court convicted Soros of insider trading for a 1988 stock deal involving financial services company Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, and he was fined \u20ac2.2 million ($2.9 million). Soros appealed the ruling, but it was upheld by the Cour de Cassation (France\u2019s highest court) in 2006. Facing new federal regulations concerning hedge funds, Soros announced in July 2011 that the Quantum Endowment Fund would no longer manage the money of outside investors. Instead, it would only handle the assets of Soros and his family."}, {"url": "https://wealthygorilla.com/richest-people-america/", "page_content": "Who are the richest athletes in the world?\n\nYou\u2019ve probably found yourself wondering just how much all your favorite athletes are worth, and who comes out on top.\n\nThis is why we\u2019ve put together a list of the 30 richest athletes in the world, with their net worth estimates, and how they\u2019ve managed to rake in so much cash!\n\nThe 30 Richest Athletes in the World\n\nThese figures have been compiled from Forbes and Celebrity Net Worth.

But his business smarts have essentially been forgotten by historians and the public, even though Washington\u2019s face can be seen plastered across the U.S. currency.\n\nA new book called First Entrepreneur: How George Washington Built His \u2013 and the Nation\u2019s \u2013 Prosperity is based upon reams of historic, unpublished documents showing the extent of his entrepreneurial focus. The book shines a light on Washington\u2019s business-minded accomplishments, which helped set up the nation for future success.\n\nAuthor Edward Lengel, a professor at the University of Virginia, discussed his book and revealed little known details about this crucial founding father on the Knowledge at Wharton show on Wharton Business Radio on SiriusXM channel 111. (Listen to the podcast at the top of this page.)\n\nAn edited transcript of the conversation follows.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: Before interviewing an author, I love to read the inside jacket of his book for a great nugget of insight. You\u2019ve got a good one in your book, which says, \u201cThe United States was conceived in business, founded on business, and operated as a business.\u201d A lot of people forget about this. When we talk about the United States, we talk about freedom and many other topics. We don\u2019t think much about business.\n\nEdward Lengel: Yes. It was unusual for me, too. I had also been accustomed to looking at Washington from a different perspective. But when I began to look at him as an entrepreneur and as a businessman, I saw, first of all, that he thought of himself as an entrepreneur and businessman. Secondly, he identified the country\u2019s interests with his own.\n\nWhen he became both a general commanding the armies and President of the United States, he naturally thought of the country as a business. When he became President, he said, \u201cBuilding the national prosperity is my first and my only aim.\u201d Business was central to his approach.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: You are the director for The Papers of George Washington, which is a massive project begun in the 1960s to analyze and annotate all of Washington\u2019s letters, writing and documents. So you are very familiar with Washington. When did you begin thinking about Washington in a business sense?\n\n\u201cHe naturally thought of the country as a business.\u201d\n\nLengel: It began only a few years ago when my organization decided to look at Washington\u2019s financial and business papers, which had never been published. There\u2019s a huge collection of account books, ledgers and financial documentation. We decided to interpret them and publish them. This opened a whole new window into his life. These are not just records or dreary accounts. They actually document the lifeblood of his family, his estate and the country. It shows how much time and effort he spent on this and how important it was to him.\n\nI think his business aptitude came from his mother, who has a bad reputation for being a grouchy woman. But she inculcated in him principles of thrift, diligence and hard work. She taught him the very basic principle that industry and morality go together. She taught him that the moral man is industrious and vice versa. She taught him that building your own prosperity is, in and of itself, an ethical thing to do.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: How did Washington take that philosophy, expand it beyond the family realm and apply it to a new country? How did he use that philosophy to build up the United States?\n\nLengel: It was a challenge, especially when he first became President, because there was a lot of political division, uncertainty and fear. He took an optimistic view of his tasks: leading the nation, trying to build up the nation\u2019s credit, establishing a stable currency, building national infrastructure and keeping the peace. He especially focused on the currency and wiping out international debt. This was a huge challenge, especially the debt. Fortunately, he had Alexander Hamilton to work with him.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: How much debt are we talking about?\n\nLengel: I think the equivalent today would approach trillions of dollars. It was a crushing debt owed to France and the Netherlands after several years of war. Six years into his presidency, he had wiped out the national debt to France.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: How did he do that?\n\nLengel: He worked with Hamilton to deliver a revolving system of debt repayments to gradually pay it off through careful taxation, currency management and by establishing a national bank. Instead of wiping out the economy to pay off the whole debt all at once, he was able to manage it over a series of years, which built up the nation\u2019s credit.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: Hamilton is credited with a lot of the early success of the U.S. economy, but the two men are closely associated with one another.\n\nLengel: Yes. Hamilton certainly developed many of the concepts for implementing economic policy, but Washington set the goals and strategy. Hamilton worked with him to carry it out. There were times when Washington was ready to strike down Hamilton\u2019s ideas. He was within moments of vetoing the national bank that Hamilton established. But they worked as a team.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: The country could have turned out very differently were it not for this business focus.\n\nLengel: Yes. The country could have staggered into ruin or stagnation, or it could have broken apart, both politically and physically. There was a lot of regional difference. It was an important part of Washington\u2019s national policy, tied with his economic policy, to bind the different parts of the nation together through commerce. I really can\u2019t overstate how important commerce was to him, both domestic and international.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: Trade is massively important for a new country that is trying to build itself up.\n\nLengel: Yes. Washington saw commerce as something that naturally contributed to peace and unity.\n\nHe coined a phrase, \u201ccommunities of interest,\u201d during the Revolutionary War, and he used it over and over again. The idea was that if people trade with each other \u2013 including Native Americans, Northerners, Southerners and foreigners \u2013 they will inevitably begin to see common and shared interests. They will work together and be more peaceful as a result.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: But there had to be a level of trust with Washington. You had to take a person at his word and face value.\n\nLengel: Yes. His conduct during the war and at the end of the war showed that he was a trustworthy person. Anybody else in that position may not have been able to generate the same level of trust.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: It\u2019s interesting how Washington\u2019s prosperity is tied to the country\u2019s prosperity.\n\nLengel: Before the war he saw how the British mercantilist, colonial system held him down and forced his fellow Americans to stay down. Ultimately, he absolutely hated debt. Debt made him anxious and worried. But the British colonial system forced the American people into debt. He saw that if he wanted to get out of debt and build his own prosperity, the nation would need to rid itself of the colonial system.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: Washington didn\u2019t have a great formal education, but I get the sense from your book that this was actually a positive for him.\n\n\u201cWashington saw commerce as something that naturally contributed to peace.\u201d\n\nLengel: It\u2019s ironic, because he felt so insecure about his lack of formal education. His father died when he was 11, so he didn\u2019t receive the classical liberal arts education that his peers received. Instead, he got a practical education based on accounting, mathematics, geometry and basics related to estate management.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: In some respects, he had the early version of street smarts.\n\nLengel: That\u2019s right. He had to think on his feet. He had to plunge into a problem and manage it right away, instead of receiving all kinds of esoteric learning.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: Your book discusses how slavery plays a role in his thinking. His thoughts on this topic changed over time.\n\nLengel: Yes. There\u2019s no doubt about it. Slavery can\u2019t be pushed aside as an element of his life and times. The enslaved people on his estate played a major role in building his prosperity.\n\nAs a young man, he simply accepted the slavery system, like many of his contemporaries. I had always assumed that he turned against slavery for moral reasons after the American Revolutionary War. I figured he eventually thought it was wrong to hold people in bondage.\n\nBut actually, his thinking began to change with a very basic calculation. He calculated that if you hold people in bondage, you restrict them from the basic right of enjoying the fruits of their own labor. Therefore, they have little motivation to work. What motivation do slaves have to innovate, invest, and think towards the future? He began to think that slavery would not only hold him back, but that it would hold the nation back in the long run.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: It\u2019s interesting that it would take so long for slavery to be abolished.\n\nLengel: Yes. There\u2019s no doubt that Washington would have preferred it if slavery had been abolished earlier. He thought that the longer slavery lasted, the more the economy would stagnate and would remain heavily agricultural and backwards.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: Your book mentions that some Washington concepts from back then would still be good concepts today.\n\nLengel: I think he would have been a huge advocate of the Internet. He was a big believer in gathering information, classifying information and disseminating information and knowledge about business and experimentation. He was a big believer in experimentation. His fundamental ideas related to calculated risk taking, careful account keeping and transparency could all be applied in the 21st century.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: I\u2019m guessing Washington would have been in favor of IT security, considering he wasn\u2019t a fan of the British system of taxation and debt forced upon early Americans. You need to have security and trust to move forward.\n\nLengel: Yes, there\u2019s no doubt about that. He was also an advocate of some industrial, overseas espionage. The British restricted the export of knowledge and manufacturers, and skilled labor. Washington tried everything he could to bend, if not break rules, to steal industrial secrets.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: As he was building up his first estate, what were the biggest roadblocks that he faced?\n\n\u201cHe began to think that slavery would not only hold him back, but that it would hold the nation back in the long run.\u201d\n\nLengel: The biggest obstacle was the British mercantilist system. It forced American planters to grow tobacco and sell it through British agents on British ships, who shipped it overseas and sold it on behalf of the planters. The planters got credit in return; they did not get cash. They had to live on credit and use that credit to buy British manufactured goods. In fact, they usually used their credit to buy luxury goods, because conspicuous consumption was important in Washington\u2019s social class. The result was debt.\n\nWe tend to think that people at Washington\u2019s level had it easy, but they faced financial ruin almost on a daily basis. People at Washington\u2019s level were collapsing and having to sell off their estates because they fell so deeply into debt. It was a day-to-day problem he had to face.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: How much did the next Presidents benefit from Washington\u2019s work?\n\nLengel: They benefitted quite a lot. Washington was completely successful in his goal to create a stable, solid foundation for future growth, build a stable currency and keep the peace. Unfortunately, some of his successors didn\u2019t maintain that peace. But nevertheless, he brought the country to a stable, solid level where it could grow and weather the storms that were bound to come.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: He was a military man as well. How did that affect his thinking?\n\nLengel: He was a military man, but he was a combat veteran. I don\u2019t think anybody cares for peace more than a combat veteran. Not because of pacifism necessarily, but because they understand the damage war can do at all levels. President Washington was most certainly a man of peace. He thought that keeping the peace was essential to giving the country, and the American people, a chance to grow their wealth.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: The country was so new and so many things were being developed during this period. Do you think Washington left anything unresolved? Was there anything in particular that he didn\u2019t complete?\n\nLengel: Certainly the slavery issue was never perfectly resolved during his lifetime.\n\nHe wanted to maintain political stability. He saw the development of political factions as being detrimental to national peace. He ended his second term an embittered man as he saw the Jeffersonians and the Hamiltonians at each other\u2019s throats. He thought that they should be willing to work together for a common purpose.\n\nHe would probably consider that his greatest failure. But it wasn\u2019t really his fault.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: It\u2019s a shame we still have these problems today. I expect he\u2019d be really frustrated if he were alive today.\n\nLengel: Yes, he saw partisanship, faction, and the lack of decorum as fundamental evils.\n\nHe kept telling Thomas Jefferson and Hamilton that they should be willing to subvert their extreme dislike for one another for a common cause. But they did not.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: It\u2019s amazing that these manuscripts and papers had not been released beforehand.\n\nLengel: They had never been published before, and they are going to be free and publicly available online when we finish sorting through them this summer. They will be available on the Mount Vernon website, and you\u2019ll be able to explore all of his financial papers, understand the depth of his business feelings and see how he managed everything.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: It\u2019s great work. And it\u2019s good to have this historical perspective. You obviously have written quite a bit about these topics. Is this a true passion for you?\n\nLengel: Oh, yes. I enjoy it very much. I think Washington recognized that everything that he did on the national level would be an example not just for his contemporaries, but also for future generations.\n\nKnowledge at Wharton: Tell me about the tough process of developing a working business relationship with the British after the war?\n\nLengel: That\u2019s a great question. He and his fellow Americans emotionally wanted to look to the French for trade opportunities. But Washington was a realist. He studied the French and the British economies and saw that the French were very backwards, whereas the British were the most advanced economic nation in the world, both in terms of their agricultural revolution and their industrial revolution. He sent people over to Great Britain and he had friends among the British manufacturing class. Through his research he saw that the Americans needed to emulate the British, trade with the British and learn from the British to become a great nation. It was a practical decision. It infuriated a lot of Americans, including Jefferson. Jefferson was not a realist on this topic. But Washington moved ahead with his plan anyway, and we\u2019re fortunate that he did. We really needed to follow the British example."}, {"url": "https://www.kodak.com/en/company/page/george-eastman-history", "page_content": "As Eastman\u2019s young company grew, it faced total collapse at least once when dry plates in the hands of dealers went bad. Eastman recalled them and replaced them with a good product. \"Making good on those plates took our last dollar,\" he said. \"But what we had left was more important -- reputation.\"\n\n\"The idea gradually dawned on me,\" he later said, \"that what we were doing was not merely making dry plates, but that we were starting out to make photography an everyday affair.\" Or as he described it more succinctly \"to make the camera as convenient as the pencil.\"\n\nEastman's experiments were directed to the use of a lighter and more flexible support than glass. His first approach was to coat the photographic emulsion on paper and then load the paper in a roll holder. The holder was used in view cameras in place of the holders for glass plates.\n\nIn 1883, Eastman startled the trade with the announcement of film in rolls, with the roll holder adaptable to nearly every plate Camera on the market.\n\nThe first film advertisements in 1885 stated that \"shortly there will be introduced a new sensitive film which it is believed will prove an economical and convenient substitute for glass dry plates both for outdoor and studio work.\"\n\nThis system of photography using roll holders was immediately successful. However, paper was not entirely satisfactory as a carrier for the emulsion because the grain of the paper was likely to be reproduced in the photo.\n\nEastman's solution was to coat the paper with a layer of plain, soluble gelatin, and then with a layer of insoluble light-sensitive gelatin. After exposure and development, the gelatin bearing the image was stripped from the paper, transferred to a sheet of clear gelatin, and varnished with collodion -- a cellulose solution that forms a tough, flexible film.\n\nAs he perfected transparent roll film and the roll holder, Eastman changed the whole direction of his work and established the base on which his success in amateur photography would be built.\n\nHe later said: \"When we started out with our scheme of film photography, we expected that everybody who used glass plates would take up films. But we found that the number which did so was relatively small. In order to make a large business we would have to reach the general public.\"\n\nWith the KODAK Camera in 1888, Eastman put down the foundation for making photography available to everyone. Pre-loaded with enough film for 100 exposures, the camera could be easily carried and handheld during operation. It was priced at $25. After exposure, the whole camera was returned to Rochester. There the film was developed, prints were made and new film was inserted -- all for $10."}, {"url": "https://americanbusinesshistory.org/george-eastman-the-greatest-technology-entrepreneur-in-u-s-history/", "page_content": "This article first appeared on January 24, 2018 in The Archbridge Institute\u2019s \u2018American Originals\u2018 series.\n\nThe technologies of today are built upon those of the past, and the superstars of our era would be nothing without the great leaders of the past. We often discuss our favorite \u201ctech\u201d entrepreneurs. Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and many other names arise. Too often these discussions lack historical perspective. Here we build a case for George Eastman as the greatest technology entrepreneur. Why does he deserve such a high ranking?\n\nGeorge Eastman, or \u201cGE\u201d as he was called most of his life, was born to a reasonably prosperous family, but his father died in 1862 when the boy was seven years old, forcing his mother to fend for herself and her three children. He became interested in the emerging field of photography and went on to \u201cfather\u201d amateur photography with his Kodak cameras and film. Under his leadership, his Eastman Kodak company became a global powerhouse, perhaps still unequaled in its global reach and dominance of an important field.\n\nThe company\u2019s innovations led to mass consumer photography, aerial photography, medical x-rays, and the development of the movie industry, precursors to today\u2019s selfies and even YouTube. Eastman was the \u201ctotal entrepreneur\u201d\u2014marketing genius, financial wizard, great employer, both a visionary and a hands-on inventor and designer. Over the years, he became one of the most important philanthropists in American history, perhaps foreshadowing Bill Gates\u2019s diverse interests. Above all else, George Eastman was \u201chis own man\u201d\u2014a unique personality of independent mind. This is his story.\n\nThe Beginnings\n\nGE was born July 12, 1854, to Maria Kilbourn Eastman and George Washington Eastman, a successful fruit farmer in (far) upstate Waterville, New York. The senior Eastman also operated a business school in much-bigger Rochester which grew into a chain of schools teaching penmanship, accounting, and other business skills. But eight years later, the father died of a \u201cbrain disorder.\u201d GE, his two older sisters (one of whom was an invalid), and their mother lived in Rochester, where the family took in boarders to make ends meet.\n\nGE soon became self-reliant, taking a job as an office boy at fourteen. He worked from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., six days a week for $3 a week. Following in his father\u2019s footsteps, he began a lifelong habit of recording every penny he earned and every penny he spent in record books. An entrepreneur at heart, he made and sold little metal puzzles to his friends for ten cents each. For adults, he made $5 walnut bookshelf brackets in his workshop.\n\nEven at this early age, he budgeted to take care of others as well: a ride for invalid sister Katie in a carriage, a book for his other sister, 25 cents a week to the Sunday School coffers. When Katie died a few years later, he paid for her return to Waterville to be buried next to their father.\n\nHe also took care of himself, dressing as well as he could afford, two flutes, dancing lessons, membership in a gym, and subscriptions to Harper\u2019s and Youth\u2019s Companion magazines. He even splurged on $10 for a trip to New York City, the beginnings of a lifetime of travel. At age nineteen, he ventured farther afield, to Chicago. He hung around the local bookstore, reading a volume of the encyclopedia at a time while standing in the store. His imagination was fired by tales of geography, travel, and science.\n\nDuring this time, GE\u2019s mother temporarily took in the Henry Strong family after their home burned down. Henry regaled the families with his stories of adventures\u2014how he ran off to sea as a sailor, jumped ship in France with no money and no ability to speak French, climbed Colorado\u2019s Pike\u2019s Peak in the dead of winter with a caravan of ox teams, and had failed in a business in St. Louis. Later, Henry settled down in the family business, the Strong-Woodbury Whip company, one of the largest makers of whips in the country. Sixteen-year-old GE, forever shy and quiet, and the gregarious thirty-two-year-old Henry were ultimately to do remarkable things together.\n\nBy seventeen, GE had joined the Buell & Hayden insurance agency where he made $41.66 a month, along with another $8 for serving as a volunteer fireman. In April 1874, twenty-year-old GE took a $700 per year job as a clerk at the Rochester Savings Bank. Within a year, he was making $1,000 as second assistant bookkeeper, when the average annual wage was $3-400. He was saving money, but he was also spending\u2014on inexpensive art, clothes, travel, and gifts.\n\nThe Amateur Photographer\n\nThe 1870s brought an important change to Eastman\u2019s life. In 1877, he became interested in investing in land around the new American naval base near Santo Domingo, Hispaniola. He planned a trip to investigate, and a friend recommended he buy a camera to take with him to record the possibilities. The trip never took place, but GE got his first camera and was soon hooked on photography as a hobby. At the time, photography required a serious investment of money and time. His $49.58 \u201ckit\u201d ($1,100 in today\u2019s money) included a camera the size of a soapbox, a tripod, a plate holder for the photographic plates, a darkroom tent, a nitrate bath, and a container for the water required to make pictures. Professional photographers would put up with all the hassles, but there were only two \u201camateurs\u201d in Rochester, of which Eastman was one. He took classes and talked to experts, learning everything he could about his new interest.\n\nEastman described the process:\n\nWe used the wet collodion process, taking a very clean glass plate and coating it with a thin solution of egg white. This was to make the subsequent emulsion stick. Then we coated the plate with a solution of guncotton and alcohol mixed with bromide salts. When the emulsion was set, but still moist, the plate was dipped into a solution of nitrate of silver, the sensitizing agent. That had to be done in the dark. The plate, wet and shielded from the light, was put in the camera. Now you took your picture.\n\nIn a photography journal, GE read of a new process in England, using dry plates instead of wet plates. He began to experiment with formulas himself, and wrote:\n\nMy first results did not amount to much, but finally I came across a coating of gelatine and silver bromide that had all the necessary photographic qualities. \u2026 At first I wanted to make photography simpler merely for my own convenience, but soon I thought of the possibilities of commercial production.\n\nHe continued his successful career as a banker, working on photography in his \u201cspare time\u201d\u2014from 3 p.m. each day until breakfast the next day. He met every photography expert he could, subjecting them to \u201crelentless questioning.\u201d Eastman soon realized the need for a coating machine to uniformly, easily, and cheaply coat the dry plates. He developed one and patented it.\n\nIn June of 1879, the twenty-five-year-old used his $400 in savings to take the steamer Abyssinia to Liverpool en route to London, the financial capital of the world. His goal was to patent the machine in England, sell off the rights, and use the proceeds to go into business for himself. He had mixed results\u2014the leading British manufacturers liked his idea and offered to buy it, but dawdled on the final agreement and any payments. While he visited Paris and fell in love with Europe, he said, \u201cEnglishmen as a rule are business hyenas.\u201d With this trip, GE already indicated his awareness of the potential of international markets, when few other American businessmen ventured abroad.\n\nBy 1880, Eastman was promoted to first assistant bookkeeper at the bank, with a salary of $1,400 per year. He rented a room above a music store in downtown Rochester, two blocks from his bank, where he could continue his photographic ambitions. As would be demonstrated throughout his lifetime, GE learned everything and paid special attention to details. For his new darkroom, he designed and patented ruby red light globes and had them custom-made by the Corning Glass Works, also of upstate New York. In December 1880, George Eastman and old friend Henry Strong set up the Eastman Dry Plate Company.\n\nHe did everything himself, from hiring and firing to inventing, mixing, selling, bookkeeping, and corresponding. He designed and made his own hammock so he could nap during his overnight stints before returning to the bank each morning. He came out with a better coating machine while still trying to sell the patents or rights to the old one. But he kept his bank job, believing he needed a fallback in case the new venture failed. By March of 1881, he had six employees; by December, sixteen. That same year, Henry Strong, now successful in the whip business, invested $5,000 in Eastman\u2019s photography business.\n\nThe Independent Businessman\n\nHowever, in that same year, September of 1881, Eastman was passed over for a promotion at the bank when his superior left\u2014passed over in favor of a relative of one of the bank\u2019s directors. He said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t fair; it wasn\u2019t right; it was against every principle of justice.\u201d He quit, devoting full time to the Eastman Dry Plate Company. One banker said, \u201cGeorge is a damn fool to give up a wonderful position for a will o\u2019 the wisp.\u201d\n\nGE bought land and began construction of a new four-story building for the company. He was producing dry plates, but soon confronted his first business crisis: some of his plates produced no image and others were badly fogged. For two years the plates had been fine, and he could not discover the new problem. He reimbursed all his photographic dealers for the bad plates and soon ran out of money. The contractor threatened to foreclose on the new building, but was convinced to stay the course.\n\nAfter 469 failed experiments to find the right emulsion to fix the plates, Eastman and Strong again steamed for England to see their chemical supplier in March 1882. In a week, they discovered the problem was the gelatin\u2014the English company had changed its source without telling Eastman. It was not until forty years later that the company realized that the new cows from which the gelatin was made had not grazed on enough sulfur-rich mustard. While in England, he visited his suppliers\u2019 factories and absorbed every detail of their operation.\n\nBy 1884, GE was successfully pursuing a \u201crollable\u201d substance\u2014a way to create roll film. The idea had been around since 1854, but no one had figured it out. Eastman believed that the first company to market a flexible, tough, transparent, inert substitute for glass would have a big advantage over the hundreds of small plate companies struggling to survive. He also developed a roll holder that fit on the back of existing cameras. His 2.75-pound system could take 50 pictures; by comparison, 50 glass plates weighed 50 pounds. In creating this roll holder system, Eastman was an early user of interchangeable parts (seventeen of them). These innovations won the system gold medals at photography exhibitions in London, Paris, Florence, Moscow, Geneva, and Melbourne. By 1885, he had salesmen and demonstrators traveling the world, keeping up with and encouraging them constantly by letter and telegram.\n\nAlso in 1884, at the age of thirty, he structured the company as a stock company with $200,000 in capital ($5.4 million today), with thirteen stockholders. Henry Strong had the most, 37.5 percent of the company, followed by Eastman with 32.5 percent. Thus began what became one of the best investments in American history. Eastman soon began the habit of paying for things, even paintings, with company stock.\n\nDespite the honors and publicity earned by his new system, and despite his great selling efforts, professional photographers were slow to switch from dry plates to roll film. And there were few amateurs who would put up with the difficult process and need for a darkroom. Eastman said, \u201cWhen we started out with our scheme of film photography, we expected that everybody who used glass plates would take up film, but we found that the number which did so was relatively small, and in order to make a large business we would have to reach the general public.\u201d He wanted a camera that \u201cany child could operate.\u201d\n\nAs Eastman worked toward this much more ambitious strategy, he continued to experiment with chemicals and emulsions. Over time he hired the best minds he could find. While he had little formal education himself, he began hiring university-trained chemists, alongside self-trained experimenters. In 1886, when his salary was $60 per week, he gave $50 to the local Mechanics Institute, his first gift supporting formal education. As the new men took over his role as experimenter (though he was never far away), he began to focus on marketing. (He also hired many women, who were among his highest paid.) He designed every ad, chose every illustration.\n\nGE also became an expert on patents and patent law; he fought many battles over his own patents and the great many competing patents. He negotiated when that was the best policy, he fought when he needed to, and he often bought other companies for their patents or to gain a key executive or chemist that he wanted. He was ever-present in the factory, often scaring his workers as he walked through the works so silently that they didn\u2019t hear him coming.\n\nThe Rise to Empire\n\nIn 1886 and 1887, he developed a small $45 \u201cdetective camera\u201d with a removable roll holder with forty-eight pictures, but he was not happy with it and soon stopped production. In the late 1880s, Eastman opened his first retail store, in Oxford Street in London; stores in Paris and elsewhere soon followed. In the winter of 1887\u20131888, he finally developed a film camera that worked. While owners could develop their own film (requiring sixteen items in a darkroom), the Eastman Company offered the service of developing the film. Send your camera back to us, we will develop the film, reload the camera with new film, and send the camera and finished pictures back to you. The camera with film for one hundred pictures sold for $25, and the developing service cost $10 per roll.\n\nThe Kodak London office\n\nAt the same time, Eastman coined the term \u201cKodak.\u201d While numerous stories exist about the name\u2019s creation, it appears that he liked the \u201chard\u201d k sound, the fact it could not be misspelled, it could not be mispronounced, was intelligible in any language, and was like no other word. Kodak went on to become one of the most powerful brand names in American history. Eastman\u2019s customers became \u201cKodakers.\u201d The slogan was \u201cYou press the button, we do the rest.\u201d Few technology entrepreneurs have also been so adept at marketing.\n\nEastman knew he had a hit on his hands when his senior partner and financier, Henry Strong, who had never taken a photograph, took a Kodak on a trip and became obsessed with it. The idea and name spread like wildfire. Gilbert and Sullivan included references to a Kodak in one of their operettas, \u201cUtopia,\u201d and an 1890s song \u201cTo My Sweetheart\u2019s Kodak\u201d contained the lyrics:\n\nO Kodak, are you so void of sense\n\nThat you so stoically take\n\nThe pressure of her fingers fair\n\nWhile all my nerves do shake?\n\nIn six months in 1888, five thousand of these cameras were sold, and the company earned a profit of $269,000, almost double the profit from the same six months of the prior year. Eastman began to attract talent with stock options rather than high salaries. He also realized that the people he hired from around the world might need Rochester to be a better city to live in if the company were going to prosper.\n\nEastman began his practice of continual improvement. The first camera had no viewfinder, so he added a V-mark on the top that the photographer could point toward the subject. Then he added a card on which the photographer could mark how many pictures they had taken so they\u2019d know when the roll of one hundred was complete. He came out with new models every year, by 1902 making sixty different camera models for every application. Over time he realized that the company\u2019s strength must come from making the best products, improving every year, rather than fighting long, drawn-out, expensive patent suits.\n\nGE soon realized that the sale of film, not cameras, would be the key to the system\u2019s success. He made references to King C. Gillette\u2019s practice of practically giving away razors in order to make money on blades. His over-arching understanding of a complete system set him apart from the many tinkerers and inventors in the photographic field.\n\nEastman never lost sight of the international markets. With the Rochester plant unable to keep up with demand, he built a large factory in England. In the process, he remarked, \u201cYou, in England, are too cautious and afraid of making mistakes. We in the States make our mistakes and straighten them out before you even begin to make them.\u201d\n\nHe spent three months in 1889 in London and Paris, taking his beloved mother to galleries, museums, and the theater. He organized a new company in England, then returned to the United States to reorganize the American company with a capitalization of $1 million. Gradually, Eastman became an expert on corporate finance. Later, when London\u2019s powerful bankers would not underwrite a large stock offering because they thought he was a dreamer, Eastman gave up and handled it himself. The offering was oversubscribed.\n\nKodak Park in Rochester, New York\n\nIn 1890, he began building a new three-building plant in Rochester. But six months after it was completed, he had to develop plans to double the size. Eastman recalled his rural roots, and loved gardening and landscaping. He did not consider the buildings complete until they were beautifully landscaped. The complex became \u201cKodak Park,\u201d one of the nation\u2019s most impressive industrial facilities. It included two 366-foot-tall brick smokestacks, taller than any building in New York City, to carry away the factory\u2019s fumes.\n\nAlso in 1890, a young Alice Whitney applied to be Eastman\u2019s secretary. She was told he was \u201ca difficult man to work for\u201d but applied anyway. She got the job, and for the next forty-two years was his assistant, his screener, and his protector. She gained power of attorney and wrote checks on his personal account. She was the only one around when he wrote his will, but even she did not see the amounts he put beside each name. For thirty years, Alice Whitney had a courtship with fellow Kodak employee Charlie Hutchinson, and finally married him in 1927. When Charlie died in 1974 at age one hundred, he left more than $25 million to the University of Rochester, the third biggest donor after Eastman and the founder of Rochester-based Xerox, Joseph C. Wilson. That Kodak stock really paid off!\n\nPictured Left: Kodak Brownie, later model\n\nIn 1892, the company was renamed the Eastman Kodak Company. While the company had introduced cameras selling for as little as $5, the big breakthrough came with the \u201cKodak Brownie\u201d of 1900. It sold for $1, the film for fifteen cents. Hundreds of thousands were quickly sold.\n\nDuring these same years, Kodak took the lead in making film for the motion picture industry. The company\u2019s product was undeniably the best, and production could not keep up with demand. For many years, cinema film was a more important source of revenue than consumer film. Eastman established one of the nation\u2019s first industrial research laboratories. The company went on to play a leading role in film for x-ray machines, and pioneered cameras for aerial photography, operating a school for the US military during World War I. (And Eastman gave back to the government his wartime profits.) During the war, precious chemicals from the great German chemical companies became unavailable. So, by the 1920s, the company had developed a synthetic chemical department, ultimately to become the Eastman Chemical Company of today, which in 2016 earned a profit of $854 million on sales of over $9 billion. Color still film and color movies came along in time, led by Kodak in pursuit of the longstanding dreams of the founder.\n\nBy 1895, the company made 90 percent of the film produced in the world. The Eastman Kodak Company achieved and maintained this almost-monopoly market share without the government protections held by companies like AT&T. It had patents, but above all else it had the skills and leadership required. The original leaders of the photographic industry, Anthony of New York City and Scovill of Connecticut, merged to form Ansco, but never again rivaled Kodak. In the trust-busting era, especially under President Woodrow Wilson, the government sued to break up Kodak\u2014the trial and negotiations went on for years before an agreement was reached, with little impact on the company. Perhaps the regulators realized that a decline in Kodak would mean the rise of the German industry, especially AGFA.\n\nBy 1913, the market value of all Kodak stock reached $175 million, making George Eastman one of the richest men in America, and showering other Rochester residents with wealth. In 1967, Kodak was the third most-valuable company in America, behind only IBM and AT&T. It was worth more than Standard Oil of New Jersey (later called Exxon) and General Electric combined. In 1973, the value of the company reached $24 billion.\n\nGeorge Eastman the Man, and his People\n\nDespite his success, Eastman was painfully shy throughout his life. He refused to attend events honoring him, made few speeches, and was often mistaken for being cold and aloof. He disliked interviews and personal press coverage, killing efforts to write his biography. He had great powers of concentration, and visitors often awoke him from a fog of thought. Nevertheless, as is common among people of such complexity, he had his contradictions. He developed an enormous range of personal friends around the world, entertained them lavishly, and traveled in large groups, often in a chartered private railroad car.\n\nGeorge Eastman and Thomas Edison\n\nHis friendships were complex. Those who were loyal, who worked hard and were able to maintain his almost-impossible quality standards prospered. Those who left to join the competition were never spoken to again. He had spies go into competing factories to see if they were using his patents. He even had detectives follow his salesmen to see if they were doing as they were instructed.\n\nThose who performed were amply rewarded. He said, \u201cThe past and continued prosperity of our company is not due to the value of a patent or an invention. Quality can only be secured by extreme skill and alertness not only as individuals but as an organization.\u201d The Eastman Kodak Company was a leader in offering employee amenities\u2014recreational areas, health care and insurance programs, and pension benefits. Eastman Kodak was an early user of employee suggestion boxes. The biggest innovation was the \u201cwage dividend,\u201d begun in 1912. Each spring, every employee, at every level, received a bonus check of 2 percent of their wages for the past five years, or about five weeks\u2019 pay. Kodak Bonus Day became a retail holiday in Rochester. By 1914, the company had ten thousand employees. In 1989, the payout to 85,000 employees was $239 million.\n\nIn 1919, Eastman gave one-third of his own stock to an employee pool, worth $5 million, and matched it with company treasury stock. Employees could buy stock, then selling at $575 per share, for the $100 par value. In 1924, he contributed another $9 million of his own stock. Due to a happy workforce, the company was never unionized. Virtually all executives were promoted from within. Eastman Kodak had among the lowest employee turnover rates in American industry\u2014less than 10 percent per year.\n\nDespite appearing to be a \u201ccontrol freak,\u201d Eastman believed in delegation, and would frequently go on long trips and leave the day-to-day work to his trusted associates. Beginning in 1921, at the age of sixty-seven, he reduced his daily visits to the office, and retired from the presidency of Eastman Kodak in 1925 to let the \u201cnext generation\u201d take over. The company was in good hands.\n\nAnother unique aspect of Eastman, rare for his era, was that he never married, remaining a bachelor his entire life. At the same time, he was always surrounded by women and shared many of their interests, from gardening to cooking. He loved children and took care of his many relatives and their offspring. He entertained and traveled with women around the world. Several pursued him to no avail. All efforts to learn more about his sexuality have failed; it\u2019s clear that he was heterosexual, but there is no evidence of any affairs. He may have fallen in love early and lost. Perhaps he sublimated his energy into his never-ending projects. There is no question that he was shy, and that he prized his independence.\n\nEastman\u2019s London Dental Clinic for Children\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable thing about George Eastman was his diversity of interests. He leaped from project to project, becoming an expert in each, talking to experts, reading everything he could get his hands on, and then developing a clear, comprehensive plan. His interests included gardening, cows, horses, bicycling, automobiles, music, travel, art, reading, higher education (including for blacks in the South), guns, children\u2019s dentistry, the health of the poor, housing for the poor, silent movies, the Chamber of Commerce, cooking, best practices in municipal government, hunting, fishing, and politics (though he stayed in the background there). He wrote over two hundred thousand letters in his lifetime.\n\nWhile he always had a broad, strategic vision for each project, he never missed a detail. His life was full of the smallest achievements: when workers misplaced tools, he put hooks on the wall and drew the outline of each tool on the wall so none would ever be misplaced. He designed a custom picnic basket for the frequent automobile tours with his friends. He looked hard at the pipes and plumbing fixtures in every building he was involved in \u2026 and on and on and on, in every aspect of his life.\n\nPerhaps above all else, he loved architecture and was a continual nettle to his high-priced architects, including the famous New York firm of McKim, Mead, and White. He designed the floor plan of every building he was involved with, from factories to houses to theaters, before he let the architects \u201cdecorate it.\u201d He always sought the very best and most durable materials while at the same time watching every penny for waste or needless extravagance. He was a leader in factory construction and became one of the nation\u2019s top experts on fireproofing because of the flammable nature of the chemicals used by the company (and the experience of an early fire).\n\nGeorge Eastman the Spender and Giver\n\nWhile Eastman could be generous, he was also good to himself. He owned Packards, Lincolns, Cadillacs, and a custom-made Cunningham automobile. He traveled all over the United States, often six weeks at a time, and took an entourage of friends, relatives, and work associates with him. He bicycled around Europe, and later ventured to Africa to hunt big game and take pictures. He took a long trip to Japan.\n\nGeorge Eastman\u2019s ideas and actions were always big and bold. He took his first airplane ride in 1918, a brave thing to do, and later rode in the Goodyear blimp. He climbed mountains. He bought gifts for his friends and employees, and art for himself. He went to the theater nightly when in the cities. He hired the finest musicians to come to Rochester to play for him and for the public. He threw massive parties and events at his house and at the company.\n\nThe Eastman House, Rochester, New York\n\nHis greatest extravagance was his 1905 mansion, Eastman House. The 42,000-square-foot palace had thirty-seven rooms and thirteen baths and was surrounded by acres of flowers and gardens. Given Eastman\u2019s love of music, the house included a huge custom-built pipe organ, which was later expanded and a second organ added. There was a staff of forty inside and fifteen outside to care for the grounds. Even the maids had a maid. Every Wednesday evening and every Sunday, GE held concerts for his friends and family. He frequently entertained lavish events, despite his inherent shyness.\n\nBut no matter how much he spent on himself, he gave most of his wealth away. He did not believe in leaving money for a foundation; he wanted to \u201csee the action\u201d himself. A list of his activities and charities would fill a book. He began free dentistry clinics for poor children in Rochester, believing that prevention was as important as curative work. He expanded this system across the capitals of Europe. A lifelong Republican, he fought his old friend the Republican mayor to press through a city-manager system of government which he believed to be more efficient. He supported Margaret Sanger\u2019s birth control movement. He gave massive amounts of money to the black Tuskegee and Hampton Institutes at the urging of his friend Booker T. Washington. He led the campaign for and designed the Chamber of Commerce building in Rochester, and did the same for orphanages, hospitals, the YMCA, and many other local projects. As he finished each project, he would write, \u201cMy work in this area is done\u201d and move his money on to the next idea.\n\nIn 1924, he became enamored with the idea of a better calendar\u2014in Eastman\u2019s mind, there was always a better way to do things. British statistician Moses Cotsworth had come up with a year of thirteen months of twenty-eight days each, the extra month falling between June and July and named \u201cSol,\u201d along with one extra day at the end of each year, a \u201cPeace Day\u201d holiday. Compared to the standard Gregorian calendar, the Cotsworth system meant that weekly, monthly, and annual sales and other records were directly comparable, with the number of weekends the same in each month. Eastman Kodak adopted the system in 1928 and used it until 1989.\n\nThe dedication of \u201cMr. Smith\u2019s\u201d MIT campus\n\nIn perhaps his most audacious move, in 1913 he financed an entire new campus for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), from which he had hired some of his best chemists. However, he asked that his $3 million gift remain anonymous for as long as possible, so the university announced that a \u201cMr. Smith\u201d had funded the new campus. Newspapers raged with rumors as to who Mr. Smith might be. No one suspected Eastman, who was not yet known nationally as a philanthropist. At the same time, Eastman, who always had a prankish nature, gave the university $300,000 for one building, and let them publicize his name. When the buildings opened in 1916, events were held around the United States to celebrate. As a $300,000 donor, Eastman attended the Rochester gathering, where he joined others in praising the unknown Mr. Smith. With later gifts of Kodak stock, Eastman\u2019s role became public knowledge. His gifts to MIT eventually totaled $20 million.\n\nOne of the projects he loved most was the Eastman Theater. He spent about $17 million building the 3,500-seat theater, one of the most beautiful in the United States. His visionary scheme was to show silent movies backed by an organ and fifty-member orchestra six days a week, then use the proceeds to finance the Symphony Orchestra which played serious music once a week in the same hall. He believed that the world had enough performers but needed more (educated) listeners. He visited the theater each evening to count the receipts, and often previewed movies until two in the morning. He made the concerts accessible to all. But when talkies replaced silent movies, the revenue concept failed, one of his bigger disappointments.\n\nInside Eastman Theater\n\nEastman also drove the creation of the Eastman School of Music, drawing the finest students and teachers from around the world, but also offering free or inexpensive music classes to local children. In recent years, the Eastman School of Music has been rated #1 in the United States, continuing his legacy of excellence.\n\nThe University of Rochester campus\n\nAbove all else, Eastman drove the development of the University of Rochester, picking the best university president, and building a new campus. His lifetime gifts to the university, which absorbed the Eastman School of Music, totaled $50 million.\n\nTaken together, between 1910 and 1932, Eastman gave away about $100 million, the equivalent of $1.2 billion in today\u2019s dollars. In most cases, his gifts depended on others putting up additional funds, a very modern approach to philanthropy.\n\nGoing out with a Bang\n\nEastman was stoic about death. He did not fear it. Throughout his life, he refused to support religious charities, believing them worthwhile but not subscribing to their beliefs himself. He might be considered an ethical humanist in today\u2019s language. Given his shy nature, when he retired from the company, he said, \u201cI just want to fade away, not go out with a bang.\u201d But that is not quite how things turned out.\n\nBy the end of the 1920s, he had become less able to travel. Heart disease, a spinal ailment, and other infirmities held him back. He had trouble walking. Having been active and energetic all his life, his spirits sunk. Reading his biography, one must believe his condition worsened when his nurses and housekeepers kept his old friends away, or limited their visits.\n\nWhen his doctor came to visit, he asked him to draw an outline on his chest where his heart was.\n\nOn Monday, March 14, 1932, at the age of seventy-seven, he dictated a few letters and made final revisions to his will. After the others had left, he smoked one last Lucky Strike cigarette, folded a wet towel over his chest to prevent powder burns, and pointed a Luger automatic gun at the outline of his heart and pulled the trigger. He left a note,\n\nTo my friends\n\nMy work is done \u2013 Why wait?\n\nGE\n\nGeorge Eastman was cremated, as he believed cemeteries \u201ccluttered\u201d the landscape. At his funeral, per his wishes, the last organ piece was Gounod\u2019s triumphant \u201cMarche Romaine,\u201d unusual for a funeral. People and messages came from around the world to wish the old man off. His hundreds of old friends wept openly.\n\nThe Legacy of George Eastman\n\nThis writer has spent the last fifty-five years studying the business and other great men and women of the past and present. Each of these great people is fascinating, and often complex, almost beyond understanding. Today we honor the Jeff Bezos\u2019s and Elon Musk\u2019s of the world. In the past we have learned much from the stories of Andrew Carnegie and John Rockefeller, two of the very few philanthropists who gave away even more money than Eastman. Each of these great contributors to our life today had strengths and weaknesses. Edison was a great inventor but not such a successful entrepreneur and business builder. Thomas Watson Sr. of IBM was a great business builder but not a keen inventor. Henry Ford\u2019s affordable car gave freedom to people around the world, especially women, but he had personality flaws that eventually allowed General Motors to become far larger. Alfred Sloan who made General Motors great may have been the best manager in history, but he was not there at the beginning. Steve Jobs was a genius in many ways but not a very generous person.\n\nGeorge Eastman was different. He not only gave of his wealth, he gave of himself. He started with nothing and pursued a dream; not just a product or an invention, but a whole system that would allow \u201cany child\u201d to take photographs. Few technologies have had a greater impact on society than photography\u2014from solving crimes to promoting revolutions, from sharing movies around the globe to taking selfies. His company consistently made better products for lower prices, and provided wonderful jobs and careers. This complex man had an uncanny ability to move quickly between the broadest marketing and financial strategies to designing household improvements and making buildings stronger and better. It is hard to imagine anyone who has had a greater and more pervasive impact on our lives today.\n\nThe company he built may have been the first truly global powerhouse. It dominated its field not just in the United States, but in every corner of the world. In the late twentieth century, the yellow Kodak emblem could be found in the remotest villages on earth.\n\nOver time, his great company went into decline. While Eastman Kodak developed the first digital camera, successive leaders failed to make the transition from film to digital. Sales in 2005 were $11 billion, but by 2012 they had declined to $4 billion. The next year the company went bankrupt and was broken into pieces. The famous lines of Kodak film are no longer manufactured, though Eastman Chemical continues to thrive. Much has been written on the company\u2019s decline. But we must remember that technology companies, by definition, are likely to have short lives. IBM\u2019s glory days did not last forever. RCA, the world\u2019s top consumer electronics company, is no more. Sony is in decline as new competitors arise from Korea and China. Only time will tell if today\u2019s crop of great technology companies can live strong and generously for over one hundred years, as did George Eastman\u2019s company.\n\nNevertheless, it appears certain that MIT, the Tuskegee Institute, the University of Rochester with its Eastman School of Music, and his many buildings in Rochester will survive the test of time\u2014as will the many other contributions made by others made wealthy by Kodak stock, such as Rochester\u2019s world-class Museum of Play.\n\nGary Hoover\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nThis biographical sketch is based on the excellent and exhaustive biography of Eastman, George Eastman: A Biography, written by Elizabeth Brayer in 2006.\n\nThis article first appeared on January 24, 2018 in The Archbridge Institute\u2019s \u2018American Originals\u2018 series.\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nJoin thousands of monthly readers and subscribe to my newsletter \u2013 I write and send you articles like these \u2013 click here to sign up."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Eastman", "page_content": "Explore the life and inventions of George Eastman through a tour of the museum on his estate See all videos for this article\n\nGeorge Eastman, (born July 12, 1854, Waterville, New York, U.S.\u2014died March 14, 1932, Rochester, New York), American entrepreneur and inventor whose introduction of the first Kodak camera helped to promote amateur photography on a large scale.\n\nAfter his education in the public schools of Rochester, New York, Eastman worked briefly for an insurance company and a bank. In 1880 he perfected a process of making dry plates for photography and organized the Eastman Dry Plate and Film Company for their manufacture. The first Kodak (a name he coined) camera was placed on the market in 1888. It was a simple handheld box camera containing a 100-exposure roll of film that used paper negatives. Consumers sent the entire camera back to the manufacturer for developing, printing, and reloading when the film was used up; the company\u2019s slogan was \u201cYou press the button, we do the rest.\u201d In 1889 Eastman introduced roll film on a transparent base, which has remained the standard for film. In 1892 he reorganized the business as the Eastman Kodak Company. Eight years later he introduced the Brownie camera, which was intended for use by children and sold for one dollar. By 1927 Eastman Kodak had a virtual monopoly of the photographic industry in the United States, and it has continued to be one of the largest American companies in its field.\n\nBritannica Quiz Electronics & Gadgets Quiz\n\nEastman gave away half his fortune in 1924. His gifts, which totaled more than $75 million, went to such beneficiaries as the University of Rochester (of which the Eastman School of Music is a part) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was also one of the first business owners to introduce profit sharing as an employee incentive. Eastman took his own life at age 77, leaving a note that said, \u201cMy work is done. Why wait?\u201d His home in Rochester, now known as George Eastman House, has become a renowned archive and museum of international photography as well as a popular tourist site."}, {"url": "https://moneyinc.com/gabriel-weinberg/", "page_content": "Gabriel Weinberg is an American businessman and entrepreneur who founded the Duck Duck Go company.

Here are 10 things you didn\u2019t know about Gabriel Weinberg that might inspire you on your journey.\n\n1. Gabriel Weinberg founded DuckDuckGo in 2007\n\nWeinberg has achieved success at an early age. He launched DuckDuckGo in 2007. It\u2019s an internet business that provides users with tools for online privacy to prevent hackers and advertisers from tracking them and obtaining personal information.\n\nThe company provides a non-tracking alternative to Google search. Users have access to the DuckDuckGo desktop browser extension and a mobile privacy browser for private web browsing without being tracked. The company has been in business for more than 13 years, according to Crunchbase.\n\n2. He started DuckDuckGo in his basement\n\nGabriel didn\u2019t have a lot of capital to finance his business. He started the company from his basement. It is entirely self-funded. What began as a one-man business has since grown into an operation that employs 50 staff members. The current annual revenue that it brings in is more than $25 million. The company has employees stationed across several continents and has gone international.\n\n3. He made time to have a family\n\nGabriel has been a busy guy. He is the founder as well as the chief executive officer of DuckDuckGo. His role in executive leadership keeps him busy running the multimillion-dollar business, but he has also made time to enjoy a wonderful personal life.\n\nWork and money are both essential for success, but he found the balance between work and home life to have success in both areas of his life. He is married. He and his wife have children and they live together at their home in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania\n\n4. DuckDuckGo isn\u2019t his first business\n\nAccording to Forbes, Weinberg founded another company before DuckDuckGo. In 2000, he launched Learnection which was an educational software company. The goal of the business was to help involve parents more in their children\u2019s education and in schools.\n\n5. His first business failed\n\nGabriel learned a lot about business during his first attempt at entrepreneurship. The 2000 company called Learnection was founded with money that his grandmother had left Weinberg. it paid for his college tuition and some of it was leftover to start his new internet business.\n\nWeinberg admitted that he made some mistakes in structuring his first business. His first error was hiring friends because they were people he liked. They weren\u2019t suitable for the positions he put them in. Gabriel also had decision-making issues. He was slow to make important decisions and it eventually led to the failure of Learnection.\n\n6. Gabriel is a serial entrepreneur\n\nWeinberg continued to move forward after the failure of Learnection. He didn\u2019t let it dampen his spirits or keep him down. He did what he needed to do and that realized he\u2019d made some mistakes.\n\nWeinberg learned from them so he could avoid repeating them in the future. He got back into the mainstream and continued to establish other companies. He founded NamesDatabase, an early social networking company to help users find old friends and classmates. Weinberg built up the business and then he sold it for $10 million in 2006 to classmates.com.\n\n7. Weinberg is an MIT graduate\n\nBefore Gabriel Weinberg started launching new tech startups, he took care of the business of getting an education. This is a foundational step that helps entrepreneurs to have a sense of where to start and how to successfully run a business. It also provides you with the necessary skills needed in your chosen career path.\n\nGabriel earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in physics from MIT in just 3 years, graduating in 2001. He continued on at MIT to earn his master\u2019s degree in 2005, according to LinkedIn. He was also a member of the Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Pi Sigma fraternities.\n\n8. He is a writer\n\nWeinberg co-authored two books. The first was titled \u201cTraction.\u201d The book was released in 2014. It was followed by his second release titled \u201cSuper Thinking\u201d released in May of 2018. In both titles, he shares his wisdom about how to get ahead in your chosen career.\n\n9. Gabriel Weinberg believes in using mental models\n\nAccording to Medium, Weinberg believes in using mental models to understand the dynamics of behavioral economics and how they apply to business and investing. He describes common mistakes and carelessness that can undermine our business plans and how we can choose from the tens of thousands of these mental models and apply them to achieve greater success.\n\n10. Gabriel is a lifelong learner\n\nGabriel Weinberg\u2019s writing reflects the belief that we need to continue learning if we want to be successful. He hones in on three key areas where we must continue our personal growth.\n\nThese include choosing from the most appropriate and suitable mental model for our experiences, enrolling in coursework, receiving mentoring from experts, and gaining first-hand experience. Some of these suggestions are included in the book that he co-authored titled \u201cSuper Thinking: The Big Book of Mental Models.\n\nHis participation in the writing of this book was inspired by a 1995 work by Charlie Munger that helped to open up his eyes and his mind to the power of our thoughts and the actions that follow. It led him to conduct his own research and delve further into the possibilities for constructing mental models to fit each situation.\n\nYou can also read:"}, {"url": "https://enterpriseleague.com/blog/business-role-models/", "page_content": "You\u2019ll notice this list is made of just as much female business role models as male ones.

From the thirteenth century through the middle of the seventeenth, the Wessyngton/Washington family was prominent in areas of Northern England, and its members were successful as farmers, merchants, and in other jobs that carried status. George\u2019s great-great-grandfather, Lawrence Washington, was born in Northamptonshire in 1604 and became a pastor.\n\n\n\nIn Europe and later in colonial America, colleges existed primarily to prepare young men to be ministers. Lawrence studied at Oxford University\u2019s Brasenose College, receiving his degree in 1623. Ten years later, he would become the rector, or administrative leader, of the church of the affluent village of Purleigh in the county of Essex. Lawrence\u2019s son, and George\u2019s great-grandfather, John Washington was born in Purleigh in 1634.1\n\n\n\nWhen the English Civil War broke out in the 1640s, the Washingtons were squarely on the side of the king, and the family suffered greatly because of it. When Essex was captured by Puritans fighting for Parliamentary rule, the Rev. Lawrence Washington was stripped of his clerical position and given the lowly position of vicar, an assistant cleric, at the poor parish of Little Braxted in Essex.2\n\n\n\nLawrence Washington died in poverty in 1654, and all hope for his children seemed to be dashed. But his eldest son, John, proved to be very resourceful. After serving as apprentice to a merchant who imported tobacco from the American colonies, John entered the trade himself, investing in a ship and sailing to Virginia.3 Bad fortune seemed to follow John as a harrowing winter storm sank the ship and all its cargo in the Potomac River on its return voyage. But John took this as a sign that he should stay in Virginia for good and immediately went to work to build his fortune in the new colony.4\n\n\n\nBiographer Ron Chernow notes the parallels between John Washington\u2019s ascent in America and that of his great-grandson George. \u201cOne marvels at the speed at which the young man prospered in the New World, exhibiting certain traits\u2014a bottomless appetite for land, an avidity for public office, and a zest for frontier combat\u2014that foreshadowed his great-grandson\u2019s rapid ascent in the world.\u201d5 John acquired land at a rapid pace, both from wheeling and dealing for deserted lands and small forests and through the \u201cheadright\u201d system by which a colonist received a land grant for bringing over settlers at his own expense. John would accumulate more than 10,000 acres in his lifetime and would operate a mill and a tavern. John would also serve in Virginia\u2019s colonial legislative body, the House of Burgesses.6\n\n\n\nIn addition, John started another Washington family tradition that would be carried on by his great-grandsons Lawrence and George: advancing socially and economically by \u201cmarrying up.\u201d The Washingtons were hard working and enterprising and they attracted wealthy women with their ambition.\n\n\n\nJohn married Anne Pope, whose father, Colonel Nathaniel Pope, was a prosperous tobacco planter. They had three children, the eldest of whom, Lawrence, would become George Washington\u2019s grandfather. Lawrence didn\u2019t add that much land to his inheritance\u2014only about 400 acres\u2014but he too married well. Lawrence wed Mildred Warner, daughter of wealthy Gloucester County tobacco planter Augustine Warner, Jr. In 1694, Lawrence and Mildred would give Augustine\u2019s name to their second son, who would become the father of our first president.\n\n\n\nAugustine Washington didn\u2019t inherit much, as by custom and the law of primogeniture the firstborn son most often inherited the bulk of the estate. Augustine received 1,100 acres\u2014not an insignificant amount of land, but a fraction of his father\u2019s holdings. But he did inherit the ambition of his grandfather John Washington. And he developed some savvy about profiting from economic changes that was transmitted to his son George.\n\n\n\nWhen Augustine wed Jane Butler she brought 600 acres of land under his control.7 With this as a foundation, he began purchasing and trading land to build his estate.\n\n\n\nAugustine was one of the first to figure out that in the coming industrial age, a land\u2019s value would be determined not just by the crops it could grow, but by the resources that could be extracted from it. The early 1700s was the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain, and the number one material to keep that revolution going was iron, something of which Britain was in short supply.\n\n\n\nThe colonists found iron in Virginia shortly after they established the first permanent English settlement in Jamestown in 1607. The next year, colony leader Captain John Smith wrote to a friend in England that \u201cYron\u201d was Jamestown\u2019s \u201cbest commoditie\u201d and said that \u201clittle chissels\u201d had already been made from an iron ore deposit there.8 Virginia colonists found a few more deposits in the coming years, but it would be another century before there would be significant enough production for export. Events across the ocean\u2014in both Great Britain and far-off destinations such as Sweden and Russia\u2014would lead to an iron boom in Virginia that would shape the life of the man who would become the first American president.\n\n\n\nThroughout the seventeenth century, England relied heavily on imports of raw iron from Sweden to meet its manufacturing needs, including ships for the British navy. But in the early years of the eighteenth century, Sweden\u2019s iron exports dropped dramatically due to the effects of the Great Northern War, which pitted the Swedish Empire against Russia. Sweden also hiked export duties on iron from 10 to 25 percent to raise revenue for the war. These factors caused Swedish iron exports to Great Britain to virtually cease by 1718, and they only slowly recovered after Sweden and Russia ceased hostilities in 1721.9 Desperate for another source of iron, the British looked to spur action in colonies where ore deposits had been found.\n\n\n\nIn 1720, a group of British investors formed the Principio Company to acquire land in colonies with iron ore deposits and to build blast furnaces to smelt the ore into iron bars. The iron would then be shipped back to Great Britain to be made into finished goods. In 1722, Principio began construction of an iron mine and furnace in Cecil County, Maryland, near the border of neighboring Delaware.\n\n\n\nPrincipio\u2019s agents and others looking to get rich prospected for iron ore across the Mid-Atlantic colonies. Deposits were soon found along the Accokeek Creek in Northern Virginia, where Augustine Washington owned property.\n\n\n\nPrincipio tried to buy this land on the cheap, offering Augustine cash and some of his favorite wine to sweeten the deal. But Augustine proved himself to be a brilliant negotiator and entrepreneur in his own right. He acquired all the nearby land with iron that he could. Then he agreed to build a furnace on one of his properties.\n\n\n\nIn return, Augustine asked for an ownership stake in the Principio Company, giving him one-sixth of the firm\u2019s profits and an opt-out clause to negotiate an even better contract should Principio achieve success.10\n\n\n\nThe ore used in furnaces in Maryland and Virginia was a coarse, dark-brown sandstone native to the region. A sledgehammer broke the ore into small pieces. Charcoal\u2014made by colliers who burned wood in nearby forests\u2014served as fuel, and oyster shells removed impurities as the ore was transformed into molten metal. Once a fire was started, precise quantities of charcoal, ore, and oyster shells were added to the furnace every few minutes.11\n\n\n\nAlthough George Washington would never come into full possession of either the iron-making property or his father\u2019s share in the Principio Company, his life was shaped to a significant degree by his father\u2019s iron venture. George would make and acquire new tools made of iron material, such as plows, while the smelting facility on Augustine\u2019s land foreshadowed the \u201cindustrial village\u201d George would create at Mount Vernon. A ban on manufacturing of iron products in the colonies imposed by Great Britain some three decades later would stoke Washington\u2019s first thoughts of armed revolt.12\n\n\n\nAs Augustine\u2019s fortunes increased, however, he would also suffer personal tragedy. To finalize the details of the contract with Principio, Augustine traveled to London and took along his two young sons, Lawrence and Augustine, Jr., leaving behind Jane and their four-year-old daughter, also named Jane. With a lucrative contract from Principio in hand, he enrolled his sons in the prestigious Appleby boarding school in Leicestershire, England. Upon returning to Virginia in the spring of 1730, however, he discovered that his wife had suddenly died the previous November, leaving him a widower with three children to look after.\n\n\n\nWithin a year, Augustine would marry 23-year-old Mary Ball, the strong-willed woman who would become George Washington\u2019s mother. Mary had some wealth in land and livestock, but she had also experienced her share of hard knocks.\n\n\n\nAugustine was about 15 years older than Mary. But the difference in ages of Mary\u2019s own parents was much larger than that. Her father, Joseph Ball, a plantation owner and lieutenant colonel in the Lancaster County militia, was a 58-year-old widower and the father of adult children when he married Mary\u2019s mother, a young widow with two children of her own. Joseph died in his early sixties when Mary was three. Her mother remarried and then died when Mary was 12, after which she was shuttled around to live with different relatives. Mary survived this instability by developing a strong independent streak. Her toughness may have turned off other suitors\u201423 was an \u201cold maid\u201d age in a time when most women married in their teens\u2014but she was probably just what Augustine needed.\n\n\n\nOverseeing the iron furnaces and dealing with the British co-owners of Principio meant that Augustine was away much of the time, and Mary was left to run the homestead, which was its own small-business enterprise. According to Lengel, Mary\u2019s responsibilities included \u201coverseeing and keeping accounts; directing purchase from everything from food to furniture, clothes, and home improvements and repairs; instructing slaves and workmen; and seeing to the children\u2019s needs, discipline and education.\u201d Mary and Augustine would soon have a big brood to look after. Their firstborn child would be a boy they named George.\n\n\n\nThe father of our country took his first breath on February 22, 1732, in a house that his father had built along Pope\u2019s Creek in Westmoreland County, part of Virginia\u2019s Northern Neck Peninsula that sits between the Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers. George would soon be followed by his sister Betty and brothers Samuel, John, and Charles. Augustine and Mary\u2019s sixth child, Mildred, would die during infancy. In 1735 George\u2019s older half-sister Jane would also die, at age 12.\n\n\n\nWhen George was two, the Washingtons moved about 70 miles north to land on the banks of the Potomac bordered by the Little Hunting and Dogue Run creeks. The land had been in George\u2019s family since his great-grandfather received it through a grant from Lord Thomas Culpeper. Augustine purchased the property from his sister Mildred in 1726.13\n\n\n\nThis land would one day be christened Mount Vernon and would become the base of George Washington\u2019s many agricultural, industrial, and entrepreneurial endeavors. But he would only acquire the land through his own diligent efforts and a series of twists and turns. George Washington\u2019s career as an entrepreneur would begin some 40 miles south of Mount Vernon, on a farm that was much more modest.\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 by John Berlau"}, {"url": "https://www.webofbio.com/george-farmer/", "page_content": "Who is George Farmer?\n\nHe is a well-known businessman who hails from a prominent British family.
