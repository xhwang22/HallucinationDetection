Featuring the first graphical user interface (GUI) for IBM-compatible PCs, the Windows OS soon dominated the PC market. Approximately 90 percent of PCs run some version of Windows.\n\nThe first version of Windows, released in 1985, was simply a GUI offered as an extension of Microsoft\u2019s existing disk operating system, or MS-DOS. Based in part on licensed concepts that Apple Inc. had used for its Macintosh System Software, Windows for the first time allowed DOS users to visually navigate a virtual desktop, opening graphical \u201cwindows\u201d displaying the contents of electronic folders and files with the click of a mouse button, rather than typing commands and directory paths at a text prompt.\n\nBritannica Quiz Computers and Operating Systems\n\nSubsequent versions introduced greater functionality, including native Windows File Manager, Program Manager, and Print Manager programs, and a more dynamic interface. Microsoft also developed specialized Windows packages, including the networkable Windows for Workgroups and the high-powered Windows NT, aimed at businesses. The 1995 consumer release Windows 95 fully integrated Windows and DOS and offered built-in Internet support, including the World Wide Web browser Internet Explorer.\n\nWith the 2001 release of Windows XP, Microsoft united its various Windows packages under a single banner, offering multiple editions for consumers, businesses, multimedia developers, and others. Windows XP abandoned the long-used Windows 95 kernel (core software code) for a more powerful code base and offered a more practical interface and improved application and memory management. The highly successful XP standard was succeeded in late 2006 by Windows Vista, which experienced a troubled rollout and met with considerable marketplace resistance, quickly acquiring a reputation for being a large, slow, and resource-consuming system. Responding to Vista\u2019s disappointing adoption rate, Microsoft in 2009 released Windows 7, an OS whose interface was similar to that of Vista but was met with enthusiasm for its noticeable speed improvement and its modest system requirements.\n\nWindows 8 in 2012 offered a start screen with applications appearing as tiles on a grid and the ability to synchronize settings so users could log on to another Windows 8 machine and use their preferred settings. In 2015 Microsoft released Windows 10, which came with Cortana, a digital personal assistant like Apple\u2019s Siri, and the Web browser Microsoft Edge, which replaced Internet Explorer. Microsoft also announced that Windows 10 would be the last version of Windows, meaning that users would receive regular updates to the OS but that no more large-scale revisions would be done."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/02/from-windows-1-to-windows-10-29-years-of-windows-evolution", "page_content": "Microsoft Windows has seen nine major versions since its first release in 1985. Over 29 years later, Windows looks very different but somehow familiar with elements that have survived the test of time, increases in computing power and \u2013 most recently \u2013 a shift from the keyboard and mouse to the touchscreen.\n\nHere\u2019s a brief look at the history of Windows, from its birth at the hands of Bill Gates with Windows 1 to the latest arrival under new Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella.\n\nWindows 1\n\nThe first version of Windows. Photograph: Wikipedia\n\nThis is where it all started for Windows. The original Windows 1 was released in November 1985 and was Microsoft\u2019s first true attempt at a graphical user interface in 16-bit.\n\nDevelopment was spearheaded by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and ran on top of MS-DOS, which relied on command-line input.\n\nIt was notable because it relied heavily on use of a mouse before the mouse was a common computer input device. To help users become familiar with this odd input system, Microsoft included a game, Reversi (visible in the screenshot) that relied on mouse control, not the keyboard, to get people used to moving the mouse around and clicking onscreen elements.\n\nWindows 2\n\nWindows 2 with overlapping windows. Photograph: Wikipedia\n\nTwo years after the release of Windows 1, Microsoft\u2019s Windows 2 replaced it in December 1987. The big innovation for Windows 2 was that windows could overlap each other, and it also introduced the ability to minimise or maximise windows instead of \u201ciconising\u201d or \u201czooming\u201d.\n\nThe control panel, where various system settings and configuration options were collected together in one place, was introduced in Windows 2 and survives to this day.\n\nMicrosoft Word and Excel also made their first appearances running on Windows 2.\n\nWindows 3\n\nWindows 3.0 got colourful.\n\nThe first Windows that required a hard drive launched in 1990. Windows 3 was the first version to see more widespread success and be considered a challenger to Apple\u2019s Macintosh and the Commodore Amiga graphical user interfaces, coming pre-installed on computers from PC-compatible manufacturers including Zenith Data Systems.\n\nWindows 3 introduced the ability to run MS-DOS programmes in windows, which brought multitasking to legacy programmes, and supported 256 colours bringing a more modern, colourful look to the interface.\n\nMore important - at least to the sum total of human time wasted - it introduced the card-moving timesink (and mouse use trainer) Solitaire.\n\nWindows 3.1\n\nWindows 3.1 with Minesweeper. Photograph: Wikipedia\n\nWindows 1 and 2 both had point release updates, but Windows 3.1 released in 1992 is notable because it introduced TrueType fonts making Windows a viable publishing platform for the first time.\n\nMinesweeper also made its first appearance. Windows 3.1 required 1MB of RAM to run and allowed supported MS-DOS programs to be controlled with a mouse for the first time. Windows 3.1 was also the first Windows to be distributed on a CD-ROM, although once installed on a hard drive it only took up 10 to 15MB (a CD can typically store up to 700MB).\n\nWindows 95\n\nWindows 95: oh hello Start menu.\n\nAs the name implies, Windows 95 arrived in August 1995 and with it brought the first ever Start button and Start menu (launched with a gigantic advertising campaign that used the Rolling Stones\u2019 Start Me Up, and a couple of months later Friends stars Jennifer Aniston and Matthew Perry. Could it be any more up-to-date?)\n\nIt also introduced the concept of \u201cplug and play\u201d \u2013 connect a peripheral and the operating system finds the appropriate drivers for it and makes it work. That was the idea; it didn\u2019t always work in practice.\n\nWindows 95 also introduced a 32-bit environment, the task bar and focused on multitasking. MS-DOS still played an important role for Windows 95, which required it to run some programmes and elements.\n\nInternet Explorer also made its debut on Windows 95, but was not installed by default requiring the Windows 95 Plus! pack. Later revisions of Windows 95 included IE by default, as Netscape Navigator and NCSA Mosaic were popular at the time.\n\nWindows 98\n\nWindows 98, the last great DOS-based Windows. Photograph: Wikipedia\n\nReleased in June 1998, Windows 98 built on Windows 95 and brought with it IE 4, Outlook Express, Windows Address Book, Microsoft Chat and NetShow Player, which was replaced by Windows Media Player 6.2 in Windows 98 Second Edition in 1999.\n\nWindows 98 introduced the back and forward navigation buttons and the address bar in Windows Explorer, among other things. One of the biggest changes was the introduction of the Windows Driver Model for computer components and accessories \u2013 one driver to support all future versions of Windows.\n\nUSB support was much improved in Windows 98 and led to its widespread adoption, including USB hubs and USB mice.\n\nWindows ME\n\nWindows ME was one to skip. Photograph: Wikipedia\n\nConsidered a low point in the Windows series by many \u2013 at least, until they saw Windows Vista \u2013 Windows Millennium Edition was the last Windows to be based on MS-DOS, and the last in the Windows 9x line.\n\nReleased in September 2000, it was the consumer-aimed operating system twined with Windows 2000 aimed at the enterprise market. It introduced some important concepts to consumers, including more automated system recovery tools.\n\nIE 5.5, Windows Media Player 7 and Windows Movie Maker all made their appearance for the first time. Autocomplete also appeared in Windows Explorer, but the operating system was notorious for being buggy, failing to install properly and being generally poor.\n\nWindows 2000\n\nWindows 2000 was ME\u2019s enterprise twin. Photograph: Wikipedia\n\nThe enterprise twin of ME, Windows 2000 was released in February 2000 and was based on Microsoft\u2019s business-orientated system Windows NT and later became the basis for Windows XP.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s automatic updating played an important role in Windows 2000 and became the first Windows to support hibernation.\n\nWindows XP\n\nWindows XP still survives to this day. Photograph: Schrift-Architekt/flickr\n\nArguably one of the best Windows versions, Windows XP was released in October 2001 and brought Microsoft\u2019s enterprise line and consumer line of operating systems under one roof.\n\nIt was based on Windows NT like Windows 2000, but brought the consumer-friendly elements from Windows ME. The Start menu and task bar got a visual overhaul, bringing the familiar green Start button, blue task bar and vista wallpaper, along with various shadow and other visual effects.\n\nClearType, which was designed to make text easier to read on LCD screens, was introduced, as were built-in CD burning, autoplay from CDs and other media, plus various automated update and recovery tools, that unlike Windows ME actually worked.\n\nWindows XP was the longest running Microsoft operating system, seeing three major updates and support up until April 2014 \u2013 13 years from its original release date. Windows XP was still used on an estimated 430m PCs when it was discontinued.\n\nIts biggest problem was security: though it had a firewall built in, it was turned off by default. Windows XP\u2019s huge popularity turned out to be a boon for hackers and criminals, who exploited its flaws, especially in Internet Explorer, mercilessly - leading Bill Gates to initiate a \u201cTrustworthy Computing\u201d initiative and the subsequent issuance of to Service Pack updates that hardened XP against attack substantially.\n\nWindows Vista\n\nWindows Vista, arguably worse than Windows ME. Photograph: Microsoft\n\nWindows XP stayed the course for close to six years before being replaced by Windows Vista in January 2007. Vista updated the look and feel of Windows with more focus on transparent elements, search and security. Its development, under the codename \u201cLonghorn\u201d, was troubled, with ambitious elements abandoned in order to get it into production.\n\nIt was buggy, burdened the user with hundreds of requests for app permissions under \u201cUser Account Control\u201d - the outcome of the Trustworthy Computing initiative which now meant that users had to approve or disapprove attempts by programs to make various changes. The problem with UAC was that it led to complacency, with people clicking \u201cyes\u201d to almost anything - taking security back to the pre-UAC state. It also ran slowly on older computers despite them being deemed as \u201cVista Ready\u201d - a labelling that saw it sued because not all versions of Vista could run on PCs with that label.\n\nPC gamers saw a boost from Vista\u2019s inclusion of Microsoft\u2019s DirectX 10 technology.\n\nWindows Media Player 11 and IE 7 debuted, along with Windows Defender an anti-spyware programme. Vista also included speech recognition, Windows DVD Maker and Photo Gallery, as well as being the first Windows to be distributed on DVD. Later a version of Windows Vista without Windows Media Player was created in response to anti-trust investigations.\n\nWindows 7\n\nWindows 7 was everything Windows Vista should have been. Photograph: Wikipedia\n\nConsidered by many as what Windows Vista should have been, Windows 7 was first released in October 2009. It was intended to fix all the problems and criticism faced by Vista, with slight tweaks to its appearance and a concentration on user-friendly features and less \u201cdialogue box overload\u201d.\n\nIt was faster, more stable and easier to use, becoming the operating system most users and business would upgrade to from Windows XP, forgoing Vista entirely.\n\nHandwriting recognition debuted in 7, as did the ability to \u201csnap\u201d windows to the tops or sides of the screen, allowing faster more automatic window resizing.\n\nWindows 7 saw Microsoft hit in Europe with antitrust investigations over the pre-installing of IE, which led to a browser ballot screen being shown to new users allowing them to choose, which browser to install on first boot.\n\nWindows 8\n\nWindows 8 focused more on touch than a keyboard and mouse.\n\nReleased in October 2012, Windows 8 was Microsoft\u2019s most radical overhaul of the Windows interface, ditching the Start button and Start menu in favour of a more touch-friendly Start screen.\n\nThe new tiled interface saw programme icons and live tiles, which displayed at-a-glance information normally associated with \u201cwidgets\u201d, replace the lists of programmes and icons. A desktop was still included, which resembled Windows 7.\n\nWindows 8 was faster than previous versions of Windows and included support for the new, much faster USB 3.0 devices. The Windows Store, which offers universal Windows apps that run in a full-screen mode only, was introduced. Programs could still be installed from third-parties like other iterations of Windows, but they could only access the traditional desktop interface of Windows.\n\nThe radical overhaul was not welcomed by many. Microsoft attempted to tread a fine line between touchscreen support and desktop users, but ultimately desktop users wanting to control Windows with a traditional mouse and keyboard and not a touchscreen felt Windows 8 was a step back. There were also too few touchscreens in use, or on offer, to make its touch-oriented interface useful or even necessary - despite the parallel rise of tablets such as the iPad, and smartphones, which had begun outselling PCs by the end of 2010.\n\nWindows RT, which runs on ARM-based processors traditionally found in smartphones and non-PC tablets, was introduced at the same time as Windows 8 with the Microsoft Surface tablet. It looked and felt like Windows 8, but could not run traditional Windows applications, instead solely relying on the Windows Store for third-party apps.\n\nWindows 8.1\n\nWindows 8.1 and the great reappearance of the Start button.\n\nA free point release to Windows 8 introduced in October 2013, Windows 8.1 marked a shift towards yearly software updates from Microsoft and included the first step in Microsoft\u2019s U-turn around its new visual interface.\n\nWindows 8.1 re-introduced the Start button, which brought up the Start screen from the desktop view of Windows 8.1. Users could also choose to boot directly into the desktop of Windows 8.1, which was more suitable for those using a desktop computer with a mouse and keyboard than the touch-focused Start screen.\n\nWindows 10\n\nWindows 10 brings back the Start menu\n\nAnnounced on 30 September 2014, Windows 10 has only been released as a test version for keen users to try. The \u201ctechnical preview\u201d is very much still a work in progress.\n\nWindows 10 represents another step in Microsoft\u2019s U-turn, bringing back the Start menu and more balance to traditional desktop computer users.\n\nSome interesting features include the ability to switch between a keyboard and mouse mode and a tablet mode, for those computers like the Surface Pro 3 with a detachable keyboard.\n\nWindows 10 \u2013 despite being the ninth version of Windows \u2013 is designed to unify all Windows platforms across multiple devices, including Windows Phone and tablets, with universal apps that can be downloaded from the Windows Store and run on all Windows devices.\n\nIt won\u2019t be available until 2015, likely after Microsoft\u2019s Build developer conference in April, so for now Windows 8.1 is the latest version of Windows.\n\nMicrosoft unveils Windows 10: ten things to know"}, {"url": "https://www.lifewire.com/brief-history-of-microsoft-windows-3507078", "page_content": "From its initial release in 1985 through its ongoing active development in 2021 and beyond, Windows has been a major player in the consumer and corporate PC ecosystem. Here's a brief overview of every version of Windows.\n\nWindows 1.0\n\nReleased: Nov. 20, 1985\n\nReplaced: \u200bMS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System), although until Windows 95, Windows actually ran on top of MS-DOS instead of completely replacing it.\n\nInnovative/Notable: Windows. This was the first version of a Microsoft OS that you didn't have to enter commands to use. Instead, you could point and click in a box\u2014a window\u2014with a mouse. Bill Gates, then a young CEO, said of Windows: \u201cIt is unique software designed for the serious PC user.\u201d It took two years from the announcement to finally ship.\n\nObscure Fact: What we call Windows today was almost called \"Interface Manager.\" Interface Manager was the code name of the product and was a finalist for the official name. Doesn't have quite the same ring as \"Windows,\" does it?\n\nWindows 2.0\n\nReleased: Dec. 9, 1987\n\nReplaced: Windows 1.0. Windows 1.0 wasn't warmly received by critics, who felt it was slow and too mouse-focused. The mouse was relatively new to computing at the time.\n\nInnovative/Notable: Graphics were much improved, including the ability to overlap windows (in Windows 1.0, separate windows could only be tiled). Desktop icons were also introduced, as were keyboard shortcuts.\n\nObscure Fact: Numerous applications made their debuts in Windows 2.0, including the Control Panel, Paint, Notepad, and two Microsoft Office cornerstones: Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel.\n\nWindows 3.0/3.1\n\nReleased: May 22, 1990. Windows 3.1: March 1, 1992.\n\nReplaced: Windows 2.0. It was more popular than Windows 1.0. Its overlapping Windows brought a lawsuit from Apple, which claimed that the new style infringed copyrights from the Apple GUI (Graphical User Interface).\n\nInnovative/Notable: Speed. Windows 3.0/3.1 ran faster than ever on new Intel 386 chips. The GUI improved with more colors and better icons. This version is also the first really big-selling Microsoft operating system, with more than 10 million copies sold. It also included new management abilities like Print Manager, File Manager, and Program Manager.\n\nObscure Fact: Windows 3.0 cost $149; upgrades from earlier versions were $50.\n\nWindows 95\n\nReleased: Aug. 24, 1995\n\nReplaced: Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS\n\nInnovative/Notable: Windows 95 is what really cemented Microsoft's dominance in the computer industry. It boasted a huge marketing campaign that captured the public's imagination in a way nothing computer-related ever had. More importantly, it introduced the Start menu, which ended up being so popular that its absence in Windows 8, some 17 years later, caused a major uproar among consumers. It also had internet support and plug-and-play capabilities that made it easier to install software and hardware.\n\nWindows 95 was an enormous hit right out of the gate, selling a staggering seven million copies in its first five weeks on sale.\n\nObscure Fact: Microsoft paid the Rolling Stones $3 million for the rights to Start Me Up, which was the theme at the unveiling.\n\nWindows 98/Windows ME (Millennium Edition)/Windows 2000\n\nMicrosoft\n\nReleased: These were released in a flurry between 1998 and 2000 and are lumped together because there wasn't much to distinguish them from Windows 95. They were essentially placeholders in Microsoft's lineup, and although popular, they didn't approach the record-breaking success of Windows 95. They were built on Windows 95, offering basically incremental upgrades.\n\nObscure Fact: Windows ME was an unmitigated disaster. However, Windows 2000\u2014despite not being terribly popular with home consumers\u2014reflected an important behind-the-scenes change in technology that aligned it more with Microsoft's server solutions. Parts of Windows 2000 technology remain in active use more than 20 years later.\n\nLifewire\n\nReleased: Oct. 25, 2001\n\nReplaced: Windows 2000\n\nInnovative/Notable: Windows XP is the superstar of this lineup\u2014the Michael Jordan of Microsoft operating systems. Its most innovative feature is that it refuses to die, remaining on a non-trivial number of PCs even several years after its official end-of-life sunset from Microsoft. Despite its age, it's still Microsoft's second-most-popular OS, behind Windows 7. That is a hard-to-grasp statistic.\n\nObscure Fact: By one estimate, Windows XP has sold more than one billion copies over the years.\n\nReleased: Jan. 30, 2007\n\nReplaced: Tried, and spectacularly failed, to replace Windows XP.\n\nInnovative/Notable: Vista is the anti-XP. Its name is synonymous with failure and ineptitude. When released, Vista required much better hardware to run than XP (which most people didn't have), and relatively few devices like printers and monitors worked with it because of the woeful lack of hardware drivers available at launch. It wasn't a terrible OS the way Windows ME was, but it tanked so hard that for most people, it was dead on arrival, and they stayed on XP instead.\n\nObscure Fact: Vista is No. 2 on Info World's list of top all-time tech flops.\n\nReleased: Oct. 22, 2009\n\nReplaced: Windows Vista, and not a moment too soon.\n\nInnovative/Notable: Windows 7 was a major hit with the public and earned a commanding market share of nearly 60 percent. It improved in every way on Vista and helped the public eventually forget the OS version of the Titanic. It's stable, secure, graphically friendly, and easy to use.\n\nObscure Fact: In just eight hours, pre-orders of Windows 7 surpassed the total sales of Vista after 17 weeks.\n\nReleased: Oct. 26, 2012\n\nReplaced: Tried, and spectacularly failed, to replace Windows 7.\n\nInnovative/Notable: Microsoft knew it had to gain a foothold in the mobile world, including phones and tablets, but didn't want to give up on users of traditional desktops and laptops. So it tried to create a hybrid OS, one that would work equally well on touch and non-touch devices. It didn't work, for the most part. Users missed their Start menu and consistently expressed confusion about using Windows 8.\n\nMicrosoft released a significant update for Windows 8, dubbed Windows 8.1, which addressed many consumer concerns about the desktop tiles\u2014but for many users, the damage was done.\n\nObscure Fact: Microsoft called the Windows 8 user interface \"Metro,\" but had to scrap that name after threatened lawsuits from a European company. Microsoft then named the user interface \"Modern,\" but that wasn't warmly received either.\n\nWindows 10\n\nReleased: July 28, 2015\n\nReplaced: Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, and Windows XP\n\nInnovative/Notable: Two major things: first, the return of the Start menu. Second, Windows 10 will allegedly be the last-named version of Windows. Future updates will be delivered in semi-annual update packages, instead of distinct new versions.\n\nObscure Fact: Despite Microsoft's insistence that skipping Windows 9 was to emphasize that Windows 10 is the \"last version of Windows,\" speculation runs rampant and had been indirectly confirmed by Microsoft engineers, that many old programs had been lazy in checking Windows versions, so these programs would have misconstrued Windows 9 as being much older than it would have been.\n\nReleased: October 5, 2021\n\nReplaced: Windows 10\n\nInnovative/Notable: Windows 11 ushered in significant UI changes, including windows with rounded corners, an updated Start menu, and icons in the middle of the taskbar. You can also view battery usage statistics from the desktop, experience a more sophisticated right-click menu, and utilize Android apps. Also, in Windows 11, Edge takes over as the default browser.\n\nObscure Fact: On the surface, releasing Windows 11 seemed like an odd choice for Microsoft because of a pandemic-induced silicon shortage. Microsoft was concerned that they wouldn't be able to meet consumer demand for new hardware to run the OS. However, Microsoft was intent on improving security standards, and including high-level security protocols may have been the best way to up the baseline for security."}, {"url": "https://www.mindstick.com/articles/326090/the-history-of-windows-operating-system", "page_content": "It's been 35 years since Microsoft windows came into existence. Windows operating system is one of the most widespread operating systems that is exercised all over the world which was developed by Microsoft. Microsoft Windows was initially announced on November 10, 1983, by Bill Gates , and introduced a graphical user-friendly interface to the user.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we hear anything about windows or the operating system, Microsoft is the only brand that comes in our mind. In the beginning, we were supposed to use windows only on our computers but succeedingly later that we observe Windows on our mobile phones too and an up-gradation of the Windows 10 along with it. The main objective of Microsoft is to expand the windows 10 operating system in almost every country.\n\nThere are a lot of modifications and enhancements in Windows 8 by the expected users as the applicant choice. With the consequence of windows in the business, it\u2019s along with the computer, tablet and mobile phones.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe list of Microsoft Windows launched from Windows 1 to Windows 10?\n\nWindows 1, 1985\n\nThe earliest version of windows MS-DOS was called the Microsoft disk operating system which was the character-based operating system that was used in many computers but didn\u2019t get much success.\n\nWindows 2, 1987\n\nThis was the very first version of the operating system to access Microsoft Word and Microsoft excel.\n\nWindows 3, 1990\n\nWindows 3 covers all the early versions of MS-DOS which came out with the program manager and soon became the modern windows version.\n\nWindows 3.1, 1991\n\nWindow 3.1 arrives in the first decade of the 90s including IBM compatibility, and this matched the official version of that moment.\n\nWindows 95, 1995\n\nAs Windows 95 was out it became very famous, which took the world of operating systems at the top. It allows you the feature to place the icon wherever you like. Several more innovations such as internet explorer, Recycle bin, start button. All those icons appear to present on your desktop.\n\nWindows 98, 1998\n\nWindows 98 wasn't so different from windows 95, it almost worked the same as Windows 95, Therefore few upgrades happened.\n\nWindows AMD, 2000\n\nWindows AMD was not as much successful as expected, it didn\u2019t grasp the market, people got to know about the latest Windows XP so they waited for that.\n\nWindows CE, 2000\n\nMicrosoft has begun its new variant for mobile phones too which was also based on Windows CE. Microsoft created this by placing the windows logo and start button.\n\nWindows XP, 2001\n\nWindows XP was launched in the year 2001. Which became the fastest growing operating system by windows after the success of window 95.\n\nWindows Mobile 5.2005\n\nMicrosoft has initiated this added feature on Blackberry and Nokia handsets. It was progressing for the new versions of windows.\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Vista, 2006\n\nIt took almost 5 whole years to launch Windows Vista while developing websites there were so many errors, and it appears after the restoration of such errors, so the late launch was justified.\n\nWindows Mobile 6, 2007\n\nMicrosoft has originated Windows mobile 6 in the market which was 5 years old program. Microsoft Mobile 6 was launched in February 2007. iPhone also came into existence during that period of time. Integrated with the stylish-looking keyboard was still a loss comparing to iPhones.\n\nWindows 7, 2007\n\nWindows 7 uplifted all the errors of Windows Vista and came with the new name windows 6 view. This was an extremely powerful windows operating system. Several offices are still using this till now. This was supposed to upgrade windows 7 to windows 10.\n\nWindows Phone, 2010\n\nIn the year 2010 windows launched its all-new Windows phone. Embedded with so many features didn't grasp the market due to its tough competition against the iPhone.\n\nWindows 8 Tablets\n\nMicrosoft launched the new operating system with an upgraded UI in the market as Windows 8 after 30 years. Windows 8 contains full-fledged icons showing on the desktop without the start button which remain different from its all old versions.\n\nWindows 8 Desktop\n\nMicrosoft wasn\u2019t capable of bringing that operating system that used to operate on both tablet and PC. You have the option to easily upgrade Windows 8 to Windows 10.\n\nWindows Phone 8\n\nMicrosoft originated Windows 8 as the equivalent of the program of windows mobile phones. It has numerous features.\n\nWindows and Windows 8.1, 2014\n\nMicrosoft implements this characteristic such as computers, tablets, mobile updates back then in 2014. It possesses some modifications such as the start menu. Window 8.1 will be refreshed to windows 10.\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows 10"}, {"url": "https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/windows-operating-system-history/", "page_content": "The Windows operating system (Windows OS) refers to a family of operating systems developed by Microsoft Corporation. We look at the history of Windows OS from 1985 to present day.\n\nThe Windows operating system (Windows OS) for desktop PCs is more formally called Microsoft Windows and is actually a family of operating systems for personal computers. Windows has traditionally dominated the personal computer world, running, by some estimates, more than 75 percent of all personal computers. Beginning in the early 2000s, Windows dominance has lessened with the growth of the Linux and Mac operating systems.\n\nWindows provides a graphical user interface (GUI), virtual memory management, multitasking, and support for many peripheral devices. In addition to Windows operating systems for personal computers, Microsoft also offers operating systems for servers and mobile devices.\n\nWindows is also the foundation for the Microsoft Office productivity suite. Introduced in 1990 as a Windows-only family of applications for desktop computers, Office has grown to become the world\u2019s most widely used productivity suite, with windowscentral.com reporting an estimated 1.2 billion + user worldwide as of 2016.\n\nMicrosoft Windows Operating Systems for PCs\n\nThe following details the history of MS-DOS and Windows operating systems designed for personal computers (PCs).\n\nMS-DOS \u2013 Microsoft Disk Operating System\n\nRelease date: August 1981\n\nCost: $40 USD\n\nOriginally developed by Microsoft for IBM, MS-DOS was the standard operating system for IBM-compatible personal computers. The initial versions of DOS were very simple and resembled another operating system called CP/M. Subsequent versions have become increasingly sophisticated as they incorporated features of minicomputer operating systems.\n\nWindows 1.0\n\nSource: GUIdebook Gallery\n\nInitial release date: November 20, 1985\n\nCost: $99 USD\n\nIntroduced in 1985, Microsoft Windows 1.0 was named due to the computing boxes, or \u201cwindows\u201d that represented a fundamental aspect of the operating system. Instead of typing MS-DOS commands, Windows 1.0 allowed users to point and click to access the windows.\n\nWindows 2.0\n\nSource: GUIdebook Gallery\n\nInitial release date: December 9, 1987\n\nCost: $100 USD\n\nIn 1987 Microsoft released Windows 2.0, which was designed for the designed for the Intel 286 processor. This version added desktop icons, keyboard shortcuts and improved graphics support.\n\nWindows 3.0\n\nSource: GUIdebook Gallery\n\nInitial release date: May 22, 1990\n\nCost: $149.95 USD new; $79.95 USD upgrade\n\nWindows 3.0 was released in May, 1900 offering better icons, performance and advanced graphics with 16 colors designed for Intel 386 processors. This version was the first release that provided the standard \u201clook and feel\u201d of Microsoft Windows for many years to come. Windows 3.0 included Program Manager, File Manager, Print Manager and games like Hearts, Minesweeper, and Solitaire. Microsoft released Windows 3.1 in 1992.\n\nWindows NT 3.1 \u2013 4.0\n\nSource: GUIdebook Gallery\n\nInitial release date: July 27, 1993\n\nCost: $495 USD new; $295 USD upgrade\n\nWindows NT (New Technology) was a 32-bit operating system that supported preemptive multitasking. There are actually two versions of Windows NT: Windows NT Server, designed to act as a server in networks, and Windows NT Workstation for stand-alone or client workstations.\n\nWindows 95\n\nSource: GUIdebook Gallery\n\nInitial release date: August 24, 1995\n\nCost: $209.95 USD new; $109.95 USD upgrade\n\nWindows 95 was a major upgrade to the Windows operating system. This OS was a significant advancement over its precursor, Windows 3.1. In addition to sporting a new user interface, Windows 95 also included a number of important internal improvements. Perhaps most important, it supported 32-bit applications, which meant that applications written specifically for this operating system would run much faster.\n\nAlthough Windows 95 was able to run older Windows and DOS applications, it essentially removed DOS as the underlying platform. This resulted in the removal of many of the old DOS limitations, such as 640K of main memory and 8-character filenames. Other important features in this operating system were the ability to automatically detect and configure installed hardware (Plug-and-Play).\n\nWindows 98\n\nSource: GUIdebook Gallery\n\nInitial release date: June 25, 1998\n\nCost: $209.95 USD new; $109.95 USD upgrade\n\nWindows 98 supported a number of new technologies, including FAT32, AGP, MMX, USB, DVD, and ACPI. Its most visible feature, though, was the Active Desktop, which integrated the Web browser (Internet Explorer) with the operating system. From the user\u2019s point of view, there was no difference between accessing a document residing locally on the user\u2019s hard disk or on a Web server halfway around the world.\n\nWindows 2000\n\nSource: GUIdebook Gallery\n\nInitial release date: February 17, 2000\n\nCost: $319 USD new; $149 USD upgrade\n\nOften abbreviated as \u201cW2K,\u201d Windows 2000 was an operating system for business desktop and laptop systems to run software applications, connect to Internet and intranet sites, and access files, printers, and network resources. Microsoft released four versions of Windows 2000: Professional (for business desktop and laptop systems); Server (both a Web server and an office server); Advanced Server (for line-of-business applications); and Datacenter Server (for high-traffic computer networks).\n\nWindows Millennium Edition (ME)\n\nSource: GUIdebook Gallery\n\nInitial release date: June 19, 2000\n\nCost: $209 USD new; $109 USD upgrade\n\nThe Windows Millennium Edition, called \u201cWindows Me\u201d was an update to the Windows 98 core and included some features that would be part of the Windows 2000 operating system. This version also removed the \u201cBoot in DOS\u201d option.\n\nWindows XP\n\nSource: GUIdebook Gallery\n\nInitial release date: October 25, 2001\n\nCost:\n\nHome: $199 USD new; $99 USD upgrade\n\nProfessional: $299 USD new; $199 upgrade\n\nWindows XP was released in 2001. Along with a redesigned look and feel to the user interface, the new operating system was built on the Windows 2000 kernel, giving the user a more stable and reliable environment than previous versions of Windows. Windows XP came in two versions, Home and Professional. Microsoft focused on mobility for both editions and including plug-and-play features for connecting to wireless networks. The operating system also utilized the 802.11x wireless security standard. Windows XP went on to become one of Microsoft\u2019s best-selling products.\n\nWindows Vista\n\nSource: GUIdebook Gallery\n\nInitial release date: November 30, 2006 (corporate); January 30, 2007 (public)\n\nCost:\n\nHome Basic: $199 USD new; $99.95 USD upgrade\n\nHome Premium: $239 USD new; $159 USD upgrade\n\nBusiness: $299 USD new; $199 upgrade\n\nUltimate: $399 USD new; $259 USD upgrade\n\nWindows Vista offered an advancement in reliability, security, ease of deployment, performance and manageability over Windows XP. New in this version were capabilities to detect hardware problems before they occurred, security features to protect against the latest generation of threats, a faster start-up time, and low power consumption when placed in the new sleep state. In many cases, Windows Vista was noticeably more responsive than Windows XP on identical hardware. Windows Vista simplified and centralized desktop configuration management, which reduced the cost of keeping systems updated.\n\nWindows 7\n\nSource: Lifewire\n\nInitial release date: October 22, 2009\n\nCost:\n\nHome Premium: $199.99 USD new; $119.99 USD upgrade\n\nBusiness: $299.99 USD new; $199.99 upgrade\n\nUltimate: $319.99 USD new; $219.99 USD upgrade\n\nWindows 7 was released in conjunction with Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7\u2019s server counterpart.

Windows 10 featured fast start-up and resume, built-in security, and the return of the Start Menu in an expanded form. This version of Windows also featured Microsoft Edge, Microsoft\u2019s new browser. Any qualified device (such as tablets, PCs, smartphones and Xbox consoles) was able to upgrade to Windows 10, including those with pirated copies of Windows.\n\nWindows 11\n\nSource: PCMag\n\nInitial release date: October 5, 2021\n\nCost: Free (for Windows 10 users)\n\nThough Microsoft claimed Windows 10 would be the last version of Windows ever, Windows 11 came with a new visual design, updated apps, touchscreen optimizations, and multitasking features. Microsoft also claims Windows 11 is the most secure release yet. Existing Windows 10 users will be able to upgrade to Windows 11 for free as long as their PC meets the system requirements.\n\nMicrosoft Operating Systems for Servers and Mobile Devices\n\nAside from operating systems designed for use on personal computers (PCs) and laptops, Microsoft has also developed operating systems for servers, handheld devices, and mobile phones.\n\nWindows Server\n\nInitial release date: May 28, 2003\n\nWindows Server is a series of Microsoft server operating systems. Windows servers are more powerful versions of their desktop operating system counterparts and are designed to more efficiently handle corporate networking, internet/intranet hosting, databases, enterprise-scale messaging and similar functions. The Windows Server name made its debut with the release of Windows Server 2003 and continues with the current release, Windows Server 2022.\n\nWindows CE (November 2006)\n\nInitial release date: November 1, 2006\n\nA version of the Windows operating system was designed for small devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) or Handheld PCs in the Microsoft vernacular). The Windows CE graphical user interface (GUI) was very similar to Windows 95 so devices running Windows CE were meant to be familiar to Windows 95 users.\n\nWindows Home Server\n\nInitial release date: November 4, 2007\n\nAnnounced in January 2007, Windows Home Server (WHS) was a \u201cconsumer server\u201d designed to use with multiple computers connected in the home. Home Server allowed users to share files such as digital photos and media files, and also automatically backed up home networked computers. Through Windows Media Connect, Windows Home Server shared any media located on your WHS with compatible devices.\n\nWindows Mobile\n\nInitial release date: April 19, 2000\n\nThe mobile operating system for smartphones and mobile devices from Microsoft was based on the Windows CE kernel and designed to look and operate similar to desktop versions of Microsoft Windows. Windows Mobile was largely been supplanted by Windows Phone 7, although Microsoft did release, in 2011, Windows Embedded Handheld 6.5, a mobile OS compatible with Windows Mobile 6.5 that was designed for enterprise mobile and handheld computing devices.\n\nWindows Phone\n\nInitial release date: October 21, 2010\n\nWindows\u2019 mobile operating system for smartphones and mobile devices served as the successor to Microsoft\u2019s initial mobile OS platform system, Windows Mobile. Unlike Windows Mobile, Windows Phone 7 was targeted more to the consumer market than the enterprise market. \u201cWinPhone7\u201d replaced the more traditional Microsoft Windows OS look and feel with new \u201cMetro\u201d design system introduced in Windows 8.\n\nWindows Phone 7 featured a multi-tab Internet Explorer Mobile Web browser that used a rendering engine based on Internet Explorer 9. It also included Microsoft Office Mobile, a version of Microsoft Office tailored for mobile devices. Its successors included Windows Phone 8 and Windows 10 Mobile. Microsoft announced the end of life for Windows Phone on January 14, 2020.\n\nThis article was last updated February 22, 2021 by Kaiti Norton."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/development-computer-operating-systems", "page_content": "The Development of Computer Operating Systems\n\nOverview\n\nFor most people, understanding their computers extends no further than needing to know how to be able to install programs. However, there are a number of essential elements that allow a user to make use of the computer hardware. This essay will explore the history of one of these elements\u2014the operating system. An operating system is a program that serves as an interface between the user of a computer and the hardware. It sets up an environment in which a user can run programs conveniently and efficiently. Examples of operating systems include DOS, UNIX, and Windows. There are four main components of a computer system: the hardware, the operating system, programs, and users. The operating system manages the hardware and software resources of the computer to best meet the diverse and sometimes conflicting needs of programs and users.\n\nBackground\n\nThe earliest computers did not have operating systems. Programmers interacted directly with the hardware through switches, tape, or punched cards. Because the computer could operate much more quickly than the programmer could load or unload tape or cards, the computer spent a great deal of time idle. To overcome this expensive idle time, the first rudimentary operating systems (OS) were devised. They were simple programs that were always in the memory of the computer and that ordered user programs by type and then automatically ran them one right after the other. The next step came about with the introduction of disk systems. Because disks are random access devices, the information on them can be accessed in any order. Disks were used to hold user input and output until the central processing unit was ready to use it. As soon as the CPU finished one task it could jump on the disk to another job that was ready to run. Time-sharing was the next logical progression. In time-shared operating systems the CPU handles many jobs at the same time by switching in between them so quickly that it is unnoticeable. Thus, while one user is typing in a command, the CPU is executing another user's program.\n\nMULTICS and UNIX\n\nOne of the earliest formal operating systems was MULTICS, designed between 1965 and 1972 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. MULTICS was a time-shared system running continuously on a large complex mainframe computer with a vast file system of shared programs and data. In 1969 Ken Thompson (1943- ) and Dennis Ritchie of the Research Group at Bell Laboratories began to work on UNIX, an operating system for minicomputers. Ritchie had previously worked on the MULTICS project, and UNIX was strongly influenced by MULTICS. (The name UNIX is a pun on MULTICS.) For this new OS, Ritchie and Brian Kernhagan developed the systems-programming language C to replace the assembly language previously used. By 1978 UNIX had become a product sold by AT&T (the parent organization of Bell Labs.) The size, simplicity, and clean design of the UNIX system encouraged programmers at sites other than Bell Labs to experiment with UNIX development. The most influential of these was a group at the University of California at Berkeley. The advances made by this group convinced the defense department to fund further research, leading to the development of 4BSD (Berkeley Software Distributions) UNIX. 4BSD proved to be fundamental to the development of the Internet. UNIX is a simple, highly flexible system designed to let the user build a more complex system if desired. It can run on mainframes, workstations, minicomputers, supercomputers, and even personal computers. Research and development of UNIX continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, with special focus being placed on standardizing UNIX applications.\n\nApple and Microsoft\n\nWhile UNIX was spreading beyond Bell Labs, the development of the Intel 4004 microprocessor in 1971 allowed the concept of a personal computer to emerge. The Intel 4004 was an entire CPU on a single microchip. Intel and other companies continued to refine the microchip, and personal computer (PC) kits that users assembled themselves became popular among computer hobbyists. Unlike mainframe computers, personal computers were not intended to have more than one user at a time and therefore were not concerned at first with time-sharing or multitasking. Instead, as the PC market grew, emphasis was placed on convenience and ease of use for the user. In 1976 Steve Jobs (1955- ) and Steve Wozniak (1950- ) designed and built the Apple I, which consisted of little more than a circuit board. However, by 1977 they had incorporated Apple Computer and announced the Apple II, which established a benchmark for personal computers. The Apple II had a simple operating system that came on a disk and accepted basic commands from a command line. In the same year Bill Gates (1955- ) and Paul Allen (1953- ) founded Microsoft Corporation.\n\nIn 1980 a computer programmer named Tim Paterson developed an operating system called 86-DOS (Disk Operating System.) Like the Apple II and the other personal computer operating systems of the time, it was a command-line interface between the user and the PC hardware. Also in 1980 IBM decided to make a personal computer and chose Microsoft Corporation to provide the operating system for the new PC. Paterson joined Microsoft in April 1981, and by July Microsoft had bought all the rights to DOS. In August IBM sold its first PC, complete with MS-DOS 1.0. In less than a year reverse engineering had allowed competitors to produce clones of the IBM personal computer. Microsoft sold MS-DOS 1.25 to these clone makers. Throughout the 1980s MS-DOS continued to develop and advance, gaining more capabilities and meeting the needs of more powerful hardware and more advanced programs.\n\nDuring the Super Bowl in January 1984, Apple introduced America to a completely innovative computer in an Orwellian-themed advertisement. The Macintosh was the first commercially successful computer with a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI style of operating system allowed users to interact with the computer through click buttons, pull-down menus, and other image options on the screen rather than through a command line. In addition to the graphical interface, the Macintosh had more advanced hardware than IBM-style PCs. Apple continued to offer both the Apple II and the Macintosh throughout the 1980s. By the end of the decade, the Macintosh offered multifinder properties that allowed it to do more than one task at once. The Macintosh proved extremely popular, especially within educational facilities. Despite the Macintosh's popularity, Apple lost ground in the PC market throughout the 1990s until its introduction of the Powermac G3 in 1997. This was followed in 1998 by the highly successful iMac computers, aimed at a low-end market.\n\nIn order to compete with the Macintosh, Microsoft produced Windows 1.0 in 1985, which brought the GUI interface and Macintosh-style features to DOS-compatible computers. In developing Windows, Microsoft signed an agreement with Apple that Windows 1.0 would not use Macintosh technology. When future versions of Windows did utilize Macintosh ideas, Apple took Microsoft to court for copying the \"look and feel\" of the Macintosh. Microsoft argued that the agreement only applied to Windows 1.0, and the court ruled in favor of Microsoft. In the meantime, between 1985 and 1987 Microsoft and IBM collaborated on creating a new operating system. Microsoft pulled out of the collaboration and released Windows 3.0 based on technology that had been developed jointly. IBM continued working on the new operating system and released OS/2 in 1987. Although it was a technologically advanced system, it was not a great commercial success. In 1993 Microsoft produced Windows NT, an entirely new operating system written from the ground up, designed to compete with the server market that was dominated by UNIX. The GUI on this new operating system had much the same look as Windows but with different programming underneath. Meanwhile, Windows continued to develop, with the next major advance coming with the release of Windows 95 in 1995. It included a major overhaul of the GUI, some changes to the underlying DOS, and was tested by over 50,000 individuals and companies before being released.\n\nMicrosoft was quickly taking over the PC market, and some of its practices were drawing criticism. In 1997 Microsoft was ordered to make Windows 95 available without the applications software Internet Explorer. The argument was that by automatically including Internet Explorer on Windows 95, Microsoft was using its monopoly of the PC operating system market to destroy competition in other markets, such as internet software. Microsoft appealed the order. An appeal court ruled that the 1995 injunction did not apply to Windows 98, released in 1998. However, in May of that same year the U.S. Justice Department and 20 states filed an antitrust suit against Microsoft, charging it with abusing its market powers to destroy competitors. In November 1999 Judge Thomas Jackson issued his Findings of Fact, stating that Microsoft is an illegal monopoly and that it had abused its market power in anti-competitive practices.\n\nThe Emergence of Linux\n\nWhile Apple and Microsoft were battling for space in the PC market, Linus Torvalds (1970- ) at the University of Helsinki in Finland was developing a freely distributed version of UNIX for personal computers called Linux. Linux began as a hobby for Torvalds, inspired by Minix, a small UNIX system developed by Andy Tanenbaum. In October 1991 Torvalds announced the first official version of Linux, 0.02. The system was still very rudimentary, but Torvalds put it out on the Internet for UNIX programmers and wizards to aid in its development. Hackers, programmers, and users of every flavor contributed, and by 1994 it had become a viable operating system, capable of running almost all UNIX programs. By 1996 Linux was a complete UNIX clone, capable of running X-windows\u2014the UNIX version of a GUI. Because Linux was developed completely from scratch, it contains no code from AT&T or any other proprietary source. Much of the software available for Linux is from the GNU project at the Free Software Foundation in Cambridge, MA. In 1999 it was still possible to obtain Linux and a sizeable number of programs completely free of charge. Because of its flexibility, its price, and the fact that it is adaptable to most PC hardware, Linux became quite popular in the late 1990s as an Internet server. The growing interest in Linux convinced commercial software manufacturers to make their packages compatible with the Linux system. As this trend continues Linux will become even more viable and popular.\n\nImpact\n\nThe pace of change in the computer industry makes it impossible to predict future developments in operating systems. However, this article has attempted to show that the evolution of operating systems in the second half of the twentieth century depended on a number of factors, including programmer interest, market pressures, hardware advances, and government oversight. Operating systems will continue to develop to meet the growing and changing needs of users and new hardware. It can only be hoped that the competition that gave rise to the PC revolution, the innovation that brought about GUI systems, and the free exchange of ideas that gave rise to Linux will all continue into the twenty-first century.\n\nDANIEL BONGERT AND REBECCA B.

Typical resources include the central processing unit (CPU), computer memory, file storage, input/output (I/O) devices, and network connections. Management tasks include scheduling resource use to avoid conflicts and interference between programs. Unlike most programs, which complete a task and terminate, an operating system runs indefinitely and terminates only when the computer is turned off.\n\nModern multiprocessing operating systems allow many processes to be active, where each process is a \u201cthread\u201d of computation being used to execute a program. One form of multiprocessing is called time-sharing, which lets many users share computer access by rapidly switching between them. Time-sharing must guard against interference between users\u2019 programs, and most systems use virtual memory, in which the memory, or \u201caddress space,\u201d used by a program may reside in secondary memory (such as on a magnetic hard disk drive) when not in immediate use, to be swapped back to occupy the faster main computer memory on demand. This virtual memory both increases the address space available to a program and helps to prevent programs from interfering with each other, but it requires careful control by the operating system and a set of allocation tables to keep track of memory use. Perhaps the most delicate and critical task for a modern operating system is allocation of the CPU; each process is allowed to use the CPU for a limited time, which may be a fraction of a second, and then must give up control and become suspended until its next turn. Switching between processes must itself use the CPU while protecting all data of the processes.\n\nBritannica Quiz Computers and Technology Quiz\n\nThe first digital computers had no operating systems. They ran one program at a time, which had command of all system resources, and a human operator would provide any special resources needed. The first operating systems were developed in the mid-1950s. These were small \u201csupervisor programs\u201d that provided basic I/O operations (such as controlling punch card readers and printers) and kept accounts of CPU usage for billing. Supervisor programs also provided multiprogramming capabilities to enable several programs to run at once. This was particularly important so that these early multimillion-dollar machines would not be idle during slow I/O operations.\n\nComputers acquired more powerful operating systems in the 1960s with the emergence of time-sharing, which required a system to manage multiple users sharing CPU time and terminals. Two early time-sharing systems were CTSS (Compatible Time Sharing System), developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Dartmouth College Basic System, developed at Dartmouth College. Other multiprogrammed systems included Atlas, at the University of Manchester, England, and IBM\u2019s OS/360, probably the most complex software package of the 1960s. After 1972 the Multics system for General Electric Co.\u2019s GE 645 computer (and later for Honeywell Inc.\u2019s computers) became the most sophisticated system, with most of the multiprogramming and time-sharing capabilities that later became standard.\n\nThe minicomputers of the 1970s had limited memory and required smaller operating systems. The most important operating system of that period was UNIX, developed by AT&T for large minicomputers as a simpler alternative to Multics. It became widely used in the 1980s, in part because it was free to universities and in part because it was designed with a set of tools that were powerful in the hands of skilled programmers. More recently, Linux, an open-source version of UNIX developed in part by a group led by Finnish computer science student Linus Torvalds and in part by a group led by American computer programmer Richard Stallman, has become popular on personal computers as well as on larger computers.\n\nIn addition to such general-purpose systems, special-purpose operating systems run on small computers that control assembly lines, aircraft, and even home appliances. They are real-time systems, designed to provide rapid response to sensors and to use their inputs to control machinery. Operating systems have also been developed for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Apple Inc.\u2019s iOS, which runs on iPhones and iPads, and Google Inc.\u2019s Android are two prominent mobile operating systems.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Some of these are simple user commands like \u201cdir\u201d\u2014show the files on a disk\u2014while others are low-level \u201csystem calls\u201d that a graphics program might use to display an image. In either case the operating system provides appropriate access to its objects, the tables of disk locations in one case and the routines to transfer data to the screen in the other. Some of its routines, those that manage the CPU and memory, are generally accessible only to other portions of the operating system.\n\nContemporary operating systems for personal computers commonly provide a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI may be an intrinsic part of the system, as in the older versions of Apple\u2019s Mac OS and Microsoft Corporation\u2019s Windows OS; in others it is a set of programs that depend on an underlying system, as in the X Window system for UNIX and Apple\u2019s Mac OS X.\n\nOperating systems also provide network services and file-sharing capabilities\u2014even the ability to share resources between systems of different types, such as Windows and UNIX. Such sharing has become feasible through the introduction of network protocols (communication rules) such as the Internet\u2019s TCP/IP."}, {"url": "https://studycorgi.com/evolution-of-microsoft-windows-operating-system/", "page_content": "Overview\n\nThe journey for Windows began on November 10, 1983, with the release of Microsoft windows Beta 1.0, which was followed by Windows 2.0 and then Windows 3.0 in May 1990. The first version Windows 1.0 was an extension of MS-DOS which used the \u201cC prompt.\u201d To communicate with the system, a command had to be entered using the keyboard. Windows 1.0 which was a GUI offered an easier and user-friendly method. The user could now use a mouse to interact with the system and also use features like the calendar, calculator, and Microsoft word pad etcetera. The version that followed improved upon the speed, the memory and gave users more control. However, the key feature was the development of Dynamic Data Exchange. Windows 3.0 released in 1990 further improved on the speed and performance by taking advantage of the Intel 386 processers. The key improvements in this version were marked by the improvements in the 16-bit color and programs that allowed more control like Print Manager.\n\nThe above versions allowed Windows programmers to overcome 2 problems. A GUI Interface was available that simplified computer usage greatly and allowed a user to multitask. However, they still faced a few challenges. These challenges were in the minds of the programmers as they worked on the next version, Windows NT which was released in July 1993. This software was designed to allow full exploitation of the microprocessors while retaining the simple, object-oriented user interface the previous versions had. Another key focus was on providing simple and transparent access to network services. Windows 3.1 had been released in 1992 and included minor improvements to Windows 3.0. Thus, in July 2003, Windows NT 3.1 was introduced. NT stood for New Technology and it offered the combination of the convenience of the previous Graphical User Interface along with the additional benefit of an extensible 32-bit operating system. Windows NT was capable of running Windows 3.1 programs. It included peer-to-peer networking, supported full multitasking, a full security system, and did not require DOS. This was the first to be developed with the client/server business application in mind and was available in two versions.\n\nThe next version that Microsoft worked on was called Chicago. However, Chicago itself was never released but in August 1995, it was released under the name of Windows 95. The key feature was that it integrated a 32-bit TCP /IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.) It also allowed advanced multimedia options, easier installing procedures, and dial-up networks. Perhaps the most prominent aspect of Windows 95 was its Plug and Play.\n\nThis version was then followed by Windows NT WorkStation, having programs designed to improve and facilitate the use of computers in business processes. This 1996 release was then followed by Windows 1998, which was an upgrade from Windows 95. This time the focus was on introducing more features and creating a system that was faster and offered more to the user. Windows 98 allowed the use of a Universal Serial Bus (USB) and DVD format to allow easier transfer of data. Its second edition, Windows 98 SE was introduced the next year with slight improvements. The giant leap that Windows took at this stage was of providing users with networking and internet options.\n\nThe next version came in the year 2000 and was known as Windows 2000. It was available in six editions. Different versions and was based on the previous NT technology. In September of the same year, Windows Millennium Edition or Windows ME was released. This was again like Windows 95 targeted more towards the costumers and offered advanced multimedia features by introducing Windows Movie Maker, a program that assists users in the editing of movie clips, and Windows Media Player which offered additional options than its predecessor.\n\nIn 2001, Microsoft changed the way it had been launching its different versions. Windows 3X, 95, 98, and I which were largely focused on home usage and entertainment had been derived from Windows 1.0 and Windows 3.0. As for Windows NT Workstation and Windows 2000 Professional, which were more focused on the corporate needs of clients, that is for business purposes, were derived from Windows NT. Thus, Window XP was a resultant of the two and included several editions including the two most popular: Windows XP Home edition for the consumers and Windows XP Professional for the businesses and power users. It also included Windows XP Tablet for Tablet PCs released in 2002. Unlike the early period when the aim was to provide users with fast computing machines that were easy to understand and interact with, the attention was directed towards providing something for everyone. From the basic needs of a business professional to the programs catering to the entertainment needs of consumers, while still meeting the basic goal of providing an easy, user-friendly, and fast system that allowed multitasking. The focus has also been on allowing the consumer to personalize by giving him/her more options and choices. For example, Windows Media Player lets the user rename, organize, create music playlists as well as change view options like \u2018View Album Cover.\u2019 Similarly, users are provided with additional options to choose, organize, and data according to their needs/desires.\n\nWindows Vista was released in the year 2006 and was available in several editions depending on the customer\u2019s needs or requirements. This was later improved upon and changes made in security and released in 2008. Vista is the latest version currently being used and offers advanced entertainment options like recording live TV on your PC, incredible processor speeds, as well as enhanced security options including those for Internet Explorer.\n\nMicrosoft will be launching its latest version of Windows, Windows 7 on the 22nd of September. Microsoft has improved upon the previous one by asking their users what improvements they want and then making changes accordingly. A sidebar has been introduced changing the visual of the main windows screen. Entertainment experience has been upgraded through Windows Media Center and Windows Taskbar and Jump List, it is claimed will make working on PCs easier, faster, and more reliable. (Microsoft, 2008)\n\nConclusion\n\nWindows has traveled a long way in a short period, taking long heaps and improving upon its predecessors to provide its customers with better services. One of the main reasons why it evolved so is was the constant competition between its major rival Apple who introduced their operating system Mac OS X. Also improvements in speed to facilitate faster processing and more options to businesses and consumers, which included enhanced security measures, technological advancements, Windows had to evolve to maintain and enlarge its position in the market.\n\nReferences\n\nMicrosoft.

This OS was developed by \u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u201d in 1985 and they take more than 90% of the market share from the global market in the IT sector (Computer Operating System). The reason behind the popularity of this OS is that it comes up with a graphical user interface and with preloaded applications which makes the user easy to use and make their experience good. They can easily use any third-party application in this OS without writing any codes and do many types of things which we\u2019ll discuss in later. Now, let\u2019s see what is Windows Operating system?\n\nWindows Operating system\n\nIt is a GUI-based operating system that is developed and marketed by Microsoft Corporation. The main objective of Microsoft company regarding this operating system is to make it an all-rounder and easy-to-use OS that has everything So that any normal user who doesn\u2019t have knowledge about coding can easily use this operating without any issue.\n\nIt comes up with a clean desktop environment that looks minimal and easy to use. It also comes up with a pre-loaded application like Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, Microsoft Edge browser, Microsoft store, some basic games, and many other applications come. It allows the user to do multitask, play games, watch videos, browse the internet, chats with friends/family, and even you can install any software without any issue.\n\nNow, let see what are the features in the window OS\n\nFeatures in Windows Operating System\n\nAs such there are many features in the windows are :\n\nDesktop\n\nTaskbar\n\nTask Manager\n\nControl Panel\n\nCommand Prompt\n\nRecycle Bin\n\nSetting\n\nRegistry Editor\n\nCortana\n\nSystem Information\n\nStart Menu\n\n1. Desktop\n\nDesktop is a by-default GUI-based Screen provided by the Microsoft in windows OS. It is a place where all the software applications icons are available on a screen, so the users can do their work by clicking on these applications. You can also customize it according to your preferences like you can change the background, you can delete your application\u2019s icons, you can create a folder, and also you can customize your taskbar.\n\nDesktop\n\n2. Taskbar\n\nTasker is an area where you can check which application in your PC/laptop is currently open or which is not. Like in the given image, you can see that the only chrome application is currently open.\n\nTasker\n\n3. Task Manager\n\nTask manager is a \u201csystem monitoring program\u2019 where you can monitor your system what\u2019s currently running on your computer. It shows your system resource information, what amount of resources can be used by each application.\n\nTask Manager\n\n4. Control Panel\n\nIt is a management tool where you can manage all the resources on your system like you can make some changes on Hardware resources(Printer, Mouse, keyboard, etc), networks, programs, personalization, etc.\n\nControl Panel\n\n5. Command Prompt\n\nCommand Prompt is a terminal where you can operate your computer by writing Some commands like cd, cls, dir, exit, find, hostname, shutdown, etc, and many others. It is mostly known for \u201ccmd\u201d.\n\nCommand Prompt\n\n6) Recycle Bin\n\nIt is a place where all the deleted files and applications are stored. It provides a facility of restore point where we can restore any deleted files or applications of our system. If you delete any files or applications from the recycle bin then you will no longer restore them, they will be permanently deleted. In a given image you can see that my Linux command PDF file has been deleted and is now showing in the recycle bin folder.\n\nRecycle Bin\n\n7) Setting\n\nThe word \u201csetting\u201d you better know, this is available in all the devices smartphones, tablets, PC, etc. setting allows us to make some changes like we can customize our window desktop by adding different types of wallpapers, pictures to the background, we can adjust the icon size and also we can change the time and date of your system.\n\nIf we talked about an important thing then we can check the windows updates, update drivers, secure system, etc.\n\nSetting\n\n8) Registry Editor\n\nIt is the place where we can fix any error which will be happening in windows OS and for any applications.\n\nRegistry Editor\n\n9) Cortana\n\nCortana is an assistant which helps us to execute our program by hearing our voice, it saves our time and focuses attention on what matters most.\n\nCortana\n\n10) System Information\n\nSystem information shows our PC information of hardware resources, components, and of the software environment.\n\nSystem Information\n\n11) Start Menu\n\nStart Menu shows all the applications and programs of our system. It also shows the history of what application was currently open.\n\nStart Menu\n\nHistory of Windows Operating System\n\n1983 was the year where the first window operating system was developed which is done by the multi-technology software company \u201cMicrosoft\u201d and it was founded by the two popular electronics magazines friends \u201cBill Gates\u201d and \u201cPaul Allen\u201d in 1975. After some years Paul Allen left the Microsoft company (In 1983) and right now the Bill Gates was the only person who owns Microsoft and there are many shareholders who invest in Microsoft.\n\nVersions of Windows Operating System\n\nThere are too many versions were released by Microsoft are:\n\na) Windows 1\n\nIt is was the first Windows from Microsoft which is released on 20 November 1985. This was the first step from the Microsoft to produce a GUI-based operating system. After that, they sold it in the market at $100.\n\nb) Window 2\n\nAfter two years, Microsoft released the second version of the window which is released on 9 December 1987. It was sold for $100.\n\nc) Window 386\n\nThe release date of window 2, \u201cWindow 386\u201d was released on the same day (on 9 Dec 1987). And, it was also sold at $100.\n\nd) Window 286\n\nIn June 1988 the window 286 were released and also sold for $100.\n\ne) Window 3\n\nIt was released on 22 May 1990 and this was the first version of windows that required an HDD (Hard Drive Disk). It was initially sold at a price of $149.95 and the upgraded version was sold for $79.95.\n\ne) Window 3.1\n\nIt was released on 6 April 1992. It was the most loved version in the market, Within 2 months the millions of copies of this version were sold in the market.\n\nf) Windows 95\n\nWindows 95 was released on 24 August 1995. This was the time where the windows craze started, within a few days the millions of copies were sold.\n\ng) Windows 98\n\nWindows 98 was released in 1998. This was the updated version of windows 95 where the Microsoft added some new feature which was not available in windows 95\n\nh) Windows 2000\n\nWindows 2000 was launched on 17 Feb 2000. This version was based on a business-oriented system.\n\ni) Windows XP\n\nWindows XP was released on 25 October 2001 and this was the best version of Windows OS because it is a stable OS which is built on a Windows 2000 kernel.\n\nj) Windows Vista\n\nIn January 2006 this version was released and it is the updated version of Windows XP where the vista added some additional features with its looks and feel.\n\nk) Window 7\n\nWindow 7 is a successor to window vista which was released on 22 July 2009. This version of windows aims to fix all those bugs which was faced in windows vista and make it user-friendly OS.\n\nl) Window 8\n\nWindow 8 was released on 26 October 2012 and this version of windows comes with some news features like faster booting speed, web store, improved search function, USB 3.0 supported device, etc., and many others.\n\nm) Window 8.1\n\nWindow 8.1 was released on 23 august 2013 and it is the little upgrade of window 8.\n\nn) Window 10\n\nWindow 10 was released on 29 July 2015. This version comes up with some improvements and with news features.\n\no) Window 11\n\nWell, we all know window 11 is recently released by microsoft. It is released on 5 Oct 2021. It is also comes up with some improvements and with some features like Apple mac-like interface, Integrated android apps, splitting the screen, Better virtual desktop support, etc. and many other things."}, {"url": "https://www.tomshardware.com/picturestory/739-history-of-microsoft-windows.html", "page_content": "Microsoft Origins\n\nMicrosoft is well known today for its Windows operating system, which is used on computers around the world. It's hard to think of a time when Microsoft didn't produce Windows. In the beginning, however, Microsoft developed other operating systems such as Altair BASIC. Over the years, Microsoft developed other OSes outside of the Windows product line, which contributed to the development of Windows.\n\nIn this article, we will look at the major desktop-oriented operating systems developed by Microsoft. This means we will not look closely at server operating systems or versions of Windows designed for mobile phones, cars, or other devices.\n\n\n\nMORE: 23 Years of Supercomputer Evolution\n\n\n\nMORE: History Of Mechanical Keyboards\n\nMS-DOS (1981)\n\nAlthough Microsoft got its start with Altair BASIC, it didn't become the OS powerhouse that it is until the introduction of MS-DOS. The initial release of MS-DOS (known as 86-DOS at this time) was actually developed by Tim Paterson, who worked for Seattle Computer Products at the time. In many ways, it was a clone of the CP/M OS developed by Digital Research, but Paterson made it compatible with x86 processors and introduced the FAT12 file system as the primary disk format.\n\nMicrosoft later acquired 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products and hired Paterson to continue development on the OS. After rebranding the OS as MS-DOS, it was licensed to IBM, which rebranded it again as PC-DOS.\n\nMS-DOS was not particularly unique in terms of its functionality or user interface, but it had two key advantages over all other contemporary DOS-like OSes. First, it supported x86 processors, which would ultimately become the most heavily used type of computer processor. Second, Microsoft's contract with IBM lead to an enormous amount of software being developed for MS-DOS/PC-DOS. These advantages allowed Microsoft's MS-DOS to dominate the PC market for the next decade.\n\n\n\nMORE: The History of Intel CPUs\n\n\n\nMORE: The History of AMD CPUs\n\nWindows 1.0 (1985)\n\nImmediately after Microsoft launched MS-DOS, it started working on the first version of Windows. This early version of Windows 1.0 is best viewed as a graphical user interface (GUI) for MS-DOS; the OS itself is incapable of operating without DOS. Microsoft introduced new APIs with Windows 1.0 that allowed programs to run natively on the Windows OS itself, but the number of programs that used these APIs was dwarfed by the ever growing library of MS-DOS applications. Windows 1.0 also introduced virtual memory, which allowed the OS to use a limited amount of space on the hard drive as RAM. Virtual memory is significantly slower than actual RAM, but larger applications that require more than the available amount of RAM to run can take advantage of the capacity.\n\n\n\nMORE: The History of Nvidia GPUs\n\n\n\nMORE: 30 Year History of AMD Graphics\n\nWindows 2.0 (1987)\n\nWindows 2.0 was an overhaul of the original Windows 1.0 operating system and had a richer feature set. A key improvement found in Windows 2.0 was the ability to have Windows overlap each other. This made multitasking easier, because users could better utilize the available desktop real estate.\n\n\n\nMORE: 23 Years of Supercomputer Evolution\n\n\n\nMORE: History Of Mechanical Keyboards\n\nOS/2 (1987)\n\nAlthough IBM's OS/2 was technically a competitor to Microsoft's Windows, it is worth noting that it was co-developed by Microsoft. Early versions of OS/2 looked similar to Windows 2.0 and Windows 3.0, but they were functionally quite different. Both OS/2 and Windows (all versions) were capable of executing DOS software, and they both aimed to extend the functionality of the PC by allowing you to multitask between DOS and native software.\n\nEventually IBM and Microsoft would clash as Windows and OS/2 competed against each other in the market. Microsoft ultimately ended its involvement with OS/2; at the time, it was developing OS/2 3.0. Instead of putting the project on hold, Microsoft used its work on OS/2 3.0 to jump start its development of a new OS that would later be known as Windows NT.\n\nAs for OS/2, it was actively developed by IBM into the late 1990s, and the company continued to provide support until December 31, 2006. OS/2 ultimately failed to be profitable to maintain, however, as it was developed specifically for IBM's hardware and was more expensive than Windows. It was later sold to another company and is still developed under the name \"eComStation.\"\n\n\n\nMORE: The History of Intel CPUs\n\n\n\nMORE: The History of AMD CPUs\n\nWindows 2.1 (1988)\n\nWindows 2.1 was an incremental update to the Windows 2.0 operating system. It was optimized to take advantage of new features present in Intel 80286 and 80386 processors. This lead to the operating system sometimes being referred to as Windows/286 and Windows/386. One of the key improvements was the inclusion of HIMEM.sys, which allowed Windows 2.1 to access larger amounts of memory than Windows 2.0. Microsoft also added support for protected mode on Intel 80386 processors, which allowed the processor to run multiple programs in parallel. Before the introduction of protected mode, you could work on only a single application at a time; all other applications were suspended in the background.\n\nWindows 2.1 was subsequently replaced by Windows 2.11 in 1989, but the two OSes are essentially identical. The key improvements in 2.11 included improved drivers and support for AppleTalk.\n\nDue to the enhancements in Windows 2.1, it was the first Windows operating system to require a hard disk drive.\n\n\n\nMORE: The History of Nvidia GPUs\n\n\n\nMORE: 30 Year History of AMD Graphics\n\nWindows 3.0 (1990)\n\nWindows 3.0 featured numerous improvements over Windows 2.11, but it is closely related to its predecessor. The user interface was polished, and support was added for 16-color images. In VGA mode, the OS was capable of rendering 256 colors on screen at the same time. The OS also supported an enhanced protected mode that allowed programs to easily access larger amounts of system memory. \"Larger,\" though, is relative, as Windows 3.0 could support a maximum of 16MB of RAM. Fully installed, the OS consumed roughly 5MB of space.\n\nWindows 3.0 quickly outshined its predecessors due to its numerous enhancements. By working with OEMs to ship systems with Windows pre-installed and by pricing the OS competitively against OS/2 and Apple's Mac OS, Microsoft was able to sell millions of copies of Windows 3.0 in its first year.\n\nAs an interesting side note, this was also the first version of Windows to ship with Solitaire.\n\n\n\nMORE: 23 Years of Supercomputer Evolution\n\n\n\nMORE: History Of Mechanical Keyboards\n\nWindows 3.1 (1992)\n\nMicrosoft continued to improve Windows 3.0, which lead to the release of Windows 3.1.\n\nThere are three key improvements inherent in Windows 3.1. First, it removes support for real mode. This limited the OS to running on 80286 or newer hardware, but it significantly improved system stability. Second, it added Truetype font support, which made Windows more useful for office and document publishing work. Third, it raised the maximum memory support to 4GB, with individual programs able to access up to 16MB each. The OS required a minimum of 1MB of RAM and at least 15MB of hard drive space to be fully installed.\n\nMicrosoft also produced a few alternative versions of Windows 3.1, such as Windows for Workgroups 3.1 and Windows 3.1 Multimedia PC. These versions of Windows 3.1 contained enhancements that were important to specific clients, but not particularly useful to everyone.\n\n\n\nMORE: The History of Intel CPUs\n\n\n\nMORE: The History of AMD CPUs\n\nWindows NT 3.1 (1993)\n\nIn 1993, Microsoft released its first version of Windows NT. The OS was called Windows NT 3.1 to mimic Windows 3.1, which had been released the previous year.\n\nAlthough Windows NT and Windows 3.1 look similar, they are actually quite different. Unlike Windows 3.1, Windows NT 3.1 was built from scratch as a fully 32-bit OS. It was started as a redesign of IBM's OS/2, but the design was forked and heavily modified. This gave Windows NT 3.1 the ability to run applications created for Windows, MS-DOS, and OS/2. Microsoft also created the OS to support multiple processing architectures. Upon its release, it was able to run on x86 and MIPS CPUs, and it later gained support for DEC's Alpha processors. Windows NT 3.1 was also more stable than Windows 3.1.\n\nAlthough Windows NT 3.1 was more advanced and feature rich than Windows 3.1, it had limited sales and was less successful than its counterpart. The operating system had relatively high system requirements for its time, which prevented most people from using it. The minimum requirements for the OS were a 32-bit 25MHz 80386 processor, 12MB of RAM, and a 75MB HDD. As a result, Windows NT 3.1 was mostly reserved for use on servers and high-end business systems.\n\n\n\nMORE: The History of Nvidia GPUs\n\n\n\nMORE: 30 Year History of AMD Graphics\n\nWindows 95 Part 1 (1995)\n\nAfter the release of Windows 3.1, Microsoft planned to cease development of future DOS-based OSes. Windows 3.1 would be maintained as a consumer-oriented product for a number of years, while Microsoft worked on future versions of Windows NT. Eventually, a more user-friendly OS known as \"Cairo\" was to be released as a solution for both consumers and businesses. Fierce competition from other operating systems such as Mac OS and OS/2, however, cut into Microsoft's market share and showed the company that it needed to quickly develop a new operating system to battle Apple and IBM. As Cairo was still years away from being finished at that time, Microsoft turned its attention to creating a new OS that would become Windows 95.\n\n\n\nMORE: 23 Years of Supercomputer Evolution\n\n\n\nMORE: History Of Mechanical Keyboards\n\nWindows 95 Part 2 (1995)\n\nThe initial design goals for Windows 95 were to create a more user-friendly OS that supported 32-bit software, was easier to install, and was more stable. Originally, Microsoft planned to make the OS easier to use by simplifying the way software and networks were configured by end users.\n\nThe user interface was supposed to remain unchanged from Windows 3.1, as Microsoft was already developing a new UI for Cairo. Ultimately, though, Microsoft ported the new UI to the Windows 95 project. As a result, Windows 95 became the first version of Windows to feature the Start bar, and it also was the first to use Windows Explorer.\n\nWindows 95 was technically still DOS-based like Windows 3.1, but it also had an unprecedented degree of independence from DOS in terms of its architecture and internal operation. System stability was significantly increased by running multiple virtual machines under the OS. This reduced the impact of a single piece of software crashing. It also placed a layer of software between programs and the hardware, which made it less likely a software crash would cause the entire OS to fail.\n\nPerformance was drastically improved in Windows 95, because the OS supported execution of preemptively multitasked 32-bit applications in protected mode. The OS was also able to use faster processors, and it had practical memory support for up to 512MB of RAM. The minimum requirements called for just a 32-bit processor, 4MB of RAM, and 50MB of hard drive space. This meant the OS could be run on a wide number of computers that didn't meet the requirements of Windows NT.\n\nAs For Cairo, it was ultimately scrapped, but parts of its code were re-used in future OSes.\n\n\n\nMORE: The History of Intel CPUs\n\n\n\nMORE: The History of AMD CPUs"}]}
