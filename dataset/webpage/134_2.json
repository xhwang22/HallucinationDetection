In 1981 he was assigned to the National Security Council, where his work focused on Central America. Embracing the cause of the Nicaraguan contras, he raised private donations for them. In 1986, after Congressional investigation of the Iran-Contra Affair, he was reluctantly dismissed by then president Ronald Reagan. In 1988 North was indicted for conspiracy to defraud the government and resigned from the Marine Corps. At his 1989 trial, he was found guilty of obstructing the U.S. Congress, destroying documents, and accepting an illegal gratuity and was sentenced to two years\u2019 probation. In 1991, after a prosecution witness claimed that his testimony had been tainted, all charges against North were dropped.\n\nNorth ran unsuccessfully for a U.S. Senate seat in Virginia in 1994. In the mid-1990s he began hosting a conservative radio talk show. He also cowrote a number of books, including a thriller series. The memoir Under Fire: An American Story (cowritten with William Novak) was published in 1991. North was named president of the National Rifle Association (NRA) in 2018. He later became involved in a power struggle with NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre as regulators investigated the organization\u2019s tax-exempt status amid allegations of financial improprieties.

What was it like to be a part of a war [Operation Iraqi Freedom (search)]as a member of the media?\n\nLT COL. OLIVER NORTH, WAR STORIES HOST: There are some things that never change. The dust, the long sleepless days and nights, the stark reality of war's horror. As a Marine officer in combat, I was responsible for the lives and safety of all the Marines who served with me. This time I was responsible only for myself and my very brave field producer Griff Jenkins.\n\nIn uniform I had to make judgments about the best course of action in combat when the only choices were \"bad\" or \"worse.\" As a member of the media I only had to decide how to get the best \"shot\" -- preferably without getting shot.\n\nIn the end, my prior military experience was a considerable advantage. I knew the \"lingo,\" could \"speak their language,\" and the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines we covered all knew me -- and knew without question that I would give them a fair shake at letting them tell their story.\n\nI don't pretend to be a trained journalist. I do write a weekly newspaper column and a book now and then. And over the past two years I've learned a good bit about television here at fox news channel -- but I didn't study journalism at [the Naval Academy in] Annapolis. So I decided right from the start to simply let these youngsters tell their own story. I made it a practice to try and put one of them on each live or taped broadcast. I went out of my way to interview and put on the air the young troopers who were doing the fighting rather than the senior officers and generals who were running the war -- and I think that made a big difference. That's they way Ernie Pyle (search) covered world war ii and I figured if it worked for him it would work for me. It did.\n\nA lot of people have said nice things about my reports during the war -- and I'm grateful. But I think the real reason it \"worked\" is because what they saw wasn't about me -- it was about the brave young Americans we have serving in harm's way.\n\nI like to tell people that I have the best job in the media. All I do is hang around with heroes. I do that every week for my \"War Stories\" documentary series -- and when FOX News wants -- I go off and cover the young Americans we send to places like Afghanistan or Iraq. Sure beats covering car chases in Los Angeles.\n\nFOXNEWS.COM: Were you embedded longer than any other FNC journalist? - it seemed like you were \u201cserving\u201d for a very long time! How did you manage the physical strain of your job?\n\nNORTH: I wasn't keeping score as to who was there the longest, but I'm pretty sure I was the oldest. And while I try to keep myself in pretty good shape, I still lost 18 lbs. When I returned, one of my daughters -- a nurse -- told me, \"if you were really in the kind of shape you said you were in dad, you wouldn't have lost so much weight.\" the fact is -- even the young guys -- average age of a Marine or soldier is 19.6 years -- will lose a good bit of weight over there.\n\nAt one point I had my camera on while I ran to cover a minor fire-fight that had broken out about 150 yards from where I had been standing. All you can hear in the microphone is a few shots being fired -- and my heavy breathing! When I caught up to the staff sergeant who was leading the attack he turned to me and said, \"Hey, Colonel, you all right?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I huffed in response, \"Why?\"\n\n\"'Cause you're sweating like a hog!\" he replied with a smile. And I was. But then again -- he was 25 and I'm pushing 60.\n\nFOXNEWS.COM: What\u2019s the most memorable moment of your tour as an embed?\n\nNORTH: The most surprising thing about this war was how fast it went. No military force in history has ever gone so far, so fast, with so few casualties. Except for one 3 day period when we were blanketed by a dust storm of biblical proportions, we moved almost non-stop, day and night, from the start of the war on 20 March all the way to the end.\n\nThere were -- because this was war -- some very memorable events: the first casualties of the war occurred just a few yards from us as a helicopter went down in a terrible fireball -- killing all aboard. There were the night attacks across the Euphrates and the Tigris; the capture of the salman pak terrorist training facility; the presidential palace in baghdad -- where the helos we were riding got shot at on every mission -- and hit more times than i care to count. I won't forget the day we got shot down in a UH11N north of Baghdad -- or the guys who rescued us.\n\nMost memorable of course are the people. The list is too long to name them, but i will never forget them. They are the smartest, fittest, best trained and best equipped young soldiers, sailors, airmen, guardsmen and marines our country has ever had. And while I don't think anyone who has ever really been to a war ever wants to go to another -- we're blessed to have young Americans who are willing to go when our country calls. And I'm blessed to be able to have gone with them.\n\nFOXNEWS.COM: What do you think the American public needs to know about war with Iraq?\n\nNORTH: That is isn't over -- and we have a long way to go. There are three distinct groups shooting at our troops in Iraq:\n\n1. The criminals Saddam released just before the war started. The only way to deal with them is to reconstitute an Iraqi police force, have Iraqi cops arrest these crooks and put 'em back in jail.\n\n2. The Baathists (search) who miss the perks of power. These thugs know Saddam isn't going to make a \"comeback\" but they think if they can drive us out, they can reclaim some of their prior status. They are now paying unemployed soldiers to shoot at our troops. An Iraqi National Guard needs to be recruited and trained to deal with this problem ASAP before it gets any worse. The unemployed soldiers who don't get recruited for the new national guard need to be put to work cleaning up the mess Saddam made of their country.\n\n3. The \"Jihaddists\" these are the radical Islamic terrorists -- most from outside of Iraq who are being fomented to blow themselves up trying to kill Americans. These are real terrorists and they can only be dealt with one way: they have to be killed before they can kill themselves killing an American. We have the kind of units that are very good at doing just that. We need better intelligence -- and it's coming. It may mean doing some very tough things in neighboring countries -- like we did in Yemen with the predator. But in the end, the best way to prevent terror attacks is to kill the terrorists. Sounds harsh. It is. But it beats being killed by a car bomb.\n\nIf we deal with [these groups] as quickly as indicated above, a functioning democracy and a healthy economy will follow quickly.\n\nFOXNEWS.COM: What do Americans need to know about the post-war era in Iraq?\n\n\n\nNORTH: See answer to #4 above.\n\nFOXNEWS.COM: Let\u2019s discuss the new season of War Stories\u2026 Is there a theme to the shows for this season?\n\nNORTH: The same as always: we let the heroes tell their own stories. That's what makes this whole series so great. We go out and find the real footage, digging through the hundreds of film reels at the National Archives and old reels from Fox Movietone News (search). We then find those who fought the battles, put them in front of a microphone and a TV camera and have them bring these events to life.\n\nEach episode of War Stories is about a particular battle, place, event or person. And everyone involved tries hard to bring out facts that may not be known all that well. Most importantly, we've been able to document these with those who were there -- and some of them -- like Joe Foss -- who appears in both the Guadalcanal episode -- and our show on Aces -- blessed us with their last recorded interviews before they died.\n\nWe don't just document history -- we let those who made history document it for us.\n\nFOXNEWS.COM: What have you learned, in an historical sense, from the subjects you\u2019ve profiled this season?\n\nNORTH: There is no lack of heroism for those who fight. And while I am absolutely in awe of what our soldiers, sailors, airmen, guardsmen and Marines do in combat -- Americans don't have a monopoly on courage. This season we'll bring our viewers Allies who fought bravely in every theater. We've got the heroes of the U.S. Merchant Marine -- who suffered greater losses in World War II than any of the armed forces. We have an exclusive interview with the last German spy sent to America in a U-boat during World War II. We have the FBI agents and O.S.S. officers who fought the war in the shadows -- often with no recognition whatsoever. We have a profile on Douglas MacArthur that will surprise a lot of people who think they know all about him.\n\nBecause we're losing so many of those who fought in World War II, we wanted to document as much of that war as possible before we lose our eyewitnesses. And even though I grew up in the home of a WW II vet, and have studied the war in detail -- I learn something new in the interviews I conduct for every episode.\n\nFOXNEWS.COM: How long does it take to put together a new season of war stories?\n\nNORTH: We started working on this season's 10 new episodes last November. We'll finish up in September. Of course we got a little behind in our work while I was off running around Iraq -- and then putting together our \"Operation Iraqi Freedom\" special. But generally speaking it takes about two months per episode and we edit on two at a time.\n\nFOXNEWS.COM: What kind of a team do you work with?\n\nNORTH: They are all professionals -- who know how to take countless hours of film, videotape and live subjects and make great TV. Pam Browne, our Senior Producer has had a long career in television news and she supervises all of our episode producers and production assistants. They all do volumes of research on each event that we cover -- and it shows in the final product.\n\nWe're our own greatest critics -- but the compliments we receive from veterans, their families and from the military services themselves that \"you got it right,\" is our greatest assurance that we've captured the events correctly.\n\nFOXNEWS.COM: Do you have a favorite program this season?\n\nNORTH: This is our third season coming up and that's really a tough call. The fighter aces show we're leading with has some heart-stopping stuff in it -- and guys who really do have \"the right stuff.\"\n\nOur episode on how the merchant marine ran the gauntlet of German U-boats, raiders and Japanese attacks will make some people wonder how we managed to win WW II.\n\nThe MacArthur biography -- thanks to the folks at West Point (search) and the MacArthur Memorial Library & Archives -- and those who served with him is a real eye opener.\n\nAnd anyone who watches our untold story of the Eastern Front will give everyone a whole new perspective on how tough things can get in combat.\n\nThanks to some great research, production and eyewitness accounts, the harrowing battles for Guam (search), Saipan (search) and Tinian (search) in the Mariana Islands (search) will seem like yesterday.\n\nAnd when you see \"Agent 146 -- Spying for the Third Reich\" you will understand why even the prosecutors who tried Erich Gimpel (search) -- a German spy -- wanted to spare his life. He was sentenced to death. We found him alive.\n\nLots of people saw the \"Black Sheep Squadron\" television show years ago. But almost nobody knows the true story of this legendary Marine fighting squadron. We've got it.\n\nThe U.S. Army's \"Big Red One\" has a lineage that spans America's history -- and the way our War Stories team put this episode together will make everyone who knows a soldier proud.\n\nBecause this is the 50th anniversary of the end of The Korean War (search) -- we wanted to get the heroic stand at the Pusan Perimeter (search) right. And we did.\n\nIf World War II had a \"forgotten battle\" it was in the Pacific at Peleliu (search). Yet, after you see the way we covered the bloody battle for this 8 square mile piece of coral jutting out of the South Pacific -- you'll always remember.\n\nThat's quite a season -- I can't pick a favorite. And I\u2019m pretty sure that after our fans see these episodes -- they'll agree -- these are all \"war stories\" that deserve to be told.\n\nBe sure to watch the new season of War Stories on Sunday evenings at 8 p.m. ET only on the FOX News Channel!\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/story/war-stories-from-iraq-with-oliver-north", "page_content": "Sunday, November 9 at 8 p.m. ET!\n\nHosted by Lt. Col. Oliver North\n\nHere's just some of what you'll experience in this special edition of War Stories with Oliver North...\n\nIt was the second time we faced a familiar enemy...\n\nOn the morning of March 20, 2003, American and British coalition forces stormed into the Al Faw peninsula from Kuwait.\n\nFrom sea, they launched Tomahawk cruise missiles and air strikes targeting key government buildings in the capital city of Baghdad. Operation Iraqi Freedom (search) had begun. The mission was to topple the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and his bloody regime that had terrorized the Iraqi people for more than 25 years. The mission was accomplished in three weeks. No military force has ever gone so far so fast and with so few casualties.\n\nEmbedded first with the 1st Marine Expeditionary For (search)ce and later with the Army's 4th Infantry Division (search), combat veteran Oliver North brought a unique perspective to the battlefield. Over 44 days, using hand-held small cameras, North and his field producer Griff Jenkins, were able to capture exclusive, dramatic behind-the-scenes footage from battle and casualty evacuation operations in Iraq.\n\nIn this special episode, you'll meet some of the soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who battled their way through this ancient land. Some paid for the liberation of others with their lives. You\u2019ll experience the danger our troops faced each day from Saddam\u2019s army and the threat of chemical weapons. You\u2019ll see the abandoned, opulent palaces that the dictator built and the slums his countrymen called home.\n\nIn this special edition of War Stories From Iraq with Oliver North, you will go inside rescue operations during a blinding sandstorm. And, you'll witness the heroism of a Marine captain who coordinated the rescue of 73 Marines in the fight for Saddam's palace.\n\nThese are stirring stories from the frontlines of \"Operation Iraqi Freedom.\"\n\nDon't miss this week's episode of War Stories From Iraq on Sunday, November 9 at 8 p.m. ET!\n\nStaff for this special episode:\n\nSenior Producer: Pamela K. Browne\n\nField Producer : Griff Jenkins\n\nProduced and Written by: Pamela K. Browne, Cyd Upson, Martin Hinton and Gregory Johnson\n\nEditor: Josh Parker and Eddie Montague\n\nDesigner : Greg Van Why"}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/story/an-exclusive-interview-with-oliver-north", "page_content": "Our new series of War Stories episodes is underway!\n\nRecently, we asked the host of War Stories, retired Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North to talk with us about the series and what Americans can learn from the heroism displayed every Sunday night at 8 p.m and 1 a.m. ET.\n\nFoxnews.com: As we inch closer to a possible war with Iraq, what can Americans learn from the men and women profiled in the War Stories episodes?\n\n\n\nCol. North: War Stories takes me all over the world to interview those who have fought in past conflicts and those who serve today. There are remarkable parallels: Now as then they are citizen soldiers. They are bright, remarkably well trained, dedicated to one another, committed to the cause of freedom and willing to go into harm's way if that's what our country requires. And now -- as then -- they are the best in the world.\n\n\n\nUnlike our adversaries in the past or today, our military is comprised of young people who grew up in freedom. None of them that I have met, then or now, glorify war -- but they do want to have their sacrifices recognized.\n\n\n\nAnd having served for 22 years myself, there is one similarity that's driven home to me every time I review the footage from some battle in the past -- and every time I talk to one of those serving today: Those who fight our nation's battles are young. In peacetime we would call them boys and girls. In times of war we call them soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines.\n\n\n\nFoxnews.com: Just recently we aired The Battle of Britain. What's special about that new show?\n\n\n\nNorth: The Battle of Britain is about the remarkable people of the British Isles -- fighting alone against Hitler before the U.S. entered the war.\n\n\n\nYoung people today -- looking at the U.S. And Britain standing up to Saddam Hussein -- wonder about the \"special relationship\" that we have with the U.K. There is more to it than just a common language -- and it's evident in this episode of War Stories. Winston Churchill said of the Royal Air Force heroes we have on this show: \"never was so much owed by so many to so few.\" He was right.\n\nFoxnews.com: What's your favorite show in the news series? Why?\n\nNorth: I can't pick a favorite. Whether I'm with those who fought in the skies over Europe, at Pearl Harbor, in the jungles of Burma, the mountains of Europe, on Guadalcanal or the desert in North Africa, the freezing cold of \"The Bulge\" or the troops in and on the way to Afghanistan or Iraq, it's clear to me that I've got the best job in television. All I do is hang around with heroes. Some of \u2018em are older than I am. Some are younger -- but they are all people who have dared to do difficult and dangerous things when their country called. They all put themselves at risk, were separated for months or years from family and loved ones and are a great inspiration to me \u2013 and, I think, to our audience. At the end of one of these episodes of War Stories you can't help but feel better about who we are as a people.\n\nFoxnews.com: What have you learned from doing this series?\n\nNorth: We're told by the media critics that the American audience likes \"reality TV.\u201d Well this is \"reality television\" -- with live ordnance! And the people we interview are real \"survivors.\"\n\nBut aside from the excitement that is inherent in any depiction of combat and courage, there is an incredible thirst for these stories in the American public. The response we have received to these documentaries has been overwhelming. As a person who spent more than two decades in uniform, it has been especially gratifying.\n\nFoxnews.com: None of the producers for War Stories has a military background... is that a good thing or a bad thing?\n\nNorth: I think it helps. First, they are professional journalists and broadcasters. They all are very careful in their research and have a good \"eye\" for how something will look on the show. Second, at almost as important: I'm a military man. I tend to think, write and speak in military jargon -- a \"language\" that most people don't really understand. Our War Stories team will catch something I, or one of those we're interviewing, have said that might not be comprehended by our civilian audience and ensure that we put it in terms that everyone understands.\n\n\n\nFoxnews.com: How do you prepare for each episode of War Stories?\n\nNorth: We get a lot of great ideas about particular battles or events from our viewers. But FOX News requires that we have real footage -- either videotape or combat \"mo-pic\" film -- and real eyewitnesses to the events -- people who are actual participants. That means our production team will spend weeks -- sometimes months -- trying to chase down some footage that's relevant to the story. We spend hours interviewing the participants -- and sometimes traveling around the world to find them. We also look for appropriate venues for every episode so that our viewers have a sense for the history we're documenting. Finally, we spend countless more hours editing what we have to make it all fit in a one-hour show. It's not unusual to have 10 or more hours of tape in an episode... so that's quite a challenge.\n\nFoxnews.com: What's the one thing you would like the FOX News Channel audience to know about these shows?\n\n\n\nNorth: For two centuries the people of the United States have dispatched their sons and daughters to far away places to defend the liberties we hold dear and to offer others the hope of freedom. We have never fought for gold or colonial conquest but for the ideals in our own Declaration of Independence and Constitution. No other nation on earth can make such a claim. These are the people we honor in these documentaries. Fifty years from now, these stories will still be relevant. Each episode is a chronicle of courage. They are all part of an extraordinary legacy and help those who see them understand who we Americans really are.\n\nPlease join us for War Stories every Sunday evening at 8 p.m. and 1 a.m .ET on the FOX News Channel."}, {"url": "https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/oliver-north-5035.php", "page_content": "In 1981, he graduated from the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, where he had taken a 'Command and Staff Course'.\n\nHe attended the United States Marine Corps Platoon Leaders Class for a summer.

They kicked off the attack, Sunday, a week ago. They have been at it for eight days. They are exhausted. Nerves are frayed.\n\nThis guy, who apparently did this deed, was wounded himself just hours before this event. He's lost good buddies.\n\nAll of that said, no U.S. military organization can ever have that kind of thing happen without some kind of action being taken to prevent it from happening again.\n\nHANNITY: But with all the \u2014 it has to be, if, in fact, what we think may have happened on the tape, if, after it's fully investigated \u2014 would it be brought into account, well, this guy that's now \u2014 wait a second \u2014 this guy who has risked his life, who has been up now 24/7 for the last eight days, that maybe in a moment of \u2014 made a mistake. Is there any forgiveness for him?\n\nNORTH: Well, I mean, what will happen, is there will be a court \u2014 if, indeed, this thing proves to be a crime. OK? There will be an article 32 investigation conducted by naval intelligence or naval investigative service.\n\nThey will judge whether a crime was committed. Then they will find out who was responsible for the crime, the individual himself, his supervisor, meaning the next small-unit leader, maybe all the way up the chain of command.\n\nHANNITY: This concerns you, though?\n\nNORTH: It has me deeply concerned because \u2014 for two reasons. One, you can never have something like what is alleged take place without some kind of punishment.\n\nNumber two, my concern is that this will become like Abu Ghraib became the story. This will become the story of Fallujah without perspective \u2014 look. You and I, all three of us, know the mainstream media. They are going to jump on this story and make this the story.\n\nWorse yet, the Arab media, Al-Jazeera, Al Arabiya, all of them, are going to make this the story. And what's \u2014 all the good that's being done out there, it will be forgotten. It'll be washed over...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCOLMES: I want to ask you this. What does the military code say about situations like this?\n\nNORTH: The uniform code of military justice is very clear. You cannot shoot when \u2014 there is no such thing as a mercy killing. There is no such thing as a reprisal killing.\n\nCOLMES: Right.\n\nNORTH: You cannot shoot somebody who is unarmed or unable to defend themselves.\n\nCOLMES: Why do we have soldiers in positions where they are working so many hours that maybe it's hard...\n\nNORTH: Because, Alan, it's war. OK? War is what this is all about.\n\nCOLMES: But there are rotations, right?\n\nNORTH: Well, yes, but, I mean, the fact is, I mean, I just wrote a book about this. Those guys went on and stayed on for four years in World War II. This is a terrible, difficult circumstance.\n\nIt is particularly difficult when the enemy is wearing the same clothes as the civilian population around them. It is very difficult when you've been in combat for day after day.\n\nI'm not whining, been there, done that. I'm suggesting to you that the military command out there, from the battalion commander on down, is deeply concerned about it. I can assure you from the battalion commander on up they are deeply concerned about it, because you cannot allow something like this to take place without stopping it dead in its tracks.\n\nCOLMES: Is part of the problem that we don't \u2014 have we not had enough troops in Iraq? Did we not have enough troops to begin with? Are people not being rotated out fast enough?\n\nNORTH: No, Alan, I mean, this is what war is like. I mean, we've kind of gotten used to the 100-hour war from Gulf War I. This is much closer to what real warfare is always like. You know, we've never had \u2014 except for Gulf War I \u2014 an immediate victory.\n\nCOLMES: We've heard story after story about commanders saying, \"We need more troops?\"\n\nNORTH: No, you haven't. No, you haven't. Let me just tell you.\n\nI can assure you that, if any commander had gone back to the national command authority and said, \"I need more troops.\" If General Sanchez came back to the Pentagon and said, \"I need 50,000 more troops,\" he would have had them in a heartbeat, OK?\n\nNo commander has said \u2014 I've been with them, Alan. I have never had a commander out there tell me, \"Gosh, I need another battalion here or I need another regiment there.\" I have never heard it.\n\nHANNITY: All right. We want to come back to this in just a second, and some of the other questions it raises.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nCOLMES: And a page tonight from the HANNITY AND COLMES notebook.\n\nIs there a dream match-up for the Democrats in the 2008 primary? Is it Hillary Clinton versus John Edwards? Well, a brand new Gallup poll shows Senator Clinton comfortably ahead of Senator Edwards 55-35, so maybe it isn't much of a dream for the Edwards camp.\n\nAnd on the Republican side, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani leads the pack with 47 percent with Senator John McCain a distant second at 27 percent. The Rudy versus Hillary Senate race may never have materialized but a run for president, that could be exciting. And we now continue with the host of \"WAR STORIES,\" Oliver North.\n\nYou're smiling at all that...\n\nNORTH: No, no, I just \u2014 we just had an election.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCOLMES: I know, but it's always fun to think of what's going to happen. Before I want to talk about your book, didn't Paul Bremer say he asked for more troops? Zinni has talked about more troops. Abizaid has talked about more troops.\n\nNORTH: Well, no. Nobody in a position of military responsibility has come back to the president or to the secretary of defense or to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and said, \"I need more troops out here.\" And if they had, they would have gotten them.\n\nCOLMES: All right, but you know we have security issues. Powell always said, \"Overwhelming force, exit strategy,\" that's the Powell doctrine. That seemed not to...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nNORTH: Yes, it was great in Gulf War I, but the fact is, this is a different kind of war.\n\nCOLMES: Let me talk about your new book, because you talk about issues having to deal with World War II that have never come to light. We fired first at Pearl Harbor?\n\nNORTH: We did. USS Ward, an hour before the first Japanese bomb drops on Pearl Harbor, the USS Ward engages a midget submarine right outside the submarine net that was across the mouth of Pearl Harbor. Most people don't know. We fired the first shot.\n\nCOLMES: Why has this been so underreported?\n\nNORTH: In part, it's because it wasn't nearly as dramatic as what then transpired. And, of course, everybody has seen that footage of what happens to Pearl Harbor literally an hour later.\n\nCOLMES: Why were we so unprepared?\n\nNORTH: In part because our intelligence was bad and part we did not expect that we were going to be in World War II in part because America was very isolationist. You know, just a little bit more than a month before the start of World War II, FDR finally gets the draft approved by one vote in the Congress of the United States. Astounding.\n\nCOLMES: Japanese had a strategy that almost had them win.\n\nNORTH: Well, what it would have done is, it could have created a situation where they would never have seized Hawaii. They would never have invaded the West coast. They would have gotten their co-prosperity sphere \u2014 Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity sphere and prevented the Allies from seizing the initiative enough to get an unconditional surrender out of them.\n\nCOLMES: Battle of Midway?\n\nNORTH: Turning point of the war. Remember, you got \u2014 and I don't mean you, Alan, specifically, but the left in this country constantly talks about the quagmire of Iraq.\n\nThink about this. For the first six and a half months of World War II, we lost every single solitary battle we were engaged in. There was not a single victory out there. Nobody called for FDR's head on the platter. Nobody stood up in the well of the Congress in the United States and said, \"Let's have an impeachment.\"\n\nCOLMES: We were attacked.\n\nNORTH: Wait a second.\n\nHANNITY: We were attacked here.\n\nNORTH: 9/11, have you forgotten what happened down here?\n\nCOLMES: We were not talked by Iraq.\n\nNORTH: Let me tell you something. Let me ask you, because I know you know the answers. The guy who tried to kill my wife and kids...\n\nCOLMES: Abu...\n\nNORTH: Abu Nidal was found where? Baghdad.\n\nCOLMES: I understand. But you're mixing and matching. We're not talking about September 11th.\n\nNORTH: We're talking about global terrorism. We're talking about a hotbed of terrorists, the very people who are now being rounded up in Fallujah, OK?\n\nThose are terrorists. And if they weren't killing people over there, they would be killing people here.\n\nCOLMES: We went into Fallujah. They say the insurgents escaped...\n\nNORTH: Some.\n\nCOLMES: ... and live to fight them another day. We're going to have to do a Fallujah all over again someplace else, aren't we?\n\nNORTH: Well, of course. In fact, it's happening right as we speak up in Mosul.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nNORTH: We ought to get a team up there to pursue them.\n\nHANNITY: Colonel, first of all, this was a great book. And what I love about it, too, you also include a free DVD, which is very cool, with some war stories.\n\nNORTH: The turning point of the war and all the great stories from these eyewitnesses. This is not a book about me, Sean. This is a book about guys like your dad and mine who were out there fighting that war.\n\nHANNITY: Well, my dad, like so many in that generation \u2014 I mean, you talk about heroism in the Pacific. This is right after Pearl Harbor, he and all his friends signed up and he serves four years in the Pacific.\n\nNORTH: And gone for...\n\nHANNITY: They were gone. They were gone the whole time. And he was a hero there.\n\nAnd so the DVD comes with it, but this is all about, a lot of these stories \u2014 this is great.\n\nNORTH: These are the eyewitnesses, and if people want to see a chapter of it, they can get it by going to warstoriesbook.com. If they want it for Christmas, a signed copy for Christmas, by going to olivernorth.com and it does make a great Christmas gift.\n\nHANNITY: I want to go back to this issue of this tape. Because it's very important to me, because I really am concerned that people want to rush to judgment and attack our brave men and women that have been out there serving, as you have been out there with them.\n\nAnd I just want to point out something that has yet to be pointed out. As people, before they rush to judgment \u2014 \"The New York Times,\" I'm sure the liberal media will do this \u2014 but how many troops have suffered because of booby-trapped bodies that are there? How many guys?\n\nNORTH: Well, I mean, 125 that were killed as of last Friday by IEDs. And I just got an e-mail today from a guy from the unit that I was with \u2014 that covered out there when I was out there this summer, and one of those young guys that I was with just got killed yesterday. And by IEDs, by booby traps, whatever you want to call them.\n\nHANNITY: But they have been purposefully...\n\nNORTH: Oh, yes.\n\nHANNITY: ... and targeting, they put these on bodies. And I'm not..\n\nNORTH: No, these are suicide terrorists.\n\nHANNITY: I'm not making any excuses. We don't know. But I'm asking the American people not to rush to judgment, because the liberal media will rush to judgment.\n\nNORTH: Well, and it's particularly important to remember this. Here's the bottom line of that tape. And everybody is going to see it a thousand times between now and the next month.\n\nWhat is going to happen is that there will be an investigation. There has never been and nor there will ever be an investigation of those who beheaded people on videotapes.\n\nHANNITY: Well, that's, I think, pretty...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nNORTH: Second, if a crime was committed, the individuals who committed it will be prosecuted. That will never happen for those who committed those heinous acts and got away with it.\n\nHANNITY: Yes, and I think people need to know. I am concerned, because we are going to get a rush to judgment. The one thing more than anything else that those guys have earned that have been out there putting their lives on the line for us, the kids that you would put on TV every night, I think they have earned the right to have a fair trial. They have earned the right to tell their side of the story, and...\n\nNORTH: And not for this to become the story. The heroism that's been out there is not going to covered.\n\nHANNITY: The heroism is not going to be told, and it's going to be lost by people that want to exploit one circumstance to make a case about the war in general.\n\nNORTH: Oh, and you count on it.\n\nHANNITY: Oh, it's happening. And that's what scary. But those guys earned the right to tell their side. We weren't there. The video only tells part of the story, and I want to hear the whole story before I come to a conclusion.\n\nNow, if...\n\nNORTH: If something was done wrong...\n\nHANNITY: If he did this wrong, there's going to be punishment.\n\nNORTH: There will be.\n\nHANNITY: And there ought to be.\n\nNORTH: In the American military, this kind of thing can't happen.\n\nHANNITY: Can't happen. It cannot happen.\n\nNORTH: Without some kind of justice being done.\n\nCOLMES: All right. Thanks for being with us. Good to see you.\n\nNORTH: Always a pleasure, Alan.\n\nCOLMES: Good luck with the book.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2004 Fox News Network, L.L.C. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

He trained at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis. During the Vietnam War, he led a marine platoon and was awarded a Silver Star and a Purple Heart. In 1981 President Reagan appointed him deputy-director of the National Security Council. He was later implicated in the Iran-Contra affair and convicted, but by 1990, he was cleared of all charges. In 2018 North was chosen to become the new president of the N.R.A.\n\nOliver North\n\nPresident of the N.R.A.\n\nIn May 2018 North was selected as the new president of the National Rifle Association (N.R.A.), replacing Pete Brownell.\n\n\"Oliver North is, hands down, the absolute best choice to lead our N.R.A. Board, to fully engage with our members, and to unflinchingly stand and fight for the great freedoms he has defended his entire life,\" N.R.A. CEO Wayne LaPierre stated.\n\nCo-president Kris Brown of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence vehemently disapproved of North's selection, stating that: \"Oliver North's very name is synonymous with corruption and disgrace.\"\n\nParents & Career in Armed Forces\n\nFormer U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North was born in San Antonio, Texas on October 7, 1943 to parents Oliver Clay North, an Army major, and Ann Theresa Clancy. He trained at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, and during the Vietnam War led a counter-insurgency marines platoon, receiving a Silver Star and Purple Heart. Appointed a deputy-director of the National Security Council by President Ronald Reagan in 1981, he played a key role in a series of controversial military and security actions.\n\nIran-Contra Scandal and Aftermath\n\nImplicated in the Iran-Contra scandal, involving the supply of arms to Iran in exchange for U.S. hostages and the operation of a secret slush fund to aid the Contra guerrillas in Nicaragua, North was forced to resign in 1986. Found guilty on three of 12 charges arising from the affair, he was given a three-year suspended jail sentence, ordered to do community service and fined $150,000. In 1990 the three convictions were overturned, and all charges were dropped in 1991 by a Federal judge. North later headed a political action group, V-PAC, and gave radio broadcasts. In 1991 he published the memoir Under Fire: An American Story. Additional books include American Heroes: In The Fight Against Radical Islam (2008), American Heroes in Special Operations (2010), Heroes Proved (2012), and American Heroes: On the Homefront (2013).\n\nIn 1994 North ran unsuccessfully for a Virginia seat in the Senate on the Republican ticket. He has gone on to serve as an on-air personality for Fox News, helming the program War Stories, which premiered in 2001 and ended in 2016. North has also co-authored several novels, including 2014's thriller Counterfeit Lies, and served as an episode consultant for the FX TV drama The Americans, among other projects.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nNorth married his wife Betsy in 1967, and together, they have four children.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Oliver North\n\nBirth Year: 1943\n\nBirth date: October 7, 1943\n\nBirth State: Texas\n\nBirth City: San Antonio\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Oliver North, former deputy-director of the National Security Council, was implicated in the Iran-Contra affair and forced to resign.
