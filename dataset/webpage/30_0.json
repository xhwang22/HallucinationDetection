At that point the likes of Blackpool, Motherwell, Partick Thistle and St Mirren were vying for his signature, but the 19-year-old's mother was so impressed by the honest approach of the Aberdeen manager David Halliday that the boy heeded her advice to head north-east from his Lanarkshire home to enlist with the Dons.\n\nBaird, who had starred for Strathclyde Juniors alongside the future Rangers luminary Willie Waddell, was an intelligent fellow who nursed ambitions to be an architect, but his football skills had proved impossible to ignore and now he planned to train in the mornings and study for his future career in the afternoons. However, he made a slow start at Pittodrie, struggling for an impact in this new competitive environment, and he was still featuring for the reserves when war broke out in 1939.\n\nNow, all too soon, the youngster who had viewed joining the Dons as a great adventure was to find himself caught up in an expedition of an altogether more daunting nature, one on which failure surely must have carried fatal consequences.\n\nWhile serving in the medical corps for the ill-fated British Expeditionary Force, he missed the evacuation at Dunkirk but managed to board the last ship out of St Nazaire when France fell in summer 1940. Awaiting his return to the war, Baird was stationed at Headingley, Yorkshire's cricket headquarters, and while he was there he guested for Leeds United, facing top performers of the day such as the Everton trio Tommy Lawton, Joe Mercer and Cliff Britton.\n\nThe respite was brief, though, and he was dispatched to North Africa, where he was part of the force which confronted Rommel in the Western Desert. When Tobruk was taken in the summer of 1942, his field ambulance was surrounded by German tanks and he was captured and handed over to the Italians, who placed him in a prisoner-of-war camp near Rimini on the Adriatic coast.\n\nMany of his fellow detainees died in what he described later as \"a filthy hell-hole\" but Baird, who whiled away some of his time by day-dreaming about his life as a footballer, remained resilient and in 1943, after 18 months of incarceration, he and a comrade, Harold Smith, managed to escape. Knowing that the Allies had landed in Italy, and aiming to join them, the pair headed south into the lower reaches of the Appenines. They lived off the land, helped on their way by sympathetic Italian farmers, and when severe winter weather set in Baird was sheltered for some months by a compassionate family, the Pilottis, who found other safe billetts for Smith and another fugitive who had joined the pair on their trek towards freedom.\n\nWith his sharp and lively mind, Baird picked up Italian quickly, enabling him to pose convincingly as the son of his courageous benefactors, to whom he became devoted and with whom he embarked on a lifelong friendship. \"They were real heroes,\" he said years later. \"They looked after me despite knowing the Germans would have shot them if they had found out.\"\n\nEventually, as Hitler's forces pulled out of Italy, Baird rejoined the Allied ranks and returned to Britain, guesting as a footballer for Aldershot and non-League Falmouth before returning to Aberdeen following his demob in September 1945. Vastly matured by his recent experiences, he was now a far more confident character than the tentative youth he had been during his initial Pittodrie sojourn, and he became established rapidly in the Dons' first team.\n\nOperating as an incisive prompter alongside his close pal and fellow inside-forward George Hamilton and the diminutive spearhead Stan Williams, Baird proved hugely influential as Aberdeen won the Southern League Cup, an emergency wartime competition and the precursor to the soon-to-be-launched Scottish League Cup. They beat Rangers 3-2 in a see-sawing final in front of 135,000 fans at Hampden Park in May 1946 to claim the first big prize since the club's formation in 1903.\n\nThere was reward on a wider front, too, with an appearance for Scotland in the Victory international against Belgium that January, the game finishing 2-2. Because it was classed as an unofficial wartime encounter, no cap was awarded, and that proved to be his sole outing for his country. He was immensely unfortunate because he had excelled against the Belgians, keeping his feet deftly in thick snow on a foggy Hampden afternoon, and had been selected for the next fixture, against England, only to be forced out through injury.\n\nA season later Baird was prominent again as the Dons beat highly-fancied Hibernian 2-1 to win the Scottish Cup, thus securing their first senior trophy and emphasising the progress they had made in finishing third in that term's title race behind Rangers and Hibs. They reached the inaugural League Cup final, too, losing 4-0 to Rangers, and faced the future on a tide of optimism.\n\nBaird, with his clever passing, neat ball skill and happy knack of contributing important goals, was seen as a major plank of Halliday's entertaining side, but he was hampered cruelly by knee problems which demanded three operations, and also he suffered a fractured leg. His best extended run was in 1950-51, when he scored 10 times in 40 league and cup appearances, but after barely figuring in 1952-53, the 34-year-old \u2013 whose overall record of 37 goals in 144 games for Aberdeen would have been far more extensive had he been blessed with fitness on a consistent basis \u2013 accepted a transfer to second-tier St Johnstone.\n\nAt McDiarmid Park Baird enjoyed a fruitful Indian summer, moving back to wing-half and missing only a handful of matches as the Saints twice finished in upper mid-table, then narrowly missed promotion to the top flight in 1955-56, his last campaign.\n\nAfter leaving the game, Baird \u2013 who until his death was believed to be Aberdeen's oldest surviving player \u2013 embarked on a fulfilling and packed life as a sports writer for the Scottish Sunday Express and a PE teacher who rose to become assistant head of Hilton Academy in Aberdeen by the time he retired in 1979. Somehow he even chiselled out the necessary time from his crowded schedule to qualify as a glider pilot.\n\nBaird believed passionately in education, achieving degrees in English and Italian through the University of London by correspondence course in the 1960s then teaching his second language at evening class. A warm, gregarious and charming man who had come to love all things Italian, he moved to Italy for a year from 1980, along with his wife Nancy, to teach English there.\n\nHis attachment to journalism was equally deep \u2013 many of his family members were practitioners, including his brother-in-law Magnus Magnusson and Magnusson's daughter Sally \u2013 and he became a popular columnist on the Aberdeen-based monthly magazine Leopard.\n\nArchie Baird was an author, too, penning a moving autobiography, Family Of Four (1989). It was a book in which his love of football was abundantly evident, but which illustrated eloquently his appreciation of its rightful place when he came to consider the more profound values of life.\n\nIvan Ponting\n\nArchibald MacKechnie Baird, footballer, journalist and teacher; born Rutherglen, Lanarkshire 8 May 1919; played for Aberdeen 1938-53, St Johnstone 1953-56; marriedn (one son, one daughter); died Cove, Aberdeen 3 November 2009."}, {"url": "https://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/archie-baird-2443235", "page_content": "Born: 8 May, 1919, in Rutherglen.\n\nDied: 3 November, 2009, in Cove, Aberdeen, aged 90.\n\nARCHIE Baird, who has died aged 90 after a long illness, was the oldest surviving Aberdeen player and the last survivor of their Scottish Cup-winning side of 1947, the first Dons side to lift a national trophy.\n\nBorn in Rutherglen, the strapping 6ft 2in Baird played inside-right for Strathclyde Juniors, with future Rangers legend Willie Waddell as his right-winger. His ambition was to be an architect, but after he spent a mere six months in the junior ranks, in the face of competition from a handful of clubs, including St Mirren, Partick Thistle, Motherwell and Blackpool, legendary Aberdeen manager David Halliday so impressed Baird's mother that she advised her son to join the Dons. He started, as a 19-year-old, in 1938, on a two-year deal, for a signing-on fee of 20 and 4 a week.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nIn an interview with Aberdeen's Red Web website earlier this year, Baird recalled that travelling north by bus, accompanied by another Willie Waddell, signed from Renfrew Juniors, was a huge adventure.\n\nWaddell quickly broke into the first team, but Baird struggled and was still a reserve when war broke out in September 1939. Within weeks he was conscripted, a move which put paid to his football and the architectural training he was undergoing in the afternoons.\n\nAn army medic, Baird escaped on the last ship out of St Nazaire as France fell in 1940 and six months later, after fitting in a couple of games as a guest for Leeds United while stationed at Yorkshire CCC's Headingley ground awaiting embarkation for Egypt, he found himself in the north African desert, facing Rommell's Afrika Corps. He was one of the Jocks captured at the fall of Tobruk and was sent to an Italian prisoner of war camp near Rimini.\n\nAfter 18 months, Baird and a friend, Harold Smith, escaped and, aware that the Allies, including the Highland Division, had landed in Italy, they headed south, hoping to link up with the advancing British and American forces.\n\nDuring the trek south the pair were helped by Italian peasant families and even sheltered for a time by an Italian family, the Pilottis, who pretended their British \"guests\" were their sons. Baird learned to speak Italian during this \"holiday\" and a life-long friendship was established before the escapees linked up with the advancing Allied forces and returned to active service.\n\nBack in Blighty, Baird guested for Falmouth and Aldershot before a transfer to Edinburgh Castle enabled him to resume playing for Aberdeen and, much more mature after his wartime experiences, he was soon in the first team, making his debut against Hearts in 1945.\n\nHe helped the Dons win the final Southern League Cup of the emergency wartime fixtures and in January 1946, four months after being demobbed, he played for Scotland in a Hampden \"Victory\" international against Belgium, a match played in thick fog on a snow-covered pitch which ended 2-2.\n\nBaird did well enough to keep his place for the next Victory international, against England, but he sustained an injury and had to drop out.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nThe Belgian game was not an official international, so Baird didn't receive a cap for playing. He had, however, recovered from the unfortunate injury to take his place in the Aberdeen team which faced Rangers in the Southern League Cup in May 1946.\n\nBaird gave the underdogs from the North the lead after 90 seconds, beating George Young to a George Hamilton flick-on to score. Aberdeen led 2-0, but Rangers fought back to level before George Taylor grabbed a late winner to give Aberdeen their first piece of silverware.\n\nA year later he was back at Hampden for the real Scottish Cup Final against Hibs \u2013 a match which was a personal triumph for his great friend and teammate Hamilton, and which saw the Dons get the better of the star-studded Hibs side of the time, winning 2-1.\n\nInjuries limited Baird to a mere 144 first-team games for Aberdeen, in which he scored 37 goals before he wound down his career with three years at St Johnstone, retiring in 1956.\n\nHe had by then qualified as a PE teacher, and spent 23 years at Rosemount School. After retiring from playing football, he had a double life, teaching during the week and covering football in the North-east for the Scottish Sunday Express on Saturdays."}, {"url": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/default_content/12608718.archie-baird-footballer/", "page_content": "No sooner had he signed for Aberdeen FC in 1938 than he became part of the generation that was to lose the prime of its football years to the\n\nSecond World War. Nevertheless, he carved out a remark\u00adable career in which he became a kind of Boys\u2019 Own figure, particularly in Aberdeen and the north-east.\n\nLife had begun in Rutherglen in the immediate aftermath of the First World War. With his father a school janitor and local councillor, Baird went from Rutherglen Academy to become an apprentice architect in Glasgow.\n\nBut football dominated his young life, as he joined first Glencairn and then Strathclyde Juniors. There he teamed up with another youngster destined for the heights of Scottish football, by the name of Willie Waddell. As the latter\n\nheaded off to Rangers, Baird was catching the train to Aberdeen, where coincidence played its hand. Having just left one Willie Waddell, he arrived on the same day as another Willie Waddell, who had come to join the Dons from Renfrew Juniors.\n\nThe two shared digs, little knowing that they would play their part in Aberdeen\u2019s first taste of success in years to come. Before that, however, there would be the matter of the Second World War. Baird was off to a dramatic adventure, teaming up with the field ambulance of General Montgomery\u2019s 8th Army as it battled through the ferocity of the North African campaign.\n\nAt the battle of Tobruk, he was captured by the Germans and sent to Italy. But with a characteristic body-swerve, he made a daring escape and found refuge with an Italian peasant family for whom he ploughed, sowed grain and made wine. They, in turn, managed to hide him from the Germans and the friendship lasted for the rest of their lives. He tried to break back to the British lines but eventually had to wait until his own troops arrived.\n\nAfter that escapade, about which he wrote a splendid book, the rigours of Scottish football held few terrors for Baird, who continued to breach enemy lines and elude tight situations when he returned to play for Aberdeen. He was soon playing\n\nfor Scotland against Belgium and was chosen for the Victory International of 1946, though he had to withdraw through injury.\n\nA prominent Scottish sports-writer forecast that Gordon Smith of Hibs and Baird would turn out to be the best right-wing partnership Scotland had ever seen. But cartilage trouble, extending to a broken leg, broken jaw, broken nose and a variety of broken ribs interfered with a career which Baird\n\nstill maintained he thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nHe was home in time for Aberdeen Football Club to win its first-ever trophy, the Scottish League Cup of 1946, when he scored the opening goal in the 3-2 defeat of Rangers. That match was played on May 11 \u2013 surely a good omen for the club\u2019s greatest moment to come. For it was on May 11, 1983, that the Dons won the European Cup-Winners\u2019 Cup in Gothenburg, beating Real Madrid, the greatest club side in the world.\n\nWhen the Dons won the Scottish Cup for the first time in 1947, beating Hibernian 2-1, his friend Willie Waddell was there to share that moment of glory. At 27, Baird had resumed his football life, making the most of what was left of it.\n\nWith football careers cut short by war, there had to be other ways of making a living. Baird had continued his architectural training in Aberdeen but later switched to become a gym teacher. Then he extended that to an honours degree in Italian when he was 50 \u2013 and ended up as assistant headmaster of Hilton Academy. He was a thoroughly rounded man of intelligence and charm.\n\nBaird remained active and alert for most of his days and welcomed visitors to his 90th birthday this year, including his former team-mate Alex Kiddie and current director of football at Pittodrie, Willie Miller. He had been invited to perform an unveiling ceremony at Pittodrie next Wednesday, when the Aberdeen FC Heritage Trust will honour the eight players and staff who lost their lives in the First World War. In the end, however, he had to withdraw from the engagement.\n\nBut Archie Baird will remain one of the all-time heroes of Pittodrie, a man of stature, good humour and an example to up-and-coming footballers. He is survived by his wife Nancy, son Ian and daughter Anne. Also his twin sisters Anna and Mamie, the latter being former journalist Mamie Baird, who became the wife of the late Magnus Magnusson"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/archie.baird/2596340", "page_content": "Archie Baird\n\nassociation football player\n\nMarch 8, 1919 (age 90) Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire, United Kingdom\n\nHe was also capped once by the Scotland national football team Baird signed for Aberdeen before the Second World War, but the war started before he had made the first team He joined the British Army, but was captured and held as a prisoner of war.
