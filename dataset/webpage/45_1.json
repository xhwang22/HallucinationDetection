The NGBL was organized as a professional softball league in 1944 to keep the best players from migrating to the All-American League which was established in 1943. Nonetheless, Twi was one of those who transferred to the AAGPBL despite the NGBL\u2019s best efforts. She signed up to play for the Grand Rapids Chicks in 1945 and continued to be a member of the AAGPBL through the 1950 season.\n\nA solid defensive player, who routinely ranked among league leaders in fielding percentage, Twi was a starter in left field or first base in every game from 1945 to 1950 with few injury-related exceptions. In 1946 she led the league in runs with 78. In 1947, she was a member of the champion Grand Rapids Chicks. Her career totals included 274 runs, 429 hits, and 255 stolen bases. After leaving the AAGPBL, she remained active in sports, played a couple of more years in the NGBL, and enjoyed golf, hiking, and aerobics.\n\nTwi studied at Illinois State Normal and Indiana University and immediately landed a job as a physical education teacher at South Bend\u2019s Washington High School where she inspired kids for nearly 30 years. She also coached the school\u2019s softball and volleyball teams to several city championships.\n\nThose who knew Twi said she had a good sense of humor, civic pride, and was a joy to be around. South Bend Bat Girl, Ruth Davis, a longtime friend of Twi\u2019s who also taught high school in South Bend for 25 years, noted that Twi had a \u201creal dry wit . . . but she was warm and giving. If she heard of someone in need, she was quick to act, but she didn\u2019t seek out recognition after helping people. She was quiet about her charity work, and many weren\u2019t aware of the extent of her involvement.\u201d\n\nDavis recalled that when Twi just turned 70, in 1990, she still referred to her work for Meals-on-Wheels for 15 years as \u201cTaking food to the old people.\u201d Davis also noted that Twi always had \u201ca young and inquisitive mind,\u201d and that \u201cShe took classes at the community college in South Bend while in her 60s just so she could learn.\u201d\n\nBetsy Jochum was an outfielder for the South Bend Blue Sox during Twi\u2019s tenure in the AAGPBL and later became a teacher in South Bend and a friend of Twi\u2019s. She remembered Shively as a fierce competitor. \u201cShe was a good ball player back in a time when women didn\u2019t play sports.\u201d\n\nTwi succumbed to four years of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and a year-long fight with lung cancer in a Douglas, Michigan nursing home on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1999 at the age of 79. According to Gary Umphrey, another longtime friend who looked after Twi during her convalescence, she remained upbeat and lucid even as Alzheimer\u2019s and lung cancer beat her body down. \u201cShe was a sweet woman and I hated to see her uncomfortable,\u201d he said. About five days before she died, Umphrey was commiserating with her and said she defied the way Alzheimer\u2019s usually slurred her speech. \u201cShe opened her eyes, looked at me and said, \u2018I\u2019m not all that uncomfortable.\u2019 And that truly was her spirit\u2014tough to the end.\u201d\n\nSOURCE\n\nCompiled from Twi\u2019s obituary and other articles about her in the South Bend, (IN) Tribune at the end of November and beginning of December 1999."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/twila.shively/1797300", "page_content": "Twila Shively\n\nbaseball player\n\nMarch 20, 1920 (age 79)\n\nAn outfielder, she played from 1945 through 1950 in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.

In 1948, she was reassigned to the Chicago Colleens, a new team. The AAGPBL executives thought she would be a big draw because she had played with the Rockolas for the National Girls Baseball League in Chicago in 1944. She resented the move, liking her Grand Rapids club.

In those early years, Shively faced a number of challenges\u2014chief among them, equipment. \u201cI had no logs, no tractors, no saws. I never had a truck, and had never driven a tractor,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it\u2019s safe to say the learning curve was on the steeper side.\u201d\n\nAnother hurdle was time. Like any good prosciutto, wine, or cheese, a piece of freshly cut timber requires time to cure\u2014for some species it can take up to a decade to become usable. Shively began stockpiling wood that was readily available (he operated a wood-fired pizza truck as a side hustle) and then strategized how to scale his business.\n\nIn spite of the crunchy-ish aims, Shively realized that in order to create a viable business he needed to lean on a necessary evil\u2014capitalism. Crucially, he needed to create a financial incentive for people\u2014tree farmers, landowners, forest rangers, and removal services\u2014to give him felled plants that would otherwise go through a chipper. Generating those incentives, according to Shively, \u201cis perversely the most important thing that I\u2019ve done in my business... You have to create a foundation to another path.\u201d\n\nHe started with small projects\u2014a redwood deck here, a sculpture with a local artist there\u2014but his reputation quickly grew. Some 20 years later, Arborica now encompasses about five acres and holds a small forest\u2019s worth of salvaged timber. Its massive warehouses contain monumental cuts of wood, splayed out like animal hides or veined sections of book-ended marble. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of an appalling spectacle,\u201d Shively says. \u201cIt\u2019s a zoo. It\u2019s cool.\u201d\n\nBurnham, of Envelope A+D, compares Arborica to a high-end boutique. \u201cHe knows where [each log] is\u2014it\u2019s like a friend or a cousin or relative,\u201d he says.\n\nShively exercised just that sort of care when working with Burnham and the Envelope A+D team on San Francisco\u2019s Radhaus beer hall, located in a former Army machine shop in historic Fort Mason. Though the bar concept is German at its core (nearly all the brews on tap are from Germany; the menu features schnitzel, salt-flecked pretzels, and lots of mustard), Radhaus\u2019s owners wanted the interior to be minimal and airy, especially given the building\u2019s landmark status. The Envelope A+D architects knew they wanted to use two large timber elements (five feet, at a minimum, in diameter) to provide a bar and seating. So they called Shively.\n\nFallen trees were repurposed, sustainably, for the Radhaus beer hall in San Francisco. Matthew Millman\n\n\u201cHe had been looking for months and months for the right trees for us,\u201d remembers associate partner Lex Phelan. After an exhaustive search, Shively found the perfect match: two fallen Ponderosa pines from Camp Mather near Yosemite National Park.\n\nFrom there, the sawyer and architects worked together to derive the final products. \u201cWe trusted Evan,\u201d says Burnham. Shively concurs: \u201cWe\u2019re putting our heads together. \u2018Let\u2019s talk about what the arugula is.\u2019\u201d\n\nFirst the pine logs were milled to size, and then Shively hand-cut them to form three monumental timber elements\u2014one exclusively for seating, one that provides both seating and a perch for mugs of beer, and a third that forms the main bar. The logs were so huge, they needed to use forklifts to hoist them into the space (a pin system now holds them in place so that in the event of an earthquake, they stay put). But in situ, the final timber benches\u2014left largely untreated to expose centuries worth of concentric rings\u2014exude a kind of delicacy. Amidst laughter, sloshing pints, and shared meals, the Radhaus project is the perfect example of how\u2014through Shively\u2019s care\u2014two fallen trees can have a second life.\n\nThese moments, says Phelan, are what make Shively\u2019s approach so special. \u201cI think the most important aspect about Evan is the respect that he shows to the material, which is very rare,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that has much more to do with the sustainability than even the sourcing.\u201d\n\nThe sawyer views it more pragmatically. \u201cGrowing up in my family, you spoke when you had something to contribute,\u201d Shively says. \u201cIf you have something to say you are welcomed and encouraged to say it, but if you don\u2019t, you should be doing something else.\u201d"}], "Twila Shively attended the University of California, Berkeley.": [{"url": "https://prabook.com/web/twila.shively/1797300", "page_content": "Twila Shively\n\nbaseball player\n\nMarch 20, 1920 (age 79)\n\nAn outfielder, she played from 1945 through 1950 in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.

She began playing softball at age eight and moved up in the softball ranks in Chicago as early as 1942. By then, she was featured in an article signed by Carl Guldager and published in the Chicago Daily News with this headline: \u201cShe\u2019s Hedy Lamarr of Softball, Twila Shively Looks Like Model, Runs Bases Like Ty Cobb. Has Baseball Savvy Plus Pretty Face\u201d. The NGBL was organized in Chicago to keep the best local players from migrating to the AAGPBL, which had been stabilized in 1943. After that, both circuits competed against each other to see who could associate itself with the biggest stars. Shively entered the AAGPBL in 1945 with the Grand Rapids Chicks, playing for them three years before joining the Chicago Colleens (1948) and Peoria Redwings (1948\u20131950). In her rookie year she formed part of a Chicks outfield that included Thelma Eisen in the center field and Elizabeth Wicken at right field Shively collected a.196 batting average and a.276 on-base percentage in 106 games, driving in 23 runs and scoring 42 times, while her 46 stolen bases ranked her fifth in the league. She also led all outfielders with a.968 fielding percentage and finished second for the most putouts (234) behind Fort Wayne Daisies\" Penny O\"Brian (236). Her most productive season came in 1946, when she posted career numbers in average (247), runs scored (78) hits (101), runs batted in (45), steals (45) and games played (111). Considering the year was great for many pitchers her numbers were quite respectable. Four no-hitters were recorded by Anna Mae Hutchison (Belles), Betty Luna (Blue Sox), Carolyn Morris (Peaches) and Amy Irene Applegren (Lassies), while Connie Wisniewski (Chicks) and Dorothy Wiltse (Daisies) topped the league in earned run average with 0.81 and 0.83, respectively. As a result, more than half of the circuit\"s players averaged under.200. Dorothy Kamenshek (Peaches) was the only hitter to reach the.300 mark (316). She also coached the school\"s softball and volleyball teams to city championships, inspiring children for almost 30 years. Twila Shively died in Douglas, Michigan on Thanksgiving Day, 1999 at the age of 79, after suffering four years of Alzheimer\"s disease and a year-long fight with lung cancer. She is part of the AAGPBL permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, unveiled in 1988, which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual personality."}, {"url": "https://news.berkeley.edu/2021/07/19/in-a-pandemic-year-uc-berkeley-admits-another-outstanding-more-diverse-class/", "page_content": "One year after admitting its most diverse freshmen class in 30 years, the University of California, Berkeley, has met or exceeded last year\u2019s success in its admission of underrepresented minority students for fall 2021.\n\n\u201cWe have admitted a class almost identical to the record-breaking class of last year,\u201d said Olufemi Ogundele, UC Berkeley associate vice chancellor of enrollment management and dean of undergraduate admissions. \u201cFaced with a pandemic and a 28% increase in freshman applications, we remained focused on our values of access, excellence and diversity.

During his lifetime he witnessed profound changes in the relationship between Japan and the United States, and he was one of the main interpreters of Japanese culture to two generations of students and scholars. Berkeley book-ended his career; it was in what was then the Department of Oriental Languages (now East Asian Languages and Cultures or EALC) that he began his teaching career in 1950 and where he received tenure in 1956. He taught at Stanford University from 1962 to 1964, then moved to Harvard University, where he taught for 20 years as a professor both of literature and history before returning to Berkeley as professor-in-residence and head of the East Asian Library in 1982, positions from which he retired in 1992, after more than four decades of extraordinary commitment and contribution to building the field of Japanese studies in this country.\n\nHe was born in Kyoto, Japan's ancient capital city, in 1921, of missionary parents. Though Japan was at that time experiencing a period of unprecedented receptivity to Western political ideals, technology, and fashions, some of the population could still remember the age of shogunal rule and the last years of the country's more than two centuries of enforced seclusion from the Western world. Kyoto in particular was the center of traditional culture, and Shively passed his early years attracted both to ancient Japanese literature, music, and art, and to American sports, at which he excelled at the Canadian Academy in K\u00f4be, and American jazz. Throughout his life he remained a crack tennis player and aficionado of American popular music.\n\nBut that era when Shively could live in the disparate worlds of the Japanese past and the American-influenced present ended with the rise of Japanese militarism in the 1930s. He eventually left Japan for Harvard University, where his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War II, at which point he enlisted in the Marines as a Japanese language officer, rose to the rank of major, and was awarded the Bronze Star. He thereafter returned to Harvard, graduating summa cum laude in 1946, then obtained in rapid succession his master's degree in 1947 and his Ph.D. in 1951 in classical Japanese literature. Few, if any, in that field have mastered in so short a time even the literary tools (classical and modern Japanese and literary Chinese) needed for a doctorate on a topic in premodern Japanese literature, much less completed the necessary research on the topic itself. Shively's speed to degree was matched by the excellence of his doctoral dissertation, \u201cThe Love Suicide at Amijima,\u201d which provided a translation and study of one of the major plays of Chikamatsu Monzaemon, centering on the conflict between the main character's love for a woman of the pleasure quarters and his duty to his family. The dissertation, with its combination of fluent translation and stylish literary and cultural contextualization, was published by Harvard University Press in 1953 and remains a classic a half century after its appearance; it was reprinted by the University of Michigan Press in 1991.\n\nThe dissertation marked the beginning of a professional scholarly career that would focus on the urban life and popular culture of Japan's Early Modern or Edo period (1600\u20131868), the age when Japan closed its doors to most of the outside world and developed the unique traditions of ukiyo-e woodblock prints, Kabuki drama, and haiku poetry that remain among Japan's most important cultural legacies. Shively went on to write about Matsuo Bash\u00f4, doubtless Japan's most famous classical poet, and then on Kabuki drama and its tense relationship with the shogunate, whose leaders were intent on maintaining a severe Confucian social order in the face of a bourgeoning townsman culture, very much as the Japanese government would later curtail individual liberties during Shively's own formative years. The response of Confucian philosophy to social change was the subject of other important works by Shively, including \u201cMotoda Eifu: Confucian Lecturer to the Meiji Emperor,\u201d \u201cNishimura Shigeki, A Confucian View of Modernization,\u201d and \u201cThe Japanization of the Middle Meiji.\u201d His work therefore ran the gamut from recondite philosophy to the history of popular entertainments, in an era when the latter was seldom considered worthy of serious scholarship. He was far ahead of most of his colleagues in recognizing the importance of these popular arts, and was in a sense a precursor of today's field of cultural studies.\n\nJapan's response to modernity and the West, aspects of which Shively had witnessed firsthand, became the subject of a volume he edited in 1971, Tradition and Modernization in Japanese Culture (Princeton University Press). The previous year he had coedited another volume, Personality in Japanese History (University of California Press), to which he contributed a notable essay on the shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, who ruled during the great cultural efflorescence of the Genroku period, the brilliant age of Bash\u00f4 and Chikamatsu. In 1991 Shively brought together a lifetime of research in a major article for the Cambridge History of Japan, \u201cPopular Culture of the Edo Period,\u201d which evokes the panorama of the era's vibrant literary, theatrical, musical, and artistic activity, the society of the licensed pleasure quarters, the birth of commercial publishing, and the role of shogunal censorship.\n\nEven before completing his dissertation, Shively had already assumed his first teaching position, and for the next half-century he provided both personal instruction and a growing body of scholarship to his successors. Professor Susan Matisoff, who is now retired from Berkeley's EALC department, bore witness to his importance to the development of our field when she recalled that when she was an undergraduate, her professor assigned all of Shively's publications. I studied under him years later during my master's program at Harvard, taking his classes on Edo literature and on legal and epistolary styles of classical Japanese, experiencing firsthand his combination of organized exposition and dry wit. I was particularly lucky to have had that opportunity, since few specialists at that time were as well versed as he in those writing styles, which are central to the study of Early Modern texts.\n\nIt was as a young professor at Berkeley that Donald Shively began an administrative career matched by few others in the field, serving as the chair of the Center for Japanese Studies. After he arrived at Harvard in 1964, he directed the Japan Institute for eight years, for four of those years also chairing the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations. The range and importance of his professional service to the field is breathtaking. He was editor of the two most important journals in our field, one after the other, for a total of 12 years, and also served for a decade as director of the American Oriental Society. His public service outside the University was equally wide-ranging, including terms as a member of the National Commission for UNESCO, as the chair of the U.S. delegation to the Committee for U.S.-Japan Cultural and Educational Exchange in the Department of State, and as director of the Japan Society of Boston.\n\nHe retired from Harvard and returned to the Bay Area after his wife, Professor Mary Elizabeth Berry, herself an eminent historian of premodern Japan, joined Berkeley's Department of History. Here, Shively assumed the leadership of Berkeley's East Asian Library, a particular challenge because of the size and excellence of the collection. One of his most important contributions was bringing a research team from Japan to catalogue the Mitsui Collection, the largest corpus of early Japanese printed books and maps outside Japan, which Berkeley had acquired after the Second World War but had not been able adequately to survey. The collection is enormous and the work on it was prolonged, but a published catalogue resulted that for the first time turned this valuable collection into a useable resource. With characteristic energy and organization, Shively also continued his scholarly research activities, coediting a volume of the Cambridge History of Japan, and writing the above-mentioned survey of Edo popular culture for a different volume in the same series, as well as his administrative contributions, serving as director of the Society for Asian Art at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco, and then as director of the Japan Society of Northern California.\n\nShively's groundbreaking research, wide-ranging teaching, and administrative leadership led to the Japanese government awarding him the Order of the Rising Sun in 1982.\n\nI only knew the public and professional Donald Shively. As a young graduate student, I found him dauntingly erudite, and my respect for him only increased after I joined the Berkeley faculty and learned more of the full sweep and importance of his contributions. He used words sparingly and with forethought, and like few others he knew the value of silence. His generosity was also of a quiet kind; when I began my graduate career at Harvard, he arranged financial support for me, but I would never have known who had initiated it until I was informed by someone else. He was a man of great dignity and depth, and his appreciation of literature, music, and the visual arts was abiding.\n\nThe fields of Japanese literature and history have finally come of age in the United States; some Americans now teach Japanese cultural subjects at Japanese universities, and literary and historical journals in that country now routinely publish articles by American scholars. This was not the case when Donald Shively entered the world of academe. What the field is today, it owes in no small part to him."}, {"url": "https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/about-us/information-center/long-run-outcomes-uc-berkeley-alumni", "page_content": "How do the graduates of California\u2019s public research universities contribute to California\u2019s economy over the course of their careers, and how have their economic outcomes differed for alumni from different demographic groups and with different college majors? This topic brief visualizes a novel database linking the student transcript of every student to graduate from one such university \u2013 the University of California, Berkeley \u2013 since the 1960s to wage and employment records over the four decades following their graduation. The resulting dashboards generate many new insights into the Berkeley educational experience and the economic successes achieved by its undergraduate alumni over the decades following graduation.\n\nLongitudinal enrollment at UC Berkeley\n\nWhile much is known about the institutional history of UC Berkeley \u2014 founded in 1868 as California\u2019s land grant university, Berkeley has expanded into the ten-campus University of California system and consistently ranked as one of the world\u2019s premier research universities \u2014 until now, less was known about the hundreds of thousands of undergraduate students who have graduated from Berkeley over the past 60 years, particularly after they leave Berkeley\u2019s campus. The previous dashboard shows the number and demographics of UC Berkeley undergraduates since the 1960s, showing how the campus has grown and diversified over time, with a clear decline in Black and Hispanic enrollment after Prop 209 prohibited affirmative action in 1998. You can see these alternative demographic views by toggling the parameter in the upper-right-hand corner.\n\nThe purpose of these dashboards \u2013 part of a series that will eventually cover all ten UC campuses \u2013 is to provide a clearer picture of what happens to UC Berkeley\u2019s students after they leave campus. You\u2019ll see that, by the middle of their careers, almost one in three of Berkeley\u2019s natural science majors are working in the Health Care industry, though those who took a number of Humanities courses as well are overrepresented in the higher education industry. You\u2019ll also see the striking persistence of course-taking in Berkeley\u2019s Humanities departments; 18 percent of Berkeley course enrollments were in those departments in 1975, compared to 16 percent in 2014, with little variation in between (though the proportion of Humanities majors has declined somewhat).\n\nBut the most obvious takeaway of these data is the broad economic success of Berkeley graduates, and their contributions to the state as a whole. By their late 30s, more than 75 percent of Berkeley graduates working in California have higher median earnings than the state median household income. Over 5 percent work in California\u2019s Tech industry and 10 percent work in finance, insurance, and real estate, but more than 10 percent work at one point or another in California\u2019s K-12 education system.\n\nThis series of dashboards uses newly-digitized and compiled data from the UC ClioMetric History Project to visualize Berkeley alumni\u2019s UC experiences and alumni outcomes in the state of California. Take a look at our methodology, and its associated disclaimers and caveats, on our Data and Methodology page. All of the presented visualizations are restricted to UC Berkeley undergraduates who completed at least 10 courses at the campus.\n\nThe second dashboard below shows the distribution of students\u2019 majors and courses while at Berkeley since the 1960s. The natural sciences have always played an important role in the Berkeley education, and that role has been swiftly expanding since the mid-2010s with the rise of computer and data science. Engineers have persistently made up more than 10 percent of graduates, but over 40 percent of course enrollments have always been taught in the humanities and social sciences. The \u2018Advanced Toggle\u2019 allows you to restrict the data to students who took courses in the specified number of academic departments.\n\nLongitudinal course and major choices at UC Berkeley\n\nThe third dashboard visualizes the distribution of Berkeley graduates\u2019 inflation-adjusted California wages from graduation through retirement. Berkeley alumni exhibit gender and ethnicity gaps that mirrors that of the state and the nation \u2013 you can see this by toggling the `baseline\u2019 and `comparison\u2019 distributions to different genders or ethnicities \u2013 but wages are generally high and exhibit strong growth in the early years of students\u2019 careers. The median Berkeley graduate working in California was earning wages above the California household median by age 27, and more than 10 percent of graduates earn over $300,000 by age 40, providing spillover benefits across the state economy. In addition to the \u2018Advanced Toggle\u2019 described above, here you can also restrict the comparison student sample to those who took specified numbers of courses in specific disciplines (like the Humanities).\n\nThe data also show the exceptional wages earned by UC Berkeley graduates in particularly-lucrative fields of study. If you toggle the \u201cPopular majors\u201d Comparison parameter on the right, you\u2019ll see that Berkeley computer science majors have median wages of $200,000 in their early 40s, and substantially more than ten percent of Berkeley economics majors have earnings above $500,000 by their late 40s. While the school\u2019s English majors have lower-than-average earnings for Berkeley alumni, more than half nevertheless earn over $100,000 throughout their career, and more than 10 percent earn over $250,000 annually.\n\nLongitudinal UC Berkeley alumni wage outcomes\n\nNext: in what industries were Berkeley alumni earning their wages? The fourth dashboard shows the distribution of Berkeley alumni\u2019s careers in California, again following alumni all the way through retirement. Graduates\u2019 first jobs might be in Food, Accommodation, or Retail, but after a couple of years they\u2019re much more likely to be working in Business Services, Health Care, and Finance, with around 1 percent who work for Berkeley itself. While students with majors in professionally-oriented fields are more likely to work in related industries, the relationship is far from perfect; students from every major end up employed in every segment of California\u2019s economy.\n\nLongitudinal industry of employment for UC Berkeley alumni\n\nFinally, how stable were the careers taken by Berkeley graduates? The last dashboard below visualizes the frequency with which Berkeley alumni switched between employers, industries, and geographic regions. At age 30, only 40 percent of Berkeley\u2019s alumni had been working for their employer for five years, though that number rises to 75 percent at age 55. Indeed, 30 percent of Berkeley alumni switch industries between ages 35 and 40, with engineering majors (and especially computer science majors) more likely to switch at every stage of their careers.\n\nLongitudinal employment stability for UC Berkeley alumni\n\nIn sum, these new visualizations present a new perspective into the educational experiences and lives of alumni of the University of California, Berkeley. You can see similar dashboard series for other UC campuses from the UC longitudinal alumni dashboards landing page. In all, these data provide a more complete picture of the studies and California employment trajectories of the hundreds of thousands of alumni who have flowed through the state\u2019s research university system."}, {"url": "https://www.berkeley.edu/about/history-discoveries/", "page_content": "The Cal alma mater is written and composed by Clinton R. \u201cBrick\u201d Morse, class of 1896.\n\nHail to California Hail to California, Alma mater dear.

Originally charged with providing education (both \"practical\" and \"classical\") to the state's people, Berkeley gradually established a distinguished faculty (with 31 Nobel prizes held by alumni) and overn 184 academic departments and programs. This California institution became a catalyst of economic growth and social innovation \u2014 the place where vitamin E was discovered, a lost Scarlatti opera found, the flu virus identified, and the nation's first no-fault divorce law drafted. Scholars at Berkeley have conducted groundbreaking research on topics ranging from urban street gangs to basic human nutritional requirements. They have identified why wartime supply ships were failing at sea, invented technologies to build faster and cheaper computer chips, and imaged the infant universe. In accordance with UC's \"public\" character, the university has long served talented individuals regardless of means. As early as 1897, financial aid was available for \"needy and deserving\" students. More than a century later, UC Berkeley combines outstanding teaching and research programs with broad access for students of all means \u2014 educating more federal Pell Grant recipients from low-income families than all eight Ivy League universities combined. Twenty-three percent of UC Berkeley freshmen are the first in their families to attend college. For more information, visit the UC Berkeley gateway site and check out Berkeley: By the Numbers. The University of California The University of California is composed of 10 campuses, each with a distinctive character: San Francisco (established in 1873), Davis (1909), Los Angeles (1919), Riverside (1954), Santa Barbara (1958), San Diego (1960), Irvine (1965) Santa Cruz (1965), and Merced (2005). The University has five law schools, six medical schools, as well as schools of architecture, business administration, education, engineering, and many others. Several hundred laboratories, extension centers, and research and field stations strengthen teaching and research while providing public service to California and the country. Over 238,000 students attend the University of California and about 75 percent of them are California residents. For more information about the University of California, please visit the University of California website. Organization and Administration Under the State Constitution, the government of the University is entrusted to the Board of Regents. The regents appoint the president of the University, and with the president\u2019s advice, appoint the chancellors, directors of major laboratories, provosts, and deans who administer the affairs of the individual campuses and other divisions of the University. Authority in academic matters is delegated by the regents to the Academic Senate, which determines academic policy for the University as a whole. The Board of Regents includes seven ex-officio board members and 18 members who are appointed by the governor for 12-year terms after consultation with an advisory committee. In addition, the regents appoint a student regent for a one-year term as a voting board member with full rights of participation. The chair and vice chair of the Academic Council serve as faculty representatives to the board and participate fully in all discussions. A constitutional amendment provides that \u201cRegents shall be able persons broadly reflective of the economic, cultural, and social diversity of the State, including ethnic minorities and women.\u201d They shall have \u201cfull powers of organization and government, subject only to such legislative controls as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of the endowments of the University and the security of its funds.\u201d The president is the executive head of the ten-campus University system. The Office of the President, located in Oakland, is the University\u2019s central administrative headquarters. There are eight divisions: Academic Affairs, Agriculture and Natural Resources, Business Operations, External Relations, Finance, General Counsel, Health Sciences and Services, and Laboratory Management. The Office of the President performs administrative functions for the University as a whole and supports all campus operations. Each of the campuses has a chancellor as its chief administrative officer. The chancellor is responsible for the organization and operation of the campus, including academic, student, and business affairs. Officers of Administration The Academic Senate is empowered by the Regents to determine academic policy, set conditions for admission and granting of degrees, advise the Chancellor on the campus budget, authorize and supervise courses and curricula, and advise the administration on faculty appointments, promotions, and budgets. Students participate in policymaking at both the campus and University-wide levels. For more information, please visit the Board of Regents website.

She was born at Alta Bates Hospital, excelled in the city\u2019s public schools and could literally find her way around her hometown blindfolded.\n\nHer older twin brothers begged her to leave the nest, as they had done. But the universe had other ideas.\n\n\u201cI really wanted to go to UCLA, but I got rejected. I got rejected from Stanford. I got rejected from USC. I got rejected from pretty much everywhere,\u201d says Boser. \u201cBerkeley was by far the best college that I got into, and even though I wanted to get away from my hometown, Cal ended up being exactly the right fit for me.\u201d\n\nBoser, 21, a major in statistics with a perfect 4.0 GPA, is this year\u2019s winner of the University Medal, UC Berkeley\u2019s highest honor for a graduating senior. The prize comes with $2,500.\n\nA sense of purpose and humor\n\nAmong other achievements, she has conducted field research on the spread of HIV in rural French Guiana; the effects of early marriage on the status of women in Niger, where she survived malaria; and the health impacts of wildfire smoke versus prescribed burns in Northern California. Some of her results have been published in journal papers, and others are pending publication.\n\nAs an emergency medical technician with the Berkeley Medical Reserve Corps, Boser assisted victims of the 2018 Camp Fire that destroyed the town of Paradise in Butte County. She\u2019s also a harpist, violinist, swimmer and windsurfer, has a black belt in judo and is fluent in French.\n\n\u201cMs. Boser is exactly the type of emerging citizen-scientist who should receive a University Medal. She possesses both a genuine passion for science as well as for helping those who are struggling, whether it is academically, socially or culturally,\u201d wrote UC Berkeley associate professor Matthew Potts, the S.J. Hall Chair of Forest Economics, in his letter recommending Boser for the medal.\n\nAs with most of her scholarly ambitions, Boser applied for the University Medal on a whim. So, when she got the call on a recent Saturday from UC Berkeley bioengineering professor Gerard Marriott, chair of the committee that selects the University Medalist, she was wary. The longer he spoke, the more suspicious she became.\n\n\u201cHe talked about how it was really hard to make a decision this year, and that everyone was really competitive, and that several candidates deserved to get the medal, and I was thinking, \u2018Why are you taking so long to tell me I didn\u2019t get the medal? This is so painful,\u2019\u201d she recalls.\n\n\u201cAnd then he said, \u2018This is the fifth call I\u2019m making today, and you\u2019ve got the medal.\u2019 I spent the next 15 minutes jumping in place.\u201d\n\nNormally, UC Berkeley\u2019s top graduating senior gives a speech to thousands of the student\u2019s peers at a campus-wide commencement ceremony in California Memorial Stadium. But with the specter of COVID-19 hanging over large gatherings on and off campus this spring, summer and possibly beyond, university leaders are still determining when and how to celebrate the Class of 2020.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely disappointed. There are a lot of things we graduating seniors were looking forward to that we won\u2019t be able to do,\u201d Boser says. \u201cBut despite all the things we\u2019ve lost, we\u2019ve also gained a lot of opportunities. And so, if we focus on those, we may come out of it better than we thought we would.\u201d\n\nDriven by \u2018deep-seated guilt\u2019\n\nCalifornia\u2019s stay-at-home orders haven\u2019t made a dent in Boser\u2019s work ethic. Lately, she\u2019s been working on a simulation project that measures the effect of interventions like school closures and quarantine on the spread of COVID-19 in the Bay Area.\n\nWhen asked what drives her to want to alleviate poverty and suffering, she doesn\u2019t miss a beat.\n\n\u201cDeep-seated guilt,\u201d she deadpans. \u201cThe world has given me everything I could possibly ask for, and I\u2019m so grateful. But I also think it\u2019s so unfair. I want everyone to be able to have the same, and so I have to do my part so other people can have what I have.\u201d\n\nMeet the runners-up Four brilliant graduates were finalists for the University Medal.\n\nFortunately, her privilege has been a force for good: \u201cThis ability to extend her personal ideals and passion to the broader social good is a truly wonderful quality,\u201d Potts wrote.\n\nHer father, Bernhard Boser, is a Swiss-born professor of electrical engineering at UC Berkeley. Her mother, Isabelle Guyon, is a French-born data scientist and pioneer in machine learning. Her brothers, Thomas, a data scientist, and Philip, an engineer, graduated from UC Santa Cruz and UC Riverside, respectively.\n\n\u201cAll my family members are hardcore overachievers, particularly the women,\u201d she says.\n\nWhile she grew up admiring her parents\u2019 academic and innovative pursuits, she wasn\u2019t always crazy about their ideas of fun.\n\n\u201cMy dad is obsessed with hiking and camping and backpacking, so he would drag us to do all those things, and me and my brothers developed a deep hatred for outdoor recreation very early on in life,\u201d she says. \u201cWe absolutely despised it.\u201d\u2019\n\nBoser started her formal schooling at the French-American Ecole Bilingue in the city of Berkeley, then spent second grade at a school in Switzerland. After developing a passion for the harp \u2014 which she still plays regularly \u2014 she attended The Crowden School in Berkeley, where she learned to play the violin.\n\nAn \u2018F\u2019 in socializing\n\nAt Berkeley\u2019s Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School, she broadened her academic interests and social circle. And while academics came easily to her at Berkeley High, she struggled with friendships.\n\n\u201cI was that weird kid who dressed weird, who talked too much and was too loud, and I\u2019m still just like that,\u201d she says. \u201cI totally failed at socializing in high school.\u201d\n\nEven more challenging was her junior year at the Lyc\u00e9e International de Valbonne in France, where she completed the notoriously difficult French-language baccalaureate.\n\n\u201cFrench kids dress nice and write nice. I wear sweatpants to school,\u201d she says. Some classmates even dressed up as her for the annual French carnival: \u201cI was their idea of a typical American,\u201d she laughs.\n\nBack at Berkeley High for her senior year, she found that her old friends had found new friends, setting her back socially. Eventually, though, she got back into a groove and graduated in 2016.\n\nBut her bids to elite public and private universities were rejected, leaving her hometown university as her best option.\n\n\u201cI was definitely bummed. I\u2019ve been here my whole life,\u201d she says. \u201cBut my parents let me stay in the dorms, and I was pleasantly surprised. Turns out growing up in Berkeley and going to college at UC Berkeley are two totally different worlds.\n\n\u201cPlus, it was kind of cool when my friends would ask about what to do in Berkeley, and I\u2019d say, \u2018Have you been to the Tilden Little Farm?\u2019\u201d\n\nOn campus, Boser discovered she was more of a doer and problem solver than a political activist. For example, during the 2017 campus protests against right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, Boser and her friends were putting together an app for the campus\u2019s Big Ideas innovation contest.\n\nWhen they received a news alert on their smartphones about vandalism on Sproul Plaza, they seriously doubted that Berkeley students were involved.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, we love the Amazon store. You have to understand that about Cal students,\u201d Boser says. \u201cThe Amazon store is, like, sacred.\u201d\n\nContrary to her childhood contempt for the outdoors, she was now becoming fairly fanatical about hiking, camping and backpacking and looked for ways to integrate her interests in the environment and public health.\n\n\u201cMostly, I just wanted to work with trees,\u201d she says. At the same time, she was interested in how to empower the world\u2019s most vulnerable communities.\n\nGlobal public health warrior\n\nAnd so, the summer after her freshman year, she headed to French Guiana to study how HIV was being spread among poor rural communities along the French-Brazilian border. The trip was successful and emboldened her to apply for an Undergraduate Research Apprentice Program fellowship to study women\u2019s empowerment in the impoverished African nation of Niger.\n\nThe following summer in Niger, Boser was hit with culture shock \u2014 and malaria, from which she quickly recovered. Embedded with locals living in abject poverty, she soon found herself challenging Western assumptions about what\u2019s best for women in developing countries. Her analysis is presented in a soon-to-be-published journal paper.\n\n\u201cThe women in Niger had really strong social and economic reasons for opting to marry early, so giving them a viable alternative to early marriage, such as a quality education, should be a priority,\u201d she says.\n\nShe returned to UC Berkeley feeling somewhat deflated from her time in West Africa, though it didn\u2019t keep her from earning all A\u2019s for courses in calculus, linear algebra, chemistry, physics, epidemiology, music, psychology and sociology.\n\nThings started looking up when she completed her EMT training and joined the Berkeley Medical Reserve Corps. She worked with victims of the 2018 Camp Fire, then went on to train and deploy volunteers to major catastrophes.\n\n\u201cBeing an EMT really energized me and gave me this wonderful new family,\u201d she says.\n\nMeanwhile, she completed \u201ctwo of the most challenging introductory statistics courses in the country,\u201d wrote Adam Lucas, a UC Berkeley statistics lecturer, in his glowing letter recommending Boser for the University Medal.\n\nUnlike academics who are deeply focused on their fields of study for years at a time, Boser is more project-oriented.\n\n\u201cWhat I like about public health is that the goal is to make the public healthy, and you can do that in so many different ways, from community outreach to creating an app or a vaccine,\u201d she says.\n\nBut ultimately, she says she chose to major in statistics, albeit at the last minute, because it yields fast and effective results and provides \u201cthe big picture\u201d that she finds so satisfying in her research.\n\nFlying the nest\n\nThis fall, Boser is headed to UC Santa Barbara to pursue a Ph.D. in environmental science and management. Her doctoral studies will be funded by a National Science Foundation graduate research fellowship and a Eugene Cota-Robles fellowship.\n\nShe had planned to hike the Pacific Crest Trail this summer, but the coronavirus pandemic has put that on the back burner.\n\nIronically, after all her friendship struggles at Berkeley High and during her first two years at UC Berkeley, she\u2019s living in a house with six of her best friends. They eat meals together, goof around together and binge-watch the Netflix series \u201cTiger King\u201d and Marvel superheroes movies.\n\n\u201cI finally succeeded in getting the best friend group in the world,\u201d she says proudly, then adds, \u201cAnd I can do it again.\u201d\n\nFor her graduation, she and her housemates are planning a porch ceremony. One will stand in for Chancellor Carol Christ and give opening remarks. Another will dress as Captain America and give a keynote speech.\n\nAs for bidding farewell to UC Berkeley, she says, \u201cI\u2019m really excited, but I\u2019m also sad because it\u2019s been so perfect for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill, at some point,\u201d she says wistfully, \u201cI have to leave the nest.\u201d\n\nAnd you can practically hear her big brothers breathe a twin sigh of relief."}, {"url": "https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/university-of-california-berkeley-1312", "page_content": "University of California, Berkeley is a public institution that was founded in 1868.
