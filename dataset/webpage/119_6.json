During his time in the Assembly, he served as a member of various committees, including the Social Development Committee, Public Accounts Committee, Health Committee, Environment Committee, Finance Committee, and Agriculture Committee. He is also the UUP spokesperson on Social Development.\n\nBeggs is known for his actions in 2003, when he successfully lobbied Aer Lingus to remove Irish rebel music from their in-flight entertainment.

He likened the situation to \"the speeches of Osama Bin Laden being played on a trans-Atlantic Arabian airline.\" Aer Lingus removed the material from their flights immediately, stating that it should never have been on board in the first place.\n\nThroughout his career, Beggs has been known for his commitment to public safety and community development. He has been a strong advocate for increasing funding for mental health services, improving road safety, and promoting economic development in Northern Ireland. He has also been a vocal opponent of political violence and sectarianism, and has worked tirelessly to build bridges between different communities in the region.\n\nOverall, Roy Beggs Jr is a well-respected politician with a long track record of public service. His dedication to the people of East Antrim and Northern Ireland as a whole has earned him the admiration of his constituents and colleagues alike. As he moves on from his role as an MLA, his legacy will continue to be felt throughout the region for many years to come.\n\nElection results\n\nRoy Beggs Jr, a seasoned politician and long-standing member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, suffered a shock defeat in the 2022 election at the hands of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland. This brought to an end his uninterrupted run of electoral successes since 1998.\n\nBeggs Jr had been a force to be reckoned with in the political landscape, having won the popular vote in two separate elections, and had been a key player in the Unionist cause for decades. However, his failure to secure re-election in 2022 has left many wondering where it all went wrong.\n\nDespite starting strong with a 16.1% share of the vote in 1998, Beggs Jr's popularity dwindled over time, with just 10.2% of the vote in 2007. While he had always been a prominent figure in Unionist politics, it seems that his appeal may have waned in recent years.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Assembly is a notoriously volatile arena, with the political landscape shifting rapidly over time. Beggs Jr may have fallen foul of this instability, finding himself out of step with the changing attitudes of the electorate.\n\nOr perhaps it was simply a case of the Alliance Party capitalizing on a moment of weakness, seizing the opportunity to make their mark on the political landscape. Whatever the case, Beggs Jr's defeat is a timely reminder that no one can take electoral success for granted.\n\nIn the cutthroat world of politics, it's important to remain vigilant and adaptable, constantly reassessing one's position and staying on top of the latest trends and developments. Beggs Jr's defeat may be a bitter pill to swallow, but it serves as a valuable lesson for politicians everywhere.\n\nAs for the Alliance Party, they can take heart in their triumph, but they must not rest on their laurels. The political landscape is ever-changing, and they will need to remain vigilant if they hope to maintain their newfound dominance. One thing is certain, the Northern Ireland Assembly will remain a hotly contested arena for many years to come."}, {"url": "https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/former-uup-mla-roy-beggs-24111354", "page_content": "We have more newsletters\n\nSomething went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nWant the biggest political stories and analysis sent to you every week?

On that occasion, the sitting Ulster Unionist MP, Mr Roy Beggs, was duly returned without difficulty.\n\nThis time around, though, things might be different. For a start, the Roy Beggs in this election is the MP's son, making his election debut. Many observers feel that Beggs senior's involvement in Drumcree, the blockade of Larne port and his opposition to the Northern Ireland Agreement might just rebound on Beggs junior.\n\n\"A lot of people blame Roy Beggs senior for the decision by Stena Sealink to move its operations from Larne to Belfast,\" the main Alliance candidate, Mr Sean Neeson, says. \"And the sight of him sharing a platform with Ian Paisley two weeks before the referendum caused further discontent.\"\n\nMr Neeson is reflecting a new pragmatism palpable in this mixed industrial, agricultural and commuter-belt constituency. Jobs are hard to come by and politicians have to factor in the economic impact of their actions before they take to the barricades.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nBeggs junior - a 35-year-old technical manager who is described as a \"soft No\" on the agreement - should be safe enough for one of the six seats. The real question is whether he can bring in one or both of his running-mates, Mrs May Steele and Mr Ken Robinson. Last year his father captured almost 39 per cent of the vote, equivalent to about 2 1/2 quotas in the Assembly election. With nationalist transfers, the UUP could capture three seats.\n\nHowever, Mr Neeson will also be chasing these transfers in the hope of bringing in his colleague, Mr Stewart Dickson. The first Catholic mayor of Carrickfergus, Mr Neeson is hoping to take advantage of his high profile within Alliance to win across-the-board support.\n\nEast Antrim stretches from the Belfast suburbs of Whiteabbey and Jordanstown to the coastal towns of Larne and Carrickfergus and then up to the more southerly Glens of Antrim around Carn lough. This used to be a Protestant industrial heartland, centred on giant fibre factories such as the long-closed Courtaulds and ICI. Transport is a major issue, as the volume of commuter traffic continues to grow. The roads and motorways seem luxurious by the Republic's standards, but local politicians want to see further improvements and they want to have a say in their implementation.\n\nThe UUP's Ken Robinson, a retired school principal, says he is \"fed up being a second-class citizen in my own country. I saw it in school, how decisions, however wrong, were always being made over our heads.\"\n\nMr Jack McKee, a long-time supporter of Ian Paisley, is leading the DUP challenge. He denies wanting to \"wreck\" the Assembly, but says he will be \"policing\" the promises made by Tony Blair and David Trimble - \"promises I fully expect them to break\". If Mr McKee, a councillor from Larne, can improve on the 19 per cent he achieved last year, his running-mate, Mr David Hilditch, might just be in with a chance of the last seat.\n\nMr Danny O'Connor is running again for the SDLP, but is unlikely to pick up more than half the nationalist vote in the constituency, estimated at 10 per cent. Sinn Fein is standing Mrs Chrissie McAuley, a councillor in Belfast who garnered 500 votes in the Westminster election. The party has little support outside the coastal village of Carnlough.\n\nThe first four seats are expected to go to the UUP (two), DUP and Alliance. The DUP, Alliance and Belfast man Mr Terence Dick for the Conservative Party are likely to slug it out for the last two seats.\n\nCandidates: Terence Dick (Conservative); Roy Beggs junior, Ken Robinson, May Steele (UUP); David Hilditch, Jack McKee (DUP); Danny O'Connor (SDLP); Chrissy McAuley (Sinn Fein); Stewart Dickson, Sean Neeson (Alliance); James Barr McKissock (NLP); William Greer (PUP); Robert Lindsay Mason (ProAgreement); Tommy Kirkham (UDP); Roger Hutchinson (UKU); James Brown (Unionist)\n\nWestminster 1997 - UUP 39 per cent; Alliance 20 per cent; DUP 19 per cent; Conservative 7 per cent; PUP 5 per cent; SDLP 5 per cent; Independent 3 per cent; Sinn Fein 2 per cent; NLP 0.2 per cent."}, {"url": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/roy-beggs-peter-robinson-once-referred-to-me-as-a-loathsome-creature-i-think-that-said-a-lot-more-about-him-than-it-did-about-me/36250429.html", "page_content": "The most probing interviews: Roy Beggs Jr, East Antrim UUP MLA, on disagreeing with his MP father over the peace process... and a close encounter with an angry cow.\n\nQ. You're 55 and married to Sandra (\"we're of a similar age\"), a former retail manager who now works as a part-time secretary in your constituency office. You have three children - Stewart (26), a dentist; Matthew (24), a civil engineer; and Amy (23), a final year dentistry student. You've been married for 28 years. How did you two meet?\n\nA. Our eyes met on the dance floor at a Young Farmers dance five years before we got married. We went to London and then Malta on honeymoon.\n\nQ. Your father and namesake Roy (81) is a retired school vice-principal and former East Antrim MP, and your (\"slightly younger\") mum Wilma was an administrator before focusing on running the family farm outside Larne. You also have a brother Ian (57), a qualified engineer who works on the farm, and two sisters - Roma (56), a physiotherapist, and Lorraine (53), a dentist. What was growing up like?\n\nA. We'd a happy childhood and we made our own innocent fun. We made tunnels through the hayshed, explored the wild Glynn river valley and returned with sticks which we used to make improvised pole vaults and we filled bran bags full of straw as a landing area. It was fun. I smile when I think about it.\n\nQ. How much influence has your dad had on your career?\n\nA. We have a similar outlook on many issues, but not all. Occasionally I've compared notes with him but the best advice he gave me was to decide for myself because I will have to satisfy myself in the long-term with the decision made.\n\nQ. You're in the rather unusual position of having received death threats from both loyalists opposing the peace process and dissident republicans. Tell us about that.\n\nA. In 1999 we were told there was going to be a hit on one Ulster Unionist MLA one particular weekend, and I was among those approached by police officers acting on specific information. On the other occasion, in the early 2000s, the police had found a list with my name on it...\n\nQ. In 2003 you succeeded in having Irish rebel music removed from Aer Lingus's in-flight entertainment. Was it a tough battle?\n\nA. I was on a flight from Dublin to Boston - at that stage the DUP wouldn't have flown through Dublin - and was surprised to hear music advocating the IRA. I simply asked: \"Would Arabian Airlines be playing music advocating Osama Bin Laden?\" The issue was resolved quickly. It's important that we don't glorify terrorism and do everything we can to prevent young people being drawn into organised crime gangs here.\n\nQ. You're considered to be one of the more hardline members of the UUP. Did your father's suspension from the DUP in 1981 and subsequent defection to the UUP influence your party choice? Was there ever a time you though you might go to the DUP?\n\nA. No, I feel much more at home with the UUP. Their approach to unionism, of reasonable accommodation with our neighbours, is the best method of guaranteeing Northern Ireland's position within the UK, rather than the 'them and us' approach of others.\n\nQ. Do you believe in God? Do you have a strong faith?\n\nA. I do. I was recently appointed as an elder in Raloo Presbyterian Church in Larne. I've also served as a Boys' Brigade officer there for 20 years.\n\nQ. Have you ever lost anyone else close to you, and does death frighten you?\n\nA. Grandparents. As a family we all would have been very close. Death doesn't frighten me - if you're prepared to meet your maker, what's to fear?\n\nQ. You like watching sport, cycling and taking long country walks with your family, and relaxing with the odd glass of red wine. You also used to love playing rugby. How do you relax outside politics?\n\nA. I also help my dad on the farm by way of keeping fit. Before work this morning, for example, I put a lot of silage into a wheelbarrow and fed the cattle with it.\n\nQ. You often hear about the dangers of working with animals. Have you had any close encounters?\n\nA. I've had to jump a gate to get out of a pen after being chased by a cow that had just calved. I was trying to help the calf get onto its first feed when its mother went for me, but I escaped unscathed.\n\nA mother of a young calf is more dangerous than a bull, and statistics prove that.\n\nQ. Have you had any bad experiences with the media?\n\nA. Peter Robinson once called me a \"loathsome creature\" in the Press when I backed David Trimble. That was my first real experience in politics of someone being nasty, but it says a lot more about Peter Robinson than it does about me.\n\nQ. Tell us about the best day of your life so far.\n\nA. My wedding day - October 20, 1989 - when my beautiful wife finally turned up after making me wait a while.\n\nQ. And what about the worst day of your life? What's the most traumatic thing you've been through?\n\nA. The day my son Stewart, who was four, broke his leg in an accident with a link box on the farm. I had to meet him at A&E before he was transferred to hospital.\n\nI remember spending a few nights in a chair at the side of his bed.\n\nHe was very young to be in hospital. He had an operation to have his leg re-set but initially we didn't know how serious it was going to be.\n\nMy dad almost lost his leg when he was in his 20s.\n\nHe was climbing a wall when the top of it fell on him.\n\nSurgeons were recommending amputation at one stage.\n\nQ. Which politician from the so-called 'other side' do you most admire?\n\nA. The SDLP's Mark H Durkan, for his wit.\n\nQ. As the son of a Westminster politician, did you ever foresee a time when there would be no Ulster Unionist MPs? And will there be any in the future?\n\nA. I wouldn't have foreseen that. The current impasse might well result in new political arrangements being made. I suspect the most damaging change has been the St Andrews Agreement, which has created the race to vote for one extreme or the other, which in turn has polarised political representation. Despite RHI and Nama, people believe they have to vote DUP to stop Sinn Fein getting in.\n\nQ. How do you feel about the current stalemate?\n\nA. I'm very frustrated, particularly when receiving complaints from constituents having to wait unreasonably long for health service treatment. There's a wide range of decisions that aren't being made, and we can't continue without ministers in post. There will either have to be devolved ministers appointed, or authority passed to direct rule.\n\nQ. Do you think being an MLA is easy money these days?\n\nA. We aren't doing the full job that we're elected to do and it's time for change.\n\nQ. What's the most important piece of advice you've been given?\n\nA. Decide for yourself, because you-have to live with the long-term consequences of your actions and decisions.\n\nDad gave that to me at a critical time in the peace process. He and I ended up taking different views on a vote prior to going into government in 1999. He had a more hardline approach than me. I ultimately decided to support Trimble in the establishment of the first Executive when IRA decommissioning hadn't yet taken place. We didn't fall out. I did so to apply pressure on Sinn Fein so they couldn't blame unionism for any collapse of the Assembly at that time.\n\nQ. If you were in trouble, who is the one person you would turn to?\n\nA. Probably my dad - and my wife.\n\nQ. Who was your biggest inspiration growing up?\n\nA. My dad. He was a strict disciplinarian; he was the enforcer at Larne High School. He worked hard and looked after us, and he was always very good in company. He knew a lot of people. He and mum are also fantastic dancers.\n\nQ. Who is your best Catholic friend?\n\nA. I was always taught to treat people as you find them. At school I played with a mixed group at lunchtime and on the school teams, as was the case when I played for the Firsts at Larne Rugby Club. We all worked together for whatever team we played on.\n\nQ. What's your favourite place?\n\nA. Castlerock. I had a wee touring caravan and most summers our family usually went there or Benone.\n\nQ. What is your greatest achievement to date?\n\nA. I developed a children and young people's group in Carrickfergus which ultimately was successful in establishing a Sure Start, helping mums and young children in parts of Carrickfergus and Larne.\n\nQ. Have you ever had a nickname?\n\nA. Beggsy\n\nQ. What's the craziest thing you've ever done?\n\nA. When I was 19 a group of us elected to go waterskiing in Newferry in December - which I did without a suitable wetsuit. I remember going for a run afterwards to get warmed up and then subsequently discovering I'd been running with a thorn in my heel, but because it was so cold I couldn't feel it.\n\nQ. You and Sandra live in Glenoe while Stewart works in London, Matthew is \"drilling tunnels under cities in Canada\" and Amy is currently studying in Dundee. You must miss them?\n\nA. I do. I hope they all come back at some point but they're adults and have to decide things for themselves. But it took a while getting used to all three being away.\n\nQ. You went to Glynn Primary and Larne Grammar before spending a year out on company placement and then heading to Queen's to study engineering. Briefly tell us about your career to date.\n\nA. Immediately prior to becoming an MLA I worked as a production manager for five years at (the now closed) Simms and Young.\n\nBefore that I worked for different manufacturing companies in production management.\n\nQ. You became involved in politics at university, joined the Young Unionists and served as secretary of the Ulster Young Unionist Council (UYUC). You were also constituency secretary at your local UUP branch. Was your dad a major influence in your decision to enter politics?\n\nA. There was always some politics discussed over the kitchen table, although I was the only family member actively involved - I helped my dad put up posters at election time.\n\nAt university I took part in the Young Unionist protest march against the Anglo-Irish Agreement from Londonderry to Belfast.\n\nI never made any political ambitions for myself but I originally thought at some point that I might become a councillor.\n\nQ. If the Assembly collapses, what's next for you?\n\nA. More time farming and I'll look for an engineering management role."}, {"url": "https://www.roybeggs.co.uk/uups-wouldnt-block-same-sex-marriage/", "page_content": "Image copyright\n\nPacemaker Image caption\n\n\n\nDoug Beattie speaks on LGBT issues during the traditional Pride Talks Back event\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ulster Unionist Doug Beattie has said he does not think any of his party\u2019s MLAs would sign a petition of concern to block same-sex marriage at Stormont in the future.\n\nThe MLA was speaking during a Belfast Pride debate on Monday night.\n\nMr Beattie said while the UUP allows a conscience vote on the issue, he does not believe it should help veto it.\n\nNorthern Ireland is the only part of the UK where same-sex marriage is illegal.\n\nIn 2015, a narrow majority of MLAs at Stormont voted in favour of changing the law, but a cross-community veto mechanism known as the petition of concern deployed by the DUP meant the change was effectively blocked.\n\nA valid petition of concern requires the signatures of at least 30 MLAs.\n\nThe DUP no longer has the number of MLAs needed to secure such a petition on its own and would need the backing of two MLAs from other parties.\n\nIt is likely that the Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister would give his support to it.\n\nWhat is a petition of concern?\n\nThe measure was designed as a way to safeguard minority rights in Northern Ireland\u2019s power-sharing assembly.\n\nIf a petition of concern is presented to the assembly speaker, any motion or amendment will need cross-community support.\n\nIn such cases, a vote on proposed legislation will only pass if supported by a weighted majority (60%) of members voting, including at least 40% of each of the nationalist and unionist designations present and voting.\n\nEffectively this means that, provided enough MLAs from a particular community agree, that community can exercise a veto over the assembly\u2019s decisions.\n\nThere has also been speculation that the Ulster Unionist Roy Beggs, who is opposed to same-sex marriage, might sign a petition of concern, which his party colleague Doug Beattie openly talked about during the Belfast Pride event.\n\nMr Beattie said the UUP was on a \u201cjourney\u201d and that being a unionist did not mean being anti-LGBTQ, and that he personally supports same-sex marriage.\n\nHe also said the party\u2019s 10 MLAs had recently taken part in a training session around awareness of LGBT issues.\n\n\u201cTo see us having that training session \u2013 and Roy Beggs in there fully engaged,\u201d he said.\n\nImage copyright\n\nPacemaker Image caption\n\n\n\nMary Lou McDonald (Sinn F\u00e9in), Billy Hutchinson (PUP), John Blair (Alliance), Stephen Agnew (Green Party) , Claire Hanna (SDLP) and Doug Beattie (UUP) take question on LGBT issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe wants to move this forward, the same as everybody else.\n\n\u201cIt is a conscience issue for us, but that\u2019s not good enough. The reality is I have one vote and that one vote counts, and Roy Beggs has one vote and that vote counts.\n\n\u201cThe other eight MLAs have one vote and that one vote counts, and anyone who signs a petition of concern negates my vote.\u201d\n\nMr Beattie said it was his own personal view that none of his Stormont colleagues would sign a petition of concern to block same-sex marriage.\n\n\u2018Matter of conscience\u2019\n\n\u201cRoy is a really decent man, he is a democrat. Do I think he will sign a petition of concern? No, I do not.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not to say he won\u2019t, but I\u2019m saying the person I know will not sign a petition of concern and neither would anybody else of the MLAs in the Ulster Unionist Party \u2013 but we will vote with our conscience.\u201d\n\nAn Ulster Unionist spokesperson said: \u201cMembers of the Ulster Unionist Party are offered a free vote on the issue of same sex marriage, it is a matter of conscience and will remain so.\n\n\u201cAs a party we have been clear that before devolution is restored, the petition of concern must be reformed to prevent the type of abuse that was witnessed in previous assemblies.\u201d"}]}
