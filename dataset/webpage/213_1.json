He was born in Riga, Latvia, on 24 July 1794. Pander, with an eclectic history of research, is best remembered for his discovery and explanation of the structure of the chick blastoderm, a term he coined. In doing so, Pander was able to achieve the goal set forth by his teacher, Ignaz D\u00f6llinger, to reinvigorate the study of the chick embryo as a means of further exploring the science of embryology as a whole. His findings paved the way for the work of Karl Ernst von Baer, who would later revolutionize the field of embryology with his research.\n\nPander initially studied in the local schools of his hometown, Riga, and eventually enrolled in the University of Dorpat in 1812. While studying there, Pander attempted to pursue an education in both medical science as well as natural history. It was during this time that Pander began to work with an anatomist named Karl Friedrich Burdach who had previously taught Karl Ernst von Baer. Pander left Dorpat in 1814 and traveled to Germany. It was there in 1816 that Pander met von Baer, who convinced him to study at the University of W\u00fcrzburg under the tutelage of Ignaz D\u00f6llinger. Pander agreed and traveled to W\u00fcrzburg where he received his MD in 1817. It was also here that he published his dissertation, Historia Metamorphoseos Quam Ovum Incubatum Prioribus Quinque Diebus Subit, a study of the components of the chick embryo including detailed illustrations by Eduard Joseph d\u2019Alton.\n\nDuring his work at the University of W\u00fcrzburg, Pander discovered the blastoderm of the chick embryo. The blastoderm is the outermost cellular layer of the embryo, which Pander believed contributed greatly to embryonic development. He studied the blastoderm\u2019s role in early embryonic development, describing the outer, middle, and inner layers in detail while only being able to conclude that the development of blood vessels occurred in the middle layer and that important events of embryonic development followed thereafter. Despite the lack of in-depth conclusions, Pander\u2019s discovery and recognition of the blastoderm as well as the layered structure of the embryo provided invaluable information and guidance to his colleagues as well as future embryologists, including von Baer.\n\nDespite promising early research, Pander did not pursue further work in the study of chick embryos or embryology in general. After he obtained his MD and published his dissertation, Pander began traveling through Europe visiting science museums and continuing his work of observation in the fields of biology, paleontology, and geology. His primary goal in doing so was to visit and study the newest and most intricate fossils and skeletons discovered in different parts of the world. Pander eventually began to publish a series of works on osteology, the study of bones, collaborating once again with E. J. d\u2019Alton. Pander became a member of the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg in 1821 and a member of the St. Petersburg Zoological Academy in 1826. For the remainder of his life, Pander lived mainly in his estate near his hometown of Riga while still taking time to travel and continue his work in the fields of geology and paleontology, though none of his later work gained significant recognition. Pander died on 22 September 1865 in St. Petersburg. Though somewhat inconclusive, Pander\u2019s work with chick embryos and their components marked the beginning of a more advanced understanding of embryology."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/pander-christian-heinrich", "page_content": "PANDER, CHRISTIAN HEINRICH\n\n(b. Riga, Latvia, Russia, 24 July 1794; d. St. Petersburg, Russia, 22 September 1865)\n\nembryology, anatomy, paleontology.\n\nPander was the son of a wealthy banker of German descent. After studying in the local schools of Riga, he entered the University of Dorpat in 1812. Dorpat had been refounded in 1798, and its faculty was German trained. Prior to this the Baltic gentry had traditionally sent their sons to German universities. Although his father had wanted him to study medicine, Pander was more interested in natural history, but he attempted to combine the two. At Dorpat he came under the influence of the anatomist Karl Friedrich Burdach, who had also taught Karl Ernst von Baer; Baer later continued Pander\u2019s embryologic researches.\n\nIn 1814 Pander left Dorpat for Berlin and from there he went on to G\u00f6ttingen. In March 1816, at a congress of Baltic students resident in Germany, he renewed his acquaintance with Baer, who persuaded him to come to the University of W\u00fcrzburg and study under Ignaz D\u00f6llinger. In his autobiography Baer states that he, Pander, and D\u00f6llinger had discussed D\u00f6llinger\u2019s hope that someone would study anew the development of the chick embryo. Pander took on the task and he received his M.D. at W\u00fcrzburg in 1817. His dissertation, \u201cHistoria metamorphoseos quam ovum incubatum prioribus quinque diebus subit,\u201d was amplified and then published in German (1817) with illustrations by the elder E. J. d\u2019Alton.\n\nPander discovered the trilaminar structure of the chick blastoderm, a term he also coined. He stated that he used the term blastoderm, from the Greek blastos, germ, and derma, skin, because the embryo chose it as \u201cits seat and its domicile, contributing much to its configuration out of its own substance, therefore in the future we shall call it blastoderm.\u201c He described the three layers as the serous or outer, the vascular or middle, and the mucous or inner. In the twelfth hour of embryonic development he reported that the blastoderm consisted of two entirely separate layers: an inner layer, thick and opaque; and an outer layer thin, smooth, and transparent. Between these two a third layer developed, in which blood vessels formed and from which \u201cevents of the greatest importance subsequently occur.\u201d When Baer receieved a copy of Pander\u2019s work in 1818 at Konigsberg University, where he was serving as prosector to his old Dorpat professor, Burdach, he began his own investigations, which ultimately revolutionized embryology. Baer\u2019s first treatise on the subject includes an introduction styled as a personal letter to Pander, explaining his differences with his old friend.\n\nPander, for reasons that are not entirely clear, never pursued his early research, although he regarded his studies as incomplete and had expressed himself only briefly on the subsequent transformations that took place in the embryo. After receiving his degree, Pander traveled in a leisurely manner through Germany, France, Spain, Holland, and England with d\u2019Alton as a companion, visiting anatomical museums and making various paleontological, geological, and biological observations. In 1821 he began publishing a series of papers on comparative osteology with illustrations by d\u2019Alton. In these osteological studies Pander developed an evolutionary theory of the development of animal forms which had strong Lamarckian overtones. Goethe endorsed his transformist ideas, and Darwin was aware of them through secondary sources.\n\nIn 1821 he became a member of the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg. He also traveled extensively in Russia at this time and wrote an account of the natural history of Bukhara in central Asia. In 1826 he became a fellow of the Zoological Academy in St. Petersburg, but in 1827 he returned to his estate near Riga, where he remained until 1842. In that year he returned to St. Petersburg as a member of the Mining Institute. He then resumed his travels in Russia, observing geological characteristics and gathering paleontological materials. Although he wrote almost exclusively on geological matters, he began a zoological collection and surveyed geological formations around St. Petersburg. Little of his later work has received the attention paid his earlier studies.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nI. Original Works.

A native of Riga of German descent, Pander studied at the University of Wrzburg under the great biologist and teacher Ignaz Dllinger, who had expressed the hope that one of his students would investigate the development of the chick embryo. Pander took up the task for his doctoral thesis. Building upon the work of Malpighi and Caspar Friedrich Wolff, Pander's thesis methodically describes the different layers from which the various organs of the chicken embryo emerge. He discovered the three-layered structure of the blastoderm, a term he coined. \"In the twelfth hour of embryonic development he reported that the blastoderm consisted of two entirely separate layers: an inner layer, thick and opaque; and an outer layer, thin, smooth, and transparent.

Pander sent a copy of his thesis to his friend and colleague Karl von Baer (see lot 912), who immediately began his own investigations of the subject, leading to his identification of the mammalian ovum. Together the work of the two biologists revolutionized embryology and lay the foundation for \"a new branch of comparative morphology, which... made possible a far more universal and extensive study of the organs in living creatures than had been conceivable before, embracing not only [their] present characteristics... but also their evolutionary history\" (Nordenskild, The History of Biology: a Survey, New York, 1928, pp. 368-369).

He developed the revolutionary cotyledon model as a basic model in embryology, dealt with \"Evolution\" and interpreted for the first time the enigmatic conodonts properly.\n\nGeneral, origin, years of study\n\nThe day that is little known Pander among the most innovative scientists of the early 19th century. He formulated a still valid today embryology model, already held in the 20s of the 19th century unrestricted Artwandel for given and put fundamental work to pal\u00e4ozischen fish and fish tanks before.\n\nPander came from a German merchant family in Riga. His father was the banker Johann Martin Pander (1765-1842), his grandfather a well-known merchant. Pander attended the German School in Riga and studied medicine at the German 1812-1814 Tartu University, where he heard the anatomist and physiologist Karl Friedrich Burdach and friend of Karl Ernst von Baer. He received his PhD after studying in G\u00f6ttingen and Berlin in 1817 at the University of W\u00fcrzburg with Ignaz Dollinger.\n\nEmbryology\n\nThrough his dissertation of 1817 Pander founded the cotyledon concept, which is still used today in embryology. This model describes the embryogenesis as development of three germ layers, the ecto-, meso-and endoderm ( Pander still serous leaf, vascular leaf and mucus sheet called ). For this purpose he had in common with angebr\u00fctet Dollinger and the significant draftsman and anatomist Eduard Joseph d' Alton 2000 chicken eggs in an incubator, systematically opened and described in defined time intervals. Pander's thesis lies in two very different versions of it: the Latin describes the development of the whole organism in the first 5 or 7 days ( Dissertatio inauguralis ), the German parallel development of individual organs or organ systems ( Contributions to the history of development of the chick in the Eye ). The Latin version has no illustrations, which contains the German and artistically significant engravings d' Alton.\n\nWith the evidence of development of cotyledons Pander achieved the decisive for the embryological research scientific breakthrough: embryonic development was neither unfolding of what already exists ( preformation ), still forming from unformed ( epigenesis ), but the development of ever more diverse membranes (ie, metamorphosis, a conscious of Goethe borrowed term ). Pander cotyledon model was further expanded and applied to other groups of animals, including humans by Baer in his important monograph embryological Over evolutionary history of animals ( 2 vols K\u00f6nigsberg 1828/1837 ). The book was dedicated to the \" childhood friends Pander \".\n\nComparative Anatomy\n\nTogether with d' Alton took Pander 1818 a study tour to Southern and Western Europe (Spain, Portugal, Netherlands, UK, France ). Here collections and museums, extinct South American giant sloth ( Megatherium ) were visited, including Madrid newly reconstructed and studied the comparative anatomy of invertebrates ( Cephalopden ) to the seashores. Purpose of the trip was to explore the comparative anatomy (especially mammals and birds), a work that culminated in the osteology 14b\u00e4ndigen comparative. In addition to the meticulous description of the theoretical passages of interest, where on the unlimited variability of species (caused by changes in food habits, climate change, etc. ) Pander and D' Alton reflect. For the reconstruction of the behavior of extinct animals they came forth their extant nearest relatives. To distinguish which passages here of pander, which originate from d' Alton today, is no longer safe to do. Individual volumes of comparative osteology, was praised reviewed by Goethe, who was a personal friend of d' Alton. Charles Darwin also mentioned the 1st volume of the work as a \"precursor \" in his Origin of Species.\n\n1820 took Pander together with Georg von Meyendorff and Eduard Friedrich Eversmann in an expedition from Orenburg to Central Asia ( Bukhara) part. In 1825 he married Amalie Wilhelmine von Scherer ( 1805-1861? ), In 1826 he became a member of the Petersburg Academy of Sciences.\n\nLater years: Paleontology and Geology\n\nBetween 1827 and 1842 explored Pander of his estate in Carnikava ( Koivemunde ) of the fossils in the shore sediments of the Gauja ( Livonian Aa)\n\n1856 described Pander which is important for the stratigraphy as index fossil group of fossil conodonts first time scientifically. The nature of these enigmatic fossils, which were interpreted as \" worms \", a long time was controversial and could be resolved only in the 80s of the 20th century: these are as described by Pander to \"teeth\" (pine structures) of \" fishing\" ( chordates ). The British Pander Society, which systematically deals with conodonts, called after the discoverer and describer, it awards the Medal Pander, its members call themselves ironically as \"the Panderers \".\n\n1857 Pander was the Demidov Prize (Russian \u0414\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u044f ) awarded, one of the most important and oldest Russian scientific awards.\n\nDeath, afterlife, meaning\n\nPander since the early 1820s had been suffering from a serious, \" feverish \" not known disease, possibly malaria. He died in September 1865 in St. Petersburg.\n\nThrough his first description of the conodonts, but above all he has his cotyledon concept an outstanding importance of his century. To him also remember some scientific eponyms: the Upper Devonian coelacanth genus Panderichthys ( a transitional form between fish and terrestrial vertebrates ), the genus Panderia ( Goosefoot family, Chenopodiaceae ), the brachiopods Panderina and Panderschen organs in trilobites.\n\nPublications\n\nEmbryological work\n\nDissertatio inauguralis sistens historiam metamorphoseos quam ovum incubatum prioribus quinque Diebus subit.

In 1820 he took part in a scientific expedition to Bokhara as a naturalist. His work in embryology was continued by Karl Ernst von Baer (1792-1876), who expanded Pander\"s concept of germ layers to include all vertebrates. Pander performed important studies in the field of paleontology, being known for his extensive research on fossils found in the Devonian and Silurian geological strata of the Baltic regions. His study of trilobites from this age led to the adjective \"Panderian\", first used by the Canadian palaeontologist, Elkanah Billings. Pander is credited as the first scientist to describe primitive creatures known as conodonts. Today the Pander Society is an international association of palaeontologists and stratigraphers with a common interest in the study of conodonts. He died in Saint St. Petersburg. Pander\"s eponyms are: Pander\"s islands or blood islands."}]}
