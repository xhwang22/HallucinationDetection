As a small boy he received tuition at Windsor from F. Bell, of Cambridge, but it cannot be said that he ever showed much aptitude for the game. He played occasionally during his Oxford days, however, and, while he was staying at Madingley Hall, a special wicket was reserved for his use at Fenner's. He showed his interest in the game in many ways. When funds were being collected to pay off the pavilion debt at Fenner's, he contributed ten pounds at the same time promising to make up any amount required at the end of the term, and during one of the critical moments in the history of the M.C.C. was the largest contributor to the fund raised to pay for the freehold of Lord's. Furthermore, as Duke of Cornwal lhis late Majesty was for many years landlord of the Oval, and in several ways he showed his interest in the Surrey County C.C. His Majesty was born at Buckingham Palace on November 9th, 1841, and was therefore in his sixty-ninth year at the time of his death.\n\nFREDERICK CLARENCE ALMOND was born at Great Bentley, in Essex, on October 7th, 1855, and died at Enfield on May 3rd. He was above the average as a batsman, was a useful slow bowler, and in the field generally stood point or mid-off. His first match for Essex was in 1883, and three years later he headed the county's averages with 27.25 for eight innings commenced, his highest score being 84 not out v. Derbyshire, at Leyton. In 1883 and 1884 he was engaged by Enfield, but in the following season went as coach to Elstree School, where he remained for several years.\n\nTHE REV. WILLIAM WHEELER ARCHER, for twenty-three years President of the Hampton Wick C.C., died on November 22nd at his Vicarage, in his sixty-sixth year.\n\nMR. RICHARD N. ASTERLEY, for several years a well-known cricketer in the New York district, died at Bensonhurst, N.Y., on September 28th. He was born at Llanmyneck, Montgomeryshire October 29th, 1867, and was educated at Oswestry Grammar School.\n\nMR. EDWARD BANKS, J.P., one of the oldest Kent cricketers died at Sholden Lodge, near Deal, on January 12th, aged 89. He was born in South Wales on August 12th, 1820, but moved into Kent before completing his second year. Ill-health limited his appearances in county cricket to ten matches between 1842 and 1846. In the last-mentioned year he appeared for the Gentlemen against the Players at Canterbury, and fielded at Lord's for Alfred Mynn in the first of his single wicket matches with Felix. Scores and Biographies (iii--159) says of him, \" Batted in a good free style, and was a most excellent field.\" Fuller Pilch recalled that \" I found him down Sandwich way, where his property lay. He and his youngest brother, Mr. William, were the quickest between the wickets I ever did see, and Mr. Edward was one of the smartest in the long-field. He was like a thorough-bred horse, for no matter how far the ball was off he would try ; and when I sang out ' Go to her, Mr. Edward ! Go to her ! ' he would outrun himself almost, and, as sure as ever he got his hands to her, the ball was like a rat in a trap.\" His younger brother, the late Mr. W. J. Banks, played occasionally for Kent in 1846 and 1848. The deceased, who was a grandson of Sir Edward Banks, the builder of London Bridge, rode a tricycle as recently as three months before his death.\n\nMR. CHARLES BARCLAY, J.P., of the Harrow eleven of 1856 and 1857, was born on October 2nd, 1837, and died at the Manor House, Bayford, Herts, on January 2nd. He was a steady batsman with sound defence, and was the wicket-keeper of the side. Eton were not met in 1856, and in the match of 1857 he made only 2 and 9 not out. In the latter year Harrow played thirteen matches, winning nine, losing one (by 12 runs), and drawing three, and Mr. Barclay stumped thirteen men and caught eleven. Proceeding to Cambridge, he played occasionally for the University in 1859 and 1860, but did not obtain his Blue. His father, Mr. R. Barclay, was a member of the Harrow Eleven of 1825.\n\nMR. CHARLES MYLNE BARKER, for four years in the Westminster Eleven, commencing in 1859, died in London on February 17th, aged 67. He was described as, 'a very severe hitter but rather too wild at times : a capital field at long leg or long-field.\"\n\nTHE VEN. ARCHDEACON FREDERICK BATHURST, who was born on March 7th, 1827, died at Kensington on September 22nd. He played for Winchester in 1845, and opened the innings against both Eton and Harrow: former match resulted in the famous tie, and the latter was won by Winchester by 12 runs. In his four innings he scored 60 runs, thus averaging 15. Three years later he was a member of the Oxford team which beat Cambridge by 23 runs, his own scores being 13 and seven. He was cox of his college boat, and a first-rate chess player. Sir Frederick Bathurst, the famous bowler, was his cousin.\n\nSIR LYTTELTON HOLYOAKE BAYLEY, K.B., late Judge of H.M's High Court of Judicature, Bombay, died at The Lodge, Parkstone, Dorset, on August 4th. He was born in London on May 6th, 1827 and had therefore completed his eighty-third year at the time of his death. For four years, commencing in 1841, he was in the Eton Eleven, being captain in 1844. He possessed very sound defence and fielded well at long-stop, middle-wicket, and long-leg. He was one of the oldest members of the M.C.C., having joined the Club in 1847. In the eight Public School matches in which he appeared he made 107 runs in fourteen innings, averaging 7.64, his highest score being 28 against Winchester in 1844. In a match of note his largest innings was 59 for the Hon. R. Grimston's XI. v. the Hon. F. Grimston' XI, at Lord's in 1846. His father was President of the M.C.C in 1844, and his elder brother, now Sir Emilius Bayley Laurie, earned fame as a cricketer nearly seventy years ago by an innings of 152 in the Eton v. Harrow match of 1841.\n\nCANON WILLIAM BENHAM, though never much of a cricketer, was very fond of the game. He was born at Westmeon, Hants, on January 15th, 1831, and died at St. Edmund's Rectory, Finsbury Square, on July 30th. As a small boy he met John Nyren, who published his Young Cricketer's Tutor in 1833 and died four years later. He could also recall seeing Talleyrand, who died over seventy years ago, walking down Piccadilly.\n\nMR. SCHOLES BIRCH, for many years a well-known Manchester player, and member of the Free Foresters, died at Chestnut on April 13th, aged 83. He was a good batsmen, and obtained many wickets with his slow underhand bowling. His father, Mr. Lea Birch taught John Roberts, sen., the spot-stroke, and was for many years the best batsman and bowler in the Manchester C.C.\n\nMR. FRANCIS HORNBY BIRLEY, J.P., of the Winchester XI's of 1867 and 1868, died at Lingfield, Surrey, on August 1st, aged 60. He was born on March 14th, 1850. In 1868 it was said of him, 'Possesses excellent judgment as captain : a clever slow bowler, and an excellent field anywhere: hits freely, and, though unfortunate at first, scored largely at the end of the season.'In his two matches against Eton he scored only 14 runs in four innings, but took 13 wickets. Proceeding to Oxford, he appeared in the Freshman's match of 1869, but did not obtain his Blue. He played for Lancashire three times in 1870 and once in 1872, and in 1879 appeared for Surrey against Middlesex at the Oval. Mr. Birley was famous at Association Football in the early days of the game, playing for the Wanderers.\n\nMR. BENJAMIN CHARLES BOLTON, who played for Yorkshire in half-a-dozen matches in 1890 and 1891, died on November 18th, from injuries sustained in falling from an express train a few miles from Hull. On his first appearance for the county--against Warwickshire at Halifax--he took ten wickets for 64 runs, and in the six matches mentioned obtained twenty-seven for a fraction under fifteen runs each. He was born on September 23rd, 1862, and was fast medium bowler.\n\nLIEUT-COL. BERNARD TINDAL BOSANQUET, D.L, died at Cowley, Uxbridge, on August 5th, at the age of 67. He was the father of Messers. B. J. T. and N. E. T. Bosanquet, and in his younger days was a useful club cricketer. It has been said of him :--\" The father bowled exactly in the same way as the son (B.J.T.,) at whom he used to bowl from the time that he was six years old.\"\n\nMR. WILLIAM BOWIE, a well-known Scottish cricketer, died on September 2nd, aged 48. For many years he was one of the best bowlers of the Kelburne C.C., of which he was one of the oldest members. He was ex-President of the Western District Cricket Union and Western Representative on the Scottish Cricket Union.\n\nGEORGE BRITTON, who was born at Hunslet on April 7th, 1843, died suddenly in Leeds on January 3rd. At one time he was a very familiar figure in Yorkshire cricket, but he appeared for the county only once--against Cambridgeshire at Wisbech in 1867, when he was dismissed for 0 and 3. Scores and Biographies (vii--91) says that he was \" a good average batsman \" and that he \" fielded generally mid-wicket off or on.\" He performed a notable feat in 1870, when playing for XXII of Hull v. the A.E.E., he carried his bat through the innings of 70 for 30.\n\nJOHN BROWN, who was born at Rugby on December 25th, 1831, died at Walsall in the second week of November. He was a round-armed medium-paced bowler and a useful bat, and for thirty years was Captain of the Walsall C.C. He played for Staffordshire, and occasionally for eighteens and twenty-twos against the All England and United Elevens.\n\nMR. FREDERICK GEORGE BULL, the EsSex slow bowler of a few years ago, was found drowned at St. Anne's-on-Sea, Lancashire, on September 16th. He was born in Essex on April 2nd, 1876, played his first match for the county in 1895 and came to the front in the following year, when in all first-class matches he obtained eighty-five wickets for 16 runs each. It was in 1896, when twenty years of age, that he was chosen, strictly on his merits, for the Gentlemen v. Players match at the Oval in which he took eight wickets for 94 runs in the first innings and two for 59 in the second.\n\nThe same season he had an analysis of eight for 44 for Essex against Yorkshire at Bradford. In 1897 he took 120 wickets for something over twenty- one runs each, his best performances (all for Essex) being nine for 73 v. Surrey at the Oval, thirteen for 156 v. Derbyshire at Leyton and fourteen for 176 v. Lancashire on the same ground. It was in the last-mentioned match that he endeavoured to prevent Lancashire from following-on by bowling wide-balls to the boundary. Mold however, grasping the situation, knocked his wicket down so enabling his side to go in again, but Essex won by six wickets. Bull was chosen for the Gentlemen at Lord's that year,but was expensive, and although he secured eight of the Players'wickets at Scarborough later in the season they were taken at rather a heavy price- a fraction under twenty-five runs each. In the autumn of 1897 he visited America with Mr. P. F. Warner's team and obtained forty-three wickets--the largest number taken by any member of the side--at a cost of 13.86 runs apiece. In 1898 he was successful in crediting himself with over a hundred wickets, but in the following year he proved less effective and in 1900 was so expensive that he was dropped from the side.\n\nDuring most of the time that he was a member of the Essex team he filled the position of Assistant Secretary to the County Club. Upon leaving the South of England to take up a commercial appointment in Blackburn he commenced--in 1904--to play for East Lancashire, for which club he took ninety-one wickets that season for 12.54 runs each. Subsequently he embraced professionalism and was engaged for two seasons by Perthshire, and afterwards for the same period by East Lancashire and Rishton. Bull could make the ball break both ways and he always kept a good length and used his head well.\n\nMR. GEORGE JOHN COURTHORFE, J.P., D.L., of the Eton Eleven of 1867, died suddenly of heart failure at Whiligh, Ticehurst, Sussex, on September 9th, at the age of 62. He did not play in match with Harrow, but appeared against Winchester, taking two wickets and scoring 13. He proceeded to Oxford, but did not obtain a Blue. In 1872 he became a member of the M.C.C.\n\nMR. JOHN CRAIG, one of the best cricketers in Scotland about thirty years ago, died on April 7th, en route for South Africa, aged about 60. He was a right-handed bowler, but batted left,and he and his brother Robert were always referred to by cricketers as the 'Dalkeith Craigs.' For Gentlemen of Scotland against the Australian team of 1880 he took six wickets, including those of Murdoch, McDonnell, Palmer and A. H. Jarvis, for 60 runs.\n\nDR. WILLIAM GRAFTON CURGENVEN, M.D., who was born at plymouth on November 30th, 1841, died at Fareham, in Hampshire, on March 18th. His early cricket was played in Devonshire, and it was for the Gentlemen of Devon that he made his first appearance at Lord's--against M.C.C., in June, 1864. Removing later to Derby, he served for many years on the Committee of the County Club, and, except in 1877, played every year for Derbyshire from 1872 until 1878 inclusive. He was described as \" A brilliant bat, hitting well all round, and on a lively wicket a fast run-getter; a good field at long leg and cover-point.\" In 1873 he scored 39 of a total of 70 against Lancashire at Manchester, and in the following year made 34 and 74 in the match with Yorkshire on the Derby ground, while in 1875 he obtained 71 against Kent, also at Derby. Two of his sons have played for Derbyshire during recent years.\n\nMR. GEORGE WILLIAM DAVIES, of Kingswingford, who died on March 23rd, in his sixty-fifth year, appeared occasionally for the Gentlemen of Worcestershire.\n\nFREDERICK DELBRIDGE, a well-known figure in South Devon cricket and for three years professional to the Torquay C.C., died by his own hand at Upton, Torquay, on November 11th. He was only 31 years of age.\n\nHARRY DEWSE, who was born at York on February 23rd, 1836, died at his native place on July 8th. He was a very useful all-round cricketer, with wicket-keeping as his forte. For Tynemouth v. Chester-le-street, he took all ten wicket in an innings, and in 1875 bowed 33 balls for nine runs and five wickets. For fourteen years he played occasionally against the All England Eleven and (during his residence in Newcastle) for Northumberland.\n\nMR. SAMUEL DRIVER, captain of the Nelson C.C., of Lancashire, died on March 21st in his fiftieth year. He played for Nelson and Keighley for many seasons and scored over ten thousand runs during his career.\n\nMR. HUBERT EATON, J.P., died at Ketton Grange, Stamford, on March 25th, aged 46. He was educated at the Oratory School, Birmingham and Trinity College (Cambridge), and was in each eleven. In later years he was most prominently identified with the Burghley Park C.C., of which he was captain. He was a stylish batsman, and played for M.C.C., I Zingari, the Quidnuncs, and Free Foresters. He was born in January, 1864.\n\nSIR FLEETWOOD ISHAM EDWARD'S, G.C.M.G., K.C.B., I.S.O, who was born at Harrow on April 21st, 1842, died at the Manor House, Lindfield, Sussex, on August 14th. He had been a member of the M.C.C. since 1870, and was educated at Harrow, where he just failed to get into the Eleven. In his time he made some scores for the Royal Engineers, and in 1865 began to play for Gentlemen of Kent.\n\nMr. FREDERICK LYNDON EVELYN, J.P., the old Rugby and Oxford cricketer, was born at Presteign, Radnorshire, on May 24th 1859, and died there on December 8th. He was in the Rugby eleven, from 1876 to 1878, being captain in his last year, when illness interfered greatly with his cricket. In his two matches with Marlborough he scored only 25 runs in four innings and on each occasion he was on the losing side. Among his contemporaries were E. T. Hirst, C. F. H. Leslie, and F. D. Gaddum. He obtained his Blue for Oxford in 1880, but made only 0 and 1 against Cambridge, who won by 115 runs. Scores and Biographies described him as \"a good average batsman, and in the field generally cover-point or long-field.\" He played for Herefordshire from 1879 to 1891.\n\nCANON ARTHUR HENRY FABER, of the Winchester XI. of 1847 and 1848, was born in India on February 29th, 1832, and died at Doncaster, on November 29th. In his four Public School matches he scored 54 runs in eight innings, took ten wickets, and on every occasion was on the beaten side. He did not obtain his Blue at Oxford, although he was a far better batsman than his scores against Eton and Harrow would lead one to suppose. In July, 1862, he played an innings of 100 at Lord's for Gentlemen of the North v. Gentlemen of the South, and a fortnight later, at Leamington, he made 79 for Sixteen Free Foresters v. The All England Eleven, who had Wootton, Jackson, Tinley, and Tarrant to bowl for them. Scores and Biographies described Canon Faber as \" A most excellent batsman,\" and added that he played frequently under the name of St. Fabian.\n\nMR. FELIX FIELDING, who played for Surrey in seven matches between 1889 and 1891, died at Surbiton on February 4th. He was born on February 24th, 1858, and was educated at Malvern, where he was in the Eleven in 1875. Later he became prominent in connection with the Incogniti, M.C.C., and Richmond C.C., and for some years was captain of the Surbiton C.C. In his second match Surrey--against Oxford University at the Oval, in 1889--he scored 75, and with Abel (138) added 183 runs for the second wicket: the county made 614, and won by an innings and 367 runs. He was well above the average as a wicket-keeper, and in 1889 took part in the North v. South match at Manchester. As a batsman he possessed strong defence, but it was his skill behind the wicket which obtained him a place in first-class cricket.\n\nMr. W. W. FOULKROD, who died at Eddington, Philadelphia, on November 13th, was born at Frankford, Pa., on November 22nd, 1846. He was one .of the founders, and at one time President, of the Frankford County C.C. His son, MR. W. W. Foulkrod, jun., has acted as captain of the team for several years and at the present time is one of the most useful all-round cricketers in Philadelphia.\n\nMR. ARTHUR EDWARD FURNISS was born at Sheffield on May 9th, 1833, and died there on July 13th. He never played for his county, but Scores and Biographies described him as \" a good steady bat, and in the field generally point.\" He appeared occasionally against the All England Eleven and in other important matches in his district, and in 1859 made 50 not out for XVIII of Sheffield v. An England Eleven, who had Bickley, Reynolds, Hayward, Griffith, and Wells to bowl for them.\n\nMR. JAMES GARDNER, of Saxon Hall, near Newmarket, died on March 1st in his sixty-first year. A steady batsman and a useful slow bowler, he played occasionally for Suffolk and Leicestershire. Several times eleven members of the Gardner family formed a side in the cricket field.\n\nMR. GEORGE GIBSON, a native of Jamaica, died at Carlton, Melbourne on September 5th, aged 83. His first appearance in a match of note was for Victoria v. New South Wales, on the Melbourne ground, in December, 1865, and his highest innings in a first-class game 41--against the same colony in March, 1872--for playing which, he was presented with a bat made from a willow-tree grown in his own garden. In addition to being a capable batsman, he was a good wicket-keeper.\n\nCHARLES W. GREGORY, died at St. Vincent's Hospital Darlinghurst, New South Wales, on November 14th. Born on September 13th, 1878, he was only in his thirty-third year. At one time it was confidently expected that he would rival his brother, Sydney Gregory, and make a great name for himself, but, though he did many brilliant things, he proved, on the whole, a disappointment and was never thought quite good enough to be picked for a tour in England. From some cause or other he generally failed on big occasions. One performance will cause his name to be remembered. For New South Wales against Queensland at Brisbane in November 1906, he scored 383--the second highest innings on record in a first-class and the highest in Australia.\n\nMR. ROBERT HALFORD, J.P., President of the Nottinghamshire County C.C., died suddenly at Nottingham on September 23rd, in seventieth year.\n\nJAMES HALLOWS, one of the best all-round cricketers ever produced by Lancashire, died at Farnworth, near Bolton, on May 20th, after an illness of six weeks. As he was born at Little Lever on November 14th, 1875, he was in his 35th year at the time of his death. Ill-health--he was subject to epileptic fits--interfered greatly with his cricket, but he did enough during his comparatively short career to stamp himself as one of the best players of his time. He was left-handed both as batsman and bowler. In addition to possessing a sound defence he had several good strokes on the off side, while as a bowler he could make the ball break either way and had a deceptive flight. His early cricket was played with Little Lever Temperance C.C., and afterwards with Little Lever, whose batting and bowling averages he headed the first season he was a member of the first eleven. In 1896, on the strength of his doings in club cricket, he was chosen for the Lancashire Colts match at Old Trafford, and at once made his mark by scoring 133 in his first innings and 77 not out in his second. On the advice of the late Mr. S. M. Crosfield he forsook fast bowling in favour of the medium-pace style, and never had cause to regret the decision. In his first year at Old Trafford he took eighty-four wickets and had a batting average of 25, and in the following season he played his first match for Lancashire. It was, however, not until 1901 then became a regular member of the side, and he then batted so well that he would have been worth a place in the team if he had not able to bowl at all. His great season was that of 1904, when his all-round cricket enabled Lancashire to carry off the Championship. Barnes had thrown in his lot with Staffordshire, and a very successful season had not been anticipated. Hallows, however, rose to the occasion, and in Championship matches alone scored 1,058 runs and took 108 wickets. In all first-class cricket during the season his record was 1,071 runs and 108 wickets. In more recent years he failed to show such form, ill-health being chiefly responsible, and 1907--against Essex at Manchester--he appeared for his county the last time.\n\nMR. WILLIAM ILBERT HANCOCK, of 27, Anne Street, Cavendish Square, died on January 20th, aged 36. He was a useful cricketer and appeared on a few occasions for Somerest.\n\nMR. J. HARRINGTON, proprietor of the hotel at the Sussex County ground, Hove, died on March 25th.\n\nMR. WILLIAM HARRIS, a well-known figure on Essex cricket grounds, died in January at the age of 80. He had a cricket record of forty-five seasons as player and twenty seasons as umpire.\n\nDANIEL HAYWARD, brother of the famous Tom Hayward, of Cam-bridge, and father of the present-day Surrey batsman, died at Cambridge on May 30th. He was born at Chatteris on October 19th, 1832, and was thus in his seventy-eighth year at the time of his death. In 1854, owing to the mistaken notion that he was born in the county, he played in one match for Surrey--the Haywards were a very old Mitcham family and in 1860 he began to appear for Cambridgeshire. He as a good long-stop and bat.\n\nTHOMAS ARTHUR HEARNE, the ground superintendent at Lord's since 1898, died in St. Bartholomew's Hospital on January 29th. He was born at Stoke Poges, in Buckinghamshire, on December 19th, 1849, and was a son of Tom Hearne, elder brother of \" C.F.,\" and first cousin of \" G.G.,\" Frank and Alec. He never was famous as a cricketer, but possessed a very sound knowledge of the game. Before succeeding Pearce at Lord's, he was groundsman at Wellington College.\n\nALLEN HILL, born at Kirkheaton, near Huddersfield, November 14th, 1845, died at Leyland in Lancashire on August 29th. Although he played his last match for Yorkshire so long ago as 1883, Allen Hill is still vividly remembered as one of the best right-handed fast bowlers of his day. It is a curious fact that, though he did not come out until long after the alteration in 1864 of law 10, he bowled in the old fashioned style with a purely round-arm action, the hand at the moment of delivery being very little above the shoulder.\n\nGreat as was his reputation, he would probably been thought still more of if it had not been his fate to follow Freeman in the Yorkshire eleven. He proved an admirable substitute for that famous bowler but he had not Freeman's wonderful spin and, as the late Mr. William Yardley, among others, contended, his lower action made him easier to see. His delivery was the one of best of its kind that can be recalled and with a far shorter run up to the wicket than most modern fast bowlers find necessary he had great pace.\n\nHe sprang into fame in 1871, when against Surrey at the Oval he took twelve wickets--six in each innings and all them bowled down--at a cost of only 57 runs. For this fine performance he was presented by a supporter of Yorkshire cricket resident in London with a silver cup. The match was played on the 21st and 22nd of August and from that time forward Hill's position was secure. He was at his very best in the summer of 1874 when just at the height of the season an accident interfered with his cricket. He was indeed curiously unfortunate in meeting mishaps. His knee gave way when he was bowling as well ever in 1879 and finally a broken collar-bone cut short his career.\n\nIn the Gentlemen and Players' match at Lord's in 1874 he did the \"hat-trick \" in the Gentlemen's second innings, bowling I. D. Walker, and catching and bowling A. W. Ridley and A. N. Hornby. Personally Hill was one of the most popular of professional cricketers --a man of kindly nature and gentle manners. When his cricket days were over he found an excellent friend in the late Mr. Stannard of Leyland who gave him an engagement that he retained to day of his death. Hill went to Australia in the winter of 1876-77 with James Lillywhite's team and took part in the first match in which the Australians met England on level terms.\n\nIn the North v. South match, at Tunbridge Wells in 1875 he opened the bowling for the former and in his first over dismissed W. G. Grace with the first ball, Charlwood with the second, and G. F. Grace with the fourth. On his first appearance in the Gentlemen v. Players' match--at the Oval in 1874--he took nine wickets for 150 runs and in the ten matches in which he bowled against the Gentlemen between 1874 and 1882 he obtained forty wickets at a cost of 21.25 runs each.\n\nIn July, 1884, Hill was given the Yorkshire v. Lancashire match at Sheffield for his benefit, but it yielded him only \u00a3376 15s. 7d.\n\nMR. HENRY JACKSON, for twenty-five years captain of the Burton C.C., died at Douglas, Isle of Man, on July 22nd, aged 47.\n\nMR. ALFRED JARMAN, a native of Hunslet, died at Little Horton, Bradford, on March 30th, aged 60. Although a good cricketer, never appeared for his county, but in 1874 he played for Yorkshire United v. Derbyshire at Leeds, scoring 26 and 9. For many years he played with the Bradford C.C., and was captain of the team which won the Yorkshire League Cup in 1893.\n\nMR. R. HUBERT JOHNSTON died suddenly at the Edinburgh University Ball on February 15th, in his forty-sixth year. A good wicket-keeper and a sound batsman, he was in the Clifton Eleven in 1883 and 1884, and afterwards did well for the Grange C.C. and in representative Scottish matches. At Lord's in July, 1892, he scored 163 for The Grange v. M.C.C., and in partnership with Mr. A. G. Grant-Asher (215) put on 328 for the fourth wicket: the Grange declared with nine wickets down for 557. In 1902 and 1905 he captained the Scottish team against the Australians. He was also a good golfer and footballer.\n\nMR. BASSETT JONES, a native of Cardiff, died in New York City March 25th, aged 60. He was a good left-handed slow bowler and a fair bat, and was in turn identified with the old St. George's C.C., the Staten Island C.C., and the New York Veterans' Cricket Association.\n\nPERCIVAL KING, for many years prominently identified with the game in Scotland, died in Edinburgh on October 29th. He was born at Stockwell, in Surrey, on December 9th, 1835, and was described in Scores and Biographies as \" A good average batsman, and a fast and slow, round-armed bowler.\" For many seasons, commencing in 1862, he was coach at Merchiston, Fettes and Loretto, and frequently captained the Players of Scotland against the Gentlemen.

Born at Petersfield, in Hampshire, on January 26th, 1856, Mr. Luff was in his fifty-fifth year at the time of his death. For some time his health had been precarious, and although he benefited to some extent by a visit to Australia during the winter of 1907-8, the improvement was only temporary, and last year he suffered another breakdown which proved to be the beginning of the end. For many years he acted as secretary of the Cricketers' Fund Friendly Society, and only within a fortnight of his death did he resign the position.\n\nMR. AIDAN T. LYONS, the best all-round cricketer of the Eastern Province, died at Queenstown on February 12th, at the early age of 31. He was a good batsman, a fast-medium right-hand bowler, and a sound captain.

He was a very useful batsman in his younger days and was in the Uppingham eleven in 1850 and 1851. He was the father of Mr. H. H. Marriott, but was not related to Mr. Charles Marriott, a fine batsman, who captained Leicestershire before Mr. de Trafford occupied the position.\n\nTHE REV. CHARLES MARTIN, who was born on October 17th, 1840, died at Darlington, Totnes, on February 23rd. Ho was educated at Winchester where he was coached by Caffyn and F. Bell, and was in the Eleven in 1857 and two following years. In his three matches with Eton he scored 41 runs in six innings. Proceeding to Oxford,he did not obtain his Blue. He was described as an effective and pretty bat and an excellent long-stop.\n\nCAPT. SPENCER DUNCAN MAUL was born at Newport Pagnell, on June 6th, 1859, and died at Biarritz on April 29th. He was educated at Uppingham, where he was in the eleven in 1876; against Repton he scored 26 and 4, and against Shrewsbury 19. Going to Sandhurst, he, in 1878, when captain of the eleven, scored 30 and 219 not out against Woolwich at Prince's, carrying his bat through the second innings, which amounted to 428. A heavy scorer in minor cricket, he in 1881 played an innings of 212 for Curragh Camp against Phoenix Park, and in 1884 twice in one week exceeded the second hundred, scoring 235 for Hanslope Park v. Ambhurst Ramblers and 284 for Bicester v. Abingdon. In 1891 he first appeared for Buckinghamshire, heading the county's batting averages that season with 30, and for several years he proved one of the batsmen on the side. Scores and Biographies said of him : \" Is a fine and free hitter.....also an active field, generally taking cover point, and can bowl middle-paced round-armed.\" His two broth Messrs. H. C. and J. B. Maul, were also cricketers of note.\n\nSIR MALCOLM MCEACHERN, a former Lord Mayor of Melbourne, died at Cannes on March 11th, aged 57.

ROBERT STUART NEWHALL, who was born at Philadelphia on September 16th, 1852, died at his native place on the 9th December. He was one of the best exponents and most generous supporters the game ever had in America, and in 1881 captain the Gentlemen of Philadelphia during their tour in England. For many years he was prominently identified with the Young American Club, which amalgamated with the Germantown C.C. in 1889. He was a skilful captain and a fine batsman. His highest innings was 126 v. Gentlemen of Cheshire in 1884, but his best was probably played against the Australians in 1878.\n\nMR. JAMES B. OAKLEY, who served on the Surrey County C.C. Committee from 1883 until 1909 without a break, died at Carlton House, Barnes, on July 15th, aged 70. On Parker's Piece, Cambridge, on June 17th, 1867, he played single-handed (with four to field with him) against twelve servants and tradesmen and won by six runs, scoring 23 and 4 against 7 and 14. That year, when he was a member of the Pembroke College Eleven, he was described as \"A fine bat, with a good defence ; and a good straight bowler.\"\n\nDR. EDWIN JOSEPH OGDEN, the founder and for many years the President of the Chicago C.C., died at Chicago on February 14th, aged 80. He was born at Cooksville, Canada, and was the father of Dr. E. Russell Ogden, who captained the Canadian team which visited England in 1887.\n\nMR. THOMAS J. O'REILLY, a well-known figure in New York crickcting circles for a quarter of a century, died at Brooklyn, N.Y., on May 3rd. He was born in Dublin on March 6th, 1865, and was educated at Wesley College in that city.\n\nGEORGE EUGENE PALMER, one of the greatest of Australia's many famous bowlers, died at Badaginnie, near Banalla, Victoria, on August 22nd. Born at Albury, New South Wales, on February 22nd, 1860, he was in his fifty-first year at the time of his death. Few bowlers have reached the top of the tree so early in life. His fame was established when at Melbourne, in March 1879, playing for Victoria against Lord Harris' Eleven, he took six wickets, all bowled down, for 64 runs, and three wickets for 30. Among the batsmen who fell to him were Lord Harris and George ulyett, twice each, Toni Emmett, and Vernon Royle. His bowling astonished the English team, but to one fine judge of cricket in Melbourne his success did not come as a surprise. Mr. Medley, of the Melbourne Age, has told the story of how the late Mr. T. V. Wills --for many years the moving spirit of Victorian cricket--asked him one morning on the Melbourne ground if he would like to go out to the nets and see a better bowler than Frank Allan. From the day of his success against Lord Harris' team there was no doubt as to the position Palmer would take in Australian cricket, and for the next six years he had no superior except Spofforth. As all who follow cricket will remember he paid four visits to England, coming over with the teams of 1880,1882,1184, and 1886. Many English batsmen of those days maintain that they never met a bowler who was more difficult on a hard true wicket. In one way his ectiveness in fine weather told against him, as on soft wickets he did not get the same opportunities as Spofforth and Harry Boyle. During the latter part of the season of 1880, however, when Spofforthwas laid aside by an injured hand, he had a chance of showing what he could do under all conditions, and his success was great. Still he was not so accurate as Spofforth, and afterwards Turner, on a sticky wicket, often doing too much and missing the stumps after beating the batsman. Palmer had many gifts as a bowler. His delivery was one of the best and most natural ever seen, he was a fine off-break and a good variety of pace, and his yorker was deadly. Moreover he bowled a quick leg-break with extraordinary skill. This leg-break, however, proved to some extent his undoing. While he kept it strictly in reserve it was an invaluable servant to him, but as time went on he bowled it more and more and his accuracy of pitch suffered. When he came to England for the last time 1886 he was not nearly so good a bowler as he had been in his three previous visits. It must be said, however, that while his bowling declined, he developed into an excellent batsman. Following his return to Australia after the unsuccessful tour of 1886, he had the misfortune to fracture his knee-cap and not much more was seen of him in first-class cricket. The latter part of life was the reverse of prosperous, but on this point there is need to dwell. He married a sister of Blackham, the great wicket-keeper.\n\nIn Test matches between England and Australia he scored 296 runs with an average of 14.09 and took seventy-eight wickets for 21.51 runs each. In eleven a side matches for the Australians in England, Palmer took 80 wickets in 1880, 138 in 1882, 132 in 1884, and 110 wickets in all matches in 1886.\n\nCHARLES RANDON, an elder brother of F. Randon, the Notts and Leicestershire fast bowler, was born at Stapleford, in Notts, on February 6th, 1840, and died at Hathern on May 2nd. In Scores and Biographies (ix--12) he was described as \" An excellent fast bowler, a fair bat, and in the field generally in the slips.\" He accepted many engagements, and it was not until 1874 that he made his first appearance for Leicestershire.\n\nMR. RICHARD HENRY RAPHAEL died on January 21st, aged 36. He was in the Wellington Eleven in 1890 and 1891, scoring in the latter year 395 runs with an average of 30.38. He was described as ' A most useful, hard-hitting bat, invaluable in giving confidence to his side :a fair change bowler.\" He did not obtain his Blue at Oxford, but played frequently for the Authenties, and in 1902-3 was a member of their team which visited India. During the tour he made 642 runs with an average of 23.70, his highest score being 111 against the Parsees at Bombay. Mr. J. E. Raphael, of Oxford University and Surrey, is his cousin.\n\nADMIRAL SIR HARRY HOLDSWORTH RAWSON, G.C.B., G.C.M.G.,died on November 3rd, aged 66. He played in the first match which ever took place in Japan, being a member of the Fleet team which beat Yokohama in 1863. Whilst Governor of New South Wales (1902--1907) he showed his interest in the game by becoming the Patron of the New South Wales Cricket Association.\n\nMR. ERNEST RAYNER, a well-known West Australian cricketer, died at Perth on February 27th. He was considered one of the best bowlers in the local Pennant matches.\n\nSIR JOHN PICKERSGILL RODGER, K.C.M.G., who was born in London on February 12th, 1851, died in London on September 19th, a few days after his return from seven years' service as Governor of the Gold Coast. He was in the Eton Eleven in 1869 and 1870 and in the latter year was described as \" A good sound bat, though his style is peculiar ; may generally he depended on for runs ; slow in the field, but much improved.\" In his four Public School matches he made 116 runs in six innings and on three occasions was on the winning side. He did not obtain his Blue at Oxford, and his connection with Kent was restricted to a single match--with M.C.C., at Canterbury, in 1870. Mr. W. W. Rodger, who played occasionally for Kent, as his elder brother.\n\nTHE REV. EDWARD HENRY ROGERS, for many years President of the Thomas Ditton C.C., died at Worthing on January 29th, in his eigthy-fourth year.\n\nMR. GEORGE MURRAY ROYLE was born at Nottingham on January 9th,1843 and died at Fern Lodge, Sherwood Rise, on February 26th. His early cricket was played with the Nottingham Commercial C.C, for which he scored 10 and 100 not out against the Australian Aborigina1 team of 1868. His first match for the county was against Gloucestershire at Trent Bridge in 1871, and his last against Surrey at the Oval ten years later. Mr. Haygarth said of him : \" Is a batsman above the average, and excels in the field at long-leg, and mid-wicket off.\" He was devoted to the game all his life, and although business prevented him from playing as often as was desired, he se on the County Committee for sixteen years.\n\nMR. EDWIN THOMAS SACHS, at one time cricket editor of the Field newspaper, died at Reigate on September 26th.\n\nTHE VENERABLE ERNEST GREY SANDFORD, M.A., Archdeacon of Coventry, and formerly Archdeacon and Canon Residentiary of Exeter, died at Exmouth on March 8th. He was born at Dunchurch in Warwickshire, on August 16th, 1839, and must be regarded as one of the most accomplished all-round cricketers ever produced by Rugby. Whilst batting was his forte, his wicket-keeping and slow underhand bowling were also of a very high standard. Ill-health unfortunately, handicapped him severely and in consequently his career as a player was a very short one. He was coached by Lillywhite and Alfred Diver, and played his first match for the School in September, 1852, when only thirteen years of age ; he did however, appear again in the Eleven until 1854. Matches with Marlborough were not started until 1855, but Sandford remained long enough at the School--he was Captain in 1856 and two following years--to appear in three of them. In the game of 1856 he played a wonderful not-out innings of 88--one of the finest public school displays ever seen at Lord's. The only other double-figure on the side was 11 by A. Helme. In the following year he was only slightly less prominent, playing an innings of 58 and taking eight wickets. Among his contemporaries at Rugby were T. W. Wills, W. H. Bullock, C. T. Royds and M. T. Martin. Proceeding Oxford, Sandford obtained his Blue as a Freshman, and in the same season (1859) was asked to assist the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's. The Gentlemen were over-matched, but Sandford --still under twenty years of age--made 28 and 13 against Wisden, Willsher, and Jackson. Ill-health kept him out of the Universitymatch in 1860, and in the following year he took part in the match only after Cambridge had consented to allow him the services of a runner. As it happened, he scored only nine and three, and Cambridge won by 133 runs. Of Archdeacon Sandford it may truly be said that he possessed that amount of genius for the game which would have made him a great player in any age.\n\nMR. THOMAS SANKEY died at Blackpool Grammar School, Lancashire, on May 23rd, aged 53. He was born at Bilston, in Staffordshire, and played occasionally for his native county, Shropshire Oxfordshire, Bucks., and Berkshire, and in one season made four hundreds in succession. He was the founder of the Blackpool Cricket Week in 1904.\n\nDR. HENRY JAMES HERBERT SCOTT died on the 23rd of September at Scone, New South Wales, where he had for many years practised as a medical man. He was born at Toorak, near Melbourne, on the 6th of December, 1858. Scott's career in first-class cricket lasted less than ten years, beginning in February, 1878, at Sydney, when he played in his first big match--Victoria v. New South Wales--and ending with the tour in England in 1886. In his young days he was a fast bowler, but his reputation as a cricketer was gained entirely as a batsman. He began to be talked about in 1882, and an innings of 114 not out that he played against New South Wales at Melbourne in the season of 1883-84 was the main cause of his being given a place in the Australian team that came to England in 1884. He had a very successful tour, scoring 102 against England at the Oval in the memorable match in which Australia ran up a total of 551, and getting, among other good scores, 75 and not out, 31 against England at Lord's, 82 not out against the Gentlemen at Lord's, 79 against Gloucestershire at Clifton, and 65 against Gloucestershire at Cheltenham. He stood third to Murdoch and Percy McDonnell in the batting, with an aggregate of 973 runs and an average of over twenty-two. It was a misfortune for Scott that he should have been chosen by the Melbourne Club they sent to England in 1886. Under happier circumstances he might have got on well, but fortune was against him. Quarrels began among the players during the opening match at Sheffield Park, and Scott had neither the strength of character nor the experience as a leader that the difficulties of his position demanded. He did himself justice as a batsman, scoring 1,289 runs with an average of just under twenty-two, but as a captain he had anything but a pleasant time. His best score during the tour was 123 against Middlesex, at Lord's. In an innings of 67 not out against Yorkshire at Sheffield he hit in one over of four balls from Saul Wade twenty-two runs--a six, a four, and two sixes. When the tour was over he stayed behind in England to finish his medical studies, and on his return to Australia cricket saw no more of him.\n\nMR. PHILLIP SHERRIDAN, Secretary of the Sydney Cricket Ground, died at Darlinghurst, Sydney, on January 14th. He was born at Edgeworthstown, on February 17th, 1833, and was therefore in his seventy-seventh year at the time of his death. He went to Australia in 1849, and it was due chiefly to him that the sydney ground, on which over two hundred thousand pounds have been spent, was formed, and it was under his guidance that it came to beregarded as the best appointed ground in the world. In 1907 Sheridan visited England and saw the South Africans play several of their matches.\n\nMORDECAI SHERWIN, the famous Notts wicket-keeper, died at Nottingham on July 3rd in his sixtieth year. He was born at Kimberley, Notts, on February 26th, 1851. He played his first match for Notts in August 1876, and took part in some of the latter fixtures in the following season, but it was not until 1880 that became the regular wicket-keeper of the eleven. From 1880 held his position without a break down to the end of the season 1893, after which the Notts Committee, for some not very obvious reason, dropped him. He became a member of the M.C.C.'s Ground staff in 1877, and retained his engagement for a quarter of a century. The M.C.C. gave him the Middlesex and Somerset match on Whit-Monday 1894, but the result was disappointing, the game ending on the second afternoon. Among the English wicket-keepers of his day Sherwin had scarcely a superior, except Pilling and Mr. MacGregor.\n\nA very bulky man of great physical power, he could stand any amount of work, and his strong fleshy hands did not often suffer damage. He was inclined to show off a little for the benefit of the crowd, but this after all was a small fault. He was at all times one of the cheeriest of cricketers. Although he took several times in Gentlemen and Players' matches he only once kept wicket in a Test Match in England, playing at Lord's in 1888, when Turner and Ferris gave Australia a victory on a ruined pitch. At different times the Hon. Alfred Lyttelton, Pilling, Mr. E. F. S. Tylecote, and Mr. MacGregor stood in his way. Sherwin paid one visit to Australia, being a member of Shaw and Shrewsbury's team in the winter of 1886-87. He had no pretensions as a batsman but he often made runs when they were wanted, and as a bowler one memorable achievement stands to his credit. In a Notts v. Middlesex match at Lord's in 1892, when the regular bowlers were tired out, he went on as a last hope and took two of the last five Middlesex wickets for nine runs, helping Notts to win the math within four minutes of time. In his young days Sherwin was a good man at Association football, keeping goal for Notts County. During the sixteen seasons for which he played for Notts he stumped 110 batsmen and caught 365.\n\nALDERMAN WILLIAM SMITH, for many years a member of the Committee of the Sussex County C.C., of which he was this year elected a vice-president, died at Rustington, near Littlehampton, on September 26th, aged 77. He was six times Mayor of Chichester.\n\nMR. UNWIN SOWTER, one of the founders of the Derbyshire County C.C. in 1870, died at Derby on April 14th. He was born at Derby on April 22nd, 1839, and was educated at Derby School. Scores and Biographies (xi--429) says of him :--\" Is a good batsman, and fields well, generally at point.\" He played for Derbyshire from 1871 until 1876, and for many years afterwards was a vice-president of the County Club and a member of the Committee.\n\nTHE 5th EARL SPENCER (JOHN POYNTZ SPENCER), K.G., P.C., M.A., D.C.L., LL.D., was born at Spencer House, London, on October 27th, 1835, and died at Althorp, Northants, on August 13th. He became a member of the M.C.C. in 1854, and was President of the Club in 1861. He had also filled the position of President of the Northamptonshire County C.C.\n\nWILLIAM SWAIN, at one time a well-known Yorkshire cricketer, died at East Brisbane on October 5th. He was born at Burley near Otley, on September 8th, 1830, and had therefore just completed his 80th year. In Scores and Biographies (viii., 300) it is said of him :--\" Bats in good style, is a nice field, either at point or long-stop, while his bowling is round-armed, fast or slow.\" On July 11th, 1853, he played perhaps the most extraordinary single-wicket match on record with John Barrett, of Otley, the ball all through the contest not once touching the bat, and on October 11th, 1861, he beat at single wicket an eleven (very inferior, however) of the Burley Club.\" Swain accepted many engagements and was for some years a tailor in Halifax. Later he opened a Sports outfitter's shop in Bradford, and eventually settled in Queensland. As recently as September 1908, a match (in which he himself took part) was played in Brisbane for his benefit. He took the greatest interest in the game to the end, and in May last contributed some reminiscences of King Edward's connection with cricket to a local newspaper. In his younger days he was of a poetical turn of mind, and produced several cricket verses.\n\nMR. JAMES SWIFT, a well-known umpire in first-class cricket in Australia, died in Sydney on June 27th, aged 62.\n\nTHE RT. HON. J. TOMKINSON, M.P., died on April 10th, as the result of injuries received whilst riding in the Parliamentary Steeple-chase at Epping on the previous day. He was born on July 8th, 1840, and was educated at Rugby, where he was in the Twenty-two from 1856 to 1859.\n\nWILLIAM TOMLIN, who was born at Leicester on September 1867, died of cancer at his native place on May 11th, at the age of 42. He was one of the best batsmen who ever appeared for Leicestershire, but his career as a county player was rather short extending only from 1887 to 1899. His best seasons were 1894 and 1895, when he headed the county's batting averages. His finest innings was probably his 106 not out against Richardson's bowling in the match with Surrey at the Oval in 1895, when his batting enabled Leicestershire to gain a victory which some effective bowling by Woodcock had rendered possible. His highest score for the county was 140 against M.C.C. and Ground at Lord's in 1894.\n\nCANON EDWARD FIENNES TROTMAN, who was born on May 25th, 1828, died at Marshfield, Wiltshire, on April 19th. As a member of the Winchester Eleven of 1847, he made 5 and 0, v. Harrow, and 14 v. Eton, his side being beaten on each occasion by an innings. He proceeded to Oriel College, Oxford, but did not obtain his Blue. MR. ERNEST TRUBSHAW, J.P., D.L., at one time a member of Glamorganshire Eleven, died at Llanelly on September 3rd, at age of 65.\n\nMR. CHARLES CORBETT TURNBULL, of the Cheltenham Eleven of 1859 and two following years, died suddenly at Eastbourne on September 11th, aged 68. In his three matches with Marlborough he made 55 runs in four completed innings, and in his last season headed the batting averages with 24. In 1860 he was described as \" A first-rate cricketer ; has a strong defence, and hits hard all especially to leg ; bowls well, with a destructive break-and shows promise of oven further excellence in that department.\"\n\nTHE RT. REV. ARTHUR BERESFORD TURNER, D.D., Bishop in Korea, died of blood-poisoning at Chemulpo on October 28th, in his forty-ninth year. He was born at Farley Hospital in Salisbury, and was educated at Marlborough, where he was in the Eleven in 1880 and 1881, being captain in the latter year. He distinguished himself by playing two fine innings of 56 and 64 against Rugby at Lord's. That season he was described as \" A very powerful and clean hitter, with a better defence than appears at first and has been very successful this year ; a good field away from the wicket as captain worked hard to ensure success, but wanted a little more experience.\" In 1880 his batting average was 10.60 and the following season 28.16. Among his contemporaries at Marlborough were E. E. Steel, H. M. Leaf and F. E. Rowe. In 1882 he scored 1 and 17 in the Freshmen's match at Oxford, but was never picked for the University. At Blackheath in December, 1884, he was a member of the Oxford XV which beat Cambridge by three goals and a try to a try.\n\nMR. HARCOURT TURNER, who succeeded Mr. V. E. Walker as Treasurer of the Middlesex County C.C. in 1906, died on March 27th. He became a member of the M.C.C. in 1873 and served on the Middlesex County C.C. Committee for many years. He was educated at Cheltenham, but was not in the Eleven.\n\nSIR JOHN WILLIAMS WALLINGTON, K.C.B., who was born at Dursley, Gloucestershire, on March 16th, 1822, died at Keevil Manor, near Trowbridge, on March 23rd, aged 88. Although a very useful player, he did not obtain a place in the Eleven whilst at Harrow, but later he took part in several very good-class club games, and was responsible for the inauguration of matches played by the Gentlemen of Hampshire. He was the father of Mr. E. W. Wallington, of Sherborne and Oxford, and was for sixty-seven years a member of the Duke of Beaufort's Hunt.\n\nMR. ARTHUR FRASER WALTER, D.L, J.P., Chairman of the Times Publishing Company, died at Bearwood, Wokingham, on February 22nd. He was born at Waterloo Lodge, Wokingham, on September 12th, 1846, and was educated at Eton, where he was in the Eleven in 1864 and 1865. Against Harrow he made 45 runs in four innings and against Winchester 29 in two. Proceeding to Oxford, he played against Cambridge in 1869, when, although he failed to make a run in either innings, he took six wickets--those of V. Dale, H. A. Richardson, W. Yardley, C. I. Thornton, C. A. Absolom and M. H. Stow--for 59 runs. Cambridge won by 58 runs. Scores and Biographies said of him : \" Is a good average batsman, combining fair hitting with strong defence, bowls round-armed of moderate speed, and is an excellent field (throwing well in at the wicket), though taking no place in particular.\" His father played for Eton in 1836 and a younger brother, Mr. H. M. Walter, in 1866 and two following years. In 1872 he married a daughter of the Rev. T. A. Anson, the famous wicket-keeper.\n\nTHE REV. FRANCIS WALKER, whose death occurred at Brandon,Manitoba, was educated at Trinity College, Toronto, where was in the Eleven. On settling at Brandon he undertook the captaincy of the St. George C.C., and for several years was one of the best cricketers in that city.\n\nMR. HARRY WARNER, for very many years prominently identified the with the game in New York and New Jersey, died in February at age of 82. He was a Nottingham man by birth.\n\nWALTER WATTS, for fifty years and until 1908 custodian of the University Cricket Ground at Cambridge, died at Cambridge in his eighty-fourth year. He was born at Wimpole, Cambridgeshire, on March 7th, 1827, and was 39 years of ago when he made his first appearance for his native county. He was a useful slow round-armed bowler and generally fielded at short-leg. In 1891 the match between the University and Mr. C. I. Thornton's Eleven was played for his benefit. George Watts, who has played for Surrey and Cambridgeshire, is his son.\n\nJOSEPH WELLS, who played for Kent in 1862 and 1863, died at Liss, in Hampshire, on October 20th. He was born at Penshurst, in Kent, on July 14th, 1828, and was therefore in his eighty-third year at the time of his death. Scores and Biographies (vii--243) says of him :--\" Height 5ft. 8ins., and weight 10st. 7lbs. (or 11st.). Bowls very fast round-armed, with a low delivery ; but did not appear for his county till he was about fourty years of age....As a bat he does not excel, and fields at short-slip.\" He will always be remembered for his great feat in the match between Kent and Sussex on Box's ground at Brighton in June, 1862, when, in the first innings of Sussex he bowled down the wickets of Dean, Mr. S. Austin Leigh, Ellis and Fillery with consecutive balls. In 1856 he was responsible for the revival of the Bromley C.C., whilst from 1857 to 1869 he was engaged at Chislehurst by the West Kent Club, from 1870 to 1872 by Bickley, Park, and afterwards by Norwich Grammar School. He was the father of H. G. Wells, the famous novelist, and a nephew of Timothy Duke, the noted bat and ball maker of Penshurst.\n\nMR. CHARLES WILLIAM PRESCOTT-WESTCAR, J.P., a keen supporter of cricket, and a familiar figure at Canterbury during the week, died at Strode Park, Herne, Kent, on November 10th, aged 76.\n\nWILLIAM (\" BILLY \") WHITTAM, a well-known card-printer seller in the North of England, died at Sheffield on January 8th, aged 76.\n\nARTHUR WOODCOCK, the well-known Leicestershire fast bowler, died (as the result of poison self-administered) at Billesdon, on May 14th. He was born at Northampton on September 23rd, but when only a few months old was taken into Leicestershire, where he learned the game and spent the greater part of his life. In 1887 he accepted an engagement with the Mitcham C.C., of Surrey, and the form he showed whilst there was so good that Mr. Alcock, upon being asked to recommend a player as coach at Haverford College mentioned him, the result being that he entered upon the engagement in 1888 and retained it until 1894. The vacation enabled him to play in England from July to September, but it was not until 1889 that he was invited to assist Leicestershire. He played in only one match that year, but appeared more frequently in the next season, when, in consecutive matches against Essex and Warwickshire he took seventeen wickets for 201 runs.\n\nDuring the next two years he appeared for the side as often as his American engagement permitted and how much Leicestershire's promotion to the first-class was due to his bowling is a matter of history. In 1895 he became a member of the ground-staff at Lord's, and during that season took 102 wickets in first-class matches for a fraction over nineteen runs each. That, as it happened, was his most successful year. He continued to appear for Leicestershire regularly for a few more seasons, but knee trouble handicapped him severely and in 1903 he dropped out of the side. Woodcock possessed a splendid physical development, and at one time was, C. J. Kortright alone excepted, the fastest bowler in England. As a batsman he was poor, but he enjoyed one pronounced success, making 62 not out at Old Trafford in 1898 against the bowling of Mold, Cuttell, and Briggs. After dropping out of county cricket he continued to play for the M.C.C., and, in a match against Lewes Priory on the Dripping Pan, Lewes, as recently as 1908, bowled a bail off the wicket 149 feet six inches, sending it over a fourteen feet bank and a wall on the boundary.\n\nThe following Deaths occurred during 1909, but particulars were not recieved in time for inclusion in WISDEN's ALMANACK for 1910\n\nMR. HERBERT AWDRY, who was born in 1852, died at Winchester, on December 13th, 1919. He was educated at Winchester and New College, Oxford, and was in the former Eleven in 1870. He was a fair batsman and a useful bowler.\n\nMR. STEYNING BEARD, a staunch supporter of Sussex cricket, died at Hove on December 13th, 1909, at the age of 64.\n\nMR. W. C. BOTEJUE, a well-known Ceylon cricketer, died at Bambalapitiya on December 27th, 1909, at the early age of 27. He was a sound batsman, a good fast bowler, and a fine field. In 1906 he was a member of the Ceylon team which visited Bombay.\n\nMR. WILLIAM BROCKIE, at one time one of the foremost of American cricketers, died in New York City on November 4th, 1909, He was born at Birkenhead on June 28th, 1864, but learned the game in United States. As early as 1882 he obtained his first experiene of international cricket, and two seasons later, when only 19 years of age, visited England a member of the Philadelphia team. On the tour he scored 369 runs with an average of 111.42, his best innings being 113 not out against Scarborough, when he and Stoever (100) added 178 together for the ninth wicket in ninety minutes. He was invited to join the Philadelphian team which came over in 1889, but the claims of business prevented him from doing so. He was a sound and stylish batsman with good hitting powers, and one of the most brilliant fieldsmen ever identified with the game in America. For many years he was committed with the Germantown C.C., and the success with which the C. C. met from 1889 to 1899 was in a large measure due to his captaincy. He played frequently for the United States v. Canada and for the Gentlemen of Philidelphia against visiting teams.\n\nSIR DONALD CURRIE, K.C.M.G., the famous shipowner and philanthropist, who was born at Greenock on September 17th died at the Manor House, Sidmouth, on April 13th, 1909. He was the donor of the Currie Cup, which has been the means of increasing the popularity of the game in South Africa.\n\nMR. HAROLD LITTLEWOOD DAWSON died in Northern Nigeria on November 16th, 1909, at the early age of 34. He made capital scores for Streatham, and in 1901 played for Surrey at The Oval against the West Indians.\n\nMR. JOHN W. DIXON, who was born at Settrington, on December 16th, 1869, died at Brooklyn, (N.Y.), on December 16th 1909. For the last seventeen years of his life he was with the Manhattan C. C. of which he was at the time of secretary and treasurer.\n\nPREBENDARY CHARLES THOMAS FRAMPTON, the wicket-keeper of the Harrow Eleven of 1840, died at Chiehester, on December 6th, 1909, at the age of 88. In his three completed innings against Eton and Winchester he made only 15 runs, but in the second of innings of Winchester he stumped two and caught one. He did not succeed in obtaining his Blue at Cambridge.\n\nMR. EDWARD ALBERT KNIGHT, a member of the Sussex County C.C. Committee, died at St. Leonard's on December 29th, 1909, at the age of 47.\n\nTHE REV. PHILIP EDWARD MILES, died on May 1st, 1909, in his seventy-ninth year. He played for Harrow in 1847 and two following years, and in the six Public School matches was only once on the losing side, Eton winning by nine wickets in 1847. Against Winchester he made 11 runs in five innings, but in the matches with Eton he scored only 13 in six. He did not obtain his Blue at Cambridge.\n\nMR. W. H. MONTGOMERY, who died at Ottawa on May 1st. 1909, at the age of 34, was born at Etobicoke, York County, Ontario, and educated at Upper Canada College, where he was in the Eleven in 1890 and 1891. At the time of his death he was considered the best fast bowler in Canada. He played for several years with the Rosedale C.C. (Toronto) and Winninpeg and latterly in Ottawa, and in 1908 appeared for Canada v. United States, taking five wickets for forty runs.\n\nMR. THOMAS OWEN POTTER, who played for Lancashire against Surrey at Edge Hill in 1866, died at Hoylake, in Cheshire, on April 27th, 1909, aged 64. That was his only appearance for the county, and he scored 39 and O. His brother, Mr. W. H. Potter (who survives), assisted Lancashire in 1870.\n\nMR. HERBERT PRESTON, U .B., J.P., died at Exeter on December 22nd, 1909, at the age of 68. He had been a member of he M.C.C. since 1869 and for several years played for the Incogniti.\n\nMR. EDWARD RILEY, of the New York Veterans' Cricket Association, died in Paterson, New Jersey, on November 29th, 1909. He was born at Coventry, in England, on January 1st, 1845.\n\nTHE REV. CHARLES HENRY WALKER, of the Harrow Eleven of 1852, died at Walkhampton, Devon, on June 28th, 1909. He did very little against Winchester and Eton, and did not obtain a place in the Oxford Eleven. He was contemporary at Harrow with some of the Walkers of Southgate, but was not related to that family. He was born on December 28th, 1833.\n\n\u00a9 John Wisden & Co"}, {"url": "https://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/228565.html", "page_content": "1978\n\nObituaries in 1977\n\nBAKER, GRAHAM CHARSLEY, who died suddenly on February 21, in East London at the age of 45, produced one issue of the South African Cricket Almanack dated 1949/50. He was a Rhodes University student at the time. It was the first Cricket Annual produced in South Africa since 1907, but although he produced only the one issue he may have sown the seed in the mind of Geoffrey Chettle whose South African Cricket Annualwas first produced two years later and has of course been running ever since.\n\nBARTLETT, E. LAWSON, who died in Barbados early in January, was a member of the West Indies sides to England in 1928 and Australia in 1930. His record in England, 584 runs with an average of 24.33, looks nothing much, but he was perhaps a trifle unlucky. Early in July he had just run into form with a glorious 109 against Nottinghamshire and one or two more successes then might have given him the confidence which was all he lacked to be a great batsman. Instead he broke a finger, missed several matches and failed to recover his form. His tour to Australia was a failure except for a beautiful innings of 84 out of 114 in the first innings of the first Test and after this tour he dropped out of the West Indies side. A very small man, he was quick on his feet, a powerful driver and a good cutter, whether square or late. Indeed he had strokes all round the wicket and, when he was making runs, his potentialities were obvious. It was sad that he could so seldom do justice to them.\n\nBENSIMON, ALFRED SAMUEL, who died in Cape Town on May 7, in his 91st year, had a short but very interesting first-class career. He played a single match for Western Province in 1931-32, making his d\u00e9but at the advanced age of 45, and he played three more matches for them in 1933-34 when he was over 47. He was the captain on these three occasions and bowled his leg-breaks so effectively that he took 17 wickets for only 177 runs. These four matches constituted his whole first-class career. As it happened he proved a statistician's nightmare, for his younger brother, Abel, had the identical initials, A.S., and he made his first-class d\u00e9but in 1912-13, twenty years before his elder brother; his career ended in 1923-24. Not surprisingly, it was assumed that they were one and the same person.\n\nBODDINGTON, ROBERT ALAN, who died at Fifield, Oxford, on August 5, aged 85, was in the Rugby XI in 1910 and 1911. A good wicket-keeper and a useful batsman, he was tried for Oxford without getting a blue, but between 1913 and 1922 kept wicket frequently for Lancashire, who at that time had no reliable, professional keeper. A man of great charm, he was for years on the Lancashire Committee and was also prominent at Lord's.\n\nBRICKNELL, GARY A., who was killed in a train crash at Keetmanshoop, South-West Africa, on March 25, aged 22, was a slow left-hander of great promise. He had already taken 58 wickets at 21.38 for Western Province.\n\nBROWN, JOHN ALBERT TOD, who died in hospital on January 10, aged 73 had been President of the Scottish Cricket Union and of the Cricket Society of Scotland, of which he was one of the founders.\n\nCARMODY, DOUGLAS KEITH, who captained the Royal Australian Air Force cricket side in England in 1945 and was vice-captain to Lindsay Hassett in the Victory Tests, died of cancer in Sydney on October 21, aged 58. Shot down over the Dutch coast and made a prisoner of war, Carmody later led Western Australia to their first Sheffield Shield title in 1947-48 and his close-to-wicket field placings took his name as the Carmody Umbrella.\n\nCOBHAM, CHARLES JOHN, 10th VISCOUNT, K.C., P.C., G.C.M.G., G.C.V.O., who died in hospital on March 20, aged 67, was a member of one of the greatest of cricketing families. He himself, as the Hon. C. J. Lyttelton, began to play for Worcestershire in 1932 and, after captaining them on a number of occasions in 1935 and going out to Australia and New Zealand that winter as Vice-Captain of the M.C.C. side under E. R. T. Holmes, was the county's official Captain from 1936 to 1939. This was the more remarkable as at Eton he was nowhere near the XI. But by keenness and close study of the principles of the game he made himself first into a good club cricketer and then into a competent county one.\n\nHe never made the mistake of treating first-class bowlers with exaggerated respect. Observing that Mitchell of Derbyshire always started with a googly against an amateur, he played for it and hit a long way out of the ground. He held that, if one used one's common-sense, a great bowler could be hit as far as an ordinary one (and resented it much more), only one would not be able to hit him successfully for so long. Batting on this theory, he often made 30 or 40 in double-quick time when his companions were groping, and thus was more valuable to the side than his average suggests.\n\nA good example is the Yorkshire match at Stourbridge in 1936, played throughout on a turning wicket of the type on which Yorkshire then were regarded as invincible. Lyttelton impressed on his side that, if they played their normal game, they stood no chance at all: if they slung their bats at the ball, one or two would probably be lucky and get a few. He himself set the example. Telling his left-handed partner, Warne, to keep Verity's bowling, he faced Ellis Robinson, an off-spinner, and in thirty-five minutes made 48, including four 6's and four 4's. As soon as he had to play Verity, he was out. Worcestershire won by 11 runs, their first victory over Yorkshire since 1909.\n\nAgain, against the Australians in 1938, going in first, he scored 50 and 35, being particularly severe on O'Reilly. His highest score for the county and his only century was 162 that year against Leicestershire. A medium-paced bowler who could make the ball swing, he sometimes opened the bowling and occasionally took a wicket with a very slow ball which he called his flipper.\n\nHis county cricket ended with the war, but he continued to play club cricket and indeed found some time to play throughout his period as Governor-General of New Zealand from 1957 to 1962. It was fitting climax in his career when in 1961 at the age of 51 he captained his own team against the M.C.C. at Auckland and made 44 in twenty-one minutes, including two sixes. No one ever enjoyed his cricket more or took more trouble to see that others enjoyed theirs and he amply repaid off the field the debt which he owed to the game.\n\nAs President of the M.C.C. in 1954 (a post which his father and grandfather had held before him) he was outstanding. In 1963 he became Treasurer, but had to his great regret to resign next year on becoming Lord-Lieutenant of Worcestershire. For some years he acted as chairman of the committee of the Free Foresters; he was Captain of the Butterflies from 1951 to 1976 and had been Governor of I Zingari since 1956. Moreover he still managed to have an occasional country-house match on his own ground at Hagley, where among the visitors were I Zingari and the London New Zealand Cricket Club. His death is a grievous loss not only to the cricket world, but to the public life of the country. Six days before he died, he was present at the Worcestershire C.C.C. annual meeting where he was extremely gratified at being elected President, a post that was also held by his father and grandfather.\n\nCOLLARD, ALAN, who died on March 17 aged 68, was honorary treasurer of Derbyshire County Cricket Club from 1971 and from 1974 to 1976 a member of the management of the National Cricket Association. In the late 1940's he played for Derbyshire 2nd XI and captained the side for two years. A keen footballer, he was secretary of Derby County F.C. for a short time from 1969.\n\nCOLQUHOUN, JAMES CLIFTON, M.B.E., who died in hospital in London on February 9, aged 83, was in the Glenalmond XI from 1909 to 1912, being Captain in his last year and played for G.J.V. Weigall's XI v. Oxford University in 1914. That year he played throughout the season for Kent II and met with fair success as an opening bat, scoring 80 against Monmouthshire and 52 against Surrey II at The Oval. Later he played occasionally for Cornwall.\n\nCURLE, GERLAD, died at Budleigh Salterton on March 4, aged 83. He was in the XI at King Edward's, Birmingham, and in 1913 had a trial for Warwickshire as a batsman, his highest score being 34 against Sussex. His younger brother, A. C. Curle, also appeared for the county.\n\nDAVIS, BRIAN HENRY STEVENS, who died on February 2, aged 68, was in the Lancing XI in 1926 as a batsman and later (as Stevens-Davis) played for several seasons for Buckinghamshire.\n\nEAGAR, EDWARD DESMOND RUSSELL, who died suddenly on holiday in Devon on September 13, aged 59, will always be remembered for his services to Hampshire cricket. He started as Captain and joint-Secretary in 1946, and remained Captain to the end of 1957 and Secretary until his death. A good attacking batsman and a fine field, especially at short-leg, he was an inspiring captain and there can be no doubt that the seed sown under him had much to do with the county winning the championship for the first time in 1961. As Secretary he worked tirelessly, even after a serious operation early last summer, and did much to increase the membership and to place the finances on a sound basis.\n\nHe was in the Cheltenham XI from 1933 to 1936 and Captain of it for two seasons and while there, apart from his batting, met with considerable success as a slow left-hand bowler. From 1935 to 1939 he played a number of times for Gloucestershire. Having gone up to Oxford, he was twelfth man at Lord's in 1938 and having made over 600 runs for the University, was distinctly unlucky to miss his blue. He got it in 1939, when he headed the averages and was clearly the most dangerous, if not the soundest, bat in the side.\n\nIn all first-class cricket he scored 12,178 runs with an average of 21.86 and made ten centuries, the highest being 158 not out for Hampshire v. Oxford University in 1954. In 1958-59 he was Assistant Manager of the M.C.C. side in Australia. A considerable authority on cricket history and bibliography, he wrote much and well for E. W. Swanton's World of Cricket and was one of the joint-authors of the official history of Hampshire County Cricket. At Oxford he also had a blue for hockey and, had the war not intervened, might well have got an international. Later he was hockey correspondent of the Sunday Telegraph. His son, Patrick, has made a great reputation as a cricket photographer.\n\nFAGG, ARTHUR EDWARD., died at Tunbridge Wells on September 13, aged 62. Although in a career which extended from 1932 to 1957 he scored 27,291 runs with an average of 36.05, made 58 centuries and played five times for England, it cannot be said that he ever fulfilled expectations. In the middle thirties Sutcliffe was dropping out of Test cricket and England was looking for a new opening pair. Fagg and Hutton were at once recognised as obvious candidates and Fagg, a year the senior and by some considered the better prospect, got the first chance, playing in two Tests v. India in 1936 and being picked for the Australian tour that autumn. Halfway through the tour he was invalided home with rheumatic fever, a great setback to his career, and he missed the entire season of 1937. Naturally, in 1938 the selectors were cautious about playing him and, though he had a splendid season, it was not until the final Test that they picked him and then he was one of those left out.\n\nThat his health was not fully trustworthy was shown when he refused an invitation for the South African tour that winter. In 1939 he played in one Test v. West Indies. Unfit for the Services during the War, he went as coach to Cheltenham and, when first-class cricket was resumed in 1946, felt so doubtful whether he could stand the strain that he decided to stay there.\n\nIn 1947 Kent persuaded him to return, but already at 32, he was moving like a veteran, Hutton and Washbrook were established as England's opening pair and his days of Test cricket were clearly over. Still, for ten years more he did splendid work for Kent and no-one watching him could fail to see that he was far more than a good county bat. Very sound, he had strokes all round the wicket and, being a fine hooker, was particularly severe on fast bowling. Against spin he was less impressive.\n\nOne record which he holds may well never be equalled. In 1938 against Essex at Colchester, he scored 244 and 202 not out, the second innings taking only 170 minutes. His fielding was never on a par with his batting and after his early years, it was difficult to place him anywhere save in the slips, where he held his share of catches without being outstanding. In the Second XI he had been trained to keep wicket and was good enough to keep on a few occasions for the county when neither Ames nor Levett was available.\n\nFrom 1959 to his death he was one of the First-Class umpires and from 1967 to 1976, when he retired for reasons of health, was on the panel of Test-Match umpires. His long tenure of this appointment is sufficient testimony to the respect in which he was held and, when at Birmingham in 1973 he threatened to withdraw after the second day because of the behaviour of some of the West Indian side who had disagreed with one of his decisions, he could be sure of public sympathy. He did not indeed appear on the field on the third morning until the second over, Alan Oakman, the Warwickshire coach, having stood during the first.\n\nFOSTER, RONALD ARTHUR CHARTERIS, who died in the South of France, on June 22, aged 82, was in the Eton XI in 1913 and 1914. Primarily a bowler, he was also a useful batsman in the tail. In 1914 coming in ninth he helped to add 76 for the ninth wicket against Winchester and took five for 75 in the second innings, while at Lord's he finished off the Harrow second innings quickly by taking four for 16 and thus played a considerable part in Eton winning by four wickets after being 86 behind on the first innings.\n\nFOWLER, ARCHIBALD JOHN BURGESS, who died on May 7 in London, aged 86, had many trials for Middlesex as a slow left-hander between 1921 and 1931 and received his County Cap. He never quite made his place secure, but must have been fairly near it in 1924 when he took five for 29 against Lancashire, then a very strong side. Later in the mid-thirties he succeeded George Fenner as head coach at Lord's. Those of us who regard Fenner as one of the finest coaches we have ever known realise what it means that Fowler was in his turn regarded as outstanding. He constantly umpired at Lord's and finally for many years acted as scorer, his connection with the ground extending in all for over half a century. He was a Life Member of the Middlesex County Cricket Club.\n\nGALE, DEREK, who made a few appearances for Dorset as a fast bowler, died on September 10 at the age of 46.\n\nGRAINGER, GEORGE, died in hospital at Chesterfield on August 17 in his 90th year, having been born on November 11, 1887 at Morton. A left hand batsman and bowler, he played for Derbyshire in 1909, 1910 and 1921 in a total of five matches.\n\nGRANT, ROLPH STEWART, who died on October 18, aged 67, was the younger of two brothers, both Cambridge blues, to captain the West Indies. Not a distinguished player at Cambridge, he owed his selection for one of the last places in 1933 largely to his superb fielding: he was a soccer blue and an Amateur International goalkeeper. But he was also a useful bat in the lower half of the order and a useful bowler of slow off-spin round the wicket and fully justified his place. He dismissed three of the first four Oxford batsmen for 44 runs and made an astonishing catch at short leg to get rid of F. G. H. Chalk, a very dangerous player. Returning to the West Indies, he played in the Tests against the M.C.C. side in 1934-35 and in the fourth made his highest Test score, 77. Appointed captain of the West Indian side in England in 1939 and faced by mid-June with the awkward problem of finding an opening partner for J. B. Stollmeyer, he solved it with characteristic courage by going in first himself and continued to do so until the end of the tour with very fair success. Against Lancashire he made 95, his highest score of the season, but certainly his best innings was in the Old Trafford Test when, opening after England had declared at 164 for seven on a wicket which was not easy and was likely to become rapidly more difficult, he scored 47 out of 56 in thirty-eight minutes including three 6's off Goddard. When he was out the whole crowd rose to him, a tribute seldom paid to so short an innings. Earlier that day he had taken the wickets of Hutton and Hardstaff for 16 runs. Though he was obviously short of the experience which most Test captains have, he proved himself in other ways an admirable leader.\n\nHAMMOND, ERNEST ROBERT ( WALLY), who died in Kimberley on February 13, after a long illness at the age of 65, was the second serious loss to cricket administration in South Africa in just over a month, the President of the S.A.C.A., W. C. B. Woodin, having died in office on January 11. Just as Billy Woodin had had a long association with Eastern Province cricket, so Wally Hammond was the pillar of cricket in Griqualand West. He was Chairman of the Griqualand West Cricket Union for more than 30 years.\n\nHARE, STERICKER NORMAN, C.B.E., who died at Meadle, near Aylesbury, on September 30, aged 77, played in three matches for Essex in 1921. In his first innings for the county against Derbyshire at Leyton, batting at number ten, he scored 98 and helped J. W. H. T. Douglas to add 251 for the ninth wicket. Captain of Chigwell in 1918, he played club cricket for Ilford.\n\nHEY, SAMUEL, who died suddenly on September 16, had been for almost twenty years Secretary of the Dorset County Cricket Club. A batsman with a sound defence, he was in the Uppingham XI from 1921 to 1923, heading the batting averages in the last two years and being Captain in 1923, when he represented the Rest at Lord's. He never got enough runs however in the trials at Cambridge to be in the running for a blue.\n\nHOMER, HERBERT WESLEY, who died on February 10, aged 81 was for years between the Wars one of the mainstays of the Staffordshire batting and at one time captained the side. He had also played for the Minor Counties. Later he served for twenty-five years on the Warwickshire Committee.\n\nHYNES, SIR LINCOLN CARRUTHERS, died during the year at the age of 65. As a fast left-hander he did useful work for New South Wales in the 1930s. His proudest moment was when he had Bradman caught at leg-slip for 0. He was knighted in 1971 in recognition of his work for broadcasting, charities and hospitals.\n\nJOHNSON, JOSEPH LEONARD, who died in Ipswich on April 20, aged 57, came out for Queensland after the war and continued to be one of the mainstays of their bowling until 1953, by which time he had taken 171 wickets in Sheffield Shield matches. He was a useful tail-end hitter. A fast-medium right-hander, analyses of six for 83 against the Indian side in Australia and seven for 114 against South Australia, secured him a place in the last Test in 1947-48. As he took six for 74 in the two innings and made 25 not out, he must have been in the running for a place in the 1948 side to England. In the event this was his sole appearance for Australia.\n\nKING, DONALD, who died in hospital in Toronto on October 2, aged 59, was the man to whom in recent years Canadian Cricket owed more than to any other. He re-established the Canadian Cricket Association and was its Secretary for over twenty years, was Canada's delegate to the I.C.C. from 1972 to 1975, and had rightly been elected an Honorary Member of the M.C.C. He wrote on Canadian cricket for many years in Wisden.\n\nLETTS, PHILIP EDWARD, who died at Baschurch, near Shrewsbury on March 14, aged 64, had played occasionally for Berkshire. A useful all-rounder, Captain of the Christ's Hospital XI in 1929 and 1930, he was for years a master at Wellington.\n\nLOUGHERY, WILLIAM GORDON RIDLEY, who died in hospital on August 1, aged 69, played for Ireland against Scotland as a batsman in 1929 and 1933. For many years he was a master at Rugby, where he ran the cricket.\n\nMcCARTHY, BRIG. CHARLES HENRY FLORENCE D'ARCY, O.B.E., died in Nassau, Bahamas, on July 24, aged 78. A sound bat, a good field and a useful leg-spinner, he was in the Rugby XI from 1915 to 1917, and in his last two years represented the Lord's Schools. Later he played occasionally for Devon.\n\nMASTERMAN, SIR JOHN CECIL, sometime Provost of Worcester and Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, died in an Oxford nursing home on June 6, aged 86. A man of distinction in many walks of life, he was a remarkable games player, who had played hockey and lawn tennis for England, won the high jump in the University sports and reached a high standard at cricket, golf and squash. Cricket, he wrote, was my first and most enduring passion and, though never near a blue at Oxford, he became a formidable club player, good enough to be elected a Harlequin many years after he went down and to play for both Harlequins and Free Foresters against the University, to do valuable work for Oxfordshire from 1922 to 1925 and to be a member of the M.C.C. side to Canada in 1937. He was a sound left-handed bat and, being a good fighter, one whom one was always glad to have on one's side when things were not going well, and a right-hand medium pace bowler with a rather low and clumsy action, but very steady and reliable. For many years he was on the committee of both I Zingari and Free Foresters. He enjoyed writing on the game and did so delightfully, but a busy life left him little time for this. His novel, Fate Cannot Harm Me, contains one of the best descriptions extant of a country house match and there is an interesting chapter on cricket in his autobiography, On the Chariot Wheel. Besides these there is a sketch of W. E. W. Collins in Bits and Pieces and a fascinating article contributed to Blackwood in June 1974 on that remarkable character, Captain E. G. Wynyard.\n\nMATTHEWS, AUSTIN DAVID GEORGE, who died in hospital on July 29, aged 72, had a career which was almost unique. Born at Penarth and educated at St. David's, Lampeter, he played for Northamptonshire from 1927 to 1936 and at that time was merely a useful member of one of the weakest county sides, who could not on his performances have kept his place for a leading county. His 567 wickets had cost him 26.45 runs each and he had made a couple of centuries. In 1937 he went to coach cricket and rugby at Stowe and threw in his lot with Glamorgan, making his first appearance at the end of July.\n\nIn little more than a fortnight his bowling had created such an impression, particularly at Hastings, where on a perfect wicket he had taken fourteen for 132, that he was picked for the final test at The Oval against New Zealand. Here, on an unresponsive pitch, he bowled respectably and by no means disgraced himself, but met with little success. He continued to play for Glamorgan until 1947 and his 225 wickets for them cost only 15.88 apiece, an astonishing contrast to his figures for Northamptonshire. In 1946 he took in all 93 at 14.29. For a short time after the war he was the county's Assistant Secretary.\n\nA tall man, who bowled fast-medium with a high action, he was accurate and had the cardinal merits of keeping the ball on the wicket and making it run away. He was also a useful bat in the lower part of the order, and hit two first-class hundreds, both for Northamptonshire, in 1929 and 1934.\n\nBetween 1934-50 he coached Cambridge University. Apart from his cricket he was a first class rugby forward; he captained Northampton R.F.U. club, also played for East Midlands and Penarth and gained a Final Welsh Trial Cap. He refereed the first Combined Oxford and Cambridge R.U. Tour to Argentina in 1948 and was also a Welsh Table Tennis International. He had strong views on the subject of coaching and in Wisden 1966 wrote Cricket a Game--Not a Subject.\n\nMELLUISH, GORDON CHRISTOPHER, who died on April 14, aged 70, had a few trials for Essex as a slow left-hander in 1926. For years he was well known in club cricket in the south-east and during the war appeared for Northamptonshire.\n\nMERRITT, WILLIAM E., died at Christchurch, New Zealand, on June 9, aged 68. A leg-break and googly bowler, he was under nineteen when picked for the first New Zealand team to England in 1927 and had played only four first-class matches. The experiment was a triumphant success. In a weak bowling side, he was by far the most successful bowler, taking in first-class matches 107 wickets at 23.64 and in all matches 169 at 19.54, figures which would obviously have been better had he had more help. He never fulfilled this early promise. Against A. H. H. Gilligan's side in New Zealand in 1929-30 his eight wickets in the Tests cost over 50 runs each and in England in 1931 his 99 wickets averaged 26.48 and he was again a complete failure in the Tests. However, it was on this tour that he accomplished the best performance of his career, taking seven for 28 in the second innings against a strong M.C.C. side at Lord's and securing an innings victory.\n\nAfter that season he went into League cricket, and from 1938 to 1946 played for Northamptonshire. Here he suffered from dropped catches and his bowling was expensive, but he supplemented it by many useful hard-hitting innings, the highest of them 87 in fifty-seven minutes against Sussex at Kettering in 1939. As a bowler, when hit he tended to try to spin the ball more and his length naturally suffered. At times too he was inclined to bowl the googly too much in preference to the more dangerous leg-break. In 1946 owing to a League engagement, he played in mid-week matches only and after that season left first-class cricket, but continued to play in the League as well as being in business in Dudley. He returned to New Zealand in 1966.\n\nNASH, JOHN HENRY, the former secretary of Yorkshire County Cricket club died suddenly after a heart attack at his home in Pudsey, on April 7. He was 71. Mr. Nash retired in 1971 after 40 years as secretary of Yorkshire and another nine on the clerical staff of the club. He became one of the most respected figures in cricket, making a host of friends throughout the world. He joined Yorkshire in 1922 and in his time as secretary he rarely saw a full day's cricket because of the complexity of administrative duties, but his efficiency became a by-word. He was joint-manager with Brigadier M. A. Green of the M.C.C. team captained by F. R. Brown that toured Australia and New Zealand in 1950-51.\n\nApart from cricket Mr. Nash led a full life. He was an organist of great ability, playing for many years at Farsley Parish Church where he was also secretary of the Church Council.\n\nNUPEN, EIULF PETER, always known as Buster, died in Johannesburg, his native place, on January 29, aged 75. Although in a Test Match career for South Africa which extended from 1921 to 1935, his fifty wickets cost him 35.76 runs each, he was regarded at his best as one of the greatest bowlers on a mat there has ever been. So ineffective however was he on turf that when the M.C.C. were in South Africa in 1930-31, although in the first Test he took eleven for 150 and in the second innings of the fourth, when admittedly the English batsmen were hitting recklessly in a vain endeavour to force a win, six for 46, he was omitted from the third and fifth Tests, the first two ever to be played on grass in South Africa.\n\nSimilarly in this country in 1924, when, after his record at home, he was expected to be one of the main match-winners, he was a complete failure. It is true that he was handicapped by injury, but the general impression was that, even when fit, he was not formidable. He never toured abroad again. What he could do in his own country was shown against the Hon. L. H. Tennyson's unofficial side in 1924-25, which was at least a strong England A side: in four Representative matches he took 37 wickets at 11.45.\n\nIn Currie Cup matches Nupen had the extraordinary record for the Transvaal of 184 wickets at 12.75. In nine of his twenty-eight matches for them he took over ten wickets and against Griqualand West in 1931-32 took nine for 48 in an innings and sixteen for 136 in the match. He first attracted attention by taking six for 89 for the Transvaal against the great Australian side of 1921. Handicapped by having lost an eye at the age of four, he was not normally regarded as a serious batsman. However in the third Test against England in 1927-28, he made 51 and 69, he and his captain, H. G. Deane, putting on 95 for the eighth wicket in the first innings and 123 for the seventh in the second.\n\nTall and strongly built, he bowled fast-medium right-hand round the wicket and on the mat his off-break spun prodigiously, came off very quick and lifted sharply. The leg-cutter, with which he varied it, was more obvious and less accurate than George Geary's, but none the less got many wickets.\n\nWhen England were in South Africa in 1930-31, Deane, a great captain, had retired, and though, under pressure, he reappeared, did not feel himself in good enough practice for the first Test. Nupen captained the side admirably, besides achieving his biggest performance in Tests. Deane captained in the next two matches and then resigned, being dissatisfied with his form, and for the fourth the job was given to Cameron, doubtless because it was felt that Nupen would not be required for the fifth on a grass wicket.\n\nOLIVER, CHARLES JOSHUA, the New Zealand cricketer and Rugby footballer, died at Brisbane after a very short illness on September 25, aged 71. A Canterbury man, he became one of his country's most famous sportsmen. As a cricketer he toured Australia twice and England once in the mid- 1920s. Then his rugby took precedence. He played at home for New Zealand in 1928, toured Australia with the teams of 1929 and 1934 and was vice-captain and star player of the 1935 All Blacks in Britain. He was a strong running and imaginative centre threequarter. Eventually he and his family went to live in Australia.\n\nPAYNE, ALAN UNDY, died suddenly in hospital on August 16, aged 74. Going up to Cambridge from St. Edmund's, Canterbury, he got a blue in 1925, his last year, a selection widely criticised at the time. His batting average for the University was 10.75, with a highest score of 27 not out, and his sixteen overs had produced one wicket. Moreover, he was preferred to two batsmen, one an old blue, who were established County players. The criticism was not silenced by the match at Lord's where he went in ninth, making 4, and in an Oxford innings of 350 did not bowl. Cambridge that year had a very strong batting side and four good medium-pace bowlers: the great need was for a slow spinner, but there was none, so the captain decided to leave the spin to Duleepsinhji and play a really good fielder. In fact Payne was a good all-rounder, who might well have made 30 or 40 valuable runs and taken two or three wickets, given the chance. For several seasons he did good work for Buckinghamshire at a time when they were always near the top of the Minor Counties. In 1924 he took 32 wickets for them at 10.84 and in 1925, a fortnight after the' Varsity match, had seven for 15 v. Kent II. He bowled just on the quick side of medium and made the ball move from the off and sometimes keep low, and he was a good, natural, practical batsman. After coming down he went as a master to his old school and thence to Felsted, where he remained for many years and was much loved. He was also a first-class hockey player.\n\nPERKS, REGINALD THOMAS DAVID, who died on November 22, aged 66, was by many good judges considered an under-estimated bowler. In 1939 he had played twice for England, in the notorious timeless Test at Durban and against the West Indies at The Oval, and had performed respectably without meeting with spectacular success. He was then twenty-eight. When cricket was resumed he was thirty-five and had missed the years when a bowler of his type would naturally be in his prime. Now he was perhaps just past it and had moreover Bedser to compete with.\n\nA tall man who made full use of his height, he bowled fast-medium right-hand, swinging the ball both ways, and was very steady, a great trier, endlessly cheerful and quite tireless. A left-handed bat, he started as a poor player but made himself into a useful tail-end hitter. Born at Hereford, he first appeared for Worcestershire in 1930 and his first victim was Jack Hobbs. By 1931 he had made a sufficient reputation to be picked for the Players at Lord's. He continued to play for the county until 1955 and, when he retired, had taken more wickets for them than any other bowler, 2,143 at an average of 23.73. In all first-class cricket his tally was 2,233 and in sixteen consecutive seasons he had taken over 100 wickets.\n\nThe respect in which he was held was shown when in his last season he was appointed the first professional captain of Worcestershire. Later he was a valuable and outspoken member of the Committee. He had no warmer admirer than his old county captain, Lord Cobham, who only a couple of months before his own unexpected death, hearing of Perks's illness, drove at once twenty-five miles through the snow to visit him.\n\nPerks twice performed the hat-trick--against Kent at Stourbridge in 1931, and against Warwickshire at Edgbaston in 1933 and twice he took nine wickets in an innings--against Glamorgan at Stourbridge, 1939 and against Gloucestershire at Cheltenham, 1946.\n\nPHILLIPPS, JOHN HUGH, C.B.E., who died on June 8, aged 79, was Manager of the New Zealand teams to England in 1949 and 1958 and of the M.C.C. side in New Zealand in 1960-61. A man universally loved and respected, he was a tremendous success on all these tours.\n\nPRATT, RONALD C. E., who died on June 1, aged 49, played for Surrey from 1952 to 1959. A tall left-handed batsman who played in spectacles, he could never get an assured place in the very strong side of those days and finally left to take a job in insurance. His best performances were 90 against Kent at The Oval in 1953, when he and Clark put on 250 in four hours for the fourth wicket, and 120 against Cambridge University at Guildford in 1956, on which occasion he helped Stewart to add 255. A fine slip, he caught six catches against Sussex at Hastings in 1956. His brother, D. E. Pratt, also played for the County.\n\nRATTIGAN, SIR TERENCE MERVYN, C.B.E., the famous play-writer, who died in Bermuda on November 30, aged 66, was, like his father and his uncle, in the Harrow XI. He won his place in 1929 as an opening bat, but next year though he played in the XI was not in the side at Lord's. He was an elegant stroke player, but unsound.\n\nREID, ALEXANDER, BERNARD JOHN, died suddenly in Cape Town on March 7, at the age of 61. He was a fairly regular choice as wicket-keeper for Western Province in the first five years after the war and also a useful tail end batsman. His highest score was 81 against North-Eastern Transvaal in 1939-40 but his batting is chiefly remembered for his defiance of Ray Lindwall during the Australian tour of 1949-50.\n\nROBERTS, CHRISTOPHER PAUL, was killed by a fall when climbing in Borrowdale on June 9, aged 25. Born at Cleethorpes, he played a few times for Lincolnshire in 1971 and 1972 and once for Worcestershire in 1974. He was a right-hand batsman and a medium-pace bowler.\n\nROMER, LT.-COL. MALCOLM NIGEL, M.B.E., who died suddenly in the Westminster Hospital on June 3, aged 62, was Assistant Secretary at The Oval from 1960 to 1972. He was not in the XI at Eton, but was a member of I Zingari and Free Foresters.\n\nRYDER, JACK, who died at the age of 87 on April 3, had been taken ill two days after the Centenary Test, at which he was the oldest ex-player present. Much though he accomplished, his career was a trifle disappointing. Competing with a number of great players, he was merely a good one, whose place was never quite secure and who fell below the incredibly high standards of his contemporaries in fielding. In his first season for Victoria, 1912-13, he took thirty wickets at 15.40 and it seemed that a new star had arisen. He also had a batting average of 33. Bowling fastish right-hand, he ran the ball away and could also make it lift. In the next season his wickets cost more, but he did one outstanding all-round performance, taking seven for 88 in the first innings against South Australia and scoring 36 not out and 105. In 1914-15 his batting average rose to 85, but his eight wickets cost him 28.62 runs each.\n\nWhen cricket was resumed after the war, it was clear that his bowling promise was not going to be fulfilled. Thenceforward, he was only a change, used on his tours in England to relieve the leading bowlers in the lesser matches: in Tests against England his thirteen wickets cost 48.66 apiece. Nevertheless he played in all five Tests against Douglas's side in 1920-21, though his highest score was only 52 not out and his average 18.85. Doubtless his innings of 54 and 105 in the second match for Victoria against the Englishmen kept him his place in the last two Tests. But it must have been a disappointment when in England that summer he did not get a place in a single Test.\n\nAgainst Arthur Gilligan's side in 1924-25 a bad back put him out of consideration for the first twoTests, but in the third, coming in at 119 for six, he made 201 in six and a half hours, a remarkable effort of concentration for one who was primarily an attacker, and followed it with 88 in the second innings. In fairness it must be said that the English bowling was gravely depleted: Tate, Gilligan and later Freeman were off the field and Woolley was handicapped by a weak knee. Freeman, as tough a little man as ever stepped on to a cricket field, fainted with pain when one of Ryder's on-drives which he was attempting to catch hit him on the wrist.\n\nIn England in 1926 Ryder was again a disappointment: he had a respectable record for the whole tour, but did little in the Tests. Nevertheless in 1928-29 he was made captain against Chapman's side. Few men can have had a more difficult assignment. Collins, Bardsley, MacArtney, Taylor and Mailey had retired, Arthur Richardson was in England and Gregory and Kelleway broke down in the first Test and played no more. Under the circumstances the surprise was not that Australia should lose the series 4-1 to a strong side, but that they should recover so quickly as to regain the Ashes in England in 1930. For their failure in Australia no blame could attach to Ryder. He simply had not the material nor was he well served by the Selectors: he himself made 492 runs with an average of 54.66, including a century in the third Test. After this considerable surprise and some resentment was caused when he was omitted from the 1930 team for England. No doubt his co-selectors (he was himself now a Selector) felt that, if he went, he must be captain and that for that Woodfull was the better choice.\n\nRyder continued to play for Victoria until 1931-32, captained an unofficial Australian side on a tour of India in 1935-36 and was a Selector again from 1946 to 1970. He also did much to help young players. Standing over six foot, he was almost entirely a front-of-the-wicket player with an immensely powerful drive. He was certainly more effective in Australia than in England. His highest score was 295 against New South Wales in 1926 when Victoria compiled the record total of 1,107.\n\nSATHASIVAM, MAHADEVAN, the most gifted and stylish batsman of Sri Lanka, died of a heart attack at the age of 62 in Colombo. He made a style of his own and his stroke-play had perfect poise and power. Against Madras for Ceylon at the Chepauk Grounds, Madras, in 1947, he scored 215, a ground record until eclipsed by Joe Hardstaff (jnr.) of Nottinghamshire fame several years later. Against Lal Amarnath's Indian team of 1945, he played a stylish innings of 111 at the Colombo Oval. Against the 1950 Commonwealth side led by L. Livingston, he made 98 at the Colombo Oval for Ceylon. He held the unique distinction of having captained three countries in cricket against visiting English and Australian teams-- Sri Lanka, Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nSHAPCOTT, AIR-COMMODORE MORTON SWAN, C.B.E., who died in hospital on April 15, aged 75, did useful work as a batsman for Alleyn's School, Dulwich and between the Wars first for Surrey II and then for some years for the R.A.F.\n\nSHARP, GEN. SIR JOHN AUBREY TAYLOR, K.C.B., M.C., died suddenly in Oslo on January 15, aged 59. A son of the former Leicestershire captain, A. T. Sharp, he was in the Repton XI as a batsman in 1936 and between 1937 and 1946 played occasionally for Leicestershire. For Cambridge University v. Essex in 1939 he made top score, 36, in the first innings, but failed to get his blue.\n\nSMITH, HORACE CLITHEROE, I.S.O., O.B.E., died at Hobart on April 6, aged 84. A former member of the Tasmanian side and for years Chairman of the Tasmanian Cricket Association, he had just lived to see Tasmania admitted to the Sheffield Shield. He was for some fifty years a member of the Australian Board of Control and was Manager of the Australian side to New Zealand in 1960.\n\nSOLAN, JOHN MARTIN, who died in Solihull Hospital on February 25, aged 66, was a noted reporter, sportswriter and supreme essayist. He entered journalism at the age of 17 in his home town of Leamington and when he retired in 1975 he had been with the Birmingham Post for 28 years. John Solan was a gentle man who plied a gentle pen and the craft of journalism was sometimes an art under his delicate touch. He was a familiar figure as he travelled the country covering Warwickshire and the Test Matches.\n\nPaying tribute to John Solan, Mr. Leslie Deakins, for many years secretary of Warwickshire C.C.C., wrote: He had the facility to write on any subject. It was always pleasant to meet him and there was anticipated enjoyment as he moved towards one, say, on a summer morning at Edgbaston. His ambling gait, his not-too-neatly-rolled umbrella indicated clearly that he was the traditional rather than the sophisticated type of Englishman.\n\nJohn Solan reported on Warwickshire for some years for Wisden and in the 1963 Centenary edition his article Through the Crystal Ball looked at cricket through the next 100 years.\n\nSTUDD, SIR, KYNASTON, 3rd BART., who died suddenly on May 27, aged 50, was a member of one of the most famous cricket families. A fast-medium bowler, he headed the Winchester bowling averages in 1944.\n\nSUMMERS, LEONARD SHELTON HEATH, who died on February 26, was one of the best players in London club cricket between the wars. An opening batsman and a leg-break bowler, he had an outstanding record at Emanuel School, Wandsworth, and was for years one of the mainstays of Dulwich, for whom he scored a thousand runs eight times, six times took a hundred wickets and twice took all ten wickets in an innings. He also played frequently for Surrey II and for the Club Cricket Conference.\n\nTAYLOR, CLIVE, the noted cricket writer, died in hospital at Weymouth on April 18, aged 50. He was at the peak of his career and had toured with every major M.C.C. team in the past nineteen years. Formerly with the Morning Advertiser and Hayter's Agency, he had been with The Sun since it started, but having reported the M.C.C. tour in India and Sri Lanka he was unwell when he arrived in Australia for the Centenary Test. Tributes:\n\nRichie Benaud-- I have lost a close personal friend which is shattering. He loved cricket without being carried away by its shortcomings.\n\nD. B. Carr-- His integrity was above reproach. Everything he did was in the best interests of cricket.\n\nJohn Woodcock (The Times)-- He could have written with equal distinction for any newspaper in the world, and on a whole range of subjects. That he chose cricket was cricket's good fortune.\n\nTHURSBY, WILLIAM PIERS, who died at Sandwich on June 3, after a long illness, aged 72, was a useful bat in the Eton XI in 1922 and 1923. In 1923 he made 57 at Lord's and helped E. W. Dawson to put up 111 for the first wicket.\n\nTUDOR, BRIG. CLAUD LECHMERE ST. JOHN, C.B.E., M.C., died at Halton, Oxford, on August 3, aged 88. Educated at Eastbourne College, he played a few times for Sussex in 1910 and 1911 and in his second match made 116 against Oxford. He was the last survivor of the match in which Alletson played his famous innings at Hove in 1911. Later he played for and captained the Army. His younger brother also played for Sussex: they were cousins of another Sussex cricketer, Lt.-Col. G. S. Grimston, who was later the county's Secretary.\n\nVAUGHAN, INSTRUCTOR-COMMANDER DOUGLAS BRIAN, who died in April aged 52, played for Devon in 1956 and had also represented the Navy. He was better known as an England Rugby forward and Selector.\n\nWEIGALL, ANTONY, who died at Sutton, Surrey, on July 3, aged 74, founded in November, 1945, The Society of Cricket Statisticians, which three years later became The Cricket Society. For years he took an active part in its running and contributed articles both to its Journal and to The Cricketer. He was a cousin of G. J. V. Weigall.\n\nWHITE, BRIG. GILBERT WILLIAM, died in Dominica on October 14, aged 65. A good stroke-playing batsman, a fine field and a moderate change bowler, he was in the Winchester XI from 1929 to 1931 and in his last year headed the batting averages. His father, Brig.-Gen. W. N. White, had played with considerable success for Hampshire.\n\nWIGGINTON, SEARSON HARRY, who died in Bulawayo on September 15, aged 68, played for Leicestershire from 1930 to 1934. Educated at Wyggeston School, he was by 1934 showing distinct promise as a bat and in August that year made 120 not out against Worcestershire at Leicester, his only century for the county. At the end of the season he left them for a job at Paisley and then, after being for a time coach at Taunton School, went in 1947-48 to be coach to the Rhodesian Cricket Association.\n\nWILD, HAROLD, a right-hand batsman and bowler, died at Glossop on August 8, aged 86, having been born at Hadfield on February 3, 1891. He joined the Derbyshire staff in 1913 and played in 32 matches up to the end of the 1920 season. His highest score was 68 against Warwickshire at Edgbaston in 1919.\n\nWILLIAMS, BRIG. EDWARD STEPHEN BRUCE, C.B.E., died on January 20, aged 84. A member of the Winchester XI in 1909 and 1910, he later captained the Army, of which he was for many years one of the leading batsmen. In 1925 he scored 209 for them against Oxford University. He played occasionally for Devon.\n\nWILSON, ARTHUR KEITH, who died at his home in Brighton on November 8, aged 83, played for Sussex from 1914 to 1934. A member of the Brighton College XI in 1911, in his first innings for the county he made 78 not out v. Northamptonshire: in his last match, after an absence of nine years from the side, he scored 69 v. Kent. In 1919 he made his only century, 134 v. Northamptonshire. A good bat and an especially skilful cutter, he took hundreds of wickets in minor cricket with slow flighted leg-breaks, which were particularly formidable to schoolboys. Indeed, one cricket master installed a bowling machine specifically to teach his pupils to play Keith Wilson. For a time he was Chairman of the County Cricket Club and during the Second War did wonderful work in keeping cricket going on the County ground.\n\nWOODIN, WILLIAM CYRIL BLAZON (BILLY), the President of the South African Cricket Association, collapsed and died in Johannesburg on January 11, 1977 at the age of 64. As President, he was a member of the nine-man motivating committee which was charged with the introduction of so-called normal cricket in South Africa and worked tirelessly towards this goal. He had the satisfaction of seeing very considerable progress made during his last year and the complete realisation of the committee's objects a probability within the foreseeable future.\n\nWORSLEY, THOMAS CUTHBERT, who died on February 23, aged 69, kept wicket for Marlborough for three years and had a trial for Cambridge in 1928, but, though the University were hard pressed to fill the position that year, he did not get a blue. He became well-known as an author and journalist.\n\nOBITUARY BEFORE 1977\n\nADAMS, DONALD, who died at Walton-on-Thames early in 1976 aged 95, had the distinction, curious though not unique, of obtaining his only wicket in first-class cricket by bowling W. G. Grace. This he did when, on the strength of some good bowling in the Surrey trial match in April 1902, he played a few days later for the county against London County at the Crystal Palace, opening the bowling and going in last. This was his sole appearance in first-class cricket, but he continued to play in London club cricket until well on in the 1930s.\n\nBEDFORD, EDWARD HENRY RILANDS, died in hospital at Chelmsford on October 9, 1976, aged 73, having been born at Aston, Birmingham on June 7, 1903. He was a grandson of the Rev. W. K. R. Bedford, co-founder of the Free Foresters, and was Founder's Kin. Well known in the world of archery, he became a Woodman of Arden in 1924 and was Secretary of the Woodmen 1948-1975. He played in one match for Derbyshire in 1924--against Glamorgan at Derby.\n\nBLAXLAND, LIONEL BRUCE, died at Temple Ewell, Kent on April 29, 1976, aged 78. He was born at Shrewsbury on March 25, 1898, and was in the Shrewsbury XI from 1914 to 1916. He became a master at Repton in 1922, retiring in 1958, when he took holy orders and became rector of Tansley and later vicar of Doveridge, both in Derbyshire, his adopted county. Bill Blaxland was a fine club cricketer who hit hard and often, hooking anything short of a length with great power. As a bowler he was tireless, and always alert and sharp in the field. He first appeared for Derbyshire in 1925 and in his last match in 1947 he led the side against the South Africans at Derby when Ian Smith took six for 1. His best score was 64 against Warwickshire in 1933, but most of his cricket was with The Friars and other good club sides until his career came to an end when he lost an eye playing for The Cryptics in Portugal. He was in charge of cricket at Repton for eleven years, in two spells. Blaxland played at wing half for Oxford University in 1920-21 and also for The Corinthians. In 19 matches for Derbyshire he scored 483 runs.\n\nBOWLES, JOHN JESSE, who died at Salisbury in November, 1971, aged 81, played occasionally for Gloucestershire from 1911 to 1920 and more frequently for Worcestershire from 1926 to 1928. A slow left-hander, his most notable performance was to take nine for 72 in the match v. Sussex at Brighton in 1926.\n\nCURTIS, JOHN STAFFORD, who died on March 8, 1972, aged 84, played for Leicestershire intermittently from 1906 to 1921. An accurate medium-pace off-spinner and an attacking batsman, he would have been valuable had he played regularly, but he preferred league cricket and only in 1919 did he appear at all frequently. Analyses that year of five for 67 v. Lancashire and seven for 75 v. Nottinghamshire showed what he could do: in 1912 he had taken six for 32 v. Hampshire. His highest score was 66 v. Hampshire in 1911.\n\nDAVIES, ERIC QUAIL, who died at Port Alfred on November 11, 1976, aged 67, was perhaps a slightly unlucky cricketer. Picked for South Africa for the fourth Test against Australia in 1935-36 on the strength of having taken six for 80 for Eastern Province against them, he took four for 75 in an innings of 439, his victims including Fingleton, McCabe and Richardson, a notable performance which might have been a sensational one had his catches been held as they should. This ensured his place in the final Test, in which he was a failure. However, in 1938-39, playing for the Transvaal against the M.C.C., he felled Hutton with the third ball of the innings, which rolled from his head on to the wicket, and finished with six for 82. This got him a place in the first three Tests, but he was again a failure, his three wickets costing 352 runs. After the War he represented North Eastern Transavaal, but, as he was a schoolmaster, his opportunities for first-class cricket were limited and he never again played in a Test. A tall, athletic man, who swung the ball away, he was regarded as faster than R. J. Crisp, South Africa's regular fast bowler in the thirties.\n\nEVANS, VICTOR J., died at Barking on March 28, 1975, aged 63. He played for Essex as a medium-pace off-spinner from 1932 to 1937, without ever winning an assured place in the side. His best season was 1935 when his 56 wickets cost 25.42 runs each.\n\nGANLY, JAMES B., the former Irish cricketer, died in Dublin on July 16, 1976. He was 73. Educated at St. Columba's College, he gained his first cap on leaving school in 1921 and, in all, played 25 times, until 1937. A powerfully built right hand batsman, who also gained 12 Rugby caps for Ireland as a three-quarter, he was best known for his speed between the wickets in partnership with the late T. G. B. McVeagh. He captained Ireland eight times, leading them to victory against the West Indies in 1928, still the only time Ireland have recorded a first-class victory over a touring team. Jim Ganly, who was an auctioneer by profession, scored 831 runs for Ireland, average 19.78.\n\nHALL, CHARLES H., who died in December 1976, aged 70, had a number of trials for Yorkshire as a fast bowler between 1928 and 1934. When he and Bowes bowled out Leicestershire in 1932 for 72, Hall's share was five for 27.\n\nHARMAN, GEORGE RICHARD UNIACKE, who died in Devonshire in December 1975, shortly after his 100th birthday, played one first-class match, for Dublin University v. M.C.C. in 1895. He batted no. 11. Better known as Rugby player, he represented Ireland three times 1897-99, and was the longest lived International in the British Isles.\n\nJACKSON, DIRK CLOETE, who died on his farm near Pretoria on September 17, 1976, at the age of 91, was almost certainly the Senior first-class cricketer in South Africa measured by length of service. He made his debut for Western Province in 1908-09 and after playing for them for three seasons, he moved to the Transvaal for whom he made a couple of appearances in 1912-13. He had been the scrum-half in the first Springbok Rugby team to tour the United Kingdom in 1906 and was the last survivor of that team.\n\nKARUNARATNE, EDWIN, President of the Ceylon Cricket Association in 1934, who had captained Combined Galle teams against several touring sides, including Jardine's M.C.C. side in 1934, died on December 19, 1976, aged 90.\n\nKIRBY, HENRY RICHARD, who died at Mayfield on July 20, 1976, aged 87, was in the Malvern XI as a bat in 1908. Later he played for Sussex II and in 1910 scored 200 not out v. Essex II at Leyton, which stood as a record for the side until K. C. Wessels beat it in 1976. In 1911 he played for Sussex v. Cambridge University, but without success.\n\nPAYNE, CHARLES ARTHUR LYNCH, died in hospital in North Vancouver on March 21, 1976, aged 90. A member of the Charterhouse XI in 1903 and 1904, he first appeared in first-class cricket for M.C.C. v. Derbyshire at Lord's in 1905 and scored 101 in 110 minutes, following it a few days later with 52 for Middlesex v. Essex. He continued to play occasionally for Middlesex until 1909 and in 1906 and 1907 represented Oxford at Lord's. For Oxford his highest score was 78 against Sussex, though in 1907 in the first innings v. Cambridge he was top scorer with 38, but probably his most notable performance in first-class cricket was for Middlesex v. Kent at Tonbridge in 1906, when in a needle match he made 40 and 81, in the second innings putting on 182 with Sir Pelham Warner, who to the end of his life spoke highly of Payne's batting on that occasion. Joe Mounsey of Yorkshire, pro at Charterhouse from 1898 to 1926, always regarded Payne as the best batsman he ever taught there, although, like most Carthusians and unlike most Yorkshiremen, he was apt to give considerable encouragement to the slips. About 1910 he went out to Vancouver, where for years he did much to help and encourage young players, and in 1939 published a book entitled What matters in Batsmanship. He played billiards for Oxford in 1906 and 1907, was Amateur Billiards Champion of Canada in 1927 and 1928 and had been Amateur Golf Champion of British Columbia. A cousin of M. W. Payne, against whom he played in his two University matches, he was at the time of his death the oldest living Oxford cricket blue.\n\nGEORGE EMMETT\n\nMrs. J. McMurray, sister of the late George Emmett whose obituary appeared on page 1039 in the 1977 Wisden, points out that on his retirement as coach to Gloucestershire C.C.C. he was appointed General Secretary of the Imperial Athletic Club in Bristol, and that never at any time was he a groundsman.\n\n\u00a9 John Wisden & Co"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/03/geoff-hurst-heartache-1966-world-cup-donald-mcrae-interview", "page_content": "\u201cLife is such a lottery,\u201d Sir Geoff Hurst says as his face creases with emotion on a cold, sunlit morning full of moving revelations and surprising insights. Far beyond 1966, when he scored his famous hat-trick which helped England win the World Cup, Hurst considers a hard truth. \u201cWe lost our eldest daughter, Claire, to a brain tumour. How do you cope with that?\u201d\n\nThere is a pause as, at home in Cheltenham, Hurst looks down. He turns 80 on 8 December but strength and serenity allow him to peel away the mythology of \u201866 and show how his true self has been shaped by glory and tragedy, fame and normality. Hurst nods and looks up again. \u201cIt\u2019s something you have to cope with because life moves on.\u201d\n\nAs he enters his ninth decade he can reflect on good fortune and devastating loss with equanimity. Hurst reminds me that he did not play for England until the very year he became the first \u2013 and still only \u2013 footballer in history to score three goals in a men\u2019s World Cup final. During the tournament, it was only in the quarter-final that Hurst replaced the injured Jimmy Greaves, a footballer whom he revered when they were kids and young pros in Essex. Their lives changed in contrasting ways and he made the most of his unexpected opportunity and played 49 times for England, scoring 24 goals. Hurst also scored 210 goals in over 500 games for West Ham and Stoke City.\n\nHurst has always been more than a footballer. He tells me, wryly, about the one county cricket match he played for Essex, alongside the great Jim Laker, in 1962. \u201cIt was against Lancashire, in Aigburth in Liverpool, and I got nought and nought not out.\u201d\n\nHe managed Chelsea from 1979 to 1981, and tried to sign Johan Cruyff and Kevin Keegan before he was sacked. He was fleeced by conmen and ended up on the dole. Hurst kept going and built a new life in insurance. He laughs now at the small humiliations he suffered as a rookie door-to-door salesman derided by many as a lowly ex-footballer and doubted by others who could not believe \u201cthe\u201d Geoff Hurst sold insurance.\n\nMemories of his younger brother, Robert, who took his own life in 1974, returned again and again. And then, when Claire was diagnosed with cancer while pregnant, Geoff and his wife, Judith, cried together on their kitchen floor. But Claire lived another 10 years \u2013 until December 2010.\n\nEarly December, with this terrible anniversary and Christmas approaching, is always a time of tangled reflection. \u201cIssues like health are a lottery,\u201d Hurst continues. \u201cJudith goes to the cemetery to change the flowers on Claire\u2019s grave and when she comes back she always remarks that she looked at the tombstones. She is astounded by the amount of young people [who died].\u201d\n\nJudith might find comfort in feeling close to Claire again but Hurst shakes his head when I ask if he visits the graveside. \u201cNo, it\u2019s the opposite for me. I can\u2019t face it.\u201d\n\nHe and Judith married \u201con 13 October 1964 and we were together a couple of years prior to that. We have been amazingly happy.\u201d\n\nConsidering all the heartache they shared, did he ever lose faith in life? \u201cI don\u2019t think so. For a long time I didn\u2019t want to talk about anything relating to the family in public. But I had three daughters and my eldest, Claire, passed away 11 years ago now. At Christmas in 2010. I found it difficult to talk about for a long time.\u201d\n\nGeoff Hurst at home in 1972 with his wife, Judith, and daughters Joanne (then four) and Claire (seven). Photograph: Ray Wright/Offside/Getty Images\n\nHurst now believes that \u201ctrying to hide heartache merely leads to more grief\u201d. After 80 years studded with extreme highs and lows he says: \u201cLife\u2019s got to go on. But you never cease to remember. You never cease to mourn. We talk about what she was like and the things she said and did. The pictures of her in our apartment here are great memories.\u201d\n\nI break the silence by suggesting that such memories sustain us. It sounds trite but Hurst smiles kindly. \u201cThey do, yes.\u201d\n\nAnother memory relates to the death of his brother, Robert, and it has stayed with me all week. Robert took his own life, Hurst explains, \u201cduring one of his dark depressions which, thankfully, never engulfed me\u201d. He adds that \u201cRobert was four years younger than me and he sadly threw himself under a train at Chelmsford station in 1974.\u201d\n\nHe remembers that eight years later, after the Chelsea sacking and a brief period relying on unemployment benefits, \u201cI was doing some punditry and covering games in East Anglia \u2013 Norwich, Ipswich, Peterborough and Cambridge. I\u2019d probably get \u00a360 for the weekend, which was hardly going to keep me and the family in comfort.\n\n\u201cIn early 1982 I\u2019m coming back on the train from Norwich and that line actually goes through Chelmsford into Liverpool Street. It was a Sunday and very few people were on the train. I was in a carriage on my own and there was no canteen. The ticket collector asked if I would like a cup of tea. I said: \u2018That\u2019s very nice of you. Thank you.\u2019 It was quite surprising from a conductor.\u201d\n\nHurst could savour a cup of tea as being one of the rare perks, at least then, of being a World Cup winner. He would soon hear a shattering truth.\n\n\u201cHe came back in five minutes and said: \u2018There\u2019s your tea, Geoff.\u2019 But he also said: \u2018I was working on the train that day your brother jumped in front of it all those years ago.\u201d\n\nHurst pauses as he relives that jolting moment. \u201cI was flattered he had brought me a cup of tea. But I saw afterwards, when he mentioned his connection with my brother, it was something fairly significant in his life as a conductor.\u201d\n\nMaking him tea and sitting down to talk, I suggest, was also a very human gesture.\n\n\u201cVery much so,\u201d Hurst says softly.\n\nIt is only since 1996 that the exploits of Hurst and his World Cup-winning team have become a cause for sustained national celebration. When England won in 1966 the euphoria was limited and life soon returned to normal. Yet when Euro 96 was held in England, millions of people sang that \u201cfootball\u2019s coming home\u201d and about \u201c30 years of hurt\u201d. The song and the sentimentality were back again this past summer as England lost the final of Euro 2020 on penalties.\n\nGeoff Hurst scores England\u2019s fourth goal against West Germany in the 1966 World Cup final to complete his hat-trick. Photograph: Allsport Msi/Allsport\n\nAll the singing of hurt, over football, seems different when you\u2019re talking to Hurst. It feels inconsequential when set against the life-changing pain he withstood. Hurst answers calmly when asked if he ever succumbed to bitterness. \u201cNot at all. I learned you need a good attitude in football and in life. I certainly wasn\u2019t the world\u2019s greatest player but I had a very good attitude.\n\n\u201cAfter football I went into insurance and I was getting knock-backs there. I\u2019ve got some funny stories about my early days trying to sell warranty insurance to car dealerships. I went into a Ford dealership, without an appointment, and saw the secretary. I gave her my card and said: \u2018We haven\u2019t got an appointment but could I see the boss?\u2019 She went into his office, gave him my card, and he came out in five minutes and slung the card at me. It bounced off the table on to the floor and he said: \u2018We don\u2019t deal with ex-footballers.\u2019\u201d\n\nHurst tells me more stories of rejection which are \u201cclear as a bell. Going into the insurance business, Abbey Life had a good induction programme. One of the lessons was making appointments with people over the phone. You picked up a phonebook, randomly picked a few names and tried to make appointments with them. I phoned one number and a woman answered. I said: \u2018I\u2019m Geoff Hurst at Abbey Life.\u2019 I went through the standard procedure and she said: \u2018I\u2019m sorry but my husband deals with this.\u2019 The husband came to the phone and said: \u2018If you\u2019re Geoff Hurst, my name\u2019s f-ing Marilyn Monroe.\u2019\n\n\u201cI look back on these times with great amusement and amazement. In the early days I would practise on Judith. I would go through the garage and knock on the kitchen door. Judith would open it and I\u2019d talk to her about selling insurance. She\u2019d slam the door and say: \u2018Go away.\u2019 But she kept me grounded and that\u2019s very important in a relationship.\u201d\n\nHurst is in the mood to compare life and sport, then and now, because his new book is called Eighty at Eighty. It is a celebration of the 80 sportsmen Hurst has most admired and the list stretches from Muhammad Ali, Rod Laver and Lionel Messi to Pel\u00e9, Garry Sobers and Zinedine Zidane.\n\nIt\u2019s an enjoyable read and full of personal snippets \u2013 from the state of Jim Laker\u2019s spinning fingers when Hurst played that game at Aigburth to Ali being at the 1966 World Cup final. Hurst writes in the opening chapter of his alphabetical romp through 80 sporting stories that Ali \u201cwould still have been my No 1 choice\u201d even if he had listed them \u201cin order of greatness\u201d.\n\nAli was less enamoured by football and Hurst confirms that The Greatest slept through most of England\u2019s 4-2 extra-time defeat of West Germany. In a very different way he and Judith reached a stage where they were \u201creluctant to go out because we knew at some point a complete stranger would ask the dreaded \u2018Was the ball over the line?\u2019 question.\u201d\n\nSir Geoff Hurst near his home in Cheltenham. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nHe always gave his stock answer that the score had changed from 2-2 to 3-2 \u201cso it must have been a goal\u201d \u2013 while he believed in the reaction of the \u201calways honest and fair\u201d Roger Hunt who wheeled away in celebration and certainty that Hurst\u2019s shot had crossed the line.\n\n\u201cPeople ask me: \u2018Do you get fed up talking about it?\u2019\u201d Hurst says of 1966. \u201cThe simple answer is \u2018No\u2019. It\u2019s part and parcel of my life.\u201d\n\nHe talks passionately about Bobby Moore and Martin Peters \u2013 and the book is dedicated to them. Even though he and Moore were close, his captain remained an enigma. \u201cNobody knew the real Bobby Moore,\u201d Hurst suggests but his admiration for the \u201ccool and dignified\u201d footballer who was \u201cone of the greatest defenders the world has ever seen\u201d resonates. Why did Moore seem unknowable?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replies Hurst who even played cricket with Moore for Essex\u2019s second XI. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to describe. People ask me who my idol is and normally you\u2019d be thinking of somebody who played 20 years earlier. My idol, Bobby Moore, was eight months older than me. I grew up with him since we were 15 and saw how he progressed much quicker than me. He was a senior player for West Ham and England four years earlier than I made the first team. But we were good mates and I loved him. He was fantastic, a great leader and an immaculate man.\u201d\n\nHurst is angry that football \u201cturned its back on Bobby\u201d which meant that Moore became \u201ca sideshow \u2026 forced to scratch a living on the periphery\u201d. He compares \u201cthe sickening hypocrisy\u201d of the statues, books and documentaries which followed Moore\u2019s death to the way in which German football has celebrated and utilised the talents of Franz Beckenbauer.\n\n\u201cIn this country,\u201d Hurst says, \u201cmany players who had been at the top level, big names, found it hard to get back into their clubs after finishing. I was once an ambassador for a double glazing company which sponsored West Ham and I was refused entrance into the main gate to Upton Park one night. The girl who stopped me looked 10 yards behind me to the commercial manager, to get some kind of authority to let me in. He just shook his head. That wasn\u2019t unusual. Lots of other great players talked to me about the fact they couldn\u2019t get into their club after they finished. Of course it\u2019s changed massively now.\u201d\n\nHis closest friend was Peters \u2013 who also scored a goal in the 1966 final and was such a visionary player that Alf Ramsey described him as being \u201c10 years ahead of his time\u201d. He and Peters also worked together in insurance and their wives, Judith and Kathy, remain friends after almost 60 years. Peters, who died in December 2019, had Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n\u201cWe were so close to Martin. When we both got married in 1964, I paid \u00a35,050 for my house in Hornchurch. Martin paid \u00a34,950 for his house. His garden backed on to my garden. Martin wasn\u2019t well one Christmas so Judith cooked and passed the plates of dinner over to Kathy to feed him. Kathy and Judith still speak every day, sometimes three times a day. We were as close to a family living with dementia as anyone could possibly be. The Alzheimer\u2019s just accelerated.\u201d\n\nWere the last few months of Peters\u2019 life particularly painful for Hurst? \u201cVery. Listening to the girls talking every day was a commentary of this awful disease. It was bitterly disappointing for Kathy, her family and for us.\u201d\n\nWest Ham\u2019s Geoff Hurst, Bobby Moore and Martin Peters in 1966. Photograph: Central Press/Getty Images\n\nBobby Charlton was diagnosed with dementia last November. \u201cWe haven\u2019t spoken to him for a while,\u201d Hurst says. \u201cI began to get concerned when we didn\u2019t see Bobby on television. Normally at all the Man United games they would show him in the crowd but for a few months prior to the announcement there was no mention or picture of Bobby. I guessed then.\u201d\n\nSo many of their teammates have succumbed to dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s and, while Hurst remains mentally sharp, does Judith worry about him? \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s overly concerned. She does joke and laugh at me sometimes when I make the odd mistake as an old person. But that\u2019s normal.\u201d\n\nHurst, Charlton and George Cohen are the only surviving members of the 1966 team. \u201cI see George occasionally,\u201d Hurst says. \u201cI always joke about George that he should be dead but I spoke to him only a few weeks ago. He had bowel cancer not long after he was playing and it then came back again. It was so serious that they were asked to see the specialist and he said: \u2018You\u2019d better get your affairs in order.\u2019 Daphne [Cohen\u2019s wife] said: \u2018George is going nowhere.\u2019\n\n\u201cOf course, she nursed him through that. He\u2019s on crutches now but mentally he is fine. I spoke to both him and Daphne and it reminded me George was the nicest guy in the team. When people bump into George they always tell me the same thing: \u2018What a lovely man he is.\u2019\u201d\n\nJust days from his 80th birthday Hurst says: \u201cI\u2019m still trying to keep fit and enjoy life. I walk in the park for 50 minutes and do 20 minutes of a Joe Wicks video. I made sure I did it early this morning so I could fit you in. I have a pacemaker but it\u2019s not a big deal and I had my six-weekly check-up last week. Everything is OK.\u201d\n\nHurst tells me about his youngest granddaughter who is only four. \u201cRose is absolutely hilarious. I went round the other day and at the table she said: \u2018Geoff, I love you.\u2019 Everybody just screamed with laughter at her calling me Geoff from nowhere.\u201d\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to drop the \u201cSir\u201d and just call him Geoff too because Hurst is so warm and likable. He hopes England might win a second World Cup next December. \u201cThey\u2019re doing very well as a World Cup semi-final and Euros final the last few years shows. They\u2019re a good, terrific bunch of young players under Gareth Southgate and luckily we\u2019ve forgotten the really awful times. Remember the Iceland game? Goodness me, that was shocking. So I\u2019m hopeful for next year. People say: \u2018I bet you don\u2019t want England to do it again\u2019 but that\u2019s rubbish. I\u2019m an England fan so I hope we can do it.\u201d\n\nHurst admits that his family love the fact that he holds the record as the only footballer to have scored a men\u2019s World Cup final hat-trick. \u201cI\u2019ve got five grandchildren and the second eldest is Jack, who is the son of Claire. Jack is now 30-odd. In the 1998 World Cup final Zidane had scored two and then he was substituted. As soon as he walked off the field, within seconds, I had a text from Jack: \u2018Grandpa, great, you\u2019ve still got the record.\u2019\u201d\n\nHurst laughs again even as we think of that lost time when Claire was still alive. He leans back in his chair and, remembering how there has been so much more good than bad in his own life, Hurst smiles and says: \u201cI\u2019ve had a very good run \u2026 I\u2019ve had a fantastic run.\u201d\n\nEighty at Eighty by Sir Geoff Hurst is published by Pitch"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/aug/23/the-joy-of-six-county-cricket-cult-heroes", "page_content": "Don Shepherd\n\n\n\nDon Shepherd died on Friday, less than a week after turning 90, thus ending a lifelong love affair with Glamorgan cricket. The feeling was very much reciprocated.\n\nJohn Arlott chose Shepherd as his first bowler in the best XI to never play for England, and with good reason. Starting out as a seamer before switching to off-cutters, he took 2,218 first-class wickets in 668 matches between 1950 and 1972. That places him 22nd in the all-time list; all those above him played Test cricket, and all but one, Derek Underwood, are dead. For Arlott his non-selection was \u201cinexplicable\u201d. That word feels fitting.\n\nShepherd was better humoured about the whole thing. He recently sounded fit as a fiddle in a lovely interview with BBC Wales\u2019s Nick Webb to mark becoming a nonagenarian, discussing his life in the game (his good humour, kindness and gentle Welsh burr made him a much-loved commentator for that station for three decades after his retirement from playing). \u201cIt never worried me,\u201d he said of the snub. \u201cThere were so many terrific off-spinners around towards the end \u2013 Fred Titmus, David Allen, John Mortimore, Ray Illingworth \u2013 and they could bat, while I was a bit of a slogger. I was happy enough doing what I did and what happened to me through my life.\u201d\n\nHe was content with his monumental contribution to Glamorgan and he had his moments in the sun against international opposition; he beat South Africa, Pakistan, India and Australia playing for the Welsh county. The Aussies were downed twice; in 1964, he took nine for 93 from 69 overs, and 1968 he was the captain. Richie Benaud, the Australia captain when they drew with Glamorgan in 1961 and Shepherd\u2019s hectic hitting brought him 51 in 11 scoring shots, was a big fan, and was certain he would not have gone uncapped if he were Australian.\n\nThe closest he came to an England call was a tour of Ceylon and the far east with MCC in 1969, the year his wicket sealed Glamorgan\u2019s second County Championship title (there has been just one more since). They were unbeaten and Shepherd was named one of Wisden\u2019s Five Cricketers of the Year for his efforts, too.\n\nBy then he had been a slow bowler for more than a decade. He took 155 wickets in 1952 as a seamer, but a loss of form followed, as well as a memorable line from his tough captain, Wilf Wooller, of Shepherd\u2019s teetotalism. \u201cYou\u2019ll never bowl quick on orangeade,\u201d he said. So he switched, to spin (and ale), and picked up 168 wickets in 1956. He never looked back, and became a terror on uncovered pitches.\n\nThere have been some beautiful tributes since his death, not least from Edward Bevan, his friend and co-commentator for many years. Beyond the remarkable numbers, longevity and love of the game, they tell of a gentleman, who never spurned an autograph and never forgot where he was from. Robert Croft, who was mentored by Shepherd and did end up playing for England, put it rather nicely: \u201cSome never meet their heroes, I luckily did and Shep was 100 times more.\u201d\n\nIan Blackwell celebrates a Lancashire wicket while playing for Durham in 2010. Photograph: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images\n\nIan Blackwell\n\nSomerset are a helpful county for pieces such as this. Perhaps it\u2019s the fact that none of them are title winners, that perennial nearliness, or just the friendly, free-wheeling West Country-ness of it all. It\u2019s not three years since Andy Bull, on this website, wrote an edition of the Spin entitled \u201cPeter Trego, king of the cult cricketers\u201d, while among Trego\u2019s current team-mates a case could be made for James Hildreth and even Marcus Trescothick.\n\nThrowing back 30 years and more, there was Colin Dredge, the Demon of Frome, an uphill-into-the-wind-er for the ages with an ugly action, a huge heart and seven brothers (who all played for Frome, where Dredge still lives). The Demon, his increasingly worried team-mates remember, once arrived at the County Ground peculiarly late. An hour or so after the start, Dredge appeared and wandered on to the field to a series of concerned questions. \u201cIt\u2019s pissing down in Frome,\u201d he responded. Frome, of course, is about 90 minutes from Taunton.\n\nMentioning big-hearted Somerset cricketers sees us segue seamlessly to Ian Blackwell. It feels appropriate, for one reason or another, that Blackwell would be the answer to a rather good pub quiz question. Something along the lines of: who was the \u201cone-cap blunder\u201d (Wisden\u2019s words, not the Guardian\u2019s \u2026) who made his Test debut alongside Alastair Cook and Monty Panesar in Nagpur in 2006?\n\nBlackwell weighed 17 stone at that stage and candidly explained to the press how he felt he could have achieved more were he not so prone to a ham and cheese toastie. His nine-year stint at Somerset (he had started out at Derbyshire, where he fell out bitterly with Dominic Cork) would end when Justin Langer, the captain, told him to shift some timber, and he chose to shift his timber all the way to Durham instead. Injury ended his career in 2013 and he\u2019s now rising up the umpiring ranks.\n\nWhatever his weight, a hefty case could be made for Blackwell being the premier all-rounder in county cricket in the noughties. In first-class cricket he averaged a tick shy of 40 with the bat and took 398 wickets. That one Test didn\u2019t go as hoped (four runs, no wickets), but he had his moments in ODI cricket, such as 82 off 68 in his second match, against India at the Champions Trophy in 2002 (although that was weighed against one run in four innings, including three successive ducks, against Australia the following January).\n\nThat matters not, though. He\u2019ll be remembered for the flair-filled, bar-emptying batting (he made 204 off 98 balls between lunch and tea against Derbyshire \u2013 captained, of course, by Cork \u2013 in 2003), as well as his flat-footed, stingy spinners. 2003 was a sorry summer for Somerset, but Bull remembers how his lusty hitting lit up its end, not just with that Derbyshire double-ton, but 140 against Hampshire and 189 in Northamptonshire, all in consecutive home matches.\n\nWhen Blackwell sidled out to bat at Taunton, there was an anticipation and a wonder about what the hell would happened next. And, as fans of cricket, there\u2019s little more we can ask for than that.\n\nJim Foat in his Gloucestershire days. Photograph: ITN/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nJim Foat\n\nThere\u2019s a book specifically for cricket badgers, Linseed and Fishpaste: Confessions of a Cricket Nut by Mark Bussell. In it are the words: \u201cThe people who can answer correctly the question: who is Jim Foat? This book is first and foremost for them.\u201d\n\nWho the hell was Foat then? He played 91 first-class matches for Gloucestershire in the 70s, ostensibly as a batsman. His nickname was Photo, because the number 0 so often followed the word Foat. He made five tons (fine), but averaged just 18.6 (not fine). None of his first six seasons brought an average of more than 18 but there were two tons in each of 1978 and 1979, when he was capped, and then released. He never took a wicket but could really field, and his run-out of Tony Greig in the 1973 Gillette Cup final against Sussex could be said to have won Gloucestershire the Cup. That might just explain why he played so many games.\n\nFoat was known for his luscious barnet and massive, thick specs, as well as his practical jokes; he once wandered into a sponsor\u2019s marquee at Scarborough, where the town\u2019s lord mayor was sat, dressed as Groucho Marx \u2013 plastic cigar and all \u2013 shouting: \u201cIs that a pistol in your pocket or are you pleased to see me?\u201d\n\nFoat has turned up in spots far more obscure than Bussell\u2019s book. As Ed Craig learned in a profile for the Wisden Cricketer in 2005, there is research conducted at the Institute of Child Health named after him \u2013 the FOAT (fat oxidation-activation transport) complex \u2013 as well as references in legal journals, too.\n\nFoat now lives and works in Exeter as a sales rep for a horticultural company and has not only a Twitter account (we can only presume it to be legit), which says he spends his days \u201cplaying the flute and dancing\u201d, but an IMDb page, for his role in the 1997 documentary Grace and Favour: A Portrait of Gloucestershire CCC. A true club legend.\n\nGlen Chapple, centre, is congratulated on dismissing James Tredwell during a County Championship match between Lancashire and Kent at Liverpool in 2008. Photograph: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images\n\nGlen Chapple\n\nTwenty-five summers after he made his debut for Lancashire, Glen Chapple\u2019s playing career has still not ended, officially at least. He is the county\u2019s head coach, and hasn\u2019t played for the first team since September 2015. It seems certain that, aged 43, he will end stranded on 985 first-class wickets; if he does, the last of those will be a good\u2019un: Alastair Cook. It is unlikely a county player will ever get as close to 1,000 again; Steven Finn has 506 and is 28, but the schedule is only slimming.\n\nIt is a shame he will fall short of four figures (sometimes batting as high as No6, he made six centuries and more than 8,000 runs, too), but much more frustrating for Lancashire fans (many of whom will also extol the cultish qualities of Jack Simmons or Ian Austin) was the lack of international recognition. He played an ODI, against Ireland in 2006, aged 32, but bowled just four wicketless overs because of an abdominal strain (even Ian Bell bowled five that day). As early as 1995 he was very nearly picked to face West Indies and in 2003 he was named in the squad to face South Africa at Trent Bridge. James Kirtley got the nod instead. Kirtley took six second-innings wickets and, remarkably given some of the seamers who have represented England in the quarter-century since he started, Chapple never played a Test.\n\nNever mind, Chapple\u2019s is a career to be heartily celebrated. Durable, dedicated and distinctive-looking (smiley, ruddy-cheeked, and with hair fairer by the summer), Chapple has always said his Yorkshire birthplace, Skipton, was a quirk, housing, as it does, the closest hospital to Earby, in Lancashire, where he is from.\n\n\n\nEarly on, he took six for 18 to bowl Essex out for 57 in the 1996 Natwest Trophy final, a magnificent achievement, but his legend lies in his longevity, his reliability and the fact that he got better with age: his best two seasons, statistically, were 2010 and 2011, in both of which he took more than 50 wickets at an average of 19.75.\n\n\n\nThe second of those seasons is the other reason for the depth of affection for Chapple. After five second-placed finishes in the previous 13 years, Chapple led Lancashire to their first outright Championship title in 77 years. Due to the Old Trafford redevelopment they did not play a single game at their regular home and it was a triumph full of bum-squeaking finishes (such as when they chased 213 in under 30 overs to seal the deal at Taunton). Neatly, oddly, Chapple \u2013 his body creaking more by the day \u2013 was the only international in an overwhelmingly homegrown side.\n\nDarren Lehmann celebrates his double century against Lancashire in 2001. Photograph: Mike Finn-Kelcey/Allsport\n\nDarren Lehmann\n\nThe story, embellished a touch, surely, goes something like this. It is August 2001, and Yorkshire have just won their first title since 1968, and that decade\u2019s all-conquering treble winners. They celebrated, as champions do. Darren Lehmann, the top scorer with 1,416 runs at 83, celebrated, as Darren Lehmann \u2013 a man who has never knowingly shirked a dart or a stubby \u2013 still does. But county cricket, as they say, is played eight days a week, so 36 hours on Yorkshire showed up at Scarborough to face Nottinghamshire in the Sunday League.\n\nLehmann, padding up, found some of the residual fluids of celebration lying in his batting helmet. So he guzzled it down, dropped in a couple of dusty boasts to his team-mates, then \u2013 somewhere between groggy and gazeboed \u2013 ambled out to smite 191 from 103 balls, with 20 fours and 11 sixes. He fell slogging one Kevin Pietersen, the off-spinning first draft (9-0-66-2), but it mattered not. Alone, he scored 18 more than Yorkshire\u2019s opposition who, for what it\u2019s worth, were chasing 353. None of Lehmann\u2019s team-mates passed 30.\n\n\n\nSo, Boof Lehmann: our overseas pro. \u201cThe great man could probably break wind in these parts and draw a standing ovation,\u201d wrote Chris Waters, the Yorkshire Post\u2019s cricket correspondent, when Lehmann returned to Headingley as Australia coach in 2013, seven years after he had last played for the county. Readers of Waters\u2019 paper voted Lehmann into their all-time Yorkshire XI; this, from supporters of a county who only welcomed players born within its own borders from 1992. He was the first modern-day outsider to captain Yorkshire, the year after that championship triumph.\n\n\n\nNo cricketer has more Sheffield Shield runs than Lehmann \u2013 a record he isn\u2019t remotely happy about, because it showed he wasn\u2019t playing enough Test cricket \u2013 but his county stats are ludicrous, too. In 88 matches he scored 8,871 runs, including 26 tons, at an average of 68.76, all with panache and power (a strike-rate of 80!). His 61 wickets came at 32, too.\n\n\n\nOstensibly, Lehmann\u2019s relationship with Yorkshire ended in September 2006, when he made 339 against Durham at Headingley. He fell two shy of the 101-year-old Yorkshire record of George Hirst (who, Sir Pelham Warner once said, had a smile that \u201cused to meet around the back of his neck\u201d; a man after Lehmann\u2019s heart, then), trying to hit a six. In the Guardian, the report by David Hopps, a Yorkie and a keen student of Broad Acre behaviour, began: \u201cIn a county so proud of its homegrown traditions this statement would once have been heresy, but no longer: Darren Lehmann is one of the greatest players Yorkshire has known.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Lehmann and Yorkshire love affair, fittingly, did not end there. A decade to the month on, Lehmann\u2019s 24-year-old son Jake \u2013 as recognisable a figure, but for his mousey moustache, rather than his girthy gut \u2013 made his first ton for the county in what, for now at least, proved to be his final game. Perhaps there\u2019s more to come.\n\nLuke Fletcher towers above his Nottinghamshire team-mates after dismissing Hampshire\u2019s Jimmy Adams caught-and-bowled in 2016. Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA\n\nLuke Fletcher\n\nOf those still trucking away in the shires, you could make a decent case for Chris Rushworth, the Durham seamer whose bucketload of wickets don\u2019t look like they\u2019ll be rewarded with an England call. Then there\u2019s Steve Patterson, the lanky, slightly wobbly medium-pacer who has won the title twice with Yorkshire. Or Darren Stevens, the evergreen Kent all-rounder who so many, somehow, still underestimate and has taken all 17 of his first-class five-fers after the age of 35. Perhaps in a few years time, the thick-set, bustling and bafflingly young (his 26 years appear to have been tough ones) Worcestershire skipper Joe Leach and his witty sidekick Jack Shantry, the cack-footed tangle of limbs, might come into consideration.\n\nAnd then you remember the Bulwell Bomber, Luke Fletcher. Fletcher is a throwback: six feet, six inches, close cropped up top, burly and broad of buttock, he just keeps indefatigably charging in, looking more like the doorman at a provincial nightclub with every delivery. There\u2019s a grimace as he bowls, but a grin at all other times.\n\nThe 28-year-old is as Notts as the Radcliffe Road. He is in his 10th season at the county but before the first he spent time flipping burgers at Hooters up the road from Trent Bridge (the only surviving branch in the country and proud bat sponsors of Fletcher\u2019s team-mate Steven Mullaney), then as a steward at the ground. He has since enjoyed a fine career, with his first-class wickets coming at under 29, and a reputation as one of the best yorker bowlers in the land in T20. Fletcher is the kind of cricketer who gives us all hope: he makes the game look bloody hard work but really great fun, too.\n\n\n\nLast winter, jolted by the coaching change of Mick Newell to Peter Moores, plenty of Notts players shaped up. Fletcher led the way, shedding three stone while wintering with Buckley Ridges in Melbourne. It reaped instant rewards, as he not only made it into the ultra-competitive bowling lineup but thrived in their romping early season form, taking 36 wickets as an ever-present across the first nine Division Two games.\n\nIn the second of those nine, against Durham, he also equalled his highest first-class score, 92. Having come in as nightwatchman with his side teetering at 92 for four, he batted beautifully until his partner, James Pattinson, pushed to point and Fletcher set off for a run. He made it halfway before being realising he had been sent back and, in the process of turning his truck of a frame, slipped, dropped his bat and was run out, but not without a fight, even dipping his head for the line like a sprinter. Tragic stuff.\n\nThe love for Fletcher across the circuit was shown when, in July, his first ball of a T20 against Warwickshire was driven cleanly, and straight back at him, by Sam Hain. It struck Fletcher hard on the noggin, felling him, causing bruising and a small bleed on the brain. After eight stitches, he was ruled out for the season.\n\nHe dealt with the blow in typically good spirits, saying: \u201cIn a weird way, I quite enjoyed watching it back ... It was amazing how far the ball went [off my head].\u201d As messages of support flooded in on Twitter, Fletcher sent his condolences to the other victim of Hain\u2019s blow: \u201cHope the ball is recovering as well as me.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/228196.html", "page_content": "1943\n\nObituaries in 1942\n\nANDREAE, MR. CHARLES, a member of the 1891 Harrow XI which beat Eton by seven wickets, died on September 26, aged 69. He went to Trinity College, Cambridge, and played in the Tennis singles and doubles against Oxford in 1894, but did not excel at cricket.\n\nARKWRIGHT, MR. HAROLD ARTHUR, who died on December 10, aged 70, was in the Eton XI, 1890 and 1891, and an Oxford Blue in 1895. In the autumn of that year he went to America with Frank Mitchell's eleven. He appeared occasionally for Essex from 1893 to 1895. In 1891, when Winchester won at Eton by five wickets, Arkwright scored 59 and 44 and took four wickets, being the most prominent performer on the losing side.\n\nARNOLD, EDWARD G., an all-round cricketer of sterling merit, died on October 25, aged 65, after a long illness from which he made periodic recoveries without regaining full health. He helped to raise Worcestershire to first-class county rank in 1899 and reached his prime in 1902, the first of four consecutive seasons in which he performed the double feat of scoring 1,000 runs and taking 100 wickets. His best year was 1903, when he made 1,157 runs and took 143 wickets.\n\nHe played in eight Test matches against Australia, twice helping England to win a rubber. In the winter of 1903-04 he was in the team captained by P. F. Warner which recovered \"The Ashes\" after the ascendancy of Australia since 1896 when Harry Trott's team were beaten in England. Arnold in that victorious tour did better work with the ball than his figures suggest: only Rhodes, by far the most effective bowler on the side, enjoyed greater success, both in the Tests and all first-class matches. The attack was very strong with Hirst, Braund, B. J. T. Bosanquet also in form. Other bowlers new to Australia besides Arnold were Fielder and A. E. Reif, who both disappointed in eleven-a-side matches; so all the more credit belonged to Arnold.\n\nTaking four wickets for 8 runs, he shared with Rhodes, five wickets for 6 runs, in the dismissal of Victoria for 15--the smallest score on record in first-class Australian cricket. This happened at Melbourne in February, three weeks before the fourth Test which decided the rubber. Arnold failed utterly with the bat, but, avenging his first \"duck,\" he took four wickets for 28 and, having \"bagged a brace,\" he disposed of Trumper and Duff, Australia's opening pair --disasters from which recovery was impossible, Bosanquet and Hirst claiming the remainder of the side. Altogether in those Tests Arnold took 18 wickets at 26.38 runs apiece; Rhodes 31 at 15.74 each; Bosanquet 16 at 25.18. Perhaps because of his prolonged bowling efforts, Arnold's batting proved poor, his highest innings in the four Tests in which he took part being 27, and in the tour 34.\n\nIn 1905, when England under F. S. Jackson won the rubber, Arnold appeared in four of the Test matches without doing himself justice. Still, the honour belonged to him of three times participating in rubbers which proved triumphant for England. In 1907, Arnold took part in the first Test match at Lord's against South Africa and claimed five wickets for 37 in the first innings, but he failed when the visitors followed-on, and was ineffective at Leeds, where his Test experience ended with England victorious in the only match of three brought to a definite finish. For some time he was a regular choice for Players and other representative sides. From 1899 to 1913 he stood out prominently for Worcestershire, making 18 centuries, the highest 200 not out against Warwickshire at Birmingham in 1909. In that match on the Edgbaston ground he and W. B. Burns added 393--a fifth wicket record in English cricket which still stands. He bowled with deadly results on many occasions. Altogether in first-class cricket Arnold scored 15,583 runs, average 29.91, and took 1,057 wickets at an average cost of 23.28.\n\nOf good height and build, though lean, Arnold bowled right-hand above medium pace, with varied speed and spin. He brought the ball down from an exceptional height, producing lift which made him specially difficult on a lively pitch, and he could take full use of drying turf. Strong in defence, he batted with plenty of power when set making strokes in all directions. Usually fielding in the slips, he held 163 catches.\n\nASKEW, MR. JOHN GARBUTT, who died on August 31 after a long illness, played both cricket and Rugby football very well. He captained the Durham XI in 1926, and going up to Cambridge scored 103, retired, in the 1929 Freshmen's match. Twice he batted soundly in the Seniors' matches, but he did little when tried for the University. Besides his skill with the bat, Askew bowled effectively when at school. In his last year he took 33 wickets at 14.81 each, besides averaging 37.30. A highly efficient Rugby centre-threequarter, he was called upon to play full-back for Cambridge, getting his Blue in 1929 and the two following seasons. He was captain in 1930, and showed to so great advantage that he appeared for England against Ireland, Wales and France at full-back. He played both cricket and football for Durham County.\n\nBANCROFT, JACK, who kept wicket for Glamorgan in 1922, died in January at Swansea Hospital after a long illness. Very good at Rugby football, he played for Wales eighteen times--1909 to 1914.\n\nBARLOW, MR. HERBERT RANDLE BRERETON, who died at Bloemfontein on March 10, aged 59, was prominent as player and administrator of sport in the Orange Free State for many years. He played for the province at various times from 1904 to 1922.\n\nBARRINGTON, MR. GEORGE BAINBRIDGE, a notable figure in Derbyshire cricket, mainly in connection with the Derbyshire Friars club, of which he was a founder, died on February 26, aged 84. Poor health prevented him playing much at Repton, but when 19 he made a name in club cricket, and remained a member of Derbyshire Friars until his death removed the last of the original members. In club cricket he scored 44,065 runs, with a highest innings of 220, sixty centuries, and an average of 31.63. He made 190 in a total of 742 by the Friars at Derby in 1881, the record total at that time. First chosen for Derbyshire in the match against W. L. Murdoch's 1880 Australian eleven, he scored 24 when the County followed-on, and his was the best effort. Barrington took part in 24 matches for the County altogether, but met with only moderate success, his best innings in an aggregate of 440 being 50 and his average less than ten. He could bowl slows effectively, earned fame as a clever and considerate captain, while he often undertook the duty of umpire when compelled to give up more strenuous activities.\n\nBARTLETT, MR. EZRA WILLIAM, died on March 16, aged 80. Born at Burton-on-Trent, he was appointed to the Post Office at the age of 21, and, besides his official duties, cricket made him well known in Somerset. For many years he was president of the Taunton club and one of the best batsmen in the district. An occasional player for the county in 1895, he took part in the match in which A. C. MacLaren made 424, a record for all important cricket until W. H. Ponsford scored 429 for Victoria against Tasmania in the winter of 1922. With regard to that performance at Melbourne, A. C. MacLaren wrote strongly to S. H. Pardon as to the justice of the game with Tasmania being included in Wisden as first class, because Victoria's second eleven were engaged and Ponsford did not play in the highest grade inter-State cricket until later that season when at Adelaide he scored 108. Since then Ponsford himself and Bradman in turn established new records. During the Lancashire innings of 801 Bartlett went on as the ninth bowler. This prolonged innings, the highest in County cricket at that time, came immediately after 692 by Middlesex at Taunton, making six days of first-class cricket with a Sunday intervening, which gave Bartlett an experience that only the keenest fieldsman could appreciate; his own scores in these two games were 4, 7, 4, 6, and his highest for Somerset was 40 against Hampshire early in the 1895 season.\n\nBATEMAN-CHAMPAIN, Mr. FRANCIS HENRY, who would have taken a high place among first-class cricketers but for scholastic duties as a master in turn at Wellington and Cheltenham limiting his appearances for Gloucestershire, died at Tiverton on December 29 in his 66th year. Born at Richmond in Surrey, he went to Cheltenham College and was one of five brothers in the cricket eleven from 1883 to 1898. He enjoyed the remarkable distinction of playing in the eleven five seasons, 1892 to 1896, being captain during the last three. Twice he headed the batting averages and, maintaining this form, he obtained his Blue as a Freshman at Oxford, where he was in the eleven four years.\n\nCaptain in 1899, he earned high praise by making the first hundred hit against Joe Darling's Australian team--120 on the Christ Church ground--and Oxford led on the first innings by 38. That season, when W. G. Grace had left Gloucestershire, F. H. Bateman-Champain scored a brilliant 123 out of 182 for the first wicket against Warwickshire at Bristol; he hit all five 4's in a five-ball over from S. Santall to the boundary. In 1907 he made his highest score, 149 against Surrey at the Oval, but perhaps his best display for the county was in 1897, when with little experience of first-class cricket, he stopped an utter collapse by scoring 97 in a total of 137 against Lancashire at Bristol. F. G. Roberts, 7 not out, stayed while 74 were added for the last wicket. I saw that innings and recall how W. G. Grace and A. N. Hornby, the rival captains, congratulated the former Oxonian on his admirable style and free hitting against Hallam, Cuttell, Mold and Briggs. His liking for the Lancashire attack was shown again next year at Old Trafford in a splendid not out innings of 113, played in a great effort to get 374 for victory.\n\nHis last appearance for Gloucestershire was in 1914. He played for Gentlemen against Players at the Oval in 1897 and 1899, making 82 on the first occasion. Altogether during his much broken cricket career he scored 3,597 runs at an average of 19.42 in first-class matches. Sometimes he bowled slows, but in the field his place was at cover-point, where he was grand in the exceptional company of such a great off-side fieldsman as G. L. Jessop--his rival captain for Cambridge when the Oxford leader was known as F. H. B. Champain. He never revealed his batting form at Lord's in the University match, his best score being 34, but as a half-back for Oxford he played consistently well in the seasons 1897 to 1899. He took up fruit farming in British Columbia in 1911, and during the Great War he became captain in the Ordnance Corps.--H.P.\n\nBELL, MR. A. K., who died at Perth on April 26, was prominent in Scottish cricket as a player for Perthshire, which he captained for a long period, and for the Grange club, besides being a liberal supporter of the game. He gave the cricket ground at Dorrat Park to Perth, and more recently Perth Academy were indebted to him for a new pitch. A kinsman of A. J. Bell, the South African bowler, he always welcomed cricket guests, among those in recent years being D. G. Bradman.\n\nBIRD, MR. PERCY JOHN, who died suddenly at Freshwater Bay, Isle of Wight, in November, aged 62, took a prominent part in local cricket and occasionally played for Hampshire. He was a member of M.C.C. and well known in racing and yachting circles.\n\nBRINTON, MR. REGINALD SEYMOUR, died at Kidderminster on February 23, aged 72. Educated at Winchester and Oxford, he failed to qualify for either eleven, but played occasionally for Worcestershire from 1903 to 1909.\n\nBUCKSTON, CAPTAIN GEORGE MORETON, died very suddenly on November 24, aged 61. For Eton in 1900 he scored 45 and 4 at Lord's in a splendid match which Harrow won by one wicket. A late choice for Cambridge in 1903, he failed, like most of his colleagues, in a one-sided encounter which Oxford won by 268 runs. A peculiar feature of the Cambridge batting was that Dowson, 54, and Keigwin, 30, in the first innings, Godsell, 59, and F. B. Wilson in the second innings, were the only scorers of double figures. Buckston played for Derbyshire in 1906, averaging 20.37 with highest innings 96, but he fared poorly next season, when Derbyshire finished last in the championship, and did not appear again until undertaking the captaincy in 1921. Returning to important cricket after a long absence, when 40 years of age he enjoyed the satisfaction of helping Derbyshire in a great improvement on their previous season's disastrous record. He could not be persuaded to retain the position, but became chairman of the County Club Committee.\n\nBOOTH, MR. JOHN JAMES, President of the Bradford Cricket League for twenty-five years before retiring in 1933, died on May 15, aged 71. He did much to encourage the charitable side of the Priestley Cup Competition and raised the status of League cricket generally by his work as President of the Yorkshire Cricket Federation which protects the interests of about 650 clubs in the county. Mr. Booth influenced the development of young players to county class, and during the last war he helped the introduction of star professionals to League cricket.\n\nBUSH, COLONEL HARRY STEBBING, C.M.G., C.B., whose death occurred on March 18 at the age of 70, stood out as a batsman of marked ability for Surrey, when free from military duties, between 1901 and 1912. He gave an exceptionally good display at Old Trafford in 1902 when hitting 111 off the strong Lancashire attack. Other noteworthy innings for the county were 135 against Derbyshire and 101 not out against Nottinghamshire, both at the Oval in 1911, when, with an average of 41.35, he came second to Hayward in the Surrey batting. Altogether in first-class cricket he averaged 24.59 for an aggregate of 2,607 runs. A heavy scorer in club cricket, he made 314 not out for Eastbourne against C. E. Hambro's eleven in 1893 in five hours. Also at Eastbourne that year he scored 113 and 122 not out against Crystal Palace. This double feat he repeated in 1909 with 114 and 134 for Army Ordnance Corps against R.A., Woolwich; he could bowl, too, and in that match took 12 wickets. Still more remarkable was his all-round performance at Folkestone against Oxford Authentics in 1909, when he scored 254, took 17 wickets and held a catch. In his last match of importance for The Army against Royal Navy at Lord's in 1914 he made 34 and 36. He excelled on fast pitches, thanks to adhering to the custom of playing forward with full use of his height and strength. His off-driving was brilliant in its certainty and power. So sure was he in timing the ball that he batted without gloves, and seldom suffered at all from such a daring habit that was peculiar to himself during his own period of excellence. Educated at Dover College, he developed ability at Rugby football as a wing three-quarter for Harlequins and Surrey.\n\nCANDLER, MR. JOHN PYCROFT, Medical Officer of Health for Huntingdon, died on December 4, aged 70. He played in trial matches at Cambridge in 1894 with the strange experience of failing to score in six innings, being three times not out. Next season he was equally unfortunate until his fourth effort realised 8 not out. As a bowler he took a few wickets at high cost.\n\nCHEALES, COLONEL RALPH DARBY, O.B.E., who died at Vereeniging, South Africa, on December 23, aged 73, was in the Harrow eleven in 1888 when Eton were beaten by 156 runs. F. S. Jackson gave a wonderful display with both bat and ball; on an occasion when many batsmen failed he scored 21 and 59 and took eleven wickets for 68 runs. It was said that before the match Jackson's father, subsequently raised to the Peerage as Lord Allerton, promised his son a sovereign for every wicket he took and a shilling for every run that he made. Congratulated after the match, young Jackson replied, I don't care so much for myself, but it will give the guv'nor a lift. Cheales, tenth in the batting order, got only 6 not out and 3, and did not bowl. That was better than A. C. MacLaren, 0 and 4, opening batsman, who, like Jackson--so well known as Sir Stanley Jackson, P.C.--reached the highest fame in the cricket world.\n\nCOLMAN, SIR JEREMIAH, J. P., died on January 15, aged 82, at his home, Gatton Park, Reigate, Surrey. A year before he underwent a severe operation from which he never fully recovered, but until a few hours before his passing he attended to business and signed cheques. That was characteristic of the close interest and unflagging zeal which he applied to cricket. The game was in his blood, for his father was one of eleven brothers who played as a team in Norfolk about a century ago. He used to say that he had no chance of cricket at school, but at St. John's College, Cambridge, he learned to bowl with such good results that he became captain of the College XI in 1882.\n\nHe never played first-class cricket, but occupied his leisure watching all the best matches, particularly those between England and Australia and the Universities. A member of the Surrey Club from an early age, he became President in 1916, retained the office for seven years, and remained an enthusiastic Vice-President until his end. Famous in commerce as the Mustard Millionaire, he related that his father, one of the founders of the firm--J. and J. Colman--once said that the family fortunes were made, not from the mustard people ate, but from what they left on their plates. He had a splendid collection of cricket pictures and was one of the best-known growers of orchids in the world.\n\nCOLMAN, MR. STANLEY, known to all cricketers in the South of England as captain of Wanderers Club for over fifty years, died at Walton-on-the-Hill on February 27, aged 80. When a boy he founded the club, which remained his chief hobby, and, changing its name from Clapham Wanderers, he conducted all its business. When at length his playing days ceased he continued as treasurer and acted as M.C. at the annual dinner--an outstanding event in cricket's social life until the war intervened. Youngest son of Mr. Edward Colman, one of eleven brothers who played cricket in Norfolk a century ago, Stanley was cousin of Sir Jeremiah, whom he outlived by only a few weeks.\n\nAn admirable bat and safe fieldsman, he played for Surrey occasionally in the'eighties, his highest innings being 63--his first appearance for the county, at Trent Bridge in 1882, coincided with that of Robert Abel. He often captained the second XI and at the Oval in 1897 carried his bat for 111 against Northamptonshire. For many years he served on the County Club Committee, and never missed watching a match at the Oval unless playing elsewhere, while, despite declining health, he maintained his attendance in 1939. A member of M.C.C., he invariably wore the club's famous red and gold tie.\n\nDuring his long active career he scored over 40,000 runs and made over a hundred centuries, and such was his stubborn defence that in more than 300 innings he was not out. Most memorable of his achievements was his first-wicket stand of 472 with Percy Coles for Devonshire Park against G. W. Morrison's XI at Eastbourne in 1892, a record partnership for any wicket in all grades of cricket until J. T. Brown and J. Tunnicliffe put up 554 for Yorkshire against Derbyshire at Chesterfield in 1898. While usually a steady batsman, he could use his height in fine hitting all round the wicket. S. H. Evershed (172), afterwards Derbyshire captain, and Stanley Colman (112) added 310 for the Carrow second wicket in 135 minutes at Lakenham and were not separated. Twice with D. L. A. Jephson, afterwards Surrey captain, Stanley Colman scored 300 for the first wicket. For Wanderers in 1900 he made 102 not out, 145 and 100 (retired hurt) in consecutive innings. A strange experience was his opening stand for 211 with F. E. Saunders, an England Association international half-back. Neither man hit a boundary owing to the size of the ground and long grass in the country.\n\nA very good sprint runner, Stanley Colman played both Rugby and Association football for Clapham Rovers. When feeling too old for the Rugby game he captained the club's Association eleven. I was fortunate to play with him and N. C. Bailey. In later years he was a keen golfer until neuritis in the arm compelled him to forsake active participation in any game.--H.P.\n\nCOMBEY, JOHN, who played for Durham from 1903 to 1906, died in August, aged 64. At different times he was professional with the Blyth and Dalkieth, Edinburgh, clubs and coach at Royal High School, Edinburgh. A good fast bowler and sure catch in the slips, he also proved useful as a batsman late on the list.\n\nCONSTANTINE, MR. LEBRUN S., who died on January 5 at Trinidad, aged 67, came to England with the first two teams from West Indies in 1900 and 1906, and made a name for proficiency at the game, earning a reputation for zeal which his son, Laurie N. Constantine, has raised to high fame. After doing well for Trinidad as a batsman with individual style in bringing off unexpected strokes, Lebrun Constantine, under the captaincy of Mr. R. S. A. Warner, brother of Sir Pelham, averaged 30 for 610 runs on his first visit, being surpassed only by Ollivierre. Against Gentlemen of M.C.C. at Lord's, after being not out 24, he scored 113 in the follow-on, and with W. J. Burton, one of two professionals in the side, added 162 in 65 minutes for the ninth wicket, so preventing an innings defeat. On his second visit Lebrun Constantine averaged 29 for 1,025 in all matches. Besides his value as a vigorous batsman he fielded with plenty of dash.\n\nDAVIS, MR. JOSEPH GARIBALDI, secretary of the Chicago Cricket Club and a distinguished player for them over forty years ago, died on April 3 in his 80th year. An Englishman, born in London, he went to America in 1884, and in 1890 joined the Chicago Cricket Club. In 1879, by taking 127 wickets, he set up a club record which held for forty years. A good bat, he made several centuries, and in 1903, with J. M. Laing, put on 312 for the fourth wicket--a Chicago record. He showed ability at other games and held a high position as a sporting journalist.\n\nDE PARAVICINI, MR. HARRY FARQUHAR, a noted Sussex sportsman and Past-President of the County Cricket Club, died on October 28, at Hove, aged 83. He played for Harrow in 1877 and 1878, his more famous younger brother, Percy John, being in the Eton XI that suffered defeat by 20 runs in the latter year. Harry went to Cambridge, but did not get his Blue, and he played sometimes for Middlesex without any notable success. He was one of the Harrow pair that won the Public Schools Racquets Championship in 1878.\n\nDOLPHIN, ARTHUR, the well-known wicket-keeper and Test match umpire died at his home in Bradford on October 24 in his 56th year. Yorkshire wicket-keepers have been noted for long and effective service, and Dolphin followed Ned Stephenson, George Pinder, Joe Hunter and David Hunter, while Arthur Wood, his successor, came as the sixth who, taken together, did splendid service for their county during nearly eighty years.\n\nFirst appearing for Yorkshire in 1905, Dolphin became the regular keeper in 1910, and held the position until he retired at the end of the 1927 season, Contemporary with Herbert Strudwick and E. J. Smith, Dolphin only once played for England--in the Fourth Test Match at Melbourne in February 1921, when Australia, captained by W. W. Armstrong, won the rubber with five victories over the team led by J. W. H. T. Douglas. During a career extending over 23 seasons, Dolphin held 488 catches and stumped 231 men, and scored 4,191 runs in first-class matches, average 10.76.\n\nAs a batsman he often defended well in a crisis, and perhaps his best performance was against Essex at Leyton in 1919, the season of two-day matches; he scored 62 not out, and with E. Smith put on 103 for the last wicket, so saving their side from following-on when Yorkshire were in danger.\n\nOne of his most notable feats behind the stumps was against Hampshire at Leeds in 1921, a match which provided a genuine sensation. Hampshire declared at 456 for two wickets, Dolphin having conceded only two byes. Two England left-handers, George Brown 232, and C. P. Mead, 122, both not out, severely punished the Yorkshire bowling and the northern county were beaten by an innings and 72 runs. In his benefit match in 1892 at Leeds against Kent, which realised \u00a31,891, he scored 2, and 20 out of 24 without being dismissed, he having the honour of hitting off the runs required by Yorkshire for victory by ten wickets.\n\nWhen his playing days were over, Dolphin became an efficient and popular umpire, known as the man who never wore a hat. Even on the hottest day he stood bare-headed in the middle.\n\nDUCAT, ANDREW, died July 23; see special article, page 42.\n\nFITZSIMMONS, MR. EDWARD, a good slow bowler for Wellington fifty years ago, died at Wanganui on January 29, aged 73. He used the off-break with effect and his accurate length made him difficult to punish. A smart slip fieldsman, he completed his value as an all-rounder by causing trouble late in the batting list.\n\nFRANCIS, G. M., a bowler of exceptional merit, as county batsmen discovered in 1923 when a team from West Indies visited England, died in January aged 44. Avoiding any theory, such as many fast bowlers have overdone, he bowled at the stumps. A groundsman in Barbados, he attracted the attention of H. B. G. Austin, captain of the side, and by his influence Francis came to England. He took 96 wickets at 15.32 apiece, and in first-class matches with 82 at 15.58 each he far surpassed the efforts of any of his colleagues. He did not maintain this form in 1928 when West Indies received Test status, and generally faced stronger opposition than on their previous tour. To Francis only 56 batsmen fell at an average cost of 31.96, chief honours going to L. N. Constantine and H. C. Griffith. These three were described at one time as the strongest combination of fast bowlers in any Test side, but they accomplished far more at home than when in England. In January 1926, for Barbados, Francis took nine wickets for 56 runs, and the M.C.C. team captained by the Hon. F. S. G. Calthorpe were beaten in an innings--the only defeat suffered. Directly afterwards England enjoyed full revenge in the first representative match, but when Barbados were faced again--these three games being played in the course of a fortnight-- Francis, with seven wickets for 50 and two for 41, helped to outplay the Englishmen, who, with eight wickets down after following-on, narrowly escaped defeat on a pitch damaged by rain. When West Indies lost at Port of Spain, Francis did little, but again was the best bowler at Georgetown, where England had to fight to avoid defeat.\n\nIn the Australian season of 1930-31 West Indies contested a full series of five Tests, and Francis, without accomplishing anything exceptional, was prominent in an attack which helped to gain a victory by 30 runs, after two declarations by G. C. Grant, in the final match of the series at Sydney. They lost four times, and this first success over Australia, though largely due to changed conditions by rain, showed that West Indies were making rapid progress in the cricket world. Francis had no pretensions in batting, but fielded in the dashing style associated with teams representing West Indies. In 1933 Francis, then engaged in English League cricket, played in the First Test at Lord's, but failed and did not appear again.\n\nGALE, MR. NORMAN ROWLAND, the Cricket Poet, who played the game with the Rugby Club, died on October 7, aged 80. Among his many beautiful publications were Cricket Songs, 1890 and 1894; More Cricket Songs, 1905; and Close of Play, 1936, with which he ended:\n\nRun out:\n\nTo cricket played without a crease,\n\nIts scores, umpires and police,\n\nA harrowing farewell:\n\nAll that I had to sing is sung,\n\nAnd now, being very far from young,\n\nI have no more to tell.\n\nGIDDY, MR. LENNOX LLEWELLYN, died at Pretoria in June, aged 73. He batted well for Eastern Province teams from 1887 to 1906. For Grahamstown XXII in March 1889 against the first English team to tour South Africa he scored 45, and played against each of the next four English teams. In Currie Cup cricket his best performance was 62 and 71 for Eastern province against Griqualand West at Port Elizabeth in April 1903. An outstanding tennis player, he was the South African singles champion from 1894 to 1898.\n\nGURNEY, MR. WALTER SOMERVILLE, a noted Norfolk cricketer for many years, died on July 1, aged 84. A good batsman at Haileybury and smart fieldsman, he played admirably for the county of his birth and occasionally for Suffolk when residing at Ipswich. He was chief scorer for Norfolk against M.C.C., who were defeated at East Dereham in 1876, and he made the highest score, 71, when, in 1882, Norfolk beat Shaw and Shrewsbury's famous team at Norwich. Another memorable innings was 96 not out at Southampton in a drawn match with Hampshire in 1889.\n\nHALL, MR. JOHN E., for many years secretary of the Canadian Cricket Association, died during the summer at the age of 88. Born in Lancashire, he went to Canada when about 23 years old, and in his new home became an enthusiastic supporter of the game he loved. He was on the board of both the Toronto and Parkdale clubs, and made the arrangements, besides acting as scorer, for several English visiting teams.\n\nHAYCRAFT, MR. JAMES SAMUEL, died in London on March 26, aged 77 years. A prolific scorer for the Stoics, Nondescripts and Pallingswick clubs, he played once for Middlesex--against Surrey at the Oval in 1885. Going in first, he was bowled by George Lohmann for 0 and 5. On a drying pitch Middlesex, in their first season under A. J. Webbe, dismissed for 25 and 77, were beaten by an innings and 64 runs. W. (Billy) Williams, still a familiar figure at Lord's, also was making his first appearance for Middlesex and retained his place as wicket-keeper during that summer; but the dismal experience satisfied Haycraft.\n\nHAYWOOD, ROBERT A., a batsman who did good service for Northamptonshire from 1910 to 1921, died in Edinburgh on June 1, aged 54. The opportunity of becoming coach at Fettes College influenced him to give up county cricket when at the height of his form. Born at Eltham, in Surrey, he played for Northamptonshire against Philadelphians in 1908, and next season, with 39, he was the highest scorer in the second innings against M. A. Noble's Australian team during the county qualifying period. He started modestly when appearing in most of the championship matches in 1910, and, rising to number three in the list, he became the most prolific batsman next season, with 153 against Gloucestershire--his first century, made by brilliant hitting all round the wicket. He joined G. J. Thomson when six wickets were down for 69, and they added 222 in two hours and a half. Victory by ten wickets resulted. The same pair put on 230 at a slow pace against Yorkshire at Dewsbury earlier in the season, and their steadiness helped to beat Yorkshire by 44 runs in the return match. Curiously enough, when in 1912 Northants finished a close second to Yorkshire for the championship, Haywood declined more than other batsmen in a wet summer, and bowling accounted for the county doing so well. Usually a hard hitter, Haywood sometimes avoided risks, but was always good to watch. In 1920 the visit of Surrey to Northampton produced the record aggregate for a county match--1475 for 27 wickets-- Haywood contributing 15 and 96. Next season, his last, he scored 1,887 runs, average 43.88, and was by far the most valuable batsman for the county. He hit eight of the eleven centuries scored for the side, his highest, 198 against Glamorganshire, a splendid display of hard, safe stroke play, marred by only one chance when 168. Altogether in first-class cricket his aggregate reached 8,225 at an average of 28.66 an innings.\n\nHUGGINS, HARRY J., a Gloucestershire professional from 1901 to 1921, died on November 19 at Stroud, aged 65. He started when G. L. Jessop made the Western county an attraction wherever they played, and some of his remarkable performances with the ball helped in victories over presumably more powerful sides. Born at Oxford in 1877, Huggins was 24 when his residential qualification enabled him to appear in county cricket, and, taking 63 wickets, he at once showed his value, but was expensive. Relying less on swerve, he concentrated on length and spin next season, with such good results that his medium-paced bowling, gathering pace from the turf, brought startling results in two matches. At Hove in May, in the Sussex first innings he bowled 21 overs and 5 balls, 15 maidens, for 17 runs and 7 wickets--a grand achievement that paved the way to a substantial victory. He also clean bowled Ranjitsinhji in the second innings, and formed a strong contrast to Fred Roberts, the last left-hander, who claimed in the match seven wickets for 57. In August, at Worcester, Huggins returned figures almost as good--21.1-8-37-7.\n\nTwo years later, 1904, he surpassed these efforts in the August Bank Holiday match at Bristol by taking nine Sussex wickets for 34 runs in 26 overs and 2 balls--15 maidens. If less successful in the second innings, he again bowled C. B. Fry, so repeating one deadly ball bowled at Hove in May, when his match record showed ten wickets for 132 runs. In that first innings at Bristol, Huggins clean bowled eight men and caught his other victim from a return. No wonder that the Sussex captain described Huggins as equal to any bowler that Sussex played against during that summer. Fry spoke from personal experience, besides critical observation from the pavilion. George Dennett then had succeeded Roberts as the stock left-handed bowler, and to his clever slows the speed of Huggins proved a most valuable foil, quite apart from the ability of the faster bowler to dismiss the best batsmen. Unfortunately Huggins put on weight for a middle-height man and his brilliant days grew infrequent. His full record in first-class cricket, 584 wickets at 29.03 runs apiece, showed clearly that he often proved expensive.\n\nAs a batsman also he was fitful. He looked like developing into a great all-rounder when in 1904 at Nottingham he contributed 53 to the highest total made by any county that season, 636; Jessop hit 206 and Gloucestershire won in a single innings. But his rise in the batting order did not last, and his best year, 1906, brought him no more than 465 runs, average 22.14 in county matches, with 91 his best display. His record in sixteen seasons totalled 4,375 runs, average 14.43. After retirement as a player he scored for the county during several seasons. For over forty years he was associated with the Stroud club, for whom his ability as a forcing batsman brought many runs.\n\nHYDE, SIR CHARLES, Bart., O.B.E., LL.D., President of the Warwickshire County Cricket Club from 1931, died on November 26, aged 66. At the annual meeting of the club in March 1940 he made a memorable speech regarding money-making sports. Sir Charles said that when county cricket started again something would have to be done about the entertainment tax. Cricket was one of the few sports which had not degenerated into a gambling and money-making concern. Racing, football, dog-racing and other sports could afford the tax, but it was slowly killing county cricket. He was sorry to see that the Football Association and the football coupon businesses were now extending their activities right into the summer, and this had to be watched carefully. He also denounced freak declarations and said, They are not good for cricket. There were some curious happenings last season, and under the present system of scoring in the County Championship a club appears to need the services of a skilled mathematician to advise whether an innings should be declared or whether a side should bat at all!\n\nUnmarried, Sir Charles did not leave any heir, and with his death the Baronetcy, bestowed on him in 1922, became extinct.\n\nKEMP, MR. HAROLD FITCH, youngest of the four brothers who played for Harrow, died at Harpenden, Herts, on March 2, in his 75th year. In the XI two years 1885 and 1886, he was unfortunate in his experiences at Lord's.\n\nKITCAT, MR. SIDNEY AUSTYN PAUL, an accomplished batsman for Marlborough in 1885 and 1886, and for Gloucestershire when able to appear in county cricket until 1904, died at Esher, aged 73, on June 17. In 1896, at Bristol, he scored 77 not out, helping W. G. Grace, who made 301, put on 193 for the ninth wicket against Sussex. Another good display was in 1897, when his 93 not out off the Middlesex bowling was largely responsible for his inclusion in the Gentlemen's XI against Players at the Oval. Business prevented him from playing much first-class cricket, but he was very prominent in the Esher eleven for many seasons, and when over 70 years of age he captained the veterans against the colts in their annual match. He went to Portugal in 1895 and 1898 with teams captained by Mr. T. Westray.\n\nWhen captain of Marlborough in 1886, his second season in the eleven, and Rugby won by 37 runs, Kitcat was the victim of an irregularity which certainly influenced the result. At that time Law 14 read:\n\nThe bowler may not change ends more than twice in the same innings, nor bowl more than two overs in succession.\n\nThe Rugby bowlers and the umpires were responsible for the error. C. W. Bengough, the Rugby captain, went on to bowl twice at each end, and in his first over when bowling a second time from the pavilion end, Kitcat, when well set, was caught at cover-point for 27. The umpires after discussion gave Kitcat out, and Mr. Perkins, the M.C.C. secretary, supported the verdict; but Bengough, after completing the over, was not allowed to bowl another ball in the innings. Much argument and correspondence ensued, and largely because of this incident the law was amended in 1889, allowing a bowler to change ends as often as he pleases provided that he does not bowl two consecutive overs in one innings.\n\nKitcat played Rugby football for the College and Marlborough Nomads; also hockey for Marlborough, Moseley, Middlesex, Surrey, the South, and England.\n\nLAWSON-SMITH, MR. EDWARD MAULE, who played for Harrow two years, died in York on November 20, aged 83. In his second match at Lord's in 1878, when Harrow won by 20 runs, he took four wickets and made 66, the highest innings for either side. He was run out in each innings. Lord Hawke and the brothers G. B. and C. T. Studd were in the Eton XI. For twenty-five years he was hon. secretary and treasurer of the Yorkshire Gentlemen's club and was well known in hunting circles. He added Smith to his name in 1880.\n\nLEE, MR. EDWARD CORNWALL, an old Wykehamist and Oxford Blue, died at Petersfield on June 16, aged 64. A very good bowler of medium pace with easy action, his most memorable performance was at Lord's in 1898, when, taking seven wickets for 57 (five for 31 in the Cambridge first innings), he was largely responsible for Oxford winning by nine wickets. For Winchester in 1896 he dismissed five Etonians for 98 in a total of 343, but next year, when Winchester avenged the previous defeat, his share of the twenty Eton wickets was only two. He made occasional appearances for Hampshire from 1896 to 1909, but seldom caused serious trouble to county batsmen. He played golf for Oxford--1898 to 1900--and ice hockey against Cambridge in 1900. He went to America with P. F. Warner's team in 1898, and to West Indies with B. J. T. Bosanquet's side in 1902.\n\nLE FLEMING, MR. JOHN, M.A., a valuable batsman at Tonbridge School in 1882-1884 and, when available, for Kent from 1889 to 1899, died at Montreux in Switzerland on October 9, within a few days of completing 77 years. Of medium height and build, he showed good style in defence and hitting. He played his best innings for the county in 1892 at Hove, scoring 134 off the Sussex bowlers while 188 were added to the score. Using the drive and cut with effect, he could pay a punishing game, but was inconsistent. He fielded well in the deep. In 1884 he went to Holland with Tonbridge Rovers and made many runs for the Tonbridge Club, a notable innings being 228 against Southborough in 1889. At Cambridge he did not appear in the cricket eleven, but speed as a three-quarter-back got his Rugby football Blue in 1884. He appeared altogether three times against Oxford, the last two of these matches being won by the Light Blues. In 1887, when a member of Blackheath, he took part in a drawn match between England and Wales. A very good athlete, he won the hurdles for Cambridge and the amateur championship 120 yards hurdle race in 1887. A year later, when representing Cambridge for the third time, he again proved victorious in the hurdles. He also excelled as a skater, and he won the Challenge Bowl and Shield given by the Davos Platz Club for figure competitions in 1893.\n\nLEPPER, THE REV. CANON ARTHUR LINDSAY, Vicar of Huddersfield, who played cricket for Dublin University, being captain in 1906, died on February 14, aged 58.\n\nLOVE, MR. HARRY, who played sometimes for Sussex in 1892 and 1893, died at Hastings on March 27, aged 70.\n\nLUCAS, MR. ROBERT SLADE, who died on January 5, aged 74, was a valuable batsman for Middlesex during ten years at the end of last century. Perhaps his best innings in first-class cricket was 97 against Surrey at the Oval in 1894, when Lockwood and Richardson were at the top of their form. Next season he was good enough to play in every match for the powerful Middlesex batting side. His highest innings came in a heavy scoring match at Hove in June 1895. The aggregate amounted to 1,259 for 28 wickets, a high figure at that time. Lucas made 185, and with T. C. O'Brien (202) put on 338 at the rate of a hundred runs an hour for the fifth wicket; the Middlesex total reached 566. That season he played for Gentlemen against Players at the Oval. R. S. Lucas went to America with Lord Hawke's team in the autumn of 1894, and he captained the first English team that visited West Indies. In a remarkable match during that tour, Barbados in their first innings scored 517 and gained a lead of 206; but the touring side won by 25 runs. Prominent for Richmond and Teddington in London club cricket, Lucas also played for Old Merchant Taylors', and in 1891, in a not-out innings of 141 at Charterhouse Square against the School, which he had captained in 1885, he hit the ball out of the ground seven times, twice in succession through the same window of a private house. He played hockey for England.\n\nLYTTELTON, REV. THE HON. DR. EDWARD, youngest but one and last survivor of eight sons of the 4th Lord Lyttelton, seven of whom played for Eton during the period 1857 to 1875, died on January 26 at Lincoln. Born on July 23, 1855, he was 86 years old. Less tall than some of his brothers, he was nearly six feet and well proportioned--in fact the ideal build for sport. Great at the Field and Wall games at Eton, he played Association for England against Scotland in 1878. He excelled at Fives and did well at the Long Jump and Weight Putting, but his great triumphs came on the cricket field. He played for Eton 1872 to 1874, finishing as captain, when his 58 went a long way towards beating Harrow by five wickets at Lord's, and there followed more brilliant achievements during four years in the Cambridge XI. Alternately he knew defeat and victory, the second success over Oxford coming when he led his side to victory by 238 runs; he contributed 53 and 10. His average of 29 for the season was remarkable in those days. That match came in the course of a wonderful experience for Edward Lyttelton at Lord's. With scores of 44 and 66 he helped the Gentlemen to beat the Players by 206 runs; the match produced 1,066 runs, the only aggregate of four figures that season. Then E. Lyttelton led Cambridge to victory by an innings and 72 runs over the Australian team. This concluded the Cambridge programme of eight matches, all won decisively against powerful opponents, four with an innings to spare. Edward Lyttelton was unlucky, for, after hitting three fours and a three, he was run out. Before these three games Edward Lyttelton scored the only hundred hit against that first Australian team captained by D. W. Gregory. The match holds a special place in the history of the game for several reasons. It took place soon after the dismissal of M.C.C. for 19 runs by the Australians, who in a victory attained in one day placed themselves in the front rank of cricket. On the morning of the Middlesex match the brothers Grace came to Lord's and fetched W. Midwinter, a member of the Australian team, to play at The Oval for Gloucestershire, the county of his birth, for whom he had appeared in the previous season. Then I. D. Walker, captain of an entirely amateur Middlesex team, took the unusual course in those days of putting theAustralians in to bat--the weather was fine after much rain. The county replied to a total of 165 with 111 for the loss of four men, A. J. Webbe making 50; but the innings closed for 11 more runs. T. W. Garrett altogether taking seven wickets for 38 runs. The Australians maintained their advantage, and Middlesex, wanting 284 to win, fared lamentably, losing four wickets with the total 14. Edward Lyttelton at this crisis scored 37 before stumps were drawn with the total 79 for six wickets.\n\nWisden describes how on the Saturday, in weather so hot that the glass stood at 105 in the sun, Edward Lyttelton hit so brilliantly that he made 10 runs in an over (four balls at that time) from Allan and 12 in an over from Spofforth, 31 runs in 14 minutes, and 57 out of 69 in 41 minutes, before Spofforth bowled H. R. Webbe for 17. E. Lyttelton went on hitting in superb style until last out to a catch at slip for 113, his 76 runs that morning having been made in 74 minutes. The very finest hitting display made in 1878. The Australians won by 98 runs.\n\nIn 1882 he was in the Cambridge Past and Present team that beat the Australians at Portsmouth by 20 runs.\n\nSplendid in style, Edward Lyttelton cut both late and square and drove to the off in the true Etonian manner with great power, and was a dashing field at long-leg or middle wicket off. He played sometimes for Worcestershire, and continued to assist Middlesex and other sides until 1882, when he gave up first-class cricket. He hit many hundreds in minor cricket, and in 1877 for Cambridge Long Vacation Club made 228 against M.C.C.\n\nAfter being an assistant master at Wellington and Eton, he became headmaster at Haileybury until he returned to Eton in 1905, remaining headmaster until 1916, when he retired.\n\nMcCORMICK, MR. EDWARD JAMES, a well-known Hastings sportsman, specially prominent at cricket, died in Ireland in January, aged 79. He began young, playing when 15 for Hastings and District against the first Australian team in 1878. Appearing first for Sussex in 1880 and finishing county cricket in 1890, he scored 1,345 runs, average 15.63, and, bowling medium-paced, took eighteen wickets. He fielded well at third man and in the deep. In 1889 he scored 20 and 25 not out for Gentlemen against a powerful team of Players in the Hastings festival and so helped largely to win the match by one wicket. As a memento of the occasion the Mayor of Hastings presented Mr. McCormick with a bat and said it was a great thing for the town that, among the many great players, a local man had been able to carry off the honours. For an eleven which he captained he hit 212 in 1885 on the Hastings ground, and when 56 years of age he made over a hundred in a single-wicket match on the same ground.\n\nMIDGLEY, MR. C. A., who played in four matches for Yorkshire in 1906 died in Bradford in June, aged 68. A useful bat, he scored 115 runs in those few games with an average of 28.75, and took eight wickets at 18.62 apiece. Actually, he was placed fourth in batting to Hirst, 2,164 runs, Denton, 1,905 runs, and Rhodes, 1,618 runs, while only Schofield Haigh and Hirst had better bowling averages--but their wickets were 161 and 201 respectively. Hirst accomplished his unique double record, and Rhodes also did the double that season.\n\nMIDLETON THE EARL OF, President of the Surrey Club in 1923 and for many years a vice-president and trustee, died on February 13, aged 85. Among his many activities he found time for much committee work and generally in furthering the interest of the County Club, besides constantly attending matches at the Oval. Objecting to excessive preparation of pitches, he preferred the kind of turf on his private ground at Peper Harow, Godalming, where he said that a match of four innings could be played to a finish between 11.30 and 6.30.\n\nMILLAR, MR. CHARLES CHRISTIAN HOYER, founder and for 55 years president of Rosslyn Park Rugby football Club, who died on November 22, aged 81, deserved mention in Wisden for a very special and unique reason. He undertook on his own initiative to weed Lord's turf, and Sir Francis Lacey, secretary of M.C.C., signed a deed of appointment making him Honorary Weedkiller to G.H.Q. Cricket. From 1919 to 1931 he kept up his task, being particularly busy on summer evenings after stumps were drawn, and his zeal often received comment from pressmen walking to the exit when their duties were done. Mr. Millar, according to his own reckoning, accounted for 624,000 victims, having spent 956 hours in his war against plantains and other unwanted vegetation.\n\nMILLS, MR. GEORGE, died at Auckland on March 13, aged 74. Very good both as a slow bowler and batsman, he kept his form for many years. In 1887 he showed his ability by taking ten wickets for 70 runs and scoring 39 not out against Wellington; nine years later he made the first century for Auckland, carrying his bat through the innings for 106, against the same opponents. He met various touring sides from Australia and Lord Hawke's team, captained by P. F. Warner, which went to New Zealand in the winter of 1902. His son, J. E. Mills, toured England with New Zealand teams in 1927 and 1931.\n\nNORTH, MR. T. H., well known in New Zealand cricket, died at Christchurch in October. He played for Canterbury from 1893 to 1897, being specially useful as a fast-medium bowler. Against Otago in 1896 he took five wickets for 13 runs, but in a low scoring match Canterbury were beaten by nine wickets. For his club-- Lancaster Park--he did many good performances. His son is chairman of the Canterbury Cricket Association management committee.\n\nOATES, LIEUT.-COL.WILLIAM COAPE, D.S.O., died in a nursing home on February 20, aged 79. Twelfth man for Harrow in 1879, he played a few times in 1881 and 1882 for Nottinghamshire, a very powerful side at that period.\n\nOHLSON, MR. F. H., for many years a prominent figure in Auckland cricket and Rugby football circles, especially on the administrative side of these games, died on May 20, aged 74. In representative cricket his best efforts were 59 not out against the New South Wales side which toured New Zealand in 1896, and 49 the same season against Wellington. He played also against other touring teams from Queensland, Melbourne, and Lord Hawke's side captained by P. F. Warner in 1902-03. He made many runs for the Parnell Club.\n\nO'NEIL, MR. ALFRED, a prominent figure in Scottish cricket, died on September 17, aged 66. For twenty years he played for the Brechin Club, being captain from 1908 to 1911, and took part in the club record first-wicket partnership, 171 against Edinburgh Schools. When associated with Aberdeenshire he acted as umpire in Scottish County Championship matches. A contributor to The Cricketer, he also wrote The History of Angus Cricket.\n\nOYSTON, CHARLES, who played occasionally for Yorkshire in the seasons 1900 to 1909, died during the summer, aged 73. Chosen first for the county when approaching middle life--31--his chance in the powerful side captained by Lord Hawke depended upon an accidental vacancy. With his bowling of varied pace he took 22 wickets at 29.86 runs each, and as batsman he scored 84 runs, average 7.63.\n\nPAPILLON, MR. GODFREY KEPPEL, who played for Northumberland, died on August 14, aged 74.\n\nPAYNE, MR. JOHN HENRY, who played a few times for Lancashire in 1880 and 1883, died at Victoria Park, Manchester, on January 24, in his 84th year.\n\nPILKINGTON, MR. HUBERT CARLISLE, youngest of three brothers who played cricket for Eton, died after two operations in a Hertfordshire nursing home on June 17. A first-rate batsman with admirable style, he enjoyed the highly acclaimed distinction of scoring a hundred when first appearing at Lord's--101 against Harrow in 1896. In three matches for Eton against Harrow he made 239 runs, average nearly 48. Eton were not fortunate at that time, and H. C. Pilkington, after taking part in two drawn games with Harrow, led the side in a match that ended in defeat by nine wickets, despite his good work as opening batsman.\n\nGetting his Oxford Blue in 1899 as a Freshman, he scored 93 in the second innings against Cambridge, and next season his 87 and 45 were prominent in an encounter memorable for the batting of R. E. Foster, whose 171 was then the highest score in a match between the Universities. He excelled at the Eton football games and at Fives. He was President of the Eton Society, 1897-98.\n\nBecoming a member of the London Stock Exchange in 1902, H. C. Pilkington found little time for first-class cricket, but played occasionally for Middlesex. During the last war he became an officer in a Guards machine-gun regiment. Born on October 25, 1879, at Woolton, Lancashire, he passed away in his 63rd year.\n\nPITON, MR. JOHN HENRY, who died at Johannesburg on July 20, was one of the best known early South African cricketers. A useful batsman and clever lob bowler, he played for Transvaal odds teams against the English touring teams of 1888-9, 1891-2 and 1898-9. He was a member of the Transvaal team that beat Kimberley in April 1890, and in the first Currie Cup match played, and next season at Johannesburg, in the second of the series, he took seven wickets for 82 and six for 122. The match produced 1,402 runs, Kimberly beating Transvaal by 58 on the seventh day. He also played for Natal in the Currie Cup and continued club cricket for many years.\n\nRITCHIE, CAPTAIN JAMES A., a fine player of many games, died during the summer of enteric fever in India. A fast bowler, he was among the best cricketers in Scotland, but earned chief fame as a Rugby football forward, playing against England, Ireland, and Wales, both in 1933, when Scotland won the Triple Crown, and in the following season. He also played water polo against these three countries.\n\nROBINSON, MR. EDWARD, who died on September 3 at Clifton, Bristol aged 79, played one match for Yorkshire in 1887, scoring 23. He settled in Bristol when married and was a familiar figure in Gloucestershire sporting circles.\n\nSANDFORD, MR. TEMPLE CHARLES GABRIEL, known to Marlburians for over half a century, died on December 27 at Wykeham House, Marlborough, aged 65. Very good in all games, he excelled at cricket, and during more than thirty years as a house master he coached on the playing fields with advantage to everyone. In the cricket eleven for three seasons, he batted so well in 1895 that he headed the Marlborough averages with 43.2, showing such fine form that W. J. Ford, in Wisden, included him among the best school batsmen of the year. He played in Freshmen and Seniors matches at Oxford and might have got his Blue, but, in competition with many brilliant batsmen, he did not reach the necessary high standard; and his skill as a wicket-keeper was not quite equal to that of R. W. Fox, while he was overshadowed by H. Martyn, incomparable behind the stumps.\n\nSIMMS, MR. HARRY LESTER, died on June 8, aged 54. For Sussex and Warwickshire he was a valuable player. When first playing he was a dashing, uncertain bat and moderate field, while his bowling was negligible, but after returning from a long stay in India he showed astonishing improvement, particularly as a bowler. He often batted admirably, fielded well, and at times his fastish bowling was deadly. In 1912 in all matches he scored 1,099 runs and took 110 wickets, being the only amateur, besides R. A. Faulkner of South Africa to achieve the double that season of the Triangular Tournament, when wet weather spoiled a lot of matches. That year Simms played twice for Gentlemen against Players. At the Oval he did little, but in a drawn match at Lord's he scored 22 and took seven wickets. He gave a remarkable display of hitting against Nottinghamshire at Hove, scoring 126, the fifth individual hundred in the match, in 85 minutes, and in the course of four overs getting 64 runs; there were ten 6's in his spectacular innings. After the last war he played occasionally for Warwickshire and regularly in Birmingham League Cricket. He played golf splendidly.\n\nSMITH, B. C., for twenty years a member of the Northamptonshire team, helping to raise the county from second-class rank, died at Northampton, aged 83, on November 29. A wicket-keeper of considerable ability, he often caused trouble as a batsman late on the list. He played only two seasons in first-class cricket, 1905 and 1906, and next year became an umpire on the first-class list.\n\nSMITH, MR. WILLIAM, who played for London County Club under W. G. Grace, and profited so much by his captain's coaching that in 1901 he averaged over 64, died in North Devon in April, aged 66. He won the match with M.C.C. at Lord's by four wickets with a splendid 61 not out, Walter Mead and Albert Trott being foremost in a powerful club attack. W. Smith scored 79 in the match without being dismissed. W. G. Grace in that engagement finished, in two days, took thirteen wickets for 110 runs--seven for 30 in the club's first innings. At Crystal Palace Smith made 143, highest score in a total of 578 against Cambridge University, who were beaten by an innings and 73 runs, Ranjitsinhji claiming six wickets for 53 in the Cambridge second innings and so contributing towards the defeat of his old University. W. Smith also played for Oxfordshire in the second class County Championship, and that season headed their averages with 43.80. He did not maintain anything like that form, but again headed the Oxfordshire averages with 36.16 in 1904.\n\nSNELL, MR. HAROLD SAXON, died at Daventry on July 9, aged 64. He played well at Dean Close School, Cheltenham, and for Wiltshire for some years from 1897. Not notable in cricket at Cambridge, he got his Association football Blue in 1900 and played for Corinthians.\n\nSTEWART, DR. HALDANE CAMPBELL, an attractive batsman for Kent when finding time for county cricket, died on June 16, aged 74. From 1892 to 1903 he was always a welcome member of the side, and he scored 2,846 runs in first-class cricket with an average of 22.76. He was a fine fieldsman. At Lord's in 1897 he made 142 against M.C.C., and played for Gentlemen against Players at Hastings in 1897. In 1903 he went with the Kent team to America. A prolific scorer for Blackheath, he showed to special advantage in an innings of 203 not out against Granville, Lee. A noted musician, H. C. Stewart was at different times a master at Lancing, Wellington, and Tonbridge schools, and was organist of Magdalen College, Oxford, from 1919 to 1938.\n\nSTEWART, MR. JOB HERCULES, died at Capetown on September 12, aged 62. A sound batsman for Western Province in three Currie Cup tournaments shortly after the Boer War, his highest score was 61 against Border at Capetown in 1904.\n\nSTONE, JAMES, Hampshire wicket-keeper and first-class umpire, died at Maidenhead on November 15, aged nearly 64. First tried for Hampshire in 1900, he found a regular place in the county eleven as wicket-keeper in 1902, and did valuable service, both behind the stumps and as batsman, until 1914 when war broke out. In three seasons, 1911-1913, his record exceeded a thousand runs. He did specially well in 1912, and helped to beat the Australians by eight wickets, the first victory by Hampshire over an Australian team. Directly after this fine performance Yorkshire visited Southampton, and Stone enjoyed the most successful benefit of any Hampshire professional up to that time. He went in first and helped C. B. Fry add 109 for the third wicket, Yorkshire being hard pressed until Hirst and Haigh caused a second innings collapse. Short, but strongly built, Stone was a smart, unobtrusive wicket-keeper and a steady batsman. After leaving Hampshire he played for Glamorgan, and then acted as a first-class umpire from 1925 to 1934. Altogether in first-class cricket he scored over 10,000 runs with an average of 22.\n\nSWANN-MASON, THE REV. R. S., O.B.E., who died on February 21, aged 70, was a member of the M.C.C., from 1907, and made a few appearances for the club in first-class cricket. Born at Cambridge, he went to Perse School before going to the University. In 1910 he scored 20 not out against Leicestershire at Lord's; four years later, against the University at Cambridge, 20 and 25, and he took many M.C.C. elevens to play against schools and clubs. Altogether in club cricket he scored seventy-five centuries, usually playing free cricket in admirable style. A chaplain in the Royal Navy during the last war, he was on H.M.S. Ocean when she was sunk. Afterwards vicar of Christ Church, Albany Street, London, he held that appointment until his death. At his funeral service Mr. Stanley Christopherson, President of M.C.C., read the lesson.\n\nTAYLOR, BRIG.-GENERAL REYNELL HAMILTON BAYLAY, C.B., died on March 23, at Ryde, aged 83. After playing good cricket at Cheltenham and Sandhurst, military duties in India and war service prevented him taking up first-class cricket, but he was a member of M.C.C., and played for Yorkshire Gentlemen.\n\nWARD, CAPTAIN THE HON. ROBERT ARTHUR, O.B.E., third son of the first Earl of Dudley, died at Rowley, Yorkshire, on June 14, aged 71. He played in the Eton XI mainly as a bowler, in 1888 and 1889; next year, when Master of the Beagles and President of the Eton Society, he won the mile race and steeplechase. He served with distinction in the South African and Great Wars and at one time was M.P. for the Crewe division of Cheshire.\n\nWHITWELL, MR. WILLIAM FRY, died in April, aged 74. During four seasons in the Uppingham XI he was useful both with bat and ball. When captain in 1886, he went in first, and a year later he made 181 for Redcar against Middlesbrough in the Cleveland Cup final tie. Born at Saltburn-on-Sea, he played in ten matches for Yorkshire in 1890, scoring few runs but taking 25 wickets at 20.72 runs apiece. Most of his county cricket was for Durham, and his fast bowling often proved devastating. In a twelve-a-side match against I Zingari he took 16 wickets for Gentlemen of Durham; against Warwickshire in 1891 at Stockton-on-Tees his figures showed 12 wickets for 55 runs, and in 1895 at Sunderland eight Lincolnshire batsmen fell to him for 18 runs. In 1900 he took part in the Gentlemen and Players match at Scarborough. He toured America with Lord Hawke's team in 1894, and in the match against Philadelphia at Havenford his first innings analysis read four wickets for 14, and he headed the bowling averages for the tour with 18 at 6.12. Above medium height and strongly built, he put much energy into his attack and fielded with dash at cover-point or mid-off.\n\nWILLIAMS, MR. C. H., a Vice-President and member of the Lancashire County Club General Committee, died during the summer.\n\nWOMERSLEY, MR. DALE, who was in the Marlborough XI 1878 with A. G. Steel, and afterwards played for Essex, died in August, aged 82. Of medium height but strongly built, he batted well and fielded smartly--usually at cover-point.\n\nWOOLF, MR. LOUIS SYDNEY, who played for Victoria against New South Wales in 1877, and lived to be the oldest representative of his State, died in August. For South Melbourne he was prominent in club cricket, and played also for his University. A barrister, he often appeared for The Bar against The Army--popular matches in Australia early this century.\n\nYEARWOOD, THE HON. LAURIE, O.B.E., whose death early in the year was announced in The Cricketer, with an appreciation by W. J. Anderson, stood out on the administrative side of cricket in West Indies. Not until after the visit of the M.C.C. team in 1925-26 did West Indies have a representative governing body; Laurie Yearwood founded and was first president of the Board of Control which united cricket in all the widely spread islands. Captain of the Pickwick Club and wicket-keeper for Barbados before the last war, he was chairman in 1928 of the first official Selection Committee which chose touring teams. He actually discovered G. N. Francis, the fast bowler, whose obituary also appears in this issue of Wisden. Known as the G.O.M. of cricket in West Indies, he was a prominent merchant and member of the House of Assembly.\n\nYOUNG, SIR ALFRED KARNEY, prominent in cricket at Rochester, who played for Kent once in 1887 and again in 1890, died at Cape Town, where he was a resident magistrate, on January 5, aged 76. A sound, steady batsman, he showed special skill in placing the ball off his legs and late cutting.\n\n\u00a9 John Wisden & Co"}, {"url": "https://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/229835.html", "page_content": "1942\n\nObituaries in 1941\n\nBAILY, MR. EDWARD PETER, died at Tupsley, Hereford, on January 21, aged 89. A very good wicket-keeper and useful batsman, he played in the Harrow XI from 1869 to 1871, finishing as captain, and was in the Cambridge XI 1872 and 1874. One of his best performances was against Eton at Lord's in 1870, when he scored 76. He appeared once for Middlesex in 1872 and for Somerset in 1881. He rowed in the Cambridge trial Eights in 1873 and did not keep his place in the cricket eleven that year.\n\nBERESFORD, MR. RICHARD AUGUSTUS AGINCOURT, who died at Derby on July 12, aged 71, scored heavily in school and club cricket, but just failed to get his Blue at Cambridge in 1890, and next season he received a less extended trial. S. M. J. Woods and Gregor MacGregor were the captains of very strong elevens in those years. He played for Northamptonshire under the birth qualification, and also for Norfolk. When at Oundle he accomplished an extraordinary performance in scoring 102 not out and 307 not out for School House v. Laxton House in May 1888, besides dismissing seven men in an innings. Next month he hit up 225 for the School against The Past and again was not out. He captained the Oundle XI in 1887 and 1888 and was in every way a good cricketer, his fast bowling getting many wickets. A capable athlete, he twice appeared at Queen's Club in the University Sports, being second in Putting the Weight, with 34 ft. 8\u00bd in. in 1891, and third next year with 34 ft. 11 in.\n\nBIDDLE, MR. LYNFORD, died at Philadelphia, his birthplace, on January 24, aged 65. A capable left-handed batsman, he visited England with the Gentlemen of Philadelphia in 1897, but, though averaging 13.54, his highest innings was 30 not out. At home in 1893 he made 102 for Philadelphia Summer XI against Wayne and 117 not out for Germanstown against Y.M.C.A. Very safe in defence, he often withstood a strong attack with marked patience, and he could hit hard.\n\nBROMLEY-MARTIN, MR. GRANVILLE EDWARD, died at Hassocks, Sussex, on May 31, aged 65. Getting into the Eton XI in 1892, he was captain in the next two years, and played for Oxford in 1897 and 1898. A very good batsman, free and stylish in stroke play, he finished at Eton top of the averages with 38.80, but his best score in the big matches was 68 against Harrow when first playing at Lord's. Neither did he do much against Cambridge, but at Hove in 1897 he scored 137 for Oxford against Sussex. He played a good deal for Worcestershire, and in 1899, when his county was promoted to first-class rank, he made 129 in the Derbyshire match at Worcester. He and H. K. Foster added 207 in two hours. His innings finished in a curious way. A piece of his bat broke off in playing Hancock and the ball went almost straight up. L. G. Wright dashed in from point and just held the catch. A week later at Southampton he had a very different experience; the first ball he received in each innings proved fatal, C. Heseltine, the fast bowler, twice beating him completely.\n\nCASE, MR. THOMAS BENNETT, died near Dublin on November 10, in his seventieth year. In his third year in the Winchester XI, when captain, he scored 61 and 31 against Eton, going in first and literally leading his side to victory by 114 runs. Because of an accident to the Hon. F. J. N. Thesiger, Case completed the Oxford XI in 1891, when Cambridge won by two wickets; next year he was not out with Lionel Palairet, whose 71 was largely responsible for Oxford's victory by five wickets. M. R. Jardine did still more towards the triumph, making 140 and 39. Case scored 29 on the first day, giving useful help to Jardine and V. T. Hill. The match aroused great interest. The aggregate runs, 1,100, far exceeded any previous scoring in the University encounter; Jardine's 179 runs beat the total credited to any batsman hitherto; Cambridge in their follow-on equalled the record total of 388 made in 1872 by the Light Blues, and E. C. Streatfeild hit the third century in the match. Also J. B. Wood, a lob bowler, opened the Oxford attack and, with seven wickets in the two Cambridge innings, was surpassed in this game only by F. S. Jackson, who took eight Oxford wickets.\n\nCHIDGEY, HARRY, who died in November at his birthplace, Flax Bourton, aged 62, occupies a special place in Somerset cricket as the one professional intervening in a long reign of amateur wicket-keepers. A. E. Newton, the Rev. A. P. Wickham and H. Martyn shared the duty from 1891 to 1908, when Chidgey came to the front six years after playing once for the County as an amateur at Bath. Until the last war he lightened the work still undertaken by Newton whenever possible, and he resumed in 1919. Two years later Chidgey recorded a batting average which seldom can have had a parallel. Playing twelve innings he made 48 runs, with a highest score of 18, but ten not outs gave him an average of 24: His best score for Somerset was 45 in 1909 against Yorkshire at Bath. Sent in late on the Tuesday evening, he stayed altogether 85 minutes with Len Braund and so helped Somerset draw the match very creditably. That season he averaged 13.33 for 120 runs in 15 innings, with six not outs. After the war M. D. Lyon maintained the Somerset tradition of amateur keepers. Chidgey ranks high in this art among all the Somerset talent. He made 120 catches and stumped 50 batsmen, figures that place him for the County next to A. E. Newton, who held 250 catches and stumped 112 men. Rather small, quick and neat, Chidgey was a good keeper. He was given a place in his local club team when fourteen and was honorary secretary when the present war broke out. As a member of the Long Ashton Urban District Council he enjoyed much popularity.\n\nCOLE, MR. FREDERICK LIVESAY, an occasional wicket-keeper for Gloucestershire from 1879, when he first appeared at Lord's, died at Sheffield on July 1. While he would be a useful cricketer to pass muster with W. G. Grace as captain, a more interesting point that his prowess behind the stumps concerns his age. In Scores and Biographies the date of his birth is given as October 4, 1856. This tallied with Wisden until 1934, when the year was altered to 1842--a possible misprint due to re-setting Births and Deaths. Yorkshire papers described how he joined the Federal Army when 19 and served four years under Generals McClellan and Phil Sheridan; also that during the Franco-Prussian war he was in the siege of Paris and that he was with Sir Archibald Forbes, the war correspondent, in the Russo-Turkish war before being invalided home in 1876. Inquiries at the Bristol Grammar school, where he was said to have been educated, failed to trace him, neither can any mention of his name between 1837 and 1887 be found in the Registers of the Yeovil district, though his birth-place was recorded at Ilminster, together with the date, at the time of his first match at Lord's.\n\nIn response to a question in the Bristol Evening Post, Mr. Harry Wookey wrote that he played with Fred Cole for Schoolmasters against Bath Association in 1880, when I was only 17 years of age. Fred Cole was born on October 4, 1856. Another Bristol cricketer confirmed that opinion. Yet it was asserted in the Yorkshire papers that he was 90 when he retired from the Sheffield Gas Company, though no one knew his exact age and thought he was 60: George, one of the centenarian brothers, could not be traced in Bristol.\n\nFred Cole made plenty of runs in club cricket and H. E. Roslyn, of the Gloucestershire County Committee, recalls that Fred Cole scored the first hundred ever made on our county ground and I kept wicket while he did so--that was the year before the formal opening in 1889.\n\nCURSHAM, MR. HENRY ALFRED, who died on August 6, aged 81 earned chief fame in sport at Association football in the Notts County eleven and for England in the early eighties; but he was a good cricketer and, during a long career with Notts Amateur C.C., twice appeared for the County. Against Surrey in 1880 William Gunn also was taking his first trial in the side; a small-scoring match was drawn. In 1904, when A. O. Jones rested, Cursham captained the County against South Africans in a very different kind of game. He scored 12 and 25 not out in totals of 320 and 242, but Notts were weak and suffered defeat by an innings and 49 runs. Cursham was on the Nottinghamshire Club Committee for several years.\n\nDILLON, MR. EDWARD WENTWORTH, whose death at the age of 60 occurred on April 26, was a brilliant left-handed batsman when at Rugby and Oxford University before doing splendid service for Kent, his county experiences extending altogether from 1900 to 1913. He practically finished his county career by his leading Kent to the championship, so repeating an achievement which stood to his name in 1909 and 1910. In this way Dillon surpassed the efforts of any of his Kent predecessors. In fact, not until C. H. B. Marsham succeeded J. R. Mason--an outstanding personality in the game for several years--did Kent first secure the honours in 1906. Yet Mason resumed as leader for the last month of the 1909 season, when Dillon stopped playing for business reasons--often a preventive of continuous cricket for him. These great cricketers had with them K. L. Hutchings--a superb batsman and fieldsman--the brothers S. H. and A. P. Day, Frank Woolley, Humphreys, Colin Blythe--taker of 178 wickets at 14 runs apiece--Arthur Fielder, Fred Huish and D. W. Carr.\n\nDillon earned early fame by heading the Rugby averages in 1899 and 1900, the second time with 56.36 for 620 runs and a highest innings of 157. He made 110 not out when 190 were hit off in two hours at Lord's and Marlborough were beaten by nine wickets within fifteen minutes of time. He also took six wickets for 84 runs with his slow left-hand bowling. Described in Wisden as the best school batsman of the year having also covered himself with glory for Kent--his average was 36.50 in eight innings-- Dillon maintained his form and seldom disappointed his side when returning to the game after an interval with little practice. A notable example of this was at the Oval in 1913 when he scored 135 in a vain attempt to save his county from defeat.\n\nWhen he got his Blue as a freshman the University match was drawn, and his best effort was 143 against Somerset when Oxford were hopelessly placed. He proved very useful for Kent, being second in the averages to Mason, with 103 not out his highest score. Despite his fine displays for 85 and 59, Oxford lost at Lord's next year, S. H. Day, his Kent colleague, batting grandly for 117 not out and helping largely towards the Cambridge triumph. After being the chief batsman at Oxford in his second year, Dillon went into business and gave his spells of leisure to Kent cricket. His best years were 1905, average 48.51, and 1906, average 43.23, and he played many of his highest innings as opening batsman. The powerful Yorkshire attack suffered from Dillon's onslaught at Dewsbury in 1910, a grandly hit 138 starting Kent on the road to victory by nine wickets. In the return at Maidstone his vigorous 49 paved the way for a triumph by 178; Colin Blythe and Woolley bowled unchanged in both Yorkshire innings. Altogether in first-class cricket Dillon scored 10,353 runs, average 28.20.\n\nVery free in style, Dillon used his long reach to the best advantage. Going in to meet the ball, he drove straight and to the off with great power and placed his forcing strokes skilfully. He made two tours abroad--to West Indies with B. J. T. Bosanquet's side in 1902 and next year with the Kent team to America.\n\nDillon took the highest honours in Rugby football. Developing into a splendid three-quarter when playing for Blackheath, he was capped against Scotland, Ireland and Wales in 1904 and next season against Wales.\n\nDOULTON, MR. HUBERT VICTOR, died at Esher on March 2, aged 77. A very useful player in the Dulwich College XI, 1881, 1882, he showed good form at Oxford, but, though tried in the Seniors match in 1884, he could not find a place in the very strong University side which beat Cambridge that year by seven wickets. He maintained his association with Dulwich College during forty years as a master.\n\nEASTMAN, LAWRENCE C., the Essex all-rounder, who was born at Enfield, died in Harefield Sanatorium on April 17, following an operation, at the age of 43. His end was hastened through a high-explosive bomb bursting close to him while he was performing his duties as an A.R.P. warden. This caused him severe shock.\n\nFor many years Eastman did not enjoy the best of health, otherwise there can be no doubt he would have been seen to much greater advantage on the cricket field. He intended to take up medicine as a profession, but the Great War, in which he won the D.C.M. and M.M., forced him to give up the idea, and he became interested in cricket. Those great Essex stalwarts, J. W. H. T. Douglas, Percy Perrin, Charles McGahey, A. C. Russell and Bob Carpenter, helped in his development. Eastman began playing for the Country as an amateur and, in his first match, against Gloucestershire at Bristol in 1920, he took three wickets in four balls. Next he appeared at Lord's, and going in number ten when Russell had hit 100, he scored 91, the pair adding 175 before stumps were drawn for the day. In 1922 Eastman was appointed Assistant-Secretary at Leyton and became a regular member of the County team. He gave up the position in 1926 and turned professional.\n\nStanding six feet, he was a natural hitter and proved most successful when opening the innings. Indeed, in 1925 against Lancashire at Leyton, he and Cutmore made opening stands of 115 and 172. Eastman never hesitated to use the straight drive, which, beautifully executed, often earned him six, and he also hooked well. In his early days he bowled medium pace, but served Essex best when he changed to spin; he could turn the ball each way and was particularly deadly with the leg-break. He naively remarked that he gained more pleasure from slow bowling and delighted in pitting his brains against batsmen with flight and spin instead of relying solely on pace and swerve. Against Somerset at Weston-super-Mare in 1934 his first-innings analysis was four wickets for no run, when he dismissed A. W. Willard, R. A. Ingle, G. M. Bennett and H. L. Hazell in 13 deliveries and ended the innings.\n\nAltogether in first-class cricket Eastman scored 12,481 runs and took 967 Wickets. His highest score was 161 at Derby in 1929, but he considered his best performances was against Sussex at Leyton in 1922, when, besides taking twelve wickets for 82 runs, he went in last but one and made 37 not out.\n\nEastman used to say that he had batted in every position except number eleven; but curiously enough, in his benefit match with Middlesex at Southland in 1939, which realised \u00a31,200, he was lamed by water on the knee and so compelled to go in last; otherwise Essex might have won instead of losing by five runs.\n\nHe paid three visits as coach to New Zealand, besides rendering similar service at Kimberley, South Africa, and in 1937 he was a member of the team which toured the Argentina. When war broke out, Eastman helped London Counties, and was particularly proud of being captain when the side first appeared at Lord's.\n\nEYRE, MR. JOHN, who died on November 24, aged 82, played in the Winchester XI 1876-1878. His best score against Eton was 40 not out. He did not take a prominent part in cricket at Oxford, but, very versatile at Association football, he kept goal against Cambridge in 1879, and in the following season appeared in the forward line: Cambridge won both matches, played at Kennington Oval.\n\nFORD, MR. HENRY JUSTICE, the fourth in seniority and last survivor of the seven brothers, all prominent in the Repton School XI, died on November 19, aged 81. Six of the brothers captained the eleven, and the second would have done so had he not left school the same year as his eldest brother--W. J. Of these six, who all went to Cambridge, three got cricket Blues--W. J., A. F. J., F. G. J.--and the other three First Classes. As F. G. J. once wrote, The Blues did not get First Classes. True to the family type, Henry Ford used his physique, six feet tall and weight 14 stone, in powerful hitting. He bowled slow round-arm and did well in the long field. In a Long Vacation Club match at Cambridge on August 10, 1882, he played a great innings of 295, but was not consistent enough to shine against the best bowlers. An artist from an early age, he became well known as a gifted imaginative illustrator of books for children.\n\nFOWLER, MR. WILLIAM HERBERT, died on April 13, aged 84. Educated at Rottingdean and Grove House School, Tottenham, he played for Essex in 1877, and two years later appeared for Somerset with marked success, averaging 23 and doing the best bowling. Over six feet three inches in height and more than fourteen stone in weight, he put great force into his strokes. One hit off W.G. Grace at Gloucester carried 154 yards, and also in 1882 at Lord's he drove a ball from George Hay 157 yards, as measured by Tom Hearne, head of the ground staff. This was a remarkable match, M.C.C. winning by one wicket after Fowler had done the hat-trick in the club's first innings. When M.C.C. visited Taunton later in the season, Fowler scored 139, and for M.C.C. against Oxford University at Lord's in 1884 he made the large proportion of 60 runs out of 68 while he was at the wicket.\n\nAn accomplished golfer, he played for England against Scotland in 1903 and two following years. He designed the Walton Heath and many other well-known courses in England and America. Maintaining a close connection with Somerset, he was a trustee of the County Ground at Taunton.\n\nGODFREY, REV. CHARLES JOHN MELVILLE, died on September 28, in his 79th year. A force in club cricket, he played for many years with success as a free-scoring batsman and a very fast bowler. He appeared for many clubs besides Hastings in Sussex, also for Incogniti and Winchester, but was best known as captain of Granville Lee in Kent. At Oxford in 1883 to 1885, he found a place in the University eleven occasionally, without getting his Blue, and assisted Sussex in four matches-- 1885 to 1892. When at Magdalen College School he threw the cricket ball 114 yards. Closely in touch with Surrey cricket, Mr. Godfrey was on the County Committee from 1917 to 1922 and from 1924 to 1932. For many years he was Vicar of South Beddington.\n\nHART, MR. HAROLD B., who played for Cambridgeshire from 1913 to 1935 and for several seasons combined the offices of captain and joint secretary, died late in December, aged 54. A very good batsman, he scored consistently in second-class county matches.\n\nHAYMAN, THE REV. CANON HENRY TELFORD, died in his 88th year on February 8, at Cheltenham. After being in the Bradfield XI he went to Cambridge, but did not get his Blue. Born at West Malling, he played for Kent in two matches, one in 1873 being the only fixture kept in connection with the Cup offered by M.C.C. for competition among invited counties at Lord's. Sussex were beaten by 52 runs. Although on that occasion bowled in each innings for one run by James Lillywhite, Jnr., Hayman was described as fine batsman; also a good long-stop.\n\nHEWETT, SIR JOHN PRESCOTT, G.C.S.I., K.B.E., C.I.E., died at The Court House, Chipping Warden, Banbury, on September 27, aged 87. After being in the 1873 Winchester XI he went to Oxford before entering the Indian Civil Service. He held many important positions and became Lieutenant-Governor of United Provinces, India from 1907 to 1912. In 1911 he organised King George V's Coronation Durbar at Delhi. On returning to England permanently he was M.P. for Luton and prominent in many London business concerns.\n\nHEWITT, MR. COPLEY DE LISLE, Clerk to the Commissioners of Taxes for the City of London, died at Aylesford, Kent, on September 30. He captained Charterhouse at both cricket and football and got his Association Blue at Oxford in 1893 and two following seasons.\n\nHOARE, REV. ARTHUR ROBERTSON, died at Ashill Rectory, near Thetford, on March 18, aged 69. He opened the bowling and batted well at number three for the Eton XI of 1890, but did not gain his cricket Blue at Cambridge. He was a welcome acquisition whenever available for Norfolk. Very good at Association football, he got his Cambridge Blue in 1893. A chaplain to the Forces in the South African War, he also acted in this capacity during the Great War 1914--1918.\n\nHOARE, MAJOR WALTER ROBERTSON, died at Lychpit on July 1, aged 73. The last to die of three brothers, who, like their father the Rev. W. M. Hoare were in the Eton cricket XI, the VIII, Field XI, and represented the College at Fives. In business Walter was a brewer, and because of their professions the brothers were known as Bung, Bishop, and Bank. They all played for Norfolk.\n\nHUSON, MR. ARTHUR CLIVE a master at Eton, died on July 6, aged 52. He scored 116 in a total of 238 for Winchester at the start of the match against Eton in 1908, but his side lost by an innings and 14 runs. A steady batsman with plenty of strokes and strong defence, Huson played in the Oxford Freshmen and Seniors matches, but his form was uncertain and he never appeared for the University. During the Great War he served in the Garrison Artillery, rising to the rank of captain.\n\nHUTCHISON, MAJOR CECIL KEY, died in a nursing home on March 25, aged 64. An opening batsman for Eton in 1896, he earned much higher fame at golf than at cricket. One of the greatest golfers of his day, he lost the Amateur Championship of 1909 by a single hole. From 1904 to 1912 he regularly played for Scotland against England and twice won the St. George's Challenge Cup-- 1903 and 1910. He was a prisoner for four years in Germany during the Great War.\n\nJACKSON, MR. SAMUEL ROBINSON, was closely devoted to the welfare of the Yorkshire County Club from early manhood until his death at Leeds on July 19, soon after entering his 83rd year. He played a few matches for Yorkshire in 1891, then represented Leeds on the Committee, and was a Vice-President for many years. When the Scarborough ground was opened, on the occasion of a match between the Leeds and the Scarborough clubs, he received the first ball bowled.\n\nJESSOP, MR. OSMAN WALTER TEMPLE, younger brother of G. L. Jessop of free-scoring fame for Cambridge, Gloucestershire and England, died on May 25, aged 63. He showed promise at Cheltenham and appeared twice for Gloucestershire in 1901 and 1911, but could give very little time to first-class cricket.\n\nJOHNSON, MR. W. J., one of the Australian Test Selection Committee, died at Melbourne, aged 57, on August 14. In early life he captained the North Melbourne club and Victoria Second XI. A sound batsman and clever slow bowler, he was a useful all-round player. His son, I. W. Johnson, who has made a name for Victoria, joined the Air Force. Mr. Johnson came to England with the Australian 1930 team, captained by W. M. Woodfull, and made many friends,\n\nMACPHERSON, MR. ROBERT, who died at Brooklyn, N.Y., on March 9 aged 65, was educated at the High School, Dunfermline--his birthplace--and played for Fifeshire before going to the United States in the Fall of 1906. A very good opening batsman, he showed to advantage for the Brooklyn, Bensonhurst and Crescent Athletic clubs. He gave very fine displays in two not-out centuries for Bensonhurst.\n\nMARSH, REV. THEODORE HENRY, died on October 14, aged 78. On leaving Bishop's Stortford College he went to Cambridge and took many wickets in college matches with his fast right-hand bowling. From 1888 he was useful for Norfolk, but could not play often in county cricket. A clever Association football forward, he was in the 1885 Cambridge XI which included such noted players as W. N. Cobbold, T. Lindley, A. Amos, A. M. Walters, B. W. Spilsbury and F. E. Saunders--all internationals. He also represented Cambridge in the High Jump.\n\nNEWNHAM, LIEUT.-COLONEL ARTHUR TRISTRAM HERBERT, died in Newton Abbot Hospital on December 29, aged nearly 81. After three years in the Malvern XI he went to Sandhurst, and served mostly in The Army abroad or he would have made a big name in English cricket. Playing first for Gloucestershire in 1887 at Lord's, he scored 25 not out, helping W. G. Grace to add 84 for the ninth wicket before the champion was leg-before to A. J. Webbe for 113. Rain ruined the pitch, but Newnham, with 20, was best scorer in the second innings, and then he and W. G. dismissed A. E. Stoddart, A. J. Webbe, S. W. Scott and T. C. O'Brien, the four best Middlesex batsmen, for 25 before the match was left drawn. At Gloucester against Yorkshire, when W. G. Grace scored 92 and carried his bat through the second innings for 183, Newnham, 56, took part in an eighth-wicket stand for 143. Played primarily as a fast bowler, Newnham appeared for Gentlemen against Players at the Oval that season. For many years he was prominent in cricket abroad, particularly at Bombay.\n\nNORMAN, DR. JAMES EARL, M.A., LL.D., for many years secretary of the Hertfordhire County Club and hon. secretary of the Minor Counties Association, of which he was elected president in 1938, died at his home at St. Albans on March 3, aged 72. He had been a member of M.C.C. since 1902. His work for the Minor Counties was of great value.\n\nNORRIS, MR. EDWARD, died on January 15, at Philadelphia, aged 72. A good batsman during many years, he gave a particularly able exhibition in 1900 when for All Philadelphia against all New York he hit up 152.\n\nO'CONNOR, MR. J. A., who toured England in 1909 with M. A. Noble's Australian team, died at Sydney in November, aged 66. A rather slow bowler, he relied on speed from the pitch and did not find the comparatively slow turf in England suitable to his methods. He played only in the first of the five Test matches, and that was the one which England won before Australia recovered and carried off the honours. Until late in the season he seldom accomplished anything notable against any strong batting side, but on the whole tour O'Connor took 85 wickets at 19 runs apiece. He sometimes played for Australia at home, and altogether in Test cricket his bowling record showed 13 wickets, average 29 runs each. He played for both New South Wales and South Australia. His best performance was 7 wickets for 36 runs at Melbourne in January 1909; thanks to his effort, South Australia, after being 219 runs behind on the first innings, snatched a victory by 15 runs.\n\nPARRIS, FREDERICK, a medium-paced bowler for Sussex during the nineties and a first-class umpire for some years, died on January 17, aged 74. He rose to fame in county cricket under the captaincy of W. L. Murdoch, the famous Australian, and no doubt he learned much from Alfred Shaw, who resumed first-class cricket in 1894 when engaged by Lord Sheffield after retiring from the Nottinghamshire side. Then 52, Shaw retained his accuracy of length and power in spinning the ball so well that he headed the Sussex averages with 41 wickets at 12.24, Parris coming next with 63 at 13.44 runs apiece. Off-break and slightly varied pace made Parris deadly on a pitch giving any help. Seizing such an opportunity at Bristol, he took 15 Gloucestershire wickets--including that of W. G. Grace twice--at a cost of 98 runs in one day. Another very good performance was at Catford, ten Kent wickets for 58 runs, and a handsome victory again resulted. Fred Tate, after some decline from his early effectiveness, became the best Sussex bowler in the following season, with Parris next in general utility if expensive, his 50 wickets costing 31 runs apiece. Parris never fulfilled expectations, his moderate days coming too frequently. Of medium height and sturdily built, Parris batted left-handed, but runs were seldom wanted from him in a side containing C. B. Fry, K. S. Ranjitsinhji, as they came from the Universities, W. Newham, still on the list of Sussex officials at the age of 81, George Brann, also of Ardingly, Killick and Marlow, besides the captain.\n\nIn club cricket Parris did some remarkable things, once taking 18 out of 20 wickets in a match; and at Bexhill in 1903 he hit twenty-three 4's in an innings of 105.\n\nPEEL, ROBERT, who died at Morley, on August 12, aged 84, was one of the finest all-round cricketers of any time. Primarily he was a bowler, the second in the remarkable succession of slow left-handers--Edmund Peate, Peel, Wilfred Rhodes and Hedley Verity--who rendered such brilliant service to Yorkshire over a period of sixty years. Born at Churwell, near Leeds, on February 12, 1857, Bobby Peel first played for his county in 1882, when Yorkshire were singularly rich in bowling talent, so that he had to wait several years before attaining real distinction. Still, being a capital fieldsman, especially at cover-point, and a punishing left-handed batsman, he kept his place in the team, and when Peate's connection with the county ceased in unhappy circumstances Peel came to the fore. For nine seasons, with his fine length, easy action and splendid command of spin, this sturdily built left-hander regularly took over 100 wickets for Yorkshire, his county total amounting to 1,550 at an average cost of 15 runs each. He was often a match-winner. In 1887 he took five Kent wickets for 14 runs in an innings and, with 43 runs in a low-scoring match, helped largely in a victory by four wickets. In the same season eleven Leicestershire wickets fell to him for 51 runs at Dewsbury, five in the first innings for four runs. A year later he took eight Nottinghamshire wickets in an innings for 12 runs, while in 1892 five wickets for seven runs in an innings and eight for 33 in the match against Derbyshire at Leeds was a startling performance. He did even better in 1895 against Somerset, 15 wickets falling to him in 36 overs for 5 runs, nine for 22 in one innings causing a sensation. At Halifax in 1897, a month before his county career ended, Peel dismissed eight Kent men in an innings for 53 runs, his match average showing eleven for 85; this performance gave Yorkshire an innings victory with 103 runs to spare in two days. Peel's full return in bowling in first-class cricket was 1,754 wickets at 16.21 runs apiece.\n\nHe did some remarkable things in Test matches with Australia, against whom he played for England twenty times. At Sydney in 1894, Australia set to get 177, hit off 113 of the runs for the loss of two wickets before stumps were drawn on the fifth day. The result then appeared a foregone conclusion, but strong sunshine followed heavy rain during the night. Peel slept through the storm. Astounded when he saw the drying pitch, he said to the English captain, Mr. Stoddart, gie me t' ball, and with Johnny Briggs, the Lancashire left-hander, also at his best, the remaining eight batsmen were disposed of for 53 runs. So England gained an extraordinary win by 10 runs after facing a total of 586, then a record for these Tests, the previous being Australia's 551 at the Oval in 1884. Peel's analysis in the fourth innings was six for 67. Peel also enjoyed a large share in winning the rubber match of that tour. He took seven wickets, scored 73 in a stand for 152 with A. C. MacLaren, and following a grand partnership for 210 by Albert Ward, of Lancashire, and J. T. Brown, of Yorkshire, the two best scorers of England's first innings hit off the runs, the victorious total being 298 for four wickets. In 1896 at Kennington Oval, with conditions very difficult for batsmen, he and J. T. Hearne got rid of Australia for 44. Peel's share in the victory by 66 runs was eight wickets for 53 runs, and his last innings analysis six wickets in 12 overs for 23 runs--some revenge for getting a pair. Hearne's figures showed ten wickets for 60. That was the last match in which W. G. Grace led England to success over Australia.\n\nBesides his great achievements as a bowler, Peel scored over 11,000 runs for Yorkshire, hitting two centuries. His highest innings was 226 not out against Leicestershire in 1892, and four years later he obtained 210 not out in a Yorkshire score of 887 against Warwickshire at Edgbaston, a total which remains a county match record. Peel and Lord Hawke, who added 292 for the eighth wicket, F. S. Jackson and E. Wainwright all reached three figures in that innings--then a record, four centuries in an innings. In 1889, the year in which the over was increased from four balls to five, Peel put together 158 in the Yorkshire second innings at Lord's, but yet was on the losing side, a brilliant 100 not out in eighty minutes by T. C. O'Brien taking Middlesex to victory by four wickets with ten minutes to spare. Yielding 1,295 runs for thirty-six wickets, the game produced a record aggregate for a match in England at the time.\n\nPeel went four times to Australia, in 1884-5, 1887-8, 1891-2 and 1894-5, and in Test matches with Australia he took 102 wickets for less than 17 runs each. He also figured in Players teams against the Gentlemen from 1887 to 1897, taking in those games 48 wickets at a cost of 16 runs apiece.\n\nHe scored 1,206 runs and took 128 wickets in all matches in 1896, the year before his remarkable career came to an end. Sent off the field by Lord Hawke during a game at Bramble Lane and suspended for the remainder of the 1897 season, he was not seen again in the Yorkshire team. He did, however, appear for an England XI against Joe Darling's Australian side at Truro two years later, taking five wickets. His benefit match at Bradford in 1894 realised \u00a32,000.\n\nPERCIVAL, REV. PREBENDARY LANCELOT JEFFERSON, K.V.O., Domestic Chaplain and Sub-Almoner to the king and Precentor of the Chapels Royal, died on June 22, aged 72. He played cricket for Clifton and Herefordshire. An Oxford Rugby Blue in 1889-90, he showed such good form that he was capped for England against Ireland in 1891, 1892, and against Scotland in 1893.\n\nREMNANT, GEORGE HENRY, who died in February, aged 92, was the oldest living Kent professional cricketer and a friend of Charles Dickens. Born at Rochester on November 20, 1848, he made the first of 42 appearances for his county at the age of 20. His best score for Kent was 62 against Hampshire at Canterbury in 1877, but in minor cricket he hit 238 and 211 not out for Chilham Castle. He was a magnificent fieldsman. As a young man, Remnant played in the village team at Gad's Hill, Higham. He used to relate how, when playing in the meadow adjoining the house where Charles Dickens lived, he drove a ball into the back of a trap in which sat the novelist's children and their governess. The pony bolted; Remnant dropped his bat, dashed in pursuit, and checked the runaway before any harm could be done.\n\nRHODES, WILLIAM, who played once for Yorkshire in 1911, died on August 5, aged 56.\n\nSELLERS, MR. ARTHUR, prominently connected with the Yorkshire County Cricket Club for 52 years, died on September 25 at Keighley, aged 71. He played for Yorkshire from 1889 to 1899, but only during two seasons-- 1892 and 1893--could he give much time to first-class cricket because of the call of business. In helping to raise Yorkshire to the championship for the first time, he came third in the 1893 averages, only J. T. Brown and John Tunnicliffe, who became such a great pair of opening batsmen, being above him, and there was little difference in their figures. Sellers excelled with two centuries, 105 at Lord's against Middlesex and 103 against Somerset at Sheffield. Only one other first-class county hundred was scored for Yorkshire that summer. Perhaps the most notable performance by Arthur Sellers was in June 1895, in the match celebrating the jubilee of I Zingari. The Gentlemen of England required 172 runs for victory, and Sellers, 70, and W. G. Grace, 101, hit off the runs in an hour and three-quarters. Sellers played each of these fine innings as opening batsman. Admirable in style, he used his height--six feet--in forward play and driving, and his forcing strokes showed perfect timing. He fielded with dash and precision, usually in the deep. A vice-president of the County Club and chairman of the Yorkshire selection committee for many years, Arthur Sellers retained these offices until his death. Heredity in cricket had proof in the ability of his son, Arthur Brian Sellers, captain of Yokshire from 1932; father and son afford the only instance of such relations each scoring 1,000 runs in a season for the county.\n\nSHIPTON, MR. WILLIAM LOUIS, died on October 21, aged 80. He was in the Repton XI of 1877 and played a few times for Derbyshire in 1884 and 1885. In a match between Buxton and Derbyshire Friars in 1884 he played an innings of 214. A free hitter and good round-arm fast bowler, he was a useful cricketer without becoming great.\n\nSTEEL, MR. ERNEST EDEN, youngest of the four brothers who played for Lancashire, died on July 14 at Southport, aged 77. After doing well in the Marlborough XI, 1880 and 1881, as free batsman and slow bowler, he appeared occasionally in the county side, but poor health and absence abroad prevented him from playing much first-class cricket. In 1901, after an interval of thirteen seasons, he reappeared for Lancashire and proved useful. Next season his deceptive flight bowling earned 44 wickets, his average of 18.93 being second to S. Webb's, though Barnes was the most destructive bowler for Lancashire. In 1904 he scored 62 for Gentlemen against Players at the Oval, but he never approached the special standard of A. G. Steel, of high fame for Cambridge, Lancashire and England. Nor was E. E. so good as D. Q., the senior and first of the brothers, who got Cambridge Blues; A. G., the other Blue, followed two years after D. Q., and was captain in 1880 when Cambridge gained their third consecutive victory over Oxford. Each helped in three wins, twice being in the same eleven.\n\nSWAN, MR. HENRY DAWFS, who died on December 21, was a well-known member and former president of the Essex County Cricket Club. Perhaps his chief activities were with M.C.C. teams, and he was credited with arranging for the first match to be played in April by a team from Lord's, and this game at Wisbech became an annual event. He used to take an M.C.C. XI on tour in Yorkshire, and the engagements with Public Schools and some of the leading clubs in the North always aroused much interest. The annual tour which he conducted in the Channel Islands was very popular. He had no pretensions to being a great cricketer, but his happy disposition made him an acquisition on all grounds, particularly when Essex organised weeks. He was well known in Australia, South Africa, West Indies and New Zealand, which he visited with touring teams.\n\nTHOMPSON, MR. HENRY, honorary secretary of Incogniti, died on August 8 at Sevenoaks, after an operation, aged 54. He played occasionally for Leicestershire in the seasons 1908, 1909 and 1910. Beginning with 15 and 72--the highest score in his side's second innings against Derbyshire--he suggested success in championship cricket, but he failed to maintain anything like this form.\n\nTHOMSON, MR. ERNEST ALFRED CHARLES, secretary of the Club Cricket Conference, which he founded in 1915, died in a nursing home on April 11, after a long illness which kept him away from the annual meeting for the first time for 26 years. From 35 clubs at its inception, the Conference grew into the greatest cricket organisation in the world. Mr. Thomson assisted in founding the National Playing Fields Association in 1925 and for two years acted as honorary secretary of the Open Spaces Bill Committee. Born at Woodford, Essex, in 1872, he was grandson of John William Thomson, who planned the Crystal Palace grounds and reorganised Kew Gardens. At the age of nine Thomson played cricket on Mitcham Green and appeared for such clubs as Townley Park and Heathfield. Besides cricket--his great love--he played Association football, hockey, lawn tennis, bowls and golf, and he also found time for athletics, cycle racing and boxing. A journalist by profession, he edited Hockey World.\n\nTROUP, MAJOR WALTER, a prominent member of the Gloucestershire XI at different times from 1887 to 1911, died in January, aged 71. He appeared first for the county when seventeen and still at a private school at Clifton. A very sound batsman, he often opened the innings with W. G. Grace, and he contributed 180 to Gloucestershire's 634 against Nottinghamshire at Bristol in 1898; during that season he also scored 176 and 100; when he helped W. G. put up 169 at Taunton against Somerset, his own contribution reached 127. Finishing second to W. G. Grace in the county batting, Troup averaged 38 for an aggregate of 968 runs. Troup became County captain next year when W. G. Grace ceased his connection with Gloucestershire, but was in office only one season before returning to India--the place of his birth. Altogether Troup scored 3,250 runs at an average of 26 an innings in first-class cricket. He played for the Gentlemen at Scarborough in 1898 and at the Oval in 1902.\n\nOf small build, he was strong in defence and extremely patient, sometimes avoiding any attempts at scoring. More than once he batted about an hour for a single run. It is recorded that at Liverpool in 1888 he withstood the Lancashire attack altogether for 95 minutes and yet bagged a brace. Despite all his care he was stumped in the first innings and leg-before-wicket in the second, each time to the cunning bowling of Briggs. Under favourable conditions he showed skill in stroke play but was always a slow scorer. He fielded well at cover-point. After being on the staff under Lord Harris at Poona, he was District Superintendent of Police in North-West Provinces. In the Great War he became a captain in the Royal Flying Corps and he retired from the Army in 1920.\n\nTUBBS, SIR STANLEY WILLIAM, BART., President of Gloucestershire County Club, died on December 11, aged 70. While at Highgate School he was a useful cricketer and always cherished a strong fondness for the game, but business claims prevented him reaching a high standard of play. Keen on all sport, he was joint master of the Berkeley Hounds from 1931 to 1933. Although twice married, he did not leave an heir, and on his death the baronetcy, with which he was honoured in 1929, became extinct.\n\nTURNER, MR. HARRY, prominent at Oxford in connection with all sport died on January 5, aged 82. From his outfitter's shop in The Turl many an undergraduate procured a bat that helped him get a Blue. For fifteen years Turner was official scorer for the University when playing in The Parks. Before those days, when Cowley Marsh was the scene of University cricket, Harry Turner took an active part in starting the Oxfordshire County Club and the Minor Counties Association. A sporting journalist, he reported games for agencies and London papers, including The Times, for over fifty years.\n\nTURNER, CAPTAIN NOEL VERNON CYRIL, who died on June 13, aged 54, at Hungerford Park, Berkshire, showed to advantage in the Repton XI from 1903 to 1905, and played sometimes for Nottinghamshire from 1906 to 1913, when A. O. Jones was captain and the strong side included John Gunn, George Gunn, J. Hardstaff senior, J. Iremonger and W. Payton. Turner averaged 23.36 for nine matches in 1907, the year Nottinghamshire were absolutely champion county for the first time since 1886. Tom Wass and Hallam in that season of triumph did nearly all the bowling, taking between them 298 wickets, while only 42 fell to six other bowlers in competition matches. Turner kept goal for Corinthians and played for England against Belgium in the amateur international match of 1920.\n\nVASSALL, MR. GILBERT CLAUDE, of high fame as an Association football outside-right and a long jumper, was a useful all-round cricketer without attaining to the front rank. After leaving Charterhouse he scored freely for Oriel in College matches at Oxford, but during his four years at the University, 1896 to 1899, the Dark Blues were very strong at cricket, and Vassall gave his chief attention to athletics and football. He played occasionally for Somerset in 1902, 1903 and 1905, but made few runs, and his fast bowling met with little success. Becoming a master at Dragon School, Oxford, soon after completing his under graduate days, he refused invitations to go elsewhere and died joint headmaster of the preparatory school on September 19, aged 65.\n\nWILLINGDON, The MARQUESS OF, P.C., G.C.S. I., G.C.M.G., G.C.I.E., G.B.E., formerly Mr. Freeman-Thomas, who died on August 12, aged 74, played in the Eton XI three seasons, being captain in 1885. Going up to Cambridge, he obtained his Blue as a Freshman and played against Oxford four times. He did nothing of note in either the big school games or the University matches at Lord's, but at Cambridge in 1887 he scored a brilliant 114 against Yorkshire at Fenner's and headed the University averages with 40.2. From 1886 to 1890 he appeared occasionally for Sussex, and in twenty county matches he made 738 runs with an average of nearly 20. He adopted the surname of Freeman-Thomas in 1892 and so became Mr. Freeman-Thomas before entering Parliament as member for Hastings. As Governor of Bombay and of Madras, he did much to further the interests of cricket in India before being appointed Viceroy. In 1924 he was raised to the Peerage.\n\nWILSON, THE RIGHT REV. CECIL, D. D., died on January 20, aged 80. After three years in the Tonbridge XI, being captain in 1879, he could not accept an offered Blue at Cambridge because of an engagement to travel abroad, but he proved himself a fine batsman for Kent. During the seasons 1882 to 1890 he played in 28 matches for the county with an average of 22.23. In the Canterbury Week of 1882 he excelled against the Australians. He stopped a bad collapse by helping E. F. S. Tylecote (100 not out) add 125 for the eighth wicket; when Kent followed-on 85 behind, he went in first and scored 50. He again did well at Canterbury in 1886, making 127 against Yorkshire, and with George Hearne (117) taking part in a third-wicket stand for 215. After Wilson's dismissal the last seven wickets fell to Emmett and Bates for 31 runs. Yet Kent won by six wickets--so completing a most successful Festival, for they had beaten the Australians in the Bank Holiday match by ten wickets. Standing five feet eleven inches tall, Cecil Wilson drove hard and scored rapidly when set. He could field anywhere and earned a reputation for fast, accurate returns to the wicket-keeper. His elder brother, Leslie Wilson, played for Kent from 1883 to 1897.\n\nAfter important work with the Melanesian Mission, following service in the Church at Portsea and Bournemouth, Dr. Wilson became Archdeacon of Adelaide, and in 1917 Bishop of Bunbury, Western Australia, where he retained office for twenty years before retiring.\n\nWILSON, MR. THEOPHILUS STUART BEATTY, died at Orion Downs, Queesland, the place of his birth, on May 19, aged 70. After captaining Bath College in his fourth year in the XI, 1889, he got his Oxford Blue 1892-93 as a fast right-hand bowler in very strong sides which included C. B. Fry, the brothers Palairet, M. R. Jardine, V. T. Hill and H. D. G. Leveson-Gower. The University match of 1893 caused a sensation. Wilson, last Oxford man, joined W. H. Brain with 5 runs required to save the follow-on. To quote the report in Wisden: The two batsmen consulted together between the wickets and it was evident that the Dark Blues were going to throw away a wicket in order that their side might go in again. C. M. Wells frustrated this intention by bowling two wide balls to the boundary. Cambridge played the third innings and, dismissing Oxford for 64, the Light Blues, captained by F. S. Jackson, won the match by 266 runs on the second afternoon. Wilson played county cricket for Monmouth.\n\nWOOD, REV. HUGH, died at Whitchurch Vicarage, Aylesbury, on July 31, aged 86, leaving the captain, the Hon. and Rev. Edward Lyttelton, who passed away in January 1942, as the last survivor of the Cambridge XI which beat the Australian team of 1878 at Lord's by an innings and 72 runs. A slow left-hand bowler, Wood was not put on in this match, A. G. Steel and P.H. Morton bowling unchanged in Australia's first innings and A. F. J. Ford helping them with one wicket when the touring team followed-on. Wood did not get his Blue that year, but in 1879 at Lord's he took four wickets for 46, sharing the honours of the first Oxford dismissal with A. G. Steel, who then scored 64, highest innings of the match, and when Oxford batted again got rid of seven men for 23, making his match record 11 wickets for 69 runs. A. F. J. Ford took the other three wickets that innings, and with three slip catches off Steel helped largely in the victory by nine wickets. This result gave Cambridge a lead of 22 victories to 21 by Oxford in the series of University encounters. Mr. Wood played for Yorkshire in 1879 and 1880, taking ten wickets at 21 runs apiece and averaging 10.40 in fifteen innings as a right-handed batsman.\n\nWOOTTON, JAMES, a slow left-handed bowler of high skill, died in February, aged 80. By clever use of flight he made up for moderate height--five feet six inches--and sometimes sent down a surprise ball of unexpected speed. For Kent he took 628 wickets at 16.90 runs each. After playing for the county of his birth from 1880 to 1890, Wootton became coach at Winchester College, and when the first-class counties were increased to fourteen in 1895 Hampshire were glad to use him, but his old skill had gone and he did little of note when occasionally appearing. He joined the staff at Lord's in 1884 and remained attached to the M.C.C. until 1890.\n\nAmong some of best performances were: 13 wickets for 84 runs against Lancashire at Gravesend in 1883, 14 for 162 runs against Sussex at Hove in 1886, and in the same summer 13 wickets for 64 against Lancashire at Maidstone, while at Gravesend in 1888 he took five Middlesex wickets for eight runs. In 1894 he was given the Kent match with Surrey at Catford as a benefit. More memorable than his doings in county cricket were two achievements at Canterbury against Australian sides. In 1884 Wootton helped Kent to win by 96 runs. Seven wickets fell to him in the match for 93 runs, three for 21 in the last innings. Alec Hearne, the present Kent scorer, did even better, with five wickets for 36 in the first innings--7 for 66 altogether. Stanley Christopherson, the fast bowler who played for England that year at Lord's and is now President of M.C.C., enjoyed a share in Kent's victory three wickets for 12 runs in the final collapse. That was the only match against a County which W. L. Murdoch's third team lost. In 1886 the touring team, captained by H. J. H. Scott, were outplayed and defeated at Canterbury by ten wickets. Wootton played a notable part in Kent's triumph, dismissing five men in each innings; he sent down 83 overs and 2 balls (4 to the over) at a total cost of 100 runs. Alec Hearne, on this occasion, claimed four wickets for 37 runs, and George Hearne three in the first innings for 19 runs, the three professionals sharing the honours in twice dismissing the Australians after Kent had been put in to bat on a pitch soaked by heavy rain.\n\n\u00a9 John Wisden & Co"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jun/26/county-cricket-lancashire-v-hants-yorkshire-v-surrey-and-more-live", "page_content": "26 Jun 2018 23.02 BST Roundup It was an intriguing day at Scarborough where the encroaching sea fret interrupted play and Surrey were docked five penalty runs against Yorkshire after two level\u2011one disciplinary offences in the morning. The first incident came as Jack Brooks and Steven Patterson added useful tail-end runs against fast, short-pitched bowling from Morne Morkel and Jade Dernbach. The second when the careworn Mark Stoneman was given out, caught behind for nine, on his birthday. A hearing between players and umpires was due to take place at close of play. Surrey had to bat in increasingly difficult conditions, Rory Burns the top scorer with 59. Tim Bresnan took three for 57 and there were four catches for the wicketkeeper Jonathan Tattersall. Alex Davies made a handsome 78, his highest first-class score of the season, in an unbroken fourth-wicket partnership of 70 with Dane Vilas as Lancashire fought back from 70 for three at Old Trafford. Poor Haseeb Hameed fell cheaply again. Earlier Hampshire had added a further 149 runs to their overnight total, with Rilee Rossouw unbeaten on 120 and Graham Onions finishing with his second five-wicket haul of the season. It was a long, hot day for Somerset at Chelmsford as Essex declared at 517 for five, with a mammoth unbeaten 173 for Ryan ten Doeschate and 118 for Ravi Bopara. At Sophia Gardens an unbeaten 111 from Ben Duckett and 50 not out from Luke Procter put Northamptonshire in a strong position against Glamorgan, 196 runs ahead. Usman Khawaja held the Glamorgan innings together with a glorious 103, his third century in his third first-class match, usurping the county record held by Javed Miandad and Shaun Marsh. Jonathan Trott continued his golden goodbye at the Riverside with 170 not out as Warwickshire were bowled out for 424 against Durham. There were four wickets each for Chris Rushworth and Matthew Salisbury. Meanwhile, at Canterbury a knockabout hundred by the Kent No 10 Grant Stewart put them in a very strong position against Middlesex.

A very good right-hand fast-medium bowler with easy delivery, he swung the ball; and pace from the pitch made him difficult to time. Seldom failing as a taker of wickets, he seemed to reserve his most effective work for the big occasion. Tall, of athletic build, Amar Singh, besides being such a capable bowler, batted freely and fielded brilliantly. Born in December 1910, he passed away when in his prime.\n\nComing to England in 1932, he stood out as a prominent member of the All-India team, dismissing 111 batsmen at a cost of 20.78 each and scoring 641 runs with an average of nearly 23. In the one match played against England he created a good impression at Lord's. Four batsmen fell to him and in an uphill struggle he played a very good innings of 51. After the tour he became a Lancashire League player for the Colne club, who released him for a few matches in 1936 when India rose to the status of three tests. In these engagements with England Amar Singh took ten wickets and averaged 31 with the bat. So well did he bowl at Lord's that he dismissed four of the first five England batsmen for 13 runs and altogether sent back six batsmen for 35 in 25 overs and a ball, so enabling India to lead by 13 on the first innings. England won comfortably by nine wickets, but nothing in the match was more noteworthy than the bowling of the Indian between two batting collapses by his own side. At Old Trafford he hit up 48 and was not out, while at the Oval he gave a brilliant display with the bat, making 44 out of 51 in half an hour. These exhibitions of free hitting were in keeping with his most note worthy performance in 1932, when, going in last but one at Liverpool, he played a grand innings of 131 not out against Lancashire; his chanceless hitting was remarkable. His batting average for the 1936 tour was 33.30 in eleven innings; second in the bowling list, he took 26 wickets at 23.50 each.\n\nAgainst England touring teams Amar Singh met with special success, notably when Lord Tennyson led a side in the winter of 1938. In five representative fixtures, described as unofficial tests, he took 36 wickets at a cost of 16 runs apiece, and was largely responsible for India gaining two victories. When Tennyson's team won the rubber match by 156 runs Amar Singh took nine wickets in twelve overs--all he sent down in the two innings.\n\nASHBOLT, MR. F., prominent in New Zealand cricket, who died at Wellington, on July 16, aged 64, was a clever right-hand slow bowler, capable of keeping a length with his leg-breaks, and a sure catch in the slips. He took many wickets for Wellington, 8 for 58 against Hawkes Bay and 7 for 52 against Canterbury being among his best performances. Also he did well against visiting teams on tour, dismissing six New South Wales batsmen for 52 in an innings in 1894, while in 1896, in a match against an Australian XI, captained by G. H. S. Trott, he disposed of Frank Iredale, Joe Darling and C. J. Eady. He played for North Island, and in 1898 was a member of the first New Zealand team which went to Australia.\n\nBAINBRIDGE, MR. HERBERT WILLIAM, of high renown in Warwickshire cricket, died at Leamington Spa on March 3, aged 77, having been born at Assam on October 29, 1862. Standing about six feet tall and strong, he was an accomplished batsman, capable of punishing good bowling by well-controlled strokes all round the wicket; he also commanded respect for leadership. After four seasons in the Eton eleven, being captain in 1882, Bainbridge was awarded his Blue at Cambridge in 1884 and helped to make University match history. He gave an exceptional display in the 1885 match at Lord's, when for the fourth consecutive time the match ended in a victory by seven wickets, this being the third such success by Cambridge. Bainbridge and Charles Wright, a stone-waller, opened the Cambridge innings with 152 runs, which gave their side a lead of 16 before Bainbridge hit a ball into mid-off's hands. His 101 was a faultless display of splendid strokes. This was at that time the best opening stand for either University; but, strangely enough, next year, when Bainbridge succeeded Lord Hawke as Cambridge captain, K. J. Key and W. Rashleigh put up 243 in starting Oxford's second innings, and this remains the first wicket partnership record for the University match. Oxford won by 133 runs. Bainbridge scored 44 and 79 in that encounter, and altogether in three meetings with Oxford he made 262 runs with an average of 43--an exceptional achievement.\n\nBelonging to a Surrey family, Bainbridge played for the county occasionally previous to beginning his association with Warwickshire before completing the regulation period of qualification. In 1887 Leicestershire protested and the objection was upheld by M.C.C. However, Bainbridge captained Warwickshire in 1888 and kept the position until 1902, when he became honorary secretary--an office he retained when appointed chairman. In 1936 his fifty years of service received recognition by a presentation from the Warwickshire club. His highest innings for the county was 162 against Hampshire at Southampton in 1897, when he and W. G. Quaife put on 288 for the first wicket. Bainbridge played several times for Gentlemen against Players, and in the 1895 match at Kennington Oval he scored 82. That season was his most successful in first-class cricket, his aggregate runs numbering 1,162 with an average of 34. He was in the team captained by E. J. Sanders, in company with W. E. Roller, K. J. Key, E. H. Buckland, Hugh Rotherham, and C. E. Cottrell, who went to America in 1886 and won seven out of eight matches, the other being drawn in their favour.\n\nBainbridge played Association football for Cambridge without getting his Blue, but was prominent for Old Etonians and was in the eleven who lost the final tie for the F. A. Cup at the Oval in 1883, when Blackburn Olympic earned lasting fame, being the first provincial club to carry off the trophy. That was before professionalism was legalised.\n\nBARTHOLOMEW, MR. ARTHUR CHURCHILL, of Oxford, the oldest cricket Blue, passed away on March 29, some five weeks after completing his 94th year. Born on February 21, 1846, at Lympstone, Devon, he was more than a year senior to the Rev. E. E. Harrison Ward, the oldest Cambridge Blue, who died on Easter Monday, five days earlier. The passing of Mr. Bartholomew, Oxford, and Mr. Ward within this brief space of time left Mr. F. A. MacKinnon, Chief of the Scottish Clan, the senior living Blue of either University. He and Mr. Ward both played for Cambridge in the Cobden match to which further reference will be found in the biography of Mr. Harrison Ward.\n\nIt is of interest to add here that Mr. MacKinnon, now aged 92, who went to Australia in 1878 with the team captained by Lord Harris, is the oldest living cricketer who has represented England. H. C. Maul, another member of that touring side, died early in the year; Mr. A. J. Webbe, Middlesex president for so many years, who reached the age of 86 in January, five weeks before his death, played in the only test of that tour.\n\nA. C. Bartholomew went to Marlborough and appeared at Lord's against Rugby in 1865, when he was described as a good bat with patient defence. Going to Trinity College, Oxford, he headed the University averages in 1867, but did not play against Cambridge until the following season, when, in a match of small totals, he scored 7 and 11 not out. He was regarded as one of the best cover points of the day and a contemporary described his quick returns straight to the wicket, after running hard to the ball, as a pleasure to see.\n\nFor some years failing eyesight prevented him reading, but Mr. Bartholomew retained such a keen interest in the game that as recently as the summer of 1939 he listened eagerly while his daughter read the scores and descriptions of matches. He greatly prized the disc from a blotter presented to him when a master at Durham School. It is inscribed: To A. C. B., Durham School, for his score of 166 against Northumberland at Newcastle-on-Tyne, June 3, 1871. At one time he played for his native county, Devon, and he organised a cricket week at Reading, where he owned a private school, and coached E. H. Bray, L. P. Collins and J. F. Ireland before they gained their Blues. He founded a cricket eleven and called them Guinea-pigs--because, he said, they had no tail, One of his scholars was Major-General Sir Walter Kirke, Inspector-General of the Home Forces. His son, Major-General A. W. Bartholomew, was appointed Lieutenant of the Tower of London in March 1939.\n\nBELDAM, MR. CYRIL ASHLAM, who played in a few matches for Middlesex in 1896, died on September 7, aged 70.\n\nBETON, MR. WILLIAM, dressing room attendant at Lord's, known to M.C.C. members and first-class cricketers as Sam, died at his home near the St. John's Wood ground on May 3, aged 69.\n\nBOGER, MR. ALNOD JOHN, who died at Oxford on June 3, aged 68, captained Winchester in his third season in the eleven and, going up to Oxford, got his Blue as a Freshman in 1891. A useful bat, he averaged 20 and took 19 wickets in the matches against Eton. He did not maintain his cricket form, but represented the University at golf in 1893 and 1894, and at cricket for Hertfordshire he showed to some advantage from 1889 to 1897.\n\nBOWRING, MR. CHARLES WARREN, a native of St. John's, Newfoundland, who was educated at Marlborough College, died on November 2, aged 69. He played for Staten Island club in 1907 and 1908 and was well known in American cricket circles. A prominent shipping agent, he was a member of the American Committee of Lloyd's and a director of the British Empire Chamber of Commerce in the United States. He was one of the survivors when the Lusitania was sunk in May 1915.\n\nBREEDEN, MR. FRANK, a medium-paced right-arm bowler, who played for Warwickshire in the early years of the county club when second class, died at his home in Moseley on April 7, aged 81. Playing for Twenty of Walsall and District in 1883, Breeden and Allan Hill, the Yorkshire fast bowler, dismissed the entire United All-England eleven captained by W. G. Grace for 82 and 58. Breeden bowled W. G. round his legs, and his record for the match was ten wickets for 68, while Allan Hill's ten cost 66 runs. Besides the two successful bowlers, Richard Daft and H. B. Daft, famous with Nottinghamshire, and George Pinder, of Yorkshire, a superb Wicket keeper, were in the Walsall side. W. G. Grace took 17 wickets for 135 and scored 23 and 9, but the powerful United eleven were beaten.\n\nBROWN, WILLIAM, a notable Luton sportsman, died in January at the age of 65. For more than 25 years he played cricket for Bedfordshire, being a prolific run-getter and medium-paced bowler. As a professional footballer he played outside-right for Luton Town and Watford.\n\nCHAPLIN, COLONEL REGINALD SPENCER, died on May 12, aged 67. Of powerful physique, he was a capable all-rounder: fast bowler, good fieldsman, especially close to the wicket, and a hard-hitting batsman. He did fairly well in the Harrow XI before joining the Army. He became a Lieut.-Colonel in Remount Services during the 1914-18 war. Among his Harrow contemporaries were F. S. Jackson and A. C. MacLaren.\n\nCOMPTON, MR. EDWARD DENISON, who died at Rye on October 11, aged 68, played for Somerset and Oxfordshire. Prominent in games at Lancing, he got his Association football Blue at Oxford in 1895-96.\n\nCOODE, MR. ARTHUR TREVENAN, died on December 28, aged 64. A Cambridge Blue in 1898, after playing well in school cricket at Beccles, he did nothing exceptional as opening batsman with C. J. Burnup, but was much more prominent at Association football for the University and for Middlesex. In his one cricket match against Oxford he went in first and was highest scorer with 27 in the second innings of a match which ended in defeat for Cambridge by nine wickets. He played occasionally for Middlesex.\n\nCOULSON, HARRY, for many years in charge of the King's and Clare cricket ground at Cambridge, died on March 27, aged 74. He was well known to undergraduates of fully two generations. A prominent local sportsman, he not only did splendid work for Cambridgeshire as a clever medium-paced bowler, but also was much in demand in country-house matches.\n\nCOWLEY, CAPTAIN ROBERT BAYNES, who was in the Harrow XI of 1907, died at Lincoln on February 1, aged 57.\n\nCRUTCHLEY, MR. PERCY EDWARD, who died at Ascot on October 16, aged 85, was in the Harrow XI in 1873 and 1874. He played for Cambridge against Oxford in the tennis singles in 1876.\n\nDEVEY, JOHN HENRY GEORGE, died in a Birmingham Nursing Home on October 13, aged 73. If better known as a fine forward for Aston Villa and a director of the club for 33 years, John Devey was a very useful cricketer, doing good service in the Warwickshire Eleven from 1888 to 1907. A hard hitting batsman with plenty of strokes, he helped his County obtain promotion to the first class in 1895. Altogether he scored 7,659 runs for Warwickshire--average 25.31. Particularly good in defence on rain-affected pitches he improved in value with increased experience, excelling in 1906 when he made 1,237 runs--average 41.23. That was his benefit year and, unlike most professionals, he excelled when in the public eye, scoring 106 and taking a prominent part in Warwickshire getting within 52 of Surrey's 562 at Edgbaston. The match brought Devey about \u00a3400. Strangely enough he lost his form next season, doing little in a few games. In the highest innings he played, 246 against Derbyshire at Edgbaston in 1900. Devey gave a wonderful display of powerful driving--a characteristic of his batting when set.\n\nDICKSON, MR. MAURICE RHYND D. S. O., an officer of the Legion of Honour, who died at Arbroath on January 10, aged 58, was prominent cricketer in Scotland.\n\nDOBSON, MR. THOMAS KELL, the most successful amateur who ever played for Durham, and by some good judges considered the best all-rounder that the county has produced, died on October 3, aged 39, after being in indifferent health for three years. During fifteen seasons--1922 to 1936--he scored 3,040 with an average of 24.12, and took 226 wickets at a cost of 16.70 runs each. No other amateur has exceeded 2,000 runs and 200 wickets for the county. A general idea of his ability may be gathered from the fact that he headed the Durham bowling averages three times and twice was the best batsman. In 1928 his bowling averages was 15.37 a wicket and batting average 35.21, while in 1932, when again top of the bowling, his wickets cost only 13.96 runs each, and he came second in the batting with an average of 35.72. He showed special partiality for West Indies bowling, scoring 105 against the 1928 team and in 1933 for Minor Counties at Lord's he put up 126.\n\nMr. T. A. Bulmer, Durham Secretary, has given this description of T. K. Dobson: He was a left-hand bat and a left-arm slow to medium bowler. He could both swing and spin the ball, and could bowl the chinaman too; height gave him good command of the ball. His drives through the covers and pulls were fierce. When at Lord's he put Martindale to the leg boundary off his eyebrows, as it were, he told me that I should have seen Martindale's eyes roll round. ... He was a great cricketer and a great fellow. His father, three uncles and elder brother, W. L., all played for Durham. I saw his father score 107 against Yorkshire first eleven at Darlington. T. K. Dobson captained the Durham eleven from 1931 until 1937, when ill-health prevented him from leading the side on the field; he then served on the Committee.\n\nDOCKER, MR. LUDFORD CHARLES, of Derbyshire and Warwickshire, died on August 2, aged 79. He played for Derbyshire from 1881 to 1886, being captain for a time, and then went to Warwickshire, for whom he appeared regularly until 1894. He became President in 1915, retiring in 1931. In August 1886 he made 132, 112 and 110 in consecutive innings--the first and third of these centuries for Smethwick in cup-tie matches and the other for Warwickshire against M.C.C. at Edgbaston. His highest score in county cricket was 163 at Edgbaston against Cheshire in 1891, while three years later his average, 37.20, was the best by any gentleman in first-class cricket. He went to Australia in the winter of 1887 with Shrewsbury's team, but met with little success, his best innings being 48 in eleven-a-side matches. Owing to an unfortunate muddle two teams visited Australia during that season. They joined forces to play Combined Australia and won by 126 runs, thanks mainly to the bowling of Peel, ten wickets for 58, and Lohmann, nine wickets for 52. Docker did not take part in that match, but he was in Shrewsbury's eleven twice against Australia, making 21 and being not out 4 when the first ended in a victory by five wickets, while in the second, won by 158 runs, he scored 33 valuable runs, so helping to stop a first-innings collapse caused by C. T. B. Turner.\n\nPowerfully built and over six feet tall, Docker played a strong, lively game, with special freedom in driving; he bowled fast, fielded well, and generally was a valuable member of any side.\n\nDOWSON, MR. AUBREY OSLER, who died on October 5, at Salisbury, was in the Rugby XI of 1892 and 1893. Earning more fame at Rugby football, he played for Oxford in 1896, and three years later was in the England XV against Scotland. Powerfully built, he represented his University in Athletics against Cambridge--putting the weight and throwing the hammer--for three years 1895-1897.\n\nFORD, MR. FRANCIS GILBERTSON JUSTICE, the youngest of seven brothers, all good cricketers at Repton, and nephew of G. J. Ford, who played for Oxford at Lord's a hundred years ago, died on February 7, aged 73, at Burwash, Sussex. After four years in the Repton XI, being captain in the last two seasons, Francis Ford was the third of the brothers who played for Cambridge, receiving his Blue as a Freshman. In his first year Oxford won by seven wickets, the next match was drawn, and then he took part in two handsome victories. When captain, he led his side to a great triumph by an innings and 105 runs, and, playing again, he helped Cambridge to win by seven wickets, this being the sixth time in nine consecutive seasons on which that margin settled the trial of strength between the Universities at Lord's.\n\nStanding 6 feet 2\u00bd inches, he used his height with such effect that despite spare physique he put exceptional force into his left-hand strokes. Elegant in style, standing upright, he made many good-length balls into half volleys, and when the bowler pitched shorter he forced the ball away at a great rate on either side of the wicket. He failed to show his best form in the University match except in 1890, when on a treacherous pitch ruined by rain he made the highest score, not out 32, which won the game. Under similar conditions he took Middlesex to victory over Yorkshire at Headingley in 1898. With Hirst, Rhodes and F. S. Jackson in their prime, 60 in the last innings meant a difficult task, but Ford, going in number four with the total 26, hit up 29, finishing the match by driving Haigh over the far away off boundary--as Sir Pelham Warner, the first batsman to fall, has described.\n\nProbably Francis Ford never gave a more brilliant display than in scoring 191 at Hove against Sussex in 1890. Gregor McGregor, the Cambridge captain, 131, and C. P. Foley, 117, also contributed centuries to the Cambridge second innings total of 703 for nine wickets--then a record score in English first-class cricket. Ford, going in when the bowling was mastered, scored almost as he pleased. His drives, either kept down or lifted over the bowler's head, were dazzling, and his cuts the perfection of timing. He revelled in these strokes when fast bowlers lost their length because of his punishment, and at Lord's the crowds grew enthusiastic over the way he scored from the best fast bowlers--Arthur Mold of Lancashire, Tom Richardson and Bill Lockwood of Surrey, suffered specially at his hands.\n\nIn 1893 he was second to A. E. Stoddart in the Middlesex averages when scoring generally was moderate, and in the winter of 1894 was in the first team captained by Stoddart which won the test match at Sydney by 10 runs. He scored 48 when England followed-on in face of Australia's 586, so helping Albert Ward and J. T. Brown to pull the game round and set their rivals to get 177, a task which Peel and Briggs rendered impossible of achievement.\n\nHe headed the first class batting in 1897, when he averaged 53 for an aggregate of 805. He excelled for the Gentlemen at Lord's, playing two grand not-out innings of 50 and 79. The second, on worn turf, was superb, only W. G. Grace and G. L. Jessop of the other batsmen doing much.\n\nPoor health compelled Francis Ford to give up county cricket at the finish of the 1899 season, with an aggregate of 7,293 runs, average 27.21. A good slow left-handed bowler, he often caused trouble by dropping the ball an accurate length from a great height with plenty of spin and curl; in first-class cricket he took 198 wickets, average 22 runs. A capable goalkeeper, he got his Blue, captained the Cambridge Association XI, and played sometimes for the Corinthian club. Always closely in touch with cricket, Francis Ford held strong views regarding leg before, and his influence was largely responsible for bringing about the recent addition of the last phrase to Law 24.\n\nFOSTER, MR. MAURICE KERSHAW, sixth of the seven brothers who played for Worcestershire, died at Lichfield on December 3. All these sons of the Rev. H. Foster, of Malvern college, in turn were prominent in school games and stepped, naturally, into the atmosphere of University and county cricket. When promoted to first class in 1899, Worcestershire included three Fosters in the eleven and promptly the new addition to the front rank of the game became known as Fostershire. Maurice first played for the county in 1908, but business abroad permitted only occasional appearances until 1923, when he became captain and led the side for three season. In 1926 he was available still, and in each of these four years his aggregate in Championship matches exceeded 1,300 runs. Of good height and well proportioned, M. K. was typical of his famous family in the strength of stroke play produced by the powerful wrists and forearms always associated with those proficient at racquets--and all the brothers excelled also at this game. His forcing stokes on either side of the wicket were brilliant. Invariably reliable, he enjoyed periods of special success. In June 1924 he came out strongly with 157 not out against Sussex, 128 against Kent, and 125 against Somerset; he finished that season with 111 and 42 not out at Taunton off the Somerset bowlers.\n\nHe enjoyed special success in 1926, when he scored 141 and 106 at Worcester against Hampshire, and in the whole season made 1,615 runs with an average of 32.95. After appearing for the county occasionally in 1927 and 1934, he turned to Birmingham League cricket, helping Walsall win the championship three times, and he played for the team in 1940. M. K. Foster could field anywhere, saving many runs and holding the most difficult catches. Chosen for the Gentlemen against Players at the Oval and Lord's, in 1924, he failed to do himself justice in either match. He died within a month of completing 52 years.\n\nFRANK, MR. JOSEPH, a Yorkshireman, who did not fulfil expectations, died on October 22, aged 82. When playing for Eighteen of Scarborough against W. L. Murdoch's first Australian team in 1880, his very fast right-hand bowling received strong criticism for doubtful action, and he appeared only once for the County--at Scarborough in 1881 against I Zingari. Two seasons later he played at Kennington Oval in the Gentlemen and Players match, which ended in a tie. He used his height and strength in left-handed batting and was a useful slip fieldsman.\n\nGALE, MR. PERCIVAL GEORGE, who played with W. G. Grace in the London County team, died on September 7, aged 75. As captain of Walham Green he made a name in club cricket. For the powerful Wanderers club he showed to advantage, and became a Vice-President. After the last war, during which he rose to the rank of Chief Inspector in the Special Constabulary, he took up golf. He was Chairman of the Tooting Bec Club which bought the course and renamed it South Lodge Club.\n\nGILES, SIR CHARLES TYRRELL, K. C., who died at Wimbledon on January 16 in his 90th year, was in the Harrow Elevens of 1868 and 1869. In the first of the matches at Lord's, Giles took four Eton wickets for 29, and it is on record that one drive off him by C. I. Thornton went over the pavilion--a considerably lower building than the present one, which Albert Trott cleared with a great straight drive off M. A Noble in 1899.\n\nSir Charles married a sister of Sir Jeremiah Colman, so well known in cricket in connection with the Surrey County Club, of which he was President from 1916 to 1922.\n\nGREATOREX, MR. JOSEPH EDWARD ALFRED, died on December 16, aged 78. A sound batsman, he went in first for Harrow in his only match against Eton in 1881. His scores were modest--9 and 20--but when tried as the fifth bowler in the last innings of the match he took five wickets for 35 runs with his slows, and Harrow won by 112 runs. He did not maintain this form and never became prominent in the game.\n\nGREEN-PRICE, REV. ALFRED EDWARD, died at Presteign on June 29, aged 80. In the Repton XI of 1877 and 1878, when the Fords were prominent he failed to get his cricket Blue at Cambridge, but was in the 1882 Association football eleven.\n\nHARINGTON, GENERAL SIR CHARLES, K.C.B., G.C.B., D.S.O., died on October 22 at Cheltenham, aged 68. A useful player in the Cheltenham college XI, he did well at Sandhurst; also for I Zingari and Free Foresters. At the time of his death he was on the M.C.C. Committee. Very zealous for the good of cricket, his influence increased the value of the game in the Army. Evidence of his popularity came in an invitation to become President of the Marylebone Club, but Army duties in an important command compelled General Harington to decline the highest honour in the world of cricket.\n\nHARRISON, GEORGE PICKERING, a typical Yorkshireman of the old school, died, aged 78, at Scarborough, his home, in September. He came to the front when first given a trial in 1883, and his career ended almost as suddenly in 1892 from the effects of injury. A right-handed fast bowler, he appeared for colts of the North at Lord's and clean bowled nine Colts of the South--five of them in six balls--at the low cost of 14 runs. Chosen for the Yorkshire XI without delay, he excelled in his first county match at Dewsbury against Kent; he bowled unchanged through both innings with Ted Peate, the slow left-hander. Harrison came out with eleven wickets for 76 runs as his share in disposing of the visitors for totals of 65 and 79, so surpassing the work of his England colleague. The distinction of being chosen for Players against Gentlemen at Lord's followed, and in the whole season he took 100 wickets at an average cost of 13 runs, his Yorkshire record being 88 at less than 12 runs each.\n\nAfter such an exceptional start, Harrison suffered an injury when throwing in from the deep field. This accident occurred when he was acting as substitute, and it necessitated the abandonment of fast bowling. Reducing his speed, he met with some success, but could not retain his place in the County eleven.\n\nIn Yorkshire Council cricket for Bowling Old Lane he took 878 wickets, and in three seasons for Idle 215 fell to him, the average cost for all this effective work being about 9 runs a wicket. He enjoyed a day of great success for the North and East Ridings of Yorkshire touring in the South, taking 15 Chiswick Park wickets for 38 runs.\n\nKnown familiarly as Shoey, an abbreviation of his trade as shoemaker, Harrison often umpired in first-class cricket, and at every Scarborough Festival in recent years his favourite corner in the pavilion was alive with humour and reminiscence. Of many tales told of him, one mentioned in The Cricketer goes back to his first match at Lord's. When accepting the invitation to play for the Colts he asked Mr. Henry Perkins, the M.C.C. Secretary, to meet him at king's Cross as he had never been to London.\n\nHIDDLESTON, MR. JOHN SYDNEY, one of the ablest all-round cricketers Wellington and New Zealand have produced, died suddenly at Wellington on October 30 in his fiftieth year. In Plunket Shield matches he created several records: he scored for Wellington, 2,523 runs in 46 innings with an average of 56; in each of the seasons 1923-24 and 1925-26, when he played innings of 204 and 212, his aggregate exceeded 500 runs. This double performance and also his eight centuries--three each against Auckland and Otago, and two against Canterbury--are New Zealand records. Hiddleston also played for Otago, and his complete aggregate falls only 30 short of the 2,597 scored by Roger Blunt, who represented both Canterbury and Otago and holds the New Zealand record in Plunket Shield games. An able slow break bowler, Hiddleston was also an excellent fieldsman. By many Wellington cricketers he was compared favourably with C. S. Dempster. He played in representative sides against teams visiting New Zealand from 1920 to 1925.\n\nHOWELL, MR. WILLIAM P., the Australian bowler, died on July 14, aged 70, at Sydney. No one has made a more sensational first appearance in England than did Bill Howell when, in the third match of Darling's team in 1899, he dismissed the whole Surrey eleven. His analysis, 23.2 overs, 14 maidens, 28 runs, 10 wickets, indicates this exceptional performance as being quite out of the ordinary, no matter what the state of the pitch. As the natural effect of this achievement, Howell, after being left out of the first two engagements, became a regular member of the side. He did little in the five tests, taking only eight wickets at 43 runs apiece, but if unable to live up to such a start, Howell for the whole season came out with a record of 117 wickets at 20.35 apiece, his average placing him between Hugh Trumble and Ernest Jones, who each dismissed more batsmen.\n\nVisiting England with the next two Australian, Howell took fewer wickets but at smaller cost--68 for 17.86 each and 79 for 19.34 each.\n\nHe began test cricket by bowling A. C. MacLaren in both the Adelaide matches in the season of 1898-99, when the Lancashire amateur averaged 54. Altogether Howell appeared on sixteen occasions for Australia without accomplishing anything exceptional, though bowling wonderfully well at Melbourne in 1904. At a time when the Australian attack was very strong, his Test record showed 35 wickets at an average cost of 35.57. For New South Wales in Sheffield Shield matches he claimed 159 wickets, Average 23.55.\n\nOf good height and heavily built, Howell made full use of his strong wrist and fingers in spinning the ball at medium pace. Usually, command of length gave him special ability, and he was deadly against batsmen unaware that his simple-looking delivery imparted unexpected life from the pitch. Howell showed this merit for New South Wales in November 1894, when he clean bowled five of A. E. Stoddart's team, including the captain and J. T. Brown, the Yorkshireman, while yielding only 44 runs--a happy introduction to his experiences against English cricketers.\n\nA left-handed batsman, he sometimes startled the bowlers and the crowd by tremendous hitting. A notable case was at Sydney against Stoddart's team in 1898. Going in last for New South Wales, he hit up 48 in three-quarters of an hour and eclipsed this in the second innings with 95 in less than an hour, 76 of these runs coming in boundaries. For the most part in England, as well as in all Test matches, Howell did little with the bat, but in Sheffield Shield matches he averaged 22.86 for an aggregate of 1,029 runs with 128 his best score.\n\nIn Test matches against South Africa, Howell took 14 wickets at 12.42 runs apiece. He turned the ball a lot on the matting pitches.\n\nA bee farmer in Penrith, New South Wales, Howell was a local celebrity alike for his cricketing ability and genial character.\n\nHUGHES, MR. THOMAS BRIDGES, a useful batsman with good style, who played for Winchester from 1868 to 1870, died on August 10 his 90th year. He did little in two matches against Eton. Going up to New College, he played in the Oxford Freshmen's match of 1871; in very strong company he failed to get his blue, but took part in the first University Association football match in 1874, when Oxford won at Kennington Oval by the only goal scored.\n\nJONES MR. RICHARD TYRRELL, died on August 30, aged 69. A good all-round cricketer at Eton, he played at Lord's against Harrow in 1888 and in 1889. A capable batsman and useful bowler he was unsuccessful in the big games, but at Oxford he got his Blue in 1892. Though on the wining side, he did little against Cambridge in a match made famous by M. R. Jardine scoring 140, then the second highest innings in the University series. In county cricket he showed useful form for Shropshire and Staffordshire.\n\nKEMP, MR. ARTHUR FITCH, a slow bowler and sound batsman, one of four brothers who were in the Harrow XI during the period 1874 to 1885, died on February 14 at Virginia Water, aged 76. Twice he was on the winning side against Eton. In 1880, when Manley C. Kemp was captain, Harrow won by 95 runs, and next season A. F. Kemp led the eleven to victory at Lord's by 112 runs. In the first match Arthur Kemp, opening the innings, scored 33 and took five wickets for 61 runs. When captain he made 28 runs, but did not meet with any success as bowler. He played for Kent, the county of his birth, three times in 1884. In partnership with E. M. Hadow, he won the public Schools Racquets Championship in 1881.\n\nKENNAWAY, REV. CHARLES LEWIS, who died on April 23 at the advanced age of 92, was probably the last survivor of the Norfolk team which in 1885 made 695 against M.C.C. at Lord's, the record score up to that time. With Jack Hansell, Mr. Kennaway put on 155 for the third wicket. Another notable occasion in his cricket career was the victory of Norfolk at Norwich in 1882 over the professional side run by Shaw and Shrewsbury. His highest score for the county was 147 against Free Foresters at Norwich in 1882. Besides being a sound, attractive batsman he was an excellent cover-point. For many years he played at Garboldisham, where he was Rector until 1914. He then went as Vicar to Tarrant Crawford in Dorset.\n\nLAIDLEY, MR. JOHN ERNEST, a prominent Scottish cricketer, died on July 15, aged 69.\n\nLEADBEATER, MR. W. W., well known in connection with Yorkshire cricket, especially as secretary of the Scarborough club, died in July.\n\nLINDLEY, MR. TINSLEY, died on March 30, aged 74. A barrister living in Nottingham, Tinsley Lindley was known in sport chiefly as an outstanding centre-forward for England and Corinthians besides his local clubs. A very useful cricketer, he made 40 and 7 for Nottinghamshire against Surrey at Trent Bridge in the Whitsuntide match of 1888, and he was in the county eleven which beat the Australians by ten wickets.\n\nMCKIBBEN, Mr. Thomas Robert, died at the close of 1939, aged 69. He came to England with Harry Trott's team in 1896, and his delivery raised such criticism that it was written there can be little doubt that he continually threw when putting on his off-break--an opinion often expressed in Australia also. Very powerfully built, of medium height, he accomplished deadly work with his right-hand slow to medium bowling when he kept a length. Perhaps most remarkable was his performance against Lancashire on the Aigburth ground, Liverpool, where he took 13 wickets at a cost of only 38 runs. The county fell for 28 in their second innings, McKibben's analysis being seven wickets, including the hat-trick, for 11 runs. Frank Sugg did not attempt to play one ball that came back a prodigious amount on to the stumps. In the two innings McKibben and Trumble were unchanged.\n\nPlaying in two of the three matches against England, McKibben took eleven wickets at 14.8 apiece, and his season's record showed 101 at 14.27--figures that put him at the top of the Australian averages above Hugh Trumble, Ernest Jones and George Griffen, who all claimed over a hundred wickets. A left-handed batsman, he made few runs. In Sheffield Shield matches for New South Wales 136 wickets fell to him at 20.50 runs each. Twice he took fourteen wickets in a match, and once fifteen--at Adelaide in 1896. He was seldom needed in Test matches, and altogether in five such encounters his tally showed seventeen victims, average 29.17. A visitor with the team captained by Don Bradman in 1938, McKibben renewed many friendships in England, where his frank, happy character made him deservedly popular.\n\nMARR, MR. ALFRED P., who died at Sydney in March, aged 77, played for the Combined XI of Australia in one of four such matches against Arthur Shrewsbury's side in 1885. A useful batsman and bowler for New South Wales, he was chosen three times to come to England, but was never able to accept the invitation. So well did he maintain his ability that when 67 years of age, in grade competition match at Sydney, he scored 101.\n\nMAUL, MR. HENRY COMPTON, died on October 10, aged 90, at his home Bunbury, Oxfordshire. A free-hitting batsman, he played several innings of over 200, the most praiseworthy being 267 for Warwickshire against Staffordshire on August 17, 1888. He was then captain of the county side, seven years before Warwickshire became first class, and he headed the averages with 42. He want to Australia in the winter of 1878 in the team captained by Lord Harris, but did not take part in the one representative match, which Australia won by ten wickets. Of that side F. A. MacKinnon now alone survives him. Mr. Maul was a Major in the Oxfordshire Militia. Three of his sons are serving in the present war.\n\nMAW, MR. PERCIVAL TRENTHAM, who died on January 30, aged 62, finished three seasons in the Harrow XI as captain in 1897, when he set a particularly good example in fielding. In his three matches against Eton he scored 91 runs, making eleven or more in each innings until the last of these games. He appeared a few times for Herefordshire in 1898, playing very well for 91 runs against I Zingari, but poor health prevented a full development of his batting skill. He cut and drove in attractive style. His family used to put a complete eleven in the field at Nutfield, Surrey.\n\nOATES, WILLIAM, who played a few times for Yorkshire in 1874 and 1875, died on December 9, aged 88.\n\nO'HANLON, MR. WILLIAM J., who died at Sydney in July, aged 77 years, kept wicket for New South Wales from 1884 to 1886, showing good form in inter-colonial matches.\n\nORR, MR. HERBERT, RICHARD, perhaps the most prominent personality connected with Bedfordshire cricket, passed away on May 22, at the age of 75. Getting into the School XI when fifteen, Herbert Orr finished five years in the side as captain in 1884, and actually played his first game for the county in 1882. From that time his interest in the Bedfordshire Club remained undiminished.\n\nHis devotion to the game found lasting proof in his will, by which he left the cricket picture, Sussex versus Kent, to his friend, Dr. Alfred F. Morcom, of Belgrave Square, S.W., in memory of many pleasant days spent together in the cricket field, \u00a3100 to the Bedfordshire County Cricket Club, and \u00a350 to the Bedford Town Cricket Club, in memory of my dear friend Reginald William Rice, with which clubs we have enjoyed so many pleasant games together. Also in his gift of a fielding trophy to Bedford School, for award in the First XI. Appropriately enough, this was won two years ago by the son of Mr. Frank Crompton, the present Honorary Secretary of the Bedfordshire County Club. He was a Member of M.C.C.\n\nAfter leaving Cambridge, where he just failed to get his Blue, Herbert Orr went to Australia. His ability was recognised very soon; he played for the Melbourne Club and captained the first Western Australia team in 1892. Returning to England in 1899, he resumed his association with Bedfordshire and captained the side until 1915. With him at one period was A. F. Morcom, a fast bowler, the Cambridge Blue 1905 to 1907. In the match against Suffolk at Luton in 1908 Morcom created a record, which still stands in English cricket, by sending a bail 70\u00bc yards. Also in the Bedfordshire eleven at that time was R. W. Rice, the former Oxford University and Gloucestershire batsman.\n\nAfter the last war Herbert Orr invariably visited Australia to see the Test matches, and on one return trip of England with the Australian team he won The Ashes at deck quoits. A small silver urn containing cigarette ash was inscribed with the names of the players--W. H. Ponsford and W. A. Oldfield were of the party.\n\nPIPER MR. W. J., who died in July, combined his duty as cricket correspondent of the Derby Daily Telegraph with that of honorary scorer when Derby re-entered the first-class championships in 1895. For many years he attended all the Derbyshire matches at home and when on tour, earning wide popularity by his uniform and obliging manner in giving information required by colleagues. When journalistic work confined him largely to the office, he had to give up scoring for the county club, but he always retained a keen interest in the game and seldom missed a home match.\n\nRADCLIFFE, MR. OCTAVIUS GOLDNEY, a contemporary of W. G. Grace in the Gloucestershire XI, died at Cherwell, near Colne, on April 13, aged 81. A very steady batsman, he often opened the innings and could force the game when in the mood. At the Oval in 1884 he made 101 for Somerset before throwing in his lot with the neighbouring county. Another fine display was 104 not out at Lord's against Middlesex, and in 1889 he scored 101 not out against Kent at Canterbury. Equally good was his 116 against Lancashire at Old Trafford in 1891. In 1888 at Clifton he played specially well in scoring 99 off the Australian bowlers, and during these seasons he was so dependable that W. G. Grace took him to Australia with the side organised by Lord Sheffield in the autumn of 1891. Unfortunately Radcliffe failed to find his form at any period of the tour and did not play in one of the three matches against Australia. He appeared for Gentlemen against Players at the Oval in 1886 and at Hastings in 1889. Altogether in first-class cricket he averaged 22 runs an innings for an aggregate of 5,496 runs, and met with considerable success as a rather slow bowler. To such an extent could he adapt himself to the needs of the occasion that for Wiltshire against M.C.C. at Swindon in 1894 he batted 55 minutes without scoring, while in a match of less importance he hit four 6's and a 4 off an over of lobs from E. M. Grace at Alverton. He played for Wiltshire, the county of his birth, in 1884, and captained that county after giving up first-class cricket. At Dunstable against Bedfordshire in 1895 he did one of his best bowling performances--five wickets for 11 runs.\n\nRAPHAEL, MR. F. C., who died in June, took a prominent part on the legislative side of the game in New Zealand, being, in turn, honorary secretary of the Canterbury Cricket Association and of the New Zealand council during a period extending over 21 years until 1914, the game improving rapidly in the country during his tenure of office.\n\nRICHARDSON, HENRY, who died in March, aged 83, was a prominent bowler for Nottinghamshire some fifty years ago. He shared the honours in attack with Attewell, Shacklock and Flowers in 1889, when Nottinghamshire, Lancashire and Surrey were bracketed at the top of the Championship competition. Richardson took 53 wickets at 11.41 in thirteen matches, the full programme consisting of fourteen fixtures. Medium-paced, with both off and leg break, he kept an accurate length, seldom yielding runs readily. Occasionally he batted well when going in late, and at the Oval in 1887 he made 54 not out.\n\nBefore appearing first for his county in 1887, Richardson played for Gloucester, Newport (Mon.) and Liverpool clubs. In 1886 he took 149 wickets at 7 runs apiece for Liverpool, and so earned a place in the North and South match at Lord's on the following Whit-Monday, when the chief bowlers were engaged with their counties. He and J. T. Rawlin dismissed the South twice for an aggregate of 143. Richardson, bowling throughout both innings, disposed of nine batsmen for 64 runs, and the North Eleven won by six wickets in a day. This performance secured Richardson a place in the Nottinghamshire eleven. Altogether for the county Richardson dismissed 139 batsmen at an average cost of less than 14 runs. He joined the ground staff at Lord's in 1889, and received a benefit in 1919.\n\nROFFEY, SIR GEORGE WALTER, K. B., who died at Templecombe on March 13, aged 70, was in the Harrow XI of 1888 with F. S. Jackson and A. C. MacLaren.\n\nSTREATFEILD-MOORE, MR. ALEXANDER MCNEILL, a member of the Streatfeild family, so well known in Kent, died on December 30, aged 77. Elder brother of E. C. Streatfeild--a splendid all-round cricketer--he assumed by royal licence the name of Streatfeild-Moore in 1885. After two years in the Charterhouse XI, he became in 1883 captain of Sandhurst, and against R. M. A., Woolwich, he scored 118 not out. He played for Kent occasionally in the years 1885 to 1888. A free-hitting bat with good style, he was a useful slow bowler and a brilliant fieldsman.\n\nTINDALL, THE REV. HENRY CHARLES LENOX, a great runner and well-known cricketer, died on June 11 at Peasmarsh, Sussex, aged 77. Although a good all-round cricketer--useful bat with sound style, fast bowler and dashing fieldsman-- Tindall failed to get his blue at Cambridge at a time when University cricket was very strong. He appeared occasionally for Kent without doing much, but was prominent in Sussex club cricket. Among many good performances, especially for South Saxons, he took all ten wickets at a cost of only 25 runs for Hasting Rovers against Rye in 1906. In the Hastings Festival of 1894 he appeared for Gentlemen against Players. He set up a quarter-mile record in 1889 by winning the Amateur Championship in 48\u00bd seconds, and also won the half-mile in 1 minute 56? seconds. In 1886 he won the 100 yards and quarter-mile in the University sports, and for several years was prominent at all distances from 100 to 1,000 yards. At the private schools at Hurst Court, Ore, and High Croft he found many cricketers of promise. An originator of the Rye Golf Club, he became Chairman of the Committee.\n\nTUFNELL, MR. CARLETON FOWELL, died on May 26, aged 84. He left Eton when sixteen without a chance of getting into the Eleven, but played for Cooper's Hill from 1876 to 1878, being captain in the last two seasons. A useful batsman and medium-paced bowler, he played in a few matches for Kent in 1878 and 1879 before going to India. In May 1884 a report reached England of his death at Simla.\n\nTYSON, CECIL, appeared at a somewhat advanced age--32--in the Yorkshire XI, and met with startling success. In his opening match he set up a record for the county by scoring a century on his first appearance--exactly 100 not out. He followed with 80, also not out, in Yorkshire's second innings, but such a phenomenal feat did not prove the forerunner of big things. In fact, Tyson played in only two more first-class matches after his triumph at Southampton against Hampshire in 1921, making 29 against the Australians and 23 off the Lancashire bowlers after failure in the first innings. Yorkshire were then, as usual, very powerful, and Tyson was not young enough to fill occasional vacancies whilst training for a permanent place in the side. He joined a South Wales club with the idea of qualifying for Glamorgan, but in 1926 he returned to Yorkshire club cricket. He died at his home at Whitwood, near Leeds, on April 4, aged 51.\n\nWALKER, MR. LIVINGSTON, died on October 10, aged 61. A good club cricketer, he showed to such advantage with the London County XI under W. G. Grace that he twice found a place in the 1900 Surrey team, and became captain in 1903 at a time when high-class amateurs were scarce at Kennington Oval. Very popular and familiarly known as Livy, he went to Shanghai and so was lost to county cricket.\n\nWARD, REV. EDWARD EWER HARRISON, of Cambridge, prominent in the Cobden match of 1870, died on March 25 at his home at Gorleston, Norfolk, aged 92. His death five days before that of A. C. Bartholomew, of Oxford, left F. A. MacKinnon, Chief of the Scottish Clan of Morayshire, the oldest living Cambridge blue. Mr. MacKinnon, who also played in the 1870 match, now holds seniority among University as well as International cricketers. He went to Australia in 1878 with the team captained by Lord Harris, and took part in the only representative match for the tour, which Dave Gregory's eleven won by ten wickets. H. C. Maul, who died on October 10, aged 90, was another member of that side, but did not play in the game which long afterwards was classed as a Test. Mr. A. J. Webbe, number three for England in that match, was 86 in January this year; he passed away in February.\n\nBorn on July 16, 1847, at Timworth Hall, Suffolk, in the family of Harrison, E.E. adopted the surname Ward after leaving Bury St. Edmund's School, when Mr. J. H. Marshall, a Cambridge Blue of 1859, taught him spin and length.\n\nSo well did young Harrison master control of his left-hand medium-paced bowling that, despite somewhat moderate physique and indifferent health, he accomplished long spells of successful bowling in University and county cricket. Making the ball go with his arm, he often pitched well to the off and hit the leg stump, delivery from little higher than the shoulder helping this natural flight--so awkward for right-handed batsmen--quite different to imparted swerve with high delivery.\n\nWhen talking of his University experiences. Mr. Ward used to say: I was never robust, and knew my own strength and weakness, and always wanted to be my own captain. During Oxford's second innings in the `Cobden' match there was a stand after I had taken the second and third wickets, and I asked to be given a rest. My captain agreed, and when I was put on again I soon took four more wickets.\n\nIn an interview at Mulbarton Rectory with an Eastern Daily Press representative some twenty years ago, Mr. Ward fully described Cobden's feat, about which many varying descriptions have appeared. This may be accepted as authentic.\n\nFrom the first ball a run was made by Hill, and the match stood two to tie, three to win, and three wickets to go down. One hundred pounds to one on Oxford was offered and taken. The second ball Butler hit to cover point, a hard catch which Bourne managed to hold. Two more wickets were left--Stewart's and Belcher's. Cobden's third ball bowled Belcher off his pads. Stewart, the last man, was deadly pale and nervous when he walked past me, padded and gloved. A dead silence came over the players and spectators. Cobden crammed his cap on his head, rushed up to the bowling crease, and bowled what I have always thought was a plain long hop. Anyhow, the bails flew, and amid a scene of the wildest excitement Cambridge won by two runs!\n\nThe Hon. Robert Lyttelton, in the Badminton Library account of the match, did justice to Ward's share in the victory. He wrote: The unique performance of Cobden has unduly cast in the shade Mr. Ward's performance in the second innings. It was a good wicket and Oxford had certainly on the whole a good batting eleven. Yet Mr. Ward bowled 32 overs for 29 runs and got six wickets, and of these five were certainly the best batsmen in the side. He clean bowled Messrs. Fortescue, Pauncefote, and Tylecote, and got out in other ways Messrs. Ottaoay, Townshend, and Francis. It is hardly too much to say that in this innings Mr. Ward got the six best wickets and Mr. Cobden the four worst. In the whole match Mr. Ward got nine wickets for 62 runs, and this again, let it be said, on an excellent ground.\n\nWard was doubtful about playing in the 1871 match, which, curiously enough, made further University cricket history. S. E. Butler took all ten wickets in the Cambridge first innings, another record. The Dark Blues won by eight wickets. Owing to illness Ward wanted to stand down, but his captain, Bill Yardley, of high renown, would not hear of this. That Ward's knowledge of himself was sound came true, for, though bowling 36 overs (four balls each) at a cost of only 38 runs, he did not get a wicket\n\nWhen playing for Suffolk, Ward met with much success. At Bury he once scored 46 out of 60 for the last wicket after dismissing six men cheaply, and in 1872 he took 13 M.C.C. Wickets for 46 runs. He became Secretary of the Suffolk County Club on its revival in 1876, and, as a prominent member of the side, excelled against Norfolk that year, taking 11 wickets at Bury.\n\nThirteen I Zingari wickets once fell to him for 47.\n\nMr. Ward gave 59 years of service to the Church of England, holding appointments in Suffolk, Northumberland, Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Norkfolk, his last living being at Mulbarton, where he ministered for 24 years before resigning in 1931.\n\nWHALLEY-TOOKER, MR. E., died on November 23, aged 77, and his passing removed a link with the old Hambledon club, renowned as a cradle of cricket some 150 years ago. The Broad Halfpenny ground had been ploughed up for farm land, and Whalley-Tooker, a descendant of a member of the original Hambledon club, set about the task of securing the field for cricket again. It was got into condition for a match in July 1925 between Winchester College, then given the possession of the land, and Hambledon. Mr. Whalley-Tooker captained the side representing Hambledon and led his team to victory.\n\nWOOD, MR. LIONEL CHARLES KINGSLEY, who died on December 30 in his 62nd year, was secretary of the Staten Island club from 1928 to 1940. A sound opening batsman with strong defence, he showed to some advantage when at Oxford University, but did not reach good enough form for a Blue. A useful Rugby football player, he acted for a time as secretary of the Pilgrims Club, New York. He was born in Leicestershire.\n\nWRIGHT, WALTER, one of the first bowlers capable of swerving the ball to an appreciable extent, died at Leigh, Lancashire, on March 22, aged 84. Born at Hucknell, he played for Nottinghamshire from 1879 to 1886, for Kent from 1888 to 1899, and finished a long and varied career on the first-class cricket field as umpire. Bowling left-hand above medium pace, with good control of length, he used to trouble most batsmen at the start of an innings. His swerve, then almost a novelty, and speed from the turf rendered him extremely difficult, and he accomplished some remarkable performances. At Trent Bridge he once dismissed six Yorkshiremen for ten runs, and five M.C.C. wickets fell to him for one run on the same ground. During eight seasons when comparatively few first-class county matches were played, he took 193 wickets for Nottinghamshire at 18 runs apiece. His association with the county of his birth ended through some dispute over remuneration for a match with the Australian team of 1886. He then qualified for Kent, and for twelve years enjoyed much success, chiefly when sharing the attack with Nutty Martin, another left-hander of less pace. Before the ground was levelled, these two went through many sides at Moat Park, Maidstone. Wright, with the slope favouring his swerve, made the ball go very fast down-hill; Martin, using the left-hander's natural break-back, afforded a marked contrast--a leg-break to the right-handed batsman. Altogether for Kent, Walter Wright took 725 wickets at less than 20 runs each. Two notable performances against Middlesex, at Canterbury and Lord's, were identical--thirteen wickets for 106 runs in each match. On a third occasion thirteen wickets fell to him, this time at a cost of 150 runs, when Nottinghamshire visited Maidstone in 1895.\n\nIn 1880 a team of Canadians lost their best man, a deserter from the Horse Guards, and Wright was engaged to play for them. In his first match he scored 80 runs and took 14 wickets, but payment being uncertain in an ill-starred venture, Wright soon left the team and the tour broke down in mid-season. His ability as a right-handed batsman was shown in 1883, when, in the match with Gloucestershire, he was sent in shortly before time on the first evening, withstood the attack throughout the next day, and when the innings closed on the third morning he remained unbeaten with 127 runs to his credit. For Mote Park in 1887 he scored 237 against Free Foresters.\n\nDuring his period as umpire, Wright officiated in the match at Taunton when James Phillips, standing at square leg, no-balled Tyler for doubtful delivery. Disagreeing with his colleague, Wright would not allow more than the regulation number of balls (four) to the over. At a time when single-wicket matches were popular, Wright in 1885 opposed eleven men and won very easily; he made 61 runs and dismissed his opponents in each innings for six.\n\nIn his young days, thanks to his quickness off the mark, he was an excellent field. His sprinting powers were demonstrated when he won the Sheffield Handicaps in 1880 and 1881--races which were stopped eventually because of the extensive betting with which they were associated. At one time he was considered to be the second fastest runner in the world at 130 yards.\n\nAfter his long spell in first-class cricket, Walter Wright turned out for Berkshire in 1904, and for some years was coach at Radley College. He also acted as trainer to Association football clubs.\n\n\u00a9 John Wisden & Co"}, {"url": "https://www.isenberg.umass.edu/people/george-milne", "page_content": "Swani, Kunal and George R.
