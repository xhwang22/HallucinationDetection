Best known for his work in the history of science and medicine and described as \u201cthe dean\u201d of his fields by historian Dorothy Ross, John had a reach that far exceeded his fields of scholarly expertise.\n\nJohn was born on July 14, 1929, in Boulder, Colorado. After graduating from West Seattle High School in Washington state (he was proud of his excellent urban public-school education), he accepted a scholarship to Stanford University, where he took his bachelor\u2019s degree. He went \u201ceast,\u201d as he put it, to the University of Wisconsin for his master\u2019s degree, after which he returned to Stanford for his PhD (1958). John always talked more about his teachers than his schools. After he informed his seminar students that the course descended directly from Frederick Jackson Turner, he went through the lineage of his teachers and theirs. He taught students never to stop asking questions and searching for answers, and he expected deep research, concise writing, and historiographical significance.\n\nJohn\u2019s own work regularly disrupted traditional historiography, and altogether, he created and enjoyed an enviable career that extended far beyond his retirement. He spent most of his academic career at OSU, but he also taught and held prestigious research fellowships at the universities of Sydney, Cambridge, Chicago, and Melbourne; Stanford and Johns Hopkins universities; Bowdoin College; and numerous other institutions. He was president of the American Association for the History of Medicine (AAHM) from 1990 to 1992 and edited the Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences from 1997 to 2000. He lectured internationally, and scholars have published anthologies and held special conferences to celebrate the significance of his pioneering work to their fields. John published 10 monographs and nearly a hundred articles over the course of his career. His last book, Health Care in America (2015), is a masterful history of medical practice in the United States that stands as a fitting culmination of his scholarship.\n\nJohn was deadly serious about his work and historical scholarship generally. He did not suffer fools gladly, and he had a tough, often unreadable shell. He was also kind, generous, and concerned about other people\u2019s happiness. Susan Reverby described him as \u201can early supporter of young scholars within the AAHM and wherever we turned up to give papers if he was at the same meetings.\u201d James Gilliam, who studied Chinese history at OSU, was John\u2019s teaching assistant during the early 1980s and said that John was \u201cas much or more responsible for my earning my PhD as anyone on my committee.\u201d John and his wife of 59 years, Marjorie Spencer Burnham, always hosted newcomers to the history department soon after their arrival. In 2001, Marjorie founded a history of medicine lecture series for the OSU Medical Heritage Center and the history department. They were also instrumental in the funding of an endowed lectureship in the medical school. When two colleagues died, John located their manuscripts and found people to finish them; both books won prizes.\n\nAs serious as John was about scholarship, he had a wicked and deadpan sense of humor. He could appreciate being the subject of the joke himself. After he told me about the fabulous prize his book After Freud Left (2012) had just won, I asked, \u201cWhich prize?\u201d He answered that it was for the cover. (The designer really was brilliant.) Although it might not have been a joke (one could not always tell with John), when it came time to talk with one of his children about sex, John presented him with a two-volume work on sex education and insisted that he would answer any questions his son had once he finished reading it.\n\nJohn will long be remembered not only for his contributions to the history of medicine, psychology, psychiatry, science, technology, and culture, but also for all the ways he supported his university, his profession, and countless individuals in and outside the profession.\n\nStephanie J.

It was the U.S.'s first major broadcast network. Ownership of the network was split between RCA (a majority partner at 50%), its founding corporate parent General Electric (which owned 30%), and Westinghouse (which owned the remaining 20%).\n\nIn 1929, at the age of only 11 years old, John was alive when American Samoa officially became a U.S. territory. Although a part of the United States since 1900, the Ratification Act of 1929 vested \"all civil, judicial, and military powers in the President of the United States of America\".\n\nIn 1935, he was 17 years old when on August 14, the Social Security Act was signed into law. The purpose was to \"provide federal assistance to those unable to work\". The law established the Social Security Administration whose primary focus was to \"provide aid for the elderly, the unemployed, and children\". The Act survived many Supreme Court challenges and the Administration continues until today.\n\nIn 1947, in the year of John Burnham's passing, in June, the Marshall Plan was proposed to help European nations recover economically from World War II. It passed the conservative Republican Congress in March of 1948. After World War I, the economic devastation of Germany caused by burdensome reparations payments led to the rise of Hitler. The Allies didn't want this to happen again and the Marshall Plan was devised to make sure that those conditions didn't arise again."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/john-burnham-2/", "page_content": "John William Burnham (6 June 1839 \u2013 20 April 1914) was an English cricketer who played for Derbyshire between 1871 and 1876. He was a member of the team that played Derbyshire's first match in May 1871.\n\nBurnham was born at Nottingham, the son of William Burnham, a joiner and his wife Catherine. He became a clerk and in 1863 he was playing for Suffolk and in one match for an All England XI. In 1870 he played several club games for Burnley. He joined Derbyshire in the 1871 season and took part in Derbyshire's first-ever match as a county side, an innings victory over Lancashire. He played the return game later in the season, and played again for Derbyshire in the 1872 season in both fixtures between Derbyshire and Lancashire. Also in 1872 he played some games for Prince's Club in London. In the 1873 season he only played one match for Derbyshire against Lancashire. He did not play again until the 1876 season when his final match, as a first-class player, was against Kent, in which he was bowled out by Test cricketer Charlie Absolom.\n\nBurnham was a right-handed batsman and played eleven innings in six first class matches with an average of 5.00 and a top score of 31. In 1881 he was living at Litchurch. Burnham umpired one game during the 1879 season, three years after giving up the first-class game.\n\nBurnham died at Derby.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.ancientfaces.com/person/john-burnham-birth-1931-death-1995/82676876", "page_content": "Refresh this page to see various historical events that occurred during John's lifetime.\n\nIn 1931, in the year that John Burnham was born, on May 1st, the Empire State Building opened in New York City. At 1,454 feet (including the roof and antenna), it was the tallest building in the world until the World Trade Center's North Tower was built in 1970. (It is now the 34th tallest.) Opening at the beginning of the Great Depression, most of the offices in the Empire State Building remained unoccupied for years and the observation deck was an equal source of revenue and kept the building profitable.\n\nIn 1955, when he was 24 years old, in January, President Eisenhower sent direct aid to South Vietnam. In February, U.S. advisors were sent to train troops.\n\nIn 1975, when he was 44 years old, on September 5th, Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme tried to assassinate President Ford in Sacramento, California. She failed when her gun wouldn't fire. President Ford escaped a second assassination attempt 17 days later on September 22 when Sarah Jane Moore tried to shoot him in San Francisco. A bystander saw her raise her arm, grabbed it, and the shot went wild.\n\nIn 1980, John was 49 years old when on April 24th, a rescue attempt was begun in the Iranian Hostage Crisis. The attempt failed and 8 US servicemen were killed. Eight helicopters had been sent for the mission, but only 5 arrived in operating condition., Since the military had advised that the mission be aborted if there were fewer than 6 helicopters, President Carter stopped it. Upon leaving, a helicopter collided with a transport plane and the men were killed.\n\nIn 1995, in the year of John Burnham's passing, on May 19th, the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil - before 9/11 - took place in Oklahoma City. A truck bomb went off outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown - killing 68 people, injuring more than 680 others, and destroying one-third of the building. The most disturbing images were of children - a daycare center was hit by the bomb. The deadliest incident of domestic terrorism ever, Timothy McVeigh, Terry Nichols, and Michael Fortier were convicted of the bombing."}, {"url": "https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/john-burnham-derby-24-mtm6d", "page_content": "This database contains family trees submitted to Ancestry by users who have indicated that their tree can be viewed by all Ancestry subscribers.These trees can change over time as users edit, remove, or otherwise modify the data in their trees.

The parade was held as a way to promote the opening of the \u201cWorld\u2019s Largest Store\u201d and its 1 million square feet of retail space in Manhattan\u2019s Herald Square. The parade was 6 miles long and included floats, Macy's employees dressed as clowns, cowboys, and sword-wielding knights, and animals from Central Park Zoo. Santa Claus, of course, brought up the rear - opening the Christmas shopping season for Macy's.\n\nIn 1930, when he was merely 6 years old, on August 6th, N.Y. Supreme Court Judge Joseph Crater went through papers in his office, destroyed some of them, withdrew all his money from the bank - $5,150, sold his stock, met friends at a restaurant for dinner and disappeared after getting into a taxi (or walking down the street - his friends' testimony later changed). His disappearance was reported to the police on September 3rd - almost a month later. His wife didn't know what happened, his fellow Justices had no idea, and his mistresses (he had several) said that they didn't know. While his disappearance was front page news, his fate was never discovered and after 40 years the case was closed, still without knowing if Crater was dead or alive.\n\nIn 1937, he was only 13 years old when on May 28th, the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge opened to cars. Taking 5 years to build, the 4,200-foot-long suspension bridge was an engineering marvel of its time - 11 men died during construction. The \"international orange\" color was chosen because it resisted rust and fading. To the present, it is the symbol of the City that is known throughout the world.\n\nIn 1943, in the year of Hubert John Burnham's passing, on June 20th through June 22nd, the Detroit Race Riot erupted at Belle Isle Park. The rioting spread throughout the city (made worse by false rumors of attacks on blacks and whites) and resulted in the deployment of 6,000 Federal troops. 34 people were killed, (25 of them black) - mostly by white police or National Guardsmen, 433 were wounded (75 percent of them black) and an estimated $2 million of property was destroyed. The same summer, there were riots in Beaumont, Texas and Harlem, New York."}, {"url": "https://www.ancientfaces.com/person/john-d-burnham-birth-1913-death-2001/54362180", "page_content": "Refresh this page to see various historical events that occurred during John's lifetime.\n\nIn 1913, in the year that John D Burnham was born, ratified in February the 16th Amendment, establishing a Federal income tax, became law. Previously, customs duties (tariffs) and excise taxes were the primary sources of federal revenue. With the passage of the 16th Amendment, incomes of couples exceeding $4,000, as well as those of single persons earning $3,000 or more, were subject to a 1% Federal tax (that would be about $98,000 and $74,000 now). Rates rose to 7% for incomes over half a million dollars. Less than 1% of the population was subject to income tax.\n\nIn 1936, John was 23 years old when on November 2nd, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) debuted the world's first regular high-definition television service. The channel had a short schedule - Monday through Saturday, 3:00p to 4:00p and 9:00p to 10:00p. The first broadcast was \"Opening of the BBC Television Service\".\n\nIn 1958, at the age of 45 years old, John was alive when on January 1st, the European Economic Community (Common Market) came into operation. The first members were France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. The Common Market was formed as a way to strengthen members' economies and deter wars in Europe.\n\nIn 1970, at the age of 57 years old, John was alive when on May 4th, four students at Kent State University in Ohio were shot and killed by National Guardsmen. The students were at a peaceful demonstration protesting the invasion of Cambodia by US forces. There had been precedent for the killing of American college students. The previous year, on May 15th, Alameda County Sheriffs used shotguns against U.C. Berkeley students at a protest for People's Park. One student died, one was blinded, 128 were injured.\n\nIn 1987, by the time he was 74 years old, on October 19th, stock exchanges around the world crashed. Beginning in Hong Kong then spreading to Europe, the crash then hit the United States. It was called Black Monday. The Dow Jones fell 508 points to 1,738.74 (22.61%)."}, {"url": "https://www.ancientfaces.com/person/john-burnham-birth-1909-death-2005/5447363", "page_content": "Refresh this page to see various historical events that occurred during John's lifetime.\n\nIn 1909, in the year that John Burnham was born, the New York Times published the first movie review. It was a report on D.W. Griffith's movie \"Pippa Passes\" also called \"The Song of Conscience\", a silent film. The review said that this work was moving away from \"lurid material that attracted the wrath of censors and concerned citizens and toward more respectable ends. The movie was the story of a young female factory worker, on her day off, wandering and singing - thus changing the hearts of those around her towards good.\n\nIn 1913, he was just 4 years old when ratified in February the 16th Amendment, establishing a Federal income tax, became law.

Less than 1% of the population was subject to income tax.\n\nIn 1920, by the time he was only 11 years old, speakeasies replaced saloons as the center of social activity. After the 18th Amendment was ratified and selling alcohol became illegal, saloons closed and speakeasies took their place. Speakeasies, also called a blind pig or blind tiger, were \"so called because of the practice of speaking quietly about such a place in public, or when inside it, so as not to alert the police or neighbors\". There were a lot of them and they were very popular. And where saloons often prohibited women, they were encouraged at speakeasies because of the added profits.\n\nIn 1938, by the time he was 29 years old, on June 25th (a Saturday) the Fair Labor Standards Act was signed into law by President Roosevelt (along with 120 other bills). The Act banned oppressive child labor, set the minimum hourly wage at 25 cents, and established the maximum workweek at 44 hours. It faced a lot of opposition and in fighting for it, Roosevelt said \"Do not let any calamity-howling executive with an income of $1,000 a day, ...tell you...that a wage of $11 a week is going to have a disastrous effect on all American industry.\"\n\nIn 1965, by the time he was 56 years old, on March 8th, the first US combat troops arrived in Vietnam. The 3500 Marines joined 23,000 \"advisors\" already in South Vietnam.
