A true pioneer, Willie was the first African-American team captain in franchise history and currently 13th on the all-time Knicks scoring list. pic.twitter.com/hv6YsiQ4ER \u2014 NEW YORK KNICKS (@nyknicks) November 25, 2018\n\nHis Path To The Knicks\n\nNaulls was born in Dallas, Texas in 1934, but before long his family moved to San Pedro, California in order to seek a more diverse and welcoming community. He loved Major League Baseball as a child and in high school was originally on track to play baseball, but the 6\u20196\u201d, 225-pound athlete wound up turning to basketball and becoming an All-American at UCLA under legendary coach John Wooden.\n\nNaulls was a second round draft pick of the St. Louis Hawks in 1956, selected in a draft class that included Bill Russell, Elgin Baylor and Tommy Heinsohn. Naulls was not necessarily a fan of the team that took him, seeing as they were stationed in the still-segregated Southern U.S., according to an interview he gave to NBA.com in December 2015.\n\n\u201cMy parents took us out of the South to experience the freedom of competition and of choice of the integrating West Coast,\u201d Naulls said in the interview. \u201cTo go to St. Louis and its segregated hotels, restaurants, cabs, living districts and attitude was a cultural shock. As a 21-year-old man, I had rarely experienced that since I was eight years old.\u201d\n\nLucky for Naulls, his stay in St. Louis did not last long; on December 10th, 1956, only 19 games into his rookie season, Naulls was traded to the Knicks.\n\nNaulls\u2019 Career As A \u2018Bocker\n\nNaulls quickly carved out a significant role for himself with the Knicks, averaging 18.1 points and 11.8 rebounds in his first full season with the team and earning a spot on the Eastern Conference All-Star team. He was one of only three black players selected as All-Stars that season, the others being Russell and Maurice Stokes.\n\nDuring the roughly seven seasons he was with the Knicks, Naulls made four All-Star teams, and his overall Knicks stats stand at 19.3 points and 10.7 rebounds a game. He averaged more than 20 points a game three times for the Knicks, including during the 1961-62 season when he put up 25 points and 11.6 rebounds per contest.\n\nThe Knicks made the playoffs only once during Naulls\u2019 tenure, in 1959, when the team\u2019s 40-32 record was good for second place in the East. The Knicks lost in the division semifinals that year to the Syracuse Nationals, two games to none.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Naulls was named Knicks\u2019 captain, becoming the first African-American athlete to earn the title for any team in any of the major American sports.\n\nOn March 2, 1962, Naulls posted 31 points and 7 rebounds in a 169-147 loss to the Philadelphia Warriors. Naulls\u2019 strong showing represented the seventh straight game he had scored 30 or more points, setting a franchise record that wouldn\u2019t be broken for almost five decades (Amar\u2019e Stoudemire scored 30 or more in nine consecutive games in 2010). Naulls\u2019 record-setting night against the Warriors was overshadowed by Wilt Chamberlain, who scored 100 points and grabbed 25 boards.\n\nToday, Naulls sits at 13th on the Knicks all-time scoring list, one spot behind John Starks and just ahead of Gerald Wilkins. His 8,318 points as a Knick are more than than the likes of Bernard King, Latrell Sprewell and Stephon Marbury, among others big names. His 5,015 rebounds is good for 5th on the Knicks all-time rebounds list, behind only Patrick Ewing, Willis Reed, Charles Oakley and Harry Gallatin.\n\nHis Post-Knicks Career as a Champion\n\nIn December 1962, Naulls was traded to the San Francisco Warriors, and in September 1963 he was traded again, this time to a Boston Celtics team that was in the middle of an absolutely dominant stretch of basketball that included 11 championships between 1957 and 1969.\n\nNaulls notched three titles as a member of the Celtics, in 1964, 1965 and 1966. He retired from the NBA in 1966.\n\nIn 1964, Naulls was part of the NBA\u2019s first all-black starting lineup with the Celtics, in a game that was ironically played against his former team, the St. Louis Hawks\n\nFor his career, Naulls averaged 15.8 points and 9.1 rebounds a game. His career field goal percentage was 40.6 percent, and he shot free throws at a clip of 81.2 percent.\n\nLife After The NBA\n\nNaulls focused on business once his NBA career was over, and his original pursuits included owning an auto dealership in Los Angeles and investing in \u201centerprises that he felt could provide jobs in black communities,\u201d according to the New York Times.\n\nIn 1993, he formed Willie Naulls Ministries, a non-profit venture that aims to \u201cequip believers to testify the Truth of how to live victoriously in God\u2019s Kingdom here on earth by teaching Biblically based principles for personal growth of spirit, soul, and body,\u201d according to its website.\n\nNaulls is survived by his wife, two sons and two daughters, and six grandchildren, along with a legion of Knicks fans who appreciate his contributions to both the team and the world of sports at large.

His 582 field-goal attempts during the 1955-56 season also is a school record.\n\nWhile the Bruins were in Lexington for the holiday tournament during his sophomore season, Naulls helped integrate the bus the team rode on as well as the theater where they watched a movie and the hotel where they slept together in the basement\u2019s boiler room on Army cots.\n\n\u201cThe humiliation was borne by each of us \u2014 black and white together,\u201d Naulls wrote in his book. \u201cWe took turns showering in a basement employee restroom and ate together in a special banquet room next to the kitchen.\u201d\n\nNaulls averaged 15.5 points and 11.4 rebounds per game while at UCLA, helping the Bruins win a Pacific Coast Conference championship and advance to the NCAA tournament during his final season. He later helped recruit point guard Walt Hazzard, the star of the Bruins\u2019 first national championship team in 1964.\n\nBill Russell and K.C. Jones, who won two NCAA titles with the University of San Francisco, called Naulls their greatest competitor and invited him to join their team on a U.S. State Department-sponsored tour of Central and South America.\n\nThe St. Louis Hawks selected Naulls ninth overall in the 1956 draft before trading him to the Knicks after 19 games. He went on to become a four-time All-Star during a 10-year NBA career in which he averaged 15.8 points and 9.1 rebounds per game.\n\nNaulls returned to Los Angeles after retiring following the Celtics\u2019 1966 championship, completing his undergraduate degree at UCLA. He was voted into the school\u2019s Athletics Hall of Fame in 1986 and remained an active supporter of his alma mater, serving on the board of directors of the UCLA Alumni Assn. and becoming the school\u2019s first basketball alumnus to endow a scholarship for the basketball program.\n\nA native of Dallas who moved to San Pedro when he was 9, Naulls spent the final five decades of his life helping underserved youth through a nonprofit organization he founded and became a minister who wrote eight books to inspire others.\n\nNaulls is survived by his wife of 40 years, Anne Van de Water Naulls; children Lisa, Shannon, Jonah and Malaika; and six grandchildren.

He served young people growing up in communities similar to those of his childhood in San Pedro and Watts and founded a non-profit organization.

A graduate of the University of California, Los Angeles, where he played for Hall of Fame coaching legend John Wooden, Naulls was selected with the ninth pick of the 1956 NBA draft by the (then) St. Louis (now, Atlanta) Hawks.\n\nHe played 19 games with that organization before being traded to the New York Knicks early in his rookie year. He spent the bulk of his career with the Knicks, who named him the first Black team captain in league history.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the last trade of his career of course, or you would not be reading about him on this site."}, {"url": "https://beyondthedash.com/obituary/willie-naulls-1071563908", "page_content": "Originally published by The Associated Press on November 29, 2018\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Willie Naulls, the former UCLA star who was a four-time All-Star with the New York Knicks and won three NBA championships with the Boston Celtics, has died. He was 84.\n\nNaulls died on Thanksgiving at his home in Laguna Niguel, south of Los Angeles, UCLA said. The cause was respiratory failure resulting from Churg-Strauss syndrome, a rare condition that can restrict blood flow to vital organs and tissues.\n\nThere was a moment of silence for Naulls before UCLA's basketball game Wednesday night.\n\nAfter playing for UCLA from 1954-56, Naulls was selected with the ninth overall pick in the NBA draft by the St. Louis Hawks.\n\nBut he spent just 19 games with the Hawks, calling it a \"culture shock\" to see the segregation that existed in St. Louis, the likes of which he hadn't seen since he was eight before moving from Dallas to Los Angeles. He was then traded to the Knicks.\n\nBoston won titles in 1964, '65 and '66, Naulls' final three seasons.\n\nAlong with Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones and Tom Sanders, Naulls comprised the first all-black lineup in the history of integrated pro sports in December 1964 when Naulls replaced injured Tom Heinsohn as a starter.\n\nWith the Knicks, Naulls became the first black to be named a captain of a pro team in a major American sport. He averaged a double-double (19.3 points and 10.7 rebounds) during his seven-year tenure with the Knicks.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 forward also played for the San Francisco Warriors during his 10-year pro career.\n\nNaulls averaged 15.5 points and 11.4 rebounds playing for three years at UCLA.\n\nHe set UCLA's single-game rebounding record with 28 against Arizona State on Jan. 28, 1956, a mark that still stands. He led the team in rebounding each of his three seasons.\n\nPlaying for future Hall of Fame coach John Wooden, he helped the Bruins win the Pacific Coast Conference title as a senior in 1956, when he earned All-America honours. At the time his college career ended, he was the school's career leader in points (1,225) and rebounds (900).\n\nAfter retiring from the NBA, Naulls returned to UCLA and completed his undergraduate degree. He earned a master's in theology from Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena in 1993.\n\nNaulls worked with underserved youth for over 50 years and founded a non-profit organization that raised money for free summer basketball camps for junior high and high school boys.\n\nNaulls is survived by his wife of 40 years, Anne Van de Water Naulls; children Lisa, Shannon, Joanh and Malaika; and six grandchildren.\n\nThe Associated Press"}]}
