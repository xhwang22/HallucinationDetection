Koscielny played as a fullback for Guingamp in most of the matches.However, he felt that center back was his forte and this made him join Tours FC to take a chance at center back.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his debut season with Tours FC in 2007, Koscielny showed remarkable progress and played a major role in his team\u2019s promotion to Ligue 1. He was also named in the best XI of the season.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe center back continued his good form with Lorient FC in 2009 where he was regarded as one of the best players in his position. He was developing reputation as a clever and an agile defender. His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a38.45 million the following season.\n\n\n\n\n\nDebut\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurent Koscielny had the opportunity to represent Poland but decided to ply his trade with France. He made his first appearance for France on the 9th of February, 2011 in a friendly match against United States. Koscielny played the entire game and his side sealed a 1-0 victory. On the 4th of June, 2016, Koscielny scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland.\n\n\n\n\n\nRise to Glory\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny had a great debut season with Arsenal. He was constantly making great tackles and preventing the opposition from penetrating their back line. In 2011, Koscielny had one of his best performances till date that saw Arsenal beat Barcelona 2-1 in the round of 16 Champions League tie.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman was a great asset to the team as apart from acting as a defender, he had a great goal scoring ability.

This has forced him out of a few crucial encounters and has affected the team\u2019s performance. He has missed more games due to suspension and not because of injury.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe center back must work on preventing harsh tackles so as to represent Arsenal in more and more games and increase their chances of winning more trophies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman is yet to win the Premier League with Arsenal.

At 30 years old, Koscielny is a fantastically experienced center back at the club level, although he has already been surpassed by Varane for international appearances.\n\nDespite making just 23 appearances for his country, Koscielny has played over 300 matches for the first team at club level. Since moving from France in 2010, he has plied his trade in Arsenal\u2019s back line, sometimes slotting in at right back, but more often at center back (ESPN). He has been a central figure for the Gunners since his arrival, and Arsenal have endured great success since his arrival.\n\nKoscielny\u2019s style of play can be considered traditional. Alongside Per Mertesacker, his powerful but slow moving center back partner at Arsenal, Koscielny has proven his fleet of foot and good tactical awareness. He is also quite useful from corner kicks in attack as well. He has even scored 15 goals in his time at Arsenal, none bigger than the one below, which not only demonstrates his offensive ability but also his clutch ability in big game situations.\n\nKoscielny equalizes for Arsenal in the FA Cup final (YouTube)\n\nHow to cite this article: \u201cProjected France Starting XI at Euro 2016\u201d Written by Jeremy Roth and David Talpalar (2016), European Cup 2016 Guide, Soccer Politics Blog, Duke University, http://sites.duke.edu/wcwp/tournament-guides/european-cup-2016-guide/identity-and-the-french-national-team/notable-players-in-the-projected-french-squad-with-african-heritage/laurent-koscielny/ (accessed on (date))."}, {"url": "https://www.football.london/all-about/laurent-koscielny", "page_content": "Laurent Koscielny 14:00, 26 APR 2022\n\nStory Saved\n\nYou can find this story in My Bookmarks.\n\nOr by navigating to the user icon in the top right."}, {"url": "https://medium.com/@gentie/history-of-laurent-koscielny-5047b6fe8a03", "page_content": "History Of Laurent Koscielny gentie \u00b7 Follow \u00b7 Feb 13, 2018 10 min read -- Listen Share\n\nLaurent Koscielny (French pronunciation: [lo\u0281\u0251\u0303 kosj\u025bl\u0272i]; born 10 September 1985) is a French professional footballer who plays as a centre back for English club Arsenal and the France national team. He is vice-captain of Arsenal.\n\nBorn in Tulle, Koscielny began his football career playing for a host of youth clubs before moving to Guingamp in 2003, where he quickly progressed through the youth ranks, making his professional debut the following season. After becoming frustrated at being played out of position as a right back, he joined Tours for an undisclosed fee, quickly establishing himself as the team\u2019s star player in his desired position, ultimately aiding in the club\u2019s promotion into Ligue 1, while also being named in the Ligue 2 Team of the Season.[3] Koscielny continued his impressive performances following a \u20ac1.7 million transfer to fellow French outfit Lorient in 2009, receiving multiple plaudits for his performances, largely cultivating a reputation as a clever, agile, ball-playing defender.[3] His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a38.45 million the following season.\n\nFollowing his arrival to England, Koscielny has widely been regarded to be one of the best players in his position, as well as one of the best in the world.[4][5] He has since established himself as a core component in the Arsenal first team, as well as contributing with a host of individual performances, including aiding in ending the club\u2019s nine-year trophy drought, scoring a crucial equalizer en route to winning the FA Cup in 2014. He was also crucial in further club successes that followed, winning another two FA Cups and the FA Community Shield on three occasions.\n\nDespite having the ability to represent Poland, Koscielny instead decided to represent France, and first appeared up for the national team against Brazil in February 2011.[6] Koscielny has since become a regular starter for the nation in every major tournament that they have appeared in, including UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup, while also leading France to the final of UEFA Euro 2016. He scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland in 2016,[7] and has since amassed forty-nine appearances for the national side.\n\nPrior to the beginning of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Koscielny announced that he would be retiring from international football after the competition, and thus no longer be playing for France.\n\nKoscielny was born in Tulle, Corr\u00e8ze. His career began in 2004 with Guingamp, a team that had produced such talents as Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. Three years later, Koscielny was forced to take stock and drop down to the French third tier. He made 47 appearances for Guingamp, between 2004 and 2007, mostly as a right fullback.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2007, Koscielny joined Tours FC, deciding that he wanted a chance at centre back. He showed remarkable improvement in aerial ability and positional awareness that limited him to just three yellow cards. During the 2008\u201309 season, Koscielny made 34 Ligue 2 appearances, scoring 5 goals from defence, and was named in the division\u2019s best XI at the end of the season.\n\nArsenal confirmed the signing on 7 July 2010 and Koscielny was handed the club\u2019s number 6 shirt, previously worn by Philippe Senderos, who had moved to Fulham earlier in the summer. Wenger explained he bought Koscielny due to the fact he added height to the team and Arsenal were low on centre backs.[10] Koscielny made his debut against Barnet in a pre-season friendly in July 2010. One month later in his competitive debut against Liverpool at Anfield, he was sent off in the 94th minute for a second bookable offence. Both of his yellow cards were shown beyond 90 minutes. The game ended in a 1\u20131 draw with both teams having debut players sent off.[11] He scored his first goal for Arsenal on 11 September 2010, in a 4\u20131 win against Bolton Wanderers.[12]\n\nKoscielny made his debut in European competition on 15 September 2010, when he partnered S\u00e9bastien Squillaci in a 6\u20130 win over Braga at the Emirates Stadium.

On 1 February, he scored his third goal of the season, which proved to be the winner in a 2\u20131 turn around victory over Everton. Koscielny had arguably his best performance to date for Arsenal in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16 match against Barcelona. The match ended in a 2\u20131 home win for Arsenal. Koscielny\u2019s performances were applauded and praised in many media reports of the game. Former Arsenal defender, Martin Keown, said his performance was \u201cimpressive\u201d and \u201cmagnificent throughout\u201d.[13] On 27 February, in the last minute of the 2011 Football League Cup Final, Koscielny was involved in a mix-up with his goalkeeper Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny, which resulted in Birmingham City striker Obafemi Martins scoring the winning goal.[14]\n\n2011\u201312 season\n\nKoscielny and Fernando Torres in a Premier League match on 21 April 2012.\n\nKoscielny started the 2011\u201312 season alongside Thomas Vermaelen in central defence.

The goal was header from a free-kick in first half stoppage time against Crystal Palace at the Emirates Stadium.[29] After sustaining an achilles tendon injury during the October international break, Koscielny was absent from the Arsenal team for seven weeks.[30] On 29 November, he returned to Arsenal\u2019s starting line-up alongside Per Mertesacker in central defence, as the Gunners kept a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 victory against West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns.[31] In the team\u2019s following fixture at home to Southampton, Koscielny helped Arsenal to record a second consecutive clean sheet and 1\u20130 win.[32]\n\nOn 11 January 2015, Koscielny scored the first goal in a 3\u20130 win over Stoke City.[33] On 18 January, he started in central defence as Arsenal shut out defending champions Manchester City to win 2\u20130 at the City of Manchester Stadium.[34] On 10 February, he scored the opening goal as Arsenal defeated Leicester City 2\u20131.[35] On 30 May 2015, Koscielny was selected to start in the 2015 FA Cup Final, playing the full 90 minutes in a 4\u20130 defeat of Aston Villa at Wembley Stadium.[36]\n\n2015\u201316 season\n\nKoscielny started every game in the first month of the season, excluding a 0\u20130 draw with rivals Liverpool at Emirates Stadium,[37] due to an injury. Koscielny played a vital part as Arsenal won 5 games out of six in October to go second in the Premier League, with Koscielny scoring in successive Premier League wins against Everton and Swansea.[38][39] With manager Arsene Wenger opting to play Gabriel Paulista ahead of vice-captain Per Mertesacker, Koscielny began appearing as captain in February, due to injuries to other captains Santi Cazorla & Mikel Arteta. This ended after a 3\u20132 defeat to Manchester United, when Koscielny missed four games through injury, including a North London derby at White Hart Lane.[40] He returned in a 3\u20131 away defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League, as Arsenal exited the competition at the round of 16 for the sixth season running.[41] Koscielny scored his fourth of the season in a 3\u20133 draw with West Ham.[42]\n\n2016\u201317 season\n\nKoscielny started his first game of the season in a goalless draw against Leicester City.
