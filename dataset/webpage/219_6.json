{"Andy Hurley attended Menomonee Falls High School.": [{"url": "https://onmilwaukee.com/articles/andyhurley", "page_content": "For traveling musicians in the middle of a grueling mega-tour, a hometown engagement can be a like an oasis in the desert; a much-needed break from zealous fans, hotel beds, room service, mini-bars and miniature shampoo bottles.\n\nFall Out Boy drummer Andy Hurley, who grew up in Menomonee Falls and attended the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, isn't looking at his band's gig tonight at the Bradley Center in quite that light.\n\n\"We've only been on tour for a week,\" Hurley, who turns 27 on May 31, said during a phone interview Wednesday afternoon from Minneapolis, where the band played the fifth show of the 2007 Honda Civic Tour.\n\n\"It's kind of not a big deal. Usually, it's nice to come home when you've been gone for awhile. We're just getting started, but it's always good to be home.\"\n\nFor the uninitiated, Fall Out Boy (the name is an homage to superhero Radioactive Man's sidekick on \"The Simpsons\") has sold millions of CDs, appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone (March, 2007), recently appeared on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\" and has a bass player, Pete Wentz, who makes tabloid headlines for dating Ashlee Simpson.\n\n\"It's weird to see yourself on MTV or on a magazine somewhere,\" Hurley said. \"It's an adjustment. But when that happens, I just look at it and say, \u2018I guess we're still out there.' We're not trying to do things in a specific way. We're still trying to push it and take chances.\"\n\nWhat does a member of such a hot band do during his brief period of free time in his home city? Hurley, who is in the process of selling one house and buying another, will prepare for his move and relax.\n\n\"I'll probably go to my mom's house and watch 'Heroes' and 'Lost' and 'Entourage,'\" said Hurley, a vegan who spends much of his time in town on the East Side. \"Usually, I can hang out in Milwaukee and it's not that big of a deal. I like that.\"\n\nRelaxation time is about to get scarce for Fall Out Boy. Backed by +44, The Academy Is..., Paul Wall and Cobra Starship, the band will crisscross the U.S. through early July, with stops in Japan and UK the following month. As he looks at the ambitious schedule, Hurley feels excitement, not dread.\n\n\"I'm stoked,\" Hurley said. \"The first four shows have been amazing, and they're getting bigger.\"\n\nHurley is excited about playing the Bradley Center. \"I'm a sports fan and that's where the Bucks play,\" he said. In the crowd tonight, he'll host his mom and roughly two dozen friends while his bandmates, who hail from the Chicago area, will also have sizable contingents.\n\nUnlike previous tours, ticket requests won't be a major headache.\n\n\"It's old hat now,\" Hurley said. \"Everybody knows how to say 'No.' I let my friend Matt handle it. My mom usually brings five to 10 people. There are probably only about 20 others.\"\n\nThe audience at Fall Out Boy shows is dominated by teenagers, and several in the house tonight will likely come from Menomonee Falls High School. While a student a decade ago in \"The Falls,\" Hurley honed his music skills and, to hear one former teacher tell it, fit the profile of a budding future rock star.\n\nJames Kuse, an English teacher at the school, remembers running into Hurley, literally, during the drummer's freshman year.\n\n\"Back then he was this little red-headed dynamo, full of energy and a lot of sass,\" Kuse said. \"Even then it was easy to tell he was trying to figure out what he wanted to be by the way he was always trying out different personas.\"\n\nHurley, who was five when his father died, went through a rebellious phase, which is hardly uncommon. What was unusual, though, is how he came out of it.\n\n\"The rambunctious goof eventually became a pretty quiet and introspective kid, focused mostly on his music and a straight-edge lifestyle,\" Kuse said. \"His circle of friends was pretty small, mostly just other kids who thought like he did and who also played music, mostly hard-core and punk type stuff.\n\n\"I still remember the band director at the time (Don Huenfeld), who has since retired, commenting on the fact that Andy was phenomenally talented and probably the best drummer he'd ever seen.\"\n\nInformed of the last comment, Hurley was thunderstruck.\n\n\"That's amazing,\" he said. \"(Huenfeld) was a love-hate relationship. He was very strict and hard on everyone. It was probably like a strict coach, like (Packers head coach Vince) Lombardi. We'd argue a lot. After four years, I realized it was to get us to reach our potential.\n\n\"When you're young, you think that all the teachers are against you. I definitely didn't care about school. I mean, I loved being there. I loved being with my friends. But, I didn't really care about what was taught there.\n\n\"I was lucky to have a lot of great teachers. Mr. Kuse was a great teacher and he's a big reason I turned into who I am. There were other teachers and even the principal (Richard Woosencraft) who would kind of try to find ways to tailor things to me. They were always bummed that I wasn't doing the work, but they would try to figure out things I could do to pass.\"\n\nKuse described Hurley as a \"so-so\" student who, though bright, seemed bored by what was being taught in class.\n\n\"He was the kid who'd stay after class to discuss something he was reading, not what the class was reading, but something much more philosophical or socially relevant,\" Kuse said. \"And that's still the way he is today.\n\n\"Though I haven't seen him in about a year now, I'd still run into Andy every now and then, more often than not when I was working part-time at a local bookstore.\n\n\"I'd ask how things were going and how he was handling all the attention, as it's really not his style to be out in the spotlight. And while he'd get excited about some of the things that had happened, wondering if I'd seen them on this show or that, or on the cover of a particular magazine, more than anything else he'd want to know if I had any good books to recommend.\"\n\nWhen he's not working out or listening to hardcore from Manowar on his iPod, Hurley, who studied history and anthropology at UWM, voraciously devours comic books (a personal passion) and non-fiction works by John Zerzan and Derrick Jensen, who question modern civilization and its values while arguing that the industrial economy is harmful to the environment and human interaction.\n\nReading books like Jensen's \"Endgame,\" which aren't exactly considered \"summer beach reading,\" could lead one to question the rock star lifestyle. While Hurley thinks that the record industry is \"in shambles\" and the role of record labels needs to be redefined, he tries to ignore the \"business\" part of the music business.\n\n\"I don't care about the business part of it,\" Hurley said. \"Pete (Wentz) is a brilliant business man. He's got a lot of ideas and I think that helps us a lot as a band.\"\n\nFrom a business standpoint, Fall Out Boy couldn't be doing much better. (Even Wentz's embarrassing experience with some nude photos on the Web turned out to be a good marketing tool). Ticket sales have been brisk. Kids are screaming at shows and downloading songs. There are enough interviews, photo ops, meet-and-greets and celebrity girlfriends to keep everyone occupied.\n\nOn an elevated drum riser in the center of the storm sits a quiet, red-haired young man from Menomonee Falls who projects a calm presence even as he pounds away on his drums, unimpressed and seemingly not tempted by the accoutrements and excesses of fame.\n\n\"This is my job,\" Hurley said. \"As long as I'm writing songs and playing music, that's what is important.\""}, {"url": "https://archive.jsonline.com/entertainment/musicandnightlife/for-fall-out-boy-drummer-andy-hurley-milwaukee-has-always-been-home-b99534934z1-313529221.html/", "page_content": "Andy Hurley (second from left) with Fall Out Boy bandmates Joe Trohman (left), Pete Wentz (second from right) and Patrick Sump (right) before an appearance on the \u201cToday\u201d show in June. Credit: Stephen Lovekin\n\nBy of the\n\nIn 1991, Andy Hurley, then a sixth-grade student at Menomonee Falls North Middle School, had an assignment: Write about your future.\n\nHis first sentence: \"I think I will be in a band 25 years from now.\"\n\nHurley, 35, is indeed playing in a band for a living. Actually, he's in one of the most popular rock bands in the world, Fall Out Boy.\n\nAs the drummer, he's less well-known than frontman Patrick Stump, bassist and onetime tabloid magnet Pete Wentz, and lead guitarist Joe Trohman. But Hurley is arguably the most fascinating member of Fall Out Boy: a softspoken, easygoing, hyper-intelligent, tattoo-covered, cross-fit-obsessed, straightedge vegan who loves his friends so much, he lets them live at his home, rent-free.\n\nWhile his bandmates moved to California long ago, Hurley's home has been in Milwaukee \u2014 a nearly 6,000-square-foot, five-bedroom, million-dollar-plus home on North Lake Drive. The house, the city \u2014 they provided him with much-needed retreat at the end of every grueling tour.\n\nThe journey has had its struggles, both professionally and personally.\n\nHurley's father, a physician, died when he was 5. And when he was 9, his mother, Ann, was diagnosed with breast cancer. He thought he would lose her, too.\n\nHe didn't. Ann today lives in Franklin with her husband of two years; Andy was her man of honor at the wedding. There's a room in her home that includes a shrine to her son, from band posters to an action figure to a platinum record framed on the wall.\n\nHer son, she said, \"as a child, was angry....He was ending up with the wrong kinds of kids...I feel that music saved his life.\"\n\n'First thing I didn't give up'\n\nIn middle school, Andy Hurley started playing percussion. In a fake obituary he wrote for school, he hoped he'd be remembered for playing 1,000 drum sets, signing 100 million autographs and for his 100 world tours. He got into groups like Nirvana and Slayer and Black Sabbath. He kept detailed logs of all the different drumsticks he used.\n\n\"Music is the first thing I didn't give up,\" Hurley said, in part because of a series of band and percussion teachers \"who pushed me further than I would have on my own.\"\n\nWhen he was 15, Hurley immersed himself in the hard-core punk scene in Milwaukee, and when that wasn't enough, he would travel to Chicago to play or hang out with similar bands. That was when he was inspired to become straightedge \u2014 meaning he wouldn't take drugs or drink alcohol \u2014 and a vegan.\n\nHe played drums in radical bands like Racetraitor and Killtheslavemaster, with Wentz as an occasional bandmate. Then, \"when we were all burned out on doing such serious political bands,\" Hurley said, Wentz and Trohman established Fall Out Boy.\n\n\"It definitely took a lot of coaxing\" to get Hurley in the band, Trohman recalled. But after the band had gone through two other drummers, he became part of Fall Out Boy just in time to record the band's debut album, \"Take This To Your Grave,\" in 2003 at Smart Studios in Madison.\n\n\"He started making the band musically very tight. He elevated our level of musicianship,\" Trohman said. \"He takes everything he does very seriously. It helps that he doesn't do drugs, he doesn't drink alcohol. His dedication to the band made everyone want to do the band more in the beginning.\"\n\nFrom touring in a rundown van to becoming famous, Hurley in many ways has been the band's rock.\n\n\"Pete and Patrick and I, we all love each other, but we've always hated each other at some point for various reasons,\" Trohman said. \"With Andy, I don't think anyone has anything disparaging to say.\"\n\nToday, Fall Out Boy is riding the success of six albums, three of which have reached the top of the Billboard charts. The band has won a host of awards, including a People's Choice for Favorite Alternative Band, although a Grammy is still on Hurley's wish list. Its most recent work, \"American Beauty/American Psycho,\" released in January of this year, sold more than 218,000 equivalent copies in the first week alone.\n\n\"I would love to keep doing it forever,\" Hurley said. \"If we did end tomorrow, I would be so stoked and proud of everything I've done and how I lived my life. I feel like I've had enough experiences for multiple lives.\"\n\nA pact with friends\n\nThat's certainly true of Matthew Mixon, a video producer and Hurley's roommate. He hasn't paid rent at Hurley's Milwaukee home since 2007.\n\nWhen Mixon and Hurley were freshmen at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, \"we were eating Thai food after class, talking about money our bands could make, dreaming big. And somebody said, 'Whoever gets big off this (expletive) has to buy a house that we can all live in and play music.\"\n\nHurley honored the pact \u2014 and more.\n\n\"He took me to the MTV Video Music Awards,\" Mixon said. \"He always picks up the check....And (his friends) have had these once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to experience all these things with him.\"\n\nIn return, Hurley's roommates take care of the house and make sure the bills are paid on time, Trohman said. \"For Andy, friends are his family.\"\n\nWhen he's off the road, Hurley spends time with his roommates \"24/7,\" Mixon said. \"We do the same stuff we did in high school. We play video games and board games all the time, and we love hanging around with each other. ... He's the same dude through and through.\"\n\nHurley appreciates the circle of local support.\n\n\"It grounds me, and has kept me out of this world that does affect people,\" Hurley said as he sipped coffee at one of his favorite places in town, Alderaan Coffee on N. Water St.\n\nThis summer, Fall Out Boy is co-headlining amphitheaters across the country with rapper Wiz Khalifa for the \"Boys of Zummer\" tour. Milwaukee isn't on the route \u2014 The Rave hosted the band just last December \u2014 but the band will be at the First Midwest Bank Amphitheatre in Tinley Park, Ill., Saturday.\n\nHurley is eager to play in Milwaukee again. \"Playing there has always been my best shows,\" he said. \"My mom is there with all of her friends. I usually have 30 to 40 people on the guest list. It's infinitely more stressful. But I rise to the stress and I play better because of it.\"\n\nHis mother is fascinated to see how he handles his status.\n\n\"He is such a good kid,\" she said. \"He is very caring and he is always interested in seeing me when he's home. He'll take us behind the scenes after the shows in Milwaukee and Chicago. So many people want to talk to him. It's just astounding to me to watch him interact with others. There isn't any of this highfalutin stuff. He just doesn't have it in him.\"\n\nFinding a new home\n\nAfter this tour is done, for the first time Hurley will not be coming back to Milwaukee. He has a brand-new residence in Portland, Ore. It's on 48 acres, with a pool and a private beach.\n\nThe winters here are rough, he said, and the frequent commute to Los Angeles has been hard.\n\n\"I'm going to be devastated when he leaves,\" his mother said. \"I know he has his own life, and he keeps saying I'm going to come back a lot and fly you out here.\"\n\nHe's already sold his Lake Drive house. But his Milwaukee friends and roommates \u2014 seven of them \u2014 will be waiting in Portland. They're all moving with him. And Hurley hopes he'll have a couple of months off toward the end of the year to hang out with them.\n\n\"Portland is only a two-hour flight from Los Angeles. It's really similar (to Milwaukee) where it's kind of this big, small place and has a really amazing community, and it's bigger in terms of veganism,\" Hurley said. \"But I've always felt like Milwaukee was a member of the family.\"\n\n\"My heart will always be here.\"\n\nMore on music\n\nFind out about the week's must-see shows, concert tickets and more in the new newsletter \"Piet Levy's Music Picks.\" Subscribe at jsonline.com/newsletters.\n\nPiet talks about concerts, local music and more on \"TAP'd In\" with Jordan Lee, 8 a.m. Thursdays on WYMS-FM (88.9).\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWho: Fall Out Boy and Wiz Khalifa\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. Saturday\n\nWhere: First Midwest Bank Amphitheatre; 19100 South Ridgeland Ave.; Tinley Park, Ill.\n\nHow much?$20 to $62.75 at the box office and livenation.com."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/andy-hurley", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nAndy Hurley was born on 31 May, 1980 in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, United States, is an American musician.

What with touring, studio recording and the other travelling necessities of a life in the music business, a rock star doesn\u2019t get to spend too much time at home with his trophies and golden records, so it\u2019s nice to have an uncluttered place without a lot of nooks and crannies that you have to dust every time you get back home.\n\nThus, Hurley went with the smooth and simple lines of Wisconsin-born Prairie School architecture in this gem of a home that was started in 2002 and completed in 2006 by developer Carl Kemp.\n\nHurley paid $1,825,000 for the 5,746 square foot split-level home, with a full 2,659 square foot basement, on the shores of Lake Michigan in 2007 and has lived there since, when not stuck in a studio or a hotel room somewhere on tour.\n\nThe five bedroom, 4-\u00bd bath home has everything a single, peripatetic, vegan troubadour could hope for, including views of the lake, a music room down in the basement, places for his buddies to crash, a ping-pong table \u2014 and, more importantly, \u2014 a pool table and lots and lots of comic books. It\u2019s a fantasy world tempered by the austere minimalism of the homegrown Prairie School lines.\n\nDue to his travel schedule, the owner is excused from having a vegetable garden from which bounty he might eat off the land, but he could maybe forage for acorns and walnuts along the bluffs. Certainly the wild raspberries were ripe when he was in town for the Summerfest gig.\n\nAs a contemporary tribute to the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, Russell Barr Williamson and other original practitioners of the Prairie style, this one stands out from the pack of other recent, and mostly suburban attempts to mimic the art. True, the 25 foot by 25 foot attached garage dominates the street facade of the building, but what can you expect along the lake, where lots are narrow and deep?\n\nStill, you can get enough view from the street of the restrained modernity of the structure to place it among the more admirable of the recent spate of lakefront teardowns and re-builds.\n\nWhite horizontal stone banding relieves the beige Roman brick exterior, while the low-slung red roof with its wide eaves adds to the harmony of the whole.\n\nThe site provides one distinct advantage \u2014 the home is built into the bluff, all the better to keep the racket down from that noisy drummer in the music room down there. A large deck affords fine views of the lake from two levels. Stone pillars and a period-appropriate iron fence keep the home at bay from passersby and set it off from the busy street.\n\nRegrettably, the name of the architect was not immediately available at the time of this writing. However, Kemp, the developer, was associated with Khamit Development Co., which also brought us the residence of City Treasurer Spencer Coggs, another House Confidential honoree, and one hardly destined for MTV Cribs.\n\nThe city assesses the Hurley House at $233,200 for the land, or about $5 per square foot. The improvements are valued at $1,189,600, for a total of $1,422,800. Taxes are $43,479 and are paid in full.\n\nHomes on the east side of N. Lake Drive, which had been substantially built up by the first decades of the 20th century, are getting newer and newer. The one to the south of Hurley, owned by realtor and musician Bill Bonifas, is newer still. Several others are in various stages of completion along the road. The phenomenon continues north through Shorewood (just a block away), Whitefish Bay, Fox Point and Bayside. It just gets worse in Mequon and points beyond. But this is a fine addition to the city\u2019s urban fabric, where certain design restraints are still maintained.\n\nThe Rundown\n\nLocation: City of Milwaukee\n\nNeighborhood: Downer Woods\n\nSubdivision: Certified Survey Map #4705, recorded 1986.

Ever since he was a kid, he followed the belief that humans are supposed to live the way they used to live thousands of years ago, in their primitive state, but as he grew up, most of his beliefs faded.\n\nAndy Hurley was born Andrew John Hurley in Wisconsin on 31st May 1980 and lost his father when he was just 5. His mother took care of him for the rest of his childhood and teenage. Andy had saxophone as his very first musical instrument that he learned playing well and along with that, he also played percussion in his school\u2019s marching band.\n\nRecommended Lists:\n\nCareer\n\nAndy\u2019s introduction to professional music happened back when he was in the high school and was slowly gaining interest in playing drums. The year was 1996 and Andy was searching for opportunities to play with some big bands and in the pursuit of his dreams, he became part of several hardcore punk and heavy metal bands such as Killtheslavemaster, Racetraitor, Project Rocket and The Kill Pill. He was unable to find his true calling and kept trying different bands during this time.\n\nThe hardcore metal was getting popular in the late 90s and Andy\u2019s drumming skills got him gigs here and there but nothing concrete was coming across his way. However, things changed for the best in the year 2003, when one of his best high school friends Pete Wentz invited Andy to be a part of their band which was called the Fall Out Boy as they were in dire need of an additional drummer due to some troubles with their previous one, and it didn\u2019t take Andy much time to become a regular with Fall Out Boy.\n\nHis association with the band was extremely successful and despite the fact that this was the fourth band Andy was in, he got the fame in such a short time which he wasn\u2019t able to achieve through his previous stints in more than 5 years. Andy recorded the album \u2018Take This To Your Grave\u2019 with the band Fall Out Boy in 2003 to a mega universal success which helped Andy to become one of the hottest drummers around.\n\nIt was the first album by the band which was considered to be an actual hit and the band was reported by the media outlets to be the next big thing. The success continued with their next album titled \u2018From Under the Cork Tree\u2019, which climbed at the 9th spot in the Billboard 200 chart and the band spent the year 2005 touring around with their new found success. The album later went on to earn a Grammy nomination for the best New Artist.\n\nThe next two studio albums by the band titled \u2018Infinity on High\u2019 and \u2018Folie a Deux\u2019 also went on to achieve mega success in their concerts and digital downloads. However, Wentz faced severe emotional trouble during that time which also included a failed suicide attempt. It was being said that he is unable to handle the new found success the band was having and that, among several other things, led the band to take a break for some time in 2009.\n\nAndy got himself busy with several other projects and played for different bands such as a heavy metal band The Damned Things. The band was mostly a collaborative effort and featured members from Fall Out Boy, Anthrax and Every Time I Die and released their very first album titled \u2018Ironiclast\u2019. Enabler, another hard core band, hired Andy and in summer 2012, Enabler released their first album with Andy as a drummer titled \u2018All Hail the Void\u2019.\n\nLater in 2012, Andy joined a straight edge hard rock band named FocusedXminds, and during that time, media speculations were ripe about Fall Out Boy making a comeback and it was said that Andy will leave FocusedXminds when that happens. Fall Out Boy made a reappearance onto the musical sky in 2013, but Andy continued his association with FocusedXminds."}, {"url": "https://www.musicradar.com/news/fall-out-boys-andy-hurley-for-a-long-time-i-had-doubts-that-i-could-play-drums-anymore", "page_content": "Fall Out Boy first emerged from the early 2000s hardcore punk scene in Chicago.\n\nThe band - formed by bassist Pete Wentz, guitarist Joe Trohman and guitarist/singer Patrick Stump - stood head and shoulders above the competition with their extraordinary melodies, gigantic hooks and Stump\u2019s incredible vocal.\n\nPeople really started to take note with the release of debut album Take This To Your Grave in 2003, the first Fall Out Boy music to feature straight-edge, heavy metal-loving Andy Hurley on drums. The album was a pop-punk masterpiece that established Hurley as a force to be reckoned with behind the kit - equal parts Travis Barker and Dave Lombardo.\n\nThe band went on to achieve monumental success with follow-up album From Under The Cork Tree, which spawned mega hit Sugar We\u2019re Goin Down, followed by Infinity On High and Folie \u00e0 Deux. While shy guy Andy wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the ever-increasing limelight, he let his memorable drum parts do the talking. By 2010 Fall Out Boy were burned out and a three-year hiatus was quickly announced.\n\nAndy fed his passion for heavy metal and hardcore punk, recording and touring with bands including Enabler and Earth Crisis, and forming heavy rock band The Damned Things with Trohman. Andy still uses downtime from Fall Out Boy to play with hardcore band, Sect. Fall Out Boy returned refreshed and fighting fit in 2012, releasing three chart-topping albums in a row, culminating in this year\u2019s Mania.\n\nWhile the band\u2019s sound has evolved through the years, their core DNA remains, and Fall Out Boy continue to sell out arenas around the world. We hooked up with Andy Hurley during the recent UK tour to learn more about the band\u2019s incredible journey.\n\nYou joined Fall Out Boy around 2003. What were the circumstances surrounding that?\n\n\u201cI was in hardcore bands with Pete [Wentz] for years. At the time I was going to college and playing in three bands. That\u2019s why they didn\u2019t ask me to join when they first started, but they needed someone to fill in for a tour and then they were recording some demos.\n\n\"The guy producing it, Sean O\u2019Keefe who also produced Take This To Your Grave, asked if I could play on them. I loved the music they were making. The music being written for the demos, which became Take This To Your Grave, was the best stuff I had ever been a part of.\u201d\n\nHow would you describe your drumming at the time?\n\n\u201cI think I reached my peak back then and I\u2019ve been coasting on that for 15 years! Not really. I think that\u2019s probably when I started coming into my own as a drummer, being in bands and figuring out how to play with a band. Joining Fall Out Boy was the best education for that.\u201d\n\nDid you have much recording experience before Take This To Your Grave?\n\n\u201cI\u2019d recorded with a few projects, but never anything like that. We recorded a lot of it in Madison, at Butch Vig\u2019s studio [Smart Studios]. It was the biggest studio and the biggest thing we\u2019d done. There was a microphone that Kurt Cobain used in that studio! Everything I\u2019d done [before that] was with friends, or in much smaller studios.\u201d\n\nWhat did you learn from the experience?\n\n\u201cConfidence. For a long time, even on From Under The Cork Tree and Infinity On High, I had doubts that I could play anymore. From Under The Cork Tree was the first major label record we did, so that was an even bigger thing than Take This To Your Grave. I guess Take This To Your Grave was the beginning of finding comfort - of knowing what I\u2019m doing and not over thinking it.\u201d\n\nFrom collaborating so much I\u2019m better at hearing what the core DNA rhythm is in a song\n\nBetween Take This To Your Grave and Mania, Fall Out Boy\u2019s sound has evolved. Would you say your drumming has developed in tandem with that?\n\n\u201cMaybe a little. After the hiatus there was a bigger tweak. I think it follows with being in a band with songwriters who have specific ideas. Both Joe [Trohman] and Patrick [Stump] have certain things they want accented on the drums, so every aspect of every song is a collaborative thing.\n\n\"I might have an idea for a kick pattern and it totally goes against the vocal pattern. I think the evolution is just being more subservient to what the song requires. On Mania, it\u2019s the most real drums you\u2019ll hear on songs in the modern Fall Out Boy era. On the last couple of records there\u2019s drums for the whole thing, but a lot of times they\u2019re mixed with drum loops or cut up.\u201d\n\nFrom Under The Cork Tree and Infinity On High are the band\u2019s biggest-selling albums. What do you remember about the writing and recording and did you have an inkling they were going to be hits?\n\n\u201cI think we knew that we\u2019d written some great songs and a great album, but I don\u2019t think we had any idea it would be as big as it was. I think it was just a belief that this is the best work we\u2019ve done to this point. You can rally behind that.\n\n\u201cThere was a moment in the recording of Sugar We\u2019re Goin Down where Patrick did a take of a harmony or something and there was just a look when he came into the booth where we were like, \u2018This is a hit!\u2019 He\u2019s got an amazing voice and I think that is a big reason for our success. He\u2019s just so talented. Obviously, that\u2019s all bluster and jokes in the studio; you have no idea if anyone will care.\u201d\n\nDid those two albums come together fairly easily?\n\n\u201cCork Tree... and Infinity... took work. Sugar\u2026 went through a lot of different iterations before it became the song that it was. The original verse I remember I hated. The idea for what the verse became happened last minute, right before recording. That saved it for me.\n\n\"There was a lot of stuff that we had to hash out in the rehearsal space for both albums. I don\u2019t really hear the songs until I\u2019m in the studio now. It\u2019s become much more on the fly, which I really love. I think different ideas come to me more than if I had the time to do what I\u2019d normally feel like doing. It\u2019s more instinctive.\u201d\n\nThe drum parts are a key element of Fall Out Boy\u2019s sound. How much input comes from the other guys?\n\n\u201cPatrick is a drummer and so he\u2019s big on specific rhythms and patterns. And Joe, with The Damned Things stuff - there were a lot of specific things he wanted. Other bands I\u2019ve played in recently have had people who were either drummers or really adept at writing drum parts in their demoing.\n\n\"I really like when there\u2019s a specific thing that someone wants to hear. I think that from collaborating so much I\u2019m better at hearing what the core DNA rhythm is in a song to begin with.\u201d\n\nDo you remember a point at which things were getting noticeably bigger for Fall Out Boy?\n\n\u201cI guess it was the Warped Tour in 2005, the year From Under The Cork Tree came out. That was us and My Chem. It was the year where it was getting pretty crazy. Even the year before, we had a show on some really small stage, I think it was in Detroit, and the crowd was too big and they knocked the fence down.\n\n\"There were a few shows like that here and there, but that year of Warped Tour was where every show felt like that.\u201d\n\nThen things went stratospheric! You seem a fairly private guy. How comfortable did you feel with the limelight?\n\n\u201cIt was something you get used to. I definitely don\u2019t like photoshoots, but I\u2019m pretty comfortable with it now. For stuff like [drum magazines] it\u2019s just me, but with the full band it\u2019s a little easier because I can be the fourth person in the group and don\u2019t necessarily have to carry it. That\u2019s usually Pete. He\u2019s really photogenic and good at that stuff.\u201d\n\nThe size of gigs changed dramatically too...\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing Sect shows during any off-time from Fall Out Boy. The weekend before we came out here I was in the midwest for three shows. We played a VFW [Veterans of Foreigh Wars] hall, a basement and a small club.\n\n\"To be honest, that actually makes me more nervous than playing an arena. I\u2019m used to [big shows]. I can\u2019t focus on any one person. A basement show, where there\u2019s going to be at most 50 people, I can see everyone and any mistakes are bigger because I\u2019m right in front of them.\n\n\"I\u2019m more comfortable because I feel more plugged into something at a smaller show, but I also feel like I have to play better. Actually, I don\u2019t have to worry about a lot of stuff at a show this size, whereas I worry a lot about the Sect shows because I have to make sure I have a kit, bring a snare and cymbals. I\u2019ll confess, I\u2019ve forgotten sticks once before! That\u2019s all coming from a situation where I don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d\n\nWhich drum parts would you say define your playing in Fall Out Boy?\n\n\u201cTake This To Your Grave is the one where I was trying to emulate Travis Barker and guys like that the most. I was playing more beats that go around the kit.\n\n\"I think there\u2019s stuff on Mania in terms of fills or just a stripped-down beat that I\u2019m most proud of. Last year my big inspiration in terms of drumming was Danzig\u2019s Chuck Biscuits. I think he\u2019s just one of the best drummers because he\u2019s so hard hitting. He\u2019s playing exactly what\u2019s needed.\n\n\"His fills, while simple, are better than a fill I would choose to do. I was a Dave Lombardo-influenced drummer growing up, so I tried to call Chuck\u2019s spirit into my playing more on Mania.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve played on plenty of hardcore and metal albums too. What do you consider to be your drumming highlights outside of Fall Out Boy?\n\n\u201cI think the Enabler record has a lot of stuff I\u2019m really proud of. Sect is probably the highlight of my musical career. The last record we did, which came out last year, is called No Cure For Death. Stylistically, what\u2019s being played is really fun, it\u2019s fast and fill-y and double bass-y and blast beat-y. But it\u2019s also about the people in it.\n\n\"There\u2019s a guy from Earth Crisis, who were one of my favourite bands growing up. The singer was in Cursed, which is my favourite hardcore band. They\u2019re also a vegan straight-edge band, which is important to me.\u201d\n\nFall Out Boy took a break between 2010 and 2012, during which time you stayed busy with a number of different music projects. Was it important to do things that were completely removed from FoB?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the impetus was that it needed be different, I think it was just about doing stuff. The hiatus was really difficult because you become so institutionalised to having a schedule laid out for a year and a half to two years. When you don\u2019t have anything, at that time it was really difficult for me. It was depressing.\n\n\"You spend all this time on tour being like, \u2018I just wish I was home and had nothing to do.\u2019 Then you have nothing to do for two weeks and you\u2019re like, \u2018I have no idea what to do with my life.\u2019\n\n\u201cA lot of cool opportunities came. That\u2019s where I met Earth Crisis through a mutual friend who was managing them and I filled in on a tour. Then I did the Enabler record and some tours with that. The Damned Things was the big one. That was awesome. I think that more just speaks to the fact that heavy metal and hardcore is the kind of music I grew up with.\u201d\n\nDid you take time to work on your playing during that period?\n\n\u201cNo. I met Tomas Haake from Meshuggah and asked him what he does to warm up or practise at home. He said, \u2018Nothing\u2019. When he\u2019s off he goes fishing. He doesn\u2019t touch drums. That\u2019s the case for me.\n\n\"On the hiatus I was playing a lot more with friends\u2019 bands and staying busy with that. Tomas said that he got to a place where he could play what he wants to play and then coasted, I guess.\n\n\"I can play all the kinds of music I want to play and that\u2019s what I love about music. I\u2019ve never been a dude who\u2019s practising every day to play crazier stuff.\n\n\u201cMy drum tech, Brandon, plays in this band Misery Signals. He\u2019s the best drummer I know. He\u2019s so technically proficient. He practises every day for two hours. He\u2019s always pushing himself to be better. I\u2019ve just never had that drive. But that\u2019s not to say that when there\u2019s something I want to play in a band and I\u2019m not able to nail it I won\u2019t practise and really work on things.\u201d\n\nDid you return to Fall Out Boy with renewed vigour?\n\n\u201cTotally. We couldn\u2019t come back putting out the same records and we wouldn\u2019t want to. That challenge to evolve with the times is fun and it keeps things interesting. I definitely think the break cleared my palette so I could plug in to the new form that Fall Out Boy existed in easier than if I wasn\u2019t doing these projects that let me loose.\n\n\u201cOn the Sect and Enabler records I\u2019d do takes of just fills - just filling through a whole song and figuring out what works best. It\u2019s interesting because coming back from hiatus, that\u2019s what I did for Fall Out Boy. I\u2019d do takes of just the beat that\u2019s going to be mixed with a loop or whatever and then we\u2019d do takes of fills, just to see if something comes out of it.\u201d\n\nA lot of bands that came up at the same time as Fall Out Boy are no longer about. You guys are still releasing Number 1 albums and selling out big venues. What do you think it is that keeps people coming back for more?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really thankful for the opportunity and the fact that people still care. I don\u2019t really fully understand why. We try to evolve and push our boundaries, because we want to and because it\u2019s a challenge to us to do something different every time while maintaining the DNA that makes us who we are. Maybe that\u2019s something that speaks to people, the fact that we\u2019re still inspired to make music that we love.\u201d\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t joined Fall Out Boy, what would you be doing today?\n\n\u201cI just watched an interview with [Star Wars actor] John Boyega on Desus and Mero\u2019s podcast. It\u2019s called Bodega Boys. They just talk about pop culture stuff. They asked John Boyega what he\u2019d be doing if he wasn\u2019t acting and he said, \u2018This is what I\u2019d be doing\u2019. This was his one option, there was no plan B. I feel the same way. If I\u2019m not doing this I\u2019ll be dead. If I wasn\u2019t in this band I\u2019d be in another band, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://pantheon.world/profile/person/Andy_Hurley/", "page_content": "Andy Hurley\n\nAndrew John Hurley (born May 31, 1980) is an American musician.

The year was 1996 and Andy was searching for opportunities to play with some big bands and in the pursuit of his dreams, he became part of several hardcore punk and heavy metal bands such as Killtheslavemaster, Racetraitor, Project Rocket and The Kill Pill.

The hardcore metal was getting popular in the late 90s and Andy\u2019s drumming skills got him gigs here and there but nothing concrete was coming across his way. However, things changed for the best in the year 2003, when one of his best high school friends Pete Wentz invited Andy to be a part of their band which was called the Fall Out Boy as they were in dire need of an additional drummer due to some troubles with their previous one, and it didn\u2019t take Andy much time to become a regular with Fall Out Boy.
