{"In 2010, Andy Hurley founded the heavy metal supergroup The Damned": [{"url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/how-fall-out-boy-beat-the-odds-and-rose-again-233869/", "page_content": "When Fall Out Boy announced their reunion earlier this year, they had serious doubts whether anyone would really care. The emo movement is long over, their young fans have grown up and their solo careers were largely dead on arrival. Despite all that, the band is experiencing a rather stunning renaissance. Their single \u201cMy Songs Know What You Did In The Dark\u201d has been sitting comfortably in the Top 30 of the Hot 100 for more than two months, earning lots of radio airplay and even a nod from Taylor Swift, who tweeted that she\u2019d listened to the song 43 times in a single day. Concert tickets are selling like crazy, and they\u2019re even moving back to arenas.\n\nFall Out Boy\u2019s new album, Save Rock and Roll \u2013 featuring guest appearances by Elton John, Courtney Love and Big Sean \u2013 hit stores on Tuesday and is the second best-selling album in the iTunes music store. \u201cThe world moves so fast that we didn\u2019t know if people would care,\u201d says Pete Wentz. \u201cSo to have people care now and show interest . . . that\u2019s the great part. It proves to us that this band did mean something.\u201d\n\nFour years ago, the band had serious doubts about that. They felt incredibly uncool and unappreciated, not that much different than a hair metal band struggling to survive in the grunge era. It was a little like being M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce in 1991. Fall Out Boy\u2019s 2008 LP, Folie \u00e0 Deux, failed to connect, and band relations were at an all-time low when they hit the road to promote it. \u201cIt felt like an out-of-body experience,\u201d says guitarist Joe Trohman. \u201cSome of us were miserable onstage. Some of us were just drunk. The fans were just trudging through the new songs. They didn\u2019t want to hear them.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\nFolie \u00e0 Deux was intended to be a commentary about the narcissism of American culture, but frontman Patrick Stump feels it didn\u2019t quite work. \u201cI think a lot of that last record cycle was my fault,\u201d he says. \u201cI had an actual dream about what the record should sound like. I tried to make that happen, but nobody was with me. I was trying to push my agenda, and that was a weird thing to do.\u201d\n\nPete Wentz on His \u2018Brutal\u2019 First Tattoo and Hosting \u2018Best Ink\u2019\n\nIt was also a very difficult time for Wentz, the bassist and lyricist. \u201cMy personal life was whatever at the time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was really rough. I grew a heinous beard and got blackout drunk, smashed my face and cut it open . . . I could feel the backlash against the band. I mean, I was in such a haze of selfishness and pills it was hard to believe I could feel anything.\u201d\n\nWentz was married to Ashlee Simpson at the time, and she had just given birth to their son, Bronx Mowgli. Their photos were constantly in the tabloids. \u201cI was high on being Pete Wentz,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I understand how I was overshadowing the band, especially Patrick. This kid is a fucking genius. He\u2019s probably one of the best melody writers around. In any band that would have been talked about constantly, but I was just overshadowing it. I knew it, but I didn\u2019t know how to stop it. It was a snowball that had just gotten so big.\u201d\n\nAs the tour slogged on, Stump began realizing the band desperately needed a break. \u201cHe sat us down and said, \u2018If we don\u2019t take a break we\u2019re going to break up,'\u201d recalls drummer Andy Hurley. \u201cHe also said, \u2018We\u2019ll hate each other and never want to do this again.\u2019 The thing is, I didn\u2019t want to stop.\u201d\n\nWentz was also very resistant to the idea of a hiatus, but Stump knew it had to be done. \u201cSeven years is a long time to never have a weekend,\u201d he says. \u201cNot everybody agreed with me. But the pace we were on was like a gyroscope. It\u2019s the speed that holds it together . . . It\u2019s like the whole Yoko Ono myth. She didn\u2019t break up the Beatles. They were already fractured by the time she came around.\u201d\n\n\u201cI withdrew from things,\u201d says Wentz. \u201cThe dynamic of the band had changed. Everyone\u2019s personalities had changed from when we started the band. Patrick didn\u2019t used to be outgoing at all, and then he grew into himself. I don\u2019t know that I gave him room to change. I think that having a kid made me understand myself a lot more. Back then, I didn\u2019t respect people\u2019s time. I would show up to stuff whenever I felt like it. I was a selfish guy that ended up in a position I didn\u2019t even understand. Nobody gave me a rule book or anything.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\nFall Out Boy played their last show at Madison Square Garden on October 4th, 2009. \u201cI was really sad that night,\u201d says Hurley. \u201cI cried a little before we went onstage. I thought to myself, \u2018Maybe this is it.'\u201d They closed out the show with \u201cSaturday,\u201d from their 2003 debut LP Take This to Your Grave. Near the end, Mark Hoppus from Blink-182 shaved Wentz\u2019s head. It was a symbolic cleansing of the past, but also the beginning of a very dark chapter for the band.\n\nComing home from the tour without any Fall Out Boy activity in the foreseeable future was quite sobering. \u201cMy calendar was empty,\u201d says Hurley. \u201cTouring the way the we did and having a schedule like we did institutionalizes you in a way where you don\u2019t know anything else. I think I went through the darkest depression I\u2019ve ever felt in my life. That winter was horrible.\u201d\n\nWentz had a similar experience. \u201cI called my manager and was like, \u2018Do people not email as much?'\u201d he says. \u201cI used to wake up and say, \u2018I can\u2019t stand how many emails I\u2019m getting.\u2019 Then I didn\u2019t get them at all anymore . . . I went through a really, really dark, weak period, and then at the same time I didn\u2019t have an outlet to express myself. Patrick was still my best friend. I was in his wedding. At the same time, I felt like he needed to get some of that Pete Wentz stink off of him.\u201d\n\nThe four members of Fall Out Boy ultimately poured their energies into new musical projects. Andy Hurley and Joe Trohman formed the heavy metal supergroup the Damned Things with members of Anthrax and Every Time I Die. They released a well-received album in 2010, but they never got much traction. Wentz formed the dance music act Black Cards with singer Bebe Rexha. They released an EP and toured a bit, but it too failed to take off in any meaningful way, and Rexha quietly left the group last year.\n\nPatrick Stump put resources into his 2011 solo debut Soul Punk. It earned positive reviews, but many Fall Out Boy fans weren\u2019t willing to follow him in a new direction. He went on a club tour, and even opened dates for former FOB proteges Panic! At the Disco. Nothing seemed to work.\n\n\u201cPeople were calling me a sell-out while I was doing my solo thing,\u201d Stump says. \u201cAnd I was losing lots of money. I was like, \u2018If I were selling out, I hope I could do a little better job at it.\u2019 There are totally valid criticisms to say, like, \u2018I don\u2019t like the record,\u2019 or, \u2018I don\u2019t like the direction you\u2019ve taken. I miss your band.\u2019 Those are totally valid things to say. Things that aren\u2019t valid to say are, \u2018You\u2019re doing this for the money,\u2019 or, \u2018You think you\u2019re Michael Jackson.'\u201d\n\nAs his solo tour went on, Stump\u2019s mood continued to darken. \u201cI was doing this as a labor of love, and I\u2019ve never gotten so much shit in my life,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s weird. I don\u2019t think I was bullied until I was 27. It just blew my mind how cruel people can be. They would pay go to the shows just to heckle me. They\u2019d even yell out, \u2018I liked you better fat!\u2019 I was like, \u2018That has nothing to do with anything. That was for health reasons, jerk.'\u201d\n\nDuring a particularly dark moment in February of 2012, Stump poured his heart out in a long blog entry called \u201cWe Liked You Better Fat: Confessions of a Pariah.\u201d \u201cTouring on Folie was like being the last act at the vaudeville show,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe were rotten vegetable targets in Clandestine hoods.\u201d He went on to reveal that he blew his nest egg on his solo tour. \u201cI still have access to enough money to live on in order to avoid bankruptcy for at least a few years as long as I stick to my budget . . . I guess I\u2019m just angry when I\u2019m a 27-year-old has-been . . . It\u2019s as though I\u2019ve received some big cosmic sign that says I should disappear.\u201d\n\nIt was a shocking display of honesty and raw emotion. It\u2019s no longer on Stump\u2019s site, and he winces slightly when it\u2019s brought up. \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that pull quotes aren\u2019t my strong suit,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not very succinct . . . Also, I was not broke. I just meant I\u2019m going to have to work again in my life. It\u2019s not like we were 1980s-cocaine-superstar rich. People were like, \u2018Boo-hoo, he can go cry in his pile of money. He can go dive into Uncle Scrooge\u2019s money bin.\u2019 Well, I don\u2019t have that.\u201d\n\nRight around the time Stump posted the letter, Wentz reached out to him. \u201cI was like, \u2018Let\u2019s write some songs or something,'\u201d he says. \u201cI was in a dark place and I needed a creative outlet. Patrick is such a nice guy that he wrote the songs with me, but I don\u2019t think his heart was in them. They were kind of \u2018meh.\u2019 I\u2019d equate it to some lost weekend thing that only one fan on the planet would care about. It was kind of a wash.\u201d\n\nUndeterred, they tried again not long afterwards. Eventually they came up with the song \u201cWhere Did the Party Go.\u201d\n\n\u201cPete got really excited, and that got me excited,\u201d says Stump. \u201cIt gave us a ton of momentum. Then we decided it was time to call everybody else.\u201d\n\nThe group reunited at a secret meeting at their manager\u2019s house in New York. \u201cWe had to hammer out the idea that if we were going to do this, it had to be about the future of Fall Out Boy,\u201d says Wentz. \u201cWe weren\u2019t just going to be a legacy band.\u201d\n\nSave Rock and Roll was recorded in Venice, California with producer Butch Walker. Keeping it secret was tough, especially for a group so visible on social media. \u201cI definitely stayed away from Twitter,\u201d says Hurley. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be geotagged or anything.\u201d\n\nFinding a new sound wasn\u2019t as difficult as they feared. \u201cI hear a lot of bands complain as they get older, \u2018Oh, the new generation doesn\u2019t get us,'\u201d says Stump. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Well, you have to stay relevant by making music that\u2019s relevant to people.\u2019 What\u2019s fascinating to me is that you can\u2019t contrive that. You can\u2019t just make the same record that you made forever ago and expect that be something that will resonate with people. But you also can\u2019t go for radio and that kind of thing. You have to find this zen place when you find something that sounds like you, but also new.\u201d\n\nTrending The FDA Warned Ozempic Users.

We\u2019ve never been a band that plays it safe. We could have probably written \u2018Sugar, We\u2019re Going Down\u2019 five times, but we never did.\u201d\n\nNot telling a soul about the reunion until everything was in place was extremely important for the band. \u201cUltimately, we\u2019re fans of Fall Out Boy,\u201d says Wentz. \u201cFrom a fan\u2019s perspective, we thought about how we\u2019d want it to happen. Bam, it\u2019s on the Internet. You get the song, you get the album, you get the show. The delay would have driven me crazy.\u201d\n\nOn the morning of February 4th, they announced everything: the single, the album and the tour. They played a show that night at a tiny club in Chicago. The next night, they hit the basement Studio at Webster Hall in New York. Fans lined up in the freezing cold about 10 hours before showtime, many clutching handmade signs. It felt like a time warp back to 2006, and when the group took the stage and launched into \u201cThriller,\u201d the squeals were deafening.\n\nFall Out Boy have nearly 60 dates on the books right now, and in the fall they are headlining arenas in the States. The band claim they had little idea people would care this much.\n\n\u201cWe never really cared about that, though,\u201d says Stump. \u201cIt\u2019s always been the four of us against the world. When we left, it felt like the world kind of won. It was disheartening, but the irony is I was just reading a review of a recent show. Someone said, \u2018Wow, that was really great, but they should really play more songs from Folie \u00e0 Deux.'\u201d"}, {"url": "https://music.mxdwn.com/2016/12/12/news/the-damned-things-featuring-andy-hurley-of-fall-out-boy-and-scott-ian-of-anthrax-have-recorded-a-new-ep/", "page_content": "Home News Matt Matasci December 12th, 2016 - 10:54 PM\n\nIt has been a while since the eclectic rock supergroup The Damned Things have been active. It would be completely natural to presume the group would have died out with the release of just one full-length release, Ironiclast. The lineup featured busy artists like guitarist Scott Ian of Anthrax, drummer Andy Hurley and guitarist Joe Trohman of Fall Out Boy, vocalist Keith Buckley and bassist Josh Newton of Every Time I Die and guitarist Rob Caggiano of Volbeat (and for a minute, Anthrax).\n\nHowever, Hurley revealed on the 100 Words or Less podcast (which is hosted by Ray Harkins, lead singer of Southern California hardcore band Taken), that he has recorded a five-song EP with the band. At 1:13:25 he discusses The Damned Things.\n\nDespite the fact that there could be a pending release from this impressive and diverse range of metal, hardcore and punk superstars, it does not seem like a tour is in the works. Hurley said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be playing, Anthrax is still touring on their last record. ETID just put out their new record, uh, who else? Josh Newton I think has been playing lately\u2026So you know, that\u2019s all over the place.\u201d\n\nAs all-star lineups like the one The Damned Things sports can have a bit of a transient nature, there is no indication if all of the members from Ironiclast were involved in the new recording sessions.\n\nEvery Time I Die recently released their eighth album Low Teens and are embarking on a Spring 2017 tour in support of the Epitaph Records-released effort.\n\nAnthrax has also had a busy 2016, releasing another new album, the excellent For All Kings, which spawned singles like \u201cBlood Eagle Wings\u201d and \u201cMonster at the End\u201d and a surprising acoustic rendition of \u201cBreathing Lightning.\u201d. The band also announced a Record Store Day exclusive 7\u2033 for Black Friday, which featured \u201cA Monster at the End\u201d and \u201cVice of the People.\u201d\n\nEven Caggiano has had a busy 2016, releasing an album with his main gig Volbeat, Seal the Deal & Let\u2019s Boogie in June. Naturally, the single \u201cSeal the Deal\u201d was released from the album with a video being made."}, {"url": "https://metalinsider.net/supergroup-from-hell/members-of-the-damned-things-collaborate-on-new-project", "page_content": "The Damned Things\u2019s debut album Ironicast was arguably one of the best surprises to come out of 2010. Sure, a supergroup featuring members of Anthrax and Every Time I Die sounded promising. But many scratched their heads at the inclusion of Fall Out Boy drummer Andy Hurley and guitarist Joe Trohman. However, what resulted was a kick ass hard rock album.\n\nNow that we\u2019re well into 2012, though, The Damned Things are understandably taking a break for the foreseeable future. However, Trohman revealed that he would be continuing to work with his The Damned Things bandmate Josh Newton in his project With Knives. The Fall Out Boy guitarist gave the following lengthy update via his blog:\n\n\u201cJust filling everyone in on what\u2019s going on with myself and others are working on:\n\n-The Damned Things are most likely not doing anything in 2012. As I\u2019ve mentioned before ETID & Anthrax are very very busy touring their new records and I\u2019d be surprised if anyone pushes for something TDT related this year. This is not to say there won\u2019t be TDT again. I\u2019m confident there will, as we all want to do it again. It just has to fit into everyone\u2019s busy schedules. On top of that all, I\u2019m also gearing up for something.\n\n-Which now brings me to my next, and perhaps most exciting bit of news. Josh Newton, who played with The Damned Things with myself as well as various other rad bands (Every Time I Die, Shiner, Season To Risk to name a few), and I have started a new band called With Knives. With Knives began as a project Josh was working on on his own. When he joined TDT, he asked me to work on it with him, and so I did. It sounded a bit too realized to not turn it into an actual band. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing with it.\n\nNext month we will set out to Kansas City to record an EP. Then we will play shows and tour on this EP. We plan on putting it out ourselves using our Son Of Man thing as a record label. The plan is to release it as a 10\u201d and download only, considering more people own and use a computer these days than a CD player. SOM will still be making and selling our weird shirts as well.\n\n-And lastly, as I mentioned we plan on using Son Of Man as not just a way to unload some strange t-shirt designs, but also as a way to release music. There are a few other releases in the works that we plan on releasing via SOM, aside from the With Knives EP/10\u201d. In general, the plan with SOM the whole time has been to turn it into a sort of artist collective. Hopefully we will be able to work with other artists and musicians to collaborate and release their stuff in a safe, DIY environment that doesn\u2019t push them to do anything they don\u2019t want to do.\n\nJosh and I are really excited about the new band and continuing to work on Son Of Man. We\u2019ve been slaves to the musical grind in our own respects and we both feel we can finally begin to work on something that feels like who we are, regardless if it\u2019s met with open arms or not.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.antimusic.com/news/10/june/02Anthrax,_Fall_Out_Boy,_Every_Time_I_Die_Supergroup_The_Damned_Things_Make_Live_Debut.shtml", "page_content": "Not from New York? You can now check the band online and also see them in Europe this summer. The band launched their MySpace page last Friday and the page picked up more than 25,000 plays over the holiday weekend for the rough mixes of \"We've Got A Situation Here\" and \"Ironiclast,\" two tracks from their upcoming debut album on the Island Records, which was produced by Trohman and Caggianoi, and recorded mostly in Brooklyn, where Anthrax lives, with side trips to Buffalo, NY (Buckley's home), and Chicago (Trohman, Hurley) \ufffd will be announced in the weeks ahead.\n\nThe Damned Things will be at Rock Am Ring in Nurburgring, Germany, on June 4th, kicking off a round of European shows. They will be stopping for shows in Denmark (Rock Im Park, June 5th); Brussels (Vk, June 6th); Amsterdam (a free show at Melkweg, June 8th); London (Heaven, June 10th); and Copenhagen (Copenhell, June 12th); before wrapping it up at the Download Festival in Donnington (UK), June 13th.\n\n\"Whoa, black betty (bam-A-lam),\" sang Ram Jam on their 1977 hit single version of the Lead Belly tune. \"Whoa, black betty (bam-A-lam)/ Black betty had a child (bam-A-lam)/ The damn thing gone wild (bam-A-lam)\ufffd\" The Damned Things took their name from the song as a means to convey their gutsy intentions, which goes back to Trohman's original hook-up with Scott Ian three years ago. \"We were both interested in putting together a heavy/classic-rock, blues-oriented, riff-based band,\" Trohman says, \"while trying to stay away from what makes that sound generic and overplayed.\"\n\nTrohman and Hurley share roots in pre-Fall Out Boy heavy metal bands; Caggiano soon joined his bandmate Scott in the new venture. The Damned Things were whole when Buckley accepted their invitation to front the group. One listen to \"We've Got A Situation Here\" answers all the questions. \"Musically, it's a good representation of the band,\" says Trohman. \"It has the sludgy riffs, but there's a catchy chorus, a tempo change breakdown, and some leads/solos. There's a real bluesy feel to the verses.

It had everything you could want in a side project: sexy clean vocals, groove-inducing riffs, screams, Southern-styled metal\u2026 oh and fuckin\u2019 Scott Ian from Anthrax + Joe Trohman and Andy Hurley from Fall Out Boy. The supergroup also featured Volbeat\u2018s Rob Caggiano and ex-ETID bassist Josh Newton, both of whom have since departed, however in their place comes Alkaline Trio\u2018s Dan Andriano, so my initial thoughts going into this album are \u201ccan they back it up?\u201d and \u201cwill the new lineup change the dynamic of the original?\u201d Well, the only way to find out is to jump straight into it\u2026\n\nIt all kicks off with debut single \u2018Cells\u2018 which, upon release, blew me away with how similar it was to the first album. So much so, it could have been a B Side left over from the debut release. Everything you could want from the band is here: groovy riffs, a sing-a-long inducing chorus, heavy undertones, solos and Keith Buckley\u2018s oozing charisma throughout (especially during a stop down where he\u2019s panting for a break before realising the song is still going). I guarantee you, upon listening to this one for the second or third time you\u2019ll be screaming along to the lyrics \u201cwe are stars colliding/we are cells divided/we\u2019ve got all the time in the world/ but never the timing\u201d. The track ends with a brilliant Joe Trohman guitar solo which will make you wonder what the fuck he\u2019s doing with his time in Fall Out Boy when he could be riffing up around the world with these guys.\n\nFollowing on from this us the quirky sounding \u2018Something Good\u2018 which kicks off with clapping and the (cheerleader-esque) chanting lyrics of \u201cY-E-LL/all of my friends are going to hell\u201d but don\u2019t let that throw you off, once it gets going, the faster-paced rock vibes kick back in and you\u2019ve got yourself a great track, complete with MORE COWBELL than ever imaginable. This\u2019ll be the band\u2019s clap and sing-a-long song at future live shows. It sounds huge like if you blended stadium rock with southern metal, it\u2019d fucking go off in a large outdoor music festival setting (looking at you Good Things Festival). \u2018Invincible\u2018 begins with an almost acapella intro from Buckley\u2019s raspy vocals singing \u201ccut me up I\u2019m on display like a broken mirror you can\u2019t look away\u201d, which quickly turns into an all-in assault from the rest of the band. Its a bit slower compared to the last two songs, but the emphasis is on the guitars with this one, highlighting the sheer talent behind Scott Ian and Joe Trohman. It\u2019s fun, riffy and melodic AF. With an epic sounding opener, \u2018Omen\u2019 teases you into thinking you\u2019re about to cop a straight up metal song, before changing direction into a bluesy, southern rock belter you\u2019ll probably wanna listen to in your pick up truck with your trusty pooch beside you. The tempo, screams and ferocity are picked right the fuck up for \u2018Carry A Brick\u2018, as usual Keith shines now only with his beautiful melodic vocals but also his pleasing screams that fit the song perfectly. Andy Hurley on the drums deserves a standing ovation for his stop and start beats throughout. There\u2019s also yet another guitar solo with makes me feel like the guys were just jamming away in the studio, ripped that out of nowhere and said, yeah that fits, leave it in. The change in direction and stop and change did sound a little messy in parts, but not enough to derail the listening experience too much.\n\n\u2018Storm Charmer\u2018 is just a big, fucking, sexy chugga-filled slow jam. The type of song that\u2019s playing when a protagonist in a western movie enters a bar to look around for the villain or a potential side-kick. There\u2019s a touch of synth and (once again) a big focus on guitars, especially Dan Andriano\u2018s bass lines. This track also chops and changes tempo and momentum, but is much easier to listen to than the last. \u2018Young Hearts\u2018 reminds me of a less heavy ETID song in parts (akin to that of \u2018Decayin\u2019 With The Boys\u2018) so that\u2019s an added bonus before this one even gets a minute into it. In place of a breakdown, there\u2019s a ho-down complete with a piano in the background which I just fucking love and the entire piece is what I\u2019d kinda/sorta class as a fast-paced ballad. You can sing along to it, you can nod or bang your head and throw your devil horns in the air, but it\u2019s not fast enough for a circle pit if you get me. It\u2019s a good one, give it a couple of spins and my words will make more sense. \u2018Keep Crawling\u2018 is a heavy, (almost) grunge-infused belter that\u2019ll make you want to sway your hips from side to side in your tight jeans and RM Williams boots combo. There are a few air guitar worthy sections you can get involved with too and a build up to a slow breakdown I can see getting fans rowdy in the pit over towards the song\u2019s finale. At first, I thought I wouldn\u2019t enjoy it, but found myself going back again for more and more streams.\n\n\u2018Let Me Be (Your Girl)\u2018 speeds things the fuck up again and (much like first single \u2018Cells\u2018) could have been a leftover from the previous album\u2019s recording session. Do you love slick guitar riffs, thumping drum beats and the background sounds of a tambourine? Well, you\u2019ll be in your goddamn prime with this one. A seductively addictive love song for the mature metal fan who prefers the taste of whiskey, as opposed to beer. Arguably one of the best songs on the album (so far) too. However, all good things must come to an end and luckily for us, The Damned Things have saved a banger of a song for the climax which is fast, furious and full of dirty, stinkin\u2019 rock and roll. The slower sections compliment Keith Buckley\u2018s melodic vocals, whereas the faster parts really highlight just how distinctively good his screams/yells are. Once again, there are elements of Every Time I Die in this one (definitely \u2018We\u2019rewolf\u2018 according to my ears) but with that unique twang TDT have now grown to produce. There are plenty of guitar solos for even the harshest critic to froth over and a tantalising final few seconds which will get you hot and bothered like a cowboy at a rodeo. A FANTASTIC way to wrap up this latest offering from one of the most illusive fucking bands in the world.\n\nHigh Crimes is an exceptional follow up album that just oozes Sexy Southern Rock/Metal throughout. Each member showcases their musical abilities perfectly with a touch of class that makes you wish you were in the band too. The Damned Things are back and they better not be fucking off again anytime soon because once you cop a taste of this, you\u2019ll be begging for more.\n\nThe Damned Things \u2013 High Crimes tracklisting\n\n1.

However, members of all three bands formed in 2010 to release the album Ironicast as The Damned Things. After an unexpected hiatus, the group has re-formed years later to drop sophomore album High Crimes (April 26, Nuclear Blast). It\u2019s somewhat of a surprise \u2014 even to singer Keith Buckley.\n\n\u201cAfter the last record and the touring cycle was done, we were in a very uncertain place as far as the future went,\u201d he recalls.\n\nSince Ironicast\u2019s release, The Damned Things have been occupied with their primary bands. Fall Out Boy returned from a long break and put out three albums, while Anthrax\u2019s 2010 reunion with singer Joey Belladonna resulted in a career renaissance. Every Time I Die\u2019s profile has also increased, despite numerous lineup changes to its rhythm section. Between those priorities and some members\u2019 dissatisfaction with certain aspects of Ironicast\u2019s album cycle, The Damned Things slipped to the back burner.\n\nFall Out Boy guitarist Joe Trohman was the impetus for the reunion. While he and producer Jay Ruston (Steel Panther, Stone Sour) were writing songs for another artist, Ruston felt the material would fit The Damned Things, says Buckley. \u201cJoe is just a prolific writer, and it dawned on him that it might make sense to put together a new Damned Things single or record or EP. So he sent me the stuff, and we started going back and forth with lyrics and vocals, and the ball started rolling.\u201d\n\nBut before the group reformed, its members \u2014 which also had included Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian, Volbeat guitarist Rob Caggiano (who was in Anthrax at the time), Fall Out Boy drummer Andy Hurley and former Every Time I Die bassist Josh Newton \u2014 discussed how they wanted to move forward. \u201cI knew that I was going to have to get a lot of things straight from the jump of, \u2018This is what happened last time that I didn\u2019t agree with,\u2019 \u201d says Buckley. \u201cAnd everything I said, Joe agreed with. When we brought everyone together and broached the subject of doing it again, Josh bowed out, and Rob was MIA. We started working anyway, and a lot of the problems and things we disagreed with the last time weren\u2019t there.\u201d (Alkaline Trio singer-bassist Dan Andriano has since joined the band.)\n\nOne thing that Buckley was previously disappointed with was that the group didn\u2019t tour behind Ironicast as much as he would have liked. \u201cThere were so many expectations behind it when it started, and it was just one touring cycle,\u201d he says. \u201cHad I known that, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten my hopes up. I never was in a position where I was like, \u2018I\u2019m never going to do that again.\u2019 It was just a nebulous thing where somebody had to make a decision and nobody wanted to talk about it, so we just went on with our lives and hoped it would circle back one day.\u201d\n\nBuckley also observes that Ironicast \u201cwas so polished and laminated and precise that it lost a lot of the emotion.\u201d Describing the recording process as \u201carduous,\u201d he explains, \u201cWith me doing take after take after take, I lost any connection and emotional tie to the songs. The performance became so routine that I almost didn\u2019t even like it.\u201d He felt like he was \u201cover the songs before we even got to the stage \u2026 Then you get to the stage and they take on a new life, and you learn that and you\u2019re like, \u2018Fuck, I wish I had done this before I\u2019d recorded because I feel that part differently now.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWorking with Ruston helped loosen up the process. \u201cIt almost didn\u2019t feel like there was an adult in the room, and I mean that in a good way,\u201d says Buckley of the producer. \u201cHe was just so open and encouraging about everything and trying what we wanted to do. There were times where we\u2019d get so carried away doing different stuff and having fun. The energy that he brought to the room was very positive and playful, which is a completely different experience from the last [time], and I think that was good, because it brought our moods up. And when your mood is up, and you end up writing and recording a song like \u2018Cells,\u2019 it just feels fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cFun\u201d is a great summation of High Crimes. Featuring elements of Fall Out Boy\u2019s hooky pop, Anthrax\u2019s chugging guitars and Buckley\u2019s melodic yet impassioned vocals, the result is a high-energy hard rock collection. Cheerleader chants and cowbell are abundant on \u201cSomething Good,\u201d and subtle keyboard flourishes decorate \u201cOmen.\u201d The intentionally exaggerated breathing and impassioned \u201cOh fuck\u201d that Buckley lets out before coming in with a verse on \u201cCells\u201d captures the frenetic joy of the band\u2019s live show \u2014 and performing live is something that The Damned Things will indulge in more this time around.\n\n\u201cWe all understand that we\u2019ve got other stuff going on,\u201d says Buckley. \u201cSince the last time, [members have] gotten married and had kids and there\u2019s other aspects to our lives where we can\u2019t do it all the time, but this record needs a shot \u2026 The last album, people were asking [that we tour more], and we were saying, \u2018No,\u2019 and that was really stupid of us. I feel like it didn\u2019t get the chance that it deserved. So as long as there\u2019s people that are interested in it, we\u2019re going to keep doing it.\u201d\n\nBuckley sees The Damned Things 2.0 lasting longer this time. \u201cThe legs are so much stronger beneath it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have so much more experience with each other; we have so much more experience writing songs even as individuals with our other bands. It feels like it\u2019s our time, and we\u2019ve finally hit our stride.\u201d Touring Europe is a goal, as well as Southeast Asia. But Buckley has an even simpler ambition: \u201cI want to see a Damned Things song in a movie. I want to be watching a shitty action movie in a theater, and I want there to be a Damned Things song in it \u2014 that\u2019s my specific, ultimate goal for the band.\u201d\n\nThe Damned Things tour dates:\n\nMay 1 Los Angeles@The Whiskey?\n\nMay 4 Jacksonville, Fla.@Welcome to Rockville?\n\nMay 6 Lancaster, Pa.@The Chameleon\n\nMay 7 Brooklyn@Brooklyn Bazaar?\n\nMay 8 Pittsburgh, Pa.@The Rex?\n\nMay 10 Nashville@The Cowan?\n\nMay 11 Rockingham, N.C.@Epicenter Fest?\n\nMay 12 Lexington, Ky.@Manchester Music Hall?\n\nMay 14 Grand Rapids, Mich.@Elevation@The Intersection?\n\nMay 16 Flint, Mich.@Machine Shop\n\nMay 17 Chicago@The Bottom Lounge?\n\nMay 18 Springfield, Mo.@Outland Ballroom?\n\nMay 19 Dallas@Gas Monkey\n\nMay 21 Denver@Oriental Theater?\n\nMay 22 Colorado Springs, Colo.@Black Sheep?\n\nMay 24 Tempe, Ariz.@Tempe Marketplace (KUPD Concert Series)\n\nMay 25 San Diego@Brick by Brick"}, {"url": "https://metalinsider.net/tag/andy-hurley", "page_content": "ICYMI: Rage Against the Machine to be inducted into RNRHOF; Iron Maiden & Soundgarden snubbed once again In case you missed it, in a recent announcement last Wednesday, May 3, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame revealed its 2023 inductees, including Rage Against the Machine, Kate Bush, Missy Elliott, Sheryl Crow, Willie Nelson, George Michael, and the Spinners.
