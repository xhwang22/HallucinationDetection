The twang in her voice comes naturally.\n\nLandes calls it a \u201clilt,\u201d but she says, \u201cpeople have always thought I had a twang in my voice, and my parents were always like, where did that come from?\u201d\n\nA native of Indiana, she grew up mostly in Kentucky; Loretta Lynn once actually came to sing at the coal mine where her father worked. After graduating from New York University, Landes stuck around in the city to become part of its folk music scene and to build a career as a producer and sound engineer.\n\n2. She\u2019s attracted to the vintage Nashville \u201ccountrypolitan\u201d sound.\n\nLandes\u2019 musical output \u2013 five albums over the past 13 years \u2013 is an eclectic assortment of indy rock, folk, and pop sounds (including an entire album sung in French). But she\u2019s always been attracted to the lush sounds and legendary artists who came out of country in the 1960s. About four years ago, with more than a little bit of Dolly\u2019s register in her voice, she came in second at an annual competition in Sevierville, Tennessee, that honors Parton\u2019s songwriting.\n\n\u201cI did it on a whim,\u201d she says. \u201cMy friend dared me to enter it.\u201d\n\nTennessee continued to beckon, and after traveling to Nashville for songwriting sessions, Landes decided a couple of years ago that she had to record her own countrypolitan album.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I was going for, but I didn\u2019t know how to get it myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought it would be great to work with someone who was sort of entrenched in the long-ago scene. I went straight to the source.\u201d\n\nShervin Lainez\n\n3. She talked a country legend out of semi-retirement to produce the album.\n\nDetermined to produce an authentic sound, Landes set her sights on Fred Foster, the Hall of Fame member who was pivotal in the careers of Parton, Roy Orbison and Kris Kristofferson. Now 86, Foster hadn\u2019t produced an album since 2007 \u2013 and that one featured country deities Merle Haggard and Ray Price.\n\nBoldly, Landes cold-called Foster to plead her case. So what made him say yes?\n\n\u201cPart of it was persistence on my end,\u201d she says, but she finally won him over with her songwriting skills.\n\nTogether, they spent hours polishing the songs before she ever entered the studio; Foster then assembled a who\u2019s who list of studio musicians, including Hall of Famer Charlie McCoy. Even Hall of Fame artist Bobby Bare dropped by to serve as a sly foil on a duet.\n\n4. Landes now has a bona fide Loretta Lynn connection.\n\nAfter moving to Nashville last year, Landes answered a Craigslist ad and ended up buying a blue pickup from Lynn\u2019s music director, Bart Hansen. They have since become friends, and Hansen can be seen playing guitar, over Landes\u2019 right shoulder, in the \u201cTraveling\u201d video. For that matter, the pickup is in the video, too, as well as a lyrical mention of \u201cLoretta on the radio.\u201d\n\nAt Hansen\u2019s behest, Landes recently home-recorded a video greeting to Lynn, whom Hansen visits weekly while she recuperates from a stroke and a broken hip.\n\n\u201cShe sent me one back,\u201d Landes marvels. \u201cCan you believe that? I have a video of Loretta saying hello to me and \u2018I hope you have a good day.\u2019 I love it so much.\u201d\n\nShervin Lainez\n\n5. She met her husband at music camp.\n\nOr, more formally, the prestigious Johnny Mercer Writers Colony, where both received grants in 2015 to work on full-length musicals.\n\nHusband Creighton Irons is an accomplished musical composer \u2014 and an incredibly supportive spouse who can be seen on the keyboard in the \u201cTraveling\u201d video. He also plans to join Landes on stage for at least a portion of the U.S. and European tour she\u2019ll be on through October to support the album.\n\nWhether their 1-year-old daughter, Callan, will be with them or with her grandparents has yet to be determined, but she\u2019s already well acquainted with Mom\u2019s new album. Not only has she attended recent shows, but Landes was pregnant during all of the recording sessions.\n\n\u201cShe was there the entire time, really,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope she likes it when she\u2019s older. I hope she\u2019s not like, \u2018All those songs! No more!\u2019\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/how-indie-songwriter-dawn-landes-revived-lush-nashville-sound-on-new-album-707516/", "page_content": "Dawn Landes made a deliberate choice about what kind of music she hoped to make when she approached Monument Records founder Fred Foster about producing her new album. Even so, Landes still had to prove her artistic worth to the 86-year-old Country Music Hall of Fame member, who had mostly retired from recording 10 years earlier.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t even Google me or anything. He never heard of me, so therefore I didn\u2019t really exist,\u201d says the Kentucky native, who relocated from New York to Nashville with her husband during the recording process. \u201cI think I had to convince him I was a writer. At first he thought, \u2018I like your voice.\u2019 I came and I sang some songs and I think he thought, \u2018OK, we\u2019ll find you some good songs to sing.'\u201d\n\nLandes eventually sold him on her writing with a song called \u201cWhat Will I Do,\u201d a plaintive, sadness-tinged waltz about uncertainty. Her partnership with Foster confirmed, the two began an intensive period of listening, learning and singing myriad songs, both well-known and obscure (\u201cHe called it \u2018woodshedding,'\u201d she says) that would inform the choices on her new album Meet Me at the River, out Friday. With contributions from some of Nashville\u2019s A-team studio musicians, the album comes steeped in the lushly orchestrated productions of the classic Nashville Sound era, when Foster was making a mark as producer of Dolly Parton\u2019s early work and Roy Orbison\u2019s classic period.\n\nOn her previous albums, Landes explored a wide variety of styles, from approachable indie pop and folk to the French-language album Mal Habille\u00e9, also collaborating with Sufjan Stevens, Will Oldham and Norah Jones. There was always a noticeable country lilt in her bell-clear voice, but occasions where she leaned fully into it were the exception \u2014 as with 2008\u2019s Straight Lines, when she cut a lively two-stepping rendition of Peter, Bjorn and John\u2019s \u201cYoung Folks\u201d with some veteran bluegrass musicians she met on the street in Austin.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018I would love to make a whole album with this band. I would love to make a whole album like this,'\u201d she says. That experience in Austin also turned out to be the first time she ever heard Jimmy Driftwood\u2019s \u201cThe Battle of New Orleans,\u201d which was perhaps prophetic: Landes recorded the Driftwood songs \u201cMy Church\u201d and \u201cWhat Is the Color of the Soul of Man\u201d for Meet Me at the River.\n\nAlong with Driftwood\u2019s relevant-as-ever plea for racial equality, Landes contributes her own timely message about protest in turbulent times with the stirring \u201cKeep on Moving,\u201d paying tribute to those who march in support of a cause. Inspired by activist Peace Pilgrim and her decades-long marches across the United States, the song has numerous parallels to the present.\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\n\u201cI just feel the urgency of the moment to get out there and have your voice be heard,\u201d she says. \u201cAlso, I started to think about it, \u2018Why do people do that? Why do people get up and walk?\u2019 Because they\u2019re upset about something or they\u2019re moved by something.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Landes seizes upon different aspects of classic country songcraft. The title track on Meet Me at the River is a delicate, wistful number about reuniting with an old friend. She follows that with \u201cTraveling,\u201d a jangling anthem about the open road that evokes Car Wheels-era Lucinda Williams.\n\nAlso in the classic country tradition, Landes balances humorous, winking gestures like \u201cWhy They Name Whiskey After Men\u201d against the sweetness and uncertainty of \u201cHow to Say \u2018I Love You.'\u201d Later, she yucks it up with Bobby Bare on the album-closing number \u201cI Don\u2019t Dance,\u201d the result of a nerve-wracking visit to Bare\u2019s home to ask about collaborating. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Welcome to my house, play this song on Shel Silverstein\u2019s guitar,'\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s not intimidating or anything.\u201d\n\nUltimately, it was Foster\u2019s expertise in this area that helped Landes \u2014 who\u2019s produced and engineered much of her previous work \u2014 choose the right songs and sequence the album. When necessary, he sent her back to the drawing board to find the simple kernel of truth and plainspoken language in those classic country songs.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Can you help me streamline this, whatever it is?'\u201d she says. \u201cI think really it was choosing the songs, and he did that. I brought him tons of songs and he said, \u2018This one, this one, this one,\u2019 [or] \u2018This one doesn\u2019t work.\u2019 A lot of times I got, \u2018It\u2019s too poetic. We need conversational.'\u201d\n\nIt was a nice reminder from one of country\u2019s architects to stick with the basics \u2014 the way she had when she originally won him over.\n\n\u201cSimple is best in a country song,\u201d she says. \u201cElementally that works with all music, but it\u2019s just so obvious in country music. Say it plainly. Say something tongue-in-cheek. Find a new spin.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.ted.com/speakers/dawn_landes", "page_content": "Dawn Landes, with her bright, supple voice and her restless imagination, is drawn to create and collaborate.

But, during our recent chat, she informed me of a very recent project that surprised even me. She had just premiered the video for \u201cBluebird,\u201d the title track of her upcoming album, due out February 18th on Western Vinyl\u2026 And let\u2019s just say that the collaboration with dancer Storyboard P is just not exactly what you would expect to see being soundtracked by a soulfully hushed Americana number.\n\n\u201cMy video just came out, just now, on Wall Street Journal, so I\u2019ve been telling everyone about that. I just made a really cool music video with this awesome dancer I\u2019ve been obsessed with for a few months now. He\u2019s this hip-hop dancer. He\u2019s just awesome.\u201d\n\nLandes first came across Storyboard P at a party at which they were each performing and she was inspired to the way he moved to her music\u2026 she even goes so far as to compare him to Charlie Chaplin and Pina Bausch. Landes also tells me that this isn\u2019t the only video project we should expect of her in the near future.\n\n\u201cFor this album I\u2019m doing three music videos, which is two more than I\u2019ve done for any other album. I mean, it\u2019s a big thing now. That\u2019s how so many people experience music. People just go to YouTube. I mean, look at Beyonce, with a video for every song.\u201d\n\nAnd while Bluebird is being touted as a breakup record, inspired by her recent split from husband Josh Ritter, she tells me that there\u2019s a lot more to it than that: \u201cAlbums are postcards from a certain point and time and this was a time in my life coloured by many things, including a divorce, but my music is inspired by many things, from a song I hear, a book I read, just anything I experience.\u201d This album also represents a brand new recording process for Landes: \u201cThis is the first album where I\u2019ve ever worked with a producer, but I worked with Thomas Bartlett for this one. That was a really big difference for me, considering I\u2019m a producer and engineer myself. I never trusted anyone enough before, but working with Thomas has been really great.\u201d\n\nThe songs of Bluebird are elegantly somber, but also incredibly proud and hopeful. I tell her that my favorite track is album closer \u201cHome,\u201d which I tell her I find brilliant and that it reminds me of a Mozzian brand of existentialism filtered through a country aesthetic (It opens with the lines, \u201cLord please, follow me home, \u2018Cause I\u2019m down on my knees, and I feel alone.\u201d) She seems highly amused and, I hope, a bit flattered by my assessment, but tells me that it\u2019s the title track that she holds nearest and dearest: \u201c\u2019Bluebird\u2019 is very special to me. I feel it was a gift that was given to me and I love it when that happens to me. I don\u2019t know if I believe in divinity, but that would be what I consider a gift.\u201d\n\n[youtube http://youtu.be/dChn32CwbpA]\n\nDawn just began a short string of dates, which she\u2019s very excited about: \u201cI\u2019m excited to tour because I haven\u2019t toured the states in quite a while.\u201d A number of these dates include support slots for The Autumn Defense, including a date that will have her playing Boot & Saddle on Valentine\u2019s Day. She\u2019s especially excited about these dates alongside the Americana-tinged indie pop duo: \u201cI really like those guys. I like their music and they\u2019re so good live.\u201d Of her live sets, she tells me they\u2019re going to be a little different from previous tours: \u201cI\u2019m bringing a guitar player and another singer. This is gonna be a little more folky and intimate that previous tours.\u201d However, what she\u2019s currently most focused on and antsy about isn\u2019t the kind of musical venture she\u2019s taken on in the past.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m writing a musical right now, actually\u2026 I mean, Cyndi Lauper did it, so why not? I mean, being here in New York, I know a lot of theatre people and I recently ran into a director that I haven\u2019t seen in like seven years and he wanted to work with me. I\u2019d just read this memoir about the first woman to row a wooden boat across the Atlantic, which I just found so inspiring. And she\u2019s also an academic. She\u2019s just a really impressive person, but in order to do the musical we had to get her permission, so we had a show and played the songs for her in Louisville, where I\u2019m from, and she just thought it was great and I was so happy about that. I mean, I\u2019m terrified of her. She\u2019s like an intellectual giant.\u201d\n\nAnd while musicals are something new to Dawn, she\u2019s very excited about the project (which just got funding and requires that she have it written by the year\u2019s end), despite the fact that she has no idea when it will eventually see the light of day: \u201cThat\u2019s the thing about musicals. They take forever. I mean, Karen O did a musical, which I saw and which was great, but that took forever\u2026 and she\u2019s Karen O.\u201d But that\u2019s not enough to scare Dawn from the project: \u201cI think it\u2019s really exciting. I mean, musicals are entertaining and people really get into them. And it\u2019s also always nice to expand your palate of what you can do.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/dawn-landes/", "page_content": "Dawn Landes (born December 5, 1980) is an American singer-songwriter and musician.

She must\u2019ve liked what she heard, because that tiny mustard seed has since flowered into three studio albums. On her most recent effort, Sweet Heart Rodeo, the Louisville native delivers a collection of acoustic pop gems, charged with the imagery of the open road. American Songwriter chatted with the Brooklyn-based artist about the new album, her upcoming tour and the studio she built with her own two hands.\n\nYou\u2019ve got a tour coming up with Justin Townes Earle. How did the two of you get hooked up?\n\nI\u2019ve played a few festivals with Justin and seen him around a little. We\u2019ve got the same booking agent in the States, so I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s how that happened, but I like his music so it\u2019s gonna be a fun tour.\n\nYou recently built your own studio in Brooklyn called Saltlands. When did you get the idea to do that, and do you have your sights set on producing?\n\nWell, I\u2019ve been working in studios now for about nine years and it\u2019s always been at the back of my mind to have my own space. Saltlands is a true collective though, with myself and some great producers and engineers like Gary Maurer (from Hem) and Steve Salett (King of France). We built the studio initially because Steve and I collaborated on a movie soundtrack together (Familiar Strangers\u2013 you can find it on Netflix) and I\u2019ve produced a bunch of artists there in the last two years \u2026. Andrew Vladeck from The Honey Brothers, Balthrop Alabama, The Bandana Splits, Poison Tree, mostly New York-based bands that I love.\n\nYou\u2019ve been a part time member of the Brooklyn band Hem. How big a role did that experience play in your musical education?\n\nOh, huge! Not only was Gary Maurer a mentor in the engineering realm, but I learned so much from all the band, touring with them and getting to know them as crazy geniuses. Dan Messe turned me on to so much music \u2013Burt Bacharach, Carole King. And Steve and Gary schooled me in the country department\u2026 Doc Watson and The Carter Family. I discovered so much music from these guys. Like Dylan and Dave Van Ronk, Vol 1.\n\nYou\u2019ve had a number of songs placed in film and TV, most recently the song \u201cStraight Lines\u201d which was featured in a Chrysler commercial. Have you seen a sizeable spike in your fan base from the spots?\n\nHmm, I don\u2019t know! I\u2019m always amazed that anyone comes to my shows. It\u2019s really a mystery to me how people find out about my stuff. I\u2019d definitely say that a few people have requested songs that have been on TV more than other songs, if that\u2019s what you mean.\n\nWhere did this rodeo motif come from for the new album? Were you a cowgirl in another life?\n\nI wish I was a cowgirl in this life! No, I was always around country music, mostly in Branson, Missouri, and Louisville when I was growing up\u2026but never a true cowgirl, no. I did go to at least a few rodeos though back then, and they always stuck with me. Also, the title song on this record \u201cSweetheart of the Rodeo\u201d is a true story about my great-grandfather who left my family to go join the rodeo. So there\u2019s always been this mystique around the rodeo for me. A love-hate thing I guess.\n\nWhen did you first start writing songs? And who are some of your songwriting heroes?\n\nI started writing songs as soon as my dad taught me to press \u201cREC\u201d on his hand-held tape recorder when I was seven years old. I played music in school and always sang in the choir\u2026 played in bands in high school, all that stuff\u2026. My real heroes are writers that pack a punch, give me images I can use for years at a time and a melody I can sing forever\u2026. Lucinda Williams, Tom Petty, Carole King, Woody Guthrie, Wilco\u2026. there are too many to name!\n\nDo you ever write with husband Josh Ritter?\n\nNot officially, no, although we have quite a repertoire of silly songs in the works, a la Really Rosie."}, {"url": "https://americansongwriter.com/dawn-landes-old-country/", "page_content": "Dawn Landes\u2019 prodigious output over the past 13 years has made her a familiar name in Americana circles, with a fan base that appreciates her blend of easygoing folk and indie rock-pop shaded with an occasional bluegrass nuance. But with her new album, Meet Me At The River, Landes has suddenly been christened a new darling of country (depending on your current definition of that genre) by certain media outlets, because of her associations as much as her music. Armed with a batch of songs she wanted to give the old-school treatment to, she cajoled Nashville production icon Fred Foster (Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson) out of semi-retirement to help bring her vision of a true country record to reality.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nA Louisville, Kentucky native who has spent much of her career in New York, Landes is articulate and fun to talk to with an easy laugh. She says she isn\u2019t exactly sure of what her sound or style should be called in these genre-bending times. \u201cIt\u2019s such a strange question, \u2018What is country music,\u2019 y\u2019know? I asked Fred that, I asked, \u2018What is country music?\u2019 I like the original country, I like Hank Williams, I like Woody Guthrie, but was Woody country? I like songs. Fred\u2019s answer to that question was, \u2018What country?\u2019 I mean, Fred produced Kris Kristofferson, was he country?\u201d Then she laughs.\n\nFor the 12-track Meet Me At The River, Foster lined up some of Nashville\u2019s top old-school session players to help give the album the country vibe that Landes was after. She says that being polite but persistent on the phone with Foster was the key to getting an audience with him to discuss the project. It wasn\u2019t a slam dunk, though.\n\n\u201cI had a bunch of songs written,\u201d she says, \u201cand I went to his house and played them and he said, \u2018Okay, what else have you got?\u2019 He liked some of them \u2026 he made me go back and look at editing them, he was a really good editor for me.\u201d The recording process was done over a period of six months or so, with Landes writing even more songs and editing them to the point where they met with her approval and Foster\u2019s.\n\nCountry legend Bobby Bare sings with Landes on the album\u2019s duet \u201cI Don\u2019t Dance,\u201d which required yet another nerve-wracking meeting with a legend. \u201cI had to go over to his house and convince him to sing on the song,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was terrified, but I played him the song \u2014 he let me play it on [late songwriter] Shel Silverstein\u2019s guitar! He was there for the tracking of it, which was so fun, and then he came in and did some overdubs. He just added to the cachet of it, he\u2019s so soulful. When we were in the booth, and it was a small booth, he was chewing tobacco and he brought a cup. It was pretty cool.\u201d\n\nLandes says Foster was more than just an editor on that song with Bare, and that he actually got a co-writing credit. \u201cI had originally written that one for a musical I\u2019ve been working on,\u201d she says. \u201cI re-purposed the song to be more about me than about the character in the musical, and Fred helped me write that.\u201d\n\nComparing this new effort to nearly a dozen other albums and EPs she has recorded, Landes says, \u201cI think I was ready to try something different. I know if I had produced this album myself the songs wouldn\u2019t have sounded the same. Working with Fred just added a whole other ingredient, like one of those ingredients that brings a dish all together but you don\u2019t really taste it.\u201d\n\nRelatively few musicians are able to make music their only vocation, but in addition to her success with recordings and live performances, Landes is also an accomplished engineer who has worked with Philip Glass and Ryan Adams, and is a good enough bass player to have landed a spot in Sufjan Stevens\u2019 touring band a couple years ago. And the placement of her songs in numerous television shows (Californication, The Good Wife) and movies (Winter Passing, Savage Grace) has likely provided some extra mailbox money. Landes has also filled the opening slot for an eclectic group of prestigious artists, from Ray LaMontagne to Bryan Ferry. She says that she just pretty much does what she does no matter who she\u2019s opening for, including an icon like Ferry, on a tour she says was pretty much like any other.\n\n\u201cI just sang my songs,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was just me and another woman playing with me, and that was a pretty stark contrast to Bryan Ferry\u2019s giant band. But I think it worked, the audience seemed to like me. On that tour I had just put out a covers EP, so we played [Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer\u2019s] \u2018Moon River,\u2019 and people would come up to me afterwards with a story about how much \u2018Moon River\u2019 meant to them. And that was really special.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.dawnlandes.com/bio/", "page_content": "DAWN LANDES\n\nOther echoes inhabit the garden. Shall we follow?

She is also a sometimes-member of the band Hem, where she has lent her voice to harmony vocals, and played glockenspiel. She has worked as an audio engineer at Stratosphere Sound in New York City and at Philip Glass\u2019 own personal recording studio. She has shared the stage with artists such as Josh Ritter (to whom she was married), Suzanne Vega, Jose Gonzalez, Feist, The Weakerthans, Andrew Bird, Midlake, Alexi Murdoch and many others.\n\nThe press has likened Landes to \u201cthe grand old dames of country\u201d and in the same breath The Black Keys and The White Stripes (Uncut). She\u2019s also garnered comparisons to Cat Power and Pavement, an interesting mix that made even NPR\u2019s David Dye wonder.\n\nRaised in the fertile musical fields of Branson, Missouri and Louisville, Kentucky, Landes came to New York City in 1999 and did a cannonball into the music scene. While holding down several jobs to pay the rent, she abandoned university (NYU) and began to intern at some of the best studios in the city. \u201cI had very little experience\u201d, she says. \u201cI was just really, really curious. Dangerously curious in the studio\u2026 I picked heros like Tchad Blake and Brian Wilson and took a flying leap.\u201d\n\nWhat started as a job getting coffee for engineers has blossomed into a truly enviable resume; among others she has worked with Phillip Glass, Ryan Adams, Hem, Joseph Arthur, The Earlies and Josh Ritter in the studio. Working late into the night, and often sleeping at the same studios she was interning in, Dawn began producing and recording her own songs after hours. \u201cI wanted to get the sounds in my head onto tape exactly as I heard them. And that\u2019s not an easy thing, there are a lot of sounds in there!\u201d\n\nAfter meeting the band Hem in the studio, Landes joined them on the road as an 8th band member (vocals and glockenspeil) and opening act. Her performing career started to gain speed. Her first full-length, \u00abdawn\u2019s music\u00bb was released in France in 2005, followed by extensive touring in Europe and two other European releases; \u00ab234\u00bb a 7-song EP released in the UK and finally \u00abFireproof\u00bb, released worldwide in 2007. Since then her music has become the stuff of whispers and internet buzz, and her touring schedule has put her on the road with artists such as Feist, Jose Gonzales, Midlake, Suzanne Vega, Martha Wainright, The Swell Season\u2026(the list goes on) At times solo, at times with a revolving cast of musical guests, her shows have the guileless and vibrant quality of a work of art in constant creation.\n\nLandes penned the end-credit song for the movie \u00abSavage Grace\u00bb starring Julianne Moore and plucked the WST Bluegrass band from a BBQ in Austin, TX to help her record her version of the Peter, Bjorn and John classic, \u00abYoung Folks.\u00bb Rumor has it, James Blunt liked it so much he covered dawns cover of the song!

Fireproof, the NYC - by way of Louisville, KY - multi-instrumentalist and singer/songwriter has produced a record that seems to come from the honest-tilled soil of America's heartland, yet many of these songs also shine with the 'bright lights, big city' vibrancy of her newly adopted hometown.\n\n\n\nNo stranger to the music scene, Dawn has spent time in the studio with greats such as Phillip Glass, Ryan Adams, Joseph Arthur and the indie-folk band Hem (the latter which she toured with as their glockenspiel player and background vocalist after an extensive European tour supporting Suzanne Vega).\n\n\n\nIt was the studio that was to become her musical playground where she learned to play a multitude of various instruments. While the overall tone and vibe of her new album is atmospheric with a cool sense of detachment, she gets to 'play in the sand,' so to speak, as she personally weaves in banjos, toy pianos, bells, organs, guitars, optigans and what seems like just about everything but the kitchen sink. And by incorporating so many different musical textures into these well-crafted songs the end result is a rewarding one. Synths bubble from underneath the strong number \"Kids In A Play,\" as Landes' vocal delivery commands not unlike a young Sinead O'Connor, while she also delivers some absolutely heavenly frail folk sonnets, such as the banjo-kissed \"Tired of This Life,\" \"Twilight\" and the lovely \"Dig Me A Hole,\" where, amidst angelic harmonies and a ghostly melody, she proves her salt as a songwriter. And as an additional treat she's included the bonus track of Tom Petty's \"I Won't Back Down\" that strips back the rocking edge to revel the inner beauty of the song itself.\n\n\n\nLandes picks up the tempo a bit on not only the traditional folk number \"I Don't Need No Man,\" which finds her running through some of her vocal stanzas in a stream-of-conscience rap-like delivery, but also the quirky, vaudeville-on-valium \"Picture Show,\" which eventually rips into a stomping electric jam.\n\n\n\nMore than anything, though, these songs prove that Dawn Landes is an intriguing, enigmatic artist that takes some of the best elements of American folk music and twists it all around into something refreshingly new and beguiling."}, {"url": "https://philipbowenmusic.bandcamp.com/track/lady-may-instrumental", "page_content": "Digital Track Streaming + Download\n\nIncludes unlimited streaming via the free Bandcamp app, plus high-quality download in MP3, FLAC and more.\n\nPurchasable with gift card"}, {"url": "https://www.whosdatedwho.com/dating/dawn-landes-musician", "page_content": "Dawn Landes American Musician 0 0\n\nedit Age 42 Zodiac\n\nDawn Landes dating history\n\nWho is she dating right now?\n\nAccording to our records, Dawn Landes is possibly single.\n\nRelationships\n\nWe have no records of past relationships for Dawn Landes .\n\nAbout\n\nDawn Landes is a 42 year old American Musician born on 5th December, 1980 in Louisville, Kentucky.

Based on heritage values, they determined which historical information had to be retained. Even though the materials for the renovation could not be the same as those used in the past, the architect asked that the craftsmanship be as close as possible to the original, therefore maximising the expression of artistic value. Eventually, the interior structures, as well as the western fa\u00e7ade, were successfully preserved in a way that resembled the original.\n\n3.1 Reinforcing the beamless superstructure system\n\nYong\u2019an Warehouse represents one of the first implementations of a beamless superstructure system in China. The structural systems within the twin buildings were fully retained, but the interior walls had been repeatedly repainted. Thus, the design team used a high-pressure water gun to clean the entire structure of the remaining paint and carefully restored the reinforced concrete frame structures to their original state.\n\nThe architects analysed the building structure and frequently met with the local Cultural Heritage Department to discuss the seismic requirements. They came up with a solution to insert eight reinforced concrete core tubes, strengthen the horizontal supports and provide for emergency evacuation routes and equipment installation without the removal of any of the octagonal prismatic columns (Fig. 7). To address the rooftop\u2019s loading standards, they decided to insert steel interlayers into the top floor and rooftop structures, which invisibly increased the load capacity for the equipment.\n\nFig. 7 Plans of the Yong\u2019an Warehouse renovation (Source: Archi-Union Architects) Full size image\n\nFurthermore, the reinforced steel panels and frames in the original building were retained, and reinforced concrete was applied for renovation. The change in materials also reflected the transformation of the building structure as well as its interior space (Figs. 8 and 9).\n\nFig. 8 Renovated beam and slab structures on the top level (Source: Tianzhou Yang) Full size image\n\nFig. 9 Renovated beamless structural system of the interior (Source: Tianzhou Yang) Full size image\n\n3.2 Renovating the peripheral compartments\n\nYong\u2019an Warehouse was built in a modern style with a clear sense of architectural rhythm. The building\u2019s west wing most clearly retained the appearance of the original fa\u00e7ade. After the outer layer of paint was removed, the stuccoed texture of the concrete was clear to the eye. As the structural integrity of the interior walls was largely compromised due to repeated damage, for safety reasons, the design team decided that 80% of the walls needed to be renovated. Because of the difficulty of preserving the traces of erosion while making the structure stable, the team decided to restore the walls to their original state.\n\nThe architects collaborated with a group of experts to experiment with and test the concrete stuccoed technique to replicate the original appearance of the exterior walls. They also invited craftsmen equipped with traditional skills to repair the old aperture compartments.\n\nBalancing the new and the old through an understanding of their relationship, minimal intervention has always been the key to renovations of historic architecture. For Yong\u2019an Warehouse, a design process following the symbiotic twin strategy was used for the east wing building, which had less preservation value, to honour its historical origin and maintain the project\u2019s underlying coherence. Overall, characteristics such as the building\u2019s footage and the general silhouette were generally retained since the design details could distinguish the new from the old. (Fig. 10).\n\nFig. 10 Axonometric view of Yong\u2019an Warehouse (Source: Archi-Union Architects) Full size image\n\n3.3 Renovating the twin Fa\u00e7ades\n\nThe fact that the east wing building had gone through several severe reconstructions enabled the architects to move beyond an exact replication and to instead apply novel technologies to revive the rhythm and imagery of the original fa\u00e7ade. For instance, they used screen printing to reproduce the stuccoed texture on glass panels. The printed images were taken from the restored west building and transferred at an exact 1:1 ratio onto the glass panels (Figs. 11 and 12). After careful calibration, the panels, once installed, made the two buildings almost identical from a distance but distinctively different up close. In this way, the warehouse\u2019s three life phases, as represented by its historical fa\u00e7ade, the marks of previous renovations and the new fa\u00e7ade of screen-printed glass, were all shown in a single view. The high and low light of the twin buildings at night indicated the symbiotic twin relationship connecting the past and the future (Figs. 13 and 14).\n\nFig. 11 Internal view of the fa\u00e7ades made of screen-printed glass (Source: Fangfang Tian) Full size image\n\nFig. 12 Details of the screen-printed glass panels (Source: left by Tianzhou Yang; right by Fangfang Tian) Full size image\n\nFig. 13 Symbiotic Twin Fa\u00e7ades: the old and the new (Source: Fangfang Tian) Full size image\n\nFig. 14 Walking path along the river (Source: Tianzhou Yang) Full size image\n\nTo meet the green building standards, the screen-printed glass became part of a triple-layered glass window system with insulating air between the layers. Each opening is composed of two of these glass panels. Similar techniques were applied to the loading dock on the west side and to the fa\u00e7ade of the side building. The loading dock was maintained in its original form. However, the side room built in 1990 was preserved only with its mainframe structure. The entrance was replaced with screen-printed glass panels as well.\n\n3.4 Rebuilding the historical water tank\n\nIn 2011, the original water tank was removed, which separated the two building volumes and destroyed the unique quality of the industrial structure in terms of the overall composition. To recreate the rhythmic silhouette, the architects decided to reuse the original water tank as a formal guideline for an observatory on the rooftop with a complete steel structure instead of a steel and concrete structure. The new form corresponds with that of the historic water tank, uses screen-printed glass for the fa\u00e7ades, and connects the two opposing building volumes with a public staircase. The upward sightseeing route provides grand views for visitors of the Yangpu waterfront (Figs. 7 and 15).\n\nFig. 15 Historical water tank vs. renovated observatory (Source: Fangfang Tian) Full size image\n\n3.5 Spatial reordering\n\nThe architects reemphasised the entrance by using steel plates and modernist design language to direct the public path into the twin buildings. New gigantic columns and staircases were added, which expanded the square footage of the second floor, created new circulation and the observatory, and provided shade for the middle pathway. The gigantic columns took their forms from the original octagonal prismatic columns\u2019 deconstructed curves, which constituted the rainwater drainage systems. The exaggerated forms overturned the stereotypical static impression of the warehouses and corresponded to the internal structures, making the middle pathway the building\u2019s focal point. The new parts were built separately from the original structure to ensure the reversibility of the operation (Fig. 16).\n\nFig. 16 Gigantic columns with built-in rainwater drainage system (Source: Archi-Union Architects) Full size image\n\nThrough an atrium and a public staircase in the east wing and the staggered arrangement of its sections, the additions were able to direct the natural light and make Yangpu Bridge\u2019s frame structure visible through the skylight, inviting visitors to ascend.\n\n3.6 Integrating into the urban environment\n\nThe architects indented the exterior walls one column span inwards to expose the original first-floor columns on the south, east and north sides, creating a 6 m wide transitional lounge. This not only showcased the beauty of the historic architecture to the city but also facilitated a pedestrian passage. The design raised the interior floor level to match the existing flood-control walls, creating a linear spatial experience between the interior, the colonnade, and the riverside recreational spaces."}, {"url": "https://taisawards.com/inpage/dawn-landes-434/", "page_content": "Dawn Landes \u2014 Meet Me at the River (August 10, 2018)\n\nDawn Landes \u2014 Meet Me at the River (August 10, 2018)\n\n\u2660 Missouri~born, Louisville, Kentucky~raised singer and songwriter who is also an in~demand sound engineer.

Two years ago, Landes reached out to Foster, and a four~hour visit to his Nashville home convinced both they were musical kindred spirits. With roots in both Louisville, Kentucky, and Branson, Missouri, Landes has been attracting ardent fans and critical acclaim since entering New York\u2019s music scene in 2000. Along the way, she has collaborated with such contemporaries as Sufjan Stevens, Justin Townes Earle, and Norah Jones, creating music for albums, movies, and television that crosses folk, rock, and alternative genres.\n\n\u2022 In Her Words: \u201eI was lucky enough to work with the legendary producer Fred Foster for my new record. Fred has been making hits for most of his 87 years. Merle Haggard once said, 'he lives in the songs.\u2019 He does, he\u2019s there in \u2018Pretty Woman\u2019 and \u2018Me and Bobby McGee\u2019 and Dolly Parton\u2019s first hit, \u2018Dumb Blonde.\u2019 I learned so much working with Fred on this record and I\u2019m really proud of it. Some of my favorite lessons were: * \u2018Keep it conversational.\u2019 If you can speak the lyric and it reads, it\u2019s all the morepowerful. * \u2018A great song can be sung by anyone in any style and any meter.\u2019 He learned this from the great publisher Fred Rose, who sat at a piano and played him Hoagy Carmichael\u2019s \u201eStarlight\u201c in its popular form, then in 3/4 time, then in a Western swing style. They all worked. * \u2018The feel is the thing. If you\u2019re in the wrong tempo you won\u2019t have the feel.\u2019 The drummer Eddie Bayers who played on the album has said that Fred sets the best tempos of anybody. I believe it. We recorded everything in Nashville with the heaviest hitters around: Kyle Lehning, Charlie McCoy, Steve Gibson, Bobby Wood, Eddie Bayers, Russ Pahl, Larry Paxton, Larry Franklin and more.\u201c \u2014 Dawn Landes\n\nAlbums:\n\n\u2660\u2660 dawn\u2019s Music (2005)\n\n\u2660\u2660 Two Three Four (2006)\n\n\u2660\u2660 Fireproof (2008)\n\n\u2660\u2660 Sweetheart Rodeo (2010)\n\n\u2660\u2660 Bluebird (2014)\n\n\u2660\u2660 Meet Me at the River (2018)\n\nEP:\n\n\u2660\u2660 Straight Lines (2005)\n\n\u2660\u2660 Mal Habill\u00e9e (2012)\n\nReview\n\nBy Josh Weinberg, Published Aug 07, 2018. Score: 8\n\n\u2022 Good storytelling and country music are meant to go together. For singer~songwriter Dawn Landes, the results make for one impressive collection on Meet Me at the River. Her teaming with legendary Nashville producer Fred Foster may seem unorthodox, but it works to perfection. Plenty of slide guitar and clap~along beats soundtrack Landes\u2019s beautiful delivery.\n\n\u2022 Landes chronicles a much~needed excursion on \u201eTraveling\u201c \u2014 wanting to see the sun rise over Graceland and explore wherever the road of life takes her. The opening harmonica solo and organ breakdown on \u201eWhy They Name Whiskey After Men\u201c spices up a song comparing men to alcohol (because it\u2019s true, they can both taste good and leave a lot of pain afterwards).\n\n\u2022 Providing backup for Landes on this record is an absolute A~team of musicians, from the stomp~clap rhythm of \u201eKeep On Moving\u201c to an excellent acoustic guitar line to the superb cover of Johnny Driftwood\u2019s \u201eWhat Is the Color of the Soul of a Man.\u201c It\u2019s the closest to blues this record gets, and worth every second.\n\n\u2022 The best example of what this album does, however, is on \u201eWhat Will I Do,\u201c a beautiful song, complete with harmonious backing vocals. A song about pondering risk v. reward, but \u201eonly the moon and stars can know\u201c what is right. It\u2019s clear that Dawn\u2019s songwriting is one of her many strengths, as Meet Me at the River is only too proud to showcase.\n\n\u2022 https://exclaim.ca/\n\nWebsite: http://www.dawnlandes.com\n\nLabel: http://westernvinyl.com/\n\nMySpace: https://myspace.com/dawnlandes\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dawnlandes\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dawnlandes/\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/FunMachineMusic\n\n_____________________________________________________________"}]}
