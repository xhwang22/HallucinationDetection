This video will take you through the close friendships of Alexander the Great and Hephaestion, David and Jonathan and Enkidu and Gilgamesh. These friendships from the Ancient World are all from different geographic regions, with different beliefs and histories, yet are all remembered as famous friendships.\n\n\n\nAlexander the Great, son of Phillip II of Macedon inherited the Macedonian Empire and expanded it into the largest empire his world had seen, and as he did that, his greatest friend and trusted general Hephaestion was by his side. Hephaestion was taught by Aristotle with Alexander in their youth, and then became his second in command until his death.\n\n\n\nThe story of David and Jonathan comes from the bible, with prince Jonathan, the son of King Saul becomes close friends with the shepherd David, the man who killed Goliath. When King Saul became jealous of David, he planned on killing him, but his son Jonathan defied him and kept his friend safe.\n\n\n\nOur final friendship is the wild man of the woods Enkidu, with the civilized and cruel King Gilgamesh, known from the Epic of Gilgamesh. As the oldest epic poem, the Epic of Gilgamesh recounts the friendship of Enkidu and Gilgamesh, who first fight each other and then become friends. They go on adventures, and after the death of Enkidu, Gilgamesh feels as though he has lost his other half and goes on a journey to find the meaning of life, and immortality.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nLicense & Copyright Original video by Ancient History Encyclopedia.

However, some researchers suggest that he also fell in love with at least two men, one of them being Hephaestion, a General in Alexander\u2019s Army.\n\nResearchers cannot make empirical studies to be sure about the thoughts and feelings of the people who lived in the times of Alexander the Great. At most, they can only make deductions from the historical records that are available. All that really exists is a puzzle, which researchers try to interpret and put together.\n\nThe companion of brothers\n\nHephaestion was born, like Alexander, in around 365 BC. He was a son of Amyntor, a noble man of Macedonia. Hephaestion was a friend, companion and a general in the army of Alexander. According to the ancient resources, he had a special bond with the king. He was described as his dearest friend, the person who was witness to the most significant moments in Alexander's life, but also the one with whom the king shared his most personal secrets.\n\nHead of Hephaistion sculpted in marble. Statue is at the Getty Museum in California. ( Public Domain )\n\nAlexander and Hephaestion spent time with each other nearly their whole lives, until the death of Hephaestion in 324 BC. They traveled, fought in battlefields and experienced many adventures together. Alexander is said to have felt a strong bond with him also due to his sensitivity, love of literature and intelligence. When Hephaestion died, Alexander\u2019s life collapsed. As a ruler, he didn't have too many people who he could trust. It seems that he believed in the loyalty his mother Olympias, Hephaestion, and his friend Ptolemy, future pharaoh Ptolemy I Soter. According to some later writings, Alexander felt extreme loneliness after the death of his dear friend, and he himself died just a few months after the burial of Hephaestion.\n\nFriends or Lovers?\n\nThroughout history, the Greek male friendship may be considered somewhat unique. Greek men could love their best friends like brothers and like family, and their way of treating each other could often be misinterpreted.\n\nAt the same time, Ancient Greek military forces (for example, the Spartans), believed that homosexual sex made bonds between the soldiers stronger. This same-sex interaction was a very popular topic to many ancient authors. The great philosopher Plato in his work Symposium wrote that the interlocutor Phaedrus made a comment on the importance of sexual relationships between men, which improves the brotherhood and bravery on the battlefield. Many researchers interpreted his interest in this topic as confirmation that he was in such a relationship with Socrates, although there is no evidence to support this theory.\n\nThe Warren Cup, portraying a mature bearded man and a youth on its \"Greek\" side ( Public Domain )\n\nAccording to the Paul Cartledge, a Professor of Greek History in the University of Cambridge, who described his theory of Alexander the Great: The Hunt for a New Past:\n\n''The question of Alexander's sexuality--his predominant sexual orientation--has enlivened, or bedeviled, much Alexander scholarship. That he loved at least two men there can be little doubt. The first was the Macedonian noble Hephaestion, a friend from boyhood, whom he looked on--and may actually have referred to--as his alter ego. The Persian queen mother, it was said, once mistook the taller Hephaestion for Alexander, who graciously excused her blushes by murmuring that 'he too is Alexander'. Whether Alexander's relationship with the slightly older Hephaestion was ever of the sort that once dared not speak its name is not certain, but it is likely enough that it was. At any rate, Macedonian and Greek mores would have favored an actively sexual component rather than inhibiting or censoring it. Like hunting, homosexuality was thought to foster masculine, especially martial, bravery.''\n\nIf we follow this way of thinking, there was at least one more man who could have been the male lover of Alexander. His name was Bagoas and he was a Persian eunuch. However, it is impossible to really know the truth of their relationship as there is no direct information about the sexual preferences of Alexander.\n\n'Bagoas pleads on behalf of Nabarzanes' ( Public Domain )\n\nSearching for the truth\n\nHomosexuality was a norm in the ancient times, but in the case of Alexander the Great and Hephaestion, it is hard to rationally conclude what the true relationship was between them. Even if they were lovers, the beliefs and perceptions about homosexual relationships was definitely different than the way it is considered today. However, the author of this article doubts the theory that Alexander and Hephaestion were in a romantic relationship.\n\nThe weddings at Susa; Alexander to Stateira (right), and Hephaestion to Drypetis (left).

Currently it is suggested that the Amphipolis tomb could have been built in memory of Hephaestion. It is also possible that the ashes of the great friend of Alexander were brought there from the desert in Persia. The answer to the question of what was between Alexander and Hephaestion remains buried in their graves.\n\nTop image: A painting by Charles Le Brun depicting Alexander and Hephaestion (in red cloak), facing Porus, during the Battle of the Hydaspes.

McIntosh\n\nPublic Historian\n\nBrewminate\n\nIntroduction\n\nHephaestion (c.356 BCE \u2013 October 324 BCE), son of Amyntor, was an ancient Macedonian nobleman and a general in the army of Alexander the Great. He was \u201cby far the dearest of all the king\u2019s friends; he had been brought up with Alexander and shared all his secrets.\u201d[3] This relationship lasted throughout their lives, and was compared, by others as well as themselves, to that of Achilles and Patroclus.\n\nHis military career was distinguished. A member of Alexander the Great\u2019s personal bodyguard, he went on to command the Companion cavalry and was entrusted with many other tasks throughout Alexander\u2019s ten-year campaign in Asia, including diplomatic missions, the bridging of major rivers, sieges and the foundation of new settlements. Besides being a soldier, engineer and diplomat, he corresponded with the philosophers Aristotle and Xenocrates and actively supported Alexander in his attempts to integrate the Greeks and Persians. Alexander formally made him his second-in-command when he appointed him Chiliarch of the empire. Alexander also made him part of the royal family when he gave him as his bride Drypetis, sister to his own second wife Stateira, both daughters of Darius III of Persia.\n\nWhen he died suddenly at Ecbatana[4] around age thirty-two, Alexander was overwhelmed with grief. He petitioned the oracle at Siwa to grant Hephaestion divine status and thus Hephaestion was honoured as a Divine Hero. Hephaestion was cremated and his ashes taken to Babylon.[5] At the time of his own death a mere eight months later, Alexander was still planning lasting monuments to Hephaestion\u2019s memory.\n\nYouth and Education\n\nThe emblema of the Stag Hunt Mosaic, c. 300 BC, from Pella; the figure on the right is possibly Alexander the Great due to the date of the mosaic, along with the depicted upsweep of his centrally-parted hair (anastole); the figure on the left wielding a double-edged axe (associated with Hephaistos) is perhaps Hephaestion. / Photo via Wikimedia Commons\n\nHephaestion\u2019s exact age is not known. No concise biography has ever been written about him, likely stemming from the fact that he died before Alexander and none of those among Alexander\u2019s companions who survived him would have had a need to promote someone other than themselves. Many scholars cite Hephaestion\u2019s age as being similar to Alexander\u2019s so it is fair to assume that he was born about 356 BC. He is said to have become a page in 343 BC, a role common to adolescent boys of the aristocratic class in Macedon.[7] As a member of the court, he may have met Alexander around this time.\n\nThe only surviving anecdote from Hephaestion\u2019s youth comes courtesy of the Alexander Romance. According to this tale, \u201cone day when Alexander was 15 years old \u2026 sailing with Hephaestion, his friend, he easily reached Pisa \u2026 and he went off to stroll with Hephaestion.\u201d[8] That Alexander\u2019s exact age is given provides another clue to Hephaestion\u2019s upbringing because at fifteen Alexander and his companions were at Mieza studying under Aristotle.[9] Hephaestion has never been named among those who attended the lectures at Mieza, but his close friendship with Alexander at that age suggests strongly that he was numbered among them. More telling is Hephaestion\u2019s name being found in a catalogue of Aristotle\u2019s correspondences.[10] The letters themselves no longer exist, but for them to have found their way into an official catalogue, their content must have been of some significance. It implies that Hephaestion received a good education and shows that Aristotle was impressed enough by his alleged pupil to send letters throughout Alexander\u2019s expanding empire to converse with him.\n\nA few years after the lectures at Mieza, Hephaestion\u2019s presence was notably absent when several of Alexander\u2019s close friends were exiled as a result of the Pixodarus affair. Among those exiled by Philip II after Alexander\u2019s failed attempt to offer himself as groom to the Carian princess were Ptolemy, Nearchus, Harpalus, Erigyius and Laomedon.[11] The reason for Hephaestion\u2019s absence from this list could be the fact that all of the exiled men were older friends of Alexander, Erigyius himself roughly 24 years older than the prince.[12] Hephaestion was a contemporary of Alexander and it is likely that his influence might have been seen as less of a threat than these more mature companions. Whatever Hephaestion\u2019s opinion had been on the whole affair, like many of Alexander\u2019s other childhood companions he was not exiled in its aftermath.\n\nWhile it is true that very little detail of Hephaestion\u2019s childhood and education can be found, that which remains gives credence to what is known about his later life. His friendship with Alexander was long-lasting, as was his tenure in the court at Pella; he even shared the same education as the future Great King of Greece and Asia. With such a promising start, age and experience would have helped mould Hephaestion Amyntoros into the man who would one day be the second most powerful man in Alexander\u2019s empire, second only to the king himself.\n\nCareer\n\nOverview\n\nSharing Alexander\u2019s upbringing, Hephaestion would have learned to fight and to ride well from an early age. His first taste of military action was probably the campaign against the Thracians while Alexander was regent, followed by Philip II\u2019s Danube campaign (342 BC) and the battle of Chaeronea (338 BC) while he was still in his teens. His name is not mentioned in lists of high-ranking officers during the early battles of Alexander\u2019s Danube campaign (335 BC) or the invasion of Persia. Nor are the names of Alexander\u2019s other close friends and contemporaries listed, suggesting that their promotions, when they achieved them, were earned by merit.\n\nWars in Persia\n\nThe Battle of Issus by Albrecht Altdorfer, 1529. / Photo courtesy Alte Pinakothek, Wikimedia Commons\n\nHephaestion\u2019s career was never solely a military one. Right from the start he was also engaged in special missions, sometimes diplomatic, sometimes technical. The first mention of his career in the sources is a diplomatic mission of some importance. After the battle of Issus (333 BC) when Alexander was proceeding south down the Phoenician coast and had received the capitulation of Sidon, Hephaestion was \u201cauthorised to appoint to the throne the Sidonian he considered most deserving of that high office\u201d.[13] Hephaestion took local advice and chose a man distantly related to the royal family, but whose honesty had reduced him to working as a gardener. The man, Abdalonymus, had a successful royal career, fully justifying Hephaestion\u2019s choice.\n\nAfter the siege of Tyre (332 BC) Alexander entrusted his fleet to Hephaestion, who had orders to skirt the coast and head for Gaza, their next objective, while Alexander himself led the army overland.[14] Hephaestion\u2019s task was not an easy one for this was not the Athenian fleet with which Alexander had started and had earlier disbanded, but a motley collection of semi-reluctant allies of many nationalities who would need holding together with patience and strength. Furthermore, on arrival at Gaza the cargo of siege engines had to be unloaded, transported across difficult terrain and reassembled.\n\nPlutarch, while writing about Alexander\u2019s correspondence, reveals an occasion when Hephaestion was away on business and Alexander wrote to him. The subject matter suggests that this took place while they were in Egypt. What business Hephaestion was attending to we do not know, but Andrew Chugg[15] has suggested that it was concerned either with his command of the fleet or Athenian diplomacy. He quotes sources which suggest that Hephaestion had been approached by Aristion of Athens to effect a reconciliation between Alexander and Demosthenes and, certainly, Athens\u2019 inaction during the revolt of the Spartan king Agis would seem to support this idea. As Chugg says, \u201cIf he did persuade Alexander to reach an accommodation with Demosthenes at this critical juncture, as would seem likely from the circumstances, then he was significantly responsible for saving the situation for Macedon in Greece by preventing the revolt of Agis spreading to Athens and her allies.\u201d[15]\n\nIt is likely, though not certain, that it was Hephaestion who led the advance army from Egypt to bridge the Euphrates river. Darius of Persia sent Mazaeus to hold the opposite bank while the bridging work was in progress. This Mazaeus was the commander who threw away what looked like certain victory on the Persian right at the battle of Gaugamela (331 BC) and later became Alexander\u2019s governor of Babylon. Robin Lane Fox has suggested that a conversation with Hephaestion may have won Mazaeus over: \u201cIt is conceivable that the battle of Gaugamela was partly won on the banks of the Euphrates and that Mazaeus\u2019 reinstatement was less a sign of magnanimity than of a prearranged reward.\u201d[16]\n\nIt is at Gaugamela that mention is first made of Hephaestion\u2019s rank. He is called the \u201ccommander of the bodyguards (somatophylakes)\u201d.[17] This is not the Royal Squadron, whose duties also included guarding the king in battle and which was at that time commanded by Cleitus\u2014a man of the older generation\u2014but a small group of close companions specifically designated to fight alongside the king. Hephaestion was certainly in the thick of things with Alexander for Arrian tells us he was wounded and Curtius specifically mentions that it was a spear wound in the arm.[18][19]\n\nAfter Gaugamela there is the first indication that Alexander intended reconciliation with the Persians and that Hephaestion supported him in this unpopular policy. One evening in Babylon Alexander noticed a high-born woman obliged to dance as part of the entertainment. Curtius explains: \u201cThe following day, he (Alexander) instructed Hephaestion to have all the prisoners brought to the royal quarters and there he verified the lineage of each of them.\u201d[20] Alexander had realized that people from noble families were being treated with little dignity and wanted to do something about it. That he chose Hephaestion to help him shows that he could rely on Hephaestion\u2019s tact and sympathy. Yet Alexander could also rely on Hephaestion for firmness and resolve. When his policies had led to a plot against his life, the possible involvement of a senior officer, Philotas, caused much concern. It was Hephaestion, along with Craterus and Coenus, who insisted on, and actually carried out, the customary torture.[21]\n\nAfter the execution of Philotas (330 BC), Hephaestion was appointed joint commander\u2014with Cleitus\u2014of the Companion cavalry, Philotas\u2019 former position. This dual appointment was a way of satisfying two divergent shades of opinion now hardening throughout the army: one, like Hephaestion, broadly supportive of Alexander\u2019s policy of integration, and the other, that of Philip\u2019s older veterans in particular, whose implacable resentment of Persian ways was well represented by Cleitus.[22] The cavalry prospered under this command, showing itself equal to learning new tactics necessary against Scythian nomads and to counter-insurgency measures such as those deployed in the spring of 328 BC. The army set out from Balkh in five columns to spread through the valleys between the Oxus and Tanais rivers to pacify Sogdiana. Hephaestion commanded one of the columns and, after arriving at Marakanda, he set out again to establish settlements in the region.[23]\n\nExpedition into India\n\nA painting by Charles Le Brun depicting Alexander and Hephaestion (in red cloak), facing Porus, during the Battle of the Hydaspes. / Photo courtesy The Pipe Organ Project, Wikimedia Commons\n\nIn spring 327 BC the army headed into India and Alexander divided his forces. He led his section north into the Swat Valley, while Hephaestion and Perdiccas took a sizeable contingent through the Khyber Pass. Hephaestion\u2019s orders were to \u201ctake over either by force or agreement all places on their march and upon reaching the Indus to make suitable preparations for crossing\u201d.[24] They were in unknown territory, whose political and geographical landscapes were unfamiliar, and Hephaestion would have had to make decisions on the spot and act accordingly. He reached the Indus with the land behind him conquered, including the successful siege of Peuceolatis, which took thirty days, and proceeded to organize the construction of boats for the crossing.[25]\n\nAlexander often had to divide his forces and command was given to a variety of senior officers on different occasions. For example, a few weeks before this mission of Hephaestion\u2019s, Craterus had been sent with a large force to subdue the last two remaining Bactrian rebels.[26] It seems that Hephaestion was chosen when the objectives were far from clear-cut, and Alexander needed a commander on whom he could rely to do what he would have done himself without needing instructions.\n\nHephaestion took part in a notable cavalry charge at the battle of the Hydaspes river (326 BC).[27] Then when the army began its homeward journey he was again entrusted with half the army, including the elite troops and two hundred elephants, as they travelled south-west along the banks of the Hydaspes.[28] Some of the army, including Alexander himself, travelled in boats which had been provided by the sponsorship of leading courtiers. Arrian lists Hephaestion first among these \u201chonorary trierarchs\u201d, indicating his leading position at this time.[29] On entering hostile territory Alexander split his forces into three. Hephaestion\u2019s section marched \u201cfive days in advance, with the object of intercepting and capturing any native troops which \u2026 might be rapidly moving forward\u201d.[30] Again, Hephaestion was called upon when initiative was required. After Alexander had taken a detour to subdue a hostile tribe, in which he was seriously injured, Hephaestion took command of the greater part of the army as they travelled down the Indus to the sea.[31] At the coast he organized the construction of a fortress and a harbour for the fleet at Pattala.[32]\n\nHephaestion was in command at Pattala while Alexander advanced. When he rejoined Alexander at Rhambacia he established a city there also.[33] Hephaestion crossed the Gedrosian desert with Alexander, sharing the torments of that journey and, when the army was safely back in Susa, he was decorated for bravery.[34] He was to take part in no further fighting; he had only months to live. But, having ended his military career as Alexander\u2019s de facto second-in-command, he was also his second in the political sphere. Alexander had made that official by naming him Chiliarch. Photius mentions Perdiccas being appointed \u201cto command the chiliarchy which Hephaestion had originally held\u201d.[35]\n\nRelationships\n\nAlexander\n\nThe family of Darius in front of Alexander with Hephaestion behind him, by Justus Sustermans and preserved in the Biblioteca Museu V\u00edctor Balaguer. In this picture we can see Hephaestion point out Alexander. / Photo courtesy Biblioteca Museu V\u00edctor Balaguer, Wikimedia Commons\n\nLittle is known of Hephaestion\u2019s personal relationships beyond his close friendship with Alexander. Alexander was an outgoing, charismatic man who had many friends but his dearest and closest friend and confidant was Hephaestion.[3] Theirs was a friendship which had been forged in boyhood. It endured through adolescence, through Alexander\u2019s becoming king, and through the hardships of campaigning and the flatteries of court life and their marriages.\n\nTheir tutor Aristotle described friendship in general as \u201cone soul abiding in two bodies\u201d.[36] That they themselves considered their friendship to be of such a kind is shown by the stories of the morning after the Battle of Issus. Diodorus,[37] Arrian[38] and Curtius[39] all describe the scene when Alexander and Hephaestion went together to visit the captured Persian royal family. Its senior member, the queen Sisygambis, knelt to Hephaestion to plead for their lives, having mistaken him for Alexander because he was taller, and both young men were wearing similar clothes. When she realized her mistake she was acutely embarrassed, but Alexander pardoned her, saying \u201cYou were not mistaken, Mother; this man too is Alexander.\u201d[39] Their affection for each other was no secret, as is borne out by their own words. Hephaestion, when replying to a letter to Alexander\u2019s mother, Olympias, said \u201cyou know that Alexander means more to us than anything\u201d.[40] Arrian says that Alexander, after Hephaestion\u2019s death, described him as \u201cthe friend I valued as my own life\u201d.[41] Paul Cartledge describes their closeness when he says: \u201cAlexander seems actually to have referred to Hephaestion as his alter ego.\u201d[42]\n\nAside from their strong personal bond, theirs was also a working partnership in that all that Alexander undertook, Hephaestion was at his side. It is possible to discern a pattern, when studying Hephaestion\u2019s career, of Alexander\u2019s constant trust in, and increasing reliance on, Hephaestion. By the time of the advance into India, after the deaths of senior generals from the older generation, there had been worrying instances among senior officers of their own generation of treachery,[43] a lack of sympathy with Alexander\u2019s aims of further integration of Persians into the army,[44] and of sheer incompetence.[45] Time after time, when Alexander needed to divide his forces he entrusted half to Hephaestion, knowing that in him he had a man of unquestionable loyalty who understood and sympathized with his aims and, above all, who got the job done.\n\nHephaestion played a full part in Alexander\u2019s regular consultations with senior officers, but he was the one to whom Alexander would also talk in private, sharing his thoughts, hopes, and plans. Curtius states that Hephaestion was the sharer of all his secrets;[46] and Plutarch describes an occasion when Alexander had a controversial change to impose and implies that Hephaestion was the one with whom Alexander discussed it and who arranged for the change to be implemented.[47] According to the painting done by Aetion of Alexander\u2019s first wedding, Hephaestion was his torch-bearer (best man), showing by this not only his friendship, but also his support for Alexander\u2019s policies as Alexander\u2019s choice of an Asian bride had not been a popular one among the Macedonians.\n\nBy the time they returned to Persia, Hephaestion was officially, by title, Alexander\u2019s second-in-command, as he had long been in practice, and also his brother-in-law. Hammond sums up their public relationship as follows: \u201cIt is not surprising that Alexander was as closely attached to Hephaestion as Achilles was to Patroclus\u201d,[48] and \u201cAt the time of his death Hephaestion held the highest single command, that of the Companion Cavalry; and had been repeatedly second in command to Alexander in the hierarchy of the Asian court, holding the title of Chiliarch, which had been held by Nabarzanes under Darius. Thus Alexander honoured Hephaestion both as the closest of his friends and the most distinguished of his Field Marshals.\u201d[49]\n\nBusts of Alexander (left) and Hephaestion (right). / Photo courtesy Getty Museum, Wikimedia Commons\n\nIt has been suggested by some modern scholars that as well as being close friends Alexander and Hephaestion were also lovers, though hardly any of Alexander\u2019s extant ancient Greek or Roman biographers ever refers to Hephaestion as anything but Alexander\u2019s friend,[51][52] consistent with Hephaestion\u2019s epithet \u201cPhilalexandros\u201d which was given to him by Alexander himself.[53] It has been observed, however, that the ancient Greek word for friend \u201c\u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2\u201d (Philos) was also applied to lovers in the homo-erotic or sexual sense. [54]\n\nFurthermore, Arrian and Plutarch describe the occasion when Alexander and Hephaestion publicly identified themselves with the Homeric figures of Achilles and Patroclus. At the onset of the campaign in Asia, Alexander led a contingent of the army to visit Troy, scene of the events in his beloved Iliad. He encircled the tomb of Achilles with a garland and Hephaestion did the same with the tomb of Patroclus,[55] and they ran a race, naked, to honour their dead heroes.[56] Arrian and Plutarch draw no conclusions from this; however, according to Thomas R. Martin and Christopher W. Blackwell, by no means does the identification of Alexander and Hephaestion with Achilles and Patroclus equate to their being in a homosexual relationship as Homer, author of the Iliad, never suggested that Achilles and Patroclus had sexual relations. Martin and Blackwell further suggest this concept was theorized by unspecified \u201clater authors\u201d,[51] who include, however, such eminent writers as Aeschylus[57] and Plato[58] that had lived before Alexander and Hephaestion\u2019s time. Attic orator Aeschines, who was contemporary with them (albeit somewhat older), explicitly addressed the question in these terms: \u201c\u2026Homer, though he often speaks of Patroclus and Achilles, is silent about love and gives no name to their friendship; he thinks that the remarkable strength of their affection is obvious to the cultivated among his audience.\u201d[59] Thus, according to Robin Lane Fox quite different conclusions can be drawn from Martin and Blackwell\u2019s: \u201cIt was a remarkable tribute, uniquely paid, and it is also Hephaestion\u2019s first mention in Alexander\u2019s career. Already the two were intimate, Patroclus and Achilles even to those around them; the comparison would remain to the end of their days and is proof of their life as lovers, for by Alexander\u2019s time, Achilles and Patroclus were agreed to have enjoyed the relationship which Homer himself had never directly mentioned.\u201d[60]\n\nHephaestion and Alexander grew up in a time in which, according to Thomas R. Martin and Christopher W. Blackwell, homosexual affairs were seen as abnormal by majority Greek standards of htheir time.[51] But Andrew Chugg, Robin Lane Fox and others[61] show different views. According to Eva Cantarella, male bisexuality was widely permitted and ruled by law, and generally not frowned upon by the public to the extent to which it remained within the preset limits. For the Greeks \u201chomosexuality was not an exclusive choice. Loving another man was not an option out of the norm, different, somehow deviant. It was just a part of life experience; it was the show of an either sentimental or sexual drive that, over a lifetime, alternated and was associated (sometimes at the very same time) with love for a woman\u201d.[62] The pattern that same-sex love affairs followed, however, was not the same in every city-state. Some Roman and later writers, taking the Athenian pattern as their example, have tended to assume either that Alexander and Hephaestion had a sexual relationship which belonged to their adolescence, after which they left it behind, or that one of them was older, the lover (erastes), and the other was the beloved (eromenos).\n\nThe former assumption has persisted to the present day, with writers of fiction such as Mary Renault and the film director Oliver Stone among its proponents, as well as modern historians such as Paul Cartledge, who says: \u201cRumour had it\u2014and rumour was for once surely correct\u2014that he [Hephaestion] and Alexander had once been more than just good friends.\u201d[63] Aelian takes the latter view when he uses just such an expression when describing the visit to Troy: \u201cAlexander laid a garland on Achilles\u2019 tomb and Hephaestion on Patroclus\u2019, indicating that he was Alexander\u2019s eromenos, as Patroclus was of Achilles.\u201d[64]\n\nHowever, what was the case in Athens was not necessarily the case in Macedon. As Robin Lane Fox says, \u201cdescendants of the Dorians were considered and even expected to be openly homosexual, especially among their ruling class, and the Macedonian kings had long insisted on their pure Dorian ancestry\u201d.[65] This was no fashionable affectation; this was something that belonged at the heart of what it was to be Dorian, and therefore Macedonian, and had more in common with the Theban Sacred Band than with Athens.[66] Lucian, writing in his book On Slips of the Tongue, describes an occasion when Hephaestion\u2019s conversation one morning implied that he had been in Alexander\u2019s tent all night,[67] and Plutarch describes the intimacy between them when he tells how Hephaestion was in the habit of reading Alexander\u2019s letters with him, and of a time when he showed that the contents of a letter were to be kept secret by touching his ring to Hephaestion\u2019s lips.[68] There also exists a letter, spuriously attributed to Diogenes of Sinope, heavily hinting at Alexander\u2019s yielding to \u201cHephaestion\u2019s thighs\u201d.[69]\n\nNo other circumstance shows better the nature and length of their relationship than Alexander\u2019s overwhelming grief at Hephaestion\u2019s death. As Andrew Chugg says, \u201cit is surely incredible that Alexander\u2019s reaction to Hephaestion\u2019s death could indicate anything other than the closest relationship imaginable\u201d.[70] The many and varied ways, both spontaneous and planned, by which Alexander poured out his grief are detailed below. In the context of the nature of their relationship however, one stands out as remarkable. Arrian says that Alexander \u201cflung himself on the body of his friend and lay there nearly all day long in tears, and refused to be parted from him until he was dragged away by force by his Companions\u201d.[71]\n\nOthers\n\nThe weddings at Susa; Alexander to Stateira (right), and Hephaestion to Drypetis (left). Late 19th-century engraving. / Photo via Wikimedia Commons\n\nAmong Alexander\u2019s other officers, it is possible that Hephaestion was closest to Perdiccas, because it was with Perdiccas that he went on the mission to take Peuceolatis and bridge the Indus. By that time, as Alexander\u2019s effective second-in-command, he could doubtless have chosen any officer he cared to name.[72] They accomplished everything they set out to do with great success, which indicates that the two of them worked well together, and that Hephaestion found the irrepressible Perdiccas a congenial companion. It is notable that their two cavalry regiments in particular were selected by Alexander for the dangerous crossing of the river Hydaspes before the battle with the Indian king, Porus. On that occasion superb teamwork would have been of paramount importance.[73]\n\nHowever, outside the close-knit coterie of the Macedonian high command, he was not universally admired. This is clear from Arrian\u2019s comment about Alexander\u2019s grief: \u201cAll writers have agreed that it was great, but personal prejudice, for or against both Hephaestion and Alexander himself, has coloured the accounts of how he expressed it.\u201d[74]\n\nYet given the factions and jealousies that arise in any court and that Hephaestion was supremely close to the greatest monarch the Western world had yet seen, it is remarkable how little enmity he inspired. Arrian[75] mentions a quarrel with Alexander\u2019s secretary Eumenes but, because of a missing page in the text, the greater part of the detail is missing, leaving only the conclusion that something persuaded Hephaestion, though against his will, to make up the quarrel. However, Plutarch, who wrote about Eumenes in his series of Parallel Lives,[76] mentions that it was about lodgings and a flute-player, so perhaps this was an instance of some deeper antagonism breaking out into a quarrel over a triviality. What that antagonism might have been, it is not possible to know, but someone with the closeness to the king of a secretary might well have felt some jealousy for Hephaestion\u2019s even greater closeness.\n\nIn only one instance is Hephaestion known to have quarrelled with a fellow officer and that was with Craterus. In this instance it is easier to see that resentment might have been felt on both sides, for Craterus was one of those officers who vehemently disliked Alexander\u2019s policy of integrating Greek and Persian, whereas Hephaestion was very much in favour. Plutarch tells the story: \u201cFor this reason a feeling of hostility grew and festered between the two and they often came into open conflict. Once on the expedition to India they actually drew their swords and came to blows \u2026\u201d[77] Alexander, who also valued Craterus highly as a most competent officer, was forced to intervene and had stern words for both. It is a measure of how high feelings were running over this contentious issue that such a thing should have happened and also an indication of how closely Hephaestion identified Alexander\u2019s wishes with his own. Hephaestion gave perhaps the ultimate proof of this in the summer of 324 BC, when he accepted as his wife Drypetis, daughter of Darius and sister to Alexander\u2019s own second wife Stateira.[2] Of his short married life nothing is known, except that at the time of Alexander\u2019s own death, eight months after Hephaestion\u2019s, Drypetis was still mourning the husband to whom she had been married for only four months.[78]\n\nFor Alexander to marry a daughter of Darius made good political sense, allying himself firmly with the Persian ruling class, but for Hephaestion to marry her sister shows the high esteem in which Alexander held him, bringing him into the royal family itself. They became brothers-in-law, and yet there was more to it than that. Arrian says that Alexander \u201cwanted to be uncle to Hephaestion\u2019s children\u201d.[79] Thus it is possible to imagine Alexander and Hephaestion hoping that their respective offspring might unite their lines and that, ultimately, the crown of Macedon and Persia might be worn by one who was a descendant of them both.[79]\n\nDeath and Funeral\n\nDeath\n\nIn spring 324 BC Hephaestion left Susa, where he had been married, and accompanied Alexander and the rest of the army as they travelled towards Ecbatana. They arrived in the autumn and it was there, during games and festivals, that Hephaestion fell ill with a fever. Arrian says that after the fever had run for seven days, Alexander had to be summoned from the games to Hephaestion, who was seriously ill. He did not arrive in time; by the time he got there, Hephaestion was dead.[80] Plutarch says that being a young man and a soldier, Hephaestion had ignored medical advice: As soon as his doctor, Glaucias, had gone off to the theatre, he ate a large breakfast, consisting of a boiled fowl and a cooler of wine, and then fell sick and died.[81]\n\nPiecing the accounts together, it seems as if Hephaestion\u2019s fever had run its course for seven days, after which time he was sufficiently recovered for his doctor, and Alexander himself, to feel it was safe to leave him, and for Hephaestion to feel hungry. His meal, however, seems to have caused a relapse that led to his rapid death. Precisely why this should have happened is not known. As Mary Renault says, \u201cThis sudden crisis in a young, convalescent man is hard to account for.\u201d[82] The explanation that fits most of the facts is that the fever was typhoid and that solid food perforated the ulcerated intestine that the typhoid would have caused. This would have led to internal bleeding, though it would be unusual in that case for death to follow quite as swiftly as it seems to have done here. For that reason, it is not possible altogether to discount other possible explanations, one of them being poison.\n\nFollowing Hephaestion\u2019s death his body was cremated and the ashes were taken to Babylon.[83][84] The general Eumenes suggested that divine honors be given to Hephaestion; this was later done.[84]\n\nHephaestion\u2019s death is dealt with at greater length by the ancient sources than any of the events of his life, because of its profound effect upon Alexander. Plutarch says that \u201cAlexander\u2019s grief was uncontrollable\u201d and adds that he ordered many signs of mourning, notably that the manes and tails of all horses should be shorn, the demolition of the battlements of the neighbouring cities and the banning of flutes and every other kind of music.[85] Besides the account reported in a previous section about the immediate manifestations of despair by Alexander on his friend\u2019s body, Arrian also relates that \u201cuntil the third day after Hephaestion\u2019s death, Alexander neither tasted food nor paid any attention to his personal appearance, but lay on the ground either bewailing or silently mourning,\u201d and that he had the doctor, Glaucias, hanged for his lack of care.[86] Arrian also mentions Alexander ordering the shrine of Asclepios in Ecbatana to be razed to the ground,[87] and that he cut his hair short in mourning,[88] this last a poignant reminder of Achilles\u2019 last gift to Patroclus on his funeral pyre:Thus o\u2019er Patroclus while the hero prayed,on his cold hand the sacred lock he laid.Once more afresh the Grecian sorrows flow:And now the sun had set upon their woe.[89]\n\nAnother hint that Alexander looked to Achilles to help him to express his grief may be found in the campaign, shortly following these events, against a tribe called the Cossaeans. Plutarch says they were massacred as an offering to the spirit of Hephaestion, and it is quite possible to imagine that to Alexander this might have followed in spirit with Achilles\u2019 killing of \u201ctwelve high-born youths\u201d beside Patroclus\u2019 funeral pyre.[85]\n\nAlexander ordered a period of mourning throughout the empire and \u201cmany of the Companions, out of respect for Alexander, dedicated themselves and their arms to the dead man\u201d.[90] The army, too, remembered him; Alexander did not appoint anyone to take Hephaestion\u2019s place as commander of the Companion cavalry; he \u201cwished Hephaestion\u2019s name to be preserved always in connection with it, so Hephaestion\u2019s Regiment it continued to be called, and Hephaestion\u2019s image continued to be carried before it\u201d.[91]\n\nMessengers were sent to the oracle at Siwa to ask if Amon would permit Hephaestion to be worshipped as a god. When the reply came saying he might be worshipped not as a god, but as a divine hero, Alexander was pleased and \u201cfrom that day forward saw that his friend was honoured with a hero\u2019s rites\u201d.[92] He saw to it that shrines were erected to Hephaestion\u2019s memory, and evidence that the cult took hold can be found in a simple votary plaque now in Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki, inscribed, \u201cTo the Hero Hephaestion\u201d.[93][94]\n\nFuneral\n\nHephaestion was given a magnificent funeral. Its cost is variously given in the sources as 10,000 talents or 12,000 talents, about $200,000,000 or $ 240,000,000 in the early 21st century\u2019s money.[95] Alexander himself drove the funeral carriage part of the way back to Babylon with some of the driving entrusted to Hephaestion\u2019s friend Perdiccas.[87] At Babylon, funeral games were held in Hephaestion\u2019s honour. The contests ranged from literature to athletics and 3,000 competitors took part, the festival eclipsing anything that had gone before both in cost and in numbers taking part.[96] Plutarch says that Alexander planned to spend ten thousand talents on the funeral and the tomb. He employed Stasicrates, \u201cas this artist was famous for his innovations, which combined an exceptional degree of magnificence, audacity and ostentation\u201d, to design the pyre for Hephaestion.[97]\n\nThe pyre was sixty metres high, square in shape and built in stepped levels. The first level was decorated with two hundred and forty ships with golden prows, each of these adorned with armed figures with red banners filling the spaces between. On the second level were torches with snakes at the base, golden wreaths in the middle and at the top, flames surmounted by eagles. The third level showed a hunting scene, and the fourth a battle of centaurs, all done in gold. On the fifth level, also in gold, were lions and bulls, and on the sixth the arms of Macedon and Persia. The seventh and final level bore sculptures of sirens, hollowed out to conceal a choir who would sing a lament.[98] It is possible that the pyre was not burnt, but that it was actually intended as a tomb or lasting memorial; if so, it is likely that it was never completed, as there are references to expensive, uncompleted projects at the time of Alexander\u2019s own death.[99]\n\nOne final tribute remained, and it is compelling in its simplicity and in what it reveals about the high esteem in which Hephaestion was held by Alexander. On the day of the funeral, he gave orders that the sacred flame in the temple should be extinguished. Normally, this was only done on the death of the Great King himself.[100]\n\nBased on a monogram found in the Amphipolis Tomb in northern Greece, the lead archaeologist, Katerina Peristeri, claims that the whole tumulus was a funerary monument for Hephaestion, built between 325\u2013300 BC.[101]\n\nAppendix\n\nEndnotes\n\nBibliography\n\nOriginally published by Wikipedia, 03.30.2003, under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nComments\n\ncomments"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/characters/69674-hephaestion", "page_content": "\n\nHis military career was distinguished.

But it seems neither likely nor unlikely, but quite possible.\n\nIt seems as if many would like to get an answer that either gives the most intimate biographical details about the bedroom behaviour of two concrete ancient persons that are dead for over 2300 years while information on both were quickly enshrouded in myths. Or an answer that simplifies things to \"yeah, those Greeks did that, typical\".\n\nBut for the latter case we should observe that Athens had different customs than Sparta or Thebes or Macedon, and those could change according to fashion. And the analysis of former case is hampered precisely because the story of Alexander was much more prone to be distorted because of his fame.\n\nWe cannot know for sure when looking at biographies of both party involved. But we can look at the circumstantial data of Greek/Macedon society. The sexual behaviour reported for Alexander's father Philipp may be more directly trustworthy than anything relayed to for Alexander. And Philipp was infamous in antiquity for having had a ferocious appetite in all directions.\n\nThe first thing to observe is that our concept of homosexuality is very different from how the Greeks classified sexual behaviour between for example erastes\u2013eromenos. This ranged from something described as ritualised pederasty with clear age-limits (or, well, beard growing limits?) to genuine partnership as seen in the Sacred Band of Thebes with no such limits in age or directions of activity .\n\nThe next important clue is the specifity with which Diogenes alludes to \"thighs\", as in such relationships the vase paintings we have primarily show us intercrural copulation. What he might have meant by that, exactly, is object of speculation, of course. But there are a few possibilities hinted at.\n\nWe must remember the two of them had been friends at least nineteen years, if we accept Mieza as a terminus ante quem for their meeting. During much of this, they would have lived in close quarters on campaign and no doubt seen one another daily when not away on independent missions. Nineteen years is longer than many modern marriages. In terms of affectional attachment, Hephaistion \u2014 not any of Alexander's three wives \u2014 was the king's life partner. Whatever the truth of any sexual involvement, their emotional attachment has never been seriously questioned. No doubt as teenagers, both had learned from Aristotle some version of what he would later write in his Nikomachean Ethics-that perfect love was the highest friendship (1156b), and that friendship was a state of being, not a feeling (1157b). Moreover, Aristotle speaks of the friend as the 'second self (117ob) and indicates that there is only one special friend (1171a).\n\nThus, given the evidence for same-age homoerotic affairs in Macedonia and the weight of circumstantial testimony \u2013 even if it violates Dover's model \u2013 I do think it quite possible that Alexander and Hephaistion were physically intimate at some point. I do not necessarily think, however, that they were still physically intimate in their later years, though they may have been. Mostly, I don't think it greatly significant to the affection they held for one another.\n\nWhile they may indeed have been lovers, I think it reductive to characterize their relationship solely in this way. Nussbaum (1986: 354) contrasts Greek philia with modern concepts of friendship and says that philia 'includes the vel)' strongest affective relationships that human beings form\u2026 English 'love' seems more appropriately wide\u00ad ranging.'60 Greek philia could include a sexual component but extended far beyond that.Similarly, and though speaking of Achilles and Patrokios, Van Nortwick (1995: 17\u00ad 18) offers an observation it would do us well to keep in mind:\n\nWe need to be careful not to misunderstand this intimacy\u2026 Friendship in general is a difficult relationship to fix. Seen in our modern cultures as existing on the boundaries of other bonds, familial or sexual, which provide the categories through which friendship itself is defined. The poems we will read here offer another model for friendship, one accommodating a greater degree of intimacy than is often accorded to nonsexual friendship these days. The first and second selves are intimate because they compose, together, a single entity\u2026 \u2013 at this level of intensity, sexual love is sometimes inadequate as a model because it may not be intimate enough. [Italics mine]\n\nVan Nortwick's observation is a shrewd one. Our model of friendship is not consonant with theirs. Within these ancient societies where homoerotic desire was freely, sometimes emphatically, expressed, intense friendship might well develop a sexual expression even while that expression was not the focus of the friendship, or even thought of as particularly characteristic of it. 'The ancient Greeks, perhaps because their societies were so highly militarized\u2026 simply assumed the centrality of philia' (Shay 1994: 41). It would be inappropriate to refer to the friend as lover (except in very specific circumstances), as such would fall far short of encompassing the whole relationship. Alexander's choice of 'philalexandros' for Hephaistion said more about the nature of his affection than calling him merely erastes or eromenos.\n\nConclusion\n\nWas the relationship of Alexander and Hephaistion an atypical affair? I do not believe that it was. We have shown that Macedonian society allowed same-age partnerships and seems to have accepted them without comment. Among the Pages, it was not only possible, but perhaps even to be expected that young men would form friendships with one another that included a sexual aspect, but was not limited to it.\n\nWhat, then, might we gather from this detailed look at one example? Simply that models \u2013 even good ones based on careful analysis of the evidence \u2013 can put blinders on subsequent scholarship \u2013 if we are not careful. Without the cognitive dissonance created by the sheer bulk of circumstantial testimony in the case of Alexander and Hephaistion, it would be easy to overlook a relationship like theirs. Even with the circumstantial evidence, we still cannot be at all certain they were lovers. Because such relationships are not atypical for their societies, sly insinuations \u2013 such as those made about Agathon the Tragedian \u2013 are absent.\n\nIt does cause one to wonder how many other such relationships may have existed between less famous philoi. While the Dover Model describes the most common-and least ambiguous-form for homoerotic expression in ancient Greece, it was not the only one. There were other options, particularly in military contexts. In short, a confusion of terms may make it difficult for us to pinpoint other such typical 'atypical' affairs, and we should take this into account when employing our models. All such models are to some degree artificial constructs; we should expect them, then, to be ultimately inadequate.\n\n\u2014 Jeanne Reames: \"An atypical affair?

Their relationship has been a topic of debate among historians and philosophers. However, the issue attached to them has no credible evidence linking the two romantically or sexually.\n\nLet us discuss and learn more information about the story behind their greatness and know the real score when it comes to their relationship.\n\nWho Are Alexander and Hephaestion?\n\nAlexander and Hephaestion are king and army general, as Alexander was the king of the Macedonian kingdom since the age of 20, and Hephaestion was the general of the army. They worked and shared an amazing friendship together, and later, Hephaestion married Alexander\u2019s sister.\n\nAlexander and Hephaestion\u2019s Early Life\n\nAlexander III was the son and successor of his father and the king of Macedon, Philip II, and his mother was Olympias, the fourth of eight wives of King Philip II and daughter of the King of Epirus, Neoptolemus I. Alexander III was born in the capital of the Kingdom of Macedon.\n\nHowever, Hephaestion\u2019s exact age was unknown, as there was no written biography about him. Many scholars assumed that he was born in 356 BC, the same age as Alexander. The only surviving narrative of him was from the Alexander Romance. A tale saying that Alexander was sailing with Hephaestion at the age of 15 became another clue about Hephaestion, showing that they are in the same age bracket and attending lectures together at Meiza under Aristotle\u2019s tutelage.\n\nAlthough the letters no longer exist today, Hephaestion\u2019s name was found in the catalog of Aristotle\u2019s correspondence, which implies that their content must have been significant and that Aristotle himself was so impressed by his pupil that he sent letters to converse with him while Alexander\u2019s Empire was expanding.\n\nVarious accounts show that since their early life, Alexander and Hephaestion knew each other and learned about philosophy, religion, logic, morals, medicine, and art under the supervision of Aristotle in Mieza at the Temple of Nymphs, which seems to have been their boarding school. They studied together with the children of Macedonian nobles like Ptolemy and Cassander, and some of these students became Alexander\u2019s future generals and \u201cCompanions\u201d with Hephaestion as their leader.\n\nAlexander and Hephaestion Youth\n\nIn their youth, Alexander got acquainted with some exiles at the Macedonian court because they were given protection by King Philip II as they opposed Artaxerxes III, which later on was said to be influenced some changes in the administration of the Macedonian state.\n\nOne of them was Artabazos II, together with his daughter Barsine, who then became Alexander\u2019s mistress; Amminapes, who became Alexander\u2019s satrap; and a nobleman from Persia known as Sisines, who shared with the Macedonian court a lot of knowledge about Persian issues. They resided at the Macedonian court from 352 to 342 BC.\n\nMeanwhile, Hephaestion served in the military service in his youth, even before Alexander the Great became a king. As a teen, he campaigned against the Thracians, sent in King Phillip II\u2019s Danube campaign in 342 BC and the battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC. He was also sent on some important diplomatic missions.\n\nAlexander and Hephaestion\u2019s early life prepared them to intelligently govern the kingdom and serve in the military, and as early as their youth, they bonded and became firm friends, which soon after developed into romance in their adulthood.\n\nAlexander and Hephaestion\u2019s Career Together\n\nIn all of Alexander\u2019s campaigns, there stood Hephaestion on his side. He was the second-in-command, most loyal, and the most trusted friend and general in the army of the king. Their bond became stronger as they went campaigning and battling against different countries and tasted the sweetness of success.\n\nWhen Alexander was 16, he rule in Pella as Regent while his father led an army against Byzantium. During that time, the neighboring country revolted, and Alexander was forced to react and led an army. He eventually defeated them, and to mark his victory, he founded the city of Alexandroupolis on the scene. That was just the first of his many victories.\n\nWhen King Philip came back, he and Alexander led their army through the Greek city-states, where they battled the combined forces of Thebes and Athens. King Philip led the army facing the Athenians, whereas Alexander with his Companions, headed by Hephaestion, took command of the troops against the Thebans. It is said that the Sacred Band, an elite Theban army composed of 150 male lovers, was killed.\n\nAlexander Became The King\n\nIn 336 BC, while attending his daughter\u2019s wedding, King Phillip was assassinated by Pausanias, the head of his own bodyguards and allegedly his ex-lover. Soon after, Alexander succeeded the throne of his father at the age of 20.\n\nThe news of the king\u2019s death reached the city-states they had conquered, all of which immediately revolted. Alexander reacted by taking the title \u201cSupreme Commander,\u201d same as his father, and intended to go to war with Persia. Before leading the campaign to Persian territory, Alexander secured the Macedonian borders by defeating and reasserting control over the Thracians, the Getae, the Illyrians, the Taulanti, the Triballi, the Athenians, and the Thebans. This was also the time when Alexander led the League of Corinth and used his authority to launch the Pan-Hellenic project predicted by his father.\n\nWithin two years of ascending the throne, he crossed the Hellespont with an army of almost 100,000 soldiers. He also detoured to Troy, the setting of Homer\u2019s Iliad, his favorite text since his youth under Aristotle\u2019s tutelage, where Arrian recounts that Alexander and Hephaestion laid a garland on the tomb of Achilles and Patroclus and ran naked to honor their dead heroes. This invited speculation that the two were lovers.\n\nBattles Together\n\nAfter a series of battles, the Macedonian Empire under Alexander\u2019s leadership conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety and overthrew Darius III, the king of Persia at Issos. Then, Alexander proceeded to conquer Egypt and Syria where he founded the city of Alexandria, his most successful city, and he was declared the son of the king of the Egyptian gods, Amun.\n\nAfter the battle of Issus, in 333 BC, it is said that Hephaestion was ordered and authorized to designate to the throne the Sidonian whom he considered most deserving to be appointed to that high office. Alexander also entrusted him to lead after the siege of Tyre in 332 BC.\n\nAt the battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC, Alexander caught Darius III in Mesopotamia and defeated his army, but Darius III again fled where he was killed by his own men. When Alexander\u2019s army found his body, he returned it to his mother, Sisygambis, to be buried in the royal tombs with his predecessors.\n\nDespite Alexander succeeding in numerous campaigns, and taking control of most of modern-day Greece, Egypt, Syria, the Balkans, Iran, and Iraq, he was still determined to reach the Ganges in India. However, his troops had been on the march for eight years, and they wanted to go home, this was all through the command of his best friend and general of the army, Hephaestion.\n\nFinally, Alexander accepted his defeat against his troops who refused to continue the campaign and decided to go to Susa. There, Alexander hosted a feast for his large army, accompanied by a mass marriage of his officers, including Hephaestion. Hephaestion married a Persian noblewoman, to be able to build bridges between their two empires.\n\nAlexander\u2019s Greif by Losing Hephaestion\n\nAfter the feast in Susa, Alexander left for Ectabana, and during that time, Hephaestion fell ill. He had a fever that lasted for seven days, but it was said that he would make a full recovery, allowing Alexander to leave his bedside and make an appearance at the games, which is happening in the city. While he was away, Hephaestion was said to have taken a sudden turn for the worse after eating a meal and died.\n\nAccording to some accounts, Hephaestion died of poisoning, as a motive to hurt the Great King, or the fever he suffered might have been typhoid and caused him to die from internal bleeding. He was cremated, and after which, his ashes were taken to Babylon and honored as a divine hero. The king referred to him as \u201cthe friend I valued as my own life.\u201d\n\nLeaving Alexander in grief, the king suffered a mental breakdown, refused to eat or drink for days, and didn\u2019t pay attention to his personal appearance but rather silently mourned or lay on the ground screaming and cutting his hair short. Plutarch described that Alexander\u2019s grief was uncontrollable. He ordered that the manes and tails of all horses be shorn, he commanded the demolition of all battles, and he banned flutes and every other kind of music.\n\nAlexander\u2019s Death\n\nIn 323 BC, Alexander died in the city of Babylon, which he had initially planned to establish as his empire\u2019s capital in Mesopotamia. There are two distinct versions of Alexander\u2019s death. According to Plutarch, Alexander developed a fever after entertaining Admiral Nearchus and spending the night drinking with Medius of Larissa the next day; this fever worsened until he was unable to speak.\n\nIn another account, Diodorus described that after Alexander drank a large bowl of wine in honor of Heracles, he experienced extreme pain, followed by 11 days of weakness. He did not die of fever but rather died after some agony. Following his death, the Macedonian Empire eventually fell apart because of the Wars of Diadochi, which marked the beginning of the Hellenistic period.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe spreading and combining of the cultures of Greco-Buddhism and Hellenistic Judaism comprise Alexanders\u2019 legacy. He also founded the most prominent city in Egypt, the city of Alexandria, along with several other cities that were named after him.\n\nThe dominance of Hellenistic civilization spread up to the Indian subcontinent. It developed through the Roman Empire and Western culture where the Greek language became the common language or lingua franca, as well as became the predominant language of the Byzantine Empire until its disintegration in the mid-15th century AD. All of this is because he had his best friend and army leader, Hephaestion, next to him at all times.\n\nAlexander\u2019s military achievements and enduring success in battle caused several later military leaders to look up to him. His tactics have become a significant subject of studies in military academies worldwide to this day.\n\nIn particular, Alexander and Hephaestion\u2019s relationship led to numerous accusations and speculations that interest different authors from ancient and modern times to write about their stories and give rise to a different genre of literature.\n\nThe Relationship between Alexander and Hephaestion\n\nSome modern scholars suggested that aside from being close friends, Alexander the Great and Hephaestion were also lovers. However, the truth is that there is no credible evidence linking them romantically or sexually. Even the most reliable sources refer to them as friends, but there is circumstantial evidence suggesting they were really close.\n\nRelationship Narration\n\nAlexander and Hephaestion\u2019s relationship was described as a deep and meaningful one. According to one narrative, Hephaestion was \u201cby far the dearest of all the king\u2019s friends; he had been brought up with Alexander and shared all his secrets,\u201d and their relationship lasted throughout their lives. Aristotle even described their friendship as \u201cone soul abiding in two bodies.\u201d\n\nAlexander and Hephaestion had a strong personal bond. Hephaestion was Alexander\u2019s confidant and closest friend. They worked as partners and were always on each other\u2019s side. Whenever Alexander need to divide his armies, he delegated the other half to Hephaestion. The king appealed for consultation from his senior officers but, it was only with Hephaestion that he would speak privately. The latter displayed unquestionable loyalty and support as the king trusted and relied on him.\n\nRelationship in the Biography of Alexander\n\nAlthough none of Alexander\u2019s extant biographers ever mentioned Hephaestion as anything but Alexander\u2019s friend, Hephaestion\u2019s epithet given by Alexander himself was \u201cPhilolexandros.\u201d \u201cPhilos\u201d was the ancient Greek word for a friend, which also pertained to lovers in the sexual sense.\n\nTheir affection for each other was conspicuous. One piece of circumstantial evidence was stated by Arrian, Curtius, and Diodorus; when the Persian queen Sisygambis mistakenly knelt to Hephaestion instead of Alexander, Alexander pardoned the queen saying, \u201cYou were not mistaken, Mother; this man, too, is Alexander.\u201d Another was when Hephaestion was replying to the letter of Alexander\u2019s mother, he wrote, \u201cyou know that Alexander means more to us than anything.\u201d\n\nHephaestion was Alexander\u2019s first wedding torch-bearer in the painting done by Aetion. This implies not only their friendship but also his support for Alexander\u2019s policies. Their relationship was even compared with that of Achilles and Patroclus. Hammond concludes about their affair: \u201cIt is not surprising that Alexander was as closely attached to Hephaestion as Achilles was to Patroclus.\u201d\n\nLoving Relationship\n\nAccording to Arrian and Plutarch, there was an occasion when the two publicly identified themselves as Achilles and Patroclus. When Alexander led a large army to visit Troy, he placed a garland on the tomb of Achilles, and Hephaestion did the same on the tomb of Patroclus. They ran naked to honor their dead heroes.\n\nHowever, according to Thomas R. Martin and Christopher W. Blackwell, it doesn\u2019t mean that Alexander and Hephaestion related to Achilles and Patroclus in terms of being in a homosexual relationship because Homer never implied that Achilles and Patroclus had a sexual relationship.\n\nWhen Hephaestion died, Alexander referred to him as \u201cthe friend I valued as my own life.\u201d He even suffered a mental breakdown, refused to eat or drink for days, didn\u2019t pay attention to his personal appearance but rather silently mourned or lay on the ground screaming and cutting his hair short.\n\nPlutarch described that Alexander\u2019s grief was uncontrollable. He ordered that the manes and tails of all horses should be shorn, he commanded the demolition of all battles, and he banned flutes and every other kind of music.\n\nAlexander and Hephaestion Books\n\nAs their controversial relationship is a hotly debated topic, many authors became interested in its mystery and wrote books telling their stories. Among the most popular ones was Mary Renault, an English writer widely known for her historical novels set in ancient Greece. Her works are about love, sexuality, and gender preference, with openly gay characters, for which she has received several awards and honors both during her lifetime and after her death.\n\nRenault\u2019s most successful and famous historical novel was \u201cThe Alexander Trilogy,\u201d which includes: Fire from Heaven, written in 1969, about Alexander the Great\u2019s childhood and youth; The Persian Boy, written in 1972 and a best seller within the gay community, where the love between Alexander and Hephaestion was immortalized; and Funeral Games, a 1981 novel about Alexander\u2019s death and the disintegration of his empire.\n\nOther historical novels about Alexander written by Jeanne Reames were Dancing with the Lion and Dancing with the Lion: Rise under the genres of historical fiction, romance novel, and gay fiction. These books cover Alexander\u2019s life from his childhood until the time he became regent. In 2004, Andrew Chugg authored The Lost Tomb of Alexander the Great, and in 2006, his book entitled Alexander\u2019s Lovers, which is often mistaken as Alexander\u2019s Lover was published.\n\nMichael Hone also authored the book Alexander and Hephaestion based on witnesses who were alive during the time of Alexander and Hephaestion, including Theopompus, Demosthenes, and Callisthenes, as well as later historians like Arrian, Justin, Plutarch, and others.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlexander the Great and Hephaestion\u2019s story was one of childhood friendship that developed into love, trust, loyalty, and romance that was tested through the hardships of campaigning and battling.\n\nAlexander the Great has been thought of as one of the world\u2019s greatest and most successful military generals.\n\nHephaestion was Alexander\u2019s best friend, confidant, and second-in-command.\n\nTheir noticeable closeness led to accusations that they were lovers.\n\nThere are numerous historical novels written about their story.\n\nAlexander and Hephaestion\u2019s story remains a topic of debate among historians and philosophers.\n\nIt truly is a relationship that was tested by fire and time and is admirable and fascinating at the same time."}, {"url": "https://totallyhistory.com/alexander-and-hephaestion/", "page_content": "Battle of the Hydaspes by Charles Le Brun, with Alexander in a blue cloak and Hephaestionin in a red cloak\n\nHephaestion was a general in Alexander the Great\u2019s army and was the closest friend of the famous conqueror. He was born around 356 B.C., in Pella, to a general in Philip II\u2019s army. Hephaestion was believed to be the same age as Alexander.\n\nBeginnings of the Friendship\n\nAlexander and Hephaestion grew up together and became good friends. When the time came that Alexander had to be removed from his maternal uncle\u2019s care and given over to the philosopher Aristotle for his education, Hephaestion came along with him. For three years, the two boys, along with other sons of prominent people, studied logic, morals, religion, art, and philosophy. These three years of studying had impressed themselves on the mind of the young Macedonian, and later, he would designate his childhood friends as his officers in his army\u2019s elite cavalry, called the Companions. Of all his officers, though, he chose Hephaestion as the leader.\n\nIn 340 B.C, when Alexander was just sixteen years old, his father, Philip II, had to march his troops to fight in Byzantium. Philip called for his son to head home to Pella and serve as regent. Alexander thus had to stop his education under Aristotle and head home. Philip\u2019s absence emboldened the nearby Maedi tribe to rise up in revolt, and Alexander\u2019s leadership and combat skills were tested. This test turned out to be an early indication of Alexander\u2019s capability as a commander, as he easily defeated the rebels and chased them off from their homeland. He ordered a new city built on the defeated tribe\u2019s land and named it Alexandroupolis.\n\nHephaestion\u2019s Presence in Alexander\u2019s Campaigns\n\nWhen Alexander set foot in the city of Troy, he paid homage to the tomb of his cherished childhood hero, Achilles. Aristotle had taught him well about Homer\u2019s Iliad, and so now, Alexander placed a wreath on Achilles\u2019 tomb. Meanwhile, Hephaestion placed a wreath on top of Patroclus\u2019 tomb. After this, the two ran a race while naked as a form of worship for their heroes. In Homer\u2019s epic poem, the relationship between Patroclus and Achilles is non-sexual, but in later times, such as that of Alexander, the relationship was taken to be sexual. Alexander and Hephaestion\u2019s act of placing wreaths on the two heroes could have been their way of flaunting to the public their romantic relationship.\n\nThe family of Darius in front of Alexander, Hephaestion pointing out Alexander\n\nWhen Alexander crushed the army of King Darius III of Persia, the Persian king fled, leaving not only his harem behind but also his mother, Sisygambis. Sisygambis then acknowledged the conquerors by bowing before Hephaestion, thinking that he was Alexander the Great. She begged for him to spare the women\u2019s lives, and the Companions started to laugh at the situation. Alexander gestured to the Companions to stop, then took Sisygambis\u2019 hand and helped her up. He said to her that she had not made a mistake after all, because Hephaestion was Alexander too. Sisygambis\u2019 mistake was most probably due to Hephaestion\u2019s good looks. She must have thought that a conquering king should look strikingly good. And Hephaestion was \u2014 he was not only taller than Alexander but also more attractive. The latter did not have the dashing good looks that one might expect to see on a king. He was broad and relatively short, with a thin beard. His skin color was reddish, one of his eyes was blue, and the other was brown.\n\nAlexander soon planned to march into India and arrive at the Ganges River. However, it had been eight years since his army had been on the move, and he had badly wanted to return home and rest. His veteran soldiers eventually launched a revolt at the Hyphasis River, and Alexander was forced to obey his men\u2019s will and march towards Susa, east of the Tigris. When they arrived in the city, Alexander offered to pay his veterans and send them back home. The veterans felt they were being dismissed, so they criticized Alexander for letting many Persians fight along with them in the Macedonian army. The argumentation went on for three days before Alexander decided to relieve his veterans of their military titles and give them to his Persian men. This move shocked the Macedonian soldiers and put a stop to their protestations. Alexander eventually threw a feast for all his men, where they settled their differences. At this feast, Alexander had Hephaestion and his men marry Persian women of nobility.\n\nAlexander\u2019s Lack of Interest in Women\n\nAlexander had two wives, Roxana, a Bactrian princess, and Stateira II, daughter of Darius III. While his marriage to Stateira may have been a political move, his marriage to Roxana must have been out of love, if only because it had no great political use. However, people did not fail to notice that Alexander only had both women pregnant much later, near his death. Also, Alexander was observed to not have been enthusiastic about the enormous harem he inherited from Darius. On top of all this, he was apparently fond of a eunuch slave named Bagoas, whom he kissed in front of people. The Roman historian, Quintus Curtius Rufus, commented that Alexander disliked pleasures that females offered and that as a result, his mother worried about having no heir to the throne. Even Diogenes the Cynic once commented that Alexander had only been defeated by Hephaestion\u2019s thighs.\n\nThe Death of Hephaestion\n\nWhen Alexander left the feast and headed for the city of Ecbatana, Hephaestion grew weak and developed a fever. Alexander rushed back to see his friend, but Hephaestion stayed in bed, frail for seven days and being taken care of by doctors. Later, it looked like Hephaestion started to recover, and he even had a meal, the first he had in days. This improvement in Hephaestion\u2019s condition made Alexander think his friend would eventually regain his strength. He left his friend\u2019s bedside and headed over to the games being held in the city. But Hephaestion\u2019s condition became worse than before he took the meal. Alexander was informed about the situation, and he rushed back to his friend, only to see him already dead when he arrived. During that time, people suspected that Hephaestion\u2019s meal was laced with poison. They believed that when he started to regain his strength, there was no reason he should fall ill again. However, some scholars have offered the possibility that Hephaestion must have suffered from typhoid, which must have left painful ulcers in his intestines. The food he ate probably caused these ulcers to burst, causing him to bleed from the inside.\n\nDespite this possibility, some still believe that Hephaestion died of poisoning. Like all powerful men, Alexander was surrounded by people with secret agendas, and these people knew that Hephaestion was very dear to him. Therefore, if anyone wanted to make Alexander suffer, they could do it by killing his closest friend. Moreover, some people criticized Alexander for why he allowed Hephaestion to peek at his personal letters while he was reading them.\n\nAlexander\u2019s Grief\n\nWhatever caused Hephaestion\u2019s death, the Greek historian Plutarch wrote that Alexander suffered from uncontrollable grief. Another Greek historian, Arrian, wrote that Alexander laid on top of his dead friend\u2019s body and cried all day. He added that Alexander did not eat for two days following Hephaestion\u2019s death. Then, Alexander ordered all music to be stopped and all horses\u2019 tails and hair be cut off. He even had Hephaestion\u2019s doctors crucified for their failure. Like his beloved hero, Achilles, who placed some strands of his hair on Patroclus\u2019 hand before the cremation, Alexander cut some of his hair and placed it on Hephaestion\u2019s hands.\n\nAlexander decreed a period of grieving across his whole kingdom and sought to have his friend proclaimed as a god. Ancient people believed that after a person died, he would go to a certain place. Alexander must have reasoned that since he considered himself a god and would undoubtedly be proclaimed a god after his death, it should only be appropriate that his friend be proclaimed a god too. In his mind, this would ensure that when he died, he would surely go to the place where Hephaestion was and see him again. However, the Oracle said that Hephaestion was only a divine hero and could not be declared a god. Alexander accepted this and immediately ordered the construction of temples in his friend\u2019s memory. It was only then that Hephaestion\u2019s funeral commenced, with Alexander preparing in his mind a magnificent and expensive funeral for Hephaestion.\n\nHephaestion\u2019s Funeral\n\nHephaestion\u2019s body was mummified and placed in a coffin. Alexander then ordered the architect Stasicrates to design a funeral pyre so elaborate that it took the architect six months to build it. The structure stood 60 meters high and covered 200 square meters, made up of enormous wooden pillars and rising up to seven floors. The sarcophagus of Hephaestion sat at the top of the structure. On the day of the funeral, soldiers, family, and friends came together in front of the magnificent structure that was to be burned down in a matter of minutes. It was at sunrise when Alexander touched the foot of the structure with his torch and set it on fire. The blaze was accompanied by the voices of singers singing songs of lamentation for Alexander\u2019s most precious friend.\n\nAround twelve months after Hephaestion died, Alexander started to weaken with a fever, which may have been caused by typhoid, malaria, or poison. He grew weaker over the following two weeks and eventually died."}, {"url": "http://ancientheroes.net/blog/did-alexander-the-great-really-idolize-achilles", "page_content": "There is no doubt that Alexander was linked to Achilles in the ancient world. The question is when did this tradition begin. Was it during Alexander the Great's lifetime or sometime afterwards?\n\nSome believe that the uncanny parallels between the lives of the (mythic) Achilles and Alexander led the later Greek and Roman historians to exaggerate Alexander's interest in the hero. Regardless of where one stands on this theory, one must admit that the similarities are striking.\n\nBoth Achilles and Alexander were princes, raised under the care of the world's finest tutors. According to myth, Achilles was trained in a diverse range of fields including medicine and survival by Chiron, an especially wise centaur who taught the most famous Greek heroes. Alexander also received something of a liberal arts education. His father, King Philip, was able to secure the services of the philosopher Aristotle, the protege of Plato now widely revered as a founder of modern political and scientific thought. Aristotle probably imbued the teenage Alexander with a deeper understanding of the Homeric stories he had known since his childhood.\n\nFrom the beginning, both Achilles and Alexander showed an uncommon affinity, if not an all-out lust, for combat. While still only young men, they became prolific conquerors who led Greek armies on campaigns against powerful eastern civilizations.\n\nThe eerie similarity seen in the early lives of Achilles and Alexander is only intensified by the circumstances surrounding their deaths. Both men died young, shortly after the death of their closest companions, Patroclus (companion to Achilles) and Hephaestion (companion to Alexander). Even the way Alexander mourned Hephaestion seems modeled on Homer's account of Achilles' reaction to the death of Patroclus. Like Achilles, Alexander insisted on holding his friend's body for hours on end, refusing to consume food or drink. For Hephaestion's funeral, Alexander constructed an elaborate pyre and cut his hair short (Arrian 7.14). If these accounts are accurate, it appears Alexander fell back on the example of Achilles during the darkest moments of his life.\n\nDoes all of this necessarily mean that Alexander idolized or emulated Achilles?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, some notable historians believe it certainly does. Robin Lane Fox views the Homeric account of Achilles as the key window into Alexander's mysterious personality. Fox writes that this myth is \"...the link which spans the figures and stories of Alexander's youth\" and that it is \"the most direct clue to his mind\" (Alexander the Great, pg. 59). Fox goes on to explain that \"It is through Homer that Alexander still comes to life\" and that Alexander did not read Homer as a scholar, but \"more in the spirit of a marcher baron living out the ballads which mirrored his own home world\" (pg. 66-67).\n\nOthers, however, are skeptical of Fox's analysis of Alexander. They highlight the many problems in relying too heavily on the works of Plutarch, Arrian, Diodorus, Curtius, Aelian and other historians of antiquity. All of these works were composed centuries after Alexander's death. Although these accounts were, to varying degrees, based on first-hand accounts of Alexander's life (which are now lost), it is unclear how much was changed or added in the intervening years.\n\nFurthermore, it is certainly possible, even likely, that these Greek and Roman historians recognized the broad biographical similarities between Alexander and Achilles and used them as a kind of literary theme, a convenient way to make sense of Alexander's personality.\n\nAnd even if the direct comparisons between Alexander and Achilles originated during Alexander's lifetime, they may have been propagated by members of Alexander's royal court who were eager to flatter him, rather than Alexander himself.\n\nThese objections weaken the case that Alexander the Great idolized Achilles and derived motivation from his myth. It causes one to wonder whether Alexander's supposed obsession with Achilles was exaggerated, if not entirely invented, sometime after his death in 323 BCE.\n\nOn the other hand, if one is prepared to throw out the claims of the best surviving sources on Alexander's life, one must also remember how much information has been lost throughout the ages.\n\nConsidering the prevalence of post-Classical representations of Alexander as a \"new Achilles\", it is possible that this association was even more pronounced during Alexander's reign than Arrian and others indicate. Eugene Borza, a leading scholar of ancient Macedon, has floated the possibility that the various Roman and Egyptian artifacts which represent Alexander as a successor to Achilles may have been inspired by now-lost artwork and events from Alexander's lifetime.\n\nWhere does this leave us? The surviving literary sources on Alexander's life have been analyzed ad nauseam. When it comes to this issue of Alexander and Achilles, scholars appear to have reached a stalemate. Some take the leap of believing Arrian and the other ancient historians, while others are hesitant.\n\nIs there anything that could tip the scales of this debate? Does any alternative evidence exist from Alexander's lifetime that could provide clarity as to what he believed and how others viewed him? Possibly.\n\nThe first piece of evidence comes from a speech made by the great Athenian orator Demosthenes, a contemporary critic of Alexander and his father Philip. Demosthenes referred to Alexander as a \"Margites\", a caricature of Achilles from a lost poem attributed to Homer. Some modern historians believe that this allegation would only have made sense to Demosthenes' Athenian audience if they were aware of Alexander's desire to emulate Achilles. However, this assumption, along with the precise meaning of the term \"Margites\", have been disputed. Such an obscure reference may indeed be a clue, but it is hardly definitive enough to rest one's case on.\n\nA more interesting clue comes from the ruins of Vergina, home of the Royal Tombs of ancient Macedon. In 2015, the findings of a forensic study conducted on the human remains in the Royal Tombs was published in a prominent scientific journal. The scientists found that damage to the knee bones of the male skeleton in Tomb I is consistent with the leg wound King Philip II (Alexander's father) suffered in battle in 339 BCE, three years before his assassination. This finding contradicts the commonly-held view that Philip was buried in Tomb II and Arrhidaeus, Alexander's half-brother, was buried in Tomb I.\n\nOk, so why is this relevant?\n\nBecause this apparent breakthrough increases the likelihood that the ivory and gold-encrusted shield found alongside the skeleton in Tomb II (pictured below) once belonged to Alexander himself. After Alexander died in Babylon, Arrhidaeus inherited his royal belongings, which may have included his shield. And even if Arrhidaeus' shield is not the same shield Alexander carried, it may well be a replica, as the members of Alexander's royal court were known to reproduce elements of his elaborate personal style.\n\nAlthough the shield has suffered significant damage over more than two millenia, enough of it remains to identify a carving of a Greek warrior standing over an Amazonian. The most famous scene of this kind in Greek art was of Achilles standing over the Amazonian Queen Penthesilia, after he defeated her during the Trojan War. If Tomb II at Vergina does indeed hold the remains of Alexander's half-brother (as the latest scientific evidence indicates), its accompanying shield, or one very similar to it, may have been the one carried by Alexander the Great before his death. Either possibility increases the odds that the later association made between Alexander and Achilles originated during Alexander's lifetime."}, {"url": "https://studymoose.com/the-relationship-between-alexander-and-the-great-general-hephaestion-essay", "page_content": "Alexander III of Macedon, or better known as Alexander the Great was king of Macedon, a state in northern Ancient Greece.

Curtius states that Hephaestion was the sharer of all his secrets. At Alexander\u2019s first wedding Hephaestion was the torch bearer (best man). This showed not only their friendship but also Hephaestion\u2019s support for Alexander\u2019s policies, as Alexander\u2019s choice of an Asian bride had not been a popular one. When they returned to Persia Hephaestion was officially titled Alexander\u2019s second in command.\n\nHammond sums up their public relationship well: \u201cIt is not surprising that Alexander was as closely attached to Hephaestion as Achilles was to Patroclus\u201d, and \u201cAt the time of his death Hephaestion held the highest single command, that of the Companion Cavalry; and had been repeatedly second in command to Alexander in the hierarchy of the Asian court, holding the title of Chiliarch, which had been held by Nabarzans under Darius. Thus Alexander honoured Hephaestion both as the closest of his friends and the most distinguished of his Field Marshals. It has been said that as well as being close friends Alexander and Hephaestion were also lovers. It cannot be proved that they were lovers as none of the ancient sources states this in so many words. However, Arrian describes the occasion when Alexander and Hephaestion publicly identified themselves with Achilles and Patroclus, who were acknowledged, by Plato and Aeschylus among others, to have been lovers. It happened at the begging of the campaign in Asia when Alexander led a contingent of the army to visit Troy.\n\nHe laid a wreath on the tomb of Achilles, and Hephaestion laid a wreath on the tomb of Patroclus, and they ran a race, naked, to honour their dead heroes. Robin Lane Fox, writing in 1973, says: \u201cIt was a remarkable tribute, uniquely paid, and it is also Hephaestion\u2019s first mention in Alexander\u2019s career. Already the two were intimate, Patroclus and Achilles even to those around them; the comparison would remain to the end of their days and is proof of their life as lovers, for by Alexander\u2019s time, Achilles and Patroclus were agreed to have enjoyed the relationship which Homer had never directly mentioned.\n\nNothing shows better the nature and length of their relationship than Alexander\u2019s overwhelming grief at Hephaestion\u2019s death. As Andrew Chugg says, \u201c\u2026 it is surely incredible that Alexander\u2019s reaction to Hephaestion\u2019s death could indicate anything other than the closest relationship imaginable. \u201d Arrian says that Alexander \u201c\u2026 flung himself on the body of his friend and lay there nearly all day long in tears, and refused to be parted from him until he was dragged away by force of his companions. Arrian also said that Alexander, after Hephaestion\u2019s death, described him as \u201c\u2026 the friend I valued as my own life. \u201d\n\nIn conclusion Alexander and Hephaestion\u2019s relationship was extremely close. They may or may not have been lovers but the friendship they shared was one of a kind. Their tutor, Aristotle, described such a friendship as \u201c\u2026 one soul abiding in two bodies\u201d. Paul Cartledge describes their closeness when he says: \u201cAlexander seems actually to have referred to Hephaestion as his alter ego. \u201d They truly were soul mates and had one of the strongest relationships in history."}, {"url": "https://www.worldhistory.org/Hephaestion/", "page_content": "Hephaestion was a member of Alexander the Great's personal bodyguard and the Macedonian king's closest and lifelong friend and advisor. So much so, Hephaestion's death would bring the young king to tears. From 334 to 323 BCE Alexander the Great conquered much of the known world. He led his army on a ten-year odyssey across Asia Minor and into Persia, Egypt and India. Eventually, after his defeat of Darius III, he became the self-proclaimed King of Asia. Of course, he could not have done this without the support of his loyal army and staff of skilled officers \u2013 Ptolemy I, Perdiccas, and Craterus, but above all others, Hephaestion.\n\nEarly Life\n\nThe son of Amyntas, Hephaestion was raised in the Macedonian capital of Pella and according to most sources born in 356 BCE, the same year as the king. Being from an aristocratic family, as were many of the staff officers who would follow Alexander into Asia, he became a student, alongside Alexander, of the philosopher Aristotle at Mieza, a city west of Pella. His intelligence impressed the Athenian academic, and, like the king, they would correspond with each other during the long Persian campaign.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nHephaestion was Alexander's closest & most loyal companion throughout the great king's military campaigns.\n\nHephaestion was considered handsome by many, and Alexander's father, Philip II of Macedon, regarded him as an excellent influence on his son. Shortly after Philip married Cleopatra, the future king became concerned about his position as successor. A disagreement erupted between Philip and Alexander, a dispute fueled by his friends. Because of this, many of Alexander's friends were sent into exile; however, because of Philip's respect for Hephaestion, he was spared this humiliation.\n\nOn Campaign\n\nIn 334 BCE, after regaining the loyalties of many of the Greek city-states \u2013 especially following the razing of Thebes \u2013 Alexander and his army crossed the Hellespont on the first leg of their conquest of Persia. However, before clashing with the Persian army at River Granicus, Alexander chose to visit the tomb of his hero (and supposed ancestor) Achilles at Troy (a small village at the time of Alexander). Such was his fascination with the hero, the king always slept with a copy of Homer's Iliad under his pillow. With him at Troy, of course, was, among others, Hephaestion who laid a wreath at the tomb of Achilles' friend Patroclus. Indeed, many saw the relationship of Alexander and Hephaestion to be akin to that of Achilles and Patroclus. Later, the two men stood side-by-side as Alexander severed the Gordian Knot. Because of this unique closeness, many officers grew extremely jealous. Oddly enough, this jealousy was not limited to the staff for Olympias, Alexander's overly-protective mother, also resented the relationship.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nHephaestion's friendship with Alexander would eventually enable him to be appointed chiliarch or second-in-command. Although there is considerable disagreement among contemporary sources, many within the army did not believe Hephaestion to have the necessary leadership or military skills; in fact, some fail to mention any active participation in several of the major battles (although he was seriously wounded at the Battle of Gaugamela); however, luckily for Alexander, he demonstrated a talent for organization. Alexander would leave much of the campaign's logistics to Hephaestion \u2013 the supply and transportation of equipment, bridge building and even the establishment and planning of new settlements.\n\nAlexander the Great (Facial Reconstruction) Arienne King (CC BY-NC-SA)\n\nRivalry & Special Position\n\nOne officer, Craterus, grew to deeply resent Hephaestion (the feeling was mutual), and Alexander had to separate the two on more than one occasion. At one point in India, they had actually drawn swords. Alexander was forced to reprimand them both, scolding Hephaestion and telling him he would be nothing without Alexander. (Historians disagree on the meaning of this statement.) It was often said that Craterus was a friend of the king, but Hephaestion was a friend of Alexander. In his Greek Lives historian Plutarch wrote:\n\nLove History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter!\n\n\u2026 he (Alexander) loved Hephaestion best, but respected Craterus most, he was constantly saying that in his opinion while Hephaestion was loyal to Alexander, Craterus was loyal to the king. This helps to explain why there was bad feeling festering between the two of them, so that they often clashed.\n\nLater, Plutarch said that the king brought the two together and made them friends again but gave each a warning \u2013 he would kill both of them if he ever found them quarrelling again. In the end, Craterus would return to Macedonia, eventually dying in 321 BCE during the Wars of the Diadochi after Alexander's death.\n\nThis intimate relationship between Hephaestion and Alexander can also be seen in an incident after the Battle of Issus and the defeat of Darius III. The Persian king ran from the field of battle and escaped capture, leaving his army to suffer a devastating rout. Unfortunately for his mother, wife, and daughters, they were left behind along with abundant riches; Darius would eventually appeal unsuccessfully for their safe return. Realizing the fate of most prisoners of war, especially women, and expecting the worse, Darius' mother, Sisygambis, feared for their safety, and as Alexander and Hephaestion entered the tent, she threw herself before the taller and more handsome Hephaestion, begging for her life. In his The Campaigns of Alexander historian Arrian related the story.\n\n\u2026 Darius' mother, in doubt owing to the similarity of their dress, which of the two was the King, prostrated herself before Hephaestion because he was taller than his companion. Hephaestion stepped back, and one of the Queen's attendant's rectified her mistake by pointing to Alexander; the Queen withdrew in profound embarrassment, but Alexander merely remarked that her error was of no account, for Hephaestion, too, was an Alexander.\n\nArrian added that whether or not the incident was true, the young king should be admired for his respect and confidence in a friend \u2013 but it also speaks for the nature of Alexander's character.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nNaval Command\n\nAfter Issus, Hephaestion was placed in charge of Alexander's naval reinforcements, ordered to follow the army's progress along the Mediterranean coast from Gaza to the city Pelusium on the Egyptian delta \u2013 the latter's governor surrendered both the city and its entire treasury without a fight. In another test of Alexander's confidence in Hephaestion, the king placed him in charge of replacing the old, deposed Persian ruler of the newly seized port city of Sidon with another governor. A member of the old royal family Abdalorymus was quickly found and given the governorship. Next, Hephaestion led the fleet up the Nile River to the Egyptian capital of Memphis where he, Ptolemy, Craterus and Alexander studied Egyptian law and customs. Prior to the final battle against Darius at Gaugamela, Alexander placed Hephaestion in charge of a squadron to scout the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and build a bridge. Wisely, he did not complete the bridge until the arrival of Alexander, fearing that the Persians would destroy it. Aside from the mention of his wound received, sources do not mention Hephaestion again until the conspiracy trial of Philotas.\n\nCities Named Alexandria by Alexander the Great Simeon Netchev (CC BY-NC-SA)\n\nLoyalty to Alexander\n\nBefore marching into India and prior to their expedition into Bactria, there was major unrest within the army. The veterans were weary and wanted to return home to Macedonia and their families. Also, many staff officers disagreed with the king on many of his atypical decisions \u2013 his adoption of Persian customs and attire as well as his wish that they prostrate themselves before him and kiss his ring. They especially resented both the addition of Persians into the army and being asked to take Persian wives. However, unlike many others, Hephaestion always supported Alexander's decisions even with the idea of taking a Persian wife and he was given one of the daughters of Darius, Drypatis, while Alexander chose the other daughter, Barsine, as his mistress.\n\nHowever, Hephaestion's loyalty to Alexander was best demonstrated during the would-be mutiny against Alexander. In 330 BCE Hephaestion, along with Craterus, spoke against Philotas, the suspected ringleader of the plot, convincing the king that he and the other conspirators should be tortured and executed - this execution also included Parmenio, Philotas' father and the long-time commander from the court of Philip. Afterwards, Alexander rewarded Hephaestion by splitting the command of the Companions between him and Cleitus.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nPortraits of Alexander and a Youth (Hephaestion?) Caroline Cervera (CC BY-NC-SA)\n\nDuring the campaign in India, Hephaestion led a large force through the Khyber Pass subduing any rebellious Indian tribes. Next, Perdiccas and he took half the Companions, the mercenary cavalry, the baggage train and several Indian engineers to build a bridge across the Indus (this same bridge would be used to ford the Hydaspes). When lines of communication were secured, they rejoined Alexander and prepared to cross the Indus and face King Porus \u2013 at the Hydaspes Hephaestion would be placed in command of one squadron. After the victory against Porus, Hephaestion split with Alexander reconnecting later and battling against the Mallians \u2013 it was here that Alexander was injured and near death. Finally, he could go no farther; Alexander succumbed to the wishes of his troops and decided to return northward to Babylon.\n\nDeath\n\nThey spent the summer and fall at Ecbatana where, after a night of heavy drinking, Hephaestion developed a high fever \u2013 Alexander would remain by his friend's side until he showed signs of recovery. Unfortunately, Hephaestion soon relapsed, and in October of 324 BCE, he died (any possibility of poisoning has been dismissed). Alexander would die himself eight months later. The king spent the next two days in tears, grieving for the death of his friend. Besides cutting off his own hair, he ordered the manes and tails of all the horses cut off as well. A state of mourning was declared, sacrifices were made, and sacred fires were lit. Unfortunately, it was a sad day for Hephaestion's doctor, Glaucius, who was executed for his failure to keep his patient alive. Hephaestion's body would eventually be sent to Babylon where a giant pyre was built. Alexander sent an envoy to Siwa to request Hephaestion be declared a god, but the request was refused; he would only be honored as a divine hero. Plutarch wrote:\n\n\u2026he (Alexander) had the wretched doctor impaled on a stake and banned playing the pipes and all music in the camp for a considerable period of time, until he received an oracle from Ammon, telling him to worship Hephaestion as a hero and to institute sacrificial rituals in his honour.\n\nAlthough some sources claim that Hephaestion and Alexander were more than just good friends, most agree that their relationship was unique and strengthened both men. Throughout his life, Hephaestion remained close to the king, serving both as a valuable advisor and friend. Whether or not he was a capable commander is irrelevant, his abilities in logistics assisted in the defeat of the Persians and their king Darius III."}]}
