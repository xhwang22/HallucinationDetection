He was the starting quarterback for the Arizona State Sun Devils. During the 2010 season Threet completed 208 of 336 passes for 2,553 yards, 18 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. He passed for a career-high 391 yards and three touchdowns against Northern Arizona in September 2010.\n\nHe threw for 4,824 yards and 49 touchdowns as a high school player in Adrian, Michigan, and was ranked by Rivals.com as the No. 9 quarterback prospect in the nation in the Class of 2006. Threet committed to Georgia Tech and enrolled early there in January 2007.\n\nAfter the coaches who had recruited him left the program, Threet announced in July 2007 that he was transferring to the University of Michigan under head coach Lloyd Carr. Carr was replaced before the 2008 season by Rich Rodriguez. After sitting out the 2007 season under NCAA transfer rules, the redshirt freshman Threet would go on to start at quarterback in eight of Michigan's 12 games.\n\nLater that same year, Threet transferred to Arizona State University, citing the incompatibility of his playing style as a traditional pro style dropback passer with the spread offense of Rodriguez. After sitting out the 2009 season, Threet had two years of eligibility remaining with Arizona State. On August 30, 2010, Arizona State head coach, Dennis Erickson, announced that Threet would be the starting quarterback for the coming season.\n\nEarly years\n\nThreet was born in Adrian, Michigan, and graduated from Adrian High School. During his senior year in high school, he accumulated 1,896 passing yards and threw 20 touchdown passes. He also had had 1,528 passing yards and 19 touchdowns as a junior. In all, he threw for 4,824 yards and 49 touchdowns in three seasons at Adrian High School.\n\nAs a high school senior, Threet was four-star prospect and the No. 9 quarterback prospect nationally according to Rivals.com. He was also named to The Detroit News Division II All-State first team. In August 2006, Detroit Free Press sports writer Chris Silva wrote that Threet \"has the brains of a Steven Q. Urkel and an arm of a young Peyton Manning. He can audible at the line of scrimmage, like NFL star Peyton Manning, and absorb a playbook faster than Urkel could memorize physics formulas. Threet had Ivy League schools such as Harvard and Princeton clamoring over his smarts and skills.\"\n\nThreet had offers from several major schools, including Wisconsin, Stanford, Illinois, North Carolina State, Indiana, Cincinnati and Georgia Tech.\n\nGeorgia Tech\n\nThreet committed to Georgia Tech in July 2006 and enrolled early in January 2007. His high school coach recalled, \"He fell in love with the recruiters and the position coaches at Georgia Tech.\" Soon after Threet arrived at Georgia Tech, both of the coaches who had recruited him took jobs elsewhere. During spring practice in April 2007, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that \"Threet appeared to take the lead over Calvin Booker for the No. 2 quarterback spot,\" completing 7 of 11 passes for 51 yards and a touchdown while working with the No. 1 offense.\n\nUniversity of Michigan\n\nIn July 2007 Threet announced he would transfer to the University of Michigan. While Lloyd Carr was still head coach at Michigan, he had also recruited five-star quarterback Ryan Mallett. Threet called his former high school coach and left a message saying, \"Coach, I'm going to go back to Michigan, and I'm going to beat [Ryan] Mallett out for that starting job.\" In a July 2007 interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Threet explained his decision: \"The biggest thing is that the two coaches that recruited me took jobs at other schools, and that happened after I got there. People have been asking if it was homesickness, or classes were too hard, or if it was all the competition at Tech. It was not any of those at all. I had a 3.76 grade-point my first semester, and the competition (at Michigan) is as good or better.\"\n\nThreet had been ineligible after his transfer from Georgia Tech. During the 2007 season, the majority of the snaps were taken by senior Chad Henne. However, Henne was sidelined by injury enough that Mallett received a considerable amount of playing time, appearing in 11 games (to Henne's 10) and attempting 141 passes (to Henne's 278). Carr, who had recruited both Mallett, and a year later, Threet, was set to retire as head coach, and Rodriguez was brought in to begin as head coach for the 2008 season. Mallett believed Rodriguez's offense to be unsuitable for a pocket passer, and therefore transferred to Arkansas. That made Michigan's quarterback job was up for grabs. Threet would battle to become the team's starting quarterback along with former walk-on redshirt sophomore, Nick Sheridan, and redshirt sophomore, David Cone. First-year Michigan head coach, Rich Rodriguez, tabbed Sheridan the Michigan starting quarterback to begin the 2008 season. Threet, although, saw action in Michigan's season opener against Utah, entering the game as a substitute and closing the 25-10 deficit before eventually losing, 25-23. He recorded 132 yards on 14-32 passing along with one touchdown and zero interceptions. Threet was slated for his first career start at Michigan in the following game against Miami (Ohio), although Sheridan would also see playing time. On the first offensive play for Michigan, Threet completed a screen pass to Martavious Odoms that was good for 50 yards. On the fifth play, Threet faked a handoff to Sam McGuffie and ran nine yards for a touchdown. Threet finished with six completions on 13 attempts for 63 yards and no touchdowns, although Michigan evened its season record at 1-1. Threet also started in a 35\u201317 loss against Notre Dame in the third week of the season. According to The Michigan Daily, \"Threet's breakout start\" came on the road against Notre Dame when he went 16-of-23 for 175 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions. In its game coverage, the paper reported, \"Redshirt freshman quarterback Steven Threet played with poise, leading the Wolverines to 330 total yards.\"\n\nAfter a bye week before the team's fourth game, Threet was named the starter again and would lead Michigan to their second biggest comeback in school history and the team's biggest win of the season. Michigan trailed #9 Wisconsin 19\u20130 with three minutes left in the third quarter and then scored 27 unanswered points in 13 minutes to take a 27\u201319 lead. After a poor performance in the first half, Threet led the team to 247 yards of total offense and 27 points in the second half. In the third quarter, he led the Wolverines on an 80-yard, 14-play drive ending with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Kevin Koger. Not known for his mobility, Threet's most impressive play was a 58-yard run in the fourth quarter that set up Michigan's game-winning touchdown. After the game, Rodriguez said Threet's run \"surprised a lot of people, maybe even himself.\" Quarterback coach Rod Smith said of Threet's second-half performance, \"He's a competitor. He's got some heart. He'll fight you, which is what I want. That's a start, you know what I mean? We'll keep working on the rest.\"\n\nIn the sixth game of the season, Threet started against Toledo, but he was injured and sat out the second half of the game, which Michigan lost 13\u201310.\n\nStarting in a 35\u201321 loss Michigan State, Threet completed 13 of 27 passes for 168 yards and a touchdown pass to go along with a career-high three interceptions.\n\nIn a start against Purdue later in the season, Threet threw two touchdown passes for the second time, including a 51-yard touchdown pass to Darryl Stonum. Michigan scored a season-high 42 points against Purdue, but the defense gave up 48 points in the game.\n\nThreet missed two of the last three games of the season due to a shoulder injury. He did not make the trip to play against Ohio State. However, by the end of the season, The Michigan Daily wrote that \"Threet has stepped up as a capable signal-caller ... And now, fans can take a measure of relief \u2014 Michigan has a quarterback.\"\n\nOne of the low points of the 2008 season for Threet came after the loss to Michigan State when Michigan's offensive coordinator Calvin Magee publicly criticized Threet's performance as \"inconsistent, like it always is.\" Asked later about Magee's comments, Threet said:\n\n\"I guess I feel like that's a difference of philosophy from the previous staff. Granted, coaches do different things to get the most out of their players. Some people close to me were upset that a coach would call me out in front of the media, but you know, in the end it didn't really matter to me. And to be honest, my play in the Michigan State game was inconsistent. Is it right to say that at the press conference after the game? I mean, we had just lost a big rivalry game, so I would chalk most of that up to emotions after a big game like that.\"\n\nThe Michigan Daily's sports editor, Dan Feldman, later questioned the wisdom of Magee's public criticism of the team's starting quarterback. Feldman opined that Threet had been impressive and concluded, \"Whatever happens from here, credit Threet for handling a difficult season with class.\"\n\nThreet would start a total of eight games, four more than Sheridan's season total. The team recorded its worst season ever after posting a 3-9 record and stopping the country's longest streak of consecutive bowl appearances at 33. He ended the season with 102 completions on 200 attempts for 1,105 yards and nine touchdowns. He also threw seven interceptions. In the off season, Rodriguez would sign quarterbacks Tate Forcier and Denard Robinson on National Signing Day. In February 2009, Threet released a statement saying, \"I have decided to transfer from the University of Michigan. I have requested and received my release. I do not yet know where I will continue my collegiate career, and have no further comment until that decision is made.\"\n\nAs a 6-foot, 6-inch traditional pocket passer, Threet had not fit into the Michigan offensive scheme under first-year head coach Rodriguez, whose spread offense emphasizes mobile quarterbacks. On announcing his transfer to Arizona State, Threet said:\n\n\"I like the pro-style offense and the coaching staff at Arizona State. My career has been filled with ups and downs and coaching changes aren't easy. I was at Georgia Tech for two weeks when they changed coaches. Michigan had the same coaches for like 30 years and then they change. When Coach [Lloyd] Carr retired I wanted to transfer, but I took Coach [Rich] Rodriguez at his word about the offense. I tried to stick it out. I tried to help Michigan win. But in the end the offense didn't fit me. They have a run first offense at every position. What they want is Pat White and that's not me.\"\n\nArizona State University\n\nTransfer to ASU\n\nIn April 2009 Threet announced his decision to transfer to Arizona State University. Interviewed by The Michigan Daily, Threet explained his choice of Arizona State over Oregon State: \"The first thing I looked at for any school I was going to go to was the offense they run and the coaching staff. Arizona State, I feel it fits me offensively with the type of offense they run, it's a pro-style offense. I get along very well with the coaching staff, I feel like they will be able to help me get better every day in practice and throughout the season and help me develop.\"\n\nUnder transfer rules Threet was required to sit out the 2009 season, but had two years of eligibility remaining.\n\nIn March 2010 Threet started for the first unit in Arizona State's spring game, though head coach, Dennis Erickson, said that that was only because Threet won a coin flip. At the time, Threet said, \"I'm very excited, but I'm just a competitive person. Anytime I go out to practice, I'm trying to compete with whoever I'm playing against whether its last year on the scout team or this year trying to win the starting job.\"\n\nThroughout August 2010 Threet was in close competition with Brock Osweiler for the starting quarterback position. In an interview with The Arizona Republic, head coach Dennis Erickson also praised Threet's progression: \"Every quarterback I've been around it just takes awhile to get used to what you're hanging your hat on and what we're doing offensively. He's got a quick release, and he has a hell of an arm. He just needs to continue to get more accurate.\"\n\nOn August 30, 2010, Erickson announced that Threet would be the starting quarterback in the Sun Devils opening game against Portland State. In a short statement, Erickson said that Threet \"was the most consistent throughout fall camp.\"\n\n2010 season\n\nIn the season opener for Arizona State, Threet led the team to a 54-9 win over Portland State. Threet completed 14 of 21 passes for 239 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran with the ball three times for 24 yards and garnered a passer rating of 184.17. His 239 passing yards were the most ever in a debut performance by an Arizona State quarterback.\n\nIn the second game of the 2010 season, Threet led the team to a 41-20 win over Northern Arizona. Threet set career highs with 33 completions and 391 passing yards in the game. He also threw three touchdown passes and two interceptions and completed passes to eight different receivers.\n\nThrough the first two games of the 2010 season, Threet completed 47 of 70 passes for a 67% completion rate and five touchdowns.\n\nThe next few games had their ups and downs for Threet, a very close 20-19 loss at Camp Randall Stadium in Madison, started a downward spiral for the Sun Devils in 2010. In this game Threet went 21 of 33 for 211 yards with 0 TD and 0 INT. Many believed that the Sun Devils outplayed Wisconsin, Threet played well in the game but it started a trend of what-ifs for the Sun Devils season.\n\nThreet finished the 2010 season with 2,553 passing yards, 18 touchdowns and 16 interceptions.\n\nOn February 23, 2011, Threet announced his retirement from football due to repeated concussions. After finishing his playing career he became a Student Assistant on the Arizona State football team's staff."}, {"url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/470805-asu-football-steven-threet-is-the-gem-that-erickson-and-devil-fans-love", "page_content": "Christian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nThe Monday before the 2010 season opener against Portland State, fans in the valley of the sun were awaiting Dennis Erickson\u2019s quarterback decision. Erickson tabbed Steven Threet, a transfer from Michigan, as his starting quarterback and leader of his new no huddle spread offense.\n\nThrough three games, including one on the road at one of the toughest environments, Steven Threet is the perfect man for the job. That is in no way a hit to back up Brock Osweiler, but Threet has been impressive, not just in terms of numbers, but also with the intangibles that normally go unnoticed.\n\nA field general has been desired in Tempe, Threet has command of this offense, and the ears of his troops on the field. The man in the spotlight has to voice the sentiment of his squad. Following the Wisconsin game, Threet expressed his opinion on the near upset versus the Badgers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in moral victories,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Sun Devils played as good of a game as a team can without winning. That\u2019s the bottom line. ASU still lost, but Threet\u2019s performance was impressive, even without a touchdown to his name. In the past couple seasons, the Sun Devil\u2019s offense was pathetic to watch, and an intense struggle to score to say the least.\n\nLast Saturday against the Wisconsin Badgers, ASU\u2019s formerly anemic offense pushed one of the Big Ten\u2019s best defensive units up and down the field. ASU\u2019s execution made the Badgers look like Portland State\u2019s defense in the season opener. Big plays in the running game and audibles by the Threet at the line of scrimmage gave the Sun Devils the upper hand, but in the end it was not enough.\n\n\u201cI think we have a gem,\u201d Dennis Erickson said in regards to Threet\u2019s performance against Wisconsin.\n\nWith yet another big game for ASU this weekend at Sun Devil Stadium, the job does not get any easier for the \u201cgem.\u201d The Oregon Ducks are the fifth ranked team in the country, and for good reason. Both the Ducks offensive and defensive units are ranked first in the country.\n\nChip Kelly, Oregon\u2019s head coach, has engineered the Ducks\u2019 offense to 189 points in 180 minutes of football. Pretty impressive.\n\nThe Sun Devil defense is going to have a major test, but for the first time this season, Oregon\u2019s defense will be tested. Oregon played Tennessee earlier this year, but the Volunteers were no match for the Duck\u2019s experienced defensive side. Matt Simms, Tennessee quarterback and son of former New York Giant great Phil Simms, was overwhelmed by the speed and effectiveness of Oregon, and could only manage a 51 percent completion percentage.\n\nAgainst a team as good as Oregon, a number that low will not get it done no matter what your last name is.\n\nSteven Threet essentially had his worst game in terms of statistics against Wisconsin, and to describe his effort as anything other than admirable would be silly. Threet completed 64 percent of his passes (21-of-33), for 211 yards and no touchdowns. Sure the touchdowns were not there, but as the story has been, missed opportunities in the end zone were the downfall in Madison.\n\nThreet has a 144.80 QB rating on the year, and a number close to that or better is needed this Saturday night versus a team that will be deeply entrenched in BCS Championship talk come December.\n\nIf the Sun Devils are going to have a shot, the game will be won and lost with the leader at quarterback. Another moral victory will do nothing for the Sun Devils heading into three tough road games. A 2-2 record will be all ASU has to show for their performances.\n\nIt is time to win, and nobody knows that more than the two faces in the spotlight: Dennis Erickson on the sidelines and Steven Threet in the shotgun running the offense. Behind Threet\u2019s arm, the offense will have to provide the fireworks to fight punch for punch with the Ducks.\n\nThere is no doubt that this game is going to be entertaining. Even the ASU brass, Erickson included, has been pushing \u201cSun Devil Nation\u201d to come out and fill Sun Devil Stadium. There is no doubt that the fans will get their money\u2019s worth with these two teams playing. The Ducks can put up the points, and this season ASU has done much of the same. Both defenses are top notch, but ASU has struggled with Oregon\u2019s option in the past.\n\nAlthough the scores have been one-sided recently, with Oregon claiming the last five games. Arizona State has not beaten Oregon since Dirk Koetter and Andrew Walter were the faces of Sun Devil football. In 2002, Walter completed one of the greatest comebacks and single game performances in Pac-10 history.\n\nAgainst the very same Oregon Ducks that ASU will face Saturday night, Walter threw for a school-record 536 yards and four touchdowns, and the Sun Devils rallied from a 21-0 second-quarter deficit to win 45-42. Walter did not just beat the Ducks that day in Autzen, but he managed to accomplish that same feat two more times to end his career perfect against Oregon (3-0).\n\nThreet is in a similar mold as Walter, and could be the major difference from a 4-8 team in 2009, and an upper echelon Pac-10 team in 2010. On Saturday night, the Sun Devils will put their team to the test against the best. Can Threet perform his best against the best?\n\nAfter Saturday\u2019s performance at Wisconsin, Threet is in fact the difference for this year\u2019s ASU team. Threet is the missing puzzle piece from a dismal 2009 team, and a team that was ranked ninth in the preseason poll. Nobody was sure if Threet could do the job, or even keep the job through the season.\n\nThree weeks into the season, ASU was back on the national scene last Saturday but came up short against the number 11 team in the nation. Not too bad for a bottom of barrel Pac-10 team, right?\n\nASU dropped another big game, and a loss is all the maroon and gold have to show for it. However, a similar opportunity is in front of them. This Saturday night at home, versus the Ducks is the perfect stage to prove to the naysayers what type of team Arizona State really is.\n\nPrograms are built on statement games, and ASU has been on the short end of the stick on too many occasions. Steven Threet might just be that performer to make a big-time statement in a big-time game for the Sun Devils."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com.au/college-football/news/story?id=4105440", "page_content": "Quarterback Steven Threet, a redshirt freshman who started eight games for Michigan last season, has decided to transfer to Arizona State.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Threet would sit out the 2009 season and have two years of eligibility remaining.\n\nThreet also considered Oregon State but developed a relationship with the Arizona State coaching staff and had an excellent visit over the weekend.\n\nThreet wanted to fit into a pro-style offense after having been previously enrolled at both Georgia Tech and Michigan.

He finished last season 102-of-200 for 1,105 yards, nine touchdowns and seven interceptions.\n\nMichigan signed two quarterbacks, Tate Forcier and Denard Robinson, on National Signing Day on Feb. 5.

Ann Arbor News file photo\n\nFormer Michigan quarterback Steven Threet is one of two candidates for Arizona State's starting quarterback job, according to ESPN.com.\n\nThreet, a junior who has already led a vagabond college football existence, is working with the first team and competing with true sophomore Brock Osweiler. Right now, Threet is working with the first team and generating some buzz.\n\n\"There's no limit to how good he can be,\" linebacker Brandon Magee tells ESPN.com. \"I'm anxious to see how he'll do. On and off the field, I see him as a leader, someone everybody can look up to.\"\n\nHere's the link to the ESPN.com story."}, {"url": "https://www.mlive.com/wolverines/football/2008/10/michigan_quarterback_threet_th.html", "page_content": "University of Michigan quarterback Steven Threet can't stand silence.\n\nWhen he sleeps, two fans whir in the bedroom. When he and roommates Artis Chambers and Vince Helmuth study, \"it's no library environment,\" Helmuth says.Music frequently plays in the background of Threet's life; hip-hop, classic rock, even classical. During his weekday ritual of studying film alone in the Schembechler Hall team room - sometimes until midnight - Threet will sit in front of the big projector screen, remote in hand, wearing headphones.\n\nOn game days, such as today, when Michigan (2-2, 1-0 Big Ten) hosts Illinois (2-2, 0-1), Threet will begin his routine at Michigan Stadium by tossing a ball back and forth with a manager as fans trickle into the venue well before kickoff.\n\nWhile playing catch, Threet may listen to Bob Seger's \"Greatest Hits.\" Or it could be the sounds of a hip-hop artist such as Lil Wayne, T.I. or Jay-Z.\n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\n\u2022 Scouting report: Illinois at Michigan\n\n\u2022 Carty: With loss of civility, everyone loses\n\n\u2022 Q&A: Psych major Dutch has NFL dreams\n\n\u2022 Illinois quarterback Williams a proven playmaker\n\n\u2022 Huron High School receiver Jackson stays home, will play for Michigan\n\n\u2022 Lunch with Heuser: Limiting turnovers critical for U-M against Illinois\n\n\u2022 More Wolverines Football Coverage\n\nWhen the stadium's filled and fans are cheering, Threet \"definitely thrives off it,\" says Helmuth, a Michigan fullback.\n\nIt wasn't cheers, however, the Wolverines heard when they jogged off the field at halftime last Saturday against Wisconsin. Michigan trailed 19-0 and the team's offense had generated 21 total yards.\n\nAs for Threet, \"he had about the worst half I've ever seen a quarterback have,\" Michigan quarterbacks coach Rod Smith says bluntly. Threet completed 2 of 10 passes for minus-7 yards. He had also thrown two interceptions, lost a fumble, but remained unfazed by it all.\n\n\"He wasn't doing well in the first half, obviously,\" offensive tackle Stephen Schilling says. \"But he didn't get down on himself, and none of his teammates got down on him. We stuck with him, kept blocking for him. We knew eventually he'd make the right throws and the right reads and we'd turn it around.\"\n\nWhen Threet and the Wolverines were finished, they had reversed things completely, scoring 27 consecutive points and holding off the then-No. 9-ranked Badgers, 27-25. It was the largest comeback in the 500-game history of Michigan Stadium, and it was directed by a redshirt freshman quarterback who said he never doubted himself.\n\n\"He still fought and scratched and made some plays for us and led us to a victory,\" Smith says.\n\nAdds Gary Gray, a family friend and coach from Adrian, the town where Threet was raised: \"I was more proud of him in the first half than in the second. When things aren't going well, that's when you see what Bubba's really all about.\"\n\nWhiz at memorization\n\nTo family and childhood friends, Threet is better known as Stevie, or more often, Bubba. That nickname started out as Chubba Bubba, Threet says.\n\n\"I was a hefty boy,\" he says, laughing. \"I was a large child. When I slimmed down a little bit it was just Bubba.\"\n\nWhatever he was called, Threet was born into a sporting family on Jan. 2, 1989, the day Michigan beat Southern California in the Rose Bowl.\n\nHis father Jewel played baseball at Adrian College, and coached the Lookouts youth travel baseball team in Lenawee County. Threet's older brother Jay played college baseball, first at Purdue, then at Bowling Green. Sister Krissy was a softball pitcher at Eastern Michigan University.\n\nSteven Threet pitched as well, and played basketball and soccer as an elementary student. Threet always told his parents that football was his favorite sport, however, but he didn't have an opportunity to play until he switched to the Adrian public schools.\n\nIn eighth grade, Threet's middle school football coach asked each boy to list two positions they wanted to play. Jewel Threet joked with his son that they'd make him a lineman. Steven Threet wrote down tight end and quarterback.\n\nThreet tried out for the quarterback job, won it, and soon impressed his coach with his ability to learn the offense.\n\n\"I remember the coach telling me that he was able to know his assignment, everybody else's assignment,\" Jewel Threet says. \"He knew every play, every position. And this was in the eighth grade, and I go, 'That's not surprising.' \"\n\nSteven Threet was a whiz at memorization, easily retaining scriptures he learned at Lenawee Christian School, helping with driving directions years before he turned 16 and excelling in academics. What Threet needed was a better grasp of how to play the quarterback position.\n\n\"I had never played football,\" Jewel Threet says. \"So when Stevie wanted to get serious about it, I had to find someone who could teach him.\"\n\nJewel Threet had ferried Jay to the Detroit area and Krissy to Ann Arbor for pitching lessons. For his youngest son's quarterbacking tutorials, he turned to Ken Calhoun, then the offensive coordinator at Adrian College. He also enlisted Mike Howe, a local conditioning coach, and Gray, a physical therapist by trade who has treated professional athletes such as Mario Lemieux and Dan Marino.\n\nThreet worked on his quickness, agility, change of direction, acceleration, deceleration, the proper way to throw from an off-balance position and more. He trained throughout high school, sometimes working out two or three times a day in the summer.\n\n\"I've never seen a kid work so hard,\" Gray says. \"A lot of times, kids are willing to work on their strengths. But he was willing to work to turn his weaknesses into strengths.\"\n\nLong road to starter\n\nThreet's mom, Pam, had graduated from the University of Michigan, and the family began buying football season tickets in the early 1980s. Pam and Jewel joined the Victors Club, and Jewel traveled to the 1992 and '93 Final Fours to watch the Michigan men's basketball team.\n\nWhen Jay was being recruited by Big Ten baseball programs, he tried to schedule his official visits for fall weekends when the Michigan football team was in town. During Jay's visit to Purdue, Stevie tagged along, wearing his Drew Henson No. 7 jersey.\n\nWhen Jay went to Northwestern, Stevie watched the Wildcats win a wild 54-51 game in 2001.\n\n\"We would be sitting there in their recruiting section, and I would have my Michigan jersey on, cheering for Michigan while my brother was looking at the other school,\" Threet says.\n\nHis Henson jersey and the one with former Michigan tailback Anthony Thomas' No. 32, were tucked away at home when Threet - who grew to be 6-feet, 6-inches tall - began his college career, not in Ann Arbor, but at Georgia Tech. Though Michigan expressed some interest in Threet, the school never offered a scholarship, and signed one of the nation's best high school quarterbacks - Ryan Mallett - to succeed four-year starter Chad Henne.\n\nThreet graduated from high school early as class valedictorian, and enrolled at Georgia Tech in January, 2007. But offensive coordinator Patrick Nix - who had recruited Threet - left almost immediately for Miami. By summer, Threet, too, had decided to leave Atlanta.\n\nOne of those he spoke to about where to go next was Helmuth, a Saline High graduate who had known Threet since middle school.\n\n\"I said: 'Come over here,' \" says Helmuth, who had started classes at Michigan in January 2007, along with Chambers, a safety, and Mallett.\n\nBecause another Michigan quarterback, Jason Forcier, had transferred to Stanford, there was a scholarship available for Threet. He sat out the season per NCAA transfer rules, then saw coach Lloyd Carr retire following Michigan's bowl game.\n\nShortly after Rich Rodriguez took over the program, Mallett - who backed up Henne in 2007 - transferred to Arkansas. When Terrelle Pryor, the nation's No. 1 prep quarterback, picked Ohio State over Michigan earlier this year, Threet and redshirt sophomore Nick Sheridan became the top contenders for the starting job.\n\n\"My goal transferring here was, obviously, to compete for the starting position,\" Threet says. \"I didn't come to sit and watch, that's not the type of person I am. I love to compete.\"\n\nAn instant leader\n\nThreet ultimately won the competition with Sheridan in the season's third game, when he completed 16 of 23 passes for 175 yards at Notre Dame. Threet followed that performance with the outing against Wisconsin, in which he had a 58-yard run, but finished 12 of 31 passing for 96 yards.\n\nMechanically, he still needs some polish, as Threet and his quarterbacks coach readily acknowledge. Threet sometimes plants his feet too wide when he throws the ball, and he tends to lower his release point too much, which can be traced to his baseball-playing days.\n\n\"We've gotta keep getting him fundamentally sound in practice,\" Smith says. \"I don't want him thinking on the game field. I want him reacting. Through the week of practice, when he gets all those reps, that's when he's gotta focus on that and concentrate on his technique.\"\n\nThough Threet's overall numbers aren't pretty - he's not ranked in the top 100 nationally in passing efficiency - Smith is optimistic, noting that it's rare for a such a young player to quarterback a spread offense, which requires him to make multiple decisions quickly on each play.\n\n\"I love his mentality, I love his attitude,\" Smith says. \"The kid wants to work, the kid takes coaching and he doesn't ever question or make excuses for anything, which is why I love him. The second thing is, he showed us all on Saturday there's no quit in that dog right there.\"\n\nAmong an offensive cast that includes a single senior, and has several true freshmen in starting roles, Threet has become an instant leader. He never speaks poorly about anyone, right tackle Stephen Schilling says, noting that Threet's positive attitude and enthusiasm are infectious.\n\n\"The young guys, especially, all look up to him, you can tell,\" Helmuth adds. \"That may be hard to say since we're all big football players, but they ask him for help before they go to anyone else.\n\n\"For a guy that's a freshman to be put in such a big role, nothing has gone to his head. He's still the same Stevie I've known from way back.\"\n\nOr the same Bubba, who wears a Galapagos Island T-shirt given to him by his late grandfather under his uniform; the same fashion-conscious Steven who owns upward of 50 pairs of sneakers he keeps meticulously clean; the same person who possesses other, less tangible, things.\n\n\"He has integrity, he has tremendous passion and character,\" Gray says. \"That's why it's so fantastic to see such a neat kid out there, playing the game he loves. All the hard work has come together for him. Rarely is the world fair. In this case it is.\"\n\nJohn Heuser can be reached at jheuser@annarbornews.com or 734-994-6816."}, {"url": "https://www.annarbor.com/sports/um-football/former-michigan-quarterback-steven-threet-quits-football-because-of-concussions/", "page_content": "Steven Threet's well-traveled football career, which included one season as the starting quarterback at Michigan, is over.\n\nThreet told the Arizona Republic that he has left the Arizona State program because of health concerns associated with the four concussions he suffered over the past five years.\n\nHe is still experiencing headaches and has had trouble sleeping since his last concussion, which occurred against UCLA on Nov. 26.\n\n\"It's extremely hard,\" Threet told the Arizona Republic. \"Obviously, this is a game I love.

File photo\n\nThe season-ending concussion against UCLA was the second of Threet's junior season at Arizona State. The first came on Oct. 23 at California. Previously, Threet suffered concussions his senior year at Adrian High School and in 2008 while playing at Michigan.\n\n\"Doctors have told him a fifth concussion could be debilitating,\" a source told ESPN.com. \"You don't want to be 35 years old and can't hold up a cup of coffee.\"\n\nThreet was recruited by Georgia Tech in 2007 as one of the top 10 quarterback prospects in the nation, but after the coaching staff that recruited him was ushered out, Threet transferred to Michigan.\n\nPer NCAA transfer rules, he sat out the 2007 season.\n\nAt the end of the season, Michigan coach Lloyd Carr retired, and Threet -- at 6-foot-6 and 230 pounds -- wasn\u2019t an ideal fit for new coach Rich Rodriguez\u2019s spread option offense.
