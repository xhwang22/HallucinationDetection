{"Ron Meagher was influenced by the music of the 1950s, including doo-wop, rhythm and blues, and rock and roll.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/art/doo-wop-music", "page_content": "doo-wop, style of rhythm-and-blues and rock-and-roll vocal music popular in the 1950s and \u201960s. The structure of doo-wop music generally featured a tenor lead vocalist singing the melody of the song with a trio or quartet singing background harmony. The term doo-wop is derived from the sounds made by the group as they provided harmonic background for the lead singer.\n\nThe roots of the doo-wop style can be found as early as the records of the Mills Brothers and the Ink Spots in the 1930s and \u201940s. The Mills Brothers turned small-group harmony into an art form when, in many of their recordings, they used their vocal harmony to simulate the sound of string or reed sections. The Ink Spots established the preeminence of the tenor and bass singer as members of the pop vocal ensemble, and their influence can be heard in rhythm-and-blues music beginning in the 1940s (in records by the Ravens), throughout the \u201950s, and well into the \u201970s. This influence is best exhibited in the remakes of the Ink Spots\u2019 hit records \u201cMy Prayer\u201d (1956) by the Platters and \u201cIf I Didn\u2019t Care\u201d (1970) by the Moments. In fact, Motown\u2019s premier male group of the 1960s and \u201970s, the Temptations, had a vocal sound that was based in this classic doo-wop style, with the Ink Spots\u2019 tenor lead singer, Bill Kenny, and bass singer, Hoppy Jones, serving as inspiration for the Temptations\u2019 lead singers, Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin, and their bass singer, Melvin Franklin. There also was a school of female doo-wop, best exemplified by the Chantels, the Shirelles, and Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles.\n\nBritannica Quiz Pop Culture Quiz\n\nThe popularity of doo-wop music among young singers in urban American communities of the 1950s such as New York City, Chicago, and Baltimore, Maryland, was due in large part to the fact that the music could be performed effectively a cappella. Many young enthusiasts in these communities had little access to musical instruments, so the vocal ensemble was the most popular musical performing unit. Doo-wop groups tended to rehearse in locations that provided echoes\u2014where their harmonies could best be heard. They often rehearsed in hallways and high school bathrooms and under bridges; when they were ready for public performance, they sang on stoops and street corners, in community centre talent shows, and in the hallways of the Brill Building. As a result many doo-wop records had such remarkably rich vocal harmonies that they virtually overwhelmed their minimalist instrumental accompaniment. Doo-wop\u2019s appeal for much of the public lay in its artistically powerful simplicity, but this \u201cuncomplicated\u201d type of record also was an ideal, low-budget investment for a small record company to produce. The absence of strings and horns (\u201csweetening\u201d) in their production gave many of the doo-wop records of the early 1950s an almost haunting sparseness. The Orioles\u2019 \u201cWhat Are You Doing New Years Eve?\u201d (1949) and \u201cCrying in the Chapel\u201d (1953), the Harptones\u2019 \u201cA Sunday Kind of Love\u201d (1953), and the Penguins\u2019 \u201cEarth Angel\u201d (1954) are excellent examples of this effect.\n\nAn unfortunate by-product of the poetic simplicity of doo-wop records was that it was relatively easy for major labels to cover (re-record) those records with greater production values (including the addition of strings and horns) and with a different vocal group. Consistent with the racial segregation of much of American society in the 1950s, the practice of major record labels producing cover records usually involved doo-wop records that were originally performed by African-American artists being re-created by white artists, the objective being to sell these covers to a broader, \u201cpop\u201d (white) audience. Among the legion of doo-wop records that suffered this fate were the Chords\u2019 \u201cSh-Boom\u201d (covered by the Crew-Cuts in 1954) and the Moonglows\u2019 \u201cSincerely\u201d (covered by the McGuire Sisters in 1955). A number of white singing groups adopted the doo-wop style\u2014particularly Italian-American ensembles who shared the same urban environment with the African Americans who originated doo-wop. Like the phenomenon of cover records, the advent of the \u201cclean-cut\u201d teen idols who prospered on American Bandstand, and the popularity of blue-eyed soul, this version of doo-wop further exemplified how black music was co-opted by the white recording industry. Prominent practitioners of the \u201cwhite doo-wop\u201d sound were the Elegants (\u201cLittle Star\u201d [1958]), Dion and the Belmonts (\u201cI Wonder Why\u201d [1958]), and the Four Seasons\u2019 (\u201cSherry\u201d [1962]). Ultimately, the musical power of doo-wop has flowed from the original groups through the Motown music of the 1960s and the Philly Sound of the \u201970s and continued into the urban contemporary music of the \u201990s."}, {"url": "https://oxfordre.com/americanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-289", "page_content": "Every year, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland announces nominees for induction and the debate begins again. What is rock and roll? Is it the same thing as rock? Why does the nominating committee repeatedly propose the disco band Chic, only to see them rejected by an electorate more inclined to vote for, as in , hard rockers Deep Purple? How can the hip-hop group N.W.A have been voted in if hip-hop is outside rock and roll altogether? Answers turn on how rock and roll has defined itself\u2014or failed to. Even the spelling is in question: many prefer rock \u2018n\u2019 roll to emphasize, positively or negatively, its unlettered qualities. A prominent disc jockey, arriving in New York City in after success in Cleveland, called his radio show Alan Freed\u2019s Rock and Roll Party. The biggest hit since \u201cWhite Christmas,\u201d providing the opening soundtrack to Blackboard Jungle in , was Bill Haley\u2019s \u201c(We\u2019re Gonna) Rock Around the Clock.\u201d And by , there was a \u201cking\u201d of rock and roll: Elvis Presley, the biggest new pop star of the decade. Rock and roll\u2019s identity was intensely mediated: a DJ\u2019s slang, a movie tie-in, an overnight sensation. Skip ahead fifteen years, to about and the publication of The Sound of the City: The Rise of Rock and Roll, by Charlie Gillett, the first historian of the form but also a young amateur who wrote early drafts for fanzines. Gillett\u2019s generation claimed discursive control over the music they had grown up on. As simply rock, this era spawned its own FM radio, a hippie vision where rock and roll had relied on Top 40. There were rock festivals and arena concerts, headlined in full sets by white male acts like the Rolling Stones, where the more diverse 1950s groups played package tours of short sets. And at rock magazines such as Rolling Stone, writers shared a background with musicians, replacing earlier press incredulity. Make one more jump to the mid-1980s, when artists were first inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and \u201cclassic rock\u201d stations introduced. The best days of rock seemed behind it. The Rolling Stones became their own revivalists. Rolling Stone promised advertisers yuppie readers. Punk rebellion had failed. Spandexed hair metal bands screamed fecklessness to all but their millions of devotees. MTV made new pop icons like Madonna, with synth-driven hits and arguably more visual than musical cleverness\u2014was that rock at all? Rap was emerging: the new leaders, Run-D.M.C., called themselves \u201cKings of Rock.\u201d There would be further chapters in the story but the pattern was set. Rock and roll existed as an ideal\u2014a note to hit, the invocation of an inclusive, pop-leaning American wildness. In its fragmentation, rock remained more identifiable, but compromised and in decline. Yet no forms of popular music, if you could put Humpty together again, were bigger in appeal or in influence on performers.\n\nRock and Roll is Here to Stay: The 1950s It took almost a decade for rock and roll\u2019s musical arrival to translate. The sound was fixed by Los Angeles, as Roy Brown, renaming the jump blues of Louis Jordan, wrote and performed \u201cGood Rocking Tonight.\u201d Brown\u2019s small combo fused blues chords, jazz riffs, dance beats, and pop song structure into a party on wax that made the race records charts. Wynonie Harris\u2019s cover version topped those charts in , as WDIA in Memphis became the first black-oriented radio station. In , Billboard renamed race records rhythm and blues (R&B), the format that most birthed rock and roll. Elvis Presley, a teenage southern white and WDIA listener nonetheless, covered Harris\u2019s cover for Memphis independent Sun Records in . When he sang \u201clet\u2019s rock,\u201d rock and roll became an identity beyond music. Most Americans didn\u2019t register that, or Presley, until .1 To bring that about, a few things happened in tandem as technology changed music, recording, and distribution. Instruments electrified, particularly guitar, with sounds that had been background now in lead roles. Magnetic recording made it easier to edit studio work and highlight, even exaggerate, effects, from guitar solos to the taunting twitches in Presley\u2019s vocals. Records increasingly came in two sizes, with 78 RPMs replaced by longer playing albums on 33 and the rock and roll and indie label choice, singles, on 45. Playing singles were radio stations that relied on disc jockeys spinning records, with network feeds increasingly lost to television. 2 These developments brought prominence to styles and audiences long considered marginal. The music of black and white southerners, divided into separate categories by record companies, overlapped stylistically. In the postwar era, R&B found a counterpart in the electrified country of honkytonk and western swing. \u201cRocket 88,\u201d a R&B chart-topper on Sun by Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats (including Ike Turner and a \u201cfuzz guitar\u201d solo caused by a busted amp), was covered in a similar fashion by Bill Haley and the Saddlemen for country fans, as Haley began the merger popularized with \u201cRock Around the Clock.\u201d R&B and hillbilly boogie shared more than songs. Each amplified the lives of working class people with loose bills and loosened rules, moving north and to urban or suburban streets in a Great Migration for white as much as black southerners. Each recorded for independents like Sun, proliferating in the postwar boom.3 If rock and roll rose on technological advances and the emboldened position of black and white working classes, its assimilation fed on changes in middle-class suburban America, where prosperity joined with Cold War fears in an era of domestic \u201ccontainment\u201d\u2014younger marriages, a baby boom, and the nuclear family as resistance to communism.4 Suburban sterility is often summed up in rock history through the most dreaded pop hit of all: Patti Page\u2019s \u201cDoggie in the Window.\u201d Singing primly\u2014though the contemporary tracking let her harmonize with herself\u2014about a puppy, heard yipping in rhythm, Page was all rock and rollers opposed. Listeners chose a different canine, Presley\u2019s \u201cHound Dog,\u201d whose roots and routes modeled rock and roll diversity. Songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller were young Jews enthralled by black pop. The original R&B hit was produced by Johnny Otis, born Ioannis Alexandres Veliotesa to Greek immigrants, who \u201cpassed\u201d in Los Angeles for black. Alabama-born singer Big Mama Thornton dressed as a man, presenting a transgressive sexuality. Houston record label, Peacock, was a black-owned independent. Presley\u2019s later version built on a comic parody; Freddie Bell and the Bellboys did white takes on R&B in Las Vegas lounges. But the joke was at first on Presley, a former truck driver, when rock and roll hating New York TV host Steve Allen had him don black tie to sing \u201cHound Dog\u201d to an actual basset. Furious, Presley recorded \u201cHound Dog\u201d the next day, turning Thornton\u2019s gender blur into class outrage: \u201cyou said you were high class, but that was just a lie.\u201d The result topped pop, R&B, and country charts alike.5 The gender, class, and regional contrasts between \u201cDoggie in the Window\u201d and \u201cHound Dog\u201d were less discussed than race and propriety in the \u201cleerics\u201d and \u201cbig beat\u201d preoccupations of 1950s pop commentary. But they mattered, just as it did that older star Frank Sinatra, an Italian American steeped in jazz, Broadway standards, and leftist Popular Front culture, hated both songs as infantile, responding with adult pop albums and a dissolute Rat Pack persona. Swinging cosmopolitanism blended immigrant and Harlem New York hustle, jazz band brass, movie and radio star intimacy. But formations of American music moved away from this Tin Pan Alley and show business nexus. The rocking newcomers were younger, overtly southern and black in ways that registered as raw, less professional.6 To offer examples from the Rock Hall roster: Little Richard\u2019s falsetto-tinged, piano-banged, former gay bar anthem, \u201cTutti Frutti,\u201d defined rock and roll wildness, though Jerry Lee Lewis was a hillbilly (now \u201crockabilly\u201d) rival. The shrewd lyrics and guitar licks of Chuck Berry\u2019s \u201cMaybellene\u201d created the rock and roll singer-songwriter, as did Buddy Holly\u2019s younger, whiter, and nerdier anthems. Fats Domino gave a face to New Orleans rhythms, the roll in rock and roll. Ray Charles and Johnny Cash were genius synthesizers of Americana, Etta James the greatest female rocker of the period. The Drifters and Frankie Lymon\u2019s Teenagers were early boy bands, doo wop fashioning rock and roll of nonsense syllables and romantic hyperbole.7 Structurally, though, rock and roll was unsound. Its home was Top 40 radio, happy with hits of any kind: Pat Boone covering Little Richard, Fabian as teen pinup promoted on Dick Clark\u2019s afternoon TV show American Bandstand. Artists had little control over mercurial careers: Presley was drafted, steered by his manager; Little Richard left pop for religion; Berry found himself imprisoned on racist sex charges; Lewis became ostracized for marrying a young second cousin; Holly died in a plane crash on a flimsy package tour. In an era of burgeoning civil rights, rock and roll embodied new racial freedoms more than it could articulate them explicitly. Many fans moved on as they hit college. Perhaps, some thought, it had all just been a fad.8\n\nYou Say You Want a Revolution: Rock in the 1960s In the Beatles arrived in America, taking over Top 40 in a British Invasion. Much had happened earlier in the decade: a folk craze, girl groups and Beach Boys, Motown Records, the Twist. But Beatlemania was a rock and roll revival. \u201cNothing really affected me until Elvis,\u201d John Lennon said, and the Fab Four used an Ed Sullivan TV appearance to become iconic much as Presley had. \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand\u201d was not the message: that transmitted when the music surged in pace and girls in Sullivan\u2019s audience screamed and took over the camera.9 Unlike before, this 1960s incarnation of rock and roll matured. Taking a critique of mass culture from the musical pilgrims assembled at the Newport Folk Festival, it became a rock counterculture gathered less earnestly at Monterey in and Woodstock in . The Beatles no longer performed live; they made increasingly complex albums. Songs like \u201cStrawberry Fields Forever,\u201d with its Indian instruments and backwards tape effects, used the multitrack recording studio\u2014and unlimited budget\u2014to produce a blockbuster product with an artsy feel, alluding to psychedelic drug experience without much concealment.10 Formal experimentation, social experimentation, and big business carved rock from rock and roll. The Rolling Stones, named for a Muddy Waters song, formed in London of shared kinship for blues, pursuing non-pop lineages. \u201cSatisfaction\u201d in poked fun at advertising even as it conquered commercial-laden U.S. Top 40. \u201cStreet Fighting Man\u201d answered Motown\u2019s \u201cDancing in the Streets,\u201d accompanying protests at the Democratic convention. In , the Stones topped the charts with \u201cHonky Tonk Women,\u201d which nodded to country and blues in its title and sound, then sex and drugs in a lyric allowed airplay: \u201cshe blew my nose and then she blew my mind.\u201d That year, the group toured America, propagating a rock culture built around communal yet commercial gathering.11 The most consequential rocker of the decade barely played rock and roll. Bob Dylan, whose early \u201cSong to Woody,\u201d for folksinger Woody Guthrie, made the cross-generational claim the Stones did with Waters, was known for poetic anthems, both collective (\u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind\u201d) and personal (\u201cMr. Tambourine Man\u201d). But when the Beatles rekindled rock and roll he found \u201cTambourine Man\u201d charting in a \u201cfolk-rock\u201d version by the Byrds and readied his own electric reinvention, \u201cLike a Rolling Stone.\u201d A number 2 hit despite exceeding six minutes, the anthem\u2019s influence was deregulatory: pop structures were optional, lyrics could be obscure, an unpolished voice had broad appeal. Dylan\u2019s persona redefined the singer-songwriter to represent the most college-educated cohort in American history.12 Rock differed from rock and roll because it meant albums alongside singles, counterculture over youth culture. By the triumphs of Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin at the Monterey Pop Festival, rare examples of alternatives to white men in lead roles, major record labels understood that rock\u2019s sales and status dwarfed other music. Finishing what Sinatra and adult pop from Ray Charles to West Side Story started, rockers demanded creative freedom. Rock, a mainstream commercial form, positioned itself as anti-commercial or at least \u201cauthentic\u201d: built around either the romantic authenticity of personal and communal experience or the modernist authenticity of newness and experiment. Whereas rock and roll\u2019s popularity in the 1950s led to the music becoming softer, rock\u2019s led to the music becoming louder: a response to violent times and the Vietnam draft, technology letting city-sized audiences hear every sustained note.13 Rock and roll lacked structural support, but rock had foundations in radio, touring, media, and urban neighborhoods. FM radio became the home for rock channels that began as stoned sounding \u201cunderground\u201d or \u201cfree form\u201d stations. Woodstock and Altamont were poorly organized music festivals, but the crowds they drew demonstrated the commercial potential of more organized tours. And the underground press of the era was funded by record industry advertisements and other merchants participating in what became known as \u201cHip Capitalism.\u201d Rolling Stone magazine, in particular, a countercultural newspaper when it began in the hippie Bay Area, empowered a new creature, the rock critic, to argue over the meaning of the music, past and present. San Francisco itself, a bohemian haven earlier for the Beat poetry scene in North Beach, the most important of the Pacifica public radio stations (KPFA), and the writing of culture critics such as music\u2019s Ralph Gleason and film\u2019s Pauline Kael, became the American city that most defined the new rock sensibility, as the Haight-Ashbury district hosted the summer of love in and brought the Jefferson Airplane, Grateful Dead, and Joplin to prominence. 14 Still, as the 1960s ended, rock\u2019s revolutionary moment passed. Star deaths from drug use (Hendrix, Joplin, Jim Morrison) proved the risks of new mores. Divides separated younger audiences who sought hard rock and former folkies who favored singer-songwriter messages. Undergrounds began to appear, with influential recordings like the Velvet Underground\u2019s \u201cHeroin\u201d set at the fringe. Black fans and performers used rock notions to redefine R&B as soul and funk\u2014they had to, shut out from rock\u2019s definition as art even as James Brown\u2019s rhythmic changes were the decade\u2019s most revolutionary. This era dominates discussion of rock\u2019s peak, yet it was really only a few short years\u2014the length, say, of a college education.15\n\nArenas and Formats: Rock in the 1970s Cultural memory of rock in the 1970s has been framed through movies. Cameron Crowe looked back on his youth profiling bands for Rolling Stone in Almost Famous. Richard Linklater recalled his Texas high school in Dazed & Confused. Both films show how widely rock values proliferated by the middle of the decade: high school as much as college, middle and working class, stoners and jocks, boys and girls, with the music supporting sex and drug uses that felt, somehow, innocent. Rock bands became akin to deities. Crowe recreates Led Zeppelin\u2019s leonine lead singer, Robert Plant, announcing \u201cI am a golden God!\u201d in a wasted moment.16 Rock was now an industry, fit for arenas and stadiums everywhere. Major label executives, notably David Geffen (who would become a billionaire in the process), made Southern California the geographic center for record labels and rock the core genre of pop. Rockers like Zeppelin and Grand Funk Railroad, criticized by critics and countercultural listeners as unprogressive, used the improved execution (stacked amplifiers, lighting to separate band from audience, reliable security) to showcase rock bigness as a triumph unto itself. \u201cCock rock,\u201d as some called it, rooted in the working-class masculinity that connected electrified R&B and honkytonk country. But this version, the swagger and long guitar solos of anthems like \u201cWhole Lotta Love,\u201d or ballads like \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d saluted with lit cigarette lighters, let a young, white, male-dominated counterculture cross class lines. Marketing it was the 18\u201234 year-old male-focused format of rock radio, AOR (album-oriented rock), geared to play arena rock\u2019s warhorses constantly, fetishistically.17 Singer-songwriters emerged as no less commercially dominant, especially in album sales, creating a middle of the road soft rock known on radio by as \u201cadult contemporary.\u201d From Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s Bridge over Troubled Water and Carole King\u2019s Tapestry, the biggest albums ever to that point, to the mellow James Taylor and Jackson Browne or arena groups with akin sensibilities like Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles, singer-songwriters connected more to 1960s values than hard rockers. Their key subject, feminism and altered gender notions, used rock\u2019s literacy and middle-class formal address to normalize social change as new bourgeois identity: contemporary casual, laid-back but still wealthy.18 The decade was a golden age for the artistic LP: Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Bruce Springsteen, and David Bowie, among others, explored changing taste and behavior in ways both intensely personal and commercially public, with supportive major labels. Those that critic Robert Christgau called \u201csemipopular\u201d performers, such as poet Leonard Cohen or sardonic balladeer Randy Newman, found stable perches too. Rock critics, who had emerged in underground publications at first, now held staff positions at daily newspapers and magazines; they reinforced the discourse that treated rock more as a new art form than an ephemeral commodity, with books from The Sound of the City to Greil Marcus\u2019s soon hallowed Mystery Train and the critical collection, The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll, sealing in a narrative.19 In emphasizing artistic control, albums, splashy staging, and commercial anti-commercialism, rock shaped other categories. Soul and funk musicians recorded landmark albums and staged concerts akin to arena rock; some, like Aretha Franklin and Stevie Wonder, reached rock fans, but most, like Maze or the Ohio Players, did not. Bob Marley, symbol of Third World Black Nationalism, was groomed to Dylan dimensions by label head Chris Blackwell. In country, outlaw figures like Willie Nelson, who rejected Nashville for more countercultural Austin, created a \u201credneck rock\u201d hybrid; southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Allman Brothers stressed regional pride. Salsa musicians, New Yorkers with roots from Puerto Rico to Panama, provocatively reinvented Latin music. Rock even affected newer classical: Einstein on the Beach resembled the Who\u2019s rock opera Tommy.20 Ultimately, though, the corporate 1970s version of rock counterculture smashed up as the decade progressed, like the United States and United Kingdom overall. Competing for the title of the biggest rock album of the decade was Pink Floyd\u2019s Dark Side of the Moon, a stoned vision that new teens found endlessly fascinating, keeping it in Billboard\u2019s charts for 741 weeks between and . \u201cArt rock,\u201d or \u201cprogressive rock,\u201d was rock quite distant from rock and roll. A revival movement, punk, started in New York around the nightclub CBGB, its most influential band the loud, fast, dumb acting Ramones, whose \u201cBlitzkrieg Bop\u201d compared arena shows to Nazi rallies. In London, an angry young man scrawled I Hate across his Pink Floyd shirt, took the name Johnny Rotten, and began British punk singing for the Sex Pistols. When Presley died in , critic Lester Bangs eulogized not the King but rock and roll, now too fragmented to connect races, classes, regions, or tastes.21 If punk offered a backlash against mainstream rock, disco suffered a backlash led by mainstream rock. The dance craze, with its cross-racial appeal, Top 40 hits, and coded gay content (akin to Elton John in pop, Queen in arena rock, glam and Bowie as subculture), recalled earlier rock and roll. But not rock, whose AOR fans, outraged when heroes like the Rolling Stones \u201cwent disco\u201d or radio stations switched to disco formats, gleefully destroyed disco records at a rally led by a rock DJ. Disco survived, as club music, as MTV pop, even as new wave in conjunction with rock. Mainstream rock, though, a caricature in punk attacks and its own disco attacks, never recovered its progressive image. Commercially successful rock now seemed compromised. The hallowed years of rock were behind it.22\n\nThriller or Destruction? Pop and Rock in the 1980s While Bruce Springsteen achieved global superstardom with his Born in the U.S.A. album, and Irish rockers U2 joined the select ranks of arena bands categorized as formally and politically progressive, most 1980s rock registered as a retread, too regressive or obscure. Boomer rockers sang for charity in \u201cWe Are the World\u201d and Live Aid; fans like Tipper Gore started organizations like the PMRC (Parents\u2019 Music Resource Council) to decry youth trends. Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner inaugurated a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame whose inductions, beginning in (the museum opened in Cleveland a decade later), ratified the rock view of pop history. Compact disc reissues enriched catalogs, promoted by classic rock radio stations.23 Yet the 1980s were also among the best for rock and roll, to use that rubric for diverse, challenging youth-pop. Cable channel MTV launched in , playing music videos as a rock radio equivalent with few black artists. But quickly, British new wave bands like Duran Duran, Culture Club, and Eurythmics\u2014style conscious, gender bending, postmodern, preferring synthesizer to guitar\u2014supplied the visuals and spark MTV required. Next, Michael Jackson, followed by Prince and Madonna\u2014none white men\u2014built superstar personas on MTV, now Top 40. With videos, album promotions could stretch over years, each new short extending the performer\u2019s star text. Rockers Dire Straits had the blue-collar protagonist of \u201cMoney for Nothing\u201d homophobically complain, as if protesting disco: \u201cSee the little faggot with the earring and the makeup \u2026 that ain\u2019t working.\u201d If, as with rock and roll in the 1950s, MTV encouraged a cross-racial youth culture, this Reagan-era iteration was no celebration of working-class culture, at least at first.24 Instead, the new superstars subsumed group identity as they rose. Jackson, once of Motown\u2019s Jackson 5, triumphed solo with Thriller on Epic, validating major label R&B; the album made James Brown grooves central to Top 40, turned videos into blockbuster musical theater, and deployed rockers like Paul McCartney and Eddie Van Halen. Accused of abandoning blacks for crossover, Jackson more staged a coup: from Elvis as king of rock and roll to a new \u201cKing of Pop.\u201d Prince, his rival, connected R&B mastery to guitar chops and motorbike rebellion on the album/film Purple Rain, redefining rock virtuosity in the decade that saw a Black Rock Coalition form. Madonna, sonically disco and chart pop, used video\u2019s funhouse mirroring of original songs to insert third wave feminist comment on \u201cMaterial Girl\u201d gender assumptions. \u201cHound Dog\u201d had touted liberation (working class, male, white-from-black sources) from the mainstream \u201cDoggie in the Window.\u201d \u201cLike a Prayer,\u201d \u201cThriller,\u201d and \u201cWhen Doves Cry\u201d presented racial and gender alternatives to the white-male rock posturing, now itself mainstream, of \u201cStairway to Heaven,\u201d \u201cDream On,\u201d and \u201cFree Bird.\u201d Was this pop a new rock and roll? Superstar freedoms compensated for weakened group identity in the inequitable 1980s. Michael Jackson dominated alongside Michael Jordan but for African Americans as a whole, an \u201cunderclass\u201d experience of crack epidemic, mass incarceration, and social separation later called the New Jim Crow locked in. Madonna\u2019s intimacies matched Oprah\u2019s but feminists experienced what Susan Faludi called a Backlash: the rejection of the Equal Rights Amendment and Moral Majority anti-feminism.25 From a new sounds perspective, rap was the decade\u2019s rock and roll: a radicalizing of the pop voice to favor rhythm and timbre over melody, upending taste yet again: \u201cnot bad meaning bad but bad meaning good,\u201d as Run-D.M.C. put it. Indie labels again led the way, notably Def Jam, operated by Run\u2019s brother Russell Simmons. Rappers came out of New York City to start but were national by the end of the decade, notably N.W.A in Los Angeles. Unlike rock and roll, whites rarely coopted hip-hop, as its larger form was increasingly called. At its most idealistic, from the politics of Public Enemy to visionaries like rapper Rakim, it represented a new soul. At its most pragmatic, N.W.A\u2019s gangsta rap crime narratives, it had bullet-proof authenticity, rebranding the most disparaging word of all: to represent among Niggaz Wit Attitudes was to occupy an identity no white could claim.26 Still, white and black working-class experiences continued to parallel; N.W.A. found its Los Angeles counterpart in sexually confrontational (\u201cturn around bitch\u201d) rock group Guns N\u2019 Roses. GNR were the last in a wave of Sunset Strip bands, from Van Halen to M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, mocked as hair metal by outsiders for their manes, make-up and spandex, yet belligerent in their partying, cartoonishly anti-authoritarian (\u201cWe\u2019re Not Gonna Take It\u201d). For fans, metal extended arena rock\u2019s Dazed & Confused ethos. And the bands were pop savvy, slipping in synths and glossy production, using MTV more strategically than Dire Straits predicted. They needed cable: rock radio splintered over metal, which did not draw those advertisers preferred. Classic rock radio added few new songs. Modern rock radio, built on new wave, had a marginal audience share sold as more affluent.27 If rock in the 1970s had created space for adventurous albums, 1980s trends favored more postmodern blends: downtown art scene figures like Talking Heads, Paul Simon\u2019s NPR-friendly African music album Graceland, parodic television like The Simpsons, the rocker as director (David Lynch), computer programmer (Steve Jobs and Apple, named after the Beatles\u2019 holding company), or television host (David Letterman). Experimental rock from groups like H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, the Replacements, and Sonic Youth relied on independent labels, now not expecting to create Top 40 hits, establishing sustainable touring club-level networks in conjunction with college radio stations. Scene leaders R.E.M. compared their status to illicit \u201cRadio Free Europe.\u201d Metal aside, rock rarely enjoyed the crossover thrill of rock and roll.28\n\nCommodifying Dissent in the 1990s The blockbuster products of set the tone for the decade\u2019s reuniting of rock with rock and roll. Metallica\u2019s self-titled \u201cblack\u201d album, the biggest of the bunch, joined metal and punk for working-class listeners who no longer believed in a utopic \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d or even hair metal glamor. Pearl Jam and Nirvana\u2019s albums, major label versions of a Seattle grunge scene centered on the indie label Sub Pop, worked the same punk-metal fusion for middle-class listeners within the creative capitalism that nurtured Microsoft, Amazon, and Starbucks. And the industry marveled at the first Lollapalooza tour, which revealed a new rock and roll hybrid: alternative rock and hip-hop acts sharing the stage for a pierced and tattooed post-boomer audience, dubbed Generation X.29 Grunge, gangsta rap, and New Country all claimed a large, engaged audience in the early 1990s, inheriting parts of rock\u2019s mantle. Top 40 declined, crossover less necessary given these expanded segments. It was the return of counterculture, if with blatant sponsorship and major labels that struck deals with Sub Pop or hip-hop\u2019s Death Row, incorporating indie and street marketing into global corporations: only one major was now American owned. Rock radio resumed playing new music. R&B incorporated hip-hop as figures like Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg hosted a groupie-filled party that resembled hair metal. Garth Brooks sold more albums, collectively, than anybody in the decade with an arena country that included Billy Joel and Aerosmith covers but no pop hits. Rolling Stone had magazine rivals in Spin (for alt-rock) and Vibe (for hip-hop and R&B).30 Once again, the revolutionary period proved short-lived. Notably, in the 1990s commercial popularity became an issue to an extent not seen before. In , Nirvana leader Kurt Cobain, a heroin addict, killed himself in a tragedy viewed as reflecting his struggles with popularity; Pearl Jam stopped making videos and scaled back their ambitions. The murders of rival West and East Coast rappers Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. in and raised similar questions about the commodified rebellion of hip-hop. Brooks, like actual crossover country figures Shania Twain and Billy Ray Cyrus, found his popularity raising hackles among fans used to stars not getting above their raising.31 A second key 1990s shift was that rock put women more front and center. If very male grunge claimed the spotlight, rock critiques launching from the riot grrrl scene just south in Olympia, Washington, were no less pivotal: Bikini Kill\u2019s Kathleen Hanna gave Cobain the phrase \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit\u201d and he saw his breakout as a blend of the two movements; in a different blend, Sleater-Kinney, another riot grrrl band, and grunge\u2019s Pearl Jam became the region\u2019s most lasting rockers, if at different levels of popularity. Commercially, Alanis Morissette\u2019s Jagged Little Pill rivaled grunge and Metallica with an anthem, \u201cYou Oughta Know,\u201d whose lyrics (\u201cIs she perverted like me?/Would she go down on you in a theater?\u201d) combined \u201cHonky Tonk Women\u201d and Madonna: a woman\u2019s rock not pop. Songwriter Diane Warren dominated adult contemporary, while performer Sheryl Crow had \u201cHot AC\u201d hits; this younger category aimed at women as rock listeners supported Hootie and the Blowfish, Gin Blossoms, and others. New Country, from Twain to the Dixie Chicks, saw what one hit called \u201cgirls with guitars\u201d chart higher than before or since. Lilith Fair offered a women\u2019s music version of Lollapalooza.32 All of this made the contrast to hard rock and hip-hop masculinity striking. New arena rock, as the 1990s ended, was still dominated by a metal-punk fusion that now added hip-hop elements, recognizing the working-class commonalities. This could take a radical form: Rage Against the Machine played against the World Trade Organization protests of . But the \u201cnu-metal\u201d of groups like Limp Bizkit and Korn was interpreted as a new low in rock\u2019s now long history of reactionary rage; Woodstock \u201999, an anniversary concert, saw male fans attacking female spectators in a spectacle that electronic rocker Moby dubbed \u201crape rock.\u201d Hip-hop success, meanwhile, centered on black street credibility that included referring to women as bitches and \u201choes.\u201d Differing takes on these intersectional modalities were inevitable: academics started to rethink the narrative of rock and roll as deliverance from prejudice, reaching back to 19th-century blackface minstrelsy, viewing identity as performed, and contextualizing through cultural studies.33 Many who loved music recoiled from rock and rap altogether by the end of the 1990s. Pop resurged on MTV\u2019s afternoon program Total Request Live, where boy bands (Backstreet Boys, N\u2019Sync) and pop princesses (Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera) vied for audience votes. Global fans awaited each release, with influential writer-producers coming out of Sweden, most prominently Max Martin, and a flurry of Latin superstars: Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin, and Shakira. Jive Records, home to many TRL acts, sold for $3 billion in , the most ever paid for a label. Yet the performers seemed as tame as the manufactured stars Dick Clark once introduced on American Bandstand. Many had started on Disney\u2019s New Mickey Mouse Club. Could a Spears, asserting sexuality in ways that resembled Madonna, be viewed as third wave feminist when she seemed so much less in control of her career? Was Memphis\u2019s Justin Timberlake a new Elvis figure? Few said yes.34 Collegiate genres at decade\u2019s end also looked to get away from rock and rap. Electronica, extending the legacy of disco, gave rockers a non-guitar palette: bands big as Radiohead and Daft Punk explored this direction; arenas became sites for dancing. Rootsier sounds, sometimes called alt-country and eventually Americana, kept the guitars but lost any connection to metal and almost any to punk. Even swing jazz enjoyed a momentary revival, alongside lounge exotica. Within hip-hop culture, a bohemian movement sometimes called neo-soul (Erykah Badu, D\u2019Angelo, OutKast) questioned gangsta posturing. The most rock thing to do, as a half-century of rock and roll concluded, was often to not rock out at all.35\n\nRock in a New Century: Recent Developments Nothing defined rock and roll\u2019s legacy in the early 21st century better than the mash-up: two records, vocals from one with backing tracks of the other, merged on a home computer by an amateur producer who posted an MP3 for downloading. Beyond records, mash-ups combined genres and formats: early on, Top 40 singer Christina Aguilera\u2019s \u201cGenie in a Bottle\u201d and alt-rock band the Strokes\u2019 \u201cHard to Explain,\u201d became \u201cA Stroke of Genius\u201d by Freelance Hellraiser. If rock and roll had married R&B, country, and Top 40, mash-ups stitched a new hybridity. Technology dissolved requirements of production studios and distribution networks. Whether social boundaries would fade so easily was a harder question.36 This latter sense, that mash-ups mixed people as much as the genres that divided them in the rock era, informed Glee, which aired on Fox in the 2000s, often after American Idol. The glee club teacher used mash-ups to heal race, gender, class, and disability: \u201cthe big difference between them is what makes them great,\u201d he explained. Glee itself, like Idol, was a mash-up\u2014the TV show and pop industry combined as part of what Henry Jenkins called \u201cconvergence culture,\u201d old media meeting new, like the video games Guitar Hero and Rock Band too, like making a vintage rock and roll jukebox or Top 40 playlist out of the shuffle button on one\u2019s brand new Apple iPod. Glee\u2019s first anthem was a cover of Journey\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019,\u201d a power ballad that old school rockers might have dismissed as cheesy. In this century, it made as much sense as Barry Manilow covers on Idol. The older rock walls between types of music cultures had come down; not as rock and roll tearing them down but dissolved with a karaoke singer\u2019s grin.37 Crossover seemed vital again: if the 1990s were troubled that everything could be commodified, no matter how marginal, the 2000s worried that nothing could be sold, no matter how mainstream. Napster, the illicit file sharing technology, and successors like Bit Torrent, made it impossible to keep recordings proprietary: album sales collapsed, with only rare performers (Taylor Swift, Adele) subsequently able to enjoy big totals. The shattered model of the record industry prompted artists to become brands unto themselves, reliant on their own convergence culture\u2014sponsorships, connections to other media. Reality television and tabloid celebrity nurtured aspects of pop. Billboard charts came to reflect songs streamed from YouTube, a video site that provided hits on demand and let fans upload their versions, which counted too. Records, as a distillation of culture, gave way to broader media exposure and overlapping social networks.38 To consider major figures of this century, with notions of rock and roll or rock in mind, shows how confusingly remixed they\u2019d become. Rapper Jay-Z called himself \u201cthe new Sinatra,\u201d took swagger and Chairman of the Board savvy from rock into hip-hop. Kanye West emphasized the rocker as provocateur, making ambitious albums that intertwined bohemian neo-soul, indie experimentalism, hip-hop bravado, and synergistic promotion. Beyonc\u00e9 calibrated her tabloid crossover, with \u201cSingle Ladies\u201d a YouTube parody favorite. She also, one night on iTunes, with a single tweet as promotion, released an album of songs accompanied by videos, the artistry updating Prince\u2019s standard of virtuosity. Taylor Swift, a confessional singer-songwriter, moved from country to Top 40, building working womanhood and a rock and roll echo of riot grrrl on 1990s paradigms. Adele, who after the death of Amy Winehouse inherited the British Invasion tradition, broke record sales records as an Adult Contemporary singer of relatable experience and a soulful tone.39 If the blockbuster performer as CEO was one pop response to shattered business models, another was a resurgence of Top 40 culture as catch-all, a global pop of mashed-up identities\u2014Black Eyed Peas, Bruno Mars. The radio format itself boomed in the 2000s, as PPM (Portable People Meter) devices proved the popularity of eclectic hits presentations over ostensibly targeted approaches; the Jack format, an oldies blend impish about genre lines, was another version. What the 1970s had called disco, the 1980s house and techno, and the 1990s electronica was now EDM, or electronic dance music, which began registering hits that mashed up celebrity singers with influential live DJs. Critics started calling themselves poptimists and criticizing as rockism attempts to essentialize great music.40 At times, the results were unpredictable and exciting\u2014a new rock and roll. A billion people globally checked out Psy\u2019s madcap video for \u201cGangnam Style\u201d and contemplated the Motown-in-Asia spectacles of K-Pop. Lady Gaga drew upon MTV traditions of superstar spectacle to create post-postmodernism. Rappers making \u201crhythmic Top 40\u201d dance hits fostered a half-decade of the blackest pop programming in years, perhaps ever. At other times, popular music\u2019s mash-up approach to history registered as too haphazard to create a lasting impact. American Idol fell into a rut of electing \u201cWGWGs\u201d (white guys with guitars) the winner. Top 40 stopped allowing R&B hits to cross to its top positions altogether. One tried to remember the last time a rocker had felt as central to the culture as Kurt Cobain. What were the collective stories of this new era?41 Yet the impact of rock and roll and rock, however reconstituted, remained massive. The biggest touring acts were rock derived, the subformats of rock on radio, added together, eclipsed other genres, and so did rock album sales\u2014both new and catalog material. The indie networks of the 1980s that fed neoliberal creative corporations of the 1990s now remade neighborhoods in Brooklyn, East Nashville, or Portland around the hipster ethos of bands covered in Pitchfork or playing festivals like Coachella and Bonnaroo. As social networks went berserk rehashing Beyonc\u00e9 or Kanye, the Black Lives Matter-inspired masterpiece by rapper Kendrick Lamar (To Pimp a Butterfly), or that goofy new Drake video, it seemed apparent, if largely unspoken, that the major inheritors of cultural ambitions distilled from rock and roll into rock were African Americans. This represented a shift three generations in the making, just as the boldest explorers of messy rock and roll were now women.42 For about a century, once, the minstrel songs and show business ethos that cast a spell from Stephen Foster to \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d ruled American music. It seems likely that we are in the tail end of a second century, from Elvis Presley and Top 40 to the Beatles and rock, from rock and roll to hip-hop and EDM, the double imperatives of crossover and authenticity structuring a dialectic with new chapters every decade or so. Rock and roll\u2019s revolution is too unstable; rock\u2019s far too stable; the players and issues change but the back and forth continues to fascinate."}, {"url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/the-50s-a-decade-of-music-that-changed-the-world-229924/", "page_content": "For some of us, it began late at night: huddled under bedroom covers with our ears glued to a radio pulling in black voices charged with intense emotion and propelled by a wildly kinetic rhythm through the after-midnight static. Growing up in the white-bread America of the Fifties, we had never heard anything like it, but we reacted, or remember reacting, instantaneously and were converted. We were believers before we knew what it was that had so spectacularly ripped the dull, familiar fabric of our lives. We asked our friends, maybe an older brother or sister. We found out that they called it rock & roll. It was so much more vital and alive than any music we had ever heard before that it needed a new category: Rock & roll was much more than new music for us. It was an obsession, and a way of life.\n\nFor some of us, it began a little later, with our first glimpse of Elvis on the family television set. But for those of us growing up in the Fifties, it didn\u2019t seem to matter how or where we first heard the music. Our reactions were remarkably uniform. Here, we knew, was a sonic cataclysm come bursting (apparently) out of nowhere, with the power to change our lives forever. Because it was obviously, inarguably our music. If we had any initial doubt about that, our parents\u2019 horrified \u2014 or at best dismissive \u2014 reactions banished those doubts. Growing up in a world we were only beginning to understand, we had finally found something for us: for us together, for us alone.\n\nBut where did it come from? How did it get started? Thirty-five-odd years after rock & roll first burst upon us in all its glory, we still don\u2019t have a simple, definitive answer to these questions. Of course, they are trick questions. Where you think rock & roll came from and how you think it grew depend on how you define rock & roll.\n\nFats Domino, the most amiable and pragmatic of the first-generation rock & roll stars, was asked about the music\u2019s origins in a Fifties television interview. \u201cRock & roll is nothing but rhythm & blues,\u201d he responded with characteristic candor, \u201cand we\u2019ve been playing it for years down in New Orleans.\u201d This is a valid statement: All Fifties rockers, black and white, country born and city bred, were fundamentally influenced by R&B, the black popular music of the late Forties and early Fifties. R&B was a catchall rubric for the sound of everything from stomping Kansas City swing bands to New York street-corner vocal groups to scrappy Delta and Chicago blues bands. As far as Fats Domino was concerned, rock & roll was simply a new marketing strategy for the style of music he had been recording since 1949. But what about the rest of the Fifties rock front-runners?\n\nWhen we get down to cases, we find that several of the most distinctive and influential rock & roll performers of the mid-Fifties were making music that could not, by any stretch of the imagination, be defined as a continuation of pre-1955 R&B. There was no clear precedent in R&B for an artist like Chuck Berry, who combined hillbilly, blues and swing-jazz influences in more or less equal measure and wrote songs about teenage life and culture that black and white teens found equally appealing. (Louis Jordan, the early idol of both Berry and Bill Haley, came closest, but his jump \u2018n\u2019 jive story songs were aimed as much at adults as teens, and any hillbilly flavor in his records was strictly a comedic device.) Certainly, mainstream popular music had never seen a performer whose vocal delivery, stage moves and seamless integration of influences as diverse as down-home blues, white Pentecostalism and hit-parade crooning remotely resembled Elvis Presley\u2019s. And where, outside the wildest, most Dionysian black storefront churches, had anyone heard or seen anything like Little Richard?\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\nSam Phillips, the rock & roll patriarch whose Sun label first recorded Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and other first-rate talents, has suggested that the true import of Fifties rock & roll had very little to do with musical content, let alone musical innovation. And it\u2019s perfectly true that once you strip the music down and analyze it, riff by riff, lick by lick, you find a m\u00e9lange of blues conceits, prewar big-band and Western swing, gospel and other existing vocabularies. For Phillips, rock & roll\u2019s real significance was twofold.\n\nFirst, it was the only form of popular music that specifically addressed and was tailored to teenagers \u2014 there had been adult records and kiddie records, but nothing for that burgeoning bulge of the baby-boom population caught between childhood and adulthood. Second, rock & roll enabled \u201cmarginal\u201d Americans \u2014 poor white sharecroppers, black ghetto youths and, not coincidentally, storefront record-label operators in out-of-the-way places like Memphis \u2014 the opportunity to express themselves freely, not as purveyors of R&B and C&W, whose audiences were limited, but as a dominant force in the popular marketplace. Elvis was transformed from hick truck driver to idol of millions in less than a year. Suddenly, it seemed, the sky was the limit, if there was a limit at all.\n\nThe coming of rock & roll in the mid-Fifties was not merely a musical revolution but a social and generational upheaval of vast and unpredicatable scope. It also represented a major reversal in the business of popular music. There were no pre-rock & roll counterparts to Sam Phillips, who parlayed a tiny Memphis label with a staff of one into a company whose artists sold millions of records throughout the world. In record-business terms, rock & roll meant that small, formerly specialized labels like Sun, Chess and Specialty were invading the upper reaches of the pop charts, long the exclusive domain of the major corporate record labels and old-line Tin Pan Alley music-publishing interests.\n\nRelated\n\nConcentrating on high-volume sales and bland, lowest-common-denominator pop disposables, the majors were caught napping by an unholy coalition of Southern renegade radio engineers (Phillips), Jewish immigrant merchants (the Chess brothers), black ex-swing-band musicians and raving hillbilly wild men. These were the \u201cmarginal\u201d Americans who had been recording for specialized audiences since the majors had virtually ceded them that territory at the end of World War II. The ghetto-storefront, nickle-and-dime record operation of 1949-53 suddenly emerged an industry giant in 1955-56, accounting for many and often most of the records at the top of the pop charts."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/art/rock-and-roll-early-style-of-rock-music", "page_content": "rock and roll, also called rock \u2019n\u2019 roll or rock & roll, style of popular music that originated in the United States in the mid-1950s and that evolved by the mid-1960s into the more encompassing international style known as rock music, though the latter also continued to be known as rock and roll.\n\nRock and roll has been described as a merger of country music and rhythm and blues, but, if it were that simple, it would have existed long before it burst into the national consciousness. The seeds of the music had been in place for decades, but they flowered in the mid-1950s when nourished by a volatile mix of Black culture and white spending power. Black vocal groups such as the Dominoes and the Spaniels began combining gospel-style harmonies and call-and-response singing with earthy subject matter and more aggressive rhythm-and-blues rhythms. Heralding this new sound were disc jockeys such as Alan Freed of Cleveland, Ohio, Dewey Phillips of Memphis, Tennessee, and William (\u201cHoss\u201d) Allen of WLAC in Nashville, Tennessee\u2014who created rock-and-roll radio by playing hard-driving rhythm-and-blues and raunchy blues records that introduced white suburban teenagers to a culture that sounded more exotic, thrilling, and illicit than anything they had ever known. In 1954 that sound coalesced around an image: that of a handsome white singer, Elvis Presley, who sounded like a Black man.\n\nBritannica Quiz Rock Music and Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll\n\nPresley\u2019s nondenominational taste in music incorporated everything from hillbilly rave-ups and blues wails to pop-crooner ballads. Yet his early recordings with producer Sam Phillips, guitarist Scotty Moore, and bassist Bill Black for in Memphis were less about any one style than about a feeling. For decades African Americans had used the term rock and roll as a euphemism for sex, and Presley\u2019s music oozed sexuality. Presley was hardly the only artist who embodied this attitude, but he was clearly a catalyst in the merger of Black and white culture into something far bigger and more complex than both.\n\nIn Presley\u2019s wake, the music of Black singers such as Fats Domino, Little Richard, Chuck Berry, and Bo Diddley, who might have been considered rhythm-and-blues artists only years before, fit alongside the rockabilly-flavoured tunes of white performers such as Buddy Holly, Eddie Cochran, and Jerry Lee Lewis, in part because they were all now addressing the same audience: teenagers. For young white America, this new music was a soundtrack for rebellion, however mild. When Bill Haley and His Comets kicked off the 1955 motion picture Blackboard Jungle with \u201cRock Around the Clock,\u201d teens in movie houses throughout the United States stomped on their seats. Movie stars such as Marlon Brando in The Wild One (1953) and James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause (1955) oozed sullen, youthful defiance that was echoed by the music. This emerging rock-and-roll culture brought a wave of condemnations from religious leaders, government officials, and parents\u2019 groups, who branded it the \u201cdevil\u2019s music.\u201d\n\nThe music industry\u2019s response was to sanitize the product: it had clean-cut, nonthreatening artists such as Pat Boone record tame versions of Little Richard songs, and it manufactured a legion of pretty-boy crooners such as Frankie Avalon and Fabian who thrived on and who would essentially serve as the Perry Comos and Bing Crosbys for a new generation of listeners. By the end of the 1950s, Presley had been inducted into the army, Holly had died in a plane crash, and Little Richard had converted to gospel. Rock and roll\u2019s golden era had ended, and the music entered a transitional phase characterized by a more sophisticated approach: the orchestrated wall of sound erected by Phil Spector, the \u201chit factory\u201d singles churned out by Motown records, and the harmony-rich surf fantasies of the Beach Boys. By the mid-1960s this sophistication allowed the music greater freedom than ever before, and it fragmented into numerous styles that became known simply as rock."}, {"url": "https://jukebugs.com/the-beau-brummels-members-of-the-rock-band-where-are-they/", "page_content": "It\u2019s difficult to speak about music in the 1960/1970s without mentioning The Beau Brummels. The band is especially recognized in the evolution of the country-rock music genre and what has come to be referred to as the San Francisco Sound.\n\nThe band whose original lineup was made up of a group of friends were discovered by local disc jockeys with a new record label looking for musicians to sign. In their early career, their sound was a blend of folk and beat music but as their career progressed, they incorporated various musical genres like country rock and psychedelic rock.\n\nThe band was active between 1964 to 1969 and then 1974 to 1975. Some of their well-received songs like Laugh, Laugh has made it to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the songs that shaped Rock and Roll. During the height of their popularity, they were considered teen idols and appeared on various television music variety shows like Shindig, American Bandstand, Hullabaloo, and films like Wild Wild Winter and Village of Giants.\n\nWho are the members of The Beau Brummels Rock Band?\n\nSal Valentino was the brain behind the band when it first began. He was the one who dreamed of it before going on to introduce others to form The Beau Brummels.\n\nHe began to perform at a young age with a series of appearances on television. His performances got him a regular gig at a club (El Cid, San Francisco). To form a much-needed band he called on his childhood friend Ron Elliot who was a guitarist and songwriter. Ron then recruited the other members which included Declan Mulligan (singer/ rhythm guitarist), Ron Meagher (bassist), and Victor Savant (pianist).\n\nAs they performed at the club, they got a more lucrative deal to perform at another club (Morocco Room, San Mateo, California. The owner of the club (Rich Romanello) invited disc jockeys Tom Donahue and Bobby Mitchell to listen to them at the club as they were looking for new acts to sign to their upcoming record label (Autumn Records). They quickly signed them and their early records were produced by Sly Stone.\n\nThe Beau Brummels band\u2019s original members include the following\n\nSal Valentino as lead vocalist, tambourine. (1964- 1969, 1974-75)\n\nRon Elliott as lead guitarist, backing vocals and occasional lead vocals. (1964- 1969, 1974-75)\n\nRon Meagher as bassist and backing vocals (1964- 1967, 1974)\n\nDeclan Mulligan as the rhythm guitarist, backing vocals and harmonica.(1964- 1965, 1974-75)\n\nJohn Peterson as the drummer. (1964- 1966, 1974-75)\n\nThe subsequent members of The Beau Brummels include\n\nDon Irving as guitarist and backing vocals. (1965-1966)\n\nDan Levitt played the banjo and guitar (1974-1975)\n\nPeter Tepp played the drums for their 1975 tour.\n\nAs much as they tried to keep it together, the band naturally went through changes in personnel over time. Mulligan left the band in 1965 and was replaced by Don Irving.\n\nElliott left the group next as he constantly suffered seizures due to his diabetic condition. So he had difficulty touring with the band.\n\nIn 1966, Irving got inducted into the armed forces so had to leave. Peterson left the band to join Harpers Bizarre. Meagher was also drafted into the military.\n\nIn 1974, four of the original members with a new member came together to work on another album which was then released in 1975.\n\nWhere are they?\n\nAfter recording a self-titled studio album that was released in 1975, The Beau Brummels members split up again but continued to appear in several incarnations between the late 1970s to the mid-1990s. They featured in shows alongside The Dinosaurs, The Smithereens, and performed at shows like the Baypop Festival 2000, Summer of Love Festival 2002.\n\nDespite the band split of several years, Valentino didn\u2019t release his first solo album until 2006. The album was titled Dreamin\u2019 Man and he went ahead to release two more solo albums in late 2006 and 2008. Unfortunately, John Peterson died on the 11th of November 2007 due to a heart attack.\n\nAs recently as 2013, the original band members came together again to record a studio album that was released on Bay Sound Records in March. The new album contained fifteen songs written by Elliott and some drum tracks recorded by late Peterson in 1965.

Popularized by disc jockey Alan Freed in 1951, the term \"rock and roll\" came to be used to describe a new form of music, steeped in the blues, rhythm and blues, country, and gospel. Teenagers fell in love with this new sound, listening to it on transistor radios and buying it in record stores. Many parents believed that this music was simply noise that had a negative influence on impressionable teens. Either way, it became clear that rock and roll was here to stay, bringing with it important changes. Examine the impact of rock and roll, and explore how the birth of this new music influenced and was influenced by technology, teen culture, race, and geography.\n\nObjectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\nEvaluate the significance of the birth of rock and roll in 1950s America. Identify key musicians that helped shape the sounds and style of early rock and roll. Give examples of how the birth of rock and roll influenced and was influenced by technology, teen culture, race, and geography.\n\nKey Terms\n\n45: A seven-inch phonograph record played at 45 revolutions per minute (r.p.m.), especially a popular music single\n\nBaby boomer: An individual born during the post\u2013World War II baby boom\n\nCivil rights: Rights for a nation\u2019s citizens as defined by law, often understood as freedoms or protections; in the United States, rights discussed in the Constitution and its amendments, including those known as the Bill of Rights\n\nCulture: A body of learned human knowledge, belief, and behavior; shared values and attitudes, customs, and styles for living\n\nDeejay: Disc jockey radio show host who introduces and/or selects recordings\n\nDisposable income: The amount of an individual\u2019s income available for spending after essentials (food, clothing, shelter, taxes) have been taken care of\n\nJukebox: A money-operated phonograph or compact disk player, equipped with pushbuttons for the selection of particular recordings\n\nJuvenile delinquency: Conduct by a juvenile characterized by antisocial behavior that is beyond parental control and subject to legal action; many linked juvenile delinquency to rock and roll and those who listened to it.\n\nMainstream: A dominating, widespread, or prevailing viewpoint or influence often projected to be an overall \"norm\" for a community or society\n\nMusical style: The distinctive characteristics of the sound and organization of musical performances and compositions; used to categorize music reflecting similar approaches to melody, harmony, form, and/or performance techniques\n\nPopular music: A broad term for music that appeals to large numbers or whole communities of people and may often be sold on recordings or sheet music\n\nRacial segregation: Separation of racial groups by law and custom, which restricted the access of black Americans to jobs, schools, neighborhoods, stores, etc. and privileged white Americans; outlawed by the US Congress in 1964\n\nRhythm: The timing of sound in musical patterns, such as pulses, beats, etc.\n\nRhythm and blues: A style of upbeat popular music blending big band swing and blues that attracted large numbers of African American audiences after World War II, in the mid-1940s through the 1950s; a root of rock and roll\n\nRock and roll: African American slang dating back to the early twentieth century; in the early 1950s, the term came to be used to describe a new form of music, steeped in the blues, rhythm and blues, country, and gospel.

In this class, students are asked to consider the implications of technology in the birth and growth of rock and roll in the 1950s. Changing technology is also the focus of a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum exhibit entitled \"Listen to Music: The Evolution of Audio Technology.\" Ask students to identify and determine the origin of sound technologies of the 1950s and to trace this development throughout the following decades. For example, students may choose to research the transistor radio, stereo system, eight track machine, the Walkman, and the iPod. Who developed each one of these innovations? How did they change and evolve and why? How did consumers respond to them? How did these innovations change the way musicians approach the act of making and recording music? And how did this change how audiences listened to music? Why was there a need for new and different technology?\n\nFinally, have students predict what future listening technology might involve. How might it be different from contemporary devices? How might we interact with it? What could be its advantages and disadvantages? When do you think this technology will become reality?\n\nTeen Culture and Popular Music \u2013 Yesterday and Today\n\nIn this activity, students will examine and evaluate conflicting opinions about the music that has appealed to teens over the past fifty years. Have students read the quotes below. Ask them to identify whether they think each quote refers to music in the early days when rock and roll first emerged or in later years when heavy metal and hip-hop became popular. Continue the exercise by having students try to match each quote to its source. Finally, discuss with students the controversies that have surrounded rock and roll since its inception. Encourage them to share personal experiences they or their parents may have encountered regarding their own music choices.\n\n\"The most popular music was reaching its lowest [point] in the [new musical] style of . . . chant [which] concentrated on a minimum of melody line and maximum of rhythmic noise.\" Encyclopedia Britannica\u2019s Book of the Year, 1956 \"The theater is jammed with adolescents from the 9 a.m. curtain to closing and it rings and shrieks like the . . . bird house at the zoo. If one of the current heroes is announced . . . the shrieks become deafening. Only the . . . beat pounds through, stimulating the crowd to such rhythmical movements as clapping in tempo and dancing in the aisles.\" \"Yeh-Heh-Heh-Hes, Baby,\" TIME, June 18, 1956 \"You get narrow-minded critics reviewing the shows, and all they think about [our music] is that it is just total ear-splitting, blood-curdling noise without any definition or point complained [the board member].

And as much as I think we all liked being a part of our little secret thing, we all thought \u2018Wow this music needs to be heard by everyone. Someone needs to take it and blow it up, give it the respect it deserves.\u2019\" Danyel Smith, former editor of Vibe, about hip-hop in the early 1980s \"Music \u2018leer-ics\u2019 are touching new lows and . . . policing, if you will, [has] to come from more responsible sources.

[and its] harmful influence on the attitudes and behaviors of our children, and therefore on the safety and moral condition of our country.\" US Senator Joseph Lieberman, Rating the Ratings, July 25, 2001\n\nRace and Rock and Roll\n\nIn this activity, students will research and examine the implications of being an African American musician in the 1950s. Have students research important African American artists who were crucial to the development of early rock and roll. Examples include Chuck Berry, Ruth Brown, Laverne Baker, Etta James, Lloyd Price, Bo Diddley, Fats Domino, Ray Charles, Little Richard, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, the Orioles, Little Anthony and the Imperials, Big Joe Turner, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Muddy Waters, and the Chantels. Ask students to design a concert poster advertising a performance in the 1950s. (Examples of vintage concert posters can be found online.) Students should consider the following: Who is the headliner and who is the opening act? When is the concert and where? What is the venue of the concert? What are some major hits by their chosen artists? Students should remember the climate of the times when making their decisions (i.e., segregated concert halls, mixed bills, etc.). After creating the poster, have students write a music review of the concert for either a newspaper with a predominantly white reading audience or a predominantly African American audience (see Call and Post for example).\n\nRock and Roll Landmarks\n\nAs rock and roll became a national phenomenon, many cities across the country became key to its development and expansion. Many of these were discussed in class. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum\u2019s Landmark Series designates certain sites around the United States as historic rock-and-roll landmarks. These include King Records in Cincinnati, OH; the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, IA; and Brooklyn High School and WJW, both in Cleveland, OH. Have students imagine they are on the committee to select other historic sites that have been integral in telling the story of rock and roll\u2019s formative moments. Students should present their choices to their classmates as though they\u2019re presenting to the other members of the selection committee. They should be prepared to defend their choices with solid evidence given their research. The class can then vote on 3\u20135 sites that should be designated as historic rock-and-roll landmarks. Working in small groups students can also design promotional materials (posters, t-shirts, magazine/newspaper ads, etc.) advertising chosen landmarks.\n\nSuggested Listening for the Classroom\n\nNote: Preview all materials for appropriateness for your students.\n\nWynonie Harris. \"Good Rockin\u2019 Tonight.\" 1947.\n\nJackie Brenston and his Delta Cats. \"Rocket 88.\" 1951.\n\nBig Mama Thornton. \"Hound Dog.\" 1952.\n\nPatti Page. \"How Much is that Doggie in the Window?\" 1952.\n\nRuth Brown. \"Mama, He Treats Your Daughter Mean.\" 1953.\n\nThe Chords. \"Sh-Boom.\" 1954.\n\nBo Diddley \"Bo Diddley.\" 1955.\n\nFats Domino. \"Ain\u2019t That a Shame.\" 1955.\n\nJerry Lee Lewis. \"Whole Lotta Shaking Going On.\" 1955.\n\nLittle Richard. \"Tutti Frutti.\" 1955.\n\nPat Boone. \"Tutti Frutti.\" 1956.\n\nElvis Presley. \"Hound Dog.\" 1956.\n\nBuddy Holly. \"That\u2019ll Be the Day.\" 1956\n\nJohnny Cash. \"I Walk the Line.\" 1956.\n\nLavern Baker. \"Jim Dandy.\" 1957.\n\nElvis Presley. \"All Shook Up.\" 1957.\n\nRitchie Valens. \"La Bamba.\" 1958.\n\nChuck Berry. \"Johnny B.

The term was coined by Jerry Wexler in 1947, when he was editing the charts at the trade journal Billboard and found that the record companies issuing Black popular music considered the chart names then in use (Harlem Hit Parade, Sepia, Race) to be demeaning. The magazine changed the chart\u2019s name in its June 17, 1949, issue, having used the term rhythm and blues in news articles for the previous two years. Although the records that appeared on Billboard\u2019s rhythm-and-blues chart thereafter were in a variety of different styles, the term was used to encompass a number of contemporary forms that emerged at that time.\n\nPerhaps the most commonly understood meaning of the term is as a description of the sophisticated urban music that had been developing since the 1930s, when Louis Jordan\u2019s small combo started making blues-based records with humorous lyrics and upbeat rhythms that owed as much to boogie-woogie as to classic blues forms. This music, sometimes called jump blues, set a pattern that became the dominant Black popular music form during and for some time after World War II. Among its leading practitioners were Jordan, Amos Milburn, Roy Milton, Jimmy Liggins, Joe Liggins, Floyd Dixon, Wynonie Harris, Big Joe Turner, and Charles Brown. While many of the numbers in these performers\u2019 repertoires were in the classic 12-bar A-A-B blues form, others were straight pop songs, instrumentals that were close to light jazz, or pseudo-Latin compositions.\n\nBritannica Quiz Pop Culture Quiz\n\nWithin this genre there were large-group and small-group rhythm and blues. The former was practiced by singers whose main experience was with big bands and who were usually hired employees of bandleaders such as Lucky Millinder (for whose band Harris sang) or Count Basie (whose vocalists included Turner and Jimmy Witherspoon). The small groups usually consisted of five to seven pieces and counted on individual musicians to take turns in the limelight. Thus, for instance, in Milton\u2019s group, Milton played drums and sang, Camille Howard played piano and sang, and the alto and tenor saxophonists (Milton went through several of them) each would be featured at least once. Another hallmark of small-group rhythm and blues was the relegation of the guitar, if indeed there was one, to a time-keeping status, because guitar soloing was considered \u201ccountry\u201d and unsophisticated. The most extreme example of this was Brown, both in his early work with Johnny Moore\u2019s Three Blazers and in his subsequent work as a bandleader; in both cases the band consisted of piano, bass, and guitar, but solos almost totally were handled by Brown on the piano.\n\nEarly rhythm and blues was recorded largely in Los Angeles by small independent record labels such as Modern, RPM, and Specialty. The founding of Atlantic Records in 1947 by Ahmet Ertegun, a jazz fan and the son of a Turkish diplomat, and Herb Abramson, a music industry professional, shifted the industry\u2019s centre to New York City. In 1953 they brought in Wexler as a partner, and he and Ertegun were instrumental in moving rhythm and blues forward. Atlantic hired jazz musicians as studio players and, owing to its engineer, Tom Dowd, paid particular attention to the sound quality of their recordings. It introduced some of the top female names in rhythm and blues\u2014most notably Ruth Brown and LaVern Baker\u2014and signed Ray Charles, who had been imitating Charles Brown, and helped him find a new direction, which eventually would evolve into soul. Wexler and Ertegun worked closely with Clyde McPhatter (both in and out of his group the Drifters) and Chuck Willis, both of whom were important figures in early 1950s rhythm and blues. King Records in Cincinnati, Ohio, the Chess and Vee Jay labels in Chicago, and Duke/Peacock Records in Houston, Texas, also played pivotal roles in the spread of rhythm and blues, as did Sun Records in Memphis, Tennessee\u2014before Sam Phillips turned his attention to Elvis Presley and rockabilly music\u2014and J&M Studio in New Orleans, Louisiana, where a number of the most important records released on the Los Angeles-based labels were recorded.\n\nBy mid-decade rhythm and blues had come to mean Black popular music that was not overtly aimed at teenagers, since the music that was becoming known as rock and roll sometimes featured lyrics that concerned first love and parent-child conflict, as well as a less subtle approach to rhythm. Many doo-wop vocal groups, therefore, were considered rock-and-roll acts, as were performers such as Little Richard and Hank Ballard and the Midnighters. Because the distinction between rock and roll and rhythm and blues was not based on any hard-and-fast rules, most performers issued records that fit in both categories. Moreover, some vocalists who were later considered jazz performers\u2014in particular, Dinah Washington\u2014also appeared on the rhythm-and-blues charts, and a steady stream of saxophone-led instrumentals firmly in the rhythm-and-blues tradition continued to be produced by performers such as Joe Houston, Chuck Higgins, and Sam (\u201cThe Man\u201d) Taylor but were considered rock and roll and were often used as theme music by disc jockeys on rock-and-roll radio.\n\nThe division based on the age of the intended audience for Black popular music also meant that, by the mid-1950s, much of the guitar-led electric blues music coming from Chicago and Memphis was now considered rhythm and blues, since it appealed to older buyers. Thus, although they had little to nothing in common with the earlier generation of band-backed blues shouters, performers such as Muddy Waters, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, and B.B. King (who, because he used a horn section when he could, was perhaps more like the older generation than the Chicago bluesmen) became regarded as rhythm-and-blues performers. One important figure in this transition was Ike Turner, a piano-player-turned-guitarist from Mississippi who worked as a talent scout for several labels and fronted a band called the Kings of Rhythm, which backed many of his discoveries on records. When Turner married the former Anna Mae Bullock and rechristened her Tina Turner, the Ike and Tina Turner Revue became a significant force in the modernization of rhythm and blues, dispensing with the horn section but including a trio of female backing singers who were modeled on Ray Charles\u2019s Raelettes.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nBy 1960 rhythm and blues was, if not a spent force, at least aging with its audience. Performers such as Washington, Charles, and Ruth Brown were appearing more in nightclubs than in the multiperformer revues in which they had made their names. Although younger performers such as Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke clearly owed a debt to the previous generation of rhythm-and-blues performers, they were more transitional figures who were, like Charles, establishing the new genre of soul. Significantly, in the August 23, 1969, issue of Billboard, the Black pop chart\u2019s name was changed again, to soul. Although soul then became the preferred term for Black popular music, in some quarters rhythm and blues continued to be used to refer to nearly every genre of post-World War II Black music.\n\nThe term rhythm and blues, however, attained a new meaning thanks to the British bands that followed in the wake of the Beatles. Most of these groups, notably the Rolling Stones, played a mixture of Chicago blues and Black rock and roll and described their music as rhythm and blues. Thus, the Who, although a quintessential mod rock band, advertised their early performances as \u201cMaximum R&B\u201d to attract an audience. Although bands that followed this generation\u2014John Mayall\u2019s Bluesbreakers and Fleetwood Mac, for example\u2014called themselves blues bands, rhythm and blues remained the rubric for the Animals, Them, the Pretty Things, and others. Today a band that advertises itself as rhythm and blues is almost certainly following in this tradition rather than that of the early pioneers."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/art/rock-music", "page_content": "The difficulty of definition\n\nDictionary definitions of rock are problematic, not least because the term has different resonance in its British and American usages (the latter is broader in compass). There is basic agreement that rock \u201cis a form of music with a strong beat,\u201d but it is difficult to be much more explicit. The Collins Cobuild English Dictionary, based on a vast database of British usage, suggests that \u201crock is a kind of music with simple tunes and a very strong beat that is played and sung, usually loudly, by a small group of people with electric guitars and drums,\u201d but there are so many exceptions to this description that it is practically useless.\n\nLegislators seeking to define rock for regulatory purposes have not done much better. The Canadian government defined \u201crock and rock-oriented music\u201d as \u201ccharacterized by a strong beat, the use of blues forms and the presence of rock instruments such as electric guitar, electric bass, electric organ or electric piano.\u201d This assumes that rock can be marked off from other sorts of music formally, according to its sounds. In practice, though, the distinctions that matter for rock fans and musicians have been ideological. Rock was developed as a term to distinguish certain music-making and listening practices from those associated with pop; what was at issue was less a sound than an attitude. In 1990 British legislators defined pop music as \u201call kinds of music characterized by a strong rhythmic element and a reliance on electronic amplification for their performance.\u201d This led to strong objections from the music industry that such a definition failed to appreciate the clear sociological difference between pop (\u201cinstant singles-based music aimed at teenagers\u201d) and rock (\u201calbum-based music for adults\u201d). In pursuit of definitional clarity, the lawmakers misunderstood what made rock music matter."}, {"url": "https://timeline.carnegiehall.org/genres/rock-n-roll", "page_content": "In 1965 Fats Domino said, \u201cWhat they call rock \u2018n\u2019 roll is rhythm and blues. I\u2019ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans.\u201d Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll was the inevitable clash of African American rhythm and blues with elements of swing, boogie-woogie, urban blues, Latin rhythms (clave), Country and Western, Rockabilly, and Tin Pan Alley popular song, all infused with a teenage sense of rebellion and independence that blossomed just after World War II. Early rock \u2018n\u2019 roll artists established a distinct sound characterized by an aggressive beat and prominent electric guitars, saxophone solos, and pumping pianos. To be young in the mid-\u201950s to early \u201960s and not be a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll fan was to be \u201csquare.\u201d\n\nThe term rock \u2018n\u2019 roll has been traced back as far as the 1920s in Black music, when Trixie Smith recorded \u201cMy Baby Rocks Me with One Steady Roll\u201d in 1922. It became the accepted label for this developing genre when in 1951, Cleveland disc jockey Alan Freed began calling his rhythm and blues radio show \u201cMoondog\u2019s Rock and Roll Party.\u201d Little Richard, Fats Domino, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, and several other African American singer/songwriter musicians were among the first to transform the sound of rhythm and blues by introducing new musical elements.\n\nWidely considered to be the first rock \u2018n\u2019 roll record, the 1951 song \u201cRocket 88\u201d recorded by Ike Turner\u2019s band the Kings of Rhythm and credited to its vocalist Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats, features many of the hallmarks of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll style: quick/upbeat tempo, propulsive rhythm, distorted guitar, and a honking saxophone solo. Four years later, a critical mass of artists elaborated the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll sound. Little Richard (Richard Penniman) replaced the standard R&B shuffle rhythm popularized in Louis Jordan\u2019s \u201cCaldonia\u201d with a faster beat that came to characterize \u201crock \u2018n\u2019 roll.\u201d Little Richard\u2019s drummer, Charles Connor, explains how Little Richard created the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll beat. Little Richard (\u201cTutti Frutti,\u201d 1955) and Fats Domino (\u201cBlueberry Hill,\u201d 1956) repositioned the piano from accompanying instrument to the foreground and established the triplet piano figure as a key component of the music.\n\nAs rhythm and blues transitioned to rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, vocalists such as Ruth Brown (\u201cMama, He Treats Your Daughter Mean,\u201d 1953), LaVern Baker (\u201cTweedlee Dee,\u201d 1955) and Etta James singing with the Johnny Otis Orchestra (\u201cThe Wallflower,\u201d 1955) established the rhythmic vocal style that characterized rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and promoted the music to Black and white teen audiences. The prominence of the electric guitar as played by Chuck Berry ( \u201cMaybellene,\u201d 1955) and Bo Diddley ( \u201cBo Diddley,\u201d 1955 with Chuck Berry), made the guitar a focal, soloing instrument, ultimately displacing the saxophone from the central position it held in rhythm and blues, and inspired young fans in England as well as America to learn to play the guitar. Alongside the more frenetic instrumental rock \u2018n\u2019 roll sound of the mid-1950s, teenage \u201cdoo-wop\u201d a cappela harmony groups such as the Clovers ( \u201cDon\u2019t You Know I Love You,\u201d 1951) and Billy Ward and His Dominoes (\u201cHave Mercy, Baby,\u201d 1952) developed a unique sound defined by their roots in Southern-flavored blues and gospel music, respectively. They added instrumental combo accompaniment that included solo tenor sax, handclapping, and an emphasis on beats 2 and 4 that Wild Bill Moore popularized in \u201cWe\u2019re Gonna Rock, We\u2019re Gonna Roll,\u201d 1947.\n\nSome doo-wop groups took the names of cars as their own, such as the Cadillacs ( \u201cSpeedoo,\u201d 1955) and the El Dorados (\u201cAt My Front Door,\u201d 1955). Others took the names of birds such as the Orioles (\u201cCrying in the Chapel,\u201d 1953) and the Flamingos (\u201cI Only Have Eyes for You,\u201d 1959). Other singing groups, particularly the Coasters ( \u201cYakety Yak,\u201d 1958 and \u201cCharlie Brown,\u201d 1959), specialized in novelty or comedy-styled songs. Other vocal groups included The Chords, Little Anthony and the Imperials (\u201cTears on My Pillow,\u201d 1958), and Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers (\u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love,\u201d 1956). The Platters were one of the most commercially successful vocal groups of the era, and their song \u201cThe Great Pretender\u201d (1955) was the first doo-wop group to reach number one on the pop charts. All-female harmony groups also came on the scene in the late 1950s. The Chantels (\u201cMaybe,\u201d 1957) and the Bobbettes (Mr. Lee,\u201d 1957) were followed successfully in the early \u201960s by the Shirelles, who were the first all-female group to have a number one pop hit in the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll era. Their song, \u201cWill You Still Love Me Tomorrow\u201d charted in 1960 and ushered in a critical mass of all-female \u201cgirl groups\u201d onto the R&B and pop charts. Most of these groups, including the Crystals, the Chiffons, and the Ronettes (\u201cBe My Baby,\u201d 1963), were African American. The Black vocal group sound became a staple of pop radio during the 1960s, through girl group music and the music of artists recording for the Detroit-based Motown label which produced a steady stream of hits featuring artists such as Mary Wells, The Miracles (featuring Smokey Robinson), Stevie Wonder, Martha and the Vandellas, the Temptations, the Four Tops, Marvin Gaye, and the Supremes (featuring Diana Ross).\n\nThe rhythm and blues and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll songs of Black artists influenced their white counterparts. Several established and/or advanced their careers in rock \u2018n\u2019 roll by covering the recordings of Black artists, synthesizing the same rhythm and blues elements that their Black counterparts had updated, and adding elements of country and western music to the mix. These artists include Bill Haley and His Comets, Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, and the Everly Brothers.\n\nBy the mid- to late \u201960s, British artists such as the Beatles, Rolling Stones, the Who, the Yardbirds, and the Animals, had begun to cover and interpret Black rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and urban blues from the previous 25 years. Their hybrid productions, introduced to Americans through the \u201cBritish Invasion\u201d launched with the arrival of the Beatles in the US in 1964, ultimately evolved into what became known as rock music. At the same time Black artists such as Sly and the Family Stone, Buddy Miles, Jimi Hendrix (recording with Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding as The Jimi Hendrix Experience), and Love, created a unique rock sound by fusing elements from rhythm and blues, blues, gospel, funk, and soul with guitar-driven grooves and innovative technologies. Jimi Hendrix and Sly and the Family Stone both performed at Woodstock, the iconic concert event of the 1960s, and were among the most popular and visible figures in rock. African Americans also had an impact on rock working behind the scenes. Tom Wilson helped launch the folk-rock movement through his work as producer of Bob Dylan\u2019s first electric album Bringing It All Back Home (1965) and of Dylan\u2019s biggest hit single \u201cLike a Rolling Stone\u201d (1965). Wilson\u2019s decision to add electric guitar, bass, and drums to folk duo Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s acoustic track \u201cThe Sounds of Silence\u201d (1966) modeled the fusion of electric instrumentation and folk music that characterized the new sub-genre. Starting in the 1960s and continuing into the 1970s, the gospel-derived background vocals of African American women vocalists such as Darlene Love, Madeline Bell, Doris Troy, Venetta Fields, Clydie King, Gloria Jones, Claudia Lennear, and Merry Clayton, who is well-known for her contribution to the Rolling Stones\u2019 1969 single \u201cGimme Shelter,\u201d became fixtures on a wide range of recordings by white rock artists such as Dusty Springfield, the Rolling Stones, Joe Cocker, Humble Pie, Pink Floyd, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Bob Dylan. In spite of the presence of these African American artists in the rock scene, by the end of the 1960s, the majority of musicians and fans associated with the music were white, a result of record label and media decision-making that linked musical genres to racial categories. Thus, rock became associated with British and American white artists.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/12/a-thousand-teardrops-how-doo-wop-kickstarted-jamaica-pop-revolution-reggae-rocksteady", "page_content": "In late 1961, a young teenager called James Chambers turned up unannounced at Beverley\u2019s restaurant and ice cream parlour on Orange Street in Kingston, Jamaica. In search of a sponsor, he told the owners, three Chinese-Jamaican brothers, that he had written a song for them. His audacity paid off and a few months later, Dearest Beverley was released as the B-side of a more topical and upbeat song called Hurricane Hattie, which became the first hit for the newly formed Beverley\u2019s Records.\n\nThe single was produced by the label\u2019s owner, Leslie Kong, one of the brothers for whom Chambers had auditioned. Kong would go on to produce a series of classic early reggae songs like 007 (Shanty Town) by Desmond Dekker and Monkey Man by the Maytals; by the time Dearest Beverley was released, James Chambers had turned 14 and was calling himself Jimmy Cliff, soon to be one of reggae\u2019s biggest stars.\n\nIn 1965 the Wailers recorded their own homage to doo-wop with a reworking of Dion and the Belmonts\u2019 A Teenager in Love\n\nA plaintive ballad delivered over a rolling piano riff, Dearest Beverley is part of a Jamaican music scene taking its first steps towards global glory. This is the era immediately before the homegrown music of ska, rocksteady, reggae, dub and dancehall \u2013 a time when the American sound of doo-wop reigned.\n\nThe song is one of the highlights of If I Had a Pair of Wings, a compilation of Jamaican doo-wop songs from the 1950s and early 1960s, which was released last year on the archival label Death Is Not the End. The album includes similarly wistful offerings by the likes of Alton Ellis, Millie Small and Laurel Aitken, all of whom who would go on to become successful singers as post-independent Jamaican discovered its own distinctively offbeat rhythm in the early 1960s.\n\nThe Jiving Juniors, with Derrick Harriott centre\n\nNow comes If I Had A Pair of Wings Volume 2, which has just been released in limited edition vinyl and cassette formats as well as a name-your-price digital download. It, too, is dotted with familiar names in their earliest guises. They include the inimitable Prince Buster, who fronts the Charmers in uncharacteristically restrained mood, and Derrick Harriott, lead singer of the Jiving Juniors \u2013 both singers would find fame in the mid-1960s rocksteady era. As before, nearly all the songs on the new compilation adhere strictly to the American doo-wop model \u2013 intricate vocal harmonies articulating lovelorn lyrics over often understated arrangements.\n\n\u201cA lot of what is now called Jamaican doo-wop is, in fact, a straight copy of the US style of vocal harmony singing, but that is not to say that the records don\u2019t sound sweet and soulful,\u201d elaborates Gladdy Wax, a reggae aficionado and broadcaster, who has been running his own British sound system for more than 40 years. \u201cA great vocalist like Alton Ellis, say, who would later become known as the king of rocksteady, had a distinctive voice from the start, whatever style he was singing in. The same is true of a lot of Jamaican singers who started out in the 1950s \u2013 their voices shine from the start.\u201d\n\nThe two most intriguing tracks on If I Had a Pair of Wings Vol 2 are Guilty Convict by Rupert \u201cRupie\u201d Edwards and How Can I Be Sure by Higgs & Wilson. The former is a tougher-sounding, rhythm and blues influenced song that sounds like a precursor to the \u201crude boy\u201d anthems that became so popular in the ska era, while the latter features a sinuous sax solo that prefigures the jazz-influenced style of the great Roland Alphonso of the Skatalites. It also features a young Joe Higgs, who went on to be a mentor for a generation of reggae singers, including the young Bob Marley.\n\nAllow Bandcamp content?

A Thousand Teardrops by the Rhythm Aces & the Caribs features some wondrous harmony singing tied to a deftly understated backdrop created by the Caribs, an in-demand session group whose core members hailed from Australia and would later play a crucial role in shaping the imminent ska sound. The album\u2019s most bittersweet moment belongs to Dobby Dobson, who passed away from Covid-19 in July, aged 78, and whose sweet-sounding voice can be heard on Chuck & Dobby\u2019s I Love My Teacher, originally released in 1961 on the legendary Blue Beat label.\n\nLuke Owen, who runs Death Is Not the End from his south London home, accurately describes Jamaican doo-wop as \u201ca kind of prehistory\u201d of Jamaican music. \u201cCompared to the New Orleans\u2019 rhythm and blues shuffle style that so influenced ska, doo-wop has been relatively under-appreciated as a stylistic influence on reggae,\u201d he elaborates. \u201cBut you could argue that it influences both the vocal style of the rocksteady era and the three-part harmonies of classic reggae vocal groups like the Techniques and the Heptones.\u201d\n\nDoo-wop emerged out of the black ghettoes of urban American cities in the 1940s, its intricate vocal interplay becoming a touchstone for great 60s soul groups like the Impressions, who, in turn, influenced the singing style of the original Wailers and countless other Jamaican vocal harmony trios. (In 1965, The Wailers belatedly recorded their own homage to doo-wop with a jaunty reworking of Dion and the Belmonts\u2019 classic of adolescent angst, A Teenager in Love.)\n\nLike their American role models, many great Jamaican vocalists began by practising their harmonies on street corners, before graduating to the talent contest circuit that was the combative testing ground for raw talent in the era before the ascendancy of the early sound systems. Simultaneously, the 1950s produced a new breed of musical entrepreneurs, including pioneers like Duke Reid and Clement \u201cCoxsone\u201d Dodd, who would go on to run their own sound systems and recording studios, shaping the course of Jamaican music as much as the singers and musicians they produced.\n\nAn album by Wilfred \u2018Jackie\u2019 Edwards.\n\nThroughout all this, Jamaica\u2019s proximity to America was a crucial factor. \u201cAll through the 1950s and early 1960s, Jamaicans were going back and forth between Kingston and New York,\u201d says David Katz, author of Solid Foundation: An Oral History of Reggae. \u201cThey often returned home with suitcases full of the latest US singles. Classic doo-wop records would certainly have found their way on to local radio stations and early sound systems perhaps as a counterpoint to the more uptempo New Orleans rhythm and blues tunes that were much more popular in Jamaica.\u201d\n\nThe songs collected on both volumes of If I Had Wings to Fly represent the first stirrings of a soulful vocal harmony tradition that began in the mid-to-late 1960s and continued into the 70s, when the influence of Rastafarianism produced the intensely devotional harmonies of the likes of the Abyssinians, Burning Spear, Culture and the Congos. Manna for music historians but surely enthralling to anyone, these songs are the starting point for Jamaica\u2019s lineage of profoundly beautiful vocalists.\n\n\u201cFor a small island, Jamaica has produced so many amazing singers,\u201d says Gladdy Wax. \u201cI think it is because, when they start out, they are often singing purely for themselves, for the pure enjoyment that comes from the act of expressing yourself in song, in beautiful harmonies and great vocals. That tradition runs deep.\u201d"}]}
