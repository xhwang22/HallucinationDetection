A tribute.\n\nThe message of Hayek\u2019s opus magnum \u201cConstitution of Liberty\u201d is contained in the titles of its first two parts: \u201cThe Value of Freedom\u201d and \u201cFreedom and the Law\u201d. Two principles characterise a free society: limits on the power of the state and the rule of law. Hayek\u2019s main objective is that the coercion of some in society by others is reduced to the extent possible. \u201cThis state we shall describe throughout as a state of liberty or freedom,\u201d he says (p. 11). In his chapter on the origins of the rule of law he quotes John Locke: \u201cThe end of the law is, not to abolish or restrain, but to preserve and enlarge freedom. For in all the states of created beings capable of laws, where there is no law there is no freedom\u201d (p. 162).\n\nIt is obvious that only a free market economy is consistent with a free society. Only within such a framework can people act as free individuals and make the best contribution to their own well-being and that of others. Competition is a fundamental element of a market economy and the driving force of the progress of mankind.\n\nIn \u201cCompetition as a discovery procedure\u201d Hayek says that \u201c\u2026 wherever the use of competition can be rationally justified, it is on the ground that we do not know in advance the facts that determine the actions of competitors. In sports or in examinations, no less than in the award of government contracts or of prizes for poetry, it would clearly be pointless to arrange for competition, if we were certain beforehand who would do best\u2026 I propose to consider competition as a procedure for the discovery of such facts as, without resort to it, would not be known to anyone, or at least would not be utilised\u201d (p. 179).\n\nWe honour today a man who has lived up to these principles in word and deed. This has been most visible in his role as the most respected Commissioner in Brussels. His first responsibility was for Internal Market, Financial Services and Financial Integration (from 1995 to 1999); his second for Competition (from 1999 to 2004). His decisions were landmarks in important sectors of the European economy \u2013 the German banking sector was just one of many spectacular cases.\n\nAs Commissioner he was able to realise what an economist of his calibre and a man of independent mind and character would see as the fulfilment of his professional life. His actions reflected a rare combination of personal integrity, a sharp intellect and a broad and deep understanding of economics. His reasoning was always compelling and convincing.\n\n\u201cBrussels\u201d, a word which for many has negative connotations, was \u2013 when represented by his persona \u2013 universally respected, and feared by all those who might not, to put it mildly, have a preference for competition. CEOs of the biggest companies in the world, starting sometimes from a position of arrogance, were ultimately obliged to accept not only his decisions in favour of competition but also the superiority of his arguments. As a European antitrust attorney once said: \u201cMonti is not the type to bow down to any verbal aggression. He may have an academic exterior, but there is steel inside\u201d. Or as a lobbyist once put it: \u201cMonti is not a politician. He is an intellectual, an absolutely honest economist. He has an extremely charming way of sending you out to the desert.\u201d\n\nAmong politicians as well as the general public he is respectfully known as \u201cil professore\u201d. I could easily continue with compliments on \u201cSuper Mario\u201d. For me, he is an outstanding example of an economist who is as much esteemed among academics as he is among politicians, the business community and the public. You will not be surprised to hear me say that we need much more involvement of academics in public debate. Mario Monti demonstrates that to be successful in this respect one need not compromise on intellectual honesty \u2013 just the opposite. He is the personification of political economics in the great liberal tradition. Just to give an example in his own words: \u201cCartels are cancers on the open market economy, which forms the very basis of our Community. \u2026 Moreover, since by nature cartels are secret and therefore difficult to uncover, it is likely that what we are seeing is only the tip of the iceberg. In the words of Adam Smith there is a \u2018tendency for competitors to conspire\u2019. \u2026 I am determined to strengthen our fight against cartels\u201d.\n\nMario Monti was an eloquent advocate of free markets long before he took the position in Brussels which made him well known worldwide. For him, there can be no lasting economic well-being without free markets, and that free markets are a prerequisite for a free and democratic society. A true zoon politicon in the sense of Aristotle, he was a tireless and vocal contributor to Italian public life. He waged a constant fight against all kinds of unnecessary regulations and restrictions, while remaining firm in the belief that a free society and a functioning market economy need a well designed framework establishing the rule of law.\n\nI will not forget the day I delivered a speech at the famous Bocconi University, where Mario has been president for many years now. Afterwards, we embarked on a discussion of the future of Europe. At that time in the early 1990s he was convinced that Italy needed constraints on its politics to start a virtuous circle which would ultimately allow participation in Monetary Union. Such a framework in his opinion could only come from outside. His ideas were \u2013 and I think still are \u2013 very close to what Germans have in mind when they speak of \u201cOrdnungspolitik\u201d. Indeed, listening to him you might think he is more German than most Germans are today. We should invite him to tell Germany what it has to change to find back to its way to prosperity.\n\nToday is not the occasion to examine Mario Monti\u2019s career in detail and analyse his numerous publications. As a central banker, though, I have to mention that he started as an expert in the field of monetary economics. He believed that a clear assignment of responsibilities was needed for the optimal conduct of economic policies; for the central bank, the goal could only be price stability. Many of his ideas initially faced fierce opposition even from within circles which later supported him. His influence on public opinion in Italy cannot be overestimated. This is also due to his impact as an academic teacher on a generation of students. I have learned from students of his \u2013 some of them now at the European Central Bank \u2013 that at a time when Italian universities were dominated by mainstream Keynesianism, Mario Monti\u2019s reading list included Milton Friedman and Allan Meltzer and the disequilibrium theorists, such as Clower and Leijonhufvud, alongside with James Tobin, his teacher at Yale. Today, some of Italy\u2019s most prominent academics represent the kind of political economics for which Mario Monti stands.\n\nMario Monti\u2019s influence on politics is now needed more than ever. I think we all appreciate the fact that he took on a new and important European responsibility in becoming Chairman of the Board of Bruegel \u2013 \u201cBrussels European and Global Economic Laboratory\u201d. He was quoted as having said the new think tank would bring much-needed new thinking to the role of Europe in international economics. The name \u201cBruegel\u201d was chosen not simply for being a clever acronym but also because Pieter Bruegel was a leading exponent of the painting of movement, not to mention market activity.\n\nMario Monti\u2019s work and personal achievements have been recognised by a number of awards, of which I have time to mention only a few. In 2001 he received the Benemeriti della Scienza e della Cultura medal as well as the Wolfram Engels Prize awarded by the Stiftung Marktwirtschaft and the informedia-Stiftung. In 2004 he was awarded the Robert Schuman Medal.\n\nBut his life, his work and his personality could not be better characterised and recognised than by a prize named after the great economist and philosopher of market and liberty Friedrich August von Hayek."}, {"url": "https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/eu-affairs/20120210STO37773/italian-pm-mario-monti-applauded-in-ep-for-his-reform-efforts", "page_content": "Mr Monti talked in his speech about the necessity of reforms and the need for Europe to play a role. \"Italy is making important sacrifices, which are not imposed by EU, but because they are necessary for the future of this country, for our sons and daughters,\" he said. \"Today's fiscal discipline has to be followed by a strengthened single market leading to a stronger economic union, which is the basis of the European project itself. Italy wants to get out of the crisis and to be, again, a key driving force in the EU project.\"\n\nFrench Christian Democrat Joseph Daul praised the Italian prime minister for the reforms in his country and his support for the European project. \"I'm grateful to you for having done your utmost to oppose intergovernmentalism. You have the majority of this house in your debt. This Parliament would like to make another voice heard, that of a Europe based on solidarity, a responsible Europe, a Europe that is politically integrated. You can count on an ally in the European Parliament.\"\n\nAustrian Social Democrat Hannes Swoboda said fiscal discipline would be more palatable to citizens if there was growth and employment while tax evasion was being tackled effectively. \"There are many declarations but actions are still missing. The EIB should be able to have more credit possibilities and the ECB should do its utmost to promote growth.\"\n\nBelgian Liberal Guy Verhofstadt also praised the Italian prime minister: \"In a few weeks you did a great job and you put Italy back on track.\" But he continued: \"Dear Mario, you need more than compliments. We need to reduce interest rates for European countries and for Italy, which is paying three times more than Germany.\"\n\nGreen MEP Rebecca Harms, from Germany, questioned Mr Monti about the emphasis on cuts in Greece. \"You talked a lot about budgetary discipline and discipline in general, do you think; as the person giving the task to clean things up in Italy, that it's intelligent budgetary discipline only to make cuts? Because what's happening in Greece right now is just cuts and cuts alone. And despite all of the cuts, the majority of citizens in the country, in particular poorer people, are finding things worse and worse. Is that the way out of the crisis for a country in crisis? Is that sustainable?\"\n\nBritish Conservative Martin Callanan said: \"Markets have responded positively to the proposed reform plans in Italy. Fiscal consolidation and economic reform could work in Italy, but not in Greece. There is no shortage of statements about growth but so far they have failed. Europe and the single market doesn't need more rules but liberalisation and competition.\"\n\nFar left French MEP Patrick Le Hyaric said he thought that the discipline we are talking about is only for the people and not for the financial actors. \"What kind of democracy is a democracy where there's only austerity, security and control?\"\n\nItalian eurosceptic Francesco Enrico Speroni criticised the prime minister for not having a democratic mandate for what he was doing. \"You were appointed prime minister without having won democratic elections and you are excelling in the capacity as the enforcer for international finance, making people pay up.\"\n\nMaro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, who attended on behalf of the European Commission, said: \"Italy entered the crisis in a vulnerable position. Monti's government has adopted a broad range of measures on taxation, pensions and public administration that have helped stabilise her position. The European Commission welcomes the decisive actions and stands ready to assist Italy, for example in combating youth unemployment.\""}, {"url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/catching-up-with-mario-monti/", "page_content": "MILAN \u2014 Mario Monti is worried about the break-up of Europe.\n\nFor the first time in a long academic and political life spent in and around the European project, Monti fears that a combination of morally \"corrupt\" (his word) national politics, structural holes in the Brussels machine, and external crises may trigger the collapse of the EU.\n\nOr, worse -- the return of the bloody past that preceded it.\n\nMilan was basking in unseasonably warm weather when the former Italian prime minister and European commissioner sat down for an interview with POLITICO last week. But inside the airy office of the president of Bocconi University, the 73-year-old Italian's current role, the mood was anything but sunny.\n\n\"The EU is going through a crisis which leads me and others for the first time to consider whether we are not heading towards disintegration,\" Monti said, with his calm tone and deliberate cadence only emphasizing the seriousness of his words.\n\n\"The EU has never been hit by such a high number of different crises of this gravity,\" he continued, referring to the migration problem, the rise of terrorism, and the bloc's persistent economic malaise. \"What I am concerned about is that, although the EU has developed itself historically through a process of crisis, response to the crisis, and advancement, this time around it may well not happen.\"\n\nMonti's skepticism over the wisdom of Jean Monnet -- who famously said that \"Europe will be forged in crises\" -- stems from his low opinion of national governments and the body that represents them in the Brussels' pantheon: the European Council.\n\nHaving himself been in the EU's executive branch \u2014 as both commissioner for the internal market and more famously as competition czar, and then as prime minister of Italy in the European Council \u2014 Monti is clear on where the fault lies.\n\nIn [Monti's] view, the Council's rise has been coupled with the steady drift of national political discourses towards nationalism, populism and a focus on the short-term.\n\n\"Nobody could seriously pretend that the full-time EU institutions [the Commission, Parliament, European Central Bank, and European Court of Justice] are the ones responsible for the lack of adequate and timely responses to the present constellation of crises,\" he said. \"That is the Council, in particular in its highest formation, i.e., the European Council.\"\n\nWhile he was in office, Monti's critics often charged that his training as an academic economist and his technocratic bent meant he wasn't as skilled as the \"professionals\" in the dark art of politics.\n\nBut today, perhaps because he is largely out of the fray after a disappointing showing in the 2013 Italian elections, Monti is crystal clear on what's gone wrong at the pinnacle of EU decision making.\n\n\"I think the turning point was the financial crisis, which coincided with the French presidency of 2008,\" he said. \"The problem of the day was rescuing the banks and even rescuing states to some extent. That was to be done with money from member states, not from the tiny EU budget. Therefore, it was inevitable that the power largely shifted from the Commission to the Council and, within it, to the top table, the European Council.\"\n\nIn his view, the Council's rise to prominence has been coupled with the steady drift of national political discourses towards nationalism, populism and a focus on the short-term. \"The degree of mistrust and sheer prejudices between North and South and between East and West has never been so high and so unashamedly voiced,\" he said.\n\nMonti stops there, but his analysis contains an implicit criticism of the abrasive tactics practiced by Matteo Renzi, the current Italian prime minister, on the EU stage.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this has started to pay off, at least in the short-term, for politicians who cultivate the gut feelings of their citizens. Even heads of government and ministers belonging to traditionally pro-European parties now indulge in this habit. They hit out at the EU and also to other member states in bilateral acrimony.\"\n\nBy now, his disgust for this \"gut-feeling\" politics is almost bursting through Monti's polite persona of an old-fashioned Italian gentleman.\n\n\"In a sense, we live in mature democracies, but opinion-makers and citizens are still characterized by the medieval attitude of condoning, of being lenient to, les caprices du prince [the whims of the prince],\" he said. \"A politician is brought to trial, rightly, if he steals a glass or he displays a corrupt behavior. But the greatest 'corruption' of all, which is to misuse the democratic process for a clear political self-interest, is something that is taken as a natural state of life.\"\n\nWith his age and experience, Monti is a bridge between a period of fitful but relentless European integration and the current moment when the idea of an \"ever-closer Union\" is being attacked on all fronts. But he contended that his views are borne out of genuine fear rather than nostalgia.\n\n\"If it is an irreversible process, we are going to lose our democracies in our member states,\" he said. \"Because what is at stake now ... is the first wave of an earthquake deriving, in my view, from deeper stresses in the underground of politics. But at the same time, there is also a declining trust in national authorities, a declining participation in votes, a growing impatience with the lack of performance by national governments.\"\n\nThe question is what he and other members of the traditional European elite can do about this.\n\nThere is a long pause and then: \"Not much.\" Then another pause before a call for an \"intellectual insurgency\" to expose the cynicism of national governments when dealing with Europe.\n\nMonti sees his latest European assignment, which he has to deliver by year's end, as an attempt to rectify some of the wrongs he sees.\n\n\"It should be made clear to the public that often positions held [in the European Council] not only do not respond to a general European interest but in most cases, they ... are mainly motivated by the party's political, if not the personal political, interest that the leader of the day has back home.\"\n\nIt sounds like a tall order -- precisely because of what Monti described as the \"degradation\" of national politics.\n\nHe is, however, working on a more concrete, technocratic project as chair of the EU's \"high-level group on own resources.\" The name is a classic piece of European linguistic obfuscation that clouds the group's real purpose: to reform and perhaps expand the EU budget.\n\nMonti sees his latest European assignment, which he has to deliver by the end of the year, as an attempt to rectify some of the wrongs he sees.\n\nAccording to him, \"over the past eight, 10 months for the first time in many years, we have seen the member states ... saying, for the refugee crisis, the eurozone crisis, the fight against terrorism, 'hey Brussels, this has to be a new function of yours.' We want to work on the simple logic that if there are new functions, maybe there should also be new resources.\"\n\nBut why does he keep fighting for the EU? Why not enjoy the prestige of heading Italy's most respected university and leave it at that?\n\nLike many times in the past \u2014 when he blocked the mega-merger of General Electric and Honeywell, or when he pushed through deeply unpopular economic reforms in Italy during the eurozone crisis \u2014 Monti is unwavering in his convictions.\n\nHe said he is speaking out \"not for a moral crusade.\" Rather, it is because he believes that \"on European soil, the natural state of affairs is not peace -- if it weren\u2019t for the structured integration of countries, which have a habit of going to war with each other from time to time.\""}, {"url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/a-tough-job-for-mr-monti/", "page_content": "After weeks of market turmoil and political deadlock, where the fate of Europe\u2019s monetary union had become hostage to Italy\u2019s dysfunctional domestic politics, all eyes are now on the new \u2018technocratic\u2019 government that Mario Monti has put together.\n\nA highly respected former European commissioner, whose sober style and professional approach is strikingly in contrast with the flamboyant, personable and yet fundamentally self-centred behaviour of Silvio Berlusconi, Italy\u2019s new prime minister has been brought in with the tough task of devising a credible plan of economic reforms to reduce Italy\u2019s large debt and to boost economic growth.\n\nFor this he will need to win the support of the deeply divided parliament, to aggregate the different interest groups and to reconcile their differences. At the same time the new government will have to reassure international investors that Italy will not follow the example of Greece and that it will rein in its public debt. At stake, in the shorter term, are several basis points in the spread between Italian and German bonds. Over the longer term, it is Italy\u2019s future prosperity.\n\nNot being driven by electoral concerns makes the new government stronger than many of its predecessors. Only a leader without a direct stake in domestic politics, and therefore free from electoral \u2018horse-trading\u2019 and from the preoccupation to capture the marginal votes, stands a chance of \u2018re-setting\u2019 Italy. Indeed, Monti\u2019s designation is a direct consequence of the leading parliamentary coalition\u2019s inability to implement the fiscal measures necessary to stop the escalating cost of servicing the public debt. An interim government that would merely manage the country while preparing for early election \u2013 as in Greece \u2013 would only increase political turmoil and market instability.\n\nThe good and the bad\n\nBeing an outsider is Monti\u2019s strength; it is, though, also his weakness. If he wants to accomplish his goals, he will need to overcome this weakness.\n\nFirst of all, having swiftly put together the new cabinet and obtained the confidence of parliament, Monti now has to win cross-party support for his plan for fiscal consolidation and economic reforms. Reflecting the public opinion\u2019s increasing willingness to accept harsh measures in exchange for stability and improved long-term economic prospects, parliament is likely to give the new prime minister the benefit of the doubt, albeit not its unconditional love. Enjoying a period of truce to implement his programme of reforms will help Monti to achieve the very first goal, to calm the markets and so break the spiral of market distrust.\n\nSecondly, Monti will have to ensure that the government stays in tune with the country. This is not an easy proposition for technocrats whose skills normally lie in devising the right policies rather than in the art of negotiation and political compromise.\n\nIn order to implement the unpopular measures that are necessary to bring the public debt, currently at 120% of gross domestic product, down to a more manageable rate, Monti will have to reach out to the whole country, and not just to the parliament. Along with being fair and broad-based, progressive and complemented by pro-growth policies, austerity measures need to be explained to and supported by the people. Otherwise the inevitable public discontent will turn into widespread protest and derail the reform programme.\n\nFinally, Monti will have to rebuild trust in the political institutions and to re-adjust the country\u2019s moral compass. This is by far the most difficult task. Over the years, too many scandals have deeply discredited Italy\u2019s political elite and distorted the selection of candidates to office, with public offices being used as a reward for loyalty and a bargaining chip for favours. Corruption and bad practice have alienated many people from actively and genuinely engaging in the political debate, while the gap between politicians and civil society has widened. By openly promoting merit rather than favours and by searching for fresh ideas through dialogue with civil society, the new government could stand a chance of improving Italy\u2019s institutional and social framework. Particular attention should be given to women and to the youth, the two groups for which the past two decades did not bring any tangible improvement.\n\nIt is too early to say whether this Monti will succeed. But his mandate comes with the expectation that this should be the beginning of a new reformist period in Italy, a period in which economic reforms are coupled to a broader process of resetting Italy\u2019s institutional framework and re-styling its politics. Failing this, any success that the new government achieves will be short-lived and will be wiped out by the next elected government, whenever it comes in.\n\nPaola Subacchi is the research director for international economics at London-based think-tank Chatham House.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-italy-vote-programme-idUKBRE8BN0FX20121224", "page_content": "ROME (Reuters) - Outgoing Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti has unveiled a reform programme aimed at boosting Italy\u2019s stagnant economy and said he may seek a second term if a credible political force backs his agenda and asks him to lead it.\n\nThe programme is intended to continue the reforms he started when his technocrat government was appointed just over a year ago to save Italy from financial crisis.\n\nHere are some of the main points of the 25-page programme, which is online at www.agenda-monti.it/\n\nEUROPE:\n\nItaly must push for growth policies based on sound public finances, develop a more integrated and dynamic single market, and try to get European Union member states to share more financial risks between them.\n\nIn return, Italy must respect its own budget commitments and follow the guidelines agreed with European partners as the basis for its own economic policies.\n\nPUBLIC FINANCE:\n\nGrowth is only possible on the basis of sound public finances.

There should be zero tolerance for tax evasion.\n\nLABOUR MARKETS:\n\nLabour market rules should be simplified and the so-called \u201cdual system\u201d that divides workers with secure long-term contracts from those on part-time or short-term contracts with few rights broken down.\n\nThere should be more wage bargaining at individual company level, with more emphasis on productivity deals.\n\nTax measures to get more women and young people into workforce should be enacted as well as measures to keep people over 55 years of age in work.\n\nJUSTICE:\n\nRules on corporate fraud should be beefed up and anti-corruption and money laundering legislation extended. The statute of limitations should be extended in some cases to make it easier for courts to fight serious crime. Tougher rules on conflict of interests are needed.\n\nINSTITUTIONAL REFORM:\n\nThe much-criticised electoral law that does not allow the electorate to vote for individual members of parliament should be overhauled, the number of parliamentarians cut, the influence of lobby groups reduced, and state funding of political parties cut.\n\nINDUSTRY, INVESTMENT\n\nMore should be done to attract foreign direct investment with the aim of matching the European average level, companies helped to gain access to credit, and a new industrial restructuring fund created.\n\nLIBERALISATION\n\nProtected industries should be opened up to more competition."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mario_Monti", "page_content": "Mario Monti (born 19 March 1943) is an Italian economist and academic who served as the Prime Minister of Italy from 2011 to 2013, leading a technocratic government in the wake of the Italian debt crisis.\n\nItalian economist and politician (born 1943)\n\nQuick facts: Senator for lifeMario MontiOMRI, Prime Minist... \u25bc\n\nMonti served as a European Commissioner from 1995 to 2004, with responsibility for the Internal Market, Services, Customs and Taxation from 1995 to 1999 and for Competition from 1999 to 2004.

The European debt crisis has been off boil for the past several months, but we all knew it was just a matter of time before the steam started rising again. The question was: What would turn up the heat?\n\nI would have put my money on Spain stumbling into a bailout program, but instead the spark has come from one of the key figures in the euro zone: Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti. The respected economist surprised financial markets on Saturday when he announced he would step down early, after the latest budget passed through Parliament. Italy watchers had assumed he would stay on until fresh elections took place in the spring, but now that poll will likely take place earlier in 2013. Immediately, the debt crisis sprung to life. Yields on Italian 10-year bonds jumped on the news. They are still well below the more dangerous levels reached over the summer, but the negative reaction from investors to Monti\u2019s decision tells us quite a bit about the course of Europe\u2019s debt crisis.\n\n(VIDEO: Interview with Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti)\n\nInvestor concerns make perfect sense. Monti, a former E.U. commissioner, has been one of the most important individuals in Europe\u2019s quest to resolve its debt crisis. In his year in office, Monti managed to pull Italy back from the brink of an ugly tumble, possibly into a bailout or default. He was ushered in a year ago by political parties who realized they needed a technocratic outsider, with limited political interests, to push through the reforms necessary to avert disaster. He quickly lived up to expectations, short-circuiting the usually fractious political process to ram though an austerity budget and a liberalization of Italy\u2019s professions. After months of heated debate, he also managed to get a reform of Italy\u2019s convoluted labor laws enacted, which aims to encourage hiring and ease restrictions on downsizing. Monti was also a loud voice for the struggling economies of the euro zone in summits with the often inflexible leaders of Europe\u2019s stronger, Northern economies, like Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel. In playing this role, Monti was able to quiet concerns about Italy\u2019s economic future and thus drastically bring down borrowing costs. Talk that Italy would require a costly bailout subsided.\n\nThere are those analysts, though, who contend Monti\u2019s tenure was overrated. The labor reform, for example, was watered down from the tougher original plan to appease unions and convince the Parliament to approve it. His budget-cutting policies also helped Italy sink into recession. Here\u2019s what the always cheerful Wolfgang Munchau of the Financial Times had to say about Monti\u2019s record:\n\nThe Monti magic seemed to work for a while \u2014 much longer than I had expected. The yields on Italian 10-year bonds dropped about 200 basis points during his term because investors, desperate for good news, wanted to believe the magic. But Mr. Monti\u2019s year in office has been a bubble, which felt good for investors while it lasted but has deflated. And it will probably take Italians and foreign investors not all that long to realize little has really changed over the past year, except that the economy has fallen into a deep depression.\n\n(MORE: Why Mario Monti Is the Most Important Man in Europe)\n\nStill, there is little doubt that Monti was seen as one of the good guys, at least trying to get things done in a country where getting things done isn\u2019t all that easy. In his wake, he leaves a much more muddled political scene. The cartoonish Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign last year as the economy went into meltdown, is talking up a return and criticizing Monti\u2019s reforms to launch this comeback. The result of all this is that Italy \u2014 and thus the euro zone \u2014 could be headed for another period of financial instability. Here\u2019s research firm Capital Economics from a Dec. 10 report:\n\nThe intended resignation of Italian technocrat Prime Minister Mario Monti is a timely reminder that the euro-zone debt crisis still goes way beyond the problems of Greece \u2026 It was only ever a matter of time before worries over Italy\u2019s position re-emerged. After all, despite some optimism over the structural economic reforms put in place by Monti\u2019s government, the economy\u2019s performance has continued to be very poor indeed \u2026 We stick to our long-held view that Italy will need to undertake a substantial debt restructuring (i.e. default) at some point if it is ever to return its public debt to a sustainable level. Against this background, it would be no surprise if the renewed upturn in Italian bond yields goes much further, and doubts over Italy\u2019s long-term future inside the single currency re-emerge.\n\nSuch fallout from the departure of one person from the 17-nation euro zone tells us a lot about the current state of affairs within the monetary union. Though the turmoil has receded in recent months, it is not due to any meaningful structural change within the euro zone, or improved economic prospects. The attempts to strengthen the governance of the monetary union are proceeding only slowly (still no eurobond, still no fiscal union, still no banking union, etc.). And the economy, burdened by austerity measures and uncertainty, has sunk into a serious recession, with zonewide unemployment hitting record after record. Nor is there much confidence that reform can continue within euro-zone members. Will the next Italian Prime Minister (assuming it isn\u2019t Monti), pick up the reform drive where Monti left off? Maybe, but probably not with the same zeal. What this all means is that the improved sentiment in the euro zone has not been due to any underlying fundamentals or institutional strength, but the actions of a few, devoted people. As soon as one of those people departs the stage, the old concerns and turmoil returns instantaneously.\n\n(MORE: Why the Euro Crisis Is Nowhere Near Being Over)\n\nThe reaction to Monti\u2019s exit also shows the limits of the ability of the European Central Bank (ECB) to quell the crisis. A big reason why markets in Europe have been so calm in recent months is ECB President Mario Draghi, whose inventive bond-buying program, revealed in September, put the powers of the central bank behind financial stability in Europe as never before. However, Draghi and his program can\u2019t fix individual economies or improve their debt position. Ultimately, Draghi needs politicians like Monti to repair the euro zone and ensure the future of the monetary union. The central bank, powerful as it might be, can\u2019t achieve that on its own.\n\nLastly, Monti\u2019s record also shows us the failings of the entire approach to the euro-zone debt crisis. After a year of Monti\u2019s reforms, Italy is not in a much better position economically. Sure, the reforms Monti has introduced will take a while to kick in and boost growth. That\u2019s why in the short term there needs to be more flexibility in policymaking. The austerity-obsessed approach to the crisis continues to weaken already weak economies and make debt and deficit targets harder to achieve.\n\nThe ultimate lesson behind the Monti story in Italy is that despite his best efforts and some reform victories, in the short to medium term Europe\u2019s economic health and its debt crisis have not fundamentally improved. It takes more than one man, no matter how capable, to make that happen.\n\nMORE: Italy\u2019s Mario Monti: Dented Armor, but Still the Only Knight to the Rescue"}, {"url": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2012/01/21/a-good-professor-in-rome", "page_content": "BEFORE the European Union summit on January 30th, Italy's new prime minister, Mario Monti, will have visited the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and the British prime minister, David Cameron, whom he saw on January 18th. Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, has been to see him in Rome. And the French, German and Italian leaders plan a pre-meeting just before the summit.\n\nIt is a far cry from most of the second half of last year, when Europe's leaders did as much as they could to avoid being caught in a photograph with Mr Monti's scandal-tainted predecessor, Silvio Berlusconi. Italy, it seems fair to say, is back at the top table. And that could have far-reaching effects on the euro crisis. For, as he is making increasingly plain, Mr Monti's ideas on how to resolve it are significantly at odds with those of the Germans who have until now been doing most of the ordering\u2014and choosing pretty thin gruel.\n\n\u201cAdherence to fiscal discipline is a necessary condition for growth,\u201d he told an audience at the London Stock Exchange on January 18th. \u201cIt is not however a sufficient condition.\u201d His message to Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy is that the EU must move from reliance only on austerity towards some growth-stimulating measures. This was a view repeated by Standard & Poor's, the rating agency that downgraded nine euro-zone countries, including Italy, on January 13th. Unlike his colleague from France, also downgraded, and the European Commission, Mr Monti did not criticise S&P: indeed, he shared much of its analysis.\n\nMr Monti, who served as the EU's commissioner for the single market and then competition between 1995 and 2004, is a rare creature: an Italian economic liberal. He is not a proponent of harrying Berlin to reflate to boost domestic consumption. But he would like to see the Germans do more to liberalise their own services, to bolster the EU's single market (indeed, he wrote a report for the commission in May 2010 advocating further liberalisation).\n\nIn London this week Mr Monti pledged to back a British effort to complete the single market, and thus to improve competitiveness throughout the EU. Although he believes it is unrealistic to expect Mr Cameron to go back on his refusal in December to sign up to the proposed fiscal compact between EU members, he is keen to involve the British as much as possible.\n\nSpeaking before his visit to London, in his office in Palazzo Chigi in Rome, Mr Monti says: \u201cThe more the UK feels distanced from European construction, the less others are able to benefit from the full influence of the many good things that the UK can help us all to achieve, and therefore there are many areas where I think it would be beneficial to have the UK fully at the table.\u201d\n\nMr Monti acknowledges in his characteristically unhurried, measured way that \u201cit is rather unusual for Italy to be at the forefront of pro-market initiatives.\u201d But he plans to practise at home what he has been preaching abroad. \u201cI am convinced that it is also in Italy's national interest,\u201d he says. On January 19th his cabinet was due to approve an extensive package of measures designed to free up markets and increase competition in a country where cosy cartels have long been the norm. His government of technocrats, which took office in November 2011, is also trying to force labour-market reform on the trade unions and fiscal compliance on Italy's legendarily tax-shy self-employed. This amounts to a hugely ambitious programme.\n\nResistance to change in Italy can be formidable, and violent. Both the advisers most closely associated with labour-market reforms in the past 13 years have been shot dead. Since Mr Monti's government stepped up a drive for increased tax compliance, there have been repeated attacks on branches of the tax-collection agency, some involving rudimentary bombs. Taxi drivers, who expect to lose from the government's liberalisation, caused mayhem in Rome this week, blocking traffic and detonating home-made parcel bombs.\n\nBut the prime minister argues that he has at least two advantages: his experience in Brussels grappling with multinationals and national governments, and the fact that his government is not beholden to any one political faction or interest group. Although unelected, and responsible for an emergency budget in December that inflicted considerable pain on Italians, Mr Monti's administration remains surprisingly popular. The prime minister believes that \u201cthere was in Italy a hidden demand for a boring government which would try to tell the truth in non-political jargon.\u201d\n\nExplore our interactive guide to Europe's troubled economies\n\nSome would add that he has also benefited from the sheer terror spread among Italians over the way that the euro-zone crisis suddenly engulfed their country last year. Benchmark sovereign-bond yields that have repeatedly bobbed around 7%, and a spread between Italian and German debt that has frequently topped 500 basis points, help to explain why they have been so ready to entrust their fate to a government of perceived experts. So far.\n\nBut there is a danger, the prime minister fears, of the \u201cspread effect\u201d turning against his government. Many Italians had hoped that ditching Mr Berlusconi would save them from the wrath of the markets and see bond yields coming down. As Mr Monti noted when speaking on January 18th to the London School of Economics (LSE) they did, gratifyingly, fall at first. But yields then climbed back up towards the sort of levels they had reached under Mr Berlusconi. Sure enough, some Italians have reacted to this by asking if a change of government was really necessary.\n\n\u201cAusterity is not enough, even for budgetary discipline, if economic activity does not pick up a decent rate of growth,\u201d Mr Monti warns. \u201cA lowering in interest rates does not depend only on Italy's efforts but also, and essentially, on Europe's ability to confront the crisis in a more decisive way.\u201d At the LSE, he even donned a university cap, with the quip that he hoped it could represent a cap on interest rates.\n\nHe is studiously vague on how such a cap might be imposed, not least because he and his fellow leaders have agreed not to issue appeals to the independent European Central Bank. And, though he has also said he favours the idea of Eurobonds, he appears to think they are unlikely to come in time to help with the current crisis. But he has left fellow euro-zone leaders in no doubt that, unless some action is taken soon to reward Italians for their efforts by bringing down interest rates, his government might be replaced by something a lot less palatable to them.\n\nWhen Mr Monti referred earlier this month to the threat of growing Euroscepticism in Italy, it was widely seen as an allusion to the populist Northern League, Mr Berlusconi's junior coalition partner during his time in office. But he says the danger is much broader than that. \u201cWhat I see now, week after week, in parliament is a widening of the spread of this attitude...The degree of impatience-cum-hostility to the EU, to the ECB and to Germany is mounting.\u201d It is a warning that his fellow leaders should take to heart."}], "Mario Monti put his economic reforms and austerity policies in place to combat the Italian debt crisis.": [{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/15/mario-monti-eu-backlash-austerity", "page_content": "Italy's outgoing prime minister has warned European leaders that the rigid austerity policies of the past three years have generated mass disaffection with the EU and a populist political backlash.\n\nIn a bitter valedictory statement to a two-day EU summit that ended in Brussels on Friday, Mario Monti, who was crushed in the recent Italian election \u2013 a result that stunned the EU elite \u2013 pleaded for greater scope on economic and fiscal policy in the crisis.\n\nHe complained that other countries such as France and the Netherlands were being granted more breathing space on their spending targets than he had been given over the past 16 months, and said that he had followed EU orders in his policymaking, an admission he did not emphasise during the election campaign.\n\nIn the letter, Monti, a liberal reformer who was the darling of Brussels but roundly rejected by Italian voters, voiced disappointment bordering on a sense of betrayal at the way he was treated by fellow EU leaders, most notably in Berlin and Brussels.\n\n\"Since November 2011,\" when he replaced Silvio Berlusconi as caretaker prime minister, \"Italy has been delivering on all the policy objectives set out by the EU. In the meantime, some member states have been given extra time to reach their budgetary objectives,\" he complained.\n\n\"Not only has Italy not requested any extra time to perform its adjustment, but it did not request any financial assistance from the EU or any other international organisation. On the contrary, Italy has contributed to the financial assistance of other EU countries in need.\"\n\nAttending his final EU summit, Monti warned that the leaders were not acting strongly and fast enough to combat record mass youth unemployment, storing up trouble for themselves at the ballot box.\n\n\"Public support for the reforms, and worse, for the European Union, is dramatically declining, following a trend which is also visible in many other countries across the union,\" he said. \"To revive growth and fight long-term and youth unemployment would be the best message to counter the mounting wave of populism and disaffection with the European Union, showing that Europe is listening to people's concerns.\"\n\nWhile pursuing an agenda of fiscal and structural reform in office, Monti regularly pleaded with Berlin for more flexibility over the eurozone crisis. Ironically, the summit finally agreed to adopt more room for manoeuvre in the application of the eurozone rule book, although this will do little more than soften the harsh edges of the austerity medicine.\n\nMonti also called for the swift application of a German-inspired stick-and-carrot regime, which would see countries commit to \"contracts\" with the European commission on structural reform in return for funding rewards pegged to progress.\n\nThe details of the scheme are to be devised by EU authorities by June.

We need to reduce interest rates for European countries and for Italy, which is paying three times more than Germany.\"\n\nGreen MEP Rebecca Harms, from Germany, questioned Mr Monti about the emphasis on cuts in Greece. \"You talked a lot about budgetary discipline and discipline in general, do you think; as the person giving the task to clean things up in Italy, that it's intelligent budgetary discipline only to make cuts? Because what's happening in Greece right now is just cuts and cuts alone.

Is that sustainable?\"\n\nBritish Conservative Martin Callanan said: \"Markets have responded positively to the proposed reform plans in Italy.

Yet despite years of complaints from across the political spectrum, it took a technocrat-led government and outside pressure from the EU to tackle the problem head-on.\n\nAs Italy is set to pass comprehensive justice reform, pushed by Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, a former European Central Bank chief, and Italian Justice Minister Marta Cartabia, a former Supreme Court judge with no party affiliation, it is yet another victory of technocracy over politics and a demonstration that, if you want to get anything done in Italy, Italy\u2019s parliament and elected leaders are of little use.\n\nThe fact that justice has been a central debate topic in Italy\u2019s traditional politics for the past few decades makes the belated reform even more disgraceful.\n\nIn pre-Draghi, pre-COVID-19 Italy, one of the sharpest ideological divides was between \u201cgiustizialisti\u201d and \u201cgarantisti,\u201d which can be loosely translated to \u201cpro-justice\u201d and \u201cpro-rights,\u201d as if the two were mutually exclusive. The first believed corruption was the country\u2019s main problem and courts were impaired by too many constraints. The latter believed it was an inefficient judiciary tormenting the innocent and the guilty alike.\n\nThe rift has produced some of the most vitriolic partisanship, but what both camps accomplished is \u201cbuttarla in caciara,\u201d the quintessential Italian art of setting off a shouting match to avoid any pragmatic discussion. Although they agree the justice system is deeply flawed, they couldn\u2019t disagree more on what makes it so bad: Is it because it makes it easy to get away with crime, or is it because it exposes citizens to endless proceedings?\n\nBoth camps accomplished \u201cbuttarla in caciara,\u201d the quintessential Italian art of setting off a shouting match to avoid any pragmatic discussion.\n\nTo some extent, both are right. With three degrees of judgment and no double jeopardy clause\u2014meaning defendants can make two appeals but so can prosecutors, even after a verdict of innocence\u2014penal trials last on average four years, exposing the accused to prolonged uncertainty and financial ruin regardless of the outcome. Civil proceedings can often last up to seven years, scaring away international investors. But precisely because they take so long, more than 80,000 trials expire without a verdict each year because they have languished beyond the statute of limitations\u2014making it easy for some criminals to go unpunished, especially if they\u2019re wealthy.\n\nThe party that has most embodied \u201cgiustizialismo\u201d in the past few years is the Five Star Movement, which, eschewing the right-left distinction, has styled itself as primarily anti-corruption or, as critics say, pro-jail. Five Star leaders have used slogans like \u201conest\u00e0\u201d (\u201chonesty\u201d) and \u201ctutti in galera\u201d (\u201clet\u2019s send them all to jail\u201d), held press conferences with oranges to mock officials on trial, and greeted rivals with the handcuff gesture.\n\nThe right-wing populist League party used to display similar, if more macabre, \u201clock them up\u201d symbolism: In the 1990s, a League lawmaker famously waved a noose in Italy\u2019s parliament, and more recently, another one displayed a cardboard pitchfork. (In his defense, it looked more like a spork.) But the party had to tweak its line after it got caught up in its own corruption scandal in 2017.\n\nThe garantismo cause has been championed, out of personal interest, by Silvio Berlusconi, the controversial tycoon and four-time Italian prime minister who waged rancorous campaigns against prosecutors who repeatedly indicted him. (He was convicted for tax fraud in 2013.) But making the courts more citizen-friendly is also a flagship issue for the galaxy of small centrist forces that populate Italy\u2019s landscape, such as the Italian Radicals party and former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s Italia Viva party as well as for parts of the Democratic Party (PD). Small centrist parties and the most elitist part of the PD have their constituencies in the highly educated bourgeoisie of large cities that idolize U.S.-style civil liberties.\n\nItalian politics\u2019 fixation on justice has roots in the early 1990s, when a massive bribe scandal disrupted the Cold War elite and exposed widespread corruption but also unleashed a guilty-until-proven-innocent attitude on one side and an open disdain for the rule of law on the other.\n\nFor three decades, no major political party made any serious attempts to make courts more efficient. The few practical efforts made focused on the statute of limitations rather than on the causes behind its widespread expiration before cases conclude. (In Italy, the statute of limitations is not the maximum time between a crime and the beginning of a trial; it\u2019s the maximum time between the crime and the end of a trial. And because trials are so long, the statute basically serves as an expiration date for trials. If, by the end of the statute of limitations, the trial hasn\u2019t reached a verdict, it simply ends with no resolution and everyone goes home\u2014although this does not apply to murder, terrorism, or major mafia crimes.)\n\nThe pro-rights camp attempted to make it shorter and the pro-justice camp longer. As political commentator Jacopo Tondelli, editor of the left-leaning magazine Gli Stati Generali, put it, Italy\u2019s judicial system \u201cwas like a patient sick with cancer and hepatitis, but politicians kept quarreling on aspirin dosage.\u201d\n\nFor three decades, no major political party made any serious attempts to make courts more efficient.\n\nBy contrast, Draghi and Cartabia\u2019s reform focuses heavily on putting courts in the position of working better and faster: first, by establishing the institution of clerkship\u2014previously unheard of in Italy, which would relieve judges from the burden of having to read and research all the documents themselves\u2014and second, by replacing the statute of limitations with a timetable for each degree of judgment. The first chunk was approved by Italy\u2019s parliament on Sept. 23, and the entire reform is expected to pass within a few weeks.\n\nBoth chambers don\u2019t have room to maneuver. The European Union has demanded reforms as a condition for Rome to receive a stimulus package of $234 billion. Draghi has attached a confidence vote, and right now, no party in the coalition is in the best shape to face early elections.\n\nIn other words, the reform that might finally fix Italy\u2019s justice system passed because Draghi is in a strong position and because the European Union gave Italy no alternative. \u201cPolitical parties are not part of the discussion. They\u2019re squeezed under Draghi,\u201d Tondelli said.\n\nBut although efficient, outsourcing responsibilities to technocrats is both a symptom and one of the causes of the weakness of Italy\u2019s democracy.\n\nIt\u2019s a cycle that keeps repeating itself: Elections produce leaders unfit to deliver much needed reforms or even to govern the country, so when reforms cannot be delayed or when they get themselves in some other kind of trouble, they call a technocrat to do their jobs\u2014like children asking an adult to take over an unfinished task. It happened with former Italian Prime Ministers Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Lamberto Dini, and Mario Monti\u2014all three economists who were called to serve in government following a political crisis: Ciampi\u2019s and Dini\u2019s terms, both in the 1990s, didn\u2019t stop the rise of Berlusconi, and Monti\u2019s term, ending in 2013, contributed to energizing the Five Star Movement. And now it\u2019s happening again with Draghi.\n\nBut this pattern breeds even more distrust for elected officials, which, in turn, leads to populist forces succeeding in the pools\u2014only to fail once they get power. Right now, the only party rising in popularity is the ultra-nationalist Fratelli D\u2019Italia, the only major political force that has not joined the unity government and which has criticized the fact that judicial reform took place without a broad discussion among political parties.\n\nDraghi and Cartabia are on the right track to fix Italy\u2019s broken justice system, and the country needs it. But Italy\u2019s democracy appears to be broken as well, and for that, there\u2019s no fix in sight."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/05/mario-monti-austerity-measures-italy", "page_content": "On Sunday evening Italy's recently formed government approved a set of crisis measures aimed at recouping \u20ac30bn. Italy's prime minister, Mario Monti, called them a \"plan to save Italy\". There were tears, literally. The labour and welfare minister, Elsa Fornero, began to cry as she announced changes to pensions that will bring the pension age for women to 62 and for men to 66. The change will also see increases in the minimum number of years taxpayers need to work before being able to retire, and critically the plans will delink pensions from inflation for all but lower payments.\n\nThe austerity measures breakdown into \u20ac12-13bn of cuts (in addition to pensions, the guillotine mainly fell on local authorities) and \u20ac17-18bn of tax increases.\n\nAhead of the announcement, there had been a lot of speculation in the Italian media that the government was set to increase income tax for those earning more than \u20ac75,000 a year. This did not happen. Instead, the government focused its tax increases mainly on property and assets \u2013 reintroducing taxes on first homes and raising existing levies, increasing the levy on second homes by up to 75% and increasing taxes on yachts, private jets and luxury cars. Throughout, Monti was adamant in stressing the fairness of his measures \u2013 a point he underlined by saying that he won't be taking a salary as prime minister. In addition to taxes on luxuries, the government also introduced a levy on bonds and shares held by investors and a 1.5% tax on capital bought into Italy last year from abroad (this may explain German Bundesbank estimates that \u20ac80bn of capital was taken out of Italy in August and September).\n\nThe government also announced that VAT would be increased again, to 23%, if needed, in the second half of 2012 \u2013 it is very likely this will happen.\n\n\u20ac20bn of the \u20ac30bn will go towards reducing Italy's deficit (which the government is committed to eliminating by 2013), while \u20ac10bn will be used to support growth measures, including tax relief for businesses that reinvest profits, support for young people and women, the liberalisation of several professions and an enterprise guarantee scheme for SMEs.\n\nWhile Monti was keen to emphasise that further measures to foster growth and competitiveness will be introduced in due course, including plans for infrastructure projects and to cut the cost of politics, several commentators pointed out how the plan was heavy on tax and cuts but light on growth.\n\nMonti had two main audiences: the markets, which on Monday morning seemed happy with the plan \u2013 the FTSE MIB rose 3%, the BTP-Bund spread dropped below 400 base points and Italy's 10-year bond yield fell to 6.14%. And, of course, Italians: Italy's unions, vested interests and several politicians across parties all seemed to have something to complain about on Sunday, and each had alternative proposals \u2013 but so long as Monti has the Italian public on his side, he can ignore the noise.\n\nThe government announced that the Italian economy will contract by 0.4-0.5% next year, and growth will be flat in 2013. Italy has barely grown over the past decade and the average Italian was worse off in 2010 than in 2000. Each year 90,000 people leave Italy \u2013 almost a million in the last decade. Italy's bigger problem is a lack of growth and until the country addresses these profound challenges, its problems will remain. To enable long-term growth, far deeper and more radical measures are required. Monti has only been in power a couple of weeks and the stagnant context in which he is operating has taken years to develop. It will take time, but the government needs to start intervening soon, taking on vested interests and political parties' reluctance to change while he has Italians on his side. Its job will be to reform its labour market and improve governance (ensure the rule of law, increase government effectiveness and control corruption). In short, to create a context in which businesses can start up, invest, innovate and grow.\n\nCuts and taxes are one thing, yet I saw little within Monti's plan setting out measures to boost growth and carry out structural reform. More worryingly, the tone and nature of measures was reminiscent of announcements in Athens, Dublin and Lisbon. Across Europe there seems to a monotonous lack of inventiveness. If, and when, Monti starts to introduce more radical change, the political volume is bound to get louder and vested interests more resistant. The government will then have to choose whether to implement the reforms that the country desperately needs. I believe that decision will, one way or the other, shape Mario Monti's legacy."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/16/mario-monti-technocratic-cabinet-italy", "page_content": "Mario Monti, the former European commissioner, has been sworn in as Italy's prime minister along with the ministers of his new, technocratic government, charged with steering the eurozone's most indebted nation out of danger.\n\nThe 17-strong cabinet will be able to bring to bear on Italy's daunting problems a formidable amount of intellectual fire-power. More than a third of the seats in the cabinet will be occupied by professors, including the prime minister himself. Monti, a distinguished liberal economist, kept the finance and economics portfolios. He handed the economic development and infrastructure portfolios to Corrado Passera, the chief executive of Italy's biggest retail bank, Intesa Sanpaolo.\n\nThree of the cabinet ministers are women, and two were appointed to top jobs: Anna Maria Cancellieri as interior minister and Paola Severino as justice minister. Elsa Fornero will have heavy responsibilities as minister for welfare and employment.\n\nSpeaking after announcing his cabinet, Monti said: \"We feel sure of what we have done and we have received many signals of encouragement from our European partners and the international world. All this will, I trust, translate into a calming of that part of the market difficulty which concerns our country.\"\n\nThe new government took office at a time when Italy was engulfed by the eurozone crisis, with its benchmark borrowing costs at an unsustainably high level of more than 7%. The swearing in of the new government made little difference to sovereign yields but it appeared to cheer the Milan bourse which closed almost 0.8% up on a day that saw Frankfurt and London lose ground.\n\nMonti confirmed he would take on the prime ministership after two days of consultations. The uncertainties surrounding the formation of the new government were maintained to the end by a much longer than expected two-and-a-half hour meeting between the incoming prime minister and the president.\n\nThe names on the list of his ministers \u2013 most of which were unknown to members of the Italian general public \u2013 showed that Monti had failed in his attempt to involve party representatives. His cabinet was made up exclusively of non-aligned specialists.\n\n\"The absence of political personalities in the government will help rather than hinder a solid base of support for the government in parliament and in the political parties because it will remove one ground for disagreement,\" he said.\n\nThe economics professor turned eurocrat managed to stave off \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 demands from the outgoing prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, and his party for the new government to have a limited programme and a fixed lifespan. The influence that Berlusconi's Freedom party will exercise over the new government was nevertheless made clear in the run-up to Wednesday's announcement.\n\nMonti spent three hours at a meeting that finished after 2.30am, with Angelino Alfano, the secretary of Berlusconi's party, trying to reach agreement on the names of the new ministers. Berlusconi was ousted after losing his majority last week in the lower house of parliament, the chamber of deputies. But he and his former coalition allies in the Northern League can still command a majority in the senate. The prime minister will have to outline his government's programme and seek votes of confidence in both houses of parliament. The first is due to take place in the Senate on Thursday evening.\n\nPresident Giorgio Napolitano asked Monti to form a government after Berlusconi's rightwing coalition lost a crucial vote in the lower house on the 2010 public accounts.\n\nMeanwhile, Greece's new technocrat government won a confidence vote in parliament with a large majority , backing a pledge by prime minister Lucas Papademos to speed up long-term reforms and secure a massive new bailout deal involving banks and rescue creditors. In the country's 300-member parliament, 255 voted in favour of the new government formed last week by the majority socialists, rival conservatives and a small right-wing nationalist party. Only 38 voted against, while the remaining seven were absent."}, {"url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2013/1/4/technocracys-new-bet-mario-monti-runs-for-premiership/", "page_content": "The rationale of Monti\u2019s proposals in Italy is \u201cnot so different from Cameron\u2019s austerity programme in the UK\u201d.\n\nMario Monti\u2019s decision to run for premiership as leader of a centrist alliance in the next Italian general elections will have wide-ranging effects on the future of Italian politics. His entry into the political arena will provoke major re-alignments in strategies, programmes and personnel in the centre-right and centre-left coalitions. His ambitious agenda of reforms will strongly influence the policies of the next government.\n\nTo fully understand the extent of these changes, we also need to look back over the past year. Has the technocratic government achieved its intended goals and why is there still so much pressure from national and international quarters for Monti to stay on?\n\nRise and fall of the technocratic government\n\nIn the second half of 2011, in an international context already marked by fears of contagion following the Greek debt crisis, worries about Italy\u2019s ability to sustain its enormous national debt spread quickly among investors. Berlusconi\u2019s government, with its reputation tarnished by scandals, pending court cases and political infighting, did not offer the reassurances needed by the markets.\n\nIn November 2011, Italian 10-year bond yields rose above 7 percent. The international consensus was that this rate was unsustainable for a highly indebted country like Italy: the country was headed towards a default on its debt repayments. The size of Italy\u2019s economy meant that a wholesale bailout by the EU and the IMF was simply not an option. Such a scenario could indeed precipitate a financial crisis in an already vulnerable eurozone.\n\nWhile Berlusconi was not deemed fit to govern by the international community, holding general elections straight away would have aggravated Italy\u2019s political instability. The centre-left opposition was as unprepared as Berlusconi\u2019s centre-right coalition to guide Italy through such a delicate phase.\n\nAfter consulting all parties represented in parliament, the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano appointed Mario Monti as Prime Minister on November 13, 2011. He was to lead a technocratic government composed by unelected experts, supported in parliament by Berlusconi\u2019s People of Freedom Party, the centrist Christian Democrats and the reformist centre-left Democratic Party.\n\nHis mandate was clear: to implement drastic measures to reduce national debt and far-reaching structural reforms to liberate internal markets from the stronghold of state dependence. All this was to be achieved in little more than a year, before the natural end of the legislature. This \u201cundemocratic\u201d solution orchestrated under strong pressure from the EU and international financial markets was backed by the vast majority of Italians, animated by a deep lack of trust in the ability and good faith of their national politicians.\n\nOnly 13 months later, on December 6, 2012, in a surreal twist of events, Berlusconi\u2019s People of Freedom Party withdrew its support for the government. The apparent reason was the mounting indignation of the party MPs against the \u201cpartisan\u201d words of the Minister of Economic Development Corrado Passera.\n\nIn a popular TV show, he provided a negative assessment of Berlusconi\u2019s intention to run for premiership in the forthcoming elections. The truth is that Berlusconi just started his electoral campaign, gaining media attention with a sensational, if destructive, gesture. By withdrawing his support on a whim, he sent a clear message that he was not going to let go of his hold over Italian politics. Without a clear majority in parliament, Monti resigned on December 21, 2012, after the approval of the budget law avoided catastrophic effects on the stock markets.\n\nStructural reforms? Thanks, but no thanks\n\nInternational observers were bewildered. Why was Monti resigning now, merely two months before the statutory end of his government? Only a month earlier he had proudly showcased the successes of his government to investors and political leaders in a visit to the Gulf Region, stressing the crucial role that his economic reforms played in restoring market confidence. Up until his decision to resign, the consensus of the mainstream media closely reflected this position.\n\nThis too has quickly changed. Presenting the arguments of authoritative Italian economists who are not at all hostile to Monti\u2019s proposed reforms, reputable analyses recently appeared in the international media (read here and here) are now communicating to the outside world what was already evident to Italian observers: Monti\u2019s government has not delivered on its programme of structural reforms. And yet, the impression he so skilfully mastered on the international scene throughout the past year restored credibility in the Italian political system.\n\nThe first month of government was the most productive. The budget law approved at the end of December 2011 fundamentally reformed the pension system, aligning it with Nordic European countries and producing long-term positive effects on public spending. The same law also significantly increased taxation for ordinary Italians, including the introduction of a much resented tax on first homes \u2013 with no exemptions for lower incomes \u2013 and a substantial VAT rise. At first, these measures were seen by most citizens as \u201cnecessary\u201d given the dramatic situation of Italy\u2019s public finances.\n\nHowever, in the succeeding months, popular consensus for the Italian technocrat waned. People lost sympathy for a government that increased taxes without providing any other relief in an economic environment characterised by high unemployment and negative growth. The absence of concrete measures to stimulate growth and help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) \u2013 the blood of the Italian economy \u2013 also contributed to his decline of popularity.\n\nHis government did nothing to alleviate the lending crisis that started in 2008 and negatively affects many productive SMEs that desperately need credit to keep afloat. Italian banks preferred to use massive injections of liquidity from the European Central Bank to buy Italian bonds. This contributed to keep national borrowing costs low during Monti\u2019s tenure but had no direct positive effects on the real economy.\n\nThe other reforms approved by the parliament in 2012 look more like the half-baked measures introduced by previous governments than the required structural reforms initially announced by Monti.\n\nThe liberalisations were mostly cosmetic and did not produce major improvements in competitiveness and market transparency. The number of licences available for pharmacies and taxi drivers was increased, for instance, without de facto opening up these markets to competition.\n\nStrategic sectors like energy and transportation were not included in the legislation. Italy\u2019s internal markets are still in the hands of oligopolies and closed shops. Too many people live at the margins of an economy that does not fairly redistribute its gains according to skill and effort.\n\nThe labour market reform was not far-reaching either. It did not simplify an inordinately complex and inefficient system of labour contracts. It extended unemployment benefit coverage to some previously unprotected workers, but left Italy among the very few European countries without a universal unemployment subsidy.\n\nMonti\u2019s labour reform did not significantly address the enormous disparities in social security between permanent workers and the increasing numbers of workers under short-term contracts. Low salaries, excessive red tape and unequally distributed social protection, continue to shape Italy\u2019s labour market, just as they did one year ago.\n\nThe spending review programme, aimed at rationalising the way state resources are utilised and managed, ended up in a bluff. Following the path of Berlusconi\u2019s Minister of Economy and Finance, the government executed modest linear budget cuts, without a proper review of their impact on service delivery.\n\nThe incredibly high costs of Italian politics, ranging from exorbitant salaries, allowances and pension privileges for elected officials in local and national government to generous subsidies for media, newspapers and other organisations controlled by political parties, were not on the whole affected.\n\nA proposal to reduce the number of Italian provinces, intermediate local governments devoid of effective power and bearing huge costs for the taxpayer, did not make it into a parliamentary vote. Despite all the talk, Monti\u2019s austerity meant higher taxes and short-term minor reductions in public spending to keep the deficit in line, but very little in the way of structural adjustments with long-term effects.\n\nFinally, the anti-corruption law was one of the \u201chighlights\u201d of the last days of the technocratic government. Corruption is a particularly sensitive theme for national and international investors. Its notoriously high levels have a negative impact on the successful and lawful conduct of business activities. The new legislation introduces harsher punishments for corruption crimes and extends its reach to new areas of corruption previously excluded.\n\nHowever, these changes have been made within the wider context of a highly inefficient legal system. Italian courts are slow and cases are frequently dropped without a definitive sentence because of statutory time limits on the prosecution of crimes. A full overhaul of the legal system is required for measures like the anti-corruption law to achieve its intended benefits. Monti did not tackle any of these structural issues.\n\nEach reform announced by the technocratic cabinet was diluted by strenuous negotiations with political parties, professional and employers\u2019 associations, trade unions and other corporatist interests. The drawn out process of parliamentary approvals further weakened the proposed measures. Amendments at the hand of parliamentary committees finally succeeded in neutralising any prospect for real change.\n\nNor was the selection of the cabinet members as transparent and meritocratic as Monti claimed. The experts who were called in to inject new life into the system came from the ranks of minister directorates, public organisations and industry and banking elites who had been so integral to Italy\u2019s relentless decline. They were not immune from the \u201cvices\u201d of Italian politics.\n\nFor instance, the controversial Minister of Labour, Elsa Fornero, made it a point to present herself as an icon of Anglo-Saxon rigour. In her public appearances, she often \u201cdisciplined\u201d Italian youth for their unwillingness to adapt to global change.\n\nMario Monti considers return as Italian PM\n\nIn line with the nepotistic practices of Italian academia, she holds a professorship in the same university where her husband and daughter occupy permanent positions. Elsa Fornero was also vice-president of a prestigious Italian foundation, Compagnia di San Paolo, at the time when her daughter Silvia received research funds from the same organisation.\n\nOne of Monti\u2019s junior ministers resigned because of his connections with an entrepreneur investigated for corruption. Another junior minister resigned after receiving notice of investigation for tax fraud. There is no doubt that the conduct of cabinet members was on the whole well above the appalling standards of the preceding government. Yet, Monti\u2019s team offered no radical break from the past.\n\nMonti\u2019s new bet\n\nSince he announced his decision to run for premiership in the February 2013 general elections, Monti\u2019s message has changed. Sensitive to the scrutiny of international observers, Monti knows that he cannot continue with an overtly positive assessment of the current state of affairs. He now admits that much more needs to be done to transform the political system and stabilise the economy.\n\nThe argument is that the pace of reform has been slowed down by the lack of conviction of the parliamentary majority that backed his government and the outright opposition of many divergent interests \u2013 ranging from Berlusconi\u2019s refusal to support legal reforms that would negatively impact on his activities, to left-wing resistance against a radical restructuring of the labour market and the welfare state.\n\nWhat is the solution to this impasse? To legitimise the Monti Agenda \u2013 a 25 page programme available on the internet \u2013 through the democratic process. A coalition of centrist parties, business interests and civil society movements have now endorsed the agenda as their political programme in the next general elections. Technocracy cannot succeed where politics failed.\n\nEuropean political elites and the international financial world see Monti\u2019s transformation into a frontline politician as a viable solution to reassure markets that Italy will not default on its national debt repayments, and will undertake the structural reforms indicated by EU technocrats.\n\nDespite these hopes, it is in the short and medium term that Monti\u2019s entry into the democratic contest will have the strongest effects. His candidacy for premiership is supported by the Christian Democrats, a civil society movement of reformists and Catholics named Future Italy, segments exiting Berlusconi\u2019s People of Freedom Party, and elements leaving the centre-left Democratic Party.\n\nHe is not running to win the elections and hence is unlikely to become the next Italian Prime Minister. Polls assign to his coalition no more than 20 percent of the votes. However, the current electoral law assigns no clear majority prize in the Senate, one of the two elected houses of parliament. It is highly probable that the centre-left coalition \u2013 leading in the polls with 35 percent to 40 percent of the votes \u2013 will need to seal a post-electoral alliance with Monti\u2019s coalition to form a stable government.\n\nThis scenario would trigger deeper changes in the political landscape. Monti\u2019s political wager will possibly accelerate the process of disintegration of the moderate centre-right under Berlusconi\u2019s leadership. The Italian tycoon is well known for sudden shifts in policy and rhetoric. He is now riding the wave of populist anti-EU and anti-austerity sentiments and his party might secure around 20 percent of the votes. These numbers are a far cry from previous election results, but will enable Berlusconi to play a major role in the next parliament.\n\nThe price to pay is the dwindling support of moderate voters who have been the backbone of his success since 1994. Monti is the real enemy here. Unlike the centre-left, he has not fallen into the old trap of embracing a strong anti-Berlusconi stance. This effectively marks the end of an era when each national election would play out as a referendum pro or against Berlusconi.\n\nAt the same time, Monti\u2019s centre could destabilise an already fragile centre-left coalition. The policy ambiguities that marred the efficacy of centre-left governments in 1996 and 2006 have not been addressed. The leading party, the Democratic Party, includes explicitly pro-Monti elements alongside ex-communist factions wary of Monti\u2019s neoliberal positions.\n\nFurthermore, the Democrats are allied with the post-communist party Left Ecology Freedom, led by Nichi Vendola, a charismatic politician who openly opposes Monti\u2019s policies. A post-elections deal with the centrist coalition has the potential to radicalise these internal tensions and neutralise the post-communists\u2019 influence over the next government.\n\nIn the long run, it might also contribute to the gradual emptying out of the Democratic Party: the lack of a clear consensus on a coherent programme of reforms is hindering the party\u2019s internal cohesion. Influential MPs have already left to join Monti\u2019s group. Other sections traditionally aligned with the ex-communist trade union CGIL might move further left on the political spectrum.\n\nThe effects of these re-alignments will probably be exacerbated by the increasing fragmentation of the political landscape. Running for the first time in general elections, the anti-establishment 5 Star Movement will capitalise on popular discontent and is expected to obtain between 15 percent and 20 percent of the votes. Led by activist comedian Beppe Grillo, this political formation is positioned on radical anti-EU, anti-austerity and anti-corruption stances.\n\nTalk to Al Jazeera \u2013 Mario Monti:\n\n\u2018Italy is done with austerity\u2019\n\nGrillo made it clear that his movement will not pursue strategic alliances with any other party, but push for radical change through parliamentary action. Mounting dissatisfaction with traditional democratic mechanisms will also be reflected in what is likely to be the lowest voter turnout in republican history: undecided voters, abstentions and blank votes are currently estimated between 30 percent and 40 percent.\n\nSupported by a relatively small fraction of the electorate, Monti\u2019s proposals seem destined to maintain their monopoly over Italian mainstream politics for some time. The problem of democratic legitimacy posed by the arrival of an unelected technocratic government will remain, in another form.\n\nWill Monti change Italy?\n\nNot surprisingly, many Italians are asking pressing questions that reach beyond the elaborate chess games of professional politics: is the Monti Agenda suited for the task ahead? Will it bring about structural reforms and make Italy\u2019s public finances more sustainable? Will it contribute to establish a more equitable and meritocratic internal market?\n\nThere are two major factors that will work against the effective implementation of Monti\u2019s programme. For one, Monti is likely to encounter the same internal obstacles that undermined the efforts of his first government. The main resistance to change will come from the very system he is now endorsing by running for premiership: that complex web of vested interests represented by political parties and other social blocs, in particular professional associations, industrialists and trade unions. Their basic political instinct is to oppose any significant alteration of the status quo.\n\nThe parties and movements behind Monti\u2019s political project are an integral part of this system. We do not know whether they are really willing to forego short-term gains and abandon fortified positions to help generate real change. Based on past and recent behaviour, the likelihood of achieving these aims through a reformist consensus seeking approach is rather low.\n\nDuring the electoral campaign, ambiguous entanglements with entrenched interests will increase. Monti and his team will get their hands dirty in real life politics, chasing votes, striking local and national deals with various factions, following polls and media ratings, adjusting promises and aspirations accordingly. There is a high chance that many of the agenda items will be compromised in the process.\n\nThe other reason has to do with basic macroeconomics. Monti is proposing high-reaching targets on debt reduction: 5 percent reduction in national debt stock per year from 2015 until the total stock is reduced to 60 percent of gross domestic product \u2013 currently it is standing at 126 percent. This would only be possible with high growth, coupled by painful cuts in public spending.\n\nThe rationale of Monti\u2019s proposals is not so different from Cameron\u2019s austerity programme in the UK: free up the market, reduce the weight of government and let the economy adjust itself.\n\nBut the prospects for the global economy, especially the eurozone, look grim. European economies will grow slowly, if at all, for many years to come. Italy has struggled with low growth rates for the last two decades. Why should we believe that wide-ranging Thatcher-style market reforms will stimulate high growth in such a conjuncture?\n\nThere is also a major difference with Britain. Italian workers receive very low salaries compared to most of their European counterparts. Further liberalisation without a comparable rebalancing of social protection would effectively mean a low-cost economy driven by cheap labour, reduced quality and quantity of social services and rising socio-economic inequalities.\n\nFor both these reasons, the continuation of the technocratic agenda by political means is unlikely to result in anything more than a face-lift. Two Italian commentators referred to the excitement around Monti in international circles as the \u201cMonti bubble\u201d, comparing it to a financial bubble.\n\nHis electoral debut might sustain the bubble, keeping confidence in the Italian government artificially high and interest rates on Italian bonds low. But for how long? Monti is aware that his decision to enter frontline politics \u201ccarries many risks and a high probability of failure\u201d. If he does fail, how bad will the next collapse in international credibility hit Italy and its people?\n\nVito Laterza recently completed his PhD in Social Anthropology at the University of Cambridge and is currently a Research Fellow at the University of the West of England.

It follows a week in which members of Berlusconi's Freedom People party abstained from voting for key bills in parliament. Monti said on Saturday he had received a \"categorical judgment of no confidence\" from Berlusconi's party.\n\nBerlusconi has said he will back the passing of the budget but will not guarantee further support for Monti's government of technocrats, who were drafted after Berlusconi resigned in November 2011 in the midst of scandals over his private life and a brewing economic crisis.\n\nMonti, who has depended on the votes of the Freedom People in parliament and Berlusconi's grudging support, has long said he would not seek to govern if his backing dried up.\n\nAfter weeks of indecision, Berlusconi kickstarted his comeback last week by accusing Monti of bringing Italy to \"the edge of an abyss\" with austerity policies that have reassured markets but have helped mire Italy in recession.

In the years since 2007, the number of job-seekers has doubled and a series of long-standing critical issues, such as youth and long-term unemployment, have dramatically worsened. The Italian government initially responded to the Great Recession by maintaining previous institutional arrangements, trying to adapt them in order to cushion the social consequences of the recession. Nevertheless, after the 2011 sovereign debt crisis, the situation changed and a new wave of reforms started.\n\nThe present chapter describes these changes and assesses the direction that they have taken by comparing policies before and after the onset of the recent economic downturn. Although it is not possible to detect a single trajectory of change in Italian labour market policies, our argument is that we can observe an overall tendency towards a peculiar version of \u2018welfare readjustment\u2019 (H\u00e4usermann, 2012), a pattern of reform in which governments curtail industrial-type policy instruments, such as income or job protections for insiders, while adopting new social policies. In Italy, this \u2018readjustment process\u2019 in the domain of labour market policies has been realised through the adoption of some provisions that favour \u2018outsiders\u2019 and, at the same time, the drastic retrenchment of labour rights for workers on open-ended contracts. As a result, the boundaries between \u2018insiders\u2019 and \u2018outsiders\u2019 now appear more blurred than they were before the outbreak of the Great Recession.\n\nThe chapter is divided into four sections.

The future of Spain was uncertain as investors and business owners questioned whether Spain would stay in the Eurozone. Hiring and credit markets froze; unemployment rose to 20% in 2010 from 8% in 2008 and loans over \u20ac1 million to companies dropped 25% from 2009 to 2010 , as companies awaited a response from the Spanish government. Yet, then Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero was slow to institute any significant reforms. The socialist leader had political pressure from the left to uphold government services and labor-friendly labor laws.\n\nIn 2011 Mariano Rajoy was elected as a more conservative candidate from the People's Party, as voters showed their frustration with Zapatero's response to the crisis. With an absolute majority in the legislature with 186 of 350 seats, Rajoy immediately began implementing reforms to address the issues.\n\nThe reforms that the Rajoy government enacted in response to the crisis, highlighted in Table 1, can be placed into three main categories: financial market reforms, fiscal measures and labor market reforms. Each reform was put into place to stabilize the macroeconomy of Spain and to allow for the return to capital markets for both the government and businesses. The Spanish economy needed a renewed sense of credibility within global markets, and the reform effort was aimed at reinstating this credibility to put Spain on the road to recovery.\n\nTable 1: Spanish Economic Reforms, 2010 - 2012\n\nFinancial Market Reforms\n\nTo restore confidence in the periphery: countries like Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece outside the core of Europe, on August 2, 2012 the European Central Bank's president Mario Draghi announced that the ECB was prepared to undertake Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) to aid ailing countries, and that Spain would be granted up to \u20ac100 billion to salvage its banking system. The ECB recognized that the system that had allowed for the origination of millions of mortgages in Spain, many of which were to subprime borrowers with little equity to back up the loans, needed to be changed. In exchange for the ECB's pledge of support, Spain was required to administer certain reforms in its financial system.\n\nFirst, on August 31, 2012, with the Spanish Royal Decree-Law 24/2012, the Spanish Government created SAREB (Sociedad de Gesti\u00f3n de Activos procedentes de la Reestructuraci\u00f3n Bancaria) that functioned as a typical 'bad bank.' \u20ac40 billion worth of assets were transferred from four of Spain's previously nationalized financial institutions: BFA:Bankia, Catalunya Banc, NGC Banco-Banco Gallego and Banco de Valencia. These assets consisted of bad loans from the mortgage crisis and allowed the original institutions to focus on their business while a new entity could focus solely on the restructuring and sale of the bad assets. The government branch, the Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring, owns 45% of SAREB while private shareholders hold the other 55%. The bank has 15 years to dispose of the assets and aims to make a 15% cumulative profit.\n\nThe next task was to better capitalize Spain's functioning banks. Many banks, with low amounts of capital in the first place, had yet to write off all of the underperforming loans due to the housing crisis. In order to avoid another crisis of the same scale, and instill confidence in the banking system, the European Union ordered banks to raise their capital levels in line with the European Central Bank stress tests of 6% of assets. Banks receiving state aid were required to shed their riskiest assets to comply with risk-weighted capital requirements.\n\nFinally, Spain set out to rein in the largely unregulated 'caja' system that had been in place for hundreds of years. Spain instituted a reform of the framework for regulation, allowing for a Single Supervisory Mechanism over the banking system and enhancing the Banco de Espa\u00f1a's regulatory and supervisory powers, granting them sanctioning and licensing power. The reforms required that the cajas have formal shareholders with a system to distribute profits, and attempted to centralize the regulatory authorities in order to place the same requirements on all banks and reduce the risk of shadow banking that helped lead to the housing bubble of 2008.\n\nEach of these reforms attempted to restore the banks' access to funding markets, to allow for banks to start lending to businesses once more and, eventually, to propel the economy forward.\n\nFiscal Measures\n\nIn the aftermath of the crisis, the Spanish budget immediately saw a disproportionate decrease in revenues rather than a significant increase in expenditures. The Spanish government increased its expenditures by a cumulative 6% of GDP from 2007 to 2011, which was in line with the rest of the Eurozone; in fact, its level of expenditure in 2011 (45% of GDP) was below the Eurozone average of 50% of GDP. Revenues, on the other hand, decreased 5.4% of GDP from 2007 to 2011, more than any other country in the Eurozone. Further, Spanish revenues were only 36% of GDP in 2011, compared to the Eurozone average of 45% of GDP. The problem of revenues was a direct consequence of the housing crisis in Spain; many of the taxes collected in the period before the crisis were temporary taxes linked to the transfer of property. Additionally, as unemployment rose, Spanish income tax revenues decreased.\n\nTo combat the fiscal problems, Spain has gone through two distinct phases: an expansive phase from 2008-2009 and a consolidation phase from 2010 to the present day. Both phases came at the recommendation of the European Union, and have produced significant effects on the fiscal situation of Spain.\n\nDuring the expansive phase, Spain merely added to its budgetary problems. It instituted tax cuts totaling 1.8% of GDP in 2008 and 2009 and introduced liquidity support to households and companies that reduced revenues by an additional 1.2% of GDP. Further, the governments introduced a fund for local public investment and a fund to aid strategic sectors which added an additional 1.1% of GDP to expenditures. Due to these policies, Spain shifted from a budget surplus of 2% in 2007 to a deficit of 11% in 2009, and public debt increased from 36% to 54% of GDP from 2007 to 2009.\n\nThe consolidation phase came as the European Union realized the need for the periphery of Europe to shore up its accounts in order to raise public debt at affordable levels, and the EU placed austerity measures on Spain. The government instituted revenue measures with an expected positive impact of 3.9% of GDP by raising the value added tax rate from 21% to 18% and significant income-tax increases. Additionally, the government laid out expenditure measures with an expected reduction of 3.5% of GDP, most notably, cutting jobless benefits and public-sector wages by 7% and reducing departmental budgets by 17%.\n\nAnother important aspect of Spain's fiscal landscape is the presence of autonomous regions, roughly equivalent to states in the United States. The regions, through health care, education and social services, outlay 35% of total government expenditures in Spain, yet bring in only 19% of total revenues in taxes. The deficits are filled in by transfers from the central government, contributing to 56% of the deficit in 2009.\n\nCurrently, reforms are being made by the central government to ensure that the regions practice fiscal responsibility and to more properly allocate capital to regions to reflect the proper use of government resources. Additionally, Rajoy is implementing a system by which the central government can place austerity measures on the regions in exchange for financing, similar to Europe's treatment of Spanish finances. This would force regions to start raising personal-income taxes and decrease spending on public services. Specifically, the government is requiring that the regions aggregately raise revenue and decrease expenditures by \u20ac4 billion in both 2014 and 2015.\n\nLabor Market Reforms\n\nAs domestic demand in Spain decreased due to the housing crisis and subsequent employment crisis, Spain needed to become more competitive in the global market place. Most countries would use their central banks to lower interest rates and devalue their currencies, yet this option was not available to Spain because of its participation in the Eurozone. The other option to increase competitiveness globally was to decrease unit labor costs, which would in turn allow Spanish exporters to reduce their prices.\n\nSpain was renowned for its archaic labor laws, as companies found it difficult to fire employees, employees enjoyed early retirement with full pensions, powerful collective bargaining positions, and, most importantly, constant wage increases. While its GDP (-7%) and employment (from 9% to 20% unemployment) levels fell precipitously in the three years beginning in 2008, Spain's unit labor costs actually increased by an average of 1.7% a year. Spain began to address these issues with a labor reform in 2010, but it wasn't until February 10, 2012 with the Royal Decree Law 3/2012 , that Rajoy was able to enact a monumental labor reform.\n\nThe 2012 labor reform consisted of two main initiatives: reforming the collective bargaining aspect of Spanish labor and adjusting the employment protection legislation. The reforms attempted to hit the heart of the matter; Spain needed to reduce its labor costs and had to wrest power from its employees.\n\nThe first step was to give priority to collective bargaining agreements (CBA) at the firm level over those established at the sector or regional levels. This allowed for Spanish firms to become more competitive amongst each other, and made it easier to decrease wages without strikes. The new CBA reforms allowed for firms to opt out of an agreement and implement \"internal flexibility,\" meaning firms could introduce unilateral working condition changes for economic or productivity reasons. For example, Spanish firms were now able to change the wages and working hours of employees in order to increase profits, a practice that was unheard of before 2012. In addition, in the absence of an agreement of internal flexibility, an employer could refer the matter to a relatively speedy arbitration rather than go through a full review by labor courts, allowing changes to a company's workforce to go through more quickly without high costs for litigation.\n\nThe employment protection legislation, specifically relating to regulations on hiring and firing, was also made more business friendly. The definition of fair economic dismissal was reshaped to mean that dismissal is always justified if a company faces three quarters of decline in revenues or income. In other words, companies no longer had to prove that dismissals were essential for future profitability. The reforms also reduced monetary compensations for dismissal and eliminated the requirement of administrative authorization for collective redundancies. Traditionally in Spain, in order to lay-off a large amount of workers, companies had to obtain government approval, and government approval was sometimes denied if the company could not agree with the union board about the layoffs. Now that government approval was no longer necessary, companies could perform massive layoffs without consulting union boards. Finally, the law instituted \"contrato emprendedores,\" which allowed firms under 50 employees to have a one year trial period for full-time employees, attempting to spur hiring by entrepreneurs.\n\nThe new labor reforms modified a labor system that was strongly rooted in the 'uncertainty avoidance' of Spanish culture discussed in the introduction of this thesis, with many protections for workers. With a gloomy outlook on the future of domestic demand due to the high unemployment and debt levels, and the lack of ability to institute monetary policy, Spain saw labor reform as the best way to increase its global competitiveness.Continued on Next Page \u00bb"}]}
