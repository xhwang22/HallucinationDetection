At this competition, she competed on the uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise; winning the silver medal on the uneven bars with a score of 14.675, only behind world silver medalist on the event, Koko Tsurumi of Japan.\n\nCaquatto started her 2010 season by competing at the City of Jesolo Trophy, where she had the highest beam score but made mistakes on the floor which kept her from medaling in the all-around. Caquatto competed at the 2010 CoverGirl Classic and placed 3rd in the all-around, scoring the second highest on vault and the uneven bars but falling from the balance beam. She had qualified to compete at the 2010 US National Championships. At the 2010 US National Championships, Mackenzie placed 5th in the all-around. She fell on a simple change grip skill on the uneven bars, her best event, placing 4th.\n\nAfter the US Nationals, Mackenzie was selected to attend a selection camp for the 2010 World Championships. From there, she advanced to the second camp where she won the all-around competition. She was eventually selected to compete.\n\nAt the World Championships, Mackenzie competed in the all-around in the qualifying round. After hitting all her routines without major error, she placed 9th individually and 3rd with the team. Although the top 24 qualifiers advance to the individual all-around final, she was left out because fellow American athletes Aly Raisman and Rebecca Bross had qualified ahead of her and only two athletes from each country can qualify to a final.\n\nAfter the qualifying round, Mackenzie was selected to compete on the uneven bars and the vault during the team finals. She contributed a 14.666 on the bars and a 15.000 on the vault to help the team win the silver medal behind Russia and ahead of China.\n\nShe competed as a Florida gator at the NCAA level for the 2010\u20132011 season where she became injured but still competed the all-around for her team at the NCAA Championships. After finishing the NCAA season, Mackenzie decided to train for a comeback to elite gymnastics for the 2011 season.\n\nMackenzie began her 2011 elite season by competing at the CoverGirl Classic. At the classic, she competed a slightly watered down balance beam routine and a solid uneven bars routine; scoring 14.100 and 14.750, respectively.\n\nAt the 2011 US Visa National Championships, Mackenzie surprised many by competing in the all-around. On day 1 of the competition, Mackenzie was in second place after the two rotations; after scoring a 14.700 and 15.000 on vault and uneven bars, respectively. Unfortunately, she counted her first fall on the balance beam. After having a solid floor exercise, she finished her night in sixth place with an all-around score of 56.000. On the final day of competition, Mackenzie competed solidly on all her events. Taking advantage of injuries to defending national champion Rebecca Bross and Chellsie Memmel, Mackenzie went on to finish the championships in fourth place behind Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, and champion Jordyn Wieber. She also took second place on the uneven bars just behind Wieber by 0.050.\n\nMackenzie was given a spot on her fourth national team and has been invited to compete at the first world team selection camp. She was considered to be a likely pick for the world team, but injured her ankles when dismounting the beam at the selection camp and therefore lost her chance of going to Tokyo. After sitting out the beginning of the NCAA season, she competed on the uneven bars in early 2012 and is expected to reintroduce her beam routine soon.\n\nCompetition skills\n\nMackenzie performed the following skills on bars, beam, floor, and vault as of 2010.\n\nApparatus Skills D Score Top Score in World Championship/World Cup/Olympic Competition Vault Double-Twisting Yurchenko 5.8 15.000 Uneven Bars Jump to high bar mount, Kip cast to reverse grip handstand, Jaeger (D), Kip cast to handstand, toe on piked Tkatchev (E) to Pak Salto (D), Kip cast to handstand, Maloney (D) to Bail (D) to toe-on full pirouette (D) to toe-on shoot to high bar, Kip cast to handstand, Tkatchev (D), Kip cast to handstand, giant, full twisting double tuck dismount (D) 6.2 14.666 Balance Beam Leap on to beam mount, side sommie (D), front aerial (D) to flip flop (B) to layout step-out (C), full turn with leg at horizontal (C), split jump to sissone, switch split leap 1/2 (D) to back tuck (C)*, front pike take off from one foot (C), switch split leap (C) to back tuck (or pike) (C), roundoff to double pike dismount (E) 5.7 (5.8*) 14.266 Floor Exercise Roundoff back handspring to full-in double pike (E) (triple twisting back layout (E)*), roundoff back handspring to a triple twisting back layout (E) (roundoff to 1 1\u2044 2 back layout (C) to full twisting front layout (C)*), double turn with leg at horizontal (D), tour jete 1/2 (C), switch split ring leap (C) to switch split leap 1/2 (C), roundoff to 1 1\u2044 2 twisting back layout (C) to full twisting front layout (C) (front handspring to double twisting front layout (D)*), roundoff back handspring double pike dismount (D) 5.6 (5.5*) 13.533 (With slightly watered down exercise)\n\n*Variation competed for 2011.\n\nCompetitive history\n\nSenior career history\n\nYear Competition Description Location Apparatus Rank-Final Score-Final Rank-Qualifying Score-Qualifying 2011 CoverGirl Classic Chicago, IL Uneven Bars 4 14.750 Balance Beam 12 14.100 U.S. Championships Saint Paul, MN All-Around 4 112.500 6 56.000 Uneven bars 2 29.750 2 15.000 Balance Beam 12T 26.700 18 12.650 Floor Exercise 10 27.200 6T 13.650\n\nYear Competition Description Location Apparatus Rank-Final Score-Final Rank-Qualifying Score-Qualifying 2010 CoverGirl Classic Chicago, IL All Around 3 56.450 Vault 2 14.850 Uneven Bars 2 15.050 Balance Beam 20 12.950 Floor Exercise 8 13.600 U.S. Championships Hartford, CT All-Around 5T 113.350 5T 56.800 Uneven bars 2 28.900 4 15.000 Balance Beam 7T 27.550 9 13.500 Floor Exercise 8 27.700 10T 13.700 World Gymnastics Championships Rotterdam, The Netherlands Team All-Around 2 175.196 3 233.643 All-Around 9 57.198 Vault 15.000 (team finals) 6 14.933 (no average) Uneven Bars 14.666 (team finals) 12 14.466 Balance Beam 21 14.266 Floor Exercise 39 13.533\n\nYear Competition Description Location Apparatus Rank-Final Score-Final Rank-Qualifying Score-Qualifying 2009 CoverGirl Classic Des Moines, IA Uneven Bars 9 13.350 U.S. Championships Dallas, TX All-Around 5 111.950 5 56.000 Uneven bars 3 29.000 4 14.450 Balance Beam 17 26.000 15 13.000 Floor Exercise 10 27.350 9 13.850 Toyota International Toyota City, Japan Uneven bars 2 14.675 Balance Beam 12 12.275 Floor Exercise 11 12.100"}, {"url": "https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/mackenzie-caquatto.html", "page_content": "About\n\nElite artistic gymnast who has taken home the silver medal at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships as well as the Visa Championships.

I\u2019ve done a lot of homework on airplanes, and I\u2019ve had a lot of late-night study sessions \u2014 but I always get my work done.\u201d\n\nLast semester was particularly challenging for the aspiring special education teacher who helped lead the 2014 Gator gymnasts to their second straight national championship. While \u201cMacko,\u201d as her teammates called her, spent most of the fall semester teaching a fifth-grade class at Alachua Elementary School near Gainesville, she also attended four ProTeach classes and served as a student coach on the gymnastics team.\n\nShe also was a volunteer tutor for children with reading disabilities at a four-week summer camp last year, further demonstrating her resolve.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to be a teacher since I was 5 years old, so I\u2019ve been willing to do whatever it takes to get there,\u201d Caquatto said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t really feel like I\u2019m sacrificing anything because I love what I do.\u201d\n\nThe 5-foot-1 superstar from Naperville, Ill., expects to graduate with her M.Ed. degree in December and is thinking about ways to balance her considerable athletic talent with a teaching career.\n\n\u201cBeing a student coach has led me to think about coaching at the college level,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I also think about coaching younger athletes. I love working with kids of all ages, whether it\u2019s 6-year-olds or 20-year-olds.\u201d\n\nCaquatto said she recently experienced the vicarious thrills that come with coaching when she witnessed her younger sister, Bridgette, a junior All-American gymnast for the Gators, score a 9.95 to share the uneven bars title during a season opening win against Ball State. Bridgette also won the floor exercise title for the first time in her career with a 9.925.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been supportive of each other all our lives, and sometimes it\u2019s tough to watch each other compete,\u201d Mackenzie said. \u201cSometimes we just have to look the other way or hide behind someone, but I managed to watch \u2018Bridgey\u2019 nail two of her routines against Ball State. I couldn\u2019t have been any happier for her.\u201d\n\nCall it balanced reciprocity, but the bar on the uneven bars already had been set for Bridgette, who witnessed Mackenzie score a perfect 10 in that event last season \u2013 something only six others Gators have done.\n\nMackenzie said her sister was in tears after seeing the scoreboard.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll do the same thing when she gets a 10,\u201d big sister said.\n\nThe mutual support spills over into academics.\n\n\u201cI was always better at English and social studies, and Bridgey excelled in math and science,\u201d Mackenzie said. \u201cShe\u2019s always been very disciplined when it comes to studying and academics, so she makes a great study buddy during midterms and finals.\u201d\n\nMackenzie also says that being in the ProTeach program has prepared her for the \u201creal life\u201d experiences she expects to encounter in her teaching career.\n\n\u201cI remember the first time I presented lessons in front of 20 children,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was nerve-wracking, but not because it was difficult or I was scared of the kids. I just wondered if they\u2019d understand.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of a lesson is for all the students to understand the concept you\u2019re presenting, and you have to keep in mind the way each student learns and have a back-up plan if they don\u2019t understand. It feels like winning a competition when it works, but if it doesn\u2019t, well then it\u2019s kind of like going back to practice and fixing whatever went wrong and making it better.\n\n\u201cBut now that I\u2019ve got more experience creating lesson plans and using different teaching methods, I feel ready to handle my own classroom,\u201d Caquatto said with typical confidence. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m better prepared for becoming a winner in the classroom.\u201d\n\nChances are she\u2019ll score a perfect 10 there, too.\n\nContacts\n\nWriter: Stephen Kindland, College of Education Office of News and Communications; skindland@coe.ufl.edu; phone 352-273-3449."}, {"url": "https://happyhappybirthday.net/en/age/mackenzie-caquatto-person_guysxus", "page_content": "Mackenzie Caquatto\n\nAmerican gymnast \u2013 Mackenzie Caquatto was born in United States of America (country in North America) on March 26th, 1992 and is 31 years old today.\n\nAge How old is Mackenzie Caquatto? 31 Mackenzie Caquatto is 31 years old.\n\nBiographical data\n\nMackenzie Caquatto\n\nBirthday When was Mackenzie Caquatto born?
