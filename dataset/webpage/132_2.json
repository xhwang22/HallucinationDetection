He is perhaps best known for his advocacy of sexual freedom for all people, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.\n\nCarpenter was born in 1844 into a comfortable middle-class family in London and attended Brighton College. He showed enough academic potential to earn a place at the University of Cambridge\u2019s Trinity Hall, where he developed an interest in socialism \u2013 via the work of the Christian socialist theologian F. D. Maurice \u2013 and a growing awareness of his sexuality.\n\nHis path through academia led him to accept a fellowship at Trinity Hall, a position that required Carpenter to be ordained and adopt a clerical life at St. Edward\u2019s Church, Cambridge. It was a comfortable lifestyle, but Carpenter grew increasingly dissatisfied and, inspired by his discovery of Walt Whitman\u2019s poetry, which stirred a profound change in him, he left the clerical fellowship to \u201cgo and make my life with the mass of the people and the manual workers\u201d.\n\nCarpenter was repelled by the academic establishment and struck by a deep affinity with the plight of the working class. He felt strongly that his work should strive to affect social transformation.\n\nMillthorpe\n\nAfter several years lecturing in Northern communities as part of the University Extension Movement (which was formed by academics who wished to widen access to education in deprived communities), Carpenter inherited a significant sum from his father and bought a 7-acre smallholding at Millthorpe, in the countryside near Sheffield.\n\nHe built a large country house on the land and established Millthorpe as a home for friends and lovers to live a simple life together. Over time this notion of a \u201csimple life\u201d became central to Carpenter\u2019s philosophy, which preached the benefits of a communal back-to-the-land lifestyle.\n\nLife at MIllthorpe embraced manual work on the land, sandal-making and vegetarianism, but Carpenter also found time to write. One of his most famous works, Towards Democracy, was published in 1883, the same year he arrived at Millthorpe. The book expressed Carpenter\u2019s ideas about \u201cspiritual democracy\u201d in the form of a long poem.\n\nPostcard of Carpenter\u2019s house, Millthorpe, Derbyshire, late 19th century\n\nAlong with Whitman, Towards Democracy was influenced by the 700-verse Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita, and Carpenter became increasingly interested in Hindu thought in the year that followed. In 1890 he even travelled to Sri Lanka and India to spend time with the Hindu teacher called Gnani. He went on to incorporate aspects of eastern spiritualism into his socialist thinking.\n\nGay rights advocate\n\nCarpenter\u2019s ideas about sexuality began to develop during his time at Millthorpe. After decades of repression, he became increasingly comfortable expressing his attraction to men and lived in an openly gay relationship with George Merrill \u2013 a working-class man who grew up in the slums of Sheffield \u2013 for almost 40 years, until Merrill\u2019s death in 1928. Their relationship was the inspiration for E. M. Forster\u2019s novel Maurice, which depicts a cross-class gay relationship. Tellingly, Maurice, written by Forster between 1913 and 1914, was first published posthumously in 1971.\n\nCarpenter\u2019s newfound confidence was such that he began to write on the subject of homosexuality. Homogenic Love, a privately published pamphlet that was set to be included in a collection, Love\u2019s Coming-of-Age, until Oscar Wilde\u2019s indecency trials forced a rethink. The Intermediate Sex followed in 1908 and remains a courageous and thoughtful contemplation of homosexuality and gender fluidity.\n\nExploring the background to Section 28 and the long battle for its repeal. Listen Now\n\nAt a time when homosexuality was largely considered taboo, Carpenter spoke out against discrimination and advocated for equal rights. His work helped to lay the foundation for the modern gay rights movement.\n\nCarpenter believed that everyone should be free to love whoever they want, regardless of gender. His lucid writing and passionate advocacy undoubtedly helped to challenge negative stereotypes and open people\u2019s minds to the idea of love between two people of the same sex. Sadly, Carpenter\u2019s book was a long way from reflecting mainstream attitudes at the time of its publication.\n\nSocialist\n\nIn his early writings, Carpenter advocated for a form of socialism based on principles of Christianity and democracy. However, over time Carpenter\u2019s views evolved and he began to promote a more radical form of socialism that would lead to the abolition of private property and the state.\n\nKarl Marx, 1875 (left) / Oil painting of Edward Carpenter, 1894 (right)\n\nIn his 1889 treatise on socialism, Civilization: Its Cause and Cure, Carpenter argued that the root cause of societal ills is the economic system itself. He believed that capitalism breeds greed and selfishness, leading to war, poverty and injustice. Only by transitioning to a socialist system, in which the means of production are owned by the people, might humanity hope to achieve true equality and prosperity. Ultimately, while he was affiliated with the Labour movement, Carpenter\u2019s politics were more naturally aligned with anarchism than the economic principles that came to define the Labour Party.\n\nIn retrospect, Carpenter\u2019s brand of utopian socialism seems impressively progressive, but by the 1930s it was increasingly out of sync with the British Labour movement and easily mocked. In his 1937 book The Road to Wigan Pier, George Orwell pours scorn on \u201cevery fruit-juice drinker, nudist, sandal wearer and sex maniac\u201d in the Labour Party. It\u2019s more than likely that he had Edward Carpenter in mind.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why Orwell might have regarded Carpenter\u2019s \u2018spiritual socialism\u2019 as remote and faintly laughable but it\u2019s increasingly difficult to dismiss his concerns as crankish given that much of what he espoused anticipated the increasingly empowered green and animal rights politics of today. Carpenter argued that humans needed to relearn their place in the natural world, and that our treatment of animals was cruel and counterproductive. He also sounded a warning about the damaging impact of industrialisation on both human societies and the natural environment. More than a century later, some might say that it\u2019s hard to argue."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/John-Carpenter/6000000003409849329", "page_content": "About John \u201cJenkin\u201d, \u201cthe Younger\u201d Carpenter\n\nBiography\n\nFrom https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carpenter_(town_clerk)_\n\nJohn Carpenter, the younger (about 1372 \u2013 1442), was a Town Clerk of London. He was elected as Town Clerk to the City of London during the reigns of Henry V and Henry VI. He was the author of the first book of English common law, called Liber Albus (the White Book). He was a member of the English Parliament from London in 1425. He is also recognized as the founder of the City of London School for boys. He resided in the Parish of St. Peter, Cornhill, London, and was buried in the Abbey of St. Peter, Westminster, where his wife Katherine was later interred.\n\nStatue of John Carpenter (1372-1442) which stands in a prominent position on a plinth high up on the wall of the City of London School's glassed ceiling atrium standing over the door to the balcony of the Great Hall. In this position 'He' also 'sees' the full splendour of St. Paul's Cathedral Dome.\n\n\n\nHe is frequently distinguished in historical documents as \"John Carpenter, the younger,\" \"John Carpenter, Junior,\" and as \"John Carpenter, Jenkin.\" Jenkin or Jenken is a diminutive of the name John.[3]\n\nJohn Carpenter was one of three historical John Carpenters who were prominent during the 1400s. Both are mentioned in John Carpenter's 1442 will. One was his brother, John Carpenter, the elder, who received much property from his younger brother.[4]\n\nJohn Carpenter was the uncle to the other John Carpenter who was the Warden of St. Anthony's Hospital, Rector of St. Mary Magdalen's and finally known as the Bishop of Worcester. Bishop John Carpenter was willed, by the subject of this article, \"that book on architecture which Master William Cleve gave me.\" Cleve was King's Chaplain and clerk of the works, and carried out building at the Palace of Westminster and the Tower.[5]\n\n[edit] Early life & ancestry\n\nThomas Brewer in his 1856 book on John Carpenter found no significant record of his life until his election as the Town Clerk or Common Clerk of the City of London on April 20, 1417, at about age 45. The exemption mentioned on page 14 suggests that John Carpenter had been in the City of London's service \"from the time of his youth.\" It is assumed that he was apprenticed to John Marchaunt, his predecessor as Town Clerk.[6] Based on Liber Albus (see below) and other works, he was familiar with the law.\n\nGenealogical efforts have revealed a baptized or christened date of 18 Dec 1378 Hereford Cathedral, Hereford, England, but he was probably born earlier with about 1372 being generally accepted. His father is listed as Richard Carpenter and his mother as Christina.[7]\n\nHis father, Richard or Renaud Carpenter, is believed to have been born about 1335/1337 in or of, Grand Pont, Cambrai, Nord, France. He may have been alive as late as 1412 in London. He married Christina, last name unknown, who was of London. Their known children:\n\nJohn Carpenter, the elder, born circa 1362. The father of John Carpenter (bishop). His baptism or christening date of 20 Sept 1371 in Battlesden has not been confirmed and is probably wrong. His death date not known.\n\nRobert Carpenter, born circa 1368, of London. In his brother's will - it indicates that he had a son (named) Richard and two daughters (named) Joan and Katherine. John Carpenter, the younger - the subject of this article. His grandfather, John or Jean Le Carpenter or Carpentier, born about 1303 of Le Grand Pont, Du Nord, France and died after 1345 in Dilwyne, Herefordshire, England. He married Jeanne Tabarie, who was born circa 1310 near Cambrai, Nord, France. His parents are disputed and are not listed in this article.\n\n[edit] Marriage The date of John Carpenter's marriage has not been found, nor has the maiden name of his wife, Katherine.\n\nKatherine was born in or of \"Zeeland\" (now the Netherlands) about 1372. Her will was written 31 Mar 1457 and proved in June 1458. She was later buried with her husband in the Abbey of St. Peter, Westminster, Middlesex, England. They had no children.[8]\n\n[edit] Political life John Carpenter was elected the Town Clerk or Common Clerk of the City of London on April 20, 1417. This was two years after the Battle of Agincourt. [9][10]\n\n\"Procla macio sup' judicio billor'\" - This proclamation appears to be the first instance of John Carpenter, the Town Clerk of London signing a public document with his surname only.[11]\n\nHe obtained a letter of patent from Henry VI dated 3 Dec. 18 (1418?), exempting him \"for the whole of his life from all military and civil duties whatsoever, which included election as a member of Parliament and receiving the Honour of Knighthood.\"[12] What service he rendered the Crown is unknown, but it can be assumed he provided a great service.\n\nJohn Carpenter was a member of the English Parliament from London in 1425.[13]\n\n[edit] Coat of arms John Carpenter's Arms appear to be of French or Norman heritage, \"Paly of six, argent and gules, on a chevron azure, 3 cross crosslets or.\" These Arms are often referred to as the Hereford Arms, named for the later ancestral home of the Carpenter Family in Hereford, England. The Crest, supporters & motto apparently has changed several times over the centuries. A more current motto is: \"Per acuta belli\". [14] These later became known as the Hereford Arms.\n\nSample of a medieval knight with an early Carpenter Coat of Arms on shield. The Hereford Arms were granted in 1719 to George, Lord Carpenter (1657-1732). He was a Lt. General and commander-in-chief of all the Crown's forces in Scotland where he was elevated to the peerage of Ireland, by patent dated 29 May 1719, as Baron Carpenter, of Killaghy, county Kilkenny, Ireland.[15][16] Please be aware that there is no direct male to male Carpenter descent connecting Lord Carpenter & Sir William Boyd Carpenter. The family connection is by marriage through the females in the family.\n\nSir William Boyd Carpenter (1841 - 1918), an English clergyman of the Established church of England, Bishop of Ripon, afterwards a Canon of Westminster and Chaplain to the reigning sovereign of England, wrote in a letter dated 7 August 1907 that his family bore the Hereford Arms. Sir Noel Paton, upon painting the Family Arms, informed him that the supporters were originally a round-handled sword, which in drawing over time became shortened, until nothing but the cross and globe were left beneath it. Those Hereford Arms were used by \"John Carpenter, town clerk of London, who died 1442 A. D.\"[17] His grandson John Boyd-Carpenter, Baron Boyd-Carpenter (1908-1998), continued the Arms into the new century by passing it down to his son, Thomas Boyd-Carpenter, who was himself knighted after a military career as a Lieutenant-General and in public service.\n\nNOTE: The Hereford Coat of Arms described above should not be confused with the Arms of Bishop Richard Carpenter (c1450s?-1503) presented in the \"Visitations of the County of Oxford taken in 1566, 1574, and 1634, published in 1871, which describe the arms displayed in the buildings at the University in Oxford - \"In the Lyberarye of Baliall College.\" - as recorded by the officials performing the visitations in those years. The Visitations describe the arms of Richard Carpenter (theologian) as: \"Paly of nine Gu. and Az. on a chevron Arg. surmounted by a mitre Or, three cross crosslets of -- nine pales alternating red and blue, with a silver chevron bearing three gold cross-crosslets. [18]\n\n[edit] Liber Albus John Carpenter was the author of first book of English Common Law called \"Liber Albus\" (\"White Book\"), completed in 1419. It was one of the first common law books in England that provided a basis of legal, social and history of the law relating to the City of London. The statue of John Carpenter, now residing within the City of London School for Boys, shows him holding this book. [19]\n\nThe following lines[20] were hand written (probably in the 1500s) on the fly-leaf of \"Liber Albus\" translated from Latin:\n\nThe book that once was white is white no more; Made black with grease, and thumb'd its page o'er. Then, while it still exists, transcribe each page; Once gone, 'tis lost to every future age. And if so lost---some fault of ours, 'tis true-- Ah me! thou gem of greatest price, Adieu! [edit] Latter life At one point, John Carpenter reportedly owned over 300 tenements. He had a fish pond, doubling as a reservoir, on top of his own house. Most of these properties he later willed to his brother.[21] He resided in the Parish of St. Peter, Cornhill, London, England.\n\nJohn Carpenter's will was made in his 70th year, dated 8 March 1441 and proved 12 May 1442. This indicates he was born about 1372 and that his death may have been some time in April of 1442. He was buried in the Abby of St. Peter, London, Middlesex, England.[22]\n\nBequest for the betterment of poor children: John Stow[23] recorded the actual bequest as, \"He gave tenements to the Citye for the finding and bringing up of foure poore men's children with meate, drinke, apparell, learning at the schooles in the universities, &c., until they be preferred, and then others in their place for ever.\"[24]\n\nBy leaving property to the City of London, later known as the Corporation of London, this provided \"Carpenter's Children\" (as they became known) to assist at divine service in the choir of the [Guildhall] chapel on festival days. That continued for almost 400 years until an Act of Parliament (1834) permitted the combining of several accounts to establish the City of London School. Since 1986, the school has resided on the east end of John Carpenter Street and Queen Victoria Street.[25]\n\nJohn The Senior11 Carpenter, son of Richard, was born Abt. 1361 in London, Middlesex, England.\n\nChildren of John The Senior Carpenter are:\n\ni.

He was educated at the University of Mississippi where he gained a Master's degree before becoming a Methodist minister. He entered Harvard as a doctoral student in English in 1920 and there became a student of George Lyman Kittredge, an eminent literary and folklore scholar. Under Kittredge's supervision, Carpenter worked on a PhD thesis entitled 'Forecastle Songs and Chanties', drawing on fieldwork undertaken in Britain, Ireland and America.\n\nHaving gained his doctorate in 1929, Carpenter was awarded a Sheldon Fellowship from Harvard to continue collecting folksongs in Britain. He bought a car and began to travel England, Scotland and Wales in search of singers. Among the people he encountered were some who had sung for the Edwardian folksong collectors, such as Cecil Sharp and Gavin Greig, and some who would be visited by later collectors, such as Hamish Henderson and Kenneth Goldstein. He also located prolific singers never recorded before or since, such as Bell Duncan, an 80-year-old woman from Aberdeenshire, Scotland, whom he described as 'the greatest ballad singer of all time'. Her repertoire, according to Carpenter, consisted of some 300 songs, including 65 of the classic ('Child') ballads.\n\nCarpenter's collecting method for songs was in many cases to record several stanzas of a singer's rendition using the Dictaphone cylinder machine. He then asked the singer to start again and dictate the words of the song, two lines at a time, while he typed them up on a portable typewriter.\n\nBy 1933, Carpenter had broadened the scope of his collecting to include mummers' plays as well as traditional songs. A few of these are recorded on cylinder, but many were apparently dictated to Carpenter, mostly by ex-performers.\n\nCarpenter returned to Harvard in 1935 where he gave occasional lectures and set about transcribing the tunes of the ballads he had collected, a task in which he was self-taught. His aim was to publish the ballad material. He continued to work on the ballads in his collection following a move in 1938 to Duke University, where he took up a part-time position in the English Department, then chaired by the eminent North Carolina folklorist Frank C. Brown. The publication never materialised, however, and only a handful of items from his collection were ever published, despite his plans. During his time at Duke, Carpenter also continued to collect and encouraged his students to do so too.\n\nCarpenter left Duke in 1943 and took up further posts in Virginia and finally as Head of the English Department at Greensboro College, North Carolina, where he stayed until his retirement in 1954. He returned to Booneville in 1964 where he began writing popular songs. In 1972, he sold his collection to the Library of Congress. He died in 1983.\n\nFor more information on Carpenter, see Julia C. Bishop, '\"Dr Carpenter from the Harvard College in America\": An Introduction to the James Madison Carpenter and his Folklore Collection', Folk Music Journal 7.4 (1998): 402-20."}, {"url": "https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol2/pp139-141", "page_content": "CABINET-MAKING AND WOOD-CARVING\n\nHorace Walpole mentions among the artists in woodwork of the Tudor period Lawrence Truber, a carver, and Humphrey Cooke, master carpenter of the new buildings at the Savoy. (fn. 1) Another workman in this art is met with in the reign of Henry VIII, one William Grene the king's coffer maker, (fn. 2) who received \u00a36 18s. 'for making of a coffer covered with fustyan of Naples, and being full of drawers and boxes lined with red and grene sarcynet to put in stones of divers sorts'. There is ample evidence that many foreign woodcarvers and cabinet-makers were working in London in the 16th century. In 1540 foreign joiners (fn. 3) are found in East Smithfield. Ten years later the roll of the Dutch Church (fn. 4) records a large number of Flemish 'schrynmakers' and 'kistmakers' living in the City, Southwark, and St. Giles. In 1567 in the Ward of Bridge Without (fn. 5) alone there were at least twenty-four foreign joiners and carpenters, and many later instances might be cited. Indeed in 1582-3 so serious had become the competition of the strangers that the Joiners' Company returned a list of 100 foreigners exercising this craft, and declared (fn. 6) :\n\nThe Master and Wardens of the Companye of Joyners never licensed nor admitted any of the persons hereunder expressed to use their said trade, yett they, dwelling somme in Westminster, somme in Sainct Katherins, and somme in Sowthworke, do use the sayd occupacion, and have joyned themselves togeather and have sued the joyners these tenne yeres in the lawe and procured to be spent above \u00a3400 only to thend to worck in London as fullye as a freeman may doe, to the utter undoing of a great number of freemen joyners, mere Englishemen, who are all sowayes [sic] ready for any service for her Majestie, this Realme and Citie of London.\n\nThe greatest master of the school of English wood-carving was Grinling Gibbons, who flourished in the latter part of the 17th and in the early 18th century. He was of English parentage but born in Holland, and was brought by Evelyn under the notice of Charles II, who gave him an appointment in the Board of Works. He afterwards lived in Belle Sauvage Court, Ludgate Hill. Here he carved so delicately a pot of flowers for his window sill, that the leaves shook with the vibration caused by the coaches as they rumbled through the yard. His finest work is at Petworth House, Sussex, but the choir stalls at St. Paul's Cathedral afford an excellent example of his style. He died on 3 August 1721 at his house in Bow Street, Covent Garden. His followers built up a school of architectural carvers whose beautiful work abounds in old London buildings, such as the court-room at Stationers' Hall, the vestry of the church of St. Lawrence Jewry, &c., the traditions of which continued down to the last century.\n\nWith the reign of William and Mary marquetry furniture became the fashion in the form of bandy-legged chairs, secr\u00e9taires or bureaux, long clock-cases, &c., that afforded surfaces available for such decoration. This art had not previously been practised in England, specimens being procured by importation chiefly from Italy. The leaves and other figures composing the pattern were cut out of dyed woods, shading being given by means of hot sand. (fn. 7) George Ethrington was a London maker of this work about the year 1665. (fn. 8) Many London cabinet-makers subsequently engaged in this manufacture, and a national style was developed. Another style of decoration known as Boule (from its inventor Andr\u00e9 Charles Boule, born in 1642) shared with marquetry the favour of the public. This was a kind of veneered work usually composed of tortoiseshell and thin brass. Sir William Chambers, the celebrated architect (1725-96), published a book of designs of Chinese furniture, dresses, &c., in 1757, and largely employed the best artists in wood-carving for the decoration of his interiors. John Wilton, one of his prot\u00e8g\u00e8s, was born in London in 1722, and studied abroad for many years, returning to England in 1757 with Sir William Chambers. He was employed in designing carriage and furniture decorations, and painted the royal state coach now in use. John Baptist Cipriani and Angelica Kauffman, painters of the same period, did much decorative work for Chambers, Adam, Chippendale, and other furniture designers; Cipriani decorated Carlton House.\n\nThomas Chippendale, the son and father of furniture makers, exercised the same trade in London in the latter half of the 18th century. He published in 1758-9 a book of designs of furniture of every kind. (fn. 9) He used mahogany as a material instead of oak, and brought that wood into general use. His designs are distinguished for their fine architectural mouldings, and his workmanship is admirable. In his gilt-work he is specially celebrated for his frames, which are in the French style, and cut with great freedom and delicacy. He also designed Chinese scenes in his gilt-work, following the taste introduced by Sir William Chambers. Another of his published works was intituled The Gentleman and Cabinet-maker's Director, a collection of designs of household furniture; of this a third edition appeared in 1762.\n\nMatthew Lock, a London carver and gilder, with whom was associated a cabinetmaker named H. Copeland, published a book of furniture designs, undated, but probably of the year 1743. (fn. 10) At the exhibition of 1862 a collection of his original drawings and those of Chippendale was shown. The accompanying notes gave the names of his workmen, their wages, &c., in 1743, from which it appears that 5s. a day was the sum earned by a wood-carver at that time. Lock belonged to and left behind him a talented school of wood-carvers.\n\nThe brothers Robert and James Adam are known to fame chiefly as architects who greatly improved street architecture in London, and as architects to King George III. Having obtained from the Duke of St. Albans' estate a lease for 100 years of Durham Yard, they built the terrace known as the Adelphi on ground largely reclaimed from the Thames. Robert and James Adam rank also as the most important designers of furniture of their day, adapting a suitable and harmonious system of decoration to the houses which they built. An explanation of the general principles which they adopted is afforded by the published plates of Derby House, Grosvenor Square, now destroyed. The brothers Adam designed fireplaces, steel grate fronts, sideboards, and other articles of furniture, which are much sought after at the present day by those who follow the prevailing fancy for antique furniture. Robert Adam published, in 1773, a volume of illustrations of the buildings, room decoration, furniture, &c., designed by him, which was reprinted in 1823. A. Heppelwhite, a cabinet-maker of this period, trading with his assistants as Heppelwhite & Co., published in 1789 a complete set of designs for all sorts of reception-room and bedroom furniture. These mahogany chairs, library tables, desks and bureaux, continued in fashion during the early years of the next century, as did also the lighter objects in satinwood painted with various decorations.\n\nThe work of Thomas Sheraton, another cabinet-maker, is still in high repute for its admirable workmanship, which unites lightness and strength. The specimens of his work seem to resist the ravages of time, being made of wood well-seasoned and admirably put together. Sheraton was the author of a complete dictionary of his trade, (fn. 11) and of a Cabinetmaker's Drawing-book. (fn. 12)\n\nThroughout the 18th century the work of upholsterers in England was much influenced by the designs of the brothers Adam, Chippendale, Sheraton, and Pergolesi. They evince regard for general utility and comfort, combined with skill and delicacy in design and sound workmanship.\n\nMr. J. Hungerford Pollen, in his Ancient and Modern Furniture in the South Kensington Museum, (fn. 13) says: 'Only the most meagre notices are to be found of the artists to whom we owe the designs of modern furniture . . . of the furniture makers who attained such eminence during the last [18th] century very little is known.' A principal reason for this is to be found in the fact that for a hundred and fifty years after the Renaissance furniture design was so closely associated with architecture that it almost ceased to exist as a separate art. The woodwork of rooms and the character of their furniture followed the style of architecture employed for the building; the ornamental chimney-pieces, &c., were mostly designed by the architects themselves, and fashioned by excellent artist workmen of whom no record has been preserved.\n\nINDUSTRIES\n\nDuring the last century inspiration was obtained from many eminent artists, of whom it is unnecessary to mention more than A. W. Pugin, H. Shaw, Owen Jones, William Morris, William Burges, and C. L. Eastlake. Among the firms which have honestly endeavoured to lead and improve public taste in furniture and have gained a high reputation for the quality of their work are Gillow's, Jeffrey, Jackson & Graham, Crace, Shoolbred, and Trollope & Sons. The list might be considerably increased.\n\nWith regard to the system of production, valuable information is afforded in Charles Booth's Life and Labour of the People in London. (fn. 14) The districts comprise Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, Hackney, and the Tower Hamlets. The Curtain Road district in Shoreditch is the chief market of the trade and the centre of its distribution. 'From the East-end workshops,' says Mr. Booth, 'produce goes out of every description, from the richly inlaid cabinet that may be sold for \u00a3100 or the carved chair that can be made to pass as rare \"antique\" workmanship, down to the gypsy tables that the maker sells for 9s. a dozen or the cheap bedroom suites and duchesse tables that are now flooding the market.' (fn. 15)\n\nThe producers fall into four main groups. The first class, that of the factories, forms but an insignificant portion of the trade, there being not more than three or four large factories with elaborate machinery, where from about 50 to 190 men are employed. They supply the large dealers in the Tottenham Court Road, in the provinces, or in the colonies. The second class, that of the larger workshops, comprises shops in which from 15 to 25 men are generally employed. Here the best East-end furniture is made, but the number of first-class shops is very small, many good firms having been obliged to give up altogether in recent years through the prevailing demand for cheapness. In the third class are the small makers, masters who employ from 4 to 8 men in small workshops, either built behind the house or away from it, sometimes even in the houses themselves. 'As a general rule the larger shops turn out the better work. But even among the small men excellent work is done, in the same way that large shops often turn out cheap and inferior goods.' (fn. 16) These small men sell at the nearest market, that is, the Curtain Road and its district; here they can be sure of getting cash, whilst the West-end shops and the provincial trade take credit, which the small maker can rarely afford to give. In a fourth class are the independent workers. These are mostly found among the turners, carvers, fret-cutters, and sawyers, and are not a large class. Other special classes described by Mr. Booth are chair makers, looking-glass frame makers, carvers, french polishers, and upholsterers."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/27/sports/27iht-obit.html", "page_content": "LONDON \u2014 Harry Carpenter, a popular sportscaster for the BBC who was hailed as the voice of boxing in Britain and who announced some of the sport\u2019s biggest fights, died on March 20 in London.

Much can be learnt about these boys from the letters they wrote to Marcus Ware, a leading light of this philanthropic organization, and from the journals that Ware himself wrote over a number of years.

His name was Peter Carpenter, and, although he was a boy from the streets of the capital, he found himself embroiled in an extraordinary adventure that took him a very long way from home.\n\nCUT ADRIFT\n\nPeter Carpenter was born in Bloomsbury early in 1840, the son of Michael\u2014a gas pipe layer\u2014and Ann. At the time of Peter\u2019s birth Michael was nearing thirty. He was from Ireland, whereas Ann, who was two years younger, was a Londoner. In 1840 the family were living on the Foundling Hospital Estate at 21 Compton Place, a squalid yard occupied by poor Irish immigrants, and blighted by outbreaks of antisocial behaviour. The census taken in 1841, that is to say in the year after Peter\u2019s birth, provides a stark picture of a cramped residence divided into nine rooms occupied by fourteen individuals.\n\nOne cannot imagine that Peter\u2019s was anything other than a troubled childhood. When he was only eight his father died of typhoid fever. Later a little sister fell ill, and he was at her bedside in the Hospital for Sick Children in Great Ormand Street when she finally slipped away. He was thirteen, and she, Mary Ann, was nine. By the time he was sixteen his mother was dead, too, although the circumstances of her death are not known.\n\nNow an orphan, Peter was all but cut adrift. But he attended the ragged school which, appropriately, had been established in Compton Place in 1847, but had now moved to Brunswick Street. And there we catch glimpses of him, an occasional figure in the pages of Ware\u2019s journal. \u201cPeter came tonight\u201d\u2014a Sunday late in 1855\u2014\u201csaying that he had no home and nothing to do.\u201d He asked Ware if he might be given a roof over his head, and Ware, evidently moved by his predicament, promised to try him out in the Shoeblack Society.\n\nNot that Ware was uncritical. A devout Christian, he had been disturbed some time ago that Peter had been frequenting Manning\u2019s, a coffee house in Maiden Lane. \u201cThis is a low place,\u201d he wrote in his journal. Peter, who at the time was barely twelve years old, was working for one of the cat\u2019s-meat men who took boiled horseflesh from the knackers\u2019 yard on Cow Cross Street round the houses, selling it, according to Henry Mayhew in London Labour and the London Poor, for tuppence ha\u2019penny a pound. But in December 1855, when he was approaching the age of sixteen, he went out to work as a shoeblack.\n\nAt the time he was living with his grandmother, Catherine Maley, in Chapel Grove in Somers Town. Quite possibly their relationship was not a harmonious one, for at some point in December 1855 or January 1856 Peter went to live with a family named Callaghan in Seven Dials, who had once had a connection with his father. But towards the end of January everything changed. And the person responsible for that change was a woman by the name of Louisa Jane Troubridge.\n\nTO THE BALTIC AND BACK\n\nLouisa Jane Gurney, the daughter of an established Norfolk family, had married Sir Thomas Troubridge in the autumn of 1855. Troubridge was an officer in the 7th Royal Fusiliers, in which capacity he fought in the Crimean War. He was exceptionally courageous. At the Battle of Inkerman in 1854, in spite of losing his right leg and left foot, he stayed at his post, propped up against a gun carriage.\n\nTroubridge also had navy connections\u2014both his father and his maternal grandfather had been admirals\u2014which may explain the part Louisa Jane now played in the life of Peter Carpenter. For late in January she applied to the Shoeblack Society for three boys to be sent down to Portsmouth to be enrolled as naval apprentices. We need not be too surprised at the interest she took in these impoverished young Londoners, for she had charitable instincts, and we find her again as a patron of the Institution for the Employment of Needlewomen, an organization which was praised in Charles Dickens\u2019s All the Year Round, and which with the battle-cry \u201ca fair wage for a fair day\u2019s work\u201d aimed to provide an alternative to the workhouse.\n\nMore to the point, she visited the Lambeth Ragged School in 1846, as did Dickens, and two rather charming images of lessons in full swing appeared in The Illustrated London News. The schoolmistresses in the girls\u2019 classroom show a tender concern for their young charges\u2014who are, indeed, dressed in very ragged clothes\u2014while some of their male colleagues appear to be dealing with the boys pretty strictly. One can see why Louisa was moved to do something for children like these.\n\nOn the 31st of January the three boys\u2014Peter from Brunswick Street, the other two from St Anne\u2019s Lane in Westminster\u2014went down to Portsmouth. They were accompanied by John Richard Fowler, who, like Ware, was a barrister, and was Louisa Jane Troubridge\u2019s contact at the school. Ware paid Peter\u2019s fare. He gave him money\u2014a pound for his outfit, two shillings tenpence pocket money, a bit extra to top up his savings account\u2014and copies of the New Testament and The Pilgrim\u2019s Progress. Fowler travelled down on the train with the three boys, and left them on board a now decrepit HMS Victory, where they were enrolled. He then returned home, alone.\n\nPeter was sent on board HMS Harrier, and found himself in the Baltic Sea at the tail end of the Crimean War. In fact the peace negotiations were under way in Paris at just the time he sailed north\u2014in February\u2014and had been concluded by the time he sent his first letter to Ware at the end of April. One might well think that he had had a narrow escape. Interestingly, though, it was not the threat of hostilities that preoccupied him so much as the very real discomfort of freezing northern temperatures. \u201cWe suffered a great deal from the cold,\u201d he confided in the letter. At one point the Harrier had been frozen in off the coast of Sweden, an experience that must have left Peter, who was only turning sixteen, feeling very far from home.\n\nBut the Harrier was not in the Baltic for long, and it was back in Portsmouth by the end of April. And there the boy from the slums of Bloomsbury found himself caught up in an event of quite remarkable magnificence. This was the Grand Naval Review of 1856, a public celebration to mark the return of the Baltic Fleet, and an unparalleled opportunity for the illustrated press to show just what it was capable of.\n\nTHE GREATEST NUMBER OF SHIPS\n\nNo-one in those days did it better than The Illustrated London News. On the Saturday after the review, which took place on Wednesday the 23rd of April, a supplement was published in which every aspect of the occasion was reported in detail. The many illustrations included images of vessels and their crews and a plan of Spithead\u2014the water between Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight\u2014showing all the ships and their manoeuvres.\n\nThe reporters for the News rose to the occasion with unabashed lyricism, describing the feverish preparations in Portsmouth, the arrival of the crowds, the excitement and the anticipation. The day of the review\n\nbroke in the brightest and most auspicious manner. It was a cold, grey, silvery dawn that threw every part of the vast scene into a misty tone, increasing the distance of distant objects, and causing the Isle of Wight to assume a pale and dim aspect.\n\nThe arrival of Queen Victoria in the royal yacht called for prose equally purple. The mist lifted, and as the monarch floated past the crowds\n\nthousands of voices cheered and hurraed, bands of music threw out tones that grew mellow as they stole along the waters, and the attendant shipping and spectators joined in the pleasing demonstration.\n\nHowever, nothing that the newspapers published compares with Peter\u2019s own observations in his letter to Ware. Although written awkwardly, and clumsily, they are shot through with unaffected and wide-eyed wonder. The ships\n\ncame down in three lines with the Queen at their head on board the Royal Yacht Victoria and Albert and the ships being all dressed with flags added a deal to the beauty of the scene, at night at nine o\u2019clock the ships were all illuminated with Blue lights which lasted for about 5 minutes and after they were out all and every one of the ships sent up rockets which they kept doing for about 2 hours when all again was quiet and there ended the review of the greatest number of ships that were ever before assembled in the world.\n\nAFTER THE FIREWORKS\n\nBut just as the rockets, fired from the ships, sparkled only briefly in the night sky, so Peter soon faded from sight. When he wrote to Ware in May 1857 he was still on the Harrier, stationed off the coast of South America. The last of his three letters, which was written in January 1858, was sent from Rio de Janeiro.\n\nHe worried a great deal about his other sister, Emma, who was then about ten or eleven. Following the death of their parents she had moved around, from their stepfather to their older brother, whose name was John, and then to their grandmother, Catherine Maley, in Somers Town. After that she was sent to the workhouse school in Forest Gate in East London. Quite possibly she was sent there for her own protection, for in his 1858 letter Peter referred to the worrying news, relayed to him by John, that \u201cmy Grandmother as ben behaving bad to my little sister\u201d.\n\nBut what became of Peter after the ink had dried on the last of his three letter to Martin Ware is a mystery. He cannot be traced with certainty in the censuses, and there is no death certificate that can be convincingly shown to be his. One might guess that he emigrated, for as a young seaman he had already seen the wider world, and there was little to keep him in England. Indeed, in the passenger lists for 1869 a Peter Carpenter boarded a ship at Liverpool, bound for Quebec. He was nineteen, which is exactly the age our Peter would have been. Maybe, then, we have found him, at the very point at which he set off on another adventure. A much bigger adventure. And, one hopes, a successful and a happy one.\n\n\u00a9 london-overlooked 2020\n\nOTHER STORIES ON OUR WEBSITE YOU MIGHT ENJOY"}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/John-Carpenter/6000000077915035793", "page_content": "About John \u201cthe Elder\u201d Carpenter\n\nFrom http://rhead-burtonconnections.com/carpenter%20ancestors.html\n\nJOHN CARPENTER (RICHARD CARPENTER2) was born in London, Middlesex, England ?? and died about 1476 ??\n\nChild of JOHN CARPENTER is:\n\nJOHN CARPENTER, JR., b. 1410, Homme, Herefordshire, England; d. 1476\n\nNotes\n\nFrom https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carpenter_(bishop)_\n\nCarpenter's father was John Carpenter the elder, born around 1362 to Richard or Renaud Carpenter of Cambrai and his wife Christina of London.

SCHOOL. A celebrated school in St. Paul's Churchyard, (on the east side), founded in 1512, for 153 poor men's children, by Dr. John Colet, Dean of St. Paul's, the friend of Erasmus, and son of Sir Henry Colet, tnereer, and Mayor of London in 1486 and 1495. The boys were to be taught, free of expense, by a master, sur-tnaster, and chaplain, and the oversight of the school was committed by the founder to the Mercers' Company. The number (153) was chosen in allusion to the number of fishes taken by St. Peter. The school was dedicated by Colet to the Child Jesus, but the saint, as Strype remarks, has robbed his master of his title. The lands left by Colet to support his school were estimated by Stow, in 1598, at the yearly value of one hundred and twenty pounds and better. Their present value is upwards of 5000l. The education is entirely classical, and the presentations to the school are in the gift of the Master of the Mercers' Company for the time being. Scholars are admitted at the age of fifteen, but at present none are eligible to an exhibition if entered after twelve; and none are expected to remain in the school after their nineteenth birthday, though no time for superannuation is fixed by the statutes. The head-master's salary is 618l. per annum ; the sur-master's, 307l. ; the under-master's, 272l. ; and the assistant-master's, 257l. Lilly, the grammarian, and friend of Erasmus, was the first master, and the grammar which he compiled, Lilly's Grammar, is still used in the school.

W. Elliston, the actor. Strype has left a very interesting account of this school in his annotations upon Stow. The present school was built in 1823, from a design by Mr. George Smith, and is the third building erected on the same site. Colet's school was destroyed in the Great Fire, \"but built up again, says Strype, \"much after the same manner and proportion it was before.\" Of the second school there are several views of the first, I am not aware that any representation exists.\n\nPeter Cunningham, Hand-Book of London, 1850\n\n[ ... back to main menu for this book]\n\nSt. Paul\u2019s School (Founded 1512 by John Colet, DD., Dean of St. Paul\u2019s), St. Paul\u2019s-churchyard\u2014There are 153 scholars on the foundation, who are entitled to entire exemption from school fees.

The son of a former naval commander with a lucrative career as a barrister and investor, Carpenter's early life followed the course prescribed by his privileged station, and he was educated at Oxford and Cambridge, where in 1868 he began a career as a lecturer at Trinity Hall.\n\nDuring his second year at Trinity, he was elected a clerical fellow and ordained a deacon. Carpenter's family had raised him in the relatively liberal doctrines of the Broad Church, and he soon found himself in conflict with the tenets of Anglicanism that he was expected to uphold. By 1871 this conflict had led to physical debilitation, and after a brief leave of absence, he resigned his church roles and functioned solely as a lecturer.\n\nWith church responsibilities behind him, Carpenter devoted himself to a relatively new program, the University Extension Program. The program was started by James Stuart (1843\u20131913) of Cambridge in response to pressures from women demanding access to education. Stuart saw it as a chance to forge an educational institution that would give equal access regardless of class or gender, and his democratic vision attracted Carpenter. By 1877 Carpenter was a key player within the extension program.\n\nFollowing the death of his parents in 1880 and 1881, Carpenter resigned his teaching duties and devoted himself to full-time study at Millthorpe, a retreat he bought in the Sheffield countryside. He began what was to become a key part of his theoretical vision, a systematic study of eastern religions and particularly of the Bhagavad-Gita. He also completed his epic poem cycle, Towards Democracy (1883), which was strongly influenced by the American poet Walt Whitman (1819\u20131892).\n\nThrough his involvement with such groups as the Progressive Association, the Fellowship of the New Life, the Fabians, and the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), he met important political and social theorists such as William Morris, Havelock Ellis, and Olive Schreiner, one of the leading socialist feminists of the time.\n\nIn 1884 William Morris broke alliance with the SDF and formed the Socialist League, and Carpenter followed suit. The development was crucial for Carpenter, for the League viewed the task of socialism to be the creation of a new inner consciousness for all people. This mingling of politics and spirituality enabled Carpenter to synthesize his own religious past, his current embrace of eastern mysticism, and his strong allegiance to social reform into a unique vision that might be best termed mystic socialism.\n\nPerhaps the most significant event in Carpenter's life happened in 1891, when returning from a journey to India, he met George Merrill, with whom he found an immediate and mutual attraction. Merrill had been raised in the slums of Sheffield and had no formal education. The attachment between the two men was undoubtedly one of real affection, but it also enabled Carpenter to achieve one of his long-standing goals in life: the realization of a bond between men that refused to be hindered by the rigid class divisions of English society\u2014the type of bonding professed by Carpenter's poetic idol, Whitman.\n\nThe two men took up residence at Millthorpe, and Carpenter began the period of radical theorization that produced the works on which his reputation largely rests: Love's Coming of Age (1896), The Intermediate Sex (1908), and Intermediate Types among Primitive Folks (1914). The tracts extend Carpenter's mystic socialism into a discussion of female gender equality and same-sex desire, and argue that by ending the oppression of \"the sex-love passion,\" society can instill a new type of individualism that will lead to liberation and democracy.\n\nThe Intermediate Sex, Carpenter's most famous tract, argues that through both social and natural evolution, sex has outgrown its simple biological purposes, and that increased instances of uranism\u2014Carpenter's term for homosexuality\u2014represent the evolution of a distinctive third sex designed to lead society into a new set of social relations.\n\nCarpenter became a hero to the first generation of Labour politicians. During the short-lived Labour government in 1924, Carpenter's eightieth birthday was marked by a commemorative greeting signed by every member of the Cabinet. For unknown reasons, Carpenter and Merrill left Millthorpe in 1922 and moved to Guildford in Surrey. George Merrill died in 1928, and Carpenter a year later. They are buried together in a grave in the Mount Cemetery, Guildford.\n\nSee alsoEllis, Havelock; Fabians; Feminism; Homosexuality and Lesbianism; Morris, William; Socialism; Symonds, John Addington.\n\nbibliography\n\nPrimary Sources\n\nA Bibliography of Edward Carpenter.

In 2016 the school hit the headlines when its headmaster admitted its fees were unaffordable, while announcing \u2018generous financial support\u2019 for families with an income under \u00a3120,000.

Its first building, next to St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, burnt down in the Great Fire of London. It was twice rebuilt in the City before moving in 1884 to a purpose-built Alfred Waterhouse building in Hammersmith (since outgrown and now demolished). In 1968 the school moved to its present site on the banks of the Thames in Barnes, a former filter bed with awkward ground conditions. Here Powell & Moya \u2013 perhaps not in their finest hour \u2013 designed a lightweight system-built CLASP school (Consortium of Local Authorities Special Programme, or \u2018Collection of Loosely Assembled Steel Parts\u2019 to its detractors).

It completes a great loop of teaching space at the heart of the school site in befitting proportions that harbour unexpectedly deep plans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalters & Cohen won the project in an invited competition in 2012, beating Hawkins\\Brown, Eric Parry, Ian Ritchie and Stanton Williams to the commission. \u2018We developed the brief from the inside out,\u2019 says practice co-founder Mich\u00e1l Cohen, who worked with the school over a six-month period to scope its current and future needs. Her starting point was observation, undertaken in the school\u2019s previous teaching buildings, and she describes watching pupils running \u2018like sand\u2019 through its spaces at a rhythm of 40-minute intervals, marked by the sound of a tannoy bell and causing the whole building to shake. \u2018It was easy to see where the pinch-points were, and there was no natural light nor views from the circulation spaces,\u2019 she recalls.\n\nCohen assessed that the school had a vision of learning, discussion and interaction happening everywhere, but it wasn\u2019t sure what this looked like. An important move was to persuade the client to incorporate breakout spaces, both big and small, into corridor areas, expressing the pedagogical ethos spatially. These are carefully calibrated to reflect departmental needs \u2013 one-to-one spaces for maths, small-group spaces for languages, bigger ones for humanities. Naturally, the school also wanted a building that would stand the test of time in terms of robustness but also with respect to its long-term accommodation of shifting educational models and trends. Here Walters & Cohen has worked assiduously to integrate service runs and cores with circulation within a resilient structural grid. The school also expressed a desire for a \u2018non-masculine\u2019 building. \u2018When we drilled into that concept,\u2019 says Cohen, \u2018it turned out they didn\u2019t want the elevations to articulate a grid. So we developed a non-regular rhythm for the courtyard fa\u00e7ades with three different sizes of glass-and-louvre module.\u2019\n\nSource:Dennis Gilbert\n\n\n\nBeyond the introspection of the quad, the building\u2019s most public face \u2013 glimpsed from across the Thames through trees and the frontages of auxiliary buildings \u2013 presents vertically corrugated battlements of irregularly spaced precast fins, interspersed with long glazing drops. This vertical language, present on both outer elevations, is integral to an environmental strategy that provides a high proportion of natural ventilation, as well as providing solar shading and noise attenuation.\n\nA related external manoeuvre was to effectively pedestrianise an existing service route between the new building and the River Thames, prioritising this space for the benefit of pupils for the first time. The Founder\u2019s Court is landscaped in a similar urban-realm language, with trees, and plinths (soon to be populated with statues) \u2013 the idea being to ensure the area is inhabited and not just gazed at in the keep-off-the-grass tradition.\n\nSource:Dennis Gilbert\n\n\n\nThe building\u2019s environmental strategies are closely fused with an acoustic plan to dampen internal sound reverberation and mitigate against noise from the nearby A4 and Heathrow flight path. Much of the in-situ frame and 80 per cent of its concrete ceiling soffits are left exposed internally. Fresh air is supplied through manually operated apertures and louvres integrated into cladding modules. Air is conveyed through high-level corridor side-vents to grilles in roof lanterns above the circulation voids. Below ground, an audacious and surprisingly low-tech solution from structural engineer AKT II used dynamic compaction to stabilise conditions to enable a thermally useful 600mm-deep raft foundation, averting the need for the deep piles used in the earlier Science Blocks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalters & Cohen\u2019s addition is a simple volume that works cleverly to punch light and a hierarchy of sculpted spaces into a deep plan. Belying the pragmatic basis of its prescribed footprint, just about every corner of the building works to subvert its own rhythm by presenting \u2018wormholes\u2019 of luminescence and volume. The regular beat of the double-loaded corridor plan \u2013 even-handedly delivering 56 classrooms in two sizes over three levels \u2013 is broken up by a series of spatial crescendi. Cohen refers to these as \u2018jewels\u2019, and they include the school\u2019s triple-height atrium; a multipurpose secular hall neatly integrated with a chapel annexe; a ground-floor ceremonial room; and the lofty volume of a north-facing library overlooking the tree-lined Thames banks.\n\nIn the library, and across the school\u2019s network of circulation voids, fair-faced concrete finished to a tactile smoothness is juxtaposed with the delicate staccato rhythm of splay-legged balustrading, providing a language against which carefully selected gilt-framed portraits, rare books and artefacts are displayed like icons. An outstanding aspect of the project is its proportional play of volumes, ranging from crescendo spaces down to the scale of individual classrooms.\n\nSource:Dennis Gilbert\n\n\n\n\u2018Staff felt the new classrooms were bigger than the old ones, but they weren\u2019t,\u2019 says Cohen. \u2018It was just that they were in the right proportion, with windows down to the floor.\u2019\n\nSource:Dennis Gilbert\n\nPerhaps what the school meant when it called for a \u2018non-masculine\u2019 architecture was a building without pomp. And, indeed, the design intelligence represented is of the kind sometimes undersung: the ability to think across time while working co-operatively with existing and future context, getting the sensory qualities right \u2013 the sound, the fall of light, the experience of spatial proportion. On the day of my visit the school is pupil-less, but a sense of the building\u2019s potential to be animated by human activity is palpable. Hopefully the building will be occupied again as soon as the Covid-19 lockdown eases.\n\nWe live in interesting times and, at a point when levels of socio-economic inequality have scaled new heights (or depths) in the UK, St Paul\u2019s School has made some interesting decisions in commissioning new architecture. It has steered a prudent course in addressing the serious business of elite education while judiciously passing under the radar of an embarrassment of riches. In turn, Walters & Cohen has delivered a quietly erudite building that handles some of the less tangible but fundamentally important aspects of architecture \u2013 time, sound, light, volume \u2013 with sensibility and considerable architectural skill.\n\nEllie Duffy is a writer on architecture and the built environment\n\nArchitect\u2019s view\n\nThe General Teaching Building (GTB) at St Paul\u2019s is part of an ambitious masterplan for the school which, as a combined project, is aiming for a BREEAM score of Excellent.\n\nAs well as providing new general teaching facilities, a dining hall, library, secular hall and chapel, this phase of the development also includes a new energy centre that powers the entire campus, and has provided a new LTHW ring-main for existing and new buildings on site to plug into. The GTB is heated using low surface-temperature radiators that significantly reduce the amount of energy required to heat the required water. All of the boilers within the new energy centre have the ability to run at this reduced temperature so that, as the infrastructure is rolled out within subsequent and existing buildings, the energy consumption of the whole site can be further reduced.\n\nPVs cover all the available roof, providing the school with an ongoing source of renewable energy. They have been raised above the roof surface to allow a wildflower roof to grow around and beneath them and increase the site\u2019s overall biodiversity.\n\nWhere possible, the new building is naturally ventilated, using the high thermal mass of the in-situ concrete frame to regulate the building\u2019s temperature throughout the day and further reduce the amount of additional heating and cooling required.\n\nTim Rowley, Hannah Anderson, Mich\u00e1l Cohen\n\nClient\u2019s view\n\nOur old building defined both what we wanted and did not want from the new. We sought to replicate its functionality, space efficiency and lack of grandeur, and to lose its low light, noise and energy inefficiency. We wanted an inspiring and intimate building, not an intimidating one. We wanted light, transparency, sustainability and space efficiency. We wanted a building that was sociable and informal, that encouraged pupils to interact and to communicate as if in a university, while allowing staff to supervise them informally. We wanted to restore the old chapel, but to make the space around it more flexible. Finally, an atrium was the social hub of the school, the space where everyone came to meet at break times, but we wanted to recreate this as a lighter space that also encouraged use of outdoor areas: in short, a building that reinforced and perpetuated the best elements of our culture.\n\nThe building delivers on all of those wishes triumphantly. It is light and spacious, with breakout places for pupils to chat and work informally. The chapel is multifaith and its hall can be used for various purposes. The atrium is restored as the school\u2019s hub and spills out onto the court and sport areas. The building promotes quiet, calm, intimacy and purpose, yet it has presence. It is energy-efficient. It feels like a university for school pupils. The excitement among staff and pupils is palpable.\n\nMark Bailey, high master, St Paul\u2019s School\n\nWorking detail\n\nThe external-facing elevations of the General Teaching Building are constructed from vertical bands of load-bearing precast concrete and curtain walling. This fa\u00e7ade arrangement adds perpendicularity to a relatively long, horizontal building, and, through the use of ventilation piers, gives depth and interest to a fa\u00e7ade that can be viewed from several hundred metres away.\n\nWe wanted to ensure that all spaces received very good levels of natural light and that, where possible, the building was naturally ventilated. Within the teaching spaces, separating the daylight from the ventilation was crucial, to maintain a natural air path while allowing occupants to lower a blind over the window on a bright day and reduce glare on the teaching wall.\n\nTo achieve this, we designed a bespoke aluminium louvre that is mounted on the outside of the building. This is designed with enough free area to allow the correct volume of air through, with the louvres spaced and pitched so that no direct sunlight can enter the room beyond. Internally, a high-level vent linked to the BMS opens automatically when the room reaches a certain temperature and at specific hours in order to cool the building\u2019s thermal mass overnight.\n\nCO 2 sensors within the classrooms also alert the teachers to a build-up of stale air so that they can manually open these as well. At low level, a large, manually operated opening allows for a high-volume \u2018purge\u2019 of the air during warm weather.\n\nTim Rowley, Hannah Anderson, Mich\u00e1l Cohen\n\nProject data\n\nStart on site March 2016\n\nCompletion February 2020\n\nGross internal floor area 9,714m\u00b2\n\nConstruction cost \u00a343 million\n\nConstruction cost per m\u00b2 \u00a34,427\n\nArchitect Walters & Cohen Architects\n\nClient St Paul\u2019s School\n\nStructural engineer AKT II\n\nM&E consultant Max Fordham\n\nQuantity surveyor and cost consultant Arcadis\n\nProject manager Metis Projects\n\nCDM co-ordinator Robinson Low Francis\n\nApproved building inspector Butler & Young Approved Inspectors\n\nMain contractor Osborne\n\nCAD software used Vectorworks\n\nLandscape architect Bradley-Hole Schoenaich Landscape\n\nAcoustic engineer Max Fordham\n\nFa\u00e7ade consultant Eckersley O\u2019Callaghan\n\nSignage design Walters & Cohen\n\nPlanning consultant Lichfields\n\nAnnual CO 2 emissions 5 kgCO 2 /m\u00b2\n\nPerformance data\n\nOn-site energy generation 30 per cent of regulated energy\n\nHeating and hot water load 30.56 kWh/m\u00b2/yr (from Part L Model)\n\nTotal energy load 42.9 kwh/m\u00b2/yr regulated, 67.86 kWh/m\u00b2/yr regulated and unregulated (from Part L Model and excluding energy generation)\n\nAirtightness at 50Pa 4.24 m\u00b3/hr/m\u00b2 (measured)\n\nOverall area-weighted U-value 0.46 W/m\u00b2k (for whole envelope)\n\nPredicted design life 60 years"}, {"url": "https://www.archdaily.com/949112/st-pauls-school-walters-and-cohen", "page_content": "+ 20\n\nM&E Engineer: Max Fordham LLP\n\nStructural & Civil: AKT II\n\nFa\u00e7ade Consultant: Eckersley O'Callaghan\n\nCity: London\n\nCountry: United Kingdom\n\nDid you collaborate on this project?\n\nMore Specs\n\nLess Specs\n\nText description provided by the architects. The school wanted to replace the 1960s CLASP buildings, which were nearing the end of their lifespan, with a new general teaching building fit for 21st-century education. Their vision was for learning, discussion, and interaction to happen everywhere \u2013 not just in the classrooms and library \u2013 but they were not sure what this could look like. Walters & Cohen worked with the school community to understand their ethos, and then expanded the brief to include breakout spaces, which are peppered around the school to encourage teamwork and collaboration.\n\nAt more than 9,000m2, the building includes a library, dining hall, kitchen, administrative offices, a chapel, hall, and 56 classrooms. A generous triple-height space known as the Atrium is designed as a magnificent heart of the school: students stop by throughout the day for independent study and to meet friends. With views across the sports fields, it also makes a wonderful event space.\n\nConnecting the site well was important. The building\u2019s L-shape design links into buildings on either side, creating a ring of circulation on all levels, and encloses the re-landscaped central courtyard known as Founder\u2019s Court. The building provides an attractive impression of the school from the Thames path, and the location of the library was carefully chosen so that it looks across the river, making the most of this unique site and adding to the library\u2019s calm and inspiring atmosphere. Walters & Cohen also breathed new life into the lacklustre back-of-house north access road, transforming it into a pedestrian-priority route that provides a safer and more cheerful circulation between buildings, while allowing vehicles to meander slowly between the planters.\n\nThe breakout spaces, along with the Atrium and Founder\u2019s Court, have all been an instant hit with the students, and exceed the client\u2019s vision for learning beyond the classroom.\n\nExternally, the building is clad in pre-cast concrete with warm tones to complement the surrounding buildings\u2019 materiality. A stepped and layered fa\u00e7ade brings visual depth and a slender verticality to the otherwise long facades that can be viewed from a great distance. Internal-facing facades are clad in aluminium, which captures reflections of the new trees and plants within the central courtyard.\n\nThe internal materials were selected to be robust, with timber panelling lining much of the circulation, and high-quality visual concrete is expressed throughout. The building is filled with light and fresh air, achieved with the use of large roof lights and voids connecting the building\u2019s multiple levels. Large floor-to-ceiling windows provide generous views out on all sides."}, {"url": "https://biblehub.com/topical/naves/p/paul--educated_at_jerusalem_in_the_school_of_gamaliel.htm", "page_content": "Nave's Topical Index\n\nNave's Topical Index\n\nI am truly a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as you all are this day.\n\nActs 26:4\n\nMy manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among my own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;\n\nNave's Topical Index\n\nLibrary\n\nSt. Paul's Wish to be Accursed from Christ.\n\n... of Cilicia; but sent to Jerusalem for an ... destined chieftain among Christians, is\n\neducated among Pharisees ...
