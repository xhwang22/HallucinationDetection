He also created illustrations for books, designed theatre sets, and costumes as well as produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo's first published illustration appeared in 1918. It was a monogram for La Sir\u00e8ne publishing house. Then he also illustrated Les Joues en Feu by Raymond Radiguet, Bernouard, in 1920; Pommes d'Anis by Francis Jammes, Emile-Paul, 1923; Les Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel by Jean Cocteau, NRF, and Les Amis Nouvel by Paul Morand, Au Sans Pareil, both in 1924; Rom\u00e9o et Juliette by Shakespeare, Au Sans Pareil, in 1926, among others. Jean Hugo\u2019s paintings were unique in the artistic world of the 20th century. They maintained an authentic originality while recalling certain avant-garde themes of metaphysical painting or magical realism. At the start of the 1930s, in between various theatrical projects, including Jean Cocteau\u2019s Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel, he produced a series of masterful artworks, such as Solitude (1933). He was interested in forest scenes (L'Ermite de Meudon, 1933) and religious themes (La C\u00e8ne, 1933). L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. Many of his paintings were based on the sketches that he created all the time. He used to say that \"inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it.\" L'Imposteur (1931) was a conclusion of Jean Hugo's first artistic period. Around this time he moved from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, after the death of his grandmother. His painting of that period was a masterful assembly of the most important insights he had acquired so far. The lessons of the Italian primitives, of Poussin, of Henri Rousseau, and Picasso, were among the sources of inspiration on which he was constantly drawing. In the middle of the 1930s, Jean Hugo started to use oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. The artist's work witnessed his intention to work outside of present-day currents and fashionable theories. He never took part in the artistic debates and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public. The artist illustrated many limited edition books published between 1948 and 1984 by Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Benoit (PAB), collaborating with such writers as Ren\u00e9 Char, Marcel Jouhandeau, Tristan Tzara and Ren\u00e9 Crevel. Jean Hugo's artworks were widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the United States. Among the most prominent of them were: Jean Hugo and Max Jacob at the Claridge Gallery, London, 1929; Jean Hugo '77 at the Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977; Paintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau at Sotheby's, London, 1981; Jean Hugo: 1894-1984 at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985; Jean Hugo: a Retrospective at the Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996; Jean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne at the Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001; Jean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien at the Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014, etc."}, {"url": "https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O34234/costume-designed-by-jean-hugo-theatre-costume-hugo-jean/", "page_content": "You can use the image for:\n\nNon-commercial research and private study\n\nTeaching and instruction\n\nNon-commercial publishing (up to A5-size, and in print runs of up to 4000 copies)\n\nNon-commercial online use, up to 768 pixels, and for up to 5 years\n\nPlease indicate that you accept all terms to proceed"}, {"url": "https://www.priaulxlibrary.co.uk/articles/article/victor-hugo-and-guernsey-jean-hugo", "page_content": "Jean Hugo was the great-grandson of Victor Hugo. A talented artist and theatre designer, he was a schoolboy at Elizabeth College in Guernsey and made later visits to the island, of which he was very fond, including attending the inauguration of Jean Boucher's celebrated statue of the poet in 1914. The Library has a signed copy of his autobiography, Le Regard de la m\u00e9moire, which he gave to Roger Martin, the curator of Hauteville House at the time of his visit in 1977; Roger Martin's ancestor was, coincidentally, one of Victor Hugo's 'poor children.' The photograph is courtesy of the Guernsey Press.\n\nBy Dinah Bott.\n\nJean Hugo was born in Paris in 1894, the son of Georges Hugo and his wife, Pauline M\u00e9nard-Dorian. His wife\u2019s family owned a holiday home on the cliffs at Icart in Guernsey known as La Marcherie. From 1907 until 1910 Jean was at school at Elizabeth College in Guernsey. He enjoyed his time at school here greatly; he played football, was very good at boxing (his bony physique gave him a long reach !), did a great turn in the annual French school play, won prizes for French and Latin and excelled at art. He was in School House and during term time probably boarded. We do not know if he remained in Guernsey for the summer, although he did say in his memoirs that the Sundays he spent in Guernsey were among the best of his life. He recalled his school years in Guernsey in a beautifully written vignette in the second of his two biographical works, Le Regard de la m\u00e9moire, which was published just before his death and takes his life up to 1945.\n\nAfter leaving College he attended sixth-form in Paris. Like his father he joined up as soon as he could, in 1914. He was wounded in May 1915 at La Targette in Pas-de-Calais, and rejoined the front in September 1915. He commenced then an extensive series of delicate sketches and drawings of operations in Artois, Verdun, and Picardy, which he continued until 1918. They depict war-torn landscapes and scenes of soldiers\u2019 lives at the front and behind the lines. Aside from their artistic merit they join his father\u2019s war sketches as being very valuable documentary evidence of WWI.\n\nHugo went on to mix with the artistic post-war elite, amongst whom he counted as great friends such luminaries as Jean Cocteau, Pablo Picasso, Paul Eluard, Francis Poulenc, Max Jacob, Cecil Beaton and Eric Satie. As well as painting vividly in oils he illustrated books with watercolours and lithographs. He was particularly interested in the theatre and designed costumes and sets, for which he produced exquisite maquettes. His work was greatly appreciated in the UK and America, and he painted backdrops of Stratford-upon-Avon for the Quatercentenary of Shakespeare\u2018s birth in 1964 which are in the collection of the V&A. In 1931 he acquired an estate in Provence, the Mas de Fourques at Lunel, which remained his base until his death in 1984. He married twice, first to artist Valentine Grossman, and secondly to Laura Hope-Nicholson, by whom he had seven children.\n\nMaurice Sachs: \u2018Jean Hugo was calm, kind and generous. Life flowed calmly before him and as far as we knew he had no enemies. He carried the heavy burden of his family name with elegance. Like his father Georges Hugo he was a man of the world, a man of great distinction in heart and spirit, a kind friend, a man you would want to have in your life.\u2019 La D\u00e9cade de l'illusion (Paris: Gallimard, 1950 pp. 14\u201316).\n\nProjected costume design for 'The Prince' by Jean Hugo, Les Cents Baisers, Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, 1935.

His grandfather, Charles Hugo was a journalist, pioneer of early photographic techniques and a campaigner against the death penalty, and his father Georges Hugo was a published author and a recognised painter. His paternal aunt was the socialite Jeanne Hugo.His mother, Pauline M\u00e9nard-Dorian, was the daughter of Paul-Fran\u00e7ois M\u00e9nard, conseiller g\u00e9n\u00e9ral and d\u00e9put\u00e9 of the H\u00e9rault department during the 1870s\u201380s, by his wife Aline Dorian, daughter of Pierre Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dorian, minister of works during the siege of Paris.Jean Hugo was married twice, first in 1919 to Valentine Hugo (n\u00e9e Valentine Gross, no children from this civil marriage) and then in 1949 to Lauretta Hope-Nicholson, daughter of Hedley Hope-Nicholson. Jean Hugo and Lauretta had seven children: Charles Hugo (farmer), Marie Hugo (artist), Jean-Baptiste Hugo (artist), Ad\u00e8le Hugo (artist), Jeanne Hugo-Chabrol (teacher), Sophie Hugo-Lafont (librarian), L\u00e9opoldine Hugo (artist).Jean Hugo's half-brother Fran\u00e7ois Hugo designed limited-edition jewellery interpretations for Pablo Picasso, Jean Cocteau, Max Ernst and Coco Chanel during the '20s Modern period. Pierre Hugo \u2013 son of Fran\u00e7ois Hugo \u2013 is also a jewellery designer and has written a book about the artistic legacy of the Hugo family, Les Hugo \u2013 Un t\u00e9moignage (Rocher, France, 2007).PaintingsHugo is predominantly known for his sketches and oil or gouache paintings, which are often executed in small formats.

He used to say that \"Inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it\".L'Imposteur (1931) concludes Hugo's first artistic period, which coincides with his move from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, following the death of his grandmother. This imposing painting is an assembly of the most important insights he had acquired thus far: the lessons of the Italian primitives, of Henri Rousseau, of Poussin and Picasso, sources of inspiration on which he is constantly drawing. The subject of the painting evokes the discomfort of the catechumen in the midst of the faithful, prevented from taking communion during Christmas mass at the Church of Saint-Fran\u00e7ois in Montpellier. The painting is set in the countryside around Lunel, with its vineyards and low scrubland (garrigue). The tense and complex composition of the work is extremely well executed. No element, line, motif, nuance of colour or object is secondary. Each element contributes to the pictorial vision. The delicate volumes are bathed in luminosity and stand out from the background. The figures are fixed in the space by superimposed connections, in the Florentine manner.In the middle of the 1930s, he began using oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. Le Mangeur au chandail ray\u00e9 (autoportrait) (1940) shows the artist in his home at the Mas de Fourques. The motif of the stripes contrasts with the neat contours of the table, the chimney and the wall. In this homely setting, the figure seems surrounded by mystery and casualness. Although Hugo does not draw greatly on De Chirico, this work evokes the feeling of isolation and mystery that characterises the production of the latter.Jean Hugo's work bears witness to his intention to work outside of current trends and fashionable theories. He never felt the need to participate in the artistic debates of his time and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public.His auction record is $US308,200, for Les Plaisirs et les Jours, set at Fran\u00e7ois de Ricql\u00e8s' auction, Paris, on 26 November 1999.Selected exhibitionsHugo's work has been widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the USA.Jean Hugo and Max Jacob, Claridge Gallery, London, 1929The Art of Jean Hugo, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, 1973Jean Hugo, Mus\u00e9e Paul Val\u00e9ry, S\u00e8te, 1974Jean Hugo '77, Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977Jean Hugo, Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1977\u201378Paintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau, Sotheby's, London, 1981Jean Hugo: Costumes pour \"l'Homme qui rit\", Maison de Victor Hugo, Paris, 1984Jean Hugo: 1894\u20131984, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985Jean Hugo: palettes et souvenirs, Mus\u00e9e Victor Hugo, Paris, 1994\u201395Jean Hugo: Dessins des ann\u00e9es de guerre (1915\u20131919), Ch\u00e2teau de Bl\u00e9rancourt Mus\u00e9e de la coop\u00e9ration franco-am\u00e9ricaine, 1994\u201395Jean Hugo: Une R\u00e9trospective, Pavillon du Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1995Jean Hugo: a Retrospective, Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996Jean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne, Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001Jean Hugo, le manuscrit enlumin\u00e9, Mus\u00e9e M\u00e9dard, Lunel, 2014Jean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien, Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014Published workLe Retour de l'enfant terrible: Lettres 1923\u20131966 by Jean Bourgoint, Jean Hugo, Jean Mouton (Descl\u00e9e de Brouwer, 1975)Avant d'oublier (Before I Forget), autobiography (Fayard, 1976), was a humorous memoir of his family and a first-hand account of the 1920s French Surrealist movement.Le Regard de la m\u00e9moire (Actes Sud, 1983) \u2013 Jean Hugo's memoirs of the period from 1914 to 1945.

His work is far better known, and valued, in America than in France, where he still suffers a little of being eclipsed by his name.

He was born in Paris and died in his home at the Mas de Fourques, near Lunel, France. Brought up in a lively artistic environment, he began teaching himself drawing and painting and wrote essays and poetry from a very early age. His artistic career spans the 20th century, from his early sketches of the First World War, through the creative ferment of the Parisian interwar years, and up to his death in 1984. He was part of a number of artistic circles that included Jean Cocteau, Raymond Radiguet, Pablo Picasso, Georges Auric, Erik Satie, Blaise Cendrars, Marie-Laure de Noailles, Paul Eluard, Francis Poulenc, Charles Dullin, Louis Jouvet, Colette, Marcel Proust, Jacques Maritain, Max Jacob, Carl Theodor Dreyer, Marie Bell, Louise de Vilmorin, Cecil Beaton and many others.\n\nHugo family\n\nJean Hugo was the great-grandson of the poet, playwright, novelist, essayist, visual artist, statesman, human rights activist and exponent of the Romantic movement in France, Victor Hugo. His grandfather, Charles Hugo was a journalist, pioneer of early photographic techniques and a campaigner against the death penalty, and his father Georges Hugo was a published author and a recognised painter.\n\nHis mother, Pauline M\u00e9nard-Dorian, was the daughter of Paul-Fran\u00e7ois M\u00e9nard, conseiller g\u00e9n\u00e9ral and d\u00e9put\u00e9 of the H\u00e9rault department during the 1870s\u201380s, by his wife Aline Dorian, daughter of Pierre Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dorian, minister of works during the siege of Paris.\n\nJean Hugo was married twice, first in 1919 to Valentine Hugo (n\u00e9e Valentine Gross, no children from this marriage) and then in 1949 to Lauretta Hope-Nicholson, daughter of Hedley Hope-Nicholson. Jean Hugo and Lauretta had seven children, several of whom have gone on to establish successful careers in the arts.\n\nJean Hugo's half-brother Fran\u00e7ois Hugo designed limited-edition jewellery interpretations for Pablo Picasso, Jean Cocteau, Max Ernst and Coco Chanel during the '20s Modern period.\n\nPierre Hugo \u2013 son of Fran\u00e7ois Hugo \u2013 is also a jewellery designer and has written a book about the artistic legacy of the Hugo family, Les Hugo \u2013 Un Temoignage (Rocher, France, 2007).\n\nPaintings\n\nHugo is predominantly known for his sketches and oil or gouache paintings, which are often executed in small formats. He also illustrated books, designed theatre sets and costumes and produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo designed the sets and costumes for Carl Theodor Dreyer's film The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928). His paintings can be viewed at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, and are also present in collections in London, Tokyo, Toronto, Paris, Marseille, and at the Musee Fabre in Montpellier, France \u2013 where there is room dedicated to his paintings.\n\nJean Hugo's painting is unique in the artistic panorama of the first half of the 20th century and maintains an authentic originality while evoking certain avant-garde themes of magical realism or metaphysical painting. At the start of the 1930s, in between na\u00efve and happy scenes and various theatrical projects \u2013 such as Jean Cocteau's Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel \u2013 he produced a series of masterful works in brooding, unsettling, tones (Solitude, 1933).\n\nHe showed an interest in forest scenes (L'Ermite de Meudon, 1933) and religious themes (La C\u00e8ne, 1933). L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. His painting were based on the sketchbooks that he had with him at all times. He used to say that \"Inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it\".\n\nL'Imposteur (1931) concludes Hugo's first artistic period, which coincides with his move from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, following the death of his grandmother. This imposing painting is a masterful assembly of the most important insights he had acquired thus far: the lessons of the Italian primitives, of Henri Rousseau, of Poussin and Picasso, sources of inspiration on which he is constantly drawing. The subject of the painting evokes the discomfort of the catechumen in the midst of the faithful, prevented from taking communion during Christmas mass at the Church of Saint-Fran\u00e7ois in Montpellier. The painting is set in the countryside around Lunel, with its vineyards and low scrubland (garrigue). The tense and complex composition of the work is extremely well executed. No element, line, motif, nuance of colour or object is secondary. Each element contributes to the pictorial vision. The delicate volumes are bathed in an intense luminosity and stand out from the background. The figures are fixed in the space by superimposed connections, in the Florentine manner.\n\nIn the middle of the 1930s, he began using oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. Le Mangeur au chandail ray\u00e9 (autoportrait) (1940) shows the artist in his home at the Mas de Fourques. The motif of the stripes contrasts with the neat contours of the table, the chimney and the wall. In this homely setting, the figure seems surrounded by mystery and casualness. Although Hugo does not draw greatly on De Chirico, this work evokes the feeling of isolation and mystery that characterises the production of the latter.\n\nJean Hugo's work bears witness to his intention to work outside of current trends and fashionable theories. He never felt the need to participate in the artistic debates of his time and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public.\n\nHis auction record is $US308,200, for Les Plaisirs et les Jours, set at Fran\u00e7ois de Ricql\u00e8s' auction, Paris, on 26 November 1999.\n\nSelected Exhibitions\n\nHugo's work has been widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the USA.\n\nJean Hugo and Max Jacob, Claridge Gallery, London, 1929\n\nThe Art of Jean Hugo, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, 1973\n\nJean Hugo, Mus\u00e9e Paul Val\u00e9ry, S\u00e8te, 1974\n\nJean Hugo '77, Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977\n\nJean Hugo, Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1977-78\n\nPaintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau, Sotheby's, London, 1981\n\nJean Hugo: Costumes pour \"l'Homme qui rit\", Maison de Victor Hugo, Paris, 1984\n\nJean Hugo: 1894-1984, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985\n\nJean Hugo: palettes et souvenirs, Mus\u00e9e Victor Hugo, Paris, 1994-5\n\nJean Hugo: Dessins des ann\u00e9es de guerre (1915\u20131919), Ch\u00e2teau de Bl\u00e9rancourt Mus\u00e9e de la coop\u00e9ration franco-am\u00e9ricaine, 1994-5\n\nJean Hugo: Une R\u00e9trospective, Pavillon du Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1995\n\nJean Hugo: a Retrospective, Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996\n\nJean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne, Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001\n\nJean Hugo, le manuscrit enlumin\u00e9, Mus\u00e9e M\u00e9dard, Lunel, 2014\n\nJean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien, Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014\n\nPublished work\n\nLe Retour de l'Enfant Terrible: Lettres 1923\u20131966 by Jean Bourgoint, Jean Hugo, Jean Mouton (Descl\u00e9e de Brouwer, 1975)\n\nAvant d'Oublier (Before I Forget), autobiography (Fayard, 1976), was a humorous memoir of his family and a first-hand account of the 1920s French Surrealist movement.\n\nLe Regard de la M\u00e9moire (Actes Sud, 1983) \u2013 Jean Hugo's memoirs of the period from 1914 to 1945.

"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Maurice-Maeterlinck", "page_content": "Maurice Maeterlinck, in full Maurice Polydore-Marie-Bernard Maeterlinck, also called (from 1932) Comte Maeterlinck, (born August 29, 1862, Ghent, Belgium\u2014died May 6, 1949, Nice, France), Belgian Symbolist poet, playwright, and essayist who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1911 for his outstanding works of the Symbolist theatre. He wrote in French and looked mainly to French literary movements for inspiration.\n\nMaeterlinck studied law at the University of Ghent and was admitted to the bar in that city in 1886. In Paris in 1885\u201386 he met Auguste Villiers de L\u2019Isle-Adam and the leaders of the Symbolist movement, and he soon abandoned law for literature. His first verse collection, Serres chaudes (\u201cHothouses\u201d), and his first play, La Princesse Maleine, were published in 1889. Maeterlinck made a dramatic breakthrough in 1890 with two one-act plays, L\u2019Intruse (The Intruder) and Les Aveugles (The Blind). His Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (1892), produced in Paris at the avant-garde Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l\u2019Oeuvre by the director Aur\u00e9lien Lugn\u00e9-Po\u00eb, is the unquestioned masterpiece of Symbolist drama and provided the basis for an opera (1902) by Claude Debussy. Set in a nebulous, fairy-tale past, the play conveys a mood of hopeless melancholy and doom in its story of the destructive passion of Princess M\u00e9lisande, who falls in love with her husband\u2019s younger brother, Pell\u00e9as. Though written in prose, Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande may be considered the most accomplished of all 19th-century attempts at poetic drama.\n\nBritannica Quiz Classic Children\u2019s Books Quiz\n\nMaeterlinck wrote many other plays, including historical dramas such as Monna Vanna (1902). Gradually, his Symbolism was tempered by his interest in English drama, especially William Shakespeare and the Jacobeans. Only L\u2019Oiseau bleu (1908; The Blue Bird) rivaled Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande in popularity. An allegorical fantasy conceived as a play for children, it portrays a search for happiness in the world. First performed by the Moscow Art Theatre in 1908, this somewhat sentimental dramatic parable was highly regarded for a time, but its charm has evaporated, and the optimism of the play now seems facile. After he won the Nobel Prize, however, his reputation declined, although his Le Bourgmestre de Stilmonde (1917; The Burgomaster of Stilmonde), a patriotic play in which he explores the problems of Flanders under the wartime rule of an unprincipled German officer, briefly enjoyed great success.\n\nIn his Symbolist plays, Maeterlinck uses poetic speech, gesture, lighting, setting, and ritual to create images that reflect his protagonists\u2019 moods and dilemmas. Often the protagonists are waiting for something mysterious and fearful that will destroy them. The profound and moving atmosphere of the plays, though lacking in intellectual complexity, is augmented by tentative dialogue, based on half-formed suggestions, at times naively repetitious, and occasionally sentimental, but sometimes possessed of great subtlety and power. As a dramatist, Maeterlinck influenced Hugo von Hofmannsthal, W.B. Yeats, John Millington Synge, and Eugene O\u2019Neill. Maeterlinck\u2019s plays have been widely translated, and no Belgian dramatist had greater effect on worldwide audiences.\n\nMaeterlinck\u2019s prose writings are remarkable blends of mysticism, occultism, and interest in the world of nature. They represent the common Symbolist reaction against materialism, science, and mechanization and are concerned with such questions as the immortality of the soul, the nature of death, and the attainment of wisdom. Maeterlinck presented his mystical speculations in Le Tr\u00e9sor des humbles (1896; The Treasure of the Humble) and La Sagesse et la destin\u00e9e (1898; \u201cWisdom and Destiny\u201d). His most widely read prose writings, however, are two extended essays, La Vie des abeilles (1901; The Life of the Bee) and L\u2019Intelligence des fleurs (1907; The Intelligence of Flowers), in which Maeterlinck sets out his philosophy of the human condition. Maeterlinck was made a count by the Belgian king in 1932."}, {"url": "https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Maurice_Maeterlinck", "page_content": "\n\n\n\nMaurice Polydore Marie Bernard, Count Maeterlinck (August 29, 1862 - May 6, 1949) was a Belgian poet, playwright, and essayist writing in French. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1911. The main themes in his work are death and the meaning of life. Influenced by the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, Maeterlinck believed that humankind was ultimately powerless in the face of forces that was out of human control. He would reflect this fatalism in his style of play, creating the static play and working with marionettes as a metaphor for the human condition.\n\nBiography\n\nCount Maurice Maeterlinck was born in Ghent, Belgium to a wealthy, French-speaking family. His father, Polydore, was a notary, who enjoyed tending the hothouses on their property. His mother, Mathilde, came from a wealthy family.[1]\n\nIn September, 1874 he was sent to the Jesuit College of Sainte-Barbe, where works of the French Romantics were scorned. Only plays on religious subjects were permitted. His experiences at this school undoubtedly influenced his distaste for the Catholic Church and organized religion.[2]\n\nHe had written poems and short novels during his studies, but his father wanted him to go into law. After finishing his law studies at the University of Ghent in 1885, he spent a few months in Paris, France. He met there some members of the then new Symbolist movement, Villiers de l'Isle Adam in particular. The latter would have a big influence on the work of Maeterlinck.\n\nIn 1889, he became famous overnight after his first play, La Princesse Maleine, received enthusiastic praise from Octave Mirbeau, the literary critic of Le Figaro (August 1890). In the following years, he wrote a series of symbolist plays characterized by fatalism and mysticism, most importantly L'Intruse (The Intruder, 1890), Les Aveugles (The Blind, 1890) and Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (1892).\n\nGeorgette Leblanc\n\nHe had a relationship with the singer and actress Georgette Leblanc from 1895 till 1918. She influenced his work during those two decades. With the play Aglavaine et S\u00e9lysette Maeterlinck began to create characters, especially female characters, more in control of their destinies. Leblanc performed these female characters on stage. Even though mysticism and metaphysics influenced his work throughout his career, he slowly replaced his Symbolism with a more existential style.[3]\n\nIn 1895, with his parents frowning upon his open relationship with an actress, Maeterlinck and Leblanc moved to the district of Passy in Paris. The Catholic Church was unwilling to grant her a divorce from her Spanish husband. They frequently entertained guests, including Mirbeau, Jean Lorraine, and Paul Fort. They spent their summers in Normandy. During this period, Maeterlinck published his Douze Chansons (1896), Treasure of the Humble (1896), The Life of the Bee (1901), and Ariane et Barbe-Bleue (\"Ariadne and Bluebeard,\" 1902).[4]\n\nIn 1903, Maeterlinck received the Triennial Prize for Dramatic Literature from the Belgian government.[5]\n\nIn 1906, Maeterlinck and Leblanc moved to a villa in Grasse. He spent his hours meditating and walking. As he emotionally pulled away from Leblanc, he entered a state of depression. Diagnosed with neurasthenia, he rented the Benedictine Abbey of St. Wandrille in Normandy to help him relax. Leblanc would often walk around in the dress of an abbess; he would wear roller skates as he moved about the house.[6] During this time, he wrote his essay L'Intelligence des fleurs (\"The Intelligence of Flowers,\" 1906), in which he discussed politics and championed socialist ideas. He donated money to many workers' unions and socialist groups. At this time he conceived his greatest contemporary success: the fairy play L'Oiseau Bleu (The Blue Bird, 1908). He also wrote Marie-Victoire (1907) and Mary Magdalene (1908) with lead roles for Leblanc.[7] Aside from L'Oiseau Bleu, critics did not praise these plays, and they considered Leblanc no longer an inspiration to the playwright. Even though alfresco performances of some of his plays at St. Wandrille had been successful, Maeterlinck felt that he was losing his privacy. The death of his mother on June 11, 1910 added to his depression.[8]\n\nIn 1910 he met the 18-year-old actress Ren\u00e9e Dahon during a rehearsal of The Blue Bird. She became his lighthearted companion. Winning the Nobel Prize for Literature served to heighten his spirits, as well. By 1913, he was more openly socialist and sided with the Belgian trade unions against the Catholic party during a strike.[9] In fact, he began to study mysticism and bombasted the Catholic church in his essays for construing the history of the universe.[10] By a decree of January 26, 1914, his opera omnia was placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nWhen Germany invaded Belgium in 1914, Maeterlink wished to join the French Foreign Legion, but his application was denied due to his age. He and Leblanc decided to leave Grasse for a villa near Nice, where he spent the next decade of his life. He gave speeches on the bravery of the Belgian people and assigned blame upon all Germans for the war. While in Nice he wrote the plays Le Bourgemestre de Stilmonde (The Burgomaster of Stilmonde), which was quickly labeled by the American press as a \"Great War Play.\" He also wrote Les Fiancailles (The Betrothal), a sequel to The Blue Bird, in which the heroine of the play is clearly not a Leblanc archetype.[11]\n\nOn February 15, 1919 Maeterlinck married Dahon. He accepted an invitation to the United States. Samuel Goldwyn asked him to produce a few scenarios for film. Only two of Maeterlinck's submissions still exist; Goldwyn didn't use any of his submissions. Maeterlinck had prepared one based on his The Life of a Bee. After reading the first few pages Goldwyn burst out of his office, exclaiming: \"My God! The hero is a bee!\"\n\nDahon gave birth to a stillborn child in 1925. By the 1920s, Maeterlinck found himself no longer in tune with the times. His plays of this period (La Puissance des morts, Le Grand Secret, Berniquel) received little attention.\n\nEntomology\n\nAt this time he penned his first works on entomology. In 1926 he published La Vie des Termites (The Life of the Termite), plagiarizing The Soul of the White Ant, researched and written by the South African poet and scientist Eugene Marais (1871-1936).[12] Marais' later suicide has been attributed to this act of plagiarism by some.[13] Maeterlinck's own words in La Vie de Termites indicate that the possible discovery or accusation of plagiarism worried him:\n\nIt would have been easy, in regard to every statement, to allow the text to bristle with footnotes and references. In some chapters there is not a sentence but would have clamoured for these; and the letterpress would have been swallowed up by vast masses of comment, like one of those dreadful books we hated so much at school. There is a short bibliography at the end of the volume which will no doubt serve the same purpose.\n\nDespite these misgivings, there is no reference to Eugene Marais in the bibliography. His other works on entomology include L'Araign\u00e9e de verre (The Glass Spider, 1923) and Vie des fourmis (The Life of the Ant, 1930).\n\nIn 1930 he bought a ch\u00e2teau in Nice, France, and named it Orlamonde, a name occurring in his work Quinze Chansons.\n\nHe was made a count by Albert I, King of the Belgians in 1932.\n\nAccording to an article published in the New York Times in 1940, he arrived in the United States from Lisbon on the Greek Liner Nea Hellas. He had fled to Lisbon in order to escape the Nazi invasion of both Belgium and France. The Times quoted him as saying, \"I knew that if I was captured by the Germans I would be shot at once, since I have always been counted as an enemy of Germany because of my play, 'Le Bourgmestre de Stillemonde', which dealt with the conditions in Belgium during the German Occupation of 1918.\" As with his earlier visit to America, he still found Americans too casual, friendly and Francophilic for his taste.[14].\n\nHe returned to Nice after the war on August 10, 1947. In 1948, the French Academy awarded him the Medal for the French Language. He died in Nice on May 6, 1949 after suffering a heart attack. There was no priest at his funeral.\n\nThe Static Drama\n\nMaeterlinck, before 1905 , before 1905\n\nMaeterlinck, an avid reader of Arthur Schopenhauer, considered man powerless against the forces of fate. He believed that any actor, due to the hindrance of physical mannerisms and expressions, would inadequately portray the symbolic figures of his plays. He concluded that marionettes were an excellent alternative. Guided by strings operated by a puppeteer, marionettes are an excellent representation of fate's complete control over man. He wrote Int\u00e9rieur, La Mort de Tintagiles, and Alladine and Palomides for marionette theater.[15]\n\nFrom this, he gradually developed his notion of the static drama. He felt that it was the artist's responsibility to create something that expressed nothing of human emotions but rather of the external forces that compel people.[16] Materlinck once said: \"The stage is a place where works of art are extinguished. [...] Poems die when living people get into them.\"[17]\n\nHe explained his ideas on the static drama in his essay \"The Tragedies of Daily Life,\" which appeared in The Treasure of the Humble. The actors were to speak and move as if pushed and pulled by an external force, by fate acting as puppeteer. They were not to allow the stress of their inner emotions to compel their movements. Maeterlinck would often continue to refer to his cast of characters as \"marionettes.\"[18]\n\nLegacy\n\nPell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande inspired four major musical compositions at the turn of the twentieth century, an opera by Claude Debussy, (L 88, Paris, 1902), incidental music to the play composed by Jean Sibelius (opus 46, 1905), an orchestral suite by Gabriel Faur\u00e9 (opus 80, 1898), and a symphonic poem by Arnold Schoenberg (opus 5, 1902/1903).\n\nOther musical works based on Maeterlinck's plays include:\n\nAriadne and Bluebeard opera in 3 acts by Paul Dukas Princess Maleine overtures by Pierre de Br\u00e9ville and Cyril Scott\n\nan unfinished opera be Lili Boulanger The Seven Princesses incidental music by Br\u00e9ville The Death of Tintagiles symphonic poem by Charles Martin Loeffler\n\nincidental music by Ralph Vaughan Williams Aglavaine and S\u00e9lysette orchestral prelude by Arthur Honegger Monna Vanna an opera in 3 acts by Emil \u00c1br\u00e1nyi\n\nopera in 4 acts by Henry F\u00e9vrier\n\nand an unfinished opera by Sergei Rachmaninoff The Blind an opera by Beat Furrer\n\nList of works\n\nThe Blind\n\nThe Blue Bird: a Fairy Play in Six Acts\n\nThe Buried Temple\n\nThe Life of the Bee\n\nMehilaisten elama (Finnish)\n\nOur Friend the Dog\n\nPelleas and Melisande\n\nLa sagesse et la destinee (French)\n\nThe Unknown Guest\n\nWisdom and Destiny\n\nThe Wrack of the Storm\n\nThe Life of the Ant\n\nSister Beatrice Andardiane, and Barbu Bleue\n\nBefore the Great Silence\n\nThe Magic of the Stars\n\nThe Life of the White Ant\n\nLiterature\n\nW.

He also created illustrations for books, designed theatre sets, and costumes as well as produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo's first published illustration appeared in 1918. It was a monogram for La Sir\u00e8ne publishing house. Then he also illustrated Les Joues en Feu by Raymond Radiguet, Bernouard, in 1920; Pommes d'Anis by Francis Jammes, Emile-Paul, 1923; Les Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel by Jean Cocteau, NRF, and Les Amis Nouvel by Paul Morand, Au Sans Pareil, both in 1924; Rom\u00e9o et Juliette by Shakespeare, Au Sans Pareil, in 1926, among others. Jean Hugo\u2019s paintings were unique in the artistic world of the 20th century. They maintained an authentic originality while recalling certain avant-garde themes of metaphysical painting or magical realism. At the start of the 1930s, in between various theatrical projects, including Jean Cocteau\u2019s Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel, he produced a series of masterful artworks, such as Solitude (1933). He was interested in forest scenes (L'Ermite de Meudon, 1933) and religious themes (La C\u00e8ne, 1933). L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. Many of his paintings were based on the sketches that he created all the time. He used to say that \"inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it.\" L'Imposteur (1931) was a conclusion of Jean Hugo's first artistic period. Around this time he moved from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, after the death of his grandmother. His painting of that period was a masterful assembly of the most important insights he had acquired so far. The lessons of the Italian primitives, of Poussin, of Henri Rousseau, and Picasso, were among the sources of inspiration on which he was constantly drawing. In the middle of the 1930s, Jean Hugo started to use oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. The artist's work witnessed his intention to work outside of present-day currents and fashionable theories. He never took part in the artistic debates and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public. The artist illustrated many limited edition books published between 1948 and 1984 by Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Benoit (PAB), collaborating with such writers as Ren\u00e9 Char, Marcel Jouhandeau, Tristan Tzara and Ren\u00e9 Crevel. Jean Hugo's artworks were widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the United States. Among the most prominent of them were: Jean Hugo and Max Jacob at the Claridge Gallery, London, 1929; Jean Hugo '77 at the Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977; Paintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau at Sotheby's, London, 1981; Jean Hugo: 1894-1984 at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985; Jean Hugo: a Retrospective at the Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996; Jean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne at the Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001; Jean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien at the Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014, etc."}, {"url": "https://www.ellenhamptonbooks.com/blog/2019/7/2/maeterlinck-memory-and-the-blue-bird-of-happiness", "page_content": "In 1910, the blue bird of happiness landed in the United States, in New York, to be specific, on Broadway. The Blue Bird was a philosophical play written by Maurice Maeterlinck, who would win the Nobel Prize for Literature the following year for it and other works. His Pell\u00e9as and M\u00e9lisande is better known today, as productions of the Debussy opera continue to enliven the stage. But at the start of the 20th century, The Blue Bird was all the rage, emerging in film and song, baptizing airplanes and race cars, and like most popular cultural symbols, being reduced to its simplest iteration: the blue bird of happiness.\n\nMaeterlinck did not mind. He wrote entire volumes about the behavior of bees, termites, ants and spiders, and his observations of the human species were no less keen. He was a philosopher, poet, playwright, essayist and novelist with nearly 60 works published between 1889 and his death in 1949. He was considered one of the most brilliant and original writers of his time, banned by the Vatican, adored in Japan, translated into 25 languages. Yet today he has been entirely forgotten, except in a very few places. With a newly ubiquitous blue bird flitting \u2013 twitting? \u2013 around, it seems a good moment to retrieve its creator Maeterlinck from the other side of the Mirror of Oblivion.\n\nBorn in Ghent, Maeterlinck remains thus far Belgium\u2019s only claim to the Nobel Prize for Literature, and even then, he wrote in France and in French. Arguing in favor of his nomination, a group of Belgian parliamentarians noted that their culture had been submerged by three centuries of foreign occupation, and that his original Belgian voice should be recognized, even if expressed in French. A private Fondation Maurice Maeterlinck has been established in Ghent to try to keep his reputation alive, assisting a great-great nephew, Nicolas Maeterlinck, to publish an illustrated book on places that influenced his writing.[1]\n\nIf the blue bird flew 20 miles west of Paris, it would land in M\u00e9dan, a village nestled between the banks of the Seine and a bluff of forest, and that is where I came across Maeterlinck. He had bought the village castle in 1924 as a country compromise, close enough to the big city for his young wife, Ren\u00e9e, and far enough away for him to breathe the air. The Maeterlincks kept an apartment with a garden on rue Raynouard in Paris, but he wrote that the pollution in the city was so dense it turned the flowers black. He liked the country. The castle in M\u00e9dan wasn\u2019t his first, and it wouldn\u2019t be his last, but it suited him for a dozen years. His homes, which included a monastery and a casino, tended to be theatrical settings in which he produced dramatic works. I moved to M\u00e9dan from the Normandy countryside, as did Maeterlinck, also as a country compromise, 25 years ago. The pollution in Paris has been largely cleaned up, but I prefer birdsong to bus traffic.\n\nLike many castles, M\u00e9dan\u2019s began as a hunting pavilion, just the type of place where the princess meets the fairy who changes her destiny. The castle was first constructed in the mid-16th century and renovated into various forms through the 18th century. Maeterlinck wrote to a friend that he would be in good company: the poet Pierre Ronsard and the king Henri IV had slept there. He noted that M\u00e9dan also was the home of writer Emile Zola\u2019s villa, which was not nearly as grand as the castle, so he considered his purchase \u201cthe revenge of symbolism over realism.\u201d That was a pretty sophisticated contest for a rural village of some 300 residents, most of whom were growing grapes and tending livestock.\n\nWith the homes of such literary masters as Maeterlinck and Zola, the village has added a pen and paper to its seal, and has put itself on the regional tourist trail of writer\u2019s homes. Zola, who lived in M\u00e9dan from 1878 to 1902, also put the accent on the \u2018e\u2019 in M\u00e9dan in an attempt to smarten things up a bit. He referred to the house he bought on the banks of the Seine as \u201ca rabbit hutch\u201d and greatly expanded it, adding wings with each new literary success. The train track that ran through his back yard, connecting Paris to Le Havre, inspired him to write La B\u00eate Humaine (The Beast Within) in 1890. He said he wondered about the lives of the passengers he could see going by, an early precursor to Paula Hawkins\u2019 The Girl on the Train. From the farmers and peasants of the early 20th century, M\u00e9danais today (1,400 residents) mostly commute into Paris, a 25-minute train ride on a good day. The line still runs through Zola\u2019s back yard.\n\nMaeterlinck and his wife Ren\u00e9e left M\u00e9dan in 1936 after the election of the leftist Popular Front. He wrote to his American friend Florence Perkins: \u201cWe expect to emigrate to Portugal where I have good friends and where life is tranquil and sheltered from the taxman, who here takes just about everything I earn.\u201d[2] Maeterlinck worried about money. He made a lot of it, but castles are expensive, to buy and to keep. In 1930, he purchased a palace, constructed but not finished by a Russian investor who planned it as a casino in the hills above Nice. Then the notary ran away with his payment of 2.8 million FF (about $15 million today), and he had to buy it again. He and R\u00e9nee named it Orlamonde, after the mother of seven princesses in a poem he had written. Today it is a luxury hotel called the Palais Maeterlinck.\n\nThe Blue Bird brought him fame, if not happiness. He hated the social duties of a literary star, the interminable dinners and fancy parties the French referred to as pince-fesses in benighted days before the #MeToo/BalanceTonPorc movement. But then, as now, authors must make appearances. In 1919, he and Ren\u00e9e traveled to the United States for the launch of a Blue Bird Campaign for Happiness, which, to its credit, was a fundraising effort for postwar needs in Belgium and France. It was also America distilling a philosophical idea to its simplest form, and then making money from it. Isn\u2019t that what we do best? Maeterlinck was quoted as saying he \u201cliked the Americans too much to be sincere in his remarks regarding them.\u201d[3]\n\nMaeterlinck was f\u00eated with a Blue Bird for Happiness ball at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City, organized by Anne Harriman Vanderbilt. Everyone dressed as characters from Maeterlinck\u2019s plays; particularly vivid was a flock of society debutantes as blue birds. Mrs. Vanderbilt had spent the war in France, organizing support and relief through The American Hospital of Paris and various associations. She and her husband had lived just across the Seine from M\u00e9dan, in their chateau at Carri\u00e8res-sous-Poissy, while Maeterlinck spent the war in the south of France. He had volunteered at the start of the war for the Belgian Army, but at age 52, his service was declined.\n\nThe Blue Bird ball was covered in detail in The New York Times, the story dated December 27, 1919. \u201cWhile the ball stood as a message of happiness, the city, the first week of January, is to glow in blue. At the suggestion of Mrs. Vanderbilt, the Retail Dry Goods Association has recommended to all merchants to decorate their windows that week with suggestions of the Blue Bird,\u201d the reporter wrote.\n\nThe story itself is told in the form of a fairy tale, much along the lines of L. Frank Baum\u2019s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, published in 1900, nine years before The Blue Bird was first performed, in Moscow. Two children are set on a quest to find a blue bird, seeing through a special Diamond the world with souls come alive, in the Land of Memory, the Palace of Night, the Forest. The Diamond provides perception that ordinary people cannot see, a front-row seat in the struggle between good and evil. The children encounter false pleasures in The Luxuries, named as The Luxury of Being Rich, the Luxury of Knowing Nothing, the Luxury of Understanding Nothing, the Luxury of Doing Nothing, the Luxury of Satisfied Vanity, and, from the man who lived in castles, the Luxury of Being a Land Owner. When the Light is turned on them, these Luxuries are revealed as empty and ugly and rush off to hide in the Cave of Miseries. Symbolically, thus, happiness does not lie in material goods.\n\nThe children do not find the blue bird, but wake up and discover it was all a dream. A neighbor (who in the dream was the fairy Berylune) asks Tyltyl (the boy) to give his turtledove to her sick daughter, and as he finds happiness in giving it to her, the bird begins to appear blue. The next morning the girl comes to announce that she has been cured, she is well! Tyltyl reaches out to show her how the bird eats, and she instinctively pulls back, thinking he is going to take the bird. It flies away. Tyltyl addresses the audience: \u201cIf someone finds it, will you give it back? We will need it to be happy later...\u201d Curtain falls. Happiness lies in giving, not in keeping.\n\nAfter it opened on Broadway in 1910, The Blue Bird toured the United States, playing in Billings and Texarkana, Kalamazoo and Scranton, rivaling audience records held by Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin. The play\u2019s popularity was immediately echoed by a boom in marketing, from playing cards to paper napkins, whiskey to ladies\u2019 hats, all blue, all bird. It was made into a film for the first time in 1910 and then a dozen times over before the most recent version, by Gust van den Berghe in 2011.\n\nWhere did Maeterlinck find inspiration for The Blue Bird? Avian symbolism occurs in ancient civilizations east and west, but historians believe Maeterlinck may also have read 18th century philosopher Emmanuel Swedenborg on the issue. Swedenborg analyzed Biblical references to birds, matched them to their characteristics, and provided a symbolist primer. Dove is to peace as vulture is to death and eagle is to nobility. If a bird is an idea, it is quick, graceful and celestial. Just ask Twitter. Europe has few blue birds in nature. In the Americas, there is an Eastern, Western and Mountain blue thrush (Sialia genus), but it doesn\u2019t have a European counterpart. Nor does French culture have a symbolic blue bird of happiness, bien sur que non. Yet, while its national bird is the barnyard rooster (cross, bossy, vain), the seriousness with which France takes literature has brought it 14 Nobel prizes, more than any other nation, and that doesn\u2019t include Maeterlinck\u2019s award. In Europe in general, the literary bird par excellence is the nightingale.\n\nMaeterlinck and Ren\u00e9e moved on to New York City with the Nazi occuption of France in 1940. He arrived there a star in the literary firmament, interviewed by The New Yorker, announced by The New York Times. Customs officials let through the Pekingese lap dogs but confiscated two parakeets. \u201cPerhaps it is for the best. Blue birds are the symbol of happy times,\u201d he remarked.[4]\n\nMaeterlinck\u2019s shining moment of symbolism had been overtaken by a cruel and vicious realism. It was difficult to dress the suffering of France and Belgium under the Nazi occupation in metaphoric fairy tales. Nonetheless, he tried. He wrote a production of Jeanne d\u2019Arc that turned into a thinly disguised discussion of Marshal P\u00e9tain\u2019s situation, and then a play Les trois justiciers (The Three Justice-Givers), turning on corruption, choices, and redemption. His tools were those of the interior, of moral and personal spirituality interacting with the brutality of the outside world.\n\nHis poems, plays and stories have been set to music by masters from Debussy to Rachmaninoff, Schoenberg to Boulanger. In his Nobel award, the committee cited his works for \u201cthe richness of their fantasy and their fairy-tale form, a deep sense, all in calling out, in a mysterious manner, the imagination of the spectator himself.\u201d If anyone considers that fairy tales are no longer told, I would point to the spate of super-hero films as well as others of critical success such as The Shape of Water. Happily ever after has not lost its appeal.\n\nMaeterlinck fell ill during his stay in the United States and did not return to France until 1947, at the age of 85. He never returned to M\u00e9dan, but stayed at Orlamonde, gazing at the blue Mediterranean until his death two years later. In the 1960s, Ren\u00e9e sold off part of the M\u00e9dan land, rented the castle to a printer for awhile, and then it fell into abandon. The current owners purchased it in 1977 and brought it back to life. In 2007, a local theater group gathered 200 village volunteers to stage L\u2019Oiseau bleu (The Blue Bird), echoing a 1931 performance at the castle that starred Ren\u00e9e Maeterlinck. This one was held outdoors, at the foot of the castle ramparts, on what is today Ronsard Square. The village hall, where smaller events are held, is the Salle Maeterlinck. We go there for dances and dinners and the mayor\u2019s annual New Year\u2019s greeting. When my children were young, we decorated it for Halloween parties. For Saint Jean\u2019s eve, we have a big bonfire and village dinner. Part of the reason I\u2019m writing this is I can see our days in M\u00e9dan coming to a close, this time a city compromise for convenience. The kids are grown and gone, the house and garden are a lot of work. But it feels so keenly like letting the blue bird fly off. I hesitate, especially in the spring when the flowers bloom in symphony movements, first the plum trees, then the cherry, bring in the lilacs and let fall a touch of wisteria. It is a fine place to live and write.\n\nIn many of his works, Maeterlinck blurred past and present, life and death as interchangeable on a spiritual level. In The Blue Bird, the children go through the Land of Memory, where their deceased grandparents are awakened only when the living think of them. In his last book, a memoir of his childhood published in 1948, he said that in thinking of his past friends, he was bringing them back to life. \u201cSometimes I see them again in a very clear hallucination, they are always seated around a long table, but the table seems to be only a reflection in cloudy water,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDoes the forgetting pursue the memory or the memory pursue the forgetting?\u201d[5]\n\nDo we leave the past behind, or bring it with us into the future?\n\nOur memory of Maeterlinck has faded, but the glimmer of his ideas continues to resurface in unexpected places, in a hashtag shorthand for perfect snow and sky on Twitter, today\u2019s go-to blue bird, or somewhere over the rainbow. Maeterlinck gave us the bird, but happiness is for us to find.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Nicolas Maeterlinck, Maurice Maeterlinck.

He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1911 \"in appreciation of his many-sided literary activities, and especially of his dramatic works, which are distinguished by a wealth of imagination and by a poetic fancy, which reveals, sometimes in the guise of a fairy tale, a deep inspiration, while in a mysterious way they appeal to the readers' own feelings and stimulate their imaginations\". The main themes in his work are death and the meaning of life. His plays form an important part of the Symbolist movement.\n\nMaeterlinck instantly became a public figure when his first play, Princess Maleine, received enthusiastic praise from Octave Mirbeau, the literary critic of Le Figaro in August 1890. In the following years, he wrote a series of symbolist plays characterized by fatalism and mysticism, most importantly Intruder (1890), The Blind (1890) and Pell\u00daas and M\u00dalisande (1892).\n\n\n\nHe had a relationship with the singer and actress Georgette Leblanc from 1895 until 1918. Leblanc influenced his work for the following two decades. With the play Aglavaine and S\u00dalysette Maeterlinck began to create characters, especially female characters, more in control of their destinies. Leblanc performed these female characters on stage. Even though mysticism and metaphysics influenced his work throughout his career, he slowly replaced his Symbolism with a more existential style.\n\n\n\nIn 1895, with his parents frowning upon his open relationship with an actress, Maeterlinck and Leblanc moved to the district of Passy in Paris. The Catholic Church was unwilling to grant her a divorce from her Spanish husband. They frequently entertained guests, including Mirbeau, Jean Lorrain, and Paul Fort. They spent their summers in Normandy. During this period, Maeterlinck published his Twelve Songs (1896), The Treasure of the Humble (1896), The Life of the Bee (1901), and Ariadne and Bluebeard (1902).\n\n\n\nIn 1903, Maeterlinck received the Triennial Prize for Dramatic Literature from the Belgian government. During this period, and down to the Great War, he was widely looked up to, throughout Europe, as a great sage, and the embodiment of the higher thought of the time.\n\n\n\nIn 1906, Maeterlinck and Leblanc moved to a villa in Grasse. He spent his hours meditating and walking. As he emotionally pulled away from Leblanc, he entered a state of depression. Diagnosed with neurasthenia, he rented the Benedictine Abbey of St. Wandrille in Normandy to help him relax. By renting the abbey he rescued it from the desecration of being sold and used as a chemical factory and thus he received a blessing from the Pope. Leblanc would often walk around in the garb of an abbess; he would wear roller skates as he moved about the house. During this time, he wrote his essay \"The Intelligence of Flowers\" (1906), in which he expressed sympathy with socialist ideas. He donated money to many workers' unions and socialist groups. At this time he conceived his greatest contemporary success: the fairy play The Blue Bird (1908, but largely written in 1906). After the writing \"The Intelligence of Flowers\", he suffered from a period of depression and writer's block. Although he recovered from this after a year or two, he was never so inventive as a writer again. His later plays, such as Marie-Victoire (1907) and Mary Magdalene (1910), provided with lead roles for Leblanc, were notably inferior to their predecessors, and sometimes merely repeat an earlier formula. Leblanc, clearly, was no longer an inspiration to the playwright. Even though alfresco performances of some of his plays at St. Wandrille had been successful, Maeterlinck felt that he was losing his privacy. The death of his mother on 11 June 1910 added to his depression.\n\n\n\nIn 1910 he met the 18-year-old actress Ren\u00dae Dahon during a rehearsal of The Blue Bird. She became his lighthearted companion. After having been nominated by Carl Bildt, member of the Swedish Academy, he won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1911, which also served to lighten his spirits. By 1913, he was more openly socialist and sided with the Belgian trade unions against the Catholic party during a strike. He began to study mysticism and lambasted the Catholic Church in his essays for misconstruing the history of the universe. By a decree of 26 January 1914, his opera omnia were placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n\n\nWhen Germany invaded Belgium in 1914, Maeterlink wished to join the French Foreign Legion, but his application was denied due to his age. He and Leblanc decided to leave Grasse for a villa near Nice, where he spent the next decade of his life. He gave speeches on the bravery of the Belgian people and placed guilt upon all Germans for the war. Although his patriotism, and his indifference to the harm he was doing to his standing in Germany, do him credit, it severely damaged his reputation as a great sage who stood above current affairs. While in Nice he wrote The Mayor of Stilmonde, which was quickly labeled by the American press as a \"Great War Play\" and would be made into a British film in 1929. He also wrote The Betrothal, a sequel to The Blue Bird, in which the heroine of the play is clearly not a Leblanc archetype.\n\n\n\nOn 15 February 1919 Maeterlinck married Dahon. He accepted an invitation to the United States. Samuel Goldwyn asked him to produce a few scenarios for film. Only two of Maeterlinck's submissions still exist; Goldwyn didn't use any of them. Maeterlinck had prepared one based on his The Life of the Bee. After reading the first few pages Goldwyn burst out of his office, exclaiming: \"My God! The hero is a bee!\"\n\n\n\nAfter 1920 Maeterlinck ceased to contribute significantly to the theatre, but continued to produce essays on his favourite themes of occultism, ethics and natural history. The international demand for these fell off sharply after the early 1920s, but his sales in France remained substantial until the late 1930s. Dahon gave birth to a stillborn child in 1925."}, {"url": "https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/search?amode=start&author=Maeterlinck%2C%20Maurice", "page_content": "Online Books by\n\nMaurice Maeterlinck\n\n(Maeterlinck, Maurice, 1862-1949)\n\nOnline books about this author are available, as is a Wikipedia article.\n\n\n\nHelp with reading books -- Report a bad link -- Suggest a new listing\n\nAdditional books from the extended shelves:\n\nSee also what's at your library, or elsewhere.\n\nHelp with reading books -- Report a bad link -- Suggest a new listing\n\nHome -- Search -- New Listings -- Authors -- Titles -- Subjects -- Serials\n\nBooks -- News -- Features -- Archives -- The Inside Story\n\nEdited by John Mark Ockerbloom (onlinebooks@pobox.upenn.edu)\n\nOBP copyrights and licenses."}, {"url": "https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/de-gruyter/light-and-symbol-in-maurice-maeterlincks-loiseau-bleu-09jdGVfKit", "page_content": "Abstract\n\nSUSAN PETRILLI Light personi\u00aeed plays a central role in L'Oiseau bleu, fe\u00c2erie en six actes et douze tableaux, a play of 1909 by Maurice Maeterlinck (1862\u00b11949), staged for the \u00aerst time in the Artistic Theatre in Moscow on 30th \u00c2 \u00c3 \u00c2 September 1908, and in Paris on 2nd March 1911 in the Theatre Rejane.1 Light helps the two child protagonists Tyltyl and Mytyl in their search for the Blue Bird whom they never \u00aend.

His grandfather, Charles Hugo was a journalist, pioneer of early photographic techniques and a campaigner against the death penalty, and his father Georges Hugo was a published author and a recognised painter.\n\n\n\nHis mother, Pauline M\u00e9nard-Dorian, was the daughter of Paul-Fran\u00e7ois M\u00e9nard, conseiller g\u00e9n\u00e9ral and d\u00e9put\u00e9 of the H\u00e9rault department during the 1870s\u201380s, by his wife Aline Dorian, daughter of Pierre Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dorian, minister of works during the siege of Paris.\n\n\n\nJean Hugo was married twice, first in 1919 to Valentine Hugo (n\u00e9e Valentine Gross, no children from this marriage) and then in 1949 to Lauretta Hope-Nicholson, daughter of Hedley Hope-Nicholson.

The customary banquet speech was instead delivered by a Belgian dignitary who described the laureate in these words: \"Tall, robust, of athletic appearance, with a full face and a dull complexion, easily excited, always bareheaded, he hardly gives the impression of a dreamer, poet, or philosopher. For those who know him well, he is a thinker and a shy man who reveals himself only to his friends.\" It is somehow fitting that Maeterlinck should be absent from this most venerable celebration of his literary achievement: the personal characteristics of this elusive and mysterious figure--\"the least understood of all the Nobel Prize-winners,\" according to Rupert Hughes--seem to be mirrored in his symbolist theater that tries, through suggestion and allusion, to represent the invisible and communicate the ineffable. One could say that Maeterlinck's theater turns the notion of \"absence\" into an aesthetic principle.\n\nA Belgian of Flemish descent who wrote in French and spent most of his life in France, Maeterlinck had a powerful effect on the theatrical world of the late nineteenth century and on the abstract and minimalist experiments in theater that dominate much twentieth-century drama, for example, the Theater of the Absurd. In a prolific career that extended into the ninth decade of his life, he published twenty-eight plays, two collections of poetry, two short stories, many volumes of popularizing essays on philosophical, occult, and scientific subjects, and an autobiography. But literary historians generally agree that his most innovative and influential works were the plays that he wrote in the 1890s and early 1900s. In 1891 Paul Fort's avant-garde Th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'Art produced L'Intruse (1891; translated as The Intruder, 1891) and Les Aveugles (1891; translated as Blind, 1891). Aur\u00e9lien-Fran\u00e7ois Lugn\u00e9-Po\u00eb's troupe staged Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (1893; translated as Pell\u00e9as and M\u00e9lisande, 1894) and Int\u00e9rieur (1895; translated as Interior, 1911). Maeterlinck's plays were, in fact, among the few French texts that suited the avant-garde repertory of these theaters.\n\nIn 1908 the production of Maeterlinck's L'Oiseau bleu (translated as The Blue Bird: A Fairy Play in Five Acts, 1909) at the Moscow Art Theater was a milestone in the development of symbolist and avant-garde theater in Russia. Indeed, Maeterlinck's early plays were especially influential outside France and formed an integral part of the repertory of the Russian director Vsevolod Meyerhold and the German director Max Reinhardt. The early dramas of Anton Chekhov, as well as the plays of William Butler Yeats and the late plays of August Strindberg, all draw on and develop aspects of Maeterlinck's early work.\n\nBut Maeterlinck's early plays represent only a small part of his creative output, which grew increasingly remote from any kind of avant-garde art. Always a solitary figure, Maeterlinck withdrew in his later years to a series of country estates, settling at last into Orlamonde, his palatial residence on the French Riviera that he decorated in art nouveau style and where he played the roles of the country gentleman and reclusive man of letters. Although he continued to write plays after World War I, Maeterlinck was best known in the last four decades of his life for his essays and his courtly lifestyle.\n\nMauritius Polydorus Maria Bernhardus Maeterlinck was born in Ghent, Belgium, on 29 August 1862. His parents were Polydore Maeterlinck, a prosperous retired notary, and Mathilde Colette Fran\u00e7oise Van den Bossche, the daughter of a lawyer. The family was bilingual and divided its time between a town house in Ghent and a country estate at Oostacker, where Maeterlinck's father raised bees and devoted himself to gardening. Maeterlinck was educated at a convent school, the private Institut Central in Ghent, and the Jesuit Coll\u00e8ge Sainte-Barbe, where he met and became friends with the future poet Charles Van Lerberghe. From 1881 to 1885 Maeterlinck studied law at the University of Ghent. At the successful completion of his law studies the young man persuaded his father to send him to Paris for several months, ostensibly to study French law, but Maeterlinck spent his time there in literary circles, meeting writers such as Saint-Pol-Roux, Catulle Mend\u00e8s, St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, and, most importantly, Jean-Marie Mathias Philippe-Auguste, Comte de Villiers de l'Isle-Adam. Returning to Ghent, Maeterlinck practiced law until 1889, \"failing brilliantly,\" in the words of his first biographer, Gerard Harry.\n\nDuring these years, however, the young writer saw the first publication of his work: in 1886 La Pl\u00e9iade published his short story \"Le Massacre des innocents\" (translated as The Massacre of the Innocents, 1914), and in 1887 twelve of his poems appeared in Le Parnasse de la jeune Belgique. In 1889 Maeterlinck published his translation of Jan van Ruysbroeck's fourteenth-century mystical treatise, Adornment of Spiritual Marriage, in La Revue g\u00e9n\u00e9rale; a volume of poetry, Serres chaudes; and a play, La Princesse Maleine, at his own expense.\n\nExcept for La Princesse Maleine, Maeterlinck's early works were unnoticed by the critics. When, however, Maeterlinck sent a copy of La Princesse Maleine to Mallarm\u00e9, the influential poet, much impressed, gave the play to Octave Mirbeau. On 24 August 1890 Mirbeau published a highly enthusiastic review of the play in Le Figaro, thereby launching Maeterlinck's career as a playwright and man of letters. During the next five years Maeterlinck wrote the plays for which he is best known in literary and theatrical history. La Princesse Maleine was followed by L'Intruse, Les Aveugles, Les Sept Princesses (1891; translated as The Seven Princesses, 1909), Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande, Alladine et Palomides (1894; translated as Alladine and Palomides, 1911), Int\u00e9rieur, and La Mort de Tintagiles (1894; translated as The Death of Tintagiles, 1911).\n\nIn the 1890 review that brought La Princesse Maleine and its author to the attention of the literary world, Mirbeau celebrated Maeterlinck's play by comparing it to the work of William Shakespeare. In fact, Maeterlinck's play has more in common with the symbolist interpretations of Shakespeare, such as are found in Mallarm\u00e9's Igitur (1869), than it does with Shakespeare's work. Set in a northern kingdom in an unspecified feudal past, the five acts of La Princesse Maleine present the events that lead to the death of the innocent young princess of the title, who is ultimately killed by the evil and powerful Danish queen, Anne. In the first act Queen Anne has seduced the feeble old king of the land, Hjalmar, and is determined to marry her daughter, Uglyane, to the young prince, also called Hjalmar. But Anne must first get rid of the young prince's betrothed, Maleine. Early in the play Maleine escapes from the tower in which she has been imprisoned; later, however, she is recaptured and imprisoned again; finally, in the last act, she is strangled by Anne.\n\nThe vague northern setting of the play and the plight of the young prince recall Shakespeare's Hamlet (1603) in general terms: certainly young Hjalmar's family is as dysfunctional, and his kingdom in as much chaos, as are Hamlet's. Several crowd scenes provide a glimpse of disorder outside the castle. Young Hjalmar, too, dies at the end of the play; but he dies by his own hand when he discovers the corpse of Maleine, whose death has been caused by Anne, not by his words or actions. Hjalmar's father is still alive at the end of the play, a symbol, perhaps, of a decadent order unable to renew itself. Unlike Gertrude, his Danish consort is purely evil. La Princesse Maleine shifts the focus of the Hamlet legend away from the young male heir and to the women of the castle: what ensues is a struggle between the acquiescent victim, Maleine, and an active and intelligent queen consort who is demonized.\n\nThis struggle has at least two dimensions. Like the two Hjalmars, Anne and Maleine seem in some respects doubles, but in the world of Hjalmar's castle they are necessarily at odds with each other. The doubling in the play suggests a psychological allegory in which different aspects of the self cannot be reconciled. At the same time, however, the action of the play suggests the acknowledgment and the deploring of the emergence of women as powerful agents in politics and culture: murder, even if it targets the weak and helpless rather than the principal offenders, seems to be the solution to cultural decadence and the decline of male authority proposed here.\n\nIn its representation of the power-hungry and murderous Queen Anne, La Princesse Maleine also draws on Macbeth (1606), which Maeterlinck translated in 1910. But perhaps the most important echoes in the play are of the unperformable dramas of Mallarm\u00e9. The beautiful princess in the tower at the beginning of the play recalls Mallarm\u00e9's virginal H\u00e9rodiade in his fragment by that name. And Maeterlinck's highly psychological and vague treatment of the Hamlet theme also suggests Mallarme's Igitur, which transforms the Hamlet theme into a single soliloquy and a drama of consciousness confronting nothingness. Maeterlinck's first readers hailed the play because it seemed to represent a performable version of symbolist theater. The play, however, was not performed in the 1890s. Fort tried to get permission to stage it at his Th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'Art, but Maeterlinck refused, ostensibly because he preferred to give it to Andr\u00e9 Antoine, who may have flirted with the idea of putting it on but recognized in the end that La Princesse Maleine was fundamentally at odds with the naturalist aesthetic of his theater and its repertory.\n\nThis opposition to naturalism is evident in several ways. The action of the play takes place in an unspecified place and time, and the characters, unlike the realistic individuals on the naturalist stage, are archetypal figures such as those in a fairy tale. Moreover, the play ascribes supernatural powers to the natural world. In the opening scene, the guards outside the castle observe a comet followed by a shower of falling stars, an omen, they say, that a princess will die. Several other natural elements seem to foreshadow Maleine's demise. Most significant is the scene in the park (act 2, scene 6) where Prince Hjalmar and Maleine are reunited. At the moment of their embrace, a wind blows, and the lovers are sprayed by water from a nearby fountain; the erotic overtones of the symbolism are unmistakable. Then, when Prince Hjalmar expresses his joy to Maleine, the fountain makes a sound as though it were weeping and then \"dies\"--a clear, perhaps even heavy-handed, announcement of their ill-fated love. Throughout the play, the forces of nature \"explain\" what the human characters cannot.\n\nMaeterlinck's first produced play was his next, L'Intruse , which opened in Paris on 21 May 1891 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'Art. With a subject matter quite different from that of La Princesse Maleine, its single act takes place in a \"dark room in a rather old castle,\" where members of a family have gathered. As the play opens, a child has just been born, and the mother is apparently recovering in a room offstage. Only the blind Grandfather, waiting with the other family members, fears the worst; but at the end of the play his fears are confirmed. Silently, the nun who has been tending the new mother appears in the doorway. The old blind man has been able to sense what the others have not. L'Intruse represents the first of Maeterlinck's celebrated and revolutionary drames statiques (static dramas), relatively plotless works in which a small group of characters focus on a metaphysical or psychological presence that cannot be represented in visible terms.\n\nIn L'Intruse, the invisible presence is the fatal illness that will take the young mother's life. Though unseen, it is made palpable through dialogue and other dramatic effects (such as the sound of a scythe being sharpened offstage--a less-than-subtle allusion to the Grim Reaper). The invisible malady almost seems to take a place on stage alongside the other characters, an idea corroborated by the Uncle's comment: \"Once an illness has entered a home, you could say that there is a stranger in the family.\" The deadly illness is, in fact, the \"intruder\" named in the title of the play.\n\nMore than death itself, it is the arrival or the anticipation of death that is the main focus of the play. Maeterlinck uses a technique similar to that later used by Samuel Beckett to make his spectator feel the anxiety associated with ominous waiting. Consider, for example, this exchange between the Uncle and the Grandfather concerning the impending visit from the ailing mother's older sister. Uncle: \"What will we do while waiting?\" Grandfather: \"While waiting for what?\" Uncle: \"While waiting for our sister?\" The older sister, who, moreover, is a nun, never arrives onstage in person. But her character is to some extent conflated with the Sister of Charity who appears at the end to announce the mother's death. In other words, the discussion of the family's real sister, and anticipation of her arrival, is a metaphorical foreshadowing of the arrival of death.\n\nThough the Grandfather's failure to remember for whom or what they are waiting seems ridiculous, perhaps even absurdly Beckettian, given that the sister's visit has been an ongoing topic of conversation, the play does not on the whole make light of the Grandfather's senility or frailty. On the contrary, the Grandfather has a prescience about his daughter's condition that the other family members lack. He says at one point: \"There are times when I am less blind than you.\" The Grandfather embodies those qualities that Maeterlinck extols in much of his theater, poetry, and prose: the ability to perceive that which is imperceptible by the senses and to apprehend that which defies rational understanding.\n\nMaeterlinck's third play, Les Aveugles , also premiered at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'Art, where it opened on 7 December 1891. In this play all the characters are blind, thereby emphasizing to an even greater degree than L'Intruse the evocation onstage of invisible forces. The characters in Les Aveugles are a group of blind patients who wander in the woods to which they have been taken on an outing by a priest; as they talk, it becomes clear that they are unaware that the priest has quietly died during the outing; it is also clear that there is a storm approaching. The play ends with the patients wandering and lost. The representation of vision and its absence in this short work is given an ironic twist since the play harks back to sixteenth-century paintings and engravings, especially to Pieter Brueghel the Elder's The Parable of the Blind, in which blind people lead other blind people. In Les Aveugles, in contrast to L'Intruse, the blind flail about rather than merely listen for intimations of mortality. This work is not the first time that Maeterlinck turned to Flemish painting for the subject of a literary piece. His early prose piece, \"Le Massacre des innocents,\" is a literary transposition of the Brueghel painting by the same name.\n\nLes Aveugles, like L'Intruse, is also a study in the approach of death. However, whereas in L'Intruse, death arrives or \"makes an entrance,\" in Les Aveugles, death is already present onstage from the start in the person of the dead priest. According to the stage directions, when the curtain rises, the \"mortally immobile,\" white-haired spiritual leader, wrapped in a large black coat, is leaning against a tree trunk at the rear of the stage: like a wax figure, \"his mute and frozen eyes no longer look at the visible side of eternity.\" The rest of the characters are all blind, lost in this vague septentrional forest where they await the return of their leader, the priest. Slowly, through dialogue and by exploring their environment with their hands, they discover that their leader is dead. This play is a masterful depiction of existentialism: the congregants are adrift in a post-Nietzschean world devoid of spiritual guidance. In a comment that summarizes their condition, one of the characters remarks: \"We live together, we are always together, but we don't know what we are!\" The characters have no individual identity: their self-knowledge depends upon dialogue with others. \"I'm afraid when I don't talk,\" says one of them. Indeed, talking is the principal guarantor of their existence.\n\nOn the occasion of the first performance of this play at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'Art, the director, Adolphe Rett\u00e9, cast the stage in a dark bluish penumbra in order to create an ambiance of mystery and indeterminateness consistent with Maeterlinck's text. Some critics, however, complained that they could not see the stage or hear the actors, who spoke in soft, monotonous tones.\n\nIn the single act of Maeterlinck's Les Sept Princesses an aging king and queen live in an isolated and chilly castle with seven sleeping princesses. Outside, a crowd is about to embark on an ocean voyage. Through the windows come their shouts of jubilation. The long-awaited prince arrives to claim one of the princesses, but although he manages to awaken six of the seven frail and languorous young women, one of them has died as he and the royal couple have stood discussing them. She is, of course, the one who had most attracted him. The play ends with the old queen's lamentations and the group's discovery that all doors and windows of the castle are locked. Les Sept Princesses turns back to and reworks familiar motifs from folktales and fairy tales. The plight of the princesses echoes that of Snow White, as well as many other royal children who have fallen under an evil spell and must be rescued. The allusion to the swans outside the castle at the beginning of the play suggests the princesses' association with the beautiful birds that, particularly in late-nineteenth-century European culture, were associated with sexuality, death, and transcendence. In Maeterlinck's early plays the possibility of a physical or sexual awakening inevitably leads to death.\n\nMaeterlinck's fourth play, Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande , first performed at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Bouffes-Parisiens on 16 May 1893, is also his best known in large part because of Claude Debussy's 1902 musical adaptation. To this day, Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande remains one of the most representative masterpieces, a veritable cynosure, of symbolist drama. The ethereal play also turns to fairy tales for its subject; but its evocation of a vaguely northern kingdom ruled by an aging and ineffectual king also recalls La Princesse Maleine. Here, as well, a young and innocent princess must die, as well as her beloved, whose death she also helps bring about. The plot is simple. Golaud, the middle-aged son of the aging King Arkel, who reigns over a vaguely Germanic kingdom called Allemonde, comes across beautiful M\u00e9lisande sitting by a fountain in a forest. She has lost her crown. He finds it for her and proposes marriage. Back in the castle, Melisande finds his younger half brother, Pell\u00e9as, more attractive. When she meets Pell\u00e9as in the forest, Golaud, now her husband, comes upon them and stabs Pell\u00e9as. In the fifth act M\u00e9lisande gives birth to a girl, but she dies, unable to accept motherhood or to answer Golaud's questions concerning the nature of her love for Pell\u00e9as. But where La Princesse Maleine drew generally on the plots of Hamlet and Macbeth, Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande is a vague distillation of the plots of many folktales and fairy tales. Settings and characters alike are emptied of all individuality; what is left is longing.\n\nThough both Pell\u00e9as and M\u00e9lisande die in the end, the play does not belong to Maeterlinck's \"death dramas.\" In fact, the playwright, eager to shed the reputation of being a \"poet of terror,\" wanted this play to mark a break with his previous work. He referred to Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande as a \"drama of passion.\" Indeed, this relatively actionless play concerns above all the gradual development of the protagonists' moods as they slowly come to discover their mutual love.\n\nThe symbolist element of the play comes through most clearly in the way the characters express sentiments that they, themselves, ignore. For example, in a famous scene in act 2, M\u00e9lisande, playing with her wedding band, lets it accidentally fall into the fountain. Maeterlinck's reader or spectator understands immediately that what seems to M\u00e9lisande and Pell\u00e9as to be an accident is actually a fateful sign of what will become of M\u00e9lisande's marriage to Golaud. Throughout the scene, the spectator perceives the love growing between M\u00e9lisande and Pell\u00e9as before they themselves do. There are many such moments in the play when sentiment is only subtly suggested and never overtly expressed. This delicate use of suggestion and allusion is perhaps what prompted Mallarm\u00e9 to observe that the use of silence and abstraction in the play gave it a kind of musical quality. So inherently musical was Maeterlinck's text, said Mallarm\u00e9, that any actual musical accompaniment would in fact be superfluous and detrimental. Yet, it may be Debussy's operatic adaptation that has guaranteed Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande a permanent place in literary history.\n\nMaeterlinck's next three plays were published together in 1894 as \"trois petits drames pour marionnettes\" (three little dramas for marionettes). As Maeterlinck himself admitted, the first, Alladine et Palomides, represents little more than a reworking of Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande. The second, Int\u00e9rieur , also turns back to an earlier work but brilliantly transcends its model. Int\u00e9rieur, like L'Intruse, presents the dilemma of a family forced to confront the death of one of its members. Here, however, they are seen from the outside, through the windows of their home, as a procession approaches in the foreground, led by an old man who knows of the death by drowning of a daughter. The crowd debates how to break the news. Finally, the old man enters the household and informs the family. Their reactions, seen through the windows of their house, are mimed only. The audience hears no words. Int\u00e9rieur offers a stunning example of a self-conscious representation of the symbolic setting of turn-of-the-century theater, representing a split stage, an interior within the interior, as well as a representation within the representation. Here, as in other early plays by Maeterlinck, some characters inhabit an isolated structure threatened by forces that come from outside. But in this play the threat is given concrete representation in the form of the old man and his followers, who also participate in the catastrophe. The two settings, one incorporating darkness and language, the other light and silence, suggest a third, ineffable presence.\n\nLa Mort de Tintagiles , the last of the three dramas, is also the sparest. Its four acts are extremely short, evoking in impressionistic fashion moments in the decline of a boy, Tintagiles, and his family, who are represented here by his two sisters, Ygraine and Bellang\u00e8re, and his aged father, who like the old king of La Princesse Maleine has become involved with a powerful queen anxious to do away with the children of his first marriage. In this play, however, the new queen's ascent to power and designs on the children are linked to political changes outside the castle: a crowd surges around its walls, anxious to participate in the change of regimes. By the end of the play Ygraine and Tintagiles have fled to a remote part of the castle, and Ygraine has managed to shut herself up in a fortified room. She succeeds so well that when Tintagiles also seeks refuge there, she cannot open the door to let him in. At the end of the play the audience hears him die, the victim of an invisible presence whose nature is ambiguous: death, the crowd, or the new queen herself.\n\nAlladine et Palomides, Int\u00e9rieur, and La Mort de Tintagiles marked the end of the first phase of Maeterlinck's theatrical production. At the beginning of 1895 he met Georgette Leblanc, who became his companion and collaborator and for whom he wrote a series of plays incorporating, but by no means entirely affirming, a feminist perspective. But less personal factors also played a role in Maeterlinck's turning to a different style of drama. Audiences noted a certain repetition in his plays, and symbolist works did not bring in the kind of revenues that sustained an independent theater. In 1897 Lugn\u00e9-Po\u00eb, whose Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Oeuvre had been the major venue for symbolist plays, turned to other kinds of theater, ostensibly because there were so few suitable French plays in this style. Maeterlinck's plays, moreover, were far more influential abroad than in France, where they were rarely staged in the 1890s.\n\nThe year 1895 marked a turning point in Maeterlinck's life and literary production. That year, following the five plays considered his most important works for the theater, he published his translations of The Disciples at Sais (1802) and Fragments (1802), both by the German Romantic writer Novalis. Maeterlinck's translations from Novalis were followed by essays on other writers and on philosophical, scientific, and theosophical subjects; he turned at this time to writing plays intended for Leblanc, plays that center on the presence of a strong \"new woman,\" whose sexuality, initiative, and frequent exhibitionism place her at odds with her surroundings. In 1897 he and Leblanc set up house in Paris, but they were often apart; from 1907 to 1914 they spent summers in the abandoned Benedictine abbey of Saint-Wandrille in Normandy. Plays such as Aglavaine et S\u00e9lysette (1896; translated as Agalaine and S\u00e9lysette, 1897), Monna Vanna (1902; translated, 1903), and Ariane et Barbe-bleue (1907, Ariane and Bluebeard) point to an obvious collaboration between the playwright and the actress, and Leblanc claimed to have contributed to the essays Maeterlinck published during this period, as well.\n\nThe last play he wrote specifically for her to perform was Marie Magdaleine (1913), begun in 1908, but the culmination of their theatrical collaboration was the single performance of his translation of Shakespeare's Macbeth at Saint-Wandrille in 1909. Leblanc apparently hoped to turn Saint-Wandrille into a French version of Richard Wagner's Bayreuth in Germany. The following summer, there was a well-received production of Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande at the same location, but Maeterlinck's objections to having his privacy disturbed by rehearsals stopped plans to stage Hamlet and La Princesse Maleine there.\n\nIn 1896 Maeterlinck moved from his native Belgium to France and published two works, each of which marked a new departure in his authorship. Le Tr\u00e9sor des humbles (1896; translated as The Treasure of the Humble, 1897), which includes essays on Novalis, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Ruysbroeck as well as on the aesthetics of the theater, was the first of what became his many volumes of popularizing prose. Le Tr\u00e9sor des humbles includes one of the playwright's most influential essays, \"Le tragique quotidien\" (The Tragic in Everyday Life), a statement of the aesthetics informing his dramas of the 1890s. As the title indicates, Maeterlinck conceives of a kind of tragic theater that would move away from the representation of grand tragic actions such as battles between enemies, struggles of passion, or stories of vengeance. Maeterlinck is interested in the possibility of representing those subtle, indeterminate, barely perceptible aspects of ordinary existence that do not lend themselves to dramatic representation. He wants to show \"what is astonishing in the simple fact of living\" or to depict the \"ordinary\" person (as opposed to a classic tragic hero) in dialogue with larger questions of truth, beauty, and God. Such a theater, writes Maeterlinck, would involve revealing \"a thousand things of the sort that the tragic poets have only let us glimpse at in passing. Could these not be shown before all else?\"\n\nMaeterlinck is critical of tragedians who insist in their works on sensational scenes of violence while \"most of us pass our lives far from blood, screams and swords and whereas man's tears have become silent, invisible and almost spiritual.\" What can one learn, he asks, from beings who have only one obsession and who have no time to live because they must kill a rival or a mistress? Maeterlinck prefers drama that explores the mysteries of his humble, ordinary life--its beauty, its grandeur, and its gravity, which he himself may not be able to observe on a daily basis. Maeterlinck famously illustrates this notion of everyday mystical experience through the image of an old man seated in an armchair who listens, albeit unwittingly, to all of the \"eternal laws\" pervading his home. For Maeterlinck, this \"immobile old man actually lives a more profound life, more human and more general, than the lover who strangles his mistress, or the captain victorious in battle or the husband who avenges his honor.\"\n\nTraditional theater, Maeterlinck argues, focuses too much on events and superficial dialogue, evoking an atavistic world in which violence predominated. Modern theater, in contrast, should emphasize the spiritual dimension of human existence:\n\nIl ne s'agit plus ici de la lutte d\u00e9termin\u00e9e d'un \u00eatre contre un \u00e9tre, de la lutte d'un d\u00e9sir contre un autre d\u00e9sir ou de l'\u00e9ternel combat de la passion et du devoir. Il s'agirait plut\u00f4t de faire voir ce qu'il y a d'\u00e9tonnant dans le fait seul de vivre. Il ssagirait plut\u00f4t de faire voir l'existence d'une \u00e2me en elle-m\u00eame, au milieu d'une immensit\u00e9 qui n'est jamais inactive.\n\n(It goes beyond the determined struggle of man against man, and desire against desire: it goes beyond the eternal conflict of duty and passion. Its province is rather to reveal to us how truly wonderful is the mere act of living, and to throw light upon the existence of the soul, self-contained in the midst of ever-restless immensities.)\n\nThis aesthetic has much in common with the evocative poetics of symbolist poetry; however, it also points the way to a reinterpretation of dramatic tradition. In this view Shakespeare and ancient Greek tragedy appear as important ancestors of le tragique quotidien, but it is Henrik Ibsen who, in his late dramas, emerges as the first truly modern dramatist. Concerning The Master Builder (1892) Maeterlinck writes: \"Hilde et Solness sont, je pense, les premiers h\u00e9ros qui se sentent vivre un instant dans l'atmosph\u00e8re de l'\u00e2me, et cette vie essentielle qui'ils ont d\u00e9couverte en eux, par del\u00e0 la vie ordinaire, les \u00e9pouvante\" (Hilda and Solness are, I believe, the first characters in drama who feel, for an instant, that they are living in the atmosphere of the soul; and the discovery of this essential life that exists in them, beyond the life of every day, comes fraught with terror). The dialogue of this drame somnambulique (somnambulistic drama) leaves what is most important unsaid.\n\nIn \"Le tragique quotidien,\" Maeterlinck also introduces the notion of \"static theater,\" that is, a theater of inaction, relative plotlessness, and suspense, qualities evident in his early plays. As Patrick McGuinness has observed, \"static theater\" is above all a theater of waiting. Long before Beckett's En attendant Godot (1952, translated as Waiting for Godot, 1954), Maeterlinck understood and experimented with the kinds of dramatic suspense and even terror that could be produced in a theater in which characters were faced with the awful prospect of waiting. Though they are ultimately waiting for death to arrive, the emphasis in Maeterlinck's static theater is on the act of waiting itself, the confrontation with the double menace of anxiety and boredom as, once again, witnessed in the Uncle's apprehensive comment in L'Intruse: \"What will we do while waiting?\"\n\nThe last important concept developed in \"Le tragique quotidien\" is that of \"second degree dialogue\" or \"useless dialogue.\" Maeterlinck argues that the typical explanatory and demonstrative dialogue in a play is of little interest. The \"soul\" of the work is located in the superfluous talking that reveals feelings and moods of which even the characters speaking are unaware. Yet, he regards this indirect and often incongruous language as something with which people are familiar. Humans are all faced in their daily lives with the problem of using words to make sense of difficult situations, and they are all aware, argues Maeterlinck, that what they say in such situations may not be what is most important. There are other hidden forces and other words that go unheard that nevertheless determine every situation. With this notion of language, Maeterlinck seems to be a harbinger of later twentieth-century ideas regarding the autonomy of language and its unstable relationship to intended meaning.\n\nAglavaine et S\u00e9lysette , Maeterlinck's other important work in 1896, was his first play to incorporate a strong female lead--one who could be played by the playwright's companion, Leblanc. In fact, the inclusion of such roles distinguishes most of the plays Maeterlinck published between 1896 and 1913. Aglavaine et S\u00e9lysette, Ariane et Barbe-bleue, Soeur B\u00e9atrice (1910), Monna Vanna, Joyzelle (1903; translated, 1906), and Marie Magdaleine all revolve around a central character who resembles Leblanc's image of herself as a new woman proud of her sexuality and not afraid to flout conventions, especially those surrounding marriage. In her memoirs the actress emphasizes her role as collaborator in all of Maeterlinck's writing while they were together. The plays certainly bear witness to her influence; however, Maeterlinck was never a feminist and seems never to have taken this first extended relationship seriously.\n\nAglavaine et S\u00e9lysette recalls Ibsen's Rosmersholm (1886). In both plays a rival uses the power of suggestion to lead the wife of the household to commit suicide. In Maeterlinck's play, however, the new woman (and future wife) is older, and if the husband and outsider lament the suicide of the young S\u00e9lysette, Aglavaine et S\u00e9lysette nevertheless suggests the inevitability and desirability of their relationship in a way that is foreign to Ibsen's ambiguous and complex presentation of the situation of Rosmer and Rebecca West. As in Maeterlinck's early plays, in Aglavaine et S\u00e9lysette a powerful and sexually attractive older woman is responsible for the death of a virginal younger one, but here the emphasis has shifted. In Maeterlinck's production as a whole, this play seems to represent a transitional piece that bids farewell to the pale virgins of his first dramas by having one give way to the sexual and maternal older woman. Yet, as in the early plays, female strength is still allied with murder.\n\nMaeterlinck's Joyzelle , another play written for Leblanc, echoes Shakespeare's The Tempest (1611). Together with his magical assistant, Ariel, Merlin inhabits an island, on the shores of which a young man, Lanceor, and a young woman, Joyzelle, meet. Both have been promised in marriage to partners they shun. Merlin appears and tests their love, but the two young lovers prevail. The old ruler/magician turns out to be the father of Lanceor, and at the end of the play the three affirm their intention to live together on the island as a new family. The play premiered at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Gymnase on 20 May 1903 but was a failure. French critics were becoming increasingly critical of Maeterlinck's plays. Another play in 1903 was Le Miracle de Saint-Antoine, first performed at Geneva and Brussels. It describes an unlikely miracle that takes place in a town in the Netherlands and is Maeterlinck's only comedy.\n\nIn Ariane et Barbe-bleue the central character sets out to rescue the imprisoned wives of Bluebeard, making speeches along the way on the importance of feminine solidarity and freedom, only to be undermined at the end by the wives' refusal to leave: feminine autonomy, it seems, pales in contrast to the cruel charms of the strong male. Interestingly, the wives all bear names from previous plays by Maeterlinck: S\u00e9lysette, M\u00e9lisande, Ygraine, Bellang\u00e8re, and Alladine. In Soeur B\u00e9atrice the central character takes on the shape of a statue of the Virgin Mary and also leaves the convent for a lifetime of sin. In the end, however, her choice is affirmed: she returns to the convent, and the statue appears as it had before she left. The other nuns, now quite old, mourn her as a saint.\n\nMonna Vanna was probably the most successful of the plays written for Leblanc. This play transposes the theme of Judith and Holofernes to Renaissance Italy. Prinzivalle, captain of the Florentine army surrounding the city of Pisa, promises to lift the siege if Guido Colonna, the commander of the Pisan garrison, sends his wife to him, naked under her cloak. After discussing the issue with her father-in-law, Giovanna Colonna goes to Prinzivalle's tent, but this Renaissance Judith is never faced with the choice between submitting to the unwanted sexual advances of a barbarian invader or committing murder. It turns out that Prinzivalle knew her when they were children. He saw her sitting, M\u00e9lisande-like, by a fountain but never dared to declare his feelings since he was of humble origins. Nothing transpires but their conversation and a chaste kiss on Giovanna's forehead, but she realizes she has never really loved her husband and resolves to help Prinzivalle escape from his enemies, who now surround his encampment. Returning to Pisa, Giovanna proclaims herself untouched, but when her jealous husband refuses to believe her and proposes to kill Prinzivalle, she reverses herself, lying that he raped her, but demanding the key to his prison. The play ends with her words: \"C'\u00e9tait un mauvais r\u00eave. . . . Le beau va commencer . . . Le beau va commencer. . . .\" (It was a bad dream. . . . The beautiful is going to begin . . . The beautiful is going to begin. . . .).\n\nAs George Bernard Shaw pointed out, the central scenes of the play, in which the threat of rape and dishonor gives way to Giovanna's recognition that the man who has lured her there is a childhood friend and a decent person, have a false ring about them. But the play is an interesting dramatization not only of feminist ideals of heroism, according to which the courageous woman learns that she has nothing to fear from sexuality but everything from convention, but of the male reception of such notions. Two threats are deflected here: rape and beheading/castration. But the reference to the dream at the end of the play calls into question the effectiveness of Giovanna's or Prinzivalle's actions.\n\nIn 1907 Maeterlinck wrote L'Oiseau bleu , one of his best-known plays and, with Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande, his most often performed. According to Leblanc, the play was first commissioned as a Christmas piece. It premiered at the Moscow Art Theater in 1908 in a production directed by the renowned Russian director Konstantin Stanislavsky. Three years later Leblanc, who had studied the Russian production, produced the work in Paris.\n\nSet in a poor woodcutter's cottage, L'Oiseau bleu is an allegory that follows two children, Tyltyl and his sister Mytyl, on their dream quest for the bluebird of happiness. On the way they visit a fairy's palace; the land of memory, where the dead live on; the palace of the night, where sleep and death coexist; a dark forest in which plants and animals talk to them; and the land of the light, where the souls of the unborn await their entry into human life. The bluebird has much in common with the blue flower Novalis had written about in Heinrich von Ofterdingen (1802), and the dream-adventure plot recalls J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan (1904), to which Maeterlinck acknowledged his debt. But the pirates of the English work give way in Maeterlinck's play to symbolic figures that suggest a neoplatonic allegory with young protagonists.\n\nIn fact, L'Oiseau bleu is an unusually lighthearted and light-handed example of the station drama, in which a character wanders through the world in search of identity, understanding, or happiness. Its cheerfulness stands in stark contrast to the mostly gloomy Scandinavian and German examples in this genre: Strindberg's A Dream Play (1901), for example, or the plays of the German Expressionists. What they share, however, is a belief that the phenomena of everyday experience are meaningful and point beyond themselves. In 1918 an English version of a sequel to L'Oiseau bleu was performed at the Schubert Theater in New York. Here Tyltyl has become an adolescent, and his fairy-mentor leads him on a second quest for love.\n\nIn 1911 Maeterlinck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. Other official honors followed: the Belgian government sponsored an official \"Festival Maeterlinck\" and presented the writer with the insignia of Grand Officier de l'Ordre de L\u00e9opold. In 1913, however, Maeterlinck's essay La Mort (first published in English as Death, 1911) was placed on the Catholic Church's Index of Prohibited Books. In response he quipped that his publisher would be delighted at this \"prehistoric phenomenon of no importance\" although elsewhere he complained, incorrectly, that he had been excommunicated for no real reason.\n\nIn 1913 Maeterlinck wrote Marie Magdaleine, his last play for Leblanc. This play, like the others written for the actress, represents a woman whose strength lies in her unconventional sexuality. The heroine of Marie Magdaleine, however, makes a distinction between sexuality and love, refusing to sleep with the Roman who loves her devotedly and instead falling passionately in love with Jesus. Because of its unorthodox treatment of biblical material, the play was censored in Britain and first produced at the Casino Municipal at Nice in 1913.\n\nDuring World War I Maeterlinck wrote several propagandistic pieces, including Le Bourgmestre de Stilemonde (1918; translated as The Burgomaster of Stilemonde, 1918). In this play a brutal German officer demands the death of a citizen of a Belgian town for a minor offense. The work is remarkable principally for the anti-German sentiments that later served as a pretext for Maeterlinck's immigration to the United States.\n\nIn 1919 Maeterlinck married Ren\u00e9e Dahon, a young woman whom he had met at a rehearsal of the French production of L'Oiseau bleu in 1911 and to whom he dedicated Les Fian\u00e7ailles (translated as The Betrothal , 1919), a 1918 sequel to L'Oiseau bleu. In Les Fian\u00e7ailles one of the woodcutter's children, now a young man, goes off in search of true love. Maeterlinck and his wife moved to the south of France, where he continued to write, producing Le Grand Secret (1921; translated as The Great Secret, 1922), a history of the occult sciences, and, between 1927 and 1942, twelve volumes of essays.\n\nIn 1920, during a lecture tour in the United States, Maeterlinck accepted a commission by producer Samuel Goldwyn to write movie scripts. Apparently three scenarios were completed, although none was filmed. Of one, nothing is known; of the second, only the title, \"The Blue Feathers,\" is known. Maeterlinck transformed the third, \"The Power of the Dead,\" into a play that he published as La Puissance des morts in 1926.\n\nAlthough his popular accounts of the lives of bees, termites, flowers, and other nonhuman inhabitants of the natural world sometimes lapse into allegorical accounts of ideal forms of social organization, Maeterlinck made few direct political statements during his life, either as a writer or private citizen. At the turn of the century he expressed socialist views, but after World War I his sympathies turned increasingly to fascism, although never to the Germans. He became a friend of the Portuguese dictator Antonio de Oliveira Salazar and, in a conversation with Gratien Candace, apparently approved of the Italian invasion of Ethiopia. Maeterlinck's politics are most disturbing in their thoughtlessness. One passage in La Sagesse et la destin\u00e9e (1898; translated as Wisdom and Destiny, 1898) seems particularly ominous in its complacency:\n\nIl n'y a pas longtemps, pour ne citer qu'un seul de ces probl\u00e8mes que l'instinct de notre plan\u00e8te est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre, il n'y a pas longtemps, on eut, para\u00eet-il, l'intention de demander aux penseurs de l'Europe s'il faudrait consid\u00e9rer comme un bonheur ou un malheur qu'une race \u00e9nergique, opini\u00e2tre et puissante, mais qui nous semble, \u00e0 nous autres Aryens, en vertu de pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s trop aveugl\u00e9ment accept\u00e9s, inf\u00e9rieure par l'\u00e2me ou par le coeur, la race juive, en un mot, dispar\u00fbt ou dev\u00eent pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante. Je suis persuad\u00e9 que le sage peut r\u00e9pondre, sans qu'il y ait dans sa r\u00e9ponse ni r\u00e9signation ni indiff\u00e9rence r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles: \"Ce qui aura lieu sera le bonheur.\"\n\n(Not long ago--to cite only one of the problems that the instinct of our planet is invited to solve--a scheme was on foot to inquire of the thinkers of Europe whether it should rightly be held as a gain or a loss to mankind if an energetic, strenuous, persistent race, which some, through prejudice doubtless, still regard as inferior to the Aryan in qualities of heart and of soul--if the Jews, in a word, were to vanish from the face of the earth, or to acquire preponderance there. I am satisfied that the sage might answer, without laying himself open to the charge of indifference or undue resignation, \"In what comes to pass will be happiness.\")\n\nOf greatest interest among Maeterlinck's later works for the theater was his 1935 play, La Princesse Isabelle, in which Ren\u00e9e Dahon-Maeterlinck performed the title role. La Princesse Isabelle is remarkable for its framing of the fairy-tale motifs so common in Maeterlinck's early plays: here the \"princess\" inhabits a psychiatric hospital.\n\nIn 1940 Maeterlinck settled in the United States and remained there until the end of World War II. He and his wife lived briefly in New York before moving to Florida. In 1945 the couple returned to Orlamonde, their estate in the south of France. Although Maeterlinck continued to write plays after World War II, he had little to do with theatrical life, and his later plays were seldom performed. The aged writer died from a heart attack on 6 May 1949.\n\nThe most theatrical aspect of Maeterlinck's work in the last decades of his life was his playing of the somewhat anachronistic role of the isolated sage and man of letters, but such a staging of the self had always characterized his authorship, as it had that of so many turn-of-the-century writers and actors. Leblanc's account of her arrangement of their first meeting--she wore a Pre-Raphaelite costume--is especially illuminating on this aspect of their relationship.\n\nParadoxically, the work that made Maeterlinck famous in Paris, La Princesse Maleine, was never staged there in the 1890s. There were four extremely important productions of his plays in Paris during that decade, however. L'Intruse and Les Aveugles were both staged at Fort's Th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'Art in 1891, and Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande and Int\u00e9rieur were performed by Lugn\u00e9-Po\u00eb's troupe in 1893 and 1895, respectively. As Frantisek Deak points out in Symbolist Theater: The Formation of an Avant-Garde (1993), the theaters of these two men are often seen as the successors and antithesis of Antoine's Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Libre, which emphasized a naturalist repertory, but in reality the programs of both the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'Art and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Oeuvre challenged a clear distinction between the two styles. Maeterlinck's plays appeared in the company of works by Ibsen, Strindberg, Gerhart Hauptmann, and other dramatists, whose dramas combined elements from both. As Maeterlinck's own remarks on Ibsen's Master Builder in Le Tr\u00e9sor des humbles show, the distinctive mixture of realism and symbolism in the Norwegian's late plays were particularly attractive to playwrights, theater directors, and audiences alike in Paris in the early 1890s.\n\nYet, in Maeterlinck's plays the realist dimension is reduced to the vague evocation of spooky northern settings or timeless bourgeois interiors in which families await a fate that is unrelated to specific actions or social conditions. Atmospheric realism has given way to atmosphere. The interiors represented onstage are mostly psychological in significance. The characters are flat, unindividuated, more like voices in a single psyche than rounded representations of human agents. Maeterlinck's early dramas are prototypes of the chamber theaters of Max Reinhardt and Strindberg and thus of the dramatic genres of the chamber play and chamber movie. As embodied in Strindberg's five Chamber Plays (1907-1908), chamber plays involve a kind of performance akin to chamber music, in which dramatic characters interact like the elements in a musical ensemble and in which the borderline between psychological and architectural interiors tends to dissolve. The highly repetitive dialogue of Maeterlinck's early plays, in which the voice of one character picks up, repeats, and transforms the words of another, points especially to this kind of musical interplay. It was also admirably suited to the kind of incantatory delivery that Fort and Lugn\u00e9-Po\u00eb encouraged in their actors.\n\nIf Maeterlinck's plays were only seldom staged in the 1890s in France, they were nevertheless far more suited to theatrical performance than other contemporary pieces associated with the symbolist movement, Villiers's Ax\u00ebl (1890), for example, or the dramatic fragments of Mallarm\u00e9. One suspects that the initial appeal of Maeterlinck's dramas to admirers of and participators in the symbolist movement lay in their superficial resemblance to Mallarm\u00e9's work. The pale, death-bound princesses of the Belgian's early plays recall the frigidly beautiful and deadly H\u00e9rodiade, although in this stage of Maeterlinck's production the murderous aspect of the chaste princess has been deflected onto an aging stepmother-queen. But the language in Maeterlinck's plays is strikingly different from that in Mallarm\u00e9's work. Where the French poet's language is complex, economical, and rife with ambiguities and intersecting resonances, the dialogue of Maeterlinck's plays is loose and repetitive. It harks back to the plaintive refrain of Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\" (1845)--\"Nevermore, nevermore\"--rather than to the concern with literary form and meaning associated with Poe's essay \"The Philosophy of Composition\" (1846). One sees in Maeterlinck's early plays the tendency to popularize, represented more obviously in his many books of essays. These plays translate the esoteric language and mythic abstractions of late-nineteenth-century French poetry into the forms of fairy tales. If the poetry of writers such as Charles Baudelaire and Mallarm\u00e9 invites comparison with the evocation of the ineffable in the writings of mystics, Maeterlinck's essays expound the ideas of writers in the mystic tradition. The language of Maeterlinck's early plays emphasizes orality over textuality; its silences are highly meaningful; it fills in the gaps, the white spaces, of the texts of Mallarm\u00e9 and other poetic turn-of-the-century authors.\n\nThe legacy of Maurice Maeterlinck is double-edged. On the one hand, he was one of the most innovative dramatists of fin de si\u00e8cle Europe. His plays point forward to the intimate theater of Strindberg, Reinhardt, and other major twentieth-century playwrights and directors. They played a crucial role in the development of Russian symbolism. The early plays influenced Yeats, and their emphasis on myth and sacrifice also points forward to the dramatic theories and practice of Antonin Artaud. Maeterlinck himself was capable of taking up and transforming a new form in the theater, such as the station drama. But on the other hand, his writing, especially his popularizing essays, sometimes lapses into clich\u00e9s and apolitical complacency. At his worst he warns of the dangers of New Age philosophy. At his best he reminds one of the necessary relationship between good theater and the unknown.\n\nFrom: Wilkinson, Lynn R., and Leon Sachs. \"Maurice Maeterlinck.\" Nobel Prize Laureates in Literature, Part 3, Gale, 2007.

Their family was one of farmers and gentry, an inauspicious background for his subsequent diplomatic career. Becoming expert in economic affairs, in 1890 he embarked on a long and brilliant career in the foreign service that took him from New York City to China (for 14 years), back to Europe, and then to South America. While pursuing his literary career, he was the French ambassador to Tokyo (1921), Washington (1927), and Brussels (1933).\n\nAs he traveled the world, removed from the literary circles of Paris, he slowly elaborated his theocentric conception of the universe and conceived his vocation: the revelation through poetry, both lyrical and dramatic, of the grand design of creation. This enthusiastic and relentless deciphering of the cosmos was inspired in Claudel\u2019s 18th year by a double revelation: the discovery of Rimbaud\u2019s Illuminations and his sudden conversion to Roman Catholicism.\n\nClaudel reached his largest audience through his Symbolist plays\u2014works that powerfully synthesized all theatrical elements to evoke a unified mood, atmosphere, and leitmotif. He reorchestrates his themes, expressed by a few symbolic types, again and again. His heroes are men of action\u2014generals, conquerors, born masters of the earth. La Ville (published 1890), L\u2019Echange (written 1893), and Le Repos du septi\u00e8me jour (written 1896) all portray heroes burning with all the lusts of the flesh: pride, greed, ambition, violence, and passion. But Claudel moves beyond man\u2019s appetites along a firm path to redemption.\n\nIn 1900 Claudel underwent a religious crisis and decided to abandon his artistic and diplomatic career and enter a Benedictine monastery. Discouraged by the Order and deeply disappointed, he left France to take up a consular post in China. On shipboard he met a married Polish woman with whom he shared an adulterous love for the next four years, after which time it was mutually renounced.\n\nAlthough Claudel married a French woman in 1906, this episode of forbidden love became a major myth of his subsequent works beginning with Partage de midi (published 1906). In this searching, autobiographical work, Claudel appears torn between human and divine love. The conflict is resolved in L\u2019Annonce faite \u00e0 Marie (1912; Tidings brought to Mary, 1916), a medieval mystery in tone, in which Claudel expounds on woman\u2019s place in God\u2019s scheme. Woman, the daughter of Eve, temptress and source of evil, is also the child of Mary, the initiator of man\u2019s search for salvation: such is the Do\u00f1a Prouh\u00e8ze of Le Soulier de satin (written 1924; The Satin Slipper, 1931), Claudel\u2019s masterpiece. The stage is the Spanish Catholic world of the Renaissance; it reaches through Columbus, the Jesuits, and the conquistadors to the very ends of the earth. This huge tapestry is the story of the pursuit of the unattainable (because she is married) Do\u00f1a Prouh\u00e8ze by the adventurer Rodrigue, who is the characteristic worldly, passionate, and predatory Claudelian hero. The couple rejects sexual fulfillment and accepts the ultimate sacrifice: death for Prouh\u00e8ze, enslavement for Rodrigue; thus, they reach the spiritual consummation of their union.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Set in the time of the French Revolution, it portrays faith humiliated in the person of the pope. He also wrote Le Livre de Christophe Colomb (published 1933), with music by Darius Milhaud, and the oratorio Jeanne d\u2019arc (performed 1938), with music by Arthur Honegger.\n\nHis best-known and most impressive lyrical works are the ambitious, confessional Cinq grandes odes (1910). Later volumes, which consist of poems written at various times, lack the symbolic unity that holds the odes together. He very early adopted a long, unscanned, usually unrhymed line that came to be known as the verset claud\u00e9lien, which is his unique contribution to French prosody."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/jean.hugo/3743152", "page_content": "Jean Hugo\n\nartist designer illustrator writer\n\nNovember 19, 1894 (age 89) Paris, France\n\nJean Hugo is mainly known as the author of a great number of sketches and oil or gouache paintings, which are often small sized. He also created illustrations for books, designed theatre sets, and costumes as well as produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo's first published illustration appeared in 1918. It was a monogram for La Sir\u00e8ne publishing house. Then he also illustrated Les Joues en Feu by Raymond Radiguet, Bernouard, in 1920; Pommes d'Anis by Francis Jammes, Emile-Paul, 1923; Les Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel by Jean Cocteau, NRF, and Les Amis Nouvel by Paul Morand, Au Sans Pareil, both in 1924; Rom\u00e9o et Juliette by Shakespeare, Au Sans Pareil, in 1926, among others. Jean Hugo\u2019s paintings were unique in the artistic world of the 20th century. They maintained an authentic originality while recalling certain avant-garde themes of metaphysical painting or magical realism. At the start of the 1930s, in between various theatrical projects, including Jean Cocteau\u2019s Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel, he produced a series of masterful artworks, such as Solitude (1933). He was interested in forest scenes (L'Ermite de Meudon, 1933) and religious themes (La C\u00e8ne, 1933). L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. Many of his paintings were based on the sketches that he created all the time. He used to say that \"inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it.\" L'Imposteur (1931) was a conclusion of Jean Hugo's first artistic period. Around this time he moved from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, after the death of his grandmother. His painting of that period was a masterful assembly of the most important insights he had acquired so far. The lessons of the Italian primitives, of Poussin, of Henri Rousseau, and Picasso, were among the sources of inspiration on which he was constantly drawing. In the middle of the 1930s, Jean Hugo started to use oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. The artist's work witnessed his intention to work outside of present-day currents and fashionable theories. He never took part in the artistic debates and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public. The artist illustrated many limited edition books published between 1948 and 1984 by Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Benoit (PAB), collaborating with such writers as Ren\u00e9 Char, Marcel Jouhandeau, Tristan Tzara and Ren\u00e9 Crevel. Jean Hugo's artworks were widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the United States. Among the most prominent of them were: Jean Hugo and Max Jacob at the Claridge Gallery, London, 1929; Jean Hugo '77 at the Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977; Paintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau at Sotheby's, London, 1981; Jean Hugo: 1894-1984 at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985; Jean Hugo: a Retrospective at the Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996; Jean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne at the Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001; Jean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien at the Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014, etc."}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/84973.Paul_Claudel", "page_content": "Showing 30 distinct works.\n\nsort by popularity original publication year title average rating number of pages\n\nI Believe in God: A Meditation on the Apostles' Creed\n\nKnowing the East (The Lockert Library of Poetry in Translation, 54)\n\n* Note: these are all the books on Goodreads for this author.

Via archived notes and drafts, a retrospective reconstitution of such projects can serve as a key for better understanding the author\u2019s artistic corpus. The present study reaches out to the authorship of Paul Claudel, Jean Genet, and Federico Fellini. Claudel deferred and never completed the fourth segment of his Trilogie des Coufontaine. Like the unfinished fourth section that was to be added to the trilogy, the draft of the third version of Tete d\u2019Or reveals a dialogue between the Old and New Testaments \u2013 a theme that appears to be central to Claudel\u2019s entire corpus. Genet labored over La Mort for many years. While the project never came to fruition, it nevertheless remains an important means through which to understand Genet\u2019s work.

Her life as she\u2019d known it simply stopped. Her paranoid delusions made her afraid that Rodin would steal her ideas if she continued to work, a fear that she expressed in countless letters, as well as letters that simply expressed her distress. \u201cIt is terrible to be so abandoned,\u201d she wrote to the asylum doctor in 1915. \u201cI can\u2019t help but succumb to the grief that overwhelms me.\u201d\n\nRodin, however, continued to support her financially at a distance, setting up a small fund after his death. He\u2019d always expressed a wish that there\u2019d be a Camille Claudel Room when a museum dedicated to his own work opened in Paris. The Rodin Museum opened two years after Rodin\u2019s death, but this wish for a room devoted to his outstanding pupil never materialised.\n\nNow, almost a century later, most of these 90 works have been gathered together in their new home at the Camille Claudel Museum in Nogent-sur-Seine, a small, sleepy and picturesque town on the banks of the Seine, 100km (62 miles) south-east of Paris where the Claudel family settled in 1876. Designed by Adelfo Scaranello, the understated brick building with its large plate-glass windows incorporates the home in which the Claudels lived for three years, her father having been appointed a mortgage registrar for the town. It was here that the teenage Camille produced her first acclaimed pieces of juvenilia, including a bust of Bismarck, one of Napoleon and a David and Goliath, now all alas lost."}, {"url": "https://en.geneastar.org/genealogy/hugojean/jean-hugo", "page_content": "Jean Hugo (19 November 1894 \u2013 21 June 1984) was a painter, illustrator, theatre designer and author.

His grandfather, Charles Hugo was a journalist, pioneer of early photographic techniques and a campaigner against the death penalty, and his father Georges Hugo was a published author and a recognised painter.

L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. His painting were based on the sketchbooks that he had with him at all times. He used to say that \"Inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it\".L'Imposteur (1931) concludes Hugo's first artistic period, which coincides with his move from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, following the death of his grandmother. This imposing painting is an assembly of the most important insights he had acquired thus far: the lessons of the Italian primitives, of Henri Rousseau, of Poussin and Picasso, sources of inspiration on which he is constantly drawing. The subject of the painting evokes the discomfort of the catechumen in the midst of the faithful, prevented from taking communion during Christmas mass at the Church of Saint-Fran\u00e7ois in Montpellier. The painting is set in the countryside around Lunel, with its vineyards and low scrubland (garrigue). The tense and complex composition of the work is extremely well executed. No element, line, motif, nuance of colour or object is secondary. Each element contributes to the pictorial vision. The delicate volumes are bathed in luminosity and stand out from the background. The figures are fixed in the space by superimposed connections, in the Florentine manner.In the middle of the 1930s, he began using oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. Le Mangeur au chandail ray\u00e9 (autoportrait) (1940) shows the artist in his home at the Mas de Fourques. The motif of the stripes contrasts with the neat contours of the table, the chimney and the wall. In this homely setting, the figure seems surrounded by mystery and casualness. Although Hugo does not draw greatly on De Chirico, this work evokes the feeling of isolation and mystery that characterises the production of the latter.Jean Hugo's work bears witness to his intention to work outside of current trends and fashionable theories. He never felt the need to participate in the artistic debates of his time and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public.His auction record is $US308,200, for Les Plaisirs et les Jours, set at Fran\u00e7ois de Ricql\u00e8s' auction, Paris, on 26 November 1999.Selected exhibitionsHugo's work has been widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the USA.Jean Hugo and Max Jacob, Claridge Gallery, London, 1929The Art of Jean Hugo, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, 1973Jean Hugo, Mus\u00e9e Paul Val\u00e9ry, S\u00e8te, 1974Jean Hugo '77, Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977Jean Hugo, Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1977\u201378Paintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau, Sotheby's, London, 1981Jean Hugo: Costumes pour \"l'Homme qui rit\", Maison de Victor Hugo, Paris, 1984Jean Hugo: 1894\u20131984, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985Jean Hugo: palettes et souvenirs, Mus\u00e9e Victor Hugo, Paris, 1994\u201395Jean Hugo: Dessins des ann\u00e9es de guerre (1915\u20131919), Ch\u00e2teau de Bl\u00e9rancourt Mus\u00e9e de la coop\u00e9ration franco-am\u00e9ricaine, 1994\u201395Jean Hugo: Une R\u00e9trospective, Pavillon du Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1995Jean Hugo: a Retrospective, Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996Jean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne, Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001Jean Hugo, le manuscrit enlumin\u00e9, Mus\u00e9e M\u00e9dard, Lunel, 2014Jean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien, Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014Published workLe Retour de l'enfant terrible: Lettres 1923\u20131966 by Jean Bourgoint, Jean Hugo, Jean Mouton (Descl\u00e9e de Brouwer, 1975)Avant d'oublier (Before I Forget), autobiography (Fayard, 1976), was a humorous memoir of his family and a first-hand account of the 1920s French Surrealist movement.Le Regard de la m\u00e9moire (Actes Sud, 1983) \u2013 Jean Hugo's memoirs of the period from 1914 to 1945.

Through his diary entries Jean Hugo reveals the alchemy of his artistic work, and the eye he brought to bear on people and landscapes.

He was, and remains the very image of that perfect humility of the illuminators, for whom daily truths trumpeted decorative graces. His powerful hand, his big Jupiterian eye, his olympism in a way, did not use thunder but little watercolours so vast that it seemed as if their size was the result of a phenomenon of perspective. Indeed, he seems to view the sea in Brittany from a distance, and the garrigue by the big end of the telescope, which does not prevent him from evoking around us the mysterious odour of seaweed and wild herbs. Jean Hugo, subtle peasant, medieval monk, chases the angel from the bizarre through knowing all its tricks by heart.\"Gustave Thibon: \"I knew him intimately. He was a strange being, admirable, a mystic, a lover, a great artist, who no doubt sinned by excess of modesty. He had been a little tired of fame by his name, which was extremely heavy. [...]Jean Hugo spent his youth in that golden world of the big families of the Third Republic, the Berthelot, the Favre, the Renan, the Daudet, a world that he moved away from for a more isolated life in Lunel. His work is far better known, and valued, in America than in France, where he still suffers a little of being eclipsed by his name. I consider him a great painter, and a great painter that is relatively unknown. If he hadn't found others to look after publicising him, he would never have sold a single painting. Picasso, who was a good friend of his, used to say to him \"you do nothing for your fame\". And indeed he did nothing for it \u2013 others did it to him.Once again, he was a pure being. If the word innocence could be applied to anyone it was him. He was very handsome, and of prodigious vitality \u2013 dare I say Hugolian.

Life flowed calmly before him and we knew of no enemies of his. He carried the heavy burden of his family name with elegance.

One is Auguste Rodin, the famous 19th-century French sculptor who created iconic pieces such as The Thinker, The Kiss, and The Gates of Hell. However, there are perhaps just as many artists who have gone unnoticed\u2014particularly women. In fact, it is far less likely that you\u2019ve heard of Camille Claudel, a female French sculptor who worked very closely with Rodin for a portion of her career. During their time of association, Claudel was Rodin\u2019s student, assistant, muse, and lover. But more than that, she was an incredible sculptor in her own right\u2014no easy feat for a woman during that period.\n\nStill, despite the raw talent and drive that Claudel possessed, she\u2014like many artists (especially female ones)\u2014did not receive the success and acclaim she so desired and deserved during her lifetime. Though not entirely unknown and unsuccessful as an artist, her true importance was overshadowed by that of Rodin. Often confined by the rigid gender roles women were confined to and ultimately deserted by those she loved most, Claudel lived a tumultuous life that eventually came to a tragic and solitary end.\n\nThough she died in almost complete insignificance, Claudel\u2019s remarkable talent has since been rediscovered and celebrated to some degree. Read on to discover more about Camille Claudel\u2019s fascinating life and career.\n\nEarly Childhood and Education\n\nThe oldest of three children, Claudel was born to a middle-class family in F\u00e8re-en-Tardenois\u2014a small village in northern France\u2014on December 8, 1864. Her father, Louis-Prosper Claudel, later moved the family to Bar-le-Duc In 1870. There, Camille received the beginnings of her education from the Sisters of the Christian Doctrine.\n\nWhile Camille\u2019s father was extremely supportive of her development as an artist, it was a completely different story with her mother. Louise Anthana\u00efse Claudel didn\u2019t want her daughter to pursue a vocation as an artist. Aligned with the societal norms of the time, Louise viewed the profession as \u201cunladylike\u201d and preferred that her daughter give it up and focus more on her marriage prospects.\n\nArrival in Paris and Further Education\n\nIn 1881, Louis-Prosper Claudel moved his wife and three children to Paris so that their son\u2014Paul Claudel\u2014could pursue higher education. Then age 17, Camille took this opportunity to continue her artistic training and enrolled at the Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi\u2014an art academy that was extremely progressive for its time, not only accepting women to study there but also allowing them to work from nude male models.\n\nThat same year, Boucher left Paris and moved to Florence, Italy. But before he left, he asked Rodin to take his place and continue to supervise and guide his pupils at the studio. It was there that Claudel and Rodin met, and that meeting marked a distinct shift that would completely alter the lives of both artists.\n\nCamille Claudel and Auguste Rodin\n\nRodin was immediately impressed by Claudel\u2019s work\u2014though she was but a young student. The gritty realism apparent in her early works such as Old Helen struck him, and he soon invited her to work alongside him as an apprentice in his own studio. Claudel officially joined Rodin\u2019s studio around 1883, by which time the seasoned sculptor had already received some of his first major commissions.\n\nNonetheless, Claudel and Rodin\u2019s relationship was far from just a professional one. The two had mutual respect and admiration for one another and had become engaged in an impassioned love affair not long after they met. Even more than his apprentice, she became his confidant, model, and muse. Rodin created several portraits of Claudel during this period\u2014starting with Camille Claudel with Short Hair\u2014and also used her as a model for portions of his larger works. He, in turn, was also a model for Claudel on occasion, most notably for her acclaimed work Bust of Rodin. The two artists\u2019 creations mutually inspired and influenced one another as they worked together seamlessly, sharing both models and studios.\n\nBreak From Rodin\n\nClaudel and Rodin\u2019s relationship continued for over 10 years, but things were not always so good. In fact, their romance had sparked a great deal of controversy\u2014one reason being their sizable age gap, with Claudel not yet 20 when they first met and Rodin already into his 40s. One other reason was his relationship with Rose Beuret, who\u2014though they were never officially married\u2014had been his partner for years.\n\nThough she had established and proved herself as an individual artist, people would always compare her to Rodin and attribute her talent and technique to the tutelage of the celebrated sculptor. Looking for a way to distinguish herself further from her former partner and assert her own creativity and genius, Claudel took a new direction with her work. She began to explore more intimate scenes, with more daring compositions, new subjects, and more difficult materials. Some of her most evocative and sensational work is from this period, including pieces such as The Waltz, The Wave, and Sakuntala.\n\nShe had created this sculpture for her first commission from the French state in 1895, originally with the support and endorsement of Rodin. However, when he saw the sculpture for the first time, he was shocked, angry, and offended. He subsequently retracted his public support for Claudel\u2019s work and severed all ties with his former lover. Her commission was also later revoked with little explanation, though many speculate that Rodin may have pushed the state to end its association with Claudel.\n\nTragic Final Years\n\nAfter this final break with Rodin, things rapidly began to decline for Claudel. Though she had wanted to distance herself from the artist, his public support and endorsement of her work had protected her to some degree from many of the sexist practices evident in their artistic vocation. She increasingly lost support because of the overtly sensual nature of several of her pieces, which was not deemed acceptable for a female artist.\n\nAs her career rapidly declined and she fell into financial ruin, Claudel became increasingly paranoid and convinced that Rodin was plotting against her to ruin her and steal her ideas. Because of this, she became more and more reclusive, destroying a large portion of her pieces to prevent Rodin from copying them and even refusing to sculpt anything new. By 1911, she had become a shut-in, her physical and mental health continually worsening.\n\nIn March of 1913, her father\u2014who had always supported and championed her\u2014died, and no one from her family informed her. Claudel\u2019s relationship with her mother, which had always been fraught from the moment the young girl decided to be an artist, had only deteriorated further and further over the years as her indecorous relationship with Rodin and the \u201cunladylike\u201d nature of her work only deepened the rift between Claudel and her mother.\n\nShe was later transferred to Montdevergues asylum in 1914\u2014due to the outbreak of WWI\u2014and remained there until her death on October 19, 1943. Over the course of her 30-year confinement, she received very few visits from her family or friends. Claudel spent the rest of her days in isolation, removed from all the things that had once made her life vibrant.\n\n\u201cI have fallen into an abyss,\u201d the artist wrote to one of her few remaining contacts during her time at Montdevergues. \u201cI live in a world so curious, so strange. Of the dream that was my life, this is the nightmare.\u201d After Claudel\u2019s lonely death, her body was buried in an unmarked communal grave on the asylum grounds.\n\nCamille Claudel\u2019s Legacy\n\nIn spite of the unjust decline of her sculpting career as well as her life\u2019s tragic ending, the world has once again started to take notice of the work of Claudel. So compelling is her story that it has even been the inspiration for books, plays, films, and even a musical. Before his own death in 1914, Rodin approved plans to add a Camille Claudel room to his museum. These plans were completed in 1952 when Claudel\u2019s brother, Paul, donated several of his sister\u2019s works to the Mus\u00e9e Rodin."}], "Jean Hugo's theatre works included works by Jean Cocteau.": [{"url": "https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-cocteau", "page_content": "Jean Maurice Eug\u00e8ne Cl\u00e9ment Cocteau (French: [\u0292\u0251\u0303 k\u0254kto]; 5 July 1889 \u2013 11 October 1963) was a French writer, designer, playwright, artist and filmmaker. Cocteau is best known for his novel Les Enfants Terribles (1929), and the films The Blood of a Poet (1930), Les Parents Terribles (1948), Beauty and the Beast (1946) and Orpheus (1949). His circle of associates, friends included Kenneth Anger, Pablo Picasso, Joan Mir\u00f3, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Gertrude Stein, Jean Hugo, Jean Marais, Henri Bernstein, Yul Brynner, Marlene Dietrich, Coco Chanel, Erik Satie, Albert Gleizes, Igor Stravinsky, Marie Laurencin, Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix, \u00c9dith Piaf, Panama Al Brown, Colette, Jean Genet, and Raymond Radiguet.\n\n\n\nCocteau was born in Maisons-Laffitte, Yvelines, a town near Paris, to Georges Cocteau and his wife, Eug\u00e9nie Lecomte; a socially prominent Parisian family. His father was a lawyer and amateur painter who committed suicide when Cocteau was nine. From 1900\u20131904, Cocteau attended the Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet where he met and began a physical relationship with schoolmate Pierre Dargelos who would later reappear throughout Cocteau's oeuvre. He left home at fifteen. He published his first volume of poems, Aladdin's Lamp, at nineteen. Cocteau soon became known in Bohemian artistic circles as The Frivolous Prince, the title of a volume he published at twenty-two. Edith Wharton described him as a man \"to whom every great line of poetry was a sunrise, every sunset the foundation of the Heavenly City...\"\n\n\n\nIn his early twenties, Cocteau became associated with the writers Marcel Proust, Andr\u00e9 Gide, and Maurice Barr\u00e8s. In 1912, he collaborated with L\u00e9on Bakst on Le Dieu bleu for the Ballets Russes; the principal dancers being Tamara Karsavina and Vaslav Nijinsky. During World War I Cocteau served in the Red Cross as an ambulance driver. This was the period in which he met the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, artists Pablo Picasso and Amedeo Modigliani, and numerous other writers and artists with whom he later collaborated. Russian impresario Sergei Diaghilev persuaded Cocteau to write a scenario for a ballet, which resulted in Parade in 1917. It was produced by Diaghilev, with sets by Picasso, the libretto by Apollinaire and the music by Erik Satie. The piece was later expanded into a full opera, with music by Satie, Francis Poulenc and Maurice Ravel. \"If it had not been for Apollinaire in uniform,\" wrote Cocteau, \"with his skull shaved, the scar on his temple and the bandage around his head, women would have gouged our eyes out with hairpins.\" He denied being a Surrealist or being in any way attached to the movement. Cocteau wrote the libretto for Igor Stravinsky's opera-oratorio Oedipus rex, which had its original performance in the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Sarah Bernhardt in Paris on 30 May 1927.\n\n\n\nAn important exponent of avant-garde art, Cocteau had great influence on the work of others, including a group of composers known as Les six. In the early twenties, he and other members of Les six frequented a wildly popular bar named Le Boeuf sur le Toit, a name that Cocteau himself had a hand in picking. The popularity was due in no small measure to the presence of Cocteau and his friends.\n\nThis is a part of the Wikipedia article used under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License (CC-BY-SA).

Cocteau began as a poet but aspired toward the creation of worlds into which an audience could be immersed. He drew from many influences, filtering the world around him through his personal sensibility and life experiences. Cocteau, though controversial among his peers due to his eagerness to please, valued collaboration and his receptivity to the ideas of others is evident throughout his body of work, which broke new ground in creating links between different styles, media and periods.\n\nAccomplishments\n\nCocteau aspired to create \"total works of art,\" extending Richard Wagner's concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk, then more familiar in theory than in practice, combining words, images and movements in multiple dimensions. This led him to direct ballet and film, illustrate his own books and decorate interiors, all of which provided the possibility of immersing the audience in his creations. This attitude to art making, which involved many collaborators, set the tone for the avant-garde later in the century.\n\nJean Cocteau's work is often personal, mapping his own perspective onto the universal through reimagining myth in contemporary life, resulting in novel perspectives on familiar situations. Cocteau avoided the overtly political, favoring the escape from life offered through explorations of dream and the unconscious.\n\nCocteau's work is divisive due to his difficulty fitting into established categories. He was unpopular, in his lifetime, due both to homophobia and to his obvious desperation for attention, but his habit of working across many media meant critics discredited him as failing to master any single discipline while fans praised his ability to work beyond arbitrary limitations.\n\nCocteau was deeply depressed for much of his adult life and used art making, along with opium, as a means of coping with this. His work is indicative of his struggles, regularly exploring the possibility that creativity itself is inseparable from despair.\n\nJean Cocteau's work is regularly described as 'surreal,' though he was never affiliated with the Surrealist group. Cocteau, like the Surrealists, was interested in exploring dreams and the unconscious and his mythologization of everyday life is similar to that of key figures such as Louis Aragon and Luis Bu\u00f1uel, with whom he was on friendly terms. Andr\u00e9 Breton, the leader of the Surrealist group, however, viewed Cocteau's Romantic aesthetic as conservative and as anathema to the Surrealist creed of pure automatism and this, exacerbated by personal disagreements and Breton's homophobia, meant that Cocteau and the Surrealist group denied all links, despite their artistic similarities.\n\nThe Life of Jean Cocteau\n\nCocteau was a celebrity in his time and his disastrous romantic liaisons were widely discussed (one spurned lover shot himself, one died under the Gestapo, another became a monk). His reputation at times preceded him, even causing him to lament \"my name has overtaken my work.\" Read full biography Read artistic legacy\n\nImportant Art by Jean Cocteau\n\nProgression of Art\n\n1917 Parade This image shows two of the costumes from Parade in front of the set background, both costumes designed by Pablo Picasso under Jean Cocteau's direction. The ballet followed three groups of circus performers attempting to lure an audience to a performance. These costumes, made from cardboard, were abstract and brightly colored; the figure on the left is a French businessman, identified through his pipe, while the figure on the right is an American businessman, with a red shirt, top hat and megaphone, with yellow and orange grids representing skyscrapers. The set resembles a child's drawing, with simple shapes suggesting fairground architecture. The score included sound effects, such as typewriters and sirens, interspersed with orchestral music.\n\n\n\nCocteau conceived of the ballet, which he pushed for the Ballets Russes to perform, as a work in which everyday life would, for the first time, be danced; he saw performance as offering an opportunity to bring literature, music, dance, sculpture and painting together into an all-encompassing artwork, creating an immersive world. Cocteau conceived of the scenario and wrote the libretto, selected Erik Satie as composer and worked with him - and sometimes against him - on the inclusion of sound within the music and enlisted Pablo Picasso to work on sets and costumes. Parade can be seen as a response to Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's call for the circus to invade the theatre, combining the popular entertainment of the dance hall with the classical language of ballet. Artwork Images 1930 Illustration from The White Book This drawing shows two torsos joined at the belly button, with facial profiles detached and turned, such that they do not flow from the bodies, but are linked by a line extending between the eye of the face in the lower left corner and that in the upper right. The image is from the 1930 edition of The White Book, a combination of autobiography and fiction exploring homosexuality which featured seventeen drawings accompanying the text. The text traces the erotic awakening of a young boy, while the images center upon anonymous male bodies. The narrator cannot be clearly linked to any of the figures, who are notably fragmentary, often rendered without hands or feet and with grey patches obscuring their genitalia, alongside a text in which Cocteau does not refer to the penis by name, instead using euphemisms ranging from \"an enigma\" to \"that little underwater plant.\"\n\n\n\nThe book's central image shows the outline of two men, in similar postures, pressing their bodies on alternate sides of a mirror. The illustrations before and after this center similarly correspond, such that the book itself foregrounds doubling; the above illustration, also, with its doubled torso and multiple faces, suggests sexual eroticism springs, in part, from the allure of the mirror. The images are colored with soft pink, pale blue, dark grey and beige, though the colors do not correspond with reality, with some bodies left uncolored while others are blue or pink.\n\n\n\nThe White Book borrows, for its title, a phrase used to designate a set of official documents addressing a problem, as homosexuality was undeniably seen at this time; the word 'white,' however, has connotations of innocence, suggesting that the book operates essentially as a defense, as is supported by Cocteau's argument, in the text, that his \"misfortunes stem from a society that condemns the rare as a crime and forces us to reform our inclinations.\" Cocteau's simultaneous avowal and disavowal of the text's authorship is in keeping with the tone adopted by the book, which celebrates homosexuality whilst accepting the inability to speak of it openly, as hinted at by the anonymity of most partners mentioned in the text and by a drawing of two men blindfolded. The centrality of the mirror image links The White Book with Cocteau's broader oeuvre, in which he frequently deployed mirrors to signify passage into the unknown. The colors used for the illustrations, in 1930, are clearly influenced by Cocteau's friend Marie Laurencin, known for working in a similar palette, while the fluid lines and abstraction of the figures show Picasso's influence. Cocteau revised the illustrations as his sexuality shifted; while the bodies drawn in 1930 are fragile and graceful, those accompanying the 1947 edition celebrate strength and virility, with far more explicit depictions of sexual acts. Artwork Images 1929 Les Enfants Terribles Les Enfants Terribles, published in 1929, centers upon siblings, Paul and Elizabeth, who isolate themselves as teenagers, playing a 'game' with one another that governs, disrupts and ultimately ends their lives. The central characters are based on Jean and Jeanne Bourgoint, twins with whom Cocteau was close, while the setting borrows from Cocteau's own living space, a room filled with photographs. It is easy, also, to read Cocteau's own way of being into that of the siblings, who are more imbedded in dream than reality, with confusion over the boundaries of the imagination and difficulty making sense of adulthood. Les Enfants Terribles introduces two other figures, Dargelos and Agathe, to this relationship, aggravating it with sexual competition. This image, a line drawing that shows two figures composed of one green line, meeting at lips, forehead and chest, was made for the cover of the 1963 reprinting.\n\n\n\nCocteau wrote Les Enfants Terribles in only seventeen days and expected that only a few people would read the book; instead, it was a popular and critical triumph. Cocteau's success was quickly complicated, however, by the death of Jeanne Bourgoint later in 1929, for which many blamed Cocteau, feeling that the suicide was designed after that of the book, despite reports that the siblings had not recognized themselves. Nonetheless, Cocteau did not distance himself from Les Enfants Terribles, as indicated by the cover he drew for the 1963 edition, which emphasizes the closeness of the book's central characters, who lack boundaries such that many critics mistakenly believed the novel to involve sexual, alongside emotional, incest. Artwork Images 1930 Still from Blood of a Poet This still from Blood of a Poet shows blood streaming from the head of the film's Poet, played by Enrique Rivero, who has just shot himself, in the penultimate scene from which the film takes its name. He wears a crown of leaves and draped scarves; to his left is a shadow appearing as an abstract face, traced on the wall behind. Cocteau's film is dreamlike, beginning with a man discovering a speaking mouth in the palm of his hand, which he slides over his body, moving downward from his face. He awakens to find a statue, played by the photographer Lee Miller, who encourages him to dive through a mirror which leads to a corridor where he looks through keyholes, seeing different worlds in each room.\n\n\n\nCocteau saw filmmaking as akin to drawing or writing on a grander scale, allowing the creation of worlds. He took full advantage of the possibilities of film to imitate the feeling of a dream, using slow and reverse motion along with positioning cameras above the sets in order to create unusual perspectives. Cocteau deliberately exhausted his performers so that they would appear, with tired movements, like sleepwalkers. This was heightened by the frequent use of black backdrops, creating a sense that the film's imagery and characters were suspended in space. Blood of a Poet was, alongside the work of Ren\u00e9 Clair, Luis Bu\u00f1uel and Salvador Dal\u00ed, among the first films constructed as artworks, making full use of the medium to subvert both space and narrative progression. Artwork Images 1934 Still from The Infernal Machine The Infernal Machine is a rewriting of Sophocle's Oedipus Rex, which follows the titular figure as he becomes King of Thebes through, unbeknownst to him, killing his father and sleeping with his mother; upon discovering what he has done, he gouges out his eyes. Cocteau combined the classical story with conventions from popular theatre in order make it contemporary. Cocteau used familiar, casual language; Jocasta, Queen of Thebes, for example, calls the High Priest Tiresias 'Zizi' and comments on the attractiveness of a guard, asking Zizi to \"feel his biceps.\" Once again, Cocteau's interest in collaboration served the play; Coco Chanel designed the costumes, which combined classical simplicity with modern materials and shapes, while Christian Berard designed the sets, which had a geometry ideal for combining the tragic story with the playful, prosaic language.\n\n\n\nCocteau's interpretation of the Oedipus mix indicates the way in which he used his own life to give depth to mythology and to shape his own interpretations. The play, written at the denouement of his love affairs with both Jean Desbordes and Natalie Paley, is a contemplation of childhood's role in love's failures and on personal agency. Cocteau portrays Oedipus as innocent, condemned by an oracle and tricked by the gods, bearing no responsibility for his actions toward his parents. He is typically read as an autobiographical figure, reflecting Cocteau's guilt around his silence about his father's death and the weight of his mother's love; like Oedipus, Cocteau viewed himself as special, or chosen by the gods, only to struggle with the question of whether it was creative success or personal misery that made him special or if, perhaps, the two were inextricably linked. Artwork Images 1945 Still from Beauty and the Beast Beauty and the Beast, based on a fairytale written two centuries earlier, follows a young girl, Belle, who is trapped in a castle by a Beast with whom she eventually falls in love, discovering finally that the Beast is a transformed Prince. Jean Marais plays both the Beast/Prince while Belle is played by Josette Day. The film begins with a plea to the audience, by Cocteau himself, to suspend adult belief, watching the film as a child might; the opening credits, which are presented on a chalkboard and erased by Cocteau as he speaks, emphasize the audience's immersion in the world of the film. There is little dialogue in Beauty and the Beast, but the opulent details create a fantastical environment; candelabras are held by human arms which reach up from a table covered in jewels and fruit, while stone caryatids embedded in the architecture have moving eyes and breathe smoke. Belle and the Beast are, however, notably real, with pronounced chemistry between the two actors, aiding the audience's suspension of disbelief.\n\n\n\nJean Cocteau drew upon the illustrations of Gustave Dor\u00e9 in his representation of the Beast's castle, while Jan Vermeer's paintings act as a reference point for scenes, at the beginning of the film, set in a light-filled farmhouse. Cocteau places a different emphasis on the end of the story than is common in other interpretations, shooting Jean Marais as the Prince in a saccharine style, intended to undercut his conventional good looks, such that the disappointment of a fairytale ending, in which the heroine leaves romantic drama for marriage and children, is brought to the fore. Beauty and the Beast has been subject to a range of interpretations, with some critics arguing it offers a commentary on France during World War II, presenting occupation as an evil yet seductive spell, while others see it as a meditation on the conflict between creativity and contentment. Cocteau himself saw Beauty and the Beast as exploring the ways in which the unconscious shapes the pursuit of a particular type of man repeatedly and as an exposure of fairytale ideals, including conventional good looks and marriage, as na\u00efve. Cocteau's work draws its ongoing impact in part through the degree to which it remains ambiguous, allowing for a wide range of intended and unintended readings. Artwork Images 1957 Cocteau's fresco decoration of Chapelle Saint-Pierre in Villefranche-sur-Mer Cocteau's work on the Chapelle Saint-Pierre in Villefranche-sur-Mer consists of a group of five frescoes, covering the building's interior, along with external decoration of the doors and the design of the altar and candelabras. This fresco, at the altar, depicts a scene from the Gospel of Mark, in which Christ anoints Saint Peter as Patron Saint of Fishermen. Cocteau renders the scene with fluid lines; the figures are shown with simple garments and shifting proportions that serve to emphasize Christ's divinity. The architectural features of the chapel are highlighted with playful geometric patterns tracing their edges. The frescoes, drawn in charcoal, are colored with subtle pinks, whites and blues.\n\n\n\nCocteau discovered, in 1956, that this Romanesque chapel, where fishermen preciously kept nets, had recently been restored and pushed for permission to paint it, wishing for a distraction from depression and loneliness. Cocteau saw the chapel as a site for escaping reality; he was not religious but was interested in all belief systems, including Christianity, for the ways in which they blended the mythical with the everyday. The separation of the space from the outside world is emphasized by the soft colors, which create a restful mood, while the depiction of Saint Peter and the primacy of the sea, behind the altar, serves to elevate the daily activities of the fishermen into a celestial realm. The Chapelle Saint-Pierre extends Cocteau's existing drawing practice into three-dimensions, with the same fluid lines and simple figures that characterize his illustration work appearing on an immersive scale.\n\nBiography of Jean Cocteau\n\nChildhood\n\nJean Cocteau was born to Georges Cocteau and Eug\u00e9nie Lecomte on July 5, 1889, in Maisons-Laffitte, a small town near Paris. He had a very solitary childhood, as his two siblings, Marthe and Paul, were both much older. Cocteau was nonetheless a happy child, spending summer in Maisons-Lafitte and winter in Paris, reading and playing, fascinated with fairytales and dressing in costume. The family were wealthy and Georges Cocteau, a lawyer, was able to quit his job early in Cocteau's childhood, spending his time painting and playing billiards while Eug\u00e9nie Lecomte went to the theatre and posed for artists including Nadar (and his brother) and Jacques-\u00c9mile Blanche. Georges Cocteau introduced his son to drawing and the child earnt pocket money by selling his drawings to his grandfather. Jean Cocteau was ten when his father committed suicide, which created a harsh division between childhood and adult existence with which he would struggle throughout his life.\n\nAfter his father's death, Cocteau was enrolled at the Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet, a private school. Cocteau struggled with his classes, succeeding only in drawing and gymnastics, and was eventually expelled for his repeated absences, after which he was given private lessons at home. Cocteau spent his teenage years close to the theatre; he created his own plays with Ren\u00e9 Rocher, a friend from the Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet, and the pair came to know actress Mistinguett, who courted the affections of her son's friends. Mistinguett later claimed that she was the first woman to sleep with Jean Cocteau, a story he neither confirmed nor denied, though he noted that his first sexual experience was with Albert Botten, a jockey, after which his mother warned him to think of the honor of the family. Cocteau failed the bac, the French high school diploma exam, twice and began to write poetry, in which his idealization of the past, fear of death and deep sadness is clearly evident.\n\nIn 1907, Cocteau and his mother moved permanently to Paris, settling in the city's northwest. Eug\u00e9nie Lecomte, determined to remain a widow, shifted her affections onto her youngest son, who remained, like a child, unable to distinguish between myth and reality, imagining himself as the son of a foreign diplomat or an archaeologist. Cocteau's relationship with his mother left him practiced at pleasing others, creating an illusion of happiness out of fear that his sadness might be upsetting; the pair never spoke of Georges Cocteau's death.\n\nEarly Training and Work\n\nIn Paris, Cocteau threw himself into the world of literary salons. He befriended Lucien Daudet, a novelist and painter, who gave him confidence and introduced him to a group of writers involved with Symbolism. At eighteen, Cocteau met \u00c9douard de Max, a celebrated actor, who arranged a public reading of Cocteau's poetry. This gave Cocteau's mother confidence, only nine months after his second failure at the bac, that he had not inherited his father's weaknesses and she took him to Italy to reward him for this success. In Venice, Jean Cocteau had a brief affair with Raymond Laurent, who shot himself an hour after Cocteau left him on the steps of Santa Maria della Salute.\n\nUpon return, Cocteau moved out of his mother's house and across the river, to a flat in the H\u00f4tel Biron, where other tenants included Auguste Rodin and Isadora Duncan. Cocteau's love affairs were characterized by their unrequited nature, with the artist constantly on either side of mismatched passions. While living in the H\u00f4tel Biron, he had a relationship with Christiane Mancini, a theatre student, which ended after she sent Cocteau letters detailing her desire and suffering. He was more successful professionally during those years, publishing two collections, Aladdin's Lamp (1908) and The Frivolous Prince (1910).\n\nIn 1910, Cocteau moved back to his mother's apartment in Rue d'Anjou. He began a relationship with Madeleine Carlier, an actress much older than him, who did not share his intensity of feeling, which ended when Carlier became pregnant and had an abortion, rejecting Cocteau's suggestion of marriage. Cocteau founded a journal, Scheherazade, which introduced him to contributors including Pierre Bonnard, Natalie Barney and Marie Laurencin. Cocteau met Maurice Rostand, with whom he had a relatively happy relationship; the pair were lovers, collaborated on poems, and became known for wearing outfits inspired by their shared love of the infamous writer Oscar Wilde to society events. Cocteau's closest friends during this period were Marcel Proust and Anna de Noailles, both of whom he worshipped and had deliberately sought out.\n\nCocteau was insistent in making connections that aligned with the art that he admired and wished to produce, pursuing collaborators with a persistence that often alienated others. After seeing Vaslav Nijinsky perform in 1909, Cocteau began to pursue Sergei Diaghilev, hoping to write the libretto for the Ballet Russes; he succeeded, in 1912, with The Blue God, which was a critical and popular failure.\n\nIn 1914, Cocteau presented himself to be enlisted, but found himself exempted from military service due to a weak constitution. Instead, he was instructed to collect milk from farms to give to troops departing to fight in World War I. After this, Cocteau joined Misia Sert, a Parisian socialite, on an amateur ambulance crew outfitted by fashion designer Paul Poiret. In 1915, Cocteau was sent to the front at Coxyde as an engineer; he took photos and drew, seeing war as dreamlike. His perspective, divorced as it was from the reality of war, led to his unpopularity with the soldiers. These experiences would inform Cocteau's novel about the war, Thomas the Imposter (1923).\n\nWorld War I changed Cocteau's stylistic interests. He became interested in Cubism and distanced himself from Proust and de Noailles, who were becoming outdated, instead pursuing Pablo Picasso with gifts of tobacco and requests for portraits which went unanswered. Picasso eventually came to accept Cocteau, though hesitantly, and accepted his invitation to work on sets for Parade, which was performed in 1917, with music by Erik Satie.\n\nShortly after this, Cocteau met the fifteen-year-old Raymond Radiguet, with whom he became obsessed. Radiguet was prot\u00e9g\u00e9, muse, collaborator and unrequited love interest to Cocteau, who drew pictures of him as he slept, but was devastated by his uncertainty regarding Radiguet's feelings for him, eventually realising the teenager was exclusively attracted to women. Cocteau informed Radiguet's father that he would assist with Radiguet's literary future, which he did, introducing him to Bernard Grasset, who published his first novel. The pair remained close until Radiguet's death, from typhoid fever, at age twenty.\n\nThroughout the 1920s, Cocteau was bullied by the Surrealists, who saw him as a symbol of the poetry they wished to destroy. Cocteau wrote to writer Louis Aragon, who was friendlier than others in the group, asking why \"this nastiness, at once confused and meticulous,\" persisted, but didn't receive a clear answer; it appears that the enmity was driven by Andr\u00e9 Breton's homophobia and envy over Cocteau's friendship with the writer and critic Guillaume Apollinaire alongside distaste for Cocteau's floral prose and Romantic attachment to fairy tales. Cocteau received death threats from Robert Desnos, a central Surrealist writer, and disturbing anonymous phone calls during this period.\n\nIn 1926, Cocteau met Jean Desbordes, a lover with whom he would live until 1933. Desbordes inspired Cocteau to create work engaging more directly with his sexuality, the result of which was The White Book, published in an edition of only thirty copies in 1928. Cocteau was bisexual and demisexual, though he largely refrained from categorizing sexuality, but viewed homosexuality as nobler and purer than heterosexuality. Cocteau published The White Book anonymously, so as to avoid upsetting his mother, but signed copies for friends and acquaintances and illustrated the larger edition that appeared in 1930, tacitly admitting authorship.\n\nCocteau was using opium regularly throughout this period. In 1928, he entered a clinic in Saint-Cloud in order to cure himself of the addiction, writing Les Enfants terrible (1929) as a patient and Opium: The Diary of an Addict (1930) shortly after leaving. Cocteau befriended Jacques Maritain, a philosopher, and Charles Henrion, a Catholic priest, during this time. Cocteau continued to use opium throughout his life, feeling that it enhanced his artistic output.\n\nMature Period\n\nIn 1929, Marie Laure and Charles de Noailles offered Cocteau a million francs - quite a substantial amount for Cocteau, though a smaller budget than that granted to commercial directors - to direct a film, leading to The Blood of a Poet, completed in 1930. The film, ending with a child's death, caused outrage, with the Prefect of Police trying to prevent its distribution. In 1932, when the film was finally released, with some changes, the media referred to it as a \"surrealist film,\" angering the Surrealists, who accused Cocteau of plagiarizing Luis Bu\u00f1uel and waited outside his door, hoping to attack him physically.\n\nCocteau had moved toward theatre and film because he felt that he was failing as a poet and had been rejected by his friends of five years earlier. He withdrew to his room for much of the decade, replacing the world with his own inventions. In 1932, he met Natalie Paley, a married Russian princess, who shared his desire to escape reality; the pair embarked on an affair, fueled by opium, in which they left the house only to see Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich movies. This ended when Paley, imagining that she was pregnant, returned to her husband, devastating Cocteau. The mutually destructive escapism of this relationship illustrates the way in which Cocteau's life and work paralleled one another, with critics later commenting on the similarity to his earlier novel, Les Enfants terribles, which had, in fact, initially attracted Paley to Cocteau.\n\nThe onset of the Depression meant a lack of opportunities for artists to make films, but Cocteau continued to write plays throughout the decade, with those performed including La voix humaine (1930), The Infernal Machine (1934), The Knights of the Round Table (1937), Les parents terribles (1938) and La machine \u00e0 \u00e9crire (1941). In the late 1930s, he also began writing popular songs and a column for Paris-Soir detailing his trip around the world in 1936. He became close friends with Edith Piaf, writing Le Bel Indiff\u00e9rent for her in 1940. Cocteau's work became unfashionable, however, as art took on an increasingly political role in the years prior to World War II.\n\nIn 1937, Cocteau met Jean Marais, an actor who would remain a close friend and intermittent lover for the remainder of his life; Marais would also star in many of Cocteau's later films. Cocteau's views on World War II were largely shaped by his anxiety about Marais, who was sent to the front in 1940 and subsequently joined the Resistance, and by his ongoing confusion about the relationship between art, identity and politics. In 1940, Cocteau was a supporter of the League Against Anti-Semitism, which led Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line, a prominent right-wing writer, to issue calls for Cocteau to be shot; in 1941, the 17th Squadron bombed a staging of Les Parents terribles with tear gas and released rats in the audience, ostensibly due to Cocteau's difficulty fitting within existing categories.\n\nIn 1942, however, Cocteau became friends with Arno Breker, a German sculptor who used his connections in the Nazi Party to intervene, at Cocteau's request, to remove Jean Marais's name from the Nazi death-list after Marais punched a rightwing critic. Cocteau wrote an article celebrating Breker's work, resulting in outrage amongst the Parisian artistic community; Breker, who had by this point been selected by Adolf Hitler as Official State Sculptor, temporarily persuaded Cocteau to support the Nazi Party, appealing to the poet's love of myth. Cocteau's attitude, throughout the war, was shaped by self-interest, not ethics.\n\nLate Period\n\nIn 1945, Cocteau returned to directing films with Beauty and the Beast, starring Jean Marais. He consequently directed The Eagle with Two Heads (1948) and Les Parents terribles (1948). In 1950, he directed Orpheus, the second film, after The Blood of a Poet, in a set that would become known as the Orphic Trilogy. This starred Jean Marais, as did Cocteau's last film and the last in this set, The Testament of Orpheus, completed in 1960, which included cameos from a number of celebrities Cocteau had befriended, including Pablo Picasso.\n\nCocteau met Francine Weisweiller, who became a close friend and patron, while filming Les Enfants terribles in 1950, and moved to her home in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, where he would live throughout the decade. Cocteau decorated and painted the villa, making a film, La Villa Santo-Sospir (1952), about this project. Cocteau's lifelong work was recognized during this decade by his appointment as a member of the Belgian Academy in 1954 and the French Academy in 1955. He spent much of this decade painting, having found in it the ability to forget himself, providing some relief from his depression. He painted chapels in Villefranche-sur-Mer, Milly-la-For\u00eat, London and Frejus, a theatre in Cap d'Ail and a wedding room in Menton. He returned to Milly-la-For\u00eat, where he had kept a house with Jean Marais, shortly before his death in 1963.\n\nThe Legacy of Jean Cocteau\n\nWhile unpopular with those around him, Jean Cocteau and his work have had a significant impact on a later generation. His influence on the Pop great Andy Warhol, who shared Cocteau's fascination with celebrity, his eagerness to borrow from the surrounding culture, his excitement about collaboration and his interest in moving between media, is particularly clear. Cocteau's combination of ancient and modern reference points, while controversial in his day, resonates clearly in postmodern experimentation with 'high' and 'low' culture; postmodern multi-media superstars Jean Paul Goude and Antonio Lopez's iconic Grace Jones Maternity Dress (1979) is, in both its aesthetic and relationship to performance, progeny of Cocteau's Parade.\n\nCocteau's influence can also be seen in the media in which he worked. Composer John Adams shared Cocteau's interest in combining contemporary life with rarefied art forms, as seen in his 1987 opera Nixon Goes to China. Director Bernardo Bertolucci's adaptation of Les Enfants terribles, The Dreamers (2003), shows his debt to both Cocteau's themes and habit of borrowing from those around him, while director Leos Carax's Holy Motors (2012) draws upon Cocteau's use of dream imagery in film. Tom of Finland, known for his erotic drawings, continues Cocteau's exploration of sexuality and the male body, while photographs by Pierre et Gilles similarly explore self-fashioning and desire.\n\nIn Cocteau's final years, he was offered the opportunity to create a museum in Menton, which opened as the Mus\u00e9e du Bastion in 1966, three years after the artist's death, featuring restoration work by Cocteau and a small collection donated by the artist himself. In 2003, the city began raising money for a more substantial museum of Cocteau's work, which opened in 2011, with a collection bequeathed by an American businessman, S\u00e9verin Wunderman. This museum, the Mus\u00e9e Jean Cocteau, is connected to and shares its collection with the Mus\u00e9e du Bastion, enabling rotating exhibitions that have introduced Cocteau's work to a new generation of Mediterranean visitors.\n\nInfluences and Connections\n\nUseful Resources on Jean Cocteau\n\nSimilar Art"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/jean.hugo/3743152", "page_content": "Jean Hugo\n\nartist designer illustrator writer\n\nNovember 19, 1894 (age 89) Paris, France\n\nJean Hugo is mainly known as the author of a great number of sketches and oil or gouache paintings, which are often small sized. He also created illustrations for books, designed theatre sets, and costumes as well as produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo's first published illustration appeared in 1918. It was a monogram for La Sir\u00e8ne publishing house. Then he also illustrated Les Joues en Feu by Raymond Radiguet, Bernouard, in 1920; Pommes d'Anis by Francis Jammes, Emile-Paul, 1923; Les Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel by Jean Cocteau, NRF, and Les Amis Nouvel by Paul Morand, Au Sans Pareil, both in 1924; Rom\u00e9o et Juliette by Shakespeare, Au Sans Pareil, in 1926, among others. Jean Hugo\u2019s paintings were unique in the artistic world of the 20th century. They maintained an authentic originality while recalling certain avant-garde themes of metaphysical painting or magical realism. At the start of the 1930s, in between various theatrical projects, including Jean Cocteau\u2019s Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel, he produced a series of masterful artworks, such as Solitude (1933). He was interested in forest scenes (L'Ermite de Meudon, 1933) and religious themes (La C\u00e8ne, 1933). L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. Many of his paintings were based on the sketches that he created all the time. He used to say that \"inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it.\" L'Imposteur (1931) was a conclusion of Jean Hugo's first artistic period. Around this time he moved from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, after the death of his grandmother. His painting of that period was a masterful assembly of the most important insights he had acquired so far. The lessons of the Italian primitives, of Poussin, of Henri Rousseau, and Picasso, were among the sources of inspiration on which he was constantly drawing. In the middle of the 1930s, Jean Hugo started to use oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. The artist's work witnessed his intention to work outside of present-day currents and fashionable theories. He never took part in the artistic debates and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public. The artist illustrated many limited edition books published between 1948 and 1984 by Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Benoit (PAB), collaborating with such writers as Ren\u00e9 Char, Marcel Jouhandeau, Tristan Tzara and Ren\u00e9 Crevel. Jean Hugo's artworks were widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the United States. Among the most prominent of them were: Jean Hugo and Max Jacob at the Claridge Gallery, London, 1929; Jean Hugo '77 at the Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977; Paintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau at Sotheby's, London, 1981; Jean Hugo: 1894-1984 at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985; Jean Hugo: a Retrospective at the Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996; Jean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne at the Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001; Jean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien at the Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014, etc."}, {"url": "https://www.theculturium.com/jean-cocteau-the-art-of-cinema/", "page_content": "Capturing the soul of the artist on celluloid\n\nA film is not the telling of a dream, but a dream in which we all participate together through a kind of hypnosis, and the slightest breakdown in the mechanics of the dream wakens the dreamer, who loses interest in a sleep that is no longer his own. By dream, I mean a succession of real events that follow on from one another with the magnificent absurdity of dreams, since the spectators would not have linked them together in the same way or have imagined them for themselves, but experience them in their seats as they might experience, in their beds, strange adventures for which they are not responsible \u2026\n\n\u2014Jean Cocteau, The Art of Cinema\n\nWATCHING THE FILMS of the French auteur, Jean Cocteau (5th July 1889\u201311th October 1963) transports you back to a time when motion pictures were full of a myriad of artistic possibilities that are rarely explored in contemporary cinema today.\n\nForever the polymath, Cocteau championed an elegant and ethereal aesthetic through his creative engagement not only through filmmaking and the moving image but also theatre, painting and literature. Indeed, he often referred to his work as \u201cpoetry\u201d\u2014not that which relates to verse but rather a sublime, lyrical sensibility rooted in intellectual integrity and hard work.\n\nDrawing on the spirit of the Romantics, he thus classified his films as Po\u00e9sie de Cin\u00e9ma, his novels as Po\u00e9sie de Roman and his essays Po\u00e9sie Critique in his quest to \u201c\u2026 illuminate various facets of the themes that obsess me: the loneliness of individuals, waking dreams and childhood, that dreadful state of childhood from which I shall never escape.\u201d\n\nThe Poetic Muse\n\nJean Cocteau drew inspiration from the avant-garde circles in which he mingled during the pre-war Paris era that included the likes of Kenneth Anger, Pablo Picasso, Jean Hugo, Henri Bernstein, Marlene Dietrich, Coco Chanel, Erik Satie, Igor Stravinsky, Colette, \u00c9dith Piaf and his long-term lover and collaborator, Jean Marais.\n\nKnown for many artistic accomplishments\u2014the novel Les Enfants Terribles, and the films Les Parents Terribles and La Belle et La B\u00eate\u2014it is his Orphic trilogy that is considered to be his masterwork, comprising Le Sang d\u2019un Po\u00e8te (1930), Orph\u00e9e (1949) and Le Testament d\u2019Orph\u00e9e (1960), in which he utilizes the legendary Greek myth of Orpheus to explore the relationship between art and life, imagination and reality, illusion and truth.\n\nNobody can believe in a famous poet whose name has been invented by a writer. I had to find a mythical bard, the bard of bards, the Bard of Thrace. And his story is so enchanting that it would be crazy to look for another. It provides the background on which I embroider. I do nothing more than to follow the cadence of all fables which are modified in the long run according to who tells the story.\n\n\u2014Jean Cocteau, The Art of Cinema\n\nLe Sang d\u2019un Po\u00e8te\n\nThrough a stunning montage of mood and monochrome, Cocteau\u2019s trilogy exudes an oneiric, timeless beauty rarely seen before, or since, in his evocation of the Poetic Muse. The first instalment, Le Sang d\u2019un Po\u00e8te (The Blood of a Poet), examines the inner struggle of the artist and the correlation between dreams and art, life and the extinction of self.\n\nExquisitely acted by Enrique Riveros, the poet must go through a series of metaphorical deaths in order to be reborn in a state that is closer to his true being. As Cocteau himself remarked, \u201cPoets \u2026 shed not only the red blood of their hearts but the white blood of their souls.\u201d\n\nI am rather surprised whenever I hear people chatter on about poetry in cinematography, the fantastic in cinematography and, particularly, \u2018escapism\u2019, a fashionable term which implies that the audience is trying to get out of itself, while in fact beauty in all its forms drives us back into ourselves and obliges us to find in our own souls the deep enrichment that frivolous people are determined to seek elsewhere.\n\n\u2014Jean Cocteau, The Art of Cinema\n\nOrph\u00e9e\n\nDespite a hiatus of nearly twenty years, the next instalment, Orph\u00e9e (Orpheus) continues the mythic and supernatural theme in a triumph of poetic storytelling. A famous poet (played by Jean Marais, of whom Cocteau remarked, \u201c[He] illuminates the film for me with his soul\u201d), shunned by his Left Bank contemporaries, struggles with divided love for his wife, Eurydice (played by Marie D\u00e9a), and a mysterious princess (played by Maria Casar\u00e8s).\n\nWhen Eurydice is killed, Orpheus follows the princess through Cocteau\u2019s renowned mirrored portal into the underworld, in order to reclaim his wife who is carrying his child. The condition of her revival and release is that Orpheus may never look upon her again, a stipulation he is unable to keep.\n\nSpeaking of the prevailing themes of the film, Cocteau wrote:\n\n1. The successive deaths through which a poet must pass before he becomes, in that admirable line from Mallarm\u00e9, tel qu\u2019en lui-m\u00eame enfin l\u2019\u00e9ternit\u00e9 le change\u2014changed into himself at last by eternity. 2. The theme of immortality: the person who represents Orph\u00e9e\u2019s Death sacrifices herself and abolishes herself to make the poet immortal. 3. Mirrors: we watch ourselves grow old in mirrors. They bring us closer to death.\n\n\u2014Jean Cocteau, The Art of Cinema\n\nLe Testament d\u2019Orph\u00e9e\n\nIn the third part of the trilogy, Jean Cocteau himself portrays an 18th-century poet who travels through space time in search of divine knowledge. Lost in a mystical wilderness, he encounters ghosts and goddesses from the past who precipitate in his death and eventual resurrection.\n\nWith an eclectic ensemble that included Pablo Picasso, Yul Brynner and Jean Marais, this final instalment concludes Cocteau\u2019s Orphic journey into an examination of the torturous relationship between the artist and his work.\n\nIn Le Testament d\u2019Orph\u00e9e, events follow one another as they do in sleep, when our habits no longer control the forces within us or the logic of the unconscious, foreign to reason. A dream is strictly mad, strictly absurd, strictly magnificent and strictly atrocious. But no part of us ever judges it. We submit to it, without activating the abominable human tribunal that accords itself the right to condemn and absolve.\n\n\u2014Jean Cocteau, The Art of Cinema\n\nJean Cocteau\u2019s legacy\n\nThe postmodernist world which we now inhabit often scoffs at an artist\u2019s attempts to evoke Romantic sensibilities and poetic beauty for their own sake, preferring instead to exult the ironic, sarcastic and profane.\n\nAnd yet for those of us who yearn for a more sacred expression that embodies ethereal and experimental grandeur, the artistic oeuvre of Jean Cocteau is a sumptuous sleep from which I never wish to be awakened.\n\nWhen I make a film, it is a sleep in which I am dreaming. Only the people and places of the dream matter. I have difficulty making contact with others, as one does when half-asleep. If a person is asleep and someone else comes into the sleeper\u2019s room, this other person does not exist. He or she exists only if introduced into the events of the dream \u2026\n\n\u2014Jean Cocteau, The Art of Cinema\n\nPost Notes"}, {"url": "https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-5544208", "page_content": "JEAN HUGO (1894-1984) Trois personnages pour \"les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel\", pie de th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Jean Cocteau 1. titr\u00e9 'Un directeur' (en bas \u00e0 droite) 2. sign\u00e9 et dat\u00e9 'Jean Hugo 21' (en bas \u00e0 droite); titr\u00e9 et situ\u00e9 'La baigneuse.

Jean Hugo and Lauretta had seven children, several of whom have gone on to establish successful careers in the arts.\n\n\n\nJean Hugo's half-brother Fran\u00e7ois Hugo designed limited-edition jewellery interpretations for Pablo Picasso, Jean Cocteau, Max Ernst and Coco Chanel during the '20s Modern period.\n\n\n\nPierre Hugo \u2013 son of Fran\u00e7ois Hugo \u2013 is also a jewellery designer and has written a book about the artistic legacy of the Hugo family, Les Hugo \u2013 Un Temoignage (Rocher, France, 2007).\n\n\n\nHugo is predominantly known for his sketches and oil or gouache paintings, which are often executed in small formats. He also illustrated books, designed theatre sets and costumes and produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo designed the sets and costumes for Carl Theodor Dreyer's film The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928). His paintings can be viewed at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, and are also present in collections in London, Tokyo, Toronto, Paris, Marseille, and at the Musee Fabre in Montpellier, France \u2013 where there is room dedicated to his paintings.\n\n\n\nJean Hugo's painting is unique in the artistic panorama of the first half of the 20th century and maintains an authentic originality while evoking certain avant-garde themes of magical realism or metaphysical painting. At the start of the 1930s, in between na\u00efve and happy scenes and various theatrical projects \u2013 such as Jean Cocteau's Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel \u2013 he produced a series of masterful works in brooding, unsettling, tones (Solitude, 1933).\n\nThis is a part of the Wikipedia article used under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License (CC-BY-SA).

Cocteau is best known for his novel Les Enfants terribles (1929), and the films Blood of a Poet (1930), Les Parents terribles (1948), Beauty and the Beast (1946), and Orpheus (1949). His circle of associates, friends and lovers included Kenneth Anger, Pablo Picasso, Jean Hugo, Jean Marais, Henri Bernstein, Marlene Dietrich, Coco Chanel, Erik Satie, Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix, \u00c9dith Piaf and Raymond Radiguet.\n\n\n\nEarly Life\n\n\n\nCocteau was born in Maisons-Laffitte, Yvelines, a village near Paris, to Georges Cocteau and his wife, Eug\u00e9nie Lecomte; a socially prominent Parisian family. His father was a lawyer and amateur painter who committed suicide when Cocteau was nine. He left home at fifteen. He published his first volume of poems, Aladdin's Lamp, at nineteen. Cocteau soon became known in Bohemian artistic circles as The Frivolous Prince, the title of a volume he published at twenty-two. Edith Wharton described him as a man \"to whom every great line of poetry was a sunrise, every sunset the foundation of the Heavenly City...\"\n\n\n\nIn his early twenties, Cocteau became associated with the writers Marcel Proust, Andr\u00e9 Gide, and Maurice Barr\u00e8s. In 1912, he collaborated with L\u00e9on Bakst on Le Dieu bleu for the Ballets Russes; the principal dancers being Tamara Karsavina and Vaslav Nijinsky. During World War I Cocteau served in the Red Cross as an ambulance driver. This was the period in which he met the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, artists Pablo Picasso and Amedeo Modigliani, and numerous other writers and artists with whom he later collaborated. Russian choreographer Sergei Diaghilev persuaded Cocteau to write a scenario for a ballet, which resulted in Parade, in 1917. It was produced by Diaghilev, with sets by Picasso, the libretto by Apollinaire and the music by Erik Satie. The piece was later expanded into a full opera, with music by Satie, Poulenc and Ravel. \"If it had not been for Apollinaire in uniform,\" wrote Cocteau, \"with his skull shaved, the scar on his temple and the bandage around his head, women would have gouged our eyes out with hairpins.\" Cocteau denied being a Surrealist or being in any way attached to the movement. Cocteau wrote the libretto for Igor Stravinsky's opera-oratorio Oedipus Rex, which had its original performance in the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Sarah Bernhardt in Paris on May 30, 1927.\n\n\n\nAn important exponent of avant-garde art, Cocteau had great influence on the work of others, including the group of composers known as Les six. In the early twenties, he and other members of Les six frequented a wildly popular bar named Le Boeuf sur le Toit, a name that Cocteau himself had a hand in picking. The popularity was due in no small measure to the presence of Cocteau and his friends.\n\n\n\nFriendship with Raymond Radiguet\n\n\n\nIn 1918 he met the French poet Raymond Radiguet. They collaborated extensively, socialized, and undertook many journeys and vacations together. Cocteau also got Radiguet exempted from military service. In admiration of Radiguet's great literary talent, Cocteau promoted his friend's works in his artistic circle and also arranged for the publication by Grasset of Le Diable au corps (a largely autobiographical story of an adulterous relationship between a married woman and a younger man), exerting his influence to have the novel awarded the \"Nouveau Monde\" literary prize. Some contemporaries and later commentators thought there might have been a romantic component to their friendship. Cocteau himself was aware of this perception, and worked earnestly to dispel the notion that their relationship was sexual in nature.\n\n\n\nThere is disagreement over Cocteau's reaction to Radiguet's sudden death in 1923, with some claiming that it left him stunned, despondent and prey to opium addiction. Opponents of that interpretation point out that he did not attend the funeral (he generally did not attend funerals) and immediately left Paris with Diaghilev for a performance of Les noces (The Wedding) by the Ballets Russes at Monte Carlo. Cocteau himself much later characterised his reaction as one of \"stupor and disgust.\" His opium addiction at the time, Cocteau said, was only coincidental, due to a chance meeting with Louis Laloy, the administrator of the Monte Carlo Opera. Cocteau's opium use and his efforts to stop profoundly changed his literary style. His most notable book, Les Enfants terribles, was written in a week during a strenuous opium weaning. In Opium: Journal of drug rehabilitation (Opium : Journal d'une d\u00e9sintoxication), he recounts the experience of his recovery from opium addiction in 1929. His account, which includes vivid pen-and-ink illustrations, alternates between his moment-to-moment experiences of drug withdrawal and his current thoughts about people and events in his world. Cocteau was supported throughout his recovery by his friend and correspondent philosopher Jacques Maritain. Under Maritain's influence Cocteau made a temporary return to the sacraments of the Catholic Church.\n\n\n\nThe Human Voice\n\n\n\nCocteau's experiments with the human voice peaked with his play La Voix humaine. The story involves one woman on stage speaking on the telephone with her (invisible and inaudible) departing lover, who is leaving her to marry another woman. The telephone proved to be the perfect prop for Cocteau to explore his ideas, feelings, and \"algebra\" concerning human needs and realities in communication.\n\n\n\nCocteau acknowledged in the introduction to the script that the play was motivated, in part, by complaints from his actresses that his works were too writer/director-dominated and gave the players little opportunity to show off their full range of talents. La Voix humaine was written, in effect, as an extravagant aria for Madame Berthe Bovy. Before came Orph\u00e9e, later turned into one of his more successful films; after came La Machine infernale, arguably his most fully realized work of art. La Voix humaine is deceptively simple\u2014a woman alone on stage for almost one hour of non-stop theatre speaking on the telephone with her departing lover. It is, in fact, full of theatrical codes harking back to the Dadaists' Vox Humana experiments after World War One, Alphonse de Lamartine's \"La Voix humaine\", part of his larger work Harmonies po\u00e9tiques et religieuses and the effect of the creation of the Vox Humana (\"voix humaine\"), an organ stop of the Regal Class by Church organ masters (late 16th century) that attempted to imitate the human voice but never succeeded in doing better than the sound of a male chorus at a distance.\n\n\n\nReviews varied at the time and since but whatever the critique, the play represents Cocteau's state of mind and feelings towards his actors at the time: on the one hand, he wanted to spoil and please them; on the other, he was fed up by their diva antics and was ready for revenge. It is also true that none of Cocteau's works has inspired as much imitation: Francis Poulenc's opera La Voix humaine, Gian Carlo Menotti's \"opera bouffa\" The Telephone and Roberto Rosselini's film version in Italian with Anna Magnani L'Amore (1948). There has also been a long line of interpreters including Simone Signoret, Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullmann (in the play) and Julia Migenes (in the opera).\n\n\n\nAccording to one theory about how Cocteau was inspired to write La Voix humaine, he was experimenting with an idea by fellow French playwright Henri Bernstein.\n\n\n\nMaturity\n\n\n\nIn the 1930s, Cocteau had an affair with Princess Natalie Paley, the beautiful daughter of a Romanov grand duke and herself a sometimes actress, model, and former wife of couturier Lucien Lelong. She became pregnant. To Cocteau's distress and Paley's life-long regret, the baby was aborted[citation needed]. Cocteau's longest-lasting relationships were with the French actors Jean Marais and \u00c9douard Dermit, whom Cocteau formally adopted. Cocteau cast Marais in The Eternal Return (1943), Beauty and the Beast (1946), Ruy Blas (1947), and Orpheus (1949).\n\n\n\nBiographer James S. Williams describes Cocteau's politics as \"naturally Right-leaning.\" During the Nazi occupation of France, Cocteau's friend Arno Breker convinced him that Adolf Hitler was a pacifist and patron of the arts with France's best interests in mind. In his diary, Cocteau accused France of disrespect towards Hitler and speculated on the F\u00fchrer's sexuality. Cocteau effusively praised Breker's sculptures in an article entitled 'Salut \u00e0 Breker' published in 1942. This piece caused him to be arraigned on charges of collaboration after the war, though he was cleared of any wrongdoing and had in fact used his contacts to attempt to save friends such as Max Jacob.\n\n\n\nIn 1940, Le Bel Indiff\u00e9rent, Cocteau's play written for and starring \u00c9dith Piaf, was enormously successful. He also worked with Pablo Picasso on several projects and was friends with most of the European art community. Cocteau's films, most of which he both wrote and directed, were particularly important in introducing the avant-garde into French cinema and influenced to a certain degree the upcoming French New Wave genre.\n\n\n\nCocteau is best known for his novel Les Enfants terribles (1929), and the films Blood of a Poet (1930), Les Parents terribles (1948), Beauty and the Beast (1946), and Orpheus (1949).\n\n\n\nIn 1945, Cocteau was one of several designers who created sets for the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Mode. He drew inspiration from filmmaker Ren\u00e9 Clair while making Tribute to Ren\u00e9 Clair: I Married a Witch. The maquette is described in his \"Journal 1942-1945,\" in his entry for February 12, 1945:\n\n\n\nI saw the model of my set. Fashion bores me, but I am amused by the set and fashion placed together. It is a smoldering maid's room. One discovers an aerial view of Paris through the wall and ceiling holes. It creates vertigo. On the iron bed lies a fainted bride. Behind her stand several dismayed ladies. On the right, a very elegant lady washes her hands in a flophouse basin. Through the unhinged door on the left, a lady enters with raised arms. Others are pushed against the walls. The vision provoking this catastrophe is a bride-witch astride a broom, flying through the ceiling, her hair and train streaming.\n\n\n\nCocteau was openly gay. His muse and lover for over 25 years was actor Jean Marais.\n\n\n\nCocteau died of a heart attack at his chateau in Milly-la-For\u00eat, Essonne, France, on 11 October 1963 at the age of 74. It is said that upon hearing of the death of his friend, the French singer \u00c9dith Piaf the same day, he choked so badly that his heart failed. He is buried beneath the floor of the Chapelle Saint Blaise Des Simples in Milly-la-For\u00eat. The epitaph on his gravestone set in the floor of the chapel reads: \"I stay with you\" (\"Je reste avec vous\").\n\n\n\nHonours and awards\n\n\n\nIn 1955 Cocteau was made a member of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise and The Royal Academy of Belgium.\n\n\n\nDuring his life Cocteau was commander of the Legion of Honor, Member of the Mallarm\u00e9 Academy, German Academy (Berlin), American Academy, Mark Twain (U.S.A) Academy, Honorary President of the Cannes film festival, Honorary President of the France-Hungary Association and President of the Jazz Academy and of the Academy of the Disc.\n\n\n\nJean Cocteau's Works:\n\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\n\nLe Sang d'un po\u00e8te (The Blood of a Poet) (1930)\n\nL'\u00c9ternel retour (The Eternal Return) (1943)\n\nLa Belle et la B\u00eate (Beauty and the Beast) (1946)\n\nL'Aigle \u00e0 deux t\u00eates (The Eagle with Two Heads) (1948)\n\nLes Parents terribles (The Storm Within) (1948)\n\nCoriolan (1950) never released\n\nOrph\u00e9e (Orpheus) (1950)\n\nLa Villa Santo-Sospir (1952)\n\n8 \u00d7 8: A Chess Sonata in 8 Movements (1957) co-director, experimental film\n\nLe Testament d'Orph\u00e9e (The Testament of Orpheus) (1960)\n\n\n\nLiterature\n\n\n\nPoetry\n\n\n\n1909 La Lampe d'Aladin\n\n1910 Le Prince frivole\n\n1912 La Danse de Sophocle\n\n1919 Ode \u00e0 Picasso \u2013 Le Cap de Bonne-Esp\u00e9rance\n\n1920 Escale.

Cocteau\u2019s artistic practice was closely tied to his roles as an instigator and patron of the visual and literary French avant-gardes, as well as a socialite.\n\nBorn into a cultured, bourgeois Parisian family, Cocteau belonged to an influential social network that also introduced him to important developments in modern art. In particular, during the years 1910\u201312, Cocteau met the writer Andr\u00e9 Gide, the aristocratic patron of modern painting and music Count Etienne de Beaumont, and the socialite and patron Misia Sert. Through Sert, he was introduced to the experimental world of the Ballets Russes, run by Sergei Diaghilev, which included the renowned dancer Vaslav Nijinsky as well as the composer Igor Stravinsky. In 1912 Cocteau became involved in the conception and staging of many groundbreaking Ballets Russes productions. His most celebrated early work, Parade, was conceived during a trip in Italy with Pablo Picasso, and was staged by Diaghilev at the Paris-based Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in May 1917. The ballet was a modernist fusion of the arts, bringing together a scenario by Cocteau, the music of Erik Satie, sets and costumes by Picasso, and choreography by L\u00e9onide Massine. Among Cocteau\u2019s subsequent theatrical collaborations were Le Boeuf sur le toit, a short musical farce with music by Darius Milhaud and sets by Raoul Dufy that premiered in 1920, and Les Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel, with a collective score by the group of young composers known as Les Six (Georges Auric, Louis Durey, Arthur Honegger, Darius Milhaud, Francis Poulenc, and Germaine Tailleferre) and designs by Jean Hugo, staged by the Ballets Su\u00e9dois in 1921.\n\nBy the 1920s Cocteau\u2019s writings and drawings, which he had started making around 1917, played a key role in modernism\u2019s return to classical themes. Like many other artists and poets during this time period, he demonstrated a renewed interest in Catholicism spearheaded by the philosopher Jacques Maritain. In 1925 Cocteau\u2019s first major drama, Orph\u00e9e, a synthesis of antiquity and modernism, fantasy and reality, reached the stage in Paris. The following year Cocteau published Le Rappel \u00e0 l\u2019ordre: discipline et libert\u00e9, the title of which has come to stand for the general trend toward classicism in the arts of the 1920s.\n\nFrom 1925, Cocteau stayed for extended periods in Villefranche-sur-Mer. There, he established connections with many artists and patrons living in the south of France and began to incorporate Mediterranean imagery into his work. With the financial backing of art patron Charles de Noailles, in 1930 Cocteau directed his first film, Le sang d\u2019un po\u00e8te, which marked the beginning of a long-lasting engagement with this medium. Though Cocteau was recognized as a prominent artist later in his life, he never stopped collaborating with more emerging talents, including the actor Jean Marais, who gained fame after starring in Cocteau\u2019s 1946 movie adaptation of La Belle et la b\u00eate, and the painter Raymond Moretti. In 1953, Cocteau served as president of the jury of the Cannes Film Festival and continued to work in film until late in his life; his final movie, Le Testament d'Orph\u00e9e, was produced by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut in 1960."}, {"url": "https://www.sothebys.com/en/artists/jean-cocteau", "page_content": "French artist Jean Cocteau was a hugely influential figure of the Dada and Surrealist movements of the twentieth century. His poetry, films, paintings, prints, stage designs and criticism constitute a towering oeuvre of experimental and innovative work of the European avant-garde.\n\nBorn in 1889 in Maisons-Laffitte, France, Cocteau to an upper-class Parisian family. At fifteen, Cocteau left home and began writing poetry. Largely self-taught, he worked through trends of Cubism and Surrealism to engage in the philosophical questioning of human existence in relation to Christianity, psychoanalysis, sexuality, industrialization and the changing face of humankind as a result of modernization. He came into contact with the artists of the avant-garde, with whom he would sustain life-long relationships, including Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani and Andr\u00e9 Gide. Among his major early works was Parade, his scenario for a ballet produced by Sergei Diaghilev, in collaboration with Picasso, Erik Satie and Guillaume Apollinaire. He began experimenting with the notion of the human voice through the use of the telephone as a secondary character in theater. His feature films stand as quintessential pillars of early French Cinema, including Les Parents Terribles, Orph\u00e9e and La Belle et la B\u00eate.\n\nHis friendships with major cultural and artistic figures and his influence over subsequent artists is apparent in the many tributes, testimonials and painted portraits of Cocteau from friends and colleagues including Edith Piaf, Picasso and Federico de Madrazo y Ochoa. His epic life and mythic character were confirmed by his prestigious accolades; he became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, the German Academy, the Royal Academy of Belgium, the American Academy and the Mark Twain Academy. He was a commander of the Legion of Honor, and Honorary President of the Cannes Film Festival. His works can be found in the Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery and the Courtauld Institute of Art.\n\nRead Less"}]}
