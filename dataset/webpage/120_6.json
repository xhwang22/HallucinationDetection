E. Afigbo, Obi Ikenga: The Case for a Pan-Igbo Centre for Igbo Studies(Uturu, Nigeria: Abia State University, 2000).\n\nThe Ahiajoku Lecture Series, which was inaugurated on November 30, 1979, was designed to offer the Igbo a rare opportunity to annually gather and harness the intellectual richness of the people through public lectures by the most erudite of Igbo scholars. It is an annual intellectual harvest in which a distinguished Igbo scholar is selected to educate and share an important aspect of Igbo life and culture related to the lecturer\u2019s expertise. Thus, Ahiajoku lecturers have focused on Igbo political, economic, cultural, social, technological, philosophical and historical experiences, as well as the people\u2019s interactions and encounters with non-Igbo ethnic groups in Nigeria, and with the Europeans. It is an occasion to celebrate the collective Igbo achievements.\n\nFor more information on this Directorate, see Arthur A. Nwankwo, Nigeria: The Challenge of Biafra, 3rd edition (Enugu, Nigeria: Fourth Dimension Publishers, 1980), 26\u201328.\n\nOnwuka Njoku, \u201cExploring a Darkly Tunnel: Twenty-Six Years of Afigbo at Nsukka, 1966\u20131992,\u201d in Toyin Falola and Adam Paddock, eds., Emergent Themes and Methods in African Studies: Essays in Honor of Adiele E.

It is expected of an effective teacher or professor to strive to accommodate his or her students\u2019 individual differences and needs. But Afigbo was not for the mediocre or even average students. You must be above average and hardworking in order to survive Afigbo\u2019s scrutiny. The author started her doctoral thesis with Professor Afigbo, but did not complete the work with him due to no fault of theirs. Afigbo and the author worked very hard to complete the thesis, but it was not possible due to his retirement from the university in 1992.\n\nSee, for instance, E. Isichei, A History of the Igbo People(London: Macmillan, 1976), xiv. Here, she thanked Afigbo for the material he lent her and for giving her \u201cthe most unstinted and generous encouragement in a field of study which he has done so much to transform.\u201d\n\nBooks published by Adiele Afigbo, The Abolition of the Slave Trade in Southeastern Nigeria, 1885\u20131950(Rochester, NY: University of Rochester Press, 2006); The Igbo and their Neighbours: Inter-Group Relations in Southeastern Nigeria to 1953(Ibadan, Nigeria: University Press Limited, 1987); with S.

This prejudicial characterization of the region and the period suggests a lawless and unstable atmosphere incapable of fostering any meaningful commercial and intergroup exchanges. Yet, historical accounts have shown that the Aro, Awka, Abiriba, Nkwerre, Aboh, Nike, Nri, Igala, Ijo, Bonny, Nembe, Brass and the Efik triumphed in their business careers before the 1900.\n\nFor the practice of Igbandu, see Felicia Ekejiuba, \u201cIgba Ndu: An Igbo Mechanism of Social Control and Adjustment,\u201d African Notes8, no. 1 (1972): 9\u201324.\n\nSee Richard Henderson, The King in Every Man: Evolutionary Trends in Onitsha Ibo Society and Culture(New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1972); Austin Shelton, The Igbo-Igala Borderland: Religion and Social Control in Indigenous African Colonialism(Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1971); and John Boston, \u201cNotes on Contact between the Igala and the Ibo,\u201d Journal of the Historical Society of Nigeria2, no. 1 (1960): 52\u201358 on the impact of Igala culture on Nsukka Igbo; Basden, Niger Ibos on the Ijo and the conquest of southern Igbo; Mervin D.

Themes emphasised include pre-colonial and colonial history, inter-group relations, the Aro and the slave trade, the art and science of history in Africa, and nation-building.\n\nNigerian historian (1937-2009)\n\nQuick facts: Adiele Eberechukwu Afigbo, Born, Died, Academ... \u25bc\n\nAfigbo took up his career as a historian in the 1950s with the celebrated Ibadan School of History, which for about three decades was the most prominent school of history in Africa. He became a prominent member of that school, which devoted its time to demonstrating the need for African history and historiography as specific genres of the world history. In pursuing the mission of this school through teaching and scholarly work, Afigbo produced works that established reconstructionist history, of African historical methodologies, and links between history and statecraft. He gave rein to eclecticism of sources and methods, using as the occasion demands and warrants elements from myth, oral sources, from archaeology, linguistics, material artefacts and written sources. In the last analysis he defined a historian as a clinical student of human experience who seeks to tell the story as it is and to explain it.[citation needed]"}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230116689_5", "page_content": "For the genesis of the Aro and their trade network during the second half of the seventeenth century, see Felicia Ekejiuba, \u201cThe Aro Trade System in the 19th Century,\u201d Ikenga: International Journal of African Studies, 1.1 (1972), 11\u201326, and Ukwu (1967), 651.\n\nSee also Kenneth Dike and Felicia Ekejiuba, The Aros of South-eastern Nigeria, 1650\u20131980: A Study of Socio-economic Formation and Transformation in Nigeria (Ibadan: Ibadan University Press Ltd., 1990).\n\nFor example, Adiele Afigbo, \u201cTrade and Trade Routes in Nineteenth Century Nsukka,\u201d in Toyin Falola (ed.), Igbo History and Culture: The Essays of Adiele Afigbo (Trenton: African World Press Inc. 2005), 533\u201367. Afigbo noted that Nuskka people and their Northern Igala and Idoma neighbors had traded with each other for many centuries before the genesis of the Aro trade network. For the pre-Aro trade in Ngwa area see Oriji (1982), 523\u201348, and (1983), 311\u201328, and for Igboland, see Ukwu (1967), 647\u201362. It is noteworthy that during the Aro trade network, many Igbo people versed in long-distance trade sold their slaves directly to the riverain traders on the Lower Imo and Niger Rivers. For example, Jaja of Opobo was sold to an Akwete trader by an Amaigbo man who had kidnapped him, before the former resold him to a Bonny middleman. Many Ngwa, Asa, Ndoki, Owerri, and other communities located near the riverain towns also traded directly with coastal middlemen.\n\nSimon Ottenberg, Farmers and Townspeople in a Changing Nigeria: Abakaliki during Colonial Times (1905\u20131960) (Ibadan: Spectrum Books, 2005), 27.\n\nJames Roark, Michael Johnson et al., The American Promise: A History of the United States Vol.1: to1877 (Boston: Bedford Books, 1998), 102\u2013108.\n\nPhilip Curtin, The Tropical Atlantic in the Age of the Slave Trade (Washington D.C.: American Historical Association, 1991), 30.\n\nDavid Eltis and David Richardson, \u201cWest Africa and the Transatlantic Slave Trade: New Evidence of Long-Run Trends\u201d in David Eltis and David Richardson (eds.), Routes to Slavery: Direction, Ethnicity and Mortality (London: Frank Cass, 1997), 21.\n\nDouglas Chambers, \u201cMy Own Nation: Igbo Exiles in Diaspora,\u201d in Eltis and Richardson, op. cit., 75. For a statistical study of the Virginian slave exports from Africa see Walter Michinton, Celia King and Peter Waite, Virginia Slave-Trade Statistics 1698\u20131775 (Richmond: Virginia State Library, 1984). The problem of determining slaves of Igbo origin is difficult to resolve since European slave traders generically applied the concept \u201cIgbo\u201d to slaves they exported from the Bight of Biafra, even though the slaves might belong to the Ijo, Ibibio, Igala, and other ethnic nationalities. As an illustration, during the nineteenth century, those who were labeled Igbo slaves, constituting about 5 percent\u201325 percent of the total slave exports, were Nupe, Kankanda, and Hausa peoples. David Eltis and David Richardson, \u201cThe Numbers Game and Routes to Slavery,\u201d in Eltis and Richardson op. cit., 11, have rightly noted that the \u201cconcept of ethnicity [during the slave trade], was more pliable than has sometimes been assumed.\u201d Scholars therefore disagree on their estimates of Igbo slave exports. For example, Inikori, Lovejoy, and Chambers have given different estimates of the total number of Igbo slaves exported during the Trans-Atlantic slave trade\u201433.30 percent, 60 percent, and 80 percent respectively.\n\nSee Joseph Inikori, \u201cThe Sources of Supply for the Atlantic Slave Exports from the Bight of Benin and the Bight of Bonny (Biafra),\u201d Sierge Daget (ed.), De la Traite a l\u2019Esclavage: Acts du Colloque International sur la Traite des Noirs, 3 vols.

They have called for a return to the biographical studies of slaves that portray their historical experiences, such as those of O. Equiano, Fredrick Douglass and others.\n\nSee Chapter 4, and Victor Uchendu, \u201cSlaves and Slavery in Igboland,\u201d in S. Miers and I.

In the last analysis he defined a historian as a clinical student of human experience who seeks to tell the story as it is and to explain it.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nAfigbo was born at Ihube, Okigwe, in present-day Imo State. His formal education began in 1944 at Methodist Central School, Ihube where he came under the influence of remarkably dedicated teachers, the most outstanding of whom was Mr. Oji Iheukumere, the head teacher, a native of Uzuakoli, in today's Abia State who was a noted church musician and disciplinarian. At Ihube Central School Afigbo's brilliance manifested early which made his teachers encourage him to go to secondary school in spite of the opposition of his parents who were intimidated by the cost of post-primary education. He succeeded in his bid and went to St. Augustine's (CMS) Grammar School, Nkwerre Orlu in Imo State. with an Okigwe Native Administration scholarship won in a competitive examination. There again he came across a crop of teachers who left a definite imprint on him. Foremost among those were Mazi F,C. Ogbalu, a teacher of Igbo language and culture and the founder of the Society for The Promotion of Igbo Language and Culture, C.G.I. Eneli a history graduate of the University College, Ibadan and E. C. Ezekwesili, the principal of the college and a history graduate of the University of Southampton, UK. These three helped to determine his future academic career. From St. Augustine's Grammar School Afigbo gained admission to study history at University College, Ibadan (then affiliated with University of London), with a scholarship from the government of Eastern Nigeria. There again, he met scholars noted for their brilliance and beneficent influence \u2013 J.D. Omer-Cooper, J.C. Anene, J.F. Ade Ajayi and K.O. Dike. There were also his colleagues \u2013 Obaro Ikime and Philip Igbafe who not only read history with him, but with him went on to pioneer the \"made in Nigeria PhD\" at the infant University of Ibadan with the help of post-graduate scholarships awarded by the university to the best graduating students. Adiele Afigbo had not only graduated top of his class, but also was the first among his colleagues to complete his PhD With this, he became the first person ever to receive a doctoral degree from a Nigerian university.\n\nEarly career\n\nOn obtaining the PhD, Afigbo was appointed a lecturer in history, a position he held for two years before fleeing to the University of Nigeria, Nsukka in the wake of the Nigerian civil war. During the duration of hostilities, he served in the Directorate for Propaganda of the Ministry of Information, Republic of Biafra. He resumed his interrupted academic duties after the war, and rose on the academic ladder \u2013 from Lecturer to Professor in 1972, thus reaching the top of his profession after only five years. A year after attaining to professorship, he was appointed the Head of the Department of History and Archaeology. The year after, he became also the Dean of the Faculty of Arts. On more than one occasion he held the Directorship of the Leo Hansbury Institute of African Studies. He held the following public appointments among others \u2013 pioneer Director of Research at the National Institute for policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru, Jos; Commissioner first for Education and then for Local Government in the Government of Imo State; Chairman of the Michael Okpara College of Agriculture, Umuagwo in Imo State and Sole Administrator of the Alvan Ikoku College of Education, Owerri. He has also was awarded an Honorary Member of the Historical Association of Great Britain, Fellow of the Historical Society of Nigeria, the Nigerian National Order of Merit, the Fellowship of the Nigerian Academy of Letters. His traditional chieftaincy titles include Ogbute-Okewe-Ibe, Ogbuzuo, and Olaudah.\n\nWork as historian\n\nAfigbo was a historian of Africa, of Nigeria, of Southeastern Nigeria, and finally a historian of the Igbo. He was a political historian, an economic and social historian, and of historiography. Myth, History and Society, one of the three volumes of his essays edited by Toyin Falola is devoted to theorising on the methods of doing history in Africa, on the sources of history in Africa, on the place and purpose of history in Africa and other related issues. In many publications he sought to use the particular to illuminate the universal, and the universal to illuminate the particular. Thus, for instance, he used a detailed study of the textile process in Southern Nigeria to throw much helpful light on the socio-cultural dynamics of the societies of the region. In a similar manner he used the rise and expansion of the pre-colonial great states such as Benin to show that the so-called segmentary societies as well as the so-called mini-states of pre-colonial Africa are, among other things, fossilised reminders of the conditions from which the great states arose.\n\nAfigbo broke away from the action-reaction thesis that ruled the new African historiography when he joined the history profession. He did so by emphasising in his works basic reconstructionist history, the study of peoples and cultures in their own right.\n\nDeath\n\nAdiele Eberechukwu Afigbo died in Enugu, Nigeria in the early hours of Monday, 9 March 2009 after a brief illness.\n\nWorks\n\nThe Warrant Chiefs: Indirect Rule in Southeastern Nigeria 1891\u20131929 (Longman, London, 1972)\n\n1891\u20131929 (Longman, London, 1972) Ropes of Sand: Studies in Igbo History and Culture (University Press Limited, Ibadan 1981)\n\n(University Press Limited, Ibadan 1981) The Igbo and Their Neighbours: Inter-group Relations In Southeastern Nigeria to 1953 (University Press Limited, Ibadan, 1987)\n\n(University Press Limited, Ibadan, 1987) Groundwork of Igbo History (Vista Books Limited, Lagos, 1992)\n\n(Vista Books Limited, Lagos, 1992) Image of the Igbo (Vista Books Limited, Lagos, 1992)\n\n(Vista Books Limited, Lagos, 1992) The Abolition of the Slave Trade in Southeastern Nigeria 1885\u20131950 (University of Rochester Press, 2006)\n\nCollected Works Edited by Toyin Falola"}, {"url": "https://atqnews.com/africa-my-great-grandfather-sold-slaves-nigerian-journalist-reveals/", "page_content": "Please leave this field empty\n\nOh hi there\n\nIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\n\nSign up to receive awesome news in your inbox, every time we post.\n\nEmail Address *\n\nWe don\u2019t spam!

This prejudicial characterization of the region and the period suggests a lawless and unstable atmosphere incapable of fostering any meaningful commercial and intergroup exchanges. Yet, historical accounts have shown that the Aro, Awka, Abiriba, Nkwerre, Aboh, Nike, Nri, Igala, Ijo, Bonny, Nembe, Brass and the Efik triumphed in their business careers before the 1900.\n\nFor the practice of Igbandu, see Felicia Ekejiuba, \u201cIgba Ndu: An Igbo Mechanism of Social Control and Adjustment,\u201d African Notes8, no. 1 (1972): 9\u201324.\n\nSee Richard Henderson, The King in Every Man: Evolutionary Trends in Onitsha Ibo Society and Culture(New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1972); Austin Shelton, The Igbo-Igala Borderland: Religion and Social Control in Indigenous African Colonialism(Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1971); and John Boston, \u201cNotes on Contact between the Igala and the Ibo,\u201d Journal of the Historical Society of Nigeria2, no. 1 (1960): 52\u201358 on the impact of Igala culture on Nsukka Igbo; Basden, Niger Ibos on the Ijo and the conquest of southern Igbo; Mervin D.

Many archaeological sites and landscapes (both developed and undeveloped) abound in parts of South-eastern Nigeria with many of them being destroyed due to construction of roads, building of houses, vandalism, illegal activities of scavengers, erosion menace and other natural factors. Tourism on the other hand, is one of the major ways of preserving archaeological sites and harnessing them for meaningful economic gains. Indeed, tourism provides a springboard for harnessing the heritage resources of a people through conservation and subsequent promotion for sustainable socio-economic development.\n\nIn the past, issues and arguments have been raised on the workability of archaeology and tourism in solving human problems or impacting on the overall development of the human society. These have bordered on how the two concepts are related and how they can work harmoniously in solving socio-economic problems. The answers to the above issues can only be appreciated when archaeological investigations and findings along with the development of tourism sites and other related studies, are translated in solving some of the inherent challenges of the human environment in a developing nation like Nigeria, particularly southeast Nigeria. It is against this backdrop that the formation of a research group that will, through articulated archaeological and tourism investigations, contribute significantly in solving some basic human problems becomes imperative.\n\nIt is not out of place to say here that archaeology and tourism face serious personnel, structural and institutional challenges. While archaeologists are poorly funded, with limited resources and equipment to work with, those in the tourism industry are challenged by low level of infrastructural supply to designated tourist sites, inadequately developed or untapped tourist resources, and institutional factors among others. Landscape Conservation And Tourism Research Group (LaCTRG), as this group will be known, will explore the linkages between archaeology, tourism and development so as to seek ways of addressing emerging challenges.\n\nCOMPOSITION AND PROPOSED ACTIVITY SCOPE OF THE GROUP.\n\nThis research group will be domiciled in the Department of Archaeology and Tourism, University of Nigeria, Nsukka. It is a conglomeration of eminent professional researchers in various aspects of archaeology and tourism.\n\nThe group consists of the following members:\n\nName Sex Rank Designation Qualification Specialisation P.U.

Ugwuanyi Male Lecturer II Member M.A Heritage Studies, Public Archaeology and Tourism A. Eyisi Male Graduate Assistance Member/ Postgraduate Student M. A Tourism Planning and Development and Environmental Impact Assessment\n\nThemes to be addressed in this proposed research include, but not limited to Archaeological Excavations, Cultural Resource Management, Dating of Archaeological Findings, Heritage Tourism Planning and Development, Social and Environmental Impact Assessment, Corporate Social Responsibility, Public Archaeology, Archaeology and Tourism Sites Mapping, Archaeological Reconnaissance, Site Management and Sustainability.\n\nWe hope to be guided by the provisions of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and the Transformation Agenda of the Federal Government in our entire endeavour.\n\nPREVIOUS RESEARCH EXPERIENCE\n\nMembers of the Landscape Conservation And Tourism Research Group (LaCTRG) have participated and still participate in various individual and collective research programmes in areas not limited to tourism planning and development, environmental impact assessment, baseline studies, climate change and adaptation, community development, stakeholder management, heritage resource management, economic impacts of archaeology and tourism, archaeological investigations, site mapping and development, heritage studies, etc. Members have published some of these studies in high impact journals like West African Journal of Archaeology, Journal of Tourism and Heritage Studies, Nsukka Journal of the Humanities, Journal of Heritage Stewardship, Nigerian Journal of Social Research etc.\n\nCONTACT ADDRESS:\n\nc/o Professor Pat Uche Okpoko,\n\nDepartment of Archaeology and Tourism,\n\nUniversity of Nigeria, 410001 Nsukka\n\nEnugu State, Nigeria.\n\nTel: +2348069359951\n\nEmail: patrick.okpoko@unn.edu.ng\n\npatrick.okpoko@atdin.org\n\nMembers\n\nEYISI AFAMEFUNA PAUL\n\nPERSONAL DATA\n\nPLACE OF WORK: UNIVERSITY OF NIGERIA, NSUKKA\n\nPOSITION: GRADUATE ASSISTANT\n\nCOUNTRY: NIGERIA\n\nSTATE OF ORIGIN: ANAMBRA\n\nLOCAL GOVT.

The idea for a graduate Institute of African Studies in the University of Nigeria was channeled towards research and was designed as a rallying point for \u201call men of colour who can trace their descent to the African continent no matter in what part of the world they now find their habitation\u201d. (Afigbo, 1971:89). The establishment of the Hansberry College of African Studies in the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, was approved in September 1962 by the Governing Council of the University of Nigeria as a graduate Institution. The College was opened on September 23, 1963 with a four-day Seminar at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka campus, with the title, \u201cThe Emergence of African Political Thought.\u201d This Seminar was attended by eminent scholars and authorities on African studies from many places in Nigeria and overseas. The keynote address was delivered by Professor William Leo Hansberry, an eminent Afro-American Historian and Africanist, whose name the college bears and who was designated its Director. The Hansberry College was renamed Hansberry Institute of African Studies in 1964. Prof. William Leo Hansberry had taught Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe and Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, two students who later became first indigenous Presidents of their countries, Nigeria and Ghana, respectively.\n\nAs W.L. Hansberry, the Director, was not resident (but visiting Nsukka once in a while from the United States), his deputy, Professor Edward Wilmot Blyden III, an orator, Professor of Political Science and grandson of the famous Blyden, was made the acting director but later became the substantive director in 1964. (Onyeneke, 1984). Professor Blyden was a former Head of Department of Political Science in the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.\n\nIn the active part of this phase, before the outbreak of the civil war, the major activities included the following:\n\n1. Preparation of annotated Bibliography of Africana\n\n2. Preparation of Anthologies of Readings in Africana\n\n3. Acquisition of oral, written, pictorial and cartographic sources for the study of the government, society, history and religion of Nigeria\n\n4. Research into Biographies of eminent Nigerians\n\n5. Research into rise and growth of political ideas\n\n6. Research into History of Nigerian Journalism\n\n7. Establishment of a museum of antiquities\n\nProf. W.L. Hansberry (non-resident Director) 1963-64\n\nWhen Prof. Hansberry was the Director, the Institute organized lectures and symposia on various aspects of African history and culture. This was natural since Prof. Hansberry was an Afro-American scholar of the history and culture of black peoples. The Institute also embarked on the first three aspects of the first phase. These were one, preparation of annotated Bibliography of Africana, two, preparation of Anthologies of Readings in Africana, and, three, acquisition of oral, written, pictorial and cartographic sources for the study of the government, society, history and religion of Nigeria.\n\nHappenings in this first phase also included the empowering of the Institute of African Studies in 1963 to be a school for post-graduate research for the degree of Masters. It was to prepare and present candidates for post-graduate degrees in African Studies, on its own right. This programme was expanded by the Senate of the University on April 12, 1967 beyond Masters Degree by research to include Masters Degree by course work. The Institute followed this up by developing and advertising its post-graduate coursework programme. The Senate confirmation of its approval for the full teaching programme was given on July 21, 1970, after the Nigerian Civil War. In the 1970/71 session, failure to implement the programme was due to the poor state of equipment of the various departments of the University (e.g. history, geography etc) which were to be intimately involved in the programme. Again, rehabilitation after the civil war had not gone far enough.\n\nProf. Edward Wilmot Blyden III (Political Scientist) (Director) 1963-64\n\nAfter another unsuccessful bid in 1973/74 when the Institute had gone to the extent of admitting some candidates for their postgraduate programme, this programme was frozen. (Ukwu, 1986). During the Nigerian crisis of 1966, the Institute experienced improved staff position because of the influx of scholars of eastern Nigerian origin from other universities into the University of Nigeria.\n\nProf. SN Nwabara (Historian) acting Director (October 1966-71) substantive ( 1972-81)\n\nThe Institute was motivated to embark on a number of projects which would \u201chelp to realize the ideals of its founders\u201d (Afigbo, 1971:89). In 1967, as part of the preparatory process, the then Vice Chancellor, Prof. Eni Njoku, set up the first executive committee of the Institute \u201cwhose creation brought to an end what virtually had been the era of \u2018one man show\u2019 in the history of the Institute\u201d (Afigbo, 1971:89). Part of its duties was to advise the Director in the planning and execution of the research and teaching programmes of the Institute, and in the staff recruitment, development and conditions of service. Members were Dr. S.N. Nwabara (Chairman and acting Director of the IAS); Mr. E.B. Ndem (Sociology/Anthropology); Dr. D.D. Hartle (History/ Archeology); Dr. Kalu Ezera (Political Science); Dr. J.C. Ene (Natural History); Prof. J.C. Anene (History) and Mr. B.O. Nwabueze (Faculty of Law).\n\nAlso, during that period, the Institute started building up an ethnographic museum. There were also plans for the establishment of the Center for Creative Writing in the Institute which was to be staffed initially by Mr. (now Prof.) Chinua Achebe (already world-famed by then) and Mr. Christopher Okigbo, then a young poet of distinction. (Afigbo, 1971:89).\n\nThe Committee which became the first Advisory Board had hardly begun moves on the proposed M.A. teaching programme, on a new Institute Journal and on an ethnographic museum when the civil war broke out. (Onyeneke, 1984).\n\nIt is important to mention here that the great energy behind the founding of the Institute of African Studies, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Professor William Leo Hansberry, died while visiting relatives in Chicago. Prof. Hansberry died at Billings Hospital of a cerebral hemorrhage on November 3, 1965.\n\nThe war ended in 1970. Every plan and intention pre-war was lost. Afigbo (1971:90) narrates:\n\nBy the time the war ended not only the schemes projected for implementation in the 1967/68 session were abandoned, but the progress which had been made in the collection of rare documents and materials for research, as in assembling highly valued pieces of ancient art and material culture were frustrated. Much ground had been lost, the administrative records of the Institute destroyed, and some of the scholars perished. Among the irreparable losses in men were Professor J.C. Anene, who died from natural causes; the gifted poet, Christopher Okigbo, who died in action; the political scientist Professor Kalu Ezera\u2026and the sociologist Mr. E.B. Ndem, who was out of the country at the time hostilities came to an end and who has yet not been able to rejoin the staff of the University. The Institute had to begin again from the scratch.\n\nThe ethnographic materials (relics and artifacts), books and documents collected pre-war had been lost and dispersed, thus, this was essentially a reconstruction phase. The Executive Committee was reconstituted in 1970, with the place of the missing members being taken by the new appointees, comprised the following: Dr. S.N. Nwabara (Chairman), Professor EO Awa, Dr. JC Ene, Dr. CC Ifemesia, Professor ANA Modebe, Mr. BO Nwabueze and Mr. Elochukwu Amucheazi as Secretary. There was also Prof. G.O. Onuaguluchi (Medicine) and Dr. GEK Ofomata (Geography). It had the task of rehabilitation by reviving the projects already approved for the Institute and re-defining its objectives. These objectives were redefined as (i) recovering the past of the peoples of Africa, (ii) dealing with the current social problems and (iii) encouraging and projecting their living art and culture.\n\nA set of activities were then developed and they subsequently became the regular ones for the Institute:\n\n(i) the organization of (a.) public lectures (given by outstanding scholars of the University or by visiting scholars. A celebrated scholar, Prof. Chinua Achebe, became a senior research fellow of the Institute from 1970 to 1973. Until 2009, his office space was preserved in the Institute to memorialize him. The space also served as storeroom for editions of Okike, a literary journal he founded. Dr. C.C. Okereaffia and Mr. T.U. Nwala were also deployed from the General Studies around November 1971 to the Institute as Research Fellow in Language and Junior Research Fellow in Philosophy respectively), (b.) staff seminars (where academic staff of the University discussed their projected research schemes) and (c.) workshops (for teamwork on the study of different aspects of African culture, history and social problems),\n\n(ii) organization of individual research programmes of the research fellows of the Institute with research focus on the Igbo, the Efik/Ibibio, the Ijaw and the peoples of Ogoja,\n\n(iii) development of an ethnographic museum to hold artifacts, archeological pieces and remnants of the civil war showing the ways of life of the people. Part of this museum is a modern art gallery. This gallery has since hosted a succession of significant exhibitions,\n\n(iv) establishment of a research library which, today, holds documents, bibliographies, books and rare publications and the assembling of oral and written sources for African studies.\n\n(v) Issuance of Institute journals through the Institute\u2019s Publication Unit,\n\n(vi) a photographic unit, and,\n\n(vii) experiments in the performing arts.\n\nTHE YEARS: 1970-1976\n\nAmongst the main achievements of the Institute during the commando session or rehabilitation term (as March to June 1970 was popularly called in Nsukka) was the recruitment of more research staff into the Institute. In addition to the acting director, Dr. SN Nwabara and Mrs. K. Okonjo (research fellow in sociology) who were there before the war, the Institute acquired the services of Mr. Chinua Achebe (senior research fellow in literature), Miss Felicia Ifeoma Ekejiuba (research fellow in social anthropology), Mr. Meki Nzewi (research fellow in music & drama), Mr. JN Oriji (junior research fellow in history). (Afigbo, 1971:90).\n\nFor the experiments in performing arts, two musical dramas set in Nigerian culture were presented by the Institute to enthusiastic audiences across Nigeria. The dramas were \u201cA Drop of Honey\u201d and \u201cThe Lost Finger\u201d both by Meki Nzewi. \u201cA Drop of Honey\u201d was an award winning entry in the 1971 African Arts Competition organized by the African Center, University of California. Los Angeles. In 1973, the Institute organized, for the first time, a Cultural Arts Festival entitled \u201cIgeri\u201d. It was aimed at showcasing creativity and talent in dance-dramas of the past and present in Nigeria. The folk myth of life and death, and life in death was the theme. The Igeri burial music-dance-drama from Arochukwu was chosen. It is not clear whether the four-day drama and seminar were held as was planned.\n\nAt the end of the 1970/71 session, Dr. S.N. Nwabara left for the United States to help set up a programme of African studies. Dr. A.E. Afigbo was asked to act as director from July 1, 1971. The acting Director began to move the Institute from the stage of \u201cprojections\u201d to that of \u201cimplementation\u201d (Afigbo, 1971:91).\n\nIn the area of research, the Institute began to concentrate on the peoples and cultures of south-eastern Nigeria. As at that time, documentation of the ways of life of this region had not kept pace with those of the rest of Nigeria, and the University of Nigeria had the only facility in the area. (Ukwu, 1986:282).\n\nThe photographic Unit:\n\nThis Unit later became the Technical Services and Cinematographic Unit in the 1980\u2019s. It produced black and white photographs manned by one Mr. Nwankwo on Salary Level 5. He served in the Institute from about 1970 to about 1978. A skilled still photographer, Mr, Nwankwo used the studio space of the Unit for photographic laboratory work. The active period of use of this studio as a photo laboratory was from 1971 (after the Nigerian Civil War) to about 1978. Water was available at this time through pipes to the studio. The still photographer had a neat way of registering snapshots or films using a yellow file and jumbo cards such that films can be easily traced and developed and photographs can be easily located and handed over to their owners. A pile of about 400 copies of these yellow files are still available and are packed away in a file cabinet as at the moment. Because of the departure of Mr. Nwankwo to Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, in 1978 for a more serious and lucrative photographic engagement, the studio was abandoned. (Unaegbu, 2011). But before his departure, some items of equipment have been attracted to the studio, however obsolete. Among these items were a Bolex 16mm cine camera, which, was jammed badly and required overseas attention to make it operable. Aside from the cine camera, three twin lens, reflex, still cameras (very old), and photographic laboratory equipment were acquired.\n\nPublication Unit:\n\nFor the venture on journals, the Institute\u2019s Publication Unit began Ikoro, formerly Ikorok (so named from July 1971-March 1972, ending with Vol. 1, No.3. The first name was an Ibibio version of the Igbo Ikolo or Ikoro. It suggested by Mr. Udosen of Fine Arts). The Ikolo is a huge talking drum made from the trunk of an iroko tree used in spreading \u201cserious information as well as for celebration on ritual occasions\u201d. (Afigbo, 1971:91). The Ikoro bulletin was designed to publicize the work of the Institute and the researches going on within the University or elsewhere in Nigeria and beyond in the area of African studies. It appeared first as Ikorok in July 1971 and began to appear two times a year in January and July from the mid 1980\u2019s. It was first edited by Miss Felicia Ifeoma. Ekejiuba. At the same time, approval was given for the Institute to publish a journal titled Ikenga. Dr. (later Prof.) A.E. Afigbo served as its first editor. Other editorial board members included Dr. Edet A. Udo (associate-editor), Dr. S.N. Nwabara, Professor E.O. Awa, Professor J.C. Ene, Dr. C. Ogwurike, Dr. D.I. Nwoga, Professor B.N. Okigbo, Rev. E.C. Ilogu, Mr. S.C. Nwoye, Mr. V.C. Amaefulah (art-adviser) and Mr. J.N. Oriji (acting secretary).\n\nIkenga is a personal god of achievement whose physical representation, a figure with ram horns, symbolizes the strength of the right arm with which a man achieves greatness. The cultural artifact is common amongst the northern Igbo people; but it is by no means exclusively preserved there. The journal, Ikenga, was designed to showcase articles in all areas of African studies.\n\nAfigbo (1971:90) explains:\n\nIt is not committed to any political views, but is dedicated to encourage the application of the highest scholarship to the investigation of the achievements and setbacks of the blackman down the ages, as well as to the study of his contemporary problems and dilemmas.\n\nThe first issue appeared in September 1971.\n\nThe Publications Unit also produced a book under what was described as the Institute\u2019s Occasional Publications consisting generally of proceedings of workshops, seminars, public lectures and results of researches of the Institute\u2019s research fellows which was published by the Institute itself. These included the published public lectures of John Hunwick, the proceedings of the conference on Indigenous Laws called African Indigenous Laws edited by Drs. T.O. Elias and S. N. Nwabara in 1975. (Ukwu, 1986:283).The book ran through 376 pages and was launched on November 29, 1975 at Enugu Campus of the University by Mr. M. O. Balonwu, the then Chief Justice of the East Central State. (Ubah, 1976).\n\nAlso, Mr. Chinua Achebe, senior research fellow in literature, began to publish Okike, a new journal of creative writing, which, by 1971, had already recorded notable success.\n\nThe Institute Research Library:\n\nProf. S.N. Nwabara, one of the Directors of the Institute, once said in his foreword to a Library classified list book by Eleanor Mangold, \u201cFirst and foremost, the Research Library is a collection of materials for reference by research workers\u201d. (Nwabara, 1973).\n\nAfter the war, recovery of books and documents began again from scratch (no book) to 800 collections. Many were gifts donated by individuals and organizations and the Institute\u2019s own purchases, even though buying was severely restricted.\n\nMr. (now Prof.) Chinua Achebe\n\nSenior Research Fellow, IAS (1970-73)\n\nThe recovery was facilitated by three factors:\n\n1. The keen interest of the University authority in the work of rehabilitation.\n\n2. The generous gifts by friends of the Institute, particularly the programme of East African Studies, Syracuse University, New York, that made available from its holdings all the books and documents on East African countries, and,\n\n3. The voluntary services of Mrs. Eleanor Mangold as the Institute\u2019s honorary acting librarian (from August 1972 to April 1973). She authored Classified List 1. Some 470 titles were assembled together with 400 other publications comprising IAS publications, seminar and research papers, and a foundation collection of government document materials. The book was compiled both as a temporary substitute for a cataloguing guide and as a record of titles. (Nwabara, 1973).\n\nThe library became a place of study where researchers worked with the materials they might wish close at hand and unhindered by the movement and bustle of a larger and less intimate library. As a specialist library, it is meant to supplement the collections held at the Africana Division of the main library of the University. According to Prof. S.N. Nwabara, the library became \u201cthe vat from which history itself will be distilled in 50, 100, 500 years\u2019 time.\u201d How prophetic were his words as this present book was distilled from the \u201cvat\u201d (Nwabara, 1973).\n\nPublic Lectures:\n\nPublic lectures of the Institute during this phase included, Oral Literature delivered by Prof. Robert G. Armstrong (Director, Institute of African Studies, University of Ibadan, March 1971), The Study of African Politics by Mr. Ukpabi Asika (Administrator of the East Central State of Nigeria, May 1972), Igbo Ukwu Excavations by Prof. Thurstan Shaw (Department of Archeology, University of Ibadan, February 1972), The Role of Literacy in West African Moslem Society in the Pre-colonial Period by Prof. John Hunwick (University of Legon, Ghana, March 1972), The Development of Islamic Scholarship in its West African Environment by Prof. John Hunwick (March 1972).\n\nWorkshops and Seminars:\n\nWorkshops organized by the Institute during this phase (1970-75) included a. Igbo Language and Literature (1971); b. Nsukka: The Problems of Change and Continuity (1972); c. Peoples of South-Eastern Nigeria (1972); d. African Indigenous Laws (1974); e. Dependency and Underdevelopment in Western Africa (1974). The seminars/workshops were designed to garner data on specific areas in order to prepare the way for the launching of the \u201cfull-blown programme of the Institute\u201d, especially its focus on the peoples of Southeastern Nigeria. Efforts were made to assess very closely the research works which had already been concluded about the people of Southeastern Nigeria, map out important areas to embark upon and decide on methodologies.\n\nTo Afigbo (1971:92):\n\nThis is necessary as a way of high-lighting the immensity of the problems which will remain to be tackled in the study of these peoples, avoiding unnecessary duplication of effort and questioning some of the cozy positions which some of us are already tending to assume with regard to the past and current problems of this area. It would also help to effect economy by ensuring that the little money and manpower available are not spent on issues which have long ceased to be problems.\n\nInstitute Museum:\n\nBy January 1975, one John Onyishi stated that the Institute museum collection had \u201cgrown from the initial hundred pieces to\u2026 over four hundred specimens of antiquities\u201d. Serially numbered, there are some 404 art/ cultural objects physically lodged in the museum. These resource materials had very scanty information for accession. (Uche-Okeke, 1984). Exhibitions at the Institute\u2019s museum and art gallery during this period included, Drawings and Paintings by Prof. Uche Okeke (December 1972), Two Thousand Years of Chinese Paintings by UNESCO (February 1974), Deep Etchings, Lino Cuts, Bronzed Lino Reliefs and Paintings by Bruce Omobrakpeya (April 1974), Graphics by Dr. Nick Wilkinson (April 1974), Leo Frobenius 1938 by Institute of Foreign Cultural Relations/ Frobenius Institute, Odunke Art Exhibition by Uzo Ndubisi (November 1974), National Role in Modern Mass Communication- Sculptures, drawings, prints and poems by U. Uko Akpaide (November 1974), AFAAS\u2019s Week Exhibition by Association of Fine and Applied Arts (March 1975), Dyed Fabric, Wall hangings, Burnt-Scorched Wooden Wall, Plaques exhibition by Ego Okeke, El Anatsui, Uche Okeke and Onyebuchi Okadigwe (May 1975), Sessional Examination Exhibition by Department of Fine and Applied Arts, UNN (June 1975), Jigida Paintings by Bons Nwabiani (June 1975). (Ukwu, 1986).\n\nA Dictionary of Igbo Proverbs Project:\n\nThis was begun in the Institute of African Studies at about 1973, championed by D.I. Nwoga. For a proper understanding of the workings of the Igbo mind, a study of Igbo proverbs is crucial. Additionally, proverbs represent major imaginative activities which are literary in their impact. It is not surprising therefore, that most Igbo writers, whether writing in Igbo or English, have incorporated proverbs from the oral traditions into their works. Moreover, future generations of Igbo people and people interested in Igbo need some permanent record of these units of Igbo imagination and wisdom. Though the project was initiated in the early 70\u2019s, and preliminary collections were made with the aid of students of English Department and a research grant of N2000 from the Imo State Cultural Division of the Ministry of Information, Youth and Culture, Owerri, it had not been possible to pay adequate attention towards implementing a major part of the project. (Nwoga, 1984).\n\nAs at 1971, the Institute had just ten scholars who were also working on very important projects. They included:\n\nDr. S.N. Nwabara (Director) (Research Project: A Century of British Contact with the Igbo, 1860-1960), Afigbo (Senior Research Fellow in History) (A history of Nsukka), Chinua Achebe (Senior Research Fellow, Literature) (African Revolutionary literature from Olaudah Equiano to the present day) (Igbo Verse and Drama), Edet A. Udo (Senior Research Fellow in History) (The Efik-Ibibio in the pre-colonial period), C.O. Okoreaffia (Senior Research Fellow, History) (Igbo language Studies), Miss Felicia Ifeoma Ekejiuba (Research Fellow, Social Anthropology) (The Area of South eastern Nigeria), Elochukwu Amucheazi (research fellow, political science) (Political dynamics in Eastern Nigeria with Emphasis on the pressure groups, Particularly on the role of the church in the politics of Eastern Nigeria), Mrs. Kamene Okonjo (research fellow, sociology) (The role of women in social change), Meki Nzewi (research fellow, Music and Drama) (Synthesis of music, dance and drama in contemporary Nigerian theatre), and, John N. Oriji (junior research fellow, History) (A history of Ngwa people). In 1975, the Institute was blessed with another notable researcher in Law, Barrister JC Aghaji.\n\nEarly Collaborations:\n\nThe Institute remarkably had early contacts and encouragements from the Institute of African Studies, University of Ibadan and the Department of Archeology of the same University; the Historical Society of Ghana; the Scandinavian Institute of African Studies; the Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Afrika-Forschung, Hamburg; the Institut National des Langues et Civilizations Orientales, universit\u00e9 de la Sorbonne Nouvelle ; the Federal Department of Antiquities, Lagos, the Summer Institute of Linguistics (British School), Surrey; the Centre of African Studies, University of Warsaw (Poland), and the Makerere Institute of Social Research, Kampala (Afigbo, 1971:92).\n\nTHE YEARS 1976-85\n\nAs more universities and more states were created, the Institute\u2019s programmes came to specialize on the Igbo people and their neighbours. The long tenure of Prof. S.N. Nwabara, from 1966 to 1981, saw to the stability in the projects of the institute. He had the task of putting the Institute on a solid footing after the civil war. Through sheer hard work and the cooperation of the Institute Research staff, he was able to leave a strong stamp on some of the programmes handled. In 1981, a fresh policy for all institutes of the University was developed by the Senate. The new policy was meant to attach research staff to the Institute for limited periods of time and for specific work project and also to avoid prolonged tenure for even a director. That same year, a new director was appointed, Prof. Donatus I. Nwoga.\n\nAdministrative Unit: Mr. Johnson Osonwa Anya Okwara from Ohafia was the Administrative Officer and Secretary to the Institute from 1982 to 1989. He may have been the first Administrative Officer of the Institute of African Studies after the war. He served as a member of the Advisory Board of the Institute in the 1983/84 session and in other capacities.\n\nEthnography Unit: The Igbo Salvage Ethnography Project (SEP):\n\nA new line of research called the Igbo Salvage Ethnography Project (SEP) was kicked off by the new director. It was undertaken from 1982. Its aim was to build up a large collection of primary information on the Igbo way of life, covering all the parts of Igboland, which will be available for future scholarly work on the Igbo people. Recorded information would be both audio and visual, and should include assorted events in the current life of the people and interviews on traditional events and the historical past as far as these can be recounted. Special areas of information sought were guided by the present lines of interest of scholars of the University. Sixty-one undergraduates of this University from the different disciplines of study (Arts, Science, Social Science Education, Agriculture etc.) were selected as Field Research Assistants in a manner that represented all the Igbo speaking local government areas in what were then Anambra, Imo, Bendel and Rivers States of Nigeria. They were employed by the Institute to collect required data during their long vacation of two months (July to September) in 1982. (Onyeneke, 1984) (Nzei, 1984:52). Again, in the 1983 long vacation, sixty-seven students were also employed just like the year before and an additional six students were hired to work on a specific project for Dr. Anazodo. Also, some students continued some special research after the long vacations. (Nzei, 1984, 52). Research fellows and other scholars of African Studies helped in the processes towards making this project a successful one. In fact, a research committee was established by Prof. Donatus Nwoga in which members of the Institute contributed wonderful ideas and worked assiduously to make a success of the ethnographic project. (Aniakor, 2011:82).\n\nA Dictionary of Igbo Proverbs Continues:\n\nIn an attempt to kick off the Dictionary of Igbo Proverbs project (see Second Phase) alongside gathering general information on Igbo life, the then Director, Professor Donatus Nwoga, instructed and equipped the seventy-three students with exercise books and cassette tapes. In exercise books, they were required to jot down any proverbs that they heard or that they generated in private interview. They were then to seek and write down the explanations of proverbs collected from a number of informants, as well as note down the contexts in which the proverbs could be used. On cassette tapes, and with portable cassette recorders, they were to record discussions in which proverbs were likely to be used, like settlement of cases, marriage ceremonies, village drinking parties etc. they were also to record discussions of proverbs with elders. Essentially, the Director wanted them to produce records of the actual language of proverb usage and discussion from the primary carriers of Igbo Tradition. This is necessary since, quite often, because of failures of translation by people not conscious of the implications of the original language and its world value, the meanings of Igbo concepts are arbitrarily altered. Training courses were given to the students by academic staff who required data collected in their fields of research interest. Courses on use of recording equipment were also given by the then Cinematographer and Research Fellow, Raymond Wright. At the end of the 1983 vacation exercise (July to September), the Institute garnered about 2000 proverbs turned in the exercise books of the student field research assistants. (Nwoga, 1984). This was aside from the data bank of recordings on magnetic tapes for the larger Igbo Salvage Ethnographic Project which garnered primary data on Igbo life covering diverse fields of interest, including religion, philosophy, social life, literary and productive arts, history, science, medicine, technology etc. The data bank was held in a special section. (Ukwu, 1986:284). Some of the more enterprising students were also able to get photographs and antiquities which included various symbols of ikenga, okike, otuleka, okwa chi, masks etc. (Nzei, 1984:52). By 1986, cataloguing of these data had begun. This was to show the type of information held, the tape where each is held, and the place from which it was collected, in order to be available for study through a well compiled index.\n\nProf. Donatus I. Nwoga (English) Director (1981-84)\n\nDuring the 1983/84 session, vigorous activity was set in motion under the supervision of the then Institute\u2019s NYSC staff, Mr. A. A. Nzei, for the co-ordination and transcription of the taped material. A transcribing machine was bought and students were hired mainly from the University, and they were engaged in transcription of the recorded tapes even up to January 1985. (Onyeneke, 1985:9). Areas covered included Igbo worldview, Igbo Ethnomedicine, Igbo Music, Rain making, Igbo divination, folktales, masquerades and festivals, mythology, proverbs, politics etc. The Institute acquired about 3000 taped cassettes for this Igbo Salvage Ethnography Project.\n\nMuseum Unit:\n\nMrs. N.E.O. Uche-Okeke was the curator of the Museum from about August 1977 up until 1986. The museum, during this phase of the Institute\u2019s growth, was a treasure house and an invaluable visual library. Its artifacts served as educational tools to disseminate the unique contributions of African culture through well documented and publicized exhibitions. The absence of trained personnel and the difficulty in obtaining basic technical and conservation facilities since August 1977 made the Curator\u2019s duties difficult.\n\nThere was the sorting out of the museum\u2019s permanent art collections. There were pottery, metal (tools, weapons, instruments, currency, staff of office), wood (Nkwu, Agwu, Ikenga, Masks, titular paraphernalia utensils, musical instruments), stone, bones and ivories (jewellery, horns), textiles (Aji, Akwa Mmili, and Akwete) and architecture (Obu, Mbari). These items were documented and preserved. And exhibitions continued just like in the second phase of the Institute\u2019s growth up until a grand exhibition called the Ikenga\u2019 83 exhibition from July to November 1983. Exhibitions in 1976 included, Academic Star Launching and Exhibition by Daily Star Group of Papers (January), Nsukka Works 1972-1975; drawings paintings by Dr. Nich Wilkinson (February), First Steps by Tayo Adenaike and Gbubemi Amanoritsewor (February and March), Nigerian Contemporary Arts by Staff of Fine and Applied Arts Department (March), Ceramics by Benjo Igwilo (May) and Graphics Design (Paul Chapman and George Adams).\n\nFrom July to November 1983, the Institute of African Studies mounted an exhibition of the Ikenga, a cult and art object of the Igbo. It was fully sponsored by the University. Help was obtained from the National Commission for Museums and Monuments Lagos, Odinani Community Museum Nri, Mbari Art Center (Eke Nguru Mbaise), Obu ofonri Museum Enugwu-Ukwu, Asele Institute (Nimo), Ikenga group from Aguleri, University Library, CUDIMAC and the Faculty of Arts (Fine and Applied Arts, Archeology, Drama, Linguistics and Nigerian Languages) etc. The Institute museum was able to document and display numerous and varied Ikenga icons for view by the members of the University community and interested public. The opening ceremony was officiated by Igwe Osita Agwuna III of Enugwu-Ukwu (founder of Obu Ofonri Museum, Enugwu-Ukwu) and the then Vice Chancellor (Prof. Frank Nwachukwu Ndili) with the committee of deans.\n\nThe Reconstructed Obu Shrine in the Institute Museum\n\nTraditional chiefs including Chief Nwamba of Eha-Alumona were present. The NTA Enugu, Ikenga Age grade from Aguleri, Ikorodu Dance Group from Nsukka, Mmonwu Asaa Masquerade troupe from Aguata and the general University public lent grace and splendour to the occasion. The museum was given a long-desired face-lift for the occasion. The Exhibition was designed to flow visually. The introductory panel contained blow-up photographs of Ikenga with general notes and inset map of Igboland to familiarize the viewer with the theme of the exhibition and whet his appetite for yet more comprehensive information lodged in the icons in the gallery and the Obu shrine. A typical Obu shrine was set up to bring home vividly the various functional aspects of the Ikenga and its place in traditional Igbo ritual existence. The sequence and visual flow went on to general Igbo art. Artifacts, particularly in wood, were exhibited to illustrate Igbo basic design principles and art types. It was seen that wood-sculpture is an art-form of the Igbo men-folk and pottery that of the Igbo female-folk. The exhibition plan then moved from general to detailed fanfare on Ikenga showing its iconography, beliefs illustrating the presence of the notion of the strength of the right hand, and showing Ikenga among other ethnic peoples of Nigeria such as the Igala, Edo, Urohboh and Ijaw.\n\nThe exhibition concluded with a section to show the influence of Ikenga art form on contemporary designs in Igboland. This exhibition attracted several hundreds of visitors from outside and inside the University. The Museum visitors Book recorded almost one thousand (1, 000) signatures for the period of the Ikenga\u2019 83 Exhibition compared to only 318 signatures of visitors to the Museum from January 1981 to May 1983. a detailed inventory of the museum\u2019s permanent collections was achieved in part through documented expositions such as Ikenga \u201983 and a seminar on Ikenga and Igbo Life and Thought. (Uche-Okeke, 1984).\n\nCinema Unit (audio-visual studio):\n\nWhen the Institute was about to embark upon the Igbo Salvage Ethnography Project, it became obvious that there was a need for supplying video services for recording events, and for creating a visual documentation of Igbo traditions, culture and history. It is germane to note that in 1978, a still photographer, Mr. Nwankwo, left the Institute for another engagement, thus the Photo Unit was under lock and key for four years until 1982. Through the excellent contacts of the then Curator of the Institute museum, Mrs. N.E.O. Uche-Okeke, Mr. Raymond Wright, an African-American, was summoned from abroad and employed on contract basis. With the arrival of Mr. Wright, who was made a Research Fellow I and Cinematographer (placed on Salary Level 13), and because of renewed efforts on cinematographic activities by the then Director of the Institute, Prof. D.I. Nwoga, who took over from Prof. Nwabara in 1981, the photo studio was reopened in October 1982. There was an emphasis on film coverage and editing. The cinema unit was to provide the facilities for visual research to be conducted in the field, as well as supply the IAS audio visual library, which aside from films and video tapes produced within the IAS, would house collected visual material of relevant nature from other sources. Again, this desire to establish a cinema unit came from a realization on the part of the Director, Prof. D. I. Nwoga, that visual and audio research was becoming increasingly important in documenting African, and consequently, Igbo culture. Upon moving into the Photo Unit that would serve as the basic studio work area, it was discovered from equipment found, that a cinema unit had been the intention of Prof. S.N. Nwabara, the former director. The Bolex 16mm cine camera that was found, however, was jammed badly, and required overseas attention to make it operable. Aside from the cine camera, three twin lens, reflex, still cameras (very old), and photographic laboratory equipment were found. It was decided that because of the equipment on hand, that the studio space should have water restored to it, so that it would not only serve as a film editing room, but also a revived photographic laboratory. To provide a room with long enough \u201cthrow\u201d from viewing 16mm films it was necessary to remove a partition that separated the space and install an air-conditioner for comfort (the room was sealed off from light). Earlier in 1982, cinematography equipment had been selected from price lists provided by a London supplier. An order for the first group of equipment was placed in August 1982. This order included the 16mm crystal sync. Sound camera; lenses; the crystal sync., Nagra tape recorder; and accessories, such as fluid head tripod, super-directional microphones, lighting, etc. This order formed the basic production equipment. A second order was placed in March 1983. This order was for the six plate, automatic, horizontal, editing console, capable of simultaneously editing one picture and two tracks of sound. Other editing accessories, and accessories to upgrade the existing 16mm camera, were ordered (the 16mm camera was taken overseas in August 1983 for repair). This last order formed the basic post- production equipment. With these items of equipment, Mr. Wright and, sometimes, hired students and junior staff, were able to perform duties that have become useful to researchers today. Mr. Lucky Okpara, then a junior staff (but as at 2010 when he retired, a Principal Technical Supervisor) assisted Mr. Wright in the video coverage activities. After a while, Mr. Okpara was sent on technical training to Jos, Plateau State. The Studio encountered the beginner\u2019s difficulties such as lack of foreign exchange to ensure the Institute\u2019s overseas suppliers their payment for cinema equipment ordered. An attempt to bring the equipment and pay for the repair of the IAS existing equipment failed in September 1983. Equally frustrating was acquiring equipment within the country 16mm equipment was virtually non-existent, and portable video cameras and video tape recorders (VTR\u2019s) were very expensive. Then, the small lightweight, portable equipment was very much in demand by novice video users. Another major problem had been to get genuine cooperation from the U.N.N. Works Department. To get simple projects accomplished such as installing an air-conditioner or removing a partition was a long and arduous task, and oftentimes, in the end, outside help was solicited. Nevertheless, activities in this studio from that October 1982, include the photographic documentation of the IAS Museum collection. After camera repairs, Mr. Wright began to photograph each item in the museum collection, which he thought would serve a two- fold purpose. As there was no visual record of the complete museum collection, he felt that in the event of theft, the Institute could offer the authorities more than just a written description of the item, by providing a photocopy of the photograph along with all other pertinent information, (i.e. size, distinguishing color marking). This was also invaluable information for insurance claims. A color print attached to an information sheet can be vitally important in gathering information on museum artifacts, since the items themselves, cannot be taken to the filed for research. This would aid the IAS museum in augmenting and cross checking its own data. Before camera failure, and the first research advance was expanded, approximately one hundred and seventy- two items had been photographed. Many of the sculptural items have been photographed from two views. By Mr. Wright\u2019s estimation, about two thirds of the collection has been photographed. There was also the Photographic research for \u201cIkenga 1983 Exhibition. In preparation for the IAS exhibition of Ikenga, Mr. Wright traveled to Nri several times to photograph the Odinani museums collection of Ikenga, and photograph actual ancestor shrines with Ikenga in situ. The archeology department\u2019s collection of Ikenga was also photographed and the upgrading of their documentation has been achieved through cross-checking of the photographs through field research. The result of this work has been design of the Obu in the exhibition; many enlarged photographs displayed in the exhibition, and illustrated notes on the Ikenga and iru mmuo (Igbo ancestral altar). In the Cinema studio also, video tape editing was a primary feature. With the loan of a portable video tape recorder (VTR), Mr. Wright and his assistants succeeded in editing two video tapes, of two hours each from the opening ceremonies of \u201cIkenga 1983 into one video tape of one and a half hour. This electronic editing was done using the most rudimentary equipment, and the audio dub and insert capabilities of the IAS JVC VTR. Using the same on- loan portable VTR and IAS\u2019 video camera, Mr. Wright was able to video tape the Ikenga exhibition itself with particular emphasis on the ancestor altar. He was also able to video tape the rare wall paintings by women, located inside the Odinani museum, in addition to the same type of paintings on the walls of an Alusi temple by the name of \u201cIyiagi\u201d, in Agbadana, Nri. The tape included a brief narrative description by Mazi Benjamin Akuune Ewuocha of Obeagu, Nri. He was an Ozo priest and Mr. Wright\u2019s major informant. During 1983, a full proposal including a budget for the 16mm film production of \u201cSigwe Bansi is Dead\u201d for the sub-Department of Drama was executed. The proposal involved some months of research, and journeys to Enugu and Lagos. The filming was to be sponsored by the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria: in keeping with a promise the President personally made to the University of Nigeria in 1982. The film was never made. Using the IAS\u2019 dual audio cassette decks and equalizer, Mr. Wright produced thirty-five re-mastered four track, cassettes, as part of the IAS\u2019 permanent collection of audio tapes for the Research Library.\n\nMr. Raymond Wright, Cinematographer and Research Fellow I in his office after an ethnographic filming.\n\nHe also tested the high speed, two track cassette duplication system by completing two hundred and thirty-five two track dubbings. (Wright, 1984). Regular services until 1986 included, duplication of research tapes, duplication of Ethnographic salvage tapes, enhancement and duplication of research tapes, and, video taping/editing. Unfortunately, Mr. Wright\u2019s contract expired in 1985. He sought to renew it but was informed by the Personnel Services Department that a new individual had been trained for the job. The new individual happened to be Mr. Lucky Okpara. He took over from Mr. Wright in 1986 during the tenure of Prof. Uche Okeke as Director of the Institute. And then, inventory of the items of equipment was done. With the departure of the Curator in 1986, Mr. Okpara handled both the Cinematographic Unit and the Museum! Of course, the enormity of the dual responsibilities was telling on one individual. The studio was very sterile during this period. Hence, the studio was seldom opened. Mr. Okpara concentrated his attention on the Museum.\n\nResearch:\n\nThere were many research projects and workshops from 1975 to 1985. The workshops included The State of Igbo Studies: Towards Establishing the Roots of Igbo Civilization (June 8-10, 1982) (with topics from mostly arts and social sciences departments) and Ikenga in Igbo Life and Thought (November 22-23, 1983) (with papers from Prof. A.E. Afigbo (Review of Ikenga Scholarship), Dr. C. Aniakor (An Artistic Approach to the Ikenga Symbol), Mrs. Ego Uche-Okeke (Ikenga and the Female Archetype) etc. Research projects completed included those by Achebe Chinua (African Revolutionary Literature from Olaudu Eqiano to the present day/ Igbo Verse and Drama), Afigbo, A.E. (A History of Nsukka), Amucheazi, E. (The Political Dynamics of Eastern Nigeria with emphasis on pressure groups particularly on the Role of the Church in the Politics of Eastern States), Chukwukere, I. (i. Igbo Beliefs and Rituals associated with Chi, ii. Changing Patterns of Authority and Leadership in Uzoagba Village Group), Nwala, T.U. (Oracles: Their place in the traditional cosmological order of the Igbo), Uba, C.N. (Otanzu-Otanchara Society and Culture: A case study of Igbo Cultural History), a team project to understudy the Owerri-Orlu Zone etc. Research grants were approved by the Institute for research by scholars of the University from different disciplines. The total grants approved by the Institute to support these projects amounted to N32, 707, ranging from the sum of N800 to N10, 000 for a single project. This was in the 1981/82 academic year. In 1978, the Institute had Professor VC Uchendu of Anthropology as a Visiting Professor. Also, in 1982, Dr Nnabuenyi Ugonna of English came in as a Visiting Research Fellow. That same year also, Rev. Dr. A. Onyeneke of Sociology came into the Institute as a Visiting Research Fellow II.\n\n20th Anniversary of the Institute:\n\nAside Ikenga \u201983, which was part of the activities to mark this anniversary, Prof. Edward Wilmot Blyden III, grandson of the famous pan-negro patriot, E.W. Blyden, and a founding father of the Institute returned as a visiting Professor from October to December 1983. The Institute sponsored a series of lectures given by him. He gave lectures on the following topics: Building a University: Challenge and Triumph (November 17, 1983); Africana at Nsukka Revisited (November 21, 1983) and Towards \u20181984\u2019: Crisis in the Search for an African Personality (December 1, 1983).\n\nPublications Unit:\n\nOccasional publications during this phase included Institute Monograph Series; Studies in Igbo Civilization; Foundation of Igbo Culture/ Civilization; Nigeria in the 1980s; Igboland in Transition 1900-1950 (by Dr. C. N. Ubah); Traditional Igbo Medicine (by Dr. M. M. Iwu); and Ikenga in Igbo Life and Thought. Ikoro was last published in January 1977 (Vol IV, No. 1) under the editorship of Dr. C.N. Ubah. Seven years later, it was published in July 1984 under the editorship of Rev. Dr. A. Onyeneke. This edition was probably stimulated by the twentieth anniversary of the Institute. An impressive history of the Institute from 1963 to 1983 was successfully completed by Dr. Onyeneke and published as part of this Ikoro edition. Ikoro continued until it was stopped in July 1985.\n\nProf. Uche Okeke (Fine/ Applied Arts) Director (1984-86)\n\nTHE YEARS 1986-2005\n\nThis period appears the most sterile in the history of the Institute, mainly due to the unavailability of funds and fund raising reaches to implement the great ideas of each passing director. Each director sometimes used their private funds to run the affairs of the Institute. Nevertheless, seminars and workshops were carried out occasionally and publications were made.\n\nThe Aniakor Administration Begins:\n\nProf. Chike Aniakor became the Director of the Institute after Prof. Uche Okeke. In the 2011 Conference of the Institute of African Studies, Prof. Chike Aniakor revealed some aspects of his achievements in office as Director. He said:\n\nUnder my tenure as Director of the Institute, we organized jointly with the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, an International Conference on EthnoMedicine. Traditional medicine men and healers were invited, including pharmacologists and other research scholars. In the end, resolutions in the form of a communiqu\u00e9 opened a new mine of information on African pharmacopaea. It was also suggested whether it was possible to nurture an ecological garden of African herbal plants. \u2026. During my tenure, we also addressed the female side of indigenous knowledge by hosting a joint international conference with Faculty of Arts, under the Deanship of Prof. Oluikpe, on Igbo women in history. (Aniakor, 2011:83).\n\nPublications Unit:\n\nIn June 1992, vol 7, Nos 1 and 2 of the Ikoro was published after a seven year lull from 1985. It was edited by Dr. A.I. Okpoko. And its publication was possible from donations by Prof. M.A. Onwuejeogwu (Sociology/ Anthropology, University of Benin, N500) and Prof. A.E. Afigbo, then outgoing Director of the Institute (N700). From this publication, some of the events of this phase of the growth of the Institute were gleaned for this book.\n\nProf. C.C. Aniakor (Fine/ Applied Arts) Director (1986-88)\n\nResearch Unit:\n\nThere were series of annual seminars on Igbo Life and Culture jointly organized by the Faculty of Arts and the Institute of African Studies from 1986. They began from a book project on The Hero in Igbo Life and Culture initiated by Prof. D.I. Nwoga, then Dean of the Faculty of Arts. In 1985, a group of scholars drawn mainly from the Faculty of Arts had met a number of times in the residence of Prof. Nwoga to discuss the project. They included Prof. Nwoga himself, Prof. Iheanacho Egonu, Mr. Obiora Udechukwu, Dr. J.N. Oriji, Dr. Emeka Nwabueze, Dr. Obi Maduakor, Ezi-Nwanyi Patricia Nwoga, Dr. Chimalum Nwankwo, Dr. Nnadozie Inyama, and Chukwuma Azuonye. Participants in the seminar series were drawn not only from the University of Nigeria but from other universities in the country, notably Ibadan, Lagos, Imo State, Port-Harcourt, and Calabar. It then became necessary to establish a network of communication links with all the potential participants.\n\nA circular letter describing the project was dispatched. Ideas and people were gathered and before long the first seminar was held from May 15 to 17, 1986 with a keynote address by Prof. D. I. Nwoga on \u201cHeroes and Charlatans\u201d. It was successful due to the enthusiasm and commitment of the participants. In general, the papers presented affirmed the existence, universality and antiquity of the phenomenon of the hero in traditional Igbo life and culture and the persistence of the heroic image in Igbo oral literature. The second seminar was held from December 1 to 5, 1987.\n\nIt was on the image and position of women in Igbo society as agreed in the first seminar. During the second seminar, 50 out of the 55 papers gotten were presented. The Director of the Institute, Dr. Chike Aniakor, was quick in responding to an invitation by the Faculty of Arts to be involved in the running of the series. It was successfully held. Owing to unforeseen organizational problems at the Institute of African Studies, it was not possible to hold the third seminar in 1988 although the the theme, \u201cThe Igbo Worldview\u201d, had been agreed upon at the plenary session of the second seminar. On account of this lapse, the Faculty of Arts seriously considered reclaiming the seminar series. The impasse was however saved, first, by the persistent pressure of the then Dean of Arts, Prof. (Mrs.) Edith Ihekweazu, on the new Director of the Institute of African Studies, Dr. S. A. Ekwelie, to take some decisive measures to reinstate the seminar series, and secondly, by the appointment of Prof. A. E. Afigbo as Director of the Institute. He was quick to realize the value of the series, set up a new organizing committee which after a series of meetings was able to attract a generous grant of N6, 000 from the Vice Chancellor to stage the third seminar.\n\nProf. S.A. Ekwelie (Mass Communication) Director (1988-89)\n\nThe opening ceremony, on Monday, December 4, 1989, featured an address by the Director of the Institute, Prof. A. E. Afigbo; a welcome address by the then Vice Chancellor, Prof. Chimere Ikoku, represented by Professor J. N. C. Maduewesi, Dean of the Post Graduate School; an address by the Imo State Commissioner for Information and Culture read by Dr. J. N. Amankulor, and a vote of thanks by the Dean of Arts, Prof. (Mrs.) Edith Ihekweazu, the highlight of the occasion was a keynote address on \u201cThe Igbo World View\u201d by Prof. Chinua Achebe in which he enthralled the audience by involving them in the performance of an Igbo folk ballad. The response to the call for papers was so tremendous that for the first time in the series, several parallel sessions had to be organized during the two working days of the seminar, Monday, 4th December and Tuesday, 5th December. (Azuonye, 1992:12).\n\nOne feature of Prof. A. E. Afigbo\u2019s return to the Institute was the revival of the fortnightly seminars which he had introduced in the first place in 1972. A major aim of the series was to offer scholars in Nigeria and those visiting the opportunity to test the results of their research during an in-house discussion where they can benefit from friendly but informed criticism before venturing out into the wider and often unfriendly intellectual community. Many papers were discussed in this series. A seminar on Igbo Women in Socio-Economic Change ran from April 3rd to April 6th 1990. The proceedings would be published many years later in 2009 during the tenure of Prof. Emeka Otagburuagu as Director of the Institute. There was also another seminar on the decades of Igbo Ukwu held from 9th to 10th of January 1991.\n\nThe seminar explored some of the controversies generated by Prof. Thurstan Shaw\u2019s work in Igbo Ukwu, especially in the areas of dating and the interpretation of the finds and, second, to give broad indications as to the direction in which archeological, historical and cultural studies in the region should move to improve knowledge. Twelve papers from seasoned scholars were presented.\n\nThere was yet another seminar of the Institute of African Studies in honour of Prof. Adiele Eberechukwu Afigbo (OON, FHSN). It was titled, \u201cThe Big Drum for an Academic Warrior!\u201d. The seminar was held from the 17th to the 19th of September 1992. During the seminar, three of Prof. Afigbo\u2019s books were launched.\n\nThey were:\n\n(a) Groundworks of Igbo History\n\n(2) Images of Igboland, and,\n\n(3) Igbo Women in Socio-Economic Development.\n\nThese books were reviewed by Prof. A.O. Anya. There were three Chief Launchers for the three books. They were Dr. Pius Okigbo for Groundworks. Chief Nlemigbo (Ochiriozua of Mbaeri) for Images, and Lolo Enwerem for Igbo Women. Outgoing Director of the Institute, Prof. A.E. Afigbo, gave a valedictory lecture titled, \u201cOf Men, Women and History\u201d.\n\nProf. Adiele E. Afigbo, Director (1989-92)\n\nThere were renditions by the Oluimo (Imo State Choir) and there was music and dance by the Omenimo Dance Troupe in the George Marion Johnson Quadrangle. This seminar was done to appreciate the contributions of Prof. Afigbo to history in Nigeria, especially of the same breath as the pioneers of history in Nigeria such as Dike, Anene, Ajayi, Aderibigbe, Ayandele etc.\n\nProf. I.T.K. Egonu, Director (1992-96)\n\nGeneral: During the tenure of Prof. I.T.K. Egonu (1992-96), a seminar on Igbo Kingship Institution was held. It explored the unethical mode of installing many kings in Igboland in modern times. During this tenure too, the Cinema Unit was closed. As previously narrated, Mr. Okpara handled both the Cinematographic Unit and the Museum. And of course, the enormity of the dual responsibilities was telling on one individual. The studio was very sterile during this period. Hence, the studio was closed.\n\nProf. O.U. Kalu (Religion) Director, 1996-98\n\nMr. Okpara concentrated his attention on the Museum. Therefore, from 1986 to the undefined date during the Egonu tenure (1994-96), the studio was not given full attention. The dark period of the studio began when it was finally shut from use. During this tenure too, a wall mural was painted by Krydz Ikwuemezi of Fine and Applied Arts Department.\n\nProf. O.O. Enekwe (Theatre Arts/ Film Studies), Director (1998- 2004)\n\nThe Egonu administration was able to shoulder many responsibilities without adequate funding. Repair works on the collapsing ceiling of the Institute were carried out as at this time and a signboard was put up in the Hansberry Building to indicate that it was indeed the Institute of African Studies.\n\nThe next ten years from 1996 to 2006 were the darkest in the history of the Institute. And \u201cdarkest\u201d here means that what progress achieved during this period were not very accessible to the writers of this book.\n\nNevertheless, the Enekwe administration must have organized some seminars, including in-house seminars and a programme titled, \u201cOnodu Ndigbo Nime Nigeria Obu Ihe ha Mere Onwe Ha?\u201d (The Condition of the Igbo in Nigeria, is it self-inflicted?). It was done in November 2001.\n\nParticipants at the programme titled, \u201cOnodu Ndigbo Nime Nigeria Obu Ihe ha Mere Onwe Ha?\u201d (The Condition of the Igbo in Nigeria, is it self-inflicted?).\n\nThe publication of Ikenga and Ikoro were put on hold in the last ten years of this phase. This is mainly because of lack of funds and not at all because of the lack of ingenuity of the then staff of the institute. This is not to say that other staff of other climes of the Institute did not face similar circumstances, only that they were lucky enough to brave them.\n\nProf. Aloy Ohaegbu, Director (2004-06)\n\nDuring the Ohaegbu administration, there were about three staff members in the Institute. They included Messrs. Alex Nzei who came into the Institute as a NYSC ethnographer in 1983 after graduating from the University, C. Njokuocha and Lucky Okpara. The then Director, Prof. Aloy Ohaegbu, wrote requests for more staff and even shortlisted possible candidates and had the shortlist sent to the Department of Personnel Services of the University, but there was no response. The Museum was, by this time, almost abandoned and unkempt. The circumstance divested the lone staff, Lucky Okpara, of daily job routine as there were no visitors to the Museum. Nevertheless, Prof. Aloy Ohaegbu was able to purchase chairs for the seminar room of the Institute. He also bought a marker board for the room and tiled it. The lone generator which the Institute still uses as we write was bought during his administration. (Ohaegbu, 2012).\n\nTHE YEARS 2006-2012\n\nIn 2006, a new Director was appointed. He was Prof. Joseph Emeka Otagburuagu. He immediately held a meeting with the available staff of the Institute. Some of the problems the staff talked about included among others, lack of sufficient staff to man the highly specialized areas of the Institute, poor funding, lack of adequate facilities, and, failure to implement the postgraduate programmes of the Institute as approved by the University Senate and Council in 1967.\n\nFora:\n\nThe new Director set to work and, among other things, between May and October 2008, the Institute had organized a cultural seminar aimed at promoting and preserving the cultural heritage of the African, especially of South-Eastern Nigeria. The seminar was titled, Living With Our Heritage. The University community graced this occasion and the Vice Chancellor of the University, ably represented by the Deputy Vice Chancellor, Administration, Prof. F.I. Idike, noted with glee that the seminar had come at a time when the need for repositioning African culture was germane, since \u201cAfrican conventional morality and spirit of common sensitivity are deeply rooted in the culture\u201d. The Institute decided that this seminar would be organized annually to maintain the desire to promote African culture. It is unfortunate that, up to this moment, no other has been held. Two months later in July 2008, the University Community was astounded with yet another activity of the Institute, which was the First International Conference on Governance in Africa in the 21st Century. This conference attracted the United States Embassy and state governors in the country. The foremost professor of History, Prof. A. E. Afigbo was the chairman of the occasion. Among other dignitaries at the occasion was the former governor of Anambra State, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife. Presenting a paper at the occasion, the eminent Professor of Political Science, Prof. Obasi Igwe, noted that governance in Africa was mostly weaned on the altar of negligence of the common masses.\n\nEchoing the move of a former Director, Prof. Adiele Afigbo, the Institute embarked on two types of seminars in order to boost the general research activities in it. These were the House Seminars and the Fortnightly Seminars. The House Seminars was done indoors. Any interested member of staff of the Institute was involved in this venture. The Fortnightly seminars were for visiting scholars on issues of academic and contemporary interests. Scholars were assigned themes or would contrive individual themes to present at the expense of the Institute.\n\nUniversity Secondary School students performing at the New Arts Theatre during the Living With Our Heritage Programme.\n\nOn December 11 2008, the Institute organized a forum titled, \u201cWorthy Sons and Daughters of Igbo Land Forum\u201d in which a great philanthropist, Mr. Sam Onyishi, was also made a fellow of the Institute. In concluding his lecture titled, \u201cGod, Vision, Values and Management Excellence: Exploring the Peace Mass Business Model in Nigeria\u201d, Mr. Sam Onyishi promised the Institute a donation of 100 million Naira, and with tears of joy, he established his scholarship foundation in the Institute. He began a general renovation of the Institute around January 2009. The foundation now domiciled in the Institute known as, and called Samuel Maduka Onyishi African Entrepreneurship Foundation (SAMOAEF) has an endowment of a hundred million Naira (N1,000,000) for scholarship awards to Nigerians and the rest of the world. The SAMOAEF is a non-profit and philanthropic organization which is part of the Public-Private Partnership initiatives of the University of Nigeria and The Peace Group of Companies (Nig.) for educational development in the 21st century.\n\nThe primary objective of the Foundation, among others, is youth empowerment and capacity building through the medium of education. The Foundation believes that the major way to promote peace and development in the society is to give every person access to sound education. On May 13, 2009, the Foundation was inaugurated with its focus on reduction of unemployment, promotion of research, support of staff exchanges and linkages, giving of scholarship to deserving scholars and promote African entrepreneurship, it also pursued the creation and promotion of Igbo and African intellectual tradition. It awarded five overseas postgraduate scholarships to young Nigerians to study different courses in China. Some of these awardees have completed their Masters Degrees and one of them is now pursuing Doctorate Degree, two are into business and two are staff members of the University. One of them, Mr. Chinedu Asadu, who studied Chinese Language, has been employed by the University of Nigeria to teach Chinese Language studies in Nigeria. Almost 2000 applications were received by May 2010. 647 candidates met the stipulated requirements. The target areas of the scheme are as follows: Nsukka Cultural Zone, Other LGAs of Enugu State, Other Igbo States/ Communities, Other States of Nigeria; and, Africa and the world in general. Ten candidates were chosen from the target areas and 81 young men and women were awarded scholarships immediately. The SAMOAEF has continued to award scholarships annually to deserving Nigerian students even as we write.\n\nFormer governor of Anambra State, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife (standing), during the first International Conference of the Institute of African Studies in 2008\n\nThe Institute also organized a successful New Millennium Good Governance Project forum of December 18, 2008, in which the former chairman of Nsukka local government area, Honourable Dan I. Ugwuja, was made a fellow of the Institute. This project was launched on December 18, 2008 as part of the town and gown programmes of the Institute. The objectives were to monitor those in governance for purposes of evaluation and promotion of good governance ethics. The inspiration for this project came from the leadership model of the Nebo Administration and the communiqu\u00e9 which the participants to the Institute\u2019s International Conference on Governance in Africa in the 21st Century released. The project was situated in the Institute under the supervision of the Vice Chancellor. The Institute believes that a lot could be done through good governance to improve the lot of the masses in Africa. The project was flagged off with public lecture by the Chairman of Nsukka Local Government on the theme: Governance at the Grassroots.\n\nOn April 30, 2009, Chief Ojo Maduekwe, the External Affairs Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria presented the second lecture of the Good Governance Project on Our Challenge, Our Capacity: Nigeria and the New World Order. During the event, Chief Ojo Maduekwe promised to endow a chair with the sum of N30 Million in African Studies with his friends and to set up a Unit for International Studies and Diplomacy in the Institute. A follow up action had since been initiated for the recovery of these pledges.\n\nThere was also a memorial seminar for Prof. Adiele Afigbo, former Director of the Institute, who died on March 9th 2009, shortly after visiting the Institute in July 2008 during its International Conference in which he served as Chairman. His enormous contributions to the success of the Institute remain as clear as the existence of the sky in its history.\n\nPublication Unit:\n\nWith the new vision, dynamic innovation, willing spirit coupled with the excellent desire to leave an exemplary legacy worthy of emulation, the then Director introduced a number of productive reforms, innovations and measures to restructure the Institute. Staffs were occasionally gingered to meet up with the requirements in new technology and innovation of this century. They were asked to be focused and determined to work harder as the work in the Institute was considerable and required total dedication and a willing spirit to serve.\n\nAgain, the publication and documentation Unit of the Institute published a new book titled Governance in Africa in the 21st Century in Africa. This journal was the book of proceedings from the First International conference of the Institute in July 2008. It focused on governance problems in Africa. Its management was also highly specialized. The Board of Advisers included the Vice Chancellor of the University of Nigeria, Prof. C. O. Nebo, the Governor of Enugu State, Barr. Sullivan Chime, and many others. The Editor-in-Chief of the Governance in Africa in the 21st Century was the Director of the Institute of African Studies, Prof. E. J. Otagburuagu.\n\nThe Institute of African Studies also issued two books with the following titles, New Brides, More Hopes: Igbo Women in Socio-economic Change (edited by Prof. E.J. Otagburuagu and Prof. Adiele Afigbo) and Mass Creativity and African Development (Edited by Prof. E.J. Otagburuagu).\n\nThe two journals \u2013 Ikoro and Ikenga\u2014were last published in 1975 and 1992 respectively. But between mid 2006 and October 2008, the Institute published two volumes of Ikoro and two volumes of Ikenga (Ikenga International Journal of African Studies, Vol. 9 No. 1&2 of 2007). The journals were registered with the National Library and International Standard numbers assigned to them. Also between 2006 and 2008, the following were produced by members of Staff of the Institute and are available for exhibition and sale to the public: The Igbo and their Nri Neighbors, by Nwankwo T. Nwaezeigwe (2007), Senior Research Fellow, Institute of African Studies; 21st Century Igbo-Hausa-Yoruba, Tiv/ English Primer, by Alexander O.E. Animalu (Adjunct Research Professor), Emeka Otagburuagu (Director, Institute of African Studies) et al. (2008); A Darkling Plain (Novel), by Chris Agbedo (Senior Research Fellow, IAS) (2007) and Readings in African Studies, edited by A.E. Afigbo (Former Director, IAS) and E.J. Otagburuagu (Director, IAS).\n\nThe Institute also published two News Bulletins which somehow were a hybrid between the original vision of the Ikoro (which was to give light to activities of the Institute to the general public) and of a newspaper (which is to enlighten the public on news events around them). The first was edited by C. Njokuocha, with Ben Jones, Lucky Okpara, M. Omeje and E. Ezeanwu as co-editors. It was published on September 30, 2006 with a focus on the policy position and dreams of the Institute. The second edition was published on December 30, 2008. It was edited by Jeff Unaegbu, with Maureen Onyejegbu, Chinyere Ndubuisi and Awa Emmanuel Ogbu as co-editors. It brought in the concept of an editorial and a mission statement of the Bulletin. Its mission was to \u201cgive visibility to the works of the Institute and also other activities sponsored by it, to foster the preservation and maintenance of our cultural heritage, and, to inform its publics\u201d News about the July 2008 conference and miscellany were covered.\n\nPost graduate studies:\n\nIn 2006, new curricula were developed for Post Graduate Diploma, Masters and PhD programmes in African Studies. Senior academic staff members from affiliate Departments were very helpful in this regard. Each Department contributed significantly in the development of the curricula. The Vice Chancellor, Prof. C.O. Nebo, approved on behalf of the Senate that the post-graduate programmes of the Institute which the University Senate had approved since 1964, 1967, 1970 be immediately resuscitated. Consequent on this, the Dean of the School of Post-graduate Studies advertised the Post-graduate programmes of the Institute. The new curricula were ratified and approved by the School of Post-graduate Studies. Six students were offered admission in the 2009/2010 and 2010/11 session. Four of them were in master\u2019s degree programme (including Jeff Unaegbu, Senior Cinematographer and Head of the Cinema Unit, and Susan Orajaka, a research fellow), one in PhD (Mrs. Adaozo Orjiekwe, former Secretary to the Institute), and one for the post-graduate diploma programme (Mr. Emmanuel Ogbu, Senior Ethnographer of the Institute). The pioneer lecturers for Masters in African Studies were Prof. Agha AU Agha (IAS 507: African Religion and Philosophy), Prof. Inno Uzoma Nwadike (IAS 511: African Languages and Literature), Prof. Pat Uche Okpoko (IAS 504: African Ethnosciences), Dr. Peter-Jazzy Ezeh (IAS 509: African Political and Social Systems and IAS 513: Advanced Social Institutions), Dr. LC Ekechukwu (IAS 510: Principles of Museology and Cinematography), Dr. Tony Nwankwo Nwaezeigwe (IAS 502: African History and Environmental Studies), Dr. Sam Chukwu (IAS 513: African Music and Dance), Dr. Uche Nwaozuzu (IAS 513B: Masking Tradition in Africa), Dr. Nkiru Christiana Ohia (IAS 503: Gender and Role Dynamics in African Societies) and Mr. Jude Tochukwu Omenma (IAS 501: Principles and Methods of Research in African Studies).\n\nProf. Emeka Otagburuagu (English), Director, (2006-10)\n\nAdministrative Staff:\n\nThere had been a few members of staff who were in the Institute when Prof. Otagburuagu arrived as Director. They included Mr. Alex Nzei (Senior Research Fellow), M. Omeje (Research Librarian), Mr. Lucky Okpara (Senior Technical Supervisor), EAK Ukpai (Senior Executive Officer/ Acting Secretary to the Director), Mrs. Pauline Nwigbo (Assistant Chief Typist), Mr. S.U. Nwodo (Assistant Chief Typist), Mr. Obetta, H. Ayogu (Chief Messenger) and J. Ogbonna (Head Messenger).\n\nThe Director attracted the services of Dr. Ike Achebe (Chinua Achebe\u2019s son) as Visiting Senior Research Fellow, Dr. Ben Jones, an anthropologist, to serve also as Visiting Senior Research Fellow, and, R.C. Njokuocha as Research Fellow II. There was also Dr. V.C. Onu. Much afterwards, Ambassador Joseph Ayalogu became an adjunct Senior Research Fellow in the Institute. He had been Nigeria\u2019s past representative to the United Nations and ambassador to Switzerland. There was an unprecedented influx of staff into the Institute from 2008, courtesy of the Director, Prof. Emeka Otagburuagu and the then Vice Chancellor, Prof. C.O. Nebo.\n\nAbout thirty new graduates got employment into the Institute, including three Ethnographers (Amajo Onyemuwa Nnorom, Awa Ogbu Emmanuel, Michael-Aliga Chiamaka Precious), a new curator (Mrs. Maureen Onyejegbu Nwando), a new Cinematographer (Jephthah Elochukwu Unaegbu), an ICT System Analyst II ( Tivde Tertsegha), a camera operator for the Cine Unit (Chukwudi Onuigbo, an undergraduate then) and many Higher Executive Officers and Unit assistants (Tochukwu Nwadike, Carol Odoh, Kingsley Ifoh etc). The Institute also employed a considerable research force. A new senior Research Fellow (Nwaezeigwe Nwankwo Tony) was employed. He was formerly of the Department of History, University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Other Research Fellows were also employed. They included, Omenma Tochukwu Jude, Iwundu Ifeanyi Emmanuel, Aniago Magnus Aniago, Ohia Nkiru Christiana, Ibenekwu Ikpechukwuka Eugene, Okagu George Ogbonna, Ogbonne Ijeoma Pauline and Ezeigbo Joy Chisara. Unfortunately, one of the new staff members died of illness. He was Mr. Onyechi, a Higher Executive Officer.\n\nEthnographic Unit:\n\nIn line with the desire of the Institute of African Studies to salvage the gradual loss of information encoded in electronic form by early ethnographers of the Institute, the Administrative Unit of the Institute embarked on the transcription of information recorded in cassettes during the Salvage Ethnographic Project of the 1980\u2019s. Because of the sheer large quantity of information, the listing of the materials encoded in the cassettes alone took about four weeks to finalize. Part of the information salvaged were folk tales retold by old men in their own idiolects. There were also folk songs and detailing of marriage and burial ceremonies in different lands in the south-eastern parts of Nigeria.\n\nTranscription of Ethnographic tapes by administrative staff\n\nTechnical Services and Cinematographic Unit:\n\nWe have seen that the dark period of the Cine studio began when it was shut around 1996. It was opened again on February 14, 2007, and only then for inventory purposes. A new lease of life for the Cinema Unit began in May 15, 2008 when a new Cinematographer, Jephthah Elochukwu Unaegbu (Jeff Unaegbu), was employed. It was renamed the Technical Services and Cinematographic Unit. But tough days were ahead. Upon arrival into the Cine studio, he discovered that it had become the Augean stables. It was dusty, dank and cobwebbed and items of equipment had become obsolete. The new Cinematographer undertook an inventory and began to dust and wash. Within a week of his arrival, precisely on the 21st of May 2008, a cultural show titled, Living with our Heritage, was powered by the Institute. It was a modification of an idea he presented to the then Director, Prof. E.J. Otagburuagu. The original idea was to premiere, in the New Arts Theatre, a cultural movie directed by the Cinematographer for Prof E.J. Otagburuagu privately before he was employed. The title of the movie was Udaram.\n\nLeft to right: Jeff Unaegbu (Senior Cinematographer) and Samuel Ogbonna (Cinematographer) busy at work during an Institute\u2019s programme\n\nThe idea was modified to include cultural dances, folk songs by Dr. F.N. Ibemesi, folk music by Tivde Tertsegha (who was later employed by the Institute on the 23rd of December 2008), folk drama and presentations by departments of Music and Theatre Arts and the University Staff School and University Secondary School. During the show at the theater, the Cinematographer had to use his private laptop (A Toshiba product) to project the movie onto an old screen from the studio. A modern projector was obtained from a private hirer. The laptop power pack got burnt for lack of a stabilizer to stabilize the electric current generated in the theatre. After the show therefore, there was need for a studio computer system and other up-to-date items to make the studio worth calling a cinematographer\u2019s den.\n\nAn urgent proposal was drawn, requesting for the take-off items of equipment necessary for a modest cinematographic studio in the 21st century. Among other things, there was the need for a projector (preferably Sony) and a 73\u2019 by 73\u2019 screen onto which films would be projected for cine view. Both would cost N280, 000. Aside from serving as visual communication aid for the Institute, the projector and screen would be hired out to the University community at the cost of N2000 every day. There was and still is the potential of getting an average of N10, 000 every week in that internal revenue generating process. There was the need also for a Dell computer system with configuration of 200 Giga Byte Hard Disk Drive, Pentium 4 speed, 1 Giga Byte Random Access Memory, Digital Video Disk and Compact Disk SUPER ALL WRITE, 3.4 Giga Hertz, with Flat Screen 15\u2019 Keyboard and mouse. This would inevitably accompany the projector and would also be used for video editing of movies.\n\nIt was then sold for N100, 000. Movies could be edited for commercial video men after capturing is done. This would be another attempt at internal revenue generating process. There was the need for a Video Capture Card (Lightwave) (N20, 000). This is used to capture video from any camcorder after recording into a computer system as editable data. There was also the need for a videotape-to-CD Video conversion set (N100, 000). It would generate N1000 per conversion and could attract N30, 000 every fortnight into the Institute. A digital camera of very high resolution was also needed. A DVD/CD mass burner or DVD/CD duplicator machine was very juicy and therefore needed. It could generate N40, 000 in an hour of duplication! And there was also the need for a pianoforte for the production of movie sound track and as first step into implementing the new employee\u2019s contemplation of a complete music section in the studio.\n\nAfter many difficulties as detailed in an in-house unpublished history manuscript of the Cinematographic Unit, a new projector was gotten. Other items of equipment are yet to be bought due to lack of funds. Despite the difficulties, the Unit which presently has two Cinematographers (After Jeff Unaegbu, Samuel Ogbonna was also employed in April 2009) and a Camera Operator (Chukwudi Onuigbo) had produced many important video clips and documentaries using private items of equipment. They included Living in our Heritage and Zik of Africa directed by the Head Cinematographer, Mr. Unaegbu. An audio-visual library were these products would be stored and made available for research is being planned by the Unit.\n\nICT:\n\nThe Institute began to inject ICT into its activities with the arrival of the System Analyst II, Tivde Tertsegha, who began to upload information about the Institute on the University website and also to create a database of soft copy of information regarding the Institute. Also there were e-learning programmes and partnerships with international universities in America. Contacts were made with organizations such as IARD to mount e-learning programmes on conflict resolution and peace mediation. A memorandum of understanding for a multi-lingual Igbo driven dictionary project with soft-copy software presented by Prof Emeritus Alex Animalu of Physics and an adjunct professor of the Institute, is before the University Administration for consideration and approval. This project has also produced some primers authored by Prof. Animalu.\n\nThe Library:\n\nThe Library was revamped and a new catalogue was championed by Justice Ihedire Nwamuoh, a Higher Executive Officer, employed on December 23, 2008 after concluding his one-year compulsory NYSC programme in the Institute Library under Mr. Joseph Irobi as Librarian. New books were brought into the Library and increased registrations for use of its facilities were begun by both senior students and scholars in various fields. The Higher Executive Officer underwent a training course in the main Library of the University and then became suitable as an Institute\u2019s library staff.\n\nTivde, Tertsegha, System Analyst II\n\non duty\n\nThe Museum:\n\nThe Museum was headed by Mrs. Maureen Onyejegbu. She began an increased effort to publicize the existence of the Museum to the University Community and organize exhibitions shortly after she was employed in 2008. She approached the then Director of the Institute in July 2008 for permission to advertise the museum on LION FM, a radio station of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. The objective was to invite the University Community and the entire Nsukka community to come to the museum for sight seeing, recreational activities, educational activities, research purposes, detailed information on the displayed artifacts, books and souvenirs on display. The curator in her interview in Lion FM explained to the public the need to promote the Igbo culture. She explained further that the museum had a fundamental challenge to the society especially to children. Apart from teaching them numeracy and literacy, they would be taught how to see and understand what they looked at. She urged the public not to carry on in the old ways of life or try to mystify the past; this is because what people find quaint and unattractive may not be so in reality. She said museums are for everybody. It is there for entertainment, research and education. The knowledge and appreciation of cultural artifacts, their roles in the society in the past and their uses even prepare one for a better tomorrow.\n\nNwamuoh, Justice Ihedire, B.Sc (Hons) (Nig)\n\nHigher Executive Officer/ Ethnographer.\n\n(Institute Librarian)\n\nThere was also an annual excursion organized by the Curator in which tertiary and secondary school students, primary school pupils and the general public where invited to the Museum in order to acquire cultural education and to be entertained as part of the then yuletide celebrations.\n\nIn the Museum also, there were yearly lectures for students of the departments of Library Science and Archeology & Tourism. Practical guide was empowered by the Museum to help students to appreciate the importance of cultural education as they proceed in their courses of work.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that the Institute museum had an alliance with the Archeology Museum in which visitors to the University Museum where redirected to the Institute Museum because of a major reconstruction work being carried out in the University Museum. Inventory of the Museum artifacts was also done in the year 2008. The Museum store was in disarray but it was reorganized during this period also.\n\nExhibitions:\n\nDuring an exhibition to mark the 48th Founder\u2019s Day of the University in October 2008, the Museum section of the Institute brought out cultural artifacts that were very valuable to the admiration of the public. This team was led by the Curator, Mrs. Maureen Onyejegbu and Mr. Lucky Okpara, the Technical Officer. The Cinematographic Unit displayed the two new astounding movie documentaries of the Institute, Living With Our Heritage and Zik of Africa.\n\nIn 2008 also, the Institute opened an Exhibition Center to display the products of the Institute. The center is located at the ground floor of the Institute building. This move was aimed at making available for public assessment the products from the Institute. Books, journals, movies and other art works were among the items that were displayed in the center. That year also, a University Professor in the United States of America, Prof. Oriji, donated twenty boxes of books to the Institute of African Studies through the office of the then Vice Chancellor. The then Vice Chancellor, Prof. C.O. Nebo sent a letter of appreciation to the Professor thanking him for the kind gesture. The purpose of these books was to support the reengineering efforts of the Institute.\n\nResearch:\n\nThe Institute boasts of a number of research fellows who are presently moving ahead in the areas of presenting papers in conferences and embarking on Institute research activities.\n\nNwankwo Tony Nwaezeigwe, PhD,\n\nSenior Research Fellow, IAS (as umpire during an IAS programme).\n\nDr. Nwankwo T. Nwaezeigwe explored \u201cThe Ethno-Historical Background to Igbo Entrepreneurial Spirit\u201d. The research was completed and documented as an impressive twenty-paged article for the book, African Entrepreneurship in the New Millennium edited by E.J. Otagburuagu in 2009. Dr. Nwaezeigwe also expertly handled \u201cThe Igbo Identity Problem and the Nigerian Democratic Order: The Culture and Religious Bankruptcy Questions\u201d. It was published as part of the proceedings of the 2008 International Conference of the Institute held from July 2nd to 3rd under the book title, Governance in Africa in the 21st Century edited by Prof. Otagburuagu. He had a formidable book out in 2007 arising from the basis of his Masters Dissertation in his bas department, History. The book was titled, The Igbo and Their Nri Neighbours: A Study in the Politics of Igbo Culture and Origins. It authoritatively provided hard-to-dispute evidences of the Igala origins of the Nri people, generating far-reaching implications that translate to whether the Nri had any basis for their claim of being primogenital in Igboland and if they could preside over any kolanut breaking ritual in a general gathering of Igbo people. Examples of uncertainty and disputes amongst the Nri as demonstrated by their kings are amply described and reported by the author. Even the tenuous cord placed between Nri and Igbo-Ukwu was decisively severed for want of synchrony of the carbon 14-dated age of the Igbo-Ukwu archeological findings with the reported period of migration of Eri. The 340-paged book revealed a thorough-going researcher, who is at once fearless as he is meticulous, giving the impression of carefully picking broken pieces of utensils in his hurry, if any. The book was published by Snaap Press, Enugu (Nwaezeigwe, 2007). Today, it is sending academic ripples around the entire Igbo world. A core-traditionalist, Dr. Nwaezeigwe doubles as the traditional prime minister or Odogwu of Ibusa in Delta State of Nigeria. The Igbo and Their Nri Neighbours is his fourth book.\n\nAmbassador Joseph Ayalogu went into an extensive research with Jeff Unaegbu which resulted in the article \u201cThe Nigerian Youth in the Diaspora: A Partner in National Development: Challenges, Opportunities and Options\u201d. The thirty-eight-paged article was published in the book, The Youth and National Development in Nigeria edited by Jeff Unaegbu, Prof. EJ Otagburuagu and Dr. Nkiru Ohia in 2010. Talks of a book growing from the work were held.\n\nDr. Ani Casmir focused on \u201cTalent, Entrepreneurship: Challenges of Developing a Working Framework for Good Governance in Africa\u201d. It was published in African Entrepreneurship in the New Millennium.\n\nFrom Left: Amb. Ben Amobi and Amb. Charles Cocodia with former Ambassador to Switzerland, Amb. Joseph Ayalogu (Adjunct Senior Research Fellow of the IAS) at the induction course for new ambassadorial appointees in Abuja, April 2011.\n\nJT Omenma researched on \u201cEssentials of Entrepreneurship in a Developing Economy: A Case of Informal Trade in Africa\u201d. It was published in African Entrepreneurship in the New Millennium. He also submitted an article titled \u201cYouth and Sports in Nigeria\u201d for the book, The Youth and National Development in Nigeria.

He also published two articles, each co-authored with Prof. Alex Animalu. They are \u201cICT as Language for Governance in Africa in the 21st Century\u201d (published in Governance in Africa in the 21st Century edited by Prof. Otagburuagu) and \u201cThe Resolution of Two Worldviews: Values for a New African Leadership\u201d (published in Perspectives on Leadership in Africa edited by Egodi Uchendu, Pat Uche Okpoko and Edlyne Anugwom (2010).\n\nIn January 2010, Mr. Unaegbu initiated an idea about a History of the University of Nigeria (from 1985 to 2010). He made efforts to graft the project into the activities of the Institute. It was inspired by the first history of the University from 1960 to 1985 edited by Prof. Emmanuel Obiechina, Prof. John Umeh and Prof. Chukwuemeka Ike. Involving the experiences of Professor Emeritus Alexander Animalu, Professor Emeka Otagburuagu (then Director of the Institute) and Professor Sam Onuigbo (who later became the Director of the Institute), the project was commenced. Professor Emeka Otagburuagu suggested that the scope of the project should be widened to cover the entire period of existence of the University from 1960 to 2010. After a while of waiting for funds from the University Administration, and assured of the backing of his seniors, Mr. Unaegbu committed his personal funds to the task of retrieving information from all the departments, faculties, schools, centers, unions and institutes in the University, personally handing letters to many departments in Enugu and Nsukka campuses in 2010. Unfortunately, only very few departments willingly submitted their information. Incidentally, in early 2011, the publications committee of a national committee on the 50th anniversary of the University wrote to the Institute of African Studies requesting staff of the institute working on the project to merge with it so as to prevent duplication of efforts for a history of the University of Nigeria. This was because the committee discovered that the Institute was already working on the vision through letters sent to departments when it began its own work later on. Consequently, Mr. Unaegbu wrote a long letter detailing the origins of the vision and submitted every document to the committee through his Director in the Institute of African Studies. He also handed over the draft (about 400 pages already) in hard and soft copies. Then, he immediately began to develop another book from a previously submitted article for the University history titled \u201cThe History of the Institute of African Studies, University of Nigeria, Nsukka\u201d. This former article has become the history book in your hands\u2026.\n\nOpening prayer before an Institute in-house meeting. IAS Secretary, Adaozo Orjiekwe (extreme left beside Tivde Tertsegha, System Analyst II) and IAS Director, Prof. Otagburuagu (extreme right)\n\nAward:\n\nIn what was regarded as the first of its kind in the history of the University of Nigeria, the Nebo Administration doled out awards to deserving staff of the University. He gave out these awards at the Princess Alexandria Auditorium during the 48th Founders\u2019 Day. Amongst those so honoured was the Director of the Institute, Prof. E.J. Otagburuagu. Speaking at the occasion, the former Vice Chancellor expressed delight at the performance of the awardees, who worked tirelessly to see that the University of Nigeria became the Harvard University of Africa. He implored other staff to re-dedicate themselves to the task of uplifting the University.\n\nThe Onuigbo Administration (2010-2012, 2012- )\n\nIn August 2010, a new Director was appointed. He was Prof. Sam Onuigbo, a former Head of the department of English. Beginning with a religious stance of prayers for success of the activities of the Institute, the new Director began moves to consolidate the gains of the former administration. Though a new administration, it was able to execute a number of lectures and conferences within a short period.\n\nThe Administration organized a public lecture on December 17, 2010 at the Seminar Room of the Institute in which Prof. Catherine Acholonu, Country Ambassador UNCCD Forum of Arts and Culture and Director, Catherine Acholonu Research Center, presented one of her books and gave a lecture on it. The book was titled, The Lost Testament of the Ancestors of Adam.\n\nA cross-section of participants during the Catherine Acholonu Lecture in December, 2010\n\nThe lecture attracted some eminent scholars including Prof. Damian Opata, former dean of the Faculty of Arts and Prof. Edwin Okafor, dean of the Faculty of Arts. The lecturer dwelt on the beginnings of world civilizations as being traceable to an Igbo origin, including a profound proposition that the Igbos lived before the homo sapiens, Adam. Of course, an explosive question-and-answer session came after the lecture. The video clip of the lecture was captured by the Cinema Unit and uploaded into Mr. Unaegbu\u2019s Channel in Youtube, an internet-based visual library. The video was titled, The Lost Testament of the Ancestors of Adam. It is still attracting hundreds of viewers and scathing comments.\n\nThere was an end-of-year party, probably for the first time in the Institute, championed by the Welfare Committee which was created naturally by the influx of employees into the Institute. Its first chairman was Mr. J.T. Omenma, later, Dr. Ohia succeeded him.\n\nAnother public lecture on the relevance of retaining the dying Igbo language was organized by the Institute. It was delivered by Prof. Pita Ejiofor, former Vice Chancellor of the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, in early 2011. It attracted minimal audience because of low publicity.\n\nThe Institute also organized a very successful 7-day African Education and ICT Conference with the theme, Oche Ndi Igbo Bunyere Asusu Igbo. It was in collaboration with the IT & C Networks Ltd (Distributors of MSI Laptops), Traditional Council of the Federation of Social Science Students Association of the University of Nigeria (FOSSA) and Golden Heart Foundation, Lagos. It was held from the 17th of May 2011 to the 24th of May 2011 using the Princess Alexandria Auditorium and seven Faculty Halls at the Nsukka Campus of the University. There were sub themes dwelling on life after school, developing a good business plan, web applications, hardware/circuit board fabrication technologies, solar energy technology, computer networking and administration, application software design and development III, website design, maintenance and development and work while in school concept. This conference attracted a special guest of honour, Chief Dr. Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, who donated some fund to the Institute. Other dignitaries who graced the conference included Chief Sam Ogbonna Onyeisi (Chairman, Board of Hotel Presidential Enugu). Mr. Sam Onyishi (CEO, Peace Mass Transit), Hon. Dr. Pat Asadu (Member, House of Representative, Nsukka Igbo Eze Federal Constituency), Hon. Barr. Tony Ugwu (Chairman, Nsukka Local Government Area), Prof. Pita Ejiofor (former Vice Chancellor, Nnamdi Azikiwe University), Mr. Etele Obinna (Chief Executive Officer, With-Worth Group), Dr. Chidi Okpaluba (CEO CEFARRD in proxy through a female representative) and Pastor Edafiogho Dennis O.C. (ICT Resource person for the University of Nigeria). The success of this conference was largely due to the excellent contact network of a student, who doubled as the Igwe of FOSSA, HRH Nsoffor Chinedu (founder of the Work While in School Foundation).

Two of these \u2013 English and History \u2013 became the core departments of the Faculty of Arts when the institution grouped its academic units into faculties. The creation of the faculty in 1960 was in line with one of the four factors which formed the background of the philosophy founding the University. The Faculty was established to preserve the dignity of the African, as expressed by the National Congress of British West Africa when the struggle for national self-determination was at its earliest. No doubt, the faculty was to fill this need considering the fact that Nigerian history and culture appeared to have been relegated by the colonial powers. The University needed to take into account the historical and cultural aspects of Nigeria. Too much emphasis must not be placed upon science, technology and rationalism at the expense of the history of the independent nation. Therefore, it was the belief of the advisers that the Faculty of Arts should receive pioneer attention in the plans of the University.\n\nOver the course of 54 years, the faculty has also grown and expanded. Within the first few years of the faculty\u2019s establishment, it operated with only 24 academic staff members but today, the Faculty boasts of over 180 well-qualified academics committed to the core values and philosophy of the University. The first Dean of the Faculty was a Briton, Dr. J. A. Noonan (later Professor Noonan). He was succeeded as Dean in 1965 by Professor M. A. Achufusi of the Department of History, who returned from Leipzig, Germany to contribute to the development of the Nigerian educational system in the wake of independence. Professor Achufusi became the first Nigerian to head the Faculty. Other Deans since then are: Professor Adiele Afigbo, Professor S.C. Ukpabi, Professor Benson Oluikpe, Professor Elizabeth Ihekwazu, Professor E.P. Modum, Professor A.U. Ohaegbu, Professor S.A. Ekwelie, Professor V.E. Chikwendu, Professor Emeka Nwabueze, Professor O.N. Njoku, Professor O. K. Oyeoku, Professor D.U. Opata, Professor Inno Nwadike, Professor Edwin Okafor and Professor Uchenna Anyanwu. The current Dean of Arts is Professor Pat Uche Okpoko.\n\nNumerical growth in staff and student population has been witnessed over the decades. A faculty that started with 81 students in 1960 \u2013 47 students in History Department and 34 students in English Department \u2013 has grown numerically and can boast of about 5000 students and robust academic programmes in different disciplines. From two departments, the Faculty has grown and now has nine departments. The departments are History and International Studies, English and Literary Studies, Archaeology and Tourism, Foreign Languages and Literary Studies, Fine and Applied Arts, Theatre and Film Studies, Linguistics, Igbo and other Nigerian Languages, Mass Communication and Music.\n\nThe Department of History and International Studies was one of the pioneer departments of the university. Initially named History and Archaeology until 1981, the Department has undergone changes in reaction to academic and global market forces of demand and supply. On September 29, 2004, the University Senate approved the revised programme and name change from History Department to Department of History and International Studies. In the same vein, the Department of English, which had Dramatic Arts as a sub-department, had its name changed in 2004 to Department of English and Literary Studies after reviewing its curriculum to address current national needs.\n\nThe Department of Linguistics, Igbo and Other Nigerian Languages started as a sub-department under the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures in 1974, and in 1981, it gained its autonomy as a full-fledged Department. Dr. P.A. Nwachukwu was its pioneer Head of Department. The Department was until 2005 called and referred to as Department of Linguistics and Nigerian Languages.\n\nIn 1961, the Department of Mass Communication, then known as the Jackson College of Journalism was established at the University of Nigeria. In 2006, the Department started PGD and Ph.D programmes and revised its Masters programme. In 2007, the department acquired fully digitized radio and TV studios.\n\nThe Department of Fine and Applied Arts was founded in 1961 and since inception has developed and popularized Igbo patterns for body and wall painting known as Uli. It has produced world-acclaimed artists in all aspects of the course.\n\nThe Department of Theatre and Film Studies, also known as the Robeson School of Dramatics is named after renowned African-America actor Paul Robeson. It started as sub-department of Dramatic Arts. The department achieved a full departmental status in 2004 and since then it has graduated many students at first degree and higher degree levels.\n\nThe Department of Archaeology was founded on August 1, 1981, when the department separated from the Department of History. It began with a B.A. Combined Honours Programme. In 1985, the single honours programme was introduced. In an attempt to bring the departmental programme in line with current trends in Archaeology as well as the desire to equip students to face the challenges posed by today\u2019s globalized environment, the Department of Archaeology in 2004 developed an embracing curriculum leading to B.A. Hons in Archaeology and B.A. Hons in Tourism, lately changed to B. A. Hons in Archaeology and Tourism. Consequently, the department changed its name to Archaeology and Tourism, and awards in addition PG.D, M.A. and Ph.D degrees.\n\nThe Department of Foreign Languages and Literature was first established in 1961 under the name, Department of Languages. Subsequently, the Department was renamed Department of Foreign Languages and then later, Department of Foreign Languages and Literary Studies. It offers French as the major degree programme and German, Russian and Spanish as subsidiaries.\n\nThe Department of Music has also been productive since inception in 1961. It was the first autonomous university department of music in Nigeria. It is in fact the mother of all the Departments of Music in Nigerian universities. Its programmes are designed to produce skillful, versatile and experienced musicians and musicologists, emphasis being placed on performance and competence. The graduates and diplomats are trained to appreciate, analyze, practice and communicate African and world music as performance as well as literary art.\n\nThe motto of the faculty is Arts for Living. This motto aptly captures the academic and creative engagements of the faculty. The faculty has since its inception graduated hundreds of doctoral candidates and thousands of Masters and bachelors degree students who are well placed and are helping to develop society in virtually all fields of endeavor both at home and abroad."}, {"url": "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:University_of_Nigeria,_Nsukka", "page_content": "This category has the following 8 subcategories, out of 8 total.\n\nMedia in category \"University of Nigeria, Nsukka\"\n\nThe following 37 files are in this category, out of 37 total."}, {"url": "https://searchworks.stanford.edu/catalog?q=%22Afigbo%2C+A.+E.+%28Adiele+Eberechukwu%29+%22&search_field=search_author", "page_content": "Philanthropy and humanitarianism left out in the cold, 1830-84/85\n\nThe coastal phase, ca. 1885-1900\n\nThe hinterland phase I : blood and iron, 1900-1914\n\nThe hinterland phase II : courts and constables, 1900-1932\n\nThe hinterland phase III : courts and constables, 1933-50\n\nConclusion.\n\n(source: Nielsen Book Data)\n\n\"The Abolition of the Slave Trade in Southeastern Nigeria, 1885 - 1950\", is a history of the campaign waged by Great Britain in colonial Nigeria from approximately 1885 on, to abolish the internal slave trade in the Bight of Biafra and its hinterland, a region also known as Eastern Nigeria, Southeastern Nigeria, the Eastern Provinces, or the trans-Niger Provinces. It treats the internal slave trade and the war against it in this region and period as themes separate from the institution of slavery in the same area and the campaign to root it out generally known as emancipation.For this reason, and because slavery and the effort at emancipation have received more attention from scholars, this work concentrates entirely on that aspect of the slave trade and its fortunes under British colonial rule commonly known as abolition. In reconstructing the story of this important and protracted campaign, Adiele Afigbo sheds light on a dark corner of social history that has largely been neglected by historians.

The establishment of the Hansberry College of African Studies in the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, was approved in September 1962 by the Governing Council of the University of Nigeria as a graduate Institution. The College was opened on September 23, 1963 with a four-day Seminar at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka campus, with the title, \u201cThe Emergence of African Political Thought.\u201d This Seminar was attended by eminent scholars and authorities on African studies from many places in Nigeria and overseas. The keynote address was delivered by Professor William Leo Hansberry, an eminent Afro-American Historian and Africanist, whose name the college bears and who was designated its Director. The Hansberry College was renamed Hansberry Institute of African Studies in 1964. Prof. William Leo Hansberry had taught Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe and Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, two students who later became first indigenous Presidents of their countries, Nigeria and Ghana, respectively.\n\nAs W.L. Hansberry, the Director, was not resident (but visiting Nsukka once in a while from the United States), his deputy, Professor Edward Wilmot Blyden III, an orator, Professor of Political Science and grandson of the famous Blyden, was made the acting director but later became the substantive director in 1964. (Onyeneke, 1984). Professor Blyden was a former Head of Department of Political Science in the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.\n\nIn the active part of this phase, before the outbreak of the civil war, the major activities included the following:\n\n1. Preparation of annotated Bibliography of Africana\n\n2. Preparation of Anthologies of Readings in Africana\n\n3. Acquisition of oral, written, pictorial and cartographic sources for the study of the government, society, history and religion of Nigeria\n\n4. Research into Biographies of eminent Nigerians\n\n5. Research into rise and growth of political ideas\n\n6. Research into History of Nigerian Journalism\n\n7. Establishment of a museum of antiquities\n\nProf. W.L. Hansberry (non-resident Director) 1963-64\n\nWhen Prof. Hansberry was the Director, the Institute organized lectures and symposia on various aspects of African history and culture. This was natural since Prof. Hansberry was an Afro-American scholar of the history and culture of black peoples. The Institute also embarked on the first three aspects of the first phase. These were one, preparation of annotated Bibliography of Africana, two, preparation of Anthologies of Readings in Africana, and, three, acquisition of oral, written, pictorial and cartographic sources for the study of the government, society, history and religion of Nigeria.\n\nHappenings in this first phase also included the empowering of the Institute of African Studies in 1963 to be a school for post-graduate research for the degree of Masters. It was to prepare and present candidates for post-graduate degrees in African Studies, on its own right. This programme was expanded by the Senate of the University on April 12, 1967 beyond Masters Degree by research to include Masters Degree by course work. The Institute followed this up by developing and advertising its post-graduate coursework programme. The Senate confirmation of its approval for the full teaching programme was given on July 21, 1970, after the Nigerian Civil War. In the 1970/71 session, failure to implement the programme was due to the poor state of equipment of the various departments of the University (e.g. history, geography etc) which were to be intimately involved in the programme. Again, rehabilitation after the civil war had not gone far enough.\n\nProf. Edward Wilmot Blyden III (Political Scientist) (Director) 1963-64\n\nAfter another unsuccessful bid in 1973/74 when the Institute had gone to the extent of admitting some candidates for their postgraduate programme, this programme was frozen. (Ukwu, 1986). During the Nigerian crisis of 1966, the Institute experienced improved staff position because of the influx of scholars of eastern Nigerian origin from other universities into the University of Nigeria.\n\nProf. SN Nwabara (Historian) acting Director (October 1966-71) substantive ( 1972-81)\n\nThe Institute was motivated to embark on a number of projects which would \u201chelp to realize the ideals of its founders\u201d (Afigbo, 1971:89). In 1967, as part of the preparatory process, the then Vice Chancellor, Prof. Eni Njoku, set up the first executive committee of the Institute \u201cwhose creation brought to an end what virtually had been the era of \u2018one man show\u2019 in the history of the Institute\u201d (Afigbo, 1971:89). Part of its duties was to advise the Director in the planning and execution of the research and teaching programmes of the Institute, and in the staff recruitment, development and conditions of service. Members were Dr. S.N. Nwabara (Chairman and acting Director of the IAS); Mr. E.B. Ndem (Sociology/Anthropology); Dr. D.D. Hartle (History/ Archeology); Dr. Kalu Ezera (Political Science); Dr. J.C. Ene (Natural History); Prof. J.C. Anene (History) and Mr. B.O. Nwabueze (Faculty of Law).\n\nAlso, during that period, the Institute started building up an ethnographic museum. There were also plans for the establishment of the Center for Creative Writing in the Institute which was to be staffed initially by Mr. (now Prof.) Chinua Achebe (already world-famed by then) and Mr. Christopher Okigbo, then a young poet of distinction. (Afigbo, 1971:89).\n\nThe Committee which became the first Advisory Board had hardly begun moves on the proposed M.A. teaching programme, on a new Institute Journal and on an ethnographic museum when the civil war broke out. (Onyeneke, 1984).\n\nIt is important to mention here that the great energy behind the founding of the Institute of African Studies, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Professor William Leo Hansberry, died while visiting relatives in Chicago. Prof. Hansberry died at Billings Hospital of a cerebral hemorrhage on November 3, 1965.\n\nThe war ended in 1970. Every plan and intention pre-war was lost. Afigbo (1971:90) narrates:\n\nBy the time the war ended not only the schemes projected for implementation in the 1967/68 session were abandoned, but the progress which had been made in the collection of rare documents and materials for research, as in assembling highly valued pieces of ancient art and material culture were frustrated. Much ground had been lost, the administrative records of the Institute destroyed, and some of the scholars perished. Among the irreparable losses in men were Professor J.C. Anene, who died from natural causes; the gifted poet, Christopher Okigbo, who died in action; the political scientist Professor Kalu Ezera\u2026and the sociologist Mr. E.B. Ndem, who was out of the country at the time hostilities came to an end and who has yet not been able to rejoin the staff of the University. The Institute had to begin again from the scratch.\n\nThe ethnographic materials (relics and artifacts), books and documents collected pre-war had been lost and dispersed, thus, this was essentially a reconstruction phase. The Executive Committee was reconstituted in 1970, with the place of the missing members being taken by the new appointees, comprised the following: Dr. S.N. Nwabara (Chairman), Professor EO Awa, Dr. JC Ene, Dr. CC Ifemesia, Professor ANA Modebe, Mr. BO Nwabueze and Mr. Elochukwu Amucheazi as Secretary. There was also Prof. G.O. Onuaguluchi (Medicine) and Dr. GEK Ofomata (Geography). It had the task of rehabilitation by reviving the projects already approved for the Institute and re-defining its objectives. These objectives were redefined as (i) recovering the past of the peoples of Africa, (ii) dealing with the current social problems and (iii) encouraging and projecting their living art and culture.\n\nA set of activities were then developed and they subsequently became the regular ones for the Institute:\n\n(i) the organization of (a.) public lectures (given by outstanding scholars of the University or by visiting scholars. A celebrated scholar, Prof. Chinua Achebe, became a senior research fellow of the Institute from 1970 to 1973. Until 2009, his office space was preserved in the Institute to memorialize him. The space also served as storeroom for editions of Okike, a literary journal he founded. Dr. C.C. Okereaffia and Mr. T.U. Nwala were also deployed from the General Studies around November 1971 to the Institute as Research Fellow in Language and Junior Research Fellow in Philosophy respectively), (b.) staff seminars (where academic staff of the University discussed their projected research schemes) and (c.) workshops (for teamwork on the study of different aspects of African culture, history and social problems),\n\n(ii) organization of individual research programmes of the research fellows of the Institute with research focus on the Igbo, the Efik/Ibibio, the Ijaw and the peoples of Ogoja,\n\n(iii) development of an ethnographic museum to hold artifacts, archeological pieces and remnants of the civil war showing the ways of life of the people. Part of this museum is a modern art gallery. This gallery has since hosted a succession of significant exhibitions,\n\n(iv) establishment of a research library which, today, holds documents, bibliographies, books and rare publications and the assembling of oral and written sources for African studies.\n\n(v) Issuance of Institute journals through the Institute\u2019s Publication Unit,\n\n(vi) a photographic unit, and,\n\n(vii) experiments in the performing arts.\n\nTHE YEARS: 1970-1976\n\nAmongst the main achievements of the Institute during the commando session or rehabilitation term (as March to June 1970 was popularly called in Nsukka) was the recruitment of more research staff into the Institute. In addition to the acting director, Dr. SN Nwabara and Mrs. K. Okonjo (research fellow in sociology) who were there before the war, the Institute acquired the services of Mr. Chinua Achebe (senior research fellow in literature), Miss Felicia Ifeoma Ekejiuba (research fellow in social anthropology), Mr. Meki Nzewi (research fellow in music & drama), Mr. JN Oriji (junior research fellow in history). (Afigbo, 1971:90).\n\nFor the experiments in performing arts, two musical dramas set in Nigerian culture were presented by the Institute to enthusiastic audiences across Nigeria. The dramas were \u201cA Drop of Honey\u201d and \u201cThe Lost Finger\u201d both by Meki Nzewi. \u201cA Drop of Honey\u201d was an award winning entry in the 1971 African Arts Competition organized by the African Center, University of California. Los Angeles. In 1973, the Institute organized, for the first time, a Cultural Arts Festival entitled \u201cIgeri\u201d. It was aimed at showcasing creativity and talent in dance-dramas of the past and present in Nigeria. The folk myth of life and death, and life in death was the theme. The Igeri burial music-dance-drama from Arochukwu was chosen. It is not clear whether the four-day drama and seminar were held as was planned.\n\nAt the end of the 1970/71 session, Dr. S.N. Nwabara left for the United States to help set up a programme of African studies. Dr. A.E. Afigbo was asked to act as director from July 1, 1971. The acting Director began to move the Institute from the stage of \u201cprojections\u201d to that of \u201cimplementation\u201d (Afigbo, 1971:91).\n\nIn the area of research, the Institute began to concentrate on the peoples and cultures of south-eastern Nigeria. As at that time, documentation of the ways of life of this region had not kept pace with those of the rest of Nigeria, and the University of Nigeria had the only facility in the area. (Ukwu, 1986:282).\n\nThe photographic Unit:\n\nThis Unit later became the Technical Services and Cinematographic Unit in the 1980\u2019s. It produced black and white photographs manned by one Mr. Nwankwo on Salary Level 5. He served in the Institute from about 1970 to about 1978. A skilled still photographer, Mr, Nwankwo used the studio space of the Unit for photographic laboratory work. The active period of use of this studio as a photo laboratory was from 1971 (after the Nigerian Civil War) to about 1978. Water was available at this time through pipes to the studio. The still photographer had a neat way of registering snapshots or films using a yellow file and jumbo cards such that films can be easily traced and developed and photographs can be easily located and handed over to their owners. A pile of about 400 copies of these yellow files are still available and are packed away in a file cabinet as at the moment. Because of the departure of Mr. Nwankwo to Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, in 1978 for a more serious and lucrative photographic engagement, the studio was abandoned. (Unaegbu, 2011). But before his departure, some items of equipment have been attracted to the studio, however obsolete. Among these items were a Bolex 16mm cine camera, which, was jammed badly and required overseas attention to make it operable. Aside from the cine camera, three twin lens, reflex, still cameras (very old), and photographic laboratory equipment were acquired.\n\nPublication Unit:\n\nFor the venture on journals, the Institute\u2019s Publication Unit began Ikoro, formerly Ikorok (so named from July 1971-March 1972, ending with Vol. 1, No.3. The first name was an Ibibio version of the Igbo Ikolo or Ikoro. It suggested by Mr. Udosen of Fine Arts). The Ikolo is a huge talking drum made from the trunk of an iroko tree used in spreading \u201cserious information as well as for celebration on ritual occasions\u201d. (Afigbo, 1971:91). The Ikoro bulletin was designed to publicize the work of the Institute and the researches going on within the University or elsewhere in Nigeria and beyond in the area of African studies. It appeared first as Ikorok in July 1971 and began to appear two times a year in January and July from the mid 1980\u2019s. It was first edited by Miss Felicia Ifeoma. Ekejiuba. At the same time, approval was given for the Institute to publish a journal titled Ikenga. Dr. (later Prof.) A.E. Afigbo served as its first editor. Other editorial board members included Dr. Edet A. Udo (associate-editor), Dr. S.N. Nwabara, Professor E.O. Awa, Professor J.C. Ene, Dr. C. Ogwurike, Dr. D.I. Nwoga, Professor B.N. Okigbo, Rev. E.C. Ilogu, Mr. S.C. Nwoye, Mr. V.C. Amaefulah (art-adviser) and Mr. J.N. Oriji (acting secretary).\n\nIkenga is a personal god of achievement whose physical representation, a figure with ram horns, symbolizes the strength of the right arm with which a man achieves greatness. The cultural artifact is common amongst the northern Igbo people; but it is by no means exclusively preserved there. The journal, Ikenga, was designed to showcase articles in all areas of African studies.\n\nAfigbo (1971:90) explains:\n\nIt is not committed to any political views, but is dedicated to encourage the application of the highest scholarship to the investigation of the achievements and setbacks of the blackman down the ages, as well as to the study of his contemporary problems and dilemmas.\n\nThe first issue appeared in September 1971.\n\nThe Publications Unit also produced a book under what was described as the Institute\u2019s Occasional Publications consisting generally of proceedings of workshops, seminars, public lectures and results of researches of the Institute\u2019s research fellows which was published by the Institute itself. These included the published public lectures of John Hunwick, the proceedings of the conference on Indigenous Laws called African Indigenous Laws edited by Drs. T.O. Elias and S. N. Nwabara in 1975. (Ukwu, 1986:283).The book ran through 376 pages and was launched on November 29, 1975 at Enugu Campus of the University by Mr. M. O. Balonwu, the then Chief Justice of the East Central State. (Ubah, 1976).\n\nAlso, Mr. Chinua Achebe, senior research fellow in literature, began to publish Okike, a new journal of creative writing, which, by 1971, had already recorded notable success.\n\nThe Institute Research Library:\n\nProf. S.N. Nwabara, one of the Directors of the Institute, once said in his foreword to a Library classified list book by Eleanor Mangold, \u201cFirst and foremost, the Research Library is a collection of materials for reference by research workers\u201d. (Nwabara, 1973).\n\nAfter the war, recovery of books and documents began again from scratch (no book) to 800 collections. Many were gifts donated by individuals and organizations and the Institute\u2019s own purchases, even though buying was severely restricted.\n\nMr. (now Prof.) Chinua Achebe\n\nSenior Research Fellow, IAS (1970-73)\n\nThe recovery was facilitated by three factors:\n\n1. The keen interest of the University authority in the work of rehabilitation.\n\n2. The generous gifts by friends of the Institute, particularly the programme of East African Studies, Syracuse University, New York, that made available from its holdings all the books and documents on East African countries, and,\n\n3. The voluntary services of Mrs. Eleanor Mangold as the Institute\u2019s honorary acting librarian (from August 1972 to April 1973). She authored Classified List 1. Some 470 titles were assembled together with 400 other publications comprising IAS publications, seminar and research papers, and a foundation collection of government document materials. The book was compiled both as a temporary substitute for a cataloguing guide and as a record of titles. (Nwabara, 1973).\n\nThe library became a place of study where researchers worked with the materials they might wish close at hand and unhindered by the movement and bustle of a larger and less intimate library. As a specialist library, it is meant to supplement the collections held at the Africana Division of the main library of the University. According to Prof. S.N. Nwabara, the library became \u201cthe vat from which history itself will be distilled in 50, 100, 500 years\u2019 time.\u201d How prophetic were his words as this present book was distilled from the \u201cvat\u201d (Nwabara, 1973).\n\nPublic Lectures:\n\nPublic lectures of the Institute during this phase included, Oral Literature delivered by Prof. Robert G. Armstrong (Director, Institute of African Studies, University of Ibadan, March 1971), The Study of African Politics by Mr. Ukpabi Asika (Administrator of the East Central State of Nigeria, May 1972), Igbo Ukwu Excavations by Prof. Thurstan Shaw (Department of Archeology, University of Ibadan, February 1972), The Role of Literacy in West African Moslem Society in the Pre-colonial Period by Prof. John Hunwick (University of Legon, Ghana, March 1972), The Development of Islamic Scholarship in its West African Environment by Prof. John Hunwick (March 1972).\n\nWorkshops and Seminars:\n\nWorkshops organized by the Institute during this phase (1970-75) included a. Igbo Language and Literature (1971); b. Nsukka: The Problems of Change and Continuity (1972); c. Peoples of South-Eastern Nigeria (1972); d. African Indigenous Laws (1974); e. Dependency and Underdevelopment in Western Africa (1974). The seminars/workshops were designed to garner data on specific areas in order to prepare the way for the launching of the \u201cfull-blown programme of the Institute\u201d, especially its focus on the peoples of Southeastern Nigeria. Efforts were made to assess very closely the research works which had already been concluded about the people of Southeastern Nigeria, map out important areas to embark upon and decide on methodologies.\n\nTo Afigbo (1971:92):\n\nThis is necessary as a way of high-lighting the immensity of the problems which will remain to be tackled in the study of these peoples, avoiding unnecessary duplication of effort and questioning some of the cozy positions which some of us are already tending to assume with regard to the past and current problems of this area. It would also help to effect economy by ensuring that the little money and manpower available are not spent on issues which have long ceased to be problems.\n\nInstitute Museum:\n\nBy January 1975, one John Onyishi stated that the Institute museum collection had \u201cgrown from the initial hundred pieces to\u2026 over four hundred specimens of antiquities\u201d. Serially numbered, there are some 404 art/ cultural objects physically lodged in the museum. These resource materials had very scanty information for accession. (Uche-Okeke, 1984). Exhibitions at the Institute\u2019s museum and art gallery during this period included, Drawings and Paintings by Prof. Uche Okeke (December 1972), Two Thousand Years of Chinese Paintings by UNESCO (February 1974), Deep Etchings, Lino Cuts, Bronzed Lino Reliefs and Paintings by Bruce Omobrakpeya (April 1974), Graphics by Dr. Nick Wilkinson (April 1974), Leo Frobenius 1938 by Institute of Foreign Cultural Relations/ Frobenius Institute, Odunke Art Exhibition by Uzo Ndubisi (November 1974), National Role in Modern Mass Communication- Sculptures, drawings, prints and poems by U. Uko Akpaide (November 1974), AFAAS\u2019s Week Exhibition by Association of Fine and Applied Arts (March 1975), Dyed Fabric, Wall hangings, Burnt-Scorched Wooden Wall, Plaques exhibition by Ego Okeke, El Anatsui, Uche Okeke and Onyebuchi Okadigwe (May 1975), Sessional Examination Exhibition by Department of Fine and Applied Arts, UNN (June 1975), Jigida Paintings by Bons Nwabiani (June 1975). (Ukwu, 1986).\n\nA Dictionary of Igbo Proverbs Project:\n\nThis was begun in the Institute of African Studies at about 1973, championed by D.I. Nwoga. For a proper understanding of the workings of the Igbo mind, a study of Igbo proverbs is crucial. Additionally, proverbs represent major imaginative activities which are literary in their impact. It is not surprising therefore, that most Igbo writers, whether writing in Igbo or English, have incorporated proverbs from the oral traditions into their works. Moreover, future generations of Igbo people and people interested in Igbo need some permanent record of these units of Igbo imagination and wisdom. Though the project was initiated in the early 70\u2019s, and preliminary collections were made with the aid of students of English Department and a research grant of N2000 from the Imo State Cultural Division of the Ministry of Information, Youth and Culture, Owerri, it had not been possible to pay adequate attention towards implementing a major part of the project. (Nwoga, 1984).\n\nAs at 1971, the Institute had just ten scholars who were also working on very important projects. They included:\n\nDr. S.N. Nwabara (Director) (Research Project: A Century of British Contact with the Igbo, 1860-1960), Afigbo (Senior Research Fellow in History) (A history of Nsukka), Chinua Achebe (Senior Research Fellow, Literature) (African Revolutionary literature from Olaudah Equiano to the present day) (Igbo Verse and Drama), Edet A. Udo (Senior Research Fellow in History) (The Efik-Ibibio in the pre-colonial period), C.O. Okoreaffia (Senior Research Fellow, History) (Igbo language Studies), Miss Felicia Ifeoma Ekejiuba (Research Fellow, Social Anthropology) (The Area of South eastern Nigeria), Elochukwu Amucheazi (research fellow, political science) (Political dynamics in Eastern Nigeria with Emphasis on the pressure groups, Particularly on the role of the church in the politics of Eastern Nigeria), Mrs. Kamene Okonjo (research fellow, sociology) (The role of women in social change), Meki Nzewi (research fellow, Music and Drama) (Synthesis of music, dance and drama in contemporary Nigerian theatre), and, John N. Oriji (junior research fellow, History) (A history of Ngwa people). In 1975, the Institute was blessed with another notable researcher in Law, Barrister JC Aghaji.\n\nEarly Collaborations:\n\nThe Institute remarkably had early contacts and encouragements from the Institute of African Studies, University of Ibadan and the Department of Archeology of the same University; the Historical Society of Ghana; the Scandinavian Institute of African Studies; the Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Afrika-Forschung, Hamburg; the Institut National des Langues et Civilizations Orientales, universit\u00e9 de la Sorbonne Nouvelle ; the Federal Department of Antiquities, Lagos, the Summer Institute of Linguistics (British School), Surrey; the Centre of African Studies, University of Warsaw (Poland), and the Makerere Institute of Social Research, Kampala (Afigbo, 1971:92).\n\nTHE YEARS 1976-85\n\nAs more universities and more states were created, the Institute\u2019s programmes came to specialize on the Igbo people and their neighbours. The long tenure of Prof. S.N. Nwabara, from 1966 to 1981, saw to the stability in the projects of the institute. He had the task of putting the Institute on a solid footing after the civil war. Through sheer hard work and the cooperation of the Institute Research staff, he was able to leave a strong stamp on some of the programmes handled. In 1981, a fresh policy for all institutes of the University was developed by the Senate. The new policy was meant to attach research staff to the Institute for limited periods of time and for specific work project and also to avoid prolonged tenure for even a director. That same year, a new director was appointed, Prof. Donatus I. Nwoga.\n\nAdministrative Unit: Mr. Johnson Osonwa Anya Okwara from Ohafia was the Administrative Officer and Secretary to the Institute from 1982 to 1989. He may have been the first Administrative Officer of the Institute of African Studies after the war. He served as a member of the Advisory Board of the Institute in the 1983/84 session and in other capacities.\n\nEthnography Unit: The Igbo Salvage Ethnography Project (SEP):\n\nA new line of research called the Igbo Salvage Ethnography Project (SEP) was kicked off by the new director. It was undertaken from 1982. Its aim was to build up a large collection of primary information on the Igbo way of life, covering all the parts of Igboland, which will be available for future scholarly work on the Igbo people. Recorded information would be both audio and visual, and should include assorted events in the current life of the people and interviews on traditional events and the historical past as far as these can be recounted. Special areas of information sought were guided by the present lines of interest of scholars of the University. Sixty-one undergraduates of this University from the different disciplines of study (Arts, Science, Social Science Education, Agriculture etc.) were selected as Field Research Assistants in a manner that represented all the Igbo speaking local government areas in what were then Anambra, Imo, Bendel and Rivers States of Nigeria. They were employed by the Institute to collect required data during their long vacation of two months (July to September) in 1982. (Onyeneke, 1984) (Nzei, 1984:52). Again, in the 1983 long vacation, sixty-seven students were also employed just like the year before and an additional six students were hired to work on a specific project for Dr. Anazodo. Also, some students continued some special research after the long vacations. (Nzei, 1984, 52). Research fellows and other scholars of African Studies helped in the processes towards making this project a successful one. In fact, a research committee was established by Prof. Donatus Nwoga in which members of the Institute contributed wonderful ideas and worked assiduously to make a success of the ethnographic project. (Aniakor, 2011:82).\n\nA Dictionary of Igbo Proverbs Continues:\n\nIn an attempt to kick off the Dictionary of Igbo Proverbs project (see Second Phase) alongside gathering general information on Igbo life, the then Director, Professor Donatus Nwoga, instructed and equipped the seventy-three students with exercise books and cassette tapes. In exercise books, they were required to jot down any proverbs that they heard or that they generated in private interview. They were then to seek and write down the explanations of proverbs collected from a number of informants, as well as note down the contexts in which the proverbs could be used. On cassette tapes, and with portable cassette recorders, they were to record discussions in which proverbs were likely to be used, like settlement of cases, marriage ceremonies, village drinking parties etc. they were also to record discussions of proverbs with elders. Essentially, the Director wanted them to produce records of the actual language of proverb usage and discussion from the primary carriers of Igbo Tradition. This is necessary since, quite often, because of failures of translation by people not conscious of the implications of the original language and its world value, the meanings of Igbo concepts are arbitrarily altered. Training courses were given to the students by academic staff who required data collected in their fields of research interest. Courses on use of recording equipment were also given by the then Cinematographer and Research Fellow, Raymond Wright. At the end of the 1983 vacation exercise (July to September), the Institute garnered about 2000 proverbs turned in the exercise books of the student field research assistants. (Nwoga, 1984). This was aside from the data bank of recordings on magnetic tapes for the larger Igbo Salvage Ethnographic Project which garnered primary data on Igbo life covering diverse fields of interest, including religion, philosophy, social life, literary and productive arts, history, science, medicine, technology etc. The data bank was held in a special section. (Ukwu, 1986:284). Some of the more enterprising students were also able to get photographs and antiquities which included various symbols of ikenga, okike, otuleka, okwa chi, masks etc. (Nzei, 1984:52). By 1986, cataloguing of these data had begun. This was to show the type of information held, the tape where each is held, and the place from which it was collected, in order to be available for study through a well compiled index.\n\nProf. Donatus I. Nwoga (English) Director (1981-84)\n\nDuring the 1983/84 session, vigorous activity was set in motion under the supervision of the then Institute\u2019s NYSC staff, Mr. A. A. Nzei, for the co-ordination and transcription of the taped material. A transcribing machine was bought and students were hired mainly from the University, and they were engaged in transcription of the recorded tapes even up to January 1985. (Onyeneke, 1985:9). Areas covered included Igbo worldview, Igbo Ethnomedicine, Igbo Music, Rain making, Igbo divination, folktales, masquerades and festivals, mythology, proverbs, politics etc. The Institute acquired about 3000 taped cassettes for this Igbo Salvage Ethnography Project.\n\nMuseum Unit:\n\nMrs. N.E.O. Uche-Okeke was the curator of the Museum from about August 1977 up until 1986. The museum, during this phase of the Institute\u2019s growth, was a treasure house and an invaluable visual library. Its artifacts served as educational tools to disseminate the unique contributions of African culture through well documented and publicized exhibitions. The absence of trained personnel and the difficulty in obtaining basic technical and conservation facilities since August 1977 made the Curator\u2019s duties difficult.\n\nThere was the sorting out of the museum\u2019s permanent art collections. There were pottery, metal (tools, weapons, instruments, currency, staff of office), wood (Nkwu, Agwu, Ikenga, Masks, titular paraphernalia utensils, musical instruments), stone, bones and ivories (jewellery, horns), textiles (Aji, Akwa Mmili, and Akwete) and architecture (Obu, Mbari). These items were documented and preserved. And exhibitions continued just like in the second phase of the Institute\u2019s growth up until a grand exhibition called the Ikenga\u2019 83 exhibition from July to November 1983. Exhibitions in 1976 included, Academic Star Launching and Exhibition by Daily Star Group of Papers (January), Nsukka Works 1972-1975; drawings paintings by Dr. Nich Wilkinson (February), First Steps by Tayo Adenaike and Gbubemi Amanoritsewor (February and March), Nigerian Contemporary Arts by Staff of Fine and Applied Arts Department (March), Ceramics by Benjo Igwilo (May) and Graphics Design (Paul Chapman and George Adams).\n\nFrom July to November 1983, the Institute of African Studies mounted an exhibition of the Ikenga, a cult and art object of the Igbo. It was fully sponsored by the University. Help was obtained from the National Commission for Museums and Monuments Lagos, Odinani Community Museum Nri, Mbari Art Center (Eke Nguru Mbaise), Obu ofonri Museum Enugwu-Ukwu, Asele Institute (Nimo), Ikenga group from Aguleri, University Library, CUDIMAC and the Faculty of Arts (Fine and Applied Arts, Archeology, Drama, Linguistics and Nigerian Languages) etc. The Institute museum was able to document and display numerous and varied Ikenga icons for view by the members of the University community and interested public. The opening ceremony was officiated by Igwe Osita Agwuna III of Enugwu-Ukwu (founder of Obu Ofonri Museum, Enugwu-Ukwu) and the then Vice Chancellor (Prof. Frank Nwachukwu Ndili) with the committee of deans.\n\nThe Reconstructed Obu Shrine in the Institute Museum\n\nTraditional chiefs including Chief Nwamba of Eha-Alumona were present. The NTA Enugu, Ikenga Age grade from Aguleri, Ikorodu Dance Group from Nsukka, Mmonwu Asaa Masquerade troupe from Aguata and the general University public lent grace and splendour to the occasion. The museum was given a long-desired face-lift for the occasion. The Exhibition was designed to flow visually. The introductory panel contained blow-up photographs of Ikenga with general notes and inset map of Igboland to familiarize the viewer with the theme of the exhibition and whet his appetite for yet more comprehensive information lodged in the icons in the gallery and the Obu shrine. A typical Obu shrine was set up to bring home vividly the various functional aspects of the Ikenga and its place in traditional Igbo ritual existence. The sequence and visual flow went on to general Igbo art. Artifacts, particularly in wood, were exhibited to illustrate Igbo basic design principles and art types. It was seen that wood-sculpture is an art-form of the Igbo men-folk and pottery that of the Igbo female-folk. The exhibition plan then moved from general to detailed fanfare on Ikenga showing its iconography, beliefs illustrating the presence of the notion of the strength of the right hand, and showing Ikenga among other ethnic peoples of Nigeria such as the Igala, Edo, Urohboh and Ijaw.\n\nThe exhibition concluded with a section to show the influence of Ikenga art form on contemporary designs in Igboland. This exhibition attracted several hundreds of visitors from outside and inside the University. The Museum visitors Book recorded almost one thousand (1, 000) signatures for the period of the Ikenga\u2019 83 Exhibition compared to only 318 signatures of visitors to the Museum from January 1981 to May 1983. a detailed inventory of the museum\u2019s permanent collections was achieved in part through documented expositions such as Ikenga \u201983 and a seminar on Ikenga and Igbo Life and Thought. (Uche-Okeke, 1984).\n\nCinema Unit (audio-visual studio):\n\nWhen the Institute was about to embark upon the Igbo Salvage Ethnography Project, it became obvious that there was a need for supplying video services for recording events, and for creating a visual documentation of Igbo traditions, culture and history. It is germane to note that in 1978, a still photographer, Mr. Nwankwo, left the Institute for another engagement, thus the Photo Unit was under lock and key for four years until 1982. Through the excellent contacts of the then Curator of the Institute museum, Mrs. N.E.O. Uche-Okeke, Mr. Raymond Wright, an African-American, was summoned from abroad and employed on contract basis. With the arrival of Mr. Wright, who was made a Research Fellow I and Cinematographer (placed on Salary Level 13), and because of renewed efforts on cinematographic activities by the then Director of the Institute, Prof. D.I. Nwoga, who took over from Prof. Nwabara in 1981, the photo studio was reopened in October 1982. There was an emphasis on film coverage and editing. The cinema unit was to provide the facilities for visual research to be conducted in the field, as well as supply the IAS audio visual library, which aside from films and video tapes produced within the IAS, would house collected visual material of relevant nature from other sources. Again, this desire to establish a cinema unit came from a realization on the part of the Director, Prof. D. I. Nwoga, that visual and audio research was becoming increasingly important in documenting African, and consequently, Igbo culture. Upon moving into the Photo Unit that would serve as the basic studio work area, it was discovered from equipment found, that a cinema unit had been the intention of Prof. S.N. Nwabara, the former director. The Bolex 16mm cine camera that was found, however, was jammed badly, and required overseas attention to make it operable. Aside from the cine camera, three twin lens, reflex, still cameras (very old), and photographic laboratory equipment were found. It was decided that because of the equipment on hand, that the studio space should have water restored to it, so that it would not only serve as a film editing room, but also a revived photographic laboratory. To provide a room with long enough \u201cthrow\u201d from viewing 16mm films it was necessary to remove a partition that separated the space and install an air-conditioner for comfort (the room was sealed off from light). Earlier in 1982, cinematography equipment had been selected from price lists provided by a London supplier. An order for the first group of equipment was placed in August 1982. This order included the 16mm crystal sync. Sound camera; lenses; the crystal sync., Nagra tape recorder; and accessories, such as fluid head tripod, super-directional microphones, lighting, etc. This order formed the basic production equipment. A second order was placed in March 1983. This order was for the six plate, automatic, horizontal, editing console, capable of simultaneously editing one picture and two tracks of sound. Other editing accessories, and accessories to upgrade the existing 16mm camera, were ordered (the 16mm camera was taken overseas in August 1983 for repair). This last order formed the basic post- production equipment. With these items of equipment, Mr. Wright and, sometimes, hired students and junior staff, were able to perform duties that have become useful to researchers today. Mr. Lucky Okpara, then a junior staff (but as at 2010 when he retired, a Principal Technical Supervisor) assisted Mr. Wright in the video coverage activities. After a while, Mr. Okpara was sent on technical training to Jos, Plateau State. The Studio encountered the beginner\u2019s difficulties such as lack of foreign exchange to ensure the Institute\u2019s overseas suppliers their payment for cinema equipment ordered. An attempt to bring the equipment and pay for the repair of the IAS existing equipment failed in September 1983. Equally frustrating was acquiring equipment within the country 16mm equipment was virtually non-existent, and portable video cameras and video tape recorders (VTR\u2019s) were very expensive. Then, the small lightweight, portable equipment was very much in demand by novice video users. Another major problem had been to get genuine cooperation from the U.N.N. Works Department. To get simple projects accomplished such as installing an air-conditioner or removing a partition was a long and arduous task, and oftentimes, in the end, outside help was solicited. Nevertheless, activities in this studio from that October 1982, include the photographic documentation of the IAS Museum collection. After camera repairs, Mr. Wright began to photograph each item in the museum collection, which he thought would serve a two- fold purpose. As there was no visual record of the complete museum collection, he felt that in the event of theft, the Institute could offer the authorities more than just a written description of the item, by providing a photocopy of the photograph along with all other pertinent information, (i.e. size, distinguishing color marking). This was also invaluable information for insurance claims. A color print attached to an information sheet can be vitally important in gathering information on museum artifacts, since the items themselves, cannot be taken to the filed for research. This would aid the IAS museum in augmenting and cross checking its own data. Before camera failure, and the first research advance was expanded, approximately one hundred and seventy- two items had been photographed. Many of the sculptural items have been photographed from two views. By Mr. Wright\u2019s estimation, about two thirds of the collection has been photographed. There was also the Photographic research for \u201cIkenga 1983 Exhibition. In preparation for the IAS exhibition of Ikenga, Mr. Wright traveled to Nri several times to photograph the Odinani museums collection of Ikenga, and photograph actual ancestor shrines with Ikenga in situ. The archeology department\u2019s collection of Ikenga was also photographed and the upgrading of their documentation has been achieved through cross-checking of the photographs through field research. The result of this work has been design of the Obu in the exhibition; many enlarged photographs displayed in the exhibition, and illustrated notes on the Ikenga and iru mmuo (Igbo ancestral altar). In the Cinema studio also, video tape editing was a primary feature. With the loan of a portable video tape recorder (VTR), Mr. Wright and his assistants succeeded in editing two video tapes, of two hours each from the opening ceremonies of \u201cIkenga 1983 into one video tape of one and a half hour. This electronic editing was done using the most rudimentary equipment, and the audio dub and insert capabilities of the IAS JVC VTR. Using the same on- loan portable VTR and IAS\u2019 video camera, Mr. Wright was able to video tape the Ikenga exhibition itself with particular emphasis on the ancestor altar. He was also able to video tape the rare wall paintings by women, located inside the Odinani museum, in addition to the same type of paintings on the walls of an Alusi temple by the name of \u201cIyiagi\u201d, in Agbadana, Nri. The tape included a brief narrative description by Mazi Benjamin Akuune Ewuocha of Obeagu, Nri. He was an Ozo priest and Mr. Wright\u2019s major informant. During 1983, a full proposal including a budget for the 16mm film production of \u201cSigwe Bansi is Dead\u201d for the sub-Department of Drama was executed. The proposal involved some months of research, and journeys to Enugu and Lagos. The filming was to be sponsored by the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria: in keeping with a promise the President personally made to the University of Nigeria in 1982. The film was never made. Using the IAS\u2019 dual audio cassette decks and equalizer, Mr. Wright produced thirty-five re-mastered four track, cassettes, as part of the IAS\u2019 permanent collection of audio tapes for the Research Library.\n\nMr. Raymond Wright, Cinematographer and Research Fellow I in his office after an ethnographic filming.\n\nHe also tested the high speed, two track cassette duplication system by completing two hundred and thirty-five two track dubbings. (Wright, 1984). Regular services until 1986 included, duplication of research tapes, duplication of Ethnographic salvage tapes, enhancement and duplication of research tapes, and, video taping/editing. Unfortunately, Mr. Wright\u2019s contract expired in 1985. He sought to renew it but was informed by the Personnel Services Department that a new individual had been trained for the job. The new individual happened to be Mr. Lucky Okpara. He took over from Mr. Wright in 1986 during the tenure of Prof. Uche Okeke as Director of the Institute. And then, inventory of the items of equipment was done. With the departure of the Curator in 1986, Mr. Okpara handled both the Cinematographic Unit and the Museum! Of course, the enormity of the dual responsibilities was telling on one individual. The studio was very sterile during this period. Hence, the studio was seldom opened. Mr. Okpara concentrated his attention on the Museum.\n\nResearch:\n\nThere were many research projects and workshops from 1975 to 1985. The workshops included The State of Igbo Studies: Towards Establishing the Roots of Igbo Civilization (June 8-10, 1982) (with topics from mostly arts and social sciences departments) and Ikenga in Igbo Life and Thought (November 22-23, 1983) (with papers from Prof. A.E. Afigbo (Review of Ikenga Scholarship), Dr. C. Aniakor (An Artistic Approach to the Ikenga Symbol), Mrs. Ego Uche-Okeke (Ikenga and the Female Archetype) etc. Research projects completed included those by Achebe Chinua (African Revolutionary Literature from Olaudu Eqiano to the present day/ Igbo Verse and Drama), Afigbo, A.E. (A History of Nsukka), Amucheazi, E. (The Political Dynamics of Eastern Nigeria with emphasis on pressure groups particularly on the Role of the Church in the Politics of Eastern States), Chukwukere, I. (i. Igbo Beliefs and Rituals associated with Chi, ii. Changing Patterns of Authority and Leadership in Uzoagba Village Group), Nwala, T.U. (Oracles: Their place in the traditional cosmological order of the Igbo), Uba, C.N. (Otanzu-Otanchara Society and Culture: A case study of Igbo Cultural History), a team project to understudy the Owerri-Orlu Zone etc. Research grants were approved by the Institute for research by scholars of the University from different disciplines. The total grants approved by the Institute to support these projects amounted to N32, 707, ranging from the sum of N800 to N10, 000 for a single project. This was in the 1981/82 academic year. In 1978, the Institute had Professor VC Uchendu of Anthropology as a Visiting Professor. Also, in 1982, Dr Nnabuenyi Ugonna of English came in as a Visiting Research Fellow. That same year also, Rev. Dr. A. Onyeneke of Sociology came into the Institute as a Visiting Research Fellow II.\n\n20th Anniversary of the Institute:\n\nAside Ikenga \u201983, which was part of the activities to mark this anniversary, Prof. Edward Wilmot Blyden III, grandson of the famous pan-negro patriot, E.W. Blyden, and a founding father of the Institute returned as a visiting Professor from October to December 1983. The Institute sponsored a series of lectures given by him. He gave lectures on the following topics: Building a University: Challenge and Triumph (November 17, 1983); Africana at Nsukka Revisited (November 21, 1983) and Towards \u20181984\u2019: Crisis in the Search for an African Personality (December 1, 1983).\n\nPublications Unit:\n\nOccasional publications during this phase included Institute Monograph Series; Studies in Igbo Civilization; Foundation of Igbo Culture/ Civilization; Nigeria in the 1980s; Igboland in Transition 1900-1950 (by Dr. C. N. Ubah); Traditional Igbo Medicine (by Dr. M. M. Iwu); and Ikenga in Igbo Life and Thought. Ikoro was last published in January 1977 (Vol IV, No. 1) under the editorship of Dr. C.N. Ubah. Seven years later, it was published in July 1984 under the editorship of Rev. Dr. A. Onyeneke. This edition was probably stimulated by the twentieth anniversary of the Institute. An impressive history of the Institute from 1963 to 1983 was successfully completed by Dr. Onyeneke and published as part of this Ikoro edition. Ikoro continued until it was stopped in July 1985.\n\nProf. Uche Okeke (Fine/ Applied Arts) Director (1984-86)\n\nTHE YEARS 1986-2005\n\nThis period appears the most sterile in the history of the Institute, mainly due to the unavailability of funds and fund raising reaches to implement the great ideas of each passing director. Each director sometimes used their private funds to run the affairs of the Institute. Nevertheless, seminars and workshops were carried out occasionally and publications were made.\n\nThe Aniakor Administration Begins:\n\nProf. Chike Aniakor became the Director of the Institute after Prof. Uche Okeke. In the 2011 Conference of the Institute of African Studies, Prof. Chike Aniakor revealed some aspects of his achievements in office as Director. He said:\n\nUnder my tenure as Director of the Institute, we organized jointly with the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, an International Conference on EthnoMedicine. Traditional medicine men and healers were invited, including pharmacologists and other research scholars. In the end, resolutions in the form of a communiqu\u00e9 opened a new mine of information on African pharmacopaea. It was also suggested whether it was possible to nurture an ecological garden of African herbal plants. \u2026. During my tenure, we also addressed the female side of indigenous knowledge by hosting a joint international conference with Faculty of Arts, under the Deanship of Prof. Oluikpe, on Igbo women in history. (Aniakor, 2011:83).\n\nPublications Unit:\n\nIn June 1992, vol 7, Nos 1 and 2 of the Ikoro was published after a seven year lull from 1985. It was edited by Dr. A.I. Okpoko. And its publication was possible from donations by Prof. M.A. Onwuejeogwu (Sociology/ Anthropology, University of Benin, N500) and Prof. A.E. Afigbo, then outgoing Director of the Institute (N700). From this publication, some of the events of this phase of the growth of the Institute were gleaned for this book.\n\nProf. C.C. Aniakor (Fine/ Applied Arts) Director (1986-88)\n\nResearch Unit:\n\nThere were series of annual seminars on Igbo Life and Culture jointly organized by the Faculty of Arts and the Institute of African Studies from 1986. They began from a book project on The Hero in Igbo Life and Culture initiated by Prof. D.I. Nwoga, then Dean of the Faculty of Arts. In 1985, a group of scholars drawn mainly from the Faculty of Arts had met a number of times in the residence of Prof. Nwoga to discuss the project. They included Prof. Nwoga himself, Prof. Iheanacho Egonu, Mr. Obiora Udechukwu, Dr. J.N. Oriji, Dr. Emeka Nwabueze, Dr. Obi Maduakor, Ezi-Nwanyi Patricia Nwoga, Dr. Chimalum Nwankwo, Dr. Nnadozie Inyama, and Chukwuma Azuonye. Participants in the seminar series were drawn not only from the University of Nigeria but from other universities in the country, notably Ibadan, Lagos, Imo State, Port-Harcourt, and Calabar. It then became necessary to establish a network of communication links with all the potential participants.\n\nA circular letter describing the project was dispatched. Ideas and people were gathered and before long the first seminar was held from May 15 to 17, 1986 with a keynote address by Prof. D. I. Nwoga on \u201cHeroes and Charlatans\u201d. It was successful due to the enthusiasm and commitment of the participants. In general, the papers presented affirmed the existence, universality and antiquity of the phenomenon of the hero in traditional Igbo life and culture and the persistence of the heroic image in Igbo oral literature. The second seminar was held from December 1 to 5, 1987.\n\nIt was on the image and position of women in Igbo society as agreed in the first seminar. During the second seminar, 50 out of the 55 papers gotten were presented. The Director of the Institute, Dr. Chike Aniakor, was quick in responding to an invitation by the Faculty of Arts to be involved in the running of the series. It was successfully held. Owing to unforeseen organizational problems at the Institute of African Studies, it was not possible to hold the third seminar in 1988 although the the theme, \u201cThe Igbo Worldview\u201d, had been agreed upon at the plenary session of the second seminar. On account of this lapse, the Faculty of Arts seriously considered reclaiming the seminar series. The impasse was however saved, first, by the persistent pressure of the then Dean of Arts, Prof. (Mrs.) Edith Ihekweazu, on the new Director of the Institute of African Studies, Dr. S. A. Ekwelie, to take some decisive measures to reinstate the seminar series, and secondly, by the appointment of Prof. A. E. Afigbo as Director of the Institute. He was quick to realize the value of the series, set up a new organizing committee which after a series of meetings was able to attract a generous grant of N6, 000 from the Vice Chancellor to stage the third seminar.\n\nProf. S.A. Ekwelie (Mass Communication) Director (1988-89)\n\nThe opening ceremony, on Monday, December 4, 1989, featured an address by the Director of the Institute, Prof. A. E. Afigbo; a welcome address by the then Vice Chancellor, Prof. Chimere Ikoku, represented by Professor J. N. C. Maduewesi, Dean of the Post Graduate School; an address by the Imo State Commissioner for Information and Culture read by Dr. J. N. Amankulor, and a vote of thanks by the Dean of Arts, Prof. (Mrs.) Edith Ihekweazu, the highlight of the occasion was a keynote address on \u201cThe Igbo World View\u201d by Prof. Chinua Achebe in which he enthralled the audience by involving them in the performance of an Igbo folk ballad. The response to the call for papers was so tremendous that for the first time in the series, several parallel sessions had to be organized during the two working days of the seminar, Monday, 4th December and Tuesday, 5th December. (Azuonye, 1992:12).\n\nOne feature of Prof. A. E. Afigbo\u2019s return to the Institute was the revival of the fortnightly seminars which he had introduced in the first place in 1972. A major aim of the series was to offer scholars in Nigeria and those visiting the opportunity to test the results of their research during an in-house discussion where they can benefit from friendly but informed criticism before venturing out into the wider and often unfriendly intellectual community. Many papers were discussed in this series. A seminar on Igbo Women in Socio-Economic Change ran from April 3rd to April 6th 1990. The proceedings would be published many years later in 2009 during the tenure of Prof. Emeka Otagburuagu as Director of the Institute. There was also another seminar on the decades of Igbo Ukwu held from 9th to 10th of January 1991.\n\nThe seminar explored some of the controversies generated by Prof. Thurstan Shaw\u2019s work in Igbo Ukwu, especially in the areas of dating and the interpretation of the finds and, second, to give broad indications as to the direction in which archeological, historical and cultural studies in the region should move to improve knowledge. Twelve papers from seasoned scholars were presented.\n\nThere was yet another seminar of the Institute of African Studies in honour of Prof. Adiele Eberechukwu Afigbo (OON, FHSN). It was titled, \u201cThe Big Drum for an Academic Warrior!\u201d. The seminar was held from the 17th to the 19th of September 1992. During the seminar, three of Prof. Afigbo\u2019s books were launched.\n\nThey were:\n\n(a) Groundworks of Igbo History\n\n(2) Images of Igboland, and,\n\n(3) Igbo Women in Socio-Economic Development.\n\nThese books were reviewed by Prof. A.O. Anya. There were three Chief Launchers for the three books. They were Dr. Pius Okigbo for Groundworks. Chief Nlemigbo (Ochiriozua of Mbaeri) for Images, and Lolo Enwerem for Igbo Women. Outgoing Director of the Institute, Prof. A.E. Afigbo, gave a valedictory lecture titled, \u201cOf Men, Women and History\u201d.\n\nProf. Adiele E. Afigbo, Director (1989-92)\n\nThere were renditions by the Oluimo (Imo State Choir) and there was music and dance by the Omenimo Dance Troupe in the George Marion Johnson Quadrangle. This seminar was done to appreciate the contributions of Prof. Afigbo to history in Nigeria, especially of the same breath as the pioneers of history in Nigeria such as Dike, Anene, Ajayi, Aderibigbe, Ayandele etc.\n\nProf. I.T.K. Egonu, Director (1992-96)\n\nGeneral: During the tenure of Prof. I.T.K. Egonu (1992-96), a seminar on Igbo Kingship Institution was held. It explored the unethical mode of installing many kings in Igboland in modern times. During this tenure too, the Cinema Unit was closed. As previously narrated, Mr. Okpara handled both the Cinematographic Unit and the Museum. And of course, the enormity of the dual responsibilities was telling on one individual. The studio was very sterile during this period. Hence, the studio was closed.\n\nProf. O.U. Kalu (Religion) Director, 1996-98\n\nMr. Okpara concentrated his attention on the Museum. Therefore, from 1986 to the undefined date during the Egonu tenure (1994-96), the studio was not given full attention. The dark period of the studio began when it was finally shut from use. During this tenure too, a wall mural was painted by Krydz Ikwuemezi of Fine and Applied Arts Department.\n\nProf. O.O. Enekwe (Theatre Arts/ Film Studies), Director (1998- 2004)\n\nThe Egonu administration was able to shoulder many responsibilities without adequate funding. Repair works on the collapsing ceiling of the Institute were carried out as at this time and a signboard was put up in the Hansberry Building to indicate that it was indeed the Institute of African Studies.\n\nThe next ten years from 1996 to 2006 were the darkest in the history of the Institute. And \u201cdarkest\u201d here means that what progress achieved during this period were not very accessible to the writers of this book.\n\nNevertheless, the Enekwe administration must have organized some seminars, including in-house seminars and a programme titled, \u201cOnodu Ndigbo Nime Nigeria Obu Ihe ha Mere Onwe Ha?\u201d (The Condition of the Igbo in Nigeria, is it self-inflicted?). It was done in November 2001.\n\nParticipants at the programme titled, \u201cOnodu Ndigbo Nime Nigeria Obu Ihe ha Mere Onwe Ha?\u201d (The Condition of the Igbo in Nigeria, is it self-inflicted?).\n\nThe publication of Ikenga and Ikoro were put on hold in the last ten years of this phase. This is mainly because of lack of funds and not at all because of the lack of ingenuity of the then staff of the institute. This is not to say that other staff of other climes of the Institute did not face similar circumstances, only that they were lucky enough to brave them.\n\nProf. Aloy Ohaegbu, Director (2004-06)\n\nDuring the Ohaegbu administration, there were about three staff members in the Institute. They included Messrs. Alex Nzei who came into the Institute as a NYSC ethnographer in 1983 after graduating from the University, C. Njokuocha and Lucky Okpara. The then Director, Prof. Aloy Ohaegbu, wrote requests for more staff and even shortlisted possible candidates and had the shortlist sent to the Department of Personnel Services of the University, but there was no response. The Museum was, by this time, almost abandoned and unkempt. The circumstance divested the lone staff, Lucky Okpara, of daily job routine as there were no visitors to the Museum. Nevertheless, Prof. Aloy Ohaegbu was able to purchase chairs for the seminar room of the Institute. He also bought a marker board for the room and tiled it. The lone generator which the Institute still uses as we write was bought during his administration. (Ohaegbu, 2012).\n\nTHE YEARS 2006-2012\n\nIn 2006, a new Director was appointed. He was Prof. Joseph Emeka Otagburuagu. He immediately held a meeting with the available staff of the Institute. Some of the problems the staff talked about included among others, lack of sufficient staff to man the highly specialized areas of the Institute, poor funding, lack of adequate facilities, and, failure to implement the postgraduate programmes of the Institute as approved by the University Senate and Council in 1967.\n\nFora:\n\nThe new Director set to work and, among other things, between May and October 2008, the Institute had organized a cultural seminar aimed at promoting and preserving the cultural heritage of the African, especially of South-Eastern Nigeria. The seminar was titled, Living With Our Heritage. The University community graced this occasion and the Vice Chancellor of the University, ably represented by the Deputy Vice Chancellor, Administration, Prof. F.I. Idike, noted with glee that the seminar had come at a time when the need for repositioning African culture was germane, since \u201cAfrican conventional morality and spirit of common sensitivity are deeply rooted in the culture\u201d. The Institute decided that this seminar would be organized annually to maintain the desire to promote African culture. It is unfortunate that, up to this moment, no other has been held. Two months later in July 2008, the University Community was astounded with yet another activity of the Institute, which was the First International Conference on Governance in Africa in the 21st Century. This conference attracted the United States Embassy and state governors in the country. The foremost professor of History, Prof. A. E. Afigbo was the chairman of the occasion. Among other dignitaries at the occasion was the former governor of Anambra State, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife. Presenting a paper at the occasion, the eminent Professor of Political Science, Prof. Obasi Igwe, noted that governance in Africa was mostly weaned on the altar of negligence of the common masses.\n\nEchoing the move of a former Director, Prof. Adiele Afigbo, the Institute embarked on two types of seminars in order to boost the general research activities in it. These were the House Seminars and the Fortnightly Seminars. The House Seminars was done indoors. Any interested member of staff of the Institute was involved in this venture. The Fortnightly seminars were for visiting scholars on issues of academic and contemporary interests. Scholars were assigned themes or would contrive individual themes to present at the expense of the Institute.\n\nUniversity Secondary School students performing at the New Arts Theatre during the Living With Our Heritage Programme.\n\nOn December 11 2008, the Institute organized a forum titled, \u201cWorthy Sons and Daughters of Igbo Land Forum\u201d in which a great philanthropist, Mr. Sam Onyishi, was also made a fellow of the Institute. In concluding his lecture titled, \u201cGod, Vision, Values and Management Excellence: Exploring the Peace Mass Business Model in Nigeria\u201d, Mr. Sam Onyishi promised the Institute a donation of 100 million Naira, and with tears of joy, he established his scholarship foundation in the Institute. He began a general renovation of the Institute around January 2009. The foundation now domiciled in the Institute known as, and called Samuel Maduka Onyishi African Entrepreneurship Foundation (SAMOAEF) has an endowment of a hundred million Naira (N1,000,000) for scholarship awards to Nigerians and the rest of the world. The SAMOAEF is a non-profit and philanthropic organization which is part of the Public-Private Partnership initiatives of the University of Nigeria and The Peace Group of Companies (Nig.) for educational development in the 21st century.\n\nThe primary objective of the Foundation, among others, is youth empowerment and capacity building through the medium of education. The Foundation believes that the major way to promote peace and development in the society is to give every person access to sound education. On May 13, 2009, the Foundation was inaugurated with its focus on reduction of unemployment, promotion of research, support of staff exchanges and linkages, giving of scholarship to deserving scholars and promote African entrepreneurship, it also pursued the creation and promotion of Igbo and African intellectual tradition. It awarded five overseas postgraduate scholarships to young Nigerians to study different courses in China. Some of these awardees have completed their Masters Degrees and one of them is now pursuing Doctorate Degree, two are into business and two are staff members of the University. One of them, Mr. Chinedu Asadu, who studied Chinese Language, has been employed by the University of Nigeria to teach Chinese Language studies in Nigeria. Almost 2000 applications were received by May 2010. 647 candidates met the stipulated requirements. The target areas of the scheme are as follows: Nsukka Cultural Zone, Other LGAs of Enugu State, Other Igbo States/ Communities, Other States of Nigeria; and, Africa and the world in general. Ten candidates were chosen from the target areas and 81 young men and women were awarded scholarships immediately. The SAMOAEF has continued to award scholarships annually to deserving Nigerian students even as we write.\n\nFormer governor of Anambra State, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife (standing), during the first International Conference of the Institute of African Studies in 2008\n\nThe Institute also organized a successful New Millennium Good Governance Project forum of December 18, 2008, in which the former chairman of Nsukka local government area, Honourable Dan I. Ugwuja, was made a fellow of the Institute. This project was launched on December 18, 2008 as part of the town and gown programmes of the Institute. The objectives were to monitor those in governance for purposes of evaluation and promotion of good governance ethics. The inspiration for this project came from the leadership model of the Nebo Administration and the communiqu\u00e9 which the participants to the Institute\u2019s International Conference on Governance in Africa in the 21st Century released. The project was situated in the Institute under the supervision of the Vice Chancellor. The Institute believes that a lot could be done through good governance to improve the lot of the masses in Africa. The project was flagged off with public lecture by the Chairman of Nsukka Local Government on the theme: Governance at the Grassroots.\n\nOn April 30, 2009, Chief Ojo Maduekwe, the External Affairs Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria presented the second lecture of the Good Governance Project on Our Challenge, Our Capacity: Nigeria and the New World Order. During the event, Chief Ojo Maduekwe promised to endow a chair with the sum of N30 Million in African Studies with his friends and to set up a Unit for International Studies and Diplomacy in the Institute. A follow up action had since been initiated for the recovery of these pledges.\n\nThere was also a memorial seminar for Prof. Adiele Afigbo, former Director of the Institute, who died on March 9th 2009, shortly after visiting the Institute in July 2008 during its International Conference in which he served as Chairman. His enormous contributions to the success of the Institute remain as clear as the existence of the sky in its history.\n\nPublication Unit:\n\nWith the new vision, dynamic innovation, willing spirit coupled with the excellent desire to leave an exemplary legacy worthy of emulation, the then Director introduced a number of productive reforms, innovations and measures to restructure the Institute. Staffs were occasionally gingered to meet up with the requirements in new technology and innovation of this century. They were asked to be focused and determined to work harder as the work in the Institute was considerable and required total dedication and a willing spirit to serve.\n\nAgain, the publication and documentation Unit of the Institute published a new book titled Governance in Africa in the 21st Century in Africa. This journal was the book of proceedings from the First International conference of the Institute in July 2008. It focused on governance problems in Africa. Its management was also highly specialized. The Board of Advisers included the Vice Chancellor of the University of Nigeria, Prof. C. O. Nebo, the Governor of Enugu State, Barr. Sullivan Chime, and many others. The Editor-in-Chief of the Governance in Africa in the 21st Century was the Director of the Institute of African Studies, Prof. E. J. Otagburuagu.\n\nThe Institute of African Studies also issued two books with the following titles, New Brides, More Hopes: Igbo Women in Socio-economic Change (edited by Prof. E.J. Otagburuagu and Prof. Adiele Afigbo) and Mass Creativity and African Development (Edited by Prof. E.J. Otagburuagu).\n\nThe two journals \u2013 Ikoro and Ikenga\u2014were last published in 1975 and 1992 respectively. But between mid 2006 and October 2008, the Institute published two volumes of Ikoro and two volumes of Ikenga (Ikenga International Journal of African Studies, Vol. 9 No. 1&2 of 2007). The journals were registered with the National Library and International Standard numbers assigned to them. Also between 2006 and 2008, the following were produced by members of Staff of the Institute and are available for exhibition and sale to the public: The Igbo and their Nri Neighbors, by Nwankwo T. Nwaezeigwe (2007), Senior Research Fellow, Institute of African Studies; 21st Century Igbo-Hausa-Yoruba, Tiv/ English Primer, by Alexander O.E. Animalu (Adjunct Research Professor), Emeka Otagburuagu (Director, Institute of African Studies) et al. (2008); A Darkling Plain (Novel), by Chris Agbedo (Senior Research Fellow, IAS) (2007) and Readings in African Studies, edited by A.E. Afigbo (Former Director, IAS) and E.J. Otagburuagu (Director, IAS).\n\nThe Institute also published two News Bulletins which somehow were a hybrid between the original vision of the Ikoro (which was to give light to activities of the Institute to the general public) and of a newspaper (which is to enlighten the public on news events around them). The first was edited by C. Njokuocha, with Ben Jones, Lucky Okpara, M. Omeje and E. Ezeanwu as co-editors. It was published on September 30, 2006 with a focus on the policy position and dreams of the Institute. The second edition was published on December 30, 2008. It was edited by Jeff Unaegbu, with Maureen Onyejegbu, Chinyere Ndubuisi and Awa Emmanuel Ogbu as co-editors. It brought in the concept of an editorial and a mission statement of the Bulletin. Its mission was to \u201cgive visibility to the works of the Institute and also other activities sponsored by it, to foster the preservation and maintenance of our cultural heritage, and, to inform its publics\u201d News about the July 2008 conference and miscellany were covered.\n\nPost graduate studies:\n\nIn 2006, new curricula were developed for Post Graduate Diploma, Masters and PhD programmes in African Studies. Senior academic staff members from affiliate Departments were very helpful in this regard. Each Department contributed significantly in the development of the curricula. The Vice Chancellor, Prof. C.O. Nebo, approved on behalf of the Senate that the post-graduate programmes of the Institute which the University Senate had approved since 1964, 1967, 1970 be immediately resuscitated. Consequent on this, the Dean of the School of Post-graduate Studies advertised the Post-graduate programmes of the Institute. The new curricula were ratified and approved by the School of Post-graduate Studies. Six students were offered admission in the 2009/2010 and 2010/11 session. Four of them were in master\u2019s degree programme (including Jeff Unaegbu, Senior Cinematographer and Head of the Cinema Unit, and Susan Orajaka, a research fellow), one in PhD (Mrs. Adaozo Orjiekwe, former Secretary to the Institute), and one for the post-graduate diploma programme (Mr. Emmanuel Ogbu, Senior Ethnographer of the Institute). The pioneer lecturers for Masters in African Studies were Prof. Agha AU Agha (IAS 507: African Religion and Philosophy), Prof. Inno Uzoma Nwadike (IAS 511: African Languages and Literature), Prof. Pat Uche Okpoko (IAS 504: African Ethnosciences), Dr. Peter-Jazzy Ezeh (IAS 509: African Political and Social Systems and IAS 513: Advanced Social Institutions), Dr. LC Ekechukwu (IAS 510: Principles of Museology and Cinematography), Dr. Tony Nwankwo Nwaezeigwe (IAS 502: African History and Environmental Studies), Dr. Sam Chukwu (IAS 513: African Music and Dance), Dr. Uche Nwaozuzu (IAS 513B: Masking Tradition in Africa), Dr. Nkiru Christiana Ohia (IAS 503: Gender and Role Dynamics in African Societies) and Mr. Jude Tochukwu Omenma (IAS 501: Principles and Methods of Research in African Studies).\n\nProf. Emeka Otagburuagu (English), Director, (2006-10)\n\nAdministrative Staff:\n\nThere had been a few members of staff who were in the Institute when Prof. Otagburuagu arrived as Director. They included Mr. Alex Nzei (Senior Research Fellow), M. Omeje (Research Librarian), Mr. Lucky Okpara (Senior Technical Supervisor), EAK Ukpai (Senior Executive Officer/ Acting Secretary to the Director), Mrs. Pauline Nwigbo (Assistant Chief Typist), Mr. S.U. Nwodo (Assistant Chief Typist), Mr. Obetta, H. Ayogu (Chief Messenger) and J. Ogbonna (Head Messenger).\n\nThe Director attracted the services of Dr. Ike Achebe (Chinua Achebe\u2019s son) as Visiting Senior Research Fellow, Dr. Ben Jones, an anthropologist, to serve also as Visiting Senior Research Fellow, and, R.C. Njokuocha as Research Fellow II. There was also Dr. V.C. Onu. Much afterwards, Ambassador Joseph Ayalogu became an adjunct Senior Research Fellow in the Institute. He had been Nigeria\u2019s past representative to the United Nations and ambassador to Switzerland. There was an unprecedented influx of staff into the Institute from 2008, courtesy of the Director, Prof. Emeka Otagburuagu and the then Vice Chancellor, Prof. C.O. Nebo.\n\nAbout thirty new graduates got employment into the Institute, including three Ethnographers (Amajo Onyemuwa Nnorom, Awa Ogbu Emmanuel, Michael-Aliga Chiamaka Precious), a new curator (Mrs. Maureen Onyejegbu Nwando), a new Cinematographer (Jephthah Elochukwu Unaegbu), an ICT System Analyst II ( Tivde Tertsegha), a camera operator for the Cine Unit (Chukwudi Onuigbo, an undergraduate then) and many Higher Executive Officers and Unit assistants (Tochukwu Nwadike, Carol Odoh, Kingsley Ifoh etc). The Institute also employed a considerable research force. A new senior Research Fellow (Nwaezeigwe Nwankwo Tony) was employed. He was formerly of the Department of History, University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Other Research Fellows were also employed. They included, Omenma Tochukwu Jude, Iwundu Ifeanyi Emmanuel, Aniago Magnus Aniago, Ohia Nkiru Christiana, Ibenekwu Ikpechukwuka Eugene, Okagu George Ogbonna, Ogbonne Ijeoma Pauline and Ezeigbo Joy Chisara. Unfortunately, one of the new staff members died of illness. He was Mr. Onyechi, a Higher Executive Officer.\n\nEthnographic Unit:\n\nIn line with the desire of the Institute of African Studies to salvage the gradual loss of information encoded in electronic form by early ethnographers of the Institute, the Administrative Unit of the Institute embarked on the transcription of information recorded in cassettes during the Salvage Ethnographic Project of the 1980\u2019s. Because of the sheer large quantity of information, the listing of the materials encoded in the cassettes alone took about four weeks to finalize. Part of the information salvaged were folk tales retold by old men in their own idiolects. There were also folk songs and detailing of marriage and burial ceremonies in different lands in the south-eastern parts of Nigeria.\n\nTranscription of Ethnographic tapes by administrative staff\n\nTechnical Services and Cinematographic Unit:\n\nWe have seen that the dark period of the Cine studio began when it was shut around 1996. It was opened again on February 14, 2007, and only then for inventory purposes. A new lease of life for the Cinema Unit began in May 15, 2008 when a new Cinematographer, Jephthah Elochukwu Unaegbu (Jeff Unaegbu), was employed. It was renamed the Technical Services and Cinematographic Unit. But tough days were ahead. Upon arrival into the Cine studio, he discovered that it had become the Augean stables. It was dusty, dank and cobwebbed and items of equipment had become obsolete. The new Cinematographer undertook an inventory and began to dust and wash. Within a week of his arrival, precisely on the 21st of May 2008, a cultural show titled, Living with our Heritage, was powered by the Institute. It was a modification of an idea he presented to the then Director, Prof. E.J. Otagburuagu. The original idea was to premiere, in the New Arts Theatre, a cultural movie directed by the Cinematographer for Prof E.J. Otagburuagu privately before he was employed. The title of the movie was Udaram.\n\nLeft to right: Jeff Unaegbu (Senior Cinematographer) and Samuel Ogbonna (Cinematographer) busy at work during an Institute\u2019s programme\n\nThe idea was modified to include cultural dances, folk songs by Dr. F.N. Ibemesi, folk music by Tivde Tertsegha (who was later employed by the Institute on the 23rd of December 2008), folk drama and presentations by departments of Music and Theatre Arts and the University Staff School and University Secondary School. During the show at the theater, the Cinematographer had to use his private laptop (A Toshiba product) to project the movie onto an old screen from the studio. A modern projector was obtained from a private hirer. The laptop power pack got burnt for lack of a stabilizer to stabilize the electric current generated in the theatre. After the show therefore, there was need for a studio computer system and other up-to-date items to make the studio worth calling a cinematographer\u2019s den.\n\nAn urgent proposal was drawn, requesting for the take-off items of equipment necessary for a modest cinematographic studio in the 21st century. Among other things, there was the need for a projector (preferably Sony) and a 73\u2019 by 73\u2019 screen onto which films would be projected for cine view. Both would cost N280, 000. Aside from serving as visual communication aid for the Institute, the projector and screen would be hired out to the University community at the cost of N2000 every day. There was and still is the potential of getting an average of N10, 000 every week in that internal revenue generating process. There was the need also for a Dell computer system with configuration of 200 Giga Byte Hard Disk Drive, Pentium 4 speed, 1 Giga Byte Random Access Memory, Digital Video Disk and Compact Disk SUPER ALL WRITE, 3.4 Giga Hertz, with Flat Screen 15\u2019 Keyboard and mouse. This would inevitably accompany the projector and would also be used for video editing of movies.\n\nIt was then sold for N100, 000. Movies could be edited for commercial video men after capturing is done. This would be another attempt at internal revenue generating process. There was the need for a Video Capture Card (Lightwave) (N20, 000). This is used to capture video from any camcorder after recording into a computer system as editable data. There was also the need for a videotape-to-CD Video conversion set (N100, 000). It would generate N1000 per conversion and could attract N30, 000 every fortnight into the Institute. A digital camera of very high resolution was also needed. A DVD/CD mass burner or DVD/CD duplicator machine was very juicy and therefore needed. It could generate N40, 000 in an hour of duplication! And there was also the need for a pianoforte for the production of movie sound track and as first step into implementing the new employee\u2019s contemplation of a complete music section in the studio.\n\nAfter many difficulties as detailed in an in-house unpublished history manuscript of the Cinematographic Unit, a new projector was gotten. Other items of equipment are yet to be bought due to lack of funds. Despite the difficulties, the Unit which presently has two Cinematographers (After Jeff Unaegbu, Samuel Ogbonna was also employed in April 2009) and a Camera Operator (Chukwudi Onuigbo) had produced many important video clips and documentaries using private items of equipment. They included Living in our Heritage and Zik of Africa directed by the Head Cinematographer, Mr. Unaegbu. An audio-visual library were these products would be stored and made available for research is being planned by the Unit.\n\nICT:\n\nThe Institute began to inject ICT into its activities with the arrival of the System Analyst II, Tivde Tertsegha, who began to upload information about the Institute on the University website and also to create a database of soft copy of information regarding the Institute. Also there were e-learning programmes and partnerships with international universities in America. Contacts were made with organizations such as IARD to mount e-learning programmes on conflict resolution and peace mediation. A memorandum of understanding for a multi-lingual Igbo driven dictionary project with soft-copy software presented by Prof Emeritus Alex Animalu of Physics and an adjunct professor of the Institute, is before the University Administration for consideration and approval. This project has also produced some primers authored by Prof. Animalu.\n\nThe Library:\n\nThe Library was revamped and a new catalogue was championed by Justice Ihedire Nwamuoh, a Higher Executive Officer, employed on December 23, 2008 after concluding his one-year compulsory NYSC programme in the Institute Library under Mr. Joseph Irobi as Librarian. New books were brought into the Library and increased registrations for use of its facilities were begun by both senior students and scholars in various fields. The Higher Executive Officer underwent a training course in the main Library of the University and then became suitable as an Institute\u2019s library staff.\n\nTivde, Tertsegha, System Analyst II\n\non duty\n\nThe Museum:\n\nThe Museum was headed by Mrs. Maureen Onyejegbu. She began an increased effort to publicize the existence of the Museum to the University Community and organize exhibitions shortly after she was employed in 2008. She approached the then Director of the Institute in July 2008 for permission to advertise the museum on LION FM, a radio station of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. The objective was to invite the University Community and the entire Nsukka community to come to the museum for sight seeing, recreational activities, educational activities, research purposes, detailed information on the displayed artifacts, books and souvenirs on display. The curator in her interview in Lion FM explained to the public the need to promote the Igbo culture. She explained further that the museum had a fundamental challenge to the society especially to children. Apart from teaching them numeracy and literacy, they would be taught how to see and understand what they looked at. She urged the public not to carry on in the old ways of life or try to mystify the past; this is because what people find quaint and unattractive may not be so in reality. She said museums are for everybody. It is there for entertainment, research and education. The knowledge and appreciation of cultural artifacts, their roles in the society in the past and their uses even prepare one for a better tomorrow.\n\nNwamuoh, Justice Ihedire, B.Sc (Hons) (Nig)\n\nHigher Executive Officer/ Ethnographer.\n\n(Institute Librarian)\n\nThere was also an annual excursion organized by the Curator in which tertiary and secondary school students, primary school pupils and the general public where invited to the Museum in order to acquire cultural education and to be entertained as part of the then yuletide celebrations.\n\nIn the Museum also, there were yearly lectures for students of the departments of Library Science and Archeology & Tourism. Practical guide was empowered by the Museum to help students to appreciate the importance of cultural education as they proceed in their courses of work.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that the Institute museum had an alliance with the Archeology Museum in which visitors to the University Museum where redirected to the Institute Museum because of a major reconstruction work being carried out in the University Museum. Inventory of the Museum artifacts was also done in the year 2008. The Museum store was in disarray but it was reorganized during this period also.\n\nExhibitions:\n\nDuring an exhibition to mark the 48th Founder\u2019s Day of the University in October 2008, the Museum section of the Institute brought out cultural artifacts that were very valuable to the admiration of the public. This team was led by the Curator, Mrs. Maureen Onyejegbu and Mr. Lucky Okpara, the Technical Officer. The Cinematographic Unit displayed the two new astounding movie documentaries of the Institute, Living With Our Heritage and Zik of Africa.\n\nIn 2008 also, the Institute opened an Exhibition Center to display the products of the Institute. The center is located at the ground floor of the Institute building. This move was aimed at making available for public assessment the products from the Institute. Books, journals, movies and other art works were among the items that were displayed in the center. That year also, a University Professor in the United States of America, Prof. Oriji, donated twenty boxes of books to the Institute of African Studies through the office of the then Vice Chancellor. The then Vice Chancellor, Prof. C.O. Nebo sent a letter of appreciation to the Professor thanking him for the kind gesture. The purpose of these books was to support the reengineering efforts of the Institute.\n\nResearch:\n\nThe Institute boasts of a number of research fellows who are presently moving ahead in the areas of presenting papers in conferences and embarking on Institute research activities.\n\nNwankwo Tony Nwaezeigwe, PhD,\n\nSenior Research Fellow, IAS (as umpire during an IAS programme).\n\nDr. Nwankwo T. Nwaezeigwe explored \u201cThe Ethno-Historical Background to Igbo Entrepreneurial Spirit\u201d. The research was completed and documented as an impressive twenty-paged article for the book, African Entrepreneurship in the New Millennium edited by E.J. Otagburuagu in 2009. Dr. Nwaezeigwe also expertly handled \u201cThe Igbo Identity Problem and the Nigerian Democratic Order: The Culture and Religious Bankruptcy Questions\u201d. It was published as part of the proceedings of the 2008 International Conference of the Institute held from July 2nd to 3rd under the book title, Governance in Africa in the 21st Century edited by Prof. Otagburuagu. He had a formidable book out in 2007 arising from the basis of his Masters Dissertation in his bas department, History. The book was titled, The Igbo and Their Nri Neighbours: A Study in the Politics of Igbo Culture and Origins. It authoritatively provided hard-to-dispute evidences of the Igala origins of the Nri people, generating far-reaching implications that translate to whether the Nri had any basis for their claim of being primogenital in Igboland and if they could preside over any kolanut breaking ritual in a general gathering of Igbo people. Examples of uncertainty and disputes amongst the Nri as demonstrated by their kings are amply described and reported by the author. Even the tenuous cord placed between Nri and Igbo-Ukwu was decisively severed for want of synchrony of the carbon 14-dated age of the Igbo-Ukwu archeological findings with the reported period of migration of Eri. The 340-paged book revealed a thorough-going researcher, who is at once fearless as he is meticulous, giving the impression of carefully picking broken pieces of utensils in his hurry, if any. The book was published by Snaap Press, Enugu (Nwaezeigwe, 2007). Today, it is sending academic ripples around the entire Igbo world. A core-traditionalist, Dr. Nwaezeigwe doubles as the traditional prime minister or Odogwu of Ibusa in Delta State of Nigeria. The Igbo and Their Nri Neighbours is his fourth book.\n\nAmbassador Joseph Ayalogu went into an extensive research with Jeff Unaegbu which resulted in the article \u201cThe Nigerian Youth in the Diaspora: A Partner in National Development: Challenges, Opportunities and Options\u201d. The thirty-eight-paged article was published in the book, The Youth and National Development in Nigeria edited by Jeff Unaegbu, Prof. EJ Otagburuagu and Dr. Nkiru Ohia in 2010. Talks of a book growing from the work were held.\n\nDr. Ani Casmir focused on \u201cTalent, Entrepreneurship: Challenges of Developing a Working Framework for Good Governance in Africa\u201d. It was published in African Entrepreneurship in the New Millennium.\n\nFrom Left: Amb. Ben Amobi and Amb. Charles Cocodia with former Ambassador to Switzerland, Amb. Joseph Ayalogu (Adjunct Senior Research Fellow of the IAS) at the induction course for new ambassadorial appointees in Abuja, April 2011.\n\nJT Omenma researched on \u201cEssentials of Entrepreneurship in a Developing Economy: A Case of Informal Trade in Africa\u201d. It was published in African Entrepreneurship in the New Millennium. He also submitted an article titled \u201cYouth and Sports in Nigeria\u201d for the book, The Youth and National Development in Nigeria. Along with Prof. Otagburuagu, Mr. JT Omenma researched the \u201cSocial Contract Thesis and the Dialectic of Good Governance in 21st Century Africa\u201d. It was published in Governance in Africa in the 21st Century edited by Prof. Otagburuagu. JT Omenma\u2019s \u201cInsider VS Outsider Relations: The Political Economy Analysis of Osu/Ohu System among Ndigbo of South-East Nigeria\u201d appeared in Readings in African Studies edited by Prof. Otagburuagu, Prof. AE Afigbo & JT Omenma.\n\nDr. Nkiru Christiana Ohia focused on women, gender and role dynamics in Africa, especially in Southeastern Nigeria. Her published research works are unyielding in this focus. Her work with ABC Ezeibe and EJ Otagburuagu was published as \u201cIgbo Women in Contemporary Entrepreneurship\u201d. It appeared in African Entrepreneurship in the New Millennium. Her work with Ikpe Ibenekwu titled \u201cThe Youth and Societal Systems\u201d was published in The Youth and National Development in Nigeria edited by Jeff Unaegbu, Prof. Otagburuagu and herself.\n\nOrajaka Susan Nwakaego researched on the role of oja (flute) as an instrument of governance amongst the Igbo. The completed work was published in Governance at the Grassroots (edited by E.J. Otagburuagu, I.E. Ibenekwu and E. Iwundu) in 2010.\n\nIkpe Ibenekwu worked with A.O. Onyishi to write an article on \u201cWork Ethic and Local Government Administration in a Democratic Setting\u201d. Ikpe Ibenekwu also co-authored an article with Okagu George O. It was titled, \u201cTraditional Rulers and grassroots Governance in Nigeria: Challenges and Expectations\u201d. The two papers were published in Governance at the Grassroots.\n\nOhia, Nkiru Christiana, PhD,\n\nResearch Fellow II.\n\nOkagu George, EJ Otagburuagu and Ikpe Ibenekwu completed the work, \u201cThe Role of Politics in Entrepreneurship in Nigeria\u201d. The work appeared in African Entrepreneurship in the New Millennium.\n\nDr. Emmanuel Iwundu and Dr. Magnus Aniagor explored the \u201cHindrances to Effective Communication and Governance in the Local Government System\u201d. They took as case study, Enugu and Imo States of Nigeria. They also researched on \u201cTaxation and Governance in Nigeria\u201d. The completed papers were published in Governance at the Grassroots.\n\nMrs. Joy Ezeigbo unraveled \u201cThe Effect of Religion on Governance at the Grassroots\u201d for Governance at the Grassroots.\n\nFrom 2008 when he was employed to 2010, Jeff Unaegbu authored eight books. They include Ode on Lagos (This Lagos Na wa). Nsukka: Pitmak Publishers (2010, 92 pages); Freedom in Our Bones: The History of the Students\u2019 Union Government, University of Nigeria, Nsukka (1960-2004), Onitsha: Blue Publishers (2008, 512 Pages); ALEXANDER O.E. ANIMALU: A Biography of the Distinguished Professor of Physics. Abuja: Ucheakonam Foundation (Nig.) Ltd (2008, 133 Pages) (coauthored with Akpojotor, G.E); Origins of the NYSC. Nsukka: Global Publishers. (2009, 90 Pages); The Secret Principles of Female Powers. Nsukka: Global Publishers (2009, 100 pages) (coauthored with Ibuot, E.); Nelson Mandela and Barrack Obama African World Challenge: Arts and Science in the Reconstruction of the Consciousness of Africans in the 21st Century, A Dialogue of Western and African Worldviews. Abuja: Ucheakonam Foundation (Nig.) Ltd (2009, 101 pages) (coauthored with Professor Animalu, AOE, Professor Umezinwa, W. and Professor Achufusi, G); The Youth and National Development in Nigeria. Enugu: Benak Ventures. (2010, 167 pages): an anthology of articles contributed by research fellows of the Institute and edited by Jeff Unaegbu (with the then Director of the Institute, Prof. E.J. Otagburuagu and Dr. N.C. Ohia as co-editors. Mr. Unaegbu contributed four chapters to the book) and This Mosquito in Your Net. Nsukka: Global Publishers. (2010, 77 pages). He also published two articles, each co-authored with Prof. Alex Animalu. They are \u201cICT as Language for Governance in Africa in the 21st Century\u201d (published in Governance in Africa in the 21st Century edited by Prof. Otagburuagu) and \u201cThe Resolution of Two Worldviews: Values for a New African Leadership\u201d (published in Perspectives on Leadership in Africa edited by Egodi Uchendu, Pat Uche Okpoko and Edlyne Anugwom (2010).\n\nIn January 2010, Mr. Unaegbu initiated an idea about a History of the University of Nigeria (from 1985 to 2010). He made efforts to graft the project into the activities of the Institute. It was inspired by the first history of the University from 1960 to 1985 edited by Prof. Emmanuel Obiechina, Prof. John Umeh and Prof. Chukwuemeka Ike. Involving the experiences of Professor Emeritus Alexander Animalu, Professor Emeka Otagburuagu (then Director of the Institute) and Professor Sam Onuigbo (who later became the Director of the Institute), the project was commenced. Professor Emeka Otagburuagu suggested that the scope of the project should be widened to cover the entire period of existence of the University from 1960 to 2010. After a while of waiting for funds from the University Administration, and assured of the backing of his seniors, Mr. Unaegbu committed his personal funds to the task of retrieving information from all the departments, faculties, schools, centers, unions and institutes in the University, personally handing letters to many departments in Enugu and Nsukka campuses in 2010. Unfortunately, only very few departments willingly submitted their information. Incidentally, in early 2011, the publications committee of a national committee on the 50th anniversary of the University wrote to the Institute of African Studies requesting staff of the institute working on the project to merge with it so as to prevent duplication of efforts for a history of the University of Nigeria. This was because the committee discovered that the Institute was already working on the vision through letters sent to departments when it began its own work later on. Consequently, Mr. Unaegbu wrote a long letter detailing the origins of the vision and submitted every document to the committee through his Director in the Institute of African Studies. He also handed over the draft (about 400 pages already) in hard and soft copies. Then, he immediately began to develop another book from a previously submitted article for the University history titled \u201cThe History of the Institute of African Studies, University of Nigeria, Nsukka\u201d. This former article has become the history book in your hands\u2026.\n\nOpening prayer before an Institute in-house meeting. IAS Secretary, Adaozo Orjiekwe (extreme left beside Tivde Tertsegha, System Analyst II) and IAS Director, Prof. Otagburuagu (extreme right)\n\nAward:\n\nIn what was regarded as the first of its kind in the history of the University of Nigeria, the Nebo Administration doled out awards to deserving staff of the University. He gave out these awards at the Princess Alexandria Auditorium during the 48th Founders\u2019 Day. Amongst those so honoured was the Director of the Institute, Prof. E.J. Otagburuagu. Speaking at the occasion, the former Vice Chancellor expressed delight at the performance of the awardees, who worked tirelessly to see that the University of Nigeria became the Harvard University of Africa. He implored other staff to re-dedicate themselves to the task of uplifting the University.\n\nThe Onuigbo Administration (2010-2012, 2012- )\n\nIn August 2010, a new Director was appointed. He was Prof. Sam Onuigbo, a former Head of the department of English. Beginning with a religious stance of prayers for success of the activities of the Institute, the new Director began moves to consolidate the gains of the former administration. Though a new administration, it was able to execute a number of lectures and conferences within a short period.\n\nThe Administration organized a public lecture on December 17, 2010 at the Seminar Room of the Institute in which Prof. Catherine Acholonu, Country Ambassador UNCCD Forum of Arts and Culture and Director, Catherine Acholonu Research Center, presented one of her books and gave a lecture on it. The book was titled, The Lost Testament of the Ancestors of Adam.\n\nA cross-section of participants during the Catherine Acholonu Lecture in December, 2010\n\nThe lecture attracted some eminent scholars including Prof. Damian Opata, former dean of the Faculty of Arts and Prof. Edwin Okafor, dean of the Faculty of Arts. The lecturer dwelt on the beginnings of world civilizations as being traceable to an Igbo origin, including a profound proposition that the Igbos lived before the homo sapiens, Adam. Of course, an explosive question-and-answer session came after the lecture. The video clip of the lecture was captured by the Cinema Unit and uploaded into Mr. Unaegbu\u2019s Channel in Youtube, an internet-based visual library. The video was titled, The Lost Testament of the Ancestors of Adam. It is still attracting hundreds of viewers and scathing comments.\n\nThere was an end-of-year party, probably for the first time in the Institute, championed by the Welfare Committee which was created naturally by the influx of employees into the Institute. Its first chairman was Mr. J.T. Omenma, later, Dr. Ohia succeeded him.\n\nAnother public lecture on the relevance of retaining the dying Igbo language was organized by the Institute. It was delivered by Prof. Pita Ejiofor, former Vice Chancellor of the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, in early 2011. It attracted minimal audience because of low publicity.\n\nThe Institute also organized a very successful 7-day African Education and ICT Conference with the theme, Oche Ndi Igbo Bunyere Asusu Igbo. It was in collaboration with the IT & C Networks Ltd (Distributors of MSI Laptops), Traditional Council of the Federation of Social Science Students Association of the University of Nigeria (FOSSA) and Golden Heart Foundation, Lagos. It was held from the 17th of May 2011 to the 24th of May 2011 using the Princess Alexandria Auditorium and seven Faculty Halls at the Nsukka Campus of the University. There were sub themes dwelling on life after school, developing a good business plan, web applications, hardware/circuit board fabrication technologies, solar energy technology, computer networking and administration, application software design and development III, website design, maintenance and development and work while in school concept. This conference attracted a special guest of honour, Chief Dr. Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, who donated some fund to the Institute. Other dignitaries who graced the conference included Chief Sam Ogbonna Onyeisi (Chairman, Board of Hotel Presidential Enugu). Mr. Sam Onyishi (CEO, Peace Mass Transit), Hon. Dr. Pat Asadu (Member, House of Representative, Nsukka Igbo Eze Federal Constituency), Hon. Barr. Tony Ugwu (Chairman, Nsukka Local Government Area), Prof. Pita Ejiofor (former Vice Chancellor, Nnamdi Azikiwe University), Mr. Etele Obinna (Chief Executive Officer, With-Worth Group), Dr. Chidi Okpaluba (CEO CEFARRD in proxy through a female representative) and Pastor Edafiogho Dennis O.C. (ICT Resource person for the University of Nigeria). The success of this conference was largely due to the excellent contact network of a student, who doubled as the Igwe of FOSSA, HRH Nsoffor Chinedu (founder of the Work While in School Foundation).

E. Afigbo, Obi Ikenga: The Case for a Pan-Igbo Centre for Igbo Studies(Uturu, Nigeria: Abia State University, 2000).\n\nThe Ahiajoku Lecture Series, which was inaugurated on November 30, 1979, was designed to offer the Igbo a rare opportunity to annually gather and harness the intellectual richness of the people through public lectures by the most erudite of Igbo scholars. It is an annual intellectual harvest in which a distinguished Igbo scholar is selected to educate and share an important aspect of Igbo life and culture related to the lecturer\u2019s expertise. Thus, Ahiajoku lecturers have focused on Igbo political, economic, cultural, social, technological, philosophical and historical experiences, as well as the people\u2019s interactions and encounters with non-Igbo ethnic groups in Nigeria, and with the Europeans. It is an occasion to celebrate the collective Igbo achievements.\n\nFor more information on this Directorate, see Arthur A.

It is expected of an effective teacher or professor to strive to accommodate his or her students\u2019 individual differences and needs. But Afigbo was not for the mediocre or even average students. You must be above average and hardworking in order to survive Afigbo\u2019s scrutiny. The author started her doctoral thesis with Professor Afigbo, but did not complete the work with him due to no fault of theirs. Afigbo and the author worked very hard to complete the thesis, but it was not possible due to his retirement from the university in 1992.\n\nSee, for instance, E. Isichei, A History of the Igbo People(London: Macmillan, 1976), xiv.

This prejudicial characterization of the region and the period suggests a lawless and unstable atmosphere incapable of fostering any meaningful commercial and intergroup exchanges.

Themes emphasised include pre-colonial and colonial history, inter-group relations, the Aro and the slave trade, the art and science of history in Africa, and nation-building.\n\nNigerian historian (1937-2009)\n\nQuick facts: Adiele Eberechukwu Afigbo, Born, Died, Academ... \u25bc\n\nAfigbo took up his career as a historian in the 1950s with the celebrated Ibadan School of History, which for about three decades was the most prominent school of history in Africa. He became a prominent member of that school, which devoted its time to demonstrating the need for African history and historiography as specific genres of the world history.
