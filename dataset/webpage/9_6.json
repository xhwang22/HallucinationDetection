Her difficult path to marriage involves a disastrous first marriage.\n\nWho, however, enthralled her once more and swept her off her feet?\n\nGiven that the stunning Iranian-American actress has captured the hearts of millions, Shohreh\u2019s relationship with her second husband has piqued the interest of her fans.\n\nHusband of Shohreh Aghdashloo\n\nWith little hope of finding solace, the Iranian actress resorted to a friend from her homeland; instead, she discovered everything. She met her husband, Houshang Touzie, an Iranian actor, in the mid-1980s.\n\nAfter dating for a while, the pair fell in love and decided to marry. Touzie and Shohreh were married by Iranian customs in 1987.\n\nThey had a lovely wedding ceremony and celebrated their love in front of their loved ones.\n\nThey can be considered a powerful couple because their bond extends beyond love. The power couple has contributed significantly to the Iranian entertainment industry.\n\nThe Tehran Theatrical and Acting Workshop was closed down during the 1979 revolution. They couldn\u2019t, however, just sit back and do nothing.\n\nAs a result, Touzie and Shohreh established Workshop \u201979, a drama production business based in Los Angeles. Their love is still strong, as Touzie uploaded a photo in 2021 with the comment,\n\nI adore you not only for who you are, but also for who I become when I am with you. The cute couple is still a family and each other\u2019s home.\n\nShohreh\u2019s Mother-Daughter Relationship\n\nAfter two years of marriage, the couple decided they were ready to start a family and have children. As a result, Tara Touzie, their cherished daughter, was born in September 1989.\n\nAccording to Shohreh\u2019s tweets, she enjoys a close relationship with her daughter. In 2018, she posted a special post to express her love and gratitude to her daughter.\n\nAs evidenced by the tweet, she has a great deal of admiration and affection for Tara. Tara, unlike her parents, chose to be a writer. Shohreh and her spouse respect and admire her professional decision.\n\nThe actress even dedicated a special appreciation post to Tara, expressing how pleased she is to be her mother. Although Shohreh lives happily with her husband and daughter today, some people are interested in her past.\n\nThe First Marriage\n\nShohreh was married to Aydin Aghdashloo for seven years before meeting her current boyfriend. After nearly a decade with Aydin, she decided to divorce and move on.\n\nHowever, the 1979 Iranian revolution gave her the strength to terminate her marriage, which was already on the verge of dissolution.\n\nDuring the period, Ayatollah Khomeini\u2019s religious rule imposed restrictions on women\u2019s participation in art. With the revolution, the unexplained suffocation of women altered.\n\nShe began making history in the entertainment business after leaving her ex-husband and her past behind.\n\nEven now, she opens out about her challenges as an outsider in Hollywood. Her fandom, on the other hand, always made her feel at home, respecting her talent.\n\nAlso Read: A Look At The Success And Relationships Of Joan- Baez"}, {"url": "https://healthyceleb.com/shohreh-aghdashloo/", "page_content": "Shohreh Aghdashloo Quick Info Height 5 ft 5 in Weight 57 kg Date of Birth May 11, 1952 Zodiac Sign Taurus Spouse Houshang Touzie\n\nShohreh Aghdashloo is an Iranian-American actress, author, and activist who is well-known for her appearance in the films Goz\u0101resh (The Report) (1977), Sooteh Delan (Broken-Hearted), House of Sand and Fog (2003), and as Dina Araz in 24, Chrisjen Avasarala in The Expanse (2015\u20132022), and Sajida Talfah in House of Saddam (2008).\n\nBorn Name\n\nShohreh Vaziri-Tabar (In Persian \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0647 \u0648\u0632\u06cc\u0631\u06cc\u200c\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0631)\n\nNick Name\n\nShohreh\n\nSun Sign\n\nTaurus\n\nBorn Place\n\nTehran, Iran\n\nResidence\n\nLos Angeles, California, United States\n\nNationality\n\nEducation\n\nShohreh graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in international relations at Brunel University in the past.\n\nOccupation\n\nActress, Author, Activist\n\nFamily\n\nFather \u2013 Anushiravan Vaziri-Tabar\n\n\u2013 Anushiravan Vaziri-Tabar Mother \u2013 Effie (n\u00e9e al-Sadat)\n\n\u2013 Effie (n\u00e9e al-Sadat) Siblings \u2013 Shahram Vaziri-Tabar (Brother), Shahriar Vaziri-Tabar (Brother), Shahrokh Vaziri-Tabar (Brother)\n\nManager\n\nShohreh is represented by Creative Artists Agency and Tamara Houston at Roundtable Entertainment in the United States and by Roger Charteris at The Artists Partnership in the United Kingdom.\n\nBuild\n\nSlim\n\nHeight\n\n5 ft 5 in or 165 cm\n\nWeight\n\n57 kg or 125.5 lbs\n\nBoyfriend / Spouse\n\nShohreh has dated \u2013\n\nAydin Aghdashloo \u200b(1972-1979)\u200b \u2013 Shohreh tied the knot with Iranian painter, graphist, art curator, writer, and film critic Aydin Aghdashloo in 1972.

Be organic, authentic and be visionary.\n\nQ: I love that\u2026let the world see through you\u2026 I know you have a few projects you are working on, could you share a little about them?\n\nShohreh Aghdashloo: My movie SIMPLE WEDDING is my first romantic comedy.

Born in Tehran in 1952 to an intellectual, creative family, Aghdashloo was drawn to the theater at an early age, and by her twenties was performing in various cutting-edge performance groups, among them the acclaimed Drama Workshop of Tehran. Filmmakers often drew upon talent from the Workshop, and Aghdashloo was cast by directors Abbas Kiarostami and Ali Hatami -- two towering figures of the nascent Iranian New Wave -- to play starring roles in several of their formally adventurous, socially progressive productions, including 1977's Gozaresh and Sutedelan.\n\nBut in the late '70s, with the Ayatollah Khomeini reintroducing an era of strict rule based on religious doctrine, Aghdashloo's work as a performer was either censored or forbidden outright. Eager to escape the turmoil of the Iranian Revolution, Aghdashloo left her husband and her career to go to London, where she earned a degree in international relations. She was on the verge of accepting a position at a newspaper when a friend presented her with a play, called Rainbow, about the Revolution and its discontents. He had written a role specifically for her, and Aghdashloo believed in the project enough to put her journalism career on hold -- for what would turn out to be an indefinite length of time. Rainbow was such a success, it toured the United States, where Aghdashloo was reunited with a Workshop colleague of hers, Houshang Touzie; a romance soon developed, and two married in Los Angeles in the late '80s.\n\nDiscouraged by the dearth of non-stereotyped roles for Middle Eastern women in Hollywood, Aghdashloo focused her attention instead on stage work, even creating a traveling theater troupe with her husband that performed plays in Farsi for Iranian audiences. Her occasional film work included roles in such topical dramas as America So Beautiful and Maryam, both about the struggle of Iranian immigrants in the U.S. It was such work that caught the attention of director Vadim Perelman, who was looking to cast the supporting role of Nadi in his big-screen adaptation of the bestseller House of Sand and Fog. Perelman and his casting agent contacted Aghdashloo directly -- at the time, the actress had no agent or manager -- and were soon convinced that she was the woman for the part. Having read the book upon its release, Aghdashloo had long envisioned ways that she could play Nadi, a strong but subservient Iranian-American wife and mother caught between her husband's wishes and her own conscience. Opposite the formidable Ben Kingsley in a cast of established performers, Aghdashloo's subtle, simmering performance brought her kudos from the New York Film Critics and Los Angeles Film Critics Associations, both of whom named her 2003's Best Supporting Actress. The Academy followed suit, nominating her against such Hollywood stalwarts as Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and Holly Hunter.\n\nFollowing a recurring role on the wildly popular television hit 24 that served well to introduce the increasingly prominant actress to audiences outside of the art-house circuit, Aghdashloo turned in impressive supporting performances in such popular wide release films as The Exorcism of Emily Rose, American Dreamz, and X-Men: The Last Stand. In 2006 Aghdashloo would heed the call of Hollywood once again to take a featured role as the best friend of Sandra Bullock's lonely character in the romantic fantasy remake The Lake House. She went on appear in The Stoning of Soraya M., The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, and House of Saddam, and narrated the documentaries Iranium and For Neda."}]}
