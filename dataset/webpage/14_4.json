This indie folk singer-songwriter learned to play the piano as a youngster but also showed an early interest in compiling \u0091found sounds\u0092. Landes attended New York University in the late 90s and quickly became affiliated with the city\u0092s long-established \u0091fast folk\u0092 scene, where her creative urge found her experimenting with a range of instruments on stage. She also began working part-time as a sound engineer on albums by artists such as Ryan Adams, Joseph Arthur, and Hem, also taking to the road to tour with the latter band. It was during this period that Landes recorded the material that would comprise her 2002 debut. Dawn Landes offered a telling glimpse of the artist\u0092s eclectic musical talent with its blend of acoustic and electric styles and the employment of a diverse range of instruments, including accordion, guitar, glockenspiel and piano.\n\nIncreasingly dividing her time between New York and Paris, France, Landes then completed the UK-released mini-album Two Three Four before her burgeoning reputation helped secure a contract with the Fargo label. Recorded with help from members of Hem, and released at the start of 2007, the artful blend of folk ballads, country rock and electronic loops helped make Fire Proof one of the year\u0092s most delightful independent releases.\n\nSource: The Encyclopedia of Popular Music by Colin Larkin.

She kept mum about her own aspirations to do the same someday.\n\n\u201cI would never tell anyone I wrote songs,\u201d says Landes, a southerner who now lives in Brooklyn. \u201cI felt if they knew I was a songwriter, they would think the only reason I was there was to take advantage of the situation. That wasn\u2019t the case, at all. I really wanted to learn about recording.\u201d\n\nLandes\u2019 combined love of recording and writing took hold at an early age. Fortified by a smattering of piano lessons, she began making tapes of original material while still in grammar school. By the time she reached middle school, she and her family had relocated to Branson, Missouri, where Landes found herself babysitting for Tony Orlando\u2019s kids and, at age 13, performing as a dancer in the Andy Williams Christmas Show.\n\nShe describes the whole Branson experience as \u201cinsane,\u201d and indeed, her homespun, understated music is the very antithesis of that town\u2019s hokey celebrity glitz. Still, she feels Branson\u2019s ties to country music legends had a subtle impact.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been reading Loretta Lynn\u2019s autobiography, and I just realized she was living there while I was there,\u201d Landes says. \u201cI never actually went to her show, but I did go to a lot of the other shows. I was young and into my own thing, but in a subliminal way I\u2019m sure people like her influenced me. I\u2019m certainly interested in her now.\u201d\n\nFar more integral to Landes\u2019 development as an artist was the crowd she fell in with after moving to New York. While attending New York University, she discovered the storied Greenwich Village \u201cFast Folk\u201d songwriting community, and began attending its weekly sessions. Semi-regular participant Suzanne Vega helped Landes secure the internship at Glass\u2019 studio and subsequently invited her to open some shows. Landes dropped out of school, threw herself into her engineering work, and continued to write songs on the side.\n\n\u201cI never stopped writing,\u201d she says. \u201cI made an album in 2001, recording it late at night in one of the studios I was working at. That album was released on a tiny French label. Then I did an EP that was released in the U.K., but not here. This new album is the first one I\u2019ve done that\u2019s being released on both sides of the pond.\u201d\n\nFireproof, released March 4 on Cooking Vinyl, has more in common with artists such as Cat Power and Laura Veirs than with Loretta Lynn. Spectral, languid, and arranged with a light touch, the songs are filled with after-midnight ruminations couched in a dreamy ambiance and centered on Landes\u2019 beguiling, ethereal voice. Tracks such as \u201cTired Of This Life\u201d and \u201cTwilight\u201d are essentially beautiful, laconic folk lullabies.\n\n\u201cPrivate Little Hell\u201d and \u201cPicture Show\u201d, on the other hand, reveal Landes\u2019 fascination with tape loops and exotic sounds, even as she maintains the overarching candlelit vibe. \u201c\u2018Picture Show\u2019 came together really quickly,\u201d she says. \u201cI was working at a music store at the time, and one afternoon I sampled an optigan. I had a show that night, and on the way I listened to the sample on headphones. I wrote the lyrics right there, in about five minutes.\u201d\n\nOther high points include the homesick blues ballad \u201cDig Me A Hole\u201d (written while in the throes of longing for her southern roots), and the opening track, \u201cBodyguard\u201d, a haunting, bad-dream soundscape spiked with plucked banjo and slap echo.\n\nLandes describes her writing process as mysterious. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what style it is,\u201d she says. \u201cI love country music and I love folk songs, but I also love crazy sounds and funny production.\u201d As would be expected given her studio background, her grasp of the recording process is firm.\n\n\u201cI did all the basic tracking acoustically, in one day,\u201d she says, when asked how the new album was recorded. \u201cThe guy who owns the studio \u2014 which is actually an old fire station \u2014 left town, and while he was gone I basically camped out there for a week. I had my friends come over and play things, and did overdubs and rough mixes, and tinkered with all kinds of things. There was a fire pole there and everything. It was a great environment.\u201d\n\nIn addition to her solo albums, Landes has served as a touring member of Brooklyn folk-pop band Hem, has worked on film scores, and made a video of her bluegrassy take on Peter Bjorn & John\u2019s \u201cYoung Folks\u201d (backed, ironically, by Austin senior-citizens outfit the WST Bluegrass Band) that drew high viewership on YouTube. Even as she broadens her artistic palette, however, she has no plans to stop being a sound engineer.\n\n\u201cRecently I built a recording studio, with some friends of mine,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been touring so much during the past year, I haven\u2019t had much time to spend in it. But I enjoy touring, I enjoy working on other people\u2019s records, and I enjoy scoring films. However things work out, I\u2019m happy.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.pianistmagazine.com/blogs/what-is-the-best-age-to-start-learning-the-piano/", "page_content": "In 2013, the Beijing Normal University released the results of a study which concluded that individuals who started learning the piano before the age of seven benefited from advanced cognitive skills later in life. The benefits remained even for those who stopped practising in their teenage years.\n\n\n\nOn the contrary, Linda Lorenzo - Director for Learning and Engagement with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra - is a believer that there is no real ideal age. Instead, she advises that the physical nature and interests of the child should be considered. A child who is physically strong might suit a brass instrument. A child with large hands might suit the piano. A child who enjoys the sound of the double bass should begin on the cello before progressing to the double bass when their physique can cope with such a large instrument.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the Peterson Family Foundation provides a comprehensive list for which instruments suit specific age ranges. The piano is deemed an instrument suitable for the earliest of children; age three-four is considered a good time to begin these lessons.\n\nWith such diverse and contradicting answers from studies, teachers and education experts, what really is the best age for learning the piano? Does age even matter?\n\n\n\nThere are two important topics need to be considered...\n\nGoals\n\nWhat do you want to be able to play on the piano? If your goal is being able to play Chopin\u2019s Raindrop Prelude, any age will work provided you practice regularly. Can you play this piece starting at age ten? Yes. Age fifty? Yes. If your goal is to become a concert pianist, the answer is the earlier the better. Put simply, starting at age five will give you an extra year\u2019s practice than starting at age six, and with committed practice, this will lead to an extra year\u2019s progress.\n\nLang Lang began learning the piano at age three. Sir Andr\u00e1s Schiff began at age five. Both are undoubtedly highly successful musicians. Can you become a concert pianist starting at age forty? It\u2019s possible, but you need to demonstrate exceptional levels of dedication.\n\nContent continues after advertisements\n\nRead writer Daniel Johnson\u2019s argument on why it\u2019s never too late to learn.\n\nIt's never too late to learn...everyone's a winner! Classical pianist & columnist Daniel Johnson suggests ways of learning piano later in life.\n\nCommitment\n\nAs with any skill, progress is the result of consistent practice, dedication and hard work. Attending a piano lesson once a week with no practice will result in minimal progress. If you are ready to commit, you will be able to learn the piano. Starting the piano at age two with regular practice will be much more efficient than beginning as a fully grown and mature twenty-year-old with no practice.\n\n\n\nWhat is the best age to start learning the piano? It\u2019s the same as asking yourself how long a piece of string is. It depends on what you need the string for.\n\nWhat you should be asking yourself is this: Am I (or my child) committed enough to achieve my goals on the piano?\n\nBy Alec Coles-Aldridge. Alec is a graduate of the Royal College of Music and studied for a Bachelor of Music Degree."}, {"url": "https://www.tonara.com/blog/11-benefits-of-learning-the-piano-at-a-young-age/", "page_content": "The benefits of learning piano at a young age have been heavily researched for decades. Many of the studies are the result of the apparent natural need for music in the human mind. The U.S. National Institutes of Health state:\n\n\u201cOne of the differences between the developed brains of Homo sapiens and those of the great apes is the increase in area allocated to processing auditory information. \u2026 The ear is always open and, unlike vision and the eyes or the gaze, sound cannot readily be averted. From the rhythmic beating within and with the mother\u2019s body for the fetus and young infant, to the primitive drum-like beating of sticks on wood and hand clapping of our adolescent and adult proto-speaking ancestors, the growing infant is surrounded by and responds to rhythm.\u201d\n\nAcademic studies have also shown that humans can, indeed, increase their IQ \u2013 an accomplishment that has previously been thought impossible.\n\n\u201c\u2026this study demonstrates that 6-year-old children receiving instrumental musical training for 15 months (compared with children receiving non-musical training) not only learned to play their musical instrument but also showed changed anatomical features in brain areas known to be involved in the control of playing a musical instrument.\u201d\n\nThe key to increasing IQ is to learn to play an instrument. Not only do piano lessons promote brain development for children, but they also develop fine motor skills that are so often lacking in childhood development.\n\nBenefits of Learning Piano at a Young Age\n\nChildren usually have more \u201cplastic\u201d minds than adults. This means that their brains are easily adapted to new skills and information. This is one of the reasons parents value second-language lessons in primary school.\n\nMusic is a language all on its own, with symbols and notations unique to its own purposes. When children are exposed to piano lessons at an early age, they form neural pathways that link the right hemisphere of the brain \u2013 the analytical thought \u2013 to the left hemisphere of the brain, which is where abstract thought and creativity originate. For this reason, parents will often continue lessons for their child even if the child doesn\u2019t seem interested in the instrument. It\u2019s a form of education in which the child participates, rather than a form of expression.\n\nOther Benefits of Piano Lessons\n\nThere are many other benefits of learning piano at a young age for children.\n\nAcademic Success: Children who play the piano are usually more successful in other subjects such as language arts and math. The experience with left-to-right reading, symbol recognition, and problem-solving translates to other skills in reading.\n\nAuditory Skills: Children learn to discern musical elements through ear training, linking what they see on the page and feel with their hands with what they are hearing. This is an invaluable advantage in language skills.\n\nMath Skills: In study after study, students who have piano lessons and other music training do better in counting and in math. Part of this is due to the meter and progressive fractions of written music. But more importantly, students learn to read with a steady beat and a sense of the duration of sound in time \u2013 both abstract notions. This develops the brain, giving the child a larger capacity for understanding mathematical concepts.\n\nLanguage Skills: The Mozart Effect has opened many avenues of music education for children in relation to other disciplines. In studying music, children become more aware of pitch differences, which, it turns out, is crucial in learning to speak and sound out words when reading.\n\nKids Playing Piano\n\nWhen you have kids playing the piano, you have kids who are lengthening their attention span, reading a \u201cforeign\u201d language, and coordinating their fine motor skills with reading. Teachers have found that kids playing the piano develop:\n\nPatience: Children learn, when playing the piano from an early age, to be patient with their own learning process, as well as with receiving instruction. They also learn to accept mistakes and learn from them.\n\nDiscipline: Kids who take piano lessons show an understanding of self-discipline and tend to be more organized. They have learned that hard work has rewards .\n\nHumility: Students who play the piano have to learn to take constructive criticism. This is a subtle form of humility in which kids find that there is always a better way to perform a task and improve performance. This makes for a more pro-active student in all subjects.\n\nConfidence: Kids learning piano at a young age demonstrate more confidence in their abilities. This is partly because they have had experience in receiving correction followed by immediate reinforcement of correct performance. Students learn that they can learn even if they make mistakes. They find satisfaction in overcoming difficult obstacles, and they learn leadership skills when performing in recitals.\n\nPiano Lessons for Toddlers\n\nThere has been a great deal of discussion in the music teacher communities regarding whether piano lessons for toddlers are a good idea. Some view this as a travesty, while others see babies playing piano as entirely possible.\n\nThe truth is, there is a middle ground. A toddler certainly cannot be expected to practice 8 hours a day but can learn to recognize certain notes on the staff and on the keyboard. They can be taught a few minutes at a time to use certain fingers and hand positions \u2013 not for future fame and glory as a child prodigy but to coordinate hearing, movement, and sight.\n\nArtistry for Young Piano Players\n\nWe have had students in our studios who refuse to play songs in a minor key. Others obviously prefer minor music. Rage Over a Lost Penny is a favorite with some of our students who want to express anxiety or anger.\n\nSome students are energized by the energetic minor key pieces composed by Daniel MacFarlane, while others drift a1way in some dreamy tone poems by Lynda Lybeck Robinson.\n\nRegardless of personal taste, young piano students can learn to express their own artistry and to appreciate the talents of others through performance.\n\nThere is so much more to taking piano lessons than merely \u201cchecking off a box\u201d. The truth is, about 80% of adults who quit piano lessons wish they had continued. Will you allow your child to make a mistake they will always regret?"}, {"url": "https://takelessons.com/blog/am-i-too-old-to-learn-piano-z06", "page_content": "People of many different ages find themselves asking the question: am I too old to learn piano?

Many students from a variety of fields enjoy exploring their creative side in addition to their professions. Diving into the piano is also a nice release from your busy work day.\n\nIf a student had attempted to play piano when they were much younger, but didn\u2019t have the focus or patience, oftentimes this focus is much more narrowed as an adult, and the concepts are easier to comprehend when you\u2019re between 20-30.\u201d\n\nWhat is Your Advice to Students in This Age Group?\n\n\u201cMy advice for adults learning to play piano is to take a fun song you know, and start from the basics. Learn the melody with the left hand, then the right hand, and put them together. Practice a little bit each day, even if it\u2019s for 15 minutes in the morning when you wake up, and 15 minutes before you go to bed at night.\u201d\n\nIs 30-40 Too Old to Learn Piano?\n\nRebecca K . \u2013 Piano Teacher in Vallejo, CA\n\n\u201cThe 30-40 age is such a unique and frankly, exhausting time to live. I know- I\u2019m there myself! Many of us have young kids, a job, and enough worries to fill a bank account (even when it feels like nothing else can).

There are ways, however, for the disciplined student to overcome this.\u201d\n\nWhat is Your Advice to Students in This Age Group?\n\n\u201cI recommend practicing in 10-25 minute sets, two to four times a day. Three times a day or more is really ideal, as in \u2013 wake up a little bit earlier to practice, do another session as soon as you get home, and another one right before bed.

In fact, activities like learning piano can stimulate the brain, increasing the ability to recall information. There are physical benefits to learning piano as well.\n\nBy practicing fine motor skills in your fingers, piano students are keeping the muscles in their hands flexible. Having flexibility in your hands can combat arthritis and improve circulation in your fingers.\u201d\n\nWhat is Your Advice to Students in This Age Group?\n\n\u201cThere are three things to keep in mind. The first is that music is like a language, and it requires time and patience to achieve steady growth. Secondly, physical problems such as arthritis or joint stiffness are only minor obstacles that can easily be overcome.\n\nLastly, learning an instrument should be seen as a simple pleasure in life and not a chore. Approach it as a time to explore your musical side!\u201d\n\nIs 70+ Too Old to Learn Piano?\n\nMarie France M. \u2013 Piano Teacher in Waldwick, NJ\n\n\u201cThere are certain advantages the 70+ student brings to the table. They are self-motivated which means no one has to push them to practice and they know what they want to learn, which gives the teacher a clear focus.\u201d\n\nWhat is Your Advice to Students in This Age Group?\n\n\u201cElder students do have a higher percentage of physical challenges than their younger counterparts, particularly with eyesight and arthritis. I recommend having good direct lighting, and a magnifying glass in reach.

Leave a comment below and share your tips!"}, {"url": "https://hub.yamaha.com/pianos/p-acoustic/the-benefits-of-playing-piano-at-any-age/", "page_content": "Whether you\u2019re looking to have your child start a new learning-enriching activity or you\u2019re a retiree who is up for a new challenge, here are some amazing benefits that come from playing piano.\n\nIt Can Make Your Child a Better Student\n\nParents take note: When your child learns a musical instrument, they become a better student all around. There are numerous studies that have verified this astonishing fact. For example, a Psychology Today article citing research done at the University of British Columbia in 2019 states that \u201cStudents who learned to play a musical instrument in elementary [school] and continued playing in high school not only score significantly higher but were about one academic year ahead of their non-music peers with regard to their English, mathematics and science skills \u2026 These exam-based statistics were consistent across the board, regardless of socioeconomic background, gender, ethnicity, or prior learning in science, math, and English.\u201d\n\nThis extends to language skills too. \u201cIt appears that some of the auditory skills learned from piano playing enhance specific aspects of the perception of spoken language, even beyond that gained from additional experience in reading,\u201d writes renowned cognitive neuroscientist Dr. John Gabrieli in an article here on the Yamaha blog. \u201cThe benefits from music (which has no direct relation to language) [are] similar to those from reading (which relates directly to language).\u201d\n\nYou Can Start Learning It At Any Age\n\nUnlike some other musical instruments, piano is something you can learn \u2014 and learn well \u2014 at any age. In his Yamaha blog article \u201cExpress Yourself,\u201d musician, bestselling author and cognitive psychologist Daniel Levitin says that, \u201cFor older adults, the instrument I recommend is the piano (or any similar keyboard, such as organ or synthesizer). The reason is that getting a good tone out of a keyboard is not at all difficult: anyone can sit down at a piano and play a C-sharp as well as a Rubinstein, an Alicia de Larrocha or an Elton John. Putting the notes together is the challenge, but it\u2019s a challenge you can start addressing right away. The other advantage of the piano is that it\u2019s easy to visualize scales and chords \u2014 they\u2019re all there in front of you, laid out linearly.\u201d\n\nIn fact, according to the Tonara article \u201cLearning Piano as an Adult: What Are the Benefits,\u201d learning piano as an adult has some distinct advantages. \u201cKids are usually relieved of all the stress that comes with adulthood,\u201d the article explains, \u201cand they might not notice this particular benefit, even when they grow older. But learning piano as an adult can be beneficial for this particular issue. Even simple piano lessons for beginner adults can help you deal with stress.\u201d\n\nIt Can Make You Healthier\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve found playing piano to be the ultimate stress reliever. And when I say \u201cplay,\u201d I mean simply playing, with no particular end goal in mind \u2014 in other words, just enjoying the process of \u201cnoodling around.\u201d I find that by allowing my fingers to glide over the keys without the pressure of having to create something or improve my technique, I can let the instrument take me somewhere for the musical joy of it.\n\n\u201cAs humans, we are hard-wired for music,\u201d says Barry Bittman, MD, Chairman and CEO of the Yamaha Music and Wellness Institute, a non-profit organization engaged in education and research, \u201cMusic gets through where words do not pass. Recreational music-making reduces the impact of stress on many levels and allows healing to begin. It actually alters gene expression pathways in patients with coronary heart disease.\u201d\n\nThe Tonara article cited above confirms Dr. Bittman\u2019s observation, stating that \u201cgetting into an instrument as an adult can stimulate your brain in so many ways. Your neuroplasticity can see some significant improvements, meaning that your brain starts making new connections and remapping the old patterns.\u201d\n\nWhenever I sit down at the piano, it feels as if my brain does indeed light up with excitement. I simply feel better after playing, even if I only idle over the keys for a short period of time. That may be because I only started to learn to play piano a few years ago (I\u2019m a lifelong guitarist); my training on the instrument is minimal enough that I don\u2019t know exactly what I\u2019m doing. As Zen Master Shunaryu Suzuik once said, \u201cIn the beginner\u2019s mind there are many possibilities. In the expert\u2019s mind there are few.\u201d\n\nSo whether you want to learn a single song for your own pleasure or go deep into performance technique, playing the piano has healing benefits for your (or your child\u2019s) mind, body, spirit and soul.

Many of them imagine that learning and mastering the instrument is complex, much more so than that of other musical instruments.\n\nThe stringed instrument, with its 88 keys, is scary because it seems difficult to access. However, it is at the age when children begin to learn to read and write that they will be best able to integrate piano gestures and musical understanding.\n\nMost scientific studies agree that 6 years would be the ideal age to start playing the piano. At this age, pleasure is an essential part of the learning process. Hence the musical awakening classes that work well from this age, or even before. These courses are an effective way to develop musical sensitivity and understanding. Young children must be given time to reach a certain stage of psychomotor maturity so that learning the instrument can be effective. That\u2019s why piano apps, such as La Touche Musicale, Onlinepianist, Flowkey or Simply Piano, are aimed more at young children over the age of 6.\n\nCan we start learning piano before the age of 6?\n\nAs you can see everywhere on the Internet, fabulous stories where young prodigies already master the piano very well from the age of 3 or 4 are legion. It happens, but it\u2019s rare! And beware of demotivation. Indeed, by giving your child music lessons too young, you increase the chances of disgusting him/her with music pedagogy by imposing a very harsh discipline on him/her from an early age.\n\nIt must be understood that learning to play the piano is long, rigorous and requires a lot of investment. However, at this age, it is very difficult to concentrate your child in a long and regular way on the same discipline. Moreover, music education, which is perceived as an obligation and lacking a playful character, will have a great chance, one day or another, of disgusting the learner and he or she will eventually turn away from it.\n\nCan we start the piano very late?\n\nOf course, of course! Contrary to popular belief, adults maintain their learning functions over time. The brain\u2019s memory capacity is never saturated throughout our lives. All that matters is motivation. If an adult feels motivated by the idea of learning the piano, he or she will move much faster than a child who will not be motivated or who will be less motivated. In fact, many piano books for beginners focus exclusively on adult learning.\n\nOn the other hand, what is more difficult in adulthood is the return to school. At this age, it is indeed much more complicated to recover from the conditions of traditional classes, such as those we used to take in school when we were children. Hence the creation of new learning systems, playful and effective, such as the one proposed on La Touche Musicale.\n\nThe playful dimension of an education system makes it possible to accelerate the learning process. The learner will not feel his learning effort because he will feel like he is having fun, spending his time doing something that relaxes him. As a result, his brain\u2019s ability to memorize will be increased tenfold.\n\nIn short: whether you are 40 or 90 years old, if you are motivated to learn the piano, do it! You will progress quickly, especially if you enjoy it. Life is simple ?\n\nThe ideal age to learn piano and other musical instruments\n\nIf the learning of the piano depends on its motivation to do so, there is when for a number of scientific studies an ideal age to start. Here are the main points, classified by instrument and age:\n\nThe ideal age to start music lessons according to the instrument learned Piano 6 years The ideal age to start piano classes Guitar 7-9 years The ideal age to start guitar classes Drums 7 years and plus The ideal age to start drums classes Voices 12 years and plus The ideal age to start voices classes Saxophone 7-8 years The ideal age to start saxophone classes Flute 7-8 years The ideal age to start flute classes Clarinet 7-8 years The ideal age to start clarinet classes Violin 6 years The ideal age to start violin classes Alto 6-7 years The ideal age to start alto classes Cello 7-9 years The ideal age to start cello classes Trumpet 8-10 years The ideal age to start trumpet classes Trombone 8-10 years The ideal age to start trombone classes Basse Guitar 9-10 years The ideal age to start basse guitar classes\n\n>> Learn the piano in a fun and effective way on our online application"}, {"url": "https://lessonsinyourhome.net/blog/6-benefits-of-learning-to-play-the-piano-at-an-early-age/", "page_content": "Before a child is even born, music is already a natural part of their lives. Studies show that the ears, unlike the eyes, are always open to sound, and sound cannot be easily ignored. When a developing infant is in the womb, it is surrounded by the rhythmic heartbeat of its mother. This sound can be heard by the growing infant, and they respond to the sound of their mother\u2019s beating heart.\n\nPiano Teachers who come to your home! Meet our piano teachers and see if we serve your area. Learn More\n\nAn understanding and love for music seem to come naturally for babies and most young children. If you have any doubts, pay attention to how a crying baby responds when you start singing or humming, or watch a toddler start to dance to the beat of a drum. Besides the joy that music may bring to your child, there are lifelong benefits for children who take music lessons at a young age. Piano lessons in Miami have some pretty amazing perks for your little one.\n\n1. Children who take piano lessons perform better in school.\n\nChildren\u2019s minds are porous. They are more open to learning new skills and information. When a child takes piano lessons at an early age, it promotes creativity and abstract thought, making it easier for them to learn in school. Piano lessons promote brain development for children and help develop fine motor skills. Children who take music lessons have better verbal and memory skills than others and find it easier to learn in school. Studies show that children receiving musical training not only learn to play the instrument but also increase their IQ.\n\nAdditionally, those who have developed rhythm skills perform better academically in their early school years. Studies also show a change of structure of the areas of the brain that are involved in playing music. During piano lessons, children are practicing to focus and are learning new things. When children start taking piano lessons at a young age, this can help prepare them for the structure of a classroom environment. Children who play the piano also have higher test scores and better overall performance in the classroom.\n\n2. Piano lessons help develop musical talent.\n\nChildren who learn to play the piano at an early age are more prepared for joining a school band since piano lessons teach some of the key concepts that students will need to know, even if they choose another instrument to play in the future. During piano lessons, your child will learn rhythm, how to read music, theory, and ear training. Learning to read music gives your child a basic understanding that will help them in playing other instruments if they desire to do so or in writing music of their own. Learning to play the piano at an early age develops musical talent and skills that can open the door to an amazing and fulfilling career in the future.\n\n3. Playing the piano helps to relieve stress.\n\nMany studies have shown that those who play the piano have less anxiety and depression as well as better overall mental health. Playing the piano helps children to relieve stress, be in a calmer state of mind, and also helps increase positive emotions. Piano playing also allows children to express themselves and is a good way to express feelings of sadness, happiness, and excitement since different songs bring different emotions. Piano practice can be used as a creative outlet for children\u2019s emotions since the impact music has on our emotions is phenomenal.\n\n4. Playing the piano is a good way for children to use their time.\n\nChildren often waste a lot of time watching tv, on the internet, social media, and video games. Each of these offers very few benefits. On the other hand, playing the piano increases hand-eye coordination and skills that can benefit children in many aspects of their lives. Playing the piano is satisfying and gives children a sense of accomplishment each time they learn how to play a new song. Learning different, unusual music pieces, different sounds, unison, and harmony are creative ways to occupy the mind and cure boredom. Learning to play the piano also uses fine motor skills, and these continue to improve as children practice playing the piano.\n\n5. Learning to play an instrument increases confidence in children.\n\nPiano students gain confidence in their abilities when they experience correction of their mistakes and praise when they get it right. While learning to play the piano, children will naturally receive positive praise as well as constructive criticism. Constructive criticism can teach humility. Through humility, we learn there may be better ways to accomplish a job. All through life, we receive praise and criticism, so when children learn to take criticism in a more positive way, it helps them prepare for feedback in the future.\n\nWhen a child who takes piano lessons learns to take criticism and use it to an advantage to improve performance, their confidence increases. This is good for students in all subjects. Children will use this skill at school, work, play, and in their relationships throughout their entire life. Each time they practice and complete a music piece, their confidence will grow. Performing in recitals also gives confidence in overcoming fear. This develops skills in leadership and brings satisfaction in other areas of life. Self-confidence is a trait so necessary in every area of life for success.\n\n6. Piano lessons introduce patience, organization, and discipline.\n\nChildren learn to be patient with themselves and their Miami piano teachers when they accept their mistakes and learn from them. Patience is when we choose not to give up but try again. Since children who are piano students have to set aside time to practice the recital pieces, patience and discipline are required.\n\nPlaying the piano uses both your mental and physical concentration. This requires the child to be organized and disciplined. While it may be hard at first, split concentration becomes easier. Over time, it becomes second nature for students. This may help in many areas of their life down the line. Organization and self-discipline are hard work, but they each bring the reward of satisfaction for a job well done.\n\nWhen parents enroll their children in piano lessons, they are not only providing them with an education in music but also positive character traits that will help them throughout their entire life!\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in enrolling your child in piano lessons, contact us today!

Picture: Getty\n\nBy Siena Linton\n\nA new study shows evidence that learning to play the piano could preserve memory function in healthy older adults.\n\nThere is already proof that learning a musical instrument is associated with the brain\u2019s ability to change and adapt, and that music can help protect our brains against cognitive decline with age.\n\nNow, a new study has investigated how six months of piano training can affect the brain compared to simply listening to and learning about music, in healthy older adults who have had no formal musical training.\n\nThe study, carried out by researchers in Germany and Switzerland, found that the fornix \u2013 a region in the brain associated with memory \u2013 degenerated at a slower rate in adults who actively took part in piano lessons compared to those who didn\u2019t.\n\nBased on previous evidence showing that playing a musical instrument could \u201cpromote healthy ageing\u201d, researchers from various universities across Hanover and Geneva wanted to investigate the physical effects that learning a musical instrument over a longer period of time had on the adult brain.\n\nRead more: \u2018Music for people living with dementia is a necessity\u2019, says national campaign\n\nBallerina with Alzheimer\u2019s listens to Swan Lake, and it all comes back\n\n121 healthy adults aged between 62 and 78, who had fewer than six months of extracurricular musical training, took part in the study, which saw them split into two groups.\n\nOver a six-month period, the first group took part in piano lessons with an hour of tuition each week, and 30 minutes\u2019 daily practice as homework.\n\nThe second group learned about music genres from classical to pop, as well as learning about instruments and composers, but did not take part in active music-making. They were also given homework to actively listen to music, read texts and prepare presentations.\n\nAt the end of the six-month study period, the researchers found that the structure of the fornix in participants who learned to play the piano was stabilised. These results suggest that concentrated, regular music practice could help aspects of memory in older adults, and that piano training \u201cmay counteract naturally occurring age related decline of underlying neural structures\u201d.\n\nRead more: 101-year-old man with Alzheimer\u2019s shows us all the eternal power of music\n\nThe loss of episodic memory is one of the first signs of Alzheimer\u2019s, which is the most common form of dementia.

The twang in her voice comes naturally.\n\nLandes calls it a \u201clilt,\u201d but she says, \u201cpeople have always thought I had a twang in my voice, and my parents were always like, where did that come from?\u201d\n\nA native of Indiana, she grew up mostly in Kentucky; Loretta Lynn once actually came to sing at the coal mine where her father worked. After graduating from New York University, Landes stuck around in the city to become part of its folk music scene and to build a career as a producer and sound engineer.\n\n2. She\u2019s attracted to the vintage Nashville \u201ccountrypolitan\u201d sound.\n\nLandes\u2019 musical output \u2013 five albums over the past 13 years \u2013 is an eclectic assortment of indy rock, folk, and pop sounds (including an entire album sung in French). But she\u2019s always been attracted to the lush sounds and legendary artists who came out of country in the 1960s. About four years ago, with more than a little bit of Dolly\u2019s register in her voice, she came in second at an annual competition in Sevierville, Tennessee, that honors Parton\u2019s songwriting.\n\n\u201cI did it on a whim,\u201d she says. \u201cMy friend dared me to enter it.\u201d\n\nTennessee continued to beckon, and after traveling to Nashville for songwriting sessions, Landes decided a couple of years ago that she had to record her own countrypolitan album.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I was going for, but I didn\u2019t know how to get it myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought it would be great to work with someone who was sort of entrenched in the long-ago scene. I went straight to the source.\u201d\n\nShervin Lainez\n\n3. She talked a country legend out of semi-retirement to produce the album.\n\nDetermined to produce an authentic sound, Landes set her sights on Fred Foster, the Hall of Fame member who was pivotal in the careers of Parton, Roy Orbison and Kris Kristofferson. Now 86, Foster hadn\u2019t produced an album since 2007 \u2013 and that one featured country deities Merle Haggard and Ray Price.\n\nBoldly, Landes cold-called Foster to plead her case. So what made him say yes?\n\n\u201cPart of it was persistence on my end,\u201d she says, but she finally won him over with her songwriting skills.\n\nTogether, they spent hours polishing the songs before she ever entered the studio; Foster then assembled a who\u2019s who list of studio musicians, including Hall of Famer Charlie McCoy. Even Hall of Fame artist Bobby Bare dropped by to serve as a sly foil on a duet.\n\n4. Landes now has a bona fide Loretta Lynn connection.\n\nAfter moving to Nashville last year, Landes answered a Craigslist ad and ended up buying a blue pickup from Lynn\u2019s music director, Bart Hansen. They have since become friends, and Hansen can be seen playing guitar, over Landes\u2019 right shoulder, in the \u201cTraveling\u201d video. For that matter, the pickup is in the video, too, as well as a lyrical mention of \u201cLoretta on the radio.\u201d\n\nAt Hansen\u2019s behest, Landes recently home-recorded a video greeting to Lynn, whom Hansen visits weekly while she recuperates from a stroke and a broken hip.\n\n\u201cShe sent me one back,\u201d Landes marvels. \u201cCan you believe that? I have a video of Loretta saying hello to me and \u2018I hope you have a good day.\u2019 I love it so much.\u201d\n\nShervin Lainez\n\n5. She met her husband at music camp.\n\nOr, more formally, the prestigious Johnny Mercer Writers Colony, where both received grants in 2015 to work on full-length musicals.\n\nHusband Creighton Irons is an accomplished musical composer \u2014 and an incredibly supportive spouse who can be seen on the keyboard in the \u201cTraveling\u201d video. He also plans to join Landes on stage for at least a portion of the U.S. and European tour she\u2019ll be on through October to support the album.\n\nWhether their 1-year-old daughter, Callan, will be with them or with her grandparents has yet to be determined, but she\u2019s already well acquainted with Mom\u2019s new album. Not only has she attended recent shows, but Landes was pregnant during all of the recording sessions.\n\n\u201cShe was there the entire time, really,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope she likes it when she\u2019s older. I hope she\u2019s not like, \u2018All those songs!

She hooked Tape Op up with an interesting interview with stomp box designer John Schumann (issue #43). But mostly she kept busy in studios, working at Stratosphere Sound (issue #37), Engine Room Audio, Looking Glass Studios, Dubway Studios and Fireproof (issue #20). Along the way Dawn did live sound in New York and on the road, toured as a backing musician with the band Hem, and slowly worked on own her own albums. More recently she has teamed up with Steve Salett (who sat in for parts of this interview) to open Saltlands Studio in Brooklyn. Her persistence and drive keep her busy, but have paid off, and I wanted others to know how she did it.\n\nDid you go to school to study recording?\n\nI went to NYU for two years and then I dropped out and started working in studios. I had recorded my own stuff in high school on a 4-track, and then I took a film scoring class at NYU. I remember one of our tests was to make a score for Planet of the Apes. That was fun! That's were I learned Pro Tools. I took a MIDI class at NYU. It was called \"MIDI For Non-Majors.\"\n\nDoes anyone give a shit about MIDI anymore?\n\nI know! This was before Clive Davis got involved with the program. Before that they had no money. All of the equipment was terrible!\n\nWhen I first met you, I think you were assisting at Stratosphere?\n\nI was working at Stratosphere and a few other studios before that. I met this tech, Steve Masucci, who repaired the Chamberlin [keyboard]. I was asking him all these questions and he ended up hiring me as his assistant.\n\nWere you running around, helping Steve do installs and repairing synthesizers?\n\nJust a little bit. I also helped him recap a board \u2014 the pans on a Helios console.\n\nAt Henry Hirsch's Waterfront Studio? [issue #56]\n\nIt was at his old place in the Edison Hotel \u2014 same Helios though.\n\nSo you jumped into studio work.\n\nI did! I made a lot of mistakes. Before Stratosphere, I got my first internship at Looking Glass Studios when I was in college. I was there for six months. I started assisting there. Then I went to Dubway \u2014 Great guys. Al Houghton taught me all about the tape machine. He's a real electrical engineer \u2014 kind of over my head sometimes, but really awesome. I was assisting at Dubway and Stratosphere Sound. Then just Stratosphere. Then I was the house engineer at Engine Room Audio. That was cool. Engine Room started out like this, as rehearsal spaces. Then Mark [Christensen] made a nice room.\n\nI thought he was doing a lot of mastering.\n\nThat's his main thing.\n\nThere was engineering going on too?\n\nYeah, we had a Trident. It was a manufacturing house too. There were always artists in and out of there that I knew from playing and gigging around.\n\nWhat kinds of jobs were coming in there?\n\nI did some weird stuff there. I remember once a dude just brought in some vinyl and had me transfer it. Then he brought in his reverb unit \u2014 he was rapping and I was cutting up these things for him. It was low budget \u2014 he would book a couple of hours at a time. It was all misogynistic shit. That was a moment where I wondered what I was doing with my life! This lady did a seven-disc series of test prep CDs which took me forever. I did it in Logic and I had never used Logic before. It was pretty new age-y \u2014 singing bowls and gongs. The music was really beautiful, but I'd be droning out to her voice. The music made me feel really spacey. That whole time I was also working with Steve Masucci and Victor Van Vugt [issue #48], Gary Maurer and his band Hem. I started touring with Hem, and that kind of launched me for touring. I was playing glockenspiel, sometimes singing and playing guitar.\n\nHave you learned from a lot of different folks along the way?\n\nI've had some great teachers. Victor Van Vugt made me his assistant on a couple of projects, which was awesome. He had a little project studio on Christopher Street. I got to track at Jolly Roger in Hoboken. Gary Maurer put me on a bunch of recordings. We worked on some projects at Brooklyn Recording and Sear Sound [issue #41] \u2014 amazing.\n\nPart of this game is getting out and meeting people.\n\nYeah, totally! I was basically working in studios for five years. I wasn't recording much of my own music \u2014 I was recording when I had time.

Research shows that learning an instrument helps students with reading and math skills and helps them develop self-esteem and confidence. Plus, learning how to play an instrument such as the guitar can provide a lifetime of fun and enjoyment! What is the best age to play guitar? For most students, the best age to learn guitar is around age 7. But it\u2019s important to note that all students are different, so there really isn\u2019t a best age to start guitar lessons. Realistically, students can start guitar lessons as soon as they can comfortably hold a small-scale guitar and press down the strings.\n\nAs a parent, you\u2019ll have to consider other factors as well when determining if your child is ready to start guitar, like the maturity of your kid and their interest level in learning to play an instrument. Is your child ready to start playing guitar? So you want to see if your child is ready to start jamming? That\u2019s great! The guitar is a great instrument for all skill levels and ages, but it\u2019s best to start with guitars made for beginners, especially for kids with smaller frames. To see if your child is ready to start playing, start by looking at how your child holds the guitar. While seated, your kid should be able to comfortably reach the low notes with their fretting hand without having to completely straighten their arm. Their elbow should be slightly bent. If they\u2019re having a difficult time, you may need to look at smaller guitar sizes. 5 signs your child is ready to start guitar lessons\n\nThere are a handful of signals that can tell you when your child is ready to play the guitar. Before beginning lessons, your kid should show the following signs:\n\nYour child shows a strong interest in playing the guitar. You\u2019ll know it if your child wants to be a rock star, even from a young age. Learning the guitar is much easier if your child shows a strong interest. That desire will motivate them to learn.\n\n\n\nYour child can focus for at least 30 minutes. When looking at what age to start guitar lessons, it\u2019s important to look at how long your child can focus. While playing the guitar is fun, students must be able to focus for at least 30 minutes to start seeing results.\n\n\n\nYour child is motivated to practice guitar. Regular practice is important for students to get over the initial learning curve. At first, parents may need to help their children manage their practice time throughout the week, especially if they\u2019re new to the guitar.\n\n\n\nYour child has basic finger dexterity. Playing the guitar doesn\u2019t require significant finger strength, but having basic finger dexterity will make it far easier for beginners to learn songs and build confidence.\n\n\n\nYour child is mature enough to start guitar lessons. Age doesn\u2019t have to be the only factor deciding whether your child is ready for lessons. In order to learn the guitar, kids need to have enough maturity to listen to their teachers and take their direction.\n\nTips when starting guitar Here are several tips you can use to help your child when starting guitar: Select the right guitar. Not all guitars are made equal, and knowing which guitar is best for beginners can set your child up to play with confidence and success. This tip is important, since an improperly sized guitar can turn a rewarding experience into a frustrating one. Try out several guitars to see how they fit, and look at multiple sizes (full size, half size, etc.) to figure out what fits your child best.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot all guitars are made equal, and knowing which guitar is best for beginners can set your child up to play with confidence and success.

Guitar picks can make it easier for kids to play, especially for kids with tender or sensitive fingers. Try out different thicknesses to find the one that\u2019s best for you. It will take some guidance from a guitar instructor and some practice to master the use of the pick, but learning this skill will ultimately pay off.\n\n\n\n\n\nGuitar picks can make it easier for kids to play, especially for kids with tender or sensitive fingers.

While younger people tend to learn faster, you are still capable of learning guitar as a beginner whether you are 30, 40, 60, or even 70.\n\nIn this guide, I will go through what it is like to learn guitar at different ages based on my experiences with students.\n\nI have had students start learning guitar at all ages up to early 70s. So if you\u2019re concerned over whether it\u2019s too late for you to learn guitar, read this guide in full.\n\nIf you decide to try learning guitar, read through this guide on how to start learning guitar.\n\nIf you have any other questions before you start, check out this FAQ on common questions about learning guitar.\n\nLearning Guitar and Neuroscience (How Your Brain Works)\n\nBefore I go through what it is like to learn guitar at different ages, it\u2019s important to look at how our brains develop and change as we age.\n\nIt might be easy for me to say that it\u2019s never too late to learn guitar, but there is a science behind this view.\n\nIf you\u2019re over 25, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s too late. While you may be past your prime in terms of brain development, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t learn something new.\n\nThe below chart from Harvard University gives us a clear picture of what it\u2019s like to learn something new based on age:\n\nThe blue line explains why children are so quick at learning new skills such as guitar.\n\nA child\u2019s brain is easily able to change (called neuroplasticity) and adapt to new experiences.\n\nThis is why a child can learn a musical instrument, a second language, or a new sport with such ease.\n\nAs we get older, our brains mature and reduce in neuroplasticity. You can see that the blue line starts to gradually fall down after the 20s and continues in a straight line.\n\nThe orange line shows that as we get past our 30s, 40s, and 50s, more effort is required to learn something new.\n\nThe key point here is that learning something new requires more effort as you get older. It doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t learn something new after a certain age.\n\nI really want to emphasize this point. There is no age where you cannot learn something new.\n\nLearning guitar as a beginner at 60 years may be twice as hard as it would be if you were 30, but you can still learn it if you put the effort in.\n\nIf you are willing to put the work in, you can learn guitar at any age.\n\nThe only time it\u2019s too late to learn guitar is when you believe you\u2019re too old to learn something new.\n\nThe people who complain that it\u2019s too late for them and that they should\u2019ve learned guitar years ago are only coming up with excuses. Don\u2019t be one of those people. It\u2019s not too late.\n\nRead the relevant section below to see what it\u2019s like to learn guitar at your age.\n\nIs it Too Late to Learn Guitar at 30?\n\nIf you\u2019re well over 30, the above question might make you chuckle as you remember how easily you learned things when you were in your 30s.\n\nBut if you\u2019re under 30 or in your 30s now, it might seem like a valid question.\n\nIf you\u2019re under 30 or in your 30s now, it is not too late to learn guitar. You are at a great time to start learning guitar. Learning guitar at 30 doesn\u2019t require much extra effort as your brain is still at it\u2019s peak.\n\nWhy is it a great time to start learning guitar in your 20s or 30?\n\nOur brains don\u2019t reach peak development until around 25 years. This means our brains are only completely formed at around 25.\n\nIf you\u2019re 25 or under and are worried that it\u2019s too late to learn guitar, get out of here \ud83d\ude42\n\nIf you\u2019re under 20, your brain hasn\u2019t even reached peak development yet. As shown earlier on the chart from Harvard, this means you will find it ridiculously easy to learn guitar compared to somebody older than you.\n\nOf course, the guitar is still hard to learn so you will have to put the effort in, but your age won\u2019t hold you back.\n\nIf you have any doubts over whether it\u2019s too late for you to learn, continue reading about a student I had who started learning guitar in his 70s. Once you read how much effort he put in, you\u2019ll never question whether you\u2019re too old ever again.\n\nIf you\u2019re in your 20s or 30s, go get started learning guitar because your brain is in peak performance and it\u2019s the best time to start.\n\nCheck out the short list of lessons and guides at the end of this article to get started learning guitar.\n\nIs it Too Late to Learn Guitar at 40?\n\nIt is not too late to learn guitar at 40. Your brain at 40 is still capable of learning new skills without too much extra effort.\n\nAs the below chart shows, your brain is still more than capable of adapting to change and learning a new skill at 40.\n\nThe orange line shows that you will need to put a lot more effort in compared to when you were 20 or 30, but it\u2019s not too late.\n\nIf you want to learn guitar, I highly recommend you start as soon as possible, because it will only get harder the longer you put it off. Learning guitar now will be easier than waiting.\n\nWhat holds a lot of people in their 40s back from learning guitar isn\u2019t that they\u2019re too old to learn. What makes it hard for people in their 40s to learn guitar is the time required to practice.\n\nLearning guitar requires regular practice. When you\u2019re in your 40s, you have far less free time available to practice compared to somebody in their 20s or 30s.\n\nYou may have kids or a demanding job that takes up a lot of your free time.\n\nWhen you\u2019re in your 40s, freeing up time every day to practice is the most important thing you can do to learn guitar.\n\nYour brain is still very capable of adapting and learning new skills, so the only thing that may hold you back is time.\n\nIf you can set up a proper practice area and follow the advice in this guide to get the most out of your practice sessions, you\u2019ll do fine.\n\nI have had countless students in their 40s and they manage to learn guitar just as easily as students in their 20s or 30s if they put regular practice time in.\n\nCheck out the short list of lessons and guides at the end of this article to get started learning guitar.\n\nIs it Too Late to Learn Guitar at 50?\n\nIt is not too late to learn the guitar at 50. You will need to put more time and effort into practice compared to a 40 or 30 year old, but your brain at 50 is still capable of learning new skills.\n\nAs the below chart shows, learning new skills at 50 is still very possible (blue line), but it does require extra effort (orange line).\n\nThe key point to remember is that it\u2019s not too late. Your brain is still capable of learning new skills and your hands will still be nimble enough (with exercises) to play everything you want to play.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that it will take you longer to start seeing progress as a beginner at 50.\n\nWhile it might take a bit longer for you to get started and feel like you\u2019re improving, you will make progress.\n\nDon\u2019t give up and think that you\u2019re too old. It\u2019s not true.\n\nI\u2019ve had quite a few students over the years who came to me as beginners in their 50s. While some of them were slower to start than my younger students, only one of them wasn\u2019t capable of learning to play the music they wanted.\n\nThe only reason one of those students had trouble was that he was a concreter and his hands were wrecked from decades of hard labor. Unless your hands are fried from decades of physical labor, you\u2019ll be fine.\n\nDepending on your family and career commitments, you may have less time compared to a younger person to dedicate to practice.\n\nAs long as you can regularly schedule time to practice (even 5 minutes per day is fine), you will get there.\n\nIf you still have doubts, keep reading for a story of a student of mine who started learning guitar in his 70s.\n\nCheck out the short list of lessons and guides at the end of this article to get started learning guitar.\n\nIs it Too Late to Learn Guitar at 60?\n\nIt is not too late to learn the guitar at 60. You will need to put more time and effort into practice compared to a 40 or 50 year old, but your brain at 60 is still capable of learning new skills.\n\nAs the below chart shows, learning new skills at 60 is still very possible (blue line), but it does require extra effort (orange line).\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that learning guitar for the first time at 60 is hard.\n\nThe above chart shows that it requires far more effort than it does for anybody younger than you.\n\nBut it\u2019s not too late.\n\nI\u2019ve had quite a lot of students in their 60s take lessons with me as beginners.\n\nMost of them had just retired and wanted to learn something new.\n\nWhile learning guitar in your 60s requires more effort and practice, the good news is that you will likely have more time available to practice.\n\nIf you have retired, you can dedicate more time to practice to compensate for the extra effort required to learn the new skills.\n\nThe most important point I\u2019d like you to remember is that the start of learning guitar is the hardest and it will get easier.\n\nIt may feel impossible to play the simplest things on guitar, but with practice, it will get easier.\n\nIf you have the discipline to practice every day, you will eventually get to the point where you can play the music you want.\n\nCheck out the short list of lessons and guides at the end of this article to get started learning guitar.\n\nIs it Too Late to Learn Guitar at 70+?\n\nIt is not too late to learn the guitar at 70 or older. You will need to put in more time and effort into practice compared to a younger person, but you are still capable of learning new skills.\n\nThe mere fact that you\u2019re researching this question already tells me that you have what it takes to learn guitar. There are people in their 60s and early 70s who refuse to learn how to use any technology. So if you\u2019re using a computer or smartphone to research this question, you\u2019re going to be fine learning guitar.\n\nAs the below chart shows, learning new skills at 70 requires a significant amount of effort (orange line) compared to a younger person.\n\nBut the blue line shows that it is still possible for your brain to adapt and learn new skills.\n\nMy student who started learning guitar in his 70s I have only had one student over the years who started learning guitar in his 70s (he told me his ages, I didn\u2019t ask!). This student used to work with David Gilmour before Pink Floyd existed and he wanted to learn some early Santana, Cream, and Pink Floyd songs. He figured if those guys\u2019 hands could still play at their ages, he could at least try. While those great guitarists started to learn guitar at a much younger age, the fact that they can still physically play in their 60s, 70s, and 80s is important to keep in mind. It\u2019s this attitude that got him through the tough initial stages and eventually got him to the point where he learned to play full songs from memory. I want to emphasize that this student started learning guitar in his early 70s and managed to learn and play full songs. There were many times when he was frustrated and felt like he wasn\u2019t making progress. Everybody feels this way, whether you\u2019re 15, 50, or 72. I\u2019ve had students in their teens complain that guitar is too hard to learn and it\u2019s too late for them. Yet this student had the discipline to stick with it. He practiced every day and put in a lot of hours each week. The way I convinced him to stick with learning guitar was by recording him play each week. Then any time he felt he wasn\u2019t improving, I would show him a recording of him playing the same piece from a month ago. Every time he watched an earlier recording of him playing something, he noticed how he had improved his technique since the recording. Even if he didn\u2019t feel like he was improving, he could clearly see and hear evidence that he was getting better. He continued to practice hard and didn\u2019t let his age stop him. That\u2019s the attitude to take if you want to learn guitar, regardless of your age.\n\nUnless you\u2019re well over 70 or have health issues with your hands, you are fully capable of learning guitar. If you ever think to yourself that you\u2019re too old, remind yourself that that\u2019s just an excuse.\n\nThe only time it\u2019s too late to learn guitar is when you believe you\u2019re too old to learn something new.\n\nA great side benefit of learning to play the guitar is that its fantastic exercise for your brain. Learning any new skill in your 70s is a fantastic way of keeping your mind sharp. If you\u2019re thinking about trying to learn guitar, I highly recommend it at any age for the mental benefits it can give you.\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to start learning guitar, here are some useful guides and lessons to get going:\n\nGood luck and no matter how old you are, give it a good shot and you\u2019ll be surprised by what you can achieve."}]}
