UEFA.com reviews his career to date.\n\nEarly promise and pain\n\nGameiro, 29, makes no bones about the fact he always thought he would be a footballer when he roamed the streets of his home town of Senlis, on the outskirts of Paris, dreaming of emulating his idol Ronaldo. He started realising that dream in the reserves at Strasbourg aged 16, making his senior debut in Ligue 1 barely a year later.\n\nHe scored his first professional goals in a dramatic UEFA Cup game against Crvena zvezda in December 2005, two late headers salvaging a 2-2 draw. A dream first season had a nightmare ending, however, as Gameiro ruptured knee ligaments and missed the remainder of the campaign, which ended with Strasbourg relegated.\n\n\u00a9AFP/Getty Images\n\nA lust for goals\n\nIt was not until he switched to Lorient in June 2008 that Gameiro realised his true potential, posting 11 league goals in his first season, 17 in his next and 22 in his third and final term with the Brittany team.\n\nThat convinced Paris Saint-Germain to swoop in summer 2011, Gameiro joining the club he had supported as a boy. A runners-up finish behind Montpellier was followed by the Parc des Princes outfit winning the title in 2012/13, when Gameiro, in a reduced role, still managed an impressive eight goals in seven league starts.\n\nMaking Sevilla his home\n\nHungry for regular football, Gameiro succumbed to the advances of Sevilla, who tried to sign him a year earlier, in July 2013. Though he started fewer games than Bacca, Gameiro outscored his strike partner with 21 goals in his first campaign and converted the decisive penalty against Benfica in the UEFA Europa League final.\n\n\u00a9Getty Images\n\nSeventeen goals and another UEFA Europa League triumph followed the next season, but it was not until Bacca left for Milan that Gameiro showed his true worth. Gameiro gave a simple explanation for his most fruitful season, telling UEFA.com: \"The most important thing as a striker is to be confident. This season I feel completely confident and everyone trusts me.\"\n\nIf Gameiro can maintain that level of belief at Atl\u00e9tico, the Rojiblancos will have made some signing."}, {"url": "https://www.intothecalderon.com/2017/10/4/16391812/kevin-gameiros-disappearing-act-atletico-madrid-la-liga", "page_content": "These are strange, new times at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Diego Simeone is embracing rotation like never before \u2014 and for the second consecutive season, Atl\u00e9tico are unbeaten in LaLiga entering the second international break. However, the increasing dependence/reliance on youth and squad depth has had a couple hiccups. It\u2019s also come at a price for Atleti\u2019s older players, including Gabi (has started five of nine games in all comps), Diego God\u00edn (has already missed three games) and Juanfran (just three league starts).\n\nThe most curious casualty thus far, though, has to be K\u00e9vin Gameiro.\n\nIn July 2016, Gameiro arrived in Madrid as Simeone\u2019s Plan B, once it became clear Chelsea would not sell Diego Costa. The France international went on to produce a wildly inconsistent season in red and white; he was at times brilliant, forming an excellent partnership with compatriot Antoine Griezmann. But there were the patches of invisibility and the inability to take chances when the business end of the season came along (I need not remind you of the glorious chance he blew in the Champions League semifinal first leg). Gameiro could not escape the \u201cenigmatic\u201c tag \u2014 in hindsight, maybe it wasn\u2019t a great idea to spend \u20ac32 million-plus on a slight-of-build forward who has scored three times in 17 UCL appearances and who hasn\u2019t scored 20-plus league goals in six years.\n\nStill, Gameiro is a fine striker. He did score a dozen league goals last season. He\u2019s blazing fast and has undeniable chemistry with Griezmann; only Grizi created more goals between LaLiga and the Champions League than Gameiro\u2019s 20. You could do worse than him \u2014 in fact, Simeone already is, by playing Luciano Vietto over him.\n\nVietto has made five starts already this season and has yet to score. Despite an improved work ethic (nearly two tackles per 90 minutes), he looks the same awkward fit he was in Simeone\u2019s team two years ago. El Cholo has him, so he has to use him, but Vietto has failed to last more than 65 minutes in any appearance and Atl\u00e9tico have been held to a goalless draw in three of the 23-year-old\u2019s past four starts \u2014 in one of those starts, against AS Roma, he missed a golden opportunity 1v1 to put his side ahead.\n\nYou could do worse than Gameiro \u2014 in fact, Simeone already is, by playing Luciano Vietto over him.\n\nGameiro, meanwhile, has made just two substitute appearances for a total of 27 minutes: he played 18 minutes of the 0-0 draw at Valencia and nine minutes in the 2-0 win vs. Sevilla. He has yet to share the pitch with Griezmann or attempt a shot.\n\nGriezmann and \u00c1ngel Correa are Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s two best forwards \u2014 that\u2019s not debatable. But what IS debatable is El Cholo\u2019s decision to give Vietto burn while Gameiro sits on the bench. It perhaps has something to do with the 30-year-old\u2019s reported decision to go on summer holiday rather than get a groin operation, which led to him missing the season\u2019s first two weeks. That could have soured his relationship with the coach \u2014 who had already told him he wasn\u2019t his first choice \u2014 and it\u2019s undoubtedly given rise to rumors that Everton will launch a bid for Gameiro when the transfer window reopens in January.\n\nBut there\u2019s a long way to go between now and then. The \u201cif you have him, you may as well use him\u201d philosophy is the main reason why Vietto has featured so often over the season\u2019s first six weeks \u2014 and by extension, it is a reason why Atl\u00e9tico have scored just five goals in the past five league contests. The situation has to be the same for Gameiro as Atl\u00e9tico look for a solution to these recent attacking woes.\n\nWhat do you think? Does Gameiro deserve more playing time?

The trio of goals made comfortable what had been a very difficult game for Atl\u00e9tico, which earned its first win at El Molin\u00f3n since 2008.\n\nWith the Champions League looming, Diego Simeone chose to rotate comparatively little. \u00c1ngel Correa was handed his first league start of 2017 and \u0160ime Vrsaljko stepped into the XI to replace the injured Juanfran. Lucas Hern\u00e1ndez and Stefan Savi\u0107 retained their places as the two center backs with Diego God\u00edn and Jos\u00e9 Gim\u00e9nez on the mend.\n\nThe first half was an intense affair with little good football that was dominated by Sporting. Rubi\u2019s side set up in a 4-5-1, which stifled Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s attacking 4-3-3 and controlled the midfield. Lacina Traore - all 6\u20198\u2019\u2019 of him - was a handful for Atleti\u2019s defenders, who also struggled to track left winger Burgui\u2019s super runs near the penalty area. Sporting received a handful of corners that went for nought, and the first 45 minutes petered out into a goalless stalemate.\n\nThat stalemate would end very quickly in the second half. Immediately off the restart, Gabi played a long ball to Torres, who headed down for a charging Yannick Carrasco. The Belgian\u2019s shot was mostly saved by Iv\u00e1n Cu\u00e9llar, but Carrasco fired in from a couple yards to make sure his goal counted. Atl\u00e9tico had the lead.\n\nHowever, the 1-0 advantage would last only three minutes. Burgui, unmarked, crossed into the box and the ball fell for Sergio \u00c1lvarez. The ensuing shot pinballed off Filipe Lu\u00eds and past a well-positioned Savi\u0107 into the net to level the scores with essentially an entire second half to play.\n\nSporting looked set to resume its dominance from the first half and looked the more likely side to go ahead 2-1 until Simeone went to his substitutes. In the 61st minute, El Cholo inserted Gameiro and Sa\u00fal \u00d1\u00edguez for Torres and Correa, and in the 68th minute Carrasco made way for Thomas Partey. With Gabi and Sa\u00fal in the middle and Koke and Thomas on the flanks, Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s midfield went from liability to supercharged death machine. Antoine Griezmann had a goal wrongly ruled out 15 minutes from time, but that moment made it clear that Atleti had steered the game where it needed to be.\n\nAt 79:34, the French Connection would link up to restore the lead. Griezmann slipped through a sensational pass to Gameiro, who rounded Cu\u00e9llar to finish expertly with his left foot. That goal likely would have been enough to seal the three points, but Gameiro was not close to done yet. At 80:53, Gameiro scored his second with the right foot after Thomas knocked down a pass intended for Sporting center back Fernando Amorebieta and the ball pinged straight into the Frenchman\u2019s path. Finally, at 84:18, Gameiro latched onto a pinpoint Griezmann long ball, and with the flag down, coolly completed his hat trick with a clean right-footed strike. With that, Sporting had been opened up and put to the sword, and Atl\u00e9tico saw out the win from there.\n\nThe hat trick put a fair helping of gloss onto what had been a nearly 80-minute struggle for los colchoneros, but the three points nonetheless extended Atleti\u2019s unbeaten run in LaLiga to eight games. Gameiro and Griezmann are now tied for fifth in the Pichichi race with nine goals apiece, and Griezmann is on six assists, which gives him the third-highest total in the league. Atleti will fly to Germany on Monday secure in the knowledge that fourth place remains in safe hands for another week, as the Champions League shoots again to the forefront."}, {"url": "https://en.atleticodemadrid.com/noticias/agreement-with-sevilla-fc-for-the-transfer-of-kevin-gameiro", "page_content": "HE WILL SIGN FOR FOUR SEASONS Agreement with Sevilla FC for the transfer of Kevin Gameiro The French striker has played the last three seasons in the team from Sevilla with which he has scored 67 goals and given 17 assists in three seasons.\n\nAtl\u00e9tico de Madrid and Sevilla FC have reached an agreement for the transfer of Kevin Gameiro to our club.

El Cholo has delayed his departure until Atl\u00e9tico secure a replacement. Part of the delay has been because AC Milan have pulled the plug on Nikola Kalinic's proposed move to Atl\u00e9tico, which has forced the Rijiblancos to turn their attentions to Olivier Giroud."}, {"url": "https://www.footballtransfers.com/en/players/kevin-gameiro", "page_content": "K\u00e9vin Gameiro (FRA) is a a shadow striker and currently plays for Strasbourg.

Gameiro, stylishly celebrating his first international for five years, then completed the scoring with his second goal of the night in the 59th minute.\n\nFrance, with four points from two games, are joint top of the group alongside Holland and Sweden. Bulgaria occupy fourth position on three points.\n\nQuincy Promes scored two early goals to set Holland on their way to a 4-1 victory over Belarus and end a miserable run of home form. Davy Klaassen and Vincent Janssen added two more in the second half as the Dutch, who finished third at the last World Cup in Brazil but failed to qualify for Euro 2016, ended an unprecedented run of five successive home defeats stretching back 16 months.\n\nPromes\u2019 opener in the 14th minute marked his first international goal as he hit the ball through the legs of three defenders. He added a second 15 minutes later with a strong finish from the edge of the penalty area. Belarus threatened with two good chances before the break and then scored straight after it with Sergei Kornilenko\u2019s strong run setting up Aleksey Rios for a close-range finish.\n\nBut the Dutch quickly restored their two-goal advantage in the 54th minute as Klaassen tapped home the rebound after Belarus had lost possession on the edge of their own area. Janssen struck the woodwork but found the net with a thunderous left-foot shot as the Dutch moved to four points from their opening two qualifiers after a draw in Sweden last month. They host France in Amsterdam on Monday.\n\nSweden remain unbeaten after their first two matches thanks to Mikael Lustig\u2019s second-half winner in Luxembourg. The Celtic defender\u2019s half-volley from Marcus Berg\u2019s corner was the only goal of the game.\n\nBelgium hammered Bosnia-Herzegovina 4-0 for their second straight World Cup qualifying win under Roberto Mart\u00ednez, brushing off injuries to lead Europe\u2019s Group H. The European Championship quarter-finalists exposed weaknesses in a Bosnian defence that buckled in the 26th minute when Emir Spahic scored an own-goal.\n\nTwo minutes later a gifted touch from Dries Mertens found Eden Hazard, who ran by defenders and chipped the ball past the goalkeeper, Asmir Begovic.\n\nThe normally well-composed Bosnians were forced into spells of panic defending and Toby Alderweireld made it 3-0 on the hour. Besieged by five Bosnian players, Romelu Lukaku swung in the fourth.\n\nBelgium are level on points with Greece, who defeated a hard-working Cyprus 2-0 to continue their recovery under their new coach, Michael Skibbe.\n\nValentin Stocker came off the bench to score in the last minute and give Switzerland a 3-2 win away to Hungary after Adam Szalai had twice equalised for the hosts. Switzerland struggled to get going in the first half without the suspended Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka, who usually dictates the rhythm in midfield. But Haris Seferovic, the striker widely criticised for his performances at Euro 2016 when he failed to score a goal, put the Swiss in front six minutes after half-time, scoring from a rebound after Xherdan Shaqiri\u2019s shot was saved by Peter Gulacsi.\n\nSzalai equalised two minutes later, also from a rebound after his own shot hit the post. Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez put Switzerland back in front in the 67th minute, volleying home from Valon Behrami\u2019s lofted cross for his first international goal, only for Szalai to equalise again four minutes later. Switzerland were not to be denied, however, and snatched the points when a long thrown-in was twice headed on and Stocker scored at the far post.\n\nThe Swiss went top of Group B with six points from two matches following a game in which all five goals were scored after half-time, while Hungary were left with one point and already look unlikely to make a first World Cup appearance since 1986.\n\nThe Faroe Islands are second with four points after their shock 2-0 win in Latvia. Portugal and Latvia have three and Andorra none."}]}
