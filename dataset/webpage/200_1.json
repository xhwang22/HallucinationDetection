His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a38.45 million the following season.\n\nFollowing his arrival in England, Koscielny was regarded as one of the best players in his position in the Premier League. He had established himself as a core component in the Arsenal first team, as well as contributing with a host of individual performances, including aiding in ending the club's nine-year trophy drought, scoring a crucial equalizer en route to winning the FA Cup in 2014.

He showed remarkable improvement in aerial ability and positional awareness that limited him to just three yellow cards.

Two days later, he made his 200th appearance for Arsenal in the Premier League on a 4\u20130 away victory against Swansea City.\n\nOn the last day of the 2016\u201317 season he received red card for a tackle on Enner Valencia of Everton.

After becoming frustrated at being played out of position as a right back, he joined Tours for an undisclosed fee, quickly establishing himself as the team\u2019s star player in his desired position, ultimately aiding in the club\u2019s promotion into Ligue 1, while also being named in the Ligue 2 Team of the Season.[3] Koscielny continued his impressive performances following a \u20ac1.7 million transfer to fellow French outfit Lorient in 2009, receiving multiple plaudits for his performances, largely cultivating a reputation as a clever, agile, ball-playing defender.[3] His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a38.45 million the following season.\n\nFollowing his arrival to England, Koscielny has widely been regarded to be one of the best players in his position, as well as one of the best in the world.[4][5] He has since established himself as a core component in the Arsenal first team, as well as contributing with a host of individual performances, including aiding in ending the club\u2019s nine-year trophy drought, scoring a crucial equalizer en route to winning the FA Cup in 2014. He was also crucial in further club successes that followed, winning another two FA Cups and the FA Community Shield on three occasions.\n\nDespite having the ability to represent Poland, Koscielny instead decided to represent France, and first appeared up for the national team against Brazil in February 2011.[6] Koscielny has since become a regular starter for the nation in every major tournament that they have appeared in, including UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup, while also leading France to the final of UEFA Euro 2016. He scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland in 2016,[7] and has since amassed forty-nine appearances for the national side.\n\nPrior to the beginning of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Koscielny announced that he would be retiring from international football after the competition, and thus no longer be playing for France.\n\nKoscielny was born in Tulle, Corr\u00e8ze. His career began in 2004 with Guingamp, a team that had produced such talents as Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. Three years later, Koscielny was forced to take stock and drop down to the French third tier. He made 47 appearances for Guingamp, between 2004 and 2007, mostly as a right fullback.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2007, Koscielny joined Tours FC, deciding that he wanted a chance at centre back. He showed remarkable improvement in aerial ability and positional awareness that limited him to just three yellow cards. During the 2008\u201309 season, Koscielny made 34 Ligue 2 appearances, scoring 5 goals from defence, and was named in the division\u2019s best XI at the end of the season.\n\nArsenal confirmed the signing on 7 July 2010 and Koscielny was handed the club\u2019s number 6 shirt, previously worn by Philippe Senderos, who had moved to Fulham earlier in the summer. Wenger explained he bought Koscielny due to the fact he added height to the team and Arsenal were low on centre backs.[10] Koscielny made his debut against Barnet in a pre-season friendly in July 2010. One month later in his competitive debut against Liverpool at Anfield, he was sent off in the 94th minute for a second bookable offence. Both of his yellow cards were shown beyond 90 minutes. The game ended in a 1\u20131 draw with both teams having debut players sent off.[11] He scored his first goal for Arsenal on 11 September 2010, in a 4\u20131 win against Bolton Wanderers.[12]\n\nKoscielny made his debut in European competition on 15 September 2010, when he partnered S\u00e9bastien Squillaci in a 6\u20130 win over Braga at the Emirates Stadium. Koscielny was praised for performances against Sunderland and made a brilliant tackle against Tottenham Hotspur to stop Aaron Lennon from scoring during their Football League Cup tie. On 27 October, he blocked a shot off the line and provided an assist to Theo Walcott against Newcastle United in the fourth round of the League Cup, where Arsenal went on to win the match 4\u20130 at St James\u2019 Park. Koscielny was given a straight red card in Arsenal\u2019s 0\u20131 loss at home against Newcastle United on 7 November 2010. This was his second sending off of the season.\n\nKoscielny playing for Arsenal on 10 September 2011 against Swansea City.\n\nOn 25 January 2011, Koscielny scored the second goal in the 3\u20130 win over Ipswich Town in the League Cup semi-final second leg win at the Emirates Stadium. Throughout January 2011, Koscielny and Johan Djourou were a part of a defence that did not concede a goal in the Premier League. On 1 February, he scored his third goal of the season, which proved to be the winner in a 2\u20131 turn around victory over Everton. Koscielny had arguably his best performance to date for Arsenal in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16 match against Barcelona. The match ended in a 2\u20131 home win for Arsenal. Koscielny\u2019s performances were applauded and praised in many media reports of the game. Former Arsenal defender, Martin Keown, said his performance was \u201cimpressive\u201d and \u201cmagnificent throughout\u201d.[13] On 27 February, in the last minute of the 2011 Football League Cup Final, Koscielny was involved in a mix-up with his goalkeeper Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny, which resulted in Birmingham City striker Obafemi Martins scoring the winning goal.[14]\n\n2011\u201312 season\n\nKoscielny and Fernando Torres in a Premier League match on 21 April 2012.\n\nKoscielny started the 2011\u201312 season alongside Thomas Vermaelen in central defence. Koscielny was injured and taken off the pitch 10 minutes into a 2\u20130 home loss to Liverpool on 20 August 2011. However, he returned to the starting line-up Arsenal\u2019s biggest ever Premier League defeat, losing 8\u20132 to Manchester United at Old Trafford. On 17 September, Koscielny scored an own goal as Arsenal lost 4\u20133 to Blackburn Rovers in the Premier League. He went on to be named man of the match away at Olympique Marseille in the Champions League, where Arsenal won 1\u20130 at the Stade V\u00e9lodrome, keeping their first clean sheet in a Champions League away game since 18 August 2009 against Celtic, where the Gunners had won 2\u20130.\n\nOn 29 October, Koscielny received praise for his solid performance in Arsenal\u2019s 5\u20133 away win against Chelsea. He scored his first goal of the season on 2 January 2012 in a 2\u20131 away defeat against Fulham. He scored his first Champions League goal against A.C. Milan in a 3\u20130 victory in the round of 16 second leg. On 13 May 2012, he scored the winning goal in a 3\u20132 victory against West Bromwich Albion to ensure that Arsenal finished third in the Premier League. He was voted as the team\u2019s fourth most important player by the fans in Arsenal\u2019s Player of the Season poll for his performances throughout the 2011\u201312 season.[15]\n\n2012\u201313 season\n\nOn 24 July 2012, Koscielny signed a new long term contract with Arsenal.[16][17][18] His first goal of the season was a late equaliser against champions Manchester City on 23 September 2012 in a match which ended 1\u20131.[19] On 30 October, he scored a header from a corner in the 88th minute against Reading in the Football League Cup, helping Arsenal come back from 4\u20130 down to eventually win the game 7\u20135.[20]\n\nOn 13 March 2013, Koscielny scored against Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena in the UEFA Champions League Last 16. His goal put Arsenal 2\u20130 ahead on the night and level at 3\u20133 on aggregate, but they still exited the competition on the away goals rule.[21]\n\nOn 19 May, Koscielny scored the winning goal as Arsenal beat Newcastle United 1\u20130 at St James\u2019 Park in their final Premier League fixture of the season to secure a fourth-placed finish and qualification to the 2013\u201314 UEFA Champions League play-off round.[22]\n\nKoscielny was voted as Arsenal\u2019s second best player of the season.[23]\n\n2013\u201314 season\n\nKoscielny started the 2013\u201314 season by conceding a penalty and getting sent off in Arsenal\u2019s 3\u20131 Premier League opening day defeat at home to Aston Villa.[24] However, his partnership with Per Mertesacker saw the Gunners achieve the joint-best defensive record in the Premier League at the halfway point of the season, as the team topped the table.[25]\n\nOn 22 February 2014, Koscielny scored his first goal of the season in a 4\u20131 defeat of Sunderland.[26] In the team\u2019s penultimate home match, Koscielny scored his second goal of the season in a 3\u20130 win against Newcastle United.[26]\n\nOn 9 May 2014, Koscielny signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal.[27]\n\nOn 17 May, Koscielny scored Arsenal\u2019s equalising goal as the team came from 2\u20130 down to defeat Hull City 3\u20132 in the 2014 FA Cup Final, winning his first piece of silverware with the club.[28]\n\n2014\u201315 season\n\nKoscielny and Kieran Gibbs playing for Arsenal in a match against Chelsea on 5 October 2014\n\nOn 16 August 2014, Koscielny opened his goal-scoring account for the season, scoring Arsenal\u2019s first goal in the 2014\u201315 Premier League. The goal was header from a free-kick in first half stoppage time against Crystal Palace at the Emirates Stadium.[29] After sustaining an achilles tendon injury during the October international break, Koscielny was absent from the Arsenal team for seven weeks.[30] On 29 November, he returned to Arsenal\u2019s starting line-up alongside Per Mertesacker in central defence, as the Gunners kept a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 victory against West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns.[31] In the team\u2019s following fixture at home to Southampton, Koscielny helped Arsenal to record a second consecutive clean sheet and 1\u20130 win.[32]\n\nOn 11 January 2015, Koscielny scored the first goal in a 3\u20130 win over Stoke City.[33] On 18 January, he started in central defence as Arsenal shut out defending champions Manchester City to win 2\u20130 at the City of Manchester Stadium.[34] On 10 February, he scored the opening goal as Arsenal defeated Leicester City 2\u20131.[35] On 30 May 2015, Koscielny was selected to start in the 2015 FA Cup Final, playing the full 90 minutes in a 4\u20130 defeat of Aston Villa at Wembley Stadium.[36]\n\n2015\u201316 season\n\nKoscielny started every game in the first month of the season, excluding a 0\u20130 draw with rivals Liverpool at Emirates Stadium,[37] due to an injury. Koscielny played a vital part as Arsenal won 5 games out of six in October to go second in the Premier League, with Koscielny scoring in successive Premier League wins against Everton and Swansea.[38][39] With manager Arsene Wenger opting to play Gabriel Paulista ahead of vice-captain Per Mertesacker, Koscielny began appearing as captain in February, due to injuries to other captains Santi Cazorla & Mikel Arteta. This ended after a 3\u20132 defeat to Manchester United, when Koscielny missed four games through injury, including a North London derby at White Hart Lane.[40] He returned in a 3\u20131 away defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League, as Arsenal exited the competition at the round of 16 for the sixth season running.[41] Koscielny scored his fourth of the season in a 3\u20133 draw with West Ham.[42]\n\n2016\u201317 season\n\nKoscielny started his first game of the season in a goalless draw against Leicester City. On 10 September, he was given the role of captain and scored a fine overhead kick to equalize for the Gunners in a game which they then won 2\u20131 against Southampton making him Arsenal\u2019s highest goal scoring defender in EPL history, with the landmark achieved on his 31st birthday.[43] Koscielny was involved in a controversial incident at the end of Arsenal\u2019s 1\u20130 win over Burnley, in which Koscielny and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were involved in a goal which appeared to be scored from an offside position after hitting Koscielny\u2019s arm. Neither the perceived deliberate handball or offside offenses were deemed to be infringements and the goal was later correctly credited to Koscielny.[44][45][46] On 12 January 2017, Koscielny, alongside teammates Francis Coquelin and Olivier Giroud signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal.[47] Two days later, he made his 200th appearance for Arsenal in the Premier League on a 4\u20130 away victory against Swansea City.[48][49]\n\nOn the last day of the 2016\u201317 season he received red card for a tackle on Enner Valencia of Everton. Arsenal lost an appeal and Koscielny was banned for three games, meaning he would miss FA Cup final.[50]\n\nAlthough he was absent from the FA Cup final and the Community Shield, Koscielny lifted both trophies alongside Per Mertesacker.\n\nKoscielny was called up to the French national team on 3 February 2011. Before his call up for France, Koscielny was also eligible to play for Poland and initially considered applying for Polish citizenship.[6] In August 2010, it was reported that he had not submitted an application and cancelled a meeting with Poland national team coach Franciszek Smuda in Warsaw on 7 August. Koscielny later declared that his priority was to play for France.[53]\n\nKoscielny was called up to the French team for the first time on 3 February 2011, for the team\u2019s friendly versus Brazil on 9 February.[54][55] Koscielny made his first appearance for les Bleus in a friendly match against the United States on 11 November, playing the entire match in a 1\u20130 win.\n\nHe made his first appearance in a major tournament during UEFA Euro 2012, when he played the entire match in a 2\u20130 defeat to Spain in the quarter-finals but was voted Man of the Match by the French media. On 15 November 2013, he was sent off in a 2014 World Cup qualifying play-off against Ukraine.\n\nOn 13 May 2014, Koscielny was named in Didier Deschamps\u2019 squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[56] He made his FIFA World Cup debut as a substitute for the injured Mamadou Sakho in a 5\u20132 defeat of Switzerland in the team\u2019s second group match.[57] He was then named in the starting line-up for the next match against Ecuador, helping the team to a clean sheet in a 0\u20130 draw.[58] On 4 June 2016, Koscielny scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland."}, {"url": "https://www.thefamousbirthdays.com/people/laurent-koscielny", "page_content": "About Laurent Koscielny\n\nFrench professional football center back Laurent Koscielny started his senior career with Guingamp in 2004.

He was born on the 10th of September, 1985 in Tulle. Koscielny is a center back who is currently the vice-captain of the English Premier League team Arsenal.\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman began his career with Guingamp in 2004 which has produced players like Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. Koscielny played as a fullback for Guingamp in most of the matches.However, he felt that center back was his forte and this made him join Tours FC to take a chance at center back.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his debut season with Tours FC in 2007, Koscielny showed remarkable progress and played a major role in his team\u2019s promotion to Ligue 1. He was also named in the best XI of the season.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe center back continued his good form with Lorient FC in 2009 where he was regarded as one of the best players in his position. He was developing reputation as a clever and an agile defender. His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a38.45 million the following season.\n\n\n\n\n\nDebut\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurent Koscielny had the opportunity to represent Poland but decided to ply his trade with France. He made his first appearance for France on the 9th of February, 2011 in a friendly match against United States. Koscielny played the entire game and his side sealed a 1-0 victory. On the 4th of June, 2016, Koscielny scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland.\n\n\n\n\n\nRise to Glory\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny had a great debut season with Arsenal. He was constantly making great tackles and preventing the opposition from penetrating their back line. In 2011, Koscielny had one of his best performances till date that saw Arsenal beat Barcelona 2-1 in the round of 16 Champions League tie.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman was a great asset to the team as apart from acting as a defender, he had a great goal scoring ability. Till date, Koscielny has scored 24 goals for Arsenal. He is the highest scoring defender for Arsenal in the history of EPL. He is regarded as one of the most important players for Arsenal in the past seven years.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny has won the FA Cup with Arsenal in 2014, 2015 and 2017.

It was the July of 2010 when Arsenal announced the signing of Laurent Koscielny. A typical Arsene Wenger signing, a Frenchman at good value, a player that not many had had the pleasure of watching before and a stranger to most Arsenal fans. However to the Arsenal staff Koscielny was no stranger, Wenger had sent scouts to watch the Frenchman for at least two seasons before finally signing for the Gunners.\n\nKoscielny spent the 2007-2008 season in the Championnat National, the third tier of France with Guingamp, a club who had brought through the likes of Chelsea duo Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. After only one season with Guingamp he joined Ligue 2 side Tours where his manager at the time, Daniel Sanchez was really impressed by him. \u201cHe reads the game well\u201d Sanchez mentioned in a interview with The Independent. \u201cHe has a tactical quality, the quality reading of the game, but also great physical quality.\u201d\n\nAfter establishing himself as a starter alongside Thomas Vermaelen I\u2019m sure the majority of Arsenal fans would agree with the points Sanchez made. The Tours Coach had tipped off the Arsenal manager on his quality and Arsene\u2019s scouts made various trips to watch him during his second season with Tours but a move to Arsenal from Ligue 2 would have possibly too much too soon for Laurent, both Sanchez and Wenger were in agreement that he needed another step before the move to the Gunners.\n\nIn the June of 2009 Koscielny made the move to Lorient, club chairman Lo\u00efc F\u00e9ry revealed that Koscielny was a player that his club had been following for sometime and it\u2019s fair to say that the step up to Ligue 1 was no problem for the quiet centre half. In his debut away to Lille his new side took all three points and then in his second game, his first game at Lorient\u2019s Stade du Moutsoir he headed home the equalising goal as his side came back from two nil down against Montpellier.\n\nAfter 40 appearances in Ligue 1, helping Lorient to a impressive seventh place finish it was time for Koscielny to move to Arsenal, with Philippe Senderos, William Gallas, Mickael Silvestre and Sol Campbell all leaving the club he had a chance to fit straight in the side. Upon signing for The Gunners Wenger said \u201cKoscielny is a central defender with great ability who performed extremely well last season for Lorient. We identified him as a very strong centre-half, who has made big progress very quickly. He has shown he is mentally strong, he\u2019s a fighter and a very strong competitor. Koscielny is a great addition to our squad.\u201d\n\nHis first season for Arsenal was one of many ups and downs. The Carling Cup final will live long in his memory, that moment where he and Wojciech Szczesny got caught up in their own box and between them they effectively handed Birmingham City the trophy on a silver platter. You can imagine how the fans reacted to his moment of indecision that proved to be a valuable lesson in the way he\u2019s grown into a footballer this year.\n\nEven at the start of this year he was part of the terrible 8-2 loss at Old Trafford and he then scored an own goal at Ewood Park against a Blackburn side that are faced with a relegation battle. Since those mistakes he\u2019s had a run in the team and Koscielny has been a perfect illustration of the recent Arsenal revival. It\u2019s safe to say that he has become one of the fans favourite at the Emirates, when you\u2019re there on a match day you see the fans with \u2018Bosscielny\u2019 and his number 6 on their backs and during that match you\u2019ll hear that famous \u2018I wanna dance with Koscielny\u2019 taken from the Whitney Houston classic.\n\nThe Frenchman has brought a new side to the Arsenal defence this calendar year, impressive pace, reading the game well, excellent aerial ability and my favourite, that commanding way he wins the ball and carries it out of the defence. His greatest moment as an Arsenal player so far must be when he won the ball off of Lionel Messi and bought the ball out to start the attack that lead to Andrey Arshavin\u2019s winning goal. What a night at the Emirates that turned out to be.\n\nAfter a steady start for Arsenal it seems ever since that evening against Barcelona, Koscielny has been steadily growing into one of the best defenders in the Premier League and on his day one of the best in Europe. First called up for France in February 2011 and with the Euro 2012 Championships just around the corner I feel Laurent\u2019s competitive edge could give the French defence something different for their tournament, I for one we hope to see him in the starting line up on June 11th when Les Bleus open up against England in Donetsk."}, {"url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/france-vs-iceland-late-bloomer-laurent-koscielny-blossoming-at-the-right-time-for-les-bleus-a7115781.html", "page_content": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for free Sign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

A century of expertise and heritage were coming to an end, as well as almost 20 jobs.\n\nThe owners needed a saviour. They could have gone to President Francois Hollande, former mayor of Tulle, but instead they went to their most famous son, making what a company official described as \u201cappeal to his sense of local pride\u201d.\n\nLaurent Koscielny is a proud Correzien and was quickly persuaded, and led a group of local investors who put \u20ac600,000 in, saving the factory and most of the jobs. Koscielny is now seen as a local saviour, but he never wanted the news to become public. \u201cCa c\u2019est Laurent\u201d, as one friend puts it.\n\nRecommended Read more Everything you need to know about France v Iceland\n\nBut then Koscielny is a man whose profile has still not quite caught up to his status. He has been the best centre-back in England for the last few years, with Vincent Kompany diminished by injuries. He will be playing a European Championship quarter-final tomorrow and has been one of the best defenders at this tournament too. He is two wins away from the biggest night of his life, in Paris next Sunday.\n\nWhen he returns to Arsenal next month he is favourite to be captain. And yet despite all this he remains barely known, private, discrete. He rarely gives interviews. His social media profile does not extend much further than retweeting photographs of his team-mates with captions like \u201cCE SOIR\u201d or \u201cYES\u201d. In the age of the wholly exposed celebrity footballer, his decision to guard some privacy is counter-cultural.\n\nKoscielny is different. He was not picked out young as a future star, did not attend one of France\u2019s prestigious centres de formation, was never told in his youth that he was heading for the top. He did not play a top flight game until 23, did not make his European or international debut until 25. Having been fortunate enough to grow up out of the limelight, he has little enthusiasm to step into it now. He would rather just get home to his young family.\n\nThis is the result of following a very different path from many of his France team-mates. French football still produces talented teenagers but many of them leave France before ever playing senior football here. So it was for Antoine Griezmann and Paul Pogba, who never played a Ligue 1 match and have no intention of doing so any time soon. Kingsley Coman played three times for Paris Saint Germain before heading for Juventus.\n\nKoscielny has been one of the tournament's stand-out defenders (Getty)\n\nIf Ligue 1 looked parochial to some of these talented youngsters, it might have looked unreachable to a teenage Koscielny. He spent the first few years of his career in the French lower leagues, first at Guingamp, then at Tours, a very long way away from the Premier League, the Champions League or Euro 2016.\n\nIt certainly must have felt that way for Koscielny as a skinny teenage boy, as interested in computers as in football, growing up in Tulle in central France. He was not picked up by any major academy but played for the local non-league club Limoges. He thought about becoming a coach or a PE teacher, but spent too much time playing football and could not complete his Baccalaureate.\n\nLimoges were a small club going through a difficult time but they still entered teams into the Coupe Gambardella, France\u2019s knock-out competition for under-19 teams. In 2003 they had a good run and reached the quarter-finals where they were beaten 3-1 by a powerful Lyon side. But the 17-year-old in defence for Limoges caught the eye of the watching scouts. Yvon Schmitt, there working for Guingamp, later recalled how he was \u201cimmediately seduced\u201d by the teenage Koscielny, with his intuitive reading of the game and his assertive interceptions.\n\nSchmitt spoke to Koscielny\u2019s parents Bernard and Viviane hoping to get their son to sign. But Lens wanted him too, showing the family around their brand-new La Gaillette academy, the place that produced Adel Taarabt and Raphael Varane. Koscielny felt more comfortable at Guingamp, who were then fighting to stay in Ligue 1, and signed for them.\n\nIt was only after Guingamp had been relegated that Koscielny made his senior debut for them in November 2004. This was the French second tier, not an easy place for a young defender to learn the game, and he found it tough. There were other bigger more experienced centre-backs and so Koscielny found himself playing at right-back, not a role he especially enjoyed.\n\nI wanted to be happy and to play my natural game <p>Laurent Koscielny</p>\n\nAfter four years at Guingamp the 21-year-old Koscielny decided that he had had enough. Even for a player with so little experience, he had a fully formed sense of how he wanted to play: as a centre-back for a proactive team, making the most of his reading of play. So he joined third-tier team Tours, managed by Daniel S\u00e1nchez, who wanted to build his team around him.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be happy,\u201d Koscielny later explained, \u201cand to play my natural game.\u201d S\u00e1nchez liked Koscielny and tried to iron the rashness out of his play, telling him over and over again that \u2018a defender on the ground can\u2019t do any defending.\u2019 Koscielny inspired Tours to promotion, and in his second season he was back in Ligue 2, not as an occasional right-back but as the best centre-back in the division.\n\nChristophe Le Roux had played with Koscielny at Guingamp a few years before but by 2008 he was working for Lorient, another Breton side, as director of football. He knew Koscielny was talented and was delighted to see him finding his voice at Tours, even in front of 7,000 fans each week.\n\n\u201cAt Lorient we have traditionally been very attentive to the Ligue 2 market,\u201d Le Roux remembers. \u201cI knew Laurent very well, as a player and as a man. I just had to convince the manager and the club that we had to buy him, that his potential interested us.\u201d That was easy enough to do that when, in January 2009, Lorient drew Tours in the Coupe de France. \u201cHe confirmed everything that I had said about him,\u201d Le Roux says, \u201che was a true defender.\u201d\n\nLorient were convinced and their offer of \u20ac1.5million was more than enough to persuade Tours to sell. Koscielny had a choice, with offers on the table that summer from Sochaux and Nantes. But he had flourished since deciding to move to Tours for footballistique reasons and was determined to follow the same path this time. Lorient played attractive football under manager Christian Gourcuff, so Koscielny chose them.\n\nCompared to the young player I saw at Guingamp he was a different man... <p>Christophe Le Roux</p>\n\nAdaptation was easy, and Koscielny fitted into a side that played attractive football high up the pitch. \u201cCompared to the young player I saw at Guingamp he was a different man,\u201d Le Roux says. \u201cHe had much more certainty in his life and in his game. He had a huge maturity to his game and never went to ground.\u201d Koscielny excelled on debut, an away win at Lille, and scored an added-time equaliser in his second game, Montpellier at home. By the end of the season Lorient had finished seventh, the best in their history, as well as reaching the semi-finals of the Coupe de France.\n\nThere are few secrets in Ligue 1 and scouts soon knew about the player Lorient had on their hands. Gilles Grimandi, Arsenal\u2019s man in France, was a regular at the Stade Moustoir and saw a player who could adjust to the pace of English football. Wenger had himself been tipped off by old friend Daniel Sanchez, and with the data showing how many of his individual duels Koscielny won, Wenger was convinced.\n\nArsenal had been looking for new young aggressive centre-backs, having signed Thomas Vermaelen from Ajax the previous summer. So he in June 2010 he called Lorient, a club he knew well through his friendship with Christian Gourcuff. They eventually accepted \u00a310m. Koscielny could have gone anywhere he wanted in France that summer, with Marseille, Lyon and Paris Saint Germain all keen, but decided to come to England.\n\nIn one sense it was a giant leap to go from a mid-table French side to a team who had just finished third in the Premier League, who still had Robin van Persie and Cesc Fabregas in the side. Especially given how recently Koscielny had been playing second and third tier football in France.\n\nBut in another sense it was perfectly natural. Lorient and Arsenal are clubs built on similar football philosophies, which is why Wenger was so keen to loan them Francis Coquelin, Joel Campbell and Gilles Sunu. Koscielny has always wanted to play for possession teams, for ambitious managers, defending on the front foot rather than sitting deep and digging in. That is why he chose to play under S\u00e1nchez and Gourcuff and why he chose to leave France to play for Arsene Wenger. \u201cHe made wise choices at the right moments,\u201d says Le Roux.\n\nKoscielny needed some time to attune his assertive style to the English tempo. He was sent off twice in his first seven Premier League games. But even by the end of his first season he was clearly the best defender at the club, and since then has only got better. Wenger sees him as his best value buy for the last 10 years.\n\nThe player himself is delighted to play for a team and manager in tune with how he sees the game. \u201cI take more pleasure to play in a team which has the ball, rather than playing deep,\u201d he told L\u2019Equipe last month. \u201cI prefer to win the ball as high up and and as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nThat is how Koscielny defends, and there are few better than him in Europe at playing this way. He has not won as many plaudits or as many titles as he might have that, but all that could change this week."}, {"url": "https://talksport.com/football/1072837/laurent-koscielny-retires-bordeux-racism-accusation-arsenal/", "page_content": "Laurent Koscielny has called time on his playing career aged 36, hanging up his boots amid accusations of racism by Bordeaux's ultras - which he strongly denies.\n\nThe former Arsenal captain has been a free agent for two months after leaving Bordeaux in January, and has released a statement saying the allegations of racism have left him 'shocked'.\n\n3 The 36-year-old left the French side in January having spent two-and-a-half seasons at the club Credit: Getty\n\nIn a career that lasted nearly 18 years, Koscielny's finale ended on a slightly sour note and being frozen out of the team towards the end of his spell at Bordeaux.\n\nThe best part of his career was spent at the Emirates Stadium where he made 353 appearances that spanned nine seasons.\n\nHe also helped the club secure three FA Cups and as many Community Shields.\n\nHis departure from Arsenal also ended on a sad note after refusing to join the club on a pre-season tour to the US.\n\nNow he is refuting claims after French publication Sud Ouest reported that he and teammate Benoit Costil are being accused by the club's ultras, UB87, of a lack of leadership and of 'scandalous, sometimes racist' behaviour.\n\nA statement read: \"Following the article published in the Sud Ouest newspaper on March 22, 2022 entitled 'Girondins de Bordeaux.

He was born on the 10th of September, 1985 in Tulle. Koscielny is a center back who is currently the vice-captain of the English Premier League team Arsenal.\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman began his career with Guingamp in 2004 which has produced players like Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. Koscielny played as a fullback for Guingamp in most of the matches.However, he felt that center back was his forte and this made him join Tours FC to take a chance at center back.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his debut season with Tours FC in 2007, Koscielny showed remarkable progress and played a major role in his team\u2019s promotion to Ligue 1. He was also named in the best XI of the season.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe center back continued his good form with Lorient FC in 2009 where he was regarded as one of the best players in his position. He was developing reputation as a clever and an agile defender. His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a38.45 million the following season.\n\n\n\n\n\nDebut\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurent Koscielny had the opportunity to represent Poland but decided to ply his trade with France. He made his first appearance for France on the 9th of February, 2011 in a friendly match against United States. Koscielny played the entire game and his side sealed a 1-0 victory. On the 4th of June, 2016, Koscielny scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland.\n\n\n\n\n\nRise to Glory\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny had a great debut season with Arsenal. He was constantly making great tackles and preventing the opposition from penetrating their back line. In 2011, Koscielny had one of his best performances till date that saw Arsenal beat Barcelona 2-1 in the round of 16 Champions League tie.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman was a great asset to the team as apart from acting as a defender, he had a great goal scoring ability. Till date, Koscielny has scored 24 goals for Arsenal. He is the highest scoring defender for Arsenal in the history of EPL. He is regarded as one of the most important players for Arsenal in the past seven years.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny has won the FA Cup with Arsenal in 2014, 2015 and 2017. He has also won the FA Community Shield in 2014, 2015 and 2017. The center back has made a major contribution in his team\u2019s success in the FA Cup over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\nLow Points\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny has got more than thirty yellow cards and as many as five red cards. This has forced him out of a few crucial encounters and has affected the team\u2019s performance. He has missed more games due to suspension and not because of injury.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe center back must work on preventing harsh tackles so as to represent Arsenal in more and more games and increase their chances of winning more trophies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman is yet to win the Premier League with Arsenal.

He is vice-captain of Arsenal.\n\nBorn in Tulle, Koscielny began his football career playing for a host of youth clubs before moving to Guingamp in 2003, where he quickly progressed through the youth ranks, making his professional debut the following season. After becoming frustrated at being played out of position as a right back, he joined Tours for an undisclosed fee, quickly establishing himself as the team\u2019s star player in his desired position, ultimately aiding in the club\u2019s promotion into Ligue 1, while also being named in the Ligue 2 Team of the Season.[3] Koscielny continued his impressive performances following a \u20ac1.7 million transfer to fellow French outfit Lorient in 2009, receiving multiple plaudits for his performances, largely cultivating a reputation as a clever, agile, ball-playing defender.[3] His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a38.45 million the following season.\n\nFollowing his arrival to England, Koscielny has widely been regarded to be one of the best players in his position, as well as one of the best in the world.[4][5] He has since established himself as a core component in the Arsenal first team, as well as contributing with a host of individual performances, including aiding in ending the club\u2019s nine-year trophy drought, scoring a crucial equalizer en route to winning the FA Cup in 2014. He was also crucial in further club successes that followed, winning another two FA Cups and the FA Community Shield on three occasions.\n\nDespite having the ability to represent Poland, Koscielny instead decided to represent France, and first appeared up for the national team against Brazil in February 2011.[6] Koscielny has since become a regular starter for the nation in every major tournament that they have appeared in, including UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup, while also leading France to the final of UEFA Euro 2016. He scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland in 2016,[7] and has since amassed forty-nine appearances for the national side.\n\nPrior to the beginning of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Koscielny announced that he would be retiring from international football after the competition, and thus no longer be playing for France.\n\nKoscielny was born in Tulle, Corr\u00e8ze. His career began in 2004 with Guingamp, a team that had produced such talents as Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. Three years later, Koscielny was forced to take stock and drop down to the French third tier. He made 47 appearances for Guingamp, between 2004 and 2007, mostly as a right fullback.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2007, Koscielny joined Tours FC, deciding that he wanted a chance at centre back. He showed remarkable improvement in aerial ability and positional awareness that limited him to just three yellow cards.

analysis\n\nBBC Sport's David Ornstein\n\nTowards the end of last season, Arsenal and Koscielny were in negotiations over a contract extension - most likely for an additional year on top of his remaining 12 months.\n\nThe conversation was progressing positively but then Arsenal were beaten by Chelsea in the Europa League final, a result that has had major repercussions for the Gunners.\n\nAs well as causing significant damage to their recruitment plans and possibilities, it also changed certain situations regarding existing players and none more so than Koscielny.\n\nThe 33-year-old is understood to have become increasingly discontent since his return in December from an Achilles injury, primarily over the management of his playing schedule and the direction in which he feels the team and club are moving.\n\nWhile Koscielny was optimistic that Champions League qualification could lead to a better future for both parties - hence the contract talks - missing out exacerbated his misgivings and led him to decide the time had come to move back to France.\n\nOn returning from a summer break and with firm interest from clubs in his homeland, Koscielny informed Arsenal of his wish to leave and hoped his nine years of service and professionalism until this point would help achieve an amicable resolution.\n\nHowever, Arsenal rejected the request and made it clear that they need and expect the Frenchman to honour his contract and be a key part of their squad in the coming campaign.\n\nEmery is said to be furious with Koscielny's refusal to go to the USA\n\nGiven that head coach Unai Emery was happy with Koscielny's performance in 2018-19 and already faces other issues in central defence, the view was that he could only go if a bid landed that reflected his value and importance to Arsenal.\n\nKoscielny argues that Arsenal are reneging on an agreement that would allow him exit as a free agent during the current transfer window, something the Gunners strenuously deny.\n\nHe is also thinks Arsenal have - or will receive - an \"acceptable\" offer, but some privy to the proposal admit that \"acceptable\" is subjective and others insist there is nothing on table.\n\nWhen Koscielny told Emery in a face-to-face meeting on Wednesday morning that he would not be joining the team on their pre-season tour to the USA, the Spaniard was furious.\n\nArsenal's head of football Raul Sanllehi later sent Koscielny a message expressing bitter disappointment and warning the player that not travelling would be in breach of contract.\n\nKoscielny replied emphasising his stance and on arrival at Arsenal's London Colney training ground on Thursday morning the captain confirmed he would not be boarding the flight.\n\nHe will be required to train alongside the players who are not on the America trip - mainly youngsters - with disciplinary proceedings under way to determine his punishment.\n\nArsenal officials are fuming about the situation, which from a sporting perspective gives them a headache in central defence - an area they were already looking to strengthen this window.\n\nThey were thought to be close to completing the 30m euros signing of William Saliba from Saint-Etienne, with plans to loan the 18-year-old back to the Ligue 1 side for the entirety of next season.\n\nBut in a dramatic twist on Friday, Tottenham reignited their interest in Saliba and were pushing hard to complete the transfer from under the noses of Arsenal.\n\nMeanwhile, Rob Holding is recovering from a knee injury and there are concerns over the development and readiness of Konstantinos Mavropanos to provide a credible option.\n\nArsenal are keen to sell Shkodran Mustafi but the German is under contract until 2021 and has no desire to depart."}]}
