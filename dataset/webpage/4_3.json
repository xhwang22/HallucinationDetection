Who needs them, the detractors said, when you've got four majors and The Players?\n\nGolf in the Olympics? Ditto.\n\nThe FedEx Cup? What was wrong with the money list to determine the best players?\n\nThe First Tee? Don't we have PGA professionals to teach and grow the game?\n\nFinchem said there's only one thing to do in those situations.\n\n\"If you're in a leadership position, you do the research, involve the best and brightest from your staff and you set the goals,\" said the 74-year-old Finchem, who retired from the PGA Tour at the end of the 2016 season, following 22 years as the commissioner. \"If you've done your homework, proceeded correctly and made the right calls, they will have an impact.\"\n\nHOF MC:David Feherty will preside over World Golf Hall of Fame ceremony as Tiger Woods to be inducted\n\nGallery:World Golf Hall of Fame opens exhibit honoring Tiger Woods, Tim Finchem, Susie Maxwell Berning, Marion Hollins\n\n'He's the reason we're out here:' Tiger Woods' career takes center stage for World Golf Hall of Fame ceremony\n\nAnd Finchem, the son of a career Marine officer who built a legal and political career before getting involved in golf, will be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame on Wednesday at the PGA Tour's Global Home because of the impact he made on multiple fronts.\n\nFinchem will join Tiger Woods, Susie Maxwell Berning and the late Marion Hollins in the induction ceremony, which will be held at 7 p.m. and aired by Golf Channel. He also joins his predecessor, Deane Beman, in going from Tour commissioner to the Hall of Fame.\n\nA player on the Tour's policy board famously told Finchem that Beman had left him with a high-powered luxury car when he retired in 1994.\n\n\"All you need to do is keep it filled with high-test,\" the player said.\n\nFinchem did more than that. Under his direction, the Tour's total purses jumped from less than $60 million per year in 1994 to more than $250 million by 2006. The World Golf Championships and the FedEx Cup playoffs ensured the best players in the world would be on the same golf course the same week more often. And he took further steps to enhance The Players Championship, renovating the course in 2006, building the new clubhouse and bumping the purse to keep it the most lucrative in golf.\n\nThere are even critics of the success the Tour had under Finchem. Tiger Woods, they say, should get the bulk of the credit after he burst on the scene and went on to win 15 majors, two Players and 82 Tour titles, transforming the game of golf into a more athletic pursuit open to anyone of any race or background who could shoot the scores.\n\nFinchem will never deny that Woods being the game's top player for 20 of his 22 years as the commissioner was a huge factor, especially on the three new TV deals that were negotiated on Finchem's watch.\n\nBut Finchem had the foresight and business acumen to take advantage of Woods' dominance, such as involving Woods and his father Earl heavily in the launching of The First Tee, the World Golf Foundation's initiative to make golf more accessible and affordable to youth in at-risk areas and situations.\n\nThe First Tee is celebrating its 25th year with 150 worldwide chapters, 10,000 schools in its program to make golf part of a P.E. curriculum and more than 3 million kids reached per year through golf and its Life Skills and educational programs.\n\n\"There's no question about his impact,\" Finchem said of Woods. \"And there's no question that going forward, Tiger will have even more of an impact if he wants to be involved and show leadership more than he already has. His presence in anything related to golf is incredibly strong.\"\n\nFinchem was asked jokingly two years ago what the sport would have looked like had Woods played tennis.\n\n\u201cIt would have been a much more difficult job,\u201d he admitted.\n\nFinchem expanded the international reach of the Tour through the WGC events, the Presidents Cup, developmental tours in China, South American and Canada, taking Tour events to Mexico, Japan, Korea and China, and finally throwing the weight of the Tour and the World Golf Foundation behind the drive to return golf to the Olympics.\n\nFinchem said the secret to success is never admitting that you\u2019ve been as successful as you\u2019re going to get.\n\n\"You always ask yourself, 'is there a better way for this to work?'\" Finchem said. \"Asking that question has resulted in hard work at organizing and working together with various organizations in golf and our international activity in golf. The more we focused on that, the more we learned, and the more we learned the more effective we were.\"\n\nFinchem, who graduated from the University of Richmond in 1969 (he had a debate scholarship) and got his law degree from Virginia, had a practice in Virginia Beach and got involved in local politics, moving quickly to the national scene when he worked President Jimmy Carter's campaign in 1976, then served on President Carter's Office of Economic Affairs.\n\nFinchem was later the national campaign chairman for Walter Mondale when he ran against Ronald Reagan in 1980.\n\nHe started at the PGA Tour as the vice-president of business affairs and quickly climbed the ladder to be Beman's successor, serving as chief operating officer of the Tour and then deputy commissioner.\n\n\"He was the right guy at the right time,\" Beman said. \"He was always there to back up and do the things that needed to be done. He was a good administrator and understood the legal issues ... very adept at analyzing everything from every side.\"\n\nMonahan said Tiger Woods provided the punch. Finchem maximized it.\n\n\"Tim Finchem's vision and leadership have made an indelible impact on the game of golf over the past 25 years,\" Monahan said when it was announced in March of 2020 that Finchem would enter the Hall of Fame."}, {"url": "https://www.sportsbroadcastinghalloffame.org/inductees/tim-finchem/", "page_content": "When Tim Finchem retired in 2017 after 22 years as PGA TOUR commissioner, he had transformed the game and its relationship with fans on the course, watching on TV, watching on portable devices, and, yes, the computer at the office for the diehards who want to watch golf play from sunrise to sunset.\n\nHe introduced the FedEx Cup Playoffs, offering the sport a greater sense of an actual season. The Presidents Cup gave the sport another great international competition. And the World Golf Championships created greater opportunities for international golfers to compete together beyond the majors. And the 1997 rights deal he negotiated changed the relationship between TV and golf forever as it required every round of every tournament be carried on TV.\n\n\u201cThe most impressive thing about Tim is he was a remarkable consensus builder,\u201d says Sean McManus, CBS Sports, chairman. \u201cHis relationships with the players, with the tournaments, with the sponsors, and TV networks were all first rate where everyone felt like they were getting full value.\u201d\n\nHe also spearheaded efforts to coordinate the bid for golf\u2019s return to the Olympics, which became a reality in the 2016 Games after a 112-year absence and gave NBC a chance to bring one of its most important rest-of-the-year properties to its Olympic programming schedule.\n\n\u201cTim Finchem super-charged the PGA TOUR during his tenure as commissioner by adding World Golf Championships, the Presidents Cup, and the FedEx Playoffs,\u201d says Molly Solomon, executive producer/president, NBC Olympics Production, and executive producer, Golf Channel. \u201cWhat the PGA TOUR looks like today is due in large part to his big ideas and creative leadership.\u201d\n\nAdds Tommy Roy, NBC Sports, lead golf producer, credits Finchem with allowing NBC to have more than a dozen cameras on the island green for THE PLAYERS Championship, allowing the network to capture shots from almost any angle.\n\n\u201cHe gave us the ability to put a camera six feet away from Tiger Woods when he was about to execute a magical, game winning shot,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd he also gave us the ability to put microphones three feet away from Phil Mickelson and [caddie] Bones when they were discussing the execution of a great shot.\u201d\n\nSports Broadcasting Hall of Famer Dick Ebersol says he was lucky enough to have a front row seat to Finchem\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cTim built the PGA Tour into one of the most important franchises in all of American TV sports,\u201d he adds.\n\nAs if that weren\u2019t enough, he helped oversee First Tee\u2019s growth into a great youth-development organization, reaching more than 15 million youngsters (during his tenure as commissioner, the PGA TOUR and its tournaments raised more than $2 billion in charitable contributions).\n\n\u201cTim Finchem\u2019s vision and leadership have made an indelible impact on the game of golf over the past 25 years,\u201d said Jay Monahan, PGA TOUR commissioner and World Golf Foundation board chairman, when Finchem was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame last year. \u201cHis enshrinement in the World Golf Hall of Fame will forever stand as a testament to his tireless dedication and contributions, but, more important, so will the countless lives \u2014 whether those are the players on the PGA TOUR and beyond, millions of First Tee participants, or charitable organizations around the world \u2014 impacted by his life\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nFinchem became commissioner in 1994 when then-Commissioner Deane Beman, just 55 years old, retired to resume his playing career, this time as a member of the then-Senior PGA TOUR.\n\n\u201cMy history is one of just being in the right place at the right time,\u201d says Finchem. \u201cSo much of where you\u2019re headed is based on the individuals that you\u2019re interfacing with.\u201d\n\nFor example, prior to joining the PGA TOUR, Finchem was in the Jimmy Carter Administration, working with the president and his staff.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a great run with regard to being around people who are extremely successful and thoughtful and committed to making this place a better place to live,\u201d he says. \u201cI look back at all those people I met and the players that I interfaced with, and I was very, very fortunate to be in the right place at the right time.\u201d One example: he became commissioner only a few weeks before a player named Tiger Woods turned professional.\n\nAnd the beginning of the Woods era and the beginning of Finchem\u2019s tenure as commissioner coincided with a time when some of the greats of the game had retired but were still an active part of the PGA efforts.\n\n\u201cI was lucky,\u201d Finchem says, \u201cbecause I came into the PGA TOUR at a time when I had the opportunity to meet Sam Snead and Byron Nelson and all these great players and spend a fair amount of time with them. In some ways, many of those players were similar to working with the president because of their knowledge of the sport, their intensity about transferring that information to fans and to people like myself.\u201d\n\nFinchem always had a passion for golf and freely admits to using his paper-route money to support his golf habit.\n\n\u201cMy dad was in the Marine Corps for 30 years, and I started playing golf when I was 8 or 10,\u201d he says. \u201cHe took me to the Azalea Open in North Carolina; Arnold Palmer won, and I was mesmerized by him. Years later, I\u2019d call him up from time to time and say, Take me through one of your wins. He\u2019d say, Which one? and I\u2019d tell him that one.\u201d\n\nAlthough nearly half his adult life has been spent at the PGA TOUR, Finchem didn\u2019t set out to work in sports administration. He attended the University of Richmond on a debate scholarship and graduated in 1969, then received his law degree from Virginia four years later. After practicing law in Virginia Beach for three years, Finchem served in the Carter White House as deputy advisor to the president in the Office of Economic Affairs in 1978 and 1979.\n\n\u201cTim\u2019s leadership was invaluable for the growth of the game,\u201d says Sports Broadcasting Hall of Famer and CBS Sports Lead Play-by-Play Announcer Jim Nantz. \u201cHis thoughtful decision-making helped the PGA TOUR soar to incredible heights. He led his global partners in promoting and implementing a World Golf Championship series, and, here at home, he brought life to the PGA TOUR\u2019s end of the season. Lastly, Tim saw the value of nurturing and respecting his television relationships. He has been viewed by all as a great partner.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://news.richmond.edu/releases/article/-/16374/former-pga-tour-commissioner-and-ur-alum-tim-finchem-receives-honorary-degree-during-his-50th-reunion-weekend-trustee-emeritus-has-served-as-golfs-guiding-force.html", "page_content": "He came to the University of Richmond on a debate scholarship, but golf was his main interest and for 20 years Tim Finchem, a 1969 graduate of the University of Richmond, was the PGA Tour\u2019s guiding force serving as its commissioner.\n\nDuring this year\u2019s Reunion Weekend an honorary degree, Doctor of Humane Letters, honoris causa, will be conferred on Finchem during the President\u2019s Breakfast and Alumni Awards Presentation at the Queally Center from 9-11 a.m. on June 1.

We are proud to count him among our most distinguished alumni and to recognize his many accomplishments and contributions.\u201d\n\nFinchem\u2019s love of golf began as an 8-year-old following his father around the golf course at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek in Norfolk, Virginia. After college and political positions, he returned to the game that hooked him at an early age.\n\nHe moved to Florida with his family and began working at the PGA Tour as chief operating officer. Five years later in 1994, he became commissioner. He tended to the public image of the game and managed the logistics of tournament infrastructure.\n\nDuring his two decades with the PGA Tour he charted a creative strategy for growth through the Great Recession, the rise and fall of Tiger Woods, and a boom in golf\u2019s mainstream popularity.\n\nThe Tour saw unprecedented television contracts, massive increases in prize money, and the establishment of signature new initiatives. The widening market base led to the creation of more golf stars, which led to a stronger fan base.\n\nUnder Finchem\u2019s leadership, the Tour also became a charitable powerhouse. Each year PGA Charities gives millions of dollars to more than 3,000 charities. One of Finchem\u2019s achievements as commissioner was the establishment of the First Tee, an organization whose mission is to \u201cimpact the lives of young people by providing educational programs that build character, instill life-enhancing values, and promote healthy choices through the game of golf.\u201d\n\nBefore he served as the PGA Tour commissioner, Finchem served as a deputy advisor to President Carter in the Office of Economic Affairs before working on President Carter\u2019s re-election campaign.

At the induction ceremony of the World Golf Hall of Fame 2022, Finchem took the further step to enhance the Players Championship events, building a new clubhouse, and renovating the course in 2006.\n\nEarly Life\n\nTim was born on 19th April 1947 in Ottawa, Illinois, and is currently living in his late 50s. He went to the Princess Anne High School, Virginia, where he received his primary education. Later, he went to receive his secondary education from the University of Richmond, receiving a bachelor of arts in 1969. Finchem received his degree of law from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1973. He had a paper route and used to perform other off jobs.\n\nRather than spending his money on purchasing candy and other small toys, Finchem was interested since childhood to play golf. So he used to spend his money only on playing golf. Finchem was brought by Harold (father) who was a career marine and used to permit his 8 years old young child to play golf with his buddies. Finchem is one of the oldest sons born in a family of six children, including three boys and three girls.\n\nTim Finchem Career\n\nBefore coming into the field of gold administration, Tim Finchem had pursued a great career in the line of law and practice.
