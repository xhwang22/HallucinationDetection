The central issue was the country\u2019s money supply. An economic depression had begun in 1893, and public opinion\u2014and even the Democratic Party\u2014was split between those who favoured the gold standard and those who favoured free silver, a type of currency inflation, to help alleviate the depression. Most Republicans, as well as Democratic supporters of Pres. Grover Cleveland, were in favour of the gold standard. Southern and western Democrats and Populists (also known as the People\u2019s Party)\u2014many of them farmers who were suffering financially\u2014vied for free silver, which ultimately helped bring those two parties together.\n\nBritannica Quiz U.S. Presidential History Quiz\n\nIn June at the Republican national convention in St. Louis, Missouri, former Ohio congressman and governor William McKinley, who was popular in his party for his moderate views on gold and silver, easily won the Republican presidential nomination. Garret A. Hobart of New Jersey was chosen as his running mate after Thomas Reed, who had vied for the presidential ticket, rejected the vice presidential nomination.\n\nAt their convention in Chicago the following month, the Democrats chose magnetic orator and former Nebraska congressman William Jennings Bryan. Although he was only 36 years of age, Bryan\u2019s famous \u201cCross of Gold\u201d speech (July 8), given in closing debate on the party platform and in favour of including a plank endorsing free silver, so electrified the convention that he was nominated for president, winning on the fifth ballot. His solution for the depressed economy was an \u201ceasy money\u201d policy based on the unlimited coinage of silver at a ratio to gold of 16 to 1. On that platform he also received the nominations of the Populist and National Silver parties. Arthur Sewall, an executive from Maine, was chosen as the Democrats\u2019 vice presidential candidate. The Populists, trying to preserve their party as separate from the Democrats, nominated Thomas E. Watson as their vice presidential candidate."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/event/United-States-presidential-election-of-1912", "page_content": "The rise of the Republican \u201cinsurgents\u201d\n\nTheodore Roosevelt first came to the presidency in 1901, following the assassination of William McKinley, but won election in his own right in 1904 and proved a very popular chief executive. Shortly after the election of 1904, he announced that he would not be a candidate four years later\u2014though he was so much the idol of the masses that he could easily have gained the Republican nomination in 1908. Adhering stubbornly to his pledge, he arranged the nomination of his secretary of war, William Howard Taft, who was easily elected president in 1908.\n\nBritannica Quiz All-American History Quiz\n\nTaft faced a restless public and a split Republican Party. National progressivism was nearly at high tide, and a large group of Republican progressives, called \u201cinsurgents,\u201d sat in both houses of Congress. These Republicans, like a majority of Americans, demanded such reforms as tariff reductions, an income tax, the direct election of senators, and even stricter railroad and corporation regulations. Taft, who thought of himself as a progressive, was more conservative philosophically and lacked the qualities of a dynamic popular leader. His troubles began when he called Congress into special session in 1909 to take up tariff reform. When the measure that emerged from Congress increased rates, Republican insurgents and a majority of Americans were outraged, but Taft signed the bill and called it the best tariff law the Republicans had ever enacted. Conflicts and misunderstandings over conservation and legislative procedure caused the rift between Taft Republicans and the insurgents to grow. By 1910 the Republican insurgents were clearly in the ascendancy in Congress. Taking control of the president\u2019s railroad-regulation measure, they added new provisions that greatly increased the Interstate Commerce Commission\u2019s authority. The following year they bitterly opposed Taft\u2019s measure for tariff reciprocity with Canada; it passed with Democratic support in Congress, only to go down to defeat at the hands of the Canadian electorate.\n\nRepublican insurgents were determined to prevent Taft\u2019s renomination in 1912. They found their leader in Roosevelt, who had become increasingly alienated from Taft and who made a whirlwind campaign for the presidential nomination in the winter and spring of 1912. Roosevelt swept the presidential primaries, even in Taft\u2019s home state of Ohio. But Taft and conservative Republicans controlled the powerful state organizations and the Republican National Committee, and when the Republicans gathered at their national convention in Chicago in June 1912 it proved a bitter, divisive affair. Taft, Roosevelt, and Wisconsin Sen. Robert M. La Follette, a leading reformer, sought the nomination, but so complete were Taft\u2019s supporters\u2019 control over the party machinery that delegate challenges made by Roosevelt were all beaten back\u2014leading Roosevelt to refuse to have his name entered into nomination. In the event, Taft was nominated on the first ballot, and Vice Pres. James S. Sherman was easily renominated. Convinced that the bosses had stolen the nomination from him, Roosevelt led his followers out of the Republican convention. In August they organized the Progressive (\u201cBull Moose\u201d) Party and named Roosevelt to lead the third-party cause. Hiram Johnson, the reform Republican governor of California, became Roosevelt\u2019s running mate.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democrats had swept the 1910 congressional and gubernatorial elections, and after the disruption of the Republican Party in the spring of 1912 it was obvious that almost any passable Democrat could win the presidency in that year. Meeting in Baltimore, Maryland, a week after the Republican convention, the Democrats had a number of candidates contesting the nomination, including speaker of the House Champ Clark and former president of Princeton University Woodrow Wilson, who had a progressive record as governor of New Jersey. Ultimately, Wilson secured the Democratic nomination on the 46th ballot, and Thomas R. Marshall was chosen as his running mate."}, {"url": "https://www.historyonthenet.com/election-1896-william-mckinley-r-v-william-jennings-bryan-d", "page_content": "Loading...\n\nThe election of 1896 is seen as the beginning of a new era in American politics, or a \u201crealignment\u201d election. Ever since the election of 1800, American presidential contests had, on some level, been a referendum on whether the country should be governed by agrarian interests (rural indebted farmers\u2013the countryside\u2013\u201cmain street\u201d) or industrial interests (business\u2013the city\u2013\u201cwall street\u201d). This was the last election in which a candidate tried to win the White House with mostly agrarian votes.\n\nAlthough there were several important issues in the 1896 election, the nominating process was dominated by the fallout of the country\u2019s monetary policy, an issue that had been at the forefront of American politics for decades, but had come to a head during Grover Cleveland\u2019s second administration. The economic depression of 1893 and the Democratic Party\u2019s response to the crisis had resulted in major Republican gains in the House in the 1894 midterms, as well as heightened prospects for 1896. Cleveland had achieved his goals, but in doing so had also split the Democratic Party over fiscal policy. Some Democrats agreed with Cleveland\u2019s support of the gold standard. These conservative Democrats became known as \u201cgold bugs\u201d. More rural, populist Democrats believed that inflation was the key to raising prices and easing the debt of the farmers. They advocated \u201cfree silver\u201d\u2013the unlimited coinage of silver at a ratio of 16 to 1 against gold coins. These populist \u201csilverites\u201d had made significant gains within the Democratic Party in the 1894 midterm elections, despite overall party losses. 1894 would turn out to be the peak of the populist influence, though that would only become clear in retrospect. In the presidential election year of 1896, the split set up a fascinating political election season.\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nBimetallism and Coin\u2019s Financial School (1894)\n\nThe \u201cfree silver\u201d campaign was aided in large part by the publication in 1894 and 1895 of a booklet called, Coin\u2019s Financial School. Through the educational teachings of fictional Professor Coin, the booklet extolled the sound financial decisions made by the founders, when in 1792 Congress fixed the monetary unit of one dollar at 371.25 grains of silver. Gold was also made money, but its value was pegged to the silver dollar at a ratio of 15 to 1, and then 16 to 1. Although this was called bimetallism, it was actually a silver standard. Silver fixed the unit and the value of the gold was regulated by it. This was wise, according to Coin, because silver was scattered among the people, and one person could not so easily injure the economy by monopolizing the metal as he could with gold. Professor Coin further explains such concepts as credit money (paper, coins, etc.), all of which were redeemable in redemption or \u201cprimary\u201d money (gold, silver) to which a stable value had been given. A greenback system could also be employed, as long as the amount of money in circulation was\n\nlimited per capita so that it could be redeemed at any given time and confidence in the government\u2019s ability to do so could be maintained. But then, Congress perpetuated what Professor Coin called \u201cThe Crime of 1873.\u201d It repealed the unit clause of 1872 and replaced the language with this:\n\nThat the gold coins of the United States shall be a one-dollar piece which at the standard weight of twenty-five and eight-tenths grains shall be the unit of value.\n\nThe right to free silver was denied, and silver was no longer legal tender in the payment of debts over $5. With this law, the supply of primary money was cut in half. Because there was a very limited gold supply, all property declined in value in comparison to gold (or gold increased dramatically in value and buying power). Borrowing became the only way to pay outstanding debts, even as falling prices continued because there was not enough real money behind the credit money. Mounting debts and mortgages had created the panic of 1893.\n\nAnd there were international implications. The United States had followed England\u2019s example of 1816 by abandoning silver, but many other nations quickly followed America. As the demand for gold increased, so did its purchasing power, and prices declined. And all of this, according to Professor Coin, had been arranged by London. Having cornered the gold market, the British wanted America\u2019s large Civil War debt to by paid in gold. The U.S. was paying England $200 million annually in gold just for the interest on the nation\u2019s debt, but in doing so were sacrificing $400 million in property that was required to secure the $200 million in gold, mostly at the expense of the farmer. Written by William Hope Harvey, Coin\u2019s Financial School sold hundreds of millions of copies, and perpetuated the belief that America\u2019s economic hard times was the result of a national and international conspiracy against silver.\n\nThe National Republican Convention, St. Louis, June 16-18\n\nFollowing a series of successful election cycles and a split in the Democratic Party, Republicans had good reason to be excited about their prospects for retaking the White House in 1896. With former President Benjamin Harrison and Ohio Senator John Sherman declining to run, the main candidates seeking the nomination were Speaker of the House Thomas B. Reed of Maine, Senator William Allison of Iowa, and Governor William McKinley of Ohio. William McKinley was the overwhelming favorite, another in a series of Republican candidates who came from Ohio, reflecting the growing political clout of the American Midwest. He was a congressman and then governor of the state, and even had a distinguished Civil War record, which was still a political asset more than three decades after the war had ended. McKinley had a friendly demeanor, was a devout Methodist, and was motivated by a strong and sincere sense of morality.One of the most powerful political themes of the late-nineteenth century Republican Party was American nationalism. For some Republicans, nationalism was best expressed by continuing to push the moral high ground of the Civil War era, or to raise fears about Papists (Catholics) or immigrants, or the social calamities caused by alcohol consumption.\n\nMcKinley, however, was able to focus the Republican Party\u2019s nationalist creed on the need for protective tariffs. Though McKinley had suffered politically in the early \u201990s for this stance, by 1896 the Republican Party was ready to present itself as standing behind the farmer, the rising middle class, and the Protestant industrial worker through high taxes on foreign imports. McKinley had also skillfully avoided the money question. This would turn out to be an important asset in an election where the opposition focused almost entirely on the issue.\n\nTo run his campaign, McKinley allied himself with Mark Hanna, an Ohio industrialist with middle class origins who had become quite wealthy as a shipper and broker serving the iron and coal industries. Hanna, who was fascinated more by politics than profits, transitioned to running campaigns for prominent Ohio candidates. He had unsuccessfully backed Senator John Sherman for the Republican nomination at the\n\n1888 convention, but did help McKinley win two terms as governor. Earlier in the year, Hanna had shrewdly sized up both Sherman and McKinley, and had concluded that McKinley would be the better candidate. Hanna\u2019s convention strategy had been to win the nomination by promising patronage to powerful political bosses like Thomas Platt of New York and Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania, but McKinley vetoed the strategy in favor of the slogan, \u201cThe People Against The Bosses.\u201d By the time the convention began, McKinley was already the clear favorite, and he won on the first ballot. Garret Hobart, a businessman and state politician from New Jersey, was nominated for vice president in the hopes that he would help his party carry his home state for the first time since 1872.\n\nThe Republican Party platform adopted at the convention was extremely critical of President Cleveland and congressional Democrats, blaming them for all of the economic woes, and for damaging the image of America abroad. A high protective tariff was emphasized, in conjunction with reciprocal trade agreements with other nations. Other foreign policy positions included support for the annexation of Hawaii, and the creation of a transoceanic canal through Nicaragua, controlled by the United States. Additionally, the platform expressed sympathy for Armenians suffering under Turkish repression, and for Cuban freedom fighters struggling against the Spanish. On the domestic front, Republicans supported pensions for Union veterans and economic opportunities for women (without mentioning suffrage), and opposed anti-Black activities in the South. As for the money questions, the Republicans supported the gold standard and explicitly rejected free silver unless it were allowed under international agreement, which was extremely unlikely. The platform\u2019s monetary policy did cause the walkout of 21 free silver delegates, but otherwise was universally supported.\n\nThe National Democratic Convention, Chicago, July 7-10\n\nFollowing the depression of 1893 and significant losses in the presidential midterms as well as state and local elections in 1895, the Democratic Party had split. In early 1895, Congressman Richard Bland of Missouri and William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska, a former congressman (1891-1894), led the revolt against President Cleveland. They argued that Cleveland\u2019s economic policies did not represent the party\u2019s mainstream support of free silver. Bryan promoted a statement signed by 31 House Democrats urging Democrats to become the party of free silver. That summer, Bryan conducted a successful speaking tour in the Midwest and South. He attacked the \u201cmoney power\u201d in Washington and called for new party leadership. Silver Democrats attempted to take control of the party\u2019s national organization, but Bryan worked alone to build a national free silver coalition of Democrats, Republicans, and Populists.\n\nThe country entered the 1896 political season with Cleveland barely able to maintain control of his party. In the spring of 1896, free silver Democrats won control of many of the state delegations to the national convention, but Democrats arrived at their convention in Chicago without a clear choice for the nomination. Congressman Richard P. Bland of Missouri was a leading candidate, but Populists were hoping for a more free silver candidate, and they were opposed to his wife\u2019s Catholicism. Former Congressman William Jennings Bryan had taken advantage of the attention his work the previous year had earned him, and began writing delegates for support that spring. Although some delegates from the West and the South intended to vote for him, a pre-convention poll just two days before the convention\u2019s opening ranked him last among seven candidates. On July 7, the convention opened with silverites establishing clear control. They eliminated two candidates and adopted a free silver plank that had been written by Bryan.\n\nOf the remaining men, Bryan maneuvered to be the last to speak in the platform debate on July 9. He claimed to speak in defense of a cause as holy as the cause of liberty the cause of humanity. Bryan blamed the gold standard for impoverishing Americans, and identified agriculture as the foundation of American wealth. He called for reform of the monetary system, an end to the gold standard, and promised government relief efforts for farmers and others hurt by the economic depression. Bryan ended his rousing oration with religious imagery:\n\nHaving behind us the producing masses of this nation and the world, supported by the commercial interests, the laboring interests and the toilers everywhere, we will answer their demand for a gold standard by saying to them: You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.\n\nThe convention was momentarily stunned, but then broke into celebratory pandemonium. The speech, forever after known as the \u201cCross of Gold\u201d speech, had been so dramatic that after he had finished many delegates carried him on their shoulders around the convention hall. Voting began the next morning, on July 10. Congressman Bland led on the first three ballots, but could not garner the requisite two-thirds majority. Each time, Bryan gained in strength. He took the lead on the fourth ballot, and finally won the nomination on the fifth. The next day Arthur Sewall was nominated as Vice President. It was hoped that the inclusion of the pro-protectionist, free silver shipbuilder and banker from Maine would appease the business community who were nervous about Jennings, and that the wealthy running mate would contribute financially to the campaign. At age 36, Bryan became the youngest candidate ever nominated for the presidency of the United States. Some Democrats broke with the mainstream party. Some in the Northeast privately and even publicly supported the Republican ticket, while some in the Midwest formed their own party, the National Democratic Party. In early September, the breakaway faction convened in Indianapolis, where they nominated Senator John Palmer of Illinois for president and Simon Bolivar Buckner, a former Confederate general and governor of Kentucky (1887-1891), for vice president.\n\nThe National Populist Party Convention, St. Louis, July 24-26\n\nThe Populist Party grew out of the agrarian discontent of the 1890s, especially in the South and West of the Mississippi River. It grew out of the Farmers\u2019 Alliance, whose main goal since 1876 had been to achieve economic reform in railroad and brokerage rates. By 1896, following the Panic of 1893, the party had become almost exclusively identified with the free silver movement. The inclusion of Populist positions in the Democratic Party\u2019s platform caused a split in the Populist Party. Some Populists, called \u201cfusionists,\u201d wanted to join the Democrats. The more radical \u201cmid-roaders\u201d wanted to remain a separate organization and pursue a larger agenda. At their convention in St. Louis, the Populists passed a wide-ranging reform platform and then nominated Bryan for president. The mid-roaders started an anti-Bryan protest, but it was cut short when the lights were turned on. They did succeed in opposing Bryan\u2019s running mate on the Democratic ticket, Arthur Sewall (he was seen as too anti-labor), and instead nominated Thomas E. Watson, a former Populist congressman from Georgia. Watson refused to campaign for Bryan.\n\nThe Democratic Campaign\n\nThroughout the history of the United States, it had been tradition that presidential candidates did not actively campaign for their election. Some had made brief speaking engagements, but it was considered undignified for a candidate to actively campaign on his own behalf. Instead, party loyalists made the pilgrimage to the candidate\u2019s house, where they camped out on the front lawn, hoping for a glimpse of the candidate. Usually the candidate would give a mid-afternoon speech from his front porch, giving name to the \u201cfront porch campaign.\u201d This tradition had begun to erode prior to 1896. James Blaine had spent six weeks campaigning. William Jennings Bryan became the first presidential candidate to spent nearly the entire campaign season on the campaign trail. He did so largely out of necessity, being outspent and out-organized by the Republicans. But Bryan was an impressive and effective speaker. By taking his message directly to the people in an age that still considered political speeches high entertainment, Bryan was able to personify the free silver cause with enormous energy, and keep the campaign focused on the monetary issue, rather than on the tariff, which Mark Hanna had assumed would be the main issue. Bryan traveled to twenty-seven states, but focused largely on the midwest, where he believed the deciding battleground to be. He traveled, by his own account, 17,909 miles and made nearly 600 speeches. Bryan even traveled through Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula in his four-day swing through the state from October 14-17. On the 15th, Bryan gave speeches to his largest crowds in Traverse City, Big Rapids,and Grand Rapids (3 speeches), but that was nothing compared to what he accomplished the next day. In his book The First Battle (1896), Bryan writes:\n\nFriday was one of the long days. In order that the reader may know how much work can be crowded into one campaign day, I will mention the places at which speeches were made between breakfast and bedtime: Muskegon, Holland, Fennville, Bangor, Hartford, Watervliet, Benton Harbor, Niles, Dowagiac, Decatur, Lawrence, Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, Marshall, Albion, Jackson (two speeches), Leslie, Mason, and Lansing (six speeches); total for the day, 25. It was near midnight when the last one was finished.\n\nBryan did touch on other planks from the Democratic platform, but it was the free coinage of silver that he pushed most. Bryan argued that agriculture was the backbone of society, that it was absolutely essential for it to be healthy in order for the industrial centers of the country to also prosper. The Democrats wanted the inflation that would result from the silver standard. They believed higher inflation would make it easier for farmers and other debtors to pay off their debts by increasing their revenue dollars. It would also reverse the deflation which the U.S. experienced from 1873-1896, a period historians now refer to as the Long Depression (it was called The Great Depression until 1929). Bryan also argued that free silver would provide more money for industrial expansion and job creation. At its core, the free silver agenda was an argument to redistribute wealth and power from the few to the many. Along the way, Bryan also sought the votes of the average working man. He condemned court-ordered injunctions against strikers, like the one employed by President Cleveland against the Pullman strikers, and he endorsed a progressive federal income tax. Unfortunately for Bryan, however, both of these positions were at odds with Supreme Court decisions handed down the previous session.\n\nBy October, newspapers that supported Bryan began to change tactics. They began to focus on the man they saw as holding McKinley\u2019s puppet strings\u2013Mark Hanna. For weeks, editorial cartoons savaged Hanna as a bloated plutocrat who had McKinley completely under his thumb.\n\nThe Republican Campaign\n\nBy contrast, William McKinley conducted a traditional \u201cfront porch campaign,\u201d receiving visitors at his home in Canton, Ohio. Behind the scenes, however, the Mark Hanna machine went into high gear. By charging the Democratic Party as supporting both Populist and Socialist agendas, such as government ownership of communication and transportation businesses, Hanna effectively frightened American businessmen into donating $3.5 million dollars to the campaign, five times more than Bryan raised. Hanna pumped the money into an effective propaganda machine. Evoking the attitudes of the time toward gimmicky quack medicine, Theodore Roosevelt said of Hanna\u2019s efforts, \u201cHe has advertised McKinley as if he were a patent medicine!\u201d Hanna also engineered a masterful response to Bryan\u2019s Cross of Gold Speech.\n\nThe Republicans combined the bimetallism issue with the tariff question and promised a return to prosperity, social order, and morality. They argued that inflation caused by free coinage of silver would create a \u201c53-cent dollar\u201d that would rob the workingman of his buying power. They also argued that uncontrollable inflation would put a burden on creditors, such as banks, whose loans\u2019 interest rates would then fall lower than the inflation rate and garner a loss for the creditor. Hanna also sent nearly 1500 speakers on the campaign trail to attack Bryan, most notably Theodore Roosevelt, who denounced Bryan as a dangerous radical.\n\nHanna flooded the country with an estimated 250 million pieces of campaign literature (published in various languages) so that at times each American home was receiving pro-McKinley material on a weekly basis. The culmination of the campaign was a decree, issued by Hanna, that November 2 would be designated Flag Day for Republicans, who were expected to \u201cassemble in the cities, villages, and hamlets nearest their homes and show their patriotism, devotion to country and the flag, and their intention to support the party which stands for protection, sound money, and good government.\u201d [New York Times, October 27, 1896, page 2]. The suggestion was that McKinley was only true choice for patriotic Americans.\n\nThe Decision\n\nOn November 3, 1896, 14 million American voted. McKinley won with 276 electoral votes to Bryan\u2019s 176, and by a popular vote margin of 51% to Bryan\u2019s 47%. Bryan did well in the South and the West, but lacked appeal with unmortgaged farmers and especially the eastern urban laborer, who saw no personal interest in higher inflation. Hanna\u2019s \u201cMcKinley and the Full Dinner Pail\u201d slogan had been more convincing. McKinley won in part by successfully forging a new coalition with business, professionals, skilled factory workers and prosperous (unmortgaged) farmers. By repudiating the pro-business wing of their party, the Democrats had set the stage for 16 consecutive years of Republican control of the White House, interrupted only in 1912 when a split in the Republican Party aided the election of Woodrow Wilson.\n\nOnce in office, McKinley followed through on his proposed economic policy, carefully moving the country toward the gold standard while establishing a protective trade policy. By 1898, renewed economic prosperity would be threatened by the greatest foreign policy crisis since the War of 1812, a war with Spain."}, {"url": "https://millercenter.org/president/cleveland/essays/stevenson-1893-vicepresident", "page_content": "Adlai Ewing Stevenson was a well-liked and respected politician renowned for his political moderation and instinctive desire for compromise. These skills led him to the top of national politics, where he eventually served as the 23rd vice president of the United States.\n\nStevenson was born in Christian Country, Kentucky, on October 23, 1835, to Eliza Ann Ewing Stevenson and John Turner Stevenson, a tobacco farmer. In 1852, a major frost killed the family's tobacco crop, which prompted the family to move to Bloomington, Illinois. In Bloomington, a young Adlai worked in his father's sawmill and taught school in order to earn money to attend college. He eventually enrolled in the Presbyterian-run Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, where he met his future wife, Letitia Green. He later attended Illinois Wesleyan University. Upon the death of his father in 1857, Stevenson returned to Bloomington where he studied law and was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1858. During the Civil War, he served as the master in chancery of Woodford County's circuit court and organized the 108th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Infantry. Following the war, he served a four-year term from 1865 to 1869 as prosecuting attorney for the 23rd judicial district. He then opened a successful law practice with his cousin, James Ewing. In 1866, Stevenson married Letitia Green after a lengthy courtship.\n\nAlthough Stevenson had dabbled in politics - he campaigned for Stephen Douglas in his 1858 Senate race against Abraham Lincoln and served as a presidential elector during the 1864 election - his political career did not begin in earnest until 1874, when he defeated a Republican incumbent to become one of Illinois's few Democratic representatives to the House of Representatives. Stevenson served one term, but was defeated in 1876 by a Republican challenger who capitalized on the failing economy and the state's traditional status as a Republican stronghold. However, Stevenson ran again for the House seat in 1878 and won, serving until 1881.\n\nIn 1885, newly-elected President Grover Cleveland appointed Stevenson to be the first assistant postmaster general. The appointment was considered an honor, and Stevenson relished the opportunity to control a large portion of the spoils system. During his four-year tenure as assistant postmaster general, Stevenson replaced more than 40,000 Republican postal employees with Democrats, earning himself the nickname, \"Headsman.\" After his term was completed, he returned to his law practice in Bloomington, Illinois. In 1892, the Democratic Party again nominated Grover Cleveland for President, and in a surprise to many observers (himself included), Adlai E. Stevenson was nominated as vice president.\n\nAs the vice presidential nominee, Stevenson provided needed balance to the ticket. His home state of Illinois was considered important to Cleveland's election hopes, and Stevenson's popularity there was seen as an asset. Additionally, Stevenson's views on currency reform contrasted favorably with those of Cleveland, who endorsed the gold standard, and helped broaden the appeal of the ticket. Moreover, Stevenson was an energetic and popular campaigner; his work as assistant postmaster general had earned him many allies in the Democratic Party. Cleveland won the election that fall, and Stevenson was sworn in as vice president on March 3, 1893. Vice President Stevenson was both a fixture on the Washington social scene and an enthusiastic public servant. He regularly opened his offices to reporters and found a fair amount of pleasure in presiding over the Senate. In a notable occasion, he unknowingly almost became President of the United States when President Cleveland underwent surgery to remove a malignant growth from the roof of this mouth. Cleveland was eager not to cause panic on Wall Street with the prospect of a \"soft money\" proponent ascending to the presidency and had the operation performed in secret on a yacht in New York. Even members of the cabinet, including Stevenson, were largely unaware of the severity of Cleveland's health problem. The operation was a success, and the details of it were not made public until 1917. As vice president, Stevenson traveled the country often. In the wake of the 1894 midterm elections in which the Democrats suffered heavy losses, he used this traveling as an opportunity to bridge the gap between the Eastern and Western factions of the Democratic Party. Although he was briefly considered as a possible presidential candidate in 1896, he received limited support and eventually endorsed Democratic candidate William Jennings Bryan, despite the reluctance of many Cleveland Democrats to do so. After leaving office, Stevenson had a brief respite from politics but reappeared as Bryan's running mate in the 1900 presidential election. Despite campaigning vigorously, the pair lost to the Republican ticket of William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nAfter the defeat in 1900, Stevenson returned to private practice in Bloomington, Illinois, where he worked quietly until 1908, when he made an unsuccessful run for governor of Illinois. Following his loss, he finally retired from politics, living the quiet life of an elder statesman until his death on June 14, 1914. His grandson, Adlai E. Stevenson II, served as governor of Illinois and was nominated as the Democratic candidate for President in 1952 and 1956, losing both times to Dwight Eisenhower. His great-grandson, Adlai E. Stevenson III, served as a senator for Illinois, twice ran for governor, and was himself considered a contender for the vice presidential nomination in 1976."}, {"url": "https://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/william-mckinley", "page_content": "In 1898, McKinley led the nation into war with Spain over the issue of Cuban independence; the brief and decisive conflict ended with the U.S. in possession of Puerto Rico, the Philippines and Guam. In general, McKinley\u2019s bold foreign policy opened the doors for the United States to play an increasingly active role in world affairs. Re-elected in 1900, McKinley was assassinated by an anarchist in Buffalo, New York, in September 1901.\n\nWilliam McKinley served in the U.S. Congress and as governor of Ohio before running for the presidency in 1896. As a longtime champion of protective tariffs, the Republican McKinley ran on a platform of promoting American prosperity and won a landslide victory over Democrat William Jennings Bryan to become the 25th president of the United States.\n\nEarly Life and Career\n\nWilliam McKinley was born on January 29, 1843, in Niles, Ohio. As a young man, he briefly attended Allegheny College before taking a post as a country schoolteacher.\n\nWhen the Civil War broke out in 1861, McKinley enlisted in the Union Army, where he eventually earned the rank of brevet major of volunteers. Returning to Ohio after the war, McKinley studied law, opened his own practice in Canton, Ohio, and married Ida Saxton, the daughter of a local banker.\n\nAfter the deaths, in quick succession, of her mother and her two young daughters early in their marriage, Ida\u2019s health rapidly deteriorated, and she spent the rest of her life as a chronic invalid. McKinley patiently catered to his wife throughout his burgeoning political career, winning praise from the public for his loving devotion to her.\n\nDid you know? During the Civil War, McKinley served on the staff of Colonel Rutherford B. Hayes, a fellow Ohioan who would become his lifelong mentor and friend. His ties to Hayes helped McKinley rise through Ohio's political ranks and win election to Congress in 1876, the same year Hayes was elected as the nation's 19th president.\n\nMcKinley entered Ohio politics in 1869 and rose through the ranks of the Republican Party, winning election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1876. Over nearly 14 years in Congress, he served as chair of the House Ways and Means Committee and became known as a proponent of economic protectionism, in the form of high tariffs on imported goods.\n\nAfter a tariff measure bearing his name passed in 1890, voters rejected McKinley and other Republicans due to rising consumer prices, and he returned to Ohio. The following year, he ran for governor, winning by a narrow margin; he would serve two terms in that post.\n\nPresident William McKinley\n\nAfter the so-called Panic of 1893 led to a crippling economic depression in the United States, McKinley and his fellow Republicans regained the political advantage over the Democrats.\n\nMcKinley won the Republican presidential nomination in 1896 thanks to his congressional and gubernatorial experience, his longtime support of protectionism and the skilled maneuvering of his chief supporter, the wealthy Ohio industrialist Marcus Alonzo Hanna.\n\nIn the general election, McKinley faced William Jennings Bryan, who ran on a platform attacking the gold standard and supporting the coinage of silver as well as gold. Touted by Hanna as the \u201cadvance agent of prosperity\u201d and the protector of America\u2019s financial interests in contrast to Bryan\u2019s radical policies, McKinley won the popular vote by a margin of some 600,000, the largest victory in 25 years; he also won more electoral votes than Bryan.\n\nDomestic Agenda\n\nSoon after taking office, McKinley called a special session of Congress in order to raise customs duties, an effort he believed would reduce other taxes and encourage the growth of domestic industry and employment for American workers. The result was the Dingley Tariff Act (sponsored by the Maine congressman Nelson Dingley), the highest protective tariff in American history.\n\nMcKinley\u2019s support for the Dingley Tariff strengthened his position with organized labor, while his generally business-friendly administration allowed industrial combinations or \u201ctrusts\u201d to develop at an unprecedented rate.\n\nSpanish-American War\n\nIt was foreign affairs that would determine McKinley\u2019s presidential legacy, beginning with an ongoing conflict in Cuba, where Spanish forces were attempting to repress a revolutionary movement. Though the American press and public were outraged by the bloodshed, McKinley hoped to avoid intervention and pressed Spain to make concessions.\n\nAfter the U.S. battleship Maine exploded in Havana\u2019s harbor in February 1898, McKinley asked Congress for the authority to intervene in the conflict; a formal declaration of war came on April 25. The Spanish-American War lasted from early May to mid-August, until U.S. forces defeated Spain near Santiago harbor in Cuba, occupied Puerto Rico and seized Manila in the Philippines.\n\nThe Treaty of Paris, signed in December 1898 and narrowly ratified by Congress the following February, officially ended the Spanish-American War. In it, Spain ceded Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines to the United States and Cuba gained its independence.\n\nWhile opponents of the treaty derided it as \u201cimperialist,\u201d McKinley took his cue from the majority of Americans who supported it, sending troops to quell a nationalist insurgency that broke out in the Philippines shortly after the war ended.\n\nMcKinley\u2019s administration also pursued an influential \u201cOpen Door\u201d policy aimed as supporting American commercial interests in China and ensuring a strong U.S. position in world markets. In 1900, McKinley backed up this policy by sending American troops to help put down the Boxer Rebellion, a nationalist uprising against foreign intervention in China.\n\nReelection in 1900\n\nIn 1900, McKinley again faced William Jennings Bryan, who ran on an anti-imperialism platform, and was re-elected with an even greater margin of victory than he obtained four years earlier. The outcome reflected the American public\u2019s satisfaction with the outcome of the Spanish-American War and the country\u2019s economic prosperity.\n\nAfter his second inauguration in March 1901, McKinley embarked on a tour of western states, where he was greeted by cheering crowds. The tour ended in Buffalo, New York, where he gave a speech on September 5 in front of 50,000 people at the Pan-American Exposition.\n\nAssassination\n\nAt the Pan-American Exposition, McKinley was standing in a receiving line when an unemployed Detroit mill worker named Leon Czolgosz shot McKinley twice in the chest at point-blank range. Czolgosz, an anarchist, later admitted to the shooting and claimed to have killed the president because he was the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d He was executed in October 1901.\n\nRushed to a Buffalo hospital, McKinley initially received a hopeful prognosis, but gangrene set in around his wounds and he died eight days later. Vice President Theodore Roosevelt succeeded him."}, {"url": "https://study.com/learn/lesson/william-jennings-bryan-biography-scopes-trial-who-was-william-jennings-bryan.html", "page_content": "Randy has a Master of Divinity from Mercer University, a Bachelor of Science in Human Services with extensive coursework in Business and Psychology, from Mercer University, and has completed Master level coursework in Motion Media Design at Savannah College of Art and Design in Atlanta with additional coursework at School of Motion.\n\nWho Was William Jennings Bryan?\n\nWilliam Jennings Bryan (1860-1925) was an American lawyer and politician who was well known for his powerful oratory skills. He was an influential voice in the Democratic Party, serving in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1891-1895, receiving the Democratic nomination for president three times (1896, 1900, and 1908), and serving as Secretary of State (1913-1915) under President Woodrow Wilson. In addition, Bryan was an editorial writer and lecturer both before and after his brief stint as Secretary of State. Bryan is also well known for his role as prosecuting attorney in the infamous Scopes Monkey Trial (1925).\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nWho was William Jennings Bryan? Born in Salem, Illinois, on March 19, 1860, Bryan was the fourth of nine children born to Silas and Mariah Bryan. His three younger siblings died in infancy, and one of his younger siblings died prior to reaching adulthood. Bryan's father, Silas was an attorney and elected state circuit judge whose work would influence Bryan's later decision to become an attorney.\n\nWilliam Jennings Bryan was home-schooled during his early educational years. He attended Whipple Academy, a private school, for his high school years, followed by Illinois College then Union College of Law in Chicago. In 1883, Bryan was admitted to the Illinois State Bar and practiced law for several years before relocating to Nebraska.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boyhood home of William Jennings Bryan played a prominent role in his early life and education, as he was homeschooled until he was about ten years old.\n\n\n\n\n\nWas William Jennings Bryan a Populist?\n\nIn 1884, just after his admission to the State Bar, Bryan married Mary Elizabeth Baird, whom he met while attending Illinois College. Bryan continued to practice law in Illinois until he and his wife relocated to Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1887. It was there Bryan set up a new legal practice and established himself as an effective orator and political personality.\n\nBryan was a Democrat, but his appeal was associated with the various causes espoused by the Populist Party. These causes included such things as tariff reductions, silver coinage, direct election of U.S. Senators, and a national income tax. The Populist Party was a third U.S. political party whose greatest relevance was during the 1890s. The party's appeal was primarily to farmers, small businesses, and common laborers in the Midwestern, Western, and Southern states around the time of the Panic of 1893 and the ensuing economic depression. Bryan was such a staunch and effective supporter of these groups that he became known as \"The Great Commoner.\"\n\nIn 1890, Bryan was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat representing Nebraska's First District. He was re-elected and served two consecutive terms from March 4, 1891-March 3, 1895. In 1894, he declined to run again for his House seat and instead ran for the U.S. Senate. He was defeated and returned home to Nebraska. There, he served a brief stint as editor for the Omaha World-Herald while giving public lectures on the merits of silver coinage and building a grassroots coalition for the cause. Just two years later, Bryan secured the opportunity to address the 1896 Democratic National Convention in a move that would alter his political trajectory.\n\nWilliam Jennings Bryan: The Cross of Gold Speech\n\nThe Democratic National Convention was held in the summer of 1896 in Chicago several weeks after the Republican National Convention in St. Louis. At the young age of 36, William Jennings Bryan electrified the convention crowd with his Cross of Gold speech and secured the party's nomination to run for president over two-term incumbent President Grover Cleveland.\n\nThe Cross of Gold speech addressed the issue of the coinage of silver and gold. This was a hotbed issue that was addressed at both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions of 1896. The Republican platform favored keeping the gold standard as the backing for U.S. currency but left open the possibility for the free coinage of silver. The Democratic platform adopted free coinage of both silver and gold in unlimited capacities. Bryan's speech argued against the merits of gold being the only legitimate backing for currency and argued for the coinage of silver in addition to gold. Bryan's speech was aptly named the Cross of Gold speech in a nod to his closing words:\n\n\"If they dare to come out in the open field and defend the gold standard as a good thing, we shall fight them to the uttermost, having behind us the producing masses of the nation and the world. Having behind us the commercial interests and the laboring interests and all the toiling masses, we shall answer their demands for a gold standard by saying to them, you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns. You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA cartoon depicting William Jennings Bryans Cross of Gold Speech given at the 1896 Democratic National Convention. The speech fired up the audience and secured him the Democratic nomination for president.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat did William Jennings Bryan do after delivering such persuasive political oratory? With this speech, Bryan secured the Democratic nomination for president, with Arthur Sewall as his running mate. Bryan's name also appeared on the Populist Party ticket as the nominee for president, with Thomas E. Watson as his running mate. Bryan (and his two running mates) lost the election to Republican William McKinley and his running mate Garret Hobart. Bryan lost the electoral vote by a margin of 271-176 and the popular vote by a margin of 51%-46%. Nevertheless, Bryan carried 22 states to McKinley's 23."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-McKinley", "page_content": "William McKinley , (born January 29, 1843, Niles , Ohio , U.S.\u2014died September 14, 1901, Buffalo , New York), 25th president of the United States (1897\u20131901). Under McKinley\u2019s leadership, the United States went to war against Spain in 1898 and thereby acquired a global empire, which included Puerto Rico , Guam , and the Philippines .\n\nMcKinley was the son of William McKinley, a manager of a charcoal furnace and a small-scale iron founder, and Nancy Allison. Eighteen years old at the start of the Civil War , McKinley enlisted in an Ohio regiment under the command of Rutherford B. Hayes , later the 19th president of the United States (1877\u201381). Promoted second lieutenant for his bravery in the Battle of Antietam (1862), he was discharged a brevet major in 1865. Returning to Ohio, he studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1867, and opened a law office in Canton , where he resided\u2014except for his years in Washington, D.C.\u2014for the rest of his life.\n\nHis loss in 1890 brought an end to McKinley\u2019s career in the House of Representatives, but, with the help of wealthy Ohio industrialist Mark Hanna , McKinley won two terms as governor of his home state (1892\u201396). During those years Hanna, a powerful figure in the Republican Party, laid plans to gain the party\u2019s presidential nomination for his good friend in 1896. McKinley went on to win the nomination easily.\n\nThe issue with which McKinley became most closely identified during his congressional years was the protective tariff, a high tax on imported goods which served to protect American manufacturers from foreign competition. While it was only natural for a Republican from a rapidly industrializing state to favour protection, McKinley\u2019s support reflected more than his party\u2019s pro-business bias. A genuinely compassionate man, McKinley cared about the well-being of American workers, and he always insisted that a high tariff was necessary to assuring high wages. As chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, he was the principal sponsor of the McKinley Tariff of 1890, which raised duties higher than they had been at any previous time. Yet by the end of his presidency McKinley had become a convert to commercial reciprocity among nations, recognizing that Americans must buy products from other countries in order to sustain the sale of American goods abroad.\n\nDrawn immediately to politics in the Republican Party , McKinley supported Hayes for governor in 1867 and Ulysses S. Grant for president in 1868. The following year he was elected prosecuting attorney for Stark county, and in 1877 he began his long career in Congress as representative from Ohio\u2019s 17th district. McKinley served in the House of Representatives until 1891, failing reelection only twice\u2014in 1882, when he was temporarily unseated in an extremely close election, and in 1890, when Democrats gerrymandered his district.\n\nPresidency\n\nThe presidential campaign of 1896 was one of the most exciting in American history. The central issue was the nation\u2019s money supply. McKinley ran on a Republican platform emphasizing maintenance of the gold standard, while his opponent\u2014William Jennings Bryan, candidate of both the Democratic and Populist parties\u2014called for a bimetallic standard of gold and silver. Bryan campaigned vigorously, traveling thousands of miles and delivering hundreds of speeches in support of an inflated currency that would help poor farmers and other debtors. McKinley remained at home in Canton, greeting visiting delegations of Republicans at his front porch and giving carefully prepared speeches promoting the benefits of a gold-backed currency. For his part, Hanna tapped big businesses for enormous campaign contributions while simultaneously directing a network of Republican speakers who portrayed Bryan as a dangerous radical and McKinley as \u201cthe advance agent of prosperity.\u201d McKinley won the election decisively, becoming the first president to achieve a popular majority since 1872 and bettering Bryan 271 to 176 in the electoral vote.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

On July 24 he signed into law the Dingley Tariff, the highest protective tariff in American history to that time. Yet domestic issues would play only a minor role in the McKinley presidency. Emerging from decades of isolationism in the 1890s, Americans had already shown signs of wanting to play a more assertive role on the world stage. Under McKinley, the United States became an empire.\n\nBy the time McKinley took the oath of office as president, many Americans\u2014influenced greatly by the sensationalistic yellow journalism of the Hearst and Pulitzer newspapers\u2014were eager to see the United States intervene in Cuba, where Spain was engaged in brutal repression of an independence movement. Initially, McKinley hoped to avoid American involvement, but in February 1898 two events stiffened his resolve to confront the Spanish. First, a letter written by the Spanish minister to Washington, Enrique Dupuy de L\u00f4me, was intercepted, and on February 9 it was published in American newspapers; the letter described McKinley as weak and too eager for public adulation. Then, six days after the appearance of the Dupuy de L\u00f4me letter, the American battleship USS Maine suddenly exploded and sank as it sat anchored in Havana harbour, carrying 266 enlisted men and officers to their deaths. Although a mid-20th century investigation proved conclusively that the Maine was destroyed by an internal explosion, the yellow press convinced Americans of Spanish responsibility. The public clamoured for armed intervention, and congressional leaders were eager to satisfy the public demand for action.\n\nIn March McKinley gave Spain an ultimatum, including demands for an end to the brutality inflicted upon Cubans and the start of negotiations leading toward independence for the island. Spain agreed to most of McKinley\u2019s demands but balked at giving up its last major New World colony. On April 20 Congress authorized the president to use armed force to secure the independence of Cuba, and five days later it passed a formal declaration of war.\n\nIn the brief Spanish-American War\u2014\u201ca splendid little war,\u201d in the words of Secretary of State John Hay\u2014the United States easily defeated Spanish forces in the Philippines, Cuba, and Puerto Rico. Combat began early in May and ended with an armistice in mid-August. The subsequent Treaty of Paris, signed in December 1898 and ratified by the Senate in February 1899, ceded Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States; Cuba became independent. The ratification vote was extremely close\u2014just one vote more than the required two-thirds\u2014reflecting opposition by many \u201canti-imperialists\u201d to the United States acquiring overseas possessions, especially without the consent of the people who lived in them. Although McKinley had not entered the war for territorial aggrandizement, he sided with the \u201cimperialists\u201d in supporting ratification, convinced that the United States had an obligation to assume responsibility for \u201cthe welfare of an alien people.\u201d\n\nThis desire to care for the less fortunate was characteristic of McKinley and was nowhere better illustrated than in his marriage. McKinley married Ida Saxton (Ida McKinley) in 1871. Within two years, the future first lady witnessed the deaths of her mother and two daughters. She never recovered, and she spent the rest of her life as a chronic invalid, frequently suffering seizures and placing an enormous physical and emotional burden on her husband. Yet McKinley remained devoted to her, and his unflagging attentiveness earned him additional admiration from the public.\n\nRenominated for another term without opposition, McKinley again faced Democrat William Jennings Bryan in the presidential election of 1900. McKinley\u2019s margins of victory in both the popular and electoral votes were greater than they were four years before, no doubt reflecting satisfaction with the outcome of the war and with the widespread prosperity that the country enjoyed.\n\nFollowing his inauguration in 1901, McKinley left Washington for a tour of the western states, to be concluded with a speech at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. Cheering crowds throughout the journey attested to McKinley\u2019s immense popularity. More than 50,000 admirers attended his exposition speech, in which the leader who had been so closely identified with protectionism now sounded the call for commercial reciprocity among nations:\n\nBy sensible trade arrangements which will not interrupt our home production, we shall extend the outlets for our increasing surplus. A system which provides a mutual exchange of commodities is manifestly essential to the continued and healthful growth of our export trade. We must not repose in fancied security that we can forever sell everything and buy little or nothing. If such a thing were possible, it would not be best for us or for those with whom we deal. We should take from our customers such of their products as we can use without harm to our industries and labor.\n\nThe following day, September 6, 1901, while McKinley was shaking hands with a crowd of well-wishers at the exposition, Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist, fired two shots into the president\u2019s chest and abdomen. Rushed to a hospital in Buffalo, McKinley lingered for a week before dying in the early morning hours of September 14. He was succeeded by his vice president, the man Mark Hanna sneeringly referred to as \u201cthat damned cowboy,\u201d Theodore Roosevelt."}, {"url": "https://www.worldhistoryedu.com/william-mckinley-7-major-accomplishments/", "page_content": "Here are 7 examples of President William McKinley\u2019s greatest accomplishments, which includes how he led the nation to a quick and decisive victory against Spain during the Spanish-American War (1898).\n\nThe article also explores how the pro-business and industrial initiatives of the McKinley Administration helped lift the nation out of a depression, transforming America into a real global super power, militarily and economically.\n\nFast Facts about William McKinley\n\nBorn: January 29, 1843 in Niles, Ohio, U.S.\n\nDeath: September 14, 1901 at Buffalo, New York, U.S.\n\nFather: William McKinley Sr.\n\nMother: Nancy Allison\n\nSpouse: Ida Saxton (married in 1871)\n\nChildren: 2 \u2013 Katherine (1871) and Ida (born 1873)\n\nTraining and Apprenticeship: Lawyer\n\nEducation: Allegheny College, Mount Union College, and Albany Law School\n\nPolitical Party: Republican Party\n\nElected Public Offices: 25th President of the United States (1897-1901); 39th Governor of Ohio (1892-1896); Member of the U.S. Congress (1877 \u2013 1884 and 1885-1891)\n\nPresidency: March 4, 1897 to September 14, 1901\n\nPredecessor: Grover Cleveland\n\nSuccessor: Theodore Roosevelt\n\nMost known for: McKinley Tariff of 1890; Leading the U.S. to victory during the Spanish-American War (April 21-December 10, 1898); Annexing Hawaii\n\nMajor Accomplishments of William McKinley\n\nMcKinley was the last US President to serve in the American Civil War\n\nBorn in 1843 at a place called Niles (in Ohio), William McKinley had the honor of fighting for the Union Army in the American Civil War (1861-1865). Driven by the ideals of freedom and civil liberties, the future 25th president of the United States enlisted as a private in Poland Guards in June 1861. He ultimately attained the rank of brevet major by the close of the war.\n\nHis service in the Union Army was a distinguished one, serving bravely under Rutherford B. Hayes (later 19th POTUS) command in the Civil War. McKinley even holds the record of being the last US President to serve in the American Civil War.\n\nWilliam McKinley made a name for himself practicing law\n\nWith the Civil War over in 1865, McKinley directed his focus to studying law, securing an admission to the bar in Ohio in 1867. He then moved to Canton, Ohio, where he established his law practice.\n\nIn 1868, William McKinley was elected prosecuting attorney in Stark County. It was also around this time that he married (in January, 1871) Ida Saxton, a well-educated woman from a well-to-do family in Canton.\n\nIn 1876, McKinley took on a pro bono case to defend a group of coal miners accused of rioting. He showed the nation just how good a lawyer he was by getting all but one of the defendants acquitted. Shortly after, labor unions and American workers came to have a strong liking for William McKinley \u2013 something that would later help in his political career.\n\nHe was an influential member of Congress for 14 years\n\nAt just 34, McKinley got elected to Congress, representing Ohio\u2019s 17th congressional district. He was massively supported by labor and other mine workers.\n\nBy so doing he defeated Levi L. Lamborn of the Democratic Party. McKinley was sworn into office in October 1877. The young politician quickly positioned himself as an expert in tariffs and trade.\n\nHis captivating character allowed him to push for protective tariffs to protect businesses at home from excessive foreign competition. Owing to his dedication in the House, he was picked chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, a position which further increased his influence on Capitol Hill.\n\nSponsored the McKinley Tariff of 1890\n\nHis crowning achievement came in 1890, when the McKinley Tariff of 1890 was passed by Congress. The bill, which was named after McKinley, was championed by McKinley with the goal of placing tariffs on imported goods into the country.\n\nOwing to the influence that McKinley wielded on Capitol Hill, the Democrats had one goal only when they took back control of the House; conscious efforts were made to get William McKinley out of the House.\n\nIn 1882, the Ohio-born politician was effectively gerrymandered out of the House by the Democrats. However, he made a comeback in 1884 and went on to serve five more years in Congress before losing to John G. Warwick by 300 votes.\n\nTwo-time Governor of Ohio\n\nDetermined to get his political career ticking again, McKinley turned his attention to the governor\u2019s seat in Ohio. He easily secured the Republican Party\u2019s nomination and went on to defeat incumbent Democratic governor James E. Campbell. McKinley\u2019s road to victory in 1891 was largely supported by funds raised by long-time friend and ally Mark Hanna.\n\nAs governor, McKinley worked very hard to resolve labor disputes. He also had the backs of workers\u2019 unions by protecting them from the excessiveness of employers. As a result, he strolled into an easy re-election in 1893.\n\nBecame the 25th President of the United States\n\nWith largely two very successful terms as governor of Ohio, McKinley shifted his attention to the national election.\n\nStarting around 1888, McKinley and his political ally Hanna began strategizing for a Republican Party nomination. Hanna devoted all his time and resources to see to it that McKinley had adequate funding for his presidential bid.\n\nMcKinley secured nomination at the Republican National Convention held in St. Louis on June 16, 1896. Garret Hobart of New Jersey was nominated as his running mate.\n\nHis campaign relied on him carrying himself as an agent of prosperity. Unlike his opponent, Democrat William Jennings Bryan, who crisscrossed the country campaigning, McKinley adopted a front porch campaign strategy. From the porch of his home in Canton, Ohio, he delivered speeches to over 700,000 people. This feat of his was made possible by the enormous campaign funds raised by Mark Hanna.\n\nRiding on campaign themes of using the gold standard to arrest the 1893 depression, McKinley defeated Jennings.\n\nWilliam McKinley was sworn into office on March 4, 1897 as the 25th President of the United States.\n\nHis first order of business in the White House was dealing with the economic recession. He called on Congress to enact high tariffs in order to protect local manufacturers and American workers.\n\nMarshaled the nation\u2019s troops to victory in the Spanish-American War\n\nInitially, the U.S. foreign policy was one of minimal interference in the affairs of neighboring countries. However, that all changed by 1897, when the general public sentiment in the nation swayed in favor of Cuba\u2019s independence from Spain.\n\nPresident McKinley, as well as large section of the public, had grown very frustrated of Spain\u2019s suppression and brutalities during the Cuban War of Independence. This culminated in the U.S. going to war against Spain in 1898.\n\nPrior to the break out of the Spanish-American War, the president made sure that he had exhausted all diplomatic channels to compel Spain to concede Cuban Independence. However, after the battleship USS Maine sunk, along with 266 American souls, at the harbor in Santiago, Cuba, the public and Congress wanted the U.S. to intervene; the latter even passed several resolutions that called on the president to intervene in Cuba.\n\nCongress declared war on Spain on 20th April, 1898; and so began the 100-day war against Spain.\n\nGuided by the values of humanitarianism, President McKinley led the United States to a decisive victory against Spain. The win reinforced America\u2019s military might and dominance in the world.\n\nAnd as part of the Peace Treaty of Paris in December 1898, Spain ceded control of the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico to the U.S.\n\nIt was also agreed that Cuba be given its independence. Although, there were a few anti-imperialist sentiments from leading Democrats and some small sections of the public, the decisive victory over Spain was a good thing for McKinley\u2019s political career.\n\nSimilarly, the annexation of the Republic of Hawaii, under the Newlands Resolution passed on July 8, 1898, was met with a lot of praise from the American public. His supporters showered praises on him for breathing life into America\u2019s Manifest Destiny \u2013 a principle with imperialist undertones.\n\nWilliam McKinley inspired economic growth and industrial boom\n\nUpon the urging of President William McKinley, Congress passed the Dingley Tariff in 1897. The tariff was designed to protect American manufacturers and factory workers from excessively competitive imported goods. It was the highest protective tariff until that time.\n\nThe president also urged Congress to pass the Gold Standard Act in 1900. That act, which he signed into law on March 14, 1990, was designed to keep the U.S. using the Gold Standard.\n\nAdditionally, McKinley\u2019s economic initiatives allowed the nation to recover swiftly from the 1893 depression. In his last few months in the White House, President McKinley adopted many trade policies that in the long run helped establish the U.S. as a formidable economic power house on the global stage.\n\nOwing to all that, he, supported by running mate Theodore Roosevelt, was easily re-elected in 1900, securing the largest victory since 1872.

McKinley\u2019s many difficult foreign policy decisions, especially his policy toward China and his handling of the Boxer Rebellion, coupled with his decision to go to war with Spain over Cuban independence, helped the United States literally enter the twentieth century as a force to be reckoned with on the world stage.\n\nRecently though, presidential historians have begun to take a friendlier, more thoughtful examination of his presidency.\n\nAt a Glance\n\nBiography\n\nWilliam McKinley was the 25th President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1897, until his assassination on September 14, 1901, after leading the nation to victory in the Spanish-American War and raising protective tariffs to promote American industry.\n\nAt the 1896 Republican Convention, in time of depression, the wealthy Cleveland businessman Marcus Alonzo Hanna ensured the nomination of his friend William McKinley as \u201cthe advance agent of prosperity.\u201d The Democrats, advocating the \u201cfree and unlimited coinage of both silver and gold\u201d\u2013which would have mildly inflated the currency\u2013nominated William Jennings Bryan.\n\nWhile Hanna used large contributions from eastern Republicans frightened by Bryan\u2019s views on silver, McKinley met delegations on his front porch in Canton, Ohio. He won by the largest majority of popular votes since 1872.\n\nBorn in Niles, Ohio, in 1843, McKinley briefly attended Allegheny College, and was teaching in a country school when the Civil War broke out. Enlisting as a private in the Union Army, he was mustered out at the end of the war as a brevet major of volunteers. He studied law, opened an office in Canton, Ohio, and married Ida Saxton, daughter of a local banker.\n\nAt 34, McKinley won a seat in Congress. His attractive personality, exemplary character, and quick intelligence enabled him to rise rapidly. He was appointed to the powerful Ways and Means Committee. Robert M. La Follette, Sr., who served with him, recalled that he generally \u201crepresented the newer view,\u201d and \u201con the great new questions .. was generally on the side of the public and against private interests.\u201d\n\nDuring his 14 years in the House, he became the leading Republican tariff expert, giving his name to the measure enacted in 1890. The next year he was elected Governor of Ohio, serving two terms.\n\nWhen McKinley became President, the depression of 1893 had almost run its course and with it the extreme agitation over silver. Deferring action on the money question, he called Congress into special session to enact the highest tariff in history.\n\nIn the friendly atmosphere of the McKinley Administration, industrial combinations developed at an unprecedented pace. Newspapers caricatured McKinley as a little boy led around by \u201cNursie\u201d Hanna, the representative of the trusts. However, McKinley was not dominated by Hanna; he condemned the trusts as \u201cdangerous conspiracies against the public good.\u201d\n\nNot prosperity, but foreign policy, dominated McKinley\u2019s Administration. Reporting the stalemate between Spanish forces and revolutionaries in Cuba, newspapers screamed that a quarter of the population was dead and the rest suffering acutely. Public indignation brought pressure upon the President for war. Unable to restrain Congress or the American people, McKinley delivered his message of neutral intervention in April 1898. Congress thereupon voted three resolutions tantamount to a declaration of war for the liberation and independence of Cuba.\n\nIn the 100-day war, the United States destroyed the Spanish fleet outside Santiago harbor in Cuba, seized Manila in the Philippines, and occupied Puerto Rico.\n\n\u201cUncle Joe\u201d Cannon, later Speaker of the House, once said that McKinley kept his ear so close to the ground that it was full of grasshoppers. When McKinley was undecided on what to do about Spanish possessions other than Cuba, he toured the country and detected an imperialist sentiment. Thus the United States annexed the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico.\n\nIn 1900, McKinley again campaigned against Bryan. While Bryan inveighed against imperialism, McKinley quietly stood for \u201cthe full dinner pail.\u201d\n\nHis second term, which had begun auspiciously, came to a tragic end in September 1901. He was standing in a receiving line at the Buffalo Pan-American Exposition when a deranged anarchist shot him twice. He died eight days later.\n\nIf you think you might be related to President McKinley visit our Ramsayer Research Library Page."}]}
