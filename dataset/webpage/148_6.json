{"William Allan Neilson transformed Smith College from a small, local institution into a major national university.": [{"url": "https://www.smith.edu/news/maya-lin-new-neilson-news-release", "page_content": "Now, as the redesigned library opens to members of the on-campus community, the new Neilson offers, McCartney says, \u201ca reenvisioning of a building that has been at the heart not just of our campus but also of the educational experiences of generations of students, staff and faculty.\n\n\u201cThis state-of-the-art library houses the new and the old: our archives and special collections, digital design studios, the Jill Ker Conway Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, and so much more,\u201c McCartney said. \u201cIt is a place of learning, connection, discovery and beauty\u2014a place that invites us to explore the world in all its wonder.\u201d\n\nArchitectural designer Maya Lin\u2019s re-imagined Neilson Library is an innovative, contemporary structure that presents a compelling vision for the modern library while respecting the building\u2019s historic significance.\n\nWith an emphasis on natural light, sustainable environmental design principles, and flexible interior space that can be used for a variety of purposes, Lin\u2019s design re-imagines the library as a space for collaboration and reflection. It also reconnects the college\u2019s science quadrangle with the campus\u2019 historic center, restoring integrity to Frederick Law Olmsted\u2019s 1893 campus plan.\n\nMaya Lin Studio developed the design in partnership with colleague William Bialosky and the firm of Shepley Bulfinch. Landscape architecture is by Lin with landscape designer Edwina von Gal (in collaboration with Ryan Associates).\n\nBegun in 2018, the five-story, 153,865 gross-square-foot project is Lin\u2019s first college library and one of the most significant capital projects in Smith College\u2019s history.\n\nIn an artist\u2019s statement, Lin says she envisioned the new Neilson as \u201ca dialogue between old and new.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy preserving the original, historic Neilson foundations and exterior, the new library retains the memory of the original structure. But completely rethinking and reconstructing the interior speaks to the needs of students today\u2014with more room for collaborating and socializing. And of course the book is still central to the space,\u201d Lin says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in Neilson, you\u2019ll know that you are in a house of books.\u201d\n\nThe new Neilson retains the original 1909 structure, including the venerable Neilson Browsing Room, but replaces the 1962 and 1982 additions with \u201cjewel box\u201d wings\u2014constructed of masonry, wood and glass\u2014that offer open, inviting, light-filled spaces designed to support research, teaching and learning in a variety of styles. Featuring gracious entryways on each side of the building, the new library draws people in from every direction.\n\nInside, books are abundant and visible. Visitors will also notice that all five floors are connected by an eye-catching central \u201coculus,\u201d an open core designed to capture and disseminate ethereal light throughout the space.\n\nTwo curved, \u201cjewel box\u201d wings (recently named for Smith presidents emeritae Ruth Simmons and Mary Maples Dunn) create comfortable space for reading (in the South wing) and socializing (in the North Wing). These striking, curved additions to the building\u2019s original 1909 core replace outmoded wings that divided the heart of Smith\u2019s campus, uniting Smith\u2019s historic quadrangle with its science quadrangle. \u201cThe two curved, organically shaped jewel boxes are a contrast to the original, orthogonal design, and speak to my aesthetic, which introduces a more hand drawn and organic shape,\u201d says Lin.\n\nThe primary purpose of Smith\u2019s library redesign was not to expand space for existing collections, which are among the strongest of any liberal arts college, but to think creatively and intentionally about what a forward-looking library should be, how it should function, and what scholarly and social goals it might serve.\n\nIn particular, Smith sought to develop a library that reflects and conveys the nature of a Smith education, which is global in scope and based on learning across disciplines.\n\nThe project cost for the new Neilson Library was $120 million, of which $42.8 million has been funded through philanthropy.\n\nReflecting the purpose of a contemporary library\n\nThe new Neilson places a premium on flexible space that blends traditional collections with new technologies and an intentional focus on collaborative learning.\n\nA \u201clearning hub\u201d for the campus\u2014offering classrooms, quiet study and reading rooms, as well as expanded space for collaboration, socializing and high-tech work\u2014the new Neilson features a Digital Media Hub with multimedia equipment and studio space for recording digital content; GIS and gaming labs; and a large, multifunctional Learning Commons where students can work with research librarians, instructional technologists and writing and quantitative learning specialists.\n\nThe Jill Ker Conway Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center, named for Smith\u2019s first woman president, is housed in a prominent place within the central core of the library, just to the left of the entrance from Seelye Lawn. Across from the Conway Center, the Neilson Browsing Room\u2014a longstanding and beloved home for readings, lectures and other events\u2014has been restored and updated.\n\nOn the top floor, the Skyline Reading Room provides large, open space for meetings, classes, events or individual study. A rooftop patio offers expansive views of the Holyoke Range.\n\nProvost and dean of the faculty Michael Thurston says, \u201cWhat\u2019s especially exciting to me is the way the shape and flow of spaces emphasize collaborative inquiry. It really emblematizes and enacts the ancient and vital identity of a library as the place where a community of scholars engages both the preserved thought of the past and the ongoing conversation that looks to renew and enrich our understanding.\u201d\n\nLeading in sustainability\n\nThe new Neilson is intentionally designed as one of the greenest, most energy-efficient libraries in the U.S., using 50 percent less energy than a typical library and contributing significantly to the college\u2019s goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2030. Maximizing the use of natural light through the central, light-catching \u201coculus\u201d and expansive windows (laced with an ultraviolet webbing pattern that prevents bird collisions), Smith\u2019s new Neilson Library unites the indoors and outdoors with an exterior courtyard and an outdoor amphitheater that can be used for performances and classroom instruction. Throughout, the structure emphasizes the use of locally sourced materials, including limestone.\n\nLin said, \u201cMy approach was to create a new, state-of-the-art, sustainable building that creates a dialogue with the historic Neilson and opens up and restores the Olmsted master plan, expanding the possibilities of the library while reducing the overall footprint of the building and restoring the heart of the campus.\u201d\n\nHistory of the project\n\nSmith\u2019s library redesign began in 2010, when the college engaged Shepley Bulfinch to partner on a master plan for all of the college\u2019s libraries. Soon after, the college worked with Shepley Bulfinch on several studies to assess what could feasibly be accomplished with current library space. In 2014, the trustees approved the concept of a redesign of Neilson and the hiring of an architect.\n\nMaya Lin and Shepley Bulfinch were hired in April 2015. They approached the Smith library redesign as a creative exploration and an active partnership with members of the Smith community. During the process, nearly 1,900 students, faculty, staff, alums and members of the Northampton community participated in more than 30 \u201cengagement sessions\u201d designed to help re-imagine Neilson for the 21st century.\n\nThe library\u2019s interior design reflects priorities identified during those sessions, including:\n\na strong desire for natural light\n\nflexible space that can easily be rearranged to suit a variety of teaching, learning and research purposes\n\na cafe where students can be \u201calone together,\u201d studying in solitude while surrounded by their peers\n\nstudy spaces, where students and faculty can work in solitude\n\na variety of spaces that support quiet reflection as well as task-oriented scholarship\n\nintegrated space for Smith\u2019s outstanding special collections\u2014one of the world\u2019s largest and best collections of materials related to women\u2019s history.\n\nNamed for Smith\u2019s third president, William Allan Neilson, Neilson Library serves as the sciences, social sciences and humanities library and includes the library administration offices. Neilson also is home to Smith\u2019s extraordinary Special Collections\u2014including the Smith College Archives, the Mortimer Rare Book Room, and the Sophia Smith Collection\u2014one of the world\u2019s largest and most important archives of women\u2019s history.\n\nAbout the Location\n\nBuilt in 1909 and expanded in 1962 and in 1982, Neilson Library holds pride of place on the Smith College campus, sitting between the science quad and the arts and humanities quad.\n\nWorking within Frederick Law Olmsted\u2019s 1939 plan for the Smith campus, Lin\u2019s design for the new Neilson eliminates the architectural barrier created by the previous building, unifying the campus and opening the view\u2014and the paths for travel\u2014from the Smith College Museum of Art to the science quad, and from Green Street to Chapin Lawn.\n\nThe new Neilson highlights significant improvements to the surrounding landscape, recalling Olmsted\u2019s original campus plan, which Lin describes as \u201cnot formal, but very organic. Our goal,\u201d Lin says, \u201cwas to restore the heart of the Smith Campus\u2014creating a landscape that welcomes you to sit, read and gather outside as well as bringing back the flow around the building.\u201d\n\nThe revised landscaping effectively reveals and incorporates the 16-foot elevation change between Neilson\u2019s east and west sides, and will also preserve several heritage trees that surround the original 1909 structure.\n\nAbout Maya Lin\n\nKnown for her large-scale environmental installations, memorials and architectural works, Maya Lin is an American artist, architectural designer and environmentalist whose many mould-breaking projects defy explicit categories. Always trying to find a balance between opposing forces, she says, \u201cMy work originates from a simple desire to make people aware of their surroundings.\u201d\n\nNature and the environment have long been central concerns for Lin, who attended Yale University, where she earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1981 and a Master of Architecture degree in 1986. Lin was thrust into the spotlight when, as a senior at Yale, she submitted the winning design in a national competition for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to be built in Washington, D.C. She has gone on to a remarkable career in both art and architecture, while still being committed to memory works that focus on some of the critical historical issues of our time.\n\nLin\u2019s art explores how we experience and relate to landscape, setting up a systematic ordering of the land that is tied to history, memory, time and language. Her interest in landscape has led to works influenced by topographies and geographic phenomena.\n\nHer architectural projects are largely undertaken at the request of non-profit institutions and include the newly renovated Neilson Library (2021) at Smith College, the Museum for Chinese in America (2009) in New York City, the Riggio-Lynch Interfaith Chapel (2004), the Langston Hughes Library (1999) in Clinton, Tennessee, and the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research: Cambridge Campus (2015).\n\nHer designs create a close dialogue between the landscape and built environment, and she is committed to advocating sustainable design solutions in all her works.\n\nIn 2009, Maya Lin started work on her last memorial, \u201cWhat is Missing?\u201d, an ongoing, multi-sited multimedia installation that raises awareness about habitat loss and biodiversity and emphasizes how protecting and restoring habitats can help protect species and significantly reduce climate change emissions.\n\nLin, who operates Maya Lin Studio in New York, has received many honors, among them the National Medal of Arts (2009) and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2016), both conferred by President Barack Obama, and the Gish Prize (2014). The film \u201cMaya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision\u201d won the 1994 Oscar for Best Documentary.\n\nAbout Julia Chang Lin, Class of 1951\n\nThe new Neilson\u2019s sunken courtyard is named for Maya Lin\u2019s mother, Julia Chang Lin, who led an extraordinary life.\n\nBorn in Shanghai in 1928, she grew up in a small coastal town in South China, attended private schools, and in 1947 enrolled at St. John\u2019s University in Shanghai.\n\nIn May 1949, on the same day that the Communists marched into Shanghai, Lin received a telegram from Smith, notifying her that she\u2019d been accepted as a transfer student and awarding her a $1,000 scholarship. The family housekeeper, Liu Ma, sewed the telegram and two $10 bills into the collars of Lin\u2019s Chinese dress. As the Nationalist government bombed the coast, Lin was smuggled to the United States on a fishing boat with her best friend. Detained for weeks on an island held by the Nationalists, Lin arrived at Smith one month after the semester had started, in October 1949.\n\nAfter graduating from Smith and earning graduate degrees from the University of Washington, Julia Chang Lin taught for nearly 30 years in the English Department at Ohio University, where she also helped establish the university\u2019s Chinese language courses. The author of four books, she was influential in bringing generations of Chinese women poets to a western audience. In 1999, Lin was one of 29 \u201cremarkable women\u201d honored by Smith for \u201cachievements representing the accomplishments of generations of Smith alumnae.\u201d\n\nJulia Chang Lin died of cancer in New York in 2013, at age 85. At the time of her death, she was writing an autobiography. The sunken courtyard at the center of the new Neilson has been named for Julia Chang Lin.\n\nAbout Smith: Founded in 1871, Smith College opened in 1875 with 14 students. Today, it is one of the largest women\u2019s liberal arts colleges in the United States, educating women of promise for lives of distinction and purpose. Smith enrolls 2,600 students from nearly every state and more than 50 other countries to cultivate leaders able to address the complex, urgent problems of today. As a community of scholars, entrepreneurs, scientists, activists and humanitarians, Smith is changing the world.

Shapiro (2005) emphasizes the need for the higher education institutions to serve a public purpose moving beyond narrow self-serving concerns, as well as to enforce social change in order to reflect the nature of a society that its members desire. More recently, in philosophical terms Barnett (2017, p 10) calls for a wider conceptual landscape in higher education where \u201cThe task of an adequate philosophy of higher education\u2026is not merely to understand the university or even to defend it but to change it\u201d.)\n\nThe purpose of education and its meaning in the contemporary western societies has been also criticised by Bo (2009), suggesting that education has become a contradictory notion that leaves no space for emancipation since it gives no opportunity for improvisation to students. Thus, the students feel encaged within the system instead of being liberated. Bo agrees with Mokyr, who highlighted the need for recalling the basic notions of education from ancient philosophies: that education should be integrated by both inculcation and emancipation in order to serve individual intellectual development as well as social progression (Mokyr, 2002; Bo, 2009).\n\nNot all individuals and societies agree on the purposes and roles of higher education in the modern world. However, in any case, it is a place where teaching and research can be accommodated in an organised fashion for the promotion of various types of knowledge, applied and non-applied. It is a place where money and moral values compete and collaborate simultaneously, where the development of labour market skills and competences coexist with the identification and utilisations of people\u2019s skills and talents as well as the pursuit of employment, morality and citizenship.\n\nThe post-WWII era has been characterised by the mass model of higher education. Before this, higher education was for those belonging to higher social classes (Brennan, 2004). This model became the kernel of educational policies in Europe and generally, in the western world (Shapiro, 2005). Such policies have been boosted by the advent of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), which enhance commercial and non-commercial bonds between countries and higher education institutions, transforming the role of higher education even further, making it rather universal (Jongbloed et al., 2008). Higher education\u2019s boundaries have become vague and the predefined \u201csocial contract\u201d between its institutions and those participated in them, is more complicated to be defined in absolute terms. Higher education institutions are now characterised by economic competition in a strict global market environment, where governments are not the key players anymore (Brennan, 2004).\n\nMoreover, student demographics in higher education are constantly changing. Higher education is now an industry operating in a global market. Competition to attract talents from around the world is growing rapidly as an increasing number of countries offer additional graduate and post graduate positions to non-nationals, usually at a higher cost compared to nationals (Barber et al., 2013). Countries such as China or Singapore that are growing economically very rapidly are investing huge amounts of money to develop their higher education system and make it more friendly to talented people from around the world. The advent of new technologies have changed the traditional model of higher education, where physical presence is not a necessary requirement anymore (Yuan et al., 2013). Studying while working is much easier and therefore more mature students have now the opportunity to study towards a graduate or post-graduate degree. All these developments have increased the potential for profit; however it also requires huge amount of money to be invested in new technologies and all kinds of infrastructures and resources. The need for diversification in funding sources is simply essential and therefore all other industries become inevitably more engaged (Kaiser et al., 2014). On top of all these, climate change, the rise of terrorism, the prolonged economic uncertainty and the automazation of labour will likely increase cross-national and intraoccupational mobility and therefore the demand for higher education, especially in the recipient countries of the economically developed western world will inevitably rise. Summing up, higher education institutions operate under a very fluid and unpredictable environment and therefore approaches that are informed by adaptability and flexibility are absolutely crucial. The hybrid approach we propose where instrumental and intrinsic values are reconciled is along these lines.\n\nModern views of higher education place its function under a digital knowledge-based society, where economy dominates. Labour markets demand for skills such as technological competence and complex problem-solving by critical thinking and multitasking, which increases competition and in turn, accelerates the pace of the working day (Westerheijden et al., 2007). Haigh and Clifford (2011) argue that high competency, in both hard and soft skills, is not enough, as higher education needs to go deeper into changing attitudes and behaviours becoming the core of a globalised knowledge-based-economy. However, the trends of transferring knowledge and skills by universities, which \u201cincreasingly instrumentalize, professionalize, vocationalize, corporatize, and ultimately technologize education\u201d (Thomson, 2001: 244), have been extensively criticised in epistemological as well as in ontological terms (Bourdieu, 1998; Dall\u2019 Alba and Barnacle, 2007). Livingstone (2009) argues that education and labour market have different philosophical departures and institutional principles to fulfill and therefore conceptualising them as concomitant economic events, with strong causal conjunctions, leads to logical fallacies. Livingstone sees the intrinsic purposes of education and contemporary labour market as rather contradictory than complimentary and any attempt to see them as the latter, leads to arbitrary and ambiguous outcomes, which in turn mislead rather than inform policy making. The current article, building on the arguments of Durst\u2019s (1999), Payne (1999) and Lu and Horner (2009) challenges this view introducing a \u201cbridging\u201d rationale between the two theories, which can be also actualized in practice and inform policy making.\n\nWhen education, and especially higher education, is considered as a public social right that everyone should have access to, human capital, as solely informed by the investment approach, cannot be seen as the most appropriate tool to explain the benefits an individual and society can gain from education. Citizenship can be regarded as one of these tools and perhaps concepts, such as the social and cultural capital or habitus, which contrary to human capital acknowledge that students are not engaged with education just to succeed high returns in the labour market but apart from the economic capital, should be of equal importance when we try to offer a better explanation of the individuals\u2019 drivers to undertake higher education. (Bourdieu, 1986; Coleman, 1988).Footnote 2 For example, Bourdieu (1984) thinks that certificates and diplomas are neither indications of academic or applied to the labour market knowledge, nor signals of competences but rather take the form of tacit criteria set by the ruling class to identify people from a particular social origin. Yet, Bourdieu does not disregard the human capital theory as invalid; however he remains very sceptical on its narrow social meaning as it becomes a property of ruling class and used as a mechanism to maintain their power and tacitly reproduce social inequalities.\n\nHigher education attainment cannot be examined irrespectively of someone\u2019s capabilities, as its conceptual framework presupposes a social construction of interacting and competing individuals, fulfilling a certain and, sometimes common to all, task each time. Capabilities, certainly, exist in and out of this context, as it includes both innate traits and acquired skills in a dynamic social environment. Sen (1993: 30) defines capability as \u201ca person\u2019s ability to do valuable acts or reach valuable states of being; [it] represents the alternative combinations of things a person is able to do or be\u201d. Moreover, Sen argues that capabilities should not be seen only as a means for succeeding a certain goal, but rather as an end itself (Sen, 1985; Saito, 2003; Walker and Unterhalter, 2007).\n\nCapabilities are a prerequisite of well-being and therefore, social institutions should direct people into fulfilling this aim in order to feel satisfied with their lives. However, since satisfaction is commonly understood as a subjective concept, it cannot be implied that equal levels of life satisfaction, as these perceived by people of different demographic and socio-economic characteristics, mean social and economic equality. Usually, the sense of life satisfaction is relative to future expectations, aspirations and past empirical experiences, informed by the socio-economic circumstances people live in (Saito, 2003).\n\nAccording to the capability approach, assessing the educational attainment of individuals or the quality of teachers and curriculum are not such useful tasks, if not complemented by the capacity of a learner to convert resources into capabilities. Sen\u2019s (1985, 1993) capability approach, challenges the human capital theory, which sees education as an ordinary investment undertaken by individuals. It also remains sceptical towards structuralist and post-structruralist approaches, which support the dominance of institutional settings and power over the individual acts. According to Sen (1985, 1993), educational outcomes, as these are measured by student enrolments, their performance on tests or their expected future income, are very poor indicators for evaluating the overall purpose of education, related to human well-being. Moreover, the capability approach does not imply that education can only enhance peoples\u2019 capabilities. It also implies that education, can be detrimental, imposing severe life-long disadvantages to individuals and societies, if delivered poorly (Unterhalter, 2003, 2005).\n\nFrom Sen\u2019s writings, it is not clear whether the capability approach imply a distinction between instrumental and intrinsic values. Even if someone attempts an interpretation of the capability approach by arguing that it is only means that have an instrumental value, whereas ends only an intrinsic one, it is still unclear how can we draw a line between means and ends in a rather objective way. Escaping from this rather dualistic interpretation, a common-sense argument seems apparent: Capabilities have both intrinsic and instrumental value. Material resources can be obtained through people\u2019s innate talents and acquired skills; however through the same resources transformed into capabilities a person who does not see this as an end but rather as a means, can also become a trusted member of the community and a good citizen, given that some kind of freedom of choice exists. Thus, resources apart from their instrumental value can also have an intrinsic one, with the caveat that the person chooses to conceive them as means towards a socially responsible end.\n\nThe American tradition in student development goes back to the liberal arts tradition, which main aim is to build a free person as an active member of a civic society. The essence of this tradition can be found in Nussbaum (1998: 8)\n\n\u201cWhen we ask about the relationship of a liberal education to citizenship, we are asking a question with a long history in the Western philosophical tradition. We are drawing on Socrates\u2019 concept of \u2018the examined life,\u2019 on Aristotle\u2019s notions of reflective citizenship, and above all on Greek and Roman Stoic notions of an education that is \u2018liberal\u2019 in that it liberates the mind from bondage of habit and custom, producing people who can function with sensitivity and alertness as citizens of the whole world.\u201d\n\nNowadays, liberal arts tradition is regarded as the delivery of interdisciplinary education across the social sciences but also beyond that, aiming to prepare students for the challenges they are facing both as professionals and as members of civic society. However, as Kozol notes in reality things are quite different (Kozol, 2005, 2012). Kozol devoted much of his work examining the social context of schools in the US by focusing on the interrelationships that exist, maintained or transformed between students, teachers and parents. He points out that segregation and local disparities in the US schools are continuously increasing. The US schools and especially urban schools are seen as distinctive examples of institutions where social discrimination propagates while the US educational system currently functions as a mechanism of reproducing social inequality. Kozol is very critical on the instrumental purpose of market-driven education as this places businesses and commerce as the \u201ckey players\u201d, since they shape the purpose, content and curriculum of education. At the same time, students, their parents as well as teachers, whose roles should have been essential, are displaced into some kind of token participants.\n\nHess (2004) might agree that US schools have become vehicles of increasing social inequalities but he suggest a very different to Kozol\u2019s approach. Since schools are social institutions that operate and constantly interact with the rest of economy they have to become accountable in the way that ordinary business are, at least when it comes to basic knowledge delivery. Hess insists that all schools across the US should be able to deliver high quality basic knowledge and literacy. Such knowledge can be easily standardised and a national curriculum, equal and identical to all US school can be designed. By this, all schools are able to deliver high quality basic knowledge and all pupils, irrespective of their social background, would be able to receive it. Then, each school, teacher and pupil are held accountable for their performance and failure to meet the national standards should result in schools closed down, teachers laid off and pupils change school environment or even lose their chance to graduate. Hess distinguishes between two types of reformers; the status quo reformers who do not challenge the state control education and the common-sense reformers who are in favour of a non-bureaucratic educational system, governed by market competition, subjected to accountability measures similar to those used in the ordinary business world.\n\nWhile Hess presents evidence that the problem in higher education is not underfunding but efficiency in spending, the argument he makes that schools can only reformed and flourish through the laws of market competition is not adequately backed up as there are plenty of examples in many industrial sectors, where the actual implementation of market competition instead of opening up opportunities for the more disadvantaged, has finally generated huge multinationals corporations, which operate in a rather monopolistic or at best oligopolistic environment, satisfying their own interests on the expense of the most deprived and disadvantaged members of the society. The ever growing increasing competition in the financial, pharmaceutical or IT software and hardware (Apple Microsoft, IOS and Android software etc.) sectors have not really helped the disadvantaged or the sector itself but rather created powerful \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d corporations that dominate the market if not own it.\n\nHess indeed believes that the US educational system apart from preparing students for the labour market has a social role to fulfil. When the purpose of higher education is solely labour market-oriented teaching and learning become inadequate to respond to the social needs of a well-functioned civic democracy, which requires active learners and critical thinkers who, apart from having a job and a profession, are able \u201cto frame and express their thoughts and participate in their local and national communities\u201d(p. 4). Creating rigorous standards for basic knowledge in all US schools is a goal that is sound and rather achievable. However, when such goals are based on a Darwinian like competition and coercion where only the fittest can survive they become rather inapplicable for satisfying the needs of human development, equity and sustainable social progress.\n\nBronfenbrenner\u2019s ecological systems theory (1979, 2005, 2009) (subsequently named from Bronfenbrenner himself as bioecological systems theory) is also an example of schools as organic ingredients of a single concentric system that includes four sub systems; the micro, the meso, the exo and the macro as well as the chronosystem that refers to the change of the other four through time. The Micro system involves activities and roles that are experienced through interpersonal relationships such as the family, schools, religious or social institutions or any interactions with peers. The meso system includes the relationships developed between the various microsystem components, such as the relationship between school and workplace or family and schools. The exosystem comprises various interactions between systems that the person who is in the process of development does not directly participates but influence the way microsystems function and impact on the person. Some examples of exosystems are the relationships between family and peers of the developing person, family and schools, etc. The macrosystem incorporates all these things that can be considered as cultural environment and social context in which the developing person lives. Finally, the chronosystem introduces a time dimension, which encompasses all other sub-systems, subjecting them to the changes occurred through time. All these systems constantly interact, shaping a dynamic, complex but also natural ecological environment, in which a person develops its understanding of the world. In practical terms, this theory has found application in Finland, gradually transforming the Finish educational system to such a degree that is now considered the best all over the world (M\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4 and Uusiautti, 2014; Takala et al., 2015). Finally, Bronfenbrenner is also an advocate that poverty and social inequalities are developed not because of differences in individual characteristics and capabilities but because of institutional constraints that are insurmountable to those from a lower socio-economic background.\n\nFreire (1970, 2009) criticizes the way schooling is delivered in contemporary societies. The term he uses to describe the current state of education is \u201cbanking education\u201d, where teachers and students have very discrete roles with the former to be perceived as depositors of knowledge and the latter as depositories. This approach sees the knowledge acquired within the institutional premises of formal education as an absolute truth, where reality is perceived as something static aiming to preserve the status quo in education and in turn in society and satisfy the interests of the elite. This actual power play means that those who hold knowledge and accept its acquiring procedure as static, become the oppressors whereas those who either lack knowledge or even hold it but challenge it in order to transform it, the oppressed. From the one side the oppressors achieve to maintain their dominance over the oppressed and on the other side the oppressed accept their inferior role as an unchallenged normality where their destiny is predetermined and can never be transformed. Therefore, through this distinction of social roles, social inequalities are maintained and even intensified through time. Freire sees the \u201cbanking education\u201d approach as a historical hubris since social reality is a process of constant transformation and hence, it is by definition dynamic and non-static. What we actually know today cannot determine our future social roles, neither can prohibit individuals from challenging and transforming it into something new (Freire, 1970; Giroux, 1983; Darder, 2003).\n\nThe banking education approach resembles very much the ethos of the human capital theory, where individuals utilise educational attainment as an investment instrument for succeeding higher wages in the future and also climb the levels of social hierarchy. The assumption of linearity between past individual actions and future economic and social outcomes is at the core of banking education and thus human capital theory. However, this assumption introduces a serious logical fallacy that surprisingly policy makers seem to value very little nowadays, at least in the Western societies. Freire (2009) apart from criticizing the current state of education argues that a pedagogical approach that \u201cdemythologize\u201d and unveils reality by promoting dialogue between teachers and students create critical thinkers, who are engaged in inquiry in order to create social reality by constantly transforming it. This is the process of problem-posing education, which aligns its meaning with the intrinsic view of education that regards human development as mainly detached from the acquisition of material objects and accumulation of wealth through increased levels of educational attainment.\n\nOriginated in Germany, the term Bildung\u2014at least as this was interpreted from 18th century onwards, after Middle Ages era where everything was explained in the prism of a strict and theocratic society- shaped the philosophy by which the German educational system has been functioning even until nowadays (Waters, 2016). Bildung aims to provide the individual education with the appropriate context, through which can reach high levels of professional development as well as citizenship. It is a term strongly associated with the liberation of mind from superstition and social stereotypes. Education is assumed to have philosophical underpinnings but it needs, as philosophy itself as a whole does too, to be of some practical use and therefore some context needs to be providedFootnote 3 (Herder, 2002).\n\nFor Goethe (2006) Bildung, is a self-realisation process that the individual undertakes under a specific context, which aims to inculcate altruism where individual actions are consider benevolent only if they are able to serve the general society. Although Bildung tradition, from the one hand, assumes that educational process should be contextualised, it approach context as something fluid that is constantly changing. Therefore, it sees education as an interactive and dynamic process, where roles are predetermined; however at the same time they are also amenable to constant transformation (Hegel, 1977). Consequently, this means that Bildung tradition is more closely to what Freire calls problem-posing education and therefore to the intrinsic notion of education. Weber (1968), looked on the Bildung tradition as a means to educate scientists to be involved in policy making and overcome the problems of ineffective bureaucracy. Waters (2016) based on his experiences with teaching in German higher education argue that the Bildung tradition is still apparent today in the educational system in Germany.\n\nHowever, higher education, as an institution, involves students, teachers, administrators, policy makers, workers, businessmen, marketers and generally, individuals with various social roles, different demographic characteristics and even different socio-economic backgrounds. It comes natural that their interests can be conflicting and thus, they perceive the purpose of higher education differently."}, {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/srep04770", "page_content": "Three characteristics are computed for each institution i (Fig. 2): the institution size (A i ), representing the total number of distinct authors that published at least one paper at institution i; the number of papers (P i ) published under affiliation i; the cumulative number of citations (C i ) collected by all papers P i . We find that P(A) follows a fat tailed distribution, indicating significant population heterogeneity among different institutions (Fig. 2a). While most institutions are small, a few have a large number of scientists, often corresponding to large institutes or universities. We observe similar disparity in P(C) (Fig. 2b): few institutions acquire a large number of citations, while most research labs or universities receive few citations.\n\nFigure 2 Basic features of research institutions. (a) The probability density function of institution size, A, follows a fat tailed distribution, indicating a significant heterogeneity. While most institutions size are small, a few have a large population, often representing large institutes or universities with a long history. (b) The probability density function of citations of institutions, C, is also very heterogeneous. Few institutions acquired a large number of citations, while most research labs or universities received few citations. Only the first thousand locations are taken into account in further analyses (shaded area). (c) The correlation between institution size and average publication impact is reported. Institution size positively correlates with the impact of publications (R2 = 0.9), indicating that large institutions offer a more innovative/higher impact environment than smaller ones as captured by citations per paper. The dashed line indicates a power-law behaviour with exponent \u03b1 = 0.204 \u00b1 0.006 (d) The correlation between institution size and institution average productivity is also reported, indicating institution size has little influence on productivity (R2 = 0.43). The dashed line indicates a power-law behaviour with exponent \u03b1 = 0.037 \u00b1 0.003. Full size image\n\nFigures 2c\u2013d show the correlation between the institution size A and both the average publications impact C/P and the average productivity P/A of institutions. The average productivity and impact of an institution are different but complementary measures of scientific performance. We find the institution size has little influence on productivity (R2 = 0.43) (Fig. 2d), yet it positively correlates with the impact of publications (R2 = 0.85), indicating that large institutions offer a more innovative/higher impact environment than smaller ones as captured by citations per paper (Fig. 2c). Also, as larger institutions have more internal collaborations, the number of co-authors in publications from large institutions might be larger and, as a consequence, attracts more citations18.\n\nMany institutions are small with few citations, hence they account for very small portion of the data. For the rest of the paper, we will focus on the thousand most cited institutions, accounting for more than 99% of papers. They correspond to institutions with at least 698 citations within the APS data over the 120-year period (shaded area in Fig. 2).\n\nMobility is often important in furthering a professional career4. In science, the best lab for the type of research you are doing is usually not where you are22,23,24. Nowadays changing countries is a rite of passage for many young researchers who follow the resources and facilities3,16. As the patterns and characteristics of these migrations are blurry, we need to systematically study the mobility of scientists. Thanks to the large disambiguated data spanning the last 120 years that we have compiled, a systematic study of scientific mobility is now possible.\n\nThe strong correlations between the three quantities (A, P, C) indicate any of the three could characterise an institution, serving as a proxy of its ranking against others. Here, we choose C (the total number of citations) as our parameter to approximate the ranking by reputation. Other parameters such as the h-index of an institution or the number of papers P could also be used25,26,27. But the results should be insensitive to this choice owing to good correlations between these quantities (R2 = 0.96 and R2 = 0.92 respectively). The top-ranked institutions all correspond to well-known universities or research labs with long tradition of excellence in physics (Fig. 3), corroborating our hypothesis that C is a reasonable proxy for ranking. We can also observe the similarity and stability of other rankings when comparing with other metrics.\n\nFigure 3 Ten most cited institutions in physics. Comparison between different rankings. The H-index is closely related to the number of citations as we can observe. Top-ranked institutions all correspond to well-known universities or research labs with long tradition of excellence in physics, corroborating our hypothesis that C is a reasonable proxy for ranking. Full size image\n\nWe focus on authors with similar career longevity, restricting our corpus to those who began their career between 1950 and 1980 and published for at least 20 years without any interruption exceeding 5 years. Following these criteria, we arrived at a subset of 2,725 scientists to study the mobility patterns and their impact on their careers. A total of 5,915 career movements are recorded for this corpus.\n\nIn Figure 4a we select three individuals as exemplary career histories. Each line represents one individual, with circles denoting his/her publications, allowing us to observe his/her location. The size of the circle is proportional to citations the paper acquires in five years, approximating the impact of the work. By studying the whole corpus, we compute P(m), the probability for a scientist to have visited m different institutions along his career (Fig. 4c), finding that career movements are common but infrequent: Only 14% of them never moved at all (m = 1). For the ones that move, they mostly move once or twice, P(m) decaying quickly as m increases. We also compute P(t), the probability to observe a movement at time t, where t = 0 corresponds to the date of the scientist's first publication. We find that most movements occurred in the early stage of the career (Fig. 4b), supporting the hypothesis that changing affiliations is a rite of passage for young researchers4. This likely corresponds to the postdoc period where graduates broaden their horizons through mobility. This may also reflect the increasing cost of relocation and family constraints as family developed3,5. A third characteristic is the geographical distance of movements, \u0394d. Existing literature hints for somewhat competing hypothesis in the role geography plays in career movements. Indeed, research on human mobility suggests that regular human movements mostly cover short distances with occasional longer trips, characterized by a power law distance distribution7,8,10,28; in contrast, country-level surveys find increasing cross-country movements mostly due to cultural exposure and life quality concerns, indicating potential dominance in long distance moves in career choices comparing with typical human travels1,2,3,5,29,30,31. We measure the distance distribution over all moves observed in our dataset, finding that our result is supported by a combination of both hypothesis. We find the probability to move to further locations decays as a power law32,33, whereas the null model predicts this probability to be flat (Fig. 4d). This observation is consistent with studies on human mobility, that short distance moves dominate career choices. Yet, when comparing the power law exponents, we find the exponent characterizing career moves (\u03b3 = 0.65 \u00b1 0.053) is much smaller than those observed in human travel (\u03b3 \u2248 2), corresponding to higher likelihood of observing long range movements. This observation might be explained by the influence that scientific collaborations can have on career movements as similar low exponents are observed for collaboration network between cities34.\n\nFigure 4 Basic features of scientists career. (a) Illustration of three scientific trajectories based on publications where each line corresponds to one scientist and each publication is represented by a circle whose size is proportional to its number of citations cumulated within 5 years after its publication. The institutions are ranked according to the total number of citations they obtained (see Methods), 1 being the most cited institution. (b) The probability density function of movement according to time, P(t), shows that most movements occurred in the early stage of the career. This likely corresponds to the postdoc period where graduates broaden their horizons through mobility. (c) The probability density function of number of visited institutions for a scientist along his career, P(m), indicates that career movements are common but infrequent. Scientists mostly move once or twice, P(m) decaying quickly as m increases. (d) The probability density function of distance of movements, P(\u0394d), has a fat-tail that can be fitted by a power law with an exponent \u03b3 = 0.65 \u00b1 0.053, whereas the null model predicts this probability to be roughly flat. Full size image\n\nTaken together, the preceding results indicate that career moves mostly happen during the early stage of a career and are more likely to cover short distances. The observed location in both time and space raises the question of how individual moves as a function of institutional rankings. To this end, denoting with T i , j the number of transitions from the institution of rank i to the one of rank j, we measure P(i, j), the probability to have a transition from rank i to rank j as\n\nInterestingly, we find that most movements involve elite institutions (rank is small) and transitions between bottom institutions are rare (Fig. 5a). This is due to the fact that elite institutions are characterised by larger populations, hence translating into more events.\n\nFigure 5 Stratification of career movement. (a) The matrix of probability to have a transition from rank i to rank j, (1 being the top institution) indicates that most movements involve elite institutions (rank is small) while transitions between bottom institutions are rather rare. (b) The likelihood M(i, j) for a move to take place by accounting for the size of the institutions is characterized by a high degree of stratification in institutional rankings. Indeed, we observe two distinct clubs (red regions), indicating that the overrepresented movements are the ones within elite institutions (lower-left corner) or within lower-rank institutions (upper-right corner) and scientists belonging to one of the two groups tend to move to institutions within the same group. (c) \u2013 (d) The Likelihood M(i, j)|\u0394c* < 0 and M(i, j)|\u0394c* > 0 for transitions resulting in higher and lower scientific impact, respectively, indicates that the stratification in career moves is robust against individual performance. We find the red region in lower-left corner is more concentrated in Fig. 5d than in c, hinting that being more mobile in the space of rankings may lead to variable performance. Full size image\n\nTo account for the population based heterogeneity, we compare the observed P(i, j) with the probability Pnull(i, j) expected in a random model where we randomly shuffle the transitions from institution i to j while preserving the total number of transitions from and to each institution. Formally, in this null model, we have\n\nand we compare P(i, j) with the null model by computing the matrix\n\nM(i, j) is the ratio between the probability P(i, j) to have a transition from rank i to j divided by the probability Pnull(i, j) when the movements are shuffled, measuring the likelihood for a move to take place by accounting for the size of the institutions. Hence, M(i, j) = 1 indicates the amount of observed movements is about what one would expect if movements were random. Similarly, M(i, j) > 1 indicates that we observe more transitions from i to j than we expected, whereas M(i, j) < 1 corresponds to transitions that are underrepresented. We find that career moves are characterized by a high degree of stratification in institutional rankings (Fig. 5b). Indeed, we observe two distinct clubs (red spots in Fig. 5b), indicating that the overrepresented movements are the ones within elite institutions (lower-left corner) or within lower-rank institutions (upper-right corner) and scientists belonging to one of the two groups tend to move to institutions within the same group. On the other hand, both upper-left and lower-right corners are colored blue, indicating cross group movements (transitions from elite to lower-rank institutions and vice-versa) are significantly underrepresented. Also, scientists from medium-ranked institutions move to the next institution with a probability that is indistinguishable from the random case. In other words, their movements indicate no bias towards middle, elite or lower-ranked institutions.\n\nThe high intensity of stratification in career movements raises an interesting question: how does individual performance in science relate to their moves across different institutional rankings?\n\nTo answer this question, we need to quantify the performance change for each individual before and after the move. Imagine that a scientist moves from i to j and published n papers at location i and m papers at j. The impact of a paper k can be approximated by c k , the number of citations cumulated within 5 years after its publication18,19,20,21. Let and be the lists of number of citations for papers published before (c\u2212) and after (c+) the transition from i to j (T i , j ). To quantify the change in performance, we introduce\n\nwhere and are the average of c+ and c\u2212, respectively and \u03c3 c corresponds to the standard deviation of the concatenation of both c+ and c\u2212 while preserving the moment when the movement took place (see SM for more information about \u03c3 c ). Therefore, \u0394c* captures the statistical difference in the average citations between papers published before and after the movement normalized by the random expectation when the same author's publications were shuffled. A positive \u0394c* indicates papers following the move on average result in higher citation impact, hence representing an improvement in scientific performance. A negative value corresponds to a decline in performance.\n\nTo quantify the influence of movements on individual performance, we divide all movements into two categories based on the performance change: movements associated with positive and negative \u0394c* and measure M(i, j|\u0394c* > 0) and M(i, j|\u0394c* < 0). We find the observed stratification in career moves is robust against individual performance (Fig. 5c\u2013d). That is, the two clubs emerge for both categories in a similar fashion as in Figure 5b, indicating the pattern of moving within elite or lower-rank institutions is nearly universal for people whose performance is improved or decreased following the move. Comparing Figure 5c and Figure 5d, we find the red spot in lower-left corner is more concentrated in Figure 5d than in Figure 5c, hinting that being more mobile in the space of rankings may lead to variable performance. To test this hypothesis, for each transition T i , j we calculate the rank difference between the origin and destination (\u0394r ij = i \u2212 j).\n\nA positive value of \u0394r ij indicates i > j, hence a movement to a lower-rank institution, whereas \u0394r ij < 0 corresponds to transitions into institutions with a higher rank. In Figure 6 we measure the relation between \u0394c* and \u0394r. When scientists move to institutions with a lower rank (\u0394r > 0), we find that their average change in performance is negative, corresponding to a decline in the impact of their work. Yet, what is particularly interesting lies in the \u0394r < 0 regime. Indeed, when people move from lower rank location to elite institutions, we observe no performance change on average. This is rather unexpected, as transitioning from lower-rank institutions to elite institutions is thought to provide better access to ideas and lab resources, which in turn should fuel scientific productivity. A possible explanation may be that scientist who have the opportunity to make big jumps in the ranking space may have already had an excellent performance in their previous institutions. A move therefore will not affect their impact."}, {"url": "https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/education/our-insights/how-to-transform-higher-education-institutions-for-the-long-term", "page_content": "Higher-education institutions in the United States are facing unprecedented challenges. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, higher-education operating models were under tremendous pressure. Many institutions, experiencing declining enrollment, watched expenses outpace revenues and tapped into their endowments to cover shortfalls.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the pressures that higher-education institutions face. Even some of the most notable and stable institutions are experiencing significant declines in tuition and auxiliary revenues as well as increasing budget shortfalls. Our analysis suggests that, before any government or philanthropic intervention, up to 57 percent of public four-year institutions and up to 77 percent of private not-for-profit four-year institutions could suffer budgetary shortfalls of more than 5 percent. The more than $35 billion provided by the federal government to higher education in relief acts to date has helped institutions and students address some of the near-term challenges, but the enrollment headwinds will likely affect university budgets for years to come. Indeed, according to the National Student Clearinghouse data, declines in first-time college enrollment in fall 2020 were stark, with greater than 10 percent declines in public four-year institutions and 8 percent declines in private not-for-profit four-year institutions, significantly affecting most universities\u2019 top revenue source. While fundraising remained flat in academic year 2020, institutions are projecting steep fundraising declines in 2021, meaning fiscal challenges won\u2019t be easing anytime soon.\n\nA transformation approach that enables institutions to operate more flexibly and resiliently in the long term can help institutions emerge on a stronger footing from today\u2019s challenges and brace for those of the future. A true transformation often improves operating surplus by 20 percent or more\u2014money that can then be reinvested into an institution\u2019s mission. But such a transformation requires an intense, operations-wide program focused on improving student outcomes and boosting organizational health and performance. In our experience, there are five common features of the most successful transformation efforts. While many leaders are aware of such efforts, implementation success has varied. We provide five inspiring case examples that prove a transformation approach is not only possible but also essential for the long-term success of institutions.\n\nA transformation approach that enables institutions to operate more flexibly and resiliently in the long term can help institutions emerge on a stronger footing from today\u2019s challenges.\n\nEducational institution transformation best practices and case examples\n\nWhile a reasonable degree of cost management is necessary to address fiscal challenges and make change, it\u2019s perhaps more important for institutions to focus on improving student outcomes and identifying new ways to diversify and grow revenues. As core decision makers\u2014including presidents, chancellors, provosts, and CFOs or COOs\u2014embark on a transformation, they can reflect on their alignment with five factors to measure how prepared they are and determine where they need to focus their efforts.\n\nEnsure leadership is engaged and empowered to support the organization to reach its full potential\n\nThe best predictor of the success of a transformation is leadership that is willing to embrace new and innovative approaches, recognizes the importance of institutional performance and health, and is prepared to take a self-confident leap instead of incremental steps. A few actions can help core decision makers ensure leadership is on board.\n\nDevelop an aspirational, shared vision. Establish a vision for the future of the organization and frame all conversations with the leadership team around it.\n\nEstablish a data-driven organizational baseline. Assess operational and cultural performance to discover opportunities to expand mission impact and set targets.\n\nCreate a sense of urgency for bold action. Share stories about how other institutions are responding to the moment to inspire action.\n\nGet everyone involved. Activate all levels of the organization to brainstorm innovative changes and help achieve the vision by following a proven approach that gathers broad stakeholder inputs and enables ownership and accountability for improvement ideas.\n\nThe leadership team of a large network of higher-education institutions wanted to identify the full potential of the organization and build a shared vision for change. As they began their transformation journey in 2018, the system leadership met with each institution\u2019s leadership team to form a shared vision of the future of their network. These conversations helped the leaders recognize when they weren\u2019t performing at their best and, most importantly, the detrimental impact that had on students. Consequently, the collective leadership set an ambitious goal to improve organizational health, increase student enrollment and retention, and reduce costs in the interest of better serving students. The system leadership then structured the transformation efforts to empower institution leaders to own and drive the transformation at their institutions. While the approach and leaders involved throughout the effort varied, each leader was committed to pursuing the shared aspiration of improved student experience and outcomes.\n\nThe transformation increased enrollment in both new and existing programs by about 5 percent over approximately 16 months since the start of the effort\u2014through a combination of increased new enrollments and improved persistence of existing students. Further, the cost-improvement efforts have helped these institutions limit tuition increases and offer additional financing options so students can complete their education even in times of uncertainty, such as those brought on by the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nEnsure the board prioritizes the transformation\n\nBoard support and commitment is integral to the success of a transformation. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated financial and societal pressures have created an even greater imperative for boards to actively define the strategic direction of their higher-education institutions and to push leaders to make substantive and sustainable operational changes to achieve financial stability and resilience. As such, core decision makers should consider involving the board in three ways.\n\nLeverage the board\u2019s advisory role and fiduciary duties. Harness the board\u2019s unique position to push university leadership for actionable plans to adjust the status quo.\n\nBuild in accountability. Task a board subcommittee with supporting management with problem solving and track the change through regular progress updates that focus on measurable outcomes.\n\nEnsure the board is grounded in current higher-education trends. Most boards, rightfully, comprise members from a diverse set of business and philanthropic backgrounds. Many trustees won\u2019t be as familiar with the pressures facing higher education. Educating the board on the trends in higher education by sharing literature improves transparency on the institution\u2019s challenges and finances.\n\nA midsize liberal arts university was facing a crisis of declining enrollments and net tuition, and its operating deficits forced the university to double what it typically drew from endowments for four subsequent years. Due to these financial concerns, the university\u2019s accreditation organization alerted it of the need for immediate action to avoid the risk of probation and possible loss of accreditation. The university needed a strategy that would enable it to make rapid and significant changes without sacrificing the quality of the education.\n\nThe board took responsibility for shaping the transformation goals, unifying key stakeholders, and building momentum throughout the university. The board oversaw a short review of the school\u2019s key metrics and plotted a course that placed as much emphasis on student success and enrollment-driven revenue growth as cost management. Next, it supported the university leadership to encourage faculty, staff, and students to play active roles in this transformation by creating a compelling change story and providing transparency that inspired people to think and behave differently. The board and leadership relayed this change story through carefully planned internal and external communications. To continually reinforce its crucial role in this process, a subcommittee of the board committed to meet biweekly to monitor progress over the entire transformation period.\n\nThe university\u2019s first-year class increased by 30 percent the first year of the transformation, and it saw similar increases the following two years. In addition, retention from the first to second year of school improved from 77 to 85 percent, the university\u2019s financial health significantly improved, and for the first time in nearly a decade, it had a balanced budget in 2019. Moreover, the new processes renewed a culture of continuous improvement and put the institution in a much better position to weather the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nTranslate financial outcomes to the institution\u2019s mission when setting transformation targets\n\nTo maximize outcomes for students, faculty, staff, and the broader community, higher-education institutions need to be financially sustainable and efficient. Drawing the link between financial goals and an institution\u2019s mission serves as a powerful rallying cry in support of transformative change. Two related actions can help.\n\nEmphasize mission impact over financial impact in messaging to the campus. Share impact and successes\u2014for example, when additional financial aid has been allocated to Pell-eligible students to support their success, focus on the impact of improved persistence rates rather than the increased revenues from student retention.\n\nCommunicate small but impactful vignettes. For instance, spotlight additional research funding secured due to strategic investment in grant writers. Such stories personalize the change for the community.\n\nThe CFO and provost of a large flagship public university both recognized the need for change. Their operating expenses were outgrowing their operating revenues, and state funding had precipitously declined amid budget pressures. Though the university was not yet in distress, the leaders wanted to act before circumstances became more dire. Leaders were aware, however, that the university had undertaken several large initiatives over the preceding three years, and the community was wary of another significant effort. To help tie together what had previously been more siloed efforts, the university linked the financial transformation to prior initiatives tied to the teaching and research mission. Leaders linked every opportunity area that was explored\u2014such as research, student success, and marketing optimization\u2014to how it was enabling a greater \u201creturn on mission\u201d for the university. Ultimately, through the community rallying around their common goal of teaching, research, and the public good, the community developed initiatives to generate and implement innovative ideas to support the institution.\n\nIn the first year of the transformation, the university realized more than $30 million of revenue generation or cost savings, and it put itself on the path to almost $100 million in improvements the following year. More importantly, this net benefit to the university also enabled investments in critical mission activities to support research growth, student advising and wellness, and more flexibility for students through expanded summer offerings.\n\nTake a comprehensive approach across both growth and efficiencies\n\nCost-reduction measures can often lead to decreased employee morale and can impact student outcomes. But targeting strategic growth can expand the impact of an institution\u2019s mission and establish a more financially resilient university.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 crisis, many universities turned to cost savings as immediate opportunities to improve their near-term financial outlook. While this was necessary, cost-reduction measures can often lead to decreased employee morale, and, in the worst case, they can impact student outcomes. Targeting strategic growth, in a few ways, can help provide inspiration for the community, expand the impact of an institution\u2019s mission, and establish a more financially resilient university.\n\nReview student outcomes and revenue-generating and operating activities. Conduct a comprehensive review and analyze the findings to understand opportunities to grow. Key areas to explore include the program portfolio, endowment returns, and student support and service (exhibit).\n\nEnsure messaging to the community focuses on strategic growth ambitions as well as efficiency. University stakeholders require inspiration to help them overcome financial strain. Areas of growth can provide an optimistic outlook to help the community through the required change.\n\nIn recent years, a midsize not-for-profit religious university had faced a decreasing surplus with declining enrollment and retention paired with steady increases in costs, which was only exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Leaders wanted to solidify the university\u2019s financial situation for future mission-based investments while diversifying its student base through targeted growth. But prior implementation of cost measures had been met with significant resistance from university faculty and staff.\n\nUniversity leaders realized they needed to implement a comprehensive approach focused on not only costs but also revenue; in addition to transparently framing the need to save costs to pursue future priorities, they highlighted detailed plans for strategic revenue generation. The president rallied the community for an all-hands-on-deck effort to solve the financial gap while maintaining student experience. They instituted a clear process to evaluate the ideas generated by the community and to allow for quick decisions. Ultimately, through reframing what it meant to \u201cput the community first\u201d and providing community members with inspirational initiatives in addition to the more challenging efforts, the president and school leaders were able to implement decisions with stakeholder support.\n\nIndeed, within just four months, the administration was able to present a detailed outline to meet savings goals, and the university achieved 3 to 5 percent annual budget value improvement within four months of acting on this plan.\n\nBuild muscle for change\n\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, many institutions have relied on short-term efforts that may help them survive the crisis but will not change their long-term trajectory. An effective transformation builds the capacity for sustained change and continuous improvement rather than implementing short-term changes to survive a crisis.\n\nEstablish a central transformation team. Use this team to provide support to overcome barriers and accountability to achieve objectives; run a regular cadence to ensure timely execution.\n\nDetail a transparent and objective decision-making process. Clearly detail what information is required to evaluate an idea and communicate how leadership will use this information to determine what moves forward. The clarity builds confidence within the community around a fair and objective process that all can participate in.\n\nImprove organizational capabilities. Invest in growing individual and collective capacity through dedicated training aimed at expanding the talent bench and ensuring the longevity of the transformation.\n\nLeaders at a large Research I public university drove a transformation around the four best practices previously described to fundamentally alter their operating model. In the first 12 months, they succeeded in establishing new, objective ways to evaluate and execute on ideas. In the final six months of the transformation, the university focused on sustainability and established a team to help maintain the new habits and procedures. This central implementation team not only continues to drive the transformation forward but also is adapting the process for other parts of the organization\u2014for example, evaluating new budget requests\u2014thus broadening the impact and ingraining the change throughout the organization.\n\nHigher-education institutions are under tremendous pressure and time constraints as they work to keep their students, faculty, and staff safe while they deliver on their missions to educate, conduct research, and contribute to their communities, society, and the public good. In a sector that is already feeling stretched, the prospects of a comprehensive transformation might sound overwhelming to leaders and the communities they lead. But the effort will be worth it.\n\nLeaders can inspire their communities with a more resilient future state that allows them to see beyond the pandemic to focus on improving the well-being of individuals and society through inspired learning, growth, and change. By implementing an ambitious set of projects to inspire the entire team, foster new areas of growth, and change the university\u2019s trajectory, these institutions can continue to influence and impact generations of learners and their communities."}, {"url": "https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2022/05/27/changing-college-university-driven-image-prestige", "page_content": "After years of campaigning for designation as universities, Dominican and other institutions in New York moved quickly to publicize their new names.\n\nDominican College in Orangeburg, N.Y., was one of several colleges in the state working for the last several years to convince the state\u2019s Board of Regents to change its definition of the types of higher ed institutions that could or could not be called a \u201cuniversity.\u201d When the board officially amended the regulation and expanded the definition in January, the college\u2019s administrators applied to be officially designated a university.\n\nIts application was approved by the board on May 17\u2014and on May 18, Dominican College became Dominican University.\n\nThe new designation more accurately fits what Dominican, a Catholic institution, offers academically and culturally, said Sister Mary Eileen O\u2019Brien, president of the university. She pointed to the expansion of the undergraduate and graduate curricula over the years, from mostly liberal arts courses to the addition of more business, science and technology courses, as well as doctoral programs in nursing and physical therapy. She said the cachet of \u201cuniversity\u201d also suits the institution.\n\nUnder the state board\u2019s previous definition, an institution could only be designated as a university if it offered \u201ca range of registered undergraduate and graduate curricula in the liberal arts and sciences, degrees in two or more professional fields, and doctoral programs in at least three academic fields.\u201d The amendment approved in January removed the requirement for professional and doctoral programs. Universities are now defined as \u201cincluding graduate programs registered in at least three of the following discipline areas: agriculture, biological sciences, business, education, engineering, fine arts, health professions, humanities, physical sciences and social sciences.\u201d\n\nSeveral other New York colleges have pending applications requesting the university designation, and a handful of former colleges have become universities since January.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure the title reflected the level of commitment to\u201d the rigor, quality and quantity of courses offered by Dominican, Sister Mary Eileen said of the pursuit of the university designation.\n\nInstitutions outside New York that have made the change from college to university had similar motivations, marketing consultants say. But New York was the only state that required any doctorate programs, much less three, for an institution to be defined as a university.\n\n\u201cOver the years, whenever the topic came up, we encouraged New York State to become more like the other 49,\u201d Sister Mary Eileen said.\n\nDominican, a small institution just north of New York City, is a Hispanic-serving institution. Sister Mary Eileen said her concern about how Hispanic students view the name change is due to perceptions of \u201ccollege\u201d versus \u201cuniversity\u201d among people of Hispanic origin. In many countries, including in Central and South America, \u201ccollege\u201d refers to secondary education, or high school. This can be confusing to international students considering studying in the United States and makes it difficult for American colleges to recruit students from abroad.\n\nSister Mary Eileen said being known as a university makes \u201cclear the level of education, particularly for our Spanish-speaking students, and it presents the offerings of this institution as more prestigious.\u201d\n\nWhen William Murphy, New York State\u2019s deputy commissioner of higher education, recommended the amended definition in a memo to the Higher Education Committee of the Board of Regents last December, he cited \u201cincreasing competition from institutions chartered in other states recruiting students in New York, nationally and internationally, where the term \u2018college\u2019 presents a significant marketing challenge.\u201d\n\nChanging the requirements, which had been in place since 1969, would allow the state\u2019s institutions \u201cto more effectively compete and market their programs within the state, nationally and globally,\u201d he wrote in a memo to the committee.\n\nThis was the case for Utica College in central New York, St. Joseph\u2019s College in Brooklyn and Molloy College in Long Island, which all have since been officially recognized as universities. At least two private institutions in the Rochester area, St. John Fisher College and Nazareth College, are considering changing their designations from colleges to universities.\u201d (Note: This sentence was revised to reflect that St. John Fisher and Nazareth are considering becoming universities but have not formally sought a change in designation by the state Board of Regents.)\n\n\u201cFor us, university status conveys greater prestige, has stronger reputational value domestically and internationally, and better represents the type of institution we are today and what we have already been in practice for many years,\u201d a spokesperson for St. John Fisher College said in an emailed statement.\n\nAt least one public institution in New York is also considering seeking authorization to call itself a university.\n\nSUNY Old Westbury in Long Island, one of 34 four-year institutions in the State University of New York system, still considers itself a college, but it changed its branding about eight years ago from SUNY College at Old Westbury. Michael Kinane, a college spokesperson, said formal discussions will begin this summer and continue through the fall semester on whether the institution should formally be designated a university.\n\n\u201cIt has been a while since we discussed who we thought we were and what students thought about themselves,\u201d Kinane said.\n\nHe said the goal is to strike a balance between a marketable brand, an identity that represents its presence in the SUNY system as an institution that fits the definition of \u201cuniversity\u201d and the culture of a close-knit college with small classes and a connection between students and faculty members.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about what it would mean, what our history would mean and how it reflects who we are,\u201d he said.\n\nDominican University officials will spend the summer removing \u201ccollege\u201d from and adding \u201cuniversity\u201d to its name on everything from business cards to bank accounts to signage\u2014including on the university\u2019s website, which still refers to it as a college in some places.\n\nThe sign at the entrance to the university was changed on the same day the university announced the approval of the university designation.\n\n\u201cThat was going to be first,\u201d Sister Mary Eileen said.\n\nThe newly named university has since publicized the change, and the reception has \u201cbeen very positive\" among faculty members, students, alumni and the surrounding community, she said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re congratulating us,\u201d she said, noting that the new name will not reflect negatively on the history and nature of the university. \u201cThat closeness, that level of collegiality with each other, that\u2019s the culture of this college, and we don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change.\u201d\n\nThomas Hayes, dean of the Williams College of Business at Xavier University in Ohio and co-founder of an education marketing company, SimpsonScarborough, said the image presented to students, faculty members, alumni, the academic community and the outside world is what historically has driven name changes, not just in New York and not just name changes from \u201ccollege\u201d to \u201cuniversity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea of being a university gives the impression that a school is larger, with more breadth,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cThat\u2019s an indication of where you should be moving from college to university. It gives it a little more gravitas.\u201d\n\nThe changes are not always universally welcomed. Hayes\u2019s company worked with administrators at Loyola College in Baltimore in the late 2000s to rename the institution Loyola University of Maryland to match its expansion of program offerings. (By the time the name change became official in 2009, nearly every other institution named Loyola in the U.S. had long ago been designated as a university.)\n\nThere was significant pushback from alumni who opposed the name change, said Elizabeth Johnson, co-founder and chairperson of SimpsonScarborough.\n\n\u201cThey thought the institution was losing its personal appeal, its small community feel,\u201d she said.\n\nJohnson said the distinction between \u201ccollege\u201d and \u201cuniversity\u201d carries great weight in the U.S. as well as internationally. She said surveys the company has conducted with administrators, prospective students and their parents indicate \u201cThey prefer universities to colleges. They think they\u2019re bigger, they think they\u2019re better, they think they\u2019re more prestigious.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/10/9/915", "page_content": "To reiterate, this study examined the credibility of SPRH and its determinants. The results are respectively presented in this section.\n\nSpecifically, Chenzhou respondents scored higher on SPRH (4.25) than Shenzhen respondents (3.96). Yet, they scored lower on conflict and institutional change (0.99) and institutional change (0.82) than their Shenzhen counterpart (1.35 and 1.04, respectively). When all these components are taken into account, we can see that Chenzhou respondents had an overall supportive perception of SPRH (1.14) compared to Shenzhen respondents (0.83). In addition, although the minimum and the maximum HPIRs of Chenzhou SPRH buyers were lower than those of Shenzhen, the average HPIR of Chenzhou SPRH buyers (44.52) was much higher than that of Shenzhen (25.27). This differential indicates that, compared with the case in Shenzhen, commercial housing in Chenzhou is much more unaffordable for SPRH residents. Concerning SCR, the affordability of SPRH relative to commercial housing in Chenzhou (0.25) was higher than that in Shenzhen (0.33). The lowest and the highest SCRs in Chenzhou were 0.04 and 0.87 respectively. In Shenzhen, the price of SPRH can be even higher than that of commercial houses in the surrounding. This is reflected by the SCR of 1.33 at the high end. For the respondents in Shenzhen, social housing is not very difficult to obtain, while access to social housing in Chenzhou seems to be slightly more difficult.\n\nThe descriptive statistics of the three components of SPRH credibility, resultant OSP, and various independent variables are shown in Table 3 . Overall, the average score for buyers\u2019 perceptions about SPRH was 4.02 (out of 8). The average score for conflicts was 1.21 (out of 5), implying a low level of conflicts perceived by the respondents. Less than half of the respondents showed willingness to move from SPRH to formal housing institutions, thus the mean score of expected institutional change was less than 1 (out of 2). Considering the commercial housing price and the respondents\u2019 annual income, it will take residents of SPRH an average of 30 years to save money for purchasing a commercial housing unit of 100 square meters. While few of them may need only 2 years to buy commercial housing, the longest time required can be 300 years. The ratio of the SPRH price to the commercial housing price ranged from 0.04 to 1.33, with an average of 0.306, indicating that the price of SPRH is significantly lower than that of commercial housing. On average, the price of SPRH is just about one-third of the price of commercial housing only. The average score of the availability of social housing was 3.22 (out of 5), which means that social housing is perceived as being relatively easy for most people to obtain successfully.\n\nMeanwhile, divergent perceptions about the credibility of SPRH were returned by the respondents from the two cities. Compared with Chenzhou, a larger proportion of respondents in Shenzhen perceived conflicts and expected the change of SPRH into formal housing. The respondents in Chenzhou seemed to be more supportive of SPRH than their Shenzhen counterpart. Overall, the credibility of SPRH in Chenzhou looked higher than that in Shenzhen. However, the proportion of respondents in Shenzhen believing that they had the right to rent and sell SPRH was higher than that in Chenzhou. Both lease and sale are related to the usufruct of property. Combined with the fact that the respondents\u2019 average income in Shenzhen was much higher than the city\u2019s overall average, the findings suggest that not all the people who bought the informal housing in Shenzhen were low-incomers who saw SPRH as their passive choices. Some of them did not apply for social housing and could actually afford commercial housing. The buyers of SPRH may also come from the high-income group who actively choose SPRH for investment. This circumstance reflects the investment function of SPRH in Shenzhen for risk-loving investors.\n\nMoreover, according to Figure 5 , the responses from Chenzhou and Shenzhen show some similarities and differences with regard to the respondents\u2019 perceptions of the intuition, the conflicts, and the change of SPRH. In both cities, less than half of the respondents invested or wanted to invest substantially in housing decoration, thought that their house purchase contracts were valid, and believed that they had the right to present or bequeath SPRH. At the same time, nonetheless, more than half of the respondents believed that they were the owners of their SPRH and that they had the right to rent or sell the houses. In both cities, only less than 20% of the respondents stated that there had been conflicts due to property right and that the conflicts involved violent conflicts or lasted for a long time. However, more than 40% of the respondents were worried about the demolition initiated by the government. Over 30% of the respondents in Chenzhou and more than 50% of the respondents in Shenzhen worried about the conflict of interest with sellers.\n\nIn the measurement of actors\u2019 perception of conflicts, only 17.7% of the respondents said that there were conflicts related to property rights in their SRPH community, with a few violent conflicts (5.0%) and long-lasting conflicts (8.3%). On the psychological level, 41.9% and 47.6% of the respondents worried about conflicts relating to expulsion and demolition by the government and conflicts of interests with the sellers, respectively. Regarding the analysis of whether actors intended to change their SPRH into formal housing, about 48.0% and 50.7% of buyers expressed their expectation or consideration of moving from their small property rights houses to commercial housing and social housing, respectively, indicating that about half of the respondents wanted to exchange SPRH for formal institutions.\n\nTo measure the credibility of SPRH, the respondents answered a series of questions on topics including their perceptions of SPRH, conflicts about SPRH, and whether they expected to move away from the informal housing institution into formal housing (see Figure 4 ). Of the respondents, 41.9% indicated that they were willing to or had made a substantial investment in their house, such as decoration and purchases of large furniture; 55.7% of the actors thought that they and their family were the owners of SPRH; and 48.5% of them believed that the property rights of the housing belonged to them. Only 34.9% of the respondents thought that the house purchase contract was valid, and 77.9%, 60.3%, 39.5%, and 43.4% of the respondents believed that they had the right to rent out, sell, present, and bequeath their SPRH, respectively.\n\n4.2. The Impacts of Substitutability and Other Factors\n\nThe statistical analyses evaluated the effects of the substitutability of institutional functions on OSP, which is the fundamental element of institutional credibility. Firstly, the correlations between the independent variables and control variables were checked. The control variables included the respondents\u2019 demographic and socio-economical characteristics as well as the geographical locations of the SPRH and the third-party agency. As presented in Table 4 , there was a significant problem of multicollinearity between variables. The HPIR was significantly correlated with the respondents\u2019 income and geographical location of SPRH as well as the SCR. Perhaps, it is because house price depends very much on the property\u2019s location and buyers\u2019 affordability to pay. The SCR was also significantly correlated with the ASH, the gender, and the education level of respondents and the property\u2019s location. The ASH was significantly related to the control variables.\n\n2s for Model 1, Model 2, and Model 3 were 0.021, 0.057, and 0.092, respectively, indicating that only around 2% and about 6% of the variation in the dependent variable can be explained by the differences in the independent variables in Model 1 and Model 2, respectively, and about 9% of the variation in the dependent variable can be explained by the differences in the variables in Model 3. Model 3 has more explanatory power than Model 1 and Model 2 for the variation in the supportive perception of the SPRH institution. Therefore, three models were applied to test the relationship between the substitutability of institutional functions and the actors\u2019 supportive perceptions. Model 1 explored the effects of the two independent variables (HPIR and ASH) on actors\u2019 perceptions, which were not highly correlated with each other. Due to the multicollinearity between the independent and the control variables, Model 2 and Model 3 applied a stepwise linear regression analysis to exclude the variables with little explanatory power over OSP from the independent variables (HPIR, SCR, and ASH) and from all the explanatory variables (HPIR, SCR, ASH, age, gender, income, education level, geographical location, and third-party agency). The result is presented in Table 5 . The retuned adjusted Rs for Model 1, Model 2, and Model 3 were 0.021, 0.057, and 0.092, respectively, indicating that only around 2% and about 6% of the variation in the dependent variable can be explained by the differences in the independent variables in Model 1 and Model 2, respectively, and about 9% of the variation in the dependent variable can be explained by the differences in the variables in Model 3. Model 3 has more explanatory power than Model 1 and Model 2 for the variation in the supportive perception of the SPRH institution.\n\nIn Model 1, without considering the control variables, both HPIR and ASP (at the 1% level at least) were negatively related to the OSP. When the other variables remained constant, if the HPIR or the ASH increased by one unit, the OSP was likely to decrease by 0.039 or 0.082 units, respectively. This shows that respondents who had greater difficulty purchasing commercial housing tended to perceive SPRH as having lower credibility, and those who were more likely to apply for social housing successfully tended to perceive a lower level of credibility.\n\nModel 2 employed stepwise regression to examine the effect coefficient of HPIR, SCR, and ASH. It found that the impact of the ASH became insignificant, and this independent variable was excluded from the model, while the HPIR and the SCR showed significantly (at the 1% level at least and at the 0.1% level at least, respectively) negative effects on actors\u2019 overall supportive perceptions of SPRH. As the value of the HPIR increased by a unit, the OSP tended to decrease by 0.048 units, with other variables staying unchanged. In other words, if the time required to purchase commercial housing with the annual income increased by 1 year, the actors\u2019 supportive perception of SPRH decreased by 0.048 units, with other conditions being unchanged. Moreover, when other variables remained constant, if the SCR increased by one unit, the OSP tended to decrease by 1.422 units. On the contrary, when the SCR decreased, which meant that SPRH was much more affordable than commercial housing, the intuitional credibility of SPRH tended to be higher. Thus, when the HPIR was taken as the measurement of CH, it seemed that, when commercial housing was harder to afford or the substitutability of commercial housing for SRPH decreased, the credibility of SPRH was lower, thus Hypothesis 1 seemed to be rejected. However, when the SCR was taken as the measurement of CH, there was a negative correlation between the substitutability of commercial housing and the institutional credibility of SPRH. Hypothesis 1 should be supported. Considering that the HPIR represents the affordability of commercial housing and only examines the situation of the commercial housing environment, while the SCR can reflect the comparison between commercial housing and the informal housing institution, SPRH, the SCR can measure the substitutability better. Moreover, there was a correlation between the price of commercial housing and that of SPRH. When the affordability of commercial housing around SPRH decreased, the affordability of SPRH tended to decrease as well, which may have been the reason for the negative relationship between the HPIR and the OSP. Besides, both the coefficient and the p-value of the SCR showed a more significant impact of the SCR than the HPIR. Hence, Hypothesis 1 should be supported.\n\nWhen the potential impacts of the control variables were also taken into consideration in Model 3, the variables with a significant impact on the dependent variable identified from the independent variables and the control variables were the HPIR (at the 1% level at least), the SCR (at the 0.1% level at least), the actors\u2019 education level (at the 1% level at least), and the third-party agency (at the 5% level at least). Actors with a higher education level were likely to hold a less supportive view of SPRH, and, when the education level of actors rose by one level, their supportive perception of SPRH was inclined to decrease by 0.183 units, with other variables staying constant. Compared with SPRH without the third-party agency, SPRH with a third-party agency in the trade process was likely to be granted 0.219 units less credibility by the buyers. With the influence of the control variables, CH was still significantly related to the OSP.\n\nThe findings imply that, although the influence of the availability of social housing (ASH) on credibility was not as significant as that of actors\u2019 education level and the involvement of a third-party agency in the SPRH institution, the substitutability of commercial housing for SPRH had a statistically significant correlation with the OSP, even when the internal features of actors and the attributes of SPRH were taken into consideration. With a sample from two cities, it seems that the actors\u2019 overall supportive perception of the informal housing institution at the individual level can be influenced by the substitutability of institutional functions or the performance of its substitutes in the institutional environment. Therefore, Hypothesis 1 is supported while Hypothesis 2 is rejected.\n\n2 than Model 6 (0.015) and Model 7 (0.055). These results indicate that our analytic model in Furthermore, we ran the stepwise regression analyses using separate datasets from Chenzhou (Models 4 and 5) and Shenzhen (Models 6 and 7). As shown in Table 6 and Table 7 , Model 4 (0.399) and Model 5 (0.426) returned much higher adjusted Rthan Model 6 (0.015) and Model 7 (0.055). These results indicate that our analytic model in Figure 2 can better explain the SPRH institution of Chenzhou than that of Shenzhen. One possible reason for the difference is the prosperity of SPRH market in Shenzhen. The credibility of the informal housing in Shenzhen may depend partly on its investment (and speculation) functions due to the considerable compensation receivable by the owners during demolition and the housing market soar. If SPRH in Shenzhen performs its investment (and speculation) functions effectively, commercial housing and social housing may only have substitutability for SPRH in terms of the living function only. Yet, living function could be less valued by most SPRH buyers in Shenzhen.\n\nIn Model 4, all three independent variables showed a significant impact on credibility. In Chenzhou, HPIR ( p < 0.01), SCR ( p < 0.001), and ASH ( p < 0.01) were negatively correlated with reliability. Such findings imply that, in Chenzhou, the credibility of SPRH tend to diminish when commercial housing is more unaffordable for the homebuyers, keeping other things equal. However, the more affordable SPRH is relative to commercial housing, the higher will be the credibility of SRPH, ceteris paribus. The easier it is for buyers of SPRH to access social housing resources, the lower will be the credibility of SPRH, ceteris paribus. However, in Model 5, where control variables were added, ASH was no longer a significant factor affecting the credibility of SPRH. The variation in OSP was explained by the variations of those control variables instead. The education level ( p < 0.01), the third-party agency ( p < 0.05), and the geographic location ( p < 0.01) were found to have significant negative correlations with OSP. In other words, buyers with higher education tend to perceive lower credibility of SPRH, keeping other variables constant. The credibility of the SPRH without the participation of third-party agency is more likely higher than that with a third-party agency. Besides, more primely located SPRH tends to have more credibility than one further away from the CBD."}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-013-1214-2", "page_content": "Abramo, G., Cicero, T., & D\u2019Angelo, C.

A graduate of the Boston Latin School, Eliot entered Harvard University at age fifteen. Unique experiences in Josiah Cooke\u2019s laboratory interested Eliot in laboratory techniques in teaching chemistry. He tutored in mathematics at Harvard in 1854 and four years later became the first assistant professor of mathematics and chemistry. Eliot distinguished himself as a teacher by using the laboratory method in his classroom and giving Harvard\u2019s first written examinations instead of the traditional oral tests. Denied tenure at Harvard, he taught chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, studied education in Europe, and published two widely read articles on \u201cThe New Education\u201d in The Atlantic Monthly in 1869. Partially because of the public regard he earned from these writings, he was selected that year as the twenty-second president of Harvard University, a position he would hold until 1909.\n\nTenure at Harvard. During his forty-year tenure at Harvard, he raised entrance requirements, organized Harvard\u2019s specialty schools under the collegiate system, and turned the institution into a major university. His reforms strengthened the schools of law and medicine, and the theological program was broadened from training for the Unitarian ministry to one that served many denominations. Eliot opposed coeducation but agreed in the late 1870s to a \u201cHarvard Annex,\u201d a system of professors who offered instruction to selected women who were not allowed to earn degrees. In 1894 Harvard chartered Radcliffe College as a degree-granting institution. This model of the coordinate women\u2019s college offering an \u201cequivalent\u201d degree was widely adopted: Barnard College of Columbia University and Sophie Newcomb College of Tulane University are two notable affiliate schools.\n\nThe Elective System. Eliot\u2019s primary influence on education was his establishment of the elective system at Harvard, a reform followed throughout American higher education. Defining what liberal arts education should be became a problematic issue for educators in the last thirty years of the nineteenth century. Eliot\u2019s curricular reforms were radical: in the year 1884-1885 the freshmen of Harvard College took seven out of sixteen classes as required courses, but for the remainder of their college career, with the exception of a few exercises in English composition, they took elective courses. Under Eliot\u2019s leadership Harvard provided a groundbreaking curricular model for twentieth-century education by allowing students to choose from a widening range of subjects that became part of a greatly enlarged liberal arts study.\n\nOther Influences. Eliot\u2019s forty annual reports as Harvard president were landmark documents in the history of American higher education. The fifty-volume \u201cfive-foot bookshelf \u201cof Harvard Classics and Junior Classics that he edited gave much of the American public an opportunity for self-education. As the chairman of the National Education Association\u2019s Committee of Ten, he wrote the committee report in 1892 that set the curricular pattern for the American high school. As a result of that report, the study of foreign languages and mathematics was introduced in the seventh grade, a curricular change that led to the subsequent development of the junior high school. Eliot was awarded the first gold medal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1915 and the Roosevelt Medal for distinguished service in 1924.\n\nEdward Howe Cotton, The Life of Charles W. Eliot (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1926)."}, {"url": "https://blogs.smith.edu/blog/smithipedia/administration/president-william-allan-neilson/", "page_content": "President William Allan Neilson\n\nPresident William Allan Neilson\n\nWilliam Allan Neilson was born March 28, 1869, in Doune, Pertshire Scotland. He attended Edinburgh University where he studied philosophy, graduating with honors in 1891. In order to join his brother who emigrated to Canada, Neilson crossed the Atlantic and began teaching in Upper Canada College in Toronto which was a boarding school for young boys.\n\nDeciding that he would prefer to be a scholar than a school master, Neilson went on to Harvard Graduate School in Cambridge, MA where he received his Ph.D. in English in 1898. Upon receiving his Ph.D., Neilson accepted a position as an Associate in English Literature at Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr, PA. Neilson taught at many other fine institutions before settling into the work of an administrator. Harvard, Radcliffe, the Sorbonne, Columbia, Barnard, and the University of California all made use of Neilson\u2019s talents at one time or another.\n\nIt was during his years as a professor that Neilson distinguished himself as the sort of scholar that an academic institution would wish to guide it. Before coming to Smith, Neilson made a name for himself both as a professor devoted to his students\u2019 learning (he was the only instructor of Helen Keller\u2019s who learned the manual sign language she used for communication) but also as a writer and an editor. Among his writings were Essentials of Poetry (1912) and The Facts about Shakespeare (1913). He also was the editor of Milton\u2019s Minor Poems (1899) and Shakespeare\u2019s Complete Works (1906). In 1917, Neilson was offered the Presidency of Smith College. He accepted on the conditions that he would not be obligated to raise money, and that a president\u2019s house would be built, with which the trustees complied.\n\nWhen Neilson arrived at Smith in 1917 perhaps one of the best assets that Neilson brought to Smith was his quick wit that endeared him to student, staff, faculty, and alumnae alike. At Neilson\u2019s final commencement in 1939 Cynthia Walsh recalled one particular instance: The seniors will especially recall that on May Day when they went to serenade him, his new collie puppy began to bark, not realizing what sweet voices were vying with the birds so early in the morning. When the president stepped out he said, \u201cMy dog thinks you\u2019re sheep,\u201d and the volleys of laughter which greeted this remark quite drowned out the rest: \u201d-but I think you\u2019re lambs!\u201d\n\nNeilson\u2019s accomplishments at Smith were many. When Neilson noticed that a majority of Smith students lived off campus he set about the task of purchasing and building new residences so that all Smith students would live on campus. After building the Great Quadrangle, purchasing Chapin House, Talbot House, Sessions House, and many others his goal was completed. During Neilson\u2019s 22-year term as president, the campus also saw the additions of Sage Music Hall, Scott Gymnasium, Tryon Art Gallery, the Alumnae House, the Infirmary, and the President\u2019s house.\n\nNeilson also established the Junior Year in France, Junior Year in Italy, and the Junior Year in Spain Programs. Special Honors, the Smith College Day School, and the School for Social Work were additions that Neilson made to the college. Never one to rest on his laurels, Neilson continued writing and editing while looking after the well being of 2,000 students. In 1920 he wrote History of English Literature and in 1922 he edited Roads to Knowledge. He also was the editor-in-chief of Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, 2nd edition, 1934.\n\nWilliam A. Neilson died on February 13, 1946.\n\nFor further information please see: http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/smitharchives/manosca13.html\n\nThorp, Margaret Farrand, Neilson of Smith (NY: Oxford University Press), 1956"}, {"url": "https://libex.smith.edu/omeka/exhibits/show/neilson/william-allan-neilson", "page_content": "For 37 years the building which was geographically and intellectually the heart of the campus was called simply \u201cThe Library.\u201d When President William Allan Neilson died in 1946, the Trustees named it as a memorial tribute to him.\n\nWilliam Allan Neilson, Smith\u2019s third president, died on February 13 at the College Infirmary. He was visiting Northampton to research a history of Smith College that had been commissioned by the Trustees when he became ill. The next morning there was a memorial chapel service; he lay in the Little Chapel until the funeral service in John M. Greene Hall on February 16; he was cremated and later buried in the Botanic Garden.\n\nPresident Neilson's accomplishments at Smith were many.
