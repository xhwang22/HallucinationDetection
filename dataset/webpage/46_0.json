During Lombardi's nine years as coach of the Packers, Lionel Aldridge was the only rookie to start a season opener.\n\nAlthough Aldridge might have been more steady than spectacular over the course of his career, Lombardi's early faith in him was a tribute in itself. In fact, Aldridge started the first 45 games of his career under Lombardi before missing the fourth game of the 1966 season with an ankle injury.\n\nAfter the Packers won a second consecutive NFL championship in 1962, Lombardi traded veteran Bill Quinlan and created an opening at right defensive end with no obvious heir apparent. Veteran free agent Urban Henry, who wasn't re-signed by the Los Angeles Rams after missing the 1962 season with a neck injury, and No. 1 draft pick Dave Robinson were considered the frontrunners heading into camp. However, the Packers decided to play Robinson at linebacker when he reported late following the College All-Star Game and Aldridge beat out Henry.\n\nAldridge came into his own when the Packers won an unprecedented three straight NFL championships under the league's playoff format from 1965 to 1967. He started all eight postseason games during that stretch and then continued to hold forth at right end until midway through the 1971 season.\n\nOver his eight-and-a-half years as an established starter, Aldridge missed only three games, a notable achievement when you consider he broke his leg once and had some ankle issues. The worst of his injuries occurred in a mid-August preseason game in 1967 when Aldridge broke a bone in his lower left leg. He missed only the first two regular-season games, didn't start but appeared in the third, and then played roughly three-quarters of the game in a hard-fought victory over Detroit in Week 4. Lombardi, who had little compassion for injured players and rarely saluted them when they played hurt, heaped praise on Aldridge after the game. \"Aldridge deserves a lot of credit for the way he came back so fast from his injury,\" Lombardi said."}, {"url": "https://archive.jsonline.com/sports/packers/48921882.html/", "page_content": "SHARE\n\nBy ,\n\nIn the best of times, Lionel Aldridge was a defensive standout for the Green Bay Packers. An articulate and well-spoken man. A loving husband, father and family man.\n\nAn athletic 6-foot-4, 250-pound end, Aldridge used his size and strength to do something no other player had in the Vince Lombardi dynasty of the 1960s: earn a permanent starting position as a rookie.\n\nAldridge, a fourth-round draft choice from Utah State in 1963, remained a Green Bay starter through the 1971 season, playing in 123 regular-season games. He was part of three NFL championship and two Super Bowl-winning teams.\n\nIn the worst of times, Aldridge, suffering from severe depression and mental illness, lost his family and his job as a television color analyst. In 1977, his wife sued him for divorce and a month later he beat the family's dog after a domestic incident at his suburban Milwaukee home.\n\nAldridge was admitted to the psychiatric emergency ward at Milwaukee County General Hospital and tried medication and therapy to regain his mental health. By 1980, divorced and broke, he drifted for several years throughout the United States, working odd jobs to survive. He worked construction, maintenance, and even a brief stint as an assistant coach at Utah State.\n\nAt times he slept in the streets, and one morning woke up to find his Super Bowl II ring had been stolen off his finger. He showed up at Willie Davis' office in Los Angeles one day and asked for financial and medical help. Davis and other teammates were quick to offer assistance, but Aldridge never stayed long.\n\nHis daughter, Michelle Golding of Shorewood, Wis., has her father's Super Bowl I ring in a safety deposit box.\n\nFather's Day, as it always is, was a difficult day for Golding, who visited Aldridge's grave site at Wisconsin Memorial Park Cemetery in Brookfield, Wis.\n\n\"It's still tough,\" said Golding, 39, in an interview Monday afternoon. \"I found him (dead) in his apartment.\"\n\nGrowing up, Golding said she really never realized her father was famous.\n\n\"I was born in 1970, so I really didn't know how big the Packer football part of his life really was,\" she said. \"It wasn't until he was in broadcasting and people would stop us in the street and ask for his autograph that I understood it.\"\n\nGolding has her father's helmet, a 1966 oil painting of Aldridge in uniform and a photo of him reading a book to her as a child displayed in her living room.\n\n\"The funny thing is, I never thought to have my dad autograph the helmet,\" she said with a laugh. Her husband, Al, is a Chicago Bears' fan, a fact that never sat well with Lionel Aldridge. \"It makes the Packers-Bears games even more exciting around here. But my dad was never particularly fond of him - like anyone who would date his daughter. No one was ever good enough, especially a Bears fan.\"\n\nGolding said dealing with her dad's mental illness three decades ago was challenging enough, but magnified for someone in the public eye.\n\n\"Back at that time, mental illness was an embarrassing subject to talk about, to admit that someone in your family had it,\" Golding said. \"It was very tough for my mom and us because, like many people, at times my dad didn't think he needed to take his medication for his disease.\n\n\"We'd worry about him, and sometimes have to go find him and pick him up and bring him back home. And being an ex-Packer and broadcaster, everything he did was printed in the newspaper, so it was very difficult.\"\n\nGolding is most proud of the fact that her father helped bring awareness to mental illness and depression.\n\n\"I feel like he became a great spokesman and brought attention to it that helped other people and families dealing with mental illness,\" she said. \"At his funeral, people of all walks of life showed up. I heard so many stories about how he helped them.\"\n\nAldridge was over 400 pounds when he died of heart failure on Feb. 12, 1998, at age 56. More than 300 attended his funeral, including many of his former Packer teammates.\n\nJerry Kramer was one of them.\n\n\"Lionel was from Utah and I was from Idaho, so we're neighbors,\" Kramer said in an interview Sunday. \"I made it a point his rookie season to pump him up, to tell him he could do it. He became a starter, and I wanted him to succeed. We had won championships in 1961 and '62. So I tried to help him, encourage him and pump him up before games.\n\n\"His second season, I stopped being his cheerleader. I didn't think he needed me. . . . I thought with his size, strength and ability he was well on his way.\"\n\nKramer was unknowingly wrong. After both their playing careers were over, when Aldridge was in the broadcast booth, he asked Kramer a startling question.\n\n\"He said, 'How come you dumped me after my rookie year?' \" Kramer related.\n\n\"I said, 'What?' \"\n\n\"He said, 'You got me going, but then you stopped after that first season.' \"\n\n\"I said, 'I didn't think that you needed me anymore. You had it.' I didn't know if I had an impact and didn't want to be a pain in the (expletive) because he was doing fine.\"\n\nKramer visited Aldridge in 1985 when he found out from former defensive tackle Ron Kostelnik that Aldridge was back in Milwaukee after a long absence. Aldridge was working at the post office, sorting mail on the second shift.\n\n\"There was a lot of pain there for me, seeing him sorting mail,\" Kramer said. \"I know he was on the clock, but we sat down and talked. He told me stories about when he was in the streets, and one about paranoid schizophrenia.\n\n\"He had two friends that wanted him to go to the hospital. As a means of getting rid of them, he thought they were the ones who were sick. He went to the hospital but slipped out. He got a couple of blocks away before the cops got him. Then he began to realize, 'Maybe it is me.' \"\n\nKramer said Aldridge looked good and spoke lucidly, and said the two former teammates had a great conversation. \"It was like we were back in the locker room, giggling and laughing,\" Kramer said. \"I was just glad to see him, and that he was doing well.\n\n\"When I went to leave, he walked me to the elevator. As the doors were closing, he said, 'Love you.' \"\n\nAldridge had physical attributes - size, speed and strength - to be successful in the NFL. He had intelligence, a sense of humor and skill with the spoken word. He can thank his grandmother for the latter. As a boy, schoolmates teased him about his speech.\n\n\"Lionel came home crying one day and his grandmother began working with him on his vocabulary and grammar,\" Kramer said. \"He focused on that at a young age. He was a very polished man with a beautiful voice and a great command of words. Perfect for broadcasting.\"\n\nAldridge became interested in sports broadcasting in 1966, after he was approached by WTMJ-AM radio officials to audition for a job.\n\nHe also was coming into his prime as a key player for the talent-rich Packer defense. Aldridge played before the NFL kept official statistics on sacks and tackles, but he always had a nose for the ball and led the Packers in fumble recoveries with a career high of five in 1964 and two in 1966 (tied with five other players).\n\nThe postseason accolades and honors for the Green Bay defensive line were rightfully bestowed upon the left-side tandem of Davis and Henry Jordan, but Aldridge, a right end, warranted consideration for All-Pro and Pro Bowl recognition.\n\nHe would never receive any postseason honors. Aldridge was simply a very good player on some superb teams.\n\nAldridge remained a starter after the retirement of Lombardi, through Phil Bengtson from 1968-'70 and Dan Devine in 1971. He was traded to San Diego and played two seasons with the Chargers before retiring from the game in 1973.\n\nHe rose quickly in sports broadcasting from radio to television, and announced several Packer games in 1975 before signing with NBC as an commentator in 1976. Then his mental illness began to erode his family and career in the ensuing years. After working at the post office for several years, Aldridge supported himself with speaking engagements and as a spokesman for mental health.\n\nHis former wife, Vicky Nelson, said one of Aldridge's proudest moments was his induction into the Packers Hall of Fame in 1988. She said her former husband of 18 years and college sweetheart also has an award named in his honor by the National Organization for Mental Health in Milwaukee.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Lionel didn't get the help for his disease that is available now. No one knew much about mental illness in the 1960s and '70s,\" Nelson said. \"With many diseases, the person stays the same. Not with mental illness. It was very hard for Lionel. It was a process to figure out what was wrong with him and get him help. I'm proud that he helped so many other people. They saw that even a pro athlete can be mentally ill and that it's a disease.\"\n\nThe Lionel Aldridge file\n\nCollege: Utah State.\n\nPacker years: 1963-'71.\n\nPacker highlights: The only player to become a starter his rookie season under Vince Lombardi.

Aldridge was well on his way to becoming a bum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith a business school background at the University of Chicago--pursued during his Packer off-seasons--Davis had become, as he continues to be, one of the most successful beer distributors and radio entrepreneurs in the West.\n\nA former sociology major at Utah State, Aldridge launched an equally impressive career in radio broadcasting and network TV--in the midst of which he was abruptly knocked down, and almost out, by mental illness.\n\nAldridge is a paranoid schizophrenic. But at first, his doctors diagnosed the wrong illness and treated him with the wrong medicine. Within months, he was into the wretched life of a vagrant.\n\nIn the flop houses and rescue missions of America, Aldridge\u2019s nightmare lasted for a ghastly decade, costing him his wife and family, his jobs in radio and television, other jobs, most of his friends, his money, and eventually his self-respect.\n\nIf the people who once knew him best thought of him at all in those days, they thought, very wrongly, that Aldridge was a classic manic depressive--on the loose.\n\nWillie Davis, who runs his many businesses from an office in South-Central Los Angeles, only heard about the nightmare when Aldridge called one day after hitch-hiking into Skid Row downtown, where he touched up his old buddy for $3. Davis gave him $300 and got him a hotel room, from which Aldridge promptly dropped from sight.\n\nThen two years ago, Aldridge telephoned again, this time from Milwaukee. The nightmare was over. He was taking the right medication, Aldridge said. And he was working again, as an account representative at the Milwaukee post office and part-time in radio.\n\nHe was also in a cheerful, new eighth-floor apartment overlooking Lake Michigan on the city\u2019s fashionable East Side.\n\n\u201cLionel had come back from the gates of hell,\u201d Davis said the other day, recalling that phone call in 1985. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a conversation with anyone that affected me that much.\n\n\u201cFor weeks afterward, I would catch myself whistling or humming to myself, and I\u2019d ask, \u2018Why the hell am I feeling so good?\u2019 Then I\u2019d remember: Lionel is back.\u201d\n\nOne day last month at a community college in Milwaukee, Aldridge spent his noon hour away from the post office--as he so often does--on a speaking engagement.\n\nTalking to a roomful of students at Milwaukee Area Technical College, he said:\n\n\u201cI could be mad at somebody because I got sick. It was society that allowed me to become a bum and pull cigarette butts off the streets and out of ash trays.\n\n\u201cAnd I could be angry at God for giving me this disease.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve made a decision not to be bitter. I have done it for one reason. I didn\u2019t get well until I quit blaming God and society--and took the responsibility for myself myself.\n\n\u201cHere I am, a black man, (lecturing) white college students, but I feel very deeply about this. You--all of you--are responsible for you. Nobody is going to ride up and rescue you. . . . I know. . . . I\u2019ve made it back because I learned to lean on myself--and because I learned to like myself.\u201d\n\nHis text, Aldridge said, was from St. Paul\u2019s letters to the Philippians. Reciting a lengthy verse from memory, he said: \u201cWhatsoever things are true, . . . honest . . . just . . . pure . . . lovely . . . think on these things.\u201d\n\nThink on the beautiful, he said, not the untrue.\n\n\u201cOne way to be a winner is to be honest,\u201d Aldridge continued, speaking softly. \u201cHonesty never loses.\n\n\u201cI had a setback, but I never had a drug problem. I gave up for a while, but there was a doctor who believed in me. Now I\u2019m putting it together again--at a pace I\u2019m comfortable with.\u201d\n\nThough Aldridge changes the lyrics each time, the music is always the same. And after this particular 23-minute speech, 18 or 20 listeners came up, as they always do, and crowded around, drawing Aldridge out on his themes of self-esteem and self-responsibility.\n\nAt 6 feet 4 inches and 300 pounds, he was the biggest man in the room, and one of the neatest in slacks and a long-sleeved white shirt. The tie was blue, the jacket light blue, the expression pleasant and dignified. At 46, Aldridge has the bearing and baritone voice of a cultured talk-show host.\n\nHe\u2019s also a working man, though. Looking at his watch, he smiled and said goodby.\n\nDriving back to the post office in his red Pontiac Firebird--\u201dIt fit me till last January, when I quit smoking and gained 50 pounds\u201d--Aldridge said:\n\n\u201cThere is no known cure for paranoid schizophrenia, but I am one of the lucky ones. The disease is in remission. I have largely recovered.\n\n\u201cI have been given some time--and I\u2019m going to use it to help others. And to help reduce the stigma of mental illness. And to encourage the commitment of more money and resources to (mental illness) research.\u201d\n\nWhat about his personal commitments?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a girlfriend right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI go out once in a while--but to manage a steady would take more time than I have to give.\n\n\u201cMy ex-wife . . . none of this is her fault. She\u2019s about to be remarried . . .\n\n\u201cI see my children now and then. The younger one is a soccer player in (a Milwaukee) high school. The older one is a freshman at (the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee). I love them dearly . . . \u201c\n\nThe subject was painful, and he changed it.\n\n\u201cI feel that I must give as much of me as I can to the post office, to WTMJ, and to the speeches (before youth groups and at mental-illness meetings).\u201d\n\nWTMJ is Milwaukee\u2019s big radio-TV complex. Aldridge worked there before the nightmare and the station has welcomed him home as its Saturday morning sports announcer.\n\nIn addition, after Packer games, he doubles as analyst and talk-show host on still another WTMJ program.\n\nDuring the week, he\u2019s on full time at the post office, where, as an executive in technical sales, he helps the government fight its many private-sector competitors for the nation\u2019s mail and parcel business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun, but it\u2019s a full schedule,\u201d he said.\n\nAt times it even gets hectic.\n\n\u201cThis year we\u2019ve called on Lionel to make all of our television commercials,\u201d said Mike Mahnke, the post office\u2019s division communications manager. \u201cHe does a first-rate job, too.\u201d\n\nAt his desk in a large sales room, Aldridge seems as fond of his co-workers as they are of him.\n\nOnce a week, he said, he is \u201cvisited by the support people from the hospital. . . . And the doctor sees me twice a month.\u201d\n\nPsychiatrists disagree on what causes Aldridge\u2019s kind of mental illness. They say it may stem either from heredity or environment, according to Dr. Charles William Wahl, clinical professor of psychiatry at the UCLA School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cSome think a predisposition . . . is in the (genes),\u201d Wahl said. \u201cOthers, like myself, feel it\u2019s a reaction to the traumas of early life. It may be partly both.\n\n\u201cStress is usually a factor. Stress . . . can make or break you. As Nietzsche said, \u2018Those things that do not kill me make me stronger.\u2019\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of variation in the prognosis, and there are no guarantees, but a cooperative and motivated patient has a better (chance).\u201d\n\nCooperative, motivated. And helpful, sincere, caring. Unselfish. Glad to be alive. As he looks into the blank face of the future, Aldridge, now, is all of those.\n\nA LIFE OF TENSION AND TURMOIL\n\nAn orphan figuratively if not literally, an only child, he grew up in other people\u2019s homes, the homes of relatives who had big families of their own. Then for nine years in pro football, he came under the influence of a dominating, uncompromising individual, the Lombardi of the legends. Indeed, Lionel Aldridge has known stress.\n\nThe Louisiana Years: The world began for Aldridge in the disheartening, steaming fields of the rural South. Born in Evergreen, La., he was the baby in the home of his grandfather, Aaron Compton, a sharecropper.\n\nOne of the Compton daughters, Bessie Blackman, Aldridge\u2019s aunt, said: \u201cLionel was born in our house one night. There were 10 (children) in our family, 8 girls and 2 boys--and Lionel made 11.\u201d\n\nEveryone shared equally, as Aldridge tells it. \u201cBut I was on edge all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were good to me. There was a lot of love there. But I walked a tightrope every day.\u201d\n\nEarly on, his mother left town, following his father to the Midwest.\n\n\u201cLionel was lucky in his grandmother,\u201d Blackman said. \u201cShe even made his pants, and that isn\u2019t easy. She would sew all night so we\u2019d have a dress to wear in the morning. Then she\u2019d go out and work all day in the fields.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d wake up to the smell of beans cooking at 4 o\u2019clock in the morning. She was always up and making sure we\u2019d have something to eat for breakfast.\u201d\n\nLionel hated field work. His one big interest was school. He made good grades and, as a sixth-grader, he decided that he would go to college some day. He can\u2019t remember who influenced him. In Louisiana, though, he never missed an hour of school until the afternoon that disaster struck.\n\n\u201cLionel had been out playing in the rain,\u201d said Norma Lawson, another aunt. \u201cHe came in and said in a shaky voice, \u2018Papa, a snake bit me.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a phone or a car in those days, so his grandfather ran all the way to town to get the doctor. The leg was so swollen by the time they got back that Lionel barely survived. He couldn\u2019t walk for weeks.\u201d\n\nHe cried much of the time.\n\n\u201cThere were rumors that I\u2019d died,\u201d Aldridge remembers.\n\nLawson said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t dying that worried him. The thing that made him cry was missing school.\u201d\n\nThen real trouble hit. When he was 15, his grandfather died, and Lionel was bundled off again, this time to far away Pittsburg, Calif., near San Francisco, to live with his Aunt Bessie, who had moved from the South.\n\nThe Pittsburg Years: On his second morning in California, despondency drove Aldridge back to bed.\n\n\u201cI finally got it out of him,\u201d Blackman said. \u201cHe felt bad because he didn\u2019t know how to comb the children\u2019s hair. He wanted to help me, but couldn\u2019t. . . . We loved him, but he thought he was imposing on us.\u201d\n\nAnd in a sense, of course, he was. The Blackmans, Bessie and Benjamin, had six children of their own. \u201cI saw them all off to college,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery one.\u201d\n\nShe and her husband also raised 8 other children, or 14 in all, most at the same time.\n\n\u201cTwo of my sisters came to live with us, then two nephews, three nieces, and Lionel,\u201d she said. \u201cThey slept all over the house. We started with three bedrooms and had to add two more, and close in the patio.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Blackman, a retired millwright at U.S. Steel, remembers that Lionel had been in the Pittsburg household only a few days when he came around and asked to be sent back to Louisiana.\n\n\u201cHe thought I had too many children already,\u201d his Uncle Benjamin said. \u201cI knew he didn\u2019t want to go. There was no place for him to go. So I told him I wouldn\u2019t send him.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I can\u2019t give you much, but I\u2019ll give you what my family have.\u2019\n\n\u201cI told him, \u2018I only have three rules here. First, go to school. Second, pick out nice friends--nobody carries a big knife around me. And third, don\u2019t ask for my car.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAldridge never felt really comfortable in Pittsburg. For one thing, everybody expected him to go out for the high school football team because he was the biggest kid in town.\n\nTrouble was, he\u2019d never played football. In his first 16 years, he\u2019d hardly even seen a football, let alone a game.\n\n\u201cSo I taught him,\u201d his Uncle Benjamin said. \u201cI\u2019d never played football myself, either, but I\u2019d watched it on the TV. I took him out back and taught him.\u201d\n\nAlmost every night after that, after school, Lionel came home from football practice with his stomach hurting. Once or twice, the pain was so intense that he couldn\u2019t sleep.\n\n\u201cI decided to drive by and see what the hell kind of a football team that was,\u201d Blackman said. \u201cAnd there was Lionel, the biggest guy on the team, running around blocking everybody with his stomach.\n\n\u201cSo I had to give him one more lesson,\u201d Blackman said.\n\nWithin a week, Aldridge was the team\u2019s best player.\n\nThe College Years: If he could go back and do it again, Aldridge would doubtless choose a different school. In the early \u201860s, he wasn\u2019t ready for mostly white Utah State, which was in mostly Mormon, mostly white, Logan, Utah.\n\nHis high school coach, however, had taken a job there and immediately arranged a scholarship for Aldridge. And there he was, a curiosity symbol in a radically different culture.\n\n\u201cKids saw me coming, they\u2019d say, \u2018Here comes the chocolate man,\u2019 \u201d Aldridge remembers.\n\nMore tension. And still more to come.\n\nHank Stoddard, sports director at WTMJ, one of Wisconsin\u2019s most prominent radio personalities and one of Aldridge\u2019s steadfast friends in Milwaukee, has tried to put himself in Aldridge\u2019s shoes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 1960,\u201d Stoddard said. \u201cWho do you date at Utah State? How many colors are there?\u201d\n\nAldridge first saw her in a sociology class, the sunny, young, white Mormon woman who was to become his wife.\n\n\u201cOur relationship put us under a lot of pressure,\u201d Vicky Aldridge told Milwaukee magazine later, describing the turmoil at Utah State, and the reaction of her parents, who at first refused to speak with her.\n\n\u201cMy father was very religious, and the dean of the school was a personal friend of my father\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cHe used to call us into his office and threaten to kick us out of school if we didn\u2019t break (up).\u201d\n\nStoddard gives Lombardi the credit for making life bearable for Lionel and Vicky in Green Bay, where blacks are few, even today, and inter-racial couples were practically unheard of in the \u201860s.\n\n\u201cLombardi told them, \u2018I\u2019m with you guys,\u2019 \u201d Stoddard recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018If anybody gives you a hard time, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNonetheless, according to Vicky Aldridge, the NFL tried to block their wedding. That was after Lionel was drafted by the Packers but before they\u2019d taken their case to Lombardi.\n\n\u201cThe NFL commissioner, Pete Rozelle, didn\u2019t want us to get married because he feared an adverse reaction in the press,\u201d she told Milwaukee magazine. \u201cHe even flew to Green Bay to try to talk us out of it.\u201d\n\nNobody could talk them out of it. \u201cNothing could break them up,\u201d Stoddard said.\n\nThe Lombardi Years: In 1963, for a fourth-round draft choice with a white wife, life wasn\u2019t a bowl of cherries in Green Bay. It would have been tough enough for a fourth-round bachelor. The Packers were by then a veteran championship team. Lombardi had already coached them to two of the five NFL titles they won in that decade.\n\nWhat saved Aldridge was his talent. As a defensive player, he proved to be one of the best of his era, one of the most valuable of the champion Packers.\n\n\u201cWillie Davis was flashier,\u201d said Dan Devine, who coached the Packers later. \u201cNobody was steadier than Lionel Aldridge.\u201d\n\nEvery down was like the Super Bowl to Aldridge, teammates said. There was a day in Los Angeles, for instance, when he kept coming in the final minutes of a game that the Packers were losing by a runaway score.\n\nIt was third and two, and as Ram running back Willie Ellison started around end--on the hottest afternoon of the year in the Coliseum--Aldridge went after him. Most of the other Packers had plainly quit for the day, and even Aldridge was running out of gas, but he kept chasing Ellison until he caught him at the sideline after a gain of less than a yard.\n\n\u201cConsidering the circumstances, that was one of the 10 greatest plays I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Devine said afterward.\n\nStill, it\u2019s in the record that as a rookie, Aldridge had come to Green Bay as the youngest of the Packers. And he had brought his gentle nature with him. Some say that he might have been too young and too gentle for that tough, veteran team.\n\nOn rookie night at his first training camp, he was obviously uncomfortable as most of the new players clowned around and sang comical, off-key versions of their school songs.\n\nWhen the veterans called on Aldridge, he stood stiffly, hands at his sides, eyes straight ahead, and gave a serious rendition of a Utah State song in an all but inaudible voice.\n\nWillie Davis, recalling that night, said: \u201cI asked myself, what\u2019s a serious one like this guy doing here?\u201d\n\nThe team found out a week later, when Lombardi made it clear that there was a place for either Aldridge or a Packer veteran, Urban Henry. Not both. That upset Henry\u2019s buddies.\n\n\u201cAlmost everybody resented me except Lombardi,\u201d Aldridge said. \u201cAnd Lombardi overpowered me. Just walking into a room, he scared me.\u201d\n\nAldridge learned that he, and not Henry, had made the team when he read it in the paper.\n\nDoubting whether to believe it, he was walking into the Packer dormitory that night, eyes lowered, when he felt a tap on the shoulder.\n\nTurning, he looked squarely into the face of Lombardi, who told him: \u201cNobody ever came up here and made the club the way you did.\u201d\n\nSpeechless at the time, Aldridge said later: \u201cAt that moment, I needed that. And (Lombardi) knew it. He knew exactly how to manipulate his players--his success wasn\u2019t an accident. But he was scary to play for.\u201d\n\nIN THE GRIP OF A CRUEL DISEASE\n\nSchizophrenia: \u201cA major mental disorder of unknown cause typically characterized by . . . a distortion of reality accompanied by delusions, hallucinations (and) bizarre behavior, etc., often with no loss of basic intellectual functions.\u201d --Webster\u2019s New World dictionary\n\nIn the days when Aldridge was still on the farm and going to grade school in Louisiana, a teacher asked him a question one day in class.\n\nReplying politely, he said: \u201cI ain\u2019t sittin\u2019 on nan part of the chair.\u201d\n\nThe other kids all laughed, and Aldridge squirmed. \u201cIt was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life,\u201d he said later.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t realized that my grandfather had his own language. I thought everybody talked that way.\u201d\n\nAldridge vowed then to learn proper English. \u201cI made it my first priority,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough, of course, I didn\u2019t know what a priority was in those days.\u201d\n\nHe does now. And he has become the good speaker he wanted to be.\n\n\u201cLionel is known for that God-given voice,\u201d said Shirley Leonard, a Packer spokeswoman.\n\nDan Devine said: \u201cOne thing everybody notices about Lionel is that he\u2019s as well-spoken as he is soft-spoken.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he is obviously a professional, a natural, on either radio or TV. As a commentator, Aldridge comes right to the point, and when he does, he has something to say.\n\n\u201cLionel is one of the top football analysts,\u201d Stoddard said. \u201cHe has a knack for it. Getting a chance (as a commentator) is his problem.\u201d\n\nIt is now. It wasn\u2019t before mental illness struck him down. One day he was a rising professional, appearing on network television. The next he was out on the streets, hallucinating, behaving strangely. Considering the kind of ability he had shown in the communications field, he could hardly have been attacked by a more disastrous disease.\n\nThat is the nature of paranoid schizophrenia. Most serious illnesses are dreadful. This one torments in a particularly cruel way.\n\n\u201cWhen you feel perfect, when you feel as good as you can feel, that\u2019s when you\u2019re getting into trouble,\u201d Aldridge said. \u201cFor a (schizophrenic), happiness is the dawn of real trouble.\u201d\n\nFeeling well often leads the patient to abandon therapy. \u201cYou feel so good that you know you don\u2019t need any more medication,\u201d Aldridge recalls sadly.\n\nAt UCLA, Dr. Wahl said that treatment consists of talk therapy as well as medication.\n\n\u201cYou have to understand your past if you are to change it,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, you\u2019re just covering up the problem (with medicine). Of course, medication is (essential).\u201d\n\nAldridge is one of the many who can attest to that. For he was on and off medication several times--and had been burned every time he got off it--before he bowed to his illness.\n\n\u201cToday, any time I start to feel I\u2019ve got it together, I throttle it down,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to learn a whole new ballgame. When I was on the bum, I felt great.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/lionel-aldridge", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nLionel Aldridge was born on 14 February, 1941 in Evergreen, Louisiana, USA, is an Actor.

At least once, he picked it up and slammed it against the sidewalk. The dog was injured but not killed. Aldridge had missed his 5:15 and 6:15 radio shows.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I did that,\u201d Aldridge recalled, \u201cit was something I thought I needed to do, because I was listening to voices.\u201d\n\nAldridge knew he was in trouble, but he left the hospital after a week and returned to work. Things went badly. He took many leaves from WTMJ and had many relapses.\n\nAs a player, he never drank or used drugs of any kind, but now he was hearing voices unheard by others, and the best way to drown them out was to drug them into silence.\n\nOn a fall weekend in 1978 the Packers were in San Diego for a game against the Chargers.\n\nThe night before the game, well past midnight, Milwaukee Journal writer Dave Begel was startled by a thunderous banging on his door. \u201cI opened it,\u201d said Begel, \u201cand there was Lionel, holding a bottle of Scotch and a handful of pills.\n\nHe walked through the room, out to the balcony, and sat there drinking and taking pills.\n\n\u201cWhen he said anything, it was just gibberish, like some foreign language. He wasn\u2019t talking to me. Then he came in and sat on the bed and watched TV. I sat there and waited and waited.\n\n\u201cThe sun was coming up when he got up and said, \u2018I\u2019m going now,\u2019 and left. I saw him an hour before game time and he was okay and did his job. But he was obviously very disturbed.\u201d\n\nAldridge hung on to his job for a while, but by 1981 he was down and out, having plummeted from the heights of the Super Bowl to the depths of the gutter.\n\nOne night on a nondescript city street, he carefully removed his three-diamond Super Bowl ring, put it in his pocket and went to sleep. The ring was the most valuable possession he owned. In the morning it was gone.\n\nHe checked himself in and out of hospitals. A suicide attempt failed. He hitch-hiked across the country, looking for work and sometimes finding it.\n\nThere was a counseling job at a Utah prison; he couldn\u2019t handle it. Arriving after the football season started at his Alma Mater Utah State, he was given a job as an assistant coach.\n\nIt lasted only until the season ended. He continued to drift, doing odd jobs when they came his way.\n\nHis wife had divorced him and taken the children to California. That was all right with him. He wanted some distance between them and him as long as he was in this condition. He did not know how long that would be."}, {"url": "https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/A/AldrLi20.htm", "page_content": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhen was Lionel Aldridge born?\n\nLionel Aldridge was born on February 14, 1941.\n\nWhere was Lionel Aldridge born?\n\nLionel Aldridge was born in Evergreen, LA.\n\nHow tall was Lionel Aldridge?\n\nLionel Aldridge was 6-3 (190 cm) tall.\n\nHow much did Lionel Aldridge weigh when playing?\n\nLionel Aldridge weighed 254 lbs (115 kg) when playing.\n\nIs Lionel Aldridge in the Hall of Fame?\n\nLionel Aldridge has not been elected into the Hall of Fame.\n\nHow many games did Lionel Aldridge play?\n\nLionel Aldridge played 147 games over his career.\n\nHow many sacks did Lionel Aldridge have?\n\nLionel Aldridge had 69.5 sacks over his career.\n\nHow many Super Bowls has Lionel Aldridge won?\n\nLionel Aldridge won 2 Super Bowls.\n\nWhen did Lionel Aldridge retire?\n\nLionel Aldridge last played in 1973."}, {"url": "https://popularbio.com/lionel-aldridge/", "page_content": "Updated On April 30, 2023\n\nLionel Aldridge estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.

During Lombardi's nine years as coach of the Packers, Lionel Aldridge was the only rookie to start a season opener.\n\nAlthough Aldridge might have been more steady than spectacular over the course of his career, Lombardi's early faith in him was a tribute in itself. In fact, Aldridge started the first 45 games of his career under Lombardi before missing the fourth game of the 1966 season with an ankle injury.\n\nAfter the Packers won a second consecutive NFL championship in 1962, Lombardi traded veteran Bill Quinlan and created an opening at right defensive end with no obvious heir apparent. Veteran free agent Urban Henry, who wasn't re-signed by the Los Angeles Rams after missing the 1962 season with a neck injury, and No. 1 draft pick Dave Robinson were considered the frontrunners heading into camp. However, the Packers decided to play Robinson at linebacker when he reported late following the College All-Star Game and Aldridge beat out Henry.\n\nAldridge came into his own when the Packers won an unprecedented three straight NFL championships under the league's playoff format from 1965 to 1967. He started all eight postseason games during that stretch and then continued to hold forth at right end until midway through the 1971 season.\n\nOver his eight-and-a-half years as an established starter, Aldridge missed only three games, a notable achievement when you consider he broke his leg once and had some ankle issues. The worst of his injuries occurred in a mid-August preseason game in 1967 when Aldridge broke a bone in his lower left leg. He missed only the first two regular-season games, didn't start but appeared in the third, and then played roughly three-quarters of the game in a hard-fought victory over Detroit in Week 4. Lombardi, who had little compassion for injured players and rarely saluted them when they played hurt, heaped praise on Aldridge after the game. \"Aldridge deserves a lot of credit for the way he came back so fast from his injury,\" Lombardi said."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lionel_Aldridge", "page_content": "Dear Wikiwand AI, let's keep it short by simply answering these key questions:\n\nCan you list the top facts and stats about Lionel Aldridge?\n\nSummarize this article for a 10 years old"}, {"url": "https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/A/AldrLi20.htm", "page_content": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhen was Lionel Aldridge born?\n\nLionel Aldridge was born on February 14, 1941.\n\nWhere was Lionel Aldridge born?\n\nLionel Aldridge was born in Evergreen, LA.\n\nHow tall was Lionel Aldridge?\n\nLionel Aldridge was 6-3 (190 cm) tall.\n\nHow much did Lionel Aldridge weigh when playing?\n\nLionel Aldridge weighed 254 lbs (115 kg) when playing.\n\nIs Lionel Aldridge in the Hall of Fame?\n\nLionel Aldridge has not been elected into the Hall of Fame.\n\nHow many games did Lionel Aldridge play?\n\nLionel Aldridge played 147 games over his career.\n\nHow many sacks did Lionel Aldridge have?\n\nLionel Aldridge had 69.5 sacks over his career.\n\nHow many Super Bowls has Lionel Aldridge won?\n\nLionel Aldridge won 2 Super Bowls.\n\nWhen did Lionel Aldridge retire?\n\nLionel Aldridge last played in 1973."}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-10-27-sp-16847-story.html", "page_content": "Times Staff Writer\n\nAs professional athletes 20 years ago, Lionel Aldridge and Willie Davis were the defensive ends on one of the great football teams of all time, Vince Lombardi\u2019s Green Bay Packers, winners of Super Bowls I and II.\n\nYears later, out of football, they wound up traveling widely divergent paths.\n\nBy 1977, Davis was a millionaire. Aldridge was well on his way to becoming a bum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith a business school background at the University of Chicago--pursued during his Packer off-seasons--Davis had become, as he continues to be, one of the most successful beer distributors and radio entrepreneurs in the West.\n\nA former sociology major at Utah State, Aldridge launched an equally impressive career in radio broadcasting and network TV--in the midst of which he was abruptly knocked down, and almost out, by mental illness.\n\nAldridge is a paranoid schizophrenic. But at first, his doctors diagnosed the wrong illness and treated him with the wrong medicine. Within months, he was into the wretched life of a vagrant.\n\nIn the flop houses and rescue missions of America, Aldridge\u2019s nightmare lasted for a ghastly decade, costing him his wife and family, his jobs in radio and television, other jobs, most of his friends, his money, and eventually his self-respect.\n\nIf the people who once knew him best thought of him at all in those days, they thought, very wrongly, that Aldridge was a classic manic depressive--on the loose.\n\nWillie Davis, who runs his many businesses from an office in South-Central Los Angeles, only heard about the nightmare when Aldridge called one day after hitch-hiking into Skid Row downtown, where he touched up his old buddy for $3. Davis gave him $300 and got him a hotel room, from which Aldridge promptly dropped from sight.\n\nThen two years ago, Aldridge telephoned again, this time from Milwaukee. The nightmare was over. He was taking the right medication, Aldridge said. And he was working again, as an account representative at the Milwaukee post office and part-time in radio.\n\nHe was also in a cheerful, new eighth-floor apartment overlooking Lake Michigan on the city\u2019s fashionable East Side.\n\n\u201cLionel had come back from the gates of hell,\u201d Davis said the other day, recalling that phone call in 1985. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a conversation with anyone that affected me that much.\n\n\u201cFor weeks afterward, I would catch myself whistling or humming to myself, and I\u2019d ask, \u2018Why the hell am I feeling so good?\u2019 Then I\u2019d remember: Lionel is back.\u201d\n\nOne day last month at a community college in Milwaukee, Aldridge spent his noon hour away from the post office--as he so often does--on a speaking engagement.\n\nTalking to a roomful of students at Milwaukee Area Technical College, he said:\n\n\u201cI could be mad at somebody because I got sick. It was society that allowed me to become a bum and pull cigarette butts off the streets and out of ash trays.\n\n\u201cAnd I could be angry at God for giving me this disease.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve made a decision not to be bitter. I have done it for one reason. I didn\u2019t get well until I quit blaming God and society--and took the responsibility for myself myself.\n\n\u201cHere I am, a black man, (lecturing) white college students, but I feel very deeply about this. You--all of you--are responsible for you. Nobody is going to ride up and rescue you. . . . I know. . . . I\u2019ve made it back because I learned to lean on myself--and because I learned to like myself.\u201d\n\nHis text, Aldridge said, was from St. Paul\u2019s letters to the Philippians. Reciting a lengthy verse from memory, he said: \u201cWhatsoever things are true, . . . honest . . . just . . . pure . . . lovely . . . think on these things.\u201d\n\nThink on the beautiful, he said, not the untrue.\n\n\u201cOne way to be a winner is to be honest,\u201d Aldridge continued, speaking softly. \u201cHonesty never loses.\n\n\u201cI had a setback, but I never had a drug problem. I gave up for a while, but there was a doctor who believed in me. Now I\u2019m putting it together again--at a pace I\u2019m comfortable with.\u201d\n\nThough Aldridge changes the lyrics each time, the music is always the same. And after this particular 23-minute speech, 18 or 20 listeners came up, as they always do, and crowded around, drawing Aldridge out on his themes of self-esteem and self-responsibility.\n\nAt 6 feet 4 inches and 300 pounds, he was the biggest man in the room, and one of the neatest in slacks and a long-sleeved white shirt. The tie was blue, the jacket light blue, the expression pleasant and dignified. At 46, Aldridge has the bearing and baritone voice of a cultured talk-show host.\n\nHe\u2019s also a working man, though. Looking at his watch, he smiled and said goodby.\n\nDriving back to the post office in his red Pontiac Firebird--\u201dIt fit me till last January, when I quit smoking and gained 50 pounds\u201d--Aldridge said:\n\n\u201cThere is no known cure for paranoid schizophrenia, but I am one of the lucky ones. The disease is in remission. I have largely recovered.\n\n\u201cI have been given some time--and I\u2019m going to use it to help others. And to help reduce the stigma of mental illness. And to encourage the commitment of more money and resources to (mental illness) research.\u201d\n\nWhat about his personal commitments?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a girlfriend right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI go out once in a while--but to manage a steady would take more time than I have to give.\n\n\u201cMy ex-wife . . . none of this is her fault. She\u2019s about to be remarried . . .\n\n\u201cI see my children now and then. The younger one is a soccer player in (a Milwaukee) high school. The older one is a freshman at (the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee). I love them dearly . . . \u201c\n\nThe subject was painful, and he changed it.\n\n\u201cI feel that I must give as much of me as I can to the post office, to WTMJ, and to the speeches (before youth groups and at mental-illness meetings).\u201d\n\nWTMJ is Milwaukee\u2019s big radio-TV complex. Aldridge worked there before the nightmare and the station has welcomed him home as its Saturday morning sports announcer.\n\nIn addition, after Packer games, he doubles as analyst and talk-show host on still another WTMJ program.\n\nDuring the week, he\u2019s on full time at the post office, where, as an executive in technical sales, he helps the government fight its many private-sector competitors for the nation\u2019s mail and parcel business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun, but it\u2019s a full schedule,\u201d he said.\n\nAt times it even gets hectic.\n\n\u201cThis year we\u2019ve called on Lionel to make all of our television commercials,\u201d said Mike Mahnke, the post office\u2019s division communications manager. \u201cHe does a first-rate job, too.\u201d\n\nAt his desk in a large sales room, Aldridge seems as fond of his co-workers as they are of him.\n\nOnce a week, he said, he is \u201cvisited by the support people from the hospital. . . . And the doctor sees me twice a month.\u201d\n\nPsychiatrists disagree on what causes Aldridge\u2019s kind of mental illness. They say it may stem either from heredity or environment, according to Dr. Charles William Wahl, clinical professor of psychiatry at the UCLA School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cSome think a predisposition . . . is in the (genes),\u201d Wahl said. \u201cOthers, like myself, feel it\u2019s a reaction to the traumas of early life. It may be partly both.\n\n\u201cStress is usually a factor. Stress . . . can make or break you. As Nietzsche said, \u2018Those things that do not kill me make me stronger.\u2019\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of variation in the prognosis, and there are no guarantees, but a cooperative and motivated patient has a better (chance).\u201d\n\nCooperative, motivated. And helpful, sincere, caring. Unselfish. Glad to be alive. As he looks into the blank face of the future, Aldridge, now, is all of those.\n\nA LIFE OF TENSION AND TURMOIL\n\nAn orphan figuratively if not literally, an only child, he grew up in other people\u2019s homes, the homes of relatives who had big families of their own. Then for nine years in pro football, he came under the influence of a dominating, uncompromising individual, the Lombardi of the legends. Indeed, Lionel Aldridge has known stress.\n\nThe Louisiana Years: The world began for Aldridge in the disheartening, steaming fields of the rural South. Born in Evergreen, La., he was the baby in the home of his grandfather, Aaron Compton, a sharecropper.\n\nOne of the Compton daughters, Bessie Blackman, Aldridge\u2019s aunt, said: \u201cLionel was born in our house one night. There were 10 (children) in our family, 8 girls and 2 boys--and Lionel made 11.\u201d\n\nEveryone shared equally, as Aldridge tells it. \u201cBut I was on edge all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were good to me. There was a lot of love there. But I walked a tightrope every day.\u201d\n\nEarly on, his mother left town, following his father to the Midwest.\n\n\u201cLionel was lucky in his grandmother,\u201d Blackman said. \u201cShe even made his pants, and that isn\u2019t easy. She would sew all night so we\u2019d have a dress to wear in the morning. Then she\u2019d go out and work all day in the fields.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d wake up to the smell of beans cooking at 4 o\u2019clock in the morning. She was always up and making sure we\u2019d have something to eat for breakfast.\u201d\n\nLionel hated field work. His one big interest was school. He made good grades and, as a sixth-grader, he decided that he would go to college some day. He can\u2019t remember who influenced him. In Louisiana, though, he never missed an hour of school until the afternoon that disaster struck.\n\n\u201cLionel had been out playing in the rain,\u201d said Norma Lawson, another aunt. \u201cHe came in and said in a shaky voice, \u2018Papa, a snake bit me.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a phone or a car in those days, so his grandfather ran all the way to town to get the doctor. The leg was so swollen by the time they got back that Lionel barely survived. He couldn\u2019t walk for weeks.\u201d\n\nHe cried much of the time.\n\n\u201cThere were rumors that I\u2019d died,\u201d Aldridge remembers.\n\nLawson said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t dying that worried him. The thing that made him cry was missing school.\u201d\n\nThen real trouble hit. When he was 15, his grandfather died, and Lionel was bundled off again, this time to far away Pittsburg, Calif., near San Francisco, to live with his Aunt Bessie, who had moved from the South.\n\nThe Pittsburg Years: On his second morning in California, despondency drove Aldridge back to bed.\n\n\u201cI finally got it out of him,\u201d Blackman said. \u201cHe felt bad because he didn\u2019t know how to comb the children\u2019s hair. He wanted to help me, but couldn\u2019t. . . . We loved him, but he thought he was imposing on us.\u201d\n\nAnd in a sense, of course, he was. The Blackmans, Bessie and Benjamin, had six children of their own. \u201cI saw them all off to college,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery one.\u201d\n\nShe and her husband also raised 8 other children, or 14 in all, most at the same time.\n\n\u201cTwo of my sisters came to live with us, then two nephews, three nieces, and Lionel,\u201d she said. \u201cThey slept all over the house. We started with three bedrooms and had to add two more, and close in the patio.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Blackman, a retired millwright at U.S. Steel, remembers that Lionel had been in the Pittsburg household only a few days when he came around and asked to be sent back to Louisiana.\n\n\u201cHe thought I had too many children already,\u201d his Uncle Benjamin said. \u201cI knew he didn\u2019t want to go. There was no place for him to go. So I told him I wouldn\u2019t send him.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I can\u2019t give you much, but I\u2019ll give you what my family have.\u2019\n\n\u201cI told him, \u2018I only have three rules here. First, go to school. Second, pick out nice friends--nobody carries a big knife around me. And third, don\u2019t ask for my car.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAldridge never felt really comfortable in Pittsburg. For one thing, everybody expected him to go out for the high school football team because he was the biggest kid in town.\n\nTrouble was, he\u2019d never played football. In his first 16 years, he\u2019d hardly even seen a football, let alone a game.\n\n\u201cSo I taught him,\u201d his Uncle Benjamin said. \u201cI\u2019d never played football myself, either, but I\u2019d watched it on the TV. I took him out back and taught him.\u201d\n\nAlmost every night after that, after school, Lionel came home from football practice with his stomach hurting. Once or twice, the pain was so intense that he couldn\u2019t sleep.\n\n\u201cI decided to drive by and see what the hell kind of a football team that was,\u201d Blackman said. \u201cAnd there was Lionel, the biggest guy on the team, running around blocking everybody with his stomach.\n\n\u201cSo I had to give him one more lesson,\u201d Blackman said.\n\nWithin a week, Aldridge was the team\u2019s best player.\n\nThe College Years: If he could go back and do it again, Aldridge would doubtless choose a different school. In the early \u201860s, he wasn\u2019t ready for mostly white Utah State, which was in mostly Mormon, mostly white, Logan, Utah.\n\nHis high school coach, however, had taken a job there and immediately arranged a scholarship for Aldridge. And there he was, a curiosity symbol in a radically different culture.\n\n\u201cKids saw me coming, they\u2019d say, \u2018Here comes the chocolate man,\u2019 \u201d Aldridge remembers.\n\nMore tension. And still more to come.\n\nHank Stoddard, sports director at WTMJ, one of Wisconsin\u2019s most prominent radio personalities and one of Aldridge\u2019s steadfast friends in Milwaukee, has tried to put himself in Aldridge\u2019s shoes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 1960,\u201d Stoddard said. \u201cWho do you date at Utah State? How many colors are there?\u201d\n\nAldridge first saw her in a sociology class, the sunny, young, white Mormon woman who was to become his wife.\n\n\u201cOur relationship put us under a lot of pressure,\u201d Vicky Aldridge told Milwaukee magazine later, describing the turmoil at Utah State, and the reaction of her parents, who at first refused to speak with her.\n\n\u201cMy father was very religious, and the dean of the school was a personal friend of my father\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cHe used to call us into his office and threaten to kick us out of school if we didn\u2019t break (up).\u201d\n\nStoddard gives Lombardi the credit for making life bearable for Lionel and Vicky in Green Bay, where blacks are few, even today, and inter-racial couples were practically unheard of in the \u201860s.\n\n\u201cLombardi told them, \u2018I\u2019m with you guys,\u2019 \u201d Stoddard recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018If anybody gives you a hard time, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNonetheless, according to Vicky Aldridge, the NFL tried to block their wedding. That was after Lionel was drafted by the Packers but before they\u2019d taken their case to Lombardi.\n\n\u201cThe NFL commissioner, Pete Rozelle, didn\u2019t want us to get married because he feared an adverse reaction in the press,\u201d she told Milwaukee magazine. \u201cHe even flew to Green Bay to try to talk us out of it.\u201d\n\nNobody could talk them out of it. \u201cNothing could break them up,\u201d Stoddard said.\n\nThe Lombardi Years: In 1963, for a fourth-round draft choice with a white wife, life wasn\u2019t a bowl of cherries in Green Bay. It would have been tough enough for a fourth-round bachelor. The Packers were by then a veteran championship team. Lombardi had already coached them to two of the five NFL titles they won in that decade.\n\nWhat saved Aldridge was his talent. As a defensive player, he proved to be one of the best of his era, one of the most valuable of the champion Packers.\n\n\u201cWillie Davis was flashier,\u201d said Dan Devine, who coached the Packers later. \u201cNobody was steadier than Lionel Aldridge.\u201d\n\nEvery down was like the Super Bowl to Aldridge, teammates said. There was a day in Los Angeles, for instance, when he kept coming in the final minutes of a game that the Packers were losing by a runaway score.\n\nIt was third and two, and as Ram running back Willie Ellison started around end--on the hottest afternoon of the year in the Coliseum--Aldridge went after him. Most of the other Packers had plainly quit for the day, and even Aldridge was running out of gas, but he kept chasing Ellison until he caught him at the sideline after a gain of less than a yard.\n\n\u201cConsidering the circumstances, that was one of the 10 greatest plays I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Devine said afterward.\n\nStill, it\u2019s in the record that as a rookie, Aldridge had come to Green Bay as the youngest of the Packers. And he had brought his gentle nature with him. Some say that he might have been too young and too gentle for that tough, veteran team.\n\nOn rookie night at his first training camp, he was obviously uncomfortable as most of the new players clowned around and sang comical, off-key versions of their school songs.\n\nWhen the veterans called on Aldridge, he stood stiffly, hands at his sides, eyes straight ahead, and gave a serious rendition of a Utah State song in an all but inaudible voice.\n\nWillie Davis, recalling that night, said: \u201cI asked myself, what\u2019s a serious one like this guy doing here?\u201d\n\nThe team found out a week later, when Lombardi made it clear that there was a place for either Aldridge or a Packer veteran, Urban Henry. Not both. That upset Henry\u2019s buddies.\n\n\u201cAlmost everybody resented me except Lombardi,\u201d Aldridge said. \u201cAnd Lombardi overpowered me. Just walking into a room, he scared me.\u201d\n\nAldridge learned that he, and not Henry, had made the team when he read it in the paper.\n\nDoubting whether to believe it, he was walking into the Packer dormitory that night, eyes lowered, when he felt a tap on the shoulder.\n\nTurning, he looked squarely into the face of Lombardi, who told him: \u201cNobody ever came up here and made the club the way you did.\u201d\n\nSpeechless at the time, Aldridge said later: \u201cAt that moment, I needed that. And (Lombardi) knew it. He knew exactly how to manipulate his players--his success wasn\u2019t an accident. But he was scary to play for.\u201d\n\nIN THE GRIP OF A CRUEL DISEASE\n\nSchizophrenia: \u201cA major mental disorder of unknown cause typically characterized by . . . a distortion of reality accompanied by delusions, hallucinations (and) bizarre behavior, etc., often with no loss of basic intellectual functions.\u201d --Webster\u2019s New World dictionary\n\nIn the days when Aldridge was still on the farm and going to grade school in Louisiana, a teacher asked him a question one day in class.\n\nReplying politely, he said: \u201cI ain\u2019t sittin\u2019 on nan part of the chair.\u201d\n\nThe other kids all laughed, and Aldridge squirmed. \u201cIt was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life,\u201d he said later.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t realized that my grandfather had his own language. I thought everybody talked that way.\u201d\n\nAldridge vowed then to learn proper English. \u201cI made it my first priority,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough, of course, I didn\u2019t know what a priority was in those days.\u201d\n\nHe does now. And he has become the good speaker he wanted to be.\n\n\u201cLionel is known for that God-given voice,\u201d said Shirley Leonard, a Packer spokeswoman.\n\nDan Devine said: \u201cOne thing everybody notices about Lionel is that he\u2019s as well-spoken as he is soft-spoken.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he is obviously a professional, a natural, on either radio or TV. As a commentator, Aldridge comes right to the point, and when he does, he has something to say.\n\n\u201cLionel is one of the top football analysts,\u201d Stoddard said. \u201cHe has a knack for it. Getting a chance (as a commentator) is his problem.\u201d\n\nIt is now. It wasn\u2019t before mental illness struck him down. One day he was a rising professional, appearing on network television. The next he was out on the streets, hallucinating, behaving strangely. Considering the kind of ability he had shown in the communications field, he could hardly have been attacked by a more disastrous disease.\n\nThat is the nature of paranoid schizophrenia. Most serious illnesses are dreadful. This one torments in a particularly cruel way.\n\n\u201cWhen you feel perfect, when you feel as good as you can feel, that\u2019s when you\u2019re getting into trouble,\u201d Aldridge said. \u201cFor a (schizophrenic), happiness is the dawn of real trouble.\u201d\n\nFeeling well often leads the patient to abandon therapy. \u201cYou feel so good that you know you don\u2019t need any more medication,\u201d Aldridge recalls sadly.\n\nAt UCLA, Dr. Wahl said that treatment consists of talk therapy as well as medication.\n\n\u201cYou have to understand your past if you are to change it,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, you\u2019re just covering up the problem (with medicine). Of course, medication is (essential).\u201d\n\nAldridge is one of the many who can attest to that. For he was on and off medication several times--and had been burned every time he got off it--before he bowed to his illness.\n\n\u201cToday, any time I start to feel I\u2019ve got it together, I throttle it down,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to learn a whole new ballgame. When I was on the bum, I felt great.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/lionel-aldridge/", "page_content": "Lionel Aldridge (February 14, 1941 \u2013 February 12, 1998) was an American professional football player, a defensive end in the National Football League for eleven seasons with the Green Bay Packers and San Diego Chargers.\n\nEarly years Born in Evergreen, Louisiana, Aldridge was raised by his sharecropper grandparents.

At least once, he picked it up and slammed it against the sidewalk. The dog was injured but not killed. Aldridge had missed his 5:15 and 6:15 radio shows.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I did that,\u201d Aldridge recalled, \u201cit was something I thought I needed to do, because I was listening to voices.\u201d\n\nAldridge knew he was in trouble, but he left the hospital after a week and returned to work. Things went badly. He took many leaves from WTMJ and had many relapses.\n\nAs a player, he never drank or used drugs of any kind, but now he was hearing voices unheard by others, and the best way to drown them out was to drug them into silence.\n\nOn a fall weekend in 1978 the Packers were in San Diego for a game against the Chargers.\n\nThe night before the game, well past midnight, Milwaukee Journal writer Dave Begel was startled by a thunderous banging on his door. \u201cI opened it,\u201d said Begel, \u201cand there was Lionel, holding a bottle of Scotch and a handful of pills.\n\nHe walked through the room, out to the balcony, and sat there drinking and taking pills.\n\n\u201cWhen he said anything, it was just gibberish, like some foreign language. He wasn\u2019t talking to me. Then he came in and sat on the bed and watched TV. I sat there and waited and waited.\n\n\u201cThe sun was coming up when he got up and said, \u2018I\u2019m going now,\u2019 and left. I saw him an hour before game time and he was okay and did his job. But he was obviously very disturbed.\u201d\n\nAldridge hung on to his job for a while, but by 1981 he was down and out, having plummeted from the heights of the Super Bowl to the depths of the gutter.\n\nOne night on a nondescript city street, he carefully removed his three-diamond Super Bowl ring, put it in his pocket and went to sleep. The ring was the most valuable possession he owned. In the morning it was gone.\n\nHe checked himself in and out of hospitals. A suicide attempt failed. He hitch-hiked across the country, looking for work and sometimes finding it.\n\nThere was a counseling job at a Utah prison; he couldn\u2019t handle it. Arriving after the football season started at his Alma Mater Utah State, he was given a job as an assistant coach.\n\nIt lasted only until the season ended. He continued to drift, doing odd jobs when they came his way.\n\nHis wife had divorced him and taken the children to California. That was all right with him.
