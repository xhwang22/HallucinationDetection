There was no one like him, with his extraordinary range of gifts and abilities. He was the Church of Scotland\u2019s only polymath. John Cameron was born in Dundee on 10 June, 1943. He was the eldest of the four sons of the Rev Alexander Cameron and Margaret Urquhart.\n\nOn his father\u2019s side he was related to the distinguished journalist James Cameron and the Gaelic poet Kenneth MacLeod. His maternal grandfather was Hugh Urquhart, one of the outstanding Scottish railway engineers of the early 20th century and outdoor engineering chief of the LNER. In childhood John often spent summers in Brittany with his French grandmother.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nWhile adept at almost every form of sport, it was as a runner he came to national prominence and he gained his full international colours the year he left school. During his years at Falkirk High School he was also leader of the Stirlingshire Schools orchestra and tenor soloist in the school\u2019s musical productions. He had every gift. Academically he won prizes across the board and placed in the top rung of the St Andrews University Bursary Competition going up with a major scholarship.\n\nAt St Andrews he continued to win class medals and to compete internationally in athletics. He also became a tenor soloist with Cedric Thorpe Davies\u2019 famous Chapel Choir. In 1962 he was offered a sports scholarship to Pomona College, California. Whilst studying business there, he competed on the athletics circuit in North America until 1964.\n\nAfter graduation he returned to St Andrews and started the research which would lead to his Physics PhD. Since his studies depended on the early mainframe computers which he could only access at night, his days were free. He was thus able to continue singing with the Chapel Choir and the Renaissance Singers, to be Charities Convener, to be an active member of both the Kate Kennedy Club and the SRC, and \u2013 now that his running days were over \u2013 to play for the University golf team.\n\nAfter completing his doctoral studies he joined the international marketing division of GlaxoSmithKline. In the summer of 1970 he married Jill Sj\u00f6berg in London and shortly thereafter surprised everyone by deciding to enter the ministry of the Church of Scotland. The couple returned to Edinburgh where they bought a flat in Marchmont. John read theology at New College while Jill worked as a physiotherapist in the Astley-Ainslie Hospital. As usual he did a lot more outside the lecture room than in it, and he was soon in the Edinburgh University Golf Team, playing cricket for Carlton, and lecturing in Physics at Napier University.\n\nJohn had a hunger for ministry. His father was the minister of Slamannan near Falkirk. Early in our friendship, about 1971, John told me that his father had died in 1968 when an ill-maintained chimney in the manse crashed through the roof in a storm. John was only 25 when that tragedy happened. He later wrote a booklet about the maintenance of manses which was adopted by the Church of Scotland. John very much wanted to stop that kind of thing happening again.\n\nAfter graduation he served for a year as Assistant Minister at Glasgow\u2019s Wellington Church where his daughter Clare was born. Early in 1974 he was called to St Stephen\u2019s and West Church, Broughty Ferry, where he would stay for the next 35 years and where his son Alex was born.\n\nHe completed his second doctorate as an external student \u2013 this time in theology at St Mary\u2019s College in St Andrews. In addition, he lectured in Physics, Mathematics and Economics in Dundee, taught Religious Education to several generations at Dundee High School and served as a padre in the Royal Naval Reserve and latterly the Black Watch.\n\nAs a hobby, he turned to the family tradition of journalism, first with the Pergamon Press in Oxford and then for many years with John Hill at the Good Ski Guide and Good Holiday Magazine; posts which allowed John and Jill to travel to every corner of the world.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nSport played a large part in family life. The main holiday was devoted to skiing with special memories of New Years\u2019 in St Moritz and racing down the Cresta Club\u2019s famous toboggan run. He thoroughly enjoyed curling and for many years he was Chaplain to the Royal Caledonian Curling Club and enjoyed matches in Europe.\n\nAnd of course there was golf. In the late 1960s he was Gerald Micklem\u2019s caddie and in 1969 claimed Willie Whitelaw\u2019s Captain\u2019s Sovereign \u2013 the only \u201csovereign caddie\u201d to subsequently become a member of the R&A. John was an extremely competitive golfer, achieving success in multiple events across half a century. Perhaps most notably, he was the first golfer in the R&A to win the Canadian Silver Beaver twice, testament to his near ruthless determination and notable ability to play in all conditions. Even as his game shortened, his putting never left him, and he won Elie\u2019s over-70s world championships and the St Andrews town putting championships well into his 70s.\n\nGolf has also always been a great family affair too, with Jill and many of the Sjobergs keen players, and both Clare and Alex introduced to the game by John during annual summer holidays in Elie. The combined towns of Elie and Earlsferry have always been a very special place for John and his family, with many great memories shared with family and friends across the years. During his final few years, John took great delight as the next generation were introduced to the game of golf, regularly playing with his grandchildren on the nine-holers at Elie and St Andrews and taking the opportunity to pass on wisdom drawn from 60 years of battling the famous Fife links.\n\nIn retirement, desperate to maintain an active brain, he turned to the newspapers. Over the years he took pleasure in being able to reach more people through his letters than he ever did from the pulpit and built a loyal following. He used to send these to me, always with the email heading, \u2018Warblings\u2019 or \u2018More Warblings\u2019. He was particularly proud to have supported his friend Margo Macdonald in her efforts to legalise Assisted Dying in this country, as well as, Abdul Basset Ali al-Megrahi and his wrongful conviction of the Lockerbie bombing with falsified evidence. And I know that Abdul Basset Ali al-Megrahi used to send John Christmas cards from Barlinnie in gratitude for his kindness.\n\nJohn\u2019s ability to dissect problems and relentlessly attack faddish causes were part of his continuing ministry for others. A wide-ranging polymath, he used his power of intellect and penetrating observation to offer humane and rational solutions. He was someone who made a difference and we thank God for his life and ministry.\n\nObituaries\n\nIf you would like to submit an obituary (800-1000 words preferred, with jpeg image), or have a suggestion for a subject, contact [email protected].\n\nA message from the Editor"}, {"url": "https://www.scotsfootballworldwide.scot/johncameron", "page_content": "A few years ago Martin Cloake, writer and historian of Tottenham Hotspur F.C., wrote a series on \u201cthe men who made Spurs.....about some of the key figures that made the club what it is\u201d. In that list he included not just Peter McWilliam but also John \u201cJock\u201d Cameron, understanding the crucial role each had played in the creation of his club, and the footballing continuity they represent. However, he firstly did not understand, beyond the fact that they were both Scots, the origins that link the two. Why should he? His viewpoint is that of a Londoner, not a Highlander. Nor was he aware of how important McWilliam to be in the history of Dutch Total Football, both would be in the story of another of North London\u2019s clubs, Spurs\u2019 deadly rivals, Arsenal, and therefore with Spurs of London football in general and the parts McWilliam would play in the sport in India and obliquely both he and Cameron in the Spanish game.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot that John Cameron was born in the Highlands. He came into the World in 1872 in Ayr, seven years McWilliam\u2019s senior. However, his father, and, at the loss of his Ayrshire mother two years later, the first of the two great family losses he would endure, his step-mother were both born and brought up in Balnuilt in Strathconan in rural Ross-shire, thirty miles from Inverness, twenty from Dingwall. It is a village that no longer exists. It was first cleared and now lies under the waters of the Loch Meig reservoir.\n\n\n\n\n\nCameron was another Scots boy with an education, a working-class boy with a brain as well as footballing feet, with footballing ideas; a product of Ayr Grammar. A quick and intelligent forward with good technical skills, able to dribble or to hold the ball well, and a fine eye for a pass, he arrived at Spurs in 1898 at the age of twenty-six. He had come via Queen\u2019s Park as an amateur in the Glasgow club\u2019s limbo years outside the Scottish league, and then from late 1895 for two and a bit seasons in the English Football League, at Everton , first as an amateur, as such in 1896 winning his only Scotland cap, against Ireland, just a 3-3 draw in Belfast, alongside fellow d\u00e9butant, R.S. McColl, returning north to feature in the losing team to Celtic in the 1896 Glasgow Charity Cup and then finally turning professional.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was also at a time when owners of league clubs in England were seeking, shall we say, to \u201cmaximise their returns\u201d. As one of the measure they unilaterally applied a wage-cap to players\u2019 pay. Players responded, Cameron amongst them. He, with a number of other high-earners with most to lose, not least his team-mate at Everton and fellow, Scottish international, John Bell, was instrumental in forming the first players\u2019 representative organisation, the Association Footballers Union, the AFU; Colin Veitch would a decade later be a prime mover in the second, the PFA, the one that would last. Cameron became the AFU\u2019s first Secretary, Bell its President and both were promptly placed on the transfer list by their club.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, although the AFU was effectively broken up by pressure from the League clubs, they had failed to take into account one important factor. The League was mainly a Northern English phenomenon. Arsenal had in 1893 become the first Southern club to be accepted and would remain in the Second Division until 1904. It had been followed by Bristol City only in 1900. Meanwhile other Southern clubs played the Southern League, where crowds were growing, money was being invested and most importantly there was no cap on players\u2019 income. That alone would be enough to attract not a few top players, including Scots internationalists John Tait Robertson and R.C. Hamilton .\n\nThus it was that in 1898 at the age of 26 John Cameron was scooped up as a player with thirteen others by a Spurs, moving from Tottenham Marshes for a season at Northumberland Park. A year later the club\u2019s secretary moved on and Cameron, after scoring 35 goals in the season, became not the first Scottish secretary at an English Football League club; that had been Thomas Mitchell at Blackburn from 1884 to 1896 and then for a year as Arsenal\u2019s first professional manager, followed closely by George Ramsay at Aston Villa ; but not just the first Scottish player/secretary, i.e. player/manager, but the first ever player/manager at what are today's senior, English clubs. It would be the start of a remarkable period. By 1906 the trio of Cameron, Mitchell and Ramsay had become eight, with Scots managers also at Manchester City, Middlesbrough, Bradford, Chelsea, Derby and Bury. By 1910 it was eleven, matched through the 1920s and peeking at a dozen in 1927.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Spurs moving to White Hart Lane at the end of the 1898-99-season Cameron immediately set about rebuilding the team. Thirteen players left in the 1899 closed season. Fourteen came in, two from Everton, amongst them the future Irish international, Jack Kirwan, and four from Scotland joining three others, including Cameron, in the first team.\n\n\n\n\n\nCameron, as a constant member of the team for the first four years, was over six seasons to make 238 appearances for Tottenham. He introduced an attacking style of play, establishing \u201cthe personality of the club\u201d, a personality that persists. He would lead it to the Southern League Championship in 1900, twice to be runners-up and never lower than 6th. However, his greatest triumph, one very unlikely ever to be repeated, was in 1901, when the club became the only one ever from outside the Football League to win the FA Cup. In 1884 and 1885 it might have been Queen\u2019s Park only to fall at the last hurdle. In 1901 it was a team led by an ex-Queen\u2019s Park player, defeating Sheffield United after a replay. In doing so Cameron played six Scots and employed an innovative formation. During the game he dispensed with the standard, Scottish 2:2:3:3 with its attacking centre-half but retaining wide full-backs, adopted 2:3:1:4. Defending in more depth with a defensive centre-half, note, not yet a centre-back, and Cameron himself at inside-forward in mid-field, Spurs attacked on the break, coming from behind to win 3:1. Cameron scored the equaliser and made the second goal.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1907 Cameron left Tottenham. Why is not clear. It is possibly because the club' directors were directing resources prior to joining the Football League at the ground and not players. Two years earlier at thirty-three his playing days had come to an end. For those two years one of those filling his position of inside-forward had been a certain Herbert Chapman , who was watching, clearly learning and would soon be putting into practice. Cameron himself concentrated on managing but had also been working as a football journalist and pundit and it was to writing that he turned after Tottenham. In 1908 he published \u201cThe White Hart\u2019s History of the Spurs Entry to the Football League\u201d as Spurs did just that and \u201cAssociation Football and How to Play It. In 1911 he was living with his wife and daughter just outside Southend and recorded still as a journalist but a year later he had been tempted back into the game but in Germany. He had been recruited as a coach by Dresden SC, one of Germany\u2019s very first football clubs but quite possibly not from Britain but Holland. Tijs Tummer's, a fount of knowledge of British involvement in early Dutch football, says that on 1st August 1911 Joh Cameron became trainer of Haarlem, in fact the club's first trainer although it had already been in existence for two decades. And with his input the club went on to win the Dutch Cup Final, beating Vitesse 2-0. However it was not before Cameron had joined, for part or all, the Ajax party that that May toured Hungary and Austria, where they played Wiener Sport Club, which had lost just the previous week to none other than an also on-tour Spurs. Nor was that the only coincidence. Ajax's trainer was Jack Kirwan, who had not only played 154 games alongside Cameron for Tottenham himself between 1899 and 1905 but they had both been in the London club's forward line in both the 1901 FA Cup Final and its triumphant replay.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso from Tijs Tummer it is clear that Cameron remained in Haarlem for the summer of 1912. He is recorded as playing cricket there at the time. But by the autumn of that year his attention was turning to Deventer in the centre of the Netherlands. In October De Zaluwen, an elite club there published a book, \"How to Raise the Level of Dutch Football\", in which Cameron is quoted and in March 1913 he moved to train another Deventer team, UD, but not quite soon enough. In the East Zone of the Cup that year it lost in the play-off that would have taken it to the final against the champion of the West Zone.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it may have been that John Cameron went directly later in 1913 from Holland to Germany and it was whilst still at Dresden that the Great War broke out, he, along with many Britons, including several ex. footballers, internationals amongst them, including Fred Pentland, was rounded up and they were interned for the duration of the war at the Ruhleben camp in the Berlin suburbs. It would be Pentland who in the camp would listen to Cameron, learn and a decade later implement at Athletic Bilbao and Atletico Madrid. So successful was he with it that by the 1930s all of Spanish football had followed suit, as it still does today.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Ruhleben once more Cameron\u2019s organisational abilities also came to the fore. He became for the duration of the conflict Secretary of the camp\u2019s football association and captain of its Rest of the World team in its games against the camp\u2019s English players. Sadly, however, in 1915 Cameron\u2019s wife died, in Ayr and it was there he returned on release in 1918. For two years he became manager of Ayr United but soon returned to journalism. He may even have had a breakdown, exacerbated by his war experience. He certainly never managed again, never seemed to have direct involvement with football, making a living from his pen and is said to have died in Glasgow aged 63 in 1935. In fact he did die that year but in Edinburgh, in Easter Road close to the Hibernian ground, and recorded not as a footballer, nor a journalist, nor an author but as what he had been forty years earlier, a humble clerk. He deserves more than that not least for the fascinating insight his \u201cAssociation Football...and How To Play It\u2019 gives into how a successful, English football club then played the Scottish game and how that style had changed even within the time he had been playing.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe writes,\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the last decade the forward line was purely individualistic, and there were certainly many giants of the game. Combination play was, generally speaking, unknown, and every forward was quite on his own. The forward line is now a combined one, and in one way it is more effective than the old style. It is hardly possible to get a combination of both, but it can be done, and if a team are fortunate to do so they would certainly come out on top at the end of the season. It is a recognised fact that the forward play of to-day is rather too mechanical, and we miss the individual efforts that we used to appreciate so very much in the days gone past,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe clearly recognises the influence of Gilbert Smith and that the game had changed between the time of his first involvement in the early 1990s and 1907, but implies the best of the old and the new can be combined, presumably in the way he had at Spurs, without being \u201cmechanical\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen he goes on to analyse a side positions by position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNaturally, the centre forward is the connecting link in the rank. He should be tall, a fine dribbler, and more often an individualist than any of his comrades. He should also be able to keep his wings well together and distribute the play to the best advantage, and most of all to be a fine shot,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe seems not to favour the short, Scottish centre-forward. Perhaps he has R.C. Hamilton in mind and,\n\n\n\n\u201cThe inside forwards (his position) should do what is called \u201cthe donkey work\u201d, to fetch and carry, and to help the half-backs when they are in a dilemma. Theirs is the most thankless job of the lot and a great deal done by them is often unappreciated.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHis team has a \u201cmid-field\u201d and inside forwards , who are the link between that mid-field and the forwards. This was what he had done as player, was to be his outstanding, innovative contribution to football thinking and what Herbert Chapman was to duplicate time and again at Northampton first, then Huddersfield and finally with Alex James at Arsenal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen he moves on incisively to wing-play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cComing to the outside man, he should be able to shoot accurately from any angle. Often a great failing of his is running towards the corner flag instead of making a beeline for the goal.....I do not believe in an outside forward coming to the assistance of the defence, save under exceptional circumstances...... Centring the ball is a great feature, and the best position from which to do so is about thirty yards out, landing the ball close upon the twelve yard line. If he puts it further than that the goalkeeper is in a position to catch it and the save the position........The art of being able to place corner kicks effectively is a thing of the past. Perhaps this is due to the restrictions against charging the goalkeeper (introduced 15 years earlier) unless he is actual contact with the ball........It may seem strange, but the best way for the outside right to kick is with his left foot. The same applies to the outside left; he should kick with his right foot. The reason here is surely obvious, because kicks with your left foot from the right wing cause a slight swerve on the ball.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn John Cameron\u2019s mind there is no question of wingers tracking back. They are also not there to hug the by-lines but attack the goal full-on. This is what would form the basis of the Ajax style in Holland from the 1920s. He regrets the decline of the art of the corner, is precise about when a centre should played, and where it should land, and advocates the \u201cmodern\u201d practice of left-footers playing on the right and vice-versa.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith regard to the half-backs he says,\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that the half-back line is the back-bone of the team, and probably the centre half catches the eye more than any other member of the eleven.......as he is command of both the attack and the defence....I prefer a fast man for this position.....his head work ought to be excellent.....the distribution of play is practically left to him. It is debatable point regarding the halves whether they should direct their main efforts against the inside or outside forward. To my mind, there ought to be an understanding between the back and the half, but in theory the half-back should tackle the inside forward and leave the outside man to the back. The best of critics disagree on this point.....\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHis analysis of the centre-half pinpoints precisely what a good one had to be \u2013 skilled with head and feet, clearly by 1908 not just a tool of the attack but with an additional but not dual role as a defender. He prefers a player with pace, an Alex Raisbeck . Herbert Chapman would be more ambivalent, looking for precision. He was also Scottish in his recommendation of full-backs marking wingers and not inside-forwards.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for the full-back he is years ahead of his time. He looks for speed and technique, dismissing simple ruggedness, encouraging attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne associates the full back with long and lusty kicking but he must possess many more qualifications. He must be speedy, a fine tackler, and, above all, a good header of the ball. He must be strong in defence, but again, when his side is having most of the play he should be able to put in many a good shot......he should be able to kick as well with one foot as the other.....to the uninitiated it seems that when the ball come to the back he should return it vigorously, and nothing more. This is far from correct. Many of our best backs have been moderate kickers, but when they did kick they did so with discretion and judgement, placing the ball to the full (perhaps half-) back if he was free or to the outside right or left, as the run of play might be.\u201d\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.dib.ie/biography/cameron-john-a1406", "page_content": "Cameron, John (1724\u201399), presbyterian minister and writer, was born in Scotland; some sources say near Edinburgh, though Kinross is also mentioned. Nothing is known of his parents. He was apprenticed to an Edinburgh bookseller, and among the books picked up a love of literature and a wide knowledge of history and theology; he graduated MA from Edinburgh university. He became a probationer in the Reformed Presbyterian church, and went to Ireland before 1752; he preached in barns and fields, as well as in the houses where adherents met in covenanting societies. He was a popular preacher, and in 1754, when some members of the regular presbyterian congregation in Bushmills sought to break away from the ministry of the incumbent John Logue, they offered to call Cameron, provided he joined the presbytery of Route. Cameron's ability as a preacher, evident in his unusually prompt composition of a trial sermon, impressed the presbytery, and he was ordained in Dunluce 3 June 1755.\n\nCameron's theology underwent remarkable development a few years later, when a Church of Ireland clergyman lent him the then notorious book by John Taylor, Scripture doctrine of original sin. Far from loathing Taylor's thesis, as he had expected to do, Cameron was completely convinced by the arguments, and in time his own beliefs went beyond the sympathy for New Light theology that was tacitly tolerated in the general synod of his day. He strongly disapproved of man-made creeds, and took an active part in theological controversies (orthodox historians of the church would later admit the power of his sermons and writings, while denouncing his doctrines as pernicious). His works generally appeared anony-mously, though his authorship was an open secret; his pamphlet The catholic Christian (1769) was attacked in print by Benjamin McDowell (qv), who named him as author. Cameron produced two further works in the continuing controversy, one of which was Theophilus and Philander (1772). Though he could not sway McDowell (or later historians), others of his contemporaries held him in sufficient regard to elect him moderator of the general synod in 1767, and since he freely lent his sermons to colleagues, his views must have been widely disseminated in north Co. Antrim and Co. Londonderry.\n\nIn 1768 appeared Cameron's magnum opus, the only one to which he put his name: The Messiah, a prose epic in nine books. It is an ambitious production in exalted diction, in which Cameron's imaginative recreation of Satan's thought processes and scheming is almost that of a novelist. It was reprinted with a memoir of the author in 1811, and can still be read with interest. A manuscript dealing with the millennium remained unpublished in case of unintended political applications; it was said to foretell the French revolution in surprising detail. Francis Dobbs (qv), who urged publication, said he would rather have written it than be king of England. Another work, The doctrine of the Holy Scriptures, remained unpublished when Cameron died but was edited and published (1828) by Arthur Neilson (or Nelson), minister of Rademon, Co. Down; the orthodox Thomas Witherow (qv) described it as \u2018repulsive reading\u2019. Cameron died on 31 December 1799 at Park, Ballymagarry, and was buried in the old Dunluce graveyard.\n\nCameron was married (though nothing is known of his wife), and had at least one son, William, who as a result of correspondence between his father and Joseph Priestley, the famous unitarian scientist, moved to Birmingham to work. Two daughters married locally, and there were possibly other children, but a Simon Cameron (b. 1777), who became Reformed Presbyterian minister of Ballylaggan, is unlikely to have been his son."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/john.cameron/3727528", "page_content": "John Cameron\n\ntheologian\n\n1579 (age 45) Glasgow, Scotland\n\nHe then returned to Bordeaux, and in the beginning of 1604 he was nominated one of the students of divinity who were maintained at the expense of the church, and who for the period of four years were at liberty to prosecute their studies in any Protestant seminary. During this period he acted as tutor to the two sons of Calignon, chancellor of Navarre. They spent one year at Paris, and two at Geneva, whence they removed to Heidelberg. In this university, on the 4th of April 1608, he gave a public proof of his ability by maintaining a series of theses, De triplici Dei cum Homine Foedere, which were printed among his works. The same year he was recalled to Bordeaux, where he was appointed the colleague of Dr Primrose; and when Francis Gomarus was removed to Leiden, Cameron, in 1618, was appointed professor of divinity at Saumur, the principal seminary of the French Protestants. In 1620 the progress of the civil troubles in France obliged Cameron to seek refuge for himself and family in England. For a short time he read private lectures on divinity in London; and in 1622 the king appointed him principal of the university of Glasgow in the room of Robert Boyd, who had been removed from his office in consequence of his adherence to Presbyterian- ism. Cameron was prepared to accept Episcopacy, and was cordially disliked for his adherence to the doctrine of passive obedience. He resigned his office in less than a year. He returned to France, and lived at Saumur. After an interval of a year he was appointed professor of divinity at Montauban. The country was still torn by civil and religious dissensions; and Cameron excited the indignation of the more strenuous adherents of his own party.

Due to Margaret\u2019s experience with the breed, I backed her decision and that was before an influx of continentals entered the country,\u201d said John.\n\n\u201cJohn\u2019s mother was still alive at this time and had retired down to Elie. The name of her house was called Baldinnie and when we got the herd, we used that name as the prefix,\" added Margaret.\n\n\"We bought the first pedigree in the mid-1960s in the form of some locally sourced females. One of John\u2019s mentors, Sandy Campbell, from Kinellar, in Aberdeenshire, gave us a lot of advice about putting together a herd,\" she said.\n\nJohn pointed out: \u201cWe were also building up the commercial beef herd at the time, with around 800 Luing cross Simmentals and I decided we would use the Hereford as a terminal sire.\n\n\"Eventually, we formed a contract with Waitrose and one of the requirements which had to be met was that the stock had to be sired by a pedigree Hereford bull, in order to meet the scheme.\n\n\u201cSo, we used home-bred bulls from Margaret\u2019s herd on the commercial cattle and I had the unenviable task of having to buy my pedigree Hereford bulls from my wife and this was not an easy task!\u201d\n\nQualities you like about the Hereford?\n\nTheir docile nature and that they are clean and easy to handle. We have never really had to intervene at calving, but if we do, they are very calm.\n\nFirst big breed sale or show?\n\nThe first local show would have been East Fife Agricultural Show, followed by Perth, where we enjoyed a few successes. The first sale was through Bosomworth's, in Edinburgh, at the Scottish Hereford Society\u2019s annual breed sale.\n\nBest animal ever bred?\n\nIt has to be Baldinnie Cathy. A daughter of the original purchase from Canada, Wilgor Cathy, she had all the female traits you would expect for a show cow. She knew how to show herself off and had a breeding performance that was exceptional \u2013 if she was not winning herself, her progeny were.\n\nBest animal ever seen?\n\nWe have seen so many, however, the animal that has left the biggest impression would certainly be the supreme Hereford champion we once saw at the Agribition annual show, held in Calgary, Alberta, in Canada.\n\nBest animal you\u2019ve been out-bidded on or lost?\n\nAgain, we have to say Cathy when she died, as she was hugely influential within our herd.\n\nBiggest disappointment?\n\nYou get a lot of disappointments in life and they were a regular feature of our lifetime\u2019s experience, but we never dwelled on them.\n\nMost influential person in your careers?\n\nThe late Sandy Campbell and on an equal footing, the late Wilbur Donaldson, who was probably the most noted Canadian Hereford breeder of all time, and originally from Scotland.\n\nFavourite sale over the years and why?\n\n\u201cThe society\u2019s annual national sale, at Hereford,\u201d stated Margaret.\n\n\u201cThe first pedigree bull that we ever bought at Hereford, my good friend, Sandy Campbell, was sitting next to me. I bought the bull he advised me to buy and the auctioneer didn\u2019t recognise me as I was a new face, but it was a big price so the bull was knocked down to 'the man sat next to Sandy Campbell' as I was referred to back then!\u201d said John.\n\nAbiding memory?\n\n\u201cThere are two that come to me, the first being able to re-purchase the family farm at Balbuthie. The second would be being appointed president of the NFUS followed by my appointment of chairman of the EEC sheep meat committee,\u201d said John.\n\n\u201cI used to get my leg pulled by my EEC colleagues about being the biggest sheep producer in Europe, to which my reply was that I also had the biggest overdraft!\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe other great interest in my career has been railways and following my spell as NFUS president \u2013 which would have been the greatest honour I\u2019ve accorded \u2013 would be to be appointed chairman of Scotrail and then to the Nationalised British Railway Board, in London.\n\n\"I enjoyed both these appointments enormously, and in particular, enjoyed the company of the people I was working with, both at headquarters and out on the railway.\u201d\n\nInterests outwith farming?\n\n\u201cThe livestock were my main hobby, I spent a lot of time with them,\u201d said Margaret.\n\n\u201cOutwith farming, I was chairman of the board of governors of Dollar Academy for 30 years. I\u2019m very conscious of what the school did for me \u2013 the school matured me out of all recognition and I\u2019ll always be grateful. I enjoyed putting anything I could back into the school,\u201d added John.\n\nBest breeder ever?\n\nThe late Edward Lewis, of the Haven herd.\n\nBest advice?\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not sure keep your mouth shut, it seems to have worked for me,\u201d said John.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do what your husband tells you to do!\u201d added Margaret.\n\nBiggest achievement?\n\n\u201cFor me it would be winning supreme champion at Perth Show,\u201d Margaret commented.\n\n\u201cWinning the Burke Trophy at the Royal Show presented by HM The Queen was a very prestigious thing as it represented the champion of champions, the best male and female of the breeds with Baldinnie involved,\u201d added John.\n\n\u201cAnother agricultural highlight for myself would be the appointment as president of the NFUS. I was also chairman of the National Safety Committee for the British Railway Board.\n\n\"In order to do that job justice, I approached the chairman, Sir Bob Reid, from Cupar, and asked him if I could be passed out as a driver and know what I was talking about.\n\n\u201cEventually, I was permitted to drive and this led me to my greatest accomplishment in that the day of the official opening of the restored line to the Borders, in 2018, one of my own locomotives was selected to haul the Royal train with myself as the driver that took the Queen and other members of the Royal Family to Tweedbank for the official opening ceremony,\u201d explained John.\n\nFuture of the Hereford?\n\n\u201cTrends come and go, but it does appear now that there is a swing to favour lighter weighted, finished carcases and from a financial point of view, there\u2019s a tendency to finish cattle at a younger age and I think the Hereford breed is admirably suited to achieve both of these objectives.\n\n\"The overarching role that the native breeds at one time had I think will gradually return to achieve a role in beef finishing, such as they haven\u2019t experienced the past few decades, however, the continentals will still play an important role,\u201d explained John.\n\n\u201cThat means they aren\u2019t going to carry excess fat, which is not a desirable trait in todays world and this will help them secure a place within both the pedigree and commercial market,\u201d added Margaret.\n\nBiggest fear for the future?\n\n\u201cThe trade deal with Australia. It worries me as I\u2019m aware that the cost of production in these countries is much less than it could ever be over here, but at the same time I\u2019m also concerned that the quality of imported meat may not be up to the same standards as we have been accustomed to in this country,\u201d John stated.\n\n\u201cThe most worrying outcome of that is the future level of meat consumption in this country, which could have a detrimental effect on our industry,\u201d concluded\n\nMargaret."}, {"url": "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cameron-6067", "page_content": "John Cameron\n\nabout 1730 in Rannach, Perthshire, Scotland [uncertain] Bornin [uncertain]\n\nSon of [father unknown] and [mother unknown]\n\n[sibling(s) unknown]\n\nCatherine (Seaton) Cameron Husband of\u2014 married before 1768 [location unknown]\n\nElizabeth (Ferguson) Cameron Husband of\u2014 married 25 Sep 1772 in Blair Atholl, Perthshire, Scotland\n\nDescendants\n\n10 Sep 1803 at about age 73 in Summerstown, Charlottenburg, Glengarry, Upper Canada Diedin\n\nThis page has been accessed 856 times.\n\nBiography\n\nJohn Cameron was born about 1730 in Rannach, Perth, Scotland.

John Cameron was born about 1730 in Rannach, Perthshire, Scotland, a Cameron of Lochiel and the son of Donald Cameron and Janet Menzies. He was baptised 10 May 1730 in the parish of Dull, about 14 miles from Kinloch Rannoch.\n\nJohn Cameron and Catherine Seaton married before 1768 . They had one child, Donald Cameron.\n\nJohn Cameron and Elizabeth Ferguson were married 15 Sep 1772 in Blair Atholl, Perth, Scotland. [3] They emigrated from Perthshire to New York Colony aboard the Pearl in 1773. The Pearl arrived in York Town \"when the city was seething with excitement over ... 'the Tea Occasion'; in fact the announcement of the safe landing of the Pearl appears just below the reports of this affair in both [Rivington's Gazeteer] and the Gazette. On October 15 a consignment of tea from the East India Company had arrived but it was refused entry because of the importation duties of three pence per pound as laid down by Parliament. Citizens in public meeting approved the action...\" The Gazette said \"on Monday last arrived the ship Pearl, Capt. Tucker, in 6 weeks from Fort William, in the Highlands of Scotland, with a great number of very respectable Passengers full of Health, and Ready Money to purchase each Man his Freehold. They are justly esteemed a great Acquisition to this Province, in some Part of which they propose to settle. There are, in the whole, about 280 Souls\". \"The representatives chosen by the Highlanders to discuss terms with these landholders [Goldsbrown Banyar and Lawrence Kortwright] would seem to have been Alexander of Aberchalder, Hugh Fraser, and John Cameron.\" On \"October 28, the company set out for the north.\" 'Thursday last,' runs a news item in the Gazetteer, 'the Gentlemen and other passengers that arrived here last Monday se'nnight, in the ship Pearl, Captain Tucker, from that part of North Britain called Glengary, embarked on board a sloop for Albany : on going on board they drank his Majesty's health, and prosperity to the province; and expressed the highest sense of gratitude for the civilities shown them by the inhabitants of this city.' From one to two weeks were required to sail by sloop up the one hundred miles of the Hudson River lying between York and Albany.\" \"The town contained about five hundred dwelling houses exclusive of stores and outhouses. The streets were irregular and badly laid out ...\" \"Almost immediately after their arrival Alexander Macdonell, John Cameron, and Hugh Fraser set out to view the land of Banyar and Kortwright at the Head of the Delaware\" They went from the Mohawk River by way of the Schoharie \"to the Head of the Delaware to view the lands offered by Kortwright and Banyar. They were so favourably impressed with this country that upon returning to Albany they reported 'the most flattering enccouragement' and immediately set out for York to negotiate with Kortwright and Banyar.\" [4] [5] John first settled in the Mohawk Valley in New York state, became a justice of the peace, and was quite well off. Enjoyment of the new home was short-lived.\n\nOn July 9th 1776, New York declared independence from Great Britain, a decision that was not accepted by the majority of Mohawk valley residents. John was soon a field officer in the 1st Battalion, King's Royal Regiment of New York.\n\nThe story of the John Cameron family's departure from the Mohawk Valley is not clear. One story is that with his wife and family, he crossed the St. Lawrence River on the ice at Lancaster; while another said they came to Glengarry via Nova Scotia after the American Revolution.\n\nJohn applied for assistance due a Loyalist. His claim dated 1 November 1787 says he went \u201cto America in 1773 when he settled on Mr. Cortwright\u2019s Lands. He came to Canada in 1777 and served the war in Sir John Johnson\u2019s 1st Battalion.\u201d He claimed \u201cProperty No.1. 150 acres from Mr. Cortwright on a lease forever to pay 6d Sterling for every acre for the first 8 years.

No 2. 200 Acres from Mr. George Clarke on the Delaware, he was to pay 2 / acre for it but paid nothing, he had cleared above 5 Acres he had a good house on it. Growing Corn he had 9 cows, a horse, a mare & Colt, Farming utensils and Furniture. And utensils for making Sugar, all these were sold by the rebels.\u201d[6]\n\nHe was granted land in Charlottenburg Township, Glengarry, Upper Canada which he called \"Fairfield\". [7]\n\nJohn Cameron \"the Wise\" died at Summerstown on 10 September 1803, and in his will he describes himself as an innkeeper.

An old Irish manuscript lists their ancestry from Ferchar Fada of the tribe of Lorn, king of Dalraida in 697. The Gaelic name was Camshron. The name is from the Gaelic Cam-shorn, meaning hook nose. It is said that a hooked nose was a characteristic of the old Clan Cameron families. Their principal territory was Locheil and Northern Argyll. The Cameron chiefs were distinguished for their warlike tendencies.They were known as fierce fighters: \u201cFor centuries the Camerons held by the sword the lands that had once been Clan Chattan\u2019s heritage in Lochaber. Their ferocious war cry was a promise to feed their enemies\u2019 flesh to dogs: \u201cSons of the hounds come here and get flesh\u201d. Their territory was bounded to the south by the MacLeans, to the west by the MacDonalds. Most of Cameron country is over one thousand feet in altitude. The highest mountain in Britain, Ben Nevis, is included in this area. The area contains eagles, wild cats, foxes, otters and red deer. The last wolf in Scotland is said to have been killed in 1680 by Ewan Cameron of Lochiel.\n\nThe earliest historically recorded Cameron laird was Donald Dubh (or Black Donald) mentioned in the fifteenth century. He was a formidable Lochaber warrier, and is considered to be the eleventh chief of Clan Cameron. One of the best known Cameron chiefs was Sir Ewen Cameron, in the late 1600s. He was the last chief to hold out against Cromwell, and bit through a Cromwellian officer\u2019s windpipe while locked in mortal combat near Inverlochy. Despite his ferocity, Ewan was said to be \u201cthe very model of a Highland gentleman of those times.\u201d He trained his men to be tough and disciplined, and to say that a bed of snow was like a \u201cthrice-driven bed of down\u201d.He saw one of his nephews had rolled together a large snowball as a pillow for his head. Ewan kicked the heap from under his head, saying \u201cWhat! Are you become a luxurious that you cannot sleep without a pillow?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Camerons fought on the side of Bonnie Prince Charlie in the battle of Culloden: \u201cDonald Cameron of Lochiel was a man on whom the exiled Stewarts rested stronger hopes than on any other chieftain in the Highlands. Individually, he headed a powerful and warlike clan, who so loved him that they would have gone at his lightest word into the very jaws of death. All the Highlands, from end to end, looked up confidingly to Locheil; and though he did his utmost to prevent the rash insurrection of 1745, his final accession to the cause of Charles did more to determine the rising of the Gael generally, than any other influence called into force on the occasion.\u201d The meeting of Prince Charles and Cameron is described: \u201cWhen Lochiel and the Chevalier met, the former used all the arguments that a man of sound sense and good feeling could do, to prevent the futility and hopelessness, for the time, of the proposed undertaking. He spoke in vain; and at last Charles tauntingly exclaimed, \u201cIn a few days I will raise the royal standard. Locheil, whom my father has often spoken of as our warmest friend, may stay at home, and learn from the newspapers the fate of his prince!\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d cried Lochiel, in tears, \u201cI will share the fate of my prince, come weal, come wo! And so shall every man over whom nature or fortune has given me power!\u201d On these words, we may almost say, the civil war of 1745 hung.\u201d (Clan Cameron) Lochiel rallied Clan Cameron, and prepared for battle with 700 Camerons following him. The Camerons stood in the front lines at the battle of Culloden. Their fight has been described by eye witnesses: \u201cWith their bonnets pulled tightly over their brows, their bodies half-bent, their shields raised so as to cover the head and vital parts, and their broadswords quivering in their nervous gripe, they sprung forward upon their foes like crouching tigers, their eyes gleaming with an expression fierce and terrific to the last degree. In this charge the front rank of the Camerons fell almost to a man.\u201d (Clan Cameron)\n\n\n\nThe clan motto is \u201cFor king and country\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe clan war cry is \u201cSons of the hounds come here and get flesh\u201d.\n\n\n\nAlexander Cameron, our ancestor was born in 1797 in Strontian, Argyllshire, in the highlands of Scotland. His father, John must have been born in the years following Culloden. It is not known how they came to live in Strontian or Kilmelford.

The master of vessel was required to prepare a list of passengers and to deposit it at the port of departure. Please note that there are no comprehensive nominal lists of immigrants arriving in Canada before 1865. Few such lists have survived.\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada (LAC) holds the Canadian immigration records for the years 1865 to 1935. The passenger lists are the sole surviving official records of the arrival of the majority of people accepted as immigrants in Canada.\n\nThe passenger list is a list of immigrants arriving at an official port of entry on a particular ship on a given date. Generally speaking, each manifest gives:\n\nthe name of the ship\n\nits port(s) and date(s) of departure\n\nits port(s) and date(s) of arrival in Canada\n\nthe name, age, sex, profession or occupation, nationality and destination of each passenger aboard\n\nIn some of the earlier manifests, personal information is omitted for wives, minor children, groups of labourers and first and second class passengers. Depending on the date, some lists contain other information on the immigrants, such as their health, religion, previous visits to Canada, family relationships and cash on hand.\n\nThe format of the lists varies over time. Standard forms were used increasingly from the 1870s onward. However, a number of the lists from the 1860s to the 1890s, especially for arrivals from European ports, are of irregular format or are inscribed on United States immigration forms.\n\nAfter Confederation onwards, immigration offices were maintained at various places called \"ports of entry\" and were responsible for the official reception and documentation of immigrants. The present formal process for designating ports of entry was not set up until after the First World War. Before that time, the collection of entry records at a particular port, then forwarding them automatically to Ottawa, was likely an informal administrative measure.\n\nThe passenger lists were microfilmed by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration during the 1950s and 1960s. The originals were destroyed after the microfilming. As a result, only a microfilm copy of the passenger lists exists as an archival holding.

These migrants are called \u201chome children\u201d because most went from an emigration agency's home for children in Britain to its Canadian receiving home. The children were placed with families in rural Canada.\n\nBackground information\n\nWho were these children? In Britain, children were taken into care by many groups, such as churches, workhouse unions and charitable organizations. Some children were orphans, but most were from destitute families who were unable to care for them due to poverty or because of the illness, death or workplace injury of a parent. Some children were paupers, which was a British term for a person who was living in or had lived in a workhouse. Many of the organizations and agencies caring for these children were motivated by social, economic and charitable forces to look to Canada as a new home for the children. They believed that the children would have better opportunities and a chance for a healthy, moral life in the Canadian countryside. Rural families welcomed the children and agreed to send them to school according to provincial laws, as well as to bring them to church and Sunday school. The children were also taught skills or trades that could help them to make an honourable living as adults. For most boys, this meant learning agricultural skills, as it did for farm children born in Canada. Girls learned home domestic skills. Many settlement families paid for girls to take music, dressmaking and millinery lessons. Some families also paid for secondary and post-secondary education for the children.\n\nComing to Canada Home children were under the age of 18. Some were toddlers, but most were aged between 7 and 14. Some children were sent to Canada without their parents\u2019 consent. The children underwent medical inspections before leaving Britain and again before leaving the ship when it arrived in Canada. Upon arrival, the children were brought to \u201creceiving\u201d or \u201cdistribution\u201d homes, such as Marchmont Home in Belleville, Ontario, and Gibbs' Home in Sherbrooke, Quebec. They were then taken to the homes of farmers in the area. About 70 percent of home children were settled in Ontario. Others were settled in Quebec, Manitoba, the Maritime provinces and British Columbia. Between 1935 and 1948, the Fairbridge Society settled over 300 children at its farm school on Vancouver Island, where they lived in cottage homes rather than being placed with families.\n\nThe children\u2019s lives in Canada It is commonly known that some of the children were abused, and many were poorly treated by today\u2019s standards. Many of those stories have been told and are heartbreaking to read. What is less known is that most experienced a better life in Canada than if they had remained in the urban slums of Britain, trapped in poverty and held back by a rigid class system. In Canada, many home children went on to own farms themselves. Others became teachers, carpenters, doctors, nurses, merchants, secretaries, clergy, tradespeople, politicians and a wide variety of other occupations. Many enlisted with the Canadian and British armed forces during the South African War and the two world wars. As adults, some children from Barnardo\u2019s Homes wrote to that organization\u2019s magazines, telling about their life experiences. In the Guild Messenger, for example, there is a letter from Harold Green in 1970. He wrote that he was brought to Canada in 1901 and later worked in farming and lumbering. He served in the First World War, took an auto mechanics course and eventually worked for the Ontario Forestry Service, retiring at age 70 with a pension.\n\nRead more about home children You can also read the detailed article about home children (PDF) from the British Isles Family History Society of Greater Ottawa.

They often include annual reports, information booklets and some lists of names of children. The files cover the years from 1892 to approximately 1946. Consult our Guide to Sending Organizations and Receiving Homes for relevant references and information about how to access those records.\n\nJuvenile Inspection Reports (RG76 C4c) Immigration officials created inspection report cards as they carried out regular inspections of children brought to Canada by various organizations. These records date from 1920 to 1932; however, there are a few from 1911 to 1917 and after 1932. There is usually one page per child, showing name, age or date of birth, year of arrival, ship, sending organization, the names and addresses of employers and final comments, e.g. \"completed, gone west.\" This series also includes inspection cards for some European children, including those brought to Canada by the Armenian Relief Association of Canada (1923-1932) and the Canadian Jewish War Orphans Committee (1920-1921). The inspection reports are available on the following microfilm reels, which can be viewed on site. The records are arranged in alphabetical order, not by organization.

Cameron), prospector; b. 1 Sept. 1820 in Charlottenburg Township, Glengarry County, Upper Canada, son of Angus Cameron and Isabella McDougal; m. first 20 Feb. 1860 Margaret Sophia Groves; m. secondly 1 March 1865 Christina Adelaide Wood; d. 7 Nov. 1888 at Barkerville, B.C.\n\nJohn Cameron spent much of his early life in Glengarry County. In the 1850s he was in California, apparently as a prospector, but had returned to Glengarry by 1860. When gold was discovered that year in the Cariboo district of the British Columbia interior, Cameron decided to go there. He arrived at Victoria, Vancouver Island, in February 1862 with his wife and an infant daughter who died soon after. In Victoria, Cameron met Robert Stevenson, another native of Glengarry County, who backed him in his first venture in British Columbia, that of transporting supplies into the Cariboo gold district. Cameron was also a partner in a small company which in August staked a claim on Williams Creek in the Cariboo \u2013 the famous Cameron Claim.\n\nOn 22 Dec. 1862 the miners on the Cameron Claim \u201cstruck it very rich at 22 feet.\u201d The claim soon became one of the largest operations in the Cariboo district and its success made Cameron a wealthy man. But prior to the strike, on 23 October, Margaret Sophia Cameron had died of typhoid fever and Cameron was determined to take his wife\u2019s body back to Canada West for burial. On the last day of January 1863 Cameron and Stevenson, escorted for a time by other miners, set out on a gruelling 400-mile journey to Victoria, hauling Sophia\u2019s body on a toboggan. They reached Victoria on 7 March and the body was buried there in an alcohol-filled coffin, pending its removal to the east. Cameron then returned to Williams Creek where he spent the summer working his claim.\n\nIn October 1863 Cameron left the Cariboo and, taking the coffin with him, travelled by way of the Isthmus of Panama and New York, reaching Cornwall, Canada West, before the end of the year. In December he had the coffin reburied. In March 1865 Cameron married Christina Adelaide Wood of Osnabruck Township and in July he laid the cornerstone of his imposing new residence, Fairfield House, at Summerstown in Glengarry County. In this period of prosperity, Cameron\u2019s often rash behaviour, extravagance, and arrogance tended to foster hostile speculation on how he had obtained his fortune. This speculation included references to the first Mrs Cameron, and there was much gossip about the contents of the mysterious sealed coffin. It was even suggested that an appearance of death was contrived and that Cameron had actually sold his wife to an Indian chief for gold. In 1873, more than ten years after his first wife\u2019s death, Cameron could bear his tormentors no longer and had the coffin raised. The face of Mrs Cameron, almost perfectly preserved in the alcohol, was exposed to the scrutiny of the public.\n\nHis windfall melted away, Cameron returned to British Columbia in 1886 or 1887. He died a poor man at Barkerville, the scene of his gold-mining success, and was buried nearby in the cemetery at Camerontown, a village named after him.\n\nRoyce MacGillivray"}, {"url": "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cameron-10549", "page_content": "John Gordon Cameron\n\n3 Oct 1841 in Durris, Kincardineshire, Scotland Bornin\n\nAncestors\n\nJessie (Henderson) Cameron Husband of\u2014 married about 15 May 1863 in Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, United Kingdom\n\nDescendants\n\n8 Mar 1903 at age 61 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada Diedin\n\nProfile last modified 8 Apr 2023 | Created 14 Jul 2020\n\nThis page has been accessed 161 times.\n\nBiography\n\nJohn Cameron is a member of Clan Cameron\n\nJohn Gordon Cameron was born on Oct 3, 1841, in Durris, Kincardineshire, Scotland, and was baptized there on Oct 25.[1][2]\n\nBy 1861, he was working as a house carpenter (journeyman) at Nether Sunnyside in Drumoak, Aberdeenshire, where he lived as a boarder.[3]\n\nJohn Cameron migrated from Scotland to Canada.\n\nJohn married Jessie Henderson in Aberdeen, where they started their family.

In all, the names of 7,308 immigrants are included in this volume.\n\n\n\nIrish Emigration Lists, 1833-1839: Lists of Emigrants Extracted from the Ordnance Survey Memoirs for Counties Londonderry and Antrim\n\nby Brian Mitchell\n\nThese Antrim and Londonderry memoirs lists have been extracted, arranged under parish, and alphabetized. They identify the emigrant's destination and his place of origin in Ireland \u2014 key information for anyone tracing his Irish ancestry. In addition, the age, town and address, year of emigration, and religious denomination are given for the approximately 3,000 emigrants identified in this book.\n\n\n\nIrish Emigration to New England Through the Port of Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, 1841-1849\n\nby Daniel F. Johnson\n\nSt. John's port was a magnet for Irish immigration during the decade that culminated in the Great Famine. However, a majority of these Irish immigrants eventually relocated to Boston or elsewhere in New England in order to rejoin their families. Since many arrived in Canada in a destitute or infirm condition, they were required to take temporary refuge in the alms and work houses, hospitals, and asylums of St. John. Many of the records of these institutions have survived, and with their help the author has created a surrogate record for some 7,000 persons who never appeared in the official passenger lists.\n\nA List of Alien Passengers, Bonded from January 1, 1847, to January 1, 1851, for the Use of the Overseers of the Poor, in the Commonwealth\n\nby J.B. Munroe\n\nPrepared by the Superintendent for the city of Boston in 1851 and covering a four-year period, this alphabetical list includes a bonded passenger's date of arrival in Boston, name, age, birth place, and the name of vessel on which he sailed.\n\n\n\nEmigrants from Ireland, 1847-1852: State-Aided Emigration Schemes from Crown Estates in Ireland\n\nby Eilish Ellis\n\nThis work contains a history of the emigration scheme and a list of the emigrants from each estate with the following details: name, age, occupation, family relationships, date and place of departure, date and place of arrival in the U.S., and name of ship. Most of the emigrants arrived at the port of New York, while a handful disembarked in Quebec.\n\n\n\nIrish Passenger Lists, 1847-1871: Lists of Passengers Sailing from Londonderry to America on Ships of the J. & J. Cooke Line and the McCorkell Line\n\ncompiled under the direction of Brian Mitchell\n\nThese passenger lists, which cover the period of the Great Famine and its aftermath, identify the emigrants' actual places of residence, as well as their port of departure and nationality. Essentially business records, the lists were developed from the order books of two main passenger lines operating out of Londonderry: J. & J. Cooke (1847-67) and William McCorkell & Co. (1863-71). Both sets of records provide the emigrant's name, age, and address, and the name of the ship. The Cooke lists provide the ship's destination and year of sailing, while the McCorkell lists provide the date engaged and the scheduled sailing date. Altogether 27,495 passengers are identified.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/james-cockburn", "page_content": "James Cockburn participated in the Qu\u00e9bec Conference of 1864. His crowning achievement was serving as Canada\u2019s first Speaker in the House of Commons.\n\nEarly Life and Career\n\nJames Cockburn, the son of a merchant, was born in Berwick-upon-Tweed, England. When his family immigrated to Lower Canada in 1832, his father settled them in Montr\u00e9al but soon died of cholera. Cockburn\u2019s mother subsequently moved the family to York (Toronto). There, Cockburn was educated at Upper Canada College. He went on to study law and gained admission to the Bar of Upper Canada in 1846. He then moved to Cobourg, where he practised law and participated in various business endeavours. By 1866, he was nearly bankrupt after his business affairs ran into difficulties. He never restored his financial position throughout the rest of his life.\n\nPolitical Career\n\nThough James Cockburn wasn\u2019t a prominent lawyer and proved to be a poor businessman, he did see some success in politics. He served on the Cobourg Town Council from 1855 to 1856 and again from 1858 to 1859. His reputation as an honest man who dealt fairly with local matters presented him as a strong candidate for the Legislative Council.\n\nIn 1861, Cockburn was elected as an independent candidate to represent Northumberland West in the Legislative Assembly, defeating John A. Macdonald\u2019s postmaster general. During the election, Macdonald initially described Cockburn as \u201ca Tory of the old school,\u201d indicating that he belonged to \u201cthe old fossil party\u201d that was a legacy of the Family Compact. But Cockburn was a strong nationalist and expressed his desire to see all political parties united in common interest. This leaning allowed him to empathize with Macdonald, who saw the need to unite the provinces. By 1862, Cockburn\u2019s support of a proposed militia act saw him emerge as a supporter of Macdonald. In 1863, he was elected by acclamation as a Liberal-Conservative, and in the following year he won a by-election. He was appointed solicitor general in March 1864.\n\nConfederation\n\nAs a member of the Great Coalition, James Cockburn was an attending delegate at the Qu\u00e9bec Conference in 1864. Cockburn endorsed representation by population, but he wanted unity of political opinion for it to be achieved. However, Cockburn\u2019s contributions to the proceedings in Qu\u00e9bec, and his participation in debates on Confederation in the Legislative Assembly, are negligible. Documentation from the period indicates that he barely spoke a word. Despite his silence, during the delegation tour following the Qu\u00e9bec Conference, Cockburn hosted a dinner meeting in Cobourg. This stop is predominantly seen as a move to please the local delegate, who at that point was a loyal supporter of John A. Macdonald.\n\nSee also Ontario and Confederation.\n\nLife and Career after Confederation\n\nJames Cockburn was elected as a Conservative by acclamation to the first federal Parliament in 1867, but he was demoted from his ministerial role. He instead served as Speaker of the House of Commons until 1874. The Liberals held him in low regard during that period, and members from Qu\u00e9bec also expressed displeasure at his inability to speak French \u2014 though he did understand the language. He lost his seat for Northumberland West in 1874 and when he ran in a by-election for Northumberland East, he was again unsuccessful. He managed to win re-election in 1878 and served until 1881.\n\nCockburn was labelled \u201can inferior man\u201d by Alexander Mackenzie. In the later years of his life, he became ill and moved his family to Ottawa in an attempt to re-establish himself as a lawyer, but even then he remained destitute, relieved by occasional bits of Tory patronage.\n\nLegacy\n\nJames Cockburn is not seen as an overly distinguished parliamentarian. He focused on attending to patronage problems among his constituents and tended to his portfolio in a routine manner. However, his unanimous appointment as Speaker secured him a place in history. He was the first Speaker in the Dominion, and the only Speaker who was a Father of Confederation. His careful study of parliamentary law and his cool temperament in managing parliamentarians is seen as having established the tact with which Speakers who followed perform their duties. Historian Percy Climo labels Cockburn\u2019s time as Speaker as being his \u201ccrowning achievement.\u201d"}]}
