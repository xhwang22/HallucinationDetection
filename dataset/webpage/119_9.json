His father, Roy Beggs, was also a politician, having served as the UUP Member of Parliament (MP) for East Antrim from 1983 to 2005. Beggs Jr served as a local councillor on Carrickfergus Borough Council from 2001 to 2011, during which time he held various positions of responsibility, including Chairman of the District Policing Partnership and Vice-Chairman of the Local Strategic Partnership and of the Community Safety Partnership.\n\nIn 2011, Beggs was elected as Deputy Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, a role he held until 2016. During his time in the Assembly, he served as a member of various committees, including the Social Development Committee, Public Accounts Committee, Health Committee, Environment Committee, Finance Committee, and Agriculture Committee. He is also the UUP spokesperson on Social Development.\n\nBeggs is known for his actions in 2003, when he successfully lobbied Aer Lingus to remove Irish rebel music from their in-flight entertainment.

He likened the situation to \"the speeches of Osama Bin Laden being played on a trans-Atlantic Arabian airline.\" Aer Lingus removed the material from their flights immediately, stating that it should never have been on board in the first place.\n\nThroughout his career, Beggs has been known for his commitment to public safety and community development. He has been a strong advocate for increasing funding for mental health services, improving road safety, and promoting economic development in Northern Ireland. He has also been a vocal opponent of political violence and sectarianism, and has worked tirelessly to build bridges between different communities in the region.\n\nOverall, Roy Beggs Jr is a well-respected politician with a long track record of public service. His dedication to the people of East Antrim and Northern Ireland as a whole has earned him the admiration of his constituents and colleagues alike. As he moves on from his role as an MLA, his legacy will continue to be felt throughout the region for many years to come.\n\nElection results\n\nRoy Beggs Jr, a seasoned politician and long-standing member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, suffered a shock defeat in the 2022 election at the hands of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland. This brought to an end his uninterrupted run of electoral successes since 1998.\n\nBeggs Jr had been a force to be reckoned with in the political landscape, having won the popular vote in two separate elections, and had been a key player in the Unionist cause for decades. However, his failure to secure re-election in 2022 has left many wondering where it all went wrong.\n\nDespite starting strong with a 16.1% share of the vote in 1998, Beggs Jr's popularity dwindled over time, with just 10.2% of the vote in 2007. While he had always been a prominent figure in Unionist politics, it seems that his appeal may have waned in recent years.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Assembly is a notoriously volatile arena, with the political landscape shifting rapidly over time. Beggs Jr may have fallen foul of this instability, finding himself out of step with the changing attitudes of the electorate.\n\nOr perhaps it was simply a case of the Alliance Party capitalizing on a moment of weakness, seizing the opportunity to make their mark on the political landscape. Whatever the case, Beggs Jr's defeat is a timely reminder that no one can take electoral success for granted.\n\nIn the cutthroat world of politics, it's important to remain vigilant and adaptable, constantly reassessing one's position and staying on top of the latest trends and developments. Beggs Jr's defeat may be a bitter pill to swallow, but it serves as a valuable lesson for politicians everywhere.\n\nAs for the Alliance Party, they can take heart in their triumph, but they must not rest on their laurels. The political landscape is ever-changing, and they will need to remain vigilant if they hope to maintain their newfound dominance. One thing is certain, the Northern Ireland Assembly will remain a hotly contested arena for many years to come."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/roy.beggs/1896218", "page_content": "Roy Beggs\n\npolitician speaker\n\nJuly 3, 1962 Glenoe, United Kingdom\n\nHe served as a local councillor on Carrickfergus Borough Council from 2001 to 2011.

Understood to date back to 1820, the B1 Listed Building has been sympathetically renovated, with listed features restored to their original character, at a cost of approximately \u00a3600,000.\n\nThe substantial refurbishment, carried out by Weir Bros Construction (NI) Ltd, Aughnacloy, includes a host of modern facilities and amenities which will allow the Royal Black Institution to flourish in the 21st century.\n\nThese include new administrative offices, exhibition space, a library to house the Institution\u2019s collection of books and artefacts, meeting rooms, reception area, kitchen, toilet block, outdoor memorial area, and car parking facilities.\n\nThe Loughgall building is the first time the Loyal Order \u2013 founded in 1797 \u2013 has ever owned its headquarters.\n\nThe Institution had been an anchor tenant in Brownlow House, Lurgan, since the late 1920s. Prior to being in Lurgan, the organisation\u2019s administrative base was located in Dublin and Belfast.\n\nThe Royal Black moved out of Brownlow House in 2019 to temporary premises in Loughgall, beside the Museum of Orange Heritage at Sloan\u2019s House.\n\nNow, the Institution is looking forward to taking up residence in their own purpose-built administrative centre.\n\n\u201cThe opening of our new headquarters will be a landmark day in the history of the Royal Black Institution,\u201d said Rev Anderson.\n\n\u201cThis project has been one of the biggest and most important ever undertaken by the Imperial Grand Black Chapter of the British Commonwealth.\n\n\u201cThe need for our own headquarters was discussed and agreed in 2013, we purchased the Loughgall building in 2018, renovation work began in May 2020, and I\u2019m delighted to say we\u2019re ready to cut the ribbon on Saturday, April 2, 2022.\n\n\u201cIt has been a long road to get to this point, and there have been many challenges along the way.\n\n\u201cWe had originally hoped to open the building in 2021, so that the unveiling would form part of our celebrations for the centenary of Northern Ireland. However, the Covid pandemic wreaked havoc with our work schedule. But we were fairly relaxed about the delay as our focus was always about completing the building to a high standard rather than rushing to a completion date.\n\n\u201cThere are so many people to thank for all their hard work but I would like to take this opportunity to pay special tribute to the contractors, Weir Bros Construction, for their professionalism and attention to detail, and to our own Clerk of Works, Edgar Patterson, and Quantity Surveyor, Keith Anderson, and the entire Royal Black HQ project team, for their passion, commitment and expertise over the last few years.\n\n\u201cThanks to the efforts of everyone involved, we now have modern headquarters from which we can proudly maintain our stand for the Reformed Faith and strengthen our Christian and charitable outreach.\u201d\n\nThe building itself has an interesting history. At one stage it was a public house known as the Rock Tavern. Afterwards, a temperance advocate, Cecilia Cope, turned it into a coffee house. A later inhabitant was Field Marshal Sir Gerald Templer, a senior British Army officer and former Chief of the Imperial General Staff, who fought in both world wars. In more recent times it housed a popular antiques business.\n\nThe grand opening on Saturday, April 2 will also include the opening of a \u201cLeaders\u2019 Legacy\u201d exhibition on the lives of past Sovereign Grand Masters, and the unveiling and dedication of a bust of Sir Norman Stronge.\n\nSir Norman Stronge was a former Sovereign Grand Master who led the Institution from 1948 to 1971.\n\nA hero of the Somme and a senior Ulster Unionist politician, having served for 23 years as Speaker of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland, he was cruelly murdered in January 1981 when an IRA gang burst into his home, Tynan Abbey in Co Armagh, and shot dead the 86-year-old, together with his only son, James, also a member of the Institution."}]}
