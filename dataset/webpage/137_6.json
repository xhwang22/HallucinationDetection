{"After college, Paul Taylor moved to Los Angeles.": [{"url": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-ca-paul-taylor-20100502-story.html", "page_content": "Paul Taylor laughs out loud when he sums up how critics responded to his early, out-there choreography: \u201cThis terrible boy has ruined our evening!\u201d\n\nHe can well afford to laugh. The Paul Taylor Dance Company is now 56 years old, a stable, permanent exception in the seat-of-the-pants world of modern dance. His minimalist experiments of the \u201850s long ago evolved into the audience-friendly masterworks \u2014 some lyrical, some mordant, some hilarious \u2014 that have won him scads of honors and awards, including a MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d grant, an Emmy and the National Medal of Arts. These days, critics are more likely to respond with rapture to the diverse dances he\u2019s still inventing, to Beethoven, to Poulenc, to the Mamas and the Papas, even as he approaches his 80th birthday. \u201cHe continues to surprise me even when he returns to familiar themes,\u201d says dance writer Anna Kisselgoff, who has followed his career since the 1960s.\n\nAudiences who turn up for the 16-member company\u2019s two performances May 8 at the Birch North Park Theatre in San Diego (part of the La Jolla Music Society\u2019s Dance Series) could be surprised as well if they\u2019re not familiar with the choreographer\u2019s range. In fact, those unaware that the Taylor company dances only his works might be forgiven for assuming that the program showcases three different artists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPublic Domain,\u201d a 1968 piece set to a collage of recordings that are, yes, in the public domain, is by a madcap comedian. The creator of \u201cPiazzolla Caldera,\u201d which had its premiere in 1997, uses music by Astor Piazzolla and Jerzy Peterburshsky to feed steamy, tango-flavored couplings. And the virtuoso who made \u201cPromethean Fire\u201d in 2002 lives in an altogether different, elevated realm, combining majestic music by Bach with images of collapse and renewal to evoke 9/11.\n\nThe man who answers the door at Taylor\u2019s Lower East Side apartment is none of the above \u2014 more like a kindly, soft-spoken, slightly rumpled professor. But that \u201cterrible boy\u201d hasn\u2019t gone away, frequently indulging his impish instincts during a recent conversation in his light-filled living room overlooking the East River.\n\nGive him an opening and he\u2019ll blithely skewer a dance icon, saying of Fred Astaire, \u201cHe looks like a mosquito to me. He\u2019s too lightweight. Just to flap your feet around is not enough.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll be no less flippant about one of his own, best-loved dances: \u201cWhen you\u2019ve seen \u2018Esplanade\u2019 this many times, you go, \u2018Oh, when will it be over?\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe grins as he confides that a chunk of his MacArthur loot, won in 1985, went toward six place settings of Tiffany silver \u2014 on sale, of course.\n\nHe regales you, and himself, with reminiscences of Sugar (pronounced \u201cShugah\u201d), the cheerful white Yorkshire pig he lived with until she outgrew his car.\n\nAnd he\u2019s downright subversive when it comes to cigarettes, which he lights steadily as he talks: \u201cNobody tells you the things about smoking that help you. Cigarettes keep you awake, for one thing. They give you extra energy, for another. And now these health addicts think they\u2019re going to die\u201d \u2014 he breaks the word into two, long syllables \u2014 \u201cif they even come close to a cigarette butt.\u201d\n\nYes, he knows such remarks will get him into trouble. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he says, sounding exactly the way he claims to feel \u2014 \u201clike a teenager.\u201d (If a teenager were a dance legend.)\n\nOf course, he concedes, his body says different. He walks more slowly. He sleeps less. He daydreams more. And there\u2019s another area that betrays his age: technology. Taylor doesn\u2019t use a computer (\u201cI went through about four before throwing them all out \u2014 they made me so angry.\u201d); he doesn\u2019t have a cellphone (\u201cI don\u2019t need it, I really don\u2019t. If somebody wants to call me and it\u2019s important, they\u2019ll call me back.\u201d); his music is all analog, even though the tape players he favors are no longer in production (\u201cI\u2019ve stocked up on second-hand ones. I can edit tapes myself with a razor blade, I can stop and start and find my place.\u201d).\n\nHis eye remains sharp, however, and fully engaged, when it comes to dance. \u201cI love watching my dancers,\u201d he says. \u201cThey always are new to me, and fresh.\u201d ( He still heads into the studio eagerly, somewhat regretful that the company\u2019s administrators limit him to two premieres a year. (Last year\u2019s, his 130th and 131st, were a comic romp about vaudeville, \u201cAlso Playing,\u201d and a round robin of sexy flirtations, \u201cBrief Encounters.\u201d) \u201cMy main job is to crank out new dance, which I love.\n\n\u201cEach time I start a new piece, even if I have some plan in my mind, it\u2019s almost as if I\u2019ve never made a dance before. Which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. Of course, I fall back on things that I\u2019ve tried before. But hopefully, I\u2019ve made them look different. And I steal. I steal from other choreographers \u2014 we all do.\u201d\n\nThen he adds, chortling, \u201cBut I try to make it better.\u201d (He credits Antony Tudorand his mentor, Martha Graham, as the sources of most of his thievery.)\n\nHe doesn\u2019t always succeed, he says, maintaining that he\u2019s had misfires that \u201cno one will ever see again.\u201d Still, it\u2019s been a while since a dance went so \u201chaywire,\u201d he notes, that he had to ditch it and start over.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting better,\u201d his visitor suggests.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m more easily satisfied,\u201d he responds.\n\nHe\u2019s noticed other changes over the decades. \u201cThere are more dancers around, and they have better, stronger technique these days,\u201d he says. But that makes the competition for work all the stiffer, and they struggle in an environment far different from environment than the one he found as a young dancer in New York.\n\n\u201cI was lucky,\u201d he says. \u201cI happened to be a big guy, and they always wanted big guys. There weren\u2019t that many to pick from. \u2026In those days, you could live \u2014 if you call it living \u2014 very, very cheaply. Go to Chock Full o\u2019 Nuts or the Automat and get a sandwich. Subways were cheap, and you did a lot of walking. And when you\u2019re young, you can live with no heat in a crummy place.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s young dancers, he suspects, have somewhat different expectations. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they feel any less strongly about wanting to be dancers,\u201d he says. \u201cI think they\u2019re committed. It\u2019s just that, well, times have changed. I was a Depression baby.\u201d\n\nOne thing that\u2019s stayed the same, he notes, is that modern dance choreographers \u201cdon\u2019t want to do what the previous generation has done. They want to find their own way.\u201d If that should entail ruining somebody\u2019s evening, well, what of it? It\u2019s worked out well enough for Taylor, who\u2019s looking forward to more years in the studio \u2014 his parents both lived into their 90s \u2014 and who knows his company, and his dances, will be around after he\u2019s gone. Plans are in place for the company to survive him. \u201cIt will have to become more of a repertory company, with different choreographers,\u201d he says, \u201cand that\u2019s fine.\n\n\u201cPeople always want something new.\u201d\n\ncalendar@latimes.com"}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-paul-taylor-dance-review-20170507-story.html", "page_content": "Now 86, Paul Taylor has been making dances for more than 60 years. His artistic legacy far exceeds, and reverberates much wider, than the sum of his individual pieces.\n\nIn preparation for a future Paul Taylor Dance Company without the master, outside choreographers have been invited in to make works for Taylor\u2019s exemplary dancers. Taking a different tack from the late Merce Cunningham, who decided his troupe would close after his death, Taylor\u2019s will go forward.\n\nWhen the New York-based group settled into the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts this past weekend, however, the program focused on decades past: \u201cSyzygy\u201d from 1987; \u201cThe Word,\u201d from 1998; and the still-fresh and always uplifting \u201cEsplanade,\u201d from 1975. One takeaway from all three was his masterful way with group movement, and how he uses it \u2014 in an unsurpassed way \u2014 as a force to express good and evil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSyzygy\u201d is an astronomical term referring to celestial bodies at opposing points in an orbit, but consider this to be a prompt mostly, for a work of whirling athletic forcefulness. Taylor gives us a central female dancer \u2014 on Saturday night it was the frisky and musical Madelyn Ho \u2014 who seems to regulate a gravitational push and pull in which the others are caught.\n\nBeyond that suggestion of an ongoing relationship, the dance, to a commissioned score by Donald York, overflows with messy, squiggly gestures of apparent randomness and increasing energy. Taylor clumps male and female dancers separately at first, but then these gender groupings splinter into smaller, mixed partnerships.\n\nDancers whiz through half-cartwheels and fling arms loosely outward. Bodies are as pliable as a slack rope. When Robert Kleinendorst lifts the petite Ho above his head, her knees bounce off one of his shoulders then the next. Dancers spin one-footed using centripetal force, and the piece concludes with Ho slowly rotating.\n\n\u201cThe Word\u201d is one of several Taylor pieces condemning religious group-think. This is the fierce and morose side of the choreographer, and the piece carries a stench of tribal violence, to an equally dark score by David Israel (all music was recorded).\n\nEleven grim-faced men and women pound heavily with their feet, fingers in white-knuckled fists. They are anonymously alike with slicked scalps, white faces and blackened eyes, dressed in short pants, ties and white shirts by designer Santo Loquasto. A scowling Parisa Khobdeh storms through the scenes as a demon temptress, clad in a unitard with reddened nipples, her hair flying.\n\nThanks to lighting designs by Jennifer Tipton, larger-than-life shadows on the backdrop trail the congregation. Fear and shame grip them. Jamie Rae Walker, one of the outstanding soloists, fearlessly throws herself backward, head to the floor, one virtuoso move in a night full of them.\n\nThe sun shines again in \u201cEsplanade,\u201d a piece of everyday walks, runs and breathtaking slides, to selections by J. S. Bach. Dancers reassuringly touch and carry one another. Taylor does inject sadness into a middle section \u2014 because darkness and light coexist in this choreographer\u2019s works. But the final arms-open gesture of joyful greeting, warmly delivered by Michelle Fleet, allows the audience to exit with hope.\n\nSIGN UP for the free Essential Arts & Culture newsletter \u00bb\n\nSupport coverage of SoCal arts.

I figured if you plan strategically and intelligently, everything must go according to plan.\n\nThis belief was a driving force throughout my college years. I thought if I focused on my journalism major, took up as many extracurriculars as possible, and accepted internship after internship, I would live the life I always dreamed of. I figured if I followed this plan, nothing could go wrong.\n\nAfter working hard to set up my dream career in New York, it all started to fall apart\n\nBy 2017, two years after college, I had fallen out of love with journalism. I was laid off and was collecting unemployment for the seventh month in a row. I wondered where it had all gone wrong. I felt like it was time to move on and to try something new.\n\nIn the back of my mind, I've always wanted to work in the TV and movie industry. I dreamed of writing for the popular TV shows, punching up scripts in a writer's room, and seeing it all air on national TV. After struggling to find a job and cashing what seemed like my 1,000th unemployment check, I decided to attempt to break into Hollywood.\n\nI took a leap of faith and moved to Los Angeles ... but that didn't work out either\n\nI packed most of my belongings into one suitcase and subleased my Brooklyn apartment to a stranger. Everyone asked, \"What are you going to do when you get there?\" I didn't know how to answer. For the first time in my life, I didn't have a plan. I was forging a new path with absolutely no foresight as to what was going to happen.\n\nLAX airport. Frank Olito/ Insider\n\nI landed in Los Angeles in February 2017 and was ready to start my new life. I was wide-eyed and excited about my future.\n\nUnfortunately, after three months, everything fell apart again. I still had no job, no car, no money, and I was jumping from sublet to sublet in a city I barely knew. At the end of the three months, I booked a flight home to New York and considered my move across the country a failure.\n\nThree years have passed, and now, I have reframed that time in my life as a success. In fact, if I had the choice, I would do it all over again.\n\nThe experience brought me out of my comfort zone\n\nFor most of my life, I've lived on the East Coast. I grew up in Long Island, went to school in Boston, and then returned to New York after college. I am an East Coaster through and through, so my decision to move across the country gave me the opportunity to live somewhere completely different than anything I had known.\n\nMe at Griffith Observatory in LA. Frank Olito/ Insider\n\nFor starters, I am used to taking public transit everywhere I go. In Los Angeles, I had to get comfortable with driving again. I had to acclimate to sunny, warm weather, I had to get used to the Los Angeleno fitness culture, and I had to understand that everyone in LA works in the \"industry.\"\n\nNot to mention, I was actively looking for a job, so I had to network, reach out to people, and set up meetings \u2014 all of which were difficult as an introvert.\n\nGetting out of my comfort zone took me to new places and introduced me to new people. Moving to LA taught me that living outside of your comfort zone will bring you exciting opportunities, and it's the way I've lived ever since.\n\nThe move taught me to not be afraid of fear\n\nThe weeks prior to moving to Los Angeles were filled with anxiety and nerves. It was a scary thought to move across the country away from friends and family. It gave me anxiety to think about what I would actually do once I got there.\n\nBut in the end, I decided that fear is a good thing: A safe life could lead to a stagnant life. I moved across the country because I was scared. At that time, I knew I needed to wake myself up by doing something that truly frightened me.\n\nSince then, I've implemented that practice into my daily life. If something gives me pause, I sometimes do it anyway (as long as it's not dangerous) because we only have one life and we need to live it to the fullest.\n\nI also learned how to be comfortable with loneliness\n\nWhen I moved to Los Angeles, I had one friend in the city and knew I would be spending a lot of time alone. Although I've always been somewhat of an introvert, the loneliness did get unbearable at certain times. I would go for walks, sit in a cafe, or go to networking events and meetups just to feel included.\n\nOverlooking the Hollywood Hills after a hike. Frank Olito/ Insider\n\nToday, I am more comfortable being alone. I actually feel joy taking a walk by myself or sitting in a cafe for hours. Since my journey to LA, I've even taken several solo trips and explored new cities by myself. Moving to Los Angeles gave me the confidence to do that.\n\nI rediscovered a passion I thought I left behind\n\nBefore moving to LA, I fell out of love with journalism, and then the industry gave me the boot by laying me off. At the time, I thought my career in journalism was over and that I would start working in a new, creative industry.\n\nWhile in Los Angeles, however, something interesting happened. I started reading more news, interviewing more people for freelance articles, and suddenly, I was falling in love with journalism again. Turns out, I just needed a break from the industry to learn that it's what I really want to do with my life.\n\nIf I didn't take a break from journalism and move to Los Angeles to pursue a different career, I would have never realized that journalism is my true passion.\n\nEven though it didn't work out, I don't have to constantly wonder, 'What if?'\n\nRegrets are a part of life but now I don't have to wonder what could have happened if I moved to Los Angeles and tried my hand at something new. Instead, I get to look back at a time in my life when I took a chance. Ten or 15 years down the road, I don't have to regret not making that choice.\n\nYes, the best-laid plans often don't go according to plan, but I learned that's OK.\n\nRead more:"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/business/hollywood-apartment-social-media.html", "page_content": "Others see living at 1600 Vine as a golden marketing opportunity.\n\nTaylor Offer and Parker Burr moved in last year hoping to befriend social media stars not for their own fame but to promote their sock company, Feat Socks. When Mr. Offer first visited the two-bedroom unit, he said, it was like \u201cwalking into Jerry\u2019s apartment building on \u2018Seinfeld\u2019\u201d because he recognized it from Vine videos. He signed a lease on the spot, needing to prove only that he and Mr. Burr could afford the $3,700 monthly rent.\n\nBut Mr. Offer soon realized it wasn\u2019t enough to live in the building; they had to help the influencers fill their daily need for content. So Mr. Offer bought a cute English bulldog puppy and a flashy Polaris Slingshot car. The puppy appeared in a video with Ms. Cerny while Logan Paul took an interest in the purple car, a three-wheeled vehicle that looks like a roadster.\n\nA star like Mr. Paul has his pick of sponsorship deals, but he took a liking to his new neighbors, so he concocted a bet \u2014 or, more accurately, a social media story line. If Mr. Paul could sell 20,000 pairs of socks (printed with an image of his colorful parrot, Maverick), he would get the roadster. He promoted the bet in videos and, even though he fell short, Feat had its best sales month ever and Mr. Paul received a $200,000 commission check.\n\n\u201cAs a business expense,\u201d Mr. Offer said, \u201cthis place pays for itself.\u201d\n\nReality Show\n\nCalling 1600 Vine home is still no guarantee of influencer status.

He was 88.\n\nThe cause of death was not immediately available, but Labrado said Taylor was in hospice care.\n\nTaylor had worked well into his 80s, venturing into his company's New York studios to choreograph two new pieces a year, and 147 in all.\n\n\u201cThe works that satisfy me the most?

Times review of Paul Taylor Dance, Lewis Segal wrote of the choreographer, \u201cOther societies would long ago have named him a Living National Treasure. Here, at 83, he continues to assert his power to delight, amuse and possibly even anger audiences with programs such as the varied and challenging one his company danced Friday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.\u201d\n\nMichelle Fleet rises above her fellow Paul Taylor Dance Company members last year in a performance of \u201cEsplanade\u201d at the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills. (Rob Latour / Shutterstock)\n\nTaylor's signature work was \u201cEsplanade\u201d (1975), an explosion of joy and athleticism, with Taylor's limber dancers running, skipping, hurling themselves into each other's arms like missiles and tumbling to the floor with abandon, all to two Bach concertos.\n\nThe pairing of classical music \u2014 especially 18th century Baroque \u2014 with a very modern style of dance was one of Taylor's hallmarks. But he also went far and wide with his musical choices, scoring his works not only with symphonies and concertos but ragtime, tango, barbershop quartet and even elevator music.\n\n\u201cBig Bertha\u201d (1970) was most notable for its disturbing content, reflecting Taylor's penchant for giving equal time to the darkest depths of human nature. A wholesome 1950s couple and their young daughter come out to a carnival, but after feeding coins into a robotic creature named Bertha, the family slips into depravity; by the end, the father has raped and killed his pig-tailed daughter.\n\nEven a lighter work, \u201cCompany B,\u201d a set of jaunty dances to the music of the Andrews Sisters, has its dark elements: Look closely amid the joyful dances and you see young men as soldiers, shot and crumpling to the ground.\n\nA strong message always emanated from Taylor's work, said dance writer Allan Ullrich. \u201cYou know he's always saying something,\u201d Ullrich said. \u201cThere should be two words written on his tombstone: \u2018He communicated.\u2019\u201d\n\nPaul Belleville Taylor Jr. was born July 29, 1930, during the Great Depression. He began his life in a town outside Pittsburgh but spent much of his youth in the Washington, D.C., area. In his whimsically written autobiography, \u201cPrivate Domain,\u201d he describes a childhood full of boundary-testing moments: a run-in with police after he and a friend steal a baby stroller from a variety store, or a prep-school stunt involving the excavation of a coffin.\n\nHe wound up at Syracuse University, where he studied painting and then joined the swim team, purely to gain scholarship money. The college sport was more work than he expected, but at 6 feet tall and with a huge arm span, he was well-suited to it.\n\nPaul Taylor in 1960 with the New York City Ballet. (Carl Van Vechten / Library of Congress / AFP / Getty Images)\n\nThose arms, swinging through space, would become crucial to his dance work. In fact, Taylor's signature move looks a bit like a swimmer in mid-butterfly stroke, albeit twisted up to the sky.\n\nBut the desire to dance came as a shock to Taylor: In his sophomore year, he once wrote, he experienced \u201csomething stronger than an itch.\u201d\n\nTaylor transferred to Juilliard in New York, but first he attended a summer dance course where he met, and learned from, the great modern choreographer Martha Graham. Years later, his name would become forever linked with hers as part of the great trio of modern dance choreographers, along with Merce Cunningham. (Graham died in 1991, Cunningham in 2009.)\n\nA year after graduating Juilliard in 1953, Taylor set up his own company, rehearsing in whatever space he could find. He was 24, and his first work was a collaboration with the artist Robert Rauschenberg, \u201cJack and the Beanstalk.\u201d A year later he joined Graham's company as a soloist. He would dance there for seven seasons while continuing to build his own company.\n\nIn 1956 Taylor choreographed one of his odder, much-discussed works: \u201c3 Epitaphs,\u201d the oldest work in his company's repertoire today. For the score, he chose early New Orleans jazz. He set five peculiar creatures \u2014 something like futuristic cavemen \u2014 gyrating across the stage, dressed head-to-toe in dark gray unitards, designed by Rauschenberg, with reflectors shining on their heads and hands.\n\nIn 1959, Taylor collaborated with another giant of dance, George Balanchine of the New York City Ballet, in his \u201cEpisodes.\u201d The great Russian-born ballet master asked him to dance, Taylor has said, \u201clike fly in glass of milk.\u201d Balanchine also offered Taylor a permanent job but he turned it down, put off by the formal strictures of ballet.\n\nTaylor's dancing career ended abruptly in 1974 after he collapsed onstage from illness and exhaustion during a performance in Brooklyn. But as a choreographer, he was just getting going: A year later came \u201cEsplanade,\u201d later celebrated as one of the most wondrous works of dance anywhere.\n\nTaylor was known for not only exploring death and despair but also for showing his sense of humor. Sometimes it was merely weird, as in the curious \u201cPhantasmagoria\u201d (2011), which featured a Byzantine nun having a naughty interaction with a toy snake, not to mention an Irish step dancer, a group of Isadora Duncan disciples, a Depression-era Bowery bum and a character with an infectious dancing virus \u2014 all set to Renaissance music.\n\nBut at other times it had a classic flair, as in the 1995 \u201cOffenbach Overtures,\u201d a foray into pure comedy and clowning to the spirited music of 19th century French composer Jacques Offenbach, where buffoonish soldiers mixed with coquettish can-can dancers.\n\nFor Taylor, choreography was a calling he could not deny.\n\n\u201cTo put it simply, I make dances because I can't help it,\u201d he wrote in an essay titled \u201cWhy I Make Dances.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorking on dances has become a way of life, an addiction that at times resembles a fatal disease.

I ended up staying for three more years after school, and I still think it's the most incredible place in the world.\n\nBut I felt like I needed a change. Things were growing a bit stagnant in my life, so in hopes of finding work in the film industry, I packed up and moved to Los Angeles.\n\nOf course, I expected some things to be very different \u2014 the weather, the food, the transportation \u2014 but there have been a few differences that I didn't foresee as well.\n\nAs a lifelong East Coaster, here are the things that surprised me the most about moving to California:\n\nI adjusted to the climate more quickly than I expected\n\nNow, I find myself reaching for a sweater when the temperature dips below 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Shutterstock\n\nComing from the Northeast, with its bitter winters and humid summers, it's been pretty amusing to witness Southern California's versions of seasons.\n\nI can't help chuckling to myself when I see people bundled up in Arctic-strength parkas on a day that's 65 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nBut that said, I became accustomed to the climate much faster than I thought I would. After just a couple of weeks of being spoiled by sunny days above 70 degrees, I started feeling chilly when the temperature would start dropping in the evenings.\n\nNow, I grab a light jacket anytime I think the temperature might dip into the 50s. In New York, if it got into the 50s in the spring, I'd be taking off my coat.\n\nCar-less living is surprisingly easy in LA\n\nI thought it would be harder to move here without a car. AP/Eric Risberg\n\nHaving spent my entire adulthood in New York City, where it's pretty rare for someone to own a car, I was prepared for some difficulty adjusting to LA, where living without one is apparently unheard of.\n\nLots of people told me that it couldn't be done \u2014 that the public transit in California wasn't very good, and that I'd spend a fortune on ride-share apps.\n\nBut getting around without a car ended up being way more feasible than I had been made to expect.\n\nAlthough I'm used to the well-established and expansive public-transit lines available in NYC, LA's bus and train system is actually super helpful \u2014 it even has some advantages over New York. These trains, though they don't cover as much ground, are generally on time and clean.\n\nAnd when I can't take the train, ride-share apps can get me farther for less money than they did in New York.\n\nCalifornians are surprisingly very down to travel long distances\n\nBoy, do Californians love a road trip.\n\nAll of the places I had seen Angelenos visit in movies and on TV, like Joshua Tree National Park, Palm Springs, and Lake Tahoe, are way farther from the city than I had imagined. For East Coasters (at least, the ones I know), a two-hour or three-hour drive is a big ordeal and is probably reserved for special occasions.\n\nIn my experience, though, people who live in Los Angeles are down to drive three to five hours for a spontaneous weekend trip. And an hour-long drive to Malibu for a beach day is a common occurrence.\n\nThe food is equally delicious, but totally different, in LA\n\nIn-N-Out Burger is a popular West Coast chain. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nIt always seems to be a big debate as to which coast, or which major city, has the best food in the country. Living in California now, I understand why it's so hard to parse out.\n\nNew York has a world-class restaurant scene, where chefs are doing some of the most interesting things out of any culinary city in the world. But California has the natural advantage of delicious, fresh ingredients. It seems like so many vegetables and fruits grow here, so food in restaurants and grocery stores is enhanced exponentially by the amazing produce.\n\nIn New York, I felt like I had to be extra eagle-eyed when buying produce, but there are no sad, pinkish tomatoes or avocados that never quite ripen in Los Angeles.\n\nThat said, there are a handful of things I just can't seem to find in California. Specifically, big, cheap portions of takeout (especially Chinese food) and, of course, a decent bagel.\n\nFinding an apartment in LA was so much easier than getting one in NYC\n\nIn New York, the process of hunting for and securing real estate is notoriously head-spinning. You generally need to have a lot of financial documentation, sometimes a letter of recommendation from a former landlord, and a cashier's check ready fast, or else someone else will probably snap your place up.\n\nAnd if your yearly salary isn't at least 40 times a month's rent, you might need a guarantor to sign on as well.\n\nIn Los Angeles, this is not the rule of thumb. I visited two apartments, picked the second one I saw, and the property manager told me there was \"no rush\" in getting him my deposit.\n\nI couldn't believe it.\n\nAdditionally, the approval process was much less rigorous. My years of apartment hunting in New York prepared me for a much more intense and complicated process than I actually had to deal with here.\n\nIn LA, I think there's more of a laid-back attitude toward drinking alcohol and smoking weed\n\nYou can buy wine at a grocery store in LA. Shutterstock\n\nGrowing up in Connecticut and living in New York as an adult, I was always confused when my friends who grew up on the West Coast would ask me to pick up a bottle of wine from the grocery store. Because of the laws in those East Coast states, wine and liquor can only be purchased at designated liquor stores, not grocery stores or bodegas.\n\nBut in California, you can pick up wine and liquor while you're shopping for your groceries. It's a small difference, but it was a little jarring to see full wine and liquor sections in grocery stores when I first arrived.\n\nPlus, cannabis is legal up and down the West Coast. It's decriminalized in New York and legal in a few New England states, so it's not as though marijuana usage is rare on the East Coast, but it seems so much more out in the open in LA and, as a result, it seems to be less stigmatized.\n\nI mean, there are dispensaries here that look super high-tech and billboards advertising delivery-service start-ups all over the city. It's also not scandalous or strange at all for a well-to-do professional to also be a frequent cannabis user here, which still doesn't seem to be the case back east.\n\nOverall, things really do seem to be more chill in California\n\nAs far as I can tell, it's not just a stereotype \u2014 people seem to be more relaxed, and things are slower-paced here in LA.\n\nPeople take longer lunches, they love getting outside, and, despite the traffic, there's much less road rage here than there is in NYC.\n\nI do often miss the pace of New York and the to-the-point attitude of East Coasters, though.\n\nI'm getting better at making friendly conversations with chatty strangers, but sometimes I miss having public solitude. I also miss how New Yorkers always seemed to bond by complaining \u2014 my candidness doesn't seem as welcome in LA.\n\nDeep down, I'm still very much an East Coaster at heart \u2014 but so far, I'm loving the sunshine, the fresh avocados, and the overall relaxed vibe of the West Coast.\n\nRead More:"}, {"url": "https://stageandcinema.com/2021/06/12/paul-taylor-dance-at-dusk/", "page_content": "THE MUSIC CENTER WELCOMES BACK\n\nPAUL TAYLOR DANCE COMPANY\n\nLos Angeles\u2019s Music Center has a hit on its hands with its DANCE AT DUSK outdoor performance series.

Their second child had always been small for his age, but in Taylor Harris\u2019 memoir, \u201cThis Boy We Made,\u201d she recalls trying to sort out maternal anxiety from her sense that something was seriously wrong.\n\nThus begins their family\u2019s continuing quest to name Tophs\u2019 ailment. It has led to years of genetic testing, of trying to connect those findings with Tophs\u2019 range of symptoms. He is now 9 and has two sisters \u2014 Eliot, 11, and Juliet, 5.\n\nFor many years Harris was a stay-at-home mother dealing with many demands, including her clinical anxiety and Tophs\u2019 baffling conditions. (Fluctuations in his blood-sugar levels affect his development; the cause remains unknown.) Now, in her debut book, she carefully collects the pearls of experience and strings them together in a wide-ranging and profound memoir, exploring her relationship with God \u2014 first as an anxious child and then as a concerned mother \u2014 but also her frustrations as a Black woman seeking answers from a dismissive establishment, alongside daily struggles any parent would find familiar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFormerly residents of Charlottesville, Va., she and her husband of 16 years recently moved to State College, Pa., where Paul is on the faculty at Penn State. Over the end-of-year holidays, Harris and I exchanged emails in which she described America\u2019s institutional shortcomings, writing through anxiety, her evolving faith and why you should bring a friend to a doctor\u2019s appointment.\n\nWhat prompted you to share your family\u2019s story?\n\nI really do write to find out what I\u2019m thinking. I have a strong memory but it thrives on storing images and emotions and some facts, as well as useless quotes from Adam Sandler films. I can\u2019t tell you what color the walls of my bedroom are without looking but I can remember how a particular doctor\u2019s appointment unfolded or the exact genetic mutations we discussed, or how my gut felt when we left the hospital without answers. Imagine a brain like mine, filled with images of a charismatic but sometimes sick child, storing links between mutations and related diseases, gathering disappointment and sadness (but then joy) at every turn. I was overwhelmed. I would drown without a way to sort through, to make sense of it all. I didn\u2019t have to publish it but I did have to write it.\n\nYour experiences of the medical system as a Black woman are stories I think not enough people hear. Do you have advice on how to be your own advocate? And how to solve this disparity overall?\n\nI would suggest having a spouse, partner, friend \u2014 someone you trust \u2014 or heck, someone you meet at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts who looks the part, either come with you or be on speakerphone. If you are the tough-as-nails, cool-under-pressure type, you might not need this. But if, like me, you are prone to second-guessing yourself or being flooded with emotions and doubt, I would consider having a trusted person on speed dial who can say, \u201cStand your ground. Don\u2019t let them gaslight you.\u201d I have brilliant Black friends in the medical system who are working every day to change policy and perceptions. For me, it\u2019s walking into an appointment with notes, or knowing the name of a doctor in the hospital, or remembering that I can look at someone in a white coat and say, \u201cI need a minute to think about that.\u201d The burden should not be on individual mothers, so please don\u2019t take my advice in that way. I\u2019m not saying personal over policy. These are just the things that I arm myself with.\n\nYou write in the book about your hunger for a diagnosis. Can you talk about how naming something affects its perception?\n\nIn looking for a name, I was looking for two things: an anchor and a community. Wrapped up in community is the desire to be seen and acknowledged. I kept wanting to ask teachers and doctors, \u201cHave you ever seen another kid like Tophs?\u201d If another Tophs-like kid existed, I could find his parents, we could nod in agreement over coffee, I could say, \u201cUs too.\u201d\n\nWhat I mean by \u201canchor\u201d is a place to land the plane, a sort of home. I realize not everyone wants a name for what they experience, and that\u2019s valid. But with Tophs, I was not scared of a label defining him. I thought, if we can find a place to land, we can start to look around, and either find a map or make our own, and we will have a place to rest and belong.\n\n(Counterpoint)\n\nYour anxiety as a parent predated your concerns over Tophs. Has writing helped you cope with it?\n\nBecause of medication and years of therapy, I rarely have panic attacks anymore, but holy moly is the anxiety still present. Every illness or symptom my child exhibits has to make it through a firewall in my brain. I do not want to be overreacting. That\u2019s kind of silly, right? Likely not useful. But one shift that is useful is my willingness to talk to my kids about it. I want them to know Mommy tried really hard to work with this condition because she felt called to the craft of writing, but it took more effort than she could put into words. Writing allows me to tell my story, leave a legacy of truth for my children.\n\nIn some ways, writing is perfect for an anxious introvert who might need more breaks than the next person. In other ways, writing is terrible, at least if you\u2019re writing for publication. When I\u2019m working through edits or waiting for a response from an editor, I certainly wish I had more skills that used a different part of my brain. I\u2019m not great with gardening or building things, so I usually bake. This is how I end up baking and eating banana peanut butter Oreo blondies at 10 p.m.\n\nCaring for Tophs also meant interacting with the school system. I have friends who have been through the IEP [individualized education plan] process, and I can\u2019t think of one of them who loved the experience. Do you think school administrators make this an ordeal to discourage folks from accessing it?\n\nI\u2019m not sure why. It reminds me of the math and science classes in college that you hear exist to weed out students, and particularly Black students at predominantly white institutions like [the University of Virginia]. I\u2019m always curious what happened \u2014 was the administrator or educator always like this? If not, what jaded them? What is their boss saying to them? What does the research say?\n\nNo one could point to what the cutoff was on certain tests Tophs took [in order to qualify for IEP]. Was it the 12th percentile? The 16th? Or were people making it up as they went along? Sometimes what\u2019s not written is just as important as what\u2019s written in that thick packet of rights they hand you before the meeting. Educational policy is not my area of study, but all I can say is that if Paul and I wanted to overturn tables like Jesus, I imagine there are many other Black families finding themselves frustrated or discouraged.\n\nYour relationship with God plays a huge role in your life. Have you found that your embrace of the science involved in Tophs\u2019 medical care has enriched your faith?\n\nYes, it has. It\u2019s helped me realize I want nothing to do with the health prosperity gospel. [It] has taught me so much and strengthened my belief that God and science are not at war. As a younger Christian, so much of my development centered on people in the church praying things away. They did it out of love for me, and I would love to be free of pathological fear. But how damaging is it to spend so much time trying to rid yourself of this thing you\u2019ve had since birth? What if, instead, I get to ask Jesus what it means to sit with him in the fear? To say, \u201cI\u2019m tired, Jesus. I don\u2019t have answers. But promise you\u2019ll still stay a while?\u201d\n\nTophs doesn\u2019t have it all figured out. Sometimes he\u2019s scared about COVID or seizures. But that boy loves life and truly trusts that God has given him a gift. He doesn\u2019t have to separate fear or disability from righteousness or good living. He\u2019s onto something.\n\nWhen did you first become aware of your desire to write?\n\nI love this question. In first grade, I had this young, beautiful teacher named Mrs. Hall. I worshiped her. She had the \u201980s hair, with the sides flared out, and she brought us Fudge Stripe cookies on special days. She must have been fresh out of school, but she recognized that I loved writing in my journal, that I didn\u2019t want to stop when it was time to move on. So she\u2019d let me sit at a table or against the wall in the hallway and write until I was done. Because she gave attention to it, I gave attention to it. She saw this timid but perceptive Black girl among a sea of white faces and prioritized my delight above her own schedule. I can\u2019t give her enough credit for that.\n\nBerry writes for a number of publications and tweets @BerryFLW."}, {"url": "https://www.popsugar.com/smart-living/how-i-moved-to-new-york-city-after-college-47173845", "page_content": "When I decided to buy a one-way plane ticket and give myself a month to move from California to New York City, there was a general consensus amongst my friends that what I was doing was crazy, but it didn't feel that way to me \u2014 and that's why I'm writing this from a cute cafe in Brooklyn. All that my big decision and move required was a few steps of preparation and a willingness to take an adventure. Here is how I did it; hopefully it helps you do the same.\n\n1. Prepare Mentally\n\nIn my experience, this is the most important step. I spontaneously bought the plane ticket that would take me to New York, but I probably thought about the idea of moving there for about three years before getting to that step. At the beginning of my senior year in college, like everyone else, I was thinking about the job market and where I should go. I majored in journalism and creative writing and needed to live somewhere with an ample amount of writing opportunities. Los Angeles crossed my mind since I grew up in the area and have family there, but something was telling me New York would be a better fit. Still, I knew the wish to move to New York wasn't enough. I had to take a few steps before making the move across the country, but the first step was to know exactly that.\n\n2. And Prepare Financially\n\nWhen I first thought about moving to New York, I knew I would need to save a lot of money \u2014 a writer living in one of the most expensive cities in America? Whew. So I decided I would go home to California after graduation for the free rent (I was lucky to have that option!) and to get a customer service job that would allow me to save. Even at this point I wasn't completely sure about New York, so I thought this time would also help me figure out how I really felt about it (and see if my parents were into the idea as well).\n\nAfter I worked and saved for about six months at home, I had enough money in my bank account to buy my ticket. The more I romanticized my decision and fantasized about the future, the farther I got from really taking action. There were times when I thought about living my \"I came to New York with one dollar and a dream!\" fantasy, but I was lying to myself. If I wanted to make and survive the move, I would need to line up as many job opportunities as I could.\n\n3. Research the City and What You'll Need to Live There\n\nPreparing for this move reminded me of how I would prepare for the public speaking class I took in high school. I researched . . . a lot! My anxiety flares up when I feel uninformed on the subjects I'm discussing and the decisions I'm making. So in the weeks leading up to buying my ticket, I watched hours of \"How I Moved to New York\" Youtube videos to gather information on rent prices in different neighborhoods. I thought about the weather and how much a legitimate Winter jacket would cost, because I knew my teddy coat was only useful in Southern California. I had no friends or relatives living in the city and I would have to rely on myself, which meant I would survive only if I prepared as much as I possibly could.\n\n4. Just Do It\n\nThe last three steps are what turned this formidable and daunting move into a realistic goal, and once I had everything else in place, it was up to me to take action. I could have done more research and saved more money forever, but I believed in myself, so I just bought the ticket. After I prepared, there was nothing stopping me except for myself.\n\nI've been in New York for a little over a month and I've cried multiple times, but in no way, shape, or form do I regret my decision. I'm proud of myself for handling something like this and tackling such a daunting task. My advice is to trust yourself, even if that means listening to that little voice in your heart saying you are so not ready. Daunting tasks are way less scary when you believe in your intuition and don't let your brain get fogged up with unlikely possibilities."}, {"url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2014/02/04/jax-taylor-miami-past-changed-name-vanderpump-rules/", "page_content": "\u201cWhy did you move from Miami to L.A. and change your name from Jason to Jax?\u201d Tom asked, a question that really seemed to irritate his former best friend.\n\nUm\u2026 What?!\n\nGiven that revelation \u2014 which we\u2019re hoping will be expanded upon during the two-part Vanderpump Rules reunion \u2014 we decided to see what else we could dig up about Jax\u2019s history, using the two best resources at our disposal: the internet, and our weirdly obsessive retention of facts revealed on the show.\n\nStassi Quitting The Show?\n\nJax Taylor\u2019s Past: Fun Facts About His Life Before \u2018Vanderpump Rules\u2019\n\n1.

In 1990, the band was nominated for an American Music Award for \"Best New Heavy Metal Band.\" As the music scene changed in the early to mid-1990s due to the popularity of grunge, their success faded after their third release Pull.\n\nWinger disbanded in 1994. In 2001 they reunited and have since conducted several successful tours. In 2006, the band's 1993 touring line-up (minus Paul Taylor but including John Roth) reunited to record the band's first studio album in over 13 years, IV, and toured in support of the album into 2008.\n\nIn 2009, the band released their fifth album, Karma. As of 2013, Winger was performing on mini-tours, festivals and private events. Their most recent album, Better Days Comin', came out in 2014.\n\nHistory:\n\nMain career and break-up (1987\u20131994).\n\nThe debut album, Winger, was released on August 10, 1988 on Atlantic Records. The record was a success, achieving platinum status in the United States, and gold status in Japan and Canada. On February 11, 1989, the album peaked at number 21 on the Billboard 200, and was in various places on the chart for 63 weeks. Radio and MTV hits from the album included \"Madalaine\", \"Seventeen\", \"Headed for a Heartbreak\" and \"Hungry\". In 1990, the band was nominated for an American Music Award for \"Best New Heavy Metal Band\".\n\nShortly after that tour, Winger released its second album In the Heart of the Young, which went 1-and-1/2 platinum in the U.S. and gold in Japan. Hit radio tracks and MTV videos included \"Can't Get Enuff\", \"Miles Away\" and \"Easy Come Easy Go\".\n\nWinger followed the release of its second album with a 13-month world tour, playing over 230 dates with Kiss, Scorpions, ZZ Top, Extreme and Slaughter. Paul Taylor left the band after the tour, citing exhaustion after years of touring. Their third studio album, Pull, produced by Mike Shipley, was recorded in 1992/1993 as a three-piece band. It was originally to be called Blind Revolution Mad, after the opening song. Reportedly, Kip Winger, anticipating that critics would dismiss the album out of hand, renamed it Pull as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the CD being used by critics as a skeet-shooting target. The album was not as successful as the previous albums sales wise, but gained solid reviews. On the following tour, John Roth was called in to replace Paul Taylor on rhythm guitar. The album coincided with the rise of grunge, which swept aside the brand of melodic pop metal that Winger represented.\n\nIn the 1990s, Winger was subject to mockery from MTV's animated series Beavis and Butt-head. Series creator Mike Judge later revealed that he had been incorrectly informed that Kip Winger had asked the network not to make jokes about the band on the series, which led to further jokes about the band, but later learned from Winger himself that he had never made any such stipulation. \u201cStewart\u201d, an early character from the TV show, wore a Winger t-shirt during the shows original run on MTV during the early 90s.\n\nAfter disbanding in 1994, bassist/lead vocalist Kip Winger went on to a solo career, guitarist Reb Beach went on to touring projects with artists Dokken, Alice Cooper and has held a permanent guitar spot in Whitesnake since 2002. The band's other members pursued or resumed careers as session musicians.\n\nReunions (2001\u2013present)\n\nIn 2001, it was announced that all original members of the band would return to the studio to record the song \"On the Inside\" for The Very Best of Winger. In 2002, all five members embarked on a reunion tour of the U.S. and Canada on a bill with Poison. According to Kip Winger, in a 2008 interview with rock and roll comic C.C. Banana, it was important to include all five members because \"it was the big, long-awaited reunion so I wanted to include everybody who had ever been in the band.\" In 2003, it was confirmed that activity had been halted due to Reb Beach's touring commitment with Whitesnake as well as his solo album \"Masquerade\" and involvement with \"super-group\" project The Mob with King's X frontman Doug Pinnick and Night Ranger drummer Kelly Keagy.\n\nOn July 16, 2005, it was announced that Kip Winger would perform as the lead singer for the Alan Parsons Live Project at the Common Ground Music Festival in Lansing, Michigan. In May 2006, it was confirmed that Winger had reformed without one of its original members Paul Taylor, to record another album and tour Europe. The album, IV, was released in Europe in October and the nine-country \"Winger IV Tour\" ran in the last two weeks of the same month.\n\nOn February 25, 2008, the band performed in Providence, Rhode Island, as part of a benefit for survivors of the Station nightclub fire. The concert, along with other artists was debuted on VH1 Classic on March 23, 2008. In late 2009, it was confirmed that Winger would record a fifth album Karma, with a tour to support it. Most recently, John Roth became the guitarist for Giant and would appear on their forthcoming album Promise Land then set for release in February/March of 2010.\n\nWinger released their sixth studio album titled, Better Days Comin' in April 2014, after teasers were published on Kip Winger's website and on the official Winger Facebook page as well.\n\nAs of late 2018, Winger was playing club dates. They were scheduled on Dec 29, 2018 in Westland, Michigan.\n\nStyle and influences.\n\nThe band's musical style combines elements of glam metal and progressive metal. Kip Winger, in description of the band's musical ability and style, said, \"Our band was known to musicians, and a lot of musicians showed up to see me play \u2014 watching, trying to figure out how I'm playing. We were like the 'hair band' (version of) Dream Theater.\""}, {"url": "https://www.allmusic.com/artist/winger-mn0000678650/biography", "page_content": "Biography Winger Follow Artist +\n\nOne of the leading hair metal bands of the 1980s, they perfected the art of following fiery rock anthems with monster power ballads.\n\nRead Full Biography"}, {"url": "https://grande-rock.com/news/winger-to-release-new-studio-album-seven-on-may-5th-2023/", "page_content": "In celebration of their 35 years as a touring and recording act, multi-platinum artist Winger announce today the release of their new studio album \u201cSeven\u201d on May 5th, 2023.\n\nThe 12-track album, produced by Kip Winger and recorded in Nashville, will be distributed worldwide by Frontiers Records.\n\nAdditionally, the album\u2019s first single, \u201cProud Desperado\u201d, is now available for streaming/download on all digital music platforms here and a music video can be seen below.\n\n\u201cSeven\u201d, the band\u2019s first new release since 2014\u2019s \u201cBetter Days Comin\u201d, is now available for pre-order on CD, LP * Digital here.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.

Taylor experienced his first mainstream success in the early 1980s as the touring keyboardist in Canadian musician Aldo Nova\"s backing band, and he appears in the music video for Nova\"s biggest hit, \"Fantasy.\" Prior to forming Winger, Taylor and Kip Winger were both playing with Alice Cooper\"s backing band on the tours for Cooper\"s mid-80s albums, Constrictor (1986) and Raise Your Fist and Yell (1987). During this time, the two began composing songs together and, while on break from touring, recorded what would become the first Winger demos. Whereas Kip left Alice\"s band prior to the European leg of the 1987 tour, Paul remained on board for the European dates. However, in the midst of touring Europe, Paul received a call from Kip, who had been working with future Winger lead guitarist Reb Beach recording more demos in New York, informing him that he had gotten a record deal. After the European tour was finished, Paul flew straight back to New York, and the Winger project (initially known as \"Sahara\") began rehearsing and recording their debut album. Taylor remained in Winger throughout the band\"s most successful period, which included the two smash albums, Winger and In the Heart of the Young. However, after the tour supporting the latter album ended in 1991, Taylor left the band in early 1992, citing exhaustion and a desire to write and get involved with other projects. Throughout the 1990s, Taylor immersed himself in numerous other projects, perhaps the most prolific of which was recording and touring with Steve Perry for his 1994 solo album. In 1998, he returned to the Alice Cooper band (this time, alongside fellow former Winger guitarist Reb Beach), and once that tour ended, he embarked on a brief tour with Tommy Shaw. Winger reunited in 2001 to record new material for a Greatest Hits album. Although it is unclear whether Taylor participated in these recording sessions, he did later join the band on the supporting tour. Though Paul was asked by Kip Winger to rejoin the band again to work on their 2006 reunion album, he declined because he was already involved with other projects. More recently, Taylor has become involved in composing music for television series programs and has also been pursuing his passion for photography. He also spent the summer months of 2012 touring with Cinderella throughout the United States. playing keyboards for them.

Taking the name from its leader, Winger specialized in winning melodic metal formula, with strong influences from bands like Van Halen, AC/DC and Whitesnake\n\nThe band's eponymous debut in 1988 sold over a million copies on the strength of singles like \"Seventeen\" and the ballad \"Headed for a Heartbreak\u201d. Winger\u2019s second album, 1990's \u201cIn The Heart Of The Young\u201d, was slightly more melodic and showed a more mature and technical approach to the songs. It reached an equal success, selling over a million copies and featuring the hit power-ballad \"Miles Away\". Unfortunately the band didn't outlast the post-alternative pop-metal backlash and the group faded away after the release of the critically acclaimed 1993 album \u201cPull\u201d.\n\nAfter Winger went their separate ways, Kip decided to pursue a solo career. He started writing his own songs in a different style than to his previous band and his first album \"Thisconversationseemslikeadream\" was released in 1997, reflecting his new approach to songwriting with a style more akin to Peter Gabriel's music rather than to 80\u2019s Hard Rock.\n\nAn acoustic album of past favourites, \"Down Incognito\" was later released in 1999. Winger followed it with his second studio solo album, 2000's \"Songs from the Ocean Floor\", labelled as \u201cMasterpiece\u201d by several music critics around the world. After another acoustic solo tour Kip started to become involved in several new projects including writing music for movies, singing for Alan Parsons and of course the very successful Winger reunion that materialized in 2006 with the release of \"IV\" and the subsequent world tour.\n\nNow Kip Winger is back with his new solo album \"From the Moon to the Sun\": a true career defining statement and, once again, another cd which witnesses the creative evolution of the American composer.\n\n\u201cI am an artist that will continue to push the envelope into the direction that my ear and abilities are taking me, with no compromise\u201d, says Kip, adding \u201cI worked hard to make this record my best yet. For sure it is musically very diverse\u2026 Hence the title , From the Moon to the Sun\".\n\nThe music offered on the record is truly a flow that has no boundaries, from the fresh rock approach of songs like \u201cEvery Story Told\u201d, \u201cNothing\u201d or \u201cReason To Believe\u201d, to the Pop sensibilities of \u201cWhere Will You Go\u201d and \u201cCalifornia\u201d, to the acoustic mood of \u201cPages and Pages\u201d and \u201cIn Your Eyes Another Life\u201d, down to the unbelievable instrumental piece \u201cGhosts\u201d, \u201cFrom the Moon to the Sun\u201d brings the listener to a journey in a kaleidoscope of different moods.\n\nThe album sees also musical contributions from Rod Morgenstein and Ken Mary on drums, Andy Timmons and Rob Eberhard Young on guitar, Alan Pasqua on piano, Cenk Eroglu on songwriting, keyboards and guitars.\n\nRock Acoustic Hard Rock 80s"}, {"url": "https://www.rocknews.co.uk/blog/2023/03/11/winger-announce-new-album-seven-out-on-5th-may/", "page_content": "In celebration of their 35 years as a touring and recording act, multi-platinum artist WINGER announce today the release of Seven on May 5.\n\n\n\nThe 12-track album, produced by Kip Winger and recorded in Nashville, will be distributed worldwide by Frontiers Records.\n\n\n\nSeven, the band\u2019s first new release since 2014\u2019s Better Days Comin\u2019, is now available for pre-order on CD/LP/Digital here.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the album\u2019s first single, \u201cProud Desperado,\u201d is now available for streaming/download on all digital music platforms here\n\nWinger are one of the only bands formed during the late \u201980s that still features all original members \u2014 Kip Winger, Reb Beach, Rod Morgenstein, and Paul Taylor.
