{"Tony La Russa Jr. ranks third all-time in major league wins as a manager, trailing only Connie Mack and John McGraw.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tony-La-Russa", "page_content": "Tony La Russa, byname of Anthony La Russa, Jr., (born October 4, 1944, Tampa, Florida, U.S.), American professional baseball manager who led his teams to three World Series titles (1989, 2006, and 2011) and was one of the winningest managers in major league history.\n\nLa Russa signed to play baseball with the Kansas City Athletics (or \u201cA\u2019s\u201d) out of high school. He spent the majority of his 16-season playing career in the minor leagues, but he appeared sporadically in the majors with the A\u2019s (both in Kansas City and, later, in Oakland, where the franchise moved), the Atlanta Braves, and the Chicago Cubs. He was named the manager of a minor-league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox in 1978, and his first big-league managerial job came the following year, when he took over the White Sox late in the 1979 season.\n\nBritannica Quiz I Am the Greatest (Athlete)\n\nThe cerebral La Russa\u2014who earned a law degree shortly before assuming managerial duties in Chicago\u2014proved to be a natural leader in the clubhouse. He developed a managerial style that consisted of frequent in-game situational substitutions that came in response to the great attention he paid to the nuances and flow of a particular game (which occasionally led to criticism that La Russa \u201covermanaged\u201d). In 1983 he guided the White Sox to a 99-win season and the team\u2019s first playoff appearance in 24 years. However, a slow start to the 1986 campaign and a strained working relationship with the team\u2019s new general manager (former outfielder Ken Harrelson, who left the announcing booth to spend only one tumultuous season running the White Sox) led to La Russa\u2019s being fired three months into the season. He was out of work for less than a month before he was hired to manage the A\u2019s.\n\nLa Russa quickly turned the A\u2019s into the most-dominant team in baseball. He led Oakland to the highest win total in the major leagues for three straight seasons (1988\u201390), each of which also ended with the Athletics\u2019 winning the American League (AL) pennant. The team was upset in two of its World Series appearances during that period, but the A\u2019s did defeat the San Francisco Giants to win a championship in 1989. La Russa and the A\u2019s won another division title in 1992, but after the team posted three consecutive losing seasons (1993\u201395), he opted out of his contract and signed with the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nLa Russa\u2019s third managerial stint was even more successful than his first two. In his initial season in St. Louis, he guided the Cardinals to the first of seven division titles the team would win during his tenure. The Cardinals won a National League (NL) pennant in 2004, and in 2006 the team beat the Detroit Tigers to win the World Series. In 2011 La Russa led St. Louis on improbable comebacks to clinch a postseason berth (after trailing in the Wild Card standings by 8 1/2 games with a month remaining in the regular season) and to win the World Series (after twice being one strike away from elimination). La Russa retired soon after earning his third championship ring. He had been named the AL\u2019s Manager of the Year three times (1983, 1988, and 1992) and won the NL\u2019s version of the award in 2002.\n\nThree years after his retirement from managing, La Russa joined the Arizona Diamondbacks as the team\u2019s chief baseball officer. He was demoted to an advisory role with the franchise following the 2016 season after the Diamondbacks ran off three consecutive losing campaigns during his tenure, and he left the team after the 2017 season. La Russa then joined the Boston Red Sox as an assistant to the team\u2019s general manager. After the 2020 season he returned to the Chicago White Sox as general manager. In his first season back with the team, Chicago finished first in the Central Division, and La Russa won his 2,764th game, which moved him into second place for most career wins by a general manager. In the 2021 postseason the White Sox lost in the AL Division Series.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

That said, one question that will be asked by fans in the future will be this: Where does Tony La Russa stand on the list of all-time MLB managers?\n\nIf you ask White Sox fans who were disappointed in the way the 2021 playoffs ended, their opinions of La Russa may be lower than those of fans outside the Windy City. There is just no getting around the fact that fans had high hopes for 2021. However, in spite of those disgruntled Sox fans, it would be grossly to assess La Russa\"s career by looking at just one season.\n\nSo, we are going to take a step back and look at the whole body of his work as an MLB manager and put it all into context. How does La Russa stack up to other MLB managers?\n\nTony La Russa: By The Numbers\n\nWhile numbers do not tell the whole story, baseball is the most statistically-driven sport in the world. Looking at numbers can be a valuable way of comparing managers, coaches, or players, for that matter. To that end, La Russa has put up some outstanding numbers in his managerial career. Some may be more meaningful than others, and fans will no doubt have their own thoughts about statistics. Yet, we believe that looking at La Russa\"s career numbers offers great insight into his effectiveness as an MLB manager.\n\nWins And Losses: Regular Season\n\nSo, one measure of effectiveness would be the number of wins. In looking at regular-season totals, Tony La Russa ranks second on the all-time wins list behind only Connie Mack. La Russa has a total of 2,821 wins, compared to Mack\"s 3,731. Nobody will ever come close to catching Mack on this list. However, in comparing winning percentages, La Russa checks in at .537, while Mack stands at .486. Meanwhile, John McGraw finished his managerial career with 2,763 wins and a winning percentage of .586. So, McGraw\"s and La Russa\"s numbers are fairly comparable.\n\nPostseason Records\n\nInterestingly, in terms of postseason accomplishments, Mack had a won/loss percentage of .558, while La Russa sits at .538. Meanwhile, McGraw was under .500 at .481. To put these numbers into a larger perspective, only 11 managers have won 2,000 or more games. La Russa is right in the middle of these 11, in terms of postseason winning percentage. Those ahead of him include Mack, Joe Torre, Sparky Anderson, Joe McCarthy, and Bruce Bochy. As far as World Series titles go, La Russa is tied for sixth place with three titles. Mccarthy and Casey Stengel top the list with seven, while Mack won five times. Torre and Walter Alston are tied for fourth place with four titles each.\n\nPutting The Numbers In Context\n\nAll of the numbers above need a little context if we are to evaluate La Russa fairly and objectively. Mack and McGraw both managed in many different eras when the game was played very differently than today. Each iteration of baseball has presented its own challenges, to be sure. With that said, Tony La Russa matches up pretty well with both of these managing legends. While it would be impossible to compare the three managers with total certainty, it would be difficult to say that La Russa\"s career is grossly inferior to those of Mack and McGraw.\n\nThe other side of this assessment would include a look at the careers of La Russa\"s peers, those managers whose careers also covered the divisional era. In this group, we find Torre, Anderson, Bochy, Baker, Bobby Cox, Lou Piniella, Terry Francona, Jim Leyland, Mike Scioscia, and Tommy Lasorda. Obviously, La Russa leads this class in wins. As far as percentages go, La Russa ranks fifth out of 11. However, except for Cox, the other three ahead of La Russa are only ahead by three points or less.\n\nLooking at postseason winning percentages, La Russa ranks fifth, trailing Torre, Anderson, Bochy, and Francona. For that matter, La Russa is third in the number of postseason games managed in this group, trailing only Cox and Bochy. So, he has plenty of postseason experience, although nobody will ever match Cox\"s record of 14 straight division titles. Finally, championships are as good a measure of managers as any other measure. Within this group, only Torre has more than La Russa, with four titles. La Russa is tied with Bochy and Anderson at three, while Francona and Lasorda each have two. Leyland, Piniella, Cox and Scoscia have one each. Baker is hoping for a 2021 miracle to score his first World Series title.\n\nSo, Where Does La Russa Stand?\n\nIn the final analysis, baseball fans invariably will look at winning as the criterion for evaluating managers, fair or not. While there are always intangibles involved, baseball is a bottom-line sport, and everybody loves a winner. In light of that, and considering the different eras of baseball, establishing Tony La Russa\"s place in the all-time managing ranks can be challenging. However, by any objective measure, La Russa must be accorded a spot in the top 10 all-time managers.\n\nExactly where he stands is open to debate; however, it is hard to imagine any objective fan taking all of the above into account, and suggesting otherwise. He is far from perfect, and his White Sox team may come up short in 2022, as well.\n\nYet, Tony La Russa is undeniably one of the very best all-time MLB managers, no matter what criteria one may use. While White Sox fans would love to see him add one more title to his illustrious career, his place in MLB history is already assured. Well done, Tony.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @SouthsideMike5 for more of my content. Don\u2019t forget to listen to our baseball podcast, Cheap Seats Chatter!

This marks the third National League pennant for the Cardinals in the past eight seasons. But a question arises from this latest feat: Can we proclaim La Russa the greatest manager of all time?\n\nThe Case for Tony La Russa\n\nHow many managers in baseball history have won World Series championships with both an American League team and a National League team? Other than La Russa, only one other managed to achieve that\u2014Sparky Anderson! La Russa won World Series championships managing the 1989 Oakland Athletics and the 2006 St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nHow many managers have led at least three teams to division titles? Billy Martin and Joe Torre are the only managers that come immediately to mind.\n\nHowever, Joe Torre never won a pennant with any other team but the New York Yankees. And Billy Martin had just one World Series championship that could easily be chalked up to George Steinbrenner for his signing of Reggie Jackson in the offseason prior to the 1977 season.\n\nTony La Russa has 12 division titles and six pennants (1988, 1989, 1990, 2004, 2006, 2011) while leading three different clubs to the League Championship Series (Chicago White Sox, Oakland Athletics and St. Louis Cardinals).\n\nHow many managers have had a 30+ year managerial career and never finished a season with 100+ losses? Even the legendary Casey Stengel finished a season with a stunning 120 losses with the 1962 New York Mets.\n\nConnie Mack, the great Philadelphia Athletics manager in the early 20th century, had a disastrous 1916 season when the A's finished with 117 losses. Furthermore, three times in the final ten seasons of Mack's managerial career with the Philadelphia Athletics between 1941 and 1950 did his club finish with 100 or more losses.\n\nThe only two managers besides La Russa that had a 30+ year managerial career and avoided any 100+ loss seasons were Joe Torre and John McGraw. Torre did have a couple of seasons where his teams flirted with 100, falling short with 99 and 96 losses. McGraw did all of his great work with one franchise, the New York Giants.\n\nThe Case against La Russa\n\n\n\n\n\nPending the outcome of the 2011 World Series, La Russa has only two World Series championships. This puts him well behind managers like Casey Stengel, John McGraw, Joe Torre and Connie Mack, all who won a heck of a lot more than two. Stengel managed the Yankees to seven World Series championships! Connie Mack had five World Series championships!\n\nFurthermore, La Russa's achievements in Oakland where the Athletics won three consecutive American League pennants from 1988 to 1990 get overshadowed by other circumstances. That powerful club he led to the Fall Classic during that three-year period included ballplayers who would later be among the most tainted during the Steroid Era, players like Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco.\n\nAdditionally, the one World Series title Oakland captured during that period is most remembered for the devastating earthquake that delayed Game 3 of that series for several weeks while San Francisco recovered from the damage.\n\nDespite more than 2,700 victories in his managerial career, Connie Mack and John McGraw remain very well ahead on that list. After all, Connie Mack managed for 50 years!\n\nSo the debate is set on the managerial greatness of Tony La Russa. Is he the greatest of all time? Or is there more he needs to achieve in order to remove all possible doubt?"}, {"url": "https://www.sportscasting.com/how-many-teams-has-tony-la-russa-managed/", "page_content": "After nearly a decade out of the dugout, 76-year-old Tony La Russa, who currently serves as the senior adviser of baseball operations for the Los Angeles Angels, may be resuming his career as a manager. And he may be doing it with the team that gave his first managing job, the Chicago White Sox.\n\nFollowing a disappointing end to their 2020 season, the White Sox parted ways with manager Rick Renteria earlier this week and have reportedly received permission from the Angels to interview La Russa, who last served as a manager in 2011, a season in which he led the St. Louis Cardinals to a World Series title.\n\nSince leaving the Cardinals, Tony La Russa has held executive roles with Major League Baseball, the Arizona Diamondbacks, the Boston Red Sox, and, of course, the Angels. The 2014 Hall of Fame inductee, who also spent six seasons in the big leagues as a player, still seems to be very passionate about the game and is viewed by many as one of the greatest managers in MLB history.\n\nTony LaRussa began his managerial career with the Chicago White Sox\n\nFive years after his final game as a player, Tony La Russa was given his first job as a manager by the Chicago White Sox organization in 1978. La Russa managed the team\u2019s Double-A affiliate, the Knoxville Sox, for half a season before joining the big club midway through the year when the White Sox fired Bob Lemon and replaced him with Larry Doby. Doby was then fired at the end of the season and replaced by Don Kessinger, who served as a player-coach to begin the 1979 campaign. La Russa began that season as the manager of the Triple-A Iowa Oaks but was made the manager in Chicago when the White Sox fired Kessinger in late June.\n\nTony La Russa was named American League Manager of the Year in 1983 when he led the Sox to the ALCS but was fired less than three years later after Chicago got off to a 26-38 start to begin the 1986 season. In parts of eight seasons with the White Sox, La Russa posted a record of 522-510.\n\nHe led the Oakland A\u2019s to a World Series title in 1989\n\nLess than three weeks after being fired by the White Sox, Tony La Russa was named the manager of the Oakland A\u2019s in late July 1986, with whom he\u2019d spent parts of five seasons as a player.\n\nIt certainly didn\u2019t take long for the A\u2019s to become contenders under La Russa\u2019s management. Oakland made their first World Series appearance in 14 years in 1988, a season in which La Russa was named AL Manager of the Year, but lost to the Dodgers in five games. The following season, the A\u2019s won the World Series by sweeping the Giants, a series most remembered for being delayed due to the earthquake that occurred just before the start of Game 3. La Russa and the A\u2019s were huge favorites in the 1990 World Series but were swept by the Reds.\n\nTony La Russa won his third AL Manager of the Year award, his second with the A\u2019s, in 1992 by leading Oakland to its fourth AL West title in five years before losing to the Blue Jays in the ALCS. He managed the A\u2019s for three more seasons and ended his career in Oakland following the 1995 season. In 10 seasons with the A\u2019s, he amassed a record of 798-673.\n\nTony La Russa managed the St. Louis Cardinals for 16 seasons and won two World Series\n\nTony La Russa | Jeff Curry/Getty Images\n\nTony La Russa joined the St. Louis Cardinals ahead of the 1996 season, replacing interim manager Mike Jorgensen, who managed 96 games after the team fired Joe Torre during the 1995 season. Torre, of course, went on to win four World Series titles as the manager of the New York Yankees.\n\nIn his first season in St. Louis, La Russa led the Cardinals to a division title, the team\u2019s first since 1987. St. Louis lost to the Atlanta Braves in the NLCS in seven games. La Russa and the Cardinals returned to the postseason in 2000 and made the playoffs in six of seven seasons, a stretch that included two World Series appearances. St. Louis lost to the Red Sox in 2004 and defeated the Tigers in 2006.\n\nTony La Russa led the Cardinals to another World Series win in 2011, his last season with the team. In 16 seasons in St. Louis, La Russa posted a record of 1,408-1,182. His 2,728 career wins as a manager are good for third on the all-time list behind only John McGraw (2,763) and Connie Mack (3,731).\n\nAll stats courtesy of Baseball Reference"}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/31579230/chicago-white-sox-tony-la-russa-passes-john-mcgraw-second-most-career-wins-mlb-manager", "page_content": "The Chicago White Sox's Tony La Russa moved into second place on MLB's all-time manager wins list with his 2,764th career victory on Sunday.\n\nLa Russa passed John McGraw after his team beat the Detroit Tigers 3-0 in Chicago. He now trails only Connie Mack.\n\n\"He was a much better player than I was, and he has a much higher winning percentage,\" La Russa joked of McGraw. \"I beat him with longevity and great situations.\"\n\nLa Russa, 76, came out of a 10-year retirement to take over the ultra-loaded White Sox after beginning his career with the same job in Chicago in 1979. He went on to manage the Oakland Athletics and St. Louis Cardinals before retiring the first time following the 2011 season. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\n\"It's not about the staff,\" La Russa said. \"It's about the players.\"\n\nHaving said that, La Russa was quick to praise all his coaches over his career, as well as his current boss. White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf allowed La Russa to be fired once, calling it the biggest regret of his time as owner. He was the driving force behind bringing La Russa back for a second stint with the White Sox.\n\n\"Early on, he read my bubble gum card and saw what a crappy player I was, so he's the one that started putting outstanding coaches with this manager, who had no clue,\" La Russa said.\n\nIt resonated with La Russa that this latest accomplishment came on the 77th anniversary of D-Day; the team put the movie \"The Longest Day\" on in the clubhouse before Sunday's game. He expressed an appreciation for those in uniform, then pointed to his own jersey as the White Sox have a special place in his heart as well.\n\nMost Wins By MLB Manager Connie Mack 3,731 Tony La Russa 2,764 John McGraw 2,763 Bobby Cox 2,504 Joe Torre 2,326 Sparky Anderson 2,194 Bucky Harris 2,158 Joe McCarthy 2,125 Walter Alston 2,040 Leo Durocher 2,008\n\n\"Lot of pieces to this day including this uniform and coming back here to have it happen,\" La Russa said. \"It's just overwhelming.

I didn't think this was ever going to happen.\n\n\"The year I retired (in 2011), my family was very upset. They wanted this to happen.\"\n\nIt took nearly a decade, but La Russa finally moved ahead of McGraw. His players weren't aware what was at stake on Sunday, but were more than happy to be a part of baseball history.\n\n\"You have to respect him,\" winning pitcher Dylan Cease (4-2) said. \"It's pretty legendary to say we get to play for him.

He takes over for Rick Renteria after what the White Sox insisted was a mutual agreement to split.\n\n\"We are extremely excited about the future of this team,'' general manager Rick Hahn said Thursday. \"As we showed in 2020, this is a young, talented club that we expect to only grow better and better in the coming years. Adding in a Hall of Fame manager who is recognized as being one of the best in the history of the game, we are a step closer to our goal of bringing White Sox fans another championship.''\n\nLa Russa inherits a team loaded with young stars and productive veterans that made the playoffs for the first time since 2008, only to sputter down the stretch and get knocked out in the wild-card round.\n\nHe becomes the oldest manager in the major leagues by five years. Houston's Dusty Baker is 71.\n\n\"It was very difficult to sit and think about what's going on downstairs. It's always more fun downstairs. My heart was always in the dugout,\" said La Russa, who has served in front office jobs for multiple teams since 2014.\n\n\"I think all managers would understand this, how rare it is to get an opportunity to manage a team that's this talented and this close to winning. ... The last few days, as this has gotten closer, my internal response has been excitement. No regret. I'm fired up and ready to go.\"\n\nLa Russa later took to Twitter as well.\n\nFired up to join @whitesox, a contending team in a tough division. Add my best efforts to theirs. Lots of comments. Some supportive and some not. Get to work and see the results. \u2014 Tony La Russa (@TonyLaRussa) October 30, 2020\n\nAccording to the Elias Sports Bureau, La Russa joins Jack McKeon as the only managers in MLB history to take over a team at age 75 or older. McKeon was 80 when he took over the Marlins in 2011.\n\n\"While I have had other inquiries about managing since retiring, this opportunity with the White Sox brings together a number of important factors that make this the right time and the right place,'' La Russa said. \"The on-field talent is amazing, and the front office, led by Kenny Williams and Rick Hahn, has done everything necessary to create an atmosphere of long-term success. All of those factors aligned to make this a tremendous opportunity, and I am excited to get going as soon as possible by building a coaching staff and getting to work.''\n\nLa Russa, who started his managing career with the White Sox during the 1979 season, is returning to the dugout for the first time since 2011, when he led St. Louis past the Texas Rangers in the World Series. He also won championships with Oakland in 1989 and the Cardinals in 2006.\n\nAll-Time Managerial Wins Tony La Russa ranks third in wins among managers in major league history and is second only to Connie Mack for games managed. Manager Wins Connie Mack 3,731 John McGraw 2,763 Tony La Russa 2,728 Bobby Cox 2,504 Joe Torre 2,326\n\nLa Russa is 2,728-2,365 with six pennants over 33 seasons with Chicago, Oakland and St. Louis. He was enshrined in Cooperstown in 2014. Only Hall of Famers Connie Mack (3,731) and John McGraw (2,763) have more victories.\n\nLa Russa got his first major league managing job at age 34 when the White Sox promoted him from Triple-A to replace the fired Don Kessinger. He took over that August and led them to a 522-510 record over parts of eight seasons.\n\nThe 1983 team won 99 games on the way to the AL West championship -- Chicago's first playoff appearance since the 1959 Go-Go White Sox won the pennant. But he was fired in 1986 by then-general manager Ken Harrelson after the White Sox got off to a 26-38 start.\n\nChairman Jerry Reinsdorf has long regretted allowing that move and remains close with La Russa. Now, they're reuniting.\n\n\"His hiring is not based on friendship or on what happened years ago, but on the fact that we have the opportunity to have one of the greatest managers in the game's history in our dugout at a time when we believe our team is poised for great accomplishments,'' Reinsdorf said.\n\nLa Russa was asked if his relationship with Reinsdorf is why he got the job.\n\n\"If there was any truth to what you're saying, it would not be reading Jerry Reinsdorf correctly,\" La Russa said. \"His major interest on the baseball side is what's best for the Chicago White Sox and the fans who drive to the ballpark in droves. He understands how much I love the game. I understand how much he loves it. Beyond that, I don't think its a factor.\"\n\nThe move is a surprise considering how long it has been since La Russa was in the dugout. Hahn said the White Sox were looking for someone who has \"experience with a championship organization in recent years.''\n\n\"This was made with the intent solely on putting us in the best position to win championships,\" Hahn said. \"It's easy to fall back on some old narratives that this was about friendship or potentially righting old wrongs. In the end, Tony was the choice because we believe Tony is the best man to help us win championships over the next several years.\"\n\nBack In The Saddle The 34 years between managerial jobs with the same team for Tony La Russa is the longest span, by far, in MLB/NFL/NHL/NBA history. Span Manager Yrs Team 1986-21 Tony La Russa 34 CWS 1931-55 Dick Irvin 23 Chi. (NHL) 1954-76 Paul Richards 21 CWS 1933-55 Bucky Harris 21 Det. Elias Sports Bureau\n\nFormer Houston manager AJ Hinch and ex-Boston skipper Alex Cora fit that championship-experience description. Both were suspended by Major League Baseball for the 2020 season for their roles in the Astros sign-stealing scandal, and both lost their manager jobs. Their punishments ended this week.\n\nThough he hasn't been in a dugout in nine years, La Russa has remained a part of the game.\n\nShortly after retiring, he went to work in the league office for two years, assisting former Yankees manager Joe Torre in on-field discipline issues.\n\nIn May 2014, he was hired by the Arizona Diamondbacks to oversee their baseball operations. They signed Zack Greinke to a $206.5 million deal following the 2015 season. La Russa was demoted to an advisory role following a 93-loss season in 2016 and joined Boston's front office as a special assistant to then-president Dave Dombrowski in November 2017.\n\nLa Russa was with the Red Sox when they hired Cora and won the World Series in 2018. And he spent last season as a senior adviser for baseball operations with the Los Angeles Angels, assisting in player development. Whether any of manager Joe Maddon's eccentricities rubbed off on him remains to be seen.\n\nMaddon keeps a loose and fun atmosphere, whether it's having a magician or zoo animals at the ballpark or showing up for a spring training workout decked out in tie-dye with a 1970s van blasting Earth, Wind & Fire's \"Shining Star.'' La Russa, of course, was known more for his scowl than his smile. Now he's taking on a vibrant and outgoing team, where sky-high bat flips by Tim Anderson seem almost as common as pop flies.\n\nThen again, he's no stranger to managing outsized personalities. He had Rickey Henderson and Jose Canseco in Oakland, after all.\n\n\"I always reasoned that if it's sincere, I don't have a problem with it,\" La Russa said about younger players showing emotion. \"You want your players passionately involved in the competition.\"\n\nThe White Sox have never made back-to-back playoff appearances. But after ending a string of seven losing seasons, they are in position to change that.\n\nThey have a core of young players on team-friendly deals, starting with Anderson. Veteran Jose Abreu put himself in the running for AL MVP by driving in 60 runs. Ace Lucas Giolito pitched his first no-hitter.\n\nEloy Jimenez hit .296 with 14 homers and 41 RBIs. Luis Robert, who agreed to a six-year, $50 million contract in January, showed star potential in a roller-coaster rookie year. He got off to a great start and hit a massive homer in the playoff series against Oakland, though he also slumped in September.\n\nNow the White Sox are banking on La Russa to help push them to championships, just as he did with Oakland and St. Louis.\n\n\"This hiring today is another indication we've moved on to that final, most exciting stage,\" Hahn said. \"That's the one competing for championships.\"\n\nESPN's Jesse Rogers and The Associated Press contributed to this report."}]}
